About the Author
Cheryl Farr Leas may live on the mainland, but she’s a Hawaii girl
at heart. She fell in love with Diamond Head, aloha wear, and mai
tais in 1994 and has had trouble staying away ever since. Whenever
she’s not in the islands, she and her husband, Rob, make their
home in Phoenix, Arizona, where they love to hike the desert
mountains with their German Shepherd, Caleb.
Before embarking on a writing career, Cheryl served as senior
editor at Macmillan Travel (now Wiley), where she edited the
Frommer’s Hawaii travel guides for the better part of the 1990s.
Now happy to be a globetrotting author and branding consultant,
Cheryl also writes Maui For Dummies.
Dedication
This book is for Rob, for loving Hawaii as much as I do.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Lisa Renaud for her encouragement and assistance

tance with this edition. Also, thanks to the many Hawaii-based

Introduction
I
’m here to spread the good news: Hawaii really does live up to its
heady promise. These lovely tropical islands offer all the ingredients
of a carefree beach vacation.
Hawaii has an undeniable appeal — whether you’re 6 or 60, single or the
head of a growing family, the Survivor type or a newly minted millionaire.
Enjoyment is just a matter of knowing what you want from your island
vacation — and how to make it happen.
Planning a Hawaiian escape is easy — too easy, in fact. Far too many
people head off to Hawaii blindly without exerting just a bit of effort to
tailor a mass-market vacation to their own needs, tastes, and desires. So
just knowing that you want to look before you leap puts you well ahead
of the pack.
And picking up this guidebook shows that you have the right instincts
about your vacation planning.
About This Book
An island vacation is supposed to be easy and fun. Hawaii For Dummies,
5th Edition, will make the planning process easy and fun, too.
I’ve done all the legwork for you, and I’m not afraid to share my honest
opinions. I’ll help you decide what to include in your island vacation —
and, even more important, what not to include. You’ve worked hard to
set aside a few precious weeks for relaxation, and I don’t want you to
waste any time or money.
This book gives you the tools you need — just what you need, not too
much — so that you can make smart decisions about what works for
you and what doesn’t. Building your Hawaii vacation is like putting
together a jigsaw puzzle. This book helps you assemble the right puzzle
pieces so that they interlock smoothly. The finished product will reflect
the picture you want, not somebody else’s image of what your island para-
dise should be.
Conventions Used in This Book
The structure of this book is nonlinear: You can dig in anywhere to get
information on a specific issue without any hassles.

Hotels and restaurants are listed alphabetically with actual prices and
frank evaluations. I use the following abbreviations for commonly
accepted credit cards:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I include some general pricing information to help you as you decide
where to unpack your bags or where to dine. A system of dollar signs
shows a range of costs for one night in a double room in each hotel or a
typical meal at a restaurant (including appetizer, main course, dessert,
one drink, tax, and tip — per person). Check out the following table to
decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
Less than $150
Less than $20
$$
$150–$225
$20–$35
$$$
$225–$325
$35–$50
$$$$
$325–$450
$50–$75
$$$$$
$450 or more
$75 or more
Finally, for those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on
a map, a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, a
restaurant, or an attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-
way area, it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and your
needs as a traveler:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Hawaii and wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy some time in the sun.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Hawaii and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that overwhelms you with all the
information available about the Hawaiian islands. You don’t have
time to wade through a gigantic list of every single hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction out there. Instead, you want to zero in on the
places that offer the very best experiences in Hawaii.
Hawaii For Dummies, 5th Edition 
2

If you fit any of these criteria, then Hawaii For Dummies, 5th Edition, is
the book you’ve been waiting for!
How This Book Is Organized
Hawaii For Dummies, 5th Edition, contains seven parts. You can read
each chapter or part without reading the one that came before it — no
need to study up on Kauai if you’re heading only to Maui, for example.
Part I: Introducing Hawaii
This first part gives you an overview of what Hawaii is like so that you
can start getting excited about all the fun that lies ahead. I provide an
easy-to-scan list of the very best of the best — my personal picks of
Hawaii’s top hotels, restaurants, beaches, golf courses, and more. I also
give you a quick overview of Hawaiian history and culture and an intro-
duction to each of the Hawaiian islands to help you decide which islands
suit your fancy. I finish up this part with time-tested advice on how to
divide your time between the islands you want to visit and the scoop on
the best time to go.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii
In this part, I get down to the serious trip preparation, starting with
telling you how much you can expect your trip to cost and how to find
great deals. I offer the pros and cons of planning your trip on your own,
using a travel agent, and buying an all-inclusive package deal. I give you
all the ins and outs of flying to Hawaii, and how to travel between the
islands after you’re there. Finally, I give advice to folks with special
needs or interests, such as families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,
and gay and lesbian travelers. I even provide a how-to guide for couples
who want to tie the knot in the Aloha State.
Parts III through VI: Being There — the Islands
These parts form the bulk of the book and cover each destination in
detail. Each part is dedicated to one of the major Hawaiian islands —
Oahu (Part III), Maui (Part IV), the Big Island (Part V), and Kauai (Part
VI) — and offers all the specific advice and recommendations you need
while you’re there, including finding your way around, choosing the best
places to stay and eat within your budget, and how to enjoy the islands
best.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. If Parts III through VI are the
main course, think of these fun top-ten-list chapters as dessert. Chapter
18 tells you how to ditch the tourist look and act like a local, and
Chapter 19 focuses on one of everybody’s favorite topics: food! Chapter
20 advises lovebirds on how to indulge in the islands’ romantic charms.
Introduction 3

In the back of this book, your Quick Concierge contains lots of handy
information, with phone numbers and addresses of hospitals and phar-
macies, lists of local newspapers and magazines, and more. Check out
this appendix when searching for answers to the little logistical ques-
tions that may come up as you travel. You can find the Quick Concierge
easily because it’s printed on yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
Think of the following icons as signposts. I use them to highlight espe-
cially useful advice and things that you won’t want to miss.
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
The Best of the Best icon highlights Hawaii’s most extraordinary hotels,
restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, and rip-offs.
The Kid Friendly icon highlights attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
The Local Know How icon indicates well-guarded kamaaina (local)
advice that will give you the edge over malihini (newcomers) who don’t
know better.
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Where to Go from Here
As you read through this book and start to assemble your vacation,
remember: The planning really is half the fun. Choosing your island des-
tinations and solidifying the details don’t have to be a chore. Think of it
as just the first step on a voyage of discovery. I guarantee that a little
planning will produce an experience that’s that much more rewarding
and relaxing — really. So let’s get started!

Introducing Hawaii

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book introduces you to the wonders of
Hawaii. You discover why so many people are drawn to
these islands of aloha, and you begin to shape the basic out-
lines of your trip. I preview each island one by one and offer
tips of planning an itinerary. Then I help you ﬁgure out when
to go, with information on Hawaii’s climate, the least crowded
(and least expensive) seasons, and a full calendar of special
events.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Hawaii
In This Chapter
 Scoping out Hawaii’s top accommodations
 Uncovering the top dining establishments and luaus
 Exploring the best beaches and attractions
H
awaii is such a breathtakingly beautiful place and exudes such a
generous spirit of genuine aloha that just about every island expe-
rience offers something special. Hawaii is at its best when you experi-
ence its simple pleasures in their purest form. Here, everybody can feel
like royalty: A simple beach apartment can be your castle, a fresh
papaya and a cup of robust Kona joe can be your princely breakfast, and
a joyous aloha shirt can be your royal robe.
But if you’re looking for more worldly luxuries, that’s great, too — these
islands are flush with pampering experiences, and you’ll run out of time
before you exhaust all the possible ways to indulge yourself.
Whether you prefer the simple pleasures of life or are in the market for
island luxury at its finest, you’ll find it in Hawaii. This chapter is
designed as an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best — the Best of
the Best — that Hawaii has to offer.
The Best Luxury Resorts
Are you in the market for a little luxury — or a lot of it? Hawaii’s your
place. These islands are home to some of the world’s finest resorts. The
following are the best of the best:
 Halekulani (Oahu): The finest hotel on Waikiki Beach is the epit-
ome of graciousness and elegant aloha. The white-on-white rooms
are gorgeous, the service is impeccable, SpaHalekulani is a pamper-
ing oasis, and the restaurants are the best on the beach. See
Chapter 10.

 Kahala Hotel & Resort (Oahu): Oahu’s only AAA five-diamond
resort is a ten-minute drive from Waikiki — and a world away. The
Kahala combines big, beautiful rooms (including some of the best
bathrooms in the islands), premier service and dining, first-rate
amenities, and a virtually private crescent beach for a glorious
resort experience. A must for relaxation-seeking grown-ups who
want to be within easy reach of urban excitement. See Chapter 10.
 Fairmont Kea Lani Maui (Maui): This fanciful Moorish palace on
the sand not only is one of the finest, most romantic, and most
relaxing hotels in the islands, but also gives you so much more for
your money than Maui’s other luxury resorts. For the same price as
a standard hotel room at other places — and sometimes less —
here you’ll enjoy a large one-bedroom suite with a luxurious living
room, a complete entertainment system (including stereo and
DVD), and a huge marble bathroom. See Chapter 12.
 Grand Wailea Resort & Spa (Maui): Many tout the reserved under-
statement of the neighboring Four Seasons, but I’m underwhelmed.
Instead, I prefer this grand beach palace, with its exclusive tropical
theme park vibe and over-the-top treat at every turn. Hawaii’s best
pool complex awaits your (very lucky) kids, and you can indulge in
the island’s finest spa. The ultra-deluxe Napua Tower offers such
extra amenities as personalized concierge service. See Chapter 12.
 Hotel Hana-Maui (Maui): After years in the doldrums, this breath-
taking resort at the end of the “heavenly” Hana Highway has been
reborn as a luxurious haven of genuine Hawaiiana thanks to the
folks behind Big Sur’s Post Ranch Inn. This easygoing yet elegant
hideaway on 62 expansive oceanfront acres is reason enough to
cruise to the remotest end of the island. The intimate Honua Spa
only adds to the ecstasy. See Chapter 12.
 The Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii (Big Island): This elegant, attractive
beach resort is the Big Island’s most intimate and understated
luxury resort. Fairmont has done an admirable job infusing this ele-
gant property with authentic aloha; as a result, expect a full slate of
enticing cultural and outdoor activities. Dining is excellent and
service is imbued with warmth. Not quite as fabulous as the Four
Seasons or Kona Village (below), it’s also not quite so expensive,
either. See Chapter 14.
 Four Seasons Resort Hualalai (Big Island): You’ll want for nothing
at this elegantly understated resort, Hawaii’s best. Ask for a room
with an open-air lava-rock shower for the ultimate in natural-style
luxury. A stunning oceanfront pool with a graceful wooden deck
stands center stage, and a second comes stocked with friendly
stingrays. Service is impeccable, the restaurants are among the
island’s finest, and the superb Jack Nicklaus–designed golf course
is for guests only. See Chapter 14.
 Kona Village Resort (Big Island): Hawaii’s only all-inclusive resort
is the polar opposite of its sophisticated neighbor, the Four
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
8

Seasons Resort Hualalai (see preceding entry). Whereas that resort
offers every cutting-edge luxury, this South Seas paradise of tropi-
cal cottages offers something else really special: Blissful escape,
Gilligan’s Island–style, where your “Do Not Disturb” sign is painted
on a coconut and in-room entertainment is your glorious ocean
view. However long you plan to stay, stay longer — it still won’t be
long enough. See Chapter 14.
 Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa (Kauai): From start to finish, this
crown-jewel Hyatt is one of Hawaii’s most satisfying resorts.
Situated on Kauai’s sunny south coast, the resort boasts a genuine
tropical vibe with big, beautiful rooms; a terrific pool complex that
pleases both kids and adults alike; a brilliant spa with open-air
treatment rooms; and service that exudes the most genuine aloha.
I’d move in if I could afford it. See Chapter 16.
 Princeville Resort Kauai (Kauai): If it weren’t for the fact that guest
rooms lack open-air lanais, this stunning North Shore resort would
be perfect; as it is, it comes very close. Situated on the Garden Isle’s
most breathtaking coast, the resort offers spectacular views in
every direction, and just out the back door is one of the island’s
finest beaches for snorkeling and sunbathing. The views alone are
reason to come — but you won’t be disappointed with elegant
appointments and attentive service, either. See Chapter 16.
The Best Accommodations Values
Don’t have limitless cash? No worries. Get the most for your accommo-
dations dollar by booking into one of these fine establishments:
 The Breakers (Oahu): This vintage, low-rise charmer remains a
breath of fresh air in increasingly expensive Waikiki. Everything is
budget-basic but spotlessly kept. Units are set around a sparkling
pool and garden blooming with tropical hibiscus, creating an oasis
in this increasingly chic corner of Waikiki. Not for everybody, but
an excellent choice for budget travelers who want to experience a
genuine slice of Old Waikiki aloha. See Chapter 10.
 Embassy Suites — Waikiki Beach Walk (Oahu): Certainly, the rack
rates aren’t the lowest. But the all-suite accommodations (including
pull-out sofas to accommodate the kids), the generous buffet break-
fast with cooked-to-order omelet station, and the justifiably popular
nightly manager’s reception with drinks, pupus, and live entertain-
ment, all included in the rate, make this brand-new heart-of-Waikiki
hotel a terrific value. See Chapter 10.
 The Wyland Waikiki (Oahu): Hawaii’s first artist-themed hotel is a
boon for modern-minded travelers who crave something stylishly
different for a middle-of-the-road price. A confidently relaxed oasis
in the heart of Waikiki, this attractive boutique-style hotel evokes
the ocean world at every turn in its sleek, contemporary yet 
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Hawaii 9

comfortable design — and the Outrigger chain runs things wonder-
fully from behind the scenes. See Chapter 10.
 Kaanapali Beach Hotel (Maui): This charming, older beachfront
hotel is the last hotel left in Hawaii that gives you a real resort
experience at a moderate price. The resort brims with genuine
aloha spirit and good value — and the on-the-beach location can’t
be beat. See Chapter 12.
 Napili Bay (Maui): These petite studios on the sand are one of
Hawaii’s best beachfront bargains — especially considering their
prime location on in-demand Maui. The beach is gorgeous, the
snorkeling is prime, the units are thoughtfully outfitted, and the
value is even better. The all-studio configuration makes this a ter-
rific option for budget-minded honeymooners. See Chapter 12.
 Noelani Condominium Resort (Maui): This top-notch oceanfront
condo complex is an excellent value and a really enjoyable place to
stay. Every unit — from the value-minded studios for two to the
family-friendly two- and three-bedroom apartments — boasts an
ocean view and all the comforts of home. See Chapter 12.
 Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa (Big Island): Want a beach-
front resort with all the perks, but without the hefty price tag? Try
this pleasing — and pleasantly affordable — resort, situated on one
of the sunny Kohala coast’s finest beaches. A prime location, a gen-
uine tropical feel, and activities galore, all for a fraction of the rates
at its ritzier neighbors. Not cheap, but a relative bargain. See
Chapter 14.
 Nihi Kai Villas and Waikomo Stream Villas (Kauai): These wonder-
ful condo complexes on Kauai’s sunny south shore, both managed
by the Parrish Collection, offer the best accommodations values on
the Garden Isle. Waikomo Stream’s one- and two-bedroom apart-
ments are ideal for families who want all the comforts of home at
bargain-basement prices. Nihi Kai’s one-, two-, and three-bedroom
apartments are closer to the beach and a bit more upscale, but
offer equally excellent value. See Chapter 16.
The Best Restaurants
Whether you’re looking to celebrate a special occasion or mapping out a
culinary calendar for the length of your stay, don’t overlook these fabu-
lous restaurants:
 Roy’s Restaurants (all islands): Star chef Roy Yamaguchi is the
Babe Ruth of Hawaii Regional Cuisine. His chain of Roy’s restau-
rants has brought island-style fine dining to cities across the world,
but his best successes remain those closest to home. Roy’s restau-
rants are special occasion–oriented without feeling formal or
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
10

imposing. My favorite way to dine here is family-style from the
tapas-style appetizer menu, which offers the best variety of Roy’s
signature taste sensations. See Chapters 10, 12, 14, and 16.
 Sansei Restaurant & Sushi Bar (Oahu/Maui/Big Island): Chef D.K.
Kodama’s superstar sushi bars offer some of the finest dining in the
islands. Choose from an adventurous sushi menu, or opt for family-
style dining on a slate of D.K.’s palate-stimulating Euro-Asian signa-
ture creations. Best of all, the restaurants are casually comfortable,
service is always a delight, and it’s easy to keep the bill within
reason. I’m pleased to see this Maui favorite expanded to Waikiki
and the Big Island’s Kohala Coast, where first-rate dining tends to
be in short supply. See Chapters 10, 12, and 14.
 Alan Wong’s Restaurant (Oahu): If there is one master of Hawaii
Regional Cuisine above all others, it is Alan Wong. His warmly con-
temporary and tropical Honolulu dining room is the ideal showcase
for his fine-dining twists on the local culinary tradition. 
 Nobu Waikiki (Oahu): The first Pacific island venture from interna-
tionally acclaimed Japanese chef Nobu Matsuhisa bursts with inno-
vative spirit. Unusual textures, impulsive combinations, and
surprising flavors — all served in a setting that sets a new standard
for high drama — add up to a first-rate dining adventure that you
won’t soon forget. A real joy for adventure-seeking gourmands. See
Chapter 10.
 Lahaina Grill (Maui): This Lahaina mainstay still shines as one of
Hawaii’s most glorious dining experiences. Lahaina Grill gets it all
just right, from the pretty sophistication of the dining room to the
beautifully prepared dishes to the first-rate service that fuses per-
sonal warmth and professionalism perfectly. Special-occasion
restaurants hardly come finer than this. See Chapter 12.
 Haiilimaile General Store (Maui): Star chef Bev Gannon, the queen
of Hawaii Regional Cuisine, continues to deliver one of Hawaii’s
finest all-around dining experiences — top-quality island-style
cooking joyfully presented in a refreshingly casual and pretension-
free setting. A delight from start to finish — well worth the drive
Upcountry. See Chapter 12.
 Mama’s Fish House (Maui): The increasingly sophisticated Valley
Isle is coming perilously close to surpassing Oahu as the fine-dining
island of choice for vacationing gourmands. My absolute favorite in
this well-stocked sea is this delightful seafooder, which offers a
magical combination of food, ambience, and service. Sure, prices
are high, but the Tiki-room setting is an archetype of timeless
Hawaii cool, and fresh island fish simply doesn’t get any better than
this. See Chapter 12.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Hawaii 11

 The Hualalai Grille by Alan Wong (Big Island): The Hualalai Grille
strikes all of the same exquisite, inspiring notes that Oahu’s origi-
nal Alan Wong’s does, but adds the appeal of a gorgeous, casually
sophisticated resort setting for a marriage made in culinary
heaven. Service is thoughtful, attentive, and unpretentious, and
every course is as it should be. Don’t miss it. See Chapter 14.
 Beach House Restaurant (Kauai): A winning combination of cre-
ative island cuisine, cool tropical cocktails, and one of the most
romantic oceanfront settings in the islands make this Kauai’s finest
restaurant, hands down. Just ask Honolulu magazine, which once
again selected the Beach House as its Kauai favorite in 2008. Come
for sunset for the ultimate swoon. See Chapter 16.
The Best Beaches
The world’s finest surf and sands fringe the shores of Hawaii’s islands.
The finest are these breathtakingly beautiful beaches:
 Waikiki Beach (Oahu): This beach is the most famous one on the
planet for a perfectly good reason: It lives up to its reputation in
every way. The world’s biggest and best beach party actually
inhabits a string of stunning beaches fringing crystal clear,
turquoise blue waters. There’s something for everybody, whether
you want to learn to surf, play in the waves, or just bask in the
glory of it all. See Chapter 11.
 Hanauma Bay (Oahu): Without exception, this sunken volcanic
crater on Oahu’s sunny southeast coast is Hawaii’s premier snorkel
spot for beginners and experts alike. The bay is preserved as a
marine life conservation district, and the fish seem to know it —
they’ll practically come up and stare into your mask. Even non-
swimmers can wade in, look down, and see a whole new kaleido-
scopic side of Hawaii. See Chapter 11.
 Waimea Beach Park (Oahu): This legendary surf spot is my
favorite place to watch big-wave riders in action in the winter
months. It’s a nonstop rollicking beach party when the surf’s up
and the daredevils are in the water. The rolling waves leave a placid
pool behind in summer; that’s when everybody can jump in to
frolic in the surf. See Chapter 11.
 Kaanapali Beach (Maui): This fabulous, crescent-shaped beach is
reminiscent of the Waikiki of yesteryear, before the entire world
made it their destination of choice. There’s something for everyone
here: crystal-clear snorkeling, thrilling wave jumping, golden sands
inviting hours of sunbathing, even beachfront bars for enjoying that
perfect middle-of-the-day mai tai. See Chapter 13.
 Hookipa Beach Park (Maui): Come to watch the world’s best wind-
surfers pirouette over white-capped waves at this glorious north
shore beach. Surfers have eminent domain in the mornings, and the
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
12

colorful windsurfers take over in the afternoons. The action is
equally breathtaking at any time of day, especially when the winter
waves are in top form. See Chapter 13.
 Hapuna Beach (Big Island): Don’t let anybody tell you that the vol-
canic Big Island doesn’t have any good beaches. Copiously
endowed with delicate white sands and gorgeous turquoise waves,
this beauty isn’t just the star of the Big Island — it just may be the
most beautiful beach in all of Hawaii. Great facilities are the icing
on the cake. See Chapter 15.
 Kahaluu Beach Park (Big Island): This roadside salt-and-pepper
beach isn’t much to look at, but its shallow, protected waters offer
some of the finest snorkeling in the islands. See Chapter 15.
 Anini Beach (Kauai): This North Shore beach is one of the most
beautiful — and one of the safest — swimming beaches on Kauai.
The golden sands and shallow waters are protected by an offshore
reef even when rough winter waves pound other North Shore
beaches, making this an ideal snorkel spot. An always-peaceful feel-
ing at this beach makes it ideal for quiet contemplation, too. See
Chapter 17.
 Poipu Beach Park (Kauai): This south shore beach is Kauai’s
favorite family playground. There’s something for everybody here:
white sands for sunbathing, grassy lawns for picnicking, shallow
pools for little ones to play in, reefs for good snorkeling, and waves
for boogie boarders. Lots of great facilities round out the perfect
beach day. See Chapter 17.
The Best Activities and Attractions
If all you want is an oceanfront hammock and a mai tai, Hawaii’s your
paradise. But part of the beauty of Hawaii is that it has a bounteous
menu of rich experiences to offer if you’re motivated to do more. These
activities and attractions are Hawaii’s finest:
 Touring the USS Arizona Memorial (Oahu): There’s hardly a more
moving site than this stark memorial to the nearly 1,200 who lost
their lives in the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor on December 7,
1941, which launched the United States into World War II. Arrive
early for the best experience and pair your visit with a tour of the
Battleship Missouri Memorial, also in Pearl Harbor, for a tragedy-
to-triumph view of World War II. See Chapter 11.
 Visiting the Bishop Museum (Oahu): If you’re intrigued by Hawaii’s
vibrant culture, the best place to get a little background is at this
captivating museum, rich with the treasures of Hawaii’s past. Pair a
visit with a trip to Iolani Palace, the official royal residence of
Hawaii’s last monarchs, for a surprisingly riveting history lesson.
See Chapter 11.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Hawaii 13

 Whale-watching with the Pacific Whale Foundation (Maui):
Whale-watching is a premier activity in the islands from mid-
December until mid-March. Boats are available to take you whale-
watching from every island, but I love the Pacific Whale Foundation
for its excellent naturalist guides and its nonprofit commitment to
protecting whales in Hawaii. See Chapter 13.
 Diving Molokini (Maui): This sunken volcanic crater is one of
Hawaii’s top dive spots thanks to calm, clear, protected waters; an
abundance of marine life, from reef dwellers to manta rays; and
exciting viewing opportunities for every level of diver — even first-
timers. You don’t dive? No worries — Molokini offers excellent
viewing for snorkelers, too. Molokini is reachable only by boat, so
see Chapter 13 for recommended outfitters.
 Exploring otherworldly Haleakala on horseback (Maui): A deso-
late, otherworldly canyon painted in hues of blue and green and
red, Haleakala National Park will reshape your idea of breathtaking
natural beauty. The best way to experience it is to delve deep into
the crater with Pony Express Tours, which leads excellent and
informative trail rides along Sliding Sands Trail into the heart of the
volcano. See Chapter 13.
 Driving the “Heavenly” Road to Hana (Maui): Hawaii’s most spec-
tacular drive is well worth a day of your vacation. For 52 winding
miles, this blissful highway takes you past flowering gardens, spec-
tacular waterfalls, and magnificent ocean vistas. Start early and
keep in mind that it’s all about the drive, not about getting to the
end of the road. Rent a convertible for maximum effect. See
Chapter 13.
 Snorkeling Kealakekua Bay (Big Island): This magical marine life
preserve, reachable only by watercraft, is my absolute favorite
snorkel spot in Hawaii. The coral is the most beautiful I’ve ever
seen, and the calm, clear waters teem with a kaleidoscope of color-
ful reef fish, octopuses, and sea turtles, plus playful spinner dol-
phins who often swing by to see what all the fuss is about. My
favorite way to get there is with Fair Wind Snorkel Cruises & Orca
Raft Adventures, although experienced kayakers can rent and
paddle their way in. See Chapter 15.
 Exploring the Big Island with Hawaii Forest & Trail (Big Island):
Nobody shows you Hawaii’s natural wonders like this terrific nature
guide company. You may have seen owner Rob Pacheco on the
Travel Channel; Rob and his troupe of well-trained guides take you
into the remote valleys of the rain forest, as well as help you scale
the star-studded crest of Mauna Kea, and burrow through hidden
lava tunnels. You can see a side of Hawaii that few others do —
don’t miss it! See Chapter 15.
 Visiting Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (Big Island): In my book,
if you do one nonbeach-related activity in Hawaii, this should be it.
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is the only national park that’s
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
14

home to a live, lava-pumping volcano. Witness the yin/yang magic
of the oozing red stuff as it leaves destruction in its landscape —
and shapes new virgin land. Hikers shouldn’t miss the otherworldly
Kilauea Iki trail, which traverses four sensational miles of steaming
lava beds. See Chapter 15.
 Stepping back in time at Puuhonua O Honaunau National
Historical Park (Big Island): This ancient “city of refuge,” the most
compelling historic attraction in the islands, is guarded by fierce
ancient totems just like it was back in the day. The archaeological
excavations and restorations are fascinating, and the ancient sanc-
tuary city is downright fun to explore. See Chapter 15.
 Touring Kauai’s Na Pali Coast State Park (Kauai): Hawaii’s most
majestic coastline is a 22-mile stretch of green-velvet fluted cliffs that
wrap around the northwest shore of Kauai. It’s all but inaccessible to
people, who can only reach it by sailing by, flying over, or hiking in —
and there are outfits to take you there by any route you choose. The
effort is well worth it. See Chapter 17 for details on all options.
 Exploring the Allerton & McBryde Gardens (Kauai): These sister
National Tropical Botanical Gardens highlight the breathtaking
botanical beauty of the Garden Isle. Even those who don’t think
they have a passion for horticulture marvel at the natural majesty
of these two slices of paradise. I recommend starting with the more
manicured Allerton Garden, a turn-of-the-20th-century private
estate, and then returning to tour the McBryde Garden if you want
more. Check the schedules in advance and plan accordingly. See
Chapter 17.
 Learning to surf (Oahu, Maui, and Kauai): Believe it or not, surfing
is easier than it looks — and there’s hardly a feeling finer than con-
quering a wave. A number of good surfing schools guarantee that
you’ll be hanging-ten in a single two-hour lesson. My favorites are
Hawaiian Fire Surf School on Oahu, where you’ll learn at the
hands of moonlighting Honolulu firefighters; the Nancy Emerson
School of Surfing on Maui; and Kauai’s Margo Oberg Surf School.
See Chapters 11, 13, and 17.
 Hitting the links (Oahu, Maui, Big Island, and Kauai): All the islands
boast championship courses designed to make 18-hole memories,
but you’ll find the most spectacular challenges on the neighboring
islands; others may argue, but I think the Big Island boasts the
most breathtaking selection of courses. Book before you leave
home to guarantee tee times. See Chapters 11, 13, 15, and 17.
 Getting a bird’s-eye view of the islands of Aloha (Maui, Big Island,
and Kauai): Touring Hawaii by helicopter gives you a perspective
that others simply can’t enjoy — a bird’s-eye view of desolate
mountain peaks or the heart of a bubbling volcano. These tours
give you access to each island’s otherwise inaccessible heartland,
where nature has been unspoiled by modern man. Expensive, but
worth it. See Chapters 13, 15, and 17.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Hawaii 15

 Saying “aahh . . .” at the spa (Maui, Big Island, and Kauai): What’s
the icing on the cake of any vacation? A pampering spa day, of
course. The neighbor islands’ spas, in particular, have raised the
art of relaxation and healing to a new level, showcasing Hawaiian
products and traditional treatments. On Maui, nobody does it
bigger and better than Spa Grande, a temple to the good life whose
hydrotherapy circuit is reason enough to come. For something dif-
ferent, try the petite but magical Maui Spa Retreat, a hidden
Upcountry gem that made me finally understand the magic of aro-
matherapy. My Big Island favorite is the Mauna Lani Spa, a simply
glorious open-air retreat. On Kauai, don’t miss the Anara Spa,
which set the standard for alfresco island-style pampering and is
still going strong. See Chapters 13, 15, and 17.
The Best Luaus
The best luaus are in high demand, so book your spots before you leave
home to ensure access:
 Old Lahaina Luau (Maui): Hawaii’s most authentic and acclaimed
luau is justifiably celebrated — it doesn’t get better than this. Come
early to watch craftspeople at work in the lovely oceanfront setting;
you can also watch as the luau pig is unearthed from its under-
ground oven, where it’s been slow-cooking all day. The live hula
show is dazzling. See Chapter 12.
 The Feast at Lele (Maui): The folks behind the Old Lahaina Luau
(see the preceding entry) also operate this interesting twist on a
traditional luau — perfect for romance-seeking couples, or anyone
who would prefer a luau with a more upscale demeanor, a more
intimate setting, and/or a fine-dining twist. The multicourse meal
and thrilling performance troupe reach beyond the Hawaii tradition
to celebrate the food and culture of the South Seas as well, and the
beachfront setting can’t be beat. See Chapter 12.
 Kona Village Luau (Big Island): The Big Island’s best luau is offered
on Wednesdays and Fridays only, so plan accordingly. The luau
grounds aren’t oceanfront, but the South Seas–style setting of
grass-roofed huts and swaying palms offers ambience in excess.
The food is excellently prepared, and the stage show is a real
delight. See Chapter 14.
 Luau Kalamaku (Kauai): This newcomer is one of the most theatri-
cal and satisfying luau productions in the islands, telling an in-
depth story of Hawaii’s heritage in an artful, original showcase. The
party is held on the lovely grounds of a historic 1930s plantation
house at Kauai’s lush heart. A traditional imu ceremony gives way
to a bountiful and delicious luau spread, and a full open bar means
real cocktails, not mass-produced mai tais. Tuesday and Friday
only, so plan ahead. See Chapter 16.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the fascinating story of Hawaii’s past
 Appreciating Hawaii’s local architecture and design
 Experiencing the joys of island-style dining
Just thinking about a Hawaii vacation warms the soul, doesn’t it?
Turquoise waves, white sand, toasty sun. Palm trees swaying in the
breeze as emerald-green cliffs rise up to meet a sweet blue sky. The fra-
grance of orchids filling the air as the music of a slack-key guitar carries
you into tropical reverie. . . .
Vacation has long been the ultimate antidote to the stresses and strains
of daily life — and no destination is more relaxing and restorative than
the exquisite Hawaiian Islands. Renewal calls for total escape to this
idyllic tropical paradise, where days of soaking up the island sun are
interwoven with easygoing adventuring and plenty of friendly aloha (an
all-purpose greeting meaning hello, welcome, or goodbye).
History 101: The Main Events
Hawaii’s historic tapestry is far richer than what can be re-created in
these few pages. If you’re interested in the whole story, pick up Shoal of
Time: A History of the Hawaiian Islands (University of Hawaii Press) by
Gavan Daws. Both definitive and delightful to read, Shoal of Time is the
ideal one-volume history of Hawaii. From the geological formation of the
islands through statehood, the Hawaii story is so well told that it reads
like a novel. So rich with detail, the characters who shaped Hawaiian his-
tory come alive in its pages.
A.D. 700: The first Hawaiians arrive
The first Hawaiians arrived by canoe from Tahiti and the Marquesas
Islands, some 2,500 miles to the south, as part of a greater Polynesian
migration. They likely arrived at the southernmost Big Island first; what
they found was a pristine and blessedly empty island, roiling with fire
from the volcanoes at its heart. An entire Hawaiian culture grew from
these first settlers. As islanders migrated throughout the chain, each

island became its own distinct kingdom. The inhabitants built temples,
fishponds, and aqueducts to irrigate taro plantations. Sailors became
farmers and fishermen. The alii (high-ranking chiefs) created a caste
system and established taboos. Ritual human sacrifices were common.
Life was both vicious and blissful — just like the islands’ breathtaking
landscapes.
1778: The “modern” world arrives
For 1,000 years, no Hawaiian ever imagined that an outsider would
appear in these remote “floating islands.” But in 1778, Captain James
Cook sailed into Waimea Bay on Kauai on his ship the Resolution and
was welcomed as the Hawaiian god Lono.
Cook stumbled upon the Hawaiian Islands quite by chance. He named
them the Sandwich Islands, for the Earl of Sandwich, a great friend and
first lord of the British admiralty, who had bankrolled the expedition.
The Big Island would ultimately be the death of the world-famous
explorer — but not before stone-age Hawaii entered the age of iron, and
the West forged a permanent foothold. Gifts were presented and objects
traded: nails for fresh water, pigs, and the affections of Hawaiian women.
The sailors brought syphilis, measles, and other diseases to which the
Hawaiians had no natural immunity.
The islands were united as one kingdom by Kamehameha I in 1810; he
used guns seized from a British ship to establish his iron-fisted rule. The
door was open, and the new Hawaiian monarchy welcomed the West
with open arms. In April 1820, the first missionaries arrived from New
England. Victorian mores overtook island style, and eventually sub-
sumed it; hula was abolished in favor of reading and writing, and neck-
to-toe dress became the norm. At the same time, missionaries also
played a key role in preserving island culture. They created the 13-char-
acter Hawaiian alphabet, and began recording the islands’ history. Until
this time, history was only passed down from generation to generation
orally, in memorized chants.
The children of the missionaries became the islands’ business and politi-
cal leaders. They married Hawaiians and stayed on in the islands, caus-
ing one astute observer to remark that the missionaries “came to do
good and stayed to do well.” More than 80 percent of all private land was
owned by nonnatives within two generations. Sugar cane became big
business, and planters imported immigrants by the thousands to work
the fields as contract laborers. The first Chinese came in 1852, followed
by Japanese in 1885, and Portuguese in 1888. These immigrants would
have a lasting and influential impact on island culture that persists in the
present day. King David Kalakaua — known as the “Merrie Monarch” for
the elaborate parties he threw — ascended to the throne in 1874, mark-
ing the beginning of the end of the short-lived Hawaiian monarchy. He
performed a few acts of note, however: He built Iolani Palace in 1882,
lifted the prohibitions on the hula and other native arts, and gave Pearl
Part I: Introducting Hawaii 
18

Harbor to the United States. In 1891, King Kalakaua visited chilly San
Francisco, where he caught a cold and died. His sister, Queen
Liliuokalani, assumed the throne.
1893: Paving the way for tourism and statehood
On January 17, 1893, a group of American sugar planters and missionary
descendants, with the support of U.S. Marines, imprisoned Queen
Liliuokalani in her palace, where she penned “Aloha Oe,” the famous
song of farewell. The monarchy was dead. Hawaii was now an American
territory ruled by the powerful sugar-cane planter Sanford Dole. He and
his cohorts — known as the Big Five — controlled the entire economic,
social, and political life of the islands. Sugar was king, and the native
Hawaiians became a landless minority.
The first tourists to the islands were hard-core adventure travelers who
came to the Big Island in the late 1800s to see the roiling Kilauea volcano.
Among the adventurers was Mark Twain — who lauded Hawaii as “the
loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean.” But the new
industry didn’t stick until transportation improved, and the sugar indus-
try became too expensive to support. In 1901, W. C. Peacock built the ele-
gant Moana Hotel (now the Moana Surfrider) on Waikiki Beach. After a
concentrated marketing effort in San Francisco, 2,000 tourists came to
Waikiki in its first big tourism year, 1903. Tourism came by steamship; the
sailing took almost five days. By 1936, visitors could fly to Honolulu from
San Francisco on the Hawaii Clipper, a seven-passenger Pan American
plane; the flight took 21 hours, 33 minutes. Modern tourism was born and
was doing brisk business — until the Japanese arrived, that is.
On December 7, 1941, a Japanese air raid wreaked havoc on the
American warships parked at Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States
into World War II.
1959: Setting the stage for today’s Hawaii
The harsh realities of war gave way to the lighthearted culture of Blue
Hawaii, Trader Vic’s, and Arthur Godfrey. Hotels sprouted along curva-
ceous Waikiki beach. In 1959, this blossoming paradise became the 50th
state of the United States. That year also saw the arrival of the first jet
airliners. Postwar Americans had disposable cash, and now Hawaii was
an easy flight away. Visitors began to arrive in droves — and tourism as
we know it was off the ground, surpassing sugar as the premier industry
of the islands.
Tired of the plastic aloha that had supplanted genuine island culture,
Hawaiian elders started making a concerted effort to integrate tradi-
tional hula, chant, visual arts, and values into the vast array of visitor
experiences. Tourism and hospitality employees are now educated in
Hawaiian history, culture, and genuine aloha spirit. The culture that was
once clipped at the root has now come back in full bloom — and, thank-
fully, it’s stronger than ever.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Hawaii 19

Building Blocks: Local 
Architecture and Design
Thanks to blessedly mild weather that includes cooling year-round
trade winds and temperatures that don’t vary by more than 15 degrees
Fahrenheit from January to July, Hawaii thrives on open-air living. A
seamless blend of indoors and out is the prevailing architectural style.
Why put up a wall when you don’t have a reason to keep out the
weather — or the dazzling view?
The local architectural style is called kama’aina, or native born.
Kama’aina is a style rich in beautiful simplicity and island tradition.
True kama’aina architecture is generally open plan, in keeping with the
importance of multigenerational family living and the strength of the
community spirit — and to capitalize on those gentle ocean breezes.
Decoration is simple but beautiful, generally focused on the shapes,
materials, and hues of nature. My favorite example of a kama’aina
house is the open-air, native wood Holualoa Inn, nestled in the Big
Island’s Kona coffee country (see Chapter 14).
The finest homes are fitted with natural woods, such as ohia floors and
gleaming koa furnishings. Koa is a gorgeous hardwood that has been a
favorite of local artisans for centuries thanks to its deep palette and
rich grain. Crafts and furnishings made from the wood are increasingly
expensive, simply because koa is a slow-growth wood that takes
decades to replenish. If you can afford a piece to take home — perhaps
a jewelry box or a hand-turned calabash — you’ll likely treasure it as a
family keepsake for generations to come, as island families do.
Not all native materials are expensive, however. Some of the most beau-
tiful and tropically evocative home furnishings are crafted of simple,
light materials like bamboo and rattan. Most floor coverings are woven
mats, soft and cool on the bare feet. The finest are tightly woven lauhala,
crafted from pandanus leaves by talented artisans. The best place to
find lauhala in the islands is just down the road from the Holualoa Inn at
Kimura’s Lauhala Shop (see Chapter 15).
The beautiful shapes and hues of Hawaii’s bold fauna have woven their
way into the island’s favorite fabrics, too. Boldly hued tropical bark-
cloths — nubby cotton fabrics that wear well and say “old Hawaii” with
their large-leafed tropical and storytelling patterns — are famously
suited to the furnishings of the islands. Vintage fabrics can often be
found at two delightful Kauai shops, Bambulei and Yellowfish Trading
Company; if you want newly woven fabrics on the bolt, you’ll find a sea
of possibilities at Vicky’s and Kapa’a Stitchery, also on Kauai (see
Chapter 17); other fabric shops throughout the islands can be located at
www.thestateofhawaii.com/fabric.
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
20

Fabric designer Sig Zane (www.sigzane.com) has taken on the mantle of
master of the new Hawaiian style. His strong, simple duo-tone patterns
evoke island nature and culture with a strong sense of stewardship and
an unparalleled evocative ability. Sig Zane prints are beautifully simple
works of art, the ultimate badge of in-the-know fashion among
Hawaiianistas. His shirts, dresses, handbags, and accessories can be
purchased at his signature store on the Big Island (see Chapter 15).
Despite its glitz and glamour as a tourist destination, Hawaii is funda-
mentally a farming and fishing community — and the story is abundant
in its streetscapes. Simple plantation cottages were built to house the
workers brought in from all over the world to farm the islands’ abundant
sugar, pineapple, and taro fields; now, plantation style is the most perva-
sive architectural style in the islands, especially on the still-rural neigh-
bor islands. With their single-story style, bright facades, and sloping
roofs (many still crafted of corrugated aluminum), plantation cottages
embody the simple beauty of island life. A more elaborate, multistoried
style originated as the plantation manager’s home.
Ranch life predominates in the cool Upcountry of the Big Island and
Maui, where plantation life gives way to paniolo (cowboy) style. Paniolo
style is built for somewhat cooler weather; as a result, you’re likely to
find it to be a bit more familiar. Expect ranch-style homes with island
touches such as brightly painted exteriors and broad porches. Grander
buildings take on Victorian details and the aura of the Old West. The
bayfront storefronts along the city of Hilo’s Kamehameha Drive, on the
Big Island’s lush east coast, and the city’s charmingly Victorian Shipman
House Bed & Breakfast Inn (see Chapter 14) are excellent examples.
Experience paniolo style in its full glory by visiting Parker Ranch, one of
America’s largest working cattle ranches, located in the Big Island’s
misty Upcountry (see Chapter 15).
The Victorian influence on Hawaii even hit the beach. One of the most
excellent examples of the adaptation of European architecture to island
living is the Westin Moana Surfrider, Waikiki’s very first hotel (see
Chapter 10). This genteel clapboarded gray lady looks like it could have
been displaced from Nantucket from the street side — but stroll
through the structure to the ocean-facing veranda, and the style is all
Hawaii.
Hawaii is roughly halfway between Asia and the mainland United States,
so the Asian influence is pervasive in island architecture and design.
Pagoda-style influences are evident in residential and commercial archi-
tecture throughout the islands, especially in areas that absorbed the
wealth of Chinese and Japanese immigrants who came to work in the
fields generations ago and stayed. Oahu’s Chinatown offers the most
concentrated examples.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Hawaii 21

A Taste of Hawaii: Local Cuisine
Hawaii has lured some of the world’s finest chefs to its kitchens. About a
dozen or so years ago, Hawaii Regional Cuisine was born. Local chefs
were tired of turning out a stodgy menu of Continental fare that was
unsuited to Hawaii living. So they began to celebrate the bounty of the
islands, emphasizing the use of fresh, locally grown (often organic) pro-
duce, tropical fruits, the freshest seafood, and island-raised beef. Their
light, creative combinations often feature Asian accents as a nod to
Hawaii’s multicultural heritage.
This type of cuisine is often disguised under other names — Euro-Asian,
Pacific Rim, Indo-Pacific, Pacific Edge, Euro-Pacific, Island Fusion, and so
on — but it all falls under the jurisdiction of Hawaii Regional Cuisine.
Although there are variations, you can expect the following keynotes: lots
of fresh island fish; Asian flavorings (ginger, soy, wasabi, seaweed, and so
on) and cooking styles (searing, grilling, panko crust, wok preparations)
galore; and fresh tropical fruit sauces (mango, papaya, and the like).
Thanks to Hawaii’s proximity to the Pacific Rim and its large Asian popu-
lation, the islands boast a wealth of fabulous Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese,
and Japanese restaurants. And if Asian fare isn’t your thing, you’ll find
plenty of other options, from the French classics to good ol’ ranch-
raised, fire-grilled steaks. Hawaii’s cooks have even managed to put their
own spin on some of the world’s most revered foods — pizzas, burgers,
and burritos — with rousing success.
Seafood lovers, rejoice: Hawaii offers you an astounding array of fresh-
caught fish. In fact, you may find yourself puzzling over lists of unfamil-
iar fish on island menus. See Chapter 19 for a handy list of definitions
that will help you decide what to try.
Lest all this unfamiliar food talk make you think otherwise, remember
that the majority of Hawaii islanders are red-blooded, flag-waving
Americans — and they love a good burger just as much as your average
mainlander. Real local food is generally starchy and high in calories, so
the Atkins crowd will want to skip the traditional plate lunch, which usu-
ally consists of a main dish (anything from fried fish to teriyaki beef),
“two scoops rice,” an ice-cream-scoop serving of macaroni salad, and
brown gravy, all served on a paper plate. Plate lunches are cheap and
available at casual restaurants and beachside stands throughout the
islands.

H
awaii isn’t just one place — it’s an entire chain consisting of eight
major islands and 124 islets. Together, they form a 1,500-mile cres-
cent that slices a lush, volcanic swath through the sparkling Pacific
waters just above the equator (in the North Pacific Ocean, not the South
Pacific, as many believe).
The Hawaiian Islands are just a hair’s breadth larger, in total landmass,
than the state of Connecticut — but oh, what glorious square miles they
are. The islands are actually summits of underwater volcanoes that have
grown tall enough, in geologic time, to peek above the waves. (All the
volcanoes are dormant except for two on the Big Island: Mauna Loa,
which is not currently erupting at this writing, and erupting Kilauea,
which is part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. See Chapter 15 for more
information.) A volcanic core gives each island a breathtakingly rugged
mountainous heart.
Most of the island development is at sea level, along the sunny coastal
fringe of each island. Thanks to Hawaii’s proximity to the equator, those
coastal areas experience near-perfect weather year-round: temperatures
in the high 70s or low 80s, clear skies, and gentle trade winds.
Introducing the Hawaiian Islands
The eight main islands are Oahu (oh-wa-hoo), the hub of the Hawaii
island chain, and the “neighbor” islands: Maui (mow-ee); Hawaii, which
is more commonly called the Big Island; Kauai (ka-wah-ee); Molokai 

(mo-lo-k-eye); Lanai (la-nah-ee); Niihau (nee-ee-how); and Kahoolawe (ka-
ho-ho-la-vay). These islands make up more than 99 percent of the state’s
landmass. Of these, the first six are prime tourist destinations, each with
its own personality, attractions, and tropical appeal. (Niihau is a pri-
vately owned island with a tiny population that can be visited on occa-
sional tours from Kauai. Kahoolawe is an unpopulated island that was
formerly a U.S. military bombing target; it is now slowly recovering in
the loving hands of the Hawaiian people.)
Of the six islands that are open to tourists, four are ideal choices: Oahu,
Maui, the Big Island, and Kauai. Molokai and Lanai are much less devel-
oped and offer fewer places to stay; they’re worth visiting, but I gener-
ally recommend that you explore the four major islands first.
See the map on the inside front cover for locations of each of the
Hawaiian islands.
The Gathering Place: Oahu
Oahu is the most developed of the Hawaiian Islands and its greatest popu-
lation center — about 75 percent of Hawaii’s residents (about 875,000
people) live on this gateway island. About three-quarters of Oahuans
reside in Honolulu, the only real big city in the state. Hawaii’s most
famous district is the area of Honolulu called Waikiki, an urban beach
resort that stretches along the south coast of the island to the landmark
crater known as Diamond Head. A compact city of concrete and high-
rises, Waikiki is the most densely built of Hawaii’s beach resorts.
Oahu is a wonderful destination. It’s home to some of Hawaii’s best
sightseeing, including the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor, the
most moving tribute to World War II in existence; the best little museum
in the Pacific, the Bishop Museum; the world’s best cultural theme park,
the Polynesian Cultural Center; and much more. Oahu also boasts the
state’s finest restaurants and shopping, as well as (believe it or not)
some of Hawaii’s finest off-the-beaten-path adventures.
And Waikiki Beach really is fabulous, which is why travelers from
around the world regularly converge on this sunny little haven. In the
last few years, formerly kitschy Waikiki has been reinvented along more
sophisticated lines. It’s an extremely popular destination for Japanese
honeymooners, who love to shop along the main drag, Kalakaua
Avenue, at the couture boutiques (hello, Prada!). A multimillion-dollar
beachfront beautification project has been a big success. And recent
commercial gentrification in the form of the new Waikiki Beach Walk
development has successfully transformed Waikiki’s formerly seedy
west end, injecting it with a fresh, exciting vibe and a feeling of quality,
cohesion, and pedestrian-friendliness that it never had before. What’s
more, world-class dining has taken Waikiki by storm in recent years,
which has improved its quality as a destination considerably. However,
this is still Hawaii’s most densely populated and touristy destination, so
be prepared.
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
24

Waikiki maintains some of Hawaii’s best moderately priced hotels; you’re
even likely to score some of the best luxury-hotel rates here, too. In
addition, a comprehensive, easy-to-use public transportation system
makes Oahu the only choice for those who don’t want to rent a car.
Leave Waikiki off your itinerary if your singular goal is to get away from
it all. But if you’re up for endless diversion and don’t mind a few crowds
with your aloha — if you’re the type who revels in the glitz and energy of
it all — this justifiably world-famous beach party is the place for you.
Many newcomers who visit only Waikiki leave with the wrong idea about
Hawaii — that it’s more crowded, overbuilt, and urbanized than a real
tropical paradise should be. So if you want to go home without feeling
like you missed out on the magic, I also highly recommend that you dedi-
cate a day or more to exploring the island beyond Honolulu. Oahu’s
Windward Coast and its North Shore (the epicenter of Hawaii’s surf cul-
ture) offer some of the most gorgeous territory in the state — so gor-
geous that you might consider staying in one of these areas. Here are
some of Oahu’s pros and cons:
 Yes, Waikiki beach is overbuilt and crowded — but it’s still pure
magic. If you want some alone time, idyllic Windward Coast
beaches like Lanikai and Kailua are just a short drive away.
 If you want to kick back and do nothing, why hassle with Honolulu?
Opt for a neighbor island instead — or head straight to the North
Shore or Windward Coast. However, you should be the type who
prefers a do-it-yourself vacation if you opt for the latter, because
accommodations beyond Waikiki tend toward self-serve vacation
rentals.
 Budget seekers should know that Waikiki now has the cheapest
average room rate in Hawaii (about $167 a night) and boasts a sur-
prising number of reasonably priced hotels right on — or a stone’s
throw from — the sand.
 Oahu is home to Hawaii’s most famous snorkel spot, Hanauma Bay.
Sure, it gets crowded — but a whole new world awaits you under-
water here. Waikiki is a great place to learn to surf or boogie board,
and the windward beaches are great for wannabe windsurfers.
Another reason to keep Oahu on your agenda: The magical dolphin-
watching cruises offered by Dolphin Excursions.
 This island is the birthplace, and still the epitome, of surf culture. If
you want to learn to surf, you already know how, or you just like to
watch, this is the island for you — no question.
 Oahu boasts a multitude of family-friendly attractions and parks,
such as Sea Life Park, the Honolulu Zoo, the Waikiki Aquarium, and
Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park, to name a few. Waikiki Beach
itself is the perfect kiddie playland.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 25

 Honolulu is the destination for serious shoppers, boasting the
finest collection of alfresco malls in the country. You can find high-
end boutiques, first-rate department stores, and shops carrying
top-quality aloha shirts, surf gear, island-accented wares, and more.
 Attention, foodies: Dining doesn’t get any better in these islands,
either. Hawaii’s finest fine-dining restaurants have congregated on
Oahu; the best of the bunch is Alan Wong’s, where the master of
Hawaii Regional Cuisine flexes his wok with island-style aplomb.
And thanks to a robust multicultural population that has imported
culinary traditions from around the globe, it’s the best island for
eating ethnically and (relatively) affordably, too.
 Oahu boasts a nice selection of bars, nightclubs, and live entertain-
ment venues. The Halekulani’s House Without a Key is the best
place for sunset hula and cocktails in the islands, hands down.
The Valley Isle: Maui
When people think Hawaiian paradise, they usually think Maui. Almost
everyone who comes here falls in love with this island, and for good
reason: It offers the ideal mix of unspoiled natural beauty, tropical
sophistication, action-packed fun, and laid-back island style. In fact, the
readers of Condé Nast Traveler have voted Maui “Best Island in the
World” for 13 out of the past 14 years. That same poll even crowned
Maui as the “World’s Best Travel Destination” in 2005.
The Valley Isle is more like the mainland than any other place in Hawaii
(yes, even Honolulu). The highways and L.A.–style traffic jams and mini-
malls will look comfortingly familiar, or annoyingly so — it all depends
on your perspective. (Because Maui generally has only one main road
going in each direction, traffic can be worse at times in the Valley Isle’s
prime resort areas than it is on Oahu.) Although hotels have a bit more
breathing room on Maui than they do in Waikiki, the shoulder-to-shoul-
der resort development is far more dense than what you find on the Big
Island or Kauai. Also, Maui has the most high-profile population of relo-
cated mainlanders. A quicker pace of living prevails, which can make
Maui feel more like Southern California than Hawaii, especially in the
resort areas.
Despite the mainland-style development, Maui really is a tropical para-
dise, with golden beaches, misty tropical cliffs, and countless waterfalls,
especially along the Heavenly Road to Hana, one of America’s most
spectacular drives. Offshore are two of Hawaii’s finest snorkel and dive
spots. Onshore, at the summit of one of the island’s two great moun-
tains, is Haleakala National Park, a wild, otherworldly place that’s
hugely popular with hikers, bicyclers, and sunrise-watchers. Hawaii’s
finest luau, an excellent theater, and an energetic party vibe in Lahaina
make Maui the best choice for those who enjoy after-dark activities.
Furthermore, Maui is a close second to Oahu as a fine-dining destination.
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
26

Maui’s attractions are no secret — so expect to battle a few crowds and
pay for the privilege of visiting. I’ve heard an increasing number of com-
plaints about overdevelopment and crowds in the last couple of years.
And thanks to the rules of supply and demand, Maui tends to be more
expensive than other islands across the board; booked-to-capacity
hotels can be less than willing to reduce rates, high demand for car
rentals often push rates north of what you’ll find in the other islands,
restaurants are pricey even at the casual end of the spectrum, and the
high cost of all those available activities doesn’t help matters. What’s
more, the tacky heart of Hawaii now beats in the old whaling town of
Lahaina (which has superceded newly refined Waikiki as a cheesy tourist
center), and Kihei’s dominant architectural style is high strip mall. Still,
nothing can dull the sheen on Maui, which oozes sex appeal. There’s
enough excitement and activity to keep even the most go-go-go travelers
constantly on their toes.
Here are some of Maui’s pros and cons:
 The Valley Isle scores for abundant, wide, breathtaking beaches.
 Maui is a winner for the sheer variety of great snorkel, dive, and
learn-to-surf spots. One caveat: Molokini, a sunken offshore crater
that’s world famous for snorkeling and diving, has lost a great deal
of its appeal because of shoulder-to-shoulder snorkel boats and a
worn-down reef. The Big Island’s Kealakekua is a much better
snorkel-cruise destination.
 Despite its popularity and high resort rates, Maui has a decent
number of beachfront bargains. If you don’t want to go condo,
which is probably your best value-for-dollar bet, try the Kaanapali
Beach Hotel, one of my midpriced faves. Still, you’re likely to pay
more for accommodations here than you do on other islands.
 Maui has enough world-class golf courses to keep club-wielders
happy for a good, long time.
 The windsurfers at Maui’s Hookipa Beach are a blast to watch.
 Maui is the humpback’s favorite place to hang offshore. If you show
up during prime whale season (Jan–Mar), you’re bound to see
them, even if you don’t head out to sea.
 This action-packed island wins for its wealth of kid-friendly condos
and beaches, plus family activities galore. Your kids will wonder
why you haven’t come here before.
 Outdoor fun is the name of the game here. There’s something new
to do around every corner, from riding a bike down a volcano to
taking a snorkel cruise.
 If you have a yen to frolic among waterfalls, do not pass go, do not
collect $200 — head straight to Maui. The drive to Hana is chock-
full of fabulous falls, and at the end of the road is the granddaddy of
’em all, Oheo Gulch.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 27

 Maui boasts an innovative dining scene, from casual to chic — and
with a wealth of beautifully situated oceanfront restaurants to boot.
 Attention, shoppers: Maui has an increasingly excellent specialty
boutique and gallery scene, especially in Paia and Upcountry.
 Maui has surpassed Oahu as the nightlife capital of Hawaii. A party
mood characterizes Lahaina town; the resorts offer lots of after-
dark fun; and the Old Lahaina Luau is Hawaii’s absolute best. This
island even boasts the state’s best live theater in the form of the
Cirque du Soleil–goes-to-the-islands show ’Ulalena, plus a couple of
excellent ongoing magic revues.
 Traffic can be a bear on occasion, especially in the prime resort
areas — but the other neighbor islands are catching up quickly, so
it’s becoming increasingly difficult to single out Maui on this front.
The Big Island: Hawaii
Salt-and-pepper beaches, primal rain forests, stark lava fields as far as
the eye can see — this otherworldly island simply may not be your idea
of a tropical paradise. But travelers with a passion for adventure, an eye
for the unusual, or a taste for luxury will think that they’ve found heaven
on earth.
The island that gave the entire island chain its name is the largest in the
bunch — twice the size of all the others combined — and a real study in
contradictions: Don’t be surprised if you spot snow atop the nearly
14,000-foot peaks while you’re deep-sea fishing off the legendary Kona
Coast — considered the Sportfishing Capital of the World — or snorkel-
ing in some of the warmest waters in the Pacific. North of Mauna Kea is
vast ranchland, complete with herds of beef cattle and its own paniolo
(cowboy) culture.
The left (Kona-Kohala) side is hot, dry, and studded with expansive,
ultradeluxe beach resorts that add up to the finest collection of luxury
resorts in all of Hawaii. The Kona-Kohala coast is one of the finest water-
sports playgrounds on earth for divers, snorkelers, and kayakers,
whereas sun worshippers love white-sand Hapuna Beach, one of
Hawaii’s finest.
The right (Hilo-Volcano) side is lush, wet, green, and fragrant with tropi-
cal flowers. The misty city of Hilo is retro-charming, while postage
stamp–size Volcano Village puts you right in the heart of a tropical rain
forest.
In between are two of the tallest mountain peaks in the Pacific, Mauna
Kea and Mauna Loa; the summit of Mauna Kea offers some of the
world’s finest stargazing. At the heart of the island is Kilauea volcano,
the world’s largest active volcano, currently in the midst of recorded his-
tory’s longest-ever uninterrupted volcanic eruption. Most people think
of volcanic activity as solely destructive, but Kilauea’s eruptions have
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
28

actually been productive, adding more than 201 hectares of new land
(and counting) to the Big Island since January 1983. Needless to say,
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is one of the coolest — excuse me,
hottest — places you’ll ever have a chance to visit in your lifetime. If you
like weird places, you won’t want to miss it.
The Big Island can, however, dash expectations. It’s jaw-droppingly 
spectacular — force me to choose, and I’ll name it as my favorite of the
islands — but it falls short of some people’s tropical-island fantasies.
Rugged chocolate-brown lava fields in every direction greet visitors
flying into Kona Airport. Sure, you can lounge on a picture-perfect white-
sand beach as wide as a football field, or revel in the scent of wild
orchids in flowering rain forests, but you may have to go out of your way
to find them. Also, much of the island is rural, so nightlife is scarce.
There’s an increasing concentration of tacky development in the town of
Kona itself, and on my last visit, I was dismayed by the regular traffic
jams along the main roads. But still, the Big Island has a more laid-back,
quieter vibe than what you find on Oahu or Maui — and, much of the
time, you can also find relatively lower prices at all but the ultraluxury
resorts. A nice selection of affordable, family-friendly condos is on hand
(although most of them are not directly situated on beaches — budget
travelers may have to resign themselves to doing a bit of driving to
reach a great beach). And B&B lovers will discover the islands’ best col-
lection of inns, most offering an excellent base for visitors looking for a
personalized experience. Just remember that the sheer size of this extra-
large island makes for longer driving times; either plan on spending a
week or limit yourself to one coast only.
Here are some of the Big Island’s pros and cons:
 You can find some unusual beaches here, including a number of
striking black-sand options, as well as some drop-dead-gorgeous
classics like Hapuna Beach State Park, the crown jewel of island
sands.
 The Big Island is the place to park yourself in style. You can find a
string of terrific megaresorts along the Kona-Kohala coast, where
there’s plenty of room to spread out on a gorgeous stretch of sand.
 These spectacular championship resort golf courses, each an oasis
of manicured green surrounded by a sea of black lava, are simply
wild.
 You can find lots of activities here to keep you busy, including visit-
ing the phenomenal Hawaii Volcanoes National Park — but plan on
extended driving time getting around if you want to see it all.
 Kealakekua Bay is the best snorkeling and dolphin-watching spot in
all Hawaii, and the whole coast is tops for sea turtle spotting. It
offers great offshore diving too. And the icing on the cake? The Big
Island is a sportfisher’s mecca.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 29

 Big Island’s WOW! factor is a real draw for families, from fantasy
megaresorts to that amazing volcano. You can also find some
affordable family condos here.
 The fabulous resorts make great wedding locations. On the other
side of the island, lush rain forests and romantic B&Bs make great
places to hide away from the rest of the world.
 Also known as the “Orchid Isle,” the Big Island earns deserved
points for beautiful rain-forest lushness around Hilo and Volcano
Village — but the dry, arid Kona-Kohala coast is the antithesis of
some folks’ island dreams.
 The Big Island offers a very respectable slate of restaurants in both
the moderate and expensive price ranges, but the driving distance
between them can put a strain on your nightly choices.
 An abundance of natural resources makes this island tops for qual-
ity shopping of island arts and crafts. Expect to go on the hunt for
the best galleries, though.
 The Big Island is much quieter than Oahu and Maui. There’s a con-
centration of waterfront bars in the town of Kailua-Kona (some of
them a little too party-hearty and mass-market for my taste) and
some chic cocktail spots at the resorts — but if Kilauea’s spouting
red-hot lava, there’s no better after-dark show around.
 Traffic is an increasing problem in the Kailua-Kona area, so it’s
worth planning your accommodations to generally avoid town if
you won’t enjoy its touristy vibe.
 In recent months, the hazy fog known as “vog” has proven to be
quite an issue around the island thanks to the recent volcanic activ-
ity, causing scratchy throats and persistent coughs in select
regions of the island for days on end (not necessarily ones near the
volcano; it all depends on the winds). If you have any respiratory
issues that may cause you to worry, check current conditions with
your accommodations host.
The Garden Isle: Kauai
Of all the Hawaiian Islands, Kauai is the one that comes closest to
embodying the Hawaiian ideal — it’s the ultimate in tropical romance
and beauty. Even Hollywood thinks so, which is why Kauai has had star-
ring roles in movies ranging from Blue Hawaii and South Pacific to
Jurassic Park. The island landscape doesn’t get any more spectacular
than what you can find on Kauai. Every time I visit, I’m newly wowed by
how exquisite it is. Kauai boasts the kind of natural beauty that cameras
can’t really capture, and that even mere memory can’t conjure up. No
wonder that Kauai captured the number-two spot on Condé Nast
Traveler’s “Best Island in the World” list in 2006 and 2007.
Kauai is the perfect place to leave the modern world behind. Although
it’s beginning to sprout a few traffic jams, gardenlike Kauai is still quieter
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
30

and less developed than its sister islands; in fact, you can count the
number of full-fledged resorts on one hand. (This lack of choice makes it
important to book well in advance if you plan on staying at one of the
resorts.) Don’t come expecting Cancún-style nightlife or St. Thomas–
worthy shopping. Discover instead an unspoiled setting of wind-carved
cliffs, fertile valleys rich with taro, powder-fine white-sand beaches, and
gorgeous vistas in every direction. It’s an ideal setting for some well-
deserved relaxation time: The North Shore is the most tranquil and
beautiful shoreline in all Hawaii, and the South Shore’s Poipu (poy-ee-
poo) Beach is a fabulous, family-friendly playground that’s the ideal
place to kick back and paddle around in the waves for days on end.
Kauai is great for adventurous souls too. The island boasts two remote
natural wonders: the jagged emerald cliffs of the Na Pali Coast, and
Waimea Canyon, called the “Grand Canyon of the Pacific” for its remark-
able resemblance to the multicolored Arizona crater. The otherwise
inaccessible Na Pali Coast, in particular, is a tropical dream-come-true
for hikers, but you can also see these magical cliffs on a day cruise along
the coastline or on an eye-popping helicopter tour.
It takes a lot of rain to keep Kauai so lush, fertile, and flower-fragrant;
consequently, the weather here is a little less reliable than on the other
islands. Kauai is the one island where a week of rain can quash your fun-
in-the-sun plans. This is most likely to happen in winter, but it’s hap-
pened to me even in May. (Conversely, I’ve enjoyed a rain-free March on
the Garden Isle, and I’ve enjoyed sunny Kauai when it was raining every-
where else in the islands, so the weather is always anybody’s guess.)
Kauai’s Mt. Waialeale is actually the wettest spot on earth, commanding
an average annual rainfall of 444 inches; luckily, the coasts stay substan-
tially drier. Still, stick to the South Shore if you have your heart set on a
string of sunny days. The superlush North Shore is best for summer
vacations, when the wild winter surf has calmed down and the days tend
toward dry and sunny. (See “Revealing the Secret of the Seasons,” later
in this chapter, for more information on Hawaii’s weather.)
Here are some of Kauai’s pros and cons:
 It’s home to the powdery-white, palm-lined, postcard-perfect
beaches you fantasize about — and you’re likely to have them vir-
tually all to yourself as soon as you get here.
 Robert Trent Jones, Jr., called Kauai “the best island for golf there is.”
 It has great snorkeling and spectacular underwater sightseeing,
with a kaleidoscopic collection of marine life (although snorkeling
is not safe in winter).
 Although this island is mostly for the relaxation minded, Kauai
does have family-friendly condos, and Poipu Beach is fun for kids.
 Kauai is the undisputed winner in the romance category.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 31

 Kauai is the best island for catching up on relaxation time — but
you have lots to do if you want it, from movie tours to world-class
golf to ocean activities galore.
 The Garden Isle is the closest you can come to the realization of the
tropical dream — it’s simply stunning. Don’t miss the North Shore,
even if you drive up for only a day.
 Kauai has less dining variety than the other islands. However,
Poipu is home to my favorite branch of Roy’s, the temple of Hawaii
Regional Cuisine.
 The shopping is minimal in terms of quantity, but excellent for qual-
ity, especially if you like retro looks and island styles.
 Only one road circles the island. Traffic is becoming an increasing
problem on the island’s eastern coast (also known as the Coconut
Coast), which connects north shore to south. Increased density is
also bringing more mainland attitude and beginning to threaten
Kauai’s appealingly backwater way of life and slow pace.
The most Hawaiian isle: Molokai
Sleepy Molokai is a rural island that’s largely untouched by modern
development (although, as residents like to boast, they do have a KFC
restaurant now). This lean, funky, scruffy little place is often called the
most Hawaiian island because it’s the birthplace of the hula, and it has a
larger native Hawaiian population than any other in the chain. Although
it offers some lovely, secluded beaches, the island’s most famous site is
Kalaupapa National Historical Park, a world-famous 19th-century leper
colony that can only be reached by mule, prop plane, or helicopter.
I don’t really cover Molokai in this book because I don’t necessarily rec-
ommend making it part of your first visit to Hawaii. It’s worth seeing
eventually for its unsullied beauty and true Hawaiian spirit, but you
should fully explore the other islands before you devote a significant
amount of time to Molokai. And now that the Molokai Ranch has shut
down, taking the island’s best hotel and best restaurant with it, facilities
for visitors are minimal. If you’re interested in checking it out, however,
check out Maui For Dummies, Frommer’s Hawaii, Frommer’s Maui, or
Pauline Frommer’s Hawaii, all of which include complete coverage of the
island. Or contact the Molokai Visitors Association (% 800-800-6367 or
808-553-3876; www.molokai-hawaii.com). The Maui Visitors Bureau
(www.visitmaui.com) can also provide you with island information
because Molokai is part of Maui County. See the Quick Concierge in the
appendix for complete contact info.
The private island: Lanai
This tiny island (pop. 3,500) is featured on a few packages, but I don’t
recommend spending time here until you conquer the other islands.
Staying on Lanai is less a Hawaiian experience and more a generic park-
yourself-at-a-resort vacation, which you can do with more local flavor
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
32

elsewhere in the islands. For this reason, I don’t cover Lanai in detail in
this book.
If you’re committed to visiting Lanai, you don’t need this book, anyway —
this island is where you go to really get away from it all. Formerly dedi-
cated to pineapple production, Lanai is not particularly beautiful, nor
does it offer much in the personality department. There’s little or nothing
to do here, which is the entire idea of this getaway island. Just about
everything that is here is completely handled through the two megaex-
pensive resorts that have taken over this humble place: the English
manor house–style Four Seasons Resort Lanai, The Lodge at Koele, and
the beachfront Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay, both of which
are operated with élan by the ultraposh Four Seasons chain. If you visit
Lanai, plan on eating every meal at the two sister resorts, and otherwise
being entirely at their mercy. For the latest details on the hotel upgrades,
call Four Seasons at % 800-819-5053 or visit www.fourseasons.com.
I like visiting Lanai for a day of beachgoing, snorkeling, and sightseeing on
one of Trilogy Excursions’ day and overnight cruises from Maui; I tell you
how to sign up in Chapter 13. Golfers may also consider flying or ferrying
over from Maui for the day to hit the links, which is what many locals do.
If you really want to make Lanai a more substantial part of your vaca-
tion, check out Maui For Dummies, Frommer’s Hawaii, Frommer’s Maui, or
Pauline Frommer’s Hawaii, all of which include complete coverage of the
island. Or contact Destination Lanai at % 800-947-4774 or www.visit
lanai.net. You can also contact the Maui Visitors Bureau (www.visit
maui.com) because Lanai is part of Maui County. See the Quick
Concierge in the appendix for more contact information.
Visiting More Than One Island
Most Hawaii vacationers visit more than one island, which I highly rec-
ommend you do. But don’t try to cram too much in. About a week per
island is a good general rule — or you’ll end up spending too much time
in the airport, at the car-rental counter, and checking in and out of
hotels. Trust me on this one.
As you plan your itinerary, keep the following tips in mind:
 Try to fly directly from the mainland to the island of your choice.
Doing so can save you a two-hour layover in Honolulu and another
plane ride on an interisland carrier — a process that can add four
or five hours to your total travel time. Oahu, the Big Island, Maui,
and Kauai all receive multiple direct flights from the mainland.
However, be sure to compare prices if money matters.
 Remember the one-week, one-island rule. It’s smart to allot a
week per island. For a two-week vacation, three islands is max —
and that’s only if you’re the kind of traveler who can’t handle more
than three days amid the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33

 If you have two weeks and your heart is set on seeing three
islands, consider the following: Arrive in Honolulu and spend
three days seeing the highlights. Then head to Kauai to kick back
on the beach for four or five days and recover from the time you
spent running around Honolulu. After that, head to the Big Island,
which easily has a week’s worth of activities to keep you busy.
 Pass on seeing a third island if you’re committed to visiting both
Oahu and Maui in two weeks. Believe me, these two powerhouse
islands have more than enough to offer to keep you busy for two
months, much less two weeks.
 Never budget fewer than five days on the Big Island. The Big
Island is the size of Connecticut, and just about everything is
located on the island’s coastline; therefore, you’re going to be
spending plenty of time in the car if you really want to see every-
thing.
 Don’t overplan your itinerary or try to do everything. If relaxing
is number one on your agenda, work plenty of do-nothing time into
your travel plans. A Hawaii vacation is less about seeing everything
and more about going with the island flow.
 Leave at least one day per island to chance. Leave at least one day
on each island for whatever strikes your fancy, whether it be sight-
seeing or shopping or just sitting on your condo’s oceanfront lanai,
soaking up a novel and the laid-back vibe.
 If you’re dividing your day between land and sea activities, make
mornings your ocean time. Beaches tend to be less crowded, and
the surf and winds tend to be calmer in the morning hours — espe-
cially in winter. Always take the first snorkel and dive cruise of the
day, when conditions are calmest and clearest; there’s a reason
why outfitters offer discounts on their afternoon sails.
 Keep an eye on the weather and plan accordingly. Don’t be a
slave to your schedule — watch the local weather reports and keep
your plans flexible enough to make the most of great weather.
 Book extra-special activities before you leave home so that you
won’t miss out. Many of Hawaii’s best activities can book up weeks
in advance, so read this book and call ahead to reserve a few select
adventures before you leave home. After all, it’s not every day you
get to Hawaii — and I wouldn’t want you to miss out on the best
luau in the islands or the ecotour of a lifetime. For tips on activities
you may want to book before you arrive, see Chapter 9.
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
Situated in the North Pacific just 1,470 miles above the equator, the
Hawaiian Islands enjoy fabulous weather all year-round. Winter is virtu-
ally nonexistent. Severe storms are a rarity. Even those times considered
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
34

the “off season” — spring and fall — are gorgeous, which means that
those of you on a budget can save a bundle if you choose the right
dates.
Hawaii’s high season is during the winter months, from the second half
of December through mid-April, when people flee the cold, snow, and
gray skies of home for the warm sun of Hawaii. During this winter high
season, prices go up and resorts can be booked to capacity. This sce-
nario is especially true during the holiday season; book far in advance
for a trip during this period and expect to pay sky-high prices. Although
not nearly as bad as Christmastime, Easter week can also be crowded, as
West Coast families flock to the islands for a few days of sunshine over
spring break.
Summer (mid-June through Aug) is a secondary high season in Hawaii.
Because so many families travel over the summer break, you won’t find
the bargains of spring and fall — but you may still do better on accom-
modations, airfare, and packages than you would in the winter months.
Hawaii’s slowest seasons have traditionally been spring (from mid-Apr
to mid-June) and fall (from Labor Day to mid-Dec) — which, paradoxi-
cally, also happen to be the best seasons in Hawaii in terms of reliably
great weather. Herein lies the secret of the seasons: In spring and fall,
hotel rates typically drop, package deals abound, airfares are often at
their lowest rates of the year, and you can expect consistently warm,
clear days after you arrive.
Because the weather is relatively constant year-round, it’s a good bet
that you can arrive at any time of year and enjoy prime conditions. It
really boils down to how much you want to spend, how important it is to
escape a harsh winter back home, how willing you are to deal with
crowds, and what’s available.
Understanding Hawaii’s climate
Hawaii lies at the edge of the tropics, so it really has only two seasons:
warm (winter) and warmer (summer). Temperatures generally don’t
vary much more than 15 degrees or so from season to season, depend-
ing on where you are. The average daytime summer temperature at sea
level is 85°F, and the average daytime winter temperature is 78°F.
Temperatures stay even steadier when you consider the coastal areas
alone: At Waikiki, the average high is 89°F at the height of summer, and
the average winter high is 80°F at its coldest — not much difference.
Nighttime temps drop about 15 degrees — less in summer, a little more
in winter. August and September are usually the warmest months of the
year; January and February are the coolest months. Almost-constant
trade winds bring a cooling breeze even in the hottest weather.
Each of the islands has a leeward side (the west and south shores),
which tends to be hot and dry, and a windward side (the east and north
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 35

shores), which is generally cooler and wetter. For sun-baked, desertlike
weather, visit the leeward side of an island. When you want lush, jungle-
like conditions, go windward.
Locals like to say that if you don’t like the weather, just get in the car
and drive — you’re bound to find something different. That’s because
each island also has many microclimates (highly localized weather pat-
terns based on a region’s unique position and topography). On the Big
Island, for example, Hilo gets 180 inches of rainfall annually, which
makes it the wettest city in the nation — yet only 60 miles away is
desertlike Puako, which gets less than 6 inches of rain per year. So if
it’s raining on your parade, head somewhere else — you’ll likely reach
a sunny spot in no time. (The south and west coasts are usually your
best bet.)
Generally speaking, each island has a mountain (or mountains) at its
center. The higher you go in elevation, the cooler it gets. Thus, if you
travel inland and upward, the weather can change from summer to
winter in a matter of hours. If you visit Maui’s Haleakala National Park,
for example, you climb from sea level to 10,000 feet in just 37 miles —
and it’s not uncommon for the temperature to be 30 to 35 degrees cooler
at the summit than it is at the beach.
In general, October to March marks Hawaii’s rainy season; rainfall aver-
ages between 2 and 3 inches during these months. Summer, when aver-
age rainfall generally drops below an inch per month, is considered the
dry season. The weather can get gray during this season, but, fortu-
nately, it seldom rains for more than three days in a row. Winter isn’t a
bad time to go to Hawaii; the sun’s just a little less reliable, that’s all.
If you want assured sunshine year-round — or, at least as close as you
can get to a sure bet — base yourself in one or more of the following
regions:
 Waikiki, on Oahu
 Maui’s south coast (Kihei and Wailea)
 The Big Island’s Kona-Kohala coast
 The south and southwest coasts of Kauai (Poipu Beach and
Waimea)
Charting sea changes
Hawaii’s ocean waters stay warm year-round. The average water tempera-
ture in Waikiki is a warm 76°F even in winter, and reaches a jump-right-in
80°F or so in summer.
Wave action, though, varies greatly between winter and summer, and
from coast to coast. All Hawaii’s beaches tend to be as placid as lakes in
the summer and autumn months. In winter, the islands’ north-facing
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
36

beaches are hit with swells, and the surf goes wild, especially in places
like Oahu’s North Shore, where daredevil surfers with a death wish hang-
ten on monster curls that can reach 50 feet. South-facing beaches like
Waikiki generally remain calm and friendly to swimmers and snorkelers
of all ages and abilities throughout winter, although spring and early
summer bring south swells right about the time North Shore waves flat-
ten out.
If the waves are too powerful for you, seek calmer conditions by taking a
short drive to another beach that’s more sheltered — there are plenty of
dependably calm coves. In the island sections in this book (Parts III
through VI), I recommend the best local beaches, including the safest for
inexperienced swimmers. When in doubt, ask one of the staff at your
hotel or call the local tourist office for recommendations — and watch
for warning flags and posted beach conditions at the beach.
A few important words about ocean safety: Never turn your back on the
ocean when you’re at the beach. A big wave can come out of nowhere
before you can say “aloha.” Always watch the surf, even if you’re just
taking a casual stroll along the shoreline. Also, ocean conditions can
change dramatically in a matter of hours — surf that was safe for swim-
ming one day can develop a dangerous undertow the next. Get out of the
water when the big swells come.
Avoiding the crowds
Yes, there are times when coming to Hawaii is a bad idea if you’re allergic
to crowds. At the very least, you should know what you’re getting into.
The entire nation of Japan basically shuts down during Golden Week,
which falls annually in late April or early May and encompasses three
Japanese holidays. Japanese tourism to Hawaii has generally slipped in
the last five years or so, but you’d never know it during Golden Week —
especially in Waikiki, the favored destination among Japanese travelers.
Be sure to book hotels, interisland air reservations, and car rentals well
in advance.
The Big Island’s Kona-Kohala coast fills up during Ironman week (which
leads up to the Sat closest to the full moon in Oct). Hotels book to
capacity, rental cars sell out, and you pay top dollar for everything.
People flock to Hilo during the Merrie Monarch Hula Festival, the week
after Easter; plan well in advance if you’re coming for these events.
On Maui, Halloween in Lahaina is a major event; up to 20,000 people
come for the festivities. Booking your Lahaina hotel room a year or more
in advance isn’t too early. You shouldn’t have a problem elsewhere on
the island, though.
Additionally, more than 30,000 runners descend on Oahu for the week
before the Honolulu Marathon (usually the second Sun in Dec).
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

And keep in mind that the islands are at maximum capacity during the
Christmas holidays; spring break and Easter week can also be crowded.
Stay at home during these seasons if you don’t want to fight crowds or
pay premium prices.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Here’s a rundown of the top events that take place annually throughout
the Hawaiian Islands. This list is merely a drop in the bucket, of course;
for a complete rundown, as well as the latest event information, visit
www.calendar.gohawaii.com. For details on the events on a given
island, your best bet is to contact the local visitors bureau directly. See
the Quick Concierge at the back of this book for contact information.
Many of the following events absolutely require significant planning
before you leave home. Calling ahead before any event is always best
because tickets may be required, details may have changed, and so on.
 January and February: ’Tis the season for world-championship golf
in paradise. The season kicks off with the first PGA event of the year,
the Mercedes Championships at Maui’s Kapalua Resort (% 877-
527-2582; www.kapalua.com/hawaii-golf/pga-tournament), 
followed almost immediately by the Sony Open at Oahu’s Waialae
Country Club (% 808-734-2151; www.sonyopeninhawaii.com). On
the senior tour, there’s the MasterCard Championship at the Big
Island’s Four Seasons Hualalai (% 800-417-2770), and the Wendy’s
Champions Skins Game at either Kaanapali or Wailea, Maui,
depending on the year and the deal struck. Expect top-ranked talent
at every event. Check www.pgatour.com for complete details on
each event, including how to purchase tickets.
 January through April: These months are Hawaii’s prime whale-
watching season, when humpback whales — the world’s largest
mammals — make their way from frigid Alaska to the balmy waters
of Hawaii. Because whales prefer water depths of less than 600 feet,
these endangered gentle giants come in relatively close to shore.
You can see them regularly from the beach in prime season. They
often prefer the west, or leeward, sides of the islands.
Maui is particularly terrific for whale-watching because the giants
love to frolic in the channel separating the Valley Isle from Molokai
and Lanai. The best onshore vantage is West Maui’s MacGregor
Point, a large pullout on the ocean side of Highway 30, halfway
between Maalaea and Lanai. The nonprofit Pacific Whale
Foundation operates a Whale Information Station there that’s
staffed by friendly naturalists daily (Dec–Apr). Just stop by — they
even have high-powered binoculars you can use — or call % 800-
942-5311 or 808-249-8811 for more details.

If you happen to be in the islands during whale season, you won’t
want to miss seeing these remarkable behemoths. For the best
views, take a whale-watching cruise. These are offered from each
island; I recommend the best ones in Chapters 11, 13, 15, and 17.

on the Big Island for a full week in spring (usually the week following
Easter Sun). The islands’ largest and most prestigious hula festival
features four nights of modern and ancient dance in honor of King
David Kalakaua, the “merrie monarch” who revived the dance,
which had been all but forgotten with the coming of Western ways
to the islands. Tickets go on sale at the end of December and sell

Friday in August; all state-related facilities are closed.
 Mid-September: Running exactly 26.2 miles from Kahului to
Kaanapali, the Maui Marathon is regularly named one of the ten
most scenic marathons in North America. A half-marathon and a 5K

September 19, 2010 (the marathon’s 40th anniversary). Visit
www.mauimarathon.com for entry details.
 Mid-September: ’Tis the season in Hawaii for statewide Aloha
Festivals. Each week from mid-September through October is Aloha
Week on a different island, with events running the gamut from
parades and royal balls to ethnic days and street festivals. This is
serious celebration time. My favorite is always Waikiki’s street
party, usually the first on the annual calendar. Most events are free

games, exhibits, and entertainment — all with an island twist. Call
% 808-242-2721 or visit www.mauicountyfair.com for info.
 Mid-October: The world’s finest athletes converge on the Big
Island’s Kona-Kohala coast every October to run (26.2 miles), swim
(2.4 miles), and bike (112 miles) in one of the most prestigious
events in all of sports, the punishing Ironman Triathlon World
Championship. I’m not necessarily suggesting that you join in; par-
ticipate instead by cheering on the contestants along the route.
The best place to see the 7 a.m. start is along the seawall on Alii
Drive in Kailua-Kona; get there before 5:30 a.m. for a prime spot. Alii
Drive is also the best vantage for watching the bike and run por-
tions; park on a side street and walk down to Alii because it’s
closed to traffic. To watch the finishers come in, line up along Alii
Drive from Holualoa Street to the finish at Palani Road and Alii
Drive; the winner can come as early as 2:30 p.m., and the course
closes at midnight. The Ironman is usually held on the Saturday
nearest the full moon; call % 808-329-0063 or visit
www.ironman.com/worldchampionship for this year’s date and
details. If you’re not interested, you may want to avoid the Kona-
Kohala coast while Ironman is in swing.
 Mid-October: The only statewide film festival in the United States,
the Louis Vuitton Hawaii International Film Festival specializes in
films from Asia, the Pacific Islands, and North America. Most
screenings and related events take place on Oahu, but the final
weekend finds events on all the islands. Call % 808-528-3456 or
visit www.hiff.org for more information.
 October 31: Some 30,000 people show up to celebrate Halloween
in Lahaina, Maui, an event so festive and popular that some call it
the “Mardi Gras of the Pacific.” Front Street is closed off from 3 p.m.
to midnight for the costumed revelers and accompanying festivi-
ties; a children’s parade launches the day. The Great Halloween
Costume Contest takes place in Banyan Tree Park at 7 p.m. Lahaina
is so gung-ho on Halloween, in fact, that the party starts the week
prior to October 31 with haunted houses and myriad events about
town. Call % 888-310-1117 or 808-667-9175 or visit www.visit
lahaina.com for this year’s program of events.

or December; the wave action determines the schedules. Call 
% 808-596-SURF [7873] or visit www.triplecrownofsurfing.com
for the latest information on these and other surfing events
throughout the islands, including the Roxy Pro Hawaii, the O’Neill
World Cup of Surfing, and the Quicksilver Big Wave Invitational
in Memory of Eddie Aikau (Dec–Feb), which only runs once wave
faces reach a minimum of 40 feet — wow!
 Mid-December: More than 25,000 runners converge for the
Honolulu Marathon, one of the largest marathons in the world —
and definitely one of its most scenic. Whether you’re a potential
participant or merely a spectator, call % 808-734-7200 or go to
www.honolulumarathon.com for all the details. If you’re not
coming to Honolulu specifically to run in or watch the marathon,
you may want to avoid Oahu entirely while it’s on — hotels are
booked to capacity, and the island is overrun with out-of-towners.
 Throughout December: It’s a holly, jolly Christmas, island-style.
The mayor of Honolulu says “Mele Kalikimaka” by throwing the
switch to light up the 40-foot-tall Norfolk pine and other trees in
front of Honolulu Hale, followed by the Electric Light Parade. On
Maui, Santa arrives for the annual lighting of Lahaina’s historic
banyan tree, followed by Christmas caroling in Hawaiian. Schedules
vary, so call % 808-524-0722 for Oahu events, or 800-525-6284 or
888-310-1117 for Maui events. Every island is bedecked in holiday
finery throughout the month.

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Thinking about your major expenses
 Using AAA and American Express memberships to your advantage
 Zeroing in on cost-cutting tips
“S
o, how much is this trip to Hawaii going to cost me, anyway?”
It’s a reasonable question, no matter what your income. A vacation is
always a big-ticket endeavor, with costs that can add up before you
know it — and, as destinations go, Hawaii is a relatively pricey one. So
you’ll want to plan ahead to keep your budget on track. In this chapter, I
tell you what to expect and offer tips that can save you big bucks on
major expenses.
Planning Your Budget
The good news is that you can easily structure a Hawaii trip to suit any
budget. Airfare and hotels will probably end up being your largest cash
outlays. Other things, like rental cars, are relatively affordable on most
of the Hawaiian islands.
Your choice of activities also determines how much you spend: Relaxing
on the beach or taking in Hawaii’s natural beauty generally doesn’t cost
a dime. But guided tours and organized activities — like snorkel trips,
helicopter rides, and luau — can carry surprisingly hefty price tags (see
Table 4-1).
Transportation
The cost of your flight to Hawaii will be one of your top two expenses
(right up there with hotels). Airfares are almost impossible to predict
and can change at the drop of a hat, especially as oil prices continue to
rise. Still, here’s a rough idea of what to expect: If you’re going to Hawaii
in the off season — say, May or maybe October — you may be able to
snag a round-trip ticket for as little as $500 from San Francisco or Los
Angeles or $800 to $900 from the East Coast. If you’re traveling in the
high season (late Dec to Apr, or in summer), you’ll pay more — probably

in the $500 to $800 range from the West Coast and between $700 and
$1,400 from back east.
Expect to pay more if you’re departing from a city that’s not a major air-
line hub. If you’re traveling to Hawaii over the Christmas holidays,
expect to pay full fare.
You can score any number of money-saving deals, especially if you con-
sider an all-inclusive package. (See Chapter 5 for more details on travel
packages. I also tell you how to save on airfares in that chapter.)
Interisland flights
If you plan to visit more than one island at any time during your stay,
you’ll need to take an interisland flight. Fares for one-way trips between
the islands, which are run through Hawaiian Airlines and recent market
entry go! Airlines, average about $160 in the high season. But there’s
good news: You may not need to pay full fare. Numerous sales and spe-
cial Internet-only fares are frequently available; one-way fares were avail-
able for around $109 at press time, and went as low as $53 per flight in
the last off season. See Chapter 6 for details.
Car rentals
Rental cars are relatively affordable in the islands, especially if you’re
not traveling in the holiday season. Weekly rates almost always save you
a bundle. You can often get a compact for as little as $35 to $45 a day,
sometimes even less if you book a weekly rental. If you need a family-
size car, expect to pay more on the order of $45 to $65 per day, depend-
ing on where you’re staying and the time of year you’re booking. Of
course, everybody wants a convertible in the islands, so expect to pay
upwards of $75 or more a day in season for one, although you could
score a weekly rental for as little as $400, if the stars align. You can
sometimes wheel and deal for one at the rental counter in the low
season, when business is slower.
Do yourself a favor and book a rental car with unlimited mileage. You’ll be
doing plenty of driving no matter which island you’re on, and you don’t
want to end up paying for your rental on a per-mile basis. Trust me —
you’ll end up on the short end of this stick. Most of the major car-rental
companies rent on an unlimited-miles basis, but be sure to confirm this
policy when you book.
And because you’ll probably cover a good deal of ground, don’t forget to
factor in gas, which is typically more expensive in Hawaii than on the
mainland, and even higher on the neighbor islands than it is on Oahu. At
press time, the gap between mainland and Hawaii prices was about 40
cents per gallon, but Hawaii prices have been known to be as much as a
dollar more per gallon.
Also remember to account for any additional insurance costs, which
generally run an extra $15 to $25 a day, depending on the coverage you
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
46

select. Parking, thankfully, is generally free, although most Waikiki hotels
and many luxury resort hotels throughout the islands charge a daily fee
for parking; be sure to check when you book.
You’ll seldom save by waiting to rent your car; generally, prices only 
go up as your pickup date approaches — especially in the busy travel
seasons. Book as far in advance as possible for the best rate. Also see
“Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun,” later in this chapter, for additional
money-saving tips.
You may not have to worry about shopping around or wangling a lower
rate on a car rental. Often, rental cars and interisland flights are part and
parcel of a package deal. In many hotel and airline packages, they’re
thrown in for a nominal fee or for free. See Chapter 6 for more details.
Lodging
Hawaii has a wealth of luxury hotels and resorts, but it also offers plenty
of affordable choices — especially on the condo market. Still, although
you can find decent hotel rooms or budget condo rentals for $125 or so
a night, you really shouldn’t expect to pay much less than that. After you
start adding on amenities — kitchenettes, room service, ocean views —
expect room rates to climb from there.
The good news is that you can score reasonable rates on a per-person
basis if you’re traveling in a group or with your family. Hawaii boasts lots
of apartment-style condos that sleep four or more at moderate prices —
between $125 and $225 per night on the bottom end, and $250 or more
for more luxurious digs. Of course, if you stay at a condo, you’ll likely
miss out on resort-style amenities and services — concierge, room serv-
ice, kids’ programs, and the like. But it may be worth it to you if you
want to have more room to spread out, enjoy the convenience of having
a kitchen, and keep costs down, because dining is quite expensive in
Hawaii — especially once you start feeding a family.
I’ve taken care to recommend a range of lodging choices on each island
to give you plenty of choices, no matter what your needs or budget. And
remember: Although I’ve listed standard “rack rates” for every hotel,
these tend to be the maximum. You rarely have to pay full price — and
you can find numerous ways to save. (For one thing, booking a package
deal can be a huge money saver when it comes to hotels; for more infor-
mation on packages, see Chapter 5.) For additional cost-cutting meas-
ures, see “Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun,” later in this chapter.
Be sure to budget for the 11.42 percent in taxes that will be added to
your final hotel bill.
Dining
Hawaii has become something of a culinary mecca. Each island boasts
its own slate of top-quality restaurants — often charging top-dollar
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47

prices. So think about your bottom line. Many of you, no doubt, look for-
ward to sampling the finest restaurants and won’t mind paying for the
privilege. But if you’d rather spend your vacation dollars on other activi-
ties, the islands offer plenty of opportunities to dine on the cheap: You
can spend as little as $5 to $10 for breakfast (a continental breakfast may
even be included in your hotel deal), grab a quick-and-easy lunch for $10
to $15, and enjoy a casual dinner for $15 to $30. Still, thanks to the high
cost of transpacific transport, island real estate, and labor, you’re likely to
pay more for even casual food here than you do at home. And, of course,
extra niceties like wine or cocktails will drive up dinner costs quickly.
Restaurant bills can add up fast, so if you want to save in this category, I
strongly suggest booking a room or condo with kitchen facilities. By
preparing a few daytime meals yourself (breakfast, in particular, can be a
big money saver, and it’s often convenient to pack sandwiches to take to
the beach), you’ll be in a better position to splurge on a great dinner.
Kitchen facilities are a virtual must if you’re traveling with kids.
Sightseeing and activities
Here’s where the bills can really start to pile up, especially if you’re trav-
eling with the family — but it ultimately depends on what you want to
do. If you’re coming to Hawaii to simply kick back on the sands, you
won’t have to budget much in this category. Going to the beach is free,
and even snorkel gear rentals are cheap.
But if you’re planning to schedule some organized activities and 
tours — which I strongly suggest you do, especially if it’s your first visit
to Hawaii — plan ahead to see what your budget can handle because
they can get surprisingly pricey. Expect to pay $70 to $95 per person for
your average snorkel cruise, and even more for your average luau. The
best helicopter rides can easily run more than $175 a head. Budget-
minded golfers may want to think twice before they tee up — fees com-
monly run close to $200. (However, wallet watchers can often take
advantage of twilight rates, which generally hover around $100.)
This book lists exact prices for activities, entertainment, tee times,
admission fees, and the like in the following chapters so that you can
budget your money realistically. If there’s a way to snag a bargain, I
include that information too.
Shopping and nightlife
These two areas are the most flexible parts of your budget. Shopping is a
huge temptation in Hawaii. But if money is an issue, do yourself a favor
and bypass the souvenirs.
Oahu and Maui are the liveliest destinations in terms of after-dark diver-
sions, but in general, the islands aren’t overloaded with nightlife options.
You can easily avoid racking up the bills in these categories if shopping
and/or evening entertainment isn’t a high priority for you.

A Note on Taxes: Hawaii does not have a sales tax, per se. However, the
state charges businesses an excise tax on revenue. Therefore, most
restaurants and shops pass this on to the consumer as a tax of roughly 
4 percent. The percentage may vary slightly depending on the county
you’re in, and may be embedded in the total purchase price or shown as
an independent line item on your bill. Taxes of 11.42 percent are added
to hotel bills.
Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
I don’t care how much money you have — nobody wants to spend more
than they have to. In this section, I give you some tips on how to avoid
spending more of your hard-earned cash than is necessary.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49

Getting the best airfares
Getting the best fares on both transpacific and interisland air travel is
such a huge topic that I’ve dedicated the better part of a chapter to it.
Before you even start scanning for fares, see Chapter 5. That chapter
also discusses how to find money-saving package deals.
Getting a break on your room rate
There’s often a huge gap between hotels’ official “published” rates (also
called full-price, or rack rates) and what you actually pay, so don’t be
scared off at first glance. What’s more, savvy travelers can find ways to
further widen the margin.
More often than not, the best way to score a cheap hotel room is to buy
an all-inclusive travel package that includes airfare, hotel, and car, and
sometimes other extras, in one low price; for details on scoring a good-
value package, see Chapter 5.
The second-best way to avoid paying the full rack rate when booking
your hotel is stunningly simple: Just ask the reservation agent for a
cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised — I have
been, many times. But you have to take the initiative and ask because no
one is going to volunteer to save you money.
Here are a few more potentially money-saving tips:
 Rates are generally lowest in spring and fall. The time of year you
plan to visit may affect your bargaining power more than anything
else. During the peak seasons — basically mid-December through
mid-April and summer — when a hotel is booked up, management is
less likely to offer discounts. In the slower seasons — generally mid-
April through mid-June and September through mid-December —
when capacity is down, they’re often willing to negotiate; in fact,
many places drop rates by 10 to 30 percent automatically in the less
busy times of year. If you haven’t decided when you want to visit
Hawaii yet, see Chapter 3.
 Membership in AAA, AARP, or frequent flier/traveler programs
often qualifies you for discounted rates. (For details on joining
AAA, see “The AAA advantage” sidebar, later in this chapter.) You
may also qualify for corporate or student discounts. Attention, sen-
iors: You may qualify for discounts even if you’re not an AARP
member (although I highly recommend joining; see Chapter 8 for
details). Members of the military or those with government jobs
may also qualify for price breaks.
 Inquire about the hotel’s own package deals. Even if you’re not
traveling on an all-inclusive package (see Chapter 5), you may be
able to take advantage of packages offered by hotels, resorts, and
condos directly. They often include such value-added extras as a free
rental car, champagne and in-room breakfast for honeymooners, free
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
50

dinners, discounted tee times or spa treatments, a room upgrade, an
extra night thrown in free (sometimes the fifth, sometimes the sev-
enth), or some other freebie. I note what kinds of discounts are typi-
cally available in my hotel reviews. Properties usually list these deals
on their Web sites, but not always, so it never hurts to ask additional
questions about available specials.
 If you’re booking a hotel that belongs to a chain, call the hotel
directly in addition to going through central reservations. See
which one gives you the better deal. Sometimes, the local reserva-
tionist knows about packages or special rates, but the hotel may
neglect to tell the central booking line.
 Surf the Web to save. A surprising number of hotels advertise
great packages via their Web sites, and some even offer Internet-
only special rates.
In addition to surfing the hotel’s own sites, you may want to try using
a general travel booking site like Expedia.com, Travelocity.com,
Hotels.com, or Orbitz.com to book your hotel or a pay-one-price
package that also includes airfare. Acting much like airline consolida-
tors, these sites can sometimes offer big discounts on rooms as well.
See Chapter 7 for a more complete discussion of how to use the Web
to find a great hotel bargain.
 Ask innkeepers for a break. Bed-and-breakfasts are generally non-
negotiable on price. Sometimes, however, you can negotiate a dis-
count for longer stays, such as a week or more. You may also be
able to score a price break if you’re visiting off season. And some
do offer AAA and senior discounts. Remember that it never hurts 
to ask, politely.
 Look for price breaks and value-added extras when booking
condos. Condos are usually pretty flexible on rates. They tend to
offer discounts on multinight stays, and many throw in a free rental
car to sweeten the deal. Some condo properties have units handled
by multiple management companies; if that’s the case, call both
companies and see which one offers you the better deal. You may
also want to check with Hawaii Condo Exchange (% 800-442-0404
or 323-436-0300; www.hawaiicondoexchange.com), which acts as a
consolidator for condo properties throughout the islands.
Cutting other costs
Here are a few more useful money-saving tips:
 Consult a reliable travel agent. A travel agent can sometimes nego-
tiate a better price with certain hotels and assemble a better–value
travel package than you can get on your own. In fact, in a recent
Condé Nast Traveler investigation, travel agents could always price
out Hawaii resort vacations more cheaply than any other outlet
(including airline packagers). Even if you book your own airfare, you
may want to contact a travel agent to price out your hotel.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 51

On the other hand, hotels, condos, and even B&Bs are sometimes
willing to discount your rate as much as 30 percent — the amount
they’d otherwise pay an agent in commissions — if you book
direct.
So it may make sense to base your decision about using a travel
agent on time rather than money — think of a travel agent as a 
convenience. If you do use a travel agent, it makes sense to be an
informed consumer, going into the process with a general idea of
what things cost so that you know whether you’re getting a bar-
gain. A good first step is consulting this book so that you know
which hotels appeal to you and their approximate costs.
And don’t let an agent steer you to a hotel that’s not right for you
just because he or she may be getting a better commission. If you
sense that your agent isn’t working hard to line up a trip that really
suits your desires, move on and find someone else.
 Surf the Web to save on your rental car too. In addition to surfing
rental-car agencies’ own sites, you might try comparing rates through
a general travel booking site like Expedia.com, Travelocity.com,
Orbitz.com, Kayak.com, or Priceline.com. This one-stop-shopping
method can save you more than money — it can save you time too.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and 
you save on gas to boot (an especially important point, because
gas prices are always higher in Hawaii than on the mainland).
Unless you’re traveling with a large group, don’t go beyond the
economy size.
See Chapter 6 for more money-saving tips to keep in mind while
booking your island wheels.
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchenette, or a condo with a full
kitchen, and do your own cooking. You may miss the pampering
that room service provides, but you can save lots of money,
because restaurant prices are high in Hawaii even for casual eats.
Even if you prepare only breakfast and an occasional picnic lunch
in the kitchen, you’ll save significantly in the long run. Plus, if the
beach is right outside your door, you won’t ever have to leave it to
go on restaurant runs.
 Skip the ocean views, or stay away from the ocean altogether.
Being steps away from the surf is wonderful, but you’ll pay through
the nose for the privilege: Oceanview rooms are the most expen-
sive rooms in any hotel, especially those on the upper floors.
Mountain or garden views are usually much cheaper — and they
make sense if you don’t plan on hanging out in your room much,
anyway. A stay in a hotel that’s located a few blocks from the
beach, especially in Waikiki, can be even cheaper. For more on this
subject, see Chapter 7.
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
52

 Ask whether the kids can stay in your room. Or, better yet, book a
condo with a sleeper sofa in the living room or a separate bedroom.
A room with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than
one with a king-size bed, and most hotels don’t charge an extra-
person rate if the additional person is a kid.
If that’s a bit too much togetherness for you, book one of the many
one-, two-, or three-bedroom condos that are available throughout
the islands. These full apartments are often no more expensive
than your standard hotel room — and they’re always cheaper than
having to book two or more hotel rooms. What’s more, they solve
the expensive eating-out-at-every-meal problem, too.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 53
The AAA advantage
If you aren’t already a member, consider taking a few minutes to join the American
Automobile Association (AAA) before heading to Hawaii. In addition to providing you
with a wealth of trip-planning services, membership can save you big bucks on hotel
rates, car rentals, interisland airfares, and even admission to attractions in Hawaii.
The AAA Travel Agency can help you book air, hotel, and car arrangements as well
as all-inclusive tour packages to Hawaii. Membership in AAA can also qualify you for
hotel discounts of 10 percent or more. Discounts and benefits at 3,000 attractions and
restaurants and 44,000 retail locations nationwide are available through AAA’s Show
Your Card and Save program. And don’t forget the free maps — they’re comprehen-
sive, indispensable, and absolutely free to members.
Whether it’s a discount at an Outrigger hotel or a stress-relieving flat-tire fix, mem-
bership will pay itself back before you know it. Annual membership fees vary slightly
depending on your home region, but you can expect to spend around $45 per individ-
ual (primary member) and $23 to $26 for each additional family member. There is also
a one-time $20 enrollment fee, which covers all who join in the family. Note that costs
to join vary depending on the home state or region where you join.
To find the AAA office nearest you, look in the phone book under “AAA” or log on to
www.aaa.com, where you can link up to your regional club’s home page after you
enter your home zip code. You can even get instant membership by calling the national
24-hour emergency roadside service number (% 800-AAA-HELP), which can connect
you to any regional membership department during expanded business hours (only
roadside assistance operates 24 hours a day). If you’re a resident of Canada, similar
services (plus reciprocal benefits with AAA) are offered by the Canadian Automobile
Association (www.caa.ca).
After you arrive in Hawaii, the local office is in Honolulu at 1130 Nimitz Hwy., Ste. A-
170 (% 800-736-2886 or 808-593-2221; www.aaa-hawaii.com). The office is open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Roadside assistance is available on Oahu, Maui, the Big Island, and Kauai.

 Remember that it doesn’t take much luxury to make Hawaii feel
like paradise. To find true Hawaii happiness, the rule is always
this: The simpler, the better. You don’t need a 27-inch TV, 24-hour
butler service, or a telephone in the bathroom to be happy here. So
when reserving your accommodations, don’t overdo it by booking
a place that taxes your budget too much. Save that extra dough for
having fun!
 Skip the souvenirs. I’ve heard it more than once: “That whale print
that looked so right in the art gallery was all wrong back in my
living room in Cincinnati.” Spend your money on memories, not
tchotchkes.
 Look out for the Bargain Alert icon as you read this book. This
icon alerts you to money-saving opportunities and especially good
values as you travel throughout Hawaii.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do, and you may
let your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). The MasterCard, Maestro, or Cirrus
(% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) networks and Visa PLUS
(% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) network span the globe; look at the
back of your bank card to see which network you’re on and then call or
check online for ATM locations at your destination. Make sure that you
know your personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home
and find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart.
Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is
used at a different bank’s ATM. On top of this, the bank from which you
withdraw cash may charge its own fee. (To compare banks’ ATM fees
within the U.S., use www.bankrate.com.) To beat these fees (and to avoid
wasting precious vacation time running errands), it makes sense to with-
draw larger sums rather than relying on lots of smaller withdrawals.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and for foreign visitors, they generally
offer relatively good exchange rates.
Part I: Introducing Hawaii 
54

You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit cards at banks or
ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t
even know you had one, call the number on the back of your credit card
and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business
days, though some banks will provide the number over the phone if you
tell them your mother’s maiden name or some other personal informa-
tion. But keep in mind that cash advances are a bad idea, only to be
used in case of emergency. Your issuing bank will start charging interest
from the day you make the withdrawal, usually at significantly higher
rates than you’re charged on regular purchases.
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip so that they don’t become suspicious when the card is
used numerous times in a new destination and block your charges. Even
if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you can always
call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is refused —
another good reason to carry the phone number with you.
It’s a good idea to carry more than one card with you on your trip; a
card might not work for any number of reasons, so having a backup is
the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, it’s so easy to find a 24-hour ATM that traveler’s checks are
becoming obsolete. Furthermore, the popularity of credit cards means
that businesses are less and less interested in accepting them. Still, if
you like the security of traveler’s checks, and you don’t mind locating a
bank and/or showing identification every time you want to cash one,
you may prefer to stick with the tried-and-true.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent (which
negates any money you might have saved by avoiding ATM fees while
you’re on the road). You can also get American Express traveler’s checks
over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum
cardholders who use this number are exempt from the fee. Traveler’s
checks can also be ordered online at www.americanexpress.com.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 per-
cent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000.
Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain Visa
checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-3378.
MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for a
location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, keep a record of their serial
numbers separate from your checks in the event that they’re stolen or
lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 55

Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover that your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the
nearest police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may
require a police report number or record of the loss. Most credit card
companies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following
emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express: % 800-268-9824 or 800-528-4800 (for cardhold-
ers) and % 800-221-7282 (for traveler’s check holders)
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309 or 800-627-8372
 Visa: % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-
555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-685-1111; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com).
Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline and explain
the situation; you may be allowed to board the plane if you have a copy
of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police report
you’ve filed.

G
etting there may not really be half the fun, but it’s a necessary 
step — and a big part of the planning process. How can you beat
the high cost of transpacific airfares? Should you reserve a package deal
or book the elements of your vacation separately?
In this chapter, I give you all the information you need to make the deci-
sion that’s right for you.
Flying to Hawaii
These days, nearly as many transpacific flights arrive at Maui’s Kahului
Airport as arrive at Oahu’s Honolulu International Airport. Flights direct
from the mainland now land on a daily basis on the Big Island and Kauai
as well, which allows you to fly directly to and from the islands you want
to visit with a minimum of hassle.
The following major airlines fly between mainland North America and
one or more of Hawaii’s major airports:
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.com).
 Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com).
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com).
 Continental Airlines (% 800-523-3273; www.continental.com),
which offers nonstop flights from New York (actually Newark) to
Honolulu, among many other options.
 Delta Airlines (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com).
 Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com),
which offers interisland flights in addition to transpacific service
from the mainland and other international destinations.

 Northwest Airlines (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com), which has a
codesharing agreement with Hawaiian Airlines for interisland flights.
 United Airlines (% 800-864-8331; www.united.com).
 US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com).
 WestJet (% 888-937-8538; www.westjet.com), which offers direct
flights from Vancouver, Canada.
These days, an increasing number of airlines are charging all travelers
except their elite customers an additional $25 per bag to check more
than one piece of luggage per traveler. At this writing, United Airlines
and US Airways had instituted this policy, and American Airlines has
started charging $15 for every bag checked, even the first. I expect other
carriers to follow suit. Therefore, I recommend contacting your airline
and figuring out their checked baggage policy in advance so you can pre-
pare accordingly.
No matter where you’re coming from, it’s bound to be a long haul to
Hawaii. SeatGuru (www.seatguru.com) can help you choose the best
seat available. The Web site features cabin diagrams for just about every
carrier, with individual seat ratings, details on ergonomics, entertain-
ment options, power outlet accessibility, and more.
Getting the best airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product, yet prices can
vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need to purchase their tickets at the last minute,
might change their itinerary at a moment’s notice, or want to get home
before the weekend pay the premium rate, known as the full fare.
Passengers whose travel agendas are more flexible — who can book
their tickets far in advance, who don’t mind staying Saturday night, or
who are willing to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday — pay
the least, usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights to Hawaii,
even the shortest hops, the full fare is more than $1,000, but you might
be able to score an advance-purchase ticket from the West Coast for as
low as $400. Obviously, I can’t guarantee what the fares will be when you
book — especially as oil prices continue to reach record highs and com-
petition tightened after two transpacific carriers (Aloha Airlines and
ATA) folded their wings for good in early 2008 — but you can almost
always save big by planning ahead.
Keep your eye out in the newspaper, on the Internet, and on TV for air-
fare sales. Sale fares carry advance-purchase requirements and date-of-
travel restrictions, but the price is usually worth the restrictions. The
sales tend to take place in seasons of lower travel volume (usually
spring and fall). You’ll almost never see a sale around the peak summer
vacation months or in the winter high season.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
60

Here are a few tips that can help you save on airfares:
 Travel on off days of the week. Airfares vary depending on the 
day of the week. Everybody wants to travel on the weekend; if you
can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, you may find
cheaper flights to Hawaii. When you inquire about airfares, check
to see whether you can get a cheaper rate by flying on a different
day. Remember, too, that staying over on a Saturday night may cut
your airfare.
 Reserve your flight well in advance. Take advantage of advance-
purchase fares. Sometimes you can snag a last-minute bargain, but 
I wouldn’t count on it. Airfares only get higher as the planes fill up.
More often than not, the farther ahead you book, the lower your
airfare is likely to be.
 Fly direct to the island of your choice to save on interisland air-
fares. The Big Island, Maui, and Kauai all receive direct flights from
the mainland. (See the list of carriers in the section “Flying to
Hawaii,” earlier in this chapter.) While it all depends on the transpa-
cific carrier you choose and your origination point, it’s increasingly
easy to fly across the Pacific Ocean to or from the neighbor island
of your choice, and doing so can save you a few hours, not to men-
tion the additional cost of an interisland flight (see Chapter 6).
 Book online. In an effort to encourage you to book on their Web
sites, most of the major air carriers will charge you a fee — any-
where from $5 to $20 per ticket — to buy your tickets over the
phone or in person at ticket offices. Therefore, booking your ticket
online at the airline’s Web site is usually going to be the cheapest
way to buy direct.
Booking your flight online
The big one-stop online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com), and Yahoo Travel (www.travel.yahoo.
com) are excellent sources for one-stop price comparing across all of the
major airlines. (Canadian travelers should try www.expedia.ca and
www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents can go for expedia.co.uk,
www.travelocity.co.uk, and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also send
you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your
favorite destination. All of these online travel agencies also purport to
save you money with pay-one-price packaging, although I suggest compar-
ing the prices of each piece before you assume that you’re saving.
Kayak.com (www.kayak.com) is also gaining popularity and uses a
sophisticated search engine developed at MIT to search probably the
widest breadth of online resources available to find the best available
fare. Kayak is a search engine, not an online travel agency, so once you
Chapter 5: Getting to Hawaii 61

identify the best fare, they will link you directly to the source to book it.
They also have a “fare alerts” tool that will allow you to track fare prices
through an e-mail notification system. SideStep (www.sidestep.com)
works in a similar fashion, and receives good reviews from users.
Newest on the scene is Farecast (www.farecast.com), an online travel
agency designed to help you buy your tickets with confidence, knowing
that you’re getting the best deal available. Farecast’s airfare prediction
tool tracks whether fares are rising or dropping; based on these predic-
tions, the site will let you know whether to buy now or wait. They’ll also
compare their prices to those available on such sites as Expedia and
Hotwire. With these valuable features, it’s no wonder that Time magazine
named Farecast one of its “50 Coolest Sites.”
Attention, spontaneous travelers: You can sometimes find great last-
minute deals through Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), which
compiles a comprehensive list of bargain-basement fares available from
the airlines and the online agencies looking to fill those final empty seats.
Of course, some of the best fares are available through Priceline
(www.priceline.com), especially if you’re willing to play their “Name
Your Own Price” game in which you “bid” for a rock-bottom price — and
it’s yours if an airline accepts it. You won’t know who the carrier is until
after you buy, and you may have an out-of-the-way connection (or two).
Still, the inconveniences can be minimal compared to the savings. The
mystery airlines are all major, well-known carriers, and the possibility of
being sent from Phoenix to Honolulu via Tampa is remote. Priceline now
offers standard online airfare shopping services as well.
Also remember to check the airlines’ own Web sites. Even if you find a
good fare from one of the services listed above, you can often shave off
a few bucks by booking directly through the airline, which won’t have 
to pay an intermediary for your business. Many airlines have special
Internet-only fares that their phone agents don’t even know about.
Attention UPromise members: Those of you who use this online rewards
service to save for your kids’ college education (or to pay your own 
bills) can earn cash-back rewards (usually 1 to 2 percent of the purchase
price) by booking airfares and other travel reservations via Expedia,
Travelocity, and a wealth of other travel partners when accessed through
the UPromise portal (www.upromise.com). If you’re not a member but
there’s someone in your life paying for college, visit the site to sign up.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, can be a good place to find
low fares, sometimes below even the airlines’ discounted rates. Basically,
these companies are just big travel agents that get discounts for buying
in bulk and pass some of the savings on to you. These days, however, it’s
a rare day to get a fare through a consolidator that you can’t get through
mainstream sources like Expedia — or even the airlines themselves — so
be sure to price compare. Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable
or rigged with stiff cancellation penalties, and some put you on charter
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii

airlines you’ve never heard of — so be sure you know all of the ins and
outs before you buy.
Some of the most reliable consolidators include the following:
 Cheap Tickets (% 800-504-3249; www.cheaptickets.com). I 
usually do better by calling than I do by pricing out fares on its 
Web site.
 STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s
leader in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages.
Joining an Escorted Tour
Hawaii is such a foolproof place to visit — and its magic is so dependent
on relaxing leisure time — that I strongly recommend traveling on your
own. If you really prefer to be led around, however, or if you’re not able
to drive yourself, you may want to consider an escorted tour.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, buying travel insurance is a
good idea, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay upfront (most
do). But don’t buy your coverage from the tour operator! If the tour
operator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation
you paid for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obli-
gations either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (See
Chapter 9 for the details on travel insurance.)
Always ask a few simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? What if the
operator cancels?
 How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour schedule give you
ample time to relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m.
every day and not returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds
like a grind, certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra.
 How much flexibility do you have? Can you opt out of certain
activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with no exceptions?
Are all your meals planned in advance?
The escorted trips offered by Tauck Tours (% 800-788-7885; www.
tauck.com) are far more luxurious and less structured than your 
Chapter 5: Getting to Hawaii 63

average escorted tour; they’re pricey, but worth it if you’d rather put
someone else in charge of the itinerary. If you’re looking for more afford-
able options, try sister companies Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.
globusjourneys.com) and Cosmos (% 800-276-1241; www.cosmos
vacations.com). Globus offers more luxurious vacations, including a
combination cruise/tour option, whereas Cosmos is more bargain ori-
ented. Both are excellent companies. Perillo Tours (% 800-431-1515;
www.perillotours.com) also offers midpriced multi-island tours.
Cruising to Hawaii
Cruising to and around Hawaii isn’t my favorite way to explore and enjoy
the islands, but many cruise fans disagree. If you’re interested in the
cruising options, check with Carnival (% 800-CARNIVAL [227-6482];
www.carnival.com); Celebrity Cruises (% 877-202-4345; www.
celebritycruises.com); Royal Caribbean (% 866-562-7625; www.
royalcaribbean.com); Norwegian Cruise Line (% 866-234-7350;
www.ncl.com); Princess Cruises (% 800-PRINCESS [774-6237]; www.
princess.com); and Holland America Line (% 877-932-4259; www.
hollandamerica.com). All offer cruises to the Hawaiian Islands.
Choosing a Pay-One-Price Package
Comprehensive, pay-one-price travel packages can be a smart way to go
when booking your Hawaii vacation. Besides the convenience of having
all your travel needs taken care of at once, a package can often save you
lots of money. In many cases, a package that includes airfare, hotel, and
transportation to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone if
you book it yourself.
One reason for this savings is that components of the packages are sold
in bulk to tour operators, travel agents, and resellers, who bundle and
sell them to the public. Even after the packager takes its cut, you may
still realize substantial savings.
Package trips can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book
flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters.
Every destination, including Hawaii, usually has a few packagers that are
better than the rest because they buy in even bigger bulk. The time you
spend shopping around is likely to be well rewarded.
Finding a package deal
The Internet is probably your best source for package deals. Check out
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Yahoo Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com), Hotwire (www.hotwire.com),
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
64

and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), which have become some of the most
sophisticated and easy-to-access pay-one-price packagers in the market.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is 
one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast. Liberty frequently offers
excellent-value packages, with or without air, to all the Hawaiian islands
— and its agents are willing to help you construct a multi-island trip.
Calling the toll-free number immediately connects you to the Liberty
Travel store nearest your home.
Pleasant Holidays (% 800-742-9244; www.pleasantholidays.com),
the biggest and most comprehensive packager to Hawaii, has more than
40 years of experience and offers tons of package options. Pleasant can
arrange just about any kind of vacation you want, including fly/drive
packages and land-only deals. And because it buys airfares and hotel-
room blocks in such bulk, its deals are often excellent (although it offers
better bargains on some properties than others). Another plus is that
Pleasant maintains service desks on all the major islands; its employees
can help you book activities and answer any questions you may have.
These guys can even finance your vacation for you — but be sure to
check the interest rates.
If you want to work with a travel agency that specializes in booking
packaged Hawaii vacations, offers a more personalized shopping experi-
ence, books at all price levels, and really knows its stuff, contact Melissa
McCoy’s Maui-based Aloha Destinations Vacations (% 800-256-4280 or
213-784-6143; www.alohadestinations.com).
Be aware that some travel packagers — including Pleasant Hawaiian
Holidays— are likely to book you on their own charter flights rather
than on commercial flights on major airlines. It doesn’t really make a 
difference, unless you have a particular allegiance to a specific airline
(or to collecting miles in a frequent-flier program). Be sure that you
know which airline you’re flying when you book. And if you really do
want to fly with a specific airline, that doesn’t rule out a packager. In
fact, Pleasant has established relationships with such major carriers 
as Delta, United, and Hawaiian — and just about any packager will be
happy to book you a land-only vacation that lets you arrange your own
airfare (even the airline packagers will do this; see the upcoming list).
Uncovering an airline package
Many major airlines also offer travel packages to Hawaii, either directly
or through a trusted package partner. I always recommend comparison
shopping, but you may want to choose the airline that has frequent serv-
ice to your hometown or the one on which you accumulate frequent-flier
miles; you may even be able to pay for your entire package using accu-
mulated miles. The following airlines offer travel packages to Hawaii as
part of their services:

Choosing between a travel agent and a packager isn’t an either/or propo-
sition; in fact, your travel agent can be your best source in sorting
through the various deals that are available. If you’re an AmEx customer,
you may consider going through American Express Travel Service,
which can book a full variety of travel packages for you. To locate the
office (or official travel-agent representative) nearest you, call % 800-
335-3342 or go online to www.americanexpress.com and select
“Travel”; you can also book your vacation completely online, and even
pay with Membership Rewards.
Ditto for members of the American Automobile Association, who have
access to the AAA Travel Agency, which can also book good-value pack-
age deals. Visit www.aaa.com or call % 877-934-6222 to book your
reservations or to find the regional office nearest you.
Weighing your options
With the multitude of packages on the market, you may need some help
weighing the various merits of each one. Follow these tips as you sift
your way through the options:
 Read up on Hawaii. Read through the hotel listings in this book
and select the places that sound interesting. Compare the rates
that I list with the packagers’ prices to gauge which operators are
really offering a good deal and which have simply gussied up the
rack rates to make their full-fare offer sound like a smart buy.
Remember, most packagers can offer bigger savings on some prop-
erties than on others. For example, Liberty Travel may give you a
much better rate on Waikiki’s Royal Hawaiian, say, than Pleasant
Holidays can, but Pleasant may offer you a substantial savings on
the Maui condo that you want.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
66

 Compare apples to apples. When comparing packages, make 
sure that you know exactly what’s included in the quoted price, 
and what’s not. Don’t assume anything: Some packagers include
everything — including value-added extras like lei greetings, free
continental breakfast, and dining discounts — and others don’t
even include airfare. Additionally, when considering package
prices, be sure to factor in add-on costs if you’re flying from some-
where other than Los Angeles or San Francisco — some operators
price packages directly from your hometown, and some require
additional premiums for airfares from your hometown to their Los
Angeles or San Francisco gateway.
 Before you commit to a package, make sure that you know how
much flexibility you have. Some packagers require ironclad com-
mitments, but others charge only minimal fees for changes or can-
cellations. Consider the possibility that your travel plans may
change and select a packager with the degree of flexibility that
suits your needs. And if you pay upfront for a complete vacation
package that carries stiff cancellation penalties, consider buying
travel insurance that will reimburse you in case an unforeseen
emergency prevents you from traveling. (See Chapter 9 for more 
on this topic.)
 Don’t believe in fairy tales. Unfortunately, shady dealers and fly-by-
night operations are out there. If a package appears too good to be
true, it probably is. Any knowledgeable travel agent should be able
to help you determine whether a specific packager is on the level.

Chapter 6
Getting Around Hawaii
In This Chapter
 Traveling from island to island on interisland carriers
 Renting a car — and considering a convertible
T
he island chapters later in this book explain the specifics of navigat-
ing your way around individual islands, but in this chapter I give you
the lowdown on traveling between them and also on how to book and
save money on car rentals — and you’ll almost certainly want to have a
car during your trip.
Flying between the Hawaiian Islands
The primary way to travel from island to island is by airplane.
An interisland high-speed catamaran ferry service called Hawaii
Superferry (% 877-443-3779; www.hawaiisuperferry.com) was intro-
duced in 2007. In theory, the service is a great idea, allowing locals and
visitors alike to ferry between the islands with their cars and luggage.
However, service has been intermittent at best since launching, and was
temporarily suspended at this writing. Even when it resumes, only one
ferry a day each way between Oahu and Maui was slated. For now, until
service can get on a steady track, I recommend sticking with the airlines.
Despite the fact that it’s a short and easy shuttle hop between islands —
even the longest island-to-island flight clocks in around 45 minutes — it’s
vital to book in advance. The airlines request that you show up at least
90 minutes before your flight to allow for security inspections, and I’ve
found that to be good advice.
Three interisland carriers serve the islands: Hawaiian Airlines and go!,
the upstart carrier operated by Mesa Airlines, carry the bulk of travelers
between the islands, while Island Air offers supplemental service, usu-
ally between Hawaii’s smaller airports. (Aloha Airlines filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy and halted all service in early 2008, citing skyrocketing
fuel and predatory pricing by go! as the pressures that forced Aloha’s
hand.) Both Hawaiian and go! offer similar schedules — flights between
the major islands every hour or so — at competitive prices.

Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com) offers
interisland jet service aboard Boeing 717-200s; the entire fleet was
replaced with brand-new aircraft in 2001, making this the youngest fleet
in the Pacific.
Hawaiian is mileage partners with American Airlines, US Airways,
Continental, Delta, Northwest, and Virgin Atlantic airlines, which gives
you plenty of mileage-earning potential. They don’t make it easy to enter
another airline’s frequent flier number online, however, so you may need
to call to get the appropriate credit.
Island Air (% 800-652-6541 or 808-484-2222; www.islandair.com),
operates deHavilland DASH-8 and DASH-6 aircraft and serves Hawaii’s
smaller interisland airports on Maui (Kapalua Airport), Molokai, and
Lanai, as well as both Hilo and Kona on the Big Island. You may find
yourself on a codeshare flight operated by Island Air if you head to
Molokai or Lanai, even if you buy through Hawaiian.
At press time, the full interisland fare was about $109 per one-way seg-
ment, depending on the dates and routes you want to fly. (At this writ-
ing, experts were forecasting price increases in the wake of lightened
competition resulting from Aloha’s disappearance, so don’t be surprised
if you see higher fares.) Booking more than 14 days in advance gives you
the best shot at a bargain fare. I recommend price comparing for the
best deal.
If you’re traveling on a package, you probably don’t have to worry about
any of this — your interisland flights are most likely included in your
package deal, on whichever interisland carrier the packager is affiliated
with. For more on all-inclusive travel packages, see Chapter 5.
Arranging for Rental Cars
In order to maximize your time on each of the islands, you need to rent a
car. The only island where you can go without a car is Oahu, but you’ll
be stuck in Waikiki and will be dependent on public transportation.
Unfortunately, traffic has become an increasing problem on all of the
neighbor islands, especially in the prime resort areas. Throughout this
book I guide you past traffic hot spots whenever possible.
All the big companies — Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz,
National, and Thrifty — rent cars on all the major Hawaiian Islands. See
the Quick Concierge at the back of this book for phone numbers and
Web sites.
Be sure to book your rental cars well ahead. Rental cars are almost
always at a premium on Kauai, Molokai, and Lanai and may be sold out
on all of the neighbor islands on holiday weekends.
Chapter 6: Getting Around Hawaii 69

For tips on renting hand-controlled cars or vans equipped with wheel-
chair lifts, see Chapter 8.
Getting the best deal
Rental cars are quite affordable in Hawaii, although rates do vary from
island to island and from season to season. Of course, I can’t guarantee
what you’ll pay when you book, but you can often get an economy or
compact car for between $125 and $250 a week. If you want a family-size
car — or a convertible — expect to pay anywhere from $225 to $450 a
week, which is still pretty reasonable, especially if you can score a deal.
Book ahead for the best rates, as cars tend to only get more expensive
as bookings increase.
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars:
 Mention membership in AAA, AARP, and frequent-flier programs
when booking. These memberships may qualify you for discounts
ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Ask the reservations agency that books your hotel or your inter-
island air travel if it also books rental cars. Many hotels, condo
rental agents, and even B&B owners can book rental cars at seri-
ously discounted rates; ditto for the interisland air carriers. (See
the section “Flying between the Hawaiian Islands,” earlier in this
chapter.) Often, you can save as much as 30 percent off the stan-
dard rate. And many Hawaii hotels and condos offer excellent-value
room-and-car packages that make your rental essentially free!
 Shop online. As with other aspects of planning your trip, using 
the Internet can make comparison shopping for a car rental much
easier. You can check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites.
Plus, all the major travel sites — Travelocity.com, Expedia.com,
Orbitz.com, Priceline.com, Hotwire.com, Kayak.com, and Yahoo
Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com), for example — have search
engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates for you.
 If you see an advertised special, ask for that specific rate when
booking. The car-rental company may not offer this information
voluntarily. Make sure to remind them; otherwise, you may be
charged the standard (higher) rate.
 Get some friendly help from the locals. AAA Aloha Cars-R-Us
(% 800-655-7989; www.hawaiicarrental.com) is a Hawaii-based
travel agency that specializes exclusively in car rentals on all of the
islands. These folks are dedicated to the task of getting you the
cheapest rate from the major car-rental firms — and making it easy
to boot. They combine custom Internet searches utilizing any avail-
able discounts you may be eligible for (including association and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
70

program memberships) with their exclusive wholesale contract
rates to find you the best rate possible. Best of all, there’s no fee for
using their service.
 Consider booking your car as part of a complete travel package.
Package deals save you dollars not only on airfare and accommoda-
tions but also on your rental cars. This one-stop shopping can help
streamline the trip-planning process. For more on package deals,
see Chapter 5.
 Scrutinize your rental agreement when you pick up your car. And
check your receipt carefully when you return the vehicle. Make
sure you get the rate you were originally quoted — and straighten
out any discrepancy on the spot.
 Don’t forget to ask about frequent-flier mileage. Most car rentals
are worth at least 500 miles on your frequent-flier account. Be sure
to find out which airlines the rental-car company is affiliated with
so that you can earn mileage. Bring your card with you, and make
sure that your account is credited at pickup time.
 Join the rental company’s preferred customer program. Most
companies offer such promotions. You may be able to snag a bar-
gain rate or have a better shot at an upgrade if you’re a member.
Some companies make the process of picking up your car more
hassle-free for members, too. And membership can work just like
the airlines’ frequent-flier plans: Renting from the same company
several times can land you a free day or other perks.
 Make sure that you’re getting free unlimited mileage. Thankfully,
most of the major car-rental companies rent on an unlimited-miles
basis, but you should confirm this policy when you book. Even on
an island, the miles you drive can really add up.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add on
a fee for drivers under 25, whereas some don’t rent to them at all.
Some companies assess a drop-off charge of around $50 if you don’t
return the car to the location where you rented it; others (such as
National) don’t. (However, that extra charge may be embedded in a
higher rate — so check closely.) This fee may be an issue on the Big
Island, where you might want to fly into Kona Airport, on one side of the
island, and leave from Hilo, on the other side (or vice versa), so ask
when you book.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is automatically covered by many credit card
companies. Check with your credit card company before you leave home
so that you can avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 to $25 a day).
In any event, make sure that you’re covered (see the section “Following
Chapter 6: Getting Around Hawaii 71

the rules of the road,” later in this chapter; Hawaii is a no-fault state,
which has important insurance implications).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your car insurance policy back home prob-
ably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, don’t just
assume it will — be sure to check before you leave home, and carry your
insurance card with you.
If your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). See the Quick Concierge at the
back of this book for phone numbers and Web sites. You can probably
skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around without liability
coverage is never a good idea. Note that credit cards will not cover you
for liability, even if they cover you for collision.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas upfront and can return the car with an empty gas
tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t
get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you
pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full
tank or face charges of $6 or more per gallon for any shortfall. If you usu-
ally run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a
perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option, but for most people, it’s
not much of a hardship to top off your tank on the way to the airport.
Hawaii how-to: Renting convertibles
Renting a convertible is a lot like booking an oceanview room. It’s a great
idea if you can afford it, but not worth it if it’s going to put a strain on
your budget. The cost of going topless can be double or more what
you’d pay for a regular car. Expect to pay between $50 and $90 a day for
a convertible, compared with $30 or $40 a day for a better equipped mid-
size car (with such extras as power windows and power locks that don’t
usually come with convertibles).
If you really want to rent a convertible for your island driving but you’re
worried about cost, consider renting a convertible for just part of your
trip or just one island if you’re going to be visiting two or three of them.
Think about Maui, where cruising the road to Hana with the top down
really is the ultimate Hawaii vacation dream. Going topless on Oahu is
pretty great, too, especially if you’re planning to cruise to the North Shore.
If you’ve rented a regular car, ask about an upgrade when you pick up
your car. This may prove especially beneficial if you’re visiting in the off
season. Sometimes, if a rental-car branch has a few idle convertibles sit-
ting around, you may be offered an on-the-spot upgrade for just $10 or
$15 more a day.

72

Following the rules of the road
Know these driving rules and common practices before you get behind
the wheel in Hawaii:
 Hawaii is a no-fault insurance state. If you drive without collision-
damage insurance, you’re required to pay for all damages before
you leave the state, regardless of who is at fault. Your personal auto
policy may provide rental-car coverage; read your policy or check
with your insurer before you leave home, and be sure to bring your
insurance ID card if you decline the rental-car company’s optional
insurance. Some credit card companies also provide collision
damage insurance; check with yours.
 Seatbelts are mandatory for everyone in the car, all the time. The
law is strictly enforced, so be sure to buckle up. Hawaii’s Child
Passenger Restraint Law requires children under 4 years old to ride
in a child safety seat.
 You can turn right on red unless a posted sign specifies other-
wise. Make sure that you make a full stop first — no rolling.
 Pedestrians always have the right of way. This is true even if
they’re not on a crosswalk.
 Use your horn judiciously. Honking your horn to express your
anger at another driver is considered the height of rudeness in
Hawaii. Don’t do it unless you’re alerting someone to immediate
danger. Horns are used to greet friends in Hawaii.
Do not use your rental car as a safe in which to store valuables. Don’t
leave anything that you don’t want to lose in the car or trunk, not even
for a short time. Be especially careful when you park at beaches, where
thieves know that you’re going to leave your car for a while (and you’re
likely to leave goodies in the glove compartment).
The islands are very easy to negotiate, and all the rental-car companies
hand out very good map booklets on each island. If all you have is what
National or Hertz gives you, you’ll do just fine.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what kind of accommodations are right for you
 Getting the best room at the best rate
H
awaii’s resort hotels are notoriously expensive. Hotels won’t hesi-
tate to charge $350 a night for a partial-oceanview room with little
more than a queen-size bed in it. To make matters worse, Hawaii is cur-
rently experiencing a popularity boom, and hotel rates have responded
accordingly. So prepare yourself for the fact that accommodations may
take up a large portion of your total travel budget.
That said, the islands boast plenty of excellent values for every budget if
you just know where to look — and I include lots of reasonably priced
options in the chapters that follow. For general tips on how to save,
check out Chapter 4.
Getting to Know Your Options
Before you book your accommodations, you need to figure out what
kind of place you want. You can find five types of accommodations in 
the islands: resorts, hotels, condos, bed-and-breakfasts, and vacation
rentals. Table 7-1 gives you an idea of what you can expect to pay in
each price category.

Relaxing at a resort
Most resorts (or resort hotels) are multiacre, multibuilding complexes
located directly on the beach. Some are sophisticated, ultraluxury affairs
geared to well-off adults; others are theme park–like spreads that cater
largely to families with kids. More than a few resorts fall somewhere in
between the two extremes.
A resort (or resort hotel) offers everything that your average hotel
offers — plus much more. Each one is different, of course, but you can
expect such amenities as direct beach access, with beach cabanas and
chairs, and often beach-toy rentals and ocean activities as well; pools
(often more than one), often with poolside bar service; an activities
desk; a fitness center and perhaps a full-service spa; a variety of restau-
rants, bars, and lounges; a 24-hour front desk; concierge, valet, and bell
services; twice-daily maid service (which can come in handy after
you’ve dragged sand into your room and used all your towels by 4 p.m.);
room service; tennis and golf; a business center; extensive children’s
programs; and more comforts.
Rooms may be in high-rise towers, but they’re often scattered through-
out the property in low-rise buildings or clustered cottages. They tend
to be done in the same safe, mass-market style throughout the resort —
generally, room 101 is going to look exactly like room 1901. As travelers
increasingly demand more, however, many newer properties (and savvy
new renovations) feature smart, high-style concepts that are intended to
heighten the resort’s unique setting, concept, or personality. Standards
tend to be high, and rooms are usually outfitted with top-quality furnish-
ings and linens. Many luxury resorts also boast an increasing slate of 
in-room extras, such as flatscreen TVs with Nintendo or other gaming
systems, iPod docking units for in-suite music, and DVD players. Internet
access is usually present throughout the property, but often you’ll find
wireless only in the public areas; expect to pay a charge more often 
than not.

Being the best outfitted, and usually the best located, of Hawaii’s accom-
modations options, resorts are also the priciest choices on the market,
although the islands do boast a few midrange resorts. That said, you can
sometimes score attractive rates, even at some of the islands’ most luxu-
rious resorts. You may hit pay dirt by booking through a packager (see
Chapter 5), or just by hitting the reservations line or online booking
engine at the right time. Most resorts also offer specials and package
deals on their own Web sites.
Hanging at a hotel
Hotels tend to be smaller and have fewer facilities than resorts — you
may get a swimming pool, but don’t expect a golf course, more than one
or two restaurants and/or bars, or the myriad amenities that come with
a full-fledged resort. You’ll find the greatest number of nonresort hotels
in Waikiki, where the shoulder-to-shoulder urban setting simply hasn’t
allowed for much full-fledged resort development.
Hotels are often a short walk from the beach rather than beachfront
(although some, like the Westin Moana Surfrider in Waikiki, are right on
the sand). Generally, a hotel offers daily maid service and has a restau-
rant and/or coffee shop, a bar or lounge, on-site laundry facilities, a
swimming pool, and a sundries or convenience-type shop (rather than
designer shopping arcades). Top hotels also have activities desks,
concierge and valet services, limited room service, a business center,
and in-room Internet access (more often than not for a daily charge).
“Boutique” hotels are smaller — maybe 40 or 50 rooms rather than 200
or more — and more intimate than your average Doubletree or Hilton.
The rooms are often more stylish and less cookie-cutter and usually
have more amenities. They tend to cater to adults rather than families.
Again, Hawaii’s boutique-hotel boom is centered in Waikiki.
Hotels run the gamut from very expensive to downright cheap. But even
the priciest ones tend to be less expensive than fully outfitted resorts.
Enjoying the comforts of a B&B
Staying in a bed-and-breakfast allows you to discover Hawaii’s genuine
aloha spirit. More often than not, B&Bs offer a more intimate, and often
more romantic, setting than your average resort, as well as a host who’s
more than happy to help you get to know Hawaii as it really is. If you
want to experience a real slice of island life, B&Bs are the way to go.
B&Bs vary widely in size, style, and services. Generally speaking, they’re
composed of several bedrooms in a home or several cottages or suites
scattered about a property, each of which may or may not have a private
bathroom. (Note: All the B&Bs that I recommend in the accommodations
chapters that follow have units with private bathrooms.) Most offer
Internet access to laptop-toters, but I’ve found that their networks are
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
76

not as reliable as those at the big hotels, so book with a name brand if
you must be online.
I recommend contacting one or more of the following agencies if you’re
considering a stay at a B&B:
 Tops in the state is Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts (% 800-262-
9912 or 808-263-3100; www.bestbnb.com). The owners and staff are
committed to representing only quality B&Bs, inns, and vacation
rentals, and they’re not afraid to say “no” to any property that doesn’t
meet their standards. They represent only accommodations with
private bathrooms, and all are nonsmoking. Some of their units are
free-standing cottages that resemble vacation homes more than
B&Bs; they even represent a few really nice condos. Note that their
bed-and-breakfasts generally have a three-night minimum stay, and
vacation rentals tend to require a seven-night minimum stay.
 Bed & Breakfast Hawaii (% 800-733-1632 or 808-822-7771; www.
bandb-hawaii.com) can also book you into a range of vacation
homes and B&Bs throughout the islands, with prices starting at 
$65 a night.
 You don’t get the same personal service from the Web, but you can
find lots of useful resources there. InnSite (www.innsite.com) fea-
tures B&B listings in all 50 U.S. states, including Hawaii, and around
the globe. Find an inn on the island of your choice, see pictures of
the rooms, and check prices and availability; text is included only
when the proprietor submits it. (It’s free to have an inn listed.) The
innkeepers write the descriptions, and many listings link to the
inn’s own Web sites. What’s more, you may be able to score an
additional discount by booking your reservation through InnSite.
 Other sites that are worth surfing for Hawaii B&Bs are
BedandBreakfast.com (www.bedandbreakfast.com) and 
Bed & Breakfast Inns Online (www.bbonline.com).
Rooming in a vacation rental
“Vacation rental” usually means that you have a full cottage or house all to
yourself. You may never even see an owner, agent, or manager after you
pick up the keys. This option is great for families or people who like their
space and privacy or don’t want to eat every meal out at a restaurant.
The rental may be a studio cottage in a residential neighborhood, a condo,
or a huge beachfront multibedroom house — or anything in between.
Vacation rentals usually have some sort of kitchen facilities (ask when
booking), laundry facilities, at least one TV, and at least one phone.
Because vacation rentals are often privately owned homes, they also may
come with such extras as TV, DVD player, and stereo (never assume;
always ask, if it matters to you). Like condos, many come outfitted with
the basics, such as sheets or towels.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 77

Vacation rentals vary greatly in price depending on their size, location,
and amenities. They tend to be much better values than similarly priced
resort or hotel accommodations, especially if you’re trying to accommo-
date a group or plan a long stay (a week or more). Just make sure that
you get a 24-hour contact person for those times when the toilet won’t
flush or you can’t turn on the air-conditioning.
Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts (see “Enjoying the comforts of a B&B”
earlier in this chapter) is useful for statewide vacation rentals. A statewide
source that’s also worth checking out is Hawaii Beachfront Vacation
Homes (% 808-247-3637; www.hibeach.com).
Hawaii Condo Exchange (% 800-442-0404 or 323-436-0300; www.hawaii
condoexchange.com) is a Southern California–based agency that acts as
a consolidator for condo properties throughout the islands. The agency
works to match you up with the place that’s right for you and tries to get
you a good deal in the bargain.
You can cut out the middle man and rent directly from the owner at a
number of quality condo resorts throughout the islands by visiting
Aloha Condos Hawaii (www.alohacondos.com), an online cooperative
of owner-managed units.
You’ll also find that most companies that offer all-inclusive travel pack-
ages to the islands can book you into any number of island condos, as
can your travel agent.
Finding the Best Room Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is simple:
Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly sur-
prised. But you have to take the initiative and ask, because many hotels
bank on the fact that you’ll just accept the first rate you’re quoted. You
should also chat with the reservations agent about which rooms are the
best and which units match your needs. You never know what kind of
insider advice or upgrade can be won by just asking a question and turn-
ing on the charm.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. That’s because the hotel
may give the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel. However, these days, you can usually do just as
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
78

well yourself as long as you’re willing to spend some time online and
investigate your options.
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number or Web site may
also result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other
hand, the central reservations number may not know about discount
rates at specific locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number
and the toll-free number and see which one gives you a better deal, and
then check it against the rate available online.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy rates
rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are subject to
change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different
from the actual rate you receive when you make your reservation.
Don’t automatically shy away from a hotel if its rack rates seem out of
your range at first glance. A hotel’s official “published” (full-price, or
rack) rates usually represent the upper end of what they charge when
they’re full to capacity, but most hotels routinely offer better prices. And
special deals abound in Hawaii, so in each hotel listing throughout this
book, I note what kind of bargains you can typically snag.
Often the best way to get a great deal on a hotel room is to book it as
part of an all-inclusive travel package that includes airfare, hotel, and
car, and sometimes other extras, in one low price; for details on how to
find the best package deals, see Chapter 5.
Check out Chapter 4 for a long list of money-saving strategies. But here
are a few reminders:
 Rates are generally lowest in the slower seasons. During peak
season — basically winter and summer, and especially around
Christmas — demand is high, and you’re not going to have much
luck fishing for a bargain rate. But in May and September through
November, hotels aren’t usually full. Not only will you find great
deals, but if business is really slow, they’ll be willing to negotiate;
you might even land a room upgrade.
 Start by investigating the hotel’s own special deals. Hawaii’s
hotels regularly offer a dizzying array of special offers. You might
get a free rental car, champagne, and in-room breakfast for honey-
mooners, free dinners, discounted tee times or spa treatments, a
room upgrade, an extra night thrown in for free (sometimes the
fifth, sometimes the seventh), or some other freebie. Check out the
Web site first, but even if you don’t find anything on the Internet,
ask about any specials when you call.
 Membership in AAA, AARP, or frequent-flier programs often qual-
ifies you for discounted rates. Be sure to mention membership in
these organizations and in any corporate rewards programs you
can think of — or your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an
honorary inductee, for that matter — when you call to book. Even
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 79

membership to a wholesale club, such as Costco, has been known
to pay off. You never know when an affiliation may be worth a few
dollars off your room rate.
 Ask innkeepers for a break. Bed-and-breakfasts are generally non-
negotiable on price. Sometimes, however, you can negotiate a dis-
count for longer stays, such as a week or more. You may also be
able to score a price break if you’re visiting off season. And some
do offer AAA and senior discounts. It never hurts to ask.
 Look for price breaks and value-added extras when booking
condos. Condo complexes often feature discounts on multinight
stays, and many throw in a free rental car to sweeten the deal.
Some condo properties have units handled by multiple manage-
ment companies; if that’s the case, price through both companies
and see where you get the better deal. You may also want to check
with Hawaii Condo Exchange (% 800-442-0404 or 323-436-0300;
www.hawaiicondoexchange.com), which acts as a consolidator for
condo properties throughout the islands.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency.
Expedia.com offers a long list of special deals, as well as “virtual tours”
or photos of available rooms so that you can see what you’re paying for.
Travelocity.com posts unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its prop-
erties according to the AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com
(a division of Expedia, so they often offer the same deals), Orbitz.com,
Yahoo! Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com), and Quikbook.com.
Keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing are usually there for
no other reason than that they paid money to get the placement.
You might also want to check out TripAdvisor.com when you’re consid-
ering your options. TripAdvisor isn’t a booking site, per se (although it
does offer links to sites that allow you to make bookings), but it does
offer untainted, straight-from-the-customer’s-keyboard reviews of hotels.
Now, I don’t recommend putting too much stock in a single review —
most of us have unrealistic expectations, or just plain-old bad-luck expe-
riences, now and again — but trends in positive or negative experiences
can become apparent. Also, I love the candid travelers’ photos, which
show you what the hotel rooms really look like (and, often, how small
they really are).
An excellent free program, Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.com), can help
you search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
80

Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 81
heard of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including
the taxes and service charges.
It’s always important to get a confirmation number and make a print-
out of any online booking transaction to avoid any potential issues when
you arrive at the hotel.
In the bidding-site Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com)
and Hotwire (www.hotwire.com) are even better for hotels than for air-
fares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neighborhood and quality
level of your hotel before offering up your money. On the downside, many
hotels stick Priceline and Hotwire guests in their least desirable rooms. Be
sure to go to the BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.
com) before bidding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-
to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline
and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some
hotels don’t provide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-
stay amenities when you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the Best Room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure that you get the best room
in the house. Most Hawaii hoteliers are very friendly and willing to take
the time with you, so don’t be shy — try to find out which units are the
nicest. If the reservations agent doesn’t have any specific recommenda-
tions, try asking for a corner room. In some (but not all) cases, they may
be larger and quieter, with more windows and light than standard
rooms, and they don’t always cost more.
Also ask whether the hotel is renovating, or if any construction is taking
place nearby; this is especially important in Hawaii, where rampant reno-
vation has taken hotels by storm in recent years (and continues to do so
for a few more). If it is, request a room away from the renovation work.
Inquire, too, about traffic and the location of the restaurants, bars, and
discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise.
And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the
front desk firmly but nicely. (Don’t get emotional — your mom’s old
saying about attracting more flies with honey than with vinegar really
was good advice.) If they have another room, they should be happy to
accommodate you, within reason.

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Hawaii is the perfect ohana (family) vacation destination. You and the
keiki (kids) will love the beaches and the wealth of kid-friendly activities.
Lots of families flock to the islands every summer and also at holiday
time and during the spring-break season.
Most hotels and condo complexes, from luxury to budget, welcome the
entire family. Virtually all the larger hotels and resorts have great super-
vised programs for kids 12 and under — which means that you, Mom
and Dad, can have plenty of relaxation time to yourselves as well as
playtime with the kids. Most hotels can also refer you to reliable baby
sitters if you want a night on the town sans the youngsters.
By Hawaii state law, hotels can accept children only between the ages of
5 and 12 into their supervised activity programs.

Condos are particularly suitable for families who want lots of living
space in which to spread out. Parents also appreciate having a kitchen
where they can prepare meals for fussy young eaters — and save signifi-
cantly on dining costs. One drawback of condo complexes is that they
typically don’t have the extensive facilities (like kids’ activities pro-
grams) you’d get in a big resort.
If you don’t want to cart your own kid stuff across the ocean, Baby’s
Away (www.babysaway.com) rents car seats, cribs, strollers (including
jogging strollers), highchairs, playpens, room monitors, and even toys. It
serves Oahu (% 800-496-6386 or 808-685-4299), Maui (% 800-942-9030
or 808-875-9030), and the Big Island (% 800-996-9030 or 808-987-9236).
Give the company a call, and it’ll deliver whatever you need to wherever
you’re staying and pick it up when you’re done. I suggest arranging your
rentals before you leave home to ensure availability. Unfortunately, there
is no location on Kauai.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site 
that offers travel features, deals, and tips; TravelWithYourKids (www.
travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that offers custom-
ized trip planning; and FamilyTravelFiles.com (www.thefamilytravel
files.com), which offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-
beaten-path tours and tour operators for families. BabyCenter (www.
babycenter.com/travel) has terrific recommendations for planning
baby’s first trip, and even tips on traveling while pregnant.
Here are a few tips for family travel planning:
 Don’t try to do too much. I can’t say this too strongly. You’ll all
consider it the trip from you-know-where if you spend too much
time in the car or on interisland flights.
 Take it slow at the start. Give the entire family time to adjust to a
new time zone, unfamiliar surroundings, and just being on the road.
The best way to make this adjustment is to budget a few days in
your initial destination without strict itineraries.
 Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use
it to highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particu-
larly welcoming to families traveling with kids. Zeroing in on these
listings can help you plan your trip more efficiently.
 Book some private time for Mom and Dad. Most, if not all, hotels
are prepared to hook you up with a reliable baby sitter who can
entertain your kids while you enjoy a romantic dinner for two or
another adults-only activity. To avoid disappointment, ask about
baby sitting when you reserve. Local visitor centers can also usu-
ally recommend baby-sitting services in their areas; see the Quick
Concierge in the appendix for contact info.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
One of the many benefits of getting older is that travel often costs less.
Many hotels and package-tour operators offer deals for seniors.
Discounts for seniors are also available at almost all of Hawaii’s major
attractions, and occasionally at restaurants and luau. So when you’re
making reservations or buying tickets, it’s always worthwhile to ask
about senior discounts. Keep in mind, though, that the minimum age
requirement can vary between 50 and 65 (it’s usually between 55 and
65). Always carry an ID card with you.
The statewide Outrigger (% 800-OUTRIGGER or 800-688-7444; www.
outrigger.com) and Ohana (% 800-462-6262; www.ohanahotels.com)
hotel chains offer discounts to all travelers over age 50.
Members of AARP, 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-
2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares,
and car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
YMT Vacations (% 800-922-9000; www.ymtvacations.com) and Grand
Circle Travel (% 800-959-0405; www.gct.com) are just two of the hun-
dreds of travel agencies that specialize in vacations for seniors, includ-
ing trips to Hawaii. But beware: Many of these outfits are of the tour-bus
variety, with free trips thrown in for those who organize groups of 20 or
more. If you’re the independent type, a regular travel agent may be
better for you.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org), a nonprofit
group that offers travel and study programs around the world, offers
excellent low-cost trips to Hawaii for travelers ages 55 and older (plus a
spouse or companion of any age). Trips usually include moderately
priced accommodations and meals in one low-cost package.
U.S. citizens or permanent residents age 62 or older who want to visit
Hawaii’s national parks — including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park 
and Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park on the Big Island,
and Haleakala National Park on Maui — can save sightseeing dollars 
by picking up an America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal
Recreational Lands Pass for Seniors from any national park, recreation
area, or monument. This lifetime pass has a one-time fee of $10 and pro-
vides free admission to all the parks in the National Parks system, plus
50 percent savings on camping and recreation fees, for the cardholder
and all passengers (no more than four adults total). You can get one at
any park entrance as long as you have a proof-of-age ID on hand. For
details, visit www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm.

Accessing Hawaii: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
A disability shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. The Americans with
Disabilities Act requires that all public buildings be wheelchair accessi-
ble and have accessible restrooms.
Hawaii is very friendly to travelers with disabilities. The city of Honolulu
alone has more than 2,000 ramped curbs, and most hotels throughout
the islands are on the newer side and boast wheelchair ramps, extra-
wide doorways and halls, and dedicated disabled-accessible rooms with
extra-large bathrooms, low-set fixtures, and/or fire alarm systems
adapted for deaf travelers.
Your best bet is to contact the local visitor center for the island you’re
interested in visiting. Its staff can provide you with all the specifics on
accessibility in their locale; see the Quick Concierge at the back of this
book for contact info.
Also try the following excellent resources:
 An excellent source for trip-planning assistance is Access Aloha
Travel (% 800-480-1143 or 808-545-1143; www.accessalohatravel.
com). This Hawaii-based travel agency has been planning accessible
trips for travelers with disabilities for decades — and it donates
half its profits to the disabled community. Inquire with these folks
about renting an accessible van during your stay.
 Both MossRehab ResourceNet (% 800-CALL-MOSS, 215-456-9900
or 215-663-6000; www.mossresourcenet.org) and Access-Able
Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) are com-
prehensive resources for travelers with disabilities. Both sites fea-
ture links to travel agents who specialize in planning accessible
trips to Hawaii. Access-Able’s user-friendly site also features relay
and voice numbers for hotels, airlines, and car-rental companies,
plus links to accessible accommodations, attractions, transporta-
tion, tours, and local medical resources and equipment repairers
throughout Hawaii.
 You can join the Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality
(SATH; % 212-447-7284 or 561-361-0017; www.sath.org) for $49 a
year ($29 for seniors and students) to gain access to their vast net-
work of travel connections. The group provides information sheets
on destinations and referrals to tour operators that specialize in

accessible travel. Its quarterly magazine, Open World, is full of good
information and resources.
 Vision-impaired travelers who use a Seeing Eye dog can usually
bypass Hawaii’s animal quarantine rules. You can arrange for your
guide or service dog to be inspected in the terminal at Honolulu
International Airport (saving the owners a trip to the Airport Animal
Quarantine Holding Facility) if you notify Animal Quarantine
(% 808-483-7151) at least 24 hours in advance. Call or visit www.
hawaii.gov/hdoa for specifics on rules and fees. Contact the
American Foundation for the Blind (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.
org) for more travel information.
Gammie HomeCare (% 888-540-4032 or 808-877-4032 on Maui, 808-632-
2333 on Kauai; www.gammie.com) rents a wide variety of mobility aids,
bath safety items, and wheelchairs — including beach wheelchairs that
can navigate on sand. They will deliver to any hotel on Maui or Kauai.
Hawaii’s Disability and Communication Access Board has a roundup 
of travel tips, with information on arriving, air travel, and where to find
local support services. Visit their Web site at www.state.hi.us/health/
dcab/home, and click on “Community Resources” in the scroll bar at left.
Before you book any hotel room, always ask lots of questions based on
your needs. After you arrive, call restaurants, attractions, and theaters
to make sure that they’re fully accessible.
Consider the following sources for getting around, either on your own or
with assistance:
 Avis Rent a Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such
services as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-331-2323;
www.avis.com) for customers who are hearing impaired. Special
car features such as swivel seats, spinner knobs, and hand controls
and accessible bus service are available; call their main customer
service number (% 800-352-7900) for details. Many of the big car-
rental companies — including Avis, Hertz (% 800-654-3131 or
800-654-2280 for hearing-impaired travelers; www.hertz.com), and
National (% 800-227-7368, 800-328-6323 for hearing-impaired trav-
elers, 888-273-5262 for travelers with medical-related requests;
www.nationalcar.com) — rent hand-controlled cars for drivers
with disabilities at Hawaii’s major airports. At least 48 to 72 hours’
advance notice is a must, but do yourself a favor and book further
in advance to guarantee availability.
 HandiWheelchair Transportation (% 808-946-6666) offers door-
to-door taxi services around Honolulu and the rest of Oahu for
wheelchair-bound travelers. Its air-conditioned vehicles are spe-
cially equipped with ramps and wheelchair lock-downs. Airport
service is also available.

Following the Rainbow: Resources for 
Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Hawaii is extremely popular with same-sex couples due to its long-stand-
ing reputation for welcoming all groups.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 954-
630-1637; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for the gay and 
lesbian travel industry, and offers an online directory of gay- and 
lesbian-friendly travel businesses, gay-friendly structured trips, and
occasional travel specials, including special discount codes for National
and Alamo rental cars at press time.
The staff at Pacific Ocean Holidays (% 800-735-6600 or 808-545-5252;
www.gayhawaiivacations.com) specializes in crafting Hawaii vacation
packages for gay men and women. They can help you arrange a good-

Planning a Hawaiian Wedding
No question about it: Hawaii is the perfect place to get married — which
is why so many couples from around the country, and the world, tie the
knot here every year. What better way to start your life together?
Chapter 8: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 87

For a rundown of the legalities, visit www.hawaii.gov/doh and click
“Getting a Marriage License,” where you’ll find all the details, including a
downloadable license application. You can also call % 808-586-4545 for
license information.
Using a wedding planner or coordinator
Wedding planning is a thriving industry in Hawaii. Whether you’ve got
your heart set on a huge formal affair at a luxury resort or an informal
beachside ceremony, you won’t have any trouble finding assistance.
Many wedding planners are also marriage-license agents. They can take
care of the legalities for you with only minimal effort on your part and
then arrange everything else too — from providing an officiant to order-
ing flowers. A wedding planner can cost $500 or more, depending on
how involved you want him or her to be and what kind of wedding you
want.
Your best bet for finding a reputable wedding planner is to choose one
endorsed by the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, whose Web
site features a complete list of wedding planners to suit any budget; go
to www.gohawaii.com and click “Plan a Wedding or Honeymoon.” You
can also call its staff for recommendations at % 800-GO-HAWAII, or —
even better — contact the individual island bureaus for local recommen-
dations; see the Quick Concierge at the back of this book for contact
information. On Kauai, an even better wedding resource than the visitor
center is the Kauai Chamber of Commerce (% 808-245-7363; www.
kauaichamber.org), which sells an extensive wedding guide for $25 
at their online chamber store.
In addition, virtually all the big resorts employ full-time wedding coordi-
nators. Arranging your nuptials directly through a resort may be pricey,
but it’s a relatively worry-free option. The hotel coordinators are experts,
they’ll take all the pesky little details off your hands, and they’ll usually
offer the whole event to you as a pay-one-price wedding package, includ-
ing accommodations. What’s more, the hotels generally offer prime loca-
tions for both the ceremony and the reception.
Great choices include:
 The Halekulani, the Royal Hawaiian, and the Westin Moana
Surfrider on Oahu (see Chapter 10)
 The Four Seasons Resort Maui, the Grand Wailea, the Fairmont Kea
Lani, and the Ritz-Carlton on Maui (see Chapter 12)
 The Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, Kona Village, the Mauna Lani,
and the Fairmont Orchid at Mauna Lani on the Big Island (see
Chapter 14)
 The Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa and the Princeville Resort on
Kauai (see Chapter 16)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
88

Keep in mind that more affordable hotels and condos, even some B&Bs,
can often recommend wedding coordinators that have a proven track
record with them. Maui’s Kaanapali Beach Hotel, for example, makes a
great affordable option (see Chapter 12). The setting is magical, the
hotel works with a very reliable local planner, and the on-site food-and-
beverage director can arrange a pleasing reception. Don’t hesitate to
contact any property that strikes your fancy; most have wedding experi-
ence or can offer recommendations.
Do-it-yourself planning
Once you arrive in Hawaii, you and your intended must appear together
to a marriage license agent (basically, a local official who helps you wrap
up the legalities) when applying for the license. A marriage license costs
$60 (payable in cash) and is good for 30 days from the date of issue. Both
parties must be at least 18 years of age (16- and 17-year-olds must have
written consent of both parents, legal guardian, or family court) and can’t
be more closely related than first cousins. You’ll need a photo ID, such
as a driver’s license; a birth certificate is necessary only if you’re 18 or
under. No blood tests, citizenship, or residency minimum is required.
In Honolulu, go to the Honolulu Marriage License Office, State Depart-
ment of Health Building, 1250 Punchbowl St. (at Beretania Street; % 808-
586-4545 or 808-586-4544), weekdays between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. If you
would like to locate a marriage license agent in other areas of Oahu, call
% 808-586-4544; on Maui, call % 808-984-8210; on the Big Island, call 
% 808-974-6008; on Kauai, call % 808-241-3498; on Molokai, call % 808-
553-3663; or on Lanai, call % 808-565-6411.
Local marriage-license agents are usually friendly, helpful people who
can steer you to someone who’s licensed by the state of Hawaii to per-
form the ceremony. These marriage performers are great sources of
information; they usually know picturesque places to have the ceremony
for free or a nominal fee.
Some marriage-license agents are state employees, and, under law, they
cannot recommend anyone with a religious affiliation; they can only 
give you phone numbers for local judges to perform the ceremony. Ask
first what their limitations are if it matters to you. If you’re interested in
arranging a church ceremony, inquire with the visitor center to locate an
appropriate venue.
You can have a ceremony at any state or county beach or park for free,
but keep in mind that you’ll be sharing the site with the general public.
Here are some romantic spots you may want to consider:
 Oahu: Waikiki’s Kapiolani Park, on Kalakaua Avenue, is ideal at
sunset. You can take gorgeous wedding photos with Waikiki Beach
in the background and then turn around and take another photo
with Diamond Head as your backdrop. I also adore Lanikai Beach,
Chapter 8: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 89

on the lush and gorgeous windward side. Tucked away in a residen-
tial neighborhood, it’s usually quiet and crowd-free. (Weekdays are
best if you want the sand to yourself.)
 Maui: For a genuine Hawaiian experience, get married at Keawalai
Congregational Church (% 808-879-5557; www.keawalai.org), a
vintage 1831 oceanfront coral-block church in picturesque Makena.
The gorgeous grounds — with palm trees, ti leaves, and exotic 
tropical flowers — make a perfect backdrop for your wedding
photo. Another great site is D.T. Fleming Beach Park, just north 
of Kapalua in West Maui. This crescent-shaped beach is generally
empty on weekdays, so you can enjoy a quiet wedding on the beau-
tiful beach as sailboats skim along offshore.
 Big Island: If you picture yourself getting married on a long, white-
sand beach with gorgeous, emerald-green waves rolling in, Hapuna
Beach State Park is the spot for you. On the mistier side of the
island, along bayfront Banyan Drive in romantic Hilo, is Liluokalani
Gardens, the largest formal Japanese garden this side of Tokyo.
This postcard-pretty park has a dozen different areas that are ideal
for a tropical ceremony, and the half-moon bridge is a great spot for
wedding photos.
 Kauai: One of the most dramatic spots in all Hawaii is the North
Shore’s Hanalei Beach, with gorgeous, green Bali Hai–like cliffs in
the background. (Remember South Pacific? Filmed here!) If you’re
set on a church wedding, consider Waioli Hui’ia (“Singing Waters”)
Church (% 808-826-6253; www.hanaleichurch.org), built in 1912
as a mission hall and the oldest surviving church building on Kauai.
It sits in an open field in the heart of the charming Hanalei town
under the spectacular Bali Hai cliffs for an ultraromantic setting.
For those who don’t mind spending a little money for a bit more
privacy, on the South Shore is the extraordinary Allerton Garden,
one of five National Tropical Botanical Gardens (% 808-742-2623;
www.ntbg.org), home to some prime examples of formal land-
scape gardening that would have made William Randolph Hearst
turn green with envy. It’s perfect for a wedding of any scope.

T
his chapter helps you shore up the final details — from getting travel
insurance to planning for activities.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. Check your existing
homeowner’s and auto insurance policies and your credit-card coverage
before buying any additional insurance. You may already be covered.
The cost of travel insurance varies widely, depending on the cost and
length of your trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re
taking, but expect to pay between 5 and 8 percent of the cost of the
vacation itself. You can get estimates from various providers through
InsureMyTrip.com, which compares more than a dozen companies.
 Trip-cancellation insurance may make sense if you’re paying for
your vacation upfront, say, by purchasing a cruise, a package deal,
or an escorted tour. Coverage will help you get your money back if
you have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if
your travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancella-
tion can range from sickness to natural disasters to the State
Department declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers
usually won’t cover vague fears, though, as many travelers 

discovered when they tried to cancel their trips in October 2001
because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies con-
sidered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travelguard.
com; click on “Customer Service” to find the alerts, which featured
a fair number of in-trouble airlines in 2008). Protect yourself further
by paying for the insurance with a credit card — by law, consumers
can get their money back on goods and services not received if
they report the loss within 60 days after the charge is listed on
their credit-card statement.
Note: Many tour operators include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for travelers to obtain
insurance. Make sure that the tour company is a reputable one,
however: Some experts suggest that you avoid buying insurance
from the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying that
it’s safer to buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your
money in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go, par-
ticularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost-luggage insurance is also not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see
whether your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy,
get baggage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-
insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t
buy insurance at the airport, because it’s usually overpriced. Be
sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your
carry-on luggage, because many valuables (including books,
money, and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The
airlines are required to deliver luggage, after it’s found, directly to
your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended insur-
ers: Access America (% 800-284-8300; www.accessamerica.com); AIG
Travel Guard (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com); Travel Insured
International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.com); and Travelex
Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, germs weren’t listening to me any more than
they probably listen to you.)
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.medic
alert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition and
gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot line.
In the unlikely event that you do get sick in Hawaii, keep the following 
in mind:
 By law, all employers in Hawaii must provide health insurance for
their employees, and almost all islanders have insurance. As a
result, some doctors simply won’t see patients who aren’t insured.
If you don’t have insurance (or you don’t have insurance that trav-
els with you) and you need to see a doctor while you’re in Hawaii,
be sure to inform him or her when you call to make an appointment.
Check the “Fast Facts” sections in Chapter 10 (Oahu), Chapter 12
(Maui), Chapter 14 (the Big Island), and Chapter 16 (Kauai) to find a
doctor or medical-care clinic that regularly caters to visitors.
 Longs Drugs, which has branches throughout the islands, accepts
most national prescription cards, such as PCS — so if you have a
card, bring it with you. If you get sick and need to fill a prescription
during your trip, chances are good that you’ll have to pay only a
copayment, just like back home, instead of the full price for pre-
scribed medicines. To find a Longs near you, call % 800-865-6647
or visit www.longsdrugs.com.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 93
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s mislabeled in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. Over time, it can travel to your
lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism, blocking blood flow to your heart. It’s a very
rare but potentially deadly condition that can be caused by sitting in cramped condi-
tions — such as an airplane cabin — for too long. During a long-haul flight, get up,
walk around, and stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing.
Other preventive measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking
lots of water, and avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein
thrombosis, heart disease, or any other condition that puts you at high risk, some
experts recommend wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when
you fly; always ask your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms include
leg pain or swelling, or shortness of breath and sharp pains in your lungs.

Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Most major cellphone networks have great coverage in Hawaii. However,
don’t just assume that because your cellphone works at home that it
will work in the islands. Take a look at your wireless company’s cover-
age map on its Web site before getting on the plane. You should also
check your cellphone contract, because coverage varies depending on
the particular package you’ve purchased. If you need to stay in touch at
a destination where you know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that
does from InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com).
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach
of our GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used
by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities, but rural coverage tends to be haphazard; the good news
is that Hawaii is well covered. (To see where GSM phones work in the
United States, check out www.wireless.att.com/coverageviewer.) You
may or may not be able to send text messages home. Assume nothing —
call your wireless provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case sce-
nario, you can always rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Travelers accessing the Internet away from home have any number of
options. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA, pocket PC,
or Web-compatible cellphone — gives you the most flexibility. But even
if you don’t have a computer, you can still access your e-mail and even
your office computer from cybercafes and other hotel business centers.
It’s hard these days to find a destination that doesn’t have a few cyber-
cafes. Although there’s no definitive directory for locations, two places to
start looking are at www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Almost all but the most budget-basic hotels offer wireless or wired Internet
access that you can plug right into; the price of access can range from
complimentary to $15 or $20 a day. Even most (but not all) B&Bs offer
Internet access these days. Check with your hotel in advance to see
what your options are.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates, as well as wireless Internet access for laptop toters. Some
airports charge, while others provide free service. Kiosks give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. Most Hawaii airports offer limited access for a cost through
Boingo.com.
To retrieve your e-mail, check with your Internet service provider (ISP)
to see if it offers a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account.
Virtually all do these days. If your ISP doesn’t have such an interface,
you can use the free mail2web service (www.mail2web.com) to view
and reply to your home e-mail. Or open a free, Web-based e-mail account
with Yahoo! Mail (mail.yahoo.com). Microsoft’s Windows Live, for-
merly known as Hotmail (mail.live.com) is another popular option.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
94

If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hack-
ers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to access the
GoToMyPC system.
Wherever you go, don’t forget to bring a connection kit of the right
power and phone adapters.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
Even after the federalization of airport security, security procedures at
U.S. airports tend to be uneven. But generally you’ll be fine if you arrive
at the airport 11⁄2 hours before a domestic or interisland flight and two
hours before an international flight. Be sure to allow extra time if you’re
traveling on a high-volume holiday getaway day, or if the terrorism alert
level has been raised.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for inter-
national flights to most countries.)
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with e-
tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from their home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing your boarding pass; this is usually allowable 24 hours
in advance of flight time. If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the
credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. If
you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you’ll be able
to do so using most airline kiosks. Curbside check-in is also a good way
to avoid lines, although it’s not universally available.
Security checkpoint lines have become more efficient as the TSA has
staffed up and streamlined the process, but some doozies remain. If you
have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee;
the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing
metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts,
a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screen-
ers. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past secu-
rity, except for folks escorting passengers with disabilities or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
Food and beverages are not allowed in containers larger than 3 ounces.
Liquids or gels — that is, most toiletries — must be 3 ounces or smaller,
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95

and all of them must be placed in one clear quart-sized plastic, zip-top
bag and screened separately from your other luggage. All other toiletries
must be transported to your destination in your checked luggage.
Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop 
in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web
site (www.tsa.gov) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary.
Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors
with a special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit
www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved
locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to
hand-search your luggage.
Making Reservations before You Leave Home
In addition to buying your airfare, booking your accommodations, and
reserving a rental car, you may want to make a few plans before you
leave home.
You don’t have to call ahead to reserve most activities until you arrive in
Hawaii. Most snorkel cruises, guided tours, and the like can be reserved
a day or two in advance. Even high-profile restaurants can usually get
you in within a few days of the day you call.
Still, planning is never a bad idea — especially if you’re traveling during
a busy time, such as spring break or the holidays. I recommend booking
anything you absolutely do not want to miss before you leave home to
ensure that you’re not disappointed. And it’s an absolute necessity for
certain special events and activities, including the following:
 Luau: Maui’s Old Lahaina Luau is the best in the islands — and it
always sells out at least a week in advance, often more, as does its
sister luau, The Feast at Lele. It’s never too early to reserve your
seats; see Chapter 12 for contact information. Second-best is the
Big Island’s Kona Village Luau, which is offered only on Friday
nights; see Chapter 14. Oahu’s top choice, the romantic Royal Luau
at the Royal Hawaiian, lights up Waikiki Beach on one or two
nights a week (call for the current schedule), so plan accordingly;
see Chapter 10.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Hawaii 
96

 Snorkel cruises: Maui’s finest snorkel-cruise operator is Trilogy
Excursions. They’re hugely popular, so you may want to book
before you leave home (see Chapter 13). Ditto for the Big Island’s
Fair Wind Cruises, the only catamaran operator with rights to 
take you to the finest snorkel spot in all the Hawaiian Islands,
Kealakekua Bay (see Chapter 15). And if you don’t want to miss the
spectacular dolphin-watching tours off Oahu’s leeward coast by
Dolphin Excursions — I wouldn’t! — be sure to secure your spots
before you leave home. See Chapter 11.
 Special guided tours: I especially recommend making advance book-
ings with Hawaii Forest & Trail on the Big Island (see Chapter 15)
if you don’t want to miss out on its special offerings. Maui’s excel-
lent Pony Express horseback rides into Haleakala National Park’s
crater also require before-you-leave-home booking to guard against
disappointment (see Chapter 13). The same goes for the terrific
garden tour at the National Tropical Botanical Garden on Kauai
(see Chapter 17), which often sells out a week or two in advance.
 Special events: Certain special events require planning or arrange-
ments, such as the Merrie Monarch Hula Festival, the Hawaii
International Jazz Festival, the Brothers Cazimero Lei Day
Concert at the Waikiki Band Shell, and the Kapalua Wine & Food
Festival. Check Chapter 3 to see what will be on while you’re in
town, and whether it requires planning. You may also want to check
with the individual island visitor centers; see the Quick Concierge
at the back of the book for contact information.
 Special-occasion or holiday meals: You should always make
advance reservations to avoid disappointment. I indicate reserva-
tions policies in all restaurant reviews. This is especially true on
holidays, when the nicer restaurants are overrun with locals and
visitors alike. Take it from me on this one — I couldn’t get a same-
day table at a decent restaurant in Honolulu on Mother’s Day to
save my life. And if you’d like to dine at Alan Wong’s on Oahu at
any time of year, call at least a week in advance to score a decent
dining time.
 Scuba classes: First-time scuba divers may want to look into the
various resort courses that are available, because they differ from
outfitter to outfitter. See Chapters 11, 13, 15, and 17 for reputable
local dive instructors on each of the main islands.
Consider taking scuba certification classes before you leave home;
that way, you don’t waste time learning in some resort swimming
pool and can dive right in as soon as you get to Hawaii. A great way
to find a local scuba instructor is via the Professional Association
of Diving Instructors (PADI) Web site; go online to www.padi.com.
Planning a few of your activities before you leave home is often the best
way to guarantee that you won’t miss out on an event or a restaurant
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 97

that you’ve been counting on — that way, if a group suddenly decides
that it’s going to take over a snorkel boat for a full day, or a restaurant is
planning to close down for a week to install a new stove in the kitchen,
you have the opportunity to amend your plans accordingly. Besides, you
don’t want to spend your valuable Hawaii time on the phone in your
hotel room, do you?

Honolulu and the

In this part . . .
B
usier and more developed than the other islands, Oahu
is known as “the Gathering Place.” It’s home to Hawaii’s
biggest and busiest metropolis, Honolulu, which embodies
city life in the islands — a strength or weakness of this vibrant
island, depending on your point of view. The two chapters 
in this part help you plan your trip to this gorgeous, surpris-
ingly diversiﬁed island and offer reviews of Oahu’s best
accommodations, restaurants, adventures, and attractions.

O
ahu is the busiest and most complex island in the Hawaiian chain,
but it’s still relatively easy to learn your way around. Because it has
a reliable public transportation system, this is the one island where it’s
possible to get by without a rental car. Still, I recommend that you book
your own wheels for freedom of movement.
Whether you’re traveling from the mainland or a neighboring island,
you’ll arrive at Honolulu International Airport. That’s where this chapter
picks up. I’ll tell you everything you need to know to get situated in this
beautiful spot.
Arriving at Honolulu International Airport
Honolulu International Airport (% 888-697-7813, 808-836-6411, or
808-836-6413; www.state.hi.us/dot/airports/oahu/index.htm or
www.honoluluairport.com) is located on the South Shore of Oahu near
Pearl Harbor, west of downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. It’s 9 miles, or
about a 20- to 30-minute drive, away from Waikiki.
Honolulu International is a large but easily navigable airport. All main-
land flights arrive in the Main Overseas Terminal; the Baggage Claim
area is on the ground level. After collecting your bags, exit to the palm-
lined street, where you can pick up taxis, Waikiki shuttles, and rental-car
vans. If you’re catching a neighbor-island flight, walk to the large
Interisland Terminal (which takes 10–15 min.) or hop on the Wiki-Wiki
Bus, a free airport shuttle that links the terminals (wiki wiki means
“quick” in Hawaiian).

Getting from the Airport to Your Hotel
A rental car isn’t a strict necessity on Oahu, but it’s my preferred
method for getting around. Even if you use public transportation in
Waikiki, you’ll probably want a car for venturing farther afield. Luckily,
rental cars are usually rather inexpensive on Oahu, and all the big com-
panies have cars available at the airport. You’ll get the best rate if you
book before you arrive, though; see Chapter 6 for more details.
Driving yourself
A van from your car-rental agency will take you to the lot where you can
pick up your car. From baggage claim, head out to the well-marked curb-
side waiting area. The appropriate rental van should swing by within a
few minutes.
All the rental-car agencies offer map booklets, which are invaluable for
getting around the island. Some car-rental agents can even give you com-
puter-generated, detailed directions from the airport to your hotel.
To get to Waikiki, simply turn right out of the airport (signs are clear)
onto Nimitz Highway (Highway 92), which runs directly under the H-1
(one of Oahu’s three freeways) for a few minutes. In about ten minutes,
Nimitz Highway deposits you onto Ala Moana Boulevard, which 
takes you past downtown Honolulu (on your left) and Aloha Tower
Marketplace (on your right), and then, a few minutes later, the huge Ala
Moana Shopping Center (on your left) and grassy Ala Moana Beach Park
(on your right). Moments later, you reach Kalakaua (ka-la-cow-ah)
Avenue, Waikiki’s main thoroughfare.
Taking a taxi
The taxi stand is located just outside the automated doors in the Baggage
Claim area. You should have no trouble getting a taxi, but if you need
help, an attendant is on hand to assist you. AMPCO Express (% 808-
861-8294) manages the taxi-stand service at the airport. Taxi fare to
Waikiki is about $25 to $35, plus tip.
Star Taxi (% 800-671-2999 or 808-942-7827; www.startaxihawaii.com)
can offer prearranged airport pickups to Waikiki for $22 (plus tip); use
the toll-free number to arrange your pickup before you leave home. Be
sure to have your airline, flight number, and arrival time on hand when
you call.
Catching a shuttle ride
The Airport Waikiki Express Shuttle (% 1-866-898-2519;
www.robertshawaii.com/hat.htm) operates shuttles between the air-
port and Waikiki hotels round-the-clock, with passenger vans departing
every 20 to 30 minutes. The fare is $8 per person to Waikiki, $15 round-
trip (round-trip fare applies only if you buy a round-trip ticket upon

arrival at the airport); children 3 and under ride free. Each passenger is
allowed two bags; you’ll pay a few dollars extra for additional or over-
size baggage. No reservation is necessary. You can buy your tickets at
the Roberts Hawaii desk near Baggage Claim turnstile H.
No reservation is necessary to take the shuttle from the airport to your
hotel, but be sure to book a hotel pickup for your departing flight at
least 24 hours in advance by calling % 808-566-7333. Allow 45 minutes
to an hour to get to the airport.
Shuttle service between Waikiki and the airport is offered 24 hours a day
from V.I.P. Trans. (% 866-836-0317 or 808-836-0317; www.viptrans.
com). The fare is $11 per person ($20 round-trip), and they’ll even meet
you at the baggage carousel; the only caveat is that you’re restricted to
two pieces of luggage per person. Add on a lei greeting for $16 per
person.
The island’s descriptively named bus system, TheBus (% 808-848-5555;
www.thebus.org), does travel between the airport and Waikiki, and 
the one-way fare is just $2 ($1 for kids under age 19, or free for a child
under age 6 who sits on your lap). Bus nos. 19 and 20 (Waikiki Beach and
Hotels) run to downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. The hitch is that you’re
not allowed to board with any substantive luggage. You can bring on a
carry-on or small suitcase as long as it fits under the seat and doesn’t
disrupt other passengers; otherwise, you have to take a shuttle or taxi.
What’s more, the ride to Waikiki will take more than an hour, as opposed
to 20 minutes or a half-hour if you take a taxi or shuttle.
If you’re not going to rent a car, I suggest taking a taxi or shuttle from the
airport and then using TheBus to get around town after you’ve settled
in. For more information on TheBus, see the section “Letting somebody
else do the driving,” later in this chapter.
Choosing Your Location
Oahu’s greatest asset is its diversity. This is an island with a destination
for everyone, whether you want to be where the action is, prefer to live
like a local, or are looking to discover your inner beach bum.
It used to be that visitors came to Oahu to stay in Waikiki, period. Most
still do, and for good reason: Waikiki is the Pacific’s party central, a laid-
back, high-rise beach party bustling with energy and easygoing fun.
Dining and nightlife options abound. And transportation is a snap; you
don’t need a rental car to get to the beach, because it’s right there, and
most of Oahu’s major attractions, like Pearl Harbor for sightseeing and
Hanauma Bay for prime snorkeling, are a bus ride away.
However, Waikiki isn’t for everyone, particularly travelers with a penchant
for quieter or more natural settings, or those who prefer off-the-beaten-
path experiences. If this sounds like you, Oahu still holds promise: The
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
108

island’s gorgeous, residential Windward Coast and the rural, funky North
Shore have begun to welcome visitors in significant numbers, too. These
destinations tend to cater to travel do-it-yourselfers who prefer vacation
rentals or home-style bed-and-breakfasts over full-service hotels (although
the North Shore does boast one excellent full-service resort). Both areas
move at a much slower pace than high-energy Waikiki; however, they
both tend to receive more rain, on average, than Waikiki’s sunny south
shore. Also, you will need a rental car to enjoy them, and you should
expect to do a decent amount of driving to reach many of the island’s
main attractions — but you will find plenty of fabulous beaches within
shouting distance.
Waikiki
Although all of Waikiki qualifies as a beach party, each of its three neigh-
borhoods, connected along Kalakaua Avenue, Waikiki’s main drag, has
its own personality.
Mid-Waikiki
Mid-Waikiki is the life of the party. This is Waikiki at its most densely built,
but also Waikiki at its most convenient. Restaurants, shopping, and —
most important — the city’s most popular and celebrated stretch of
sand are all within walking distance.
Although it retains some vestiges of cheese, mid-Waikiki has become more
sophisticated of late, with respectable restaurants and both midrange
and couture boutiques outnumbering the T-shirt shops and tacky sou-
venir posts. The midsection of the beach has been transformed into a
wonderful public playground, with winding flagstone paths, blooming
tropical foliage, and grassy knolls. Fortunately, affordable hotels remain;
the neighborhood has simply improved around them.
Ewa Waikiki
Ewa (ee-va) Waikiki is the western end of the neighborhood, on the way
to downtown Honolulu. (Oahuans say “Ewa” to indicate a westerly direc-
tion, meaning toward the town called Ewa on the west side of Oahu.)
This western end of Waikiki, beyond Saratoga Road (on the other side of
Fort DeRussy Park from mid-Waikiki), is a tad removed but plenty con-
venient. The beach is quieter at this more residential end (mostly high-
rise apartments), but you may find yourself getting in the car (or
hopping the Waikiki Trolley) to mid-Waikiki destinations.
Waikiki has received a major update in the form of Waikiki Beach Walk,
Waikiki’s largest development project in 30 years. Developers have
entirely reinvented about 8 acres of prime Ewa Waikiki real estate
(around Lewers Street and Beach Walk, between Kalakaua Avenue and
the ocean) as an exciting, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use master-plan
destination, with 100,000 square feet of new retail space in the form of
dining, lodging, shopping, and entertainment. Highlights of the plan
include a brand-new Embassy Suites hotel; new timeshare units; new
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 109

restaurants, including the first Waikiki outpost of the famed Roy’s
Hawaiian fusion restaurants and the first Hawaii outlet of world-famous
Japanese fusion mecca, Nobu; and plenty of good-quality shopping, as
well as an outdoor entertainment plaza. With the exception of a luxe new
Trump hotel and residence tower, which isn’t slated to be complete until
early 2010, and an adjacent retail and dining complex that will be the
new home to the Hard Rock Cafe, the construction is generally complete.
I found the area to be a wonderful place to stay in mid-2008, and it will
only get better. For the latest information, including a webcam and a full
list of the accommodations, shops, and restaurants that populate the
walkable area, visit www.waikikibeachwalk.com.
Diamond Head Waikiki
For those who want both relative quiet and convenience, this eastern-
most section of Waikiki is the place to stay. Many (including me) call
Diamond Head Waikiki their favorite section of town, thanks to its pretty
setting, easygoing vibe, great beach, and prime panoramic views of the
rest of Waikiki. A handful of small hotels and condo buildings sits at the
foot of Diamond Head crater, separated from the rest of the neighbor-
hood by well-manicured Kapiolani Park. The beach here, called Sans
Souci Beach, is the locals’ favorite stretch, thanks to its beauty (Diamond
Head makes a gorgeous backdrop) and intimate, low-key vibe. Waikiki’s
bustle is still within easy walking distance.
East Oahu: Kahala
This exclusive residential neighborhood on the other side of Diamond
Head, just a ten-minute drive east of prime Waikiki, is the perfect compro-
mise for those who want an away-from-it-all vibe and a freeway-convenient
location. Expect to dig deep, though — the only hotel in these parts is
the Kahala Resort, one of Honolulu’s finest.
The Windward Coast
This is the Oahu of Lost — lush, misty, and almost impossibly green. You
can reach this dense but gorgeous residential area via two freeway tun-
nels that have been bored through the Koolau Mountains, creating easy
traffic flow between urban Honolulu and the prime Windward Coast
communities of Kailua, Lanikai Beach, and Kaneohe. Although these
communities are far quieter than high-energy Honolulu, don’t expect
wide-open spaces; most vacation rentals and B&Bs are in attractive but
populous suburban or beach neighborhoods. If you don’t require a full-
service resort, the Windward Coast is your best chance of having it all
on Oahu. The beaches are gorgeous, the vibe is laid-back, and the city’s
restaurants and attractions are an easy drive. However, this lush coast
tends more toward rain than Waikiki’s sunny south shore (although I’ve
enjoyed plenty of perfect beach days on this side of the island). Also, the
Windward Coast is best for morning types, because the sun hides
behind the misty Koolau range come late afternoon.
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
110

The North Shore
Oahu’s rural North Shore is the heart of Hawaii’s surf culture. The
charming town of Haleiwa (ha-lay-ee-va), surfdom’s unofficial capital,
really comes alive in winter, when the monster waves arrive, drawing
serious surfers from around the world — and the people who love to
watch them in action.
The North Shore is significantly more rural and more spread out than the
Windward Coast, but it’s not as convenient to town; expect about an hour’s
drive to Honolulu, which tends to preclude hopping in the car for an easy
jaunt. The area quiets down in summer, when it becomes an ideal water
playland for couples and families who want a rural, out-of-the-way get-
away. The beaches are gorgeous and glassy in the warm months, and the
vibe is peaceful and carefree. Surf excitement reigns in winter, when big-
wave bad boys and girls show up to ride the big blue crush. However,
normal folks will have to drive to the Windward Coast or south shore to
find a welcoming beach during these months. Save for one lovely ocean-
front hotel, the Turtle Bay Resort, accommodations are almost entirely
vacation rentals.
Leeward Oahu: The Ko Olina Resort
Past Pearl Harbor, about 40 minutes west of Waikiki via the H-1 freeway,
is the carefully manicured Ko Olina Resort, the only full-fledged resort
development on the arid leeward coast of Oahu. The JW Marriott Ihilani
Resort and Spa is a refuge for golfers and spa-goers who want to see
Oahu’s attractions without staying in an urban setting. The downside?
Expect to spend a good portion of your island visit in the car and a good
deal of money on resort dining because all the island’s sights and restau-
rants are at least a half-hour’s drive away. Best for Marriott fans or those
who want a quiet, out-of-the-way destination without sacrificing sun or
the comforts of a full-service resort hotel.
Getting Around Oahu
Getting around Waikiki and Honolulu is a tad complicated, simply because
so many streets are one-way. But with a good map in hand, you won’t
have a problem. After you get past the city, basically one road circles the
island, so you’d have to work hard to lose your bearings.
Navigating your way around Honolulu
A big, bustling city, Honolulu is approximately 12 miles wide and 26
miles long, running east–west roughly between Diamond Head crater
and Pearl Harbor. It folds over seven hills laced by seven streams and
runs down to the sea.
Honolulu’s most famous neighborhood, Waikiki, runs along Honolulu’s
central stretch of coast all the way to grassy Kapiolani Park and
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 111

Diamond Head crater to the east. This well-developed strip of land is
about 3 miles long, but it extends from the coast inland only a few blocks
to the man-made Ala Wai Canal.
Waikiki’s primary thoroughfares run east to west. Kalakaua Avenue runs
1 block away from and parallel to the coast in an easterly direction, toward
Diamond Head. Ala Wai Boulevard runs along Waikiki’s inland (northern)
edge one-way toward downtown. Sandwiched in between — 1 block
north of Kalakaua, 1 block south of Ala Wai — is Kuhio Avenue, which
handles two-way traffic.
West of Waikiki is the Ala Moana section of Honolulu, so named for the
Ala Moana Center, Honolulu’s retail and transportation hub. (You can
pick up almost every major bus route here; see the section “Boarding
TheBus,” later in this chapter.) Drive west on Ala Moana, and you pass
more shopping stops — Ward Centre, the Ward Warehouse, a mall of
dining options called Restaurant Row, and the historic harbor front
Aloha Tower Marketplace shopping and restaurant complex — before
reaching downtown Honolulu.
Situated in the blocks inland from the Aloha Tower Marketplace — 
basically between Nuuanu Avenue and Punchbowl Street — downtown
Honolulu comprises a tiny cluster of high-rises that serves as the 
financial, business, and government center of Hawaii. Also here are 
the Chinatown Historic District, the oldest Chinatown in America, and
some of Hawaii’s most important historic landmarks, most notably
Iolani (ee-oh-lan-ee) Palace, the only royal palace on American soil.
Inland from here, and north of the Ala Wai Canal above Waikiki, residen-
tial neighborhoods make their way up the hills, creating an urban back-
drop unlike any other in a major American city. Running through these
neighborhoods is the freeway known as H-1, which leads to the east end
of Oahu.
To avoid frustration when driving around Waikiki and downtown
Honolulu, always have a map nearby that features directional arrows on
the city’s many one-way streets. The map on the color tear-out Cheat
Sheet at the front of this book — which features Waikiki on one side and
Honolulu on the other — should do the trick. Just think of the Waikiki
side as the easterly portion and the Honolulu side as the westerly por-
tion; if you were to photocopy them and put them side by side, they’d
(roughly) align to cover, in large part, the area where you’ll be spending
most of your time in the city.
If you stop a local and ask for directions, you’re likely to hear a few unfa-
miliar terms. That’s because islanders tend to give directions a bit differ-
ently than what mainlanders are used to, particularly in Honolulu:
 Seldom will anyone direct you north or south; instead, they’ll send
you either makai (ma-kai), meaning toward the sea, or mauka
(mow-kah), toward the mountains.
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
112

 Instead of east and west, locals will tell you to go Diamond Head
when they mean east (in the direction of the world-famous
Diamond Head crater), and Ewa (ee-va) when they mean west (in
the direction of the town called Ewa, beyond Pearl Harbor).
So if you ask a local for directions, this is what you’re likely to hear:
“Drive 2 blocks makai [toward the sea] and then turn Diamond Head
[east] at the stoplight. Go 1 block and turn mauka [toward the moun-
tains]. It’s on the Ewa [western] side of the street.”
Exploring the rest of Oahu
After you move beyond the city, Oahu is simple to navigate. That’s
because just a few roads work in concert to form a rough circle.
The “Circle Island” route starts in Honolulu; travels up the middle of the
island to the North Shore; curves around the island’s top knob; proceeds
down the eastern, or windward, coast; and curves around the island’s
eastern knob back to Waikiki and Honolulu. (Thanks to a few highway
tunnels drilled through the Koolau Mountains, you can also drive directly
between Honolulu and the Windward Coast without having to go all the
way around the east end of the island.)
Driving to the North Shore
The North Shore is the epicenter of Hawaii’s surf culture. Small commu-
nities and collections of simple houses serve as scant interruption for the
string of fabulous beaches that line this rural coast, where the schizo-
phrenic surf is flat as a pancake in summer and kicks up to monster pro-
portions in winter. The surf town of Haleiwa (ha-lay-ee-vah) is the North
Shore’s main community. Still small and charming, Haleiwa is neverthe-
less on a significant growth curve, with an expanding shopping and
restaurant scene — and corresponding traffic — as interest in Hawaii
surf culture continues to explode.
I highly recommend coming here to explore, either to watch the world’s
most outrageous daredevil surfers in action in winter, or just to experi-
ence the laid-back vibe and play in the baby waves in summer. I discuss
the beaches and other North Shore highlights in Chapter 11.
Haleiwa sits about an hour’s drive north of Waikiki, at the junction of
highways 99 and 83, both called Kamehameha Highway. The easiest way
to get there is to cruise north through Oahu’s broad and fertile central
valley, past Pearl Harbor, Schofield Barracks, and pineapple and sugar
cane fields until the sea reappears.
From Waikiki, pick up the H-1 freeway heading west. Your best bet is
probably to take Ala Wai Boulevard to McCully Street north to H-1, but it
all depends on where your hotel is; ask at the front desk for the most
direct route.
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 113

After you’re on H-1, stay to the right, because the freeway divides
abruptly. Follow the signs for H-1 and then H-1/H-2. When the two roads
divide, follow the H-2 up the middle of the island, heading north toward
the town of Wahiawa (wa-hee-ah-va). That’s what the sign will say — not
North Shore or Haleiwa, but Wahiawa.
The H-2 runs out and becomes a two-lane road about 18 miles out of down-
town Honolulu, near Schofield Barracks. It then turns into Kamehameha
Highway (first Highway 99, then Highway 83) at Wahiawa. Kam Highway,
as the islanders call it, is your road for the rest of the trip to Haleiwa.
You can also meander your way to the North Shore by driving along the
lush Windward Coast and around Oahu’s peak. In fact, I highly recom-
mend driving the full circle and making a day of it. If you’re in a hurry to
get to the North Shore, take the central route and follow the Windward
Coast back south. If you’d rather enjoy one or two of the windward
side’s magnificent beaches on the way north (see Chapter 11), do that in
the morning and come back to Waikiki via the less scenic central route.
For windward driving directions, see “Cruising along the scenic
Windward Coast,” later in this chapter.
Heading to East Oahu
At some point, you’re likely to find yourself heading beyond Diamond
Head, either bound for Hanauma Bay, one of Hawaii’s finest snorkel
spots (the best for first-timers), or Sea Life Park, or just to take in some
extremely groovy desert-meets-the-sea scenery. You can reach East
Oahu simply by heading east on the H-1, which dumps you onto the
Kalanianaole (ka-lan-ee-an-ow-lay) Highway (Highway 72), the main thor-
oughfare that takes you around the elbow of Oahu.
Cruising along the scenic Windward Coast
Stand in the heart of Waikiki with your back to the ocean. To your right,
you’ll see a mountain range called the Koolaus (koo-oo-laus); on the
other side of them is the east coast of Oahu. This windward-facing coast
is the island’s wettest side and, therefore, is its most lush and gorgeous.
Lined with suburban beach communities and some breathtakingly beau-
tiful beaches, it’s well worth seeing.
Three highways will get you from the city to the Windward Coast in
about 20 minutes or so: the Pali Highway (Highway 61), the Likelike 
(lee-kay-lee-kay) Highway (Highway 63), and the H-3 freeway, all of which
cut right through the mountains. Your best bet from Waikiki is to take
the H-1 to the Pali Highway. After you go through the tunnel, turn left on
Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83); this coastal highway will be your
roadway for the rest of the trip, whether you choose to follow it all the
way to Haleiwa (about 11⁄2 hours without stops), whether you’re heading
to the Polynesian Cultural Center (the South Pacific cultural theme park
about an hour from Waikiki), or whether you’re simply enjoying the ultra-
lush scenery and some of best beaches in the islands. (See Chapter 11
for specific suggestions.)
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
114

Dominating the west side of Oahu is the island’s second mountain range,
the Waianae (wah-ee-an-eh) Mountains. Beyond this ridge is the hot, dry
leeward side of the island. There’s not much to see there, and locals
prefer to keep this one area of heavily touristed Oahu to themselves.
Unless you’re heading to the area’s one master-planned resort commu-
nity, Ko Olina, up to Waianae to meet a scheduled cruise with Dolphin
Excursions (see Chapter 11), or for some other prearranged reason, I
suggest honoring their wishes and concentrating your efforts on explor-
ing the other parts of the island.
Letting somebody else do the driving
Oahu is the one island that’s easy to visit if you can’t — or won’t — drive
yourself. Oahu’s islandwide public transportation system, TheBus (www.
thebus.org), is extremely user-friendly. The Waikiki Trolley (www.
waikikitrolley.com) is also available for getting around town.
Although TheBus can take you anywhere you want to go on Oahu, I don’t
recommend using it to reach areas beyond the city. Not only will you
spend a total of 31⁄2 to 41⁄2 hours on the bus getting there and back, but
the waits can be extremely long at lonely North Shore bus stops. If you
don’t want to rent a car for the entire duration of your stay, I strongly
encourage you to rent one at least for your day of North Shore and
Windward Coast exploring. If, for some reason, you can’t rent a car but
still want to explore, use one of the tour companies I mention in Chapter
11 to take you around the island.
Boarding TheBus
TheBus is an excellent transit deal. The service is good, the buses are
clean, and the cost is low. The one-way fare to ride is $2 per adult and 
$1 for school-age children, seniors, or riders with disabilities. That low
price can get you anywhere you want to go on the island. Service begins
daily at 3:30 a.m. and runs until 1:30 a.m. Buses run about every 5 to 15
minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evening.
If you plan to use TheBus on multiple occasions, consider purchasing the
$20 4-Day Pass, which entitles you to unlimited rides over a consecutive
four-day period; these passes are sold at ABC Stores and certain 7-Eleven
stores. If you’re going to be in town for a longer stay, you can buy a
Monthly Pass for $40 ($20 for kids, seniors, and people with disabilities).
These are sold at most 7-Eleven stores, as well as at Foodland, Star, and
Times supermarkets. Or you can go directly to TheBus Pass Office at
Kalihi Traffic Center, 811 Middle St. (between King Street and
Kamehameha Highway) in downtown Honolulu (% 808-848-4444); to get
there, take the 1, 2, A, or B lines.
TheBus operates dozens of bus lines, but you’ll need to concern yourself
only with the handful that pass through Waikiki. Two-way Kuhio Avenue
is the main thoroughfare for bus routes through Waikiki.
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 115

Virtually all the city’s major bus routes converge at the Ala Moana
Shopping Center, just west of Waikiki. TheBus makes three stops at 
the mammoth mall: two on the ocean side of the mall on Ala Moana
Boulevard, and one on the mountain side, on Kona Street. Read the
posted sign at the stop to make sure that the line you want is going
where you want to go.
If you want help with planning a specific route, or if you have other ques-
tions pertaining to TheBus system, call % 808-848-5555; information
specialists are available daily between 5:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. Have your
departure and destination points handy when you call, as well as the
time of day you want to travel.
I highly recommend visiting TheBus’s excellent Web site at www.thebus.
org to familiarize yourself with the system before you leave home. It
offers timetables and maps for all routes, plus directions to many local
attractions and a list of upcoming events. (Taking TheBus is sometimes
easier than parking.)
Also, don’t hesitate to ask the front desk or concierge at your hotel for
assistance in navigating TheBus system. And don’t be shy about asking
the bus drivers for help. In general, they’re very friendly and helpful, and
they’ll be glad to point you in the right direction.
If you plan on using TheBus system a lot and want to get to know it well,
pick up one of the handy system reference guides available at any con-
venience store for just a few dollars.
A few etiquette tips for using TheBus:
 When the bus you want approaches, wave to the driver to indicate
that you want to board the bus. Back away from the stop if you
don’t want that particular bus.
 You must have the exact fare when you board the bus because the
drivers don’t make change. You can use either dollar bills or coins.
 To transfer to another line, ask the driver of the first bus you board
for a free transfer when you board. You can’t use a transfer to pick
up the same line going in the same direction, nor can you use a
transfer to go back to where you came from.
 To open the rear door of the bus, push on the door or step on the
first step when the green light is lit. Be sure to hold the door open
as you get off the bus so that your fellow riders don’t get hit by the
slamming door.
Taking the Waikiki Trolley
The Waikiki Trolley (% 800-824-8804 or 808-593-2822; www.waikiki
trolley.com), operated by E Noa Tours, is an open-air, motorized trol-
ley similar to a San Francisco cable car. I like using the trolley; it’s a fun
way to do some sightseeing. The trolley runs along three lines:
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
116

 The Honolulu City (Red) Line runs daily from 10 a.m. to 6:55 p.m. It
makes a loop around Waikiki and downtown Honolulu every 45 min-
utes, stopping at key attractions such as the Duke Kahanamoku
statue, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, Aloha Tower Marketplace,
the Bishop Museum, Hilo Hattie’s, Ward Centre, Ala Moana Center,
and other prime stops.
 The Ala Moana Shopping Shuttle (Pink) Line runs every eight min-
utes daily from 9:30 a.m. to 9:45 p.m. (7:30 p.m. on Sun), stopping at
the DFS Galleria Waikiki, King Kalakaua Plaza, Ala Moana Center,
Ward Centre, and other stops.
 The Ocean Coast (Blue) Line makes its rounds every 45 minutes
daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., connecting Waikiki with East Oahu sites,
including the Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, Diamond Head,
Hanauma Bay, and Sea Life Park. In the morning, there are express
buses running directly from Waikiki to Diamond Head.
 The Honolulu Shopping (Yellow) Line makes its rounds every 45
minutes daily from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. (7 p.m. on Sun), connecting
Ala Moana Center with a variety of locals’ favorite shopping stops,
including the Ward Centre, which is also rich with dining options.
 The Waikele Shuttle (Green) Line takes shoppers out to suburban
Oahu’s premium outlet mall; call for the pickup schedule.
Due to some arcane state rule, trolley passengers are allowed to disem-
bark at Hanauma Bay only for a quick photo op; you aren’t allowed to
use this option to get to and from the marine preserve for a day of snor-
keling. If you want to use the trolley to reach Hanauma Bay, disembark at
Koko Marina Center, where you can either walk the mile to the park or
catch a taxi.
A one-day jump-on, jump-off pass costs $27 for adults, $19 for seniors
over age 62, $16 for military personnel, $13 for kids ages 4 to 11, and $11
for kids riding with military personnel. This pass allows you to hop on
and off all three lines all day long, as much as you want.
A four-day jump-on, jump-off pass gives you unlimited trolley privileges
for four consecutive days for $48 for adults, $28 for seniors, $26 for mili-
tary personnel, $20 for kids 4 to 11, and $15 for kids riding with military
personnel. The four-day pass is a good deal, but you’re probably better
off using TheBus to get around for that many days because the trolley
routes are simply too limited.
Check the Waikiki Trolley Web site, which often offers online purchase
specials. At press time, a four-day pass cost just $39.
You have to purchase your trolley tickets before you board the trolley.
The main customer service kiosk is at the DFS Galleria Waikiki, in the
heart of Waikiki, at the corner of Kalakaua and Royal Hawaiian avenues,
open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday from 8:30
a.m. to 9 p.m. There’s another ticket and information kiosk with more
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 117

limited hours located at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, at Kalia Road and
Ala Moana Boulevard, and at Ala Moana Center, on the ocean side of the
mall. You can also prebook your tickets online (where you might snag a
special discount) or through the toll-free number listed earlier in this
section.
Staying in Style
Frankly, if you’re planning a trip to the liveliest island in the Pacific, you
may as well revel in the energy of it and stay in Waikiki. That said, if you
do want peace and quiet, you can find it on Oahu, too. A number of the
hotels listed in this chapter are located on the quieter fringe of Waikiki,
in less densely developed or residential neighborhoods. And in case
you’d prefer to stay beyond the city and get away from it all, I’ll point
you to a couple of luxury resorts well beyond the reach of Waikiki and
also show you how to book the B&B or vacation rental of your dreams
on the residential Windward Coast or the funky North Shore.
Oahu’s best accommodations
In the following listings, each resort, hotel, or condo name is followed by
a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). Each rep-
resents the median rack-rate price range for a double room per night, as
follows:
$
Cheap — less than $150 per night
$$
Still affordable — $150–$225
$$$
Moderate — $225–$325
$$$$
Expensive but not ridiculous — $325–$450
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious — more than $450 per night
You almost never need to pay the asking price for a hotel room. Check
out Chapter 7 for details on how to avoid paying full price. Also see
Chapter 5 for advice on how to score an all-inclusive package that can
save you big bucks on both accommodations and airfare, and sometimes
car rentals and activities too.
Also, don’t forget that the state adds 11.42 percent in taxes to your hotel
bill.
A number of Waikiki’s inexpensive and midpriced hotels feature rooms
whose bathrooms have showers only, no tubs. If you need a full tub, be
sure to check that one will be available when booking.
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
118

Aqua Palms & Spa
$–$$
Ewa Waikiki
This budget boutique hotel across the street from the much pricier Hilton
Hawaiian Village is a prime choice for wallet-watching travelers in pricey
Waikiki. A charming, freshly decorated lobby leads to studios that are
petite (averaging 325 sq. ft.) but pleasingly outfitted. Every studio, from
moderate to deluxe, boasts a comfortable king-size or queen-size bed and
a microwave, minifridge, coffeemaker, dining utensils, and TV with built-in
DVD. Some units have sleeper sofas and/or private balconies with
Diamond Head and ocean views. Expect a petite bathroom. Value-added
perks include free continental breakfast delivered daily to your guest room
in a Lauhala basket, and free wireless Internet access in the lobby. Service
is consistently courteous and professional, and the on-site AquaSPA offers
pampering at reasonable prices. A pool and fitness center round out the
amenities, but, really, who needs ’em when you’re just 2 blocks from a pre-
mier stretch of Waikiki beach (the same one that pricier Hilton enjoys)?
Next door is an appealingly old-school 24-hour diner. The location, at 
the far end of Waikiki, is a bit removed; plan on a short walk to the heart
of the action. A few tips to maximize your Aqua Palms experience: Rooms
on the Ala Moana side can experience street noise, so ask for a room away
from the boulevard if you’re sensitive. Also ask for a room away from the
elevators, which can be noisy; rooms are not soundproof. And reserve a
small car; the parking spaces are tight.
See map p. 120. 1850 Ala Moana Blvd. (between Hobron Lane and Ewa Road).

Aqua Resorts
Aqua Hotels & Resorts (% 866-406-2782; www.aquaresorts.com) has taken
Waikiki by storm in recent years, bringing a range of affordable, well-located hotels
paired with good service and a dash of style to wallet-conscious travelers. While Hotel
Renew (below) is their “elite” flagship, the rest of their hotels fall into two more afford-
able groups. The six Aqua Boutique hotels ($–$$) have a boutique feel, good service,
and nice perks like high-speed Internet access and free continental breakfast (at
most). My favorite of these is Aqua Palms & Spa (above). Also worth checking out is
the Aqua Coconut Waikiki, which was under dramatic renovation at this writing (com-
plete by the time you arrive). The five Aqua Lite hotels ($) are designed with budget
travelers in mind. These are decidedly smaller, simpler, and a little rougher around the
edges in terms of decor, but they’re clean and well serviced. Many of the Aqua hotels
were undergoing renovation at the time of this writing, or slated for it; I highly recom-
mend opting for a renovated one, especially if your budget is at the Lite level.

The Breakers
$
Mid-Waikiki
This vintage low-rise charmer in the midst of prime high-rise Waikiki is a
wonderful option for budget-minded travelers who don’t want to succumb
to chain-hotel conformity. This lovely two-story ’50s-style garden motel
boasts a friendly staff, a loyal following, a fab location just a two-minute
walk from the beach, and a warmly nostalgic Old Waikiki vibe. Units are
set around an attractive pool and tropical garden blooming with brilliant
hibiscus; wooden jalousies and Japanese-style shoji doors add to the ambi-
ence. The spacious rooms are older — updating is in order — but nicely
maintained, and they boast dated electric-range kitchenettes and lanais
overlooking the pool. The poolside cafe serves up affordable Japanese
food and great mai tais in an attractive outdoor setting. Everything is well
kept, and the hoteliers have managed to maintain an aura of oasis in their
corner of Waikiki. Service is personal and friendly. The Breakers caters 
to visitors from all walks of life, including families. A coin-op laundry is 
on-site.

Embassy Suites — Waikiki Beach Walk
$$$–$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
Run impeccably by the locally based Outrigger hotel company, this new
all-suite hotel is a wonderful addition to the Waikiki hotel scene. It is
located just a block from the beach in the heart of the freshly revitalized
Beach Walk entertainment and shopping zone, now the nicest area of
Waikiki. It’s the first real resort hotel in the Embassy Suites brand, and a
benchmark example of what the brand can be. All of the well-outfitted
rooms are one- and two-bedroom suites, which makes for significantly
more comfortable living than a standard hotel room does — and makes
this hotel a great choice for families. The living room features a sleeper
sofa, a wet bar with minifridge, and a 26-inch flat-panel TV, while bedrooms
feature a king or two double beds and another TV. The island-style decor
is fresh and pretty. The fourth-floor pool is larger and much more appeal-
ing than most non-beachfront pools in Waikiki, and the whole atmosphere
of the hotel is pleasantly energetic (but probably not the best choice for
away-from-it-all honeymooners).
Rates include a generous free breakfast buffet, complete with cooked-to-
order omelet station, and a well-attended nightly manager’s reception with
free drinks, pupus, and live entertainment. Other more-for-your-money
freebies include free Internet access and free (yes, free) local and long-dis-
tance calls within the U.S. and Canada (30-min. limit). The only downside
is that the new ultraluxe Trump hotel is under construction next door until
January 2010; however, even though my room faced the construction, I
barely noticed it during my recent stay.

Halekulani
$$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
The finest hotel in Waikiki is the epitome of gracious and elegant aloha;
the perfect choice for vacationers who only want the best. This open, low-
rise beachfront hotel exudes understated luxury (although some may con-
sider it a tad formal for a beach hotel). The rooms are uniformly oversize
and done in a classy but supremely comfortable natural-on-white style.
Each one features a sitting area, a large furnished lanai, a sumptuous bath-
room with a deep soaking tub and separate oversize shower, and all the
extras you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber, including in-room check-
in, twice-daily maid service, a DVD player, a bedside control panel, and
wireless Internet access. About 90 percent of the rooms have some sort of
ocean view. For the ultimate in understated luxury, book the Vera Wang
Suite, outfitted by the designer herself.
Service is among the best I’ve ever experienced. The concierge can
arrange everything from flowers and leis to limousine service, and often
has complimentary tickets for such cultural institutions as the Bishop
Museum, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, the Honolulu Symphony, and
Iolani Palace on hand. The two elegant oceanfront restaurants are first-
rate, the alfresco lounge is Oahu’s most romantic spot for sunset cocktails
and hula, and the pool is magnificent. The tranquil, sumptuous
SpaHalekulani offers a full range of pampering treatments drawn from
Asian, Hawaiian, and South Pacific healing traditions. Only one niggling
complaint: The beach is small, and the hotel offers only pool service. So if
you want to sit in a chair rather than on a towel, you’re stuck behind a
hedge — and if you want to recline, forget about an ocean view.

Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort & Spa
$$$–$$$$
Ewa Waikiki
Spread out over 22 tropical acres featuring exotic wildlife — including
flamingos, peacocks, and even tropical penguins — and fronting a gor-
geous stretch of beach that feels private even though it’s not, Waikiki’s
biggest resort is my favorite choice for families. It feels like a tropical
theme park, with its own lagoon (with Atlantis submarine rides), four
pools, a wealth of restaurants (including the very good Golden Dragon for
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 123

Chinese, the ultraromantic Bali by the Sea, and Benihana for fun slice-and-
dice teppanyaki dining), enough shopping to stock a midsize mall, a full
slate of bars and lounges, and more — even its own post office. It’s a blast
to stay here. Rooms are housed in multiple towers and range from com-
fortable to first-class depending on what you want to spend, but all are
large, well outfitted, and laden with amenities.
I do have two complaints, however: This place feels as massive as it is, and
the casual dining throughout the hotel is mediocre for a resort charging
such high rack rates. The plush Mandara Spa (www.mandaraspa.com), on
the other hand, is Waikiki’s largest spa, and a real draw. Among the other
pleasing extras is a wonderful program for kids, so your little ones will be
entertained.

Diamond Head Waikiki
This chic boutique hotel, the flagship of the up-and-coming Aqua Hotels
and Resorts group, brings affordable style and great service to Waikiki.
This small hotel is an oasis of Zen-like cool in bustling Waikiki; you can feel
the mood shift as soon as you walk through the doors. The guest rooms
are small, but the hotel compensates with a wealth of special features,
including lovely contemporary decor, furnishings, and artwork; plush pil-
lowtop bedding and bathrobes; bedside lighting controls; 32-inch flat-panel
TVs (with 80-inch projection TVs in some rooms); appealing modern baths
(showers only in some); and free wireless Internet access. My only com-
plaint is that the hallways are rather dour. No pool or bar (a chic bar was
in the works at press time), but there are plenty of restaurants out the
door, and the beach is just a half-block away, across the street. Best for
singles and couples who prize style over space.

Mid-Waikiki
This highly recommended local-style condo hotel is a bargain for families
or anybody who wants accommodations that go above and beyond what

an average hotel can offer. The roomy studios and one-, two-, and three-
bedroom apartments are recently renovated and boast full modern
kitchens with microwave and coffeemaker, new bathrooms, sofa beds in
the living room, and a lanai; one-bedrooms have Jacuzzi tubs too. Extras
include daily maid service (not a given in condo units), free local calls,
high-speed Internet access (in deluxe units), a small heated pool with adja-
cent dry sauna, a rooftop sun deck, an exercise room, and laundry facili-
ties. The service is friendly, and the heart-of-Waikiki location is central to
shopping and dining. The beach is a ten-minute walk away, but at these
prices, you’ll happily put on your walkin’ shoes. A great choice for bargain
travelers of all stripes.

JW Marriott Ihilani Resort & Spa
$$$$
Leeward Oahu
It’s got a lot going for it, but I’m not a huge fan of this resort. It’s a beauti-
fully designed property nestled in a lovely manicured resort with a quar-
tet of white-sand coves that are forever calm for even your littlest ones.
Rooms are extra-large, averaging 660 square feet, and each has a large lanai
and a massive marble bathroom with double vanities, a huge soaking tub,
and a separate shower. Some 85 percent of the rooms boast ocean views.
The excellent 35,000-square-foot Ihilani Spa (with rooftop tennis courts)
has been voted one of the best spas in the world by readers of Condé Nast
Traveler. The food service is terrific throughout the hotel. For the kids, the
Keiki Beachcomber Club offers numerous activities (including outdoor
adventures and a computer center), and for the adults, the Ko Olina Golf
Club boasts 18 challenging holes of Ted Robinson–designed golf.
So what’s my problem? Even with all these amenities, Marriott doesn’t
seem capable of offering a high-quality luxury resort experience — not
here, anyway. Although you do have an ocean view, you may also have an
industrial plant in your line of vision. And I’m still annoyed that I was
assigned a room with a dirty carpet and then told I couldn’t be moved
because no more rooms were available in my rate class (pricier accom-
modations were available) — not exactly what I’d call top-notch service.
Whether you’ll like the way-out-of-town location is up to you, but be pre-
pared for at least a half-hour drive to get just about anywhere. (The hotel
does supply transportation to Waikiki and Ala Moana Shopping Center.)
Best for Marriott fans and points earners.

Kahala Hotel & Resort
$$$$$
Kahala
If you want easy access to Honolulu’s sights but Waikiki sounds too
bustling for you, the Kahala is the perfect compromise. Oahu’s only AAA
five-diamond resort stands just a ten-minute drive east of Waikiki, staked
out on its own perfect crescent beach in one of Honolulu’s most upscale
neighborhoods. (The hotel provides shuttle service to Waikiki and major
shopping centers.) In fact, the tranquil Kahala is ideal for anybody who
likes first-rate service and an ambience that blends T-shirts–and–flip-flops
comfort with gracious elegance. The big, beautiful rooms come with CD
players, high-speed Internet access, goose-down duvets, and high-quality
amenities — including the best bathrooms in the business, with soaking
tubs, separate showers, and his-and-her sinks and dressing areas. Hoku’s,
one of Honolulu’s most celebrated restaurants, is named for the most
charming of the bottlenose dolphins that live on the premises; ask for a
room with a lanai that overlooks the dolphin lagoon and sea, and the world
is yours. Even if you end up in a mountainview room, take heart: The vistas
are almost as fine. The Kahala offers an outstanding spa, a complete fit-
ness center with personal trainers and classes, free use of bicycles, and
complimentary surfing lessons. The poolside desk has books, magazines,
CD players, and hand-held TVs ready for your use, and “beach butlers”
pamper you with towels and a cooling mist while you lounge on the sands.
Romance-seeking couples will love the candlelit Veranda at the music-and-
cocktails hour. The dolphin-encounter program and year-round kids’ club
make the Kahala great for families too.

Moana Surfrider, A Westin Resort
$$$$–$$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
Even with a ’60s extension and a modern tower, this elegant white-clap-
board Victorian — Waikiki’s first hotel, built in 1901 — overflows with
beachy nostalgia. It’s more understated and intimate than Waikiki’s other
historic hotel, the Royal Hawaiian, and now it’s more luxurious, too. In
2007, Starwood made a great decision to upgrade the “First Lady of
Waikiki” from a Sheraton to a Westin, with all of the attendant style and
luxury upgrades, including the addition of Heavenly Beds to all rooms as
well as Waikiki’s first beachfront spa. The transformation should be com-
plete by the time you arrive.
The original U-shaped building embraces a 100-year-old banyan tree and
the ocean beyond. It exudes a magical back-in-time feel that all guests
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
126

share in, even if your room has a stucco ceiling. I recommend the Banyan
rooms, which are small but have high ceilings and loads of historical
charm; for the ultimate old Hawaii vibe, book one with a grand lanai over-
looking the Banyan Courtyard and the turquoise surf beyond. If space or
ocean views win out over retro ambience for you, book in one of the newer
wings, where you’ll get more space and a lanai.
Both the service and the facilities are great, especially now that a state-
of-the-art workout facility has been added. The Banyan Courtyard is the
best place to lounge poolside in Waikiki, period, and I love any excuse —
breakfast, high tea, Sunday brunch — to snag a seat on the oceanfront
veranda, where live music and mai tais set the right island mood every
evening. Another fresh highlight is the addition of the terrific Beachhouse,
a stylish oceanfront steakhouse serving Amish-raised and Kobe-style beef.
Other winning features include a guests-only beach area with full cocktail
service on one of Waikiki’s finest stretches of sand.

New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel
$$
Diamond Head Waikiki
Located at the quietest, prettiest end of Waikiki, this boutique hotel is the
neighborhood’s best beachfront bargain. It sits right on the locals’ favorite
stretch of Waikiki Beach, Sans Souci, with leafy Kapiolani Park and
Diamond Head at its back door, which means that the views are pleasing
in almost any direction. The park’s jogging path and tennis courts are right
at hand. An inviting open-air lobby leads to contemporary rooms that are
more Holiday Inn than stylish, but are perfectly comfortable. The most
basic rooms are tiny, so spring for a superior one if you can. The junior
suites are large enough for families, and corner rooms boast Waikiki’s
finest views. The airy lobby opens onto the Hau Tree Lanai, a wonderfully
romantic restaurant that sits right on the sand; great breakfasts make it
the right place to start the day even if you’re not staying here. Amenities
include VCRs, minifridges, and a coin-op laundry. Many regular visitors
who can afford it camp out in the well-priced suites, almost all of which
are sizable and offer lovely views. Units in the Diamond Head wing are
ideal for longer stays because they add a microwave and coffeemaker to
the mix. This is one of my favorite midpriced hotels — an excellent value
on all fronts.

Ohana Waikiki Beachcomber
$$$
Mid-Waikiki
First-rate package deals and online discounts make this attractive, beauti-
fully maintained, and well-located hotel — just 297 steps from the beach —
an excellent value. It lies in the heart of Waikiki’s gentrified main drag,
across the street from the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. The lovely,
open Hawaii-style lobby is located on the second floor, which keeps it
blissfully free of bustle from the street; tropical floral arrangements add a
splash of elegance. Rooms are freshly renovated with a pretty tropical
motif, alder and cherrywood furnishings, 32-inch flat-screen TVs,
minifridges, completely updated bathrooms with granite countertops, pri-
vate lanais, and a nice island-style feeling. One- and two-bedroom suites
are a great choice for families. Housekeeping is impeccable. The Moana
side of the building scores you gorgeous partial ocean views. Also on-site
are a nice pool and Jacuzzi, a cafe, and a coin-op laundry. Complimentary
high-speed Internet access is a perk for laptop-toters. A top-notch
midrange choice. As if you needed another selling point, Jimmy Buffet’s at
the Beachcomber, a new restaurant from the Margaritaville man himself,
is slated to be open and rockin’ by the time you read this. This is also home
of illusionist John Horikawa’s Magic of Polynesia show (see Chapter 11).

Ohana Hotels & Resorts
In addition to Ohana Waikiki Beachcomber, Ohana Hotels & Resorts ($$), owned and
operated by the excellent island-based Outrigger Hotels & Resorts, features value-
minded hotels throughout Honolulu. They are all highly recommendable and within
walking distance of Waikiki Beach. If you’re looking for affordable sleeps, it’s hard to
go wrong with Ohana. These hotels are a bit less sexy than budget upstart Aqua Hotels

reliability for wallet-watching travelers. Most of these properties regularly offer excel-
lent Internet specials, discounts, an assortment of packages, and nice value-added
perks like free Internet access. For more information, call % 800-462-6262 or surf your

public spaces and transformed the guest rooms into some of the most
beautiful in Waikiki, the substantially upgraded Reef has become one of
my favorite choices in Waikiki.
This is a big hotel, with three towers connected by the lobby, but its gener-
ous open-air lobby maximizes the ocean breeze and its warm, personalized
service belies its mega size. A restored hundred-year-old canoe hangs at the
entrance, announcing the cultural infusion the hotel has received. Across
from the new sit-down check-in desk — where staff wears beautifully under-

gant guest rooms, which feature elegant Polynesian tapa-patterned fabrics,
textured walls and carpets, vibrant underwater photography on the walls,

the spirit of hospitality that pervades the hotel. Amenities include beautiful

On-site is a big freshwater pool, three spas, a pleasing three-meal restau-

full-service Serenity Spa Hawaii (www.serenityhawaii.com) for pamper-

time, and the public spaces were close to done; all renovations should be
complete by early 2009.

Outrigger Regency on Beachwalk
$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
Hidden behind an unassuming facade in the heart of the revitalized Beach
Walk development lies one of Waikiki’s most stylish gems. This boutique
condo hotel has the feel of an upscale private residence. The elevator will
whisk you up to your private apartment, where you’ll find chic but com-
fortable contemporary decor warmed up with the use of zesty accent
colors, and plenty of space for wholly satisfying Waikiki living. The one-bed-
room apartments are around 600 square feet; two-bedrooms are closer to
800 square feet. Each apartment features a loft-style main room with choco-
late-wood floors and cabinetry, a smart sectional sleeper sofa, a flat-panel
TV, floor-to-ceiling windows leading out to the lanai, a tiled open kitchen
complete with stainless steel appliances (full-size fridge, cook top,
microwave, dishwasher), a dining table for four, and all of the accouter-
ments you’ll need to serve a full meal. The bedrooms are on the petite side
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 129

but smartly and comfortably outfitted. Ditto for the white marble and wood
bathrooms, which feature gorgeous vessel sinks. Even though these are
apartments, they are serviced like a hotel. Perks include free Internet access
and use of the pool at the nearby Outrigger Reef. Great for small families or
couples looking for an intersection of form and function that few hotels
offer. The only downsides of note: Beds are queens only (kings wouldn’t fit),
bathrooms feature showers only (no tubs), and views are minimal, so I don’t
advise spending the extra money on a partial ocean view.

Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach
$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
I’ll make no bones about it — I prefer the gorgeously renovated Outrigger
Reef, just down the beach. Still, I like this 16-story oceanfront hotel, too,
because of the prime location and the discounted rates and value-added
package deals frequently on offer. This Outrigger sits in the center square,
right in the heart of the party on Waikiki’s absolute best stretch of beach.
The guest rooms are attractive, with lovely bathrooms. (Fifteen special
oceanfront rooms have oceanfront bathtubs for the ultimate relaxing soak!)
Even the standard units are large and comfortable, with big closets, good
amenities (fridge, hair dryer, and coffeemaker), and spacious lanais. The
lobby and public areas honor Hawaiian history while maintaining a fresh
tropical look. Facilities include a fitness center, an oceanfront pool and
Jacuzzi, a round-the-clock self-serve business center, and plenty of shops
and restaurants — including one of my Waikiki faves, Duke’s Canoe Club.
There’s also a Seattle’s Best Coffee, plus the Hula Grill Waikiki (another one
of my favorites), boasting sunset views over the ocean. Service is consis-
tently satisfying. Be on the lookout for an upcoming renovation.

Outrigger Waikiki Shore
$$$–$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
Operated by Hawaii’s homegrown Outrigger hotel chain, Waikiki’s only
beachfront condo option is a wonderful choice for families looking for 
at-home comforts in an on-the-sand location. The individually decorated
one- and two-bedroom condos feature full kitchens with microwave and
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu

dishwasher (studios have kitchenettes), air-conditioning and ceiling fans,
washer/dryers, and big lanais. Both one- and two-bedroom units come
with either one or two bathrooms; ask for your preference. Daily maid
service makes it feel like a real vacation. Because full-time residents live
here, the complex tends to be quiet, and security is tight. Outrigger guests
have access to the concierge, pool, 24-hour self-serve business center, fit-
ness room, Starbucks, and full-service Serenity Spa Hawaii (www.serenity
hawaii.com) at the adjacent Outrigger Reef, where you’ll check in and
check out. Reservations are hard to get — book way in advance.

Patrick Winston’s Waikiki Condos
$–$$
Mid-Waikiki
Pat Winston deals in budget apartments, so you won’t get the condo 
equivalent of the Ritz, but you will find great value for your dollars here.
This friendly man manages two dozen clean, comfortable suites in a well-
kept, five-story, garden-apartment building with attractive landscaping. It’s
located on a quiet, central-to-everything street just 2 blocks from the
beach. Each of the individually decorated units has a sofa bed, a furnished
lanai overlooking the kitschy-cute tropical courtyard and pool, air-condi-
tioning and ceiling fans, a full kitchen with microwave, and a private bath-
room (with shower only). Most condos have washer/dryers (coin-op
facilities are also on-site). Pat does all the renovation, maintenance, and
cleaning himself, and he does a great job. Bursting with aloha spirit, Pat
goes the extra mile to do what he can — book activities, make restaurant
recommendations, and so on — to make sure that you go home happy.
Book well in advance.

ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Hotel
$$$
Mid-Waikiki
This hotel has won kudos from Travel + Leisure magazine as one of the
best affordable beach resorts in the world. That’s a bit of an overstate-
ment, but it’s still a good choice when the deals are flowing in your direc-
tion. The hotel is a monster, with 644 rooms; but 85 percent of them offer
ocean views, and the location can hardly be better — my favorite stretch
of Waikiki Beach is just across the street. The style is Hawaiian nostalgia
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 131

with a modern flair; it’s fun and funky, but the Day-Glo colors may be a bit
much for some. Also, rooms are tiny — just 225 square feet, with junior
suites running 300 square feet — and maintenance can be less than impec-
cable. The furnishings are tropical and fun, if a little less practical than I
would like. For example, the closets have a beaded hula dancer curtain
that sways when the trade winds blow through your room; however, the
beads can be a hassle when you’re trying to get to your clothes. Still, the
hotel’s prime location and money-saving deals can make up for a lot if
you’re pinching pennies. And on-site dining options are good: Tiki’s Bar &
Grill is an oceanview gem for cocktails, pupus, and live music; Wolfgang
Puck Express gives you instant affordable access to the master’s creative
California fare; and Cold Stone Creamery is the ice-cream star of the
Waikiki strip. Practical perks include an on-site coin-operated laundry,
complimentary continental breakfast complete with cooler totes so you
can take yours to the beach, and a small but appealing pool.

ResortQuest Waikiki Joy Hotel
$$
Mid-Waikiki
This dated but pleasing hotel features a Jacuzzi tub and a Bose entertain-
ment system in every room — otherwise unheard of for these prices. The
open-air lobby sets the scene for bright, clean-lined, comfortable guest
rooms, each with a marble entryway, a fridge, a coffeemaker, and a lanai
that’s wide enough for you to sit and enjoy the views while you listen to
your stereo; some suites have wet bars, and others have full kitchens. A
cafe, laundry, and a furnished deck with heated pool and sauna are on-site,
plus a karaoke studio if you’re in the mood. In the negative column, the
beach is a good 4 blocks away — but cheer up, the free breakfast makes a
good deal even better.

Royal Hawaiian
$$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
This shocking-pink oasis hidden among blooming gardens in the heart of
Waikiki has been the symbol of Hawaiian luxury since 1927. Now managed
by Starwood, it still exudes glamour and elegance, recalling a time when
travelers arrived by Matson Line ships rather than jumbo jet, with steamer
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu

trunks instead of nylon totes in tow. The hotel sits right in the heart of the
action on Waikiki’s most exciting stretch of sand. You couldn’t dream up a
better location. Overall, I prefer the Moana Surfrider (listed earlier in this
chapter), but the Royal brims with nostalgic appeal, as its legions of loyal
fans will tell you.
Every guest room is lovely, and I have a real soft spot for the Historic wing.
You’ll likely end up in a modern room if you want an ocean view, but the
period vibe persists.
The hotel closed on June 1, 2008, in order to undergo a six-month renova-
tion that should only make a great thing even more spectacular.
Renovations are set to include a grand new entryway, a luxury makeover
to the grounds, three new pools, upgraded guest rooms in the main
(Historic) building, and new restaurant concepts. Perks include lei greet-
ings, poolside bar service, a romantic luau (Waikiki’s best), and one of
Waikiki’s most intimate and pleasing spas. At press time, the grand reopen-
ing was scheduled for January 2009. Check the Web site or call the hotel
for the latest.

Turtle Bay Resort
$$$$–$$$$$
North Shore
Situated dead center on 5 miles of beautiful beachfront, this resort hotel
boasts a prime North Shore location that lets travelers who’d rather
eschew Waikiki have it all: a full-service resort in a pleasingly out-of-the-
way location. This hotel has a lot more going for it, too, including a 
fabulous special-occasion restaurant, 21 Degrees North, featuring a con-
temporary island menu, marvelous martinis, and drop-dead gorgeous
views; Ola’s, a better-than-expected open-air three-meal beachside restau-
rant; two top-flight championship golf courses (one designed by Arnold
Palmer, the other by George Fazio); a spa; and access to a wealth of activ-
ities, including horseback riding, hiking trails, and surfing lessons. In the
winter, when the surf’s up, you can watch big-wave daredevils in action at
the legendary nearby beaches; in summer, the glassy waters of the North
Shore make an ideal water playground for everyone. Accommodations,
ranging from guest rooms to luxury beach cottages and multibedroom
oceanfront condos, offer something for everyone.
The downside is that the guest rooms are way out of date, worn, and in
serious need of upgrading. They’re sizable but feel almost empty; the only
chairs in the room were the two upright chairs at the desk, which were in
desperate need of recovering in mine.
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 133

The gorgeous beach cottages, set a five-minute walk from the main hotel,
are the way to go for couples and small families. These semi-attached cot-
tages are generous studio-style units with vaulted ceilings, sunken living
rooms, redwood floors, white marble baths with an oversize soaking tub
and separate shower, and a nicely furnished lanai with wonderful ocean
views and direct beach access. Freshly done in the last couple of years,
they’re in very nice shape.
Alternatively, larger families can opt for the beautifully outfitted three- or
four-bedroom ocean villas, which are luxurious beachfront condos built
for long-term living. Expect all the perks here, including full luxury kitchens
(think granite and SubZero), a comfy living room complete with oversize
TV and surround sound, plus TVs in every bedroom; washers and dryers;
and their own fully furnished private lanais.

Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa
$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
I really like this hotel; kudos to Marriott for creating such a delightful place
to stay. It’s spectacularly located, directly across the street from the newly
renovated stretch of Waikiki Beach, with no buildings blocking views or
access, and only steps from Kapiolani Park. The 1,300-room hotel is mas-
sive, but a tropically furnished open-air lobby adds a sense of cohesion,
not to mention an inviting place to lounge with your morning coffee (a
Seattle Coffee Roasters is on-site). The hotel is also home to one of Hawaii’s
most attractive spas, the Spa Olakino & Salon, where you’ll feel that you’ve
just stepped into a glorious rain-forest retreat overlooking the sands.
All the guest rooms have been given the royal treatment, with quality fur-
nishings and high-speed Internet access. The fine textiles come in eye-
catching tropicals, and the feather beds are more comfy than most
available at any price. The 600-square-foot family room sleeps up to six
comfortably and features two queen-size beds, two twin beds, and a sitting
area; a few even have a second bathroom. More family-friendly perks: Not
only can kids stay in their parent’s room, but a rollaway or crib is provided
free of charge. The staffed Kids Salon playroom offers Mom and Dad both
day and evening respite from the little ones. Each of the two towers boasts
its own pleasant and popular pool deck; there’s also a 24-hour fitness
center. The Kuhio Beach Grille is a pleasing and affordably priced place to
dine; Sansei and d.k Steak House serve up Waikiki views along with menus
designed by D.K. Kodama, one of Hawaii’s most acclaimed chefs, who
deserves his own kudos for bringing first-rate dining to the heart of Waikiki.

Waikiki Parc
$$$
Mid-Waikiki
This sister hotel to the ultradeluxe Halekulani is the ideal choice for trav-
elers looking for impeccable service, high-design chic, and little luxuries
at affordable rates, plus a terrific at-the-beach location. Now that the new
Beach Walk shopping-and-entertainment redevelopment is complete, the
location is better than ever. What’s more, you can almost always secure
an excellent package that improves an already-good value. A high-concept,
media-drenched, nightclub-reminiscent lobby leads to comfy, contempo-
rary guest rooms. Boasting an Asian-tinged island vibe, the stylish rooms
feature chic ebony woods and rattan, tile floors, plush carpeting, sitting
areas, lanais with louvered shutters (go for an ocean view if you can —
they’re fabulous), minifridges, flatscreen TVs, bold artwork, and nice-size
bathrooms. It’s worth paying for a deluxe ocean view if you can score a
good rate. Amenities include concierge and room service; a coin-op laun-
dry as well as valet service; and a gracious staff that doesn’t skimp on sig-
nature Halekulani service. Elevating the Waikiki Parc to must-visit status is
Nobu Waikiki, the first Hawaii venture from internationally acclaimed
Japanese chef Nobu Matsuhisa. The hotel has an outdoor heated rooftop
pool, but why bother? The sand is 100 yards away, via a beach-access walk-
way. Not necessarily for those who don’t prize chic.

The Wyland Waikiki
$$$
Mid-Waikiki
This first artist-themed hotel in Hawaii is a wonderful new addition to the
Waikiki hotel scene. Run by Waikiki’s hometown hotel brand Outrigger, the
property is inspired (and design directed) by ocean artist Wyland, who is
world-renowned for his artful expressions of marine life.
Even if you don’t know who Wyland is, I encourage you to consider this
appealing boutique-style property, which evokes the ocean world at every
turn in its attractive contemporary design. A beautiful palm-dotted court-
yard with a small but lush and pretty lava rock–walled pool area gives the
property a feeling of oasis in bustling Waikiki. In addition to about $4 mil-
lion of Wyland’s work, you’ll find water elements throughout the hotel,
including a dramatic coral fish tank in the light, open lobby.
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 135

Rooms are not huge, but they are fresh, contemporary, and attractive, with
a sage-and-cream palette and creative touches from Wyland at every turn,
including a kissing fish pattern on the bedcover (custom designed for the
hotel) and a Wyland print on the wall. Nice features include plush pillowtop
beds, small lanais, an iPod-compatible alarm clock, and minifridges; many
rooms have kitchenettes with microwave and wet bar. Unfortunately, the
upgraded bathrooms are petite, and all but suites have small showers only.
On-site is a cute Italian restaurant as well as the KimoBean Coffee Company,
a sleek coffee bar serving only island roasts. You’ll also find an all-new fit-
ness room, a day spa, a business center, and the “Chill” room, featuring an
oversize flat-panel TV, Nintendo, and massage chairs free for guests’ use.
Guests benefit from the standard Outrigger perks, including free Internet
access and free local and long-distance calls. You’ll have a ten-minute walk
to the beach, but this corner of Waikiki is both central and quiet.

Dining Out
Hawaii has become a culinary mecca in recent years, attracting world-
wide attention for its growing constellation of star chefs and its unique
brand of Pacific Rim cooking — known as Hawaii Regional Cuisine,
Hawaii Island, or just Island cuisine. Honolulu, as you may expect, is the
epicenter of this fabulous foodie revolution, so expect to eat well while
you’re here. Of course, the good stuff doesn’t come cheap, but great
affordable choices abound as well.
In the restaurant listings that follow, the emphasis is on Waikiki and
Honolulu, because (a) that’s where you’re likely to spend most of your
time, and (b) that’s where most of Oahu’s restaurants are located. But 
I also include some excellent options for North Shore and Windward
Coast dining.
Each restaurant review is followed by a number of dollar signs, ranging
from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar signs give you an idea of what 
a complete dinner for one person — including appetizer, main course,
dessert, one drink, tax, and tip — is likely to set you back. The price 
categories go like this:
$
Cheap eats — less than $20 per person
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$35
$$$
Moderate — $35–$50
$$$$
Pricey — $50–$75
$$$$$
Ultraexpensive — more than $75 per person
Of course, cost all depends on how you order, so stay away from the surf
and turf or the north end of the wine list if you’re watching your budget.
To give you a further idea of how much you can expect to spend, I also
include the price range of main courses in the listings. (Keep in mind
that prices can change at the whim of the management, so call before
you go if you want to confirm the price range.)
The state adds roughly 4 percent in taxes to every restaurant bill. The
percentage may vary slightly depending on the county you’re in, and
may be embedded in the total purchase price or shown as an independ-
ent line item on your bill. A 15 to 20 percent tip is standard in Hawaii,
just as in the rest of the States.

Alan Wong’s Restaurant
$$$$–$$$$$
Honolulu
Hawaii Regional
If there is one master of true Hawaii Regional Cuisine, it is Alan Wong —
and his restaurant offers a world-class experience. Koa, rattan, and other
tropical touches create a real Hawaiian ambience in the warmly contem-
porary dining room, which serves as an ideal showcase for Wong’s mas-
terful elevation of the local culinary tradition. Expect perfectly prepared
island fish bursting with clean, fresh flavors; Asian accents galore (the sea-
weed-wrapped tempura big-eye ahi with soy mustard is magnificent); and
modernist takes on island favorites: Ginger-crusted onaga (red snapper) is
adorned with a light miso-sesame vinaigrette, and luau pork accompanies
baby romaine, poi, and anchovy dressing in a delightful twist on a classic
Caesar. Cap off your meal with a beautifully crafted dessert like the deca-
dent chocolate crunch bars (layers of milk chocolate macadamia crunch
and bittersweet chocolate mousse) and a fine selection of island coffees.
Service is appropriately sophisticated yet completely unpretentious. No
wonder Gourmet magazine named this number 8 of America’s Top 50
restaurants. Book well in advance.
See map p. 138. 1857 S. King St. (11⁄2 blocks west of McCully Street), 3rd Floor,
Honolulu. % 808-949-2526. www.alanwongs.com. Reservations highly recom-
mended (online reservations accepted). To get there: Take Kalakaua west from
Waikiki and turn right on S. King Street. Main courses: $26–$42. 5-course tasting
menu: $75 ($105 with wines); 7-course tasting menu: $95 ($135 with wines). AE, DC,
MC, V. Open: Dinner nightly.
Arancino/Arancino di Mare

Mid-Waikiki
Northern Italian
If Arancino can draw island residents into the heart of Waikiki, you know
that it has to be good. This intimate and affordable trattoria-style Italian
restaurant is hugely popular with Japanese visitors, mainlanders, and

In search of Hawaii cuisine
If you’re a foodie who really wants an insider’s view on island-style dining, don’t miss
the opportunity to spend a day or an evening with Hawaii Food Tours (% 800-715-2468
or 808-926-3663; www.hawaiifoodtours.com). Matthew Gray, a former chef, food
critic, and restaurant reviewer for Hawaii’s largest daily newspaper, offers a trio of
excellent tours that let food-obsessed travelers experience true Hawaii cuisine —
including the full palate of international cuisines that add color and flavor to the islands.
My day spent with Matthew and his lively and knowledgeable partner, Keira (also a
former chef), was one of my all-time favorite Hawaii experiences. Tours are usually
offered daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and the $99 per-person cost is well worth it for
adventurous foodies. Call or visit the Web site for complete tour details, as well as the
other exciting culinary adventures offered by Matthew and Keira.

locals alike, all of whom bond over their love of good Italian food. Creative
pizzas and pastas, homemade risottos, and fresh island seafood make up
a simple but very appealing menu that delivers on all counts. With bur-
nished terra-cotta walls, tile floors, and red-checked cloths on the tables,
the charming room is inviting, and friendly service caps it all off. You’ll
probably find a line when you arrive — but the excellent value is worth
the wait. There’s now a second location at the Waikiki Beach Marriott, near
the Diamond Head end of Waikiki.

Brew Moon
$$
Ala Moana
Eclectic
A comfortable-chic setting, satisfying contemporary pub food, and even
better microbrews have made Brew Moon into a comfortable favorite
among locals and visitors alike. This trendy spot won’t exactly wow the
gourmands among you, but the casual eats are nicely prepared and boast
a winning island flair. Brew Moon’s celebrated handcrafted beers (like the
Orion red ale, an amber brew with a robust caramel flavor) wash down
offerings like coconut shrimp, fire-roasted ribs, sesame-seared ahi, veggie
stir-fry, and thick-crust Luau pizza (topped with smoke-roasted pulled
pork, roasted garlic, and Maui onion) perfectly. A full selection of salads,
sandwiches, burgers, and creative pizzas complements the array of globe-
trotting small plates, making this a good place to come with a group and
share. Tiki torches flicker on the pleasant lanai after the sun goes down,
and live jazz and R&B set a festive mood every night. Brew Moon is a wi-fi
hotspot, so you can check your e-mail during the daily happy hour.
See map p. 140. In Ward Centre, 1200 Ala Moana Blvd. (between Kamakee and Queen
streets), Honolulu. % 808-593-0088. Reservations accepted. Sharing plates, sand-
wiches, and pizzas: $8–$19. Main courses: $18–$26. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Lunch and
dinner daily (bar open late).
Buzz’s Original Steak House
$$–$$$
Windward Coast
American
This Windward Coast fixture exudes casual local style — and the food is
really good, too, making Buzz’s a perennial favorite among visitors and
locals alike since 1962. The pleasing restaurant is housed in a little grass
shack across from Kailua’s gorgeous beach park; a small covered deck with
(limited) beach views, a varnished koa bar, rattan furniture, and wood-pan-
eled walls adorned with surf photos set the ideal tropical tone. Lunch is
well-prepared, straightforward fare: steak sandwiches, fresh fish (always
a beautifully prepared local catch), and teriyaki burgers. Dinner is pricier
but worth it; expect traditional steakhouse fare — including well-grilled
sirloins, rack of lamb, and teriyaki chicken — plus a soup and salad bar.
Service is always welcoming, and the tropical cocktails are everything they
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 143

should be. Don’t pass on starting with the yummy artichoke “surprise” —
you won’t be disappointed. Note: Despite the at-the-beach location, shoes
and shirts are required.
See map p. 162. 413 Kawailoa Rd. (across from Kailua Beach Park, just past the bridge
that leads to Lanikai Beach), Kailua. % 808-261-4661. Reservations highly recom-
mended for dinner. Main courses: $8–$16 at lunch, $15–$34 at dinner. No credit cards.
Open: Lunch and dinner daily.

Mid-Waikiki
Caribbean-Mexican
Finding a great meal in Waikiki without overspending isn’t easy, but this
tropical charmer does the job well. This small indoor-outdoor restaurant
is set back from the street, but establishes a colorful tropical presence 
on the patio with vibrant red and yellow umbrellas. The kitchen takes
Mexican staples and globe-trots them across the tropics — witness such
dishes as lava-grilled chicken fajitas, a Jamaican jerk chicken quesadilla,
blackened mahi burritos, and the delectable Pacifico quesadilla (grilled
mahi in a spinach tortilla, topped with papaya-pineapple salsa). Dishes are
always boldly flavored, authentically spiced, and artistically presented,
with drizzled sauces on colorful plates. Here you can also find a help-your-
self wall of hot sauces for zesty palates, well-blended margaritas, not one
but two Happy Hours (4–6 p.m. and again 9–11 p.m.), and a kids’ menu.
See map p. 138. 342 Seaside Ave. (between Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues). % 808-
923-7797. Reservations not accepted. Main courses: $7.50–$16. MC, V. Open: Lunch
and dinner daily.
Chai’s Island Bistro
$$$$
Downtown/Aloha Tower Marketplace
Euro/Pacific Rim
Chef/owner Chai Chaowasaree uses this attractive California-style restau-
rant as an outlet for cross-cultural innovation, and it’s an appealing place
to dine. The Pan-Asian influences lean heavily on the Thai tradition, as evi-
denced by organically grown local greens with balsamic tamarind vinai-
grette and grilled fresh island mahimahi dressed in a zippy red curry
sauce. Those with more timid palates will enjoy the Continental-style
plates, such as grilled beef tenderloin in a shiitake-Chianti demi-glace, plus
Mediterranean-influenced pastas and risottos. The food is too pricey, but
nightly entertainment by some of Hawaii’s most celebrated musicians —
such as the excellent Olomana and the legendary Brothers Cazimero —
softens the blow appreciably.
See map p. 140. Aloha Tower Marketplace, 1 Aloha Tower Dr., just south of down-
town Honolulu.% 808-585-0011. www.chaisislandbistro.com. Reservations

courses: $13–$32 at lunch, $28–$48 at dinner (most under $40). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:

Cheeseburger in Paradise/Cheeseburger Waikiki
$
Diamond Head Waikiki/Ewa Waikiki
American
Located just across the street from a prime stretch of Waikiki Beach,
Cheeseburger in Paradise is a fun, funky outpost of the wildly successful
Maui burger joint (not part of the mainland chain owned by Jimmy Buffett)
and the perfect spot for a casual sit-down meal. A second Honolulu branch,
Cheeseburger Waikiki, is located at the opposite end of the beach; it’s open
24 hours a day to satisfy those late-night munchies. At both restaurants,
the tropical-style gourmet burgers are big, juicy, and served on fresh-baked
buns. The bar mixes first-rate tropical cocktails — including one of the
best piña coladas in the islands — and the attractive retro-Hawaii decor
makes for an enjoyable kitschfest. Chili dogs, a tender and healthy chicken
breast sandwich, crispy onion rings, coconut shrimp, and spiced fries
broaden the menu, and vegetarians can opt for the terrific garden burger,
a tofu burger, or a meal-size salad. You can even greet the morning here,
with hearty omelets, French toast, eggs Benedict, and other breakfast
favorites. The food is universally satisfying.

Chef Mavro
$$$$$
Honolulu
Hawaii Regional
Marseilles transplant and James Beard award–winner George Mavro-
thalassitis has long been considered one of Hawaii’s finest chefs, and he
brings a one-of-a-kind Provençal-Mediterranean accent to the Hawaii
Regional table. The menu changes every three months to maximize local
ingredients and keep things fresh and exciting for everyone. The onaga
(long-tailed snapper) is prepared laulau-style (wrapped in ti leaves along
with garlic shoots, fresh water chestnuts, Maui onions, and a fragrant
fennel-basil sauce), which results in a deliciously moist fish. A rich roasted
Sonoma duckling breast is served with tarragon and yogurt pearl barley
and ginger-mango jus.
The menu even goes a delightful step further, matching each and every
dish with the perfect glass of wine selected not by a lone authoritarian
wine snob but by a vote of the restaurant’s entire staff after blind tastings;
it’s a uniquely democratic system that prevails with every pairing. The
clean-lined, candlelit setting is simple, elegant, and romantic, and the
sociable, well-informed waitstaff couldn’t be more spot-on. A premier
dining experience from start to finish. I like Alan Wong’s better, but Chef
Mavro is an excellent second choice.
See map p. 138. 1969 S. King St. (at McCully Street), Honolulu. % 808-944-4714. www.

Diamond Head Market & Grill
$
Honolulu (just north of Diamond Head Waikiki)
Local
This unassuming little takeout joint serves up gourmet plate lunches at a
bustling window. Chef/owner Kevin Ro has a rarified pedigree as award-
winning chef of the Kahala Moon restaurant and personal chef for former
state governor Ben Cayetano. But now he cooks for the masses, serving
up local-style main courses, sandwiches, and salads with gourmet flavor
and style on takeout Styrofoam. The extensive menu includes such stars
as Korean-style kalbi ribs, grilled salmon in a not-too-sweet teriyaki glaze,
Chinese-style char siu pork, and Ro’s famous grilled portobello mushroom.
All of the lunch plates come with your choice of white or brown rice, plus
a simple garden salad dressed in lemon vinaigrette (a nice change of pace
from the usual macaroni salad). Come in the morning hours to dig into
delectable coconut pancakes, grilled ahi and eggs, roast pork hash and
eggs, or Hawaiian sweet bread French toast. You can enjoy your takeout at
the available picnic tables, or carry it back to the beach or to nearby
Kapiolani Park. It’s also an easy stop before or after a hike up Diamond
Head. A wonderful local find. The simple adjacent market is a great place
to supplement your picnic basket with bottled water and/or a fine selec-
tion of cheeses, deli meats, or after-meal sweets.

d.k Steak House
$$$$$
Mid-Waikiki
Japanese/Pacific Rim Seafood
Sushi superstar D.K. Kodama has wowed Hawaii dining with his winning
Sansei sushi restaurants (see review later in this chapter) — so he’s turned
his attention to the venerable steak, another true love of his. Kodama’s
steakhouse stays true enough to tradition to please classicists, but adds
enough creative twists to loosen the mood and suit Waikiki’s casual flavor.
The steakhouse has its own dry-aging room, which means perfectly tender,
dry-aged prime beef. The specialty of the house is the beautifully seasoned,
on-the-bone rib-eye, but I also love the melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon,
dressed in your choice of a shiitake mushroom demi-glace or the house-
made béarnaise. Sides come steakhouse-style; highlights include crispy
onion rings and Milanese-style asparagus, broiled with a farm-fresh egg and
truffle oil. This being Hawaii, you can expect fabulous surf-and-turf combos.
Master sommelier Chuck Furuya has assembled an excellent wine list for all
budgets and tastes, including a terrific by-the-glass list. Comfort foods like
a yummy burger and Mom Kodama’s meatloaf both create more casual
options and allow wallet-watchers to keep the bill down. A kids’ menu
makes d.k’s a nice special-dinner choice for families too.

Duke’s is everything that Waikiki dining should be, complete with sarong-

a kid-friendly choice for families, a romantic lair for lovers, a magnet for
Hawaiian music fans, and a hot spot for party hoppers. The menu deserves
high marks, too, from the fresh-caught local fish (with a half-dozen prepa-
rations to choose from) to the succulent prime rib. I particularly love the
poke rolls, made with sushi-grade ruby-red ahi, to start. Duke’s is also well-
loved for its Barefoot Bar, with a mile-long drink menu, budget-friendly food,
and top-notch island music nightly. It’s a great place to watch the sunset.

This exotic import from San Francisco is a winning addition to the

garnered two awards from Honolulu magazine in 2006: a gold award for
best ambience and a silver nod for best new restaurant overall. And the
accolades are just: E&O offers all of the elements of a thoroughly enjoy-
able dining experience. Brightly hued art and accents, including colorful

small and big plates, good for easy sharing. Menu stars include Indonesian
corn fritters in a zesty chili-soy dipping sauce; char siu–style smoked mero,
smoked sea bass prepared Korean barbecue–style; delectable salt-and-
pepper-crusted calamari; and a variety of spice-grilled satays and Indian-

Giovanni’s Original White Shrimp Truck
$
North Shore
Seafood
In recent years, a uniquely scrumptious cottage industry has arisen in
Kahuku, a rural oceanside outpost on the way to the North Shore’s surf
meccas: the Kahuku shrimp truck. Shrimp farmers cultivate ponds in this
region that produce some of the biggest, plumpest, sweetest shrimp you’ll
ever enjoy. You’ll find a string of shrimp trucks along the ocean side of
Kamehameha Highway. Best of the bunch is Giovanni’s, which specializes
in an aromatically delicious shrimp scampi that is far superior to nearby
Romy’s (which is actually a shrimp shack) in freshness and garlicky good-
ness. In fact, the scampi is so palette-pleasing that Giovanni’s was recently
visited by NPR’s The Splendid Table radio show.
You’ll order at the window and receive your generous paper-plate meal to
enjoy at an adjoining simple but pleasant covered picnic area. Plates come
with two scoops of rice and a dozen shrimp. In addition to scampi, you
can also choose lemon and butter or hot and spicy (“Super hot, no
refunds!”). Bathrooms are available.
Giovanni’s has a second North Shore truck in Haleiwa, just before the junc-
tion with Highway 99, next to the Chocolate Gecko Espresso cafe and
across from McDonald’s.

North Shore/Windward Coast
Seafood
This pleasing seafood grill really embodies the North Shore vibe. It’s
friendly and easygoing, with a casual, surf-inspired vibe and straightfor-
ward, lovingly prepared seafood (fish-phobes can enjoy a tasty grilled
steak). The day’s catches are served either lightly coated in herbs, bread
crumbs, and the house roasted garlic spread, or grilled and served with
Asian inspiration in a wonton bowl (called “lumpia” in the islands). The
crunchy coconut shrimp, served with a plum and honey mustard dipping
duo, is a sweet and sour treat. Main courses come with a salad starter for
a mere $3, which adds to the good value. The wine list is also reasonably
priced relative to other restaurants on the island. Portions are generous,
and the atmosphere is pleasingly unfussy; grab a seat on the harbor-view
patio for a genuinely enjoyable and satisfying evening. If you’re in the
mood to party, come on Friday and stay for the late-night live music (usu-
ally starting at 10:30 p.m.). There’s an attractive second location in
Kaneohe for those staying on the island’s Windward Coast, also with live
tunes on Fridays.

Hau Tree Lanai
$$$
Diamond Head Waikiki
Eurasian/Continental
Shaded by an ancient hau tree that twinkles with tiny lights at dinnertime,
this informal outdoor terrace on the sand is one of the most romantic
beachfront restaurants in all Hawaii. The A-1 location surpasses the food
at any time of day — but, frankly, it would be hard for any chef to live up
to this magical setting. (Robert Louis Stevenson himself often came here
to sit beneath the hau trees and watch the waves roll in.) Breakfast is best:
Throw caution to the wind and start the day with the sausage sampler —
three kinds of local sausage and a side of fluffy poi pancakes — or the eggs
Benedict, which wears a perfect hollandaise. Lunchtime features burgers,
sandwiches, and salads, and the fresh island fish preparations are the
standouts at dinner. Live music enhances the romantic mood on weekends
and during the Friday lunch hour.

This six-decade-old diner may have relocated to new digs in 2002, but the
old-time ambience and all the hallmarks of Helena’s remain, making this
the best place in town to experience genuine island-style eats. Helena’s is
so renowned for its local fare that the James Beard Foundation has lauded
it as a regional classic. Grandson Craig Katsuyoshi now mans the stove
while lively 80-something Helena handles the cash register, but all her clas-
sic dishes are served, including pipikaula, strips of seasoned beef hung to
dry and smoked over the stove, moist and tender pulled kalua pork, pork
laulau (wrapped and steamed in ti leaves), short ribs, squid luau, fried but-
terfish collars, and other ethnic island staples. Expect a wait, and don’t be
afraid to ask these friendly folks for dish descriptions or recommenda-

$$$
Waikiki
Eclectic
Everybody in the islands knows that this alfresco beachside lounge is
Waikiki’s best spot for sunset cocktails, but few realize how good the food
is, too. The dinner menu fuses casual dining and elegance without a hitch.
Consider starting with premium-grade ahi sashimi or the Maui onion soup
gratiné (topped with melted Swiss and Gruyère cheeses) followed by a per-
fectly grilled Angus beef burger. Or start with casual finger foods (maybe
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 149

coconut shrimp or peanut-crusted barbecued chicken skewers) and follow
with lump crab-crusted mahimahi or a thick-cut New York steak. The mai
tais are Hawaii’s best, but the bar also excels at nonalcoholic creations;
try the tart lime Calamansi soda or a refreshing frozen lemonade. A mas-
terful trio entertains with traditional Hawaiian music nightly, accompanied
by an elegant hula dancer of the highest regard (most nights it’s Kanoe
Miller, a former Miss Hawaii). Romantic, nostalgic, and breathtaking; one
of my Waikiki favorites.

Hukilau Cafe
$
North Shore
Local
This super-local North Shore diner was the inspiration for the restaurant
featured in the movie 50 First Dates. The reason to go, though, is not for a
movie moment, but for a genuine local experience at this clean, simple,
bustling daytime place. The star of the simple menu is the Hukilau burger,
topped with cheese, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, teriyaki beef (yes, on
the burger), and a fried egg. A heart attack on a fresh-baked bun, for sure,
but divine nonetheless. Or try one of the mixed plates; my favorites come
with teriyaki beef and the local mahimahi, cleanly fried to golden brown. All
plates come with the traditional rice and macaroni salad sides. Service is
very friendly, but be prepared to move with the flow or wait for a table —
whatever the day calls for. A genuine local experience.

Hy’s Steak House

Waikiki

I just love Hy’s — it’s the only place in town that still serves a great steak
and flaming bananas Foster in true old-world style. This dark and clubby
traditional steakhouse is the perfect setting for classics like oysters
Rockefeller, beef Wellington, rich and garlicky steak Diane, lamb chops à
la Hy’s (perfectly broiled and served with tropical fruit chutney), and
chateaubriand for two. Or choose from a number of surf-and-turf combos,
plus a good selection of seafood options (including calamari, ahi, and
kiawe-charred [mesquite-charred] scallops). I suggest starting with the
Caesar salad show (prepared tableside with all of the classic flourishes)
and crowning the meal with a flambéed dessert, such as cherries jubilee
or the aforementioned bananas Foster. More formal and upscale than the
new d.k Steak House, it’s also mellower in attitude and style. Enjoy live
acoustic music Tuesday through Saturday nights, or live island-style
ukulele music sets Sunday and Monday nights. Make sure you get seated
in the elegant, old-school downstairs dining room; the lame upstairs dining
room feels like a Greek diner off the New Jersey Turnpike.

This intimate downtown restaurant is a wonderful choice for a romantic
midpriced meal. Boasting a casual-chic tropical look, the contemporary
main room sets an appealing scene. But call ahead for a table on the magi-
cal lanai, which overlooks a charming pocket park; dark woods and rattan,
oversize palm fronds, a trickling water fountain, and conspiratorially dim
candlelight make this outdoor dining room feel as if it had been trans-
planted from exotic Thailand or deepest Malaysia. Chef/owner Glenn Chu’s
East-meets-West menu is best described as Pan-Asian — Chinese and Thai
traditions are most apparent — with serious French twists: Witness such
taste treats as goat cheese wontons in a four-fruit sauce, and Mongolian
lamb chops sauced with minted tangerines. Light eaters or the chronically
indecisive can choose to make a meal of dim sum–style plates (lobster pot-
stickers, anyone?). Come early for a relaxed martini, or stay late for some
rollicking live music, in the adjacent Green Room lounge.

counter, and then choose a table inside or on the lanai; a server delivers
your freshly made meal in short order. Beware the workday lunch hour,

Kua Aina Sandwich

This North Shore legend has pleased many Honolulu residents — who
used to have to drive an hour for the ultimate burger — by opening a
second Ala Moana–area location. Cheeseburger in Paradise (see earlier in
this chapter) wins on both burger and atmosphere, but Kua Aina (koo-ah
eye-na) runs a close second on the burger and makes for a better quickie
meal. The gourmet sandwiches are equally good, especially the mahimahi
with a green-chili sauce and cheese. Whatever you order, don’t forget a
side of the spindly fries, which elevate the fried spud to new levels.
Takeout is a good idea at the perpetually packed North Shore location; the
larger Honolulu branch offers more indoor and outdoor seating.

In 2007, world-famous chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa debuted the first Pacific

rooted in Japanese tradition but heavily influenced by Western techniques,
Matsuhisa’s cuisine bursts with creative spirit. Unusual textures, impul-
sive combinations, and surprising flavors add up to a first-rate dining
adventure that you won’t soon forget. Virtually every creation hits its
target, whether you opt for the new-style sashimi; light-as-air rock shrimp
tempura; oysters baked in Filo pastry and dressed with caviar; or sublime
broiled black cod in sweet miso, the best (and most famous) dish on the
menu. You can take a traditional appetizers-and-entrees approach, but
most dinners are structured as a series of tasting plates based on your
palette and desired level of adventure. Before my recent meal here, I had
forgotten how much fun it is to eat at Nobu. The staff is knowledgeable
and pleasingly opinionated, and happy to guide you to your ideal meal.
The excitement is heightened by the dramatic modern decor and lighting.

in search of local culinary experiences.
PukaDog starts by baking a bun-size loaf of bread from their own house
recipe. Once you place your order, they pierce a hole in one end (puka
means “hole” in Hawaiian), toast the bun, insert a perfectly grilled Polish-
style sausage, and dress it to your taste. You’ll customize with your choice
of secret sauce — mild garlic-lemon, spicy jalapeño, hot chili pepper, or
super-hot habanero — and tropical relish (mango, coconut, banana,
pineapple, papaya, or star fruit). Top it all off with the condiment of your
choice; my favorite is the lilikoi (passion fruit) mustard. Service is aloha
friendly, and a veggie dog is available for those who don’t do meat. There
are only a few tables, so get your dog to go — and relish in one of the
Pacific’s most heavenly hot dogs.

perfectly complements his menu; there’s also a wonderful list of creative
tropical cocktails. Tables are big and comfortable, and service is friendly
and impressively attentive. Kids are welcome, and Roy’s is particularly well-
suited to groups, making it an ideal choice for a multigenerational family
meal. There’s also live music Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings.
A second Oahu location, Roy’s Ko’ Olina, which overlooks a lagoon and

won raves from fans around the globe. Entrees are available, but I recom-
mend assembling a family-style meal from the adventurous sushi rolls and
small plates. Can’t-go-wrong menu highlights include the Asian rock
shrimp cake in ginger-lime-chili butter, topped with crispy Chinese noo-
dles; the mango crab salad roll in sweet Thai chili vinaigrette; the calamari
salad tossed in Korean-inspired kojuchang vinaigrette, presented in a pleas-
ing wonton basket; and the beautifully presented flower sushi. Even the
desserts are divine at this easygoing, Japanese-style place.
Sit at the bar if you’d like to combine your sushi order with some dishes
from the adjoining d.k Steak House (see review earlier in this chapter).
Early-bird diners receive 25 percent off sushi orders placed Tuesdays
through Fridays between 5:30 and 6 p.m., and late-night diners enjoy
karaoke, drink specials, and 50 percent off the appetizer and sushi menu
Fridays and Saturdays between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.
See map p. 138. At the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa, 2552 Kalakaua Ave. (at
Papakalani Avenue just west of Kapiolani Park), Waikiki. %808-931-6286. www.sansei
hawaii.com. Reservations highly recommended. Sushi and sashimi: $5–$20. Main
courses: $11–$43 (most under $30). AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Dinner nightly.
Side Street Inn
$–$$
Ala Moana
Local
The popularity of this unassuming sports-and-karaoke bar exploded when
locals realized that this is where Honolulu’s best chefs gather to nosh after
their own kitchens close. This is as hole-in-the-wall as it gets: neon beer
signs in the plate-glass windows, long picnic-style tables, TVs turned to
the current game, walls long in need of a fresh painting, and no-nonsense
service. Chatting, happy crowds dig into heaping family-style plates of
tangy Buffalo wings, delectable fried rice chock-full of meat and veggies,
kal bi (charbroiled Korean-style short ribs), and other diet-defying
delights. Many consider the pan-fried pork chops to be the world’s best,
and they just may be. Also recommended: finger-lickin’ good baby back
ribs glazed in lilikoi barbecue sauce, and meaty, moist chicken katsu
(chicken breast coated in panko bread crumbs, a Japanese favorite).
Genuine local fun, and some of the best authentic local food on the island.
Side Street is also a great choice for late-night dining, because the kitchen
is open until 12:30 a.m. daily, as long as the kitchen feels like it (the bar
stays open until the wee hours).
See map p. 140. 1225 Hopaka St. (just west of Piikoi Street, 1 block south of Kapiolani
Boulevard), Honolulu. % 808-591-0253. Reservations recommended for large par-
ties. To get there from Waikiki: Take Ala Moana Boulevard to Piikoi Street and turn
right; turn left on Kapiolani Boulevard; turn left on Pensacola Street; and turn left on
Hopaka Street; park on the street where allowed. Main courses: $5–$8 at lunch,
$7.50–$21 at dinner (most under $13). AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Lunch Mon–Fri,
dinner daily.

Singha Thai Cuisine
$$$
Ewa Waikiki
Thai
The imaginative Thai-Hawaiian hybrid cuisine at Singha wins fans among
Asian-food addicts and novices alike. Thai-born chef Chai Chaowasaree’s
complete dinners for two to five are family-style feasts — perfect for intro-
ducing first-timers to this rich, flavorful cuisine, as well as elements of
Hawaii Regional Cuisine that the chef has incorporated into his cooking.
Highlights of the varied menu include yummy blackened ahi rolls; fresh
island fish in a light black-bean sauce; a kaleidoscope of curries; and excel-
lent seafood dishes, like the wok-seared jumbo black tiger prawns in spicy
ginger-chili sauce. Dishes are presented prettily, and service is first-rate.
The graceful Royal Thai Dancers perform nightly, adding to the one-of-a-
kind experience. There’s free validated parking on the second floor of
Canterbury Place (enter from Ena Road).
See map p. 138. 1910 Ala Moana Blvd. (at Kalia Road), Waikiki. % 808-941-2898. www.
singhathai.com. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $16–$35 (most
under $25); complete multicourse dinners (served for 2–5 people) $35 per person. AE,
DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Dinner nightly.

Honolulu
Fresh Contemporary
This wonderful contemporary restaurant is well worth seeking out for
foodies in the mood for something different. It’s only a ten-minute drive
from Waikiki, in Honolulu’s increasingly stylish Kaimuki district; the restau-
rant reflects the casual, confident hipness of the area. The atmosphere is
spare and loftlike, with enough kitchen-friendly comforts — diner-style
tables and chairs, a pastry cabinet serving as the bar — to feel approach-
able rather than sleek. Town’s motto is “Local first, organic whenever pos-
sible, with aloha always.” Greens come from local island farmers, and fish
is caught from island boats most of the time. But the real joy in the food
comes in the imaginative marriages and seasonings that create delicate,
seamless flavors that are greater than the sum of their parts. Dishes that
make memories include a succulent pan-roasted chicken served over a
torn bread salad tossed with tatsoi (spinach mustard greens), juicy grapes,
and savory pancetta. Also consider the grilled monchong filet served with
purple Molokai sweet potato, zucchini, Maui onion, and a palette-sparking
salsa verde; with so much pan-island origination, it’s practically Hawaii on
a plate. I recommend starting with the lightly fried Ma’o spring onions.
Some consider the service to be snobbish, but I appreciate the clear direc-
tion and friendly challenge to dine provocatively and well. The wine list is
affordable and inventive, too.
See map p. 138. 3435 Waialae Ave., Honolulu. % 808-735-5900. www.townkaimuki.
com. Reservations recommended. To get there from Waikiki: Take Kalakaua Avenue
toward Diamond Head; turn left at Kapahulu Avenue, go 1 mile to Mooheau Avenue
and turn right; go 1⁄3 mile and turn left on 6th Avenue; go 1⁄2 mile to Waialae Avenue, turn
right and go 1⁄3 mile to the restaurant. Use the small lot in the back or park on the street
if the lot is full. Main courses: $17–$24. BYO corkage: $10. AE, MC, V. Open: Lunch and
dinner Mon–Sat.
Chapter 10: Settling into Oahu 157

Luau!
None of Oahu’s luau are on par with those offered on the neighbor islands,
especially Maui’s Old Lahaina Luau, but if you’re not visiting any of 
the neighboring islands on this trip, try the Royal Luau at the Royal
Hawaiian (see map p. 132; 2259 Kalakaua Ave. [at the end of Royal
Hawaiian Avenue], Waikiki; % 808-921-4600; www.royal-hawaiian.com).
Prices are $99 for adults (including unlimited cocktails), $55 for kids ages
5 to 12, free for kids age 4 and under; discounts are available for Royal
Hawaiian guests, and you can sometimes score online discounts.
Reservations are highly recommended. The luau is held every Monday
and Thursday at 6 p.m. Note that the event may be canceled or moved to
an indoor venue in inclement weather. Furthermore, I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if the schedule changes once the Royal Hawaiian opens in late 2008
after its major renovation; call to check for the latest details and prices.
This is Waikiki’s only luau, and although it’s not the most authentic luau in
the islands, it is intimate and romantic.
Also consider the nightly (except Sun) luau at the Polynesian Cultural
Center in Laie; see Chapter 11 for more information.
Sea Life Park also offers the family-friendly Sea Life Luau on Wednesday,
Friday, and Sunday nights at 6 p.m. It includes a 15-minute dolphin show
as well as the usual luau entertainment and traditional imu (underground
grilled pig) presentation. It’s relaxing and fun, and a great way to see the
highlights of the park if you don’t have a whole day to spare. Prices are
$89 for adults, $55 for kids. For advance reservations, call % 866-393-
5158, or visit www.sealifeparkhawaii.com. See Chapter 11 for further
details on the park.

Exploring Oahu
In This Chapter
 Heading to Oahu’s best beaches
 Playing in the waves
 Seeing the sights
 Scoping out the shopping scene
 Enjoying Oahu’s island nightlife
O
ahu is the place to rev up and have some fun. This island boasts
more than you can see or do in the span of five vacations, much
less one — so save the kicking-back portion of your vacation for the next
island.
Then again, there are those wonderful white sands and warm turquoise
waters. . . .
Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Oahu’s warm and wonderful diversity also extends to its wealth of beau-
tiful beaches and ocean activities. Whether you want to bask in the sun
or find an ocean thrill, Oahu has the answer for you.
Combing the Beaches
When you’re at the beach, maintain a healthy respect for the ocean. Big
waves can come seemingly out of nowhere and travel far upshore in a
matter of minutes. Never turn your back on the ocean. Take extra care to
heed this advice in winter, when the surf is at its least predictable.
Also, never leave valuables in your rental car while you’re at the beach.
Thieves prey on tourists, and they’ll have no trouble getting into your
car to take whatever you’ve left there.

Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 165

The Waikiki Coast and East Oahu
Ala Moana Beach Park
Gold-sand Ala Moana (“by the sea”) is the city’s most popular beach play-
ground for local families, and it’s easy to see why. Stretching for more than
a mile along Honolulu’s coast between downtown and Waikiki, the long,
man-made beach is one of the best-sheltered coves on Oahu, so the water’s
calm and safe year-round, even for little ones. The area called Magic Island,
the peninsula that extends from Ala Moana Park, is especially well-pro-
tected, thanks to a man-made breakwater that cuts the surf down to zero
and offers great views of the Waikiki skyline. The park boasts concessions,
lifeguards, bathhouses, tennis courts, a nice paved path for joggers, picnic
tables, and wide-open grassy lawns. It’s the only beach along this coast
that’s not lined with high-rise hotels, and the sands are set far enough back
from Ala Moana Boulevard that traffic doesn’t interfere. The ambience is
laid-back on weekdays, whereas a party mood prevails on weekends.
Plenty of free parking is at hand; but it fills up on weekends, so come early
or catch TheBus to Ala Moana Center.
See map p. 164. Along Ala Moana Boulevard, between Atkinson Drive and Ward
Avenue (directly across the street from Ala Moana Center).
Waikiki Beach
Waikiki is center stage for Hawaii’s biggest and best beach party. Five mil-
lion global visitors a year descend onto this 11⁄2-mile-long sunny crescent
of sand. Sure, it gets crowded, but that’s a big part of what makes Waikiki
such a blast.
Waikiki is actually a long, narrow, continuous string of beaches that
extends between Ala Wai Harbor to the west and Diamond Head to the
east. Each one is wonderful for surfing, swimming, and just frolicking in
the mini-swells — and the tight chain of high-rise hotels abutting the
beaches actually helps to block street noise and traffic sounds. Every
imaginable type of beach toy is available for rent at concessions that line
the beach. The sparkling turquoise water is always calm, warm, crystal-
clear, and great for floating the real-life stress away. Waves can kick up a bit
in the spring, when the south swells come — and the local surfers show 
up — but it’s never so severe that you need to stay out of the water.
Duke Kahanamoku (ka-ha-na-mow-koo) Beach is the west end of the beach,
the section fronting the Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel. Access is off Kalia
Road via Paoa Place — or just walk through the hotel grounds. Waikiki
Beach Prime Time Sports (% 808-949-8952; www.primetimesports
hawaii.com) operates two excellent beach chair- and gear-rental stands
just east of the Hilton and west of the Outrigger Reef, at the edge of Fort
DeRussy Park. Prime Time Sports also rents oversize two-person floats, fun
aquacycles for paddling on the waves, kayaks, surfboards, boogie boards,
snorkel gear, and more. My favorite rental shacks on Waikiki Beach.
Gray’s Beach, the arc of sand between the Halekulani and the Moana
Surfrider hotels, is my favorite stretch of Waikiki Beach. It’s everybody
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
166

else’s, too — particularly the area in front of the historic Royal Hawaiian
and Moana hotels — so bring your beach chair and stake a claim because
this beach is where the party begins. Waikiki’s waters are at their calmest
and shallowest here. The beach has a number of access points, including
a beach access pathway off Kalia Road, just to the left of the Halekulani
and to the right of the Waikiki Parc hotel (as you face the coast); walk to
the left to get to the wider sands. (Or, better yet, just parade through one
of the hotels.)
The festive party atmosphere continues on Kuhio Beach, which begins
just to the east of the Moana Surfrider at the end of Kaiulani Avenue.
Because fewer hotels separate Kalakaua Avenue from the beach, this one
affords the quickest access to the Waikiki shoreline. This is where the
majority of concessionaires are set up. (For more on what’s available, see
the section “Playing in the Surf,” later in this chapter.) The swimming is
good here; but some deep pools exist (heed the “Watch Out for Holes”
signs because you can suddenly find yourself in very deep water), and the
surf kicks up a bit a few hundred yards offshore. To the east of the Moana
between Kaiulani and Uluniu avenues is Waikiki’s newest renovation proj-
ect, a wonderful parklike area of grassy knolls, winding paths, and Tiki
torches — it’s an excellent place to watch the sunset. The city regularly
hosts sunset entertainment here and occasionally sets up a big outdoor
movie screen to show classic films; ask the concierge at your hotel or
condo for the current schedule. At the end of Kapahulu Avenue, a seawall
marks a favorite boogie boarding spot.
Queen’s Beach, directly across from Kapiolani Park (between the zoo and
the aquarium), is the easiest place to park along Waikiki. This is also the
quietest stretch of beach because no hotels line the road, and a grassy,
palm-dotted lawn backs the sand. Head here if you want to get away from
the crowds. The facilities include showers, restrooms, barbecue grills,
picnic tables, volleyball courts, and a pavilion with a food concession. The
middle section of the beach (in front of the pavilion) is a popular gay hang-
out, but everybody’s welcome.
Sans Souci Beach is the easternmost section of Waikiki, the bit that fronts
the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel and the other small hotels and condos
at the foot of Diamond Head. This is the locals’ favorite stretch of Waikiki
thanks to its beautiful setting (Diamond Head makes a gorgeous backdrop)
and intimate, low-key vibe. It’s also on the quiet side, with easy-access
parking along Kalakaua Avenue and beach showers. The swimming here is
excellent — a shallow reef close to shore.
See map p. 164. Lifeguards patrol all Waikiki, and all the hotels have public restrooms
and casual beachfront restaurants. For more information, contact the Hawaiian
Lifeguard Association (3823 Leahi Ave., Honolulu; % 808-922-3888; www.aloha.
com/~lifeguards).
Hanauma Bay
Hanauma (ha-now-ma) Bay offers the best snorkeling in Hawaii, especially
for novices. The curved, gold-sand beach is packed blanket-to-blanket with
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 167

people year-round — sometimes it seems there are more people than fish
in the water — but put on a mask and gaze down into the clear, warm
water, and a whole new world opens up to you. Cradled in an old volcanic
crater, this marine life conservation district is home to an underwater
metropolis of friendly reef fish. (But be sure not to touch or feed the exotic
critters here.) The inner reef is calm, clear, and shallow — so much so, in
fact, that even nonswimmers can wade and look down. Serious divers
come to shoot “the slot” through the reef to Witch’s Brew, a turbulent, 70-
foot-deep cove featuring coral gardens, turtles, and sharks, but I suggest
you stick to the safe, shallow, well-protected inner reef.
A new $13-million Marine Education Center opened in 2002, as extensive
improvements were made to the grounds and facilities at Hanauma Bay.
The facility features a theater (you will be required to watch a nine-minute
video about Hanauma Bay and ocean safety before you enter the park), an
education alcove, a gift shop, and food concession at the upper level of
the bay; a motorized tram (50¢ to go down the hill, $1 to go up) can take
you down the steep road to the beach. Restrooms, outdoor showers, a
snorkeling concession, and a new information center are located in the
lower bay area. The only food concession is at the top.
Parking at Hanauma Bay costs $1 per car and is severely limited, so go
bright and early to snare a spot; arrive after 10 a.m., and you may find your-
self shut out. You can also take TheBus no. 22 (marked “Hawaii Kai–Sea
Life Park”), which runs down Kuhio Avenue and takes about 45 minutes to
reach Hanauma Bay. For information on routes and timetables, call TheBus
at % 808-848-5555.
Even though snorkel gear is available at Hanauma Bay, I much prefer to
stop by Snorkel Bob’s on the way to Hanauma Bay to pick up higher qual-
ity gear, which is well worth the extra $2 or $3; see the section “Playing in
the Surf,” later in this chapter, for details.

well marked). % 808-396-4229. www.co.honolulu.hi.us/parks/facility/
hanaumabay. Admission: $5, free for kids under 12. Parking: $1 per car. Open:
Summer: Wed–Mon 6 a.m.–7 p.m. (until 10 p.m. on the 2nd and 4th Sat of each month);
closed Tues. Winter: Wed–Mon 6 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 10 p.m. on the 2nd Sat of each
month); closed Tues.
Diamond Head Beach Park
This hidden beach at the foot of Diamond Head is a nice local hideaway,
especially if you’re ready to escape the crowds of Waikiki but don’t feel
like venturing too far. A somewhat steep but paved path leads down the
sea cliffs to a narrow but pretty golden-sand beach. A rocky shelf forms
tide pools that are fun to explore. Snorkeling can be good early in the day;
surfers come out later in afternoon, when the waves kick up. Beware:
There are no lifeguards, and facilities are minimal. The gorgeous open
ocean views make this a great whale-watching perch in winter.
See map p. 164. Off Kalakaua Avenue/Diamond Head Road, between Beach Road
and the Diamond Head lighthouse. To get there: Drive east from Waikiki on Kalakaua

168

Avenue; after the road curves around Diamond Head, look for the beach marking on
the ocean side of the road, right next to the lighthouse. Park on the street and take
the stairs down to the beach.
Sandy Beach
The most famous bodysurfing spot in Hawaii is this beautiful gold-sand
beach, which is all the more beautiful for the dramatic desert landscape
behind it. This local favorite has starred in countless TV shows, from
Hawaii Five-O to Magnum P.I. In summer, the ocean is fine for swimming
and boogie boarding. In winter, the big, pounding waves draw expert body-
surfers in droves, but they’re simply too dangerous for regular swimmers.
If you come to play in the summer waves, boogie boards are fine, but leave
any boards with skegs (bottom fins) at home. Be sure to heed the lifeguard
warnings and get out of the water if the swells or undertow kicks up.
Facilities include restrooms, beach showers, lifeguard, and plenty of park-
ing; a hot food truck usually shows up at lunchtime.
See map p. 164. On Kalanianole Highway. To get there: Drive east on H-1, which
becomes Kalanianaole Highway; go past Hawaii Kai, up the hill to Hanauma Bay, past
the Halona Blow Hole, and along the coast. The next big, gold, sandy beach you see
ahead on the right is Sandy Beach.
Along the Windward Coast
If you have the time, I highly recommend spending a day at the beach
along this stunning, uncrowded, residential coast. It’s a nice change of
pace from Waikiki: Come midweek, and you’ll find these beaches pleas-
antly uncrowded; on weekends, local families set the tone.
Plan on arriving for your day of east shore beach-going early because
the windward Koolau mountains block the afternoon sun.
Kailua Beach
The Windward Coast’s premier beach park is a 2-mile-long gently sloping
golden strand with dunes, palm trees, panoramic views, gentle waves, and
a gorgeous green-mountain backdrop. With excellent swimming, water
that’s about 78°F year-round, and good facilities, it’s ideal for families —
and your kids will love the bodysurfing and boogie boarding here.
Toddlers can splash in the freshwater shallows in the middle of the park,
near the mouth of the stream. Facilities include picnic tables, barbecues,
restrooms, a volleyball court, a bike path, an open-air cafe (which may be
closed on weekdays), and plenty of free parking; lifeguards are usually on
hand. Kayak and windsurf rentals are often available, too, because this is
also Oahu’s premier windsurfing beach.
From Kailua, you can kayak out to the two charmingly petite islets about
11⁄2 miles offshore. Kayaking to the Mokuleias, where you can land on a
remote beach for sunning and exploring, is one of my absolute favorite
island activities. Local kayaking outfitters provide convenient rentals; see
“Ocean kayaking for everyone,” later in this chapter.
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 169

See map p. 162. At the end of Kailua Road, Kailua. To get there: Take the Pali Highway
(Highway 61) to Kailua, where it becomes Kailua Road as it proceeds through town;
at Kalaheo Avenue, turn right and follow the coast to the park.
Lanikai Beach
This is one of the most tranquil and beautiful beaches in the entire state —
my favorite beach on the entire island. It’s almost always excellent for swim-
ming, snorkeling, and kayaking, plus a little easy wave-jumping on occa-
sion. The beach is long and narrow, with gold sand as soft as talcum powder
and lightly rippled turquoise water. Two petite offshore islets, called the
Mokuleias, provide the perfect panoramic finish. Unfortunately, the trade-
off for all this unspoiled beauty is an utter lack of facilities.
See map p. 162. Off Mokulua Drive, Kailua. To get there: Follow the directions to Kailua
Beach Park (see preceding entry); just past Kailua Beach Park, turn left at the T inter-
section and drive uphill on Aalapapa Drive, a one-way street that loops back as
Mokulua Drive; park on Mokulua Drive and walk down any of the 8 public access
lanes to the shore.
Kualoa Regional Park
Farther north on the Windward Coast is one of Hawaii’s most scenic beach
parks, a 150-acre coco palm–fringed peninsula on Kaneohe Bay’s north
shore, at the foot of spiky green mountains. The biggest beach park on the
windward side, it has a broad, grassy lawn that’s great for picnicking. The
long, narrow white-sand beach is ideal for swimming, beachcombing, kite
flying, or just enjoying the natural beauty of this once-sacred Hawaiian
shore (it’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places), but keep in
mind that it can get pretty windy out here. The waters are shallow and safe
for swimming year-round. It doesn’t offer much in the way of facilities, but
lifeguards are on duty. Offshore is Mokolii (mow-ko-lee-ee), the picturesque
mini-isle more commonly known as Chinaman’s Hat. At low tide, people
like to wade out to the island, which has a small sandy beach; it’s just a
bad idea to walk on the reef, however, so if you’re going to go, swim it
instead. Chinaman’s Hat is a bird preserve, so tread gently.
See map p. 162. On Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83), Kualoa (about halfway up
the coast, north of Waikane). % 808-237-8525. Parking: The beach has a free lot, but
there is no access parking or path for visitors with disabilities.
Malaekahana State Recreation Area
Big, brawny Malaekahana (ma-lie-ka-ha-na) Beach is a nearly mile-long
white-sand crescent with sheltered waters that are excellent for swimming
year-round and waves that are great for beginning bodysurfers in summer.
On any weekday, you may be the only one here; should someone intrude
on your privacy, however, you can take an easy swim out to Goat Island, a
bird sanctuary (you can wade it, but don’t — it’s bad for the reef). Stands
of trees offer daytime shade, and restrooms, barbecue grills, picnic tables,
outdoor showers, and tons of free parking are at hand.
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
170

See map p. 162. On Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83), 2 miles north of the
Polynesian Cultural Center, Laie. The beach is hidden from the road, so look care-
fully for the main gate; as soon as you enter you’ll come upon the wooded beach
park. Parking: There’s a free lot.
On the North Shore
This is surf country, where daredevils gather from around the world to
ride monster waves in surf season, basically from late September through
April. Don’t even think about going into the water in winter, because the
rip currents along this shore are killers. The North Shore coast is season-
ally schizophrenic: The monstrous surf recedes entirely in summer, leav-
ing glassy ponds and idle surfboards.
The waves may kick up even in the fairest months, so don’t go near the
water in any season if the lifeguards have put out the red warning flags,
or if you just suspect that conditions might be too rough.
Banzai Pipeline/Ehukai Beach Park
The Japanese word banzai means “10,000 years”; it’s used as a toast or
battle cry, meaning “go for it.” In the late 1950s, filmmaker Bruce Brown
was shooting one of the first surf movies ever made, Surf Safari, at Ehukai
Beach Park when he saw a bodysurfer ride a huge wave. Brown yelled
“Banzai!” and the name stuck. The Banzai Pipeline section of the beach is
about 100 yards to the left of the Ehukai Beach Park sign as you face the
ocean, but you won’t need to look hard to find it in surf season. When the
winter surf rolls in and hits the shallow coral shelf offshore, the waves that
form are so steep that the crest of the wave falls forward, forming a near-
perfect tube, or “pipeline,” just like in the opening credits of Hawaii Five-
O. Hang-ten fanatics flock here from around the globe all winter long to
master this holy grail of surf challenges, but the wild, wild Pipeline is one
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 171
Picnicking at Lanikai or Kailua
Both Lanikai and Kailua beaches are ideal places to bring a picnic lunch and camp
out for the day. And the perfect place to pack it? Kalapawai Market, 306 S. Kalaheo
Ave. (% 808-262-4359; www.kalapawaimarket.com), just down the street from
Kailua Beach and Buzz’s Original Steak House (see Chapter 10). This charming market
has evolved into an easygoing gourmet outpost complete with home-style deli sand-
wiches (including an excellent BLT with avocado spread) and an excellent collection
of snacks, soft drinks, wine, and beer. Open daily from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. There’s also a
second location in the heart of Kailua town at 750 Kailua Rd., between Hamakua and
Hoolai streets, just past the end of the Pali Highway (% 808-262-3354). This location
keeps the same hours, but also features a wine bar and serves an appealing and mod-
erately priced sit-down dinner from 5:30 p.m. nightly. See map p. 162.

tough cookie. If you want to watch top-flight, pro-level wave-riding action,
a winter weekend visit to the Pipeline is well worth the long drive from
Waikiki — heck, the crowd alone is enough to keep you entertained for
hours. Needless to say, head elsewhere to swim.
See map p. 162. Off Kamehameha Highway on Ke Nui Road (which parallels the high-
way 1 mile north of Pupukea), just south of Sunset Beach. A small lot is available for
parking.
Laniakea Beach
This long and narrow white sand beach is a popular surf spot, but it’s
increasingly well known for something completely different: In recent
years, Hawaiian green sea turtles (or honu) have taken to crawling onshore
to bask in the sun and take midday naps. It’s a wonderful sight to behold
these prehistorically majestic creatures mosey ashore and settle in, and a
great way to get a look at them up close. A wonderful and well-organized
group of volunteers known as Malama Na Honu (www.malamanahonu.
org) mans the beach and surrounds the turtle’s napping area with a red
rope to keep visitors from getting too close and impinging on the honu’s
siesta. About 20 resident sea turtles have been tagged and named, so
depending on the day, you might see Wooley Bully, Brutus, Oakley, Isabella,
or one of their compatriots, who can grow to well more than 3 feet long
and regularly live to be 60 or 70 years old. The volunteers are happy to
provide visitors with information and insights into the animals. Of course,
sea creatures do as they wish, so at any given time it’s impossible to say
whether you’ll find a whole klatch of resting honu or nobody at all.
Afternoon hours are best.
Whether volunteers are present or not, please be sure to keep a respect-
ful distance from the turtles, a threatened species that is protected by the
Endangered Species Act and Hawaii state law. Do not touch them or dis-
turb them in any way.
See map p. 162. On Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83, between Haleiwa and
Waimea Bay beach parks), north of Haleiwa. www.malamanahonu.org. To get
there from Turtle Bay: Drive toward Haleiwa for exactly 9 miles from the resort flag.
Limited parking across the street.
Pupukea Beach Park
This roadside beach park north of Waimea Bay is a wonderful find for
snorkelers, who can enjoy a kaleidoscope of marine life when the waves
are calm. There are two particularly good separate side-by-side sections
here: To the north is Shark’s Cove, which, despite its name, is not popu-
lated by any monsters of the deep. Instead, this large, shallow, protected
lava rock cove teems with colorful fish and the snorkelers who seek them.
Beware in winter; even though the cove looks protected, the seawall is low,
the waves high, and the undertow deadly. There’s a small sandy beach
down the slope, plus bathrooms and showers near the roadside parking
lot. At the south end of the beach is Three Tables, a pocket bay offering a
wider beach and even easier entry access to great snorkeling around three
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
172

flat coral “tables” visible just offshore. Bathrooms and showers are avail-
able at the Sharks’ Cove section.
The hidden section of Pupukea Beach informally known as Ke Iki Beach is
a secret gem that’s worth seeking out. Ke Iki is hidden from the road by
private homes, so most visitors don’t know about it. This white-sand
beach of sloping dunes is big, wide, open, and virtually empty year-round.
Ke Iki is a wonderful place for swimming and wave jumping in summer; as
everywhere on the North Shore, stay out of the water entirely in winter,
however, when the big swells come. At the lava-dotted east end of the sand
is a collection of warm tide pools where you can lie back and take in the
natural glory of it all. The downside: no facilities.
See map p. 162. On Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83), Pupukea, north of Haleiwa.
To get to Ke Iki Beach: From Haleiwa town, take the 2nd left after the Foodland at
Pupukea Road and then turn left again; park along the shoulder and walk down the
graded public access path (marked with the “No Parking beyond This Point” sign).
Sunset Beach Park
This surprisingly small beach is one of those legendary surf spots, the kind
that draws fearless wave riders from around the world in winter, when the
waves grow to huge, thundering peaks — sometimes as high as 15 to 20
feet. Come to watch the board-riding daredevils, who put on a jaw-drop-
ping show. This is a great place to people-watch: It’s a blast to eye the local
surfers, the sunbathing beauties, and even your fellow vacationers catch-
ing a glimpse of the action. Weekends are best for prime spectating. The
summer surf is fun for frolicking, and the beach is virtually empty mid-
week. No facilities are available, save for a small parking lot; join the other
cars on the shoulder if it’s full.
On Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83), Pupukea. Limited parking.
Waimea Bay Beach Park
This legendary beach is yet another world-famous surfing mecca, a breath-
takingly gorgeous one-of-a-kind sandy bowl whose placid fair-weather waves
are excellent for swimming, snorkeling, and bodysurfing in summer. But
what a difference a season makes: Winter waves pound the narrow bay,
sometimes rising a phenomenal 50 feet to the sky. Yes, no-fear brave-hearts
(or certifiable nut cases, depending on your point of view) do come to take
on these record breakers, and it’s well worth the drive to see them in action.
Waimea turns into a rollicking beach party when the surf is up and the
crowds come to watch. Visit on weekdays to avoid the crowds, weekends to
join in. When the surf calms down, there’s hardly a better place on the island
to chill out and play in the surf — one of my absolute favorites. Facilities
include lifeguards, restrooms, and showers. The small lot fills up when the
crowds come, so just pull over to the shoulder with everybody else.
See map p. 162. On Kahehameha Highway (Highway 83), just outside the entrance to
Waimea Valley Adventure Park, about 3 miles north of Haleiwa. TheBus: no. 52 or 55.
A safety tip: Don’t get too distracted by the waves and forget to pay attention when
parking or crossing the road.

On the remote leeward coast
No matter what time of year you visit remote Kaena Point, check with
the lifeguard near the park entrance before you venture into the water.
Restrooms and parking are located near the lifeguard stand. This is a
remote area that is generally populated by locals, so please respect
them and give them their space — and leave nothing in your car.

Highway ends, the wilderness of Kaena Point State Park begins. Kaena
Point is a remote 853-acre coastline park of wide white sands, sand dunes,
and desert cliffs overlooking the deep-blue water of Yokohama Bay. When
the surf’s calm in summer, the beach is pleasant for swimming and snor-
keling. When the surf kicks up, stick to the shore, because conditions can
be very rough. However, there’s good reason to come at any time of year:
You can’t find a better place onshore to watch spinner dolphins play. The
bay is their favorite spot on the island, so it’s common to see hundreds on
any given day.
If you want to pick up a bite to eat on your way to Kaena Point State Park,
stop into Aloha ’Aina Café, 85–773 Farrington Hwy., in Waianae, on the
ocean side of the highway across from McDonald’s, about halfway up the
leeward coast (% 808-697-8808). This charming healthy-foods cafe offers
excellent breakfasts and lunches for takeout or to eat in. Specialties
include Hawaiian sweetbread French toast, taro burgers, zesty chili with a
side of sweetbread, kalua pig quesadilla, and Portuguese bean soup, a
staple of the local diet. Everything is delicious, and service is as friendly
as can be.
See map p. 162. On Farrington Highway (Highway 93), at the end of the road. To get
there: Take H-1 west to Farrington Highway and drive up the leeward coast. The drive
will take an hour (or slightly more, depending on traffic) from Waikiki.
Playing in the Surf
If you want to rent boogie boards, surfboards, snorkel gear, kayaks, and
other beach toys, you won’t have a problem doing so on Oahu. In fact,
you won’t even need to leave Waikiki Beach because beach boys have
rental huts set up right on the sand; they’ll even take you out on outrig-
ger canoe rides that anybody can join in. For details, see “Catching a
wave,” later in this section. You can also rent beach chairs, life vests,
and boogie boards from Snorkel Bob’s, which you can read about in the
following section.
Snorkeling offshore
Hanauma Bay (see the section “The Waikiki Coast and East Oahu,” ear-
lier in this chapter) is not only Oahu’s best snorkel spot, but also one of
the finest snorkel spots in all Hawaii.
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
174

Although you can rent gear right at Hanauma Bay — or on Waikiki Beach if
you want to do some fish-finding there — I suggest renting instead from
Snorkel Bob’s, on the way to Hanauma Bay at 700 Kapahulu Ave., at Date
Street (across from the Ala Wai Golf Course), Honolulu (% 808-735-7944;
www.snorkelbob.com). Snorkel Bob’s can rent you much better quality
gear than you’ll get elsewhere — and it’s well worth spending the few
extra bucks for a mask that doesn’t leak and a snorkel that doesn’t fill with
water. The best-quality gear — the “Ultimate Truth” — rents for $7.50 a
day, or $32 a week ($22 per week for kids) for the mask/snorkel/fins set.
For $44, prescription masks (including snorkel and fins set) are available
to those near-sighted snorkelers who’d actually like to see the little fishes
without getting their glasses wet. Budget travelers can rent the most basic
gear for just $9 per week. Snorkel Bob’s is open every day from 8 a.m. to 5
p.m. There’s no need to reserve in advance, but you can book your gear
online if you like to plan ahead or have a special need. The staff can also
recommend other local snorkel spots that are currently offering calm con-
ditions and good underwater sightseeing.
One of the best things about renting gear from Bob is that you can rent 
a set of snorkel gear at the start of your trip, carry it with you as you
travel throughout the islands, and then return it to another Snorkel
Bob’s location on Maui, the Big Island, or Kauai. (All shops offer 24-hour
gear return service.) I highly recommend doing this, even if you intend
to go on snorkel cruises or kayak trips that provide gear.
Safety is key when snorkeling. See “Ocean Safety,” in the Quick Concierge
at the end of this book, for snorkeling tips.
All hands on deck: Ocean-cruising adventures
All Oahu’s cruise-boat operators combine whale-watching with their regu-
lar activities in season (humpback whales migrate to Hawaii’s warm waters
each winter, roughly Dec–Mar or early Apr). If you’re on Oahu during these
months, be sure to set out on a cruise — there’s nothing like seeing these
mammoth creatures up close and personal. Even if you miss out on the
whales, keep your eyes peeled for dolphins, flying fish, and sea turtles.
Making reservations is always a good idea for the following cruises and
outings.
Online booking and discounts are available for many of the boats listed
below through Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 800-779-6305 or 808-661-5800;
www.tombarefootshawaiitoursactivities.com), Hawaii’s best activi-
ties clearinghouse and booking agent.
Captain Bob’s Picnic Sail & Snorkeling Cruise
Hop aboard the Barefoot I, which shows you Oahu’s breathtaking Windward
Coast the way it should be seen — from the water. Captain Bob takes 
you exploring on serene Kaneohe Bay aboard his 42-foot glass-bottom 
catamaran, which skims across the usually tranquil water — it’s just the
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 175

right mood for this gorgeous turquoise, almost violet-hued surf. You cruise
past picture-perfect offshore islands and snorkel a spectacular shallow reef
where you can spot a kaleidoscope of tropical fish and, sometimes, turtles.
The color of the water alone is worth the price of admission. The boat isn’t
fancy, but the crew is friendly and accommodating. All in all, the trip is
casual, laid-back, and very relaxing; you’ll even stop at a sand bar for an
easy game of ocean volleyball. The group stays small, which keeps the trip
on friendly, casual terms among the guests as well. And one of the nicest
things about this trip is that they drop you right on top of the reef for easy
snorkeling — no hard-core paddling out to the fishies required. A practice
snorkel session makes this a great trip for beginners, but everyone will enjoy
it. Plan to spend the whole day with Bob, from roughly 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., but
it’s a day well spent.
Cruises depart from Kaneohe Bay, Kaneohe. % 808-942-5077. All-day cruise: $83
adults, $63 children 3–12, children under 3 free. Prices include all-you-can-eat bar-
becue lunch and shuttle from Waikiki. Online booking and discounts available at
press time through Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 800-779-6305 or www.tombarefoots
hawaiitoursactivities.com).
Dolphin Excursions
Cruise Oahu’s little-explored leeward coast in a Zodiac, a motorized inflat-
able rubber raft, with friendly and extremely knowledgeable owner/guide
Victor Lozano, or one of his equally knowledgeable captains, in search of
friendly pods of spinner dolphins. These low-slung, intimate boats are
great for getting close to the water and the dolphins. The pods of spinner
dolphins that live off Oahu’s arid west coast are so large that the guides
can pretty much guarantee copious sightings every day of the year. The
captain always has the best interests of you and the dolphins in mind. If
conditions are safe and doing so won’t interfere with their actions or
behavior, he’ll allow the bravest among you to do water “drops” wearing
snorkels and masks so that you can watch the dolphins below you in their
underwater habitat; decisions are made at the moment based on condi-
tions, but the trip is magic even if you don’t get to do this. Excursions are
offered daily and last about three hours; expect pickup at your hotel
between a bright-and-early 6:30 and 7 a.m. (Later excursions may be avail-
able during busy seasons, or can be customized upon request, but after-
noon is generally naptime for dolphins, so I recommend sticking with the
early hours, which the dolphins consider to be prime playtime.) Book at
least a week ahead, more if you don’t want to miss out, because the boats
carry a maximum of 22 dolphin seekers.
Boats depart from Waianae Small Boat Harbor, Farrington Highway (Highway 93),
Leeward Oahu. % 877-257-5579 or 808-239-5579. www.dolphinexcursions.

Waikiki and lunch; 10 percent discount if you meet the boat at the harbor.

for you, catch a ride aboard Ocean Adventures’ more substantial cruiser —
the Pacific Passion, a powerboat big enough for 30 passengers, complete
with onboard restroom and swim-step for easy snorkeling access — which
also cruises the western shore in search of playful spinner dolphins. The
four-hour trip includes snorkeling and the once-in-a-lifetime chance to swim
with the dolphins (the crew is careful to emphasize how to do this nonin-
trusively). This operator also offers trips aboard the 44-foot rigid inflatable
Ko Olina Explorer for a more exciting ride; creature comforts include a sun-
shade and an onboard restroom. There are two morning departures, at 
7 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.
Cruises depart from Ko Olina Resort and Marina, Kapolei (off Highway 93, 17 miles
west of Honolulu International Airport, a 45-min. drive from Waikiki). % 808-396-2068.
www.koolinaoceanadventures.net. Prices: $108 adults, $78 kids. Trip includes
breakfast and snacks; Waikiki hotel pickup available for $14 per person. At press
time, a free Fuji underwater camera was offered with online reservations.
MaiTai Catamaran
This sleek new 44-foot twin-hulled catamaran prides itself on being the
party boat of Waikiki. The MaiTai offers 90-minute daytime “Tradewind”
and late-afternoon sunset sails right off Waikiki beach. With a built-in bar
and 45 of your closest friends aboard, you’re bound to have a good 
time and enjoy some spectacular views while you’re at it. Two-hour
snorkel cruises are also available. The Friday-night moonlight sails offer a
great way to see the weekly fireworks display off Waikiki.
Cruises depart from Waikiki Beach between the Sheraton Waikiki and Halekulani
hotel. % 800-462-7975 or 808-922-5665. www.leahi.com. 90-minute afternoon sails
$23 adults, $12 kids ages 4–12; snorkel cruise $45 adults, $27 kids ages 4–12; sunset
sail and Fri-night moonlight sail $34 adults, $17 kids ages 4–12. Sunset sail includes
beverages; drinks are available for purchase on afternoon sails.
Navatek Cruises
For the smoothest ride in the Pacific, hop aboard the Navatek I, a high-tech
140-foot SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) vessel that promises
even the most perpetually queasy passengers a seasick-free ride. The
Navatek offers a number of different cruises, from lunchtime whale-
watches to the finest dinner cruises on the Waikiki coast (complete with a
romantic candlelit setting, a multicourse sit-down dinner, top local enter-
tainers, and an exclusive route along Kahala, Oahu’s “Gold Coast,” east of
Diamond Head). The Navatek is operated by Atlantis Adventures Oahu, a
company known for submarine dives that feature close-up views of sunken
ships and tropical fish; combo packages offer a substantial discount if you
want to book both activities.
Cruises depart from Pier 6, Honolulu Harbor, Aloha Tower Drive (just off Ala Moana
Boulevard/Nimitz Highway intersection, next to the Aloha Tower Marketplace),

then click on “Oahu Dinner Cruises”). Prices: Lunch cruise $56 adults, $28 kids ages
2–12; sunset cruise with entertainment and dinner buffet $77 adults, $52 kids 2–12;

Royal Sunset cruise with entertainment and sit-down steak-and-lobster dinner $108
adults, $71 kids 2–12. Window-seat upgrades and packages including add-on excur-
sions also available.
“Chumming” around with sharks
You’re 4 miles out from land, which is just a speck on the horizon, in
hundreds of feet of open ocean. Suddenly from out of the blue depths, a
shape emerges: the sleek, pale shadow of a 6-foot-long gray reef shark,
followed quickly by a couple of 10-foot-long Galápagos sharks. Within a
couple of heartbeats, you are surrounded by sharks on all sides. Do you
panic? Did you just drop into a scene from Open Water? No, you paid
$120 to be in the midst of these jaws of the deep. Of course, there is a 6-
by-6-by-10-foot aluminum shark cage separating you from all those teeth.
Looking for an unparalleled adventure, snorkelers? North Shore Shark
Adventures (% 808-228-5900; www.hawaiisharkadventures.com) has
what you’re looking for. Captain Joe Pavsek offers up-close-and-personal
encounters with Jaws from the safety of an aluminum cage. Scheduled
throughout the day from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., the two-hour tours take you
out from Haleiwa Small Boat Harbor 3 miles offshore in his 26-foot boat,
Kailolo, where he drops his cage into the cobalt-blue water. To make
sure that the predators of the deep appear, Captain Pavsek heaves
“chum” — a not very appetizing concoction of fish trimmings and
entrails — over the side. It’s much like ringing the dinner bell; after a few
minutes, the sharks arrive, ready to nosh. Depending on the sea condi-
tions and the weather, snorkelers can stay in the safety of the cage as
long as they want, with the man-eaters just inches away. You can expect
to see sharks ranging in size from 5 to 15 feet, generally of the gray reef,
Galápagos, and sandbar variety. Visibility is so clear — often up to 200
feet — that you can see them swimming in from the deep. The cage can
hold two to four snorkelers, who pay $120 per person for the two-hour
adventure; children ages 3 to 12 are charged $60 ($45 for riding on the
boat only). You’re also welcome to view the sharks from a more
respectable distance — the boat deck — for just $60. Discounts are
available for students and military.
Delving into the deep: Submarine rides
You can dip into Hawaii’s spectacular underwater world even if you
don’t swim by taking a submarine ride with Atlantis Adventures Oahu
(% 800-548-6262 or 808-973-9811; www.atlantisadventures.com; click
“Hawaii” then “Oahu”). Atlantis’s state-of-the-art subs deliver you a mile
offshore and deep beneath the surface to see not only clouds of tropical
fish and sea critters, but also sunken ships, the remains of two airliners,
and ongoing work on the University of Hawaii’s reef enhancement proj-
ect. Shuttle boats to the sub leave from Hilton Hawaiian Village Pier, on
the beach at 2005 Kalia Rd. (at Ala Moana Boulevard). The 90-minute
tours cost $80 to $95 for adults, $41 to $48 for kids (children must be at
least 36 inches tall), depending on the tour you choose. Online dis-
counts are available; you can also combine a submarine ride with a
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
178

dinner cruise. A word of warning: The ride is perfectly safe, but skip it if
you suffer from serious claustrophobia. On the other side of the coin: If
you’re a swimmer — even if you just have basic paddle skills — skip this
expensive adventure, don a mask, and hit the waves yourself instead for
a primo underwater experience.
Catching a wave
Book your surfing lesson, or your windsurfing lesson (see the following
section), for early in your stay. That way, if conditions aren’t right on
your scheduled day, you’ll have plenty of time to reschedule.
Learning to surf
If you’ve always dreamed of learning to surf, Oahu is the perfect place 
to do it.
Hands down, the best way to learn is with Hawaiian Fire (% 888-955-
7873 or 808-737-3473; www.hawaiianfire.com). In 2000, a group of
Honolulu City firefighters, tired of watching visitors get bad surf lessons,
decided to start their own surf school that would really teach first-
timers how to ride a wave, both with safety and a whole lot of fun — and
they do a great job. One of the keys to their success is that they run
their lessons at a secluded Leeward Oahu beach, about a half-hour from
Waikiki, which has ideal teachable rolling waves for beginners. Group
lessons ($99 per person) last two hours and include 45 minutes of on-
beach instruction, 75 minutes of in-the-water time, pickup and drop-off
at your Waikiki hotel, and all equipment you’ll need to ride the waves.
Groups average about ten people, and there are at least three instruc-
tors in the water for the duration of the lesson, which is a nice student/
teacher ratio for learning. If you prefer undivided attention, private les-
sons are available for $179 ($129 for kids under 12); children ages 10 and
under are required to take a private lesson.
At press time, you could save 15 percent on your group lesson by 
paying the fee in cash at the lesson. When you book, ask if this deal is
still available.
Another good option is the Hans Hedemann Surf School (% 808-924-
7778; www.hhsurf.com), whose pro instructors teach private and group
lessons in surfing and body boarding off the Diamond Head end of
Waikiki. Hans also has a North Shore location in the Turtle Bay Resort.
Prices start at $50 for an hour-long group lesson (five people max), $115
for one hour of private surf instruction and $150 for a two-hour private
lesson.
North Shore surf lessons are also offered Surf-N-Sea (% 800-899-7873 or
808-637-9887; www.surfnsea.com), the North Shore’s oldest surf shop.
Surf-N-Sea offers customized two-hour group lessons (which often go
longer) for beginners daily. Surf-N-Sea also offers two-hour stand-up pad-
dling (also known as beach boy surfing) lessons, which, as anyone who
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 179

reads People magazine knows, is the hot celebrity trend in wave riding.
Lessons are $85 per person.
On the Windward Coast, Kailua Sailboards & Kayaks, at Kailua Beach
Center, 130 Kailua Rd. (% 808-262-2555; www.kailuasailboards.com),
offers group surf lessons for $89 per person and private lessons for $109,
as well as surfboard and boogie board rentals.
If you want to take a more casual approach to learning, the Waikiki
beach boys swear that they can teach anybody to stand up on a surf-
board and catch a wave, as long as they have basic swimming skills. Go
early to the section of Waikiki Beach called Kuhio Beach, next to the
Moana Surfrider. Both Aloha Beach Service and Hawaii Beach Boys
Services offer surfing lessons for about $40 an hour, plus affordable surf-
board rentals to experienced wave riders (for use on Waikiki Beach
only). The small waves are also great for bodysurfing and boogie board-
ing, and both surf shacks are happy to rent you the appropriate gear.
Regular catamaran and outrigger canoe rides are offered from this
stretch of sand as well, usually for about 10 or 15 bucks a head; the
beach boys will call out for participants when they’re ready to go out.
(FYI: If you’re expecting Waikiki’s beach boys to be strapping young lads
on break between semesters, think again. Most of these perma-tanned
fellows haven’t been “boys” since the Nixon administration.)
For experienced surfers only
If you’re already a skilled surfer, stop at any surf shop to check the latest
wave conditions. A good surfing spot for advanced surfers is the Cliffs,
at the base of Diamond Head. The 4- to 6-foot waves churn here, allowing
for high-performance surfing — and the views of Diamond Head are
great. Call or stop at the Hans Hedemann Surf School in the Diamond
Head Beach Hotel, 2947 Kalakaua Ave. (% 808-924-7778; www.hhsurf.
com), to rent a board and check conditions, or call and schedule an
advanced lesson. Surfboards are also available for rent on the beach 
at Waikiki. (See Aloha Beach Service and Hawaii Beach Boys Services in
the preceding section.)
On the Windward Coast, board rentals are available at Kailua Sailboards
& Kayaks, at Kailua Beach Center, 130 Kailua Rd. (% 808-262-2555;
www.kailuasailboards.com).
Of course, if it’s winter and you really know what you’re doing — or you
simply want to watch those who do — visit one of the North Shore
beaches. (See “On the North Shore,” earlier in this chapter.) Head to
Surf-N-Sea, 62–595 Kamehameha Hwy., Haleiwa (% 800-899-7873 or
808-637-9887; www.surfnsea.com), for board rentals and intermediate
and advanced instruction. Lessons are $195 for intermediate and
advanced surfers. Skilled surfers can also go out on a half-day safari,
which takes in some great hidden surf spots, for $220. Do not — I repeat,
do not — get in the water on the North Shore in winter unless you are
appropriately skilled to handle the big waves.

Ocean kayaking for everyone
One of my absolute favorite ocean activities is kayaking to the Mokuleias,
the two charmingly petite islets about 11⁄2 miles offshore from Lanikai and
Kailua beaches. It’s an easy trip that anyone with reasonably good paddle
strength can do; I recommend a kayak for two if you’re inexperienced or
would simply like to share the paddle duties. You can make your first
stop for a bit of exploring at the small, flat shelf island that’s only about a
half-mile offshore. It’s another mile or so across the calm bay to reach the
beautiful, remote beach for sunning, picnicking, and exploring (landing is
allowable only on the near islet; the far islet is off-limits).
The place to launch your kayak is at the north end of Kailua Beach Park;
follow the beach path that runs alongside Kalapawai Market. Two local
kayaking outfitters provide convenient rentals. Kailua Sailboards &
Kayaks, at Kailua Beach Center, 130 Kailua Rd., cater-cornered from
Kalapawai Market (% 808-262-2555; www.kailuasailboards.com),
offers half-day rentals for $39 for a single kayak, $49 for a double kayak.
High-performance single kayaks, which are lighter and faster in the
water, are also available for $49 for a half-day. If price is not a big con-
cern, I recommend the high-performance kayaks; otherwise, the stan-
dard kayaks are just fine. Kayaks are also available for full-day rentals,
but a half-day is enough to enjoy this excursion.
If you rent from Kailua Sailboards & Kayaks, reserve your kayaks in
advance; kayaks can even be booked online. I recommend touring in the
morning for the calmest conditions. You’ll have to go to the shop, where
you’ll watch an instructional video and be assigned equipment and a
kayak on a pull cart for an awkward but worthwhile ten-minute walk to
the beach. Kailua Sailboards & Kayaks also offers guided kayaking tours
for those who want to see more; check the Web site for details.
If you’d rather not drag your own kayak to the launch site, book your
kayaks instead with Twogood Kayaks Hawaii, in Kailua town at 345
Hahani St. (% 808-262-5656; www.twogoodkayaks.com). You’ll have to
go to the shop to check in, then drive to the launch site on an estuary at
Kailua Beach, where Twogood Kayaks will deliver and help you launch
your kayaks. At $25 per person for a half-day tandem rental, Twogood’s
rental rates are about the same as Kailua Sailboards (see above), but
you can get a full-day rental for just $10 more. Twogood Kayaks also
offers lessons for all levels of kayakers, from beginning to racers.
Windsurfing and kiteboarding
Kailua Beach, on the Windward Coast, is the best place to learn to wind-
surf — and the folks at Naish Hawaii, 155A Hamakua Dr., Kailua (% 800-
767-6068 or 808-262-6068; www.naish.com/lessons.html), are just the
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 181

ones to teach you. Beginning, intermediate, and advanced lessons are
available, with prices starting at $75 for one person, $100 for two people
for private 11⁄2-hour lessons (includes use of equipment for 1-1⁄2 hours 
following the lesson), and $45 per person for a three-hour group clinic
(includes use of equipment for a half-hour following the lesson). Private
intermediate or advanced lessons are $65 an hour. There’s no minimum
age requirement, but you must weigh at least 75 pounds. (Champion and
pioneer windsurfer Robbie Naish and his team of instructors have
taught kids as young as 8 or 9.) You can expect to be up and sailing (in
one direction, anyway) in three to four hours; it takes 12 to 20 hours to
become any good at it. They’ll also teach you how to kiteboard if you’re
up to the challenge. Equipment rentals are available for experienced
windsurfers and kiteboarders.
Kailua Sailboards & Kayaks, at Kailua Beach Center, 130 Kailua Rd. 
(% 808-262-2555; www.kailuasailboards.com), also offers beginner,
intermediate, and advanced windsurfing package that includes hotel
pick-up, gear rental, a two-hour lesson, and time to practice afterward
for $89 (beginners) and $99 (intermediate and advanced). If you’re inter-
ested in kiteboarding lessons, call the shop for details.
Scuba diving
Oahu is a wonderful place for wreck diving. One of the more famous
wrecks in Hawaii is the Mahi, a 185-foot former minesweeper with an
abundant marine population that looks like it came straight out of
Finding Nemo. Schools of lemon butterfly fish, eagle rays, green sea tur-
tles, manta rays, and white-tipped sharks cruise by, and eels slither from
the wreck.
For nonwreck diving, Kahuna Canyon, a massive underwater amphithea-
ter, is among the island’s best offshore summer dive spots. But your
smartest bet may be to discuss with your outfitter the best places to go.
Whether you’re a first-timer in search of a resort course or a veteran
diver just looking for a ride, the outfitter to contact is Aaron’s Dive
Shop, 307 Hahani St., Kailua (% 888-84-SCUBA or 808-262-2333; www.
hawaii-scuba.com), Hawaii’s oldest and largest dive shop, in business
for more than three decades. Aaron’s offers boat and beach dive excur-
sions at all of Oahu’s top dive spots, plus night dives, cave dives, pho-
tography dives, and more. Prices for two-tank dives start at $125, with
all equipment, but check the Web site for online discounts. Aaron’s 
can also offer uncertified introductory dives, or PADI (Professional
Association of Diving Instructors) certify you in three days if you’re
ready to commit. Also in Kailua is Oahu Dive Center, 345 Hahani St. 
(% 866-933-3483 or 808-263-7333; www.oahudivecenter.com), which
offers instruction, certification, and dive tours at similar rates.
If you don’t want to leave Waikiki, South Seas Aquatics, 2155 Kalakaua
Ave. (near Beach Walk), Ste. 112 (% 808-922-0852; www.ssahawaii.
com), can meet all your scuba needs, from daily dive trips ($90–$100,
including gear) to full PADI open-water certification ($400, including four
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
182

dives, or $250 if you do your book and pool work at home, before you
arrive on Oahu).
Safety is key when diving. See “Ocean Safety,” in the Quick Concierge at
the end of this book, for diving tips.
Sportfishing
Oahu-based Sportfish Hawaii (% 877-388-1376 or 808-396-2607; www.
sportfishhawaii.com) can book a first-class charter for you out of
Kewalo Basin, the main charter-boat marina on Oahu. From Waikiki, take
Kalakaua west beyond Ala Moana Center; Kewalo Basin is on the left,
across from Ward Centre. On lucky days, the captains display the day’s
catch after they tuck back into their slips in the afternoon. Prices range
from $750 to $938 for a full-day charter just for you and five friends; $550
to $721 for a half-day exclusive; or from $188 for a full-day share charter
(you share the boat with five other people). Party-boat trips feature
bottom fishing for $63, including a barbecue lunch and transportation
from Waikiki hotels. A nighttime shark hunt is $125 per person.
Exploring on Dry Land
You may be able to save money on a few of your big-ticket Oahu activities
by booking them through Maui-based Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 888-
621-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com), which also books
activities on Oahu. Tom Barefoot is a very reliable activities center that’s
willing to split its commissions with you so that everybody comes out
ahead. These discounts may add up to substantial savings, especially if
you’re bringing the entire family along. At press time, you can save on a
number of water adventures recommended earlier in this chapter, plus
admission fees to such attractions as Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park,

Taking a guided tour
If your mobility is limited, or if you have limited time and want an intro-
ductory look at the big picture, you may want to hook up with a guided
tour. If you’ve rented a car and can get around easily, though, I’d recom-
mend going out on your own. Most tour operators do little more than
whiz by the major sights in tour buses — including some places where
you may actually want to spend some time — or charge you an arm and
a leg to take you to places like the Arizona Memorial, which is absolutely
free to tour if you show up on your own. If you do need to take a guided
bus tour try Polynesian Adventure Tours (% 800-622-3011 or 808-
833-3000; www.polyad.com), which offers a range of tours in minivans,
big-windowed mini-coaches (good for small groups and big views), and
full-size buses; Roberts Hawaii (% 866-898-2519 or 808-954-8652; www.
robertshawaii.com), which offers a similar slate of tours, plus add-ons
such as sightseeing cruises, luau, and dinner shows; or E Noa Tours
(% 800-824-8804 or 808-591-2561; www.enoa.com), whose guided
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 183

minibus tours around the city and the island tend to be smaller than
those offered by its competitors, and cheaper, because the tours are inti-
mate enough to allow the driver to serve as your tour guide. Ask about
online booking, AARP, and AAA discounts.
If you intend to visit the National Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl
Crater (see the section “Visiting Honolulu’s top attractions,” later in this
chapter), don’t go with a tour if you want to look around and pay your
respects. Tour buses are not allowed to disembark passengers in the
Punchbowl; they can merely drive through.
The Waikiki Trolley (% 800-824-8804 or 808-593-2822; www.waikiki
trolley.com), an open-air motorized trolley similar to a San Francisco
cable car, offers narrated hop-on, hop-off tours throughout Honolulu and
select farther-flung destinations; for complete details, see Chapter 10.
Guided cultural tours
The Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association (% 808-441-1404) has
outlined a fascinating walk along the Waikiki Historic Trail. You’ll learn
about Hawaii’s royal past as you explore the portion of the trail along
Prince Kuhio Beach, ending at the Honolulu Zoo. Two-hour guided tours
are available only for groups, but you can download a trail guide and
map that you can follow on your own self-guided tour at www.waikiki
historictrail.com.
If you’re a foodie who really wants an insider’s view on island-style
dining, don’t miss the opportunity to spend a day or an evening with
Hawaii Food Tours (% 800-715-2468 or 808-926-3663; www.hawaii
foodtours.com); see “Dining Out” in Chapter 10 for details.
Guided eco-hikes
Mauka Makai Excursions (% 866-896-0596; www.hawaiianecotours.
net) offers half- and full-day tours revealing a hidden side of Oahu that
even most island residents haven’t seen. The emphasis is on archaeol-
ogy and ancient history, but Mauka Makai’s full- and half-day tours are
also a great choice for nature walkers. There are a variety of distances
and difficulties. On the full-day “Legends and Myths” tour, guide Dominic
Aki can show you hidden petroglyphs, the ruins of a royal palace tucked
away in a bamboo forest, an ancient temple presiding over modern sub-
urbia, and other cultural treasures, complete with fascinating narrative,
on an easy 2[bf]1/2-mile hike. “Sacred Sites of the Oahu’s North Shore”
takes you farther afield on a five-mile, Saturdays-only hike. If you don’t
want to commit a full day, take the “Sacred Sites Walking Eco Tour,”
which will show you three or four satisfying ancient sites before noon.
Call to inquire about other adventures. Prices range from $50 to $80 for
adults, $40 to $60 for kids 6 to 17, including hotel pickup. Discounts are
available if you book through Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 888-621-3601 or

Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
184

Visiting Honolulu’s top attractions
Put on your walking shoes, because Oahu boasts the finest collection of
sights and attractions in the islands, bar none.
Bishop Museum
If you leave the beach to visit just one museum while you’re in Hawaii, make
it this one. The state museum of cultural history houses the world’s great-
est collection of natural and cultural artifacts from Hawaii and the Pacific.
If your time is limited, head straight to the Hawaiian Hall, which provides
a wonderful introduction to island life and culture. You’ll see the great feath-
ered capes of kings, the last grass shack in Hawaii, preindustrial Polynesian
art, and even the skeleton of a 50-foot sperm whale. Unfortunately, the
Hawaiian Hall is closed for renovation until mid-2009, so call ahead or check
the Web site for the opening schedule as well as the updated daily tour, tra-
ditional craft-making, and hula show schedules. In the meantime, focus
your energy on the Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kahili Room, where some of
the museum’s famed Hawaiian monarchy collection is on display, as well
as the Polynesian Hall, representing the peoples of Polynesia, Micronesia,
and Melanesia. The Richard T. Mamiya Science Adventure Center is a cut-
ting-edge interactive facility focused on understanding the fundamentals
of Hawaii’s natural environment, from oceanography to volcanology. The
Hawaiian Sports Hall of Fame is here, too. Call or check the Web site for the
current schedule of exhibitions and planetarium shows.
See map p. 164. 1525 Bernice St., just off the Lunililo Freeway (H-1), Honolulu. % 808-
847-3511 or 808-848-4136 for planetarium info. www.bishopmuseum.org. To get
there: From the H-1, take the Houghtailing exit; turn right (toward the mountains); at
the 1st light, turn left onto Bernice Street; the museum will be 1⁄2 block past Kapalama
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 185
Getting “Lost” on Oahu
As any fan of TV’s most cryptic series knows, Lost is filmed predominately on the island
of Oahu — and there are a number of ways to experience the island’s Oceanic
815–related hot spots. Kos Tours (% 808-561-2440; www.hummertourshawaii.
com) offers a five-hour guided Hummer tour to top Lost locations as well as sites from
Oahu-filmed movies such as 50 First Dates, Godzilla, and Jurassic Park for $129 per
person (transportation from Waikiki included). Or, go right to the source and book the
Movie Sites and Ranch Tour at Kualoa Ranch (% 800-231-7321 or 808-237-8515; www.
kualoa.com), site of many of the show’s most famous scenes, such as Hurley’s
homemade golf course; if you’re here at the right time, you might even see cast and
crew in action. At $19 per person, it’s one of the island’s best sightseeing bargains. Or,
if you’re a do-it-yourselfer, check out Lost Virtual Tour (www.lostvirtualtour.
com), an episode-by-episode guide of locations around the island, diligently identified
and signposted online by what must be the biggest Lost fans in Hawaii. It’s the ideal
source for the Jack and Kate fan with a rent-a-car, a good map, and a Dharma-infused
sense of adventure.

Street on your left. Admission: $16 adults, $13 seniors and kids 4–12. Open: Daily 
9 a.m.–5 p.m.
The Contemporary Museum
Housed in the historic Spalding house, a beautiful 1925 estate in one of
Honolulu’s most exclusive residential communities, TCM is best for fans of
modern art (if you want to see Hawaiian art, visit the Honolulu Academy
of Arts, listed later in the chapter, instead). Temporary exhibits predomi-
nate, filling the main gallery space and changing six to eight times a year,
so it’s catch as catch can — sometimes terrific, sometimes not so much.
(It’s best to check the online calendar before you go.) The museum cur-
rently doesn’t have space to display its entire permanent collection, so
exhibitions rotate a selection of highlights, including works from such
artists as Jasper Johns, Jim Dine, and William Wegman. David Hockney’s
postmodern stage sets for Ravel’s opera L’Enfant et Les Sortilèges are
always on display, but they’re something of a disappointment; better are
the lovely Japanese gardens for strolling, the impressive sculpture garden,
and the Contemporary Cafe, one of Honolulu’s best-kept secrets for lunch.
Docent tours are available daily at 1:30 p.m., the best time to go for the full
story on what you’re seeing. No reservation is necessary; just meet at the
front lanai at about 1:25 p.m. to join in.
The museum also keeps an annex in downtown Honolulu known as The
Contemporary Museum at First Hawaiian Center, 999 Bishop St., that’s
open free to the public Monday through Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
and on Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
See map p. 164. 2411 Makiki Heights Dr., Honolulu. % 808-526-1322. www.tcmhi.
org. To get there: Take Kalakaua Avenue to Beretania Street and make a left; turn
right on Keeamoku, turn right on Wilder to Makaki Street, turn left, and follow it up
the hill; turn left on Makiki Heights Drive and proceed to the museum (which will be
on your right). Admission: $5 adults, $3 seniors and students, free for kids 12 and
under. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m., Sun noon–4 p.m.
Diamond Head Crater
Called Mt. Leahi (lee-ah-hi) by the Hawaiians, Waikiki’s most famous land-
mark is well worth the climb, if you have the stamina for it. The short but
steep 11⁄4-mile, 11⁄2-hour round-trip climb is a lot of fun — and the 360-degree
views from the top are spectacular.
To prepare for your hike to the top, wear a reasonable pair of walking
shoes. Rubber-soled shoes with good traction are a must; sneakers or
hiking shoes are preferred, but Tevas are fine as long as they’re attached
to your feet. Bring a bottle of water and a camera; you may also want a
flashlight (not a must), since you walk through a few dark tunnels. If you
have binoculars, bring them too.
Go early in the day, before the afternoon sun starts beating down. The trail
head begins in the parking lot on the crater’s inland side and proceeds
along a paved walkway (with handrails) that turns rocky as it ascends the
slope before it transforms into two very steep staircases (99 and 75 steps,
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
186

respectively). You’ll pass old World War I and II pillboxes, gun emplace-
ments, and tunnels built as part of the Pacific defense network. Yes, you’ll
be climbing lots of steps, but it’s well worth the effort — after you reach
the observation post up top, the views are indescribable.
I love this hike, but don’t do it if you will not be comfortable with the ver-
tical climb or the exertion.
See map p. 164. Access road at Monsarrat (also called Diamond Head Avenue) and
18th avenues. To get there: Follow Kalakaua Avenue to Kapiolani Park; turn north on
Monserrat Avenue and follow it around to the back of Diamond Head. Just past
Kapiolani Community College, turn right and go 2⁄3 mile to the parking lot. Admission: $1
individual walk-in, or $5 per car. Open: Daily 6 a.m.–6 p.m. (last hike start at 4:30 p.m.).
Foster Botanical Garden
This intimate, leafy oasis amid the high-rises of downtown Honolulu is a
living museum of plants — some rare and endangered — collected from
the tropical regions of the world. Of special interest are 26 “Exceptional
Trees” protected by state law, a large palm collection, a primitive cycad
garden, and a hybrid orchid collection. It’s easy to tour the garden in a
half-hour or so, but bring insect repellent because this is a buggy place.
Guided tours are offered weekdays at 1 p.m.; call for reservations.
See map p. 164. 50 N. Vineyard Blvd. (at Nuuanu Avenue, across the street from Zippy’s),
downtown Honolulu. % 808-522-7066 or 808-552-7060. www.co.honolulu.hi.us/
parks/hbg. Admission: $5 adults, $1 kids 6–12. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Hawaii Maritime Center
If you’re interested in Hawaii’s rich maritime heritage, or you’re just nos-
talgic for the long-gone cruise-ship days, stop at this harborfront museum
(the maritime branch of the Bishop Museum, listed earlier in this chapter)
for an hour-long visit. The museum tells the islands’ complete maritime
story, from the ancient journey of Polynesian voyagers to Hawaii’s whaling
era to the high-style Matson Line days of the 1940s and ’50s. The full-size
humpback whale skeleton is worth the price of admission alone. Outside,
the famous Hokulea, a reconstruction of the double-hulled sailing canoe
that the ancients used to reach Hawaii, is moored next to the Falls of Clyde,
a four-masted, fully rigged 1878 schooner. The schooner is closed to visi-
tors as the museum searches for a benefactor to fund $32 million in reno-
vations, but you can still enjoy it harborside.

to Aloha Tower Marketplace), Honolulu. % 808-847-3511. www.bishopmuseum.
org/exhibits/hmc. Admission: $7.50 adults, $4.50 kids 6–17. Open: Daily 
9:00 a.m.–5 p.m.
Hawai’i State Art Museum
This new-in-2002 museum houses the largest collection of art by Hawaii-
based artists. All of the contemporary works that are currently on display
were created by artists who live in the islands; in many cases, Western art
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 187

forms blend harmoniously with folk art forms fed by the traditions of
Hawaii and its many feeder cultures from the Pacific Islands and Asia. The
museum is well worth visiting if you want to understand the creative heart
that beats within these beautiful islands. Free “Live from the Lawn” music
performances are held on the museum’s lawn as part of First Friday,
Honolulu’s Downtown Gallery Walk, held on the first Friday of every month
from 5 to 9 p.m.
See map p. 164 No. 1 Capitol District Bldg., 250 S. Hotel St. (at Richards Street), 2nd
Floor, downtown Honolulu. % 808-596-9958. www.hawaii.gove/sfca; select
“Hawai’i State Art Museum.” Admission: Free! Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Honolulu Academy of Arts
This first-class museum houses one of the finest collections of Asian art in
the country, a top-notch collection of American and European masters,
and terrific ancient and Pacific art, all in a stunning open-plan, Hawaiian-
style building that first opened its doors in 1927. See what’s on when
you’re in town — the temporary exhibits can range from treasures of
ancient Egypt to the world’s greatest collection of aloha shirts — or just
stop by to explore a few rooms of the excellent permanent collection.
Highlights include the John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery of
Hawaiian Arts; the Textile Gallery; and the James A. and Mari Michener
Gallery, boasting a fantastic collection of Japanese wood block prints
tagged with insightful, delightful observances by the author himself. It’s
easy to spend an hour here, or four — it all depends on your interest level.
No matter how long you stay, be sure to spend a few minutes contemplat-
ing one of the courtyard Zen gardens — and a few extra perusing the excel-
lent Academy Shop. The museum is a real delight for any art lover! Guided
one-hour tours are offered Tuesday through Saturday at 10:15 a.m., 11:30
a.m., and 1:30 p.m.; Sunday at 1:15 p.m.

Honolulu Zoo
Located in the heart of Waikiki’s lovely Kapiolani Park, this 43-acre zoo is
a real charmer. Globe-trotting highlights include the Karibuni Reserve, an
African savanna habitat with exotic African mammals roaming around in
the open, separated from visitors by hidden rails and moats; a wonderful
South American aviary filled with colorful toucans and other eye-catching
birds; and the Tropical Forest exhibit, a draw for horticultural buffs as well
as animal lovers. The Children’s Zoo features friendly critters who love to
be petted, including a llama, a monitor lizard, and a potbellied pig.

Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
188

Iolani Palace
I highly recommend visiting this royal palace, the official residence of the
last monarchs of Hawaii: King David Kalakaua (ka-la-cow-ah) and his sister,
Queen Liliuokalani (li-lee-uh-ka-la-nee). The good news is that, thanks to a
recent expansion of ways to see the palace, it’s now easier than ever. You
can see the Italian Renaissance structure on a docent-led 90-minute tour,
which tells the fascinating story of the coming of Western ways to the
islands, the rebirth of Hawaiian culture in the last years of royal rule, and
the story of the monarchy’s final defeat in a bloodless coup, or on a 50-
minute self-guided audio tour, which covers the same ground and tells a
similar story a bit less personally but a bit more efficiently.
Very Important: The Iolani Palace Grand Tour (the guided tour), offered
in the mornings, sells out regularly, so you must call ahead and reserve
your tour spots. Call at least a day ahead, or a few days in advance if you
don’t want to be disappointed. (It took me three tries before I was able to
make my first visit.) Leave the little ones behind, however, because they’ll
be less than enthralled. It’s generally not necessary to pre-book for the 50-
minute self-guided Audio Tour, which is offered in the afternoons. This
shorter self-guided tour is an ideal alternative for those with limited time,
limited budgets, or limited attention spans.
You can also take the self-guided Gallery Tour, which takes you through the
lower galleries, which house the Hawaiian crown jewels plus royal gowns,
the re-created chamberlain’s office, and other period goodies. A real high-
light is an ancient feather cloak that was the symbolic trophy won in the
battle that united the Hawaiian Islands in the first place. The Gallery Tour
does not require reservations. If you opt for the either of the Grand or Audio
tours, the galleries will automatically be part of your Iolani experience.
The Royal Hawaiian Band plays free concerts on the palace grounds most
Fridays at noon. You can confidently expect the band to play Aloha ’Oe,
which was penned by Queen Liliuokalani around 1890, prior to her depo-
sition and the permanent overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. Call to
confirm that the band will be playing before you head over.

tours. Grand Tour times: Every 20 minutes Tues–Sat 9–11 a.m. Audio Tour tickets: $12
adults, $5 kids 5–17; kids under 5 not admitted. Audio Tour times: Every 10 minutes
Tues–Sat 11:45 a.m.–3:30 p.m. Tickets should be picked up 15 minutes before either
tour. Both grand and audio tours include a screening of the 16-minute video on the
Hawaiian monarchy and the palace. Tickets to Galleries only: $6 adults, $3 for kids
5–17; free for kids under 5. Gallery hours: Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Makapuu Point State Wayside
I just love this 1-mile uphill hike, an enjoyable walk through the island’s
southeastern desert landscape that leads to one of the most spectacular
vistas on the island. The trail isn’t marked, but it’s quite obvious; just
follow the directions below until you see the black gate on the ocean side
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 189

of the highway. It’s okay to come through; the gate is just meant to pre-
vent cars. Follow the 1-mile paved road up the hill to the lighthouse and
lookout; even though it leads uphill, the slope is gradual as it curves
around the point, so anyone wearing good-soled shoes and in reasonably
good shape can handle it. The contrast between the cactus-dotted land-
scape and the deep-blue waves below is reason enough to come; however,
the lookout also offers a good place to watch whales between January and
March, so bring binoculars. Bring drinking water and wear sunscreen at
any time of year. You might also want to pack a picnic lunch, because there
are plenty of flat spots for you to enjoy it and the view.
See map p. 162. Take Kalanianaole Highway (Highway 72) past Hanauma Bay and
Sandy Beach to Makapuu Head, Oahu’s southeastern tip; look for a black gate bear-
ing a sign that says “No Vehicles Allowed” on a gate to the right. Park on the side of
the highway with the other cars.
Mission Houses Museum
American missionaries set up housekeeping here in the 1820s with the goal
of converting the native Hawaiians to Christianity. This museum tells the
story of the arrival of Protestant missionaries and the subsequent cultural
sea change that swept through the islands. Three restored mission build-
ings are open for exploring; they’re filled with furnishings and artifacts
dating back to this period. One-hour guided tours of the visitor center,
frame house, and printing office are offered twice daily.

National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl Crater
This collapsed volcanic cone in the middle of Honolulu — known in
Hawaiian as Puowaina, roughly translated as “Hill of Sacrifice” — offers
some of the most spectacular views in the city. But most people don’t
come for the views (although you shouldn’t miss them; the observation
platform is on the ocean side of the crater). They come to honor the more
than 48,000 victims, buried over 113 verdant acres, predominantly of three
American wars whose theaters were Asia and the Pacific: World War II and
the Korean and Vietnam wars. Among the graves are many unmarked ones
bearing only the date December 7, 1941, the day Pearl Harbor was bombed
and the United States entered the Last Great War. Some of the honorees
are destined to be unknown forever; others are world-famous, like WWII
war correspondent Ernie Pyle and astronaut Ellison Onizuka, who died in
the 1986 Challenger explosion. The Courts of the Missing’s white stone
tablets bear the names of 28,788 Americans missing in action in WWII. You
can search for any specific grave locations on the computer in the office,
near the entrance, where you’ll also find a small tribute to some service-
men buried in this hallowed ground.

Nuuanu Pali Lookout
Sometimes gale-force winds howl through this misty mountain pass, so
hold onto your hat. But if you walk up from the parking lot to the precipice,
you’ll be rewarded with a stunning view of the luxuriant Windward Coast.
Bring a jacket or sweater with you because the weather’s windy and cool
up here year-round, even when it’s 85°F and sunny at the beach.
See map p. 164. Near the summit of Pali Highway (Highway 61); take the Nuuanu Pali
Lookout turnoff.
Puu Ualakaa State Park
The summit of this 1,048-foot-high hill offers majestic panoramic views
over the whole of Honolulu and Waikiki, all the way from Diamond Head to
the east to Punchbowl, Pearl Harbor, and beyond to the west. Daytime
offers clear viewing, while sunset, with the bright lights of the city below,
is pure magic.
See map p. 164. On Round Top Drive. To get there: From Waikiki, take Ala Wai
Boulevard to McCully Street, turn right; cross over the H-1 freeway and turn left onto
Wilder Street; turn right onto Makiki Street and go onward and upward about 3 miles.
Park in the 2nd lot and walk to the viewing platform. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 
7 a.m. to sunset.
Waikiki Aquarium
The small but first-class Waikiki Aquarium, part of the University of Hawaii,
is a must for anybody who wants to know what they’re actually seeing when
they’re snorkeling. With over 2,500 animals representing more than 420
species and a world-class reputation in coral reef life, the aquarium features
tanks full of an amazing variety of marine life found in the offshore waters;
a fascinating jellyfish tank; a Hawaiian reef habitat with sharks and eels; a
kid-friendly touch tank with urchins and sea cucumbers; and habitats for
the endangered Hawaiian monk seal and green sea turtle. Newer exhibits
focus on biodiversity and the world’s fragile coral reefs. You can watch the
monk seals being trained and fed most days; call for the daily schedule.

9 a.m.–5 p.m. (last entry at 4:30 p.m.).
In Pearl Harbor
If you want to see all of Pearl Harbor’s sights, arrive early and plan on
spending the better part of a day here. To reach Pearl Harbor, drive 
west on the H-1 freeway or Nimitz Highway (reachable via Ala Moana
Boulevard) past the Honolulu International Airport; take the USS Arizona
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 191

Memorial exit (no. 15-A). Follow the green-and-white highway signs to
the free parking lots.
Shuttle service is available from Waikiki daily from 6:50 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.
for $11 per person round-trip; to schedule pickup at your hotel, call
V.I.P. Trans. at % 866-836-0317 or 808-836-0317 24 hours in advance
(www.viptrans.com). If you’d rather take TheBus, hop on no. 20 (see
Chapter 10 for complete information on TheBus system). Either way,
expect the ride to take about an hour from Waikiki. (It’s about a half-hour
if you drive yourself.)
Security for visitors is tight at Pearl Harbor. At press time, the following
items were not permitted at all: baby strollers with pockets and compart-
ments, backpacks, diaper bags, fanny packs, camera bags, purses (yes,
purses), luggage, shopping bags, and any other items that allow conceal-
ment. (Remember, this is an active military base.) Storage units are avail-
able in the parking lot of the USS Arizona for rent from a private vendor so
visitors can check their prohibited items for a $2 fee; size restrictions
apply (no bigger than 30 inches by 30 inches by 18 inches), and large lug-
gage cannot be accepted. The concierge at your hotel or condo should
have the latest information; you can also call % 808-422-0561 or check the
National Parks Web site at www.nps.gov/usar for the latest restrictions.
It’s never a smart idea to leave valuables in your rental car, and Pearl
Harbor is a high-crime area — so that piece of good advice goes double
here.
See the “Honolulu’s Beaches and Attractions” map on p. 164.
USS Arizona Memorial and Museum
On December 7, 1941, while moored in Pearl Harbor, this 608-foot battle-
ship was bombed in a Japanese air raid. The USS Arizona sank in nine min-
utes without firing a shot, taking 1,177 sailors and Marines to a fiery death
and plunging the United States into World War II. Today, boat launches take
you out to the stark white 184-foot memorial that spans the sunken hull of
the Arizona, which lies 6 feet below the surface of the sea. The memorial
contains the ship’s bell, recovered from the wreckage, and a room with the
names of the dead carved in stone.
Try to arrive early at the visitor center (which is operated jointly by the
National Parks Service and the U.S. Navy) to avoid the huge crowds
because advance reservations are not taken and waits of an hour or two
are common. Sometimes, if crowds are big, they stop selling tickets
entirely at noon. While you’re waiting for the shuttle to take you out to the
ship — you’ll be issued a number and time of departure, which you must
pick up yourself — you can explore the small but arresting museum, which
features personal mementos, photos, and historic documents. An inform-
ative and moving 20-minute film precedes your trip to the ship. Allow
about three hours for your visit and be sure to remain respectfully silent
when you’re on the actual memorial.

USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park
The USS Bowfin is one of only 15 World War II submarines still in existence
today. You can go below deck of this famous submarine — nicknamed 
the “Pearl Harbor Avenger” for its successful retaliatory attacks on the
Japanese — and see how the 80-man crew lived during wartime. The
museum holds an impressive collection of submarine-related artifacts, 
the Waterfront Memorial honors submariners lost during World War II, 
and the mini-theater shows a constant run of sub-related videos.
If you’re planning to visit both the USS Bowfin and the Battleship Missouri
(see the next listing), purchase a combination ticket, which will save you
a few dollars.
See map p. 162. 11 Arizona Memorial Dr. (next to the USS Arizona Memorial Visitor
Center), Pearl Harbor. % 808-423-1341. www.bowfin.org. Admission to sub and
museum: $10 adults, $6 seniors and military, $4 kids 4–12 (kids under 4 are not
allowed on the submarine, but can visit the museum and mini-theater). Admission
to museum only: $5 adults, $3 kids. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m. (last tour at 4:30 p.m.).
Combination tickets available for the Bowfin plus an unguided tour of the Missouri:
$20 adults, $10 kids.
Battleship Missouri Memorial
The newest addition to Pearl Harbor’s Battleship Row memorial fleet is
this 58,000-ton, 887-foot battleship — the last one the U.S. Navy built —
which served in three wars, but is most famous for being the site of
Japanese surrender to Douglas MacArthur and the Allied forces in 1945.
Decommissioned in 1955, the Missouri went back into action to the Gulf
War before its final retirement to Hawaii in 1998. After you check in at the
visitor center at the USS Bowfin (see previous listing), you’ll be shuttled by
trolley to Ford Island for ship boarding. You’re free to explore the mam-
moth battleship from bow to stern after you watch a short informational
film, which is a blast: You can see the biggest guns the Navy ever built,
climb up the flying bridge, visit the officer’s quarters, and experience how
sailors lived at sea. I highly recommend hooking up with one of the hour-
long guided tours led by retired military veterans, which offer the best
insights; you can pair this with a two-hour AcousticGuide tour for the com-
plete experience, or choose to take the AcousticGuide tour only. For the
premier battleship experience, opt for the Explorer’s Tour, a 90-minute
tour that goes behind the scenes to explore the fire rooms, battery rooms
(housing the vintage computers that controlled the massive gun turrets),
machinery, crew berthing areas, and working rooms. Allow about three
hours total for your visit if you plan on working in a tour. Hard-core mili-
tary junkies should inquire about other specialty tours, including the
overnight Encampment Tours.
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 193

The battleship is scheduled to be dry-docked for repairs — including sand-
blasting and repainting of the hull and teak deck replacement — for two to
three months in 2009. Therefore, call ahead to be sure the battleship is
open to visitors before you go.

Sea Life Park
This marine-themed park is Hawaii’s very own version of SeaWorld, and
it’s lots of fun, especially for families. Highlights include a sea lion feeding
pool; the quarter-million-gallon Hawaiian Reef Tank, brimming with tropi-
cal fish plus a few sharks and stingrays; performing seals, dolphins, and
penguins strutting their smarts and skill in choreographed shows, which
run every 45 minutes (it takes about two hours to see all four shows); and
a pirate-themed play area for the little ones. The chief curiosity, though, is
the world’s only “wholphin,” a genuine genetic cross between a false killer
whale and an Atlantic bottle-nosed dolphin. On-site marine biologists oper-
ate a recovery center for endangered marine life that allows you to visit
with rehabilitated Hawaiian monk seals and seabirds.
Sea Life Park offers a full variety of interactive programs that allow you to
get up-close-and-personal with the park’s residents according to your age,
budget, interest, and swimming ability. The Hawaiian Ray Encounter lets
you snorkel with stingrays for a $15 add-on fee. Sea Trek Adventure gives
you the opportunity to actually dive into the Hawaiian Reef Tank with a
guide for 40 minutes (including orientation). No previous diving experi-
ence necessary; the cost on top of park admission is $59 per person, and
you must be 12 or older to participate. The Dolphin Aloha allows you a
brief 15-minute interaction with dolphins in a poolside environment (read:
no swimming); you’ll learn communication techniques and even be
allowed to kiss your new friends. The cost is $69 for adults, $59 for kids
ages 5 to 12 (kids under age 5 participate free; all children under age 8
must be accompanied by an adult). The 45-minute Dolphin Encounter
allows for shallow-water interaction with the dolphins. The cost is $99 for
adults, $69 for kids 6 to 12. A more in-depth 45-minute Dolphin Royal
Swim that includes an exciting dual-dolphin dorsal fin ride is $149 (no kids
under age 12). If sea lions are more your style, try the 30-minute Sea Lion
Discovery swim program for $99 adults, $69 kids 8 to 12 (no kids under 8).
Park admission is included in all dolphin and sea lion interaction pro-
grams. Not surprisingly, all of the animal interaction programs are in high
demand, so reserve your spots in advance. Bring towels if you’re planning
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu

to participate in any of these. For details on these and a half-dozen other
cool special programs, visit the Web site or call % 808-259-2500. Space is
limited, so reserve in advance to avoid disappointment.
Sea Life Park also offers the family-friendly Sea Life Luau on Wednesday,
Friday, and Sunday nights that includes a 15-minute dolphin show as well
as the usual luau entertainment. It’s relaxing and fun, and a great way to
see the highlights of the park if you don’t have a whole day to spare. For
further details, see Chapter 10 or contact the park directly.

Exploring the rest of the island
Oahu has so much to offer that you’ll certainly never lack for things to
do. The following are standouts beyond Honolulu that you won’t want 
to miss.
Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park
This 25-acre water-theme amusement park is the place to play if the beach
just isn’t enough for you. Highlights include an inner-tube cruise along an
800-foot “river,” two phenomenal seven-story water slides, a multilevel
play pool that’s fun for the whole family, mind- and body-bending tube
slides and rides, and a wave pool that’s as big as a football field (and better
for bodysurfing, I might add). Adults have their own “spa” area for relax-
ing and hot-tubbing. There’s something for even the littlest ones here, but
you have to be at least 48 inches tall to enjoy everything. Locker rooms,
changing rooms, showers, and a well-endowed food court are on hand. Use
of life jackets, tubes, and floats is free, but there’s a charge for towels,
boogie boards, and lockers.

Hawaii’s Plantation Village
This impeccably restored 50-acre outdoor museum offers a genuine look
back to the days when sugar planters from America — and field workers
from Japan, China, Portugal, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Korea —
shaped the land, economy, and culture of territorial Hawaii. You can
explore the village only on an hour-long guided tour, which takes you

offer, including such activities as horseback riding, ATV rides, rifle shoot-
ing, a movie-set and ranch tour, a jungle tour aboard a 6-wheeled Swiss
Pinzauer, catamaran sailing, and more, including hiking and garden tours.
You can mix and match activities to design your ideal day at the ranch.
Reservations are required, and you’ll need to talk to an agent in advance
to sort out the package that’s right for you. Individual activities can also
be booked if you don’t want to spend the whole day here. (Travelers with

Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
196
Haleiwa
Little more than a collection of clapboard storefronts with a picturesque harbor, the
North Shore town of Haleiwa (ha-lay-ee-va) is the unofficial capital of Hawaii’s surf
culture and a major roadside attraction filled with art galleries, restaurants, surf shops,
and boutiques. This beach town really comes alive in winter, when the timid summer
waves swell to monster proportions and draw big-wave surfers — and the people
who love to watch them risk their necks — from around the world.
Haleiwa is definitely worth a stop to soak in some surf-style atmosphere. Shoppers will
find an hour or two worth of good browsing to be had, and your kids will love the wild
and wacky surf shops. For directions on getting here, see Chapter 10. Here are a few
of the best places to visit:

Polynesian Cultural Center
This remarkable cultural theme park allows you to tour the vast Pacific in
just a single day. Seven Pacific island villages (representing Fiji, New
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 197
 Dole Pineapple Plantation: If you’re heading up to the North Shore via the Central
Oahu route, you may want to make a pit stop here, 64–1550 Kamehameha Hwy.
(Highway 99), Wahiawa (% 808-621-8408; www.doleplantation.com). The
two draws of this ticky-tacky tourist attraction have long been (a) the world’s
largest maze (pineapple shaped, no less), which you can take a shot at navigat-
ing for $6 adults, $4 kids; and (b) three words: pineapple ice cream. The shop is
open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (maze until 5 p.m.). Other features include a 20-
minute train ride through the grounds ($8 adults, $6 for kids) and a Plantation
Garden tour ($4 adults, $3.25 kids).
 North Shore Surf and Cultural Museum: Tucked into the North Shore Marketplace
at 66–250 Kamehameha Hwy. (across from Twelve Tribes) in Haleiwa (% 808-
637-8888), Oahu’s only surf museum is a fun place to spend 20 minutes. The col-
lection of memorabilia includes everything from vintage surfboards to old beach
movie posters to trophies won by surfing’s biggest legends. Admission is free, but
donations are gladly accepted. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from about
11 a.m. to 6 p.m., but call ahead because “once in awhile somebody doesn’t make
it” to open up. Surf’s up, anyone?
 Strong Current Surf Design: This is the place for surf memorabilia and gear. You
can’t miss Strong Current — just look for the vintage Woody station wagon parked
in front of the store. Strong Current has two locations in Haleiwa: in the North Shore
Marketplace, at 66–214 Kamehameha Hwy. (% 808-637-3406; www.strong
currenthawaii.com), and at 66–208 Kamehameha Hwy. (just down the block
past Kua Aina Sandwich; % 808-637-3410).
 Matsumoto’s: To really get into the surf city groove, stop into this simple general
store at 66–087 Kamehameha Hwy. in Haleiwa (% 808-637-6827; www.
matsumotoshaveice.com) for a taste of Hawaii’s favorite sweet treat: shave
ice (never “shaved ice”), the island version of a snow cone. Shave ice comes in
a generous cup (don’t get the cone — you’ll be sorry!) sweetened with your
choice of syrup: strawberry, root beer, banana, passion fruit — it really doesn’t
matter, because they all come out rainbow-colored and tasting vaguely the same.
I highly recommend doing as the locals do and ordering yours with a scoop of ice
cream and sweet red azuki beans nestled in the middle — yum! I never pass up
an opportunity to visit Matsumoto’s, and you shouldn’t, either. Don’t be daunted by
the long line — it moves fast.
If you’re coming up to the North Shore in winter to catch the surfers in action — and
you should, if you’re on the island — you’ll want to head to Waimea Beach Park, the
Banzai Pipeline, and Sunset Beach; see “Combing the Beaches,” at the start of this
chapter, for details.
For recommendations on where to head for food and sunset cocktails while you’re in
the Haleiwa area, see Chapter 10.

Zealand, Marquesas, Samoa, Tahiti, Tonga, and Hawaii) let you experience
firsthand each island or island group’s lifestyle, traditions, songs, dance,
costumes, and architecture as you tour the 42-acre park.
You can “travel” through this living-history museum/theme park either on
foot or in a pole boat navigated along a man-made freshwater lagoon
system. Each village is “inhabited” by native students from Polynesia who
attend Brigham Young University–Hawaii. Operated by the Mormon
Church, the park also features a variety of stage shows celebrating the
music, dance, history, and culture of Polynesia. An IMAX theater offers a
gorgeous movie focusing on the need to preserve the earth’s fragile coral
reefs. An all-you-can-eat luau is served every evening (sorry, no alcohol),
capped by a two-hour Polynesian entertainment extravaganza.
The whole thing may sound hokey, and it is — to a degree. But it’s
extremely well done and teaches a fascinating cultural lesson about the
peoples of Polynesia and their cultural distinctions. Still, it’s a lot to take
in, and many people will find that the regular daytime activities are satis-
factory. My recommendation is that you come for just the day and save
your luauing for a neighbor island, especially if you’re going to Maui, where
the Old Lahaina Luau feast is of better quality, and you won’t be required
to maintain your theme-park stamina from noon ’til night. If you do want
to stay for the entire affair, you’ll have to choose between the different
price packages, whose options include quality of food, quality of seating,
and souvenirs. Because a visit is an all-day affair even if you don’t stay for
the evening show (straight-admission guests are kicked out at 6 p.m.), plan
to arrive before 2 p.m.
Even if you have a rental car, you may want to take an alternate method of
transportation to the Polynesian Cultural Center if you’re planning to
spend the day and evening; the drive back to Waikiki at 10 p.m. can be a
real drag after an exhausting day at the park. You can book bus, minibus,
and limo transportation starting at $15 per person through the PCC by call-
ing % 800-367-7060.

on which package you choose. Open: Mon–Sat 12:30–9:30 p.m. (box office and lunch
buffet open at noon); regular exhibits close at 6 p.m.
Hitting the links
Oahu has a handful of championship courses, but hard-to-get tee times
and inaccessibility from Waikiki make this my least favorite island for
teeing off. Still, if you’re on Oahu and in the mood, these courses are
your best bets.

Ko Olina Golf Club
Located on Oahu’s arid west side, this 6,324-yard, par-72 Ted Robinson–
designed course is a standout with rolling fairways, multitiered greens,
and no fewer than 16 water features. The signature hole is the picturesque
12th, a par-3 with an elevated tee sitting on a rock garden, plus its very
own cascading waterfall. Wait until you get to the 18th hole; you’ll see and
hear water all around you. You’ll have no choice but to play to the left and
approach the green over the water. This course isn’t overly difficult, but
you’d better be on your game as soon as the wind picks up. Facilities
include a driving range, locker rooms, Jacuzzi/steam rooms, and a restau-
rant and bar. Book in advance because the course is always crowded. Men
are asked to wear collared shirts.

Makaha Resort Golf Club
Ask any local duffer, and he’s bound to name this course as one of his
favorites on the island — everybody does. In fact, Honolulu magazine
recently celebrated this course as Oahu’s best. Designed by William Bell,
the challenging par-72, 7,077-yard course is one of Oahu’s longest, most
difficult, most beautiful, and best maintained. But don’t let the rugged
beauty of wrinkled cliffs or the luxuriant valley setting distract your atten-
tion from the challenges: eight water hazards, 107 bunkers, and frequent
and brisk winds that you’ll have to play into on three holes, minimum.
Facilities include a pro shop, a driving range, bag storage, and a particu-
larly fine clubhouse with food service.

Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 199

Turtle Bay Resort Courses
Situated on the gorgeous North Shore, the Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay–
designed Palmer Course is the most spectacular golf course on the island.
With rolling terrain, only a few trees, and lots of wind, the front nine holes
play like a Scottish course, whereas the back nine have narrower tree-lined
fairways and lots of water (including wonderful ocean views from the 17th
hole). Several holes skirt a wetlands preserve, giving the course a tranquil
vibe and beautiful native flora and fauna. This course is a really fun place
to play, and five sets of tees on every hole accommodate golfers of all abil-
ities. No wonder senior PGAers like Chi Chi Rodriguez and Hale Irwin con-
sider this place to be one of their favorite stops on the annual Senior PGA
tour. Turtle Bay is also home to the Fazio Course, renowned course archi-
tect George Fazio’s only course in the islands. This nine-holer can be played
twice for a regulation par-71, 6,200-yard course. It’s known for its generous
fairways, deep bunkers, and immaculately shaped greens. Two sets of 
tees — one designed for men, one for women — let you enjoy a slightly dif-
ferent game the second time around. Facilities include a pro shop, driving
range, putting and chipping green, and snack bar.
See map p. 162. 57–049 Kuilima Dr., Kahuku. % 808-293-8811. www.turtlebay

ceed through town and follow Highway 83 to the Turtle Bay Country Club. Greens
fees: $195 at the Palmer Course ($155 for resort guests); $160 at the Fazio Course
($125 for resort guests). Awinata fees (noon to 2 p.m.): $150 at the Palmer Course
($125 for resort guests), $135 at the Fazio course ($105 for resort guests). Ahiahi fees

course ($80 for resort guests). Junior rates available.
Shopping the Local Stores
Most of the city’s shopping is conveniently concentrated in a few big malls
and shopping centers. Additionally, browsers shouldn’t neglect Waikiki’s
main drag, Kalakaua Avenue, as well as Kuhio Avenue 1 block to the
north. Both avenues and the side streets that connect them are lined with
an eclectic mix that ranges from haute couture boutiques to tacky sou-
venir stalls. Kalakaua is becoming the Rodeo Drive of Hawaii, lined as it is
with shops like Prada, Burberry, Versace, Bulgari, Celine, and others.
These runway names cater largely to the Japanese crowd, who apparently
find this stuff affordable compared with what they pay in Tokyo. Many of
the stores along Kalakaua are open until late into the evening.
Shopping malls
Honolulu is the crux of commerce in the Pacific — people fly in from as
far away as Tahiti to do their Christmas shopping at the finest collection
of malls in the Pacific.
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu

Ala Moana Center
This monster-size mall is the largest open-air shopping center in the United
States. With a selection of stores that ranges from Sears and Foot Locker
to Fendi and Gucci, there really is something for everybody here. Among
the standouts are the department stores: Macy’s (which features a won-
derful Hawaiian crafts department), Shirokiya (a Japanese department
store with a divine food department), Neiman-Marcus (bastion of high-
society elegance), and new in 2008, Nordstrom. The mall is home to every-
thing from LensCrafters to the U.S. Post Office to a massive food court.
You can shop for aloha wear at Reyn’s and Tori Richard (two of my
favorites for island prints), find affordable gifts for the folks back home at
Hilo Hattie, and meet just about any other need.
A whole fleet of new and exciting stores and restaurants will be installed
at Ala Moana by the time you read this. Look for Blue Hawaii Surf for edgy
surf and skate wear; Lush, the handmade British cosmetics brand; Harry
Winston for glam wedding and engagement jewelry; Ruehl No. 925, the
hot clothing and accessories brand from Abercrombie & Fitch; Islands, for
terrific two-fisted burgers from the Southern California–based chain; and
Pacific Place Tea Garden Café, for traditional and Hawaii-style afternoon
tea service and accouterments, among others. Be sure to check out the
new Tsukiji Fish Market and Restaurant, modeled after Tokyo’s world-
famous fish market; it features a sushi bar, a yakitori bar, a Japanese buffet,
and an incredible assortment of fresh fish from local waters and exotic
locales. Ala Moana is a must for mall lovers.

Aloha Tower Marketplace
This waterfront restaurant and dining complex is better for dining (Chai’s
Island Bistro is here; see Chapter 10) and views than it is for actual 
shopping — most of the stores are ticky-tacky. The choices (lots of gift
boutiques and T-shirt shops) are more tourist-oriented than those at
neighbors Ala Moana Center, Ward Centre, and Ward Warehouse. It’s a
great place to stroll, but don’t expect the find of a lifetime. The few stand-
outs include Ang Namsilk for original women’s tropical wear and hand-
bags in exotic silks, and Honolua Surf Co. for surf apparel. TheBus and
the Waikiki Trolley stop here (consider taking public transportation; park-
ing here is tough).

grances to fashion and luggage. The main Waikiki Trolley customer serv-
ice desk is located at the mall. Beware: Certain duty-free shopping areas
are off-limits to mainland shoppers. There’s free live entertainment every
evening at 7 p.m., often featuring hula.

Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center
Located in central Waikiki, this mall recently underwent a massive $84-mil-
lion upgrade, making it the extravagant heart of Honolulu’s European
designer shopping. It’s where you’ll find Fendi, Bulgari, Hermès, Furla,
Cartier, and other big-ticket boutiques. In addition, you’ll find fresh-faced
couture brands and chic mass-marketers such as Kate Spade, Juicy
Couture, Tourneau, and White House Black Market. A new Hilo Hattie’s
megastore, slated to be the chain’s flagship location, will be open by the
time you arrive. You’ll find a Waikiki Trolley ticket and information kiosk
here as well (see Chapter 10).

Waikele Premium Outlets
This top-flight outlet mall in west Oahu offers one of the island’s best rainy-
day activities. Options run from the ultrachic (Barneys New York, Brooks
Brothers, Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole, Coach, Max Mara) to the comfort-
casual (Banana Republic, Jockey, Skechers). The outlets are well worth the
20-minute drive if you’re a discount-shopping fan.
If you’re a shopper without a car, contact E Noa Tours (% 808-591-2561;
www.enoa.com) and All Occasion Transportation (% 800-454-1380), both
of which offer excursions to the outlets.

turn off at exit 7.
Ward Centers
What used to be two simple two-story sister shopping centers has
bloomed into a six-center mini-empire of quality midpriced shopping occu-
pying 4 city blocks and hosting 120 shops and 23 restaurants. Of the two
original malls, Ward Centre is largely dedicated to dining, but has a few
standouts, most notably Borders, which boasts an excellent Hawaiian
music department; The Gallery at Ward Centre, which carries a notable
collection of works by Hawaii artists; and the Honolulu Chocolate
Company, makers of fine island-made chocolates from island-grown cocoa
beans. Ward Warehouse’s good choices include the Nohea Gallery, a con-
stant favorite for its terrific collection of high-quality Hawaii-made crafts;
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
202

Island Guitars, for new, used, and vintage instruments; and Mamo Howell,
for both traditional and contemporary muumuu in Mamo’s wonderful sig-
nature fabrics. At the Ward Gateway Center, Mauka to Makai hosts a ter-
rific collection of outdoor gear, Hawaii-style. There’s much, much more,
even a tropical farmers’ market, a state-of-the-art 16-screen movie multi-
plex, and a wealth of good restaurants, including Brew Moon Restaurant
& Microbrewery, Kakaako Kitchen, and Kua Aina Sandwich (all reviewed
in Chapter 10).
Attention, diners: Stop by the concierge desk on the mezzanine level in
front of the movie theater, where the concierge can show you menus, make
dinner reservations for you, and even present you with coupons.

Other shopping of note
Hilo Hattie has been Hawaii’s first name in aloha wear for decades, and
I’m happy to report that both the quality and the selection are better
than ever. There’s a ginormous location out toward the airport at 700 N.
Nimitz Hwy., at Pacific Street (% 888-526-0299 or 808-535-6500; www.
hilohattie.com). You’ll find a big children’s department, as well as
macadamia nuts, Hawaii-grown coffees, contemporary Hawaiian music,
and lots of other souvenirs to choose from. The chain’s flagship mega-
store in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center should be open and active 
by the time you read this. A more manageable location is at Ala Moana
Center, where the selection tends toward the high end (% 808-973-3266).
For the best selection of vintage aloha shirts, visit Bailey’s Antiques and
Aloha Shirts, 517 Kapahulu Ave. (across from the Ala Wai Golf Course),
north of Kapiolani Park in the Kapahulu section of Honolulu (% 808-
734-7628; www.alohashirts.com). A ’50s-era cotton or silkie in A-1 
condition can cost upwards of $600 or more, but some cheapies are on
hand, too; prices begin around $20. You’ll also find hula-girl lamps, vin-
tage costume jewelry, and other bits of kitsch, all priced at top dollar —
but a joy to discover, anyway.
For one of the best collections of contemporary aloha wear, visit
Moonbow Tropics, located at the Westin Moana Surfrider, 2365 Kalakaua
Ave. (% 808-924-1496; www.moonbowtropics.com). You’ll find gorgeous
men’s and women’s wear from such brands as Tori Richard, Tommy
Bahama, Kahala, and Nat Nast, tailor to the King (Elvis that is). Tori
Richard also has its own wonderful brand store in Waikiki at 2424
Kalakaua Ave. (% 808-924-1811; www.toririchard.com); there’s a
second store in Ala Moana Center.
Wonderful prints and styles are made by Reyn’s (www.reyns.com),
which has a number of boutiques throughout Hawaii, including one at
the Ala Moana Center (% 808-949-5929), plus a charming shop on the
lobby level of the Sheraton Waikiki hotel (% 808-923-0331).
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 203

Some of the finest stops for Hawaiian-made gifts are museum shops: The
Academy Shop at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, 900 S. Beretania St.,
between Victoria and Ward avenues in downtown Honolulu (% 808-
532-8703), and both Native Books and Beautiful Things and Shop
Pacifica at the Bishop Museum, 1525 Bernice St. at Kalihi Street, also
downtown (% 808-847-3511). The Academy Shop, Native Books, and
Shop Pacifica are great choices for traditional Hawaiiana, crafts, and
books. Native Books and Beautiful Things also has a larger gallery-style
location at Ward Warehouse, 1050 Ala Moana Blvd. (% 808-596-8885).
Another first-class showcase for island crafts and gifts in the Ward
Warehouse is the Nohea Gallery (% 808-596-0074).
A wonderful new addition to the Oahu shopping scene is Muumuu
Heaven, on the windward side of the island in the Davis Building, 767

Innovative expressions of aloha
Art hounds will enjoy strolling the burgeoning gallery scene of downtown Honolulu,
where galleries, studios, and other art venues are flourishing in the tight square near
Chinatown occupied by Nuuanu Avenue, Pauahi Street, Hotel Street, and Smith Street.
Highlights include The ARTS at Marks Garage, 1159 Nuuanu Ave. (% 808-521-2903;
www.artsatmarks.com), a collaborative gallery and performance space (call
ahead to see what’s going on while you’re in town); Bethel Street Gallery, 1140 Bethel
St. (% 808-524-3552; www.bethelstreetgallery.com), showcasing the excel-
lent contemporary works of its collective of owner-artists; the Pegge Hopper Gallery,
1164 Nuuanu Ave. (% 808-524-1160; www.peggehopper.com), whose distinctive
paintings of island women are justifiably world famous; thirtyninehotel, 39 Hotel St.
(% 808-599-2552; www.thirtyninehotel.com), the domain of painter Gelareh
Khoie and DJ Harvey Bassett, who have come together to create a cutting-edge per-
formance and gallery space; and the Louis Pohl Gallery, 1111 Nuuanu Ave. (% 808-
521-1812; www.louispohlgallery.com), for dynamic island-themed art.
A great time to stroll and celebrate the exciting scene is during First Friday, a monthly
event during which all of the galleries welcome browsers with refreshments and live
entertainment. First Friday takes place on the first Friday of every month from 5 to 9 p.m.
For more information — and a comprehensive list of galleries and other art venues in the
neighborhood — visit www.firstfridayhawaii.com or call % 808-739-9797.
Attention, late-night revelers: You’ll also find a growing list of coolly creative bars and
entertainment spaces with a twist in this neighborhood, such as Mercury Bar, 1154
Fort Street Mall (% 808-537-3080); Bar 35, 35 N. Hotel St. (% 808-537-3535; www.bar
35hawaii.com), catering to the style-savvy beer connoisseur; NextDoor, 43 Hotel St.
(% 808-548-6398; www.myspace.com/nextdoorhi), Chinatown’s art-house con-
cert and movie hall; and Indigo, 1121 Nuuanu Ave. (% 808-521-2900; www.indigo-
hawaii.com), the terrific Eurasian restaurant (see review in Chapter 10) that also
boasts the seductive Green Room lounge, where you’ll find terrific live music or DJs
spinning a creative music mix Tuesdays through Saturdays.

Kailua Rd. (% 808-263-3366; www.muumuuheaven.com). This family-run
business uses vintage muumuu fabrics and remakes them as casually
gorgeous, one-of-a-kind skirts, tops, dresses, and bags for women. To get
there, take the Pali Highway into Kailua; as you enter into town, turn
right into the first driveway after Hamakua Road.
Nothing says “aloha” like a lei. For the best selection and prices, head to
Chinatown, in downtown Honolulu, where the aroma of flowers being
woven into beautiful treasures fills the air. The stretch of Maunakea
Street between Beretania and King streets and the adjacent block of
Beretania Street are lined with lei shops on both sides of the street. The
designs of the leis made here are almost always exceptional. Wander
through all the shops before you decide which lei you want and feel free
to ask questions about any unfamiliar tropical flowers and styles. Worth
seeking out, for both selection and friendliness, are Cindy’s Lei and
Flower Shoppe, 1034 Maunakea St. (% 808-536-6538); Lin’s Lei Shop,
1017A Maunakea St. (% 808-537-4112); and Lita’s Leis, 59 N. Beretania
St. (% 808-521-9065).
Living It Up after Dark
Your best bet for finding out what’s going on around town is to pick up 
a copy of Honolulu Weekly (www.honoluluweekly.com), available free 
at restaurants, clubs, shops, and newspaper racks around Oahu; the
“Happenings” section can tell you what’s on tap for the week. Also 
check the daily papers, particularly Honolulu Advertiser (www.honolulu
advertiser.com); Friday’s “TGIF” section is a prime source for what’s
going on around town, and you can often find it as its own freebie publi-
cation around town, called “TGIWaikiki.” But most important, don’t
forget to make use of your hotel concierge.
If the Brothers Cazimero are putting on a show while you’re in town,
don’t miss it. This legendary musical duo is one of Hawaii’s most
beloved and gifted acts. Check the papers or ask your concierge if
they’re playing anywhere in town. At press time, they were appearing
most Wednesdays at Chai’s Island Bistro (% 808-585-0011; www.
chaisislandbistro.com) in the Aloha Tower Marketplace. You can
also check the brothers’ calendar at www.mountainapplecompany.com/
Cazimeros.aspx. Also try to catch the beautiful, contemporary island
music by the inspired duo Hapa.
A number of gallery/performance spaces and new nightlife spots, such
as Bar 35 and thirtyninehotel, have begun to flourish as part of down-
town Honolulu’s burgeoning creative arts and nightlife scene. What’s
more, the whole downtown gallery scene becomes its own street party
on the first Friday of every month. For details, see the box “Innovative
expressions of aloha,” earlier in this chapter. If you’re in the party mood
and ready to luau, see the listing for the Polynesian Cultural Center, ear-
lier in this chapter, or check out Chapter 10.
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 205

Of course, one way to enjoy the evening is to participate in an old school
luau. The island has a variety of choices; my favorite family-friendly one
is the Sea Life Luau at Sea Life Park. For details on this and other lively
luau nights, see “Luau!” in Chapter 10.
The really big shows
The shows listed in this section are Waikiki staples. Still, schedules,
prices, and other parameters do change; so always call ahead.
Magic of Polynesia
This extravaganza is downright Vegas-worthy. Master illusionist John
Horikawa performs mind-boggling feats of magic on an elaborate stage set,
aided by a large cast and state-of-the-art lighting and sound. This produc-
tion is first-class, and the audience usually eats it up (although I’ve also
run into show-goers who’ve walked away less than dazzled). Reserve seats
a day or two in advance. I recommend skipping dinner (especially the over-
priced deluxe dinner options). Note that Michael Villoria performs on
Sundays and Mondays to give John Horikawa some time off.
At the Waikiki Beachcomber hotel, 2300 Kalakaua Ave. (at Duke’s Lane), Waikiki. 
% 888-349-7888, 808-971-4321, or 808-356-1800. www.magicofpolynesia.com.
Showtimes: Nightly at 8:20 p.m. (dinner seating begins at 7 p.m.; show seating begins
at 8 p.m. if you do not opt for dinner). Tickets: $48 adults, $32 children for show only;
$76–$130 adults, $52–$66 children for dinner show. Online discounts available.
Society of Seven
Waikiki’s longest-running nightclub act still puts on one of the best shows
in Waikiki. Expect a lively blend of skits, impersonations, show tunes, ’50s
and ’60s pop hits, and more.
Stop by any Outrigger or Ohana hotel in Waikiki and ask the activities
agent to arrange your Society of Seven tickets; if there’s a special running,
you may save some money. Online discounts are also available. (As with
the other shows, I’d skip the overpriced dinner buffet options.)
In the Outrigger Main Showroom, Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach, 2335 Kalakaua Ave.
(between the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and the Moana Surfrider), Waikiki. 
% 888-349-7888, 808-356-1800, or 808-923-7469. www.outriggeractivities.
com. Showtimes: Tues–Sun at 8:30 p.m. (additional shows at 6:30 p.m. on Tues and
Fri). Tickets: $37 adults, $24 children for show only; $53 adults, $43 children for dinner
show.
Cocktails, music, and dancing
Hands down, my favorite spot for sunset cocktails is the House Without
a Key at the Halekulani hotel, 2199 Kalia Rd. (at the beach end of Lewers
Street), Waikiki (% 808-923-2311; www.halekulani.com). On an ocean-
front patio shaded by a big kiawe tree, you can sip the best mai tais on
the island, listen to masterful steel guitar music, and watch a traditional
hula dancer — often former Miss Hawaii Kanoe Miller — sway with the
Part III: Honolulu and the Rest of Oahu 
206

palms. It’s romantic, nostalgic, and simply breathtaking. (Also consider
the House Without a Key for a casually sophisticated alfresco dinner; see
Chapter 10.) Afterward, move indoors to the Lewers Lounge, where light
jazz continues the romantic tone.
Another top spot for Hawaiian music and orchid-adorned cocktails is the
oh-so-romantic Banyan Veranda at the Moana Surfrider, 2365 Kalakaua
Ave. (on the beach, across from Kaiulani Street), in the heart of Waikiki
(% 808-922-3111; www.moana-surfrider.com). I just love this Victorian-
style beachfront hotel, situated around a 100-year-old banyan tree — the
perfect setting for some soft island sounds.
Nothing separates you from the sand at the Royal Hawaiian’s Mai Tai
Bar, 2259 Kalakaua Ave., at the end of Royal Hawaiian Avenue (% 808-
923-7311), giving this one of the most lovely views of Waikiki Beach. The
Mai Tai Bar maintains an all-Hawaiian music program nightly from 4:30
to 10:30 p.m.
Lively Duke’s Canoe Club, at the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach, 2335
Kalakaua Ave. (between the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and the
Moana Surfrider), Waikiki (% 808-922-2268; www.dukeswaikiki.com) is
the quintessential beachfront bar and restaurant, with Tiki torches in the
sand, a tropical party vibe, and a mammoth drink menu. The Hawaiian
entertainment is always top-notch, and usually starts around 4 p.m.
The Sheraton Waikiki, 2255 Kalakaua Ave. (at Royal Hawaiian Avenue,
west of the Royal Hawaiian), Waikiki (% 808-922-4422), is home to
RumFire (% 866-952-3473; www.rumfirewaikiki.com), a sharp, sexy,
cavernous nightspot offering the largest vintage rum selection in the
United States. You’ll find an oceanfront setting, a generous tapas menu,
and a lively scene. Open until midnight Sunday through Thursday, until 
2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
If you’re at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, head to the Sunset Lanai
at the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel, 2863 Kalakaua Ave., across the
street from Kapiolani Park (% 808-923-1555). Shaded by a giant light-
festooned hau tree, it’s no wonder that this magical spot is a favorite
Waikiki watering hole. Live Hawaiian music heightens the ambience at
sunset hour Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday.
Hawaii’s finest musicians operate at two top Aloha Tower Marketplace
venues: Chai’s Island Bistro, Aloha Tower Marketplace, 1 Aloha Tower
Dr., just south of downtown Honolulu (% 808-585-0011; www.chais
islandbistro.com), where it’s more than worth paying for the pricey
dinners to see some of the finest names in Hawaiian entertainment
(including Robert Cazimero, half of the justifiably legendary Brothers
Cazimero duo). The calendar here is always jampacked with top-quality
talent, so don’t miss it. Another terrific stop in the Marketplace for con-
temporary talent is Don Ho’s Island Grill (% 808-528-0807; www.donho.
com/grill), which also transforms into a hip-shakin’ dance club as the
weekend evenings wear on.
Chapter 11: Exploring Oahu 207

The locals’ best-loved venue for live music is Anna Bannanas, 2440 S.
Beretania St. (% 808-946-5190; www.annabannanashonolulu.com).
Music can run the gamut from reggae to blues to rock at the easygoing
bar and club, so call or check the Web site to see what’s on.
Rumours Nightclub, at the Ala Moana Hotel, 410 Atkinson Dr. (% 808-
955-4811), is a great place to hit the dance floor on Tuesday, Friday, and
Saturday nights, especially if you’re into Top 40 and the pop sounds of
the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s. Locals like to hit the dance floor every night of
the week at Venus, an upscale dance club near the Ala Moana Shopping
Center at 1349 Kapiolani Blvd. (% 808-951-8671). Expect house, hip
hop, and radio-friendly dance music mixed by some of the island’s best
DJs, plus occasional special events.
Nostalgists may want to take an excursion to Honolulu’s last genuine
Tiki bar, La Mariana Sailing Club, 50 Sand Island Access Rd. (% 808-
848-2800). Going strong since 1955, La Mariana is hidden in a decidedly
unsexy industrial area near the airport, but it’s worth the hunt if you
want a genuine slice of a long-gone Hawaii. This is the real deal, not for
those looking for pristine conditions or a fussy cocktail menu. Last time 
I was here, a man played pop classics on a slightly out-of-tune piano
while a dog sat on a table, and Honolulu’s most colorful characters gath-
ered to enjoy the island’s best mai tais and fried pupus. The harbor view
is appealing, but come after dark to experience maximum retro magic.
To get there from Waikiki, take Ala Moana Boulevard until it turns into
Nimitz Highway; turn left on Sand Island Access Road, follow it to the
bend in the road and turn right at the sign; park on the street where
signs allow.
Sailing into the sunset
Nothing closes a perfect day in paradise like a sunset cruise, and there’s
no better place for it than Oahu, where the Waikiki skyline and Diamond
Head come together in an unforgettable backdrop. Star of Honolulu
(% 800-334-6191 or 808-983-7827; www.starofhonolulu.com) offers
sunset dinner cruises for a range of budgets. Navatek I and the MaiTai
Catamaran also offer sunset and dinner options to choose from; see the
section “All hands on deck: Ocean-cruising adventures,” earlier in this
chapter, for complete details.

Maui

In this part . . .
M
ajestic Maui is such a wildly popular destination that
it’s doubly important to do some smart trip planning
before you leave home. The chapters in this part help you
map out everything you need for an unforgettable Valley Isle
vacation — whether you’re after heart-pounding adventure or
simply a week (or more, if you’re especially lucky) of lounging
blissfully on the soft white sands.

S
ee the inside back cover for a color map to get you acquainted with
Maui; it’s slightly more difficult to navigate than the other islands,
but not overly complicated. With a good map in hand, you’re golden.
You’ll most likely arrive at the island’s centrally located main gateway,
Kahului (ka-hoo-loo-ee) Airport, in Central Maui.
Arriving at Kahului Airport
Kahului Airport (% 808-872-3893; www.state.hi.us/dot/airports/
maui/ogg) is conveniently located 3 miles from the town of Kahului,
Maui’s main community, at the end of Keolani Place (just west of the
intersection of Dairy Road and the Haleakala Highway).
Hawaiian Airlines provides both interisland and direct mainland serv-
ices to Kahului. American, Air Canada, Continental, Delta, United, and
US Airways all serve Kahului directly from the mainland as well. And, in
addition to Hawaiian, recent entry go! Airlines also connects Maui with
Hawaii’s other islands. Nearly all the island’s highways are accessible
just outside the airport.
Open-air Kahului Airport is easy to negotiate. The airport is relatively
small, and the route from your gate to Baggage Claim is clearly marked.
Although almost everyone arrives at Kahului Airport, Maui does have
two single-strip airports served by commercial propeller carriers — one
in Kapalua (West Maui) and another one in Hana. If you’re interested in
avoiding Kahului altogether, contact Island Air (% 800-652-6541 or
808-484-2222 from elsewhere; www.islandair.com) or Pacific Wings
(% 888-575-4546 or 808-873-0877; www.pacificwings.com).

Getting from the Airport to Your Hotel
All the big car-rental names have cars available at Kahului, and I suggest
that you arrange for one in advance. (For more on this subject, see
Chapter 6.) If you’d rather not drive yourself, I give you some alternative
transportation options in this section.
Driving yourself
Step outside to the curbside rental-car pickup area at the ocean end of
the terminal (to your right as you exit the building). Either go over to the
counter, if your rental company is represented, or wait for the appropri-
ate shuttle van — they circle the airport at regular intervals — to take
you a half-mile away to your rental-car checkout desk.
All the rental-car agencies offer map booklets that are invaluable for get-
ting around the island.
Getting from the airport to your hotel can be a bit of a trial because
Kahului is Maui’s main business district, and all of Maui’s main highways
intersect just outside the airport.
If you’re heading to West Maui, take the Kuihelani (koo-ee-hay-la-nee)
Highway (Highway 380) to the Honoapiilani (ho-no-ah-pee-ee-la-nee)
Highway (Highway 30). The Honoapiilani Highway curves around the
knob that is West Maui, leading to Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kahana, Napili,
and finally Kapalua. To pick up the Kuihelani Highway, exit the airport at
Keolani Place and turn left onto Dairy Road, which turns into the high-
way you want. Expect it to take 30 minutes to reach Lahaina, 40 minutes
to reach Kaanapali, and 50 to 60 minutes to reach Kapalua, maybe a little
longer if the traffic’s heavy.
If you’re heading to South Maui, exit the airport at Keolani Place, turn left
onto Dairy Road, and then left onto Puunene (poo-oo-nay-nay) Avenue
(Highway 350), which takes you immediately to the Mokulele (mow-koo-
lay-lay) Highway (Highway 311), which leads directly south. Just north of
Kihei, the Mokulele ends; you can choose to continue on the highway —
now called Piilani (pee-ee-la-nee) Highway (Highway 31) — which takes
you through Kihei and to Wailea along the speediest route, with frequent
exits along the way. If you’re staying at the north end of Kihei, though,
exit the Mokulele Highway onto South Kihei Road, Kihei’s main drag.
Taking a taxi
As long as you arrive before 10 p.m., you can just go out to the well-
marked curbside area and hop into the next available cab.
If you want to arrange for pickup ahead of time, call Maui Airport Taxi
(% 808-281-9533; www.nokaoitaxi.com), Kihei Taxi (% 808-879-3000),
Wailea Taxi (% 808-874-5000), or Maui Taxi Service (% 808-276-9515;
www.mauipleasanttaxi.com). The mandated fare on Maui is $3 per
Part IV: Maui 
212

mile, accommodating one to six people. Expect to pay $65 to $105
depending on your West Maui destination and about $42 to $55 to the
Kihei/Wailea area; plus the customary 10 to 15 percent tip. For limousine
service, contact Star Limousine (% 877-875-6900 or 808-669-6900;
www.limohawaii.com) or Maui Executive Transportation (% 800-
833-2303; www.mauishuttle.com).
Catching a shuttle ride
If you’re not renting a car, the cheapest way to get to your hotel is via
airport shuttle. SpeediShuttle (% 877-242-5777 or 808-242-7777;
www.speedishuttle.com) can take you between Kahului Airport and
any of the Maui resort areas between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily. Rates vary
depending on your destination, but figure on $38 to Wailea (one-way)
and $54 one-way to Kaanapali. (Rates also change based on the number
of people traveling together.) You can either set up your airport pickup
in advance (which allows you to snag a 10 percent online booking dis-
count on your return trip) or use the courtesy phone in Baggage Claim
to summon a van (dial 65). Call at least 24 hours before your departure
flight to arrange pickup.
Choosing Your Location
The commercial hub of Maui is Kahului (ka-hoo-loo-ee). Just east of
Kahului is Wailuku, Maui’s appealingly funky county seat (and a bur-
geoning antiques center). These two Central Maui communities are
Maui’s largest, but despite their central-to-everything convenience, they
aren’t really vacation destinations.
Instead, most visitors stay on one of Maui’s two major resort coasts:
West Maui and South Maui. Both comprise smaller beach resorts and
communities, each with its own distinct personality.
West Maui
The West Maui coastline is a little greener in winter — and a little wetter —
than the South Maui coast. Some of the best beaches on the island fringe
West Maui; eastward, the beautifully jagged mountain peaks of the West
Maui mountains rise in the distance.
Of the communities along this resort coast, only Lahaina is a real town.
The others are really just a collection of condos or hotels anchored by a
few fancy resorts or a high-end mini-mall. The communities described in
the rest of this section start at the southern end of West Maui and move
northward along the Honoapiilani (ho-no-ah-pee-ee-la-nee) Highway
(Highway 30).
The port town of Lahaina (la-ha-nah) still has a historic heart, but has
superseded Waikiki as the tacky tourist center of Hawaii. The blocks are
lined with bustling waterfront restaurants, touristy galleries and shops,
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 213

and activity centers that sometimes catcall onto the street. The predomi-
nant vibe is that of one big, surf-oriented street party. Lahaina has three
more things going for it: some of Maui’s best accommodations values,
some very good restaurants, and an extremely convenient location.
Lahaina has a couple of beaches that will do in a pinch, but it’s a bit of a
drive to the best ones.
Three miles north of Lahaina is Kaanapali (kah-na-pa-lee), Hawaii’s first
master-planned family resort, and a real favorite of mine. Kaanapali’s
chain of resort hotels and condos fronts a gorgeous golden beach and
exudes a nice sense of continuity. All are linked by a landscaped park-
way and a walking path along the sand, with a very nice shopping and
dining complex sitting at its midpoint. Kaanapali is pricey, but not quite
as expensive as Kapalua or Wailea; in fact, it’s home to my favorite mid-
priced resort, the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, and some of Maui’s best
midrange condos.
Two condo communities, Kahana and Napili, sit off the highway a few
minutes north of Kaanapali, offering great deals for those who want an
affordable place to stay and an oceanfront setting. Restaurants and
supermarkets are right at hand. The only downside is a lack of personal-
ity — expect homogeneous, rather generic condo complexes.
North of Kahana is Hawaii’s most beautiful master-planned community,
Kapalua, the exclusive domain of a gracious Ritz-Carlton as well as some
luxurious condos, fabulous gold-sand beaches, and world-class golf.
Kapalua is a marvelous place to settle in and unwind, if you have the
bucks to do it. But keep in mind that, situated as it is at the north end of
the Honoapiilani Highway, Kapalua isn’t the most convenient base.
Kapalua also tends to get more rain than other Maui resorts. Still, the
glorious setting can be well worth the trade-off.
South Maui
South Maui is the island’s hottest, driest, and sunniest coast. Actually
western-facing, but well-protected from the elements by peninsula-like
West Maui, South Maui receives only about 15 inches of annual rainfall,
and temperatures stay around 80°F year-round.
If you drive south along Piilani Highway (Highway 31) or Kihei Road
(Highway 310), you first reach Kihei and then Wailea. Which one you
choose depends entirely on your budget.
Centrally located Kihei (key-hay) is Maui’s bargain coast. Its main drag is
South Kihei Road, which is bordered by a continuous string of condos
and mini-malls on one side and a series of sandy beaches on the other.
Kihei isn’t charming or quaint, but what it lacks in physical charm it
more than makes up for in sunshine, affordability, and convenience.
Just a few minutes south of Kihei, Wailea (why-lay-ah) is upscale all the
way. This ritzy, well-manicured neighborhood is home to Maui’s best
Part IV: Maui 
214

luxury resort spreads, a host of championship golf courses, five out-
standing beaches, the elegant Shops at Wailea, and the Wailea Tennis
Center. The strip is well-developed and tightly packed, but my favorite
Wailea resorts remain worlds unto themselves. Even though Kapalua is
more beautiful, Wailea is no slouch — and I prefer its more accessible
location and wider range of hotel choices. You’ll even find some
midrange and upscale condos in this appealing neighborhood.
East Maui and Hana
The gateway to east Maui is the funky-charming Paia (pa-ee-ah), a hip
little surf town about ten minutes east of Kahului that has three main
draws: some hip and artsy boutiquing, some of the island’s best-value
restaurants, and the best windsurfing beach in the world, Hookipa Beach
Park, which I discuss in Chapter 13.
Some visitors like to stay way out in Hana for the ultimate escape. In
Hana, you can relax in a lush, green, rural setting with access to wonder-
ful beaches. Hana tends to receive more rain than the dry South Maui
coast, but the luxurious green vegetation compensates. Hana is a sleepy
area, where the accommodations tend to be intimate, but not laden with
facilities.
You can see this beautiful area on a day’s drive from the major resort
coasts (see Chapter 13), but if you have the time and the budget for it, I
recommend doing the drive at a leisurely pace and staying overnight at
the gloriously renovated Hotel Hana-Maui (reviewed later in this chap-
ter). More affordable, bed-and-breakfast–style options are also available.
It’s a wonderful departure from the bustle of South and West Maui — a
step back into Hawaii’s simpler days.
Getting Around Maui
To really see the Valley Isle, you have to drive it yourself. Maui has only
a handful of major roads; but they all meet in a complicated web in the
center of the island, and untangling them can take some effort. Be sure
to study a good island map and know exactly where you’re going before
you set out.
Maui traffic can be challenging at times. Try to allow yourself extra time
to get where you’re going during rush hours, especially in the Central
and South Maui areas.
Navigating your rental car around the Valley Isle
If you get in trouble on Maui’s highways and you don’t have your cell-
phone with you, look for the flashing blue strobe lights on 12-foot poles;
at the base are emergency call boxes (programmed to dial 911 as soon
as you pick up the handset).
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 215

Starting out in Central Maui
Kahului, in Central Maui, is where you’ll land at the island’s major air-
port. Kahului isn’t a vacation destination, but a real town with Wal-
Marts, car lots, malls, and so on. Still, you will occasionally find yourself
in Kahului as you head to other areas of the island because this area is
where Maui’s highways intersect.
Kahului’s main drag is Kaahumanu (ka-ah-hoo-ma-noo) Avenue
(Highway 32). If you’re heading to the town of Wailuku, either for some
antiquing or a visit to scenic Iao Valley, just follow Kaahumanu Avenue
west for about ten minutes and — voilà — you’re there.
Reaching the West and South Maui resorts
If you’re heading to any of Maui’s beach resort areas, in either West Maui
or South Maui, you first have to head south through the Central Maui
corridor (often referred to as Maui’s “neck”).
To reach West Maui, you take the Kuihelani Highway (Highway 380)
south from Kahului to the Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30). The
Honoapiilani Highway actually starts in Wailuku (it meets up with the
end of Kaahumanu Avenue to make a neat inverted “L” there) and runs
directly south to Maalaea (mah-lay-ah), a windy harborfront village at
the south end of Central Maui — where you may be picking up a snorkel
cruise to Molokini or visiting the state-of-the-art Maui Ocean Center
aquarium. Past Maalaea, the southbound Honoapiilani Highway begins
to follow the curve of the land, turning abruptly west and north along
the coast toward Lahaina.
All West Maui’s resort communities lie directly off the Honoapiilani
Highway on the ocean side of the road. As you go from south to north,
you’ll first reach the old whaling town of Lahaina; then Kaanapali,
Hawaii’s first master-planned beach resort; then two quiet beachfront
condo communities, Kahana and Napili; and, at the end of the road, the
Kapalua resort, a stunning manicured beauty. It’s about a half-hour of
easy highway driving from Lahaina to Kapalua.
Be alert as you drive the Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30); drivers
who spot whales in the channel between Maui and Lanai sometimes
slam on the brakes in awe, precipitating tie-ups and accidents.
From Kahului, South Maui is basically a straight shot. The Mokulele
Highway (Highway 311) heads straight south across the Central Maui
corridor from Kahului to the north end of Kihei, west of the Kuihelani
Highway, Highway 380.
At the end of the Mokulele Highway, you have two choices: You can
either pick up South Kihei Road, Kihei’s main drag, which is what you
should do if you’re heading to a destination in the north portion of Kihei
or if you’re looking for a supermarket or gas station; or, if you’re on your
way to the southern portion of Kihei — to Wailea or to Makena — stick
Part IV: Maui 
216

to the right as the Mokulele ends and pick up the Piilani Highway
(Highway 31), which continues south to Wailea. Near the end of the
Piilani Highway, you’ll veer right onto the coastal road to reach the
Wailea resorts or Makena.
The Mokulele Highway (Highway 311) is often the scene of crashes
involving intoxicated and speeding drivers, so be extra careful.
If you’re traveling from South Maui to West Maui, or vice versa, you
don’t need to travel all the way back to Kahului to pick up the appropri-
ate road. Highway 310 (North Kihei Road) connects the Mokulele
Highway (Highway 311, the road to South Maui) to the Honoapiilani
Highway (Highway 30, the road to West Maui), running east–west at the
south end of Maui’s “neck.”
Going Upcountry and to East Maui
The giant volcanic crater that dominates the main body of the island is
Haleakala (ha-lay-ah-ka-la), officially preserved as Haleakala National
Park. The distance from Kahului to the summit of Haleakala is only
about 38 miles, but the drive takes about 11⁄2 hours because of its curving
nature and steep ascent (to about 10,000 ft.). The drive is called the
Haleakala Highway, which is Highway 37 as it passes through open flat-
lands, past turnoffs for groovy rural towns like Haliimaile (ha-lee-ee-my-
lee; home to Haliimaile General Store, one of Maui’s finest restaurants;
see later in this chapter) and Makawao (a charming shopping stop).
Then, just past Makawao Avenue, the Haleakala Highway becomes
Highway 377 — so be sure to take the turn for it. After you pass through
the little town of Kula, turn onto Haleakala Crater Road (Highway 378),
which delivers you to the summit.
If you don’t take the Haleakala Crater Road turnoff, you’ll continue south
on Highway 377, which soon connects up with Highway 37 again, here
called the Kula Highway. If you stay on this road, it will eventually take
you all the way to Hana, the small, isolated town at the east end of the
island.
If you’re trying to get to Hana, the more popular route is the Hana
Highway (Highway 360), which hugs the north cliffs of Maui for about 52
miles east of Kahului. The Heavenly Road to Hana, as it’s often called, is
a winding drive that borders on treacherous in each direction, crossing
more than 50 one-lane bridges in the process. Still, it’s one of the most
spectacular scenic drives you’ll ever take in your life. I guide you
through it, mile by mile, in Chapter 13. Early in your drive to Hana, make
a pit stop in charming Paia, which has a number of restaurants and cafes
offering breakfast and picnic lunches to Hana goers.
The south route to Hana — which is officially Highway 31, but most folks
call it the Kaupo (cow-po) Road — was closed at press time due to 2006
earthquake damage. If you’re interested in checking it out, check with
your hotel or rental car company regarding potential reopening and cur-
rent road conditions. It’s usually fine if the weather has been clear, but

stay away if it’s been raining because unpaved sections of the road can
wash out. And check with your rental-car company before you set out;
many rental contracts actually forbid customers from driving their cars
on Kaupo Road.
Getting around without wheels
Operated by Roberts Hawaii, the Maui Bus public transit service 
(% 808-871-4838; www.co.maui.hi.us/bus) runs 11 bus routes
between Kahului, West Maui, South Maui, Paia, Haiku, and Upcountry
Maui. Both the upcountry and Paia/Haiku routes stop at the Kahului
Airport; however, keep in mind that only one medium-size suitcase is
allowed per passenger. The fare is $1 per boarding. Routes run generally
from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., but you should call or check the online route map
to figure out your most suitable route and schedule.
Maui does have islandwide taxi service. The meter can run up fast, but a
taxi will get you where you need to go if you don’t have your own wheels.
Call Alii Cab (% 808-661-3688), Maui Airport Taxi (% 808-281-9533;
www.nokaoitaxi.com), Kihei Taxi (% 808-879-3000), Wailea Taxi
(% 808-874-5000), or Maui Taxi Service (% 808-276-9515; www.maui
pleasanttaxi.com). The mandated fare on Maui is $3 per mile, 
accommodating one to six people. For limousine service, contact Star
Limousine (% 877-875-6900 or 808-669-6900; www.limohawaii.com) or
Maui Executive Transportation (% 800-833-2303; www.mauishuttle.
com). Taxis also cruise Lahaina in the evening, should you have an extra
tipple or two and require a sober driver to take you back to the condo.
If you’re going to skip renting a car on Maui, a good bet is to base your-
self in Lahaina, where restaurants, shops, and attractions are right at
hand. Your beach enjoyment will be limited, though; Lahaina does have
a beach, but it’s not the greatest.
An even better alternative for auto-free visitors is basing yourself in
Kaanapali — the beach is excellent here, and restaurants and shops are
right at hand in Whalers Village. A free resort shuttle connects hotels, golf,
and other attractions within the resort, but most of Kaanapali’s attractions
are within walking distance of one another. Ask the concierge or front desk
staff at your hotel for details on the Kaanapali Resort Shuttle, which pro-
vides free transportation throughout the resort daily from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Kapalua and Wailea also have local resort shuttles that you can rely
upon to transport you between destinations within the resort: to the golf
course, to local restaurants, and to resort shops.
If you’re coming to Maui and not renting a car, ultimately, your best bet
may be to call the concierge at the hotel where you’ll be staying before
you leave home. He or she will be able to give you a clear heads-up on
how convenient the hotel or resort is to nearby restaurants, shopping,
and the beach, as well as what kinds of transport are readily available
for you to get to other destinations on the island. Also see Chapter 13
for info on bus tours that can pick you up and drop you off at your hotel.

Staying in Style
Ever-popular Maui boasts a terrific crop of resorts. But high demand
means that both resort hotels and condos can — and do — garner
ridiculously high rack rates. Take heart, however: Some good bargains
are available, especially in the condo market. I’ve reviewed some of the
best values in the pages that follow. Those of you who want an even
wider array of budget-friendly options should contact one of the condo-
rental agencies listed at the end of this section.
You may be able to save more money on Maui than anywhere else in
Hawaii by purchasing a value-added package deal, especially if you’re
looking for an upscale vacation. Packagers scoop up huge numbers of
Maui hotel rooms, and because they’re buying rooms in bulk, they can
negotiate substantial price breaks and pass the savings on to you in
combination with airfares, car rentals, and the like. (Some packagers can
arrange land-only vacations if you already have your plane tickets cov-
ered.) See Chapter 5 for tips on where to look for package deals.
Maui’s best accommodations
In the following listings, each property is followed by a number of dollar
signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). Each represents the median
rack-rate price range for a double room per night, as follows:
$
Cheap — less than $150 per night
$$
Still affordable — $150–$225
$$$
Moderate — $225–$325
$$$$
Expensive but not ridiculous — $325–$450
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious — more than $450 per night
Don’t be scared off by the “rack rates” listed in these hotel reviews. You
almost never need to pay the asking price for a hotel room. See Chapter
7 for tips on how to avoid paying full price.
Also, don’t forget that the state adds 11.42 percent in taxes to your hotel
bill.
Aloha Cottage
$$–$$$
Upcountry Maui
Ron and Ranjana Serle, refugees from Philadelphia who made Upcountry
Maui their permanent home some years ago, have crafted a jungle oasis on
the slopes of Haleakala for romance-seeking couples. They have built two
gorgeous studio-style vacation-rental cottages on their lush upcountry
acreage, which is dense with eucalyptus, bamboo, banana trees, and fra-
grant tropical blooms. Ron and Ranjana have transported their love of
Thai and Southeast Asian architecture to the cottages — literally. The Thai
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 221

Tree House is a copy of a Chiang Mai river house, reinvented for jungle
living. The spacious vaulted-ceiling cottage is outfitted with imported fur-
niture and materials. Exotic Thai details are everywhere, from the teak
floors to the kitchen cabinetry to the oriental carpets. The luxuriant king
bed, with its leaded glass headboard, is the centerpiece of the cottage.
Your other option is the Bali Bungalow, an octagonal cottage with a glori-
ous interior rich with Balinese influence. Lovely touches include the gor-
geous silk bedspread, the overhead skylight that’s perfect for bedtime
stargazing, a marble shower with a dual-head shower system for two, and
Asian-style dining, on sofas with a low table. Both beautiful cottages fea-
ture full, well-outfitted kitchens (the Bali Bungalow’s is the larger of the
two); a large lanai with a soaking tub for two; TV with VCR; and plenty of
privacy. Really, it’s hard to get more romantic than this — perfect for hon-
eymooners. In fact, Ranjana can host small weddings on the gorgeous
grounds, cater romantic meals for two in the Lotus House meditation cot-
tage, arrange for an in-cottage massage, or teach a private yoga session
for two (she’s a certified instructor).

Fairmont Kea Lani Maui
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
This fanciful Moorish palace is just as pricey as Maui’s other luxury
resorts, but it gives you so much more room for your money. Spread out
and enjoy a giant one-bedroom suite, complete with a gorgeous living
room with a full entertainment center (CD and DVD players, plus a second
TV in the bedroom); a wet bar with coffeemaker and microwave; a mam-
moth marble bathroom with a soaking tub big enough for two, double
sinks, separate shower, and terrific toiletries; and a furnished lanai. The
two- and three-bedroom villas are even more luxurious, each boasting a
gourmet kitchen, a washer and dryer, a gas barbecue and plunge pool on
the private patio, and a prime on-the-sand location. Amenities include
three swimming pools (one for adults only), two Jacuzzis, an excellent spa
(second only to the neighboring Grand Wailea’s), a fitness center, a full
beach activities center, and a wealth of daily activities and kids’ programs.
It’s a first-rate choice on every level.

Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 223

Averaging an extra-large 640 square feet (although the Kea Lani’s suites
are even more spacious), the guest rooms here are done in soft, warm
tones and feature cushy furnishings, grand and gorgeous bathrooms
(among the best in Hawaii), and big lanais. About 80 percent have ocean
views, but beware those that overlook the driveway — it’s a real mood
killer. You’re better off with a gardenview room overlooking the lovely
sculpture gardens and waterfalls. The mountainview rooms are a good
value for pricey Maui, considering the quality of the accommodations and
service. The gorgeous grounds overflow with first-rate facilities — includ-
ing the only Hawaii branch of Wolfgang Puck’s legendary Spago restaurant
and a sublime spa. The beach is one of Maui’s finest, and the service is
exceptional. If you prefer to lounge poolside, you can recline in comfort
under a shaded cabana or on a grassy lawn; a pool attendant will even
bring you chilled towels and spritz you with Evian. The kids will be duly
pampered in an excellent activities program.

Grand Wailea Resort & Spa
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
Now part of the prestigious Waldorf=Astoria collection of luxury hotels,
this monument to moneyed excess won me over with its lush, art-filled
grounds (boasting works by such masters as Botero, Legér, Picasso, and
Warhol) and its exclusive tropical-theme-park vibe. The fantastic 50,000-
square-foot Spa Grande is the island’s ultimate temple to the pampered
life, whereas the pool complex is Hawaii’s best water playground, a fan-
tasy of falls, rapids, slides, grottos, hidden hot tubs, and swim-up bars,
plus the world’s only water-powered elevator. Rooms are huge and ele-
gantly appointed, with luxurious marble bathrooms. If you can afford it,
stay in the Napua Tower; this exclusive 100-room hotel-within-a-hotel
offers personalized concierge service plus free continental breakfast.
Restaurants, shops, and lounges abound, and both food and service are
first-rate. And bring the kids — they’ll think that they’ve died and gone to
heaven, especially after they see the whopping 20,000-square-foot kids’
camp. Despite the resort’s grandness, you’ll still feel comfortable roaming
around in your beach togs. This elegant fantasyland is an ideal place to tie
the knot, too, because it’s home to a picture-perfect seaside wedding
chapel. Minimalists, on the other hand, should book elsewhere.

Hana Oceanfront Cottages
$$$
Hana
Housed in two plantation-style buildings built by friendly California
refugees Dan and Sandi Simoni, these two marvelous one-bedroom units
are fully outfitted for Hana living. Each comes complete with a living room,
a fully appointed gourmet kitchen, supercomfortable furniture (including
beautifully made beds), a full bath, a TV with VCR and DVD player, a CD
player, and a big lanai with ocean views. The Beach Suite gives you a bit
more space, while the Beach Cottage gives you a bit more privacy and puts
you closer to the surf. The property boasts lush, mature tropical grounds.
Best of all, paradise-like Hamoa Beach, East Maui’s finest swimming 
spot — which James Michener called “the most beautiful beach in the
world” — is just steps away. A simply delightful place to stay, whether or
not you can afford the luxurious Hotel Hana-Maui down the road. Say hello
if you see Dan and Sandi’s next-door neighbor — Oprah Winfrey owns the
adjacent 4 acres.

$250–$275. 10 percent discount available for weeklong stays; 3-night minimum for
stays booked within 2 months of arrival, 4-night minimum for more advanced book-
ings. $75 cleaning fee. MC, V.
Hooilo House
$$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
Perched on a breezy hill above the West Maui coast is this elegant bed-
and-breakfast, coined Hooilo (“winter”) House by its innkeepers, who
sought refuge from the colder climes of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska
and chose Maui as their ultimate escape. Each of the six guest suites fea-
tures a comfortable custom king bed, an extra-large marble bathroom with
a tub and a private outdoor shower lined in lava rock, and a lanai furnished
for lounging with tranquil garden or ocean views.
The house is designed and decorated in the Balinese style. Practically every
wall is a window that opens to the breeze; the hallways are open-air bridges
that cross koi-filled riverlets, and each guest room is entered through an
imported Balinese door inlaid with Mother of Pearl that sets the mood for
something special, including such creative details as shower heads crafted
from stone-carved masks and bamboo. The owners live in an adjacent cot-
tage, so guests feel free to lounge or play a board game in the house’s
common area, which overlooks a lovely 4-foot-deep pool with panoramic
ocean views. This is the site for the morning buffet spread, which you can
enjoy at your leisure. I also like the full daily maid service, which isn’t a given
at all home-style accommodations. However, I do have a few quibbles: The
bedrooms are a hair’s-breadth smaller than I wish they were. The outdoor
shower is delightful, except when the wind kicks up; I wish I had a shower
option indoors. In a place with this much attention to detail, I don’t under-
stand why the small TVs have VCRs rather than DVD players. In a luxury
B&B designed for romance, there should really be a hot tub, as well as a pool
designed for more than dipping. And I think the innkeepers are a bit too aloof
— but you may actually prefer the hands-off approach. Still, Hoolio House

Hotel Hana-Maui
$$$$$
Hana
The Hotel Hana-Maui, a breathtaking oceanfront property that had lan-
guished in disrepair for too many years, was gloriously reborn a few years
ago, I’m happy to report. The same folks behind Big Sur’s amazing Post
Ranch Inn have transformed this property into one of Maui’s most magical
resorts, making it reason enough to cruise to Maui’s remote eastern shore.
The small hotel has just 66 rooms and suites nestled in one-story Hawaiian-
style cottages; its expansive and meticulously landscaped grounds slope
gently down to glorious Hana Bay, allowing for plenty of privacy and quiet
relaxation. Both the setting and the warmhearted staff exude an old-Hawaii
feeling. Accommodations boast only the most luxe comforts: Warm and
welcoming designer-stylish interiors featuring indigenous island materi-
als, textiles, and patterns. The duplex Sea Ranch cottages are the most lux-
urious, with cathedral ceilings, gorgeous oversize bathrooms, and private
lanais; about half have patio Jacuzzis. But you can’t go wrong with the low-
rise Bay View suites a little farther up the slope if your wallet is tighter. A
lack of TVs, radios, and air-conditioning (you don’t need it out here) suits
the mood perfectly; no one travels to the end of the road in Hana to watch
CNN. (The common Club Room has a giant-screen TV and Internet access
if you really need a fix.) A wealth of marvelous outdoor activities — from
cultural walks and horseback riding to sunbathing at Hamoa Beach, which
James Michener once called the most beautiful beach in the world — will
keep you content, as does the utterly pampering and peaceful Honua Spa.
The one downside: You may get tired of the cuisine after a time, since there
are no other restaurants in Hana other than the hotel’s own.

nishings, lovely local artwork, terra-cotta floors, and complete kitchens

barbecues, laundry facilities, and tons of beach toys make this a great place
to stay with friends or family. The one-bedrooms can sleep up to four — Mom
and Dad on the queen-size bed in the bedroom, two kids on the sleeper sofa.
The two-bedrooms can sleep up to six: One bedroom has a queen-size bed,
and the second has a full bed or two twin beds, plus a sleeper sofa in the bed-
room. Two-bedrooms also benefit from a prime beachfront location, and the
one-bedrooms are just steps from the beach nestled in colorful tropical
foliage. Service is thoughtful, friendly, and efficient. The divine Mama’s Fish
House — my favorite Maui restaurant (see review later in this chapter) — is
next door, and inn guests benefit from discounts at lunch and dinner. Just
down the road is hip-as-can-be Paia, the fun ’n’ funky surf town that serves
as the gateway to the road to Hana. The only downside? Despite the on-the-
beach location, only the luxury beachfront cottage has an ocean view.

West Maui (Kaanapali)
If you want luxury living and condo conveniences, this high-rise beach-
front complex is the place for you. These are Maui’s finest (and priciest)
condos, but they’re worth it. Each condo is privately owned, so decor
varies, but owners are held to a high standard. The one- and two-bedroom
apartments are universally large (between 1,500 and 1,900 sq. ft.) and
come with a fully equipped gourmet kitchen, huge living room and dining
room, two TVs and VCR, two full bathrooms (even in the one-bedrooms),
washer/dryer, and private lanais. The luxuriant grounds feature a fitness
room, tennis, a smallish heated pool with hot tub and poolside snack serv-
ice plus a separate kids’ pool, a beach activities center, and poolside gas
grills for fun family meals. Among the resortlike amenities are daily maid
service; concierge, bell, valet, and room service; complimentary kids’ club
activities in summer; yoga classes; and even grocery delivery and a resi-
dent tennis pro. Service is friendly and accommodating. Best of all, the
location — oceanfront at the southern end of fabulous Kaanapali Beach —
simply can’t be beat. An excellent choice on all fronts.

Kaanapali Beach Hotel
$$–$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
The Kaanapali Beach is the last hotel left in Hawaii that gives you a real
resort experience in this price range. It’s older and it’s not luxurious, but
it boasts a genuine spirit of aloha that’s absent in many other hotels. Set
beachfront around a wide, grassy lawn with a whale-shaped pool, three
Part IV: Maui 
230

low-rise wings house spacious, well-maintained rooms. They may be rather
motel-like, but they’re nevertheless perfectly comfortable and feature all
the conveniences, plus lanais overlooking the pretty yard or beach. Tiki
torches, hula, and music create an irresistible Hawaiian ambience every
evening, and the service is some of the friendliest around. An extensive
Hawaiiana program goes beyond the standard hula lessons to include
Lauhala weaving, lei making, and cultural tours. A kids’ program, three
just-fine restaurants, and a coin-op laundry are also on-site. This hotel is
one of my all-time favorites, and one of Travel + Leisure’s too: The maga-
zine has dubbed the Kaanapali Beach Hotel as Hawaii’s top hotel for value,
and second-best hotel in the world for less than $200 a night.
Unfortunately, rates have begun to climb, but they remain relatively afford-
able considering the excellent location and warm spirit of the place.

West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
These oceanfront condos are an excellent value, one of Maui’s best. The
attractive wooden complex stair-steps down pretty terraced grounds to a
petite but perfect swimming cove fringed with white sands. The apart-
ments are roomy enough to accommodate families, especially the two-bed-
rooms, which boast two full bathrooms. Every unit has attractive
island-style furniture; a complete kitchen with dishwasher, microwave, and
even an icemaker in the fridge; washer/dryer; DVD player and sleeper sofa
in the living room; and big lanais with terrific views. Nestled between the
coastline and the road above, the complex is much more private than
many on this condo coast. On-site are a lovely heated pool and Jacuzzi, a
separate kids’ pool, barbecues, and beach showers. What’s more, daily
maid service (not a given in condos) makes it actually feel like vacation.

Koa Lagoon
$$
South Maui (Kihei)
This delightful condo complex just may be the top bargain of the Kihei
coast. This midrise building has 42 units — all with a breathtaking ocean-
front setting with views that most visitors have to pay much more to enjoy.
Each large one-bedroom (700 sq. ft. plus lanai) or two-bedroom (975 sq. ft.
plus lanai) apartment is nicely decorated and smartly outfitted. Features
include large furnished lanais, a full all-electric kitchen with dishwasher
and microwave, a washer/dryer, a TV with VCR or DVD, a sofa bed in the
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 231

living room, and air-conditioning (not the best, but you’re unlikely to need
it). Unlimited free local calls and free high-speed Internet access are nice
pluses. On the impeccably maintained grounds you’ll find a heated pool
and gas barbecues to share with your fellow residents — plus those won-
derful ocean views, which come alive with whale sightings in the winter
months, and nightly year-round at the sunset hour (the building is western
facing). Unit 503 is particularly popular thanks to its spectacular sightlines.
The whole place is consistently clean and well taken care of, with friendly
and professional service. I also like the location at the north end of Kihei,
which is relatively quiet and convenient to the rest of the island’s sights
and attractions. All in all, one of Maui’s finest values.

Koa Resort
$
South Maui (Kihei)
These condos aren’t fancy, but they sit right across the street from the
ocean, and they make a good choice for active families on tight budgets:
On-site are two tennis courts, a very nice swimming pool, a hot tub, and
an 18-hole putting green. The spacious, privately owned one-, two-, and
three-bedroom units are fully equipped and have plenty of room for even
a large clan. Each comes with a full kitchen (complete with dishwasher,
microwave, and coffeemaker), a large lanai, ceiling fans, and a washer/
dryer. The majority of two- and three-bedroom units have multiple bath-
rooms. The smaller units have showers only, so ask for one with a tub if it
matters to you. Also, for maximum peace and quiet, ask for a unit removed
from Kihei Road.

Lahaina Shores Resort
$$–$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
This dated but pleasant plantation-style complex of studios and one-bed-
room suites sits right on the sand at the quiet end of Lahaina, within easy
walking distance of restaurants, shopping, and entertainment, but nicely
out of the noisy fray. The hotel is more basic than stylish, but the units are
comfortable and decently outfitted, and the price is right, especially con-
sidering the on-the-beach location. Even the smallest unit is a spacious
550 square feet. Every one comes with a fully equipped kitchen (with
microwave), sitting and dining areas, and a furnished lanai. Obviously,
those units overlooking the waves and the island of Lanai across the chan-
nel are best, but the mountain views aren’t shabby here either; still, given
the all-around good value, splurge on an ocean view if you can. Do know,
however, that individually owned units can vary in quality; some have
Part IV: Maui 
232

been recently updated, while others need attention. When you book,
inquire about the specific quality and features of your unit. Outside is a
lovely grassy lawn with a small pool, hot tub, and lounge chairs; just
beyond it is a narrow stretch of swimming beach. (First-time surfers often
learn on the low-riding waves here.) Other pleasantries include on-site
laundry facilities, and tennis courts just across the street. Best for those
who want a good price on an in-town, close-to-conveniences location. Note
that units can be rented through two different brokers (see below), so I
highly recommend that you price compare.

Mana Kai Maui
$–$$
South Maui (Kihei)
Situated on a beautiful white-sand beach with excellent snorkeling, this
eight-story hotel-condo hybrid is one of my favorite affordable choices.
About half the units are hotel rooms, which are smallish but offer great
value. The larger one- and two-bedroom apartments feature full up-to-date
kitchens, nice island-style furnishings, well-maintained bathrooms, and
open living rooms that lead to small lanais with ocean views. These units
are older, but they’re clean and comfortable, thanks to daily maid service.
A coin-op laundry is located on each floor, a restaurant and lounge are
downstairs, and a nice pool and a grassy lawn with beach chairs comple-
ment that fabulous beach. Management is friendly and conscientious. But
the Mana Kai’s real ace in the hole is its location: It lies on Wailea’s
doorstep, on the prettiest, most quiet end of Kihei, away from the strip-
mall fray. Maui Yoga Path operates an open-air studio on the Mana Kai
grounds, offering daily classes by the ocean.

Maui Coast Hotel
$$
South Maui (Kihei)
This affordable hotel is recommended for its good package deals, and 
its central (if not terribly attractive) location, about a block from the 
beach and a short walk away from restaurants, shopping, and nightlife.
This isn’t the Four Seasons, so don’t expect luxury — but the clean, simple
rooms feature good-value extras, including sitting areas, coffeemakers,
minifridges, Nintendo game systems, and furnished lanais. Add a pretty

good restaurant, room service, free use of laundry facilities, a nice pool
with poolside service (plus one for the kids), two Jacuzzis, a restaurant,
and tennis courts (with lights for night play), and you end up with a full-
service hotel at a bargain price. The suites offer families excellent value,
especially if you can find a package to suit you.

Napili Bay
$–$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
This excellent bargain sits on Napili’s beautiful half-mile white-sand beach.
This small, two-story complex is perfect for an affordable romantic get-
away; the sound of the waves creates a comfortable and relaxing atmos-
phere. The studio apartments are definitely small, but still, you have a full
kitchen (with fridge and coffeemaker), a queen-size bed, a queen-size
sleeper sofa that lets you sleep two more (if you don’t mind lots of togeth-
erness), a TV with DVD, CD player, and a spacious lanai where you can sit
and watch the sun set. Note that each unit is individually owned, so fur-
nishings can vary, but the quality is consistently good. Louvered windows
and ceiling fans keep the units cool during the day. You have plenty of
restaurants and a convenience store within walking distance, and you’re
about 10 to 15 minutes away from Lahaina and some great golf courses.
Coin-op washer/dryers and a barbecue are nice features. The beach right
out front is one of the best on the coast, with great swimming and snor-
keling right out your door. Book early, because this place fills up fast. Also
note that you have two sources for booking: You can book through Maui
Beachfront Rentals or Aloha Condos, which allows you to book directly
from the owners themselves. Both sites feature pictures of available units
so you can choose the one you like. Attention, Internet addicts: Only a
few units have high-speed Internet access, so ask for one if you want it.

Napili Kai Beach Resort
$$$–$$$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
Make yourselves right at home at this complex of bright one- and two-story
units embracing its own, wonderful white-sand snorkeling beach. There
are a handful of basic hotel rooms with minifridges and coffeemakers, but
most units have lovely tropical-modern decor, a large lanai, a DVD player,
Part IV: Maui 
234

and kitchenettes (all with microwave, some with dishwasher). The one-
bedrooms have sleeping accommodations in both rooms — usually a king-
size bed in one room, two twin beds in the other — making this a great
configuration for families; some even have a second bathroom. The two-
bedrooms can sleep as many as six or seven, and all have a second bath-
room. The Khaka suites unite two or three adjoining hotel rooms or
studios in one value-priced package for families or shares. Most, but not
all, units offer air-conditioning, so ask if you want it (you’ll need it only in
summer); otherwise, ceiling fans do the trick. The complex has a restau-
rant and bar with a great view; however, I’ve heard too many complaints
that it’s overpriced for what you get, and most guests don’t dine here more
than once. The beach pagoda serves daytime snacks and drinks and doles
out snorkel gear for your free use. There’s also daily maid service, four
pools and a hot tub, barbecues, a fitness room, an 18-hole putting green,
and a basic spa. During family seasons (Easter/spring break, summer, and
Christmas), kids ages 6 to 10 can enjoy the supervised Keiki Club, with two
hours of activities daily (except Sun), plus Wednesday-night movies. All in
all a nice place to stay, if not a bargain.

Noelani Condominium Resort
$–$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
I stand by all my recommendations, but that doesn’t mean I don’t get a
teensy bit nervous when my boss says that she’s going to take me up on
one. So I was thrilled when she came home from Maui confirming my own
observations — that this top-notch oceanfront condo is a stellar value and
a great place to stay. All the well-maintained apartments sport kitchens,
VCRs, ceiling fans (no air-conditioning), and spectacular ocean views; all
but the studios have dishwashers and washer/dryers too (self-service
laundry facilities are available for studio dwellers). Best is the Antherium
building, where apartments have ocean-facing lanais just 20 feet from the
surf. Concierge and midweek maid service, two freshwater pools (one
heated for night swimming), and an oceanfront Jacuzzi round out the good
value. You’re invited to a continental breakfast orientation on the first day
of your stay, and mai tai parties in the evenings; oceanfront barbecues are
ideal for family outings. Next door is a sandy cove that’s popular with
snorkelers, but you may find yourself driving to a prettier beach — at
these prices, you won’t mind. All in all, one of the best values the island
has to offer.

Outrigger Aina Nalu
$$–$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
Run by Outrigger, the value-minded, Hawaii-based hotel chain, this well-
managed plantation-style complex makes a nice place to stay, especially
when you can score a good deal (which you usually can). The newly rede-
veloped property offers petite studios and more spacious one- and two-
bedrooms with fresh, contemporary island-style decor that is more
attractive than you might expect; Outrigger did a very nice job here.
Studios have a microwave and minifridge; all other units have fully outfit-
ted kitchens. All units have lush garden views, air-conditioning, and video
games. The one- and two-bedroom apartments have dishwashers, sofa
beds, and their own washer/dryers. Note that bathrooms have showers
only, no tubs. The well-manicured grounds feature barbecues, a hot tub,
and a nice pool. The larger units are perfect for families; your kids will love
the heart-of-Lahaina location, and you’ll appreciate the tranquil ambience
that results from a peaceful side-street location (a rarity in Lahaina). The
complex is very quiet in general, but ask for a unit away from the highway
for minimum intrusion. Note that this two-story building has no elevators.

Punahoa Beach Apartments
$$
South Maui (Kihei)
With the best location in Kihei, this friendly little complex is a bona fide
beachfront bargain. The setting — off noisy, traffic-congested Kihei Road,
on a quiet side street that faces the ocean — is fabulous: A grassy lawn
extends down to the sand, where great offshore snorkeling awaits, and a
popular surfing spot sits just next door. A coin-op laundry is on-site, and
markets and restaurants are but a stroll away. The apartments aren’t fancy,
but they’re nicer than you’d expect for the money; each has a fully
equipped kitchen and a lanai with great ocean views. Studios have
Murphy-style queen beds, one-bedrooms have king beds, and corner-unit
two-bedrooms have a queen in the master and twin beds in the second
bedroom. Only a few units have air-conditioning, but ceiling fans draw in
the trade winds. Guests keep coming back, so reserve your bargain unit
as far in advance as possible.

Ritz-Carlton Kapalua
$$$$$
West Maui (Kapalua)
Situated at the end of the road in glorious Kapalua, Maui’s most gorgeous
planned community, the Ritz is a destination resort by virtue of its location
alone. But you won’t need to hop in the car every day in search of fun,
because everything is right at hand: a small but fabulous beach and activ-
ities galore, including Kapalua’s 54 holes of world-class, tournament-qual-
ity golf, as well as its justifiably renowned art school for vacationers who
want to feed a creative appetite. The natural setting — on 50 terraced
oceanfront acres, surrounded by century-old Norfolk pines and ironwood
trees — is breathtaking.
Thanks to a multimillion-dollar renovation completed in early 2008, the
hotel is more glorious than ever. Designed to look like a grand plantation
house, the hotel is airy and graceful, with a gracious pool area, two hot
tubs, and a professional croquet lawn. The spacious and tropically gor-
geous rooms surpass the chain’s usual high standard with heavenly feath-
erbeds, extra-large marble bathrooms, and gorgeous island-inspired decor.
The dining is excellent, especially the superb sushi bar, Kai, and the gor-
geous, Asian-inspired Banyan Tree restaurant. The amenities are extensive
(including a full-service spa that was dramatically expanded and upgraded
as part of the renovation, a new state-of-the-art fitness center, the out-
standing Ritz Kids program as well as an environmental education center
for kids and teens, and a full-time cultural advisor who imbues the service
and programming with genuine respect for the culture), and the service is
unsurpassed. Still, some may find it a tad too formal for Hawaii.
Furthermore, you might expect an on-the-beach location for these prices,
but the hotel is situated slightly uphill. You may find it worthwhile to
spend a few extra dollars for a club-level room; club guests enjoy individ-
ualized concierge service and five — yes, five — complimentary food pre-
sentations throughout the day, including a generous morning continental
spread. Ask about the brand-new one- and two-bedroom residential suites,
if you can afford to do so.

Sheraton Maui

West Maui (Kaanapali)
This expansive resort hotel boasts the best location on Kaanapali Beach:
on a spectacular stretch of sand at the foot of Black Rock, one of Maui’s
best offshore snorkel spots. Much like its Kauai sister, this Sheraton is
ideal for those who don’t care for the forced formality or over-the-top
excesses that often go hand-in-hand with resort vacations. The Sheraton
Maui has an easygoing, open style, and great facilities for families and
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 237

active types, including a nice fitness center and an open-air spa. The lagoon-
like pool features lava-rock waterways, wooden bridges, and an open-air
whirlpool. You’re greeted with a lei upon arrival, and then the valet takes
you and your luggage straight to your room so you don’t need to stand in
line — a smooth, personalized touch. The big, island-style rooms are attrac-
tive and comfortable, with nice features like the justly named Sheraton
SweetSleeper bed, flat-panel TVs, minifridges, coffeemakers, and a private
lanai. Building 6 is the place to be during whale-watch season; the rooms
directly overlook one of the whales’ favorite playpens. A class of oversize
two-room Ohana suites is designed with families in mind; the junior suites
can also suit families well, or make a great splurge for couples looking for
room to spread out in luxury. Restaurants and bars (including the fun and
flavorful Teppan-yaki Dan’s for Benihana-style dining), a nightly torch-light-
ing and cliff-diving show, a terrific year-round kids’ program, a spa, tennis
courts, and lots of other extras further the appeal, and the location just
can’t be beat. A terrific hotel from start to finish — it’s no surprise that this
was Sheraton’s North American “Hotel of the Year” in 2007.

Wailea Beach Marriott Resort & Spa
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
This appealing property has an airy, comfortable feel, and it’s looking
better than ever after a $60-million total renovation was completed in 2006.
Eight buildings, all low-rise except for an eight-story tower, are thought-
fully spread over 22 gracious acres, with lots of open parklike space and a
half-mile of prime oceanfront. The spacious guest rooms have all been
completely redecorated with a more sleek and elegant look. There’s a com-
prehensive kids’ program for keiki ages 5 to 13, plus five pools — including
a kid-friendly water activities playground complete with a pair of water
slides — and a terrific beach out front. A good indoor/outdoor restaurant
and nightly Hawaiian entertainment, a coin-op laundry, a fitness center, and
the full-service Mandara Spa and salon make life easier for the grown-ups
in your group, too. My biggest complaint is that the resort fee is too high,
and it irks me to have to pay even more extra to access the Internet — but
if you leave your computer at home, you won’t notice.

Westin Maui Resort & Spa
$$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
This hotel isn’t quite as fabulous as the Grand Wailea (reviewed earlier in
this chapter), but it’s often cheaper, and your kids will be in water-hog
heaven here, too, thanks to an 87,000-square-foot “Aquatic Playground”
complete with swim-through grottoes, waterfalls, and a 128-foot water
slide. (Fear not, grown-ups: You get to play in an adults-only pool and a
secluded Jacuzzi.) Rooms are on the smallish side, but they’re stylishly
contemporary. Each and every one boasts a celestial Heavenly Bed, which
will keep me coming back to Westin every time. The Heavenly Shower adds
to the luxury in the bathroom, and your youngest ones can enjoy Westin’s
own plush-as-can-be Heavenly Cribs. A prime stretch of Kaanapali Beach
and a wealth of facilities are on hand, including a well-outfitted fitness
center with an array of classes, a gorgeous 13,000-square-foot spa, and a
full children’s program. The stylish Tropica restaurant isn’t the best on
Maui, but the innovative fare is just fine, and the oceanfront setting is both
designer-sleek and romantic at the same time. Beware the timeshare sales-
person in the lobby; if you get suckered in, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach

West Maui (Kaanapali)
Not only would I stay at this beachfront mid-rise condo complex again,
but I’d move in here if I could. The Whaler was built in the ’70s and still
sports a few “Me Decade” hallmarks, but in a good way — it feels like
the kind of place where Jack Lord would keep his neighbor-island bach-
elor pad. The relaxing atmosphere starts in the clean-lined, open-air
lobby and continues in the impeccably kept apartments. They’re pri-
vately owned and individually decorated, but all have fully equipped
kitchens, VCRs, marble bathrooms, and big, blue-tiled lanais. Many one-
bedrooms have two full bathrooms, making them great for small fami-
lies or shares. Most units have some kind of ocean view, but the garden
views are also pleasant. Luxuries include daily maid service, plus bell
and concierge services. The grounds are private and well-manicured,
and on-site extras include an oceanfront pool and spa, five tennis courts,
an exercise room, and great dining and shopping at neighboring Whalers

Home sweet vacation condo
Well-developed Maui abounds with condo developments. I review my
favorites in this chapter, but there are many more. Many complexes
aren’t handled by a single management company; instead, real-estate
agencies tend to manage individual units throughout a variety of com-
plexes in a given area. So if you want to expand your choices, contact
one of the following agencies, which can match you up with the unit that
meets your needs and budget.
For a complete selection of upscale condos throughout sunny, luxury-
inded Wailea, reach out to Destination Resorts Hawaii (% 866-384-1365
or 808-891-6249; www.destinationresortshi.com). Prices start as low 
as $225 or so for a one-bedroom and up for a spacious oceanfront four-
bedroom. Value-add packages such as fifth-night-free and car-condo deals
are regularly available.
Although all of their condos make pleasing choices, Destination Resorts’
Wailea Beach Villas (% 866-901-5207 or 808-891-4500; www.waileabeach
villas.com) have set a new standard for condominium luxe on Maui. New
to the market in June 2006, these 98 glorious villas and “penthouses” blend
luxurious, home-style comforts with first-class resort services (even fully
stocked kitchens and personal chef services, if you wish) and a wonderful
Wailea Beach location. Rates run $880 to $3,000 nightly for the 1,900- to
3,100-square-foot residences, with a five-night minimum stay.
If you like the sound of the tranquil Kapalua resort but the Ritz-Carlton’s
luxury hotel rates are out of your league — or you simply prefer home-
style amenities and privacy — consider renting an elegant condo or vaca-
tion home through Kapalua Villas (% 800-545-0018, 800-227-6054, or
808-665-5400; www.kapaluavillas.com). Nightly rates range from $279 for
a one-bedroom apartment with a fairway view to $759 for an oceanfront
two-bedroom. Golf, tennis, rental-car, and romance packages are available.
Bello Realty (% 800-541-3060 or 808-879-3328; www.bellomaui
vacations.com) represents affordable condos throughout the Kihei/
Wailea area, with prices starting as low as $99 in the low season, $115 in
the high season. Be sure to check out Koa Resort and Koa Lagoon, two
of Maui’s best bargains (reviewed earlier in this chapter). Condominium
Rentals Hawaii (% 800-367-5242 or 808-879-2778; www.crhmaui.com)
has moderately priced condos throughout Maui, with a concentration in
Part IV: Maui 
240

Kihei, and handles the Mana Kai (reviewed earlier in this chapter). The
car-and-condo packages and other regular specials can really up the
value-to-dollar ratio on their units.
You can choose from a range of good-value apartments along West
Maui’s condo coast through Maui Beachfront Rentals (% 888-661-7200
or 808-661-3500; www.mauibeachfront.com). One of their best deals for
budget-minded couples is the studios at the Napili Bay, which start out
between $145 and $167. They may even be able to save you a few dollars
at two of my favorite Kaanapali Beach condo complexes, The Whaler
and Kaanapali Alii (reviewed earlier in this chapter). Ask about pack-
ages that include a free night or a rental car.
A Southern California–based agency, Hawaii Condo Exchange (% 800-
442-0404 or 323-436-0300; www.hawaiicondoexchange.com), acts as a
consolidator for condo properties throughout the islands. They repre-
sent a number of excellent properties on Maui.
You can cut out the middle man and rent directly from the owner at a
number of quality condo resorts on Maui, including the terrific Napili Bay,
The Whaler, and a few other good-quality condo resorts by visiting Aloha
Condos Hawaii (www.alohacondos.com), a cooperative of owner-managed
units; links on the site will connect you directly to the owner.
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 241
Staying off the beaten path
Situated at the far east end of the winding Hana Highway (Highway 36/360), isolated
from the rest of the island by a three-hour drive, Hana makes a dreamy place to kick
back and stay awhile, surrounded by little but lush natural beauty. One of Maui’s most
popular attractions is the drive along the winding 50-plus-mile route, one of the most
beautiful scenic drives in the world. (I cover it in detail in Chapter 13.)
Most people drive to Hana and back again in a day, which is an entirely doable trip. It
makes for one long day, however, because the curving highway has only one lane in
each direction and 50 or so one-lane bridges. What’s more, because the drive itself
boasts so many wonderful stops, simply getting there can turn into an all-day event.
So consider making it a leisurely trip by booking a place to stay at the end of the road
in lush and lovely Hana for a couple of nights. It’s a good idea, except for a few down-
sides: Many of the area’s B&Bs and rentals require a two-night stay at least (some-
times longer), and, in general, Hana accommodations aren’t cheap.
If you would like to stay in Hana but you can’t afford the gloriously reinvented Hotel
Hana-Maui or you can’t get into Hana Oceanfront Cottages (both reviewed earlier 
in this chapter), I recommend contacting Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts
(% 800-262-9912 or 808-885-4550; www.bestbnb.com), which has a wonderful
selection of B&Bs, inns, and vacation rentals. The company has inspected and
approved the fine choices in Hana as well as other off-the-beaten-path areas of the
island. Hawaii’s Best holds all of the property owners it represents to a very high stan-
dard, so you can be assured of quality lodgings if you book with the company.

Dining Out
Maui’s dining scene is excellent. The lovely and charismatic Valley Isle
has attracted so many top chefs from around the globe that it’s tough to
choose among their outposts.
But be prepared to pay for the privilege of dining on Maui. Generally
speaking, you can expect to spend more for dinner here than you will on
the other islands. Maui is overflowing with restaurants, so choice isn’t a
problem; but you’ll have to navigate a minefield of overpriced, mediocre-
quality restaurants in order to get value for your dollar. The listings in
this chapter offer a recommendable course of action, whether you’re
looking for a splurge-worthy special-occasion restaurant or a satisfying
casual meal that relieves the pressure on your wallet.
Lahaina, on Maui’s west shore, is the heart of the island’s dining scene.
Luckily, it’s quite convenient — no more than a half-hour’s drive or so
from any of the beach resorts (45 minutes from Wailea). Many of its
restaurants — even the affordable ones — boast front-row, on-the-water
seats for spectacular sunset watching. But nowhere else is the minefield
of mediocrity more explosive, so choose carefully.
In the restaurant listings that follow, each restaurant name is followed by
a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar
signs are meant to give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one
person — with appetizer, main course, dessert, a drink, tax, and tip — is
likely to cost. The price categories go like this:
$
Cheap eats — less than $20 per person
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$35
$$$
Moderate — $35–$50
$$$$
Pricey — $50–$75
$$$$$
Ultraexpensive — more than $75 per person
If you’re on a budget, skip the really expensive entrees and bottles of
wine so that you can still enjoy yourself at the pricier restaurants. To
give you a further idea of how much you can expect to spend, I also
include the price range of main courses in the listings. (Prices can
change at any time, of course, but restaurants usually don’t raise their
prices by more than a dollar or two at any given time.)
The state adds roughly 4 percent in taxes to every restaurant bill. The
percentage may vary slightly depending on the county you’re in, and
may be embedded in the total purchase price or shown as an independ-
ent line item on your bill. A 15 to 20 percent tip for the server is stan-
dard, just like on the mainland.

West Maui (Lahaina)
Local Hawaiian
This charming, cheap patio restaurant specializes in traditional pan-cul-
tural foods of Hawaii: great saimin (ramen noodle soup), teriyaki chicken,
finger-lickin’ Korean-style kalbi barbecue ribs, coconut shrimp, mahimahi
sandwiches, stir-frys, and other local staples, plus burgers (both taro and
beef) and a succulent kalua pig sandwich. Succulent roast duck, stir frys
and chow fun noodle dishes reveal the Chinese influence. Most dishes are
served as complete meals (a style called “plate lunch”) accompanied by
“two scoop” rice and a scoop of macaroni salad; they can be ordered mini,
regular, or sumo-size to customize to your appetite. Brought to you by the
people behind the Old Lahaina Luau (the top luau in the islands, described
later in this chapter), this colorful place serves up the best local food
around. Don’t expect gourmet — this is Hawaii’s version of paper-plate
eats, and the setting is super-casual but island colorful and friendly. But
you will get real value — and in an oceanfront setting to boot! The restau-
rant even has a bar, so you can celebrate the sunset with a tropical cock-
tail or wash down your hearty meal with an ice-cold beer as long as you
take a seat on the upper deck; both levels have lovely ocean views. Fruit
juices and smoothies are available, too. Corn dogs and grilled cheese are
available for keiki (kids), but the mini-size plate lunches suit smaller
appetites, too.
See map p. 247. 1285 Front St. (across from Lahaina Cannery Mall), Lahaina. % 808-
661-3322. www.alohamixedplate.com. Reservations not taken. Main courses
and plate lunches: $4–$13. MC, V. Open: Lunch and dinner daily.
Capische?
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
Mediterranean-Italian
Nestled in a little-known hilltop resort that caters largely to Japanese
guests, this dreamy hideaway is one of Maui’s true hidden gems. Capische?
boasts majestic coastal vistas, an ultraromantic ambience, and service
that’s both friendly and professional. The menu showcases the culinary
delights of the Mediterranean. Book a table on the lanai or the lovely
alfresco terrace and come for sunset to maximize the views and your
enjoyment. I find the starters to be the stars of the menu; begin with the
delectable quail saltimbocca wrapped in apple-smoked bacon, the to-die-
for kabocha pumpkin gnocchi in sage brown butter, or a garden-fresh cap-
rese salad of buffalo mozzarella, sweet baby basil, and local Kula tomatoes.
Follow with a seafood-rich cioppino, a Gorgonzola-crusted filet mignon
with Maui onion jus, or one of the delightful daily specials. A pianist often
adds to the ambience, sometimes accompanied by a sultry jazz singer.
There’s also a sexy martini lounge if you’re in the mood for something
shaken or stirred. Winner of the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence for
four years running, Capische? also received Chef of the Year for owner-
chef Brian Etheredge and Most Romantic restaurant kudos from readers of
the Maui No Ka Oi magazine in 2008. This really is the most romantic spot
on Maui.

$–$$
Central Maui (Paia)
American/International
Before I set out on any drive to Hana, I always make time for a hearty break-
fast at Charley’s (named after the owner’s Great Dane). This is my favorite
breakfast place on Maui, thanks to overstuffed breakfast burritos, fluffy
omelets, mac-nut pancakes, and eggs Benedict with perfectly puckery hol-
landaise. Lunch and dinner bring burgers, kiawe-smoked (mesquite-
smoked) ribs and marlin, calzones baked fresh to order, and a variety of
vegetarian delights, from veggie lasagna to bounteous salads and stir-frys.
Expect nothing in the way of ambience, but service is friendly and prices
are low, making Charley’s worth the half-hour drive from Kihei for an
affordable and unpretentious meal, even if you’re not heading to Hana. The
adjacent roadhouse-style bar serves up a good selection of microbrews.

Cheeseburger in Paradise/Cheeseburger Island Style
$–$$
West Maui (Lahaina)/South Maui (Wailea)
American
This oceanfront burger joint (not affiliated with singer Jimmy Buffett’s
mainland chain, but sister to the Waikiki locations) is a perennial favorite
thanks to an always-lively atmosphere, consistently terrific food, and mil-
lion-dollar views, all at bargain-basement prices. At the original Lahaina
location — the first in the burgeoning mini-chain — the second-level
open-air room offers a prime ocean view from every seat. The Wailea
location is set back farther from the surf, but an upstairs location gives
it its own terrific ocean vistas, and the retro-hip decor sets just the right
mood. No matter which location you choose, the tropical-style burgers
are first-class all the way — big, juicy mounds of natural Angus beef,
served on fresh-baked buns, and guaranteed to satisfy even the most
committed connoisseur. Chili dogs, fish and chips, crispy onion rings,
and spiced fries broaden the menu. Vegetarian options include the excel-
lent garden and tofu burgers and a meal-size salad, all good for the dieter
as well, who might also choose the lean chicken breast sandwich. Two
full bars boast a festive, first-rate menu of tropical drinks (including one
of the best piña coladas in the islands). Lively music every night rounds
out the party-hearty appeal at both locations. You can even launch your
day oceanside with hearty omelets, French toast, eggs Benedict, and
other morning faves.

West Maui (Lahaina)

Cilantro Grill promises “a fresh take on Old Mexico” — and it delivers the
goods at incredible prices. Here’s living proof that fast food doesn’t have
to be unhealthy and overprocessed. Chef Paris Nabavi has re-created
authentic recipes from Mexico’s heartland, and reinvented them with local
island ingredients (for example, combining a dash of grilled pineapple
salsa with the succulent adobo roasted pork found in the tacos al pastor).
Each dish is bursting with flavor. Tired of plain old guacamole? Then try
Cilantro Grill’s guacamole tom-tom, which combines chopped tomatoes
and tomatillos with avocados and onions and livens things up with the
zing of lime, cilantro, and Serrano chili. The clean-lined, zesty-hued interior
is a step up from other quick-service restaurants, too.

CJ’s Deli & Diner

West Maui (Kaanapali)
American
“Comfort food at comfort prices” — that’s the motto at CJ’s, and this
cheap-chic diner keeps its word. An extensive chalkboard menu hangs
from the brightly colored wall above the open-air kitchen. Menu items
include generous farmer-style breakfasts, hearty veggie-packed salads,
half-pound burgers, classic Reubens, roasted chicken, pot roast, and
fresh-grilled fish. There’s a pleasing local flair to the offerings, including
a host of homemade baked goodies. Don’t miss the hot malasadas, a light
and flaky sweet pastry, sort of like a powdered-sugar–covered donut
hole, which is one of the islands’ favorite sweet treats. Food can be pre-
pared for takeout or plated to enjoy in the casual, colorful dining room;
you can even order one of their “chefs to go” meals that’s completely
prepped to be thrown on the grill when you get back to the condo.
There’s even an Internet-connected computer so you can check your
e-mail while you wait. Stop by for a box lunch to go if you’re heading to
Hana, Haleakala, or the beach. There’s also a kids’ menu on hand. A great
choice for wallet-watchers.

Da’ Kitchen
$
South Maui (Kihei)/Central Maui (Kahului)
Local Hawaiian
Da’ Kitchen is the place to come for local grinds. The simple but comfort-
able Kihei closet is the original; come for the food, not the mood. Place
your order at the counter and then grab one of the handful of tables to
chow down on the extra hearty eats. All the classic Hawaiian plate lunches
come with two scoops of rice, plus potato and macaroni salad (you can
request a green salad instead) — trust me, you won’t leave here hungry.
Good choices include pulled kalua pork, slow-cooked until tender and sea-
soned with Hawaiian salt; chicken katsu, breaded in panko crumbs and
served with Japanese barbecue sauce; and loco moco, a hamburger patty
grilled, topped with two fried eggs, and smothered in gravy (a dieter’s
delight!). Also recommended are a yummy lemon chicken and a couple of
teriyaki dishes for more mainstream tastes, plus big Asian-style noodle
bowls, hamburgers, and a better-than-you’d-expect Chinese chicken salad.
Some locals complain that this is local food “for tourists,” but I continue
to see plenty of locals here, especially at the Kahului location. The color-
ful Kahului location is more cafe-style, with full table service.

The Flatbread Company
$–$$
Paia
Pizza
This utterly delightful new entry to the Maui dining scene is well worth
the drive to Paia (about ten minutes east of Kahalui along the Hana
Highway) for its terrific value, excellent fare, and all-around satisfying
dining experience. As you might expect, The Flatbread Company special-
izes in pizza. Their all-natural, wood-fired pizzas are baked right in the
center of the colorful, high-rafted open dining room, in a massive clay
oven. You can watch the night’s baker (a small chalkboard announces his
name — ours was Bob) nurture the flatbreads and other dishes to kiawe-
charred perfection. All ingredients that can be organic and/or island grown
are, including free-range and chemical-free meats; the dough is even made
fresh daily from 100 percent organically grown wheat.
The menu features two main sections: salads and flatbreads. However, the
wide variety of combinations will keep everyone in your party engaged.
You can choose from one of the creatively designed pizzas — such as
Mopsy’s Kalua Pork, topped with smoked free-range pork shoulder, home-
made organic mango barbecue sauce, organic red onions, Maui pineapple,
local Surfing Goat Dairy chèvre, Maui Sprout Farm scallions, premium moz-
zarella, imported Parmesan, and herbs — or design your own. Pizzas come
12- and 16-inch, while salads can be built appetizer or entree size, depend-
ing on what you dress yours with. I’ve found that a salad with a few add-
on items and a 16-inch pie is plenty for two hungry diners.
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 249

Both the room and service are colorful and very friendly, with a contem-
porary surfer-hippie vibe that’s just right for Paia. There’s a full, very com-
petent bar that makes a convivial place to sit should you have to wait a
few minutes for your table, plus an affordable list of wines by the bottle or
glass. Great for families, too. From start to finish, my new favorite spot on
Maui.

Gazebo Restaurant
$
West Maui (Napili)
Local
Tucked in the back of the Napili Shores Resort, this simple, oceanfront gem
is well worth waiting in line for. Breakfast and lunch are served simulta-
neously throughout the morning and lunch hour in a simple open-air set-
ting offering stunning views and service brimming with aloha. Happy
diners are glad to stand in line, chat, and enjoy the views while they wait
for a table and the opportunity to dig into macadamia nut pancakes
dressed with the restaurant’s own dream-worthy whipped cream and
coconut syrup; hearty omelets served with Portuguese sausage, an island
breakfast staple; island-style lunch plates starring such local favorites as
kalua pork slow-cooked in traditional luau style; and burgers and salads.
This is good, simple food made with care. The kitchen moves quickly, so
the line does, too. One of the island’s best — and one of its best dining bar-

Gerard’s
$$$$–$$$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
French
This traditionalist’s haven boasts an ultra-romantic setting that includes a
charming, slightly frilly dining room, tables on the lanai, and a lovely
garden patio. A regular winner of the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence
and named “Maui’s little French jewel” by Bon Appétit magazine, Gerard’s
offers refined cuisine that seldom disappoints, as long as you’re not paying
too much attention to price. Gerard Reversade excels at seeking out the
freshest local ingredients and preparing them in traditional Gallic style.
My favorite among the starters is the shiitake and oyster mushrooms in
puff pastry, but the foie gras terrine is a must for those who indulge. A
wealth of meat and poultry dishes is at hand (including a terrific rack of
lamb in mint crust), plus divine daily fresh fish preparations that depend
on what the boats bring in. Inventive desserts provide a memorable finale,
unless you opt for a cheese plate, served with toasted country bread and
poached pears. Service is appropriately attentive. Very expensive, but a
nice choice for special-occasion diners who prefer the classics over con-
temporary dining experiences.

Haliimaile General Store
$$$$
Upcountry Maui
Hawaii Regional
This attractive plantation-style restaurant continues to be one of the best
not only in Maui, but all of Hawaii — and my top recommendation for those
who prefer to sample top-quality island-style cooking in a refreshingly casual
and pretension-free setting. Star chef Bev Gannon, the queen of Hawaii
Regional Cuisine, presents a heartier-than-average Hawaii Regional menu
full of American home-style favorites prepared with an island spin and a few
generous dashes of fun. I love to start with the rock shrimp tempura, served
in a Chinese “to go” with popcorn (popcorn shrimp — get it?), and accom-
panied by a trio of dipping sauces that include a heavenly truffle honey. On
the main course menu, look for such signature satisfiers as succulent bar-
becued pork ribs; long-simmering coconut fish and shrimp curry; and New
Zealand rack of lamb prepared Hunan-style. No matter what you order, you
won’t be disappointed. The desserts — created by Bev’s daughter Teresa
Gannon, now a well-known chef in her own right — are better than Mom
used to make; I never miss the light and tangy lilikoi (passion fruit) tart. The
keiki menu even comes complete with kid-friendly “cocktails.” Well worth
the 45-minute drive Upcountry; Bev never disappoints. (If you’re in South
Maui, you can head to sibling restaurant Joe’s Bar & Grill for a different type
of experience; see review later in this chapter.)

Steaks/Seafood
This attractive and bustling Kaanapali restaurant features a killer beach-
front setting and a midpriced island-style steak-and-seafood menu brought
to you from the people behind Waikiki’s renowned Duke’s Canoe Club.
Kissed by the trade winds, the patio is the ideal setting for sunset watch-
ers, and Tiki torches make for after-dark magic. The wide-ranging menu
has something for everyone, including superb wood-grilled or macadamia-
crusted fresh island fish, yummy barbecued pork ribs in mango barbecue
sauce, or succulent lemon-ginger roasted chicken. Those on a budget can
stick to the bar menu, which features Merriman’s famous poke rolls (filled
with seared fresh ahi), kiawe-fired pizzas, and creative salads and sand-
wiches. Hawaiian music, hula dancing at sunset, and well-blended tropi-
cal drinks dressed up with umbrellas round out the carefree island vibe. If
you want a patio table, you should request one when you book. The more

New Pacific
You can’t get closer to the ocean than I’o’s alfresco tables, some of which
sit just feet from the surf (request one when you book). Overseen by
award-winning chef James McDonald, I’o is a multifaceted joy, with win-
ningly innovative fusion cuisine, first-rate service, and a top-notch wine
list that has won the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence. The seafood-
heavy menu features copious Pacific Rim accents, plus a few creative
twists courtesy of the Western Hemisphere: Maine lobster tails are stir-
fried and served with sweet potatoes flamed in a dark rum and mango Thai
curry sauce; the grilled lamb chop is spiced with madras curry and topped
with a pineapple demi-glace; and the fresh catch gets a crust of foie gras
for the ultimate decadence. Each dish is paired with a recommended wine
for easy ordering. Skip the silken purse appetizer, though — it’s an over-
rated signature. A full, friendly bar (including a tempting array of specialty
martinis) makes this restaurant an all-around terrific choice.

New American/Hawaii Regional
Joe’s is a little slicker than its Upcountry sibling, Haiilimaile General Store,
but serves a similarly pleasing menu of American home cooking with an
island-regional twist, this time without the strong Asian influence. Top
choices include the signature grilled applewood salmon, smoky and sub-
lime; pumpkin-seed-crusted fresh catch accompanied by chipotle honey
butter and whipped potatoes; and innovative preparations of such clas-
sics as meatloaf, rack of lamb, and center-cut pork chops. Specialty mar-
tinis are concocted behind the handcrafted 43-foot copper bar. The
wood-paneled room is casual and welcoming, rock-and-roll memorabilia
lines the walls (Joe Gannon, husband of acclaimed chef Bev Gannon, man-
aged Alice Cooper for years), and open-air views take in the tennis action
below. At night, low lighting and well-spaced tables make for a surprisingly
romantic ambience, but the room takes on a laid-back liveliness after it
fills up. The service is top-notch.

Now under the guiding hand of executive chef John Cox, the Hotel Hana

part of the island. Christened Ka’uiki, the restaurant marries fresh island
ingredients with sophisticated, contemporary preparations. Chef Cox
works closely with local farmers and fisherman in his never-ending quest
to procure the finest ingredients on Maui; the menu changes daily to reflect
what’s fresh and in season. The high-quality cuisine is a perfect match for
the simple elegance of the dining room, with gleaming hardwood floors,
well-spaced tables, and glorious ocean views. The room is graced with
original island-inspired art that includes the breathtaking Red Sails paint-
ing, with its imagery of the first Hawaiians voyaging to the islands. Come

and satisfying selection of fresh fish preparations (a good half-dozen are
available to choose from), hefty sirloins served with garlic mashed pota-
toes, and island favorites like kalua pork ribs with plum barbecue sauce.
With Caesar salads and sides included, dinners make for a very good deal,
and there’s nightly entertainment to boot. Dessert lovers should save
room for Kimo’s own Hula Pie: macadamia-nut ice cream in a chocolate-
wafer crust with fudge and whipped cream — a decadent island delight.

ratings from dining bible Zagat’s. Both locals and visitors have regularly
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 253

named it as their Maui favorite since it opened its doors in 1990 — and I’m
thrilled to report that even though David Paul’s name is no longer on the
door, it’s still as divine as ever. In actuality, David Paul hasn’t been involved
in the restaurant for nearly a decade now; chef/owner Jurg Munch contin-
ues Paul’s culinary tradition, and continues to steward the restaurant to
success.
The dining room is one of Hawaii’s prettiest. It’s stylish yet delightfully
homey, with high pressed-tin ceilings, elegantly dressed tables, golden
wood floors, vibrant original art by spirited Maui colorist Jan Kasprzycki,
and a generous bar at the center of the room that adds just the right
amount of lively bustle to the scene. The kitchen excels at distinctive fla-
vors that are bold without being overpowering. Signature dishes remain
the stars of the menu, including kalua duck, a duck confit leg bathed in
reduced plum wine sauce — rich, fork-tender, and greaseless. I’m also
wowed by the Kona coffee–roasted rack of lamb dressed in a light caber-
net demi-glace. Lahaina Grill also shines with seafood; start with the Cake
Walk, a delectable trio of Kona lobster crab cake, zesty Louisiana rock
shrimp cake, and seared ahi cake. The celestial seared ahi and foie gras
pairing with fig compote will prove that foie gras is far from passé. The
wine list is excellent, and the all-pro waitstaff offers welcome relief from
Lahaina’s usual surfer style.

and the restaurant regularly wins the annual “Best Service” and “Best
Seafood” awards from the Maui News. A half-dozen fresh catches — deliv-

you can choose the preparation you’d prefer. Your choices include à la
meunière; baked and stuffed with Alaskan king crabmeat; Provençal-style
(sautéed with olives, peppers, and tomatoes in garlic and olive oil); and
Cajun spiced. But my absolute favorite is the en Bastille, in which the fish
is “imprisoned” (get it?) in grated potato and sautéed and then crowned
with scallions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and meunière sauce — yum! Meat
and poultry are on hand for non–seafood eaters, including a well-prepared
steak Diane and slowly simmered pork osso buco. The bread comes with a
delectable beer cheese spread (how retro is that?), and your server will
prepare your Caesar salad tableside if you ask. Book a table on the lanai

Mala, An Ocean Tavern
$$$–$$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
Healthy Eclectic
The Valley Isle has applauded the return of hometown chef Mark Ellman to
the gourmet dining fold. After shutting the doors on Avalon a few years
back, Ellman focused his energy on expanding his successful Maui Tacos
Chapter 12: Settling into Maui 255

quick-service chain, and otherwise stayed out of sight. In 2006 he re-
entered full-service restaurant business with a bang. Mala means “garden”
in the Hawaiian language; it’s an apt moniker thanks to the restaurant’s
bounteous menu, which bursts with exciting choices. The menu is built
around small plates and sharing, so you can enjoy a variety of taste sen-
sations in the course of your meal. The focus is on healthy eating, so
expect whole grains and organic whenever possible. This won’t dull your
pleasure; highlights from the regular menu include a divine Kobe beef
cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon and Maytag blue cheese, a
wok-fried moi (a fish once reserved for Hawaiian royalty) sautéed in a
delectable black bean sauces, and an exotic Indonesian stir-fry with fresh
island fish. However, the real treat is the daily specials menu, where Mark
puts his creativity to full use, making the most of what’s market fresh that
day. Vegetarians will feel well cared for.
Mala boasts a delightfully casual-contemporary setting where you can feel
perfectly comfortable showing up in your shorts; with its over-the-water
location and waves crashing just below, the Tiki torch–lit lanai is one of
Maui’s most thrilling open-air dining rooms. Start your meal with a house

Mama’s Fish House
$$$$$
Central Maui

Okay, it’s true: Mama’s Fish House is slightly touristy, and you’ll have to pay
through the nose. Yet despite those caveats, Mama’s is my hands-down
favorite restaurant on Maui, and one of my all-time favorite Hawaii restau-
rants — and one of its most popular too. The Tiki-room setting is an arche-
type of timeless Hawaii cool, and fresh island fish simply doesn’t get any
better than this; it’s all caught locally, with the provenance indicated on the
menu. (“Opakapaka caught by Earle Kiawi bottom-fishing outside his home-
port of Hana Bay.”) The beach-house dining room has ambience in excess,
with lavish tropical floral arrangements, sea breezes ruffling the tapa table-
cloths, soft lighting, and gorgeous views galore. The day’s catches are the
stars of the show, and you choose from four preparations. My favorite is
the Pua Me Hua Hana, two of the day’s fresh catches steamed gently and
served traditional luau-style with purple Molokai sweet potato, baked
banana, fresh island fruit, and a fresh young coconut — plates just don’t
get prettier than this. The service is sincere if a bit serious (“And what will
the lady have?”), but, somehow, it suits the mood. A lengthy list of tropical

drinks (dressed with umbrellas, of course) completes the tropical-roman-
tic picture. A kids’ menu is on hand for families. A real island-style delight.

Central Maui (Kahului)
Latin American
Locals and visitors alike flock here from all corners of the island, drawn
by a winning indoor/outdoor setting and creative, nicely prepared Latin
American cuisine that scores on all fronts. The boldly colored decor could
be described as retro-industrial; it’s cute and fun, but the groovy patio is
the place to be. Having to pay for chips and salsa is kind of a drag, but all
is forgiven after the basket arrives with its trio of zesty “samba” salsas.
Everything just gets better from there. At lunchtime, I like the adobo bar-
becued duck and sweet-potato quesadilla, mildly spiced with delicate
green chilis, and the classic pressed Cuban sandwich. At dinner, you might
start with green tomatoes, fried just right with smoked mozzarella and sliv-
ered red onions, or zesty ceviche, made with fresh island fish. For your
main course, consider the citrus-jalapeño glazed salmon, a pepper-cumin-
rubbed New York strip steak grilled with chipotle-wine demi-glace, or the
skewered jumbo prawns glazed with pineapple rum and served with
mashed sweet potatoes. You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu;
every Pan-Latin dish sings with flavor. No wonder Rachael Ray named

ever’s fresh off the day’s boat, served on disposable dishware. But what-
ever you order, it’s bound to be fresh, well prepared, and delicious. Place
your order at the counter, then find a seat. The mahimahi fish and chips
is always lightly breaded and perfectly crisp, and the generous portion is
a bargain at $13. The charbroiled fish is always what it should be; if ono is
in season, don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy this firm and moist local
fish. Even though the house specialty is seafood, the chicken selection or
burger (also locally supplied, by the Maui Cattle Company) are also well
prepared. There’s a good beer and wine selection, too. Well worth a drive,
especially if you’re tired of resort prices.

Pizza Paradiso
$
West Maui (Honokowai, Kaanapali)
Italian
This sit-down pizzeria serves up top-quality pies that manage to wow even
skeptical New Yorkers (really!). In addition to a long list of create-your-own
traditional toppings, Pizza Paradiso also offers a variety of theme pies,
from the Maui Wowie (with ham and pineapple) to the Jimmy Hoffa (moz-
zarella buried under tons of pepperoni); pastas; fresh, bounteous salads;
and surprisingly good desserts (including a lovely homemade tiramisu).
This pizzeria is a terrific choice for bargain-hunting families or anybody
who needs a break from high-priced ahi for a while. The Kaanapali loca-
tion is an express takeout joint, but you can enjoy your pie at a table in
the adjacent Whalers Village food court. Both locations offer free delivery
in the immediate area.

The Plantation House
$$$$–$$$$$
West Maui (Kapalua)
Hawaii Regional/Mediterranean
Overlooking luxuriant golf greens and the stunning Kapalua coastline
beyond, the absolutely wonderful Plantation House may have the most
glorious setting on Maui. The open, airy, country club–style dining room
features crisp white linens, teak-wood chairs hand-carved with a pineap-
ple motif, and soft tropical colors; at night, a glowing fireplace adds to the
romance. Chef Alex Stanislaw and his team have crafted a one-of-a-kind
Asian-Mediterranean fusion menu that changes frequently to take advan-
tage of fresh seasonal produce. Expect to find dishes such as Tuscan-style
rib-eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes and goat’s milk Gorgonzola
cheese; macadamia nut and goat-cheese salad with Kula greens, Kalamata
olives, and passion fruit vinaigrette; or roasted Molokai pork tenderloin
with caramelized Maui onions. Fresh-caught island fish is the star of the
menu, with several preparations available, including the divine Rich Forest
option (the fish is pressed with bread crumbs and porcini mushroom
powder, sautéed, and nestled in garlic-braised spinach and mashed pota-
toes). Chef Alex even lends his descriptive thoughts to the impressive wine
list, one of the finest on the island. I’ve heard some complaints recently
that the service can be pretentious, but I haven’t had a problem. Book a
terrace table and come at sunset for maximum enjoyment.

Roy’s Kahana Bar & Grill/Roy’s Kihei
$$$–$$$$
West Maui (Kahana)/South Maui (Kihei)
Hawaii Regional
Roy Yamaguchi is the most famous name in Hawaii Regional Cuisine.
There’s hardly any difference between these two bustling siblings, one in
South Maui and one in West Maui. They share the same executive chef, the
same basic menu, and the same lively, sophisticated vibe. Thanks to an
oversize menu of dim sum, appetizers, and imu-baked pizzas (an imu is the
underground oven traditionally used to roast the whole pig at a luau), you
can easily eat affordably in either dining room. The daily menu revolves
around a few standards, such as sublime Szechuan baby back ribs and
blackened ahi with a delectable soy mustard butter. The service is always
attentive, even when the dinner hour is packed and buzzing, and Roy’s
well-priced private-label wines are an excellent value (though you may be
tempted to sample the outstanding private-label sakes instead).

A Saigon Cafe
$$
Central Maui (Wailuku)
Vietnamese
This family-run restaurant serves up outstanding Vietnamese cuisine that’s
worth seeking out, especially if you’re looking for a high-quality culinary
return on your dollar. The wide-ranging menu features a dozen different
soups (including a terrific lemon-grass version), a complete slate of hot
and cold noodle dishes, and numerous wok-cooked Vietnamese special-
ties starring island-grown produce and fresh-caught fish. Expect a taste
sensation no matter what you order; every authentic dish bursts with
piquant flavor. Ambience is minimal, but the quality of the food, low prices,
and caring service more than compensate.

Seafood
Both of chef D.K. Kodama’s Maui sushi palaces offer some of the best
dining on the island, especially for serious sushi lovers. Composed pri-
marily of Pan-Asian seafood dishes with multicultural touches, Sansei’s
winningly innovative menu has won raves from fans around the globe.
Entrees are available, but I recommend assembling a family-style meal
from the adventurous sushi rolls and small plates: The rock shrimp cake

sushi service, cozy up to the bar at the bustling Kihei location — you won’t
be disappointed. Even the desserts are divine at this easygoing place.
There’s late-night dining and live karaoke from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on

Stella Blues Cafe
$$–$$$
South Maui (Kihei)
New American
Stella Blues began life as a Deadhead-themed deli, but it has reinvented
itself in recent years as a stylish and sophisticated grown-up restaurant.
The rock-and-roll memorabilia still dresses the walls, but now it adds a
pleasingly funky touch to an open, airy dining room dressed in rich colors
and warm woods. There’s an open stainless-steel kitchen and a big, back-
lit bar; Tiki torches add romance to the outdoor patio after dark. But the
great thing about Stella Blues is that it’s still friendly, unpretentious, and
affordable. You’d be hard-pressed to find another restaurant in the islands
that offers this much panache and good cooking at such affordable prices.
Start your day with a hearty create-your-own omelet and then move on to
a French dip or another hefty sandwich at lunch. The place really comes
alive at dinner: Start with the delectable homemade hummus served with
hot pita, or the funky nachos (blue and yellow corn chips layered with
mahimahi, ahi, jalapeños, jack cheese, and guacamole). Choose from a
range of creative pizzas, pastas, and big plates for your main course; the
New York steak (homegrown by the Maui Cattle Company) is as good as
most that cost twice the price. Late-night dining (until midnight weekdays,
to 1:30 a.m. Fri and Sat nights) is another plus.

Tommy Bahama’s Tropical Cafe
$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
Caribbean
Housed in the Tommy Bahama’s fashion emporium at the Shops at Wailea,
this delightful restaurant perfectly embodies the tropical haberdasher’s
breezily sophisticated style. The open-air room is a mélange of bamboo,
rattan, and tropical prints that come together in a postmodern plantation
style. While the food is very well prepared, it’s too expensive — but that’s
the story of this pricey resort coast. I love Tommy Bahama’s best for cock-
tails, which are some of the island’s most creative and satisfying, or a
relaxed lunch, when the menu focuses on Caribbean-inspired sandwiches
Part IV: Maui 
260

and bounteous entree-size salads. Pleasing choices include the Habana
Cabana pulled-pork sandwich, finished with the restaurant’s own black-
berry brandy barbecue sauce; and the Aruba Arugula salad, tossed in a
tamarind vinaigrette and garnished with Caribbean-zested shrimp and
scallops. Dinner brings more substantial fare, like maple-brined and char-
grilled pork tenderloin topped with a dried berry merlot chutney, and pan-
seared sashimi-grade ahi dressed in sweet chili oil, cilantro, and lemon
grass. As good as the food is, Tommy Bahama’s Tropical Cafe is really
about soaking up the carefree mood along with a few fruity cocktails. Come
early for dinner to enjoy the gorgeous sunset views.

South Maui (Kihei) 
International Noodles
This cheerful new spot has brought welcome color, flavor, personality, and
dining value to the Kihei scene. It’s situated in a cute plantation-style cot-
tage, with most of the restaurant residing on the covered patio. Place your
order at the inside counter, take a seat, and your food will be brought to
you by an attentive waitstaff. The menu comprises an international array of
noodle bowls, from an Indonesian peanut stir-fry — freshly sautéed veg-
gies in a spiced peanut sauce with thick egg noodles, topped with cilantro
and sprouts — to a great version of the local favorite saimin, chow mein
noodles in a miso broth, topped with barbecued pork, fried Spam (an island
favorite, and tastier than you’d think), fish cake, and boiled egg. I also like
the Maui fried rice, a local version of the classic with sweet onion and island

Going for a post-Haleakala-sunrise
breakfast
Rising at 3 a.m. and driving two hours Upcountry to catch the glorious sunrise from
atop Haleakala crater is one of Maui’s most popular experiences (see Chapter 13).
Another treat comes after, in the form of a hearty breakfast at the base of the moun-
tain in the tiny town of Kula, which you’ll pass through on your way back to the beach.
Kula Sandalwoods Cafe, 15427 Haleakala Highway ($; Highway 377; % 808-878-3523;

Luau!
Maui is Hawaii’s hands-down winner in the luau department. If you’re
going to attend just one, do it on this island.
Reservations are required for both luau listed in this section. Make
reservations as far in advance as possible — preferably before you leave
home — because all these first-rate beach parties are often fully booked
a full week or more ahead of time, sometimes two.
Don’t give up if you’re trying to make last-minute plans, though; it never
hurts to call and ask whether any spots have opened up due to cancella-
tions. Also, if you’re booking at the last minute or you want more island
luau to choose from, check with Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 888-222-3601;
www.tombarefoot.com), a very reliable Maui-based activities center
that can hook you up with a number of other luau on Maui, and, some-
times, even save you a few bucks in the process.
The Feast at Lele
Here’s a winning new concept in luau, and it’s ideal for those who don’t
mind paying more for a more intimate oceanfront setting and a private
table. Here you’ll enjoy an excellent five-course meal, prepared by a skilled
chef and served at your own table. You’ll experience a lovely flower-lei
greeting, but no traditional imu ceremony or craft demonstrations, like at
the Old Lahaina Luau. The performance troupe is smaller than Old
Lahaina’s, but it’s held to the same exacting standards. This feast cele-
brates not only Hawaii but three more Polynesian islands: Tonga, Tahiti,
and Samoa. Each course is dedicated to an island culture, composed of
gourmet versions of foods from the native cuisine, followed by a native
song and dance performance.
Although the Feast at Lele welcomes all visitors, it tends to cater to a more
sophisticated, kid-free, grown-up crowd than most luau, making it an ideal
choice for romance-seeking couples or anyone wanting a more refined
experience. A full wine list and tropical cocktail menu are on hand in addi-
tion to the included well cocktails, and you can expect your two dedicated
servers to be friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.

Old Lahaina Luau
Old Lahaina Luau is Hawaii’s must authentic and acclaimed luau, and my
absolute favorite. The oceanfront luau grounds provide a stunning setting,
both the luau feast and riveting entertainment serve as a wonderful intro-
duction to genuine island culture, and the staff exudes aloha. When you
book, choose between Hawaiian-style seating, on mats and cushions set
at low tables at the foot of the stage, or traditional seating, at generously
proportioned common tables with comfortable wooden chairs.
You’ll be welcomed with a fresh flower lei and greeted with a tropical cock-
tail. Arrive early so that you’ll have plenty of time to stroll the grounds,
watching craftspeople at work and taking in the gorgeous views. After
dinner, the excellent show features authentic hula and traditional chants
accompanied by an intelligent narrative charting the history of Hawaii
from the first islanders to modern day. Don’t mistake this show for a
deadly dull history lesson; it’s compelling entertainment, and both the
male and the female dancers are first-rate performers. (Don’t expect fire
dancers, though, because ancient Hawaiians didn’t play with fire.) It’s well
worth the money, and is a joy from start to finish — an excellent choice for
families, groups, and couples alike.

 Scoping out the shopping scene
 Enjoying Maui’s lively island nightlife
M
aui is much like a smorgasbord: Even if you have no intention of
sampling everything it has to offer, you’ll be wowed by the bounty
of choice — and your plate is bound to be full well before you satisfy all
of your cravings.
This action-packed island has something for everyone — and then some —
so staying active and happy will not be a problem on Maui. Your biggest
dilemma will likely be just trying to fit everything you want to see and do
into your vacation calendar. Just remember: It’s equally important to
reserve a big chunk of time for lying on the sands and doing nothing at all!
Check with the excellent Maui-based activity center Tom Barefoot’s
Tours, 250 Alamaha St. (at Wakea Street, south of the Hana Highway),
Kahului (% 800-621-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com),
which may be able to save you a few valuable dollars on many of Maui’s
activities on land and sea. You’re welcome to visit the store, but you
don’t have to; all business can be conducted over the phone or online,
even before you arrive in the islands (which I recommend to ensure that
you don’t miss out on an activity that matters to you).
Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Maui wouldn’t be such a glamour girl without its breathtaking array of
beaches. All of Maui’s fabulous beaches (even those that front exclusive
resorts) are open to the public. Although resorts may restrict certain
areas of private property for their guests’ use only, most hotels welcome
nonguests to their facilities. Though they frown on visitors using the
beach chairs reserved for guests, they’re generally happy to rent you
beach gear or sell you refreshments.

Combing the beaches
Never leave valuables in your rental car while you’re at the beach.
Knowledgeable thieves like to prey on tourists, and they know how to
get into your interior, trunk, and glove box in no time flat. Be especially
diligent about leaving your stuff behind at your condo or in your hotel
safe when you’re heading off to a remote beach.
Also, when it comes to safe swimming conditions, do your homework:
Check out the following beach descriptions and, after you’re on Maui,
make inquiries about local surf conditions. At beaches without life-
guards, keep an eye out for posted signs warning of dangerous currents
or conditions. If you see a red flag hoisted at any beach, don’t venture
into the water; the flag indicates that conditions are unsafe for swim-
mers. Even if the waves look placid, trust the warning. And never turn
your back on the ocean; big waves can come out of nowhere in a matter
of minutes.
In West Maui
These fine beaches are easily accessible from the Honoapiilani Highway,
which connects the island’s commercial heart, Kahului, to Lahaina,
Kaanapali, and Kapalua. Each one offers excellent opportunities for
whale-watching in humpback season.
Honolua/Mokuleia Bay Marine Life Conservation District
Snorkelers love this gorgeous cove for its smooth surf, clear waters (which
are protected as a marine-life conservation district), excellent coral for-
mations, and abundance of tropical fish, especially on the west side of the
bay. The beige-sand crescent is lovely, and never too crowded, but there
are no facilities. In winter, stay out of the water; come instead to watch
daredevil surfers ride some of the finest breaks in the islands.
See map p. 268. At the northernmost end of Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30),
about 2 miles past Office Road (the turnoff for Kapalua); park with the other cars in
the available spaces or along the roadside and walk 200 yards down the stairs and
to the beach.
Kapalua Beach
This gorgeous golden crescent bordered by two palm-studded points is
justifiably popular for sunbathing, swimming, and snorkeling. The sandy
bottom slopes gently to deep water that’s so clear you can see where 
the gold sands turn to green, and then deep blue. Well-protected from
strong winds and currents, Kapalua’s calm waters are usually great for
swimmers of all ages and abilities year-round, and waves come in just right
for easy riding. The rocky points offer good fish-communing opportunities
for both snorkelers and offshore divers. The beach is also great for off-
shore whale-watching in winter, too. The inland side of the beach is edged
by a shady path and cool lawns. Facilities include indoor and outdoor

showers, restrooms, and a rental shack. The small parking lot is limited to
about 30 spaces, so arrive early.
See map p. 268. On Lower Honoapiilani Road at the south end of Kapalua, just before
the Napili Kai Beach Club. To get there: From Honoapiilani Highway, turn left just past
mile marker 30, go 3⁄4 mile to Lower Honoapiilani Road; turn left and go 3⁄4 mile to the
access point.
Kaanapali Beach
Maui’s first resort developers were drawn to build on this beach for a good
reason: It’s absolutely fabulous. Hotels and condos (almost approaching
the density of Waikiki) now line Kaanapali’s 4 miles of grainy, gold sand,
but the not-too-wide beach tends to be populated only in pockets; you can
usually find an uncrowded area to spread out your towel even when the
hotels are at capacity. Swimming and wave jumping are excellent, but
beware of the rough winter shore-break (where the waves break on the
shore), which can really kick up.
At the beach’s north end, in front of the Sheraton, is Black Rock, the best
offshore snorkel spot on Maui. The water is clear, the area is well-protected
from rough surf (most of the time), and the clouds of tropical fish are used
to finned folks. Well worth seeking out; mornings tend to be calmest and
clearest.
A paved beach walk links the hotels and the open-air Whalers Village shop-
ping and dining complex — a great place to cure the midday munchies or
sip a tropical cocktail while scanning for whales or watching the sun set
over the Pacific. Lifeguards and beach boys from the resorts man the
beach, beach-gear rental shacks are set up right on the sand, and most
hotels have outdoor showers (and sometimes restrooms) you can use;
restrooms are also available at Whalers Village.
The only downside is that parking is difficult for those who are not stay-
ing in the area. Whalers Village has a paid lot, but beachgoers are dis-
couraged from using it by a “No Beach Parking” sign; if you do, be sure not
to be unloading a giant cooler, beach umbrella, or set of chairs from your
car, and be sure to buy lunch (or at least some sunscreen) from one of the
vendors in the center to count as a shopper. Park with care here, lest you
be towed. Another alternative is to pay to park as a visitor at one of the
resorts, and do so legitimately by starting your day with a meal there.
There is a small free parking lot for public beach access in the Sheraton
Maui’s parking structure. Follow the main resort road down to the north
end; the entrance is right before the main entrance to the resort itself,
on the lower level of the structure at its south end (nearest to the
Kaanapali Beach Hotel). Look for the sign that says “Beach Access
Parking,” park and follow the beach access path between the Kaanapali
Beach Hotel and the Sheraton. The lot is open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
come early to snare your spot in this tiny lot.
See map p. 268. Kaanapali Parkway, off Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30),
Kaanapali.
Part IV: Maui 
270

Along the South Maui Coast
These fabulous beaches are located along Maui’s sunny southwest-
facing shore, where you find the resort areas of Kihei and Wailea.
Kamaole III Beach Park
Three popular beach parks — Kamaole I, II, and III — face the waves across
from South Kihei Road in mid-Kihei. The biggest and best is Kamaole III (or
Kam-3, as the locals call it), which boasts a playground and a grassy lawn
that meets the finely textured golden sand. Swimming is generally safe, but
parents should make sure that little ones don’t venture too far out because
the bottom slopes off quickly. Families may prefer the grassy end of the
beach with shade trees, where the ocean bottom has a fairly gentle slope.
Both the north and south ends have rocky fingers that are great for snorkel-
ers, and the winter waves attract bodysurfers. This west-facing beach is
also an ideal spot to watch the sun go down or look for whales offshore in
winter. Facilities include restrooms, showers, picnic tables, barbecues, vol-
leyball nets, and lifeguards. Food and beach-gear rentals are available at
the malls across the street, but be careful crossing busy Kihei Road!
See map p. 268. On South Kihei Road just south of Keonekai Street (across from the
Maui Parkshore and Kamaole Sands condos), Kihei.
Mokapu and Ulua Beach Parks
Situated at the north end of Wailea, these lovely side-by-side sister beaches
boast pretty golden sand, good grassy areas for sandless picnicking, and
nice facilities, including restrooms and a freshwater shower pole. The
ocean bottom is shallow and gently slopes down to deeper waters, making
swimming generally safe; snorkelers will find Wailea’s best snorkeling at
the rocky north end. When the surf kicks up, the waves are excellent for
bodysurfers. Although these gems are popular with the nearby upscale
condo crowd, the sand rarely gets too crowded; the parking lot is tiny,
though, so come early.
See map p. 268. On Wailea Alanui Road at Hale Alii Place, between the Wailea
Marriott to the south and the Wailea Ekahi Village condos to the north (directly across
from the Palms at Wailea condos), Wailea.
Wailea Beach
The ultrafine gold-sand beach is big, wide, and protected on both sides by
black lava points with a sandy and sloping bottom, making the clear waters
excellent for swimming (and okay for snorkeling too). The year-round
waves are just right for easy board riding or bodysurfing, but trade winds
can kick up in the afternoon, so come early. The view out to sea is gor-
geous, with the islands of Kahoolawe and Lanai framing the view; this
beach is an ideal spot to watch for humpback whales in winter. This
stretch of shoreline may feel like it belongs to the ultradeluxe resorts that
line it, but it doesn’t; just look for the blue “Shoreline Access” signs for
easiest access. Restrooms and showers are available.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 271

See map p. 268. Fronting the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons resorts, Wailea. To get
there: The blue “Shoreline Access” sign is between the 2 resorts on Wailea Alanui
Drive.
Maluaka (Makena) Beach
This wonderful beach park fronting the Maui Prince Hotel offers a pleas-
ing off-the-beaten-path experience for those in search of a first-rate snorkel
experience, or for anybody who wants a break from Maui’s ever-present
crowds. Short, wide, and palm-fringed, this unspoiled crescent of golden,
grainy sand is set between two protective lava points and bounded by big,
grassy sand dunes. Snorkelers will find surprisingly colorful coral and an
impressive array of vibrantly hued reef fish at the rocky south end of the
beach, past the lava point. Sunbathers and casual swimmers will want to
stick to the beautiful strand closer to the hotel, which is virtually empty
on weekdays. Facilities include restrooms and showers.
See map p. 268. Makena Road, Makena (south of Wailea). To get there: Follow Wailea
Alanui Drive south through Wailea to Makena (where it becomes Makena Alanui
Road); go past the Maui Prince Hotel, turn right on Makena Road (where it wraps
around) and look for the “Shoreline Access” sign near the hotel for public access
parking.
Oneloa Beach (Big Beach)
Oneloa means “long sand” in Hawaiian, and locals call it Big Beach. It
comes by its name honestly — this gorgeous crescent of white sand is
3,300 feet long and more than 100 feet wide. Oneloa is a beautiful spot for
swimming, sunbathing, surfing, body or boogie boarding, or just hanging
out for the day, strolling along the picture-perfect shoreline. And, true to
its nickname, Oneloa is so big that even when it’s crowded it doesn’t feel
crowded — so bring your beach chair and plan to stay a while, playing in
the gorgeous surf and light waves. Snorkeling is a bit better down the road,
but you’ll find decent fish-watching near the north. In winter storm season,
beware of fierce waves and a strong rip current that sweeps the sharp
drop-off. The area has no facilities except portable toilets, but plenty of
parking is available. Well worth seeking out for a picture-perfect Maui day.
See map p. 268. Off Makena Road, 11⁄3 miles south of the Maui Prince Hotel. To get
there: Drive past the Maui Prince Hotel 11⁄3 miles, where a paved road leads to the
parking lot and beach. A second parking lot is available just to the north.
The Dumps
It’s not a sexy name, I know, but the Dumps makes a great spot for serious
snorkelers in search of an off-the-beaten-path experience. This locals’
favorite is part of the Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve. The Dumps isn’t
a beach, really; just an exposed cove with a bit of black sand, lots of lava
rock, and a wealth of mature coral offering some very good snorkeling
when the winds are down and the turquoise water is clear.
Part IV: Maui 
272

Only confident swimmers should explore the Dumps, and then only
early in the day, when winds are down and visibility is best. Don’t get in
the water if the winds are kicking or there’s rough surge near the shore-
line (folks have been known to be blown out to sea on windy days). Also,
be sure to wear reef shoes or other sturdy foot covering for your walk
out to the shoreline.
See map p. 268. Off Makena Road, just south of Ahihi Cove, just before the lava fields
begin; park along the roadside.
Central and East Maui
These glorious sands are accessible from the Hana Highway, which runs
along the island’s lush north shore.
Baldwin Beach Park
Despite the beauty of this gorgeous north shore beach park — a long
ribbon of powdery white sands backed by swaying palms and fringed by
white-crested turquoise waves — it’s not usually crowded, except on week-
ends when local families come. The beach stretches for a good mile, so it
has plenty of room for everybody, especially because only locals and
intrepid visitors generally end up here. This is a terrific spot for swimmers
and body boarders, because the water is silky, warm, and gorgeous. But be
careful before venturing into the water and always heed the lifeguard,
because the undercurrent can be strong at times — and it’s best to stay out
of the water altogether in the rough winter months. The winter water’s not
for inexperienced swimmers — but everybody can enjoy the beautiful set-
ting at any time of the year. Facilities include restrooms and showers.
See map p. 268. On the Hana Highway (Highway 36), just east of Paia.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 273
Beach Eats
Hanging out at a perfect spot like Oneloa all day can sure make a vacationer hungry.
If you find yourself in such a state, head south on Makena Road just a bit to Makena
Grill, a simple lunch cart on the inland side of the road serving up fantastic fish tacos
with pineapple salsa, beautifully wood-grilled chicken and beef kabobs dressed in a
pineapple-teriyaki glaze, and one or two other lunch plates, depending on what’s fresh
and available. The proprietor is a bit Soup Nazi-ish, but her food is great — suppos-
edly, Tony Hawk calls this the best food on Maui. I don’t know if I’d go that far, but it’s
sure good. There’s a small but pleasant picnic area where you can enjoy your eats.
Makena Grill is usually open daily from 11 a.m. to “4ish” — but it’s just a lady with a
cart and a few propane tanks, so don’t blame me if she’s decided to take the day off.

Hookipa Beach Park
Possibly the most famous windsurfing beach in the world, this small, gold-
sand beach at the foot of a grassy cliff attracts top windsurfers and wave
jumpers from around the globe with hard, constant winds and endless
waves that result in near-perfect wave-riding conditions. Come on weekday
afternoons (surfers ride the waves until noon) to watch the local experts
fly over the waves with their colorful sails; winter weekends host regular
competitions. When the winter waves die down, snorkelers and divers
explore the reef. Even then, you should be extremely careful because these
waters are rough year-round; summer mornings are best. Facilities include
some rustic restrooms and showers, plus pavilions, picnic tables, and bar-
becues. The lower parking lot is generally reserved for windsurfers and
their equipment, so park in the upper lot (see the following directions),
where the high, grassy bluff offers a better perch for watching the action,
anyway.
See map p. 268. Off Hana Highway (Highway 36), 2 miles east of Paia, about 6 miles
east of Haleakala Highway (Highway 37). To get there: Drive past the park and turn
left at the entrance at the far side of the beach, at the “Hookipa Lookout” sign.
Hamoa Beach
This remote, half-moon-shaped beach near the end of the Hana Highway
is one of the most breathtakingly lovely beaches in all Hawaii, celebrated
in writing by no less than James Michener for its singular beauty. The Hotel
Hana-Maui likes to maintain the beach as its own, but it has to share; so
feel free to march right down the steps from the lava-rock lookout point
and stake out a spot on the open sand. Even if you don’t want to swim or
sunbathe, come to peek at this stunner from above: You’ll find surf that’s
the perfect color of turquoise, golden-gray sand, and luxuriant green hills
serving as the postcard-perfect backdrop. The beach is generally good for
swimming and wave riding in the gentle seasons, but stick close to the
shore because this is open, unprotected ocean; in winter, staying out of
the water entirely is best. The hotel maintains minimal facilities for
nonguests, including a restroom.
See map p. 268. Off the Hana Highway (Highway 36), about 2 1⁄2 miles past Hana town.
To get there: Turn at the small white sign that says “Hamoa Beach” and go about 11⁄2
miles to the lava-rock lookout point; you can park on the roadside or in the dirt area
across the street. The stairs are just beyond the lookout point (if you reach the steep
service road to the beach, you’ve gone too far).
Playing in the surf
If your hotel or condo doesn’t provide beach gear or beach toys, you
won’t have a problem finding a place to rent these items. In addition to
top-quality snorkel gear, Snorkel Bob rents boogie boards, beach chairs,
and umbrellas at its three Maui stores (see the following section,
“Snorkeling”), and rental shacks on popular beaches like Kaanapali and
Kapalua can rent you whatever you need while you’re there.
Part IV: Maui 
274

Snorkeling
Maui is justifiably famous for its snorkel cruises to Molokini and Lanai (see
the following section), both of which offer first-class fish spotting — some
of the best in the state. But anybody who’s already perused the “Combing
the beaches” section, earlier in this chapter, knows that the island offers a
wealth of terrific snorkel spots that are accessible from shore. Probably the
best of these is Black Rock at the north end of Kaanapali Beach. Also
excellent are Honolua Bay, north of Kapalua; Mokapu and Ulua Beaches,
in Wailea; and one of my lesser known favorites, Maluaka (sometimes
called Makena) Beach, south of Wailea in Makena. Additionally, many of
the island’s hotels and condo complexes sit on coves that are excellent for
snorkeling — and not just the superexpensive ones. The affordable Mana
Kai Maui in Kihei, for example, fronts a gem of a snorkeling area. Your hotel
staff is sure to have nearby recommendations.
If you want to take advantage of Maui’s offshore snorkeling opportunities,
you’ll likely need to rent some gear. My favorite rental-gear supplier in
Hawaii is Snorkel Bob’s; it rents the best-quality gear, with friendly service
and a refreshing dose of snarky good humor thrown in for good measure.
Snorkel Bob’s maintains four Maui locations, with two in West Maui. One is
at Dickenson Square, at the corner of Dickenson and Wainee streets in
Lahaina town (% 808-662-0104). There’s another West Maui store almost
to Kapalua in Napili Village, 5425 Lower Honoapiilani Hwy. (% 808-
669-9603). In South Maui, you’ll find Bob’s at the Kamaole Beach Center at
Kihei Marketplace, 2411 S. Kihei Rd., between Rainbow Mall and Dolphin
Plaza, across from Kamaole I Beach Park and not too far from Wailea 
(% 808-879-7449). In North Kihei, there’s yet another store at Azeka 
Place 2, 1279 S. Kihei Rd. (% 808-875-6188). The best-quality gear — the
“Ultimate Truth” — rents for $8 a day, or $32 a week ($22 per week for kids)
for the mask/snorkel/fins set. For $12 more, near-sighted snorkelers can
opt for prescription masks (including snorkel and fins set). Budget travel-
ers can rent basic gear for just $9 per week. You don’t need to reserve 
gear in advance, but you’re welcome to book your gear over the phone at
% 800-262-7725 or online at www.snorkelbob.com. The shops are open
daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Safety is key when snorkeling. See “Ocean Safety,” in the Quick
Concierge at the end of this book, for general snorkeling tips. On Maui,
make mornings your offshore snorkel time because the winds often start
to kick up around noon, making surf conditions rougher and less con-
ducive to fish spying.
Ocean cruising to Molokini and Lanai and other on-deck
adventures
Maui boasts two top day-cruising destinations: the sunken offshore
crater Molokini, which is hugely popular among snorkelers and divers;
and the island of Lanai, terrific for snorkelers and sunbathers alike.
(Note that only Trilogy and Paragon take their guests onshore at Lanai;
other operators just anchor offshore for snorkeling in the surrounding
waters.) Although both options offer excellent snorkeling opportunities,
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 275

I recommend prioritizing a Lanai cruise in whale-watching season (from
mid-Dec through Apr), because the channel that separates Maui from
Lanai is a favorite hangout for wintering humpback whales.
Dramamine or nausea-prevention wristbands are an excellent idea if
you’re prone to seasickness. Very important: If you opt for Dramamine,
be sure to take it with plenty of time for it to work, including before the
boat gears up for the return trip to Maui. After the return sail is under-
way, it’s too late for the drug to do any good.
The outfitters listed in this section hardly scratch the surface of the glut
of cruise operators that sail from Maui. I consider these to be the best. If
you want additional options, contact the island’s most reliable activity
center, Tom Barefoot’s Tours, 250 Alamaha St. (at Wakea Street, south of
the Hana Highway), Kahului (% 888-222-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tom
barefoot.com), which can also save you a few bucks by booking you
with some of the operators that I list.
All the sail-snorkel cruises I recommend are family-friendly, but Trilogy
boasts the kid-friendliest crew of them all.
Blue Water Rafting
Blue Water’s cruises are distinct for four reasons. First, this outfit takes
small groups of guests (no more than 24) out on fast-flying, rigid-hulled
inflatable boats for an exciting ride. Second, its Molokini Express cruises
arrive at Molokini in between the big boats’ trips, so passengers have the
perpetually overpopular crater largely to themselves. Third, the speed and
maneuverability of its boats allow Blue Water to take you to South Maui’s
otherwise untouristed Kanaio Coast beyond Makena, where you’ll visit sea
caves and snorkel in pristine areas favored by sea turtles and spinner dol-
phins on both Kanaio-only and Molokini-combination tours. And last, the
low-to-the-water boats put you as close as possible to turtles and dolphins,
as well as humpback whales in winter. This cruise is an excellent choice for
adventure seekers in search of something different.
Cruises depart from Kihei Boat Landing, on South Kihei Road just south of Kamaole
III Beach Park (between Keonekai Street and Kilohana Drive), Kihei. % 808-879-7238.
www.bluewaterrafting.com. 2- to 51⁄2-hour raft cruises: $55–$119 adults,
$45–$99 kids under 12. Prices include deli lunch, plus continental breakfast on the
51⁄2-hour tour.
Maui Classic Charters
This company can offer you Molokini snorkel-sail experiences on two great
boats: The Four Winds II, a modern 55-foot, 149-person–capacity catama-
ran featuring a glass-bottom hull for on-ship viewing, a water slide and
three swim ladders, and barbecues; and the Maui Magic, a superfast state-
of-the-art 54-foot, 71-passenger power catamaran with similarly cool fea-
tures in a more intimate environment. The Maui Magic cruises also include
some dolphin spotting on most trips. A naturalist accompanies the whale-
watching trips in season.
Part IV: Maui

Cruises depart from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea.

barbecue lunch on longer cruises; beer, wine, and soda on all cruises. 15 percent
online 7-day-advance-booking discount available at press time.
Pacific Whale Foundation Eco-Adventures
If you consider yourself to be ecologically minded, you can’t do better than
to give your snorkel-cruise dollars to the Pacific Whale Foundation. This
nonprofit organization has been at the forefront of Maui-based whale
research, education, and conservation since the 1970s, and it also happens
to host very fine cruises. Its first-rate modern catamaran fleet offers some
of the best tours of Molokini and offshore Lanai. Its 51⁄2-hour Lanai snorkel-
sail takes in the island’s less visited bays and includes a search for wild dol-
phins in its regular itinerary. The five-hour Molokai trip is as fine as any and
includes a visit to a second snorkel spot, Turtle Arches. Not only is a natu-
ralist (at least one) always onboard, but the entire crew is knowledgeable,
eco-conscious, and friendly; the boats (each of which carries 100 people
maximum) even burn eco-friendly fuel. What’s more, the cruises are great
for beginning snorkelers because guides lead fish talks and reef tours, and
a wide variety of flotation devices are available. The winter whale-watching
cruises are unparalleled, of course. You can’t go wrong with these folks.
Departures from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea, and
Lahaina Harbor, on Front Street, Lahaina, depending on cruise. % 800-942-5311 or
808-249-8811. www.pacificwhale.org. Cruises: $50–$110 adults, $40–$70 kids
3–12. Kids age 2 and under sail free, except on dinner cruise. Some cruises include
continental breakfast and/or deli lunch.
Paragon Sailing Charters
Paragon is most notable for its state-of-the-art, high-performance catama-
rans, intimate gatherings (only 24–38 passengers, depending on the trip),
and landing rights at Manele Bay, which give its Lanai trip a special edge.
(Trilogy is the only other outfitter that lands on Lanai, and the only one
that will take you on a tour of the island.) This quality outfitter is a nice
choice if you want to embark on a Molokini cruise, an easy afternoon
snorkel cruise, or a champagne sunset sail from Lahaina, too.
Departures from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea, and
Lahaina Harbor, on Front Street, Lahaina, depending on cruise. % 800-441-2087 or
808-244-2087. www.sailmaui.com. Cruises (which include drinks and hors d’oeu-
vres or full meals, depending on the outing you choose): $55–$154 adults, $28–$104
kids ages 4–12. Usually free for children 3 and under, but $20 fee applies to some
cruises. 15 percent online advance-booking discount available at press time.
Trilogy Excursions
Book these trips in advance because Trilogy (the Mercedes of Maui
snorkel-sail operators) offers the island’s most popular snorkel-sail trips,
hands down. They’re the most expensive, too, but the quality is high. The
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 277

trips feature first-rate catamarans, top-quality equipment, great food, and
the best crew in the business. What’s more, Trilogy is the only Lanai cruise
operator other than Paragon (above) that’s allowed to land on the island’s
Hulopoe Beach, a terrific marine preserve that’s one of the best snorkel
and dolphin-watching spots in Hawaii, for a fun-filled day of sailing and
snorkeling. It’s also the only operator that can offer a ground tour of the
island (as part of the deluxe “Ultimate Seafari”). Certainly a quality expe-
rience, but I’ve heard some complaints recently that Trilogy has become
a little too slick and commercial for some tastes; book with a smaller oper-
ator, like Paragon, if you want a more intimate experience.
Departures from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea; Lahaina
Harbor, on Front Street, Lahaina; or Kaanapali Beach, Kaanapali, depending on
cruise. % 888-225-6284 or 808-874-5649. www.sailtrilogy.com. Full-day Lanai
cruises: $208 adults, $104 kids 3–15, including barbecue lunch and island tour. (Deluxe
“Ultimate Seafari” version with Jeep safari and champagne return sail: $219 adults,
$110 kids.) Half-day Molokini or Kaanapali cruise: $121 adults, $61 kids. Scuba add-
ons available. Shorter Kaanapali sunset cruise: $65 adults, $33 kids; 2-hour Kaanapali
whale-watching cruise: $43 adults, $22 kids. 10 percent online-only 7-day advance-
booking discount available at press time.
Delving into the deep: Submarine rides
There’s a way to see Maui’s spectacular underwater world even if you
don’t swim: Take a submarine ride with Atlantis Adventures Maui
(% 800-548-6262 or 808-667-6604; www.goatlantis.com). From Lahaina
Harbor, you’ll go 125 feet beneath the surface in one of Atlantis’s state-
of-the-art subs to see a whole new world of sea critters, including — if
you’re lucky — humpback whales in season. The 90-minute tours cost
$84 for adults, $42 for kids (children must be at least 36 inches tall). A
word of warning: The ride is perfectly safe, but skip it if you suffer from
serious claustrophobia. You can also bypass this expensive adventure if
you have even the most basic swimming skills — just don a mask and
snorkel and hit the waves yourself instead for a primo (and much more
affordable) underwater experience.
At press time, Atlantis Adventures was offering a 10 percent discount for
online bookings.
Ocean kayaking
My favorite kayaking trips are offered by Maui Eco Tours (% 808-
891-2223; www.mauiecotours.com), which offers a range of wonderful
guided kayak tours for both beginning and more experienced kayakers
and snorkelers. I’ve found their guides to be some of the best out there;
ours got in the water with us at snorkel time and knowledgably narrated
our underwater tour for a genuinely rich experience, rather than just
leaving us to our own devices to look-see. The three-hour Discovery
tour, which departs from South Maui’s Makena Landing, is ideal for first-
time kayakers and first-time-to-Maui kayakers alike; it’s $74 for adults
Part IV: Maui 
278

and $37 for kids under 12; there’s also an advanced adults-only Makena-
area tour called the Xplorer for $84 per person. Summer visitors might
consider the terrific Escapade trip, which explores gorgeous Honolua Bay
in Kapalua; this adults-only trip is $89 per person. Whale-watching trips are
also offered in winter — and there’s no getting closer to the magnificent
mammoths than on a kayak. Check online for Web specials and on-sale
dates, which can save you as much as 25 percent.
Another good kayaking outfitter for beginners and accomplished kayak-
ers alike is South Pacific Kayaks & Outfitters (% 800-776-2326 or
808-875-4848; www.southpacifickayaks.com). South Pacific offers a
range of kayak tours that launch from both South and West Maui and
incorporate whale-watching in winter. The excellent guides are all very
knowledgeable and ecology minded. What’s more, both single and
double kayaks are available, which is not always the case when you take
a guided tour (doubles are most common); let them know your prefer-
ence when you book. Tour prices run from $65 to $139 per person, with
custom options available.
If you’re an experienced kayaker capable of setting out on your own,
South Pacific can rent you single or double kayaks for $40 or $60 a day,
respectively. They’ll meet you at Makena Landing in South Maui at 7
a.m., and be there at noon to pick your kayak back up from you; call at
least a day in advance to reserve. Weekly rates and islandwide delivery
(for an additional charge) are also available.
Winter whale-watching
More than any other Hawaiian island, Maui is your best perch for spot-
ting Pacific humpback whales in winter. Virtually every boat that oper-
ates from Maui combines whale-watching with their regular adventures
from December through April, and a good number offer dedicated whale-
watching cruises in season, most notably the Pacific Whale Foundation.
(See the section “Ocean cruising to Molokini and Lanai and other on-
deck adventures,” earlier in this chapter.) The channel separating Maui
from Lanai and Molokai is a whale-watching hot spot, so Lanai cruises, in
particular, are always an excellent bet.
You don’t have to shell out the bucks for a pricey cruise to see whales.
In season, you can spot them right from shore. Just look out to sea; just
about any west-facing beach offers you a prime whale-watching opportu-
nity. Follow these tips to increase your humpback-spotting chances:
 After you see a whale, keep watching in the same vicinity. They
often stay down for 20 minutes or so and then pop back up to take
in some air and play a little. Be patient, and you’re likely to be
rewarded.
 Bring your binoculars from home. You’ll see so much more with a
little magnification.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 279

 Anywhere along the West Maui coast is a good bet for whale-
watching. A great place to park yourself is MacGregor Point Scenic
Overlook, a scenic lookout at mile marker 9 on the Honoapiilani
Highway (Highway 30), on the way to Lahaina from Maalaea.
Another good West Maui whale-watching perch is the straight part
of Honoapiilani Highway between MacGregor Point and Olowalu.
However, do yourself — and everybody else — a favor and pull
over to the side of the road before you look out to sea, because
whale-spotting along here has caused more than a few accidents.
The nonprofit Pacific Whale Foundation (see the section “Ocean cruising
to Molokini and Lanai and other on-deck adventures,” earlier in this
chapter) operates a Whale Information Station at MacGregor Point
that’s staffed by friendly and knowledgeable whale-expert naturalists,
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. from December through April. Just stop
by — they even have high-powered binoculars you can use and they’re
happy to share whale-watching tips and facts galore. And it’s all free. Call
% 800-WHALE-1-1 (800-942-5311) or 808-249-8811 or visit www.pacific
whale.org for further details.
Catching a wave
Book your surfing or windsurfing lesson (the upcoming sections give
you more information on how to do that) for early in your stay. That
way, if conditions aren’t right on your scheduled day, you’ll have plenty
of time to reschedule.
Learning to surf
If you’ve always wanted to learn to surf, Maui is a great place to fulfill the
dream because it’s known for having the easiest learning surf in Hawaii.
The motto at the Nancy C. Emerson School of Surfing (% 808-244-7873;
www.mauisurfclinics.com) is “If a dog can surf, so can you!” A pro
international surfing champ, an instructor since 1973, a stunt performer
in movies like Waterworld, and a surf teacher to such celebs as Kiefer
Sutherland and Beau Bridges, Nancy has pioneered the technique of
teaching completely unskilled folks to surf in one two-hour lesson. You
can, really — I’ve seen it happen firsthand. The instructors are profes-
sional and personable; you’ll probably have your lesson on the beach
behind 505 Front St. in Lahaina, where the surf breaks are big enough to
learn on but not overwhelming. A beginning lesson starts at $110 per
person for a one-hour private lesson, $95 per person for two hours with a
group; I recommend going for the group option. Experienced surfers can
take full- and multiday private lessons and group clinics with Nancy’s
skilled instructors (or Nancy herself, whose time is worth top dollar;
check the Web site or call for rate schedules).
Action Sports Surf School (% 808-871-5857; www.actionsports
maui.com), with one location near the Kahului airport and one in Kihei,
offers everything from kiddie lessons to extreme tow-in and strap surfing
lessons for experienced board riders; beginning lessons start at a very
reasonable $69 for a two-hour lesson.
Part IV: Maui 
280

For experienced surfers only
Expert surfers visit Maui in winter when the surf’s really up. The best
surfing beaches include Honolua Bay, north of Kapalua; Maalaea, just
outside the breakwall of the Maalaea Harbor; and Hookipa Beach
Park in Paia, where surfers get the waves until noon, when the wind-
surfers take over. If you have a bit of experience but don’t want a seri-
ous challenge, head to the 505 Front Street Beach, next to Lahaina
Harbor in Lahaina, where even long-surfing locals regularly catch the
easy waves.
Second Wind Sail & Surf, 111 Hana Hwy. (between Dairy Road and
Hobron Avenue), Kahului (% 800-936-7787 or 808-877-7467; www.
secondwindmaui.com), has the best fleet of rental boards on the island
($20 per day, or $110 for a week), and friendly service to boot.
For daily reports on wind and surf conditions, call the Wind and Surf
Report at % 808-877-3611.
Windsurfing and kiteboarding
Expert windsurfers will want to head to Paia’s world-famous Hookipa
Beach, known all over the globe for its brisk winds and excellent waves,
after noon, when the surfers relinquish the waves. When the winds turn
northerly, Kihei is the spot to be; some days, you can see whales in the
distance behind the windsurfers. The northern end of Kihei is best: At
Ohukai Park, the first beach along South Kihei Road, the winds are
good, the water is easy to access, and a long strip of grass is available to
assemble your gear. If you have enough experience to head out on your
own but you want manageable waves, head to Kanaha Beach Park near
the airport in Kahului, which is where all the top schools take their stu-
dents to learn.
Top-quality rental gear for windsurfing and kitesurfing can be had from
Second Wind Sail & Surf, 111 Hana Hwy. (between Dairy Road and
Hobron Avenue), Kahului (% 800-936-7787 or 808-877-7467; www.
secondwindmaui.com). They’re also an excellent contact if you want to
arrange for windsurfing lessons, for beginners and experienced wind-
surfers alike, as well as kiteboarding lessons for experienced wave
riders. Action Sports Maui (% 808-871-5857; www.actionsports
maui.com) also offers lessons in both windsurfing and kiteboarding, as
well as paragliding for high-soaring adventurers.
Scuba diving
Molokini is one of Hawaii’s top dive spots thanks to calm, clear, pro-
tected waters and an abundance of marine life at every level, from clouds
of yellow butterfly fish to white-tipped reef sharks to manta rays. This
crescent-shaped crater has three tiers of diving: a 35-foot plateau inside
the crater basin (used by beginning divers and snorkelers), a wall sloping
to 70 feet just beyond the inside plateau, and a sheer wall on the outside
and backside of the crater that plunges 350 feet below the surface.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 281

Other top dive spots include the pristine waters off the island of Lanai,
whose south and west coasts are a dream come true for divers looking
for a one-of-a-kind setting.
You need to book a dive boat to get to Molokini or Lanai. Lahaina Divers
(% 800-998-3483 or 808-667-7496; www.lahainadivers.com) is a five-
star PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) facility that
has been lauded as one of Hawaii’s top dive operators by publications
like Scuba Diving magazine. Lahaina Divers can take certified divers to
Molokini or Lanai aboard one of its big, comfortable dive boats for two-
to four-tank dives ranging in price from $109 to $209; West Maui dives
start at $109. Instruction is available for divers of all experience levels,
and the “Discover Scuba” package for beginners starts at just $139
(check for Internet specials). Full open-water training packages are also
available, as well as specialty training in deep diving, underwater pho-
tography, and more. Lahaina Divers is happy to take divers with disabili-
ties out, too. They’ll also direct experienced, certified divers to Maui’s
best beach dives.
Or contact Ed Robinson’s Diving Adventures (% 800-635-1273 or
808-879-3584; www.mauiscuba.com/erd1.htm), which caters to certified
divers from his South Maui base. A widely published underwater pho-
tographer, Ed is one of Maui’s best, and most of his business is repeat
customers. Ed offers personalized two-tank dives, three-tank adventures,
Lanai trips, and sunset and night dives; prices start at $130. Custom
dives are also available, plus discounts for multiple-day dives.
Also recommendable for two-tank boat dives to Molokini and nearby
Maui waters is Mike Severns Diving (% 808-879-6596; www.mike
severnsdiving.com), which takes 12 divers at a time out from Kihei 
in two groups of six for a quiet and crowd-free experience. The price 
is $145, including gear, with discounts available if you have your 
own equipment or schedule multiday dives. Private charters are also
available.
If you’ve never scuba dived before but want to learn, contact either
Lahaina Divers or Bobby Baker’s Maui Sun Divers (% 877-879-3337 or
808-879-3337; www.mauisundivers.com). This outfit specializes in train-
ing beginners in small groups, and it offers introductory two-tank dives
for $110 and multiple-day starter and certification programs.
Sportfishing
Ready to head out on the open waves in search of big-game fish like
marlin, tuna, and wahoo? Hawaii Fishing Adventures and Charters
(% 877-388-1376; www.sportfishhawaii.com) can book a first-class
charter for you out of Maalaea or Lahaina harbors on Maui. Half-day pri-
vate charters start at $600.
Part IV: Maui 
282

Exploring on Dry Land
Maui is home to two of Hawaii’s most renowned attractions: Haleakala
National Park, a remarkable crater at the heart of the island that offers
some of the best sunrise watching in the world, not to mention one-of-a-
kind hiking and biking fun; and the Heavenly Road to Hana, one of the
most well-known scenic drives in the United States.
If you need a little personal assistance in choosing among Maui’s wealth
of activity options, you can get it. The best and most reliable activity
booker on Maui is Tom Barefoot’s Tours, 250 Alamaha St. (at Wakea
Street, south of the Hana Highway), Kahului (% 800-621-3601 or
808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com). Unlike most other so-called
“activity centers” on Maui, this professional operation has nothing to do
with timeshares — activities are its business, and I’ve found the sales-
people’s recommendations to be consistently good ones. You can book
discounted activities before you leave home via their Web site or toll-
free number.
Do yourself a favor and avoid those activities bookers that are trying to
sell you a timeshare. Believe me, spending a half-day of your precious
vacation time warding off the hard-sell advances of a salesperson trying
to force you to buy a timeshare you don’t need in exchange for a “free”
snorkel cruise on a cut-rate operator is simply not worth it.
Taking a guided van or bus tour
If you’ve rented a car and can get around easily on your own, driving
yourself around the island is definitely the preferable way to go.
But you might want to hook up with a guided tour if your mobility is lim-
ited, if you’re traveling solo and don’t want to make the drive to Hana on
your own, or if you just want to kick back and let somebody else take the
wheel. The downside is that with a guided tour, you’ll have little or no
control over where you go and how long you stay, and your time com-
muning with nature will be limited. Still, for some people, a guided tour
is the best way to see Haleakala National Park and take in the glories of
the Heavenly Road to Hana.
For small-scale, local-led van tours of the Heavenly Road to Hana and
Haleakala National Park’s sunrise extravaganza, book your guided trip
with family-owned Ekahi Tours (% 888-292-2422 or 808-877-9775;
www.ekahi.com). One of the great advantages of its Hana tour is that it’s
a circle island tour when weather permits; if the going’s good, you’ll not
only drive the road to Hana, but also experience the desert landscape of
the little-traveled back road on the return trip, which takes you along
the south coast and around the back side of the Haleakala volcano.
Ekahi can take you not only to Hana but also to hidden Keanae, a
halfway-to-Hana tour that offers an insightful look at Maui’s rural past
and present. Sunrise tours of Haleakala Crater are also on offer. Ekahi
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 283

tour prices range from $101 to $130 adults, $75 to $99 kids under 11,
depending on the tour you choose; prices include a deli lunch.
Discounts are available for seniors over age 60.
Polynesian Adventure Tours (% 800-622-3011 or 808-833-3000;
www.polyad.com) offered the very first guided bus tours along the
Heavenly Road to Hana, and it’s still going strong in this department. In
addition to the Hana option, it offers both Haleakala sunrise and Iao
Valley tours in minivans, big-windowed mini-coaches, and full-size luxury
buses. Prices run $76 to $99 for adults, $52 to $60 for kids ages 3 to 11.
Book your Polynesian Adventure Tour online to get a 10 percent price
break.
If you choose to visit Haleakala National Park on a guided tour, remem-
ber to dress warmly, because it gets cooooold at 10,000 feet. For more on
Haleakala’s weather, see the complete section on the park later in this
chapter.
Enjoying guided nature hikes
Maui Eco-Adventures (% 877-661-7720 or 808-661-7720; www.ecomaui.
com) was recognized as Hawaii’s Eco-Tourism Operator of the Year in
2005, and deservedly so. This well-run operation specializes in guided
cultural and hiking adventures that explore untrammeled areas of the
Valley Isle — including the little-known Maunalei Arboretum; Kahakuloa
Village, a rare vestige of old Hawaii; and Nakele Point, the northernmost
point on Maui — on a variety of compelling journeys for intrepid travel-
ers of all hiking abilities. A selection of wonderful waterfall hikes can
make your island dreams come true; the six-hour Rainforest/Waterfall
hike is my favorite for the access it provides into the breathtakingly
lush, otherwise hidden heart of Maui. A Haleakala crater hike really
brings the majestic yet barren landscape to life. Hike/kayak combos are
also available for those who want a multifaceted experience, as are
custom-designed tours that can add helicopter tours, sailboat adven-
tures, and four-wheeling into the mix. Prices run $80 to $160 per person,
including continental breakfast, lunch, a day’s supply of water, and
pickup from West Maui hotels (expect to pay more for a custom-
designed tour). An excellent way to see Maui at its natural best.
Maui’s oldest guided hiking company is Ken Schmitt’s Hike Maui
(% 866-324-MAUI [6284] or 808-879-5270; www.hikemaui.com), univer-
sally lauded for the quality of its hikes. The expert guides are all trained
naturalists who really know their stuff. Hike Maui offers an array of hikes
from easy to strenuous, but most fall in the moderate category. Two rain
forest and waterfall hikes are available, as are two Haleakala Volcano
hikes that offer an excellent way to see this splendid national park,
which can be difficult to appreciate if you don’t know what you’re
seeing. If you’re an accomplished hiker and fit for it, don’t miss the
longer hike. It takes you all the way to the crater floor — which looks so
much like the moon that the lunar astronauts trained here — for an oth-
erworldly experience. Outings range from $75 to $154 per person,
Part IV: Maui 
284

including equipment and transportation from the company’s Central
Maui headquarters, and a simple, healthy lunch of sandwiches and fruit.
You can book as late as a couple of days in advance, but your best bet is
to call before you arrive on the island.
Maui Hiking Safaris (% 888-445-3963 or 808-573-0168; www.maui.
net/~mhs) is another reputable company offering guided hikes for all
levels, including waterfall hikes and guided hikes of Haleakala. Prices
run from $59 to $139 per person.
Maui Hiking Safaris extends 10 percent discounts to hikers who book
online and to groups of six or more.
Getting a bird’s-eye view
Flightseeing is an excellent way to explore Maui’s stunning, untouched
natural areas — areas that simply can’t be seen by any other means.
Maui-based helicopter tours also offer you the opportunity to see a
neighbor island — Molokai, Lanai, or even the Big Island — from the air
in addition to the Valley Isle itself. There are, however, some considera-
tions. Although the companies that I recommend all feature skilled pilots
and helicopters with excellent safety records, the truth of the matter is
that flightseeing can be risky business. A few dozen people have died in
commercial helicopter crashes in Hawaii over the past decade. Of course,
just as with airplane travel, you are more likely to have a car accident
than a helicopter crash. Still, you should make informed decisions.
When reserving a helicopter tour with any company, check to make sure
that safety is its first concern. The company should be an FAA-certified
Part 135 operator, and the pilot should be Part 135 certified as well; the
135 license guarantees more stringent maintenance requirements and
pilot training programs than those who are only Part 91 certified. And
any time weather conditions look iffy, reschedule.
Blue Hawaiian Helicopters (tours depart from Kahului Airport; % 800-
745-2583 or 808-871-8844; www.bluehawaiian.com) is an excellent
flightseeing company that’s family run by David and Patti Chevalier and
a loyal long-employed staff. Blue Hawaiian flies a fleet of superb
American Eurocopter AStar 350 helicopters that carry six passengers,
providing each with a 180-degree view and a Bose noise-canceling head-
set that lets you enjoy a surprisingly quiet ride. A world leader in the
flightseeing industry, Blue Hawaiian also features Hawaii’s only EC-130B4
Eco-Stars; these cutting-edge helicopters lower noise pollution with a
superquiet design, and maximize comfort and views with state-of-the-art
design, technology, and materials. They offer one phenomenal ride. (You
can choose which kind of copter you’ll fly; the Eco-Star tours are more
expensive, but offer a slightly better viewing range through their bubble-
like windows.) A range of available flight options includes some or all of
the following spectacular sights: the misty, green West Maui Mountains;
impressive Haleakala Volcano; luxuriant, unspoiled East Maui and Hana;
and Molokai, where you’ll fly by the highest sea cliffs in the world. Tours
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 285

last from 30 to 90 minutes, and prices range from $173 to $518 per
person (kids under 2 fly free; all other children pay full fare).
At press time, Blue Hawaiian was offering a significant price break —
about 13 percent — for online bookings.
Visiting Haleakala National Park
Haleakala (ha-lay-ah-ka-la) — the House of the Sun — is the massive
10,023-foot-high mountain that forms the core of the island of Maui. It’s
also Hawaii’s second national park (after the Big Island’s Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park) and Maui’s biggest natural attraction. Each
year, some 1.5 million people drive to the summit of Haleakala to peer
down into the crater of the world’s largest dormant volcano. (Its official
status is “active but not currently erupting,” even though Haleakala has
remained silent since 1790.) The crater is impressive: At 3,000 feet deep,
71⁄2 miles long by 21⁄2 miles wide, and encompassing 19 square miles, it’s
big enough to hold the entire island of Manhattan. More than anything
else, it resembles a barren moonscape.
This stark, rugged place is breathtakingly beautiful in its own way: a deso-
late, otherworldly canyon painted in hues of blue and green and red.
Just driving up the mountain is an experience in itself: The road climbs
from sea level to 10,000 feet in just 37 miles, and the views are magnifi-
cent along the entire route. At first glance, the landscape looks like noth-
ing more than a dry and barren wasteland. But soon, a fascinating,
multihued geologic world emerges — a surprisingly fragile one that sup-
ports a number of the world’s rarest examples of flora and fauna. Among
the rare endangered species that call Haleakala home are the nene (nay-
nay), a gray-brown Hawaiian goose that doesn’t migrate, prefers rock-
hard lava beds to lakes, and is now protected as the state bird. There’s
also the silvery-green, porcupiney silversword plant, which grows only
in Hawaii, lives for about 50 years, blooms once in a beautiful purple
bouquet, and dies.
Haleakala is best known for its mystical sunrise vistas. Crowds of visi-
tors drive here in the dark predawn hours to watch the spectacle of
dawn breaking over the crater. If you decide to join the early-morning
crowds, stick around after sunrise for some excellent hiking opportuni-
ties. Or do what a lot of people do: Hop on a bike and coast down the
switchbacked, view-endowed road to the base of the mountain.
Sunrise at Haleakala has become so popular that the park was experi-
encing theme-park crowds and L.A.-style gridlock in the predawn hours,
which was seriously damaging both the mood and the protected natural
environment. The National Park Service instituted policies in late 2005
that limited the number of vehicles allowed into the summit parking
lots. Note that if lots are too crowded, there’s a chance — albeit a small
one — that you may be turned away at the entrance gate.

Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 287

That’s the bad news. The good news is that the premium value of getting
up in the middle of the night to greet sunrise atop Haleakala is largely a
myth. Many believe — including yours truly — that sunset is actually
Haleakala’s finest hour. The crater is in shadow at sunrise; by sunset, it
has positioned itself to bring the colors of Haleakala into their full,
vibrant hues. Many consider Haleakala to offer the finest sunsets in
Hawaii — and sunset doesn’t offer the risk that sunrise holds, because
the cloud cover that might block a sunrise view can be difficult to evalu-
ate under cover of darkness. Furthermore, you won’t be too exhausted
to enjoy the fabulous views.
The park actually contains two separate and distinct destinations:
Haleakala Summit and the Kipahulu coast. Lush, green, and tropical,
Kipahulu is a world apart from the summit — and accessible only from
the east side of the island, near Hana. No road links the summit and the
coast, so Hana is a completely separate outing. For a discussion of
Kipahulu and its biggest attraction, Oheo Gulch, see the section “Driving
the Heavenly Road to Hana,” later in this chapter.
See the “Haleakala National Park” map on p. 287 for listings in this section.
Preparing for your visit
For information before you go, contact Haleakala National Park at 
% 808-572-4400 for information on the Haleakala summit (main) area of
the park (dial % 808-248-7375 for information and the ranger station at
the park’s Kipahulu district, near Hana, which is a separate outing I dis-
cuss later in this chapter). Or visit the park’s official Web site at
www.nps.gov/hale. You can also find lots of useful information at an
unofficial but excellent site, www.haleakala.national-park.com.
The summit of Haleakala is 38 miles, or about a 11⁄2-hour drive, from
Kahului in Central Maui. To get there, take the Haleakala Highway
(Highway 37 and then Highway 377) to wiggly Haleakala Crater Road
(Highway 378), the heavily switchbacked road that leads you to the
Part IV: Maui 
288
The legend behind the House of the Sun
The name Haleakala actually means “House of the Sun.” The story of how this wild-
looking volcano got such a magnificent name goes like this: One day, a mom com-
plained that the sun sped across the sky so quickly that her tapa cloth didn’t have
enough time to dry. So in the predawn hours of the next morning, her thoughtful son,
the demigod Maui, climbed to the top of the volcano. When the sun rose above the
horizon, Maui lassoed it, bringing it to a halt in the sky.
The sun begged Maui to let go. Maui said he would, on one condition: that the sun
slow its trip across the sky to give the island more sunlight. The sun agreed. In honor
of the agreement, islanders dubbed the mountain “House of the Sun.”

10,000-foot summit. Allow two hours to reach the summit if you’re driv-
ing from Lahaina or Kihei, 21⁄2 hours if you’re arriving from Wailea or
Kaanapali, 15 minutes more if you’re coming from Kapalua.
For the sunrise time and viewing conditions at Haleakala summit, call 
% 808-877-5111.
Admission to the park is $10 per car, which allows you to come and go
as you please for seven days. It’s $5 per person for individual walk-ins.
Keep these tips in mind as you plan your visit to Haleakala National
Park:
 If Maui is the first Hawaiian island you’re visiting, schedule your
sunrise visit for the first full day of your trip. Your body clock
won’t be on Hawaii time yet, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get up at
3 a.m. It will feel like anywhere from 5 to 9 a.m. if you’re from the
mainland. If Maui is the last island on your itinerary, schedule your
sunrise visit for the final day of your trip, because it’s time to reac-
climate yourself to the at-home hour anyway. Or, as I’ve recom-
mended above, simply opt for a visit later in the day, and you won’t
disturb your normal sleep patterns.
 Dress warmly, in layers, no matter what time of year you visit.
Temperatures at the summit usually range between 40 and 65°F but
can drop below freezing any time of year when you factor in the
windchill, especially in the predawn hours. Wear a hat and sturdy
shoes and bring a blanket if you don’t have a warm jacket. The
weather is unpredictable at the summit, so be prepared for wind
and rain in winter no matter what the time of day; don’t be fooled
by the coastline conditions. Call % 808-877-5111 for the summit
forecast.
 Bring drinking water. You’ll need plenty of water on hand, espe-
cially if you plan on hiking.
 Remember that this is a high-altitude wilderness area. The thin-
ness of the air makes some people dizzy; you may also experience
lightheadedness, shortness of breath, nausea, headaches, and
dehydration. The park recommends that pregnant women and
those with heart or respiratory problems consult a doctor before
ascending to high elevations.
 Fill up your gas tank before you head to Haleakala. The last gas
station is 27 miles below the summit at Pukalani. Fill up the night
before if you’re going for sunrise, because it will be nearly impossi-
ble to find an open gas station at 4 a.m.
Arriving at the park and making the drive to the summit
About a mile from the entrance is the Park Headquarters Visitor
Center, open daily from 8 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. It’s a great place to pick up
park information, including the latest schedule of guided walks and
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 289

ranger talks. If, however, you arrive before dawn, all you can do here is
use the round-the-clock restrooms; the ones here are much nicer than
the ones at the summit, so I highly recommend making a pit stop on the
way up. Drinking water is also available.
You’ll pass two scenic overlooks on the way to the summit. Stop at the
one just beyond mile marker 17, Leleiwi Overlook, if only to get out,
stretch, and get accustomed to the heights. From the parking area, a
short trail leads to a panoramic view of the lunarlike crater. (The other
overlook, Kalahaku, is most easily accessible on the descent.)
Continue on, and you’ll soon reach Haleakala Visitor Center, 11 miles
from the park entrance (open daily from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.), which
offers spectacular views and some bare-bones restrooms. Park rangers
also offer excellent, informative, and free naturalist talks daily throughout
the day from the center. (Call ahead to confirm the next day’s schedule.)
The actual summit — and the ideal sunrise-viewing perch — is beyond
the turnoff for the visitor center, at Puu Ulaula Overlook (Red Hill). At
Puu Ulaula, a triangular glass building serves as a windbreak and the
best sunrise viewing spot. After the spectacle of sunrise, you can often
see all the way to the snowcapped summit of Mauna Kea on the Big
Island if it’s clear. Haleakala Observatories (nicknamed Science City),
which isn’t open to the public, is also located here.
Hiking the park
If you want to hike the park, I strongly suggest going with a guide. This is
an outlandishly huge, empty place that is best seen with someone who
can lead you in the right direction and help you understand what you’re
seeing. Park rangers offer a range of free guided hikes; call for the latest
schedule (% 808-572-4400) and to find out what to wear and bring
(sturdy shoes and drinking water are musts).
Also consider taking one of the guided Haleakala Crater hikes offered by
Maui Eco-Adventures or Hike Maui. I really like the extended views of
the crater that professional guides offer on these private tours. See the
section “Enjoying guided nature hikes,” earlier in this chapter.
If you don’t want to bother with a serious hike but just want a glimpse of
the park’s peculiar brand of natural beauty, take a half-hour walk down
the half-mile Hosmer Grove Nature Trail, which anybody can do. The
trail is well marked, with placards that point out what you’re seeing
along the way. Ask the ranger at the visitor center to direct you to the
trail head.
If you’d like to strike out on your own along the park’s more serious
trails, preview your options online at www.haleakala.national-
park.com (click “Hiking Guide”) or call ahead. Rangers are always happy
to provide you with complete trail information.
Part IV: Maui 
290

Driving back down the mountain
As you start to head down the volcano, put your rental car in low gear
on the way down so that you don’t ride your brakes.
Around mile marker 24 is Kalahaku Overlook, the best place to spot the
spiky, alienlike silversword plant and to take in some fabulous
panoramic views.
At the base of the mountain, where you’ll turn onto Haleakala Crater
Road from the Haleakala Highway, is Kula, the closest thing to a gateway
town that Haleakala has. Kula is most notable for its two restaurants,
Kula Sandalwoods and the Kula Lodge, both of which serve great post-
sunrise breakfast and lunch.
Exploring the volcano by horseback
My absolute favorite way to explore Haleakala Crater is with Pony
Express Tours (% 808-667-2200; www.ponyexpresstours.com), which
offers guided trail rides down the crater’s Sliding Sands Trail, which
descends from the crater rim 2,500 feet to the crater floor, for a majestic
71⁄2-mile round-trip ride. The guides are friendly experts, and the horses
are good natured and extremely well taken care of; mine was an agree-
able red-haired boy named Leo, and my day exploring Haleakala with him
was the highlight of my last trip to Maui. These all-day Haleakala trail
rides are $182 per person, and require you to have at least minimal riding
experience; this is strictly a nose-to-tail ride, so as long as you know the
basics, you’ll be in good shape. Rides start daily at 8:30 a.m., with a
second ride offered on days that demand it. A two-hour paniolo ranch
ride is also offered for $110. Book well in advance — ideally, before you
leave home — in order to secure your spots on this terrific trip.
At press time, Pony Express was offering 10 percent off for those who
booked their trips online.
Biking down the volcano
Another great way to experience Haleakala is to cruise down it, from
summit to base, on a bicycle. The guided ride is quite an experience,
with stunning views the entire way. And you don’t need to be an expert
cyclist to do it; you just have to be able to ride a bike. In fact, you barely
have to pedal — you’ll coast down at a nice, leisurely pace. (The con-
stant switchbacks keep you from picking up too much speed.)
While these tours used to be offered from Haleakala’s summit both at
sunrise and throughout the day, the National Park Service has suspended
all tours from within Haleakala National Park following a glut of increased
traffic. As of this writing, most bike tours start at 6,500 feet elevation, just
outside the park entrance. The trips are still quite fun, but you will have
to start the day atop Haleakala on your own. I’m sure that the big outfit-
ters will reinstate full service as soon as the National Park Service allows;
check the outfitters’ Web sites or call for further information.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 291

Maui’s oldest downhill company is Maui Downhill (% 800-535-2453 or
808-871-2155; www.mauidownhill.com). Maui Downhill offers a variety of
guided Haleakala bike “safaris” at sunrise, midday, and sunset, running
from $125 to $195 per person. Other reliable companies include Maui
Mountain Cruisers (% 800-232-6284 or 808-871-6014; www.maui
mountaincruisers.com) and Mountain Riders (% 800-706-7700
or 808-242-9739; www.mountainriders.com). Prices usually include 
hotel pickup, transport to the top, all equipment, meals, and drop-off.
Generally, riders have to be at least 12 and at least 4 feet 10 inches tall.
Younger kids and pregnant women can usually ride along in the van.
At press time, you could save a bundle on most of these tours by book-
ing in advance via most of these companies’ own Web sites (for example,
Maui Downhill was offering $30-per-person discounts on its $125 tours!).
The current situation has really kicked the deals into gear.
Driving the Heavenly Road to Hana
No road in Hawaii is more celebrated than the Hana Highway (Highway
36), the supercurvaceous two-lane highway that winds along Maui’s
northeastern shore, offering some of the most scenic natural sightseeing
in the entire state.
The Hana Highway winds for some 52 miles east from Kahului, in Central
Maui, crossing more than 50 one-lane bridges, passing greener-than-
green taro patches, magnificent seascapes, gorgeous waterfalls, botani-
cal gardens, and rain forests before passing through the little town of
Hana and ultimately ending up in one of Hawaii’s most beautiful tropical
places: the Kipahulu section of Haleakala National Park. Kipahulu is
home to Oheo (oh-hay-oh) Gulch, a stunning series of waterfall pools
that tumble down to the sea.
Despite the draws at the end of the road, this drive is about the 
journey — not the destination. The drive from end to end takes at least
three hours, but you should allow all day for it. If you race along just to
arrive in Hana as quickly as you can, you’ll wonder what all the fuss
was about. Start out early, take it slow and easy, stop at the scenic
points along the way, and let the ride along Hana work its magic. It will,
I promise.
Take these points into consideration as you plan your Hana road trip:
 Leave early. Get up just after dawn, have an early breakfast
(Charley’s Restaurant & Saloon in Paia opens at 7 a.m.; see Chapter
12), and hit the road by 8 a.m. If you wait until midmorning to leave,
you’ll get stuck in bumper-to-bumper Hana Road traffic, you won’t
have enough time to enjoy the sights along the way, and you’ll
arrive at Oheo Gulch too late in the day to take a hike or a dip. It’s
especially important to make the most of the daylight hours in
winter, when days are shortest.
Part IV: Maui 
292

 Consider booking a place to stay in Hana if you’d really like to
take your time. That way, you can head out to Hana against the
traffic in the afternoon, stay for a couple of nights so that you have
a full day to enjoy East Maui’s attractions (including an abundance
of peace and quiet), and meander back at your own pace (once
again avoiding the traffic) on the morning of the third day. See
Chapter 12 for accommodations in Hana.
 Fill up on gas before you set out. If all else fails, make sure that
you stop in Paia, just east of Kahului, because the next gas is in
Hana — 44 miles, 50-some bridges, and 200-plus hairpin turns down
the road.
 Don’t bother if it’s been raining heavily. The Hana Highway is well
paved and well maintained but can nevertheless be extremely dan-
gerous when wet — and it’s easy to get stuck in muddy shoulders
and pull-offs.
 Bring your bathing suit and a towel in warm weather. You’ll find a
number of waterfall pools along the way that are ideal for a refresh-
ing dip, and folks love to swim in Oheo Gulch’s placid summer
pools. (However, don’t enter the pools unless the park rangers say
conditions are safe. Please take their warnings seriously; visitors
have been killed here.) Also bring mosquito repellent, because lush
East Maui is a buggy place.
 Leave your mainland road rage on the mainland. Practice aloha
as you drive the Hana Road: Give way at the one-lane bridges. Wave
at passing motorists. Let the locals who drive this road with jaw-
dropping speed and who pass on blind curves have the right of
way; if the guy behind you blinks his lights, let him pass. And don’t
honk your horn — it’s considered rude in Hawaii.
There’s one exception to the no-horn-honking rule: If you reach a blind
curve, do honk your horn to indicate that you’re coming around the
bend — and proceed slowly.
See “The Heavenly Road to Hana” map on p. 294 and the “Hana” map on
p. 299 for listings in this section.
Highlights worth seeking out along the way
If you’d like some narration to accompany what you’re seeing along the
Road to Hana, pick up a Hana Cassette Guide on your way out of town.
The 90-minute tape or CD is $20 at the Hana Cassette Guide shop in
Kahului on Dairy Road (Highway 380), next to the Shell Service Station
just before the Hana Highway (% 808-572-0550). Your Hana CD guide
also gets you a map and flora guide that are useful for along the road; in
fact, the detailed map is my favorite part of the trip. I highly recommend
using it in tandem with the following text, because it covers many more
sights and includes much more background than I have the space for
here.

The Heavenly Road to Hana
Part IV: Maui 
294
If you want to see the Hana Road but you just don’t want to drive it your-
self, consider taking a guided van or bus tour. See the section called
“Taking a guided van or bus tour,” earlier in this chapter, for recom-
mended tour operators.
Setting Out: A half-dozen miles east of Kahului on the Hana Highway is
Paia (pa-ee-ah), a former mill town that’s now a neo-hippie, boutique-
dotted surf spot. Charley’s Restaurant & Saloon, at Baldwin Avenue in
the heart of town, makes an ideal stop for a hearty breakfast (see
Chapter 12); afterward, you can bop around the corner to 30 Baldwin
Ave., where Café Mambo (% 808-579-8021) offers sandwiches and box
lunches for you to take on the road.
Just beyond Paia town is Hookipa Beach Park, one of the greatest wind-
surfing spots on the planet; see the section “Combing the beaches,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for details.

The road narrows to one lane in each direction and starts winding
around mile marker 3. But it’s at mile marker 16 that the curves really
begin, one right after another. Slow down and enjoy the bucolic sur-
roundings. After mile marker 16, the highway number changes from 36
to 360, and the mile markers start again at 0. (I have no idea why.)
At Mile Marker 2: The first great place to stop is Twin Falls, on the
inland side of the road; the Twin Falls Fruit Stand marks the spot. Hop
over the short ladder on the right side of the red gate and walk about
three to five minutes to the waterfall off to your left, or continue on
another 10 to 15 minutes to the second, larger waterfall. The gate has a
“No Trespassing” sign, but you’ll see from the crowds that it doesn’t
bother most folks. If it bothers you, skip Twin Falls altogether; there’s
plenty more to see farther down the road.
After Mile Marker 4: The vegetation grows more lush as you head east.
This area is the edge of the Koolau Forest Reserve, where the branches
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 295

of 20- to 30-foot-tall guava trees are laden with green (not ripe) and yellow
(ripe) fruit, and introduced eucalyptus trees grow as tall as 200 feet.
The upland forest gets 200 to 300 inches of rainfall annually, so you’ll
begin to see waterfalls around just about every turn as you head east
from here. The one-lane bridges start, too, so drive slowly and be pre-
pared to yield to oncoming cars.
After Mile Marker 6: Just before mile marker 7 is a forest of waving
bamboo. The sight is so spectacular that drivers are often tempted to
take their eyes off the road, so be very cautious. Just after mile marker 7,
you can pull over at the Kaaiea Bridge, which offers a terrific view of the
bamboo grove.
At Mile Marker 9: The sign says “Koolau State Forest Reserve,” but the
real attraction is the Waikamoi Ridge Trail, an easy and well-marked 3⁄4-
mile loop. This trail makes a great place to stretch your legs; look for the
turnout on the right.
Between Mile Markers 10 and 11: At the halfway point, on the inland
side of the road, is the Garden of Eden Botanical Gardens &
Arboretum (% 808-572-9899; www.mauigardenofeden.com), featuring
more than 500 exotic plants, flowers, and trees from around the Pacific
(including lots of wild ginger and an impressive palm collection) on 26
acres. You can drive through the garden in about five minutes, walk its
main loop in about 20 minutes, or stay a bit longer and follow any
number of nature trails. The garden is open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
and admission is $10 per person. A fruit-and-smoothie stand offers
refreshment at the gate.
At Mile Marker 11: Park at the bridge and take the short walk up the
stone wall–lined trail to 30-foot Puohokamoa Falls, tucked away in a fern-
filled amphitheater surrounded by banana trees, colorful heliconias, and
sweet-smelling ginger. The gorgeous pool is a great place to take a plunge.
Just Beyond Mile Marker 12: Kaumahina State Wayside Park has
portable toilets and picnic tables at the large parking area, plus a gor-
geous view of the rugged coastline across the road.
Just Beyond Mile Marker 14: One of my favorite stops on the entire
drive is Honomanu Bay, a stark rocky beach popular with net fishermen
that faces a beautiful bay. Tear your eyes away from the water, and you’ll
find incredible golden-green cliffs forming an intense backdrop as you
look inland and up. The turnoff is on the left, at the stop sign just after
the mile marker; don’t attempt the rutted and rocky road if it has been
raining recently.
Just Beyond Mile Marker 17: Keanae Lookout is a wide spot on the
ocean side of the road where you can see the entire Keanae Peninsula
jutting out into the sea, with its checkerboard pattern of green taro
fields and its ocean boundary etched in black lava. If time is precious,
Part IV: Maui 
296

though, wait to stop after mile marker 19, where the view from the
Wailea Valley viewpoint is even better.
At Mile Marker 18: The road widens, and fruit and flower stands begin
to line the road. Many of these stands operate on the honor system: You
select your purchase and leave your money in the basket. I recommend
stopping at Uncle Harry’s, just beyond Keanae School on the ocean side
of the road. Harry Kunihi Mitchell was a legend in his time, an expert in
native plants who devoted his life to the Hawaiian-rights and nuclear-
free movements.
A Quarter-Mile after Marker 19: For the best view of the Wailua
Peninsula, stop at the lookout and parking area on the ocean side of the
road, where sun-dappled picnic tables serve up great views.
A bit farther down the road, just before the bridge on the inland side, is
a pretty waterfall view.
Between Mile Markers 22 and 23: At Puaa Kaa (poo-ah-ah ka-ah) State
Wayside Park, the splash of waterfalls provides the soundtrack for a
small park area with restrooms and a picnic area. On the opposite side of
the road from the toilets is a well-marked and paved path that leads
through a patch of sweet-smelling ginger to the falls and a swimming hole.
After Mile Marker 25: After the mile marker, turn toward the ocean at
the steep turnoff just before the one-lane bridge and follow the well-
paved but winding road 21⁄2 miles down to the Old Nahiku Lookout, one
of the very few points along the entire route that lets you get close to
the ocean, and the finest picnic spot on the entire route. A small grassy
lawn faces rocky lava points and crashing turquoise surf for a breathtak-
ing, up-close view. You can walk down to the rocky beach at the backside
of the parking lot.
At Mile Marker 31: Turn toward the ocean on Ulaino Road and go a half-
mile to Kahanu Garden, one of four National Tropical Botanical Gardens
in Hawaii (% 808-248-8912; www.ntbg.org). Surrounded by a native
pandanus forest (the leaf that lauhala products are woven from), the
garden features a remarkable collection of ethno-botanical plants from
the Pacific islands (with a particular concentration on plants of value to
the people of Polynesia and Micronesia), plus the foundation of
Poolanihale Heiau, the largest Hawaiian temple in Hawaii. The self-
guided walking tour is $10 (free for kids 12 and under) and takes 30 to 40
minutes to complete; open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m. The road that leads to the garden entrance is rough and unpaved,
but not bad; still, don’t bother if it’s been raining.
At Mile Marker 32: The turnoff for 122-acre Waianapanapa (wa-ee-na-pa-
na-pa) State Park leads to shiny black-sand Waianapanapa Beach, whose
bright-green jungle backdrop and sparkling cobalt water make for quite a
stunning view. On hand are picnic pavilions, restrooms, trails, and fruit
stands lining the road, so come down to take a peek. The beach here is
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 297

not for swimming, though. A blowhole appears when the winter surf kicks
up. This natural hole in the rocks is configured so that when harsh surf
kicks up, water shoots through the hole like a spout — quite a neat sight.
Arriving in Hana
Postage stamp–size Hana is a lush and charming little hamlet, but
frankly, there’s just not much to see in the town itself.
The few attractions include the Hana Coast Gallery, on the Hana
Highway adjacent to the Hotel Hana-Maui (% 808-248-8636; www.hana
coast.com), an excellent showcase for fine arts and island-made prod-
ucts hewn by master craftspeople, including gorgeous woodworks. The
quirky Hasegawa General Store (% 808-248-8231) is worth stopping in
for kicks (look for the Spam sushi vending machine near the entrance)
or to use the ATM, but the prices on practicals and munchies are better
across the road and up the hill at the Hana Ranch Store (% 808-248-
8261). If you want a meal, you might try the casual Hana Ranch
Restaurant, or the gourmet Hotel Hana-Maui dining room, Ka’uiki; for
details, see Chapter 12.
History buffs may want to head toward Hana Bay; overlooking the bay is
the Hana Cultural Center and Museum, 4974 Uakea Rd., near the turnoff
to Hana Bay (% 808-248-8622; www.hookele.com/hccm), open daily
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (most of the time). This charming museum is dedi-
cated to preserving the history of Hana, with exhibits showcasing tradi-
tional Hawaiian quilts and such implements of life as poi boards and fish
hooks carved out of the tusks of wild pigs. Also on-site is the Old Hana
Courthouse and Jailhouse, plus Kauhala O Hana, four hale (living struc-
tures) where you can see what it was like to live in the style of Hana’s
earliest settlers. Admission is $2 (free for kids 12 and under).
If you want to see more of what’s available in town, pick up a copy of the
Hana Visitors Guide, a foldout map and pamphlet that’s available free
around town. If you don’t run across one, stop into Hasegawa’s to pick
one up.
For those of you spending some time in these parts, a number of active
adventures are at hand:
 Hang Gliding Maui (% 808-572-6557; www.hangglidingmaui.com)
offers tandem instructional flights aboard its engine-powered ultra-
light aircraft. Prices are $130 for a 30-minute lesson, $220 for an
hour-long lesson.
 If you want to explore the lush Kipahulu District on horseback,
reach out to Maui Stables (% 808-248-7799; www.mauistables.
com), which offers a taste of real island culture as you explore the
gorgeous scenery. Choose a morning or afternoon half-day tour;
prices are $150 per person, including a deli lunch (discounts avail-
able for kids and seniors). Advance reservations are a must, as are
closed shoes and long pants.

 Hana Lava Tube (% 808-248-7308; www.mauicave.com) offers the
chance to take a 30- to 45-minute self-guided tour ($12 adults, free
for kids age 5 and under) through an ancient underground lava-
tube system, through which lava flowed two centuries ago when
Haleakala was an active volcano. Open Monday to Thursday from
10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; no reservations are needed, but call a day
ahead to confirm that the caves will be open; occasionally, they’re
open on Sunday, too.
Exploring beyond Hana: Hamoa Beach and Oheo Gulch
About 21⁄2 miles past Hana is the turnoff for Hamoa Beach, one of the
most gorgeous beaches in all Hawaii — and great for swimming to boot
(in summer, anyway). For details, see the section “Combing the
beaches,” earlier in this chapter.
About 10 luxuriant miles past Hana along the highway is Oheo (oh-hay-
oh) Gulch, a dazzling series of waterfall pools cascading into the sea.
Some folks call this the Seven Sacred Pools, even though there are more

like two dozen. This area is the Kipahulu district of Haleakala National
Park (www.nps.gov/hale), and a ranger station located at the back of
the unpaved parking lot (% 808-248-7375) is staffed daily from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. Restrooms are available, but no drinking water, so be sure to pick
some up in Hana if you’re out. Visiting this area of the park is free.
The easy, half-mile Kuloa Point Loop Trail leads to the lower pools,
where you can take a dip when the weather is warm and the water is
placid. This well-marked 20-minute walk is a must for everyone.
Stay out of the Oheo Gulch pools in winter or after a heavy rain, when
the otherwise-placid falls can wash you out to sea in an instant, to the
waiting sharks below. (No kidding — they actually do hang out in the
brackish water at the foot of the falls.) No matter what the season, if you
do take a dip, always be extra vigilant — keep an eye on the water in the
streams. Even when the sky is sunny near the coast, upland rain can
cause floodwaters to rise in minutes, so if the water seems to be running
between the pools at all, stay out. A mainland visitor was washed away
to sea during a seemingly innocuous Oheo Gulch photo op in May 2002.
Don’t let this terrible tragedy be repeated; always check with the
rangers before you go in the pools.
The 2-mile (each way), moderate Pipiwai Trail leads upstream to addi-
tional pools and 400-foot Waimoku Falls. The often-muddy but rewarding
uphill trail leads through taro patches and bamboo, guava, and mango
stands to the magnificent falls. The trail is unmarked but relatively easy
to follow. Wear sturdy shoes, bring water, and don’t attempt the trek in
the rain.
Heading back to the resorts
Before departing Hana, don’t forget to check your gas gauge no matter
which road west you’re traveling. There’s nowhere to fill up along either
route back to civilization. If you need gas, stop at one of the town’s two
service stations, Chevron and Hasegawa’s Hana Geko Gas, which sit
nearly side by side on the right side of the Hana Highway as you leave
town. (Prepare for sticker shock at the pump, though!)
More attractions worth seeking out
Here are some more attractions that you may not want to miss.
Central Maui
These attractions are located in and around the commercial heart of the
island, Kahului, and nearby Wailuku, the charming county seat. Wailuku
offers a few funky places to shop for antiques and Hawaiiana; see
“Shopping the Local Stores,” later in this chapter.
Bailey House Museum
This 19th-century missionary and sugar planter’s home — built in 1833 on
a royal Hawaiian site — is a treasure-trove of Hawaiiana that includes a
Part IV: Maui 
300

notable collection of precontact Hawaiian artifacts as well as items from
post-missionary times. Excellently curated island-themed temporary
exhibits are also part of the mix. This little museum is well worth a half-
hour stop for history buffs. It boasts lovely gardens and a wonderful gift
shop, too, neither of which requires admission.
See p. 268. 2375-A Main St., just west of the Kaahumanu Avenue/Honoapiilani Highway
(Highway 32/30) intersection, Wailuku. % 808-244-3326. www.mauimuseum.org.
Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors, $1 kids 7–12. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Hawaii Nature Center — Iao Valley
Before you head into Iao Valley to explore, families will want to stop into
this small, kid-centered interactive science center and nature museum
located at the gateway of the Iao Valley State Monument. The center fea-
tures great hands-on exhibits for kids and displays relating to the park’s
natural history. There’s also a nice gift shop if you’re in the market for
nature-themed toys.
At the gateway to Iao Valley State Monument, 875 Iao Valley Rd. % 808-244-6500.
www.hawaiinaturecenter.org. Admission: $6 adults, $4 kids under 12. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Call ahead to reserve a spot on Hawaii Nature Center’s daily Rainforest
Walk through Iao Valley, offered Monday through Friday at 11:30 a.m. and
1:30 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Your guide can
offer historical, cultural, and natural insight that you just can’t gain on a
self-guided tour. The price is $30 for adults, $20 for kids (prices include
museum admission; children must be at least age 5 to join the Rainforest
Walk). Be sure to wear closed-toe shoes suitable for an uneven trail.
Iao Valley State Monument
As you head west to Iao Valley, the transition between town and wild is so
abrupt that most people who drive up into the valley don’t realize they’re
suddenly in a rain forest. The walls of the canyon rise, and a 2,250-foot
needle pricks gray clouds scudding across the blue sky. This is Iao (ee-ow)
Valley, a place of great natural beauty and a haven for Mauians and visi-
tors alike. You could easily spend a day here, but you can see everything
in an hour or two. Two paved walkways loop the just-over-6-acre park; a
leisurely 6-mile loop takes you past lush vegetation and lovely views of the
Iao Needle (called Kukaemoku in Hawaiian), a fabulously impressive spire
jutting 2,250 feet above sea level. This is the spot of the battle of
Kepaniwai, where Kamehameha I conquered the Maui army in 1790 as part
of his unification of the Hawaiian islands. An architectural park of Hawaiian
heritage houses — including a Japanese teahouse with a lovely koi pond,
a Chinese pagoda, a New England–style mission house, a Hawaiian hale,
and a Portuguese garden — stands in harmony by Iao Stream at Kepaniwai
Heritage Garden, near the entrance to the park. It makes an excellent
picnic area, because tables are at hand. You’ll see ferns, banana trees, and
other native and exotic plants in the streamside botanic garden.

Daily 7 a.m.–7 p.m.
West Maui: Historic Lahaina town
It may be hard to believe these days, overrun as Lahaina is with contem-
porary tourist schlock. But any of you who’ve read James Michener’s
Hawaii know that back in the whaling and missionary days, Lahaina was
the capital of Hawaii and the Pacific’s wildest port. Now it’s a party town
of a different kind and has lost much of its historic vibe, but history
buffs with an interest can unearth a half-day’s worth of historic sites.
Your best bet is to start at the Baldwin Home Museum, a beautifully
restored 1838 missionary home at the corner of Front and Dickenson
streets, where the Lahaina Restoration Foundation (% 808-661-3262) is
headquartered. Stop in any day between 10 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to pick up
the free self-guided walking tour brochure and map of Lahaina’s most
historic sites.
South Maui
These terrific attractions are located in Maalaea Harbor Village, at the
northernmost end of South Maui.
Maui Golf & Sports Park
This first-class miniature golf play land boasts two courses that have been
designed with both fun and duffing precision in mind. The park also offers
bumper boats with water cannons (great on a hot day), a rock climbing
wall, and an “xtreme” trampoline. All activities carry separate charges, or
you can bundle them into a package deal. Tiki torches set the mood after
dark, and the staff is very friendly. It’s ideal for both family fun and an after-
dinner date.
See map p. 268. In Maalaea Harbor Village (at the triangle between Honoapiilani
Highway [Highway 30] and Maalaea Road; the entrance is on Maalaea Road),
Maalaea. % 808-242-7818. www.mauigolfandsportspark.com. Activity prices:
$15 for adults, $12 kids for unlimited miniature golf; other activities $9 adults, $7 kids.
Package rates available. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
Maui Ocean Center
This state-of-the-art aquarium is way too pricey for its own good — it’s no
Monterey Bay Aquarium, after all. If you can overlook the cost, it’s a pretty
cool place. All exhibits feature the creatures that populate Hawaii’s waters.
Start at the surge pool, where you’ll see shallow-water marine life like spiny
urchins and cauliflower coral; then move on to the reef tanks, a turtle
lagoon (where you’ll meet some wonderful green sea turtles), a “touch”
pool featuring tide-pool critters, a stingray pool populated by the graceful
bottom dwellers, and a disappointing whale discovery exhibit (no live
Part IV: Maui 
302

creatures). Then you get to the star of the show: the 600,000-gallon main
tank, which features tiger, gray, and white-tip sharks, as well as tuna, sur-
geon fish, triggerfish, and other large-scale tropicals. The neatest thing
about the tank is that it’s punctured by a clear acrylic tunnel that lets you
walk right through it, giving you a real idea of what it might be like to stand
at the bottom of the deep blue sea. Allow about two hours for your visit.
See map p. 268. In Maalaea Harbor Village, 192 Maalaea Rd. (at the triangle between
Honoapiilani Highway [Highway 30] and Maalaea Road), Maalaea. % 808-270-7000.
www.mauioceancenter.com. Admission: $24 adults, $21 seniors (ages 65+), $17
kids 3–12. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (July–Aug daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.).
Hitting the links
Always book your tee times well in advance on popular Maui, especially
in high season. Weekdays are best for avoiding the crowds and securing
the tee times that you want.
The Maui Golf Shop, 357 Huku Lii Place, Kihei (% 800-981-5512 or
808-875-4653; www.golf-maui.com), can book discounted tee times for
you at many of Maui’s finest courses (including, at press time, the
Dunes, Kaanapali, and Makena, all listed later in this section). If you
want to schedule your tee times before you leave home, you can submit
your requests online (where you’ll also find information and insider tips
on playing a wealth of Maui links) up to 30 days in advance. After you
arrive, the Maui Golf Shop is the best place on the island to rent clubs
and stock up on gear. It’s located just off the Piilani Highway (Highway
31) at Ohukai Road (behind Tesoro Gas Express). You can also check out
discounter Tee Times Hawaii.com (% 888-675-GOLF or 866-927-1453;
www.teetimeshawaii.com).
The Dunes at Maui Lani
This dramatic British links–style course was completed in 1997, but it
plays like an old pro. Inspired by the old-growth links of Ireland, Honolulu-
based course architect Robin Nelson built this public course on the former
home of a sand-mining operation, which has allowed the fairways to
mature in record time. Several blind and semiblind shots give this all-
around enjoyable course an edge. Considering the quality of the course,
the rates are a veritable bargain. Private lessons and half-day schools at
the PGA pro-taught golf school even make improving your swing a com-
paratively affordable endeavor.
See map p. 268. 1333 Mauilani Pkwy., Kahului. % 808-873-0422. www.dunesat
mauilani.com. Greens fees: $99, $75 after 2 p.m.
Kaanapali Golf Resort
Both of these popular, rolling resort courses pose a challenge to all golfers,
from high handicappers to near-pros. In December 2006, the Tournament
North Course emerged from a major renovation that slightly retooled the
layout and left the course looking better than ever. It’s a true Robert Trent
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 303

Jones, Jr., design, with an abundance of wide bunkers; several long,
stretched-out tees; the largest, most contoured greens on Maui; and one of
Hawaii’s toughest finishing holes. The par-70, 6,400-yard Resort South
Course is an Arthur Jack Snyder design that was renovated in 2005 by
renowned course architect Robin Nelson, who added new deep bunkers
and landscaping. Although the course still demands challenging shots, the
refreshed layout brings the short game and shot selection into play,
making it a fun outing for a wide spectrum of players. Facilities include a
driving range, putting green, clubhouse, and comprehensive golf academy.
See map p. 268. 2290 Kaanapali Pkwy. (off Highway 30), Kaanapali. % 866-454-GOLF
[4653] or 808-661-3691. www.kaanapali-golf.com. Greens fees: $195–$235
($150–$290 for Kaanapali resort guests); $75–$95 after 1:30 p.m.
Kapalua Golf Club
These three spectacularly sited championship courses are worth the sky-
high greens fees for the magnificent ocean views alone. Resort golf hardly
gets finer; Hawaii magazine regularly names the Bay and the Plantation
courses as two of the top nine courses in Hawaii. An Arnold Palmer/Francis
Duane design, the par-72, 6,600-yard Bay Course is a bit forgiving thanks to
generous and gently undulating fairways, but even the pros have trouble with
the 5th, which requires a tee shot over an ocean cove. The breathtaking —
and breathtakingly difficult — Ben Crenshaw/Bill Coore–designed Plantation
Course is prime for developing your low shots and precise chipping; this
7,263-yard, par-73 showstopper is home to the PGA’s annual Mercedes
Championships. The par-71, 6,632-yard Village Course, a Palmer/Ed Seay
design and the most scenic of the three courses, suits beginners and pros
alike, but winds can make for a challenging day among the Cook and Norfolk
pines. Facilities include locker rooms, driving range, and restaurant. The first-
rate Kapalua Golf Academy (% 877-527-2582 or 808-665-5455), designed
with the input of golf legend Hale Irwin, just may be Hawaii’s best place to
improve the swing of beginners and almost-pros alike.
See map p. 268. Off Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30), Kapalua. % 877-527-2582 or
808-669-8044. www.kapaluamaui.com. Greens fees: $215–$295 ($175–$200 for
Kapalua resort guests); $185–$255 mid-day (11 a.m.–1:50 p.m.) Apr–Sept; $130–$150
after 2 p.m. Check the Web site for seasonal specials and golf packages.
Makena Golf Courses
Robert Trent Jones, Jr., was in top form when he designed these 36 holes.
The par-72, 7,017-yard oceanside South Course is considered the more for-
giving of the two, but has a couple of holes that you’ll never forget: Running
parallel to the ocean, the par-4 16th has a two-tiered green that slopes away
from the player, and the par-5, 502-yard 10th is one of Hawaii’s best driving
holes. With tight fairways and narrow doglegs, the par-72, 6,914-yard North
Course is both more difficult and more spectacular because it sits higher
up the slope of Haleakala. Facilities include a clubhouse, a driving range,
two putting greens, a pro shop, lockers, and lessons. Additional bonuses
include a gorgeous rural setting and spectacular views.

Wailea Golf Club
Most difficult among Wailea’s courses is the par-72, 7,070-yard Gold Course,
home to the Wendy’s Championship Skins Game, which features senior golf
legends in competition. This classic Robert Trent Jones, Jr., design boasts
a rugged layout, narrow fairways, several tricky dogleg holes, daunting nat-
ural hazards, and only-in-Hawaii features like lava outcroppings and native
grasses. Both the Old Blue and the Emerald are easy for most golfers to
enjoy, but the par-72, 6,407-yard Emerald Course — another Trent Jones,
Jr., design — is both the prettiest and the easiest for high-handicappers to
enjoy. The par-72, 6,700-yard Old Blue Course, an open course designed by
Arthur Jack Snyder, has wide fairways that also appeal to beginners, but
bunkers, water hazards, and undulating terrain make it a course that all can
enjoy. Facilities include two clubhouses, two pro shops, restaurants, lock-
ers, club rentals, and a complete training facility.
Call to inquire about discounted afternoon rates, money-saving triple-
and unlimited-play passes, and other specials, including junior golf rates.

Course); $180–$190 for Wailea Resort guests; twilight rates $99–$135.
Relaxing at a Spa
What’s the icing on the cake of any vacation? A pampering spa day, of
course. Hawaii’s spas have raised the art of relaxation and healing to a
new level, showcasing Hawaiian products and traditional treatments
available only in the islands.
They simply don’t come any finer than the luxurious Spa Grande at the
Grand Wailea Resort (% 800-888-6100 or 808-875-1234; www.grand
wailea.com), which is regularly recognized as one of the top ten spas in
the United States. This 50,000-square-foot temple to the good life boasts a
massive East-meets-West spa menu, a first-rate army of therapists, and 40
individual treatment rooms (many with ocean views). There’s a full Termé
hydrotherapy circuit consisting of a variety of healthful baths (including
mud, seaweed, aromatherapy, tropical enzyme, and mineral salt), Roman
pools, and Swiss-jet showers that are worth the treatment price of admis-
sion alone. (They’re included with every treatment, so I recommend
coming a full hour or more before your appointment.) Book a full day’s
package for the ultimate indulgence — you deserve it. Reserve well ahead.
In West Maui, your top choice is Spa Moana at the Hyatt Regency Maui
(% 808-667-4725 or 808-661-1234; www.maui.hyatt.com), a 15,000-
square-foot oceanview spa with 15 treatment rooms, a full-service salon
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 305

with prime views, an open-air relaxation lounge, and an extensive treat-
ment menu that includes some dynamite facials, as well as soothing
body work. Two couples suites allow for romantically infused relaxation.
The adjacent Moana Athletic Club has the finest views of any fitness
center on the island.
If you’re in Lahaina and in the mood for some storefront pampering, visit
Lei Spa Maui, in the 505 Front St. complex, at the far south end of Front
Street (% 808-661-1178; www.leispa.com), which carries a wonderful
line of fragrant and rejuvenating Hawaii-made bath and body products,
and therapists offer massages, body wraps, and facials.
For the ultimate in Upcountry relaxation, contact Maui Spa Retreat
(% 808-573-8002; www.mauisparetreat.com). Boasting a majestic
perch on the slopes of Haleakala, this hidden gem can reward you with
one of the finest spa days you’ll ever enjoy. The petite spa is also an aro-
matherapy farm, and the proprietor blends all of her own body scrubs,
wraps, and healing oils. If you book the spa as a couple, you’ll have it all
to yourself; I recommend a three-hour spa package for two, which
includes private use of the outdoor spa, sauna, and outdoor showers. A
divine day spent here is like having your own private spa, and pampering
at the hands of the finest therapists on the island. If you are a spa aficio-
nado, don’t miss it.
Shopping the Local Stores
When it comes to shopping opportunities, the Valley Isle is the reigning
king among the neighbor islands in terms of quantity. Its status is a bit
more dubious when it comes to quality, but you will find some real gems
in the eclectic mix.
Central Maui: Wailuku and Kahului
Although Kahului is the island’s hub and the place to go for practical
items, the historic town of Wailuku, immediately to the west, offers rea-
sonably good hunting grounds for antiques hounds. It’s still a mixed bag,
but a few quality shops featuring both new and used treasures can be
found on North Market Street. To get there, simply go west from Kahului
on Kaahumanu Avenue and turn right when you reach Market, in the
heart of Wailuku.
Highlights include Brown-Kobayashi, 38 N. Market St. (% 808-242-0804),
a treasure-trove of graceful Asian antiques (mostly large pieces, but afford-
able prices make the shipping worth it for committed collectors); and
Bird of Paradise Unique Antiques, 54 N. Market St. (% 808-242-7699), a
jumble of collectible glassware, pottery, and Hawaiiana.
If you’re in the mood for a little island music, Mele Ukulele, before the old
Wailuku bridge at 1750 Kaahumanu Ave. (% 808-244-3938; www.mele
ukulele.com), carries Hawaii’s largest selection of new and used ukes.
Part IV: Maui 
306

In Kahului, stop by Hawaiian Island Surf and Sport, 415 Dairy Rd.,
Kahului (% 800-231-6958 or 808-871-4981; www.hawaiianisland.com),
for all of your surfing, body boarding, and water play needs.
West Maui: Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Kapalua
Lahaina’s main drag, Front Street, overflows with surf-wear shops, con-
temporary art galleries, trendy boutiques, cheesy T-shirt shops, and
much, much more — you’ll tire of browsing well before you run out of
places to flex your credit card.
Your best bet is to just start at one end and browse. Highlights include
Serendipity, 752 Front St. (% 808-879-7100; www.serendipitymaui.
com), for casual, island-style women’s wear in comfortable, loose-fitting
styles. Honolua Surf Co., 845 Front St. (% 808-661-8848; www.honolua
surf.com), carries its own fabulous line of surf wear and gear (you’ll
find additional locations in Whalers Village, the Lahaina Cannery Mall,
Kihei, and the Shops at Wailea). Another excellent stop for surf wear and
gear is Tropix, 790 Front St. (% 808-661-9296), Maui’s homegrown surf
company.
Célébrités, 764 Front St. (% 800-428-3338;
www.celebrityfineart.com), features art by and about celebrities. 
It’s the height of over-the-top conspicuous consumption, but it’s a com-
pelling browse nonetheless. Vintage European Posters, 744 Front St. 
(% 808-662-8688; www.europeanposters.com), boasts a fantastic array
of original poster art from 1890 to 1950, mostly European and all in mint
condition; prices are excellent considering the quality of the stock. Also
worth checking out are the vibrant, three-dimensional natural panora-
mas of globetrotting photographer Peter Lik, whose Peter Lik Gallery,
712 Front St. (% 808-661-6623; www.peterlik.com), is definitely worth
a browse.
An island of artistic integrity in the sea of Lahaina kitsch is Na Mea
Hawaii Store, in the Baldwin Home, 120 Dickenson St., at Front Street
(% 808-661-5707), which sells only fine-quality island-made crafts and
gifts. That doesn’t always mean expensive, though; you’ll find a surpris-
ing number of affordable prizes among the bounty.
For marine-themed goods and educational gifts for kids, you can’t do
better than the surprisingly nice nonprofit Pacific Whale Foundation
store, 612 Front St. (% 808-667-7447; www.pacificwhale.org).
Members save 15 percent off all whale- and eco-themed goodies, as well
as whale-watching cruises and snorkel tours, which can be booked right
at the shop (see the section “Ocean cruising to Molokini and Lanai and
other on-deck adventures,” earlier in this chapter), so consider joining
up for a good cause.
Old Lahaina Book Emporium, 834 Front St. (% 808-661-1399; www.
oldlahainabookemporium.com), is a wonderful haunt for used and new
fiction, nonfiction, music, and videos.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 307

At the opposite, north end of Front Street are a couple of shopping 
centers, including Lahaina Cannery Mall, 1221 Honoapiilani Hwy. 
(% 808-661-5304; www.lahainacannerymall.com), for practicals. 
The Lahaina Center, 900 Front St. (% 808-667-9216; www.lahaina
center.com), is a pleasant open-air mall that boasts Hilo Hattie,
Hawaii’s biggest name in affordable aloha wear, and a multiscreen movie
theater — perfect for rainy days. Newest on the scene is Lahaina
Gateway (% 808-893-0300; www.lahainagateway.com), a sprawling
new complex on the highway featuring such big names as Barnes &
Noble and Outback Steakhouse.
On the beach in Kaanapali, Whalers Village, 2435 Kaanapali Pkwy. 
(% 808-661-4567; www.whalersvillage.com), has blossomed into
quite an upscale shopping and dining complex, offering a surprisingly
appealing open-air shopping experience (after you get past the ordeal of
parking). Although it has become the Rodeo Drive of Maui in recent
years, with several high-end designer names, it also has some surpris-
ingly excellent midrange boutiques. You’ll find two branches of Honolua
Surf Co., which I just love for stylish surf gear and wear; Sandal Tree,
for an excellent collection of women’s footwear, sun hats, and handbags;
a branch of Reyn’s, for gorgeous, contemporary aloha wear; Martin &
MacArthur, for island crafts; Lahaina Printsellers, for antique prints,
maps, and engravings; The Body Shop, in case you need to stock up on
eco-friendly sunscreen; and much more.
In Kapalua, stop by the freshly renovated Honolua Store, 502 Office Rd.
(% 808-665-9105), the resort’s beloved plantation store, a lone holdover
from when this region grew sugar cane and pineapple rather than golfers
and sunbathers. In business since 1929, the new Honolua Store has
recaptured its vintage feel, marrying it with an ultra-modern selection of
wine and locally made gourmet food and gift products. There are also an
espresso bar and plate lunch counter.
South Maui: Wailea
The lovely open-air Shops at Wailea, 3750 Wailea Alanui Dr. (% 808-
891-6770; www.shopsatwailea.com), features both practical retailers
and elegant gift outlets. Stores run the gamut from Tiffany & Co., Louis
Vuitton, and Gucci to Gap and Banana Republic. Specialty stores worth
seeking out include Footprints for an excellent selection of sandals for
men, women, and children; Martin & MacArthur for handcrafted koa
and other Hawaii crafts; Blue Ginger, which has brought batik into the
21st century with its bold prints and flowing modern cuts; Tommy
Bahama’s Emporium, whose tropically sophisticated clothing store also
boasts a winning oceanview cafe and bar (see Chapter 12); and much
more.
Off the beaten path: Paia and Makawao
The hip little surf town of Paia (pa-ee-ah), just 15 minutes east of Kahului
on the Hana Highway (Highway 36), makes an appealing stop for shop-
pers looking for funkier goods. The boutiques sprawl in a T shape from
Part IV: Maui 
308

the intersection of the Hana Highway and Baldwin Avenue, and the
choices range from the sublime to the ridiculous.
Some highlights include Maui Crafts Guild, on the ocean side of Hana
Highway at no. 43 (% 808-579-9697; www.mauicraftsguild.com), an
artist-owned cooperative that represents some of the finest fine artists
and craftspeople on Maui; you’ll find artworks and gifts in all price ranges
here. Moonbow Tropics, at 20 and 36 Baldwin Ave. (% 800-541-9446,
808-579-8775, or 808-579-8592; www.moonbowtropicsmaui.com), offers
the finest contemporary aloha-wear lines available.
Also on the Hana Highway, across the street from Maui Hands at no. 83,
is Tamara Catz (% 808-579-9184; www.tamaracatz.com), the first bou-
tique from the Argentine-born, New York–educated Catz, who is married
to world windsurfing champ Francisco Goya. The designer specializes in
sleek, sexy fashion with a feminine flair for confident women who love
body-conscious wear, and has launched Paia as a burgeoning hub of 
cutting-edge chic in the islands.
From Paia, drive toward the mountain on Baldwin Avenue (Highway 390),
and in 7 miles you’ll reach Makawao (ma-ka-wow), a cowboy town turned
New Age village that’s another shopper’s paradise, especially in the local
arts category. Highlights include The Courtyard, at 3620 Baldwin Ave.,
which houses a number of interesting crafts shops of varying quality,
including Maui Hands (% 808-572-5194; www.mauihands.com) — plus a
fascinating glass blower’s studio that’s worth a peek: Hot Island Glass
Studio & Gallery (% 808-572-4527; www.hotislandglass.com).
The true gem of Makawao is the Hui Noeau Visual Arts Center, a mile out-
side of town at 2841 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-572-6560; www.huinoeau.com).
A tree-lined driveway leads to the 1917 estate (designed by noted Hawaii
architect C. W. Dickey) that houses the island’s most renowned artists’
collective and features rotating exhibits by both established and up-and-
coming island artists, plus an excellent shop featuring original works.
There’s a $2 suggested donation for the exhibit gallery. The artistically
inclined among you might also want to inquire about workshops, demon-
strations, visiting-artist events, and other short-term opportunities for
study.
Living It Up after Dark
Many of the island’s restaurants do double-duty as post-dinner hot
spots, often hosting lively bar scenes, live music, and dancing. The epi-
center of island nightlife is lively Lahaina.
For the most complete calendar of what’s happening while you’re on
Maui, pick up a copy of the weekly MauiTime Weekly newspaper, avail-
able for free at kiosks all over the island. If you’re after the more refined
performing arts, look for a copy of Centerpiece, the free bimonthly maga-
zine published by the Maui Arts & Cultural Center; hotel concierges
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 309

usually have copies. You can also call the center, located in Kahului, at
% 808-242-7469 or visit the Web site at www.mauiarts.org for a cur-
rent schedule. The diverse calendar might feature big names like Melissa
Etheridge or David Sanborn; Maui Film Festival screenings; or perform-
ances by Hawaii’s most renowned musicians (don’t miss Amy Hanaialii
Gilliom if she’s on the calendar).
The island’s best sunset cruises are offered by Paragon Sailing Charters
(% 800-441-2087 or 808-244-2087; www.sailmaui.com). Prices for this
two-hour sail, which include hors d’oeuvres and beverages, are $56 for
adults, $39 for kids under age 12, but significant discounts are available
for online advance bookings.
And, of course, don’t forget that Maui is home to the finest examples of
the ultimate island form of after-dark entertainment: the luau! I highly
recommend planning to participate in one while you’re on the Valley
Isle. For details, see Chapter 12.
West Maui
All Lahaina takes on a festive atmosphere as sunset nears. The restau-
rants along oceanfront Front Street boast stellar views and energetic bar
scenes, some with live music. Among the best are Cheeseburger in
Paradise, 811 Front St. (% 808-661-4855), a regular forum for live-and-
lively music; Hard Rock Cafe, 900 Front St. (% 808-667-7400); Kimo’s,
845 Front St. (% 808-661-4811); and Moose McGillycuddy’s, 844 Front
St. (% 808-891-8600). Mulligan’s on the Wharf, upstairs at the Wharf
Cinema Center in the heart of town, on Front Street across from the
banyan tree (% 808-661-8881; www.mulligansontheblue.com), offers
rollicking live music in its casual Irish pub setting.
Lahaina is also home to two nightly shows that are well worth seeking out.
Don’t pass up an opportunity to see ’Ulalena, at the Maui Myth & Magic
Theatre, in Old Lahaina Center, 878 Front St. (% 877-688-4800 or
808-661-9913; www.ulalena.com). This incredible, Broadway-quality 75-
minute live show interweaves the natural, historical, and mythological
tales of the birth of Hawaii, using a mix of original contemporary music and
dance, ancient chant and hula, creative lighting, gorgeous costumes, and
visual artistry (including some mind-blowing puppets). Shows run 6:30
p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; additional shows may be added in high
season. Tickets are $60 to $100 for adults, $40 to $70 for kids ages 3 to 12.
For something completely different, spend an evening at Warren &
Annabelle’s, 900 Front St. in Lahaina (% 808-667-6244; www.hawaii
magic.com). This genuinely fun and surprisingly uncheesy mystery-and-
magic cocktail show stars illusionist Warren Gibson and “Annabelle,” a
ghost who plays a grand piano — and even takes requests. Tickets are
$56 per person (with food and drinks available for an additional charge);
you must be at least 21 to enter. Dinner packages range from $95 per
person. The show is very popular, so book at least a few days in advance
Part IV: Maui 
310

to avoid disappointment; no shows performed on Sundays. Inquire
about early-evening family-friendly shows, which are sometimes added
during major school-holiday periods; call for details.
Kaanapali has its own family-friendly entertainment as well. Kupanaha is
the terrific magic show at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel (% 808-667-0128;
www.kbhmaui.com/recreation/kupanaha.html), starring husband-
and-wife illusionists Jody and Kathleen Baran and their daughters,
Katrina and Crystal. The show interweaves illusions, Hawaiian hula and
chant, and the stories and myths of ancient Hawaii into a show that the
whole family will love (really!). Shows are offered Tuesday through
Saturday at the family-friendly hour of 4:45 p.m.; dinner is included, and
you’ll be out by 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $79 to $89 for adults, $55 for teens
13 to 20, $39 for kids 6 to 12, including a three-course dinner; a kids’
menu is available. Free for kids under age 6.
For live music in Kaanapali, head to Whalers Village, on Kaanapali
Beach at 2435 Kaanapali Pkwy., where you can take an open-air seat
facing the ocean at the bar at Hula Grill (% 808-667-6636), which fea-
tures Hawaiian music and hula. With Tiki torches flickering and the
waves rolling in, you can’t go wrong here.
In Napili, the Napili Kai Beach Resort hosts the Masters of Hawaiian
Slack Key Guitar series (www.slackkey.com) every Wednesday evening.
These concerts are a great way to learn more about Hawaiian music and
culture. For reservations, call % 888-669-3858 or 808-669-3858. Tickets
are $45.
South Maui
South Maui is a tad quieter overall, but boasts a couple of hopping
joints; call for schedules because the music can change nightly. Lively
Life’s a Beach, 1913 S. Kihei Rd. (next to Foodland), Kihei (% 808-
891-8010; www.mauibars.com), serves up live music nightly, usually
starting at 10 p.m.
The casual, easygoing South Shore Tiki Lounge, in Kihei Kalama Village,
1913 S. Kihei Rd. (% 808-874-6444; www.southshoretikilounge.com),
specializes in first-class mai tais and affordable food in a fun ’n’ funky
Tiki setting; DJs set a party atmosphere most nights.
In the mood for a taste o’ the Emerald Isle while you’re on the Valley
Isle? Head on over to Mulligan’s on the Blue, 100 Kauhaki St., on the
Wailea Blue Golf Course off Wailea Alanui Drive, across from the
Fairmont Kea Lani (% 808-874-1131; www.mulligansontheblue.com).
Mulligan’s is an genuine Irish pub, complete with Guinness on tap, tradi-
tional pub fare, and seven TVs complete with satellite sports channels,
plus the kind of panoramic ocean view that only Maui can offer.
Pubgoers enjoy high-quality live music nightly, with a Celtic spin on
Sundays.
Chapter 13: Exploring Maui 311

Upcountry Maui
One of the hottest party spots on the island is Upcountry, in the cowboy
town of Makawao. The party never ends at the Italian restaurant
Casanova, 1188 Makawao Ave. (% 808-572-0220; www.casanovamaui.
com). After the dinner hour on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (plus
the occasional Thurs and Sun), attention turns from the good Italian
food to socializing around the stage and dance floor. Wednesday is tradi-
tionally a ladies’ night disco, Fridays and Saturdays bring DJs or live
music; expect good blues, rock, reggae, jazz, Hawaiian, and the top
names in local and visiting entertainment, which generally starts at 9:45
p.m. and continues to 1:30 a.m.

Part V
Hawaii, the 
Big Island

In this part . . .
T
he island of Hawaii isn’t known as the Big Island for noth-
ing. Measuring 4,038 square miles and roughly the size of
Connecticut, the Big Island is more than twice the size of all
the other islands combined. You’ll do plenty of driving here if
you plan to explore the island’s many attractions — and I hope
that you do. This thrilling island is the land of salt-and-pepper
beaches, active lava ﬂows, and tropical rain forests. The chap-
ters in this part help you make the most of your time in this
uniquely enchanting place.

A
t 4,038 square miles, the Big Island really is big. Not only that, but a
handful of volcanic mountains dominate the interior, making cross-
ing from coast to coast a challenge, to say the least. If you want to visit all
the Big Island’s major attractions, I strongly suggest that you choose not
one but two places to stay while you’re here: one on the hot, arid Kona-
Kohala coast, and the other on the lush, rain-forested volcano coast.
You can stay just on the Kona side of the island and visit Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park on a day trip. It makes for a very long day, how-
ever: It takes at least three hours to reach the park from anywhere on
the western coast.
If you’re planning to visit both sides of the island, here’s a way to cut
down on driving time and maximize sightseeing (or relaxation) time. I
suggest that you fly in to one side of the island and fly out on the other.
Either land at Kona and fly out of Hilo, or vice versa — it really doesn’t
matter. Doing so may cost you about 50 bucks in car-rental drop-off
charges, but can save an extra 3- to 31⁄2-hour drive to return to the coast
you started from for your outbound flight, not to mention the cost of
gas. Do note that the Hilo airport only accommodates interisland flights;
if you want to take a flight to or from the mainland to the Big Island,
you’ll have to do so from Kona.
Arriving on the West Side at Kona Airport
Kona International Airport at Keahole (% 808-329-3423; www.state.
hi.us/dot/airports/hawaii/koa) is located 7 miles north of Kailua-
Kona, just off Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19). Kona is served
direct by an increasing number of flights from the mainland; interisland
service is provided by Hawaiian Airlines and go! Airlines. This small,

open-air airport is a breeze to navigate. The major rental-car companies
have service counters directly across the street, but you’ll have to take a
shuttle van to a nearby off-site lot to pick up your car.
While you’re at the rental counter, be sure to pick up a map booklet from
the agent; they’re invaluable for getting around the island. They often
include money-saving coupons for attractions as well.
If you’re heading to the town of Kailua-Kona, turn right out of the airport
onto Queen Kaahumanu (ka-a-hoo-ma-noo) Highway (Highway 19).
Clearly marked turnoffs take you down to the town’s main drag, Alii (ah-
lee-ee) Drive, about 7 miles to the south. If you’re continuing on to South
Kona or Keauhou (kay-a-ho), stay on Highway 19 for another 7 or so
miles; for Keauhou, turn toward the coast on Kamehameha III Road.
If you’re heading to a Kohala Coast resort, turn left out of the airport
onto Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19) and proceed to one of
the following locations:
 Kaupulehu (cow-poo-lay-hoo), home to the Four Seasons Hualalai
and Kona Village, is 7 miles north of the airport, or a ten-minute
drive.
 Waikoloa (why-ko-lo-ah), home to the Waikoloa Beach Marriott, the
Hilton Waikoloa Village, and some very nice luxury condos, is 18
miles north, or a 20- to 25-minute drive.
 Mauna Lani, home to the Fairmont Orchid, the Mauna Lani Bay
Hotel and Bungalows, and its own great slate of condo resorts, is
about 23 miles north, or a half-hour drive.
 Mauna Kea has its entrance 28 miles north of the airport, or a 40-
minute drive.
Look for the gateway to your resort on the ocean side of the road; the only
one that’s on the right side of the road is the turnoff for the Hapuna Beach
Prince Hotel, just before Mauna Kea’s entrance. The resort entrances tend
to be marked in a rather understated way, so look carefully.
If you’re staying at one of the Kohala Coast resorts and don’t need a
rental car for your entire stay, you can usually arrange for the resort
shuttle to pick you up at the airport. Then you can arrange to have a
rental car delivered to your hotel only on the day(s) you need it. Call the
concierge at your hotel for details before you arrive.
Taxis are also readily available at the airport, so you don’t need to
arrange for one in advance. If you prefer to, try Kona Airport Taxi
(% 808-329-7779) for personal service. Expect the cost to be about $30
to Kailua-Kona, closer to $60 if you’re heading to one of the Kohala Coast
resorts. You can also prearrange airport transfers with SpeediShuttle
(% 877-521-2085 or 808-329-5433; www.speedishuttle.com). If you
forgot to call SpeediShuttle before you left home, dial “65” from one of
the courtesy phones in baggage claim.

If you prefer to have a private car service transport you to your Kohala
Coast resort in style, contact Luana Limousine (% 800-999-4001 or
808-326-5466; www.luanalimo.com); prices are competitive with taxi
rates. Be sure to call a couple of days before you leave home to arrange
pickup, and check on current rates to your destination.
Arriving on the East Side at Hilo Airport
Hilo (hee-low) International Airport (% 808-934-5840 or 808-934-5838;
www.state.hi.us/dot/airports/hawaii/ito) is 2 miles east of
downtown Hilo, at the junction of Kamehameha Avenue and Kanoelehua
Avenue (Highway 11). It is primarily served by interisland flights on
Hawaiian Airlines and go! Airlines.
Step outside and proceed straight to the rental-car desk. The cars are
parked right outside — no rental-car bus to navigate. Be sure to pick up
a map booklet at the rental counter.
If you’re staying in Hilo, turn right out of the airport onto Kanoelehua
Avenue (Highway 11), which will lead you right to Banyan Drive and the
Hilo Hawaiian and Hawaii Naniloa hotels. To reach downtown and the
waterfront, turn left onto Kamehameha Avenue just before Banyan Drive.
If you’re heading to Volcano Village, turn left out of the airport onto
Kanoelehua Avenue (Highway 11). Highway 11 will take you the 27 miles
(a 45-minute or so drive) to Volcano Village, at the entrance of Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park.
If you’re staying in Pahoa, turn left out of the airport onto Kanoelehua
Avenue (Highway 11), and follow Highway 11 to the Keaau-Pahoa Road
(Highway 130); expect a 20-mile, half-hour drive, depending on your ulti-
mate destination.
Taxis line up at the airport’s curb, so you don’t have to worry about
arranging for one in advance. Expect to pay around $15 to a Hilo desti-
nation, plus tip. If you need to call a taxi, phone up Shaka Taxi & Tours
(% 808-987-1111).
Choosing Your Location
The west, or Kona, side of the Big Island is the hot, arid, beachy side,
where all the island resorts and condos are located. The misty, luxuri-
antly green east side is home to the pretty, petite city of Hilo and spec-
tacular Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
On the west (Kona) side
This hot, dry, almost-always-sunny side of the island is where you go
when you want to hit the beach. West Hawaii may come as a shock to
some — this is parched, black-lava–covered land fringed by swaying
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 319

palms, salt-and-pepper sand, and gorgeous Pacific waves. Still, it’s a
landscape of dramatic, otherworldly beauty. This side is where you’ll
find some of Hawaii’s most gorgeous beaches (and some of the state’s
most expensive real estate).
The Kohala Coast
This ritzy resort coast stretches for about 30 miles north from Kona
International Airport. This is where you’ll find the island’s most stunning
beaches — it’s no coincidence that the most upscale resorts chose to
build here. No other resort coast in Hawaii boasts luxury spreads this
sprawling or fabulously grand; sadly, you won’t find many budget-
friendly options here. Every hotel along the Kona-Kohala coast is part of
a manicured “resort” development — Kaupulehu (cow-poo-lay-hoo),
Waikoloa, Mauna Lani, and Mauna Kea, in order, from south to north.
Each one functions something like a neighborhood, usually encompass-
ing two resort hotels, upscale residential developments, and golf
courses. Each resort has a clearly marked gateway off Queen
Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19, the coast’s main drag) and its own
network of roads, plus public beach access. Waikoloa and Mauna Lani
boast their own sizable shopping and restaurant complexes.
When you’re making your resort decision, take distance into considera-
tion if you’re planning to do lots of running around. Mauna Kea is at least
a 30-minute drive from the airport and 40 or 45 minutes from Kailua-
Kona town, which can make popping into town for dinner more work
than you’d like. Kaupulehu (where the Four Seasons and Kona Village
resort hotels are), on the other hand, is only about 10 or 15 minutes
from Kailua-Kona and just 7 miles from the airport.
Kailua-Kona
About 7 miles south of Kona International Airport, the town Kailua-Kona
is the commercial hub of the island’s west side. It’s similar to Maui’s
Lahaina, down to the tacky-touristy shopping and open-air restaurants
along Alii (ah-lee-ee) Drive that open to spectacular ocean views. Kailua-
Kona is a convenient and affordable place to stay, with lots of condo bar-
gains. But the town has been changing in the past few years, with T-shirt
shops, chain restaurants, and generic bars proliferating. The town has
lost the sleepy, funky charm you’d expect in Hawaii, and traffic has
become a bear, especially during the afternoon rush hour, in town and
on the adjacent stretch of highway.
If you stay here, you’ll have a convenient base for dining, nightlife, and
shopping, but you’ll have to drive to get to a decent beach. Choose one
of the condo complexes south of town if you want better ocean access,
great snorkeling, and a respite from crowds and noise. For a truly spec-
tacular beach, you’ll have to drive north to the Kohala Coast.
Upcountry Kona
Drive 15 minutes inland and upland from Kailua-Kona, and you’ll
enter a whole different world. Lush, green, cool, and quiet, this is 
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
320

the world-famous Kona coffee country. Charmingly funky Holualoa
has, blessedly, retained the unadulterated vibe of old Hawaii. The vil-
lage serves as a great alternative to the beach resorts if you’re looking
to get away from it all. Views are spectacular, the streets are lined with
local art galleries housed in restored plantation cottages, and you won’t
hear much but bird song and the sound of the tropical fruit growing on
the trees. It’s an excellent choice for off-the-beaten-path types.
South Kona
A ten-minute drive south of Kailua-Kona town is South Kona, a signifi-
cantly more relaxed and lush territory than Kona central. It’s very con-
venient for dining, shopping, and activities, but it’s much more sedate,
with a handful of nice hotels and condo complexes, plus an excellent
B&B on the slope above the coast, Horizon Guest House (see listing
later in this chapter).
You’ll have wonderful sunset ocean views no matter where you stay in
South Kona. However, this stretch of coast has mostly salt-and-pepper
pocket beaches, and they tend to be located close to the busy main
road. Despite this drawback, South Kona beaches do offer some of the
island’s best offshore snorkeling, and you’re significantly closer to
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park than you are if you stay farther north on
the coast. If you want a truly fantastic beach, you will have some driving
to do — it’s a good hour to the Kohala Coast from here, and traffic can
be a trial sometimes.
The east (volcano) side
The east side of the Big Island seems like the polar opposite of the Kona
side — it’s cool, wet, rain-forested, and fragrant with tropical flowers
(the Big Island is also known as the Orchid Isle). However, independent
types tend to love its genuine local charm and sense of discovery. Stay
on this side of the island if you want to dedicate some time to exploring
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, but expect a whole different kind of
island experience here.
Volcano Village
The gateway to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is Volcano Village, a net-
work of charming B&Bs and vacation rentals tucked into the rain forest
just outside the park’s gate. Needless to say, Volcano Village makes the
best base for exploring the park, but you’ll have limited dining and shop-
ping options in this postage stamp–size crossroads.
Hilo
Hawaii’s largest city after Honolulu embodies Hawaii the way it used to
be: It’s a quaint, misty, flower-filled city with a gorgeous half-moon bay, a
rustic false-fronted downtown, some beautifully restored Victorian
houses, and a real penchant for rain — 128 inches a year makes it one of
America’s wettest cities. Not everybody loves Hilo, but those of us with
a passion for anything retro do. It’s just 30 minutes from the national
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 321

park and offers more dining options, not to mention delightful off-the-
beaten-path shopping. B&B lovers will delight in the city’s top-notch
choices.
Puna District: Pahoa
Want the best of both worlds — the hot, dry, island-style weather you
expect, with easy access to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park? Consider
this off-the-beaten-path region between Hilo and Volcano. It’s not for
everyone; there are no tourist services to speak of. The scruffy, offbeat
town of Pahoa is still rough around the edges, but a tiny handful of good-
quality restaurants and stylish shops have popped up of late. At this
writing, the Puna District offered the island’s easiest access to Kilauea’s
current lava flow, which was spilling into the ocean at the end of the
road in Kalapana; national park officials had set up a temporary viewing
area to accommodate visitors. However, this could change at any
moment (see the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park listing in Chapter 15
for details on checking current flow conditions). Puna’s best place to
stay is the charming, well-run Coconut Cottage Bed & Breakfast (see
listing later in this chapter).
Upcountry: Waimea
This old Upcountry cowboy town on the northern road between the
coasts is nestled in lovely country: rolling green pastures, big wide-open
spaces dotted by puu (hills), and real Marlboro-smoking cowpokes who
ride mammoth Parker Ranch, Hawaii’s largest working cattle ranch. It’s
home to a good number of affordable B&Bs and vacation rentals. It also
achieves a nice balance of creature comforts (Starbucks, for example)
and ranch-country charm. Although the beach is about a half-hour away
and Upcountry weather can be cloudier than it is on the coast, Waimea
offers the pleasant advantage of being centrally positioned between the
island’s Kona and Volcano coasts, but the disadvantage of not really
being close to anything. One upside? Some very good dining.
Driving Around the Big Island
You will need a rental car on the Big Island. Not having one will leave you
dependent on what your resort has to offer — or worse, relegate you to
the confines of touristy Kailua-Kona. Distances on this island are just 
too long to rely on taxis. An island-wide bus system, the Hele-On Bus
(% 808-961-8744; www.co.hawaii.hi.us; click on “Hele-On Bus
Schedule”), is available, but all it really does is transport passengers
(mostly locals) between the Kona-Kohala coast and Hilo.
All the major car-rental firms have cars available at both island airports.
Arrange for one before you arrive; otherwise, you may find yourself
paying top dollar at the airport counter (or run the risk of not getting a
car at all if their inventory is depleted).
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
322

If your heart’s set on some heavy-duty exploring along the Saddle Road,
up to the summit of Mauna Kea, or to the southernmost tip of the island
(which is also the southernmost point in the United States), you’ll need
a four-wheel-drive vehicle. For more information, see the upcoming
information on Saddle and South Point roads.
If you’re not going to rent a car, contact your hotel concierge or condo
front desk and ask about local shuttle services. A few shuttles cover the
Kailua-Kona area and the South Kona coast. In addition, most of the
Kona-Kohala coast resorts offer free resort shuttles that transport
guests within the resort, to golf courses, neighboring hotels, shopping
and dining complexes, and any other nearby facilities.
For transportation around Kailua-Kona and down to Keauhou, in South
Kona, catch a ride on the Alii Shuttle, which travels up and down Alii
Drive between Kailua-Kona’s Kailua Pier to Keauhou, roughly every 11⁄2
hours Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. If you plan
to use the shuttle service, ask your hotel concierge or accommodations
booking agent for current details and proximity to the shuttle route from
your accommodations.
It’s pretty hard to get lost on the Big Island. It has only a handful of main
roads, all of which basically stick to the perimeter of the island.
The most important thing to keep in mind is the island’s sheer size —
they don’t call it the Big Island for nothing. Driving from coast to coast
takes 3 to 31⁄2 hours; circling the entire island takes between six and
seven hours. Distances are often longer than they might seem on a map,
so be sure that you have a realistic idea of how far you need to travel
before you set out. The concierge or the front-desk staff of your hotel or
condo should be able to help you out.
If you arrive at Kona Airport, the first of the Big Island’s main highways
that you’ll encounter is Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19),
which runs along the Kona-Kohala coast for 33 miles, from Kailua-Kona at
the south to the industrial port of Kawaihae at the north. All the major
Kohala Coast resorts and beaches are accessible from this main coastal
highway.
The Big Island has one main highway that circles the island: the Hawaii
Belt Road, also known as the Mamalahoa Highway, which is labeled
Highway 11 as it runs south from the sunny, arid resort town of Kailua-
Kona around the island’s southern tip (a 60-mile drive); another 36
miles through Volcano (gateway to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park);
and then about 27 miles north to Hilo, a misty, funky-cool bayfront town
that’s the second-largest city in the state (after Honolulu). Go north
from Hilo, and the road becomes Highway 19 as it travels north along
the misty and ruggedly beautiful Hamakua Coast, then west to the
upland cowboy town of Waimea, the heart of the Big Island’s ranchland,
for a total of 54 miles.
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 323

In Waimea, Highway 19 continues directly west, connecting up with the
north end of the coastal Queen Kaahumanu Highway, which runs down
the Kohala Coast. This roughly 10-mile stretch of east–west road con-
necting Waimea and the industrial port of Kawaihae (ka-why-high) is
called Kawaihae Road.
An interior road offers a more direct route between Waimea and Kailua-
Kona: The continuation of the Hawaii Belt Road (Mamalahoa Highway) is
Highway 190, a scenic “upper” road that cuts along the western slope of
Mauna Kea back to the coast, meeting up with the Queen Kaahumanu
Highway (Highway 19) right in Kailua-Kona — thus completing the loop.
One more road links east to west: The Saddle Road (Highway 200) is so
named because it crosses the “saddle” between Mauna Kea and Mauna
Loa volcanoes as it runs from Highway 190 south of Waimea direct to
Hilo; from this road, you can take the access road to the 14,000-odd–foot
summit of Mauna Kea. Your rental-car agreement will most likely
demand that you avoid the Saddle Road because it’s rough and narrow,
and the ever-changing weather conditions can be tough to handle (not
to mention the locals, who drive like bats out of hell between Hilo and
the Kona Coast along this road). So don’t take it; stick to the main high-
ways instead. You’re also supposed to stay away from South Point
Road, the road that runs from the Mamalahoa Road at the south end of
the island directly south, to the southernmost point in the United States.
Although this road is less treacherous, you’re best off avoiding it in
order to honor the built-in restrictions on your rental-car contract.
If you plan to take on the Saddle Road or the South Point Road, or both, I
suggest renting a four-wheel-drive SUV — and check your rental contract
first before setting out. If you disregard any disclaimer or restriction in
your contract and get stuck on a forbidden road, and your rental-car com-
pany then sticks you with a massive tow bill, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Also stay off of the steeply graded Waipio Valley Road, at the north end of
the Hamakua Coast, which isn’t meant for cars — you will get stuck here.
For a more complete discussion of the major resort areas as well as Hilo
and Volcano, check out the section “Choosing Your Location,” earlier in
this chapter. If you drive north from the intersection of the Kohala
Coast’s Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Kawaihae Road, you’ll enter
North Kohala, the peninsula that extends off the northern end of the
island. The drive north along the Akoni Pule (ah-ko-nee poo-lay)
Highway (Highway 270) offers a peek at a different side of the Big Island,
one where lava cedes to gorgeous rolling ranchlands. It’s a beautiful
hour-long drive that leads to some wonderful wilderness activities that I
discuss in detail in Chapter 15. You can circle back from the town of
Hawi (ha-vee) at North Kohala’s tip along the Kohala Mountain Road
(Highway 250), ending up back on the Kawaihae Road just west of
Waimea.

Staying in Style
The Big Island’s best accommodations
In the following listings, each property is followed by a number of dollar
signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). Each represents the median
rack-rate price range for a double room per night, as follows:
$
Cheap — less than $150 per night
$$
Still affordable — $150–$225
$$$
Moderate — $225–$325
$$$$
Expensive but not ridiculous — $325–$450
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious — more than $450 per night
Remember that you almost never need to pay the asking price for a
hotel room. Check out Chapter 7 for tips on how to avoid paying for a
full-price hotel room. Also see Chapter 5 for advice on how to score an
all-inclusive package that can save you big bucks on both accommoda-
tions and airfare, and, sometimes, car rentals and activities too.
Also, don’t forget that the state adds 11.42 percent in taxes to your hotel
bill.
Coconut Cottage Bed & Breakfast
$
Puna District (Pahoa)
This darling bed-and-breakfast is a wonderful addition to the Big Island
accommodations scene. You don’t have to be a budget traveler to enjoy this
stylish and comfortable place, whose creature comforts and service sur-
pass what you’d expect at this price point. The low rates come courtesy of
the off-the-beaten-path location, which is within 20 miles or so of both Hilo
and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park but lacks traditional tourist services.
Innkeepers Jerry and Todd are recent refugees from Orange County, CA, but
they have made themselves right at home in this authentic, unspoiled area
of the islands. They’ve imbued their charming yellow cottage with Tommy
Bahama–inspired style and a dash of vintage whimsy. The gorgeous gardens
and hot tub, housed under a grass-roofed gazebo, add a resortlike feeling.
Three charming and comfortable guest rooms are located in the main
house. Even the smallest is spacious, pretty, and well outfitted, with plush
bedding, warm island-themed decor, a minifridge with complimentary bot-
tled water, waffle-weave robes, a TV with DVD player (plus full access to
the extensive DVD library), access to either a private or shared lanai, and
its own private bathroom; the only caveat is that the one for the Royal
Hibiscus room is across the hall, but I didn’t find it to be a problem when
I stayed there. The separate Garden Bungalow adds a kitchenette with 
full-size fridge and microwave to the list of amenities, plus a sleeper sofa.
There’s no air-conditioning, but it isn’t needed most of the time. The

The Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii
$$$$–$$$$$
Kohala Coast
This elegant, attractive, and thoroughly appealing beach resort boasts gor-
geous views and some of the best extras on the coast. The sports facili-
ties are extensive (championship golf, tennis, catamaran rides, and
outrigger canoe trips), the oceanside “Spa Without Walls” is as stress-
relieving as they come, and the heated oceanfront pool and hot tubs are
Tiki-torchlit for maximum romance at night. The resort also offers a wealth
of outdoor activities and an excellent Hawaiian program for culture buffs.
Brown’s Beach House is the coast’s most romantic restaurant (see the sec-
tion “Dining Out,” later in this chapter); and eight other bars and restau-
rants are on the property, including Norio’s, a terrific sushi bar and
restaurant. The spacious rooms are more boldly colorful than most, with
an eye-catching palette, comfy furnishings, and large marble bathrooms.
The beach is small but pretty and perfect for well-serviced lounging, snor-
keling, and kids at play.
All in all, the Orchid is a tad less opulent and significantly more intimate
in size and ambience than other Big Island resorts. The service is top-
notch, and even employees at competing resorts admit that the Orchid’s
concierge staff is the island’s best. The only downside is the building’s U
shape, which gives most of the rooms courtyard or partial-ocean rather
than full-ocean views; however, the alternative views are also beautiful. On
the Fairmont Gold Floor, guests receive upgraded in-room decor and
amenities, a dedicated lounge with free wireless Internet access, an excel-
lent complimentary breakfast, a complimentary cocktail hour, and delight-

Four Seasons Resort Hualalai
$$$$$
West Side (Kona Coast)
Here it is: the finest luxury resort hotel in the islands, and the Hope dia-
mond of the glittering Four Seasons chain. Island-style elegance simply
doesn’t get any better. Low-rise clusters of clean-lined ocean-facing villas
are nestled between a lovely sandy beach and a fabulous Jack
Nicklaus–designed golf course (for guests only — so start dialing, duffers!).
You’ll want for nothing in the huge, gorgeous, and supremely comfortable

rooms. Each comes dressed in natural hues and materials — including
raffia, rattan, and slate — that set the perfect kick-off-your-shoes Pacific
island ambience. Ground-level rooms even have private outdoor showers
off the big marble bathrooms, so you can shower au naturel under the sun
or stars. Wireless high-speed Internet access is ideal for guests who want
to get away from it all without forsaking complete connectivity. The beau-
tiful beach can be too rough for swimming, but no matter — three ocean-
front pools more than compensate, including a stocked snorkel pond (with
friendly stingrays!) that’s ideal for beginners. An exclusive spa (named by
Condé Nast Traveler as the world’s best resort spa), a state-of-the-art fit-
ness center, and sublime beachfront dining round out the experience.
Superstar Honolulu chef Alan Wong is the lead chef in the delightful club-
house restaurant, Hualalai Grille, my favorite place to dine on the Big
Island (see review later in this chapter). Who could ask for anything more?

Hale Ohia Cottages
$–$$
Volcano
Condé Nast Traveler named Hale Ohia the top place to stay in Volcano in
its February 2004 issue, and the honor is well-deserved. This charming and
tranquil assemblage of suites and cottages offers a wonderful opportunity
to step into the past and get back to nature. The gorgeous red-shingled
1931 estate boasts an impeccable blend of 1930s Hawaii plantation style
and modern-day sophistication. The stunning botanical grounds are the
result of more than 30 years’ work by a master Japanese gardener. All the
accommodations are lovely and comfortable. The Ihilani Cottage is a hon-
eymooner’s dream, with its own enclosed lanai with a bubbling fountain,
and the three-bedroom Hale Ohia Cottage, with its own full kitchen, is a
great deal for families. The transformation of the property’s original red-
wood water tank into Cottage #44, a beautiful and fully outfitted suite
(complete with kitchenette and Jacuzzi tub), adds yet another offbeat
delight to the retro-romantic collection. The massive Master Suite is a steal
if you can snare it. The in-room continental breakfast makes this spot an
excellent choice for privacy seekers. Two private, multibedroom vacation
rentals are available for families; these are a few minutes’ distant from the
main property and do not include breakfast.
At this writing, Hale Ohia’s longtime owner had recently sold this delight-
ful property to new owners, and the jury is still out as to whether things
will change for the better, worse, or not at all. It’s certainly too good an
option to remove from this guide, but I highly recommend that you check
Tripadvisor.com for the latest reader reports before you book.

Hilo Hawaiian Hotel
$$
Hilo
This eight-story waterfront hotel on picturesque Hilo Bay features nice
rooms that do the job at a fair price. It’s generic but is set on a gracious set-
ting on leafy Banyan Drive, and gets props for being one of the few full-
service hotels on this side of the island. There aren’t many facilities, but

you’ll still find a pool and sun deck, a gift shop, a laundromat, and a restau-
rant and lounge here. Pay the few extra bucks for a bay view if you can
swing it; you won’t be disappointed. You almost never have to pay rack
rate here; check online for frequent money-saving Internet specials.

808-545-2163. Parking: Free. Rack rates: $190–$240 double, $270–$405 suite. Check

free-car, free-night, and other special packages. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hilton Waikoloa Village
$$$$
Kohala Coast
With 1,240 rooms spread over 62 acres, this massive hotel is too big for its
own good. Just getting from your room to the lobby is a 15- to 20-minute
production, so check in, park yourself, and don’t be in any hurry to leave.
This is a destination resort of the highest order, Hawaii’s very own version
of Disneyland. Its high-rise towers, water slide–riddled megapools, dolphin
lagoons, and gaggle of restaurants (including the divine Donatoni’s; see the
section “Dining Out,” later in this chapter), bars, and shops are connected
by trams, boats, and art-lined walkways. Thanks to so many eye-popping
diversions, your kids will think that they’ve died and gone to heaven. Mom
and Dad are bound to be entertained, too, thanks to a tremendous spa and
championship golf course — if you don’t run screaming from sensory over-
load first. The rooms are well-appointed, comfortable, and relatively afford-
able considering the level of luxury and the full slate of amenities that you’ll
find here. You won’t find any sandy beach, though; you have to go next door
for that. Stay elsewhere if you won’t enjoy the family-friendly vibe.

Valet parking: $19. Self-parking: $12. Rack rates: $329–$499 double, suites from $589

phone calls, in-room coffee, use of safe, use of spa for 2, and $25 credit toward beach
rental and tennis. Advance-purchase online only rates from $215 at press time. A
range of packages and special offers are usually available, including romance, golf,
and family packages, 7th-night-free deals, and more. Also ask for AAA, AARP, cor-
porate, military, and other discounts. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Holualoa Inn
$$$
Upcountry Kona
Set on 40 pastoral acres on the slopes above Kailua-Kona, in the charm-
ingly artsy town of Holualoa, this impeccable inn offers the ultimate tran-
quil escape, yet it’s also conveniently located just 15 minutes from South
Kona snorkeling and other Kona coast conveniences. Built entirely of
golden woods and outfitted in an understated but elegant Asian-inflected
island style — all clean lines, rattan, and subtle colors — this gorgeous
contemporary Hawaiian home boasts six spacious guest rooms, window-
walls that slide away to reveal stunning panoramic ocean views, and an
easygoing island vibe. (Note that only the Plumeria Suite has an in-room
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
332

TV.) The lovely pool and Jacuzzi overlook a backyard coffee farm and fruit
trees (which supply the morning brew and breakfast papayas) and offer
spectacular views of the coastline below. Nice extras include a gas grill
with all the supplies you need to barbecue a romantic dinner, wonderful
common spaces for dining and lounging, guest laundry, and a labyrinth
and garden trails where you can wander and contemplate your lucky stars
for being here. Even B&B-phobes will feel right at home. As in many island
B&Bs, the owners ask that you follow the Hawaiian custom of removing
your shoes before entering; it preserves their gorgeous eucalyptus floors
and adds to the sense of barefoot elegance.

Horizon Guest House
$$$
South Kona
This impeccable B&B offers the ultimate in luxurious relaxation. The house
is located on 40 acres of lush pastureland at 1,100 feet elevation, offering
unparalleled coastline views. The four carefully designed one-room suites
are cantilevered off the end of the house for maximum privacy. Each has
its own private entry and furnished lanai and is filled with gorgeous island
antiques, hand-quilted Hawaiian bedspreads on the king or queen bed,
minifridge, coffeemaker, and cushy robes. A dramatic 20-by-40-foot infinity
pool (which appears to have no edge) and a romantic hot tub are situated
to take full advantage of the breathtaking views. Guests have free use of
laundry facilities, a gas barbecue grill, and beach toys galore. Much-
beloved innkeeper Clem Classen serves a gourmet buffet breakfast in the
artifact-filled main house, which also features a multimedia room with an
extensive book and video library and a TV with VCR and DVD. Impeccable
personalized service is completely unobtrusive; it’s the elegant finish to
an all-around excellent stay.

The Islands at Mauna Lani
$$$$$
Kohala Coast
If you’re in the market for a two- or three-bedroom condo — be it for a
family, sharing couples, or plenty of spreading-out for yourself — you can’t
do better than the Islands. Light, bright, airy, and gorgeous, these con-
temporary Mediterranean-style town houses boast a massive 2,100 square
feet of living space. On the first floor, you find a gourmet kitchen, full dining
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 333

and living rooms (both with furnished lanais), and a laundry room with full-
size washer and dryer. Upstairs are two (or three) master-size bedrooms,
each with a firm, well-dressed king-size bed, its own furnished lanai, and a
monster bathroom with an oversize Jacuzzi tub and yards of counter space.
Every luxury is at hand, from a cordless phone to a gas grill to daily maid
service to your own garage with automatic door opener. The views of the
lushly manicured grounds and surrounding fairways more than make up
for the lack of ocean vistas. The perks don’t end there. On-site is a very nice
heated pool and hot tub; what’s more, Islands guests can hop the free on-
call shuttle to an exclusive beach club, which boasts its own perfect white-
sand cove, excellent snorkel reef, gear-rental shack, and restaurant. The
shuttle also takes you to and from the Mauna Lani Spa, the island’s best.
Service is excellent but completely nonintrusive. All in all, an excellent
choice, especially when you can score a discounted rate, which is often.

Kilauea Lodge
$$
Volcano
Built in 1938 as a YMCA camp, this popular roadside lodge sits on 10
wooded acres just a stone’s throw from the main gate of the national park.
The lodge is a real woodsy charmer, with stone pillars and beamed ceil-
ings. Twelve comfortably outfitted rooms offer private bathrooms, attrac-
tive artwork by local artists, lovely garden views, and individual heat
controls and towel warmers (nice pluses on chilly Volcano nights). A
phone, a lending library, games, and a TV set for shared viewing are found
in the common room. Two charming cottages are also available, one with
two bedrooms and a full kitchen that’s great for families, plus a pleasant,
newly renovated house on the fairway at the Volcano Golf Course. A com-
plete, satisfying breakfast is served in the restaurant, which is a Volcano
favorite for dinner (see the section “Dining Out,” later in this chapter).
Service is consistently aloha-filled and professional. This is an excellent
choice, especially for those who prefer hotel-style anonymity over the inti-
macy of many of Volcano’s B&B-style stays.

Kailua-Kona
The units aren’t fancy, but it’s hard to do better for the money — and dis-
counts on longer stays make the rooms practically free. The management
company keeps everything neat and reasonably well kept. Each apartment
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
334

has a full kitchen with all-electric appliances, a large lanai, decent (if dated)
furniture, and king-size beds. The one-bedrooms have sliding doors that
allow you to close off the living room to make another bedroom, which
makes them a real deal for penny-saving families. Air-conditioning is avail-
able for $10 a day, but you probably won’t need it with those gentle ocean
breezes. On-site extras include a pool, barbecues, and a coin-op laundry,
and the town is just a walk away. You’ll have to drive to a swimmable
beach, but at these prices, you won’t mind. Beware: The close-to-town
location is terrific for walk-to dining and other conveniences, but it can
mean late-night noise from vacationing revelers. Book well in advance —
this place fills up fast with bargain-hunting travelers.

Kona Tiki Hotel
$
Kailua-Kona
This quirky, friendly family-run motel is one of the best cheap sleeps in the
state. Staying here is like stepping into a time warp — one where you can
have a reasonable room for two, right on the ocean, for as little as $69 —
with breakfast! The rooms are budget-basic on every level, but the beds are
firm and comfy, the paint and carpet are fresh, ceiling fans and minifridges
are on hand (a few have kitchenettes for just a bit more moola), and every
room has a lanai with front-row sunset views over the ocean. A basic con-
tinental breakfast is served poolside every morning, making this incredi-
ble value that much more astounding. The location is pleasant, away from
the hustle and bustle of downtown. It’s hard to stay closer to the waves,
but beware: Some guests find the crashing of the surf more disruptive than
soothing. The ocean here isn’t swimmable, so you’ll have to drive to the
beach; and you’ll find no TVs, phones, or coin-op laundry (a local laundry
will pick up and deliver). But those are the sacrifices you make for such a
bargain. Book way in advance, because people loooove this place.

Kona Village Resort

Kohala Coast
Hawaii may have fancier and more amenity-laden resorts, but the state’s
only all-inclusive is truly something special: a superdeluxe version of
Gilligan’s Island, where it feels perfectly natural to tuck a flower behind
your ear and sip cocktails out of coconuts. This South Seas paradise of
swaying palms and lagoons offers blissful escape, Robinson Crusoe–style:
no TVs, phones, or fax machines around to interrupt your tropical reverie
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 335

for even a minute. You’ll stay in your own thatch-roofed hale, which is much
like a comfortably furnished tropical cabin. The dark-sand beach offers
first-rate snorkeling with green sea turtles, who climb up on shore nearly
every afternoon for a nap; manta rays hang out in the flood-lit bay after
dark, proving that all species love Kona Village. A tenderly attentive staff —
one of the best in the islands — is on hand to meet your needs and desires
even before you know you have them, and the food is abundant and
absolutely terrific at every meal. There’s something going on most nights,
whether it’s dancing to a Hawaiian trio or the terrific Wednesday- and
Friday-night luau (see the section “Luau!” later in this chapter). The kids’
program is excellent, but for three weeks in May and three weeks in
September, the resort is reserved for adults only. Utterly restful, and simply
divine, this resort is Hawaii vacationing as it was really meant to be.

Mauna Lani Bay Hotel & Bungalows
$$$$$
Kohala Coast
Hawaiian elders named this section of the sunny lava coast Mauna Lani, or
“Mountain Reaching Heaven,” and it’s an apt name for so heavenly a resort.
Mauna Lani has a finer swimming and snorkeling beach than any other Big
Island resort hotel. The hotel is designed in the shape of an arrow on the
sands to take advantage of its prime coastal location, providing most rooms
with substantial ocean views. A vast open-air lobby spilling over with tropi-
cal greenery leads to serene and simple rooms that exude island style — teak
floors, lauhala headboards, ceiling fans, natural-hued textiles, and lanais.
VCRs, opposing vanities, seersucker robes, and twice-daily maid service add
a luxury touch. Families can stay in the homelike villas, but those with bot-
tomless bank accounts should opt for one of the incredible bungalows, each
of which has its own private pool and a butler who doesn’t know the word
“no.” The historically and culturally sensitive resort features the finest, most
Hawaiian spa in the islands, an extensive calendar of daily activities, a first-
rate tennis center, and easy access to some of Hawaii’s best golf. One sour
note: Dinner in the celebrated CanoeHouse just isn’t what it used to be.

Outrigger Kanaloa at Kona
$$$
South Kona
Tucked away in a quiet, attractive neighborhood, these big, well-managed
oceanfront condos (by the reliable, value-oriented Hawaii-based Outrigger
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
336

hotel chain) are a cut above the average and ideal for families. Comfortably
furnished in quality island style with Hawaiian wood accents, the apart-
ments have all the comforts of home and then some, including dressing
rooms, big kitchens loaded with appliances, huge bathrooms (with
whirlpools in oceanview suites!), and washer/dryers. Two tennis courts lit
for night play, three swimming pools with hot tubs, and playgrounds dot
the pleasant, attractively manicured ocean-facing grounds. The coast is
lava rock here, however, so you’ll have to drive a half-mile to Kahaluu
Beach (one of Hawaii’s best for snorkeling, though not its loveliest stretch
of sand). A big, modern, well-stocked supermarket is just up the hill, and
Kailua-Kona’s restaurants and shops are a ten-minute drive away. Guests
receive discounted rates on 36 holes of championship golf at the neigh-
boring country club.

Outrigger Keauhou Beach Resort
$$$
South Kona
This attractive and well-maintained hotel is a great choice for culture buffs,
active vacationers, or anybody in search of affordable oceanfront accom-
modations who doesn’t want to mortgage their children to do so. Situated
on a tranquil and lovely stretch of coast, the mid-rise structure boasts a
central location, lovely views, and a genuine Hawaiian ambience. The
island’s best snorkeling is right next door at Kahaluu Beach Park, and the
hotel’s own 10 acres of tropical grounds feature an oceanside pool, a fit-
ness center, and tennis courts lit for night play. The open-air lobby lets the
outside in. A grassy oceanfront area is dedicated to the easy life, with ham-
mocks strung between coconut palms, and the on-site Kalona Salon and
Spa specializes in first-rate skin-care treatments. Other pleasures include
a surprisingly good restaurant and an open-air lounge with live Hawaiian
music and glorious golden sunsets. The rooms themselves are less dis-
tinctive, but perfectly comfortable. Completely renovated in 2008, you can
expect them to be fresh, pretty, and comfortable, with good bedside read-
ing lights, generous counter space, and cushy towels in the bathrooms
(some of which have showers only), coffeemakers, free wireless Internet
access, and lanais — most with some kind of ocean view. Adjoining rooms
make this resort a good family choice, too. All in all, a very nice choice.

Outrigger Royal Sea Cliff Resort
$$
Kailua-Kona
Parents with kids in tow will love these apartments. They’re not fancy, but
they’re large, well outfitted, and older but well cared for and recently
upgraded by the reliable Outrigger hotel chain. The big five-story complex
steps down a terraced cliff to a black-sand beach. The water’s too rough
for swimming; but the views are spectacular, and the privacy is unsur-
passed. Gardens and hanging bougainvillea give the whole place a pleas-
ant, tropical ambience. The spacious, air-conditioned apartments carry
through on the vibe, with lots of rattan, sunny lanais (some with ocean
views), full kitchens with microwave, washer/dryer, TV with VCR in the
living rooms, and daily maid service, making for easy vacation living. Two
pools (one freshwater, one saltwater), a Jacuzzi, sauna, tennis, and bar-
becues are all on-site. There’s a decent beach about a mile away with excel-
lent snorkeling. The location is quiet but convenient to Kailua-Kona town.

ResortQuest Kona by the Sea
$$$
Kailua-Kona
The units and grounds at this deluxe oceanfront condo complex are a tad
more inviting than those at the nearby Outrigger Royal Sea Cliff (see
above), but not dramatically so. The bright, spacious, nicely decorated
apartments boast complete kitchens with microwave, washer/dryers,
daily maid service, and large lanais (most with ocean views). On-site you
find an oceanfront freshwater pool, a Jacuzzi, barbecues, and an activities
desk that can book your island fun. One of the pluses exclusive to this
property is the personal grocery-shopping service — just leave a shop-
ping list with the manager, and your staples are delivered right to your
door. The white-sand beach here is lovely but unswimmable, so plan on
heading 4 miles south to Kahaluu Beach for first-rate snorkeling or driv-
ing a half-hour north to the Kohala Coast for really spectacular sands.

ResortQuest at Waikoloa Colony Villas
$$$$
Kohala Coast
This peaceful luxury condo complex on the 15th fairway of the Waikoloa
Beach Course, in the pleasing Waikoloa resort, is a wonderful choice for
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
338

families or anybody who wants to enjoy the comforts of home when they
come to the islands — and then some. These attractive and well-furnished
two-story town home–style units are large and feature a fully equipped
kitchen with granite countertops and quality appliances; a big, comfort-
able, warmly decorated living room; firm, comfortable, well-dressed beds;
spacious, well-outfitted baths, with double sinks and separate shower and
tub in the master; in-suite washer and dryer; a large patio or lanai with teak
furnishings for outdoor dining; and good lighting and art that’s more attrac-
tive and individualized than you would expect it to be. Units are serviced
in basic fashion daily — towels are changed out and trash is picked up —
with full maid service every fourth day. The complex features two small
swimming pools, a spa, a tennis court, and a small fitness room. Thanks to
the creature comforts and room to spread out, this was one of my favorite
places to stay on my last trip to the islands. The only downside is that it’s
near the end of the road in Waikoloa, so it’s a short drive just to get out of
the resort. A great swim-and-snorkel beach, A-Bay, is a five-minute drive
away. Units are quite comparable with the Islands at Mauna Lani, and both
resorts make great places to stay; I recommend price comparing.

Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort & Spa
$$$$
South Kona
Set on a spectacular 22-acre oceanfront lava point on the sunny south
Kona Coast is this reliable hotel, reborn from the former Kona Surf in late
2004. Among the appeals are a spectacular open-air lobby, a kid-pleasing
pool complex featuring the island’s longest water slide, and 530 spacious
guest rooms. The hotel isn’t perfect — its architecture is still too reminis-
cent of the 1970s than I’d like it to be, and I wish they had eradicated the
popcorn ceilings in the makeover — but it’s a fine choice for those who
want the comforts and service of a brand-name, full-service resort with-
out the outrageous prices that predominate farther up the coast. Guest
rooms feature tropical-modern decor and cloudlike Sheraton Sweet
Sleeper beds; many boast spectacular ocean views, but even the moun-
tain views are stunners in this slice of Kona coffee country. The self-con-
tained resort also features an intimate full-service spa with top-notch
treatments, including open-air massage; and a Monday-night luau. Don’t
miss the Crystal Blue bar, where manta rays arrive almost nightly to bask
in the ocean spotlights. The location is one of my Big Island favorites,
thanks to the lush countryside and the out-of-the-fray convenience to
dining, shopping, and a wealth of ocean activities, including snorkel
cruises and kayak trips to Kealakekua Bay (one of Hawaii’s finest snorkel
and dolphin-watching spots). However, as is common on this lava-rock
coast, plan to drive to the beach.

Shipman House Bed & Breakfast Inn
$$
Hilo
Misty, flower-filled Hilo wows nostalgics with its Victorian homes and
charming downtown overlooking a romantic half-moon bay. One of those
century-old Victorians is this dreamy B&B. Impeccably renovated and on
the National Register of Historic Places, it’s right in step with Hilo’s old
Hawaii vibe. Barbara Ann and Gary Andersen have kept the inn true to its
original form, but they haven’t lost sight of its present-day purpose. It’s
full of modern conveniences, including full bathrooms, ceiling fans,
minifridges, and kimono robes (but no TVs) in each of the five spacious,
impeccably done rooms. Most romantic is Auntie Clara’s, a corner room
with windows on two walls overlooking a lush rain forest and bay, with a
claw-foot tub in the bathroom. (The bathroom for this room is private, but
is detached from the bedroom.) The delightful, locally infused breakfast
is served on the wide veranda. This B&B is perfect for romance-seeking
couples, history buffs, and national park–goers alike (but not a good
choice for those traveling with children). Gracious through and through.
Smoking and shoes are forbidden inside the house.

Volcano Village Lodge
$$$
Volcano
This divine oasis in the ferns is a dream come true for romance-seeking
couples, and one of my favorite places to stay in all of Hawaii. Innkeeper
Kay Lee has crafted an impeccable rain forest retreat that makes both an
excellent base for exploring the national park and a relaxing haven for kick-
ing back and enjoying your time together.
Pebbled paths wind their way to five cottages built of fragrant white cedar
tucked among the magical gardens. Each is oriented just so, making you
feel like you’re alone in a wild, misty world of overgrown orchids, bamboo,
and ohia. Each cottage features a luxuriously dressed bed, a gas fireplace,
a private bath, a dining area for two, a minifridge and microwave, a
flatscreen high-definition TV with a DVD player (there’s no TV reception in
this part of the forest), a CD player, and a private lanai (ours had rocking
chairs for contemplating the natural wonders while I sipped my morning
tea). Furnishings are hand-selected for both comfort and one-of-a-kind
style. Pricier units add more lounging area and a few extra luxuries to the
mix. Kay prepares gourmet breakfast treats (fruit plates, home-baked
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
340

quiches, and the like), stocks the fridge, and supplies Kona roast and a
selection of teas so you can enjoy an intimate breakfast at your leisure.
There’s a DVD and CD library for borrowing, and a Jacuzzi and a common
living room for sharing. Kay has seemingly thought of everything, includ-
ing flashlights with extra batteries for late-night lava hikes, and loves to
share her joy in the natural wonder in which she lives. A blissful escape —
I can’t wait to go back.

Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort & Spa
$$$$
Kohala Coast
This Marriott property has a primo location: It’s situated on palm-lined A-
Bay, one of the island’s prettiest white-sand beaches and best bays for
watersports. An excellent beach-activities desk provides easy access to
snorkeling, diving, kayaking, and windsurfing; championship golf and salon
and spa services are also on hand. The smallish rooms evoke a lovely
island vibe; nice features include Marriott’s genuinely comfortable
“Revive” bed, a private lanai, and in-room fridges, coffeemakers, and robes.
On-property perks include the full-service Mandara Spa for pampering
treatments and a good fitness center; two fantastic championship golf
courses are just a shuttle ride away. Considering the cost to stay in neigh-
boring hotels, the Marriott is the bargain of the Kohala Coast (although
it’s worth comparing prices against Hilton Waikoloa Village, reviewed ear-
lier in this chapter).

Waterfalls Inn
$$
Hilo
This stately historic home, located in Hilo’s most beautiful residential
neighborhood, makes a delightful place to stay. The four guest rooms are
generously sized and attractively furnished in an island-casual but vintage-
inspired style that suits the house perfectly. Each features an elegantly
dressed pillow-top bed (queen-size or king-size), comfortable attendant
furnishings that include a sitting area, and a beautifully appointed bath-
room with either a whirlpool or an antique soaking tub. One room 
can accommodate families or friends traveling together in a comfortable
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 341

anteroom. Well-polished wood floors grace the home, which also features
a pleasing breakfast room and lush grounds sonorous with bird song, the
high-pitched croaks of tree frogs, and the rushing waters of the Wailuku
River, which runs behind the house. Innkeepers (and Chicago transplants)
George and Barbara Leonard are friendly but not intrusive, and they pre-
pare a pleasing expanded continental breakfast that includes fresh island
fruit smoothies. All in all, an excellent choice.
The Leonards also own a very pleasing oceanfront condo, Hale Kona 
Kai ($$; www.halekonakai.com), in the heart of Kailua-Kona town. The one-
bedroom unit, which can sleep up to four, has been freshly renovated with
extras such as mahogany floors, granite countertops, and a flatscreen TV
with DVD in the bedroom, and attractive, good-quality patio furniture. The
restaurants, shopping, and bustle of Kona town are an easy walk away —
and, at $150 to $160 a night, it’s hard to do better for on-the-water accom-
modations. (Plan on an $85 cleaning fee and a three-day minimum stay.)
Look for them to add a Pahoa vacation rental to their repertoire in 2009.

Home, sweet vacation home
Local real-estate agencies offer a wealth of additional condo choices in
and around Kailua-Kona and South Kona. One of the more trusted names
is Knutson & Associates (% 800-800-6202 or 808-329-6311; www.kona
hawaiirentals.com), a vacation-rental broker representing everything
from affordable condos to multibedroom oceanfront houses.
Hawaii Resort Management (% 800-244-4752 or 808-329-3333; www.
konahawaii.com) represents a dozen or more condo properties in the
Kailua-Kona area (including the Kona Billfisher, listed earlier in this
chapter) and is a good source for budget-watching travelers who prize
value over perfection — especially if you’re looking for oceanfront
options at a bargain rate.
If you prefer a luxury rental on the sunny, golf course–riddled Kohala
Coast, reach out to South Kohala Management (% 800-822-4252 or
808-883-8500; www.southkohala.com), which offers first-rate condos
and town houses plus a handful of upscale oceanfront homes.
You can cut out the middle man and rent directly from the owner at a
number of quality condo resorts on the Big Island, including Kanaloa at
Kona and the terrific Keauhou Kona Surf and Racquet Club, by visiting
Aloha Condos Hawaii (www.alohacondos.com), a cooperative of
owner-managed units; links on the site will connect you directly to the
owner.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
342

Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts (% 800-262-9912 or 808-263-3100;
www.bestbnb.com) also represents some excellent vacation homes on
the Big Island, as well as delightful B&Bs. The staff can book a room for
you in a cozy cottage or a larger home that they have personally
inspected and approved, and service is always friendly.
The Web site of Hawaii Island B&B Association (www.stayhawaii.com)
offers one-stop shopping for charming, affordable island accommoda-
tions with no additional charges — and you can book right online.
Each of the properties has been inspected and approved by associa-
tion representatives.
Dining Out
The Big Island is home to some wonderful restaurants, including a hand-
ful of special-occasion oceanfront spots that are just right for romance.
But you don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well; in fact, the Big Island
is home to some of my favorite affordable restaurants in the state.
On the downside, things are a little spread out on this oversize rural
island, so choose your dining spots carefully; you don’t want to make a
reservation for dinner only to realize that the restaurant is an hour’s drive
from where you’re staying. I’ve worked to include the best restaurants in
and around all the major resort and visitor areas in which you may be
staying. Still, you may find that your choices are limited; the area around
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, for example, has only a small handful of
restaurants, period. If you want additional choices, your concierge, front-
desk staff, or innkeeper is usually happy to make recommendations.
At the Kohala Coast resorts, you’ll find that the resort restaurants are
almost universally overpriced. I’ve included a few worthy local favorites
near the hotels, for those of you who’d rather not pay a minimum of 30
bucks for an entree or $16 for a room-service burger that little Johnny
isn’t going to finish anyway.
In the restaurant listings in this chapter, each review is followed by a
number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar
signs are meant to give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one
person — including appetizer, main course, dessert, one drink, tax, and
tip — is likely to set you back. The price categories go like this:
$
Cheap eats — less than $20 per person
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$35
$$$
Moderate — $35–$50
$$$$
Pricey — $50–$75
$$$$$
Ultraexpensive — more than $75 per person

Of course, it all depends on how you order, so stay away from the surf and
turf or the north end of the wine list if you’re watching your budget. To
give you a further idea of how much you can expect to spend, I also
include the price range of main courses in the listings. (Keep in mind that
prices can change at the whim of the management, but restaurants usually
don’t raise their prices by more than a dollar or two at any given time.)
The state adds roughly 4 percent in taxes to every restaurant bill. The
percentage may vary slightly depending on the county you’re in, and
may be embedded in the total purchase price or shown as an independ-
ent line item on your bill. A 15 to 20 percent tip is standard in Hawaii,
just as in the rest of the States.

This wonderful restaurant provides the perfect excuse to venture up to pas-
toral North Kohala. Housed in a delightful plantation-era building and done
up in well-worn rattan and retro-tropical prints, Bamboo bubbles over with
old Hawaii appeal — like Trader Vic’s without the kitsch. The pleasing menu
features delicious island cuisine that, refreshingly, doesn’t bother with
“gourmet” or “culinary” pretensions. This is real food, well prepared with
local pride. Almost everything is fresh-caught or locally grown by Kohala
fishermen and farmers, and the owners grow their own herbs and flowers.
The quality is excellent, portions are generous, and Pacific and Thai influ-
ences add zip. Chicken satay potstickers are hand-wrapped and pan-fried
in chili oil for a spicy signature treat. Island fish is prepared four winning
ways, and a moist and tender 5-ounce filet is flame-broiled and paired with
black tiger shrimp and green papaya salad. The lunch menu is simpler but
equally satisfying, with offerings like a Hawaiian barbecued pork sandwich.
Eggs Bamboo (eggs Benedict with kalua pork and lilikoi [passion fruit] hol-
landaise) is a winner at Sunday brunch. Passion-fruit margaritas and live
slack-key guitar music round out the island appeal. Plan on an early dinner
so that you can enjoy the scenic drive in the daylight.

Big Island Grill
$
Kailua-Kona
American/Local
This local favorite offers huge portions of home-style cooking at retro
prices, making it one of the island’s most beloved restaurants. And the love
shows: The grill is always hopping, from the first cup of coffee at break-
fast to the last bite of dessert after dark. Expect American favorites with a
local spin, including excellent fresh fish and generous salads and sand-
wiches; don’t miss out on a side of the fabulous mashed potatoes. It’s an
excellent choice for families. In a hurry? No worries: Head to the drive-up

Brown’s Beach House
$$$$$
Kohala Coast
Hawaii Regional
On-the-beach dining experiences don’t come finer than Brown’s, an excel-
lent alfresco restaurant that consistently shines. The innovative island-
inspired cuisine uses the freshest local seafood and produce (you can
watch the staff in action in the exhibition kitchen). You might start with
ahi poke tossed tableside, or a salad of heirloom tomatoes grown on the
nearby slopes, accompanied by passion fruit and a goat cheese panna
cotta. Follow with a grilled, spice-rubbed New York strip steak grilled over
kiawe (mesquite) and served with Molokai sweet potatoes; or locally
farmed sweet lobster and scallops. The food at Hualalai and Pahu i’a (see
listings later in this chapter) is better, but the one-of-a-kind ambience here,
with nightly entertainment under the stars, is pure magic. What’s more,
presentation and service are both faultless. Reserve a table close to the
spot-lit surf for the ultimate in romance (and bring a light jacket or wrap
to ward off the ocean breeze, which can be nippy after dark).

Cafe Pesto
$$
Hilo/Kohala Coast
Pizza/Italian/Island
These casual island favorites are a long-standing hit with locals and visi-
tors alike. The well-prepared pastas and Pacific Regional specialties are
pleasing, but the pizza is the real star — and the real value — of the menu.
Both branches serve top-flight gourmet brick-oven-baked pies featuring
fresh organic herbs, island-grown produce, and a thick, slightly sweet
golden crust. My favorite is the pizza luau, with kalua-style pork, sweet
onions, and fresh pineapple, but you can choose from a full slate of cre-
ative combinations or build your own from a list of more than two dozen
toppings. I find the food to be consistently better at the original Hilo
branch (which also boasts a more appealing and attractive high-ceilinged
setting), but the branch at the northernmost end of the Kohala Coast pro-
vides a great escape for families tired of feeding on overpriced resort food.

South Kona
American
This bare-bones roadside charmer prepares some of South Kona’s best
eats. Take a seat on the pleasant terrace (which boasts ocean views
beyond the banana trees) for table service or pony up to the friendly
counter to order takeout. You can start the day with first-class eggs
Benedict or thick French toast accompanied by a cup of world-class
Arabica joe that was grown right on the mountainside below. Come by at
lunch for the best sandwiches on the coast. Top-notch fillings range from
smoked Alaskan salmon to fresh local veggies to warmed corned beef and
Black Forest ham, and you can have them applied to any one of six kinds
of fresh-baked bread. The thick-crusted, generously topped pizzas are even
better than Cafe Pesto’s (see the preceding listing), and when it’s time for
dessert, lots of homemade pies and baked goods tempt you. The service
can be slow, but what’s your hurry? You’re on vacation. Sit back, take it in
stride, and consider it a blessing that you have more time to take in the
million-dollar view.

Daniel Thiebaut
$$$$–$$$$$
Waimea
French Asian
Although the food here can be just wonderful, my favorite thing about
Daniel Thiebaut is its delightful setting: It’s housed in the former Chock In
Store, which kept Waimea in staples for nearly all of the 20th century. The
wonderful warren of high-ceilinged rooms has been beautifully preserved,
and memorabilia from the olden days line the walls and curio cabinets.
The food blends island freshness with Thiebaut’s own European-style
sauces and reductions to pleasing effect. The menu is laden with choices
that range from a delectable lobster bisque and a fresh-catch fish in
macadamia-nut sauce to lilikoi-glazed barbecue short ribs and a Hunan-
style rack of lamb. Word is that the kitchen can be iffy when Chef Daniel
isn’t in the house, but I’ve had very good dining experiences here. Sunday
brunch is a bounteous treat. Not cheap, but a fairly priced alternative to
the Kohala Coast resorts a half-hour down the hill.

Donatoni’s
$$$$–$$$$$
Kohala Coast
Northern Italian
This wildly romantic restaurant replicates the feel of an Italian villa, with
tables overlooking a tranquil lagoon and boasting unforgettable sunset
views. Make sure to book a table on the twinkle-lit, European-elegant patio.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
348

Excellent choices include a delectable, fall-off-the-bone osso buco alla
Milanese; delicate and delicious veal scaloppine with sautéed mushrooms
in a light asparagus cream sauce; pan-seared Hawaiian snapper with put-
tanesca sauce; and any of the house-made pastas. But if something else
entices you, go for it; I dined with a large party on my last visit, and every
dish at the table was a star. Desserts are equally impressive. For some-
thing really special, opt for the Venetian Carnival Mask, made of white
chocolate and resting atop a lightly bittersweet chocolate marquis with
Franjelico sauce. The restaurant offers an excellent (though quite pricey)
wine list too — it has garnered multiple Wine Spectator Awards of
Excellence. Come for sunset because the view is everything it should be.
Be sure to arrive at the Hilton Waikoloa a full 15 to 20 minutes before your
reservation time; it will take you that long to walk (or take one of the
resort’s silly shuttles) to the restaurant because the Hilton sprawls over a
massive 62 acres.

Don the Beachcomber
$$$
Kailua-Kona
Island Steak and Seafood
I’m thrilled with the arrival of Don the Beachcomber to the Kailua-Kona
dining scene, which has long been in need of supplement to its few good-
quality options. The legendary Donn Beach was the inventor of the mai
tai, and one of the originators of the classic Tiki lifestyle; this new restau-
rant hits all of the right vintage notes, but doesn’t sacrifice quality for style.
The island-style steak-and-seafood menu is prepared with fresh, top-qual-
ity ingredients and an inventive spirit that’s creative yet delightfully
unfussy. Highlights include a slow-roasted Hawaiian salt-and-pepper-
crusted prime rib; the “Sword Fight,” a fresh-caught billfish and lobster tail
combo; macadamia nut–crusted mahimahi with fresh papaya-mango-lime
salsa; and Don’s Drunken Chicken, a breast pan-seared in truffle oil and
dressed in dark rum and a wild mushroom Marsala sauce. A variety of
entree-size salads are on the menu for diners with lighter appetites.
The decor is Tiki perfect, complete with grass-skirted tables in the open-
air, oceanfront dining room. The colonnaded bar overlooking the surf is
the height of Tiki chic, and the mai tai is everything it should be. Daytime
diners can enjoy a generous breakfast buffet or lunch and island-style
pupus (coconut prawns, ahi sashimi, honey-mango-glazed baby back ribs)
served in the bar throughout the day. Just as Kona should be, and satis-
fying through and through. Note: Bring your parking ticket in for free-park-
ing validation.

Fujimamas
$$$
Kailua-Kona
Asian-Inspired/Sushi
Chef Mark Vann has taken the spirit of the original Fujimamas in Tokyo and
transported it to a tucked-away corner in Kona town that sizzles with hip,
creative energy. The indoor-outdoor restaurant features sexy Southeast
Asian details and furnishings, while the rustic outdoor patio twinkles. The
food is good, if not consistently great; I really enjoyed the zestily inventive
Thai Caesar salad with crispy calamari “croutons” and the mushroom-
stuffed pork tonkatsu with spicy apple sauce, but found the corn griddle
cake under the seared salmon to be a little colder than I would have liked.
Most dishes are served family style so everyone can share. The sushi is
mostly local caught and creatively prepared, and probably the highlight
of the menu; consider the Pink Panther roll (tempura shrimp, shiso, avo-
cado, and cucumber wrapped in pink soy paper and accompanied by a
spicy aioli) for a fun and flavorful sushi experience. An inspired drinks
menu that includes creative cocktails, sake flights, and Asian beers adds
to the flair. All in all, a less-than-perfect but fun choice.

Hilo Bay Cafe

Hilo
Contemporary
One of Hilo’s top fine-dining spots is tucked away in a nondescript strip
mall a ten-minute drive from downtown, but it’s well worth seeking out for
its good food at reasonable prices. The contemporary-styled room is
simple, with colorful accents to energize the style. Local and organic ingre-
dients drive a modern menu blending dashes of island and Italian inspira-
tion. Winning dishes include macadamia-praline crusted scallops, served
on angel hair pasta with smoked bacon, and a nicely grilled local rib-eye
with gold mashed potatoes, tomato confit, and smoked green beans. Dishes
are generally well prepared and pleasing, and I like how they recommend
wine pairings with every main. Service is attentive (if not always as atten-
tive as it should be), and the wine list is affordable. The lunch menu is sim-
pler but no less satisfying. All in all, a nice choice in a dining-basic town.

The Hualalai Grille by Alan Wong
$$$$$
Kohala Coast
Hawaii Regional
My favorite restaurant in all of Hawaii is Alan Wong’s in Honolulu — until
I dined here, that is. The Hualalai Grille strikes all of the same inspiring
notes that the original does, but adds the appeal of a gorgeous, casually
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
350

sophisticated resort setting. The restaurant is housed in the golf course
clubhouse at the ultraluxe Four Seasons resort; the floor-to-ceiling win-
dows sweep aside to reveal stunning 18th hole views in one direction,
resort and ocean views in the other. The high-ceilinged, haute plantation-
style room is outfitted in warm woods and comfortable furnishings, and
boasts a stylish but unfussy vibe; the tables are well spaced to allow for
plenty of elbow room and private conversation.
If there is one master of Hawaii Regional Cuisine, it is Wong — and his cui-
sine is exquisite. The island-modern menu maintains the spirit of the origi-
nal while having a flair all its own. It even wears the glow of the Big Island
in such dishes as grilled Kukaiau Ranch beef tenderloin with a warm
Hamakua-grown mushroom and Cipollini onion salad, topped with a béar-
naise sauce that seems lighter than it must be. The soy-braised short ribs,
Wong’s own version of Korean kalbi, accompanied by ginger-crusted
grilled shrimp and lotus root, was a culinary dream come true for me, but
you can’t go wrong with any creation on this ethereal menu. I like its joyful
spirit, showcased in the “soup and sandwich” appetizer, a grilled cheese,
kalua pig, and foie gras sandwich served with a martini glass of chilled
tomato soup; I reveled in feeling like the most sophisticated little kid in the
room. Service is thoughtful, attentive, and unpretentious, and the cocktails
and desserts are everything they should be. The tasting menu is a relative
bargain, considering the don’t-have-to-choose experience it offers. A
world-class wow from start to finish. Book well ahead.

Huggo’s
$$$$
Kailua-Kona
Seafood
Happy, hopping Huggo’s serves fine seafood to a jovial crowd drawn in by
the festive vibe and remarkable Kailua Bay views. Fresh fish — grilled,
blackened, sautéed, or steamed — is the specialty, as it should be. The
dining room is so close to the surf that the kitchen staff could practically
cast a line over the side of the deck; it’s virtually impossible to find a more
fabulous on-the-water setting, even at twice the price. Some of the prepa-
rations can be a bit heavy-handed, smothering the top-quality local
catches, so I recommend opting for simpler preparations that let the fresh-
ness and flavor shine through. The service is welcoming, friendly, and
knowledgeable, and the wine list features a number of good bargains.
Ginger orange chicken, New York steak, and wild mushroom pasta are on
hand for the fish-o-phobic, and there’s macadamia nut pie à la mode to cap
things off. All in all, a terrific choice — certainly among the best of Kailua-
Kona town’s string of waterfront restaurants (although Don the
Beachcomber’s is giving Huggo’s a run for its money).
Next door at the lively, thatch-roofed Huggo’s on the Rocks, you’ll find
casual all-day dining and live music nightly. Huggo’s also prepares an

able menu of burgers, sandwiches, and pupus is served late into the
evening. Come extra-early for your sunset perch because the secret’s out.

Here’s a refreshing change of pace; a chance to escape the high-priced
resorts and the constant bustle of Kailua-Kona’s main drag to rub elbows
with the locals. Cheery, colorful, and relaxed, Jackie Rey’s is a real neigh-
borhood find with a surprisingly sophisticated menu, warm service, and an
impressively talented kitchen staff. Drop in at lunch for beer-battered fish
and chips, a kalua turkey wrap with avocado and melted Swiss cheese, or
a half-pound cheddar burger with a side of curly fries. Weekday happy
hours bring half-price pupus, like the Korean-style short ribs or spicy
hoisin chicken wings (not to mention tropical drinks and a nice selection
of local microbrews). For dinner, Angie’s salad is a lavish composition fea-
turing fresh spinach greens, blue cheese, candied walnuts, papaya, and
onions in a raspberry balsamic vinaigrette. The seared ahi with crispy noo-
dles and Asian vegetables is always in demand, as are the sweetly zesty
Korean-style beef short ribs, which may be ordered as either an appetizer
or an entree. The nightly specials include several fresh catches done with
tempting preparations. The desserts are top-notch and a keiki (children’s)
menu makes things easy for Mom and Dad. The wine list is thoughtfully
chosen and extremely well-priced. A definite winner — and an excellent
value to boot, all things considered. Enjoy an eclectic mix of live music
and dancing on weekend nights.

while still maintaining the casual, approachable style that an authentic,

walls, white tablecloths, and colorful, well-chosen art. There’s live acoustic
music most nights. The menu blends straightforward steaks, chops, and
burgers with island favorites prepared in creative ways that are the most
satisfying options on the menu. I recommend starting with the classic ahi
poke, Hawaii’s version of ceviche well seasoned with Kukui nut and onions,
garnished with fresh-sliced avocado, and served with a dash of élan in a
martini glass. Fresh island fish from the deep Big Island waters is pre-
sented five ways; I delighted in my pan-fried, coconut-crusted ono dressed
in sweet-spicy lilikoi (passion fruit) sauce. Plates are beautifully presented,
the full bar mixes a great martini, and service is attentive.

Keei Cafe
$$–$$$
South Kona
Island/Eclectic
Keei (kay-ee) Cafe prepares some of the Big Island’s finest food in a casual,
low-key environment. A few years back, Keei moved from its previous
locale in a former fish market to its present digs, a bit farther north and
somewhat more upscale. The ambience remains as comfortable as ever,
the service is friendly, and the island-style meals are excellent. Expect
hearty Mediterranean- and Asian-slanted dishes in pleasantly light sauces
accompanied by fresh, crisp vegetables, such as half-roasted chicken in
red Thai curry, or marvelous fresh Kona catches in a puckery piccata
sauce. Every dish is made from scratch, and virtually all ingredients are
caught, grown, or harvested on the island. Keei Cafe offers one of the best
dining values in the state; it’s easy to pay a lot more for a lot less elsewhere
in Hawaii. Save room for dessert, because both the bread pudding, made
with bananas and pineapple, and the coconut flan with lilikoi sauce (secret
recipe of the owner’s Portuguese mother-in-law) are home-style tropical
delights. Complaints about service nearly sunk Keei Cafe after the big

Kenichi Pacific

South Kona/Kohala Coast
Pacific Rim Fusion/Sushi
Master sushi chef Kenichi Kamada, who has already made a splash in
Austin and Aspen with his very pleasing Pacific Rim fusion cuisine, has
thankfully blessed the Big Island with his hip signature style, his famous
sushi bar, and a welcome blast of cool. The setting is Zen-modern, the serv-
ice is efficient, and the food is usually terrific, making Kenichi Pacific a
winner on all fronts. You can enjoy some excellent sushi and sashimi, opt
for more traditional appetizer/main-course ordering, or mix it up family-
style, if you prefer. If you’re a sushi novice or unfamiliar with any of the
ingredients or preparations, your server is happy to walk you through the
menu. Dishes that make grazing a pleasure include ginger-marinated squid,
Saikyo black cod — cured for 48 hours in miso blend and then broiled with
a teriyaki glaze until it’s melt-in-your-mouth perfection — and Dungeness
crab cakes, fresh crab encased in crispy phyllo and dressed in a sambal-
pickled ginger sauce. Kenichi’s special roast duck with orange hoisin
sauce, wrapped moo shu–style and served with tempura asparagus, is a
delight. A new Mauna Lani location has both added to the Kenichi empire
and happily expanded the Kohala Coast’s dining choices — but word on
the street is that the quality is now variable in both locations, depending
on where you find Kenichi in the kitchen.

The classic coffee shop goes Hawaiian at Ken’s, the only round-the-clock
joint on the Big Island. This cheery local favorite is an all-American diner,
where the comfort food is pleasingly prepared and the old-fashioned serv-
ice comes with a genuine dash of island-style aloha. Ken’s is a three-meals-
a-day-plus kind of place with a monster menu that boasts something for
everyone. Start your day bright and early with French toast or a
macadamia-nut waffle (topped with passion-fruit or coconut syrup, if you
want); Ken’s has been voted “Best Big Island” breakfast for nine years (and
counting), so you won’t be disappointed. Come back at noon for a garden-
fresh salad or a flame-broiled burger. Later in the day, stop in for a roast
turkey, teriyaki chicken, or kalbi rib dinner, or drop by for a late-night piece

of pie and a cup of Kona joe. Ken’s is also my favorite place on the island
for saimin, the ramenlike noodle soup that’s an island staple; in Ken’s ver-
sion, the noodles are handmade, as are the yummy chicken won tons. I
just love Ken’s — it’s a great place to experience real local cuisine and
aloha spirit.

Kiawe Kitchen
$$–$$$
Volcano Village
Contemporary Italian
I really like this fairly recent addition to the Volcano dining scene (com-
prising precisely three recommendable restaurants). The simple room
with a few cute touches isn’t much to look at; in fact, based on what I’d
heard about the place, I was surprised to be greeted by some rather dour-
looking carpet. Still, I got over any reservations quickly, thanks to very well
prepared food, with classier details than I expect in Volcano, and friendly
(if a bit too casual) service. The menu isn’t strictly Italian, but it wears a
distinct Italian flair. It includes good wood-fired pizzas, sandwiches, and
elegant salads at lunch, plus fire-roasted fish and meat main courses at
dinner. I really enjoyed Kiawe’s creative lunchtime Caesar (although I must
note that traditionalists may not), made with whole ladle-shaped organic
baby romaine leaves, fresh island tomatoes, and a perfectly creamy-tart
dressing, accompanied by an exceptionally good French-style baguette
(the bread is brought in from Hilo’s legendary Suisan market).
Preparations across the board are simple but stylish, and feature crisp
island-grown vegetables. Not as consistent or broadly appealing as the ter-
rific Kilauea Lodge (see review below), but a bit more spirited.

Kilauea Lodge & Restaurant
$$$$
Volcano
Continental
My favorite Volcano restaurant is dressed like a cozy old-world hunting
lodge and is tucked away in the rain forest just outside the national park.
The large, high-ceilinged room is appealingly attractive, with country-style
furniture polished to a high sheen and a roaring stone fireplace. The knowl-
edgeable and warmly welcoming servers are dressed in beautiful island
prints by renowned Big Island designer Sig Zane (see Chapter 15 for info
on where to get your own Sig Zane aloha wear). A skilled bartender mixing
up perfect martinis rounds out the picture. Chef-owner Albert Jeyte spe-
cializes in hearty old-world cuisine. A well-prepared fresh catch is always
on offer (broiled and topped with mango chutney glaze and crushed mac
nuts is my favorite of the preparation choices), but Jeyte’s heart lies with
such richly flavored dishes as duck l’orange, roasted with oranges, pepper,
Chapter 14: Settling into the Big Island 355

and garlic and coated in a yummy apricot mustard glaze. The leg of ante-
lope is sautéed, flamed over an open fire, and dressed in a red wine shal-
lot sauce. Dinners come with house-made soup or locally grown salad and
fresh-baked bread, which makes the excellent fare an excellent value too.

Kailua-Kona
Island/Pizza
Kona Brewing Co. is Hawaii’s finest microbrewery, specializing in flavorful
handcrafted brews with island-rooted names like Longboard Lager, Fire
Rock Pale Ale, and Hula Hefewiezen. You can enjoy them fresh from the
tap at this pleasingly casual pub, along with equally well-prepared island-
style pub grub. The hand-tossed pizza crusts are topped with top-quality
Parmesan and mozzarella, locally grown herbs, and a range of creative
ingredients, from traditional pepperoni to lilikoi barbecue chicken. Or you
can opt for hearty salads with crisp island-grown veggies, and generously
stuffed sandwiches on the brewery’s own focaccia. A nice selection of
pupus (appetizers) is on hand for those who merely want to pull up to the
blond-wood bar for some munchies and a beer. Inside service is available,
but snare a table on the pretty tropical patio if you can. Friendly service
rounds out the affordable, easygoing appeal.

If you’d like to try Peter Merriman’s winning fare but don’t feel like driving
all the way to Waimea — or if you’re simply in the mood for something
more casual (or more affordable) — visit this pleasing outpost in the
Waikoloa Kings’ Shops. This casually sophisticated market cafe features
Italian- and Mediterranean-style fare simply prepared with fresh local pro-
duce, meats, and day-caught local fish that give every dish crisp freshness
and a delightful local flair. Highlights include rosemary roasted rack of
lamb, served with garbanzo salad and island-grown greens; Portuguese
cataplana, a delightfully zesty dish of pan-roasted clams with locally made
chorizo sausage, garlic, and tomatoes; char-grilled shrimp kebabs; and a
hearty homemade meatball sandwich on a house-made hoagie roll at
lunch. A bountiful appetizer menu that includes yummy hummus, mini-
pizzas, a crisp and flavorful Greek salad, and other Mediterranean treats
allows for family-style sharing. The cafe also boasts a good selection of
affordable Mediterranean-style wines, including crisp, refreshing whites
and light, flavorful reds that pair with their dishes beautifully. A takeout

Merriman’s Restaurant
$$$$
Waimea
Hawaii Regional
One of the original purveyors of Hawaii Regional Cuisine, James
Beard–nominated chef Peter Merriman reigns over this cozy and com-
fortable cowboy-country enclave. Over the years, it has matured into a
still-pleasing — and still hugely popular — culinary institution. Residents
and visitors alike happily make the long drive Upcountry (20 minutes from
the Kohala Coast, about an hour from Kona or Hilo) to feast on Merriman’s
winning cuisine. Simplicity is the secret to his long-lasting success.
Waimea-raised beef and lamb, fish caught daily in Kona waters, and organ-
ically grown veggies from nearby family farms are used in uncomplicated
yet innovative preparations; the fresh natural flavors of the top-quality
ingredients shine through. Wok-charred ahi, Pahoa corn-and-shrimp frit-
ters, and slow-roasted chicken are among the many standouts on the per-
petually pleasing menu. Lunch is an especially good bargain.

and flown in fresh from Japan. The fish is skillfully prepared and served
with aloha by a young, friendly, and attentive waitstaff. Creative rolls are
a forte, and combination plates are a bargain. The restaurant is very popu-

This popular restaurant is the domain of top Hawaii Regional chef Amy

upscale-casual, with a full list of international beers and fine wines. Creative
noodle dishes are the stars of the menu, winning loyalty from locals and
visitors alike. The menu runs the gamut from Vietnamese pho (beef noodle
soup) to pasta primavera with grilled vegetables to wok-seared ahi noodle
casserole. The noodle dishes are significantly cheaper than the full-fledged
entrees, which include a well-prepared crispy Peking duck with fresh plum
sauce and local-style fish steamed in shiitake, scallion, and sesame shoyu
(soy sauce). Save room for the scrumptious desserts.

Kohala Coast
Euro-Pacific Fusion
Done in an elegant haute-plantation style and open to the trade winds and
ocean views, this ultraromantic candlelit dining room (with a brilliant
aquarium as its centerpiece) is the Big Island’s most beautiful restaurant.
The sublime food and faultless service live up to the setting in every
respect. The regularly changing menu features only the finest regional
ingredients, and both Pacific-born and Continental preparations take
inspired turns in the capable kitchen. A thick-cut ahi steak wears a red-wine
lobster sauce, and is accompanied by a wonderful Molokai sweet-potato
purée. A delicate guava glaze adorns pan-seared scallops, and heartier
appetites might opt for prime dry-aged peppercorn steak or a tender
roasted rack of lamb. The depth and richness of the truffle and butternut
squash risotto is enhanced by wild mushrooms and shaved Parmesan. The
dessert menu is a showstopper, with creations such as a ginger–macadamia
nut praline mousse served with Kona coffee ice cream. I’m clearly not alone

Pescatore Italian Restaurant
$$–$$$
Hilo
Southern Italian
This old-world restaurant is a consistent performer in old Hilo town, which
isn’t exactly known for its fine-dining scene. The traditional southern
Italian, seafood-heavy menu stars good-quality scaloppines, primaveras,
and puttanescas. Dishes are generally well prepared and pleasing: Ahi
carpaccio is sliced paper-thin and dressed in extra-virgin olive oil to
heighten the fresh flavor, the seafood Fra Diavolo is a spicy bounty of fresh
seafood in zesty marinara, and the chicken parmigiana is tender and fla-
vorful. Service is attentive with a dash of personality, and the wine list is
affordable. The lunch menu is simpler but still satisfying. A pleasant
choice, if not spectacular.

Roy’s Waikoloa Bar & Grill
$$$–$$$$
Kohala Coast
Hawaii Regional
The Waikoloa branch of Roy Yamaguchi’s high-profile, high-end restaurant
chain is not quite as winningly casual as the other Roy’s establishments
throughout Hawaii (particularly my favorite, Roy’s Poipu Grill on Kauai),
but this brightly lit, bustling restaurant is still a wonderful place to sample
the original Hawaii Regional Cuisine nonetheless. Roy’s food is more
overtly Asian than what you’ll find in many other Hawaii Regional restau-
rants (like Merriman’s; see listing earlier in this chapter). The menu
changes daily, but usually includes standards such as sublime slow-
braised and charbroiled short ribs, blackened ahi with a delectable soy
mustard butter, or roasted macadamia-nut mahimahi in lobster cognac
butter sauce. You can easily eat affordably here thanks to an oversize
menu of dim sum and appetizers; you can never go wrong with Roy’s
wood-grilled, Szechuan-style baby back ribs. The wines and sakes bottled
under Roy’s own label are affordable and surprisingly good. The noise level
can be high and service is almost a little too attentive; but these are minor
quibbles — like complaining that the Moët’s too cold, if you know what I
mean.

Sansei Restaurant & Sushi Bar
$$$
Kohala Coast
Japanese/Pacific Rim Seafood
Chef D.K. Kodama has wowed the Big Island with this fresh outpost of his
Maui sushi palaces. Sansei offers some of the best (and best-value) dining
on the island. Composed primarily of Pan-Asian seafood dishes with mul-
ticultural touches, Sansei’s winningly innovative menu has won raves from
fans around the globe. Traditional-style main courses are available, but I
recommend assembling a family-style meal from the adventurous sushi
rolls and small plates. Can’t-go-wrong menu highlights include the shrimp
Dynamite, crispy tempura shrimp tossed in a creamy-zesty garlic masago
aioli; the mango crab salad roll in sweet Thai chili vinaigrette; and the cala-
mari salad of local greens tossed in Korean-inspired kojuchang vinaigrette,
presented in a pleasing wonton basket. But, frankly, it’s hard to go wrong
with anything here. I love the beautifully presented flower sushi. This easy-
going, Japanese-style place is palatable even for more tentative sushi
eaters thanks to satisfying, Asian-inspired steak and poultry entrees as
well. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. A real winner, and my choice
over nearby Kenichi. My only complaint with this cavernous new space is
that it’s too brightly lit and lacks the intimacy of the Maui and Oahu out-
posts — but for food this good, I’ll live.

Thai Thai Restaurant
$$
Volcano
Thai
I am thrilled that this wonderful Thai restaurant remains a consistent
winner in Volcano Village, which doesn’t exactly brim with quality dining
spots. An attractive high-ceilinged room with Thai decorative touches,
pretty table linens, and Thai pop music on the sound system sets the stage
for simple, freshly prepared dishes. The menu is on the smallish side, but
every dish I tasted was a winner. The tom yum soup was clear and well-
spiced with lemon grass and kaffir lime leaves; the masaman curry was
rich with coconut milk and potatoes; and a stir-fry starred crisp Asian veg-
gies and jumbo shrimp. The green papaya salad makes an excellent way to
start a wholly satisfying meal. Note: The owners close down once a year
for about a month to visit the homeland and bring back cooking spices, so
call ahead or check with your innkeeper to avoid disappointment.

Tommy Bahama’s Tropical Cafe
$$$$
Kohala Coast
Caribbean
Housed in the Tommy Bahama’s fashion emporium at the Shops at Mauna
Lani, this delightful restaurant perfectly embodies the tropical haber-
dasher’s breezily sophisticated style. The open-air room is a mélange of
bamboo, rattan, and tropical prints that come together in a postmodern
plantation style. While the food is very well prepared, it’s too expensive —
but that’s the story of this pricey resort coast. I love Tommy Bahama’s
best for cocktails, which are some of the island’s most creative and satis-
fying, or a relaxed lunch, when the menu focuses on Caribbean-inspired
sandwiches and bounteous entree-size salads. Pleasing choices include
the Habana Cabana pulled-pork sandwich, finished with the restaurant’s
own blackberry brandy barbecue sauce; and the Aruba Arugula salad,
tossed in a tamarind vinaigrette and garnished with Caribbean-zested
shrimp and scallops. Dinner brings more substantial fare, like maple-
brined and chargrilled pork tenderloin topped with a dried berry merlot
chutney, and pan-seared sashimi-grade ahi dressed in sweet chili oil,
cilantro, and lemon grass. All in all, a really satisfying dining choice, if you
can overlook the tab.

with high-quality ingredients. Fresh-caught local fish dresses the fish tacos;
you can also opt for your choice of spicy ground beef, grilled marinated
chicken, grilled steak, chile verde pork, and roasted pork carnitas in most
dishes. Choose your meal from the chalkboard, order at the counter, and
then take a seat at one of the tables in the bright, pretty, high-ceilinged dining
room, where orange plastic chairs add a dash of contemporary pizzazz. After
a short wait (everything is prepared fresh) your food will be served up casual
style, in baskets. All of the dishes are served pretty mild — even salsas are
not particularly fiery — but you can ask for habanero sauce at the counter.
Kona beer is on tap and margaritas are available to accompany your meal,
but you may just want to opt for the not-too-sweet, hand-squeezed limeade,
which offers refreshing accompaniment.

Village Luau (see later in this chapter) You should make your reserva-
tions as far ahead of time as possible (before you leave home) because it
can sell out weeks in advance.
Gathering of the Kings
This progressive Polynesian feast under the stars forsakes some of the tra-
ditional luau touches (such as the traditional pig roasting) in favor of a
more artful, creative approach. The focus is in two places: the stage show
and the food. The stage show blends modern choreography and contem-
porary island-style music to tell the story of the Polynesian people as they
journeyed across the great Pacific to Hawaii, with stops in Samoa, Tahiti,
and New Zealand along the way. It’s a very well done show with a dash of
Broadway flair. Some folks love its adventuresome nature, but if you’re
looking for a more traditional depiction of the culture, look elsewhere. The
elegant buffet is arranged in “destination” stations as well (Samoa, Tahiti,
Hawaii, New Zealand). This is the closest that any luau comes to a gourmet
feast. The open-air grounds are gorgeous, and the service is excellent. All
in all, one of the most upscale luau experiences around.
Island Breeze, the folks behind the Gathering of the Kings, also hosts the
more traditional-style and affordable Island Breeze Luau at King
Kamehameha’s Kona Beach Hotel in Kailua-Kona Sunday and Tuesday to

This ultradeluxe Polynesian-style resort is the ideal place for a luau, and
you’d be hard-pressed to find a better one. The food is beautifully prepared
and well labeled (so you know what you’re eating); and the traditional imu

tural gist. The South Pacific revue is fast-moving and lots of fun, if not
entirely authentic (I don’t think that cowboy hulas occurred in old Hawaii).
The fire dancer is a showstopper, of course, and everyone involved is a
first-rate entertainer. The setting isn’t oceanfront, but it’s lovely nonethe-

 Locating the Big Island’s best beaches
 Enjoying the sun and surf
 Exploring Hawaii’s top attractions — including an active volcano!
 Scoping out the shopping scene
 Enjoying yourself on this rural isle after sunset
T
he Big Island’s top attraction — and the most spectacular attraction
in the entire state — is Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. But the Big
Island is no one-trick pony; it boasts a wealth of wonderful and one-of-a-
kind attractions that you won’t want to miss.
Check with the excellent Maui-based activity center Tom Barefoot’s
Tours (% 800-621-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com), which
may be able to save you a few dollars on many of the Big Island’s activi-
ties on land and sea.
Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Some visitors to the Big Island complain that the island has only ugly
dark-sand beaches, not the pretty white ones most people associate
with a tropical paradise. The Big Island is the youngest island in the
Hawaii chain, geologically speaking; as it matures over the next few mil-
lennia, the shores will pumice into the fine white sands you’re used to.
But if it’s unusual-looking beaches you’re after, the Big Island features
the most eye-popping collection you’ll ever see: black-sand ones, salt-
and-pepper ones, lava-covered ones, even a green-sand one. And yes, the
island also happens to already boast some of the dreamiest white sands
in Hawaii, at Hapuna Beach State Park.
Combing the beaches
Safety takes top priority at the beach. Never turn your back on the ocean;
big waves can come out of nowhere in a matter of minutes. Some beaches
regularly have lifeguards on duty, not all of them. At beaches without life-
guards, keep an eye out for posted signs warning of dangerous currents
or conditions. Winter surf is generally rough and unpredictable, although
some beaches can be counted on for calm waters in any season. Others

have dangerous rip currents year-round, making swimming inadvisable
for all but the strongest swimmers. Do your homework: Check out the fol-
lowing beach descriptions and, after you’re on the Big Island, make
inquiries about local surf conditions.
Also, never leave valuables in your rental car while you’re at the beach —
not even in the glove box. Thieves can be in and out of your car before
you’ve finished slathering on your sunscreen. Remote beaches, in particu-
lar, are magnets for thieves.
Along the Kohala Coast
All these fabulous beaches are located on the dry leeward side of the
island, along the Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19) north of 
the Kona Airport.
Hapuna Beach State Park
Wow! If forced to choose, I’d name this as my favorite beach in all Hawaii.
This big, gorgeous stretch has it all: glorious turquoise surf, a half-mile-
long crescent of powdery-fine white sand (backed by green lawns, so you
can picnic without getting sand in your lunch), and the best facilities on
the coast. Hapuna is simply magical, especially in the gentle seasons when
the beach is widest, the ocean is calmest, and crowds — both locals and
visitors — come out to swim, play, and ride the easy waves. One of the
best things about this stunning beach is that it’s a blast even when it’s
crowded. The Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel is tucked away at the north end,
but you barely notice it. Venture nearer to the hotel only if you’re looking
to snorkel; the cove at its base is your best bet. The excellent facilities
include restrooms, showers, pavilions, picnic tables, barbecues, Hapuna
Harry’s for snacks and beach toys, and plenty of parking. If you’re on this
coast, don’t miss it. Beware the waves in winter, though, when the big surf
can be very dangerous.
See map p. 368. Off Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19), about 27 miles north
of Kona Airport (3 miles south of Kawaihae, where Highway 19 turns inland toward
Waimea).
Kaunaoa (Mauna Kea) Beach
The Mauna Kea Beach Hotel would like to keep this curving gem all to itself,
no doubt. And who can blame them? Kaunaoa (cow-a-no-ah) is one of the
Big Island’s finest and most well-protected cove beaches. But because all
Hawaii beaches are public, you can come, too, even if you’re not staying at
the ritzy resort. The gorgeous beige sands slope gently into the bay, where
the calm, warm waters are often populated by schools of colorful tropical
fish and green sea turtles, making this a wonderful snorkeling spot (espe-
cially near the rocky points). Swimming is excellent year-round. Non–hotel
guests are relegated to one small section of the beach, and facilities are lim-
ited to restrooms and showers (no lifeguard). Don’t be surprised if you’re
not warmly greeted at the gate; the hotel prefers to keep the public-access
crowd small — but you’re perfectly entitled to be here.

Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 369

See map p. 368. At the Mauna Kea Resort, off Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway
19), 28 miles north of Kona Airport (about 21⁄2 miles south of Kawaihae, where Highway
19 turns inland toward Waimea). To get there: Turn west at the Mauna Kea Beach
Hotel entrance and ask for a beach pass from security; follow the road to the public
beach parking area, at the end of the road (through the hotel and past registration).
Anaehoomalu Bay (A-Bay)
This popular beach — called Anaehoomalu (ah-na-ay-ho-o-ma-loo), or A-Bay
for short — is the most beautiful of the Big Island’s salt-and-peppery
beaches. It’s long and curvaceous, with pretty fine-grained sand and a lovely
grove of swaying coconut palms. The beach fronts the Waikoloa Beach
Marriott, but it’s easily accessible. The beach is wider near the hotel, and
narrows into a more intimate, palm-dotted dune closer to the public-access
parking lot. The sand slopes gently from shallow to deep water; swimming,
kayaking, and windsurfing are all terrific here; and the snorkeling is very
good at the end nearest the hotel. At the far edge of the bay is a rare turtle-
cleaning station, where snorkelers and divers can watch endangered green
sea turtles line up, waiting their turn to have small fish clean them. The
hotel’s friendly beach boys usually have the area marked so that you can
make your way out to see the action. Facilities include restrooms, showers,
and plenty of parking (not always a given at resort-adjacent beaches), plus
excellent beach-gear rentals at the north (hotel) end of the beach.
See map p. 368. At the Waikoloa Beach Marriott, just off Queen Kaahumanu Highway
(Highway 19), 18 miles north of Kona Airport. To get there: Turn west at the stone gate
marked “Waikoloa,” left at the stop sign, and then follow the road to the parking lot.
On the Kona-Keauhou Coast
These playful beach parks are located on the sunny Kona Coast; they’re
all accessible from the Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19).
Kekaha Kai (Kona Coast) State Park
If you really want some sand to yourself, head to this remote beach park,
which is separated from civilization by nearly 2 miles of vast lava fields.
The road that reaches the beach has been recently repaved — and what
awaits at the end is worth the drive for solitude seekers: a half-dozen long,
curving, unspoiled gold-sand beaches, with well-protected coves that are
great for swimming in the gentle seasons. Even if a few other folks are
around, you’ll find plenty of stretches of sand that you can have all to your-
self. Stay out of the water in winter, when the swells come, but you may
want to visit anyway to kick back on the sand and see the surfers in action.
Facilities are minimal — nothing more than a few picnic tables and
portable toilets — so be sure to bring your own drinking water.
See map p. 368. Off Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19), 2 3⁄4 miles north of
Kona Airport. To get there: Turn left at the sign and follow the bumpy road 1 3⁄4 miles
to the coast. Open: Thurs–Tues 8 a.m.–8 p.m.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
370

White Sands (Magic Sands) Beach
This petite white-sand pocket of beach is an oddity on this lava-rock coast
in more ways than one: Not only are darker and coarser beaches more
common on this coast, but the beach itself sometimes vanishes com-
pletely, washed away by high tides or winter waves or during storms. It
usually reappears in short order, just like it never went away. The small
waves are great for just-learning boogie boarders and bodysurfers; on calm
summer days, the water is good for swimming and snorkeling too.
Facilities include restrooms, showers, lifeguards, and a small parking lot.
White Sands doesn’t warrant a long drive, but it’s conveniently situated
for those staying in the Kailua-Kona or Keauhou areas.
See map p. 368. Adjacent to Kona Magic Sands condos, 77–6452 Alii Dr., 41⁄2 miles
south of Kailua-Kona.
Kahaluu Beach Park
Kahaluu (ka-ha-loo-oo) isn’t exactly the prettiest beach in the islands: It’s
narrow, salt-and-peppery, close to the busy road (a situation softened by
some coconut palms that serve as a buffer), and almost always blanket-
to-blanket crowded. But it’s one of the finest snorkeling beaches in all
Hawaii, with a shore that gently slopes to shallow, well-protected turquoise
pools. The water is so clear and rich with marine life that all you have to
do is wade in and look down. If you’re a first-time snorkeler, this is the
place to learn, but even advanced fish-watchers will be thrilled with the
schools of brilliantly colored tropical fish that weave in and out of the well-
established reef. The odds are great for spotting sea turtles here. (On my
last visit, I spotted ten turtles in the first 20 minutes!) Great facilities are
on hand, including a parking lot, beach-gear rentals, a covered pavilion,
and a snack bar. Come early to stake out your spot. Riptides sometimes
kick up in winter, though, so check the lifeguard warning flags. (Red means
stay out of the water.)
See map p. 368. On Alii Drive, 51⁄2 miles south of Kailua-Kona.
On the Hilo-Volcano coast
On the lush windward coast, the island’s beaches become fewer and far
between, but more breathtakingly unusual.
Leleiwi Beach Park
If you get a beautiful beach day while you’re in Hilo, head to picture-per-
fect Leleiwi (lay-lay-ee-vee) Beach. This lovely palm-fringed cove of black-
lava tide pools fed by freshwater springs and rippled by gentle waves is a
photographer’s delight and the ideal place to take a dip. The shallow pools
are generally calm and ideal for little ones, especially in the protected
inlets at the center of the park. Sea turtles make this beach the locals’
favorite snorkel spot; playful spinner dolphins appear on occasion, too.
Facilities include restrooms, showers, and picnic pavilions.
See map p. 368. On Kalanianaole Avenue, 4 miles west of Hilo.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 371

Punaluu (Black Sand) Beach Park
If you’re driving the south route between Volcano and Kona, stop here if
you want to set your eyes on a genuine black-sand beach, the only one
that’s still accessible. (The others have been blocked by lava flows.) Stay
out of the water year-round because the offshore currents are strong
(although you’re likely to see some daredevil surfers taking on the waves),
but the sands are great for sunbathing and picnicking. (Keep your distance
from the turtles who often come on shore to nest.) If you do venture into
the water, do it in summer and be extremely careful. Picnic pavilions and
restrooms are located across the road.
See map p. 368. Off the Hawaii Belt Road (Highway 11), about 30 miles south of
Volcano Village. (The turnoff is well marked.)
At land’s end
The southernmost point in the United States is Ka Lae, or South Point.
There’s not much down here, except some rocky cliffs and remarkable
ocean views, but I love coming anyway: Standing at this dramatic, deso-
late, windswept place (hold on to your hat!) actually feels like you’re stand-
ing at the end of the earth.
Ka Lae (South Point) and Papakolea (Green Sand) Beach
Down at South Point is Green Sand Beach, worth seeing for its olive-green
sands (actually crushed olivine, a green semiprecious mineral found in
eruptive rocks and meteorites). It’s a bear to reach, however, so most
people don’t bother. You need a four-wheel-drive vehicle and a hearty con-
stitution to traverse the 21⁄2-mile path from the Kaulana Boat Ramp to the
cliffs overlooking the beach. You can also walk it, if you wear sturdy shoes
and bring water. The trail is relatively flat, but you’re usually walking into
the wind as you head toward the beach. After about 30 or 40 minutes,
you’ll see an eroded cinder cone by the water; continue to the edge, where
the green sands lie below.
I highly recommend that you simply take in the view from the cliff above
the beach (which is actually very good) because the trail to the sand is
difficult and treacherous, requiring you to drop down (and climb back up)
4 to 5 feet in spots. If the surf’s up, don’t even think about it — and stay out
of the water anywhere along South Point entirely.
See map p. 368. At the end of South Point Road, 12 miles south of Mamalahoa
Highway (Highway 11).
Getting Your Feet Wet
Although the east (Hilo-Volcano) coast does have some accessible
beaches (see the preceding section), the west (Kona-Kohala) coast is 
the exclusive domain of watersports on the Big Island.
If you’re coming to the islands to learn to surf, you’re better off on Oahu
or Maui. Big Island surfing is best left to the experts.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
372

Snorkeling
The Big Island boasts wonderful opportunities for snorkeling, possibly
the best in all the islands. One of Hawaii’s absolute best snorkel spots is
Kealakekua (kay-ah-lah-kay-koo-ah) Bay. The coral in this underwater
marine life preserve is the most beautiful I’ve ever seen, and the calm,
clear waters teem with a kaleidoscope of colorful reef fish, octopuses,
and moray eels; what’s more, a pod of playful spinner dolphins often
comes by to say hi. The bay can be reached only by snorkel cruise or
kayak, however. For details on getting there, see the section “On-deck
adventures — ocean cruising,” later in this chapter. Fair Wind is my
favorite snorkel-cruise operator. Accomplished kayakers can also paddle
their way there; see “Ocean kayaking,” later in this chapter.
The Kona and Kohala coasts also boast a bunch of wonderful snorkeling
beaches where you can simply wade in and see the colorful aquatic life.
The best is Kahaluu Beach Park, but you might also have some fish- and
turtle-spotting luck at Anaehoomalu Bay, Kaunaoa Beach, White Sands
Beach, at the north end of Hapuna Beach, or even right at the foot of
your hotel, if you’re lucky enough to be staying at a beachfront resort.
(The Mauna Lani Bay Hotel, the Fairmont Orchid, and Kona Village are
particularly good choices; see Chapter 14.)
All the Big Island’s dive shops arrange snorkel cruises and/or take expe-
rienced snorkelers out on their dive trips. Jack’s Diving Locker even
takes snorkelers out on their night dives with manta rays. See the sec-
tion “Scuba diving,” later in this chapter, for details.
One of the locals’ favorite snorkeling spots is in South Kona, in the cove
right next to the Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park. (See
the section “More attractions worth seeking out,” later in this chapter.)
It’s not the kind of place where you’ll want to sunbathe all day, but it is a
great spot for adventurous snorkelers looking for something different,
and has an abundance of colorful reef fish and sea turtles. To get there,
follow Highway 11 south from Kailua-Kona to mile marker 103 (about 
22 miles); turn right at the sign onto Highway 160 and follow it 31⁄2 miles
downslope to the national park and coast. Come early in the day before
the waves kick up, bring your own gear, and turn right before you get to
the entrance kiosk; the road will take you down to the boat ramp and
snorkel area.
You can rent snorkel gear from Snorkel Bob’s (% 808-329-0770; www.
snorkelbob.com) at the south end of Kailua-Kona town (see the “Kailua-
Kona Town” map, later in this chapter). The address is 75–5831 Kahakai
St., but it’s actually on Alii Drive (Kailua-Kona’s main drag) right in front
of Huggo’s restaurant. There’s also a second location right near the air-
port in the Hale Kui Plaza, just north of the boat harbor, at 73-4976
Kamanu St. (% 808-329-0771); turn mauka (toward the mountain) on
Hina-lani Street, and follow it to Kamanu Street.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 373

The best-quality gear — the “Ultimate Truth” — rents for $32 a week
($22 per week for kids) for the mask/snorkel/fins set. For an additional
$12, nearsighted snorkelers can opt for prescription masks (including
snorkel and fins set). Budget travelers can rent basic gear for just $9 
per week. You can also rent boogie boards, life vests, wet suits, beach
chairs, and so on. The shop is open every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. You
don’t need to reserve gear in advance, but if you prefer to plan ahead,
you can book your gear over the phone at % 800-262-7725 or online at
www.snorkelbob.com.
Safety is key when snorkeling. See “Ocean Safety,” in the Quick
Concierge at the end of this book, for snorkeling tips.
On-deck adventures — ocean cruising
When the Pacific humpback whales make their annual visit to Hawaii
from Alaska from December to March, they swim right by the Big Island.
In season, virtually all cruise boats combine whale-watching with their
regular outings.
If you want to go sportfishing off the world-famous Kona Coast, see the
section “Hooking the big one,” later in this chapter.
Body Glove Cruises
The 51-foot, 100-passenger trimaran Body Glove runs cruises to Pawai Bay,
north of Kailua-Kona, a marine preserve with excellent snorkeling and 
dolphin-watching opportunities year-round. The year-round morning
cruise features 21⁄2 hours of snorkel time (total sailing time is 41⁄2 hours),
whereas the afternoon cruise (offered Apr–Nov) features 11⁄2 hours of snor-
keling. Both the 15-foot water slide and high-dive board will get you into
the drink immediately, and they’re real kid-pleasers. Scuba upgrades with
PADI-certified (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) trainers and
dive masters are available as well. In winter, the afternoon sail becomes a
three-hour whale-watching excursion, complete with a naturalist onboard.
Cruises depart from Kailua Pier, off Alii Drive, Kailua-Kona. % 800-551-8911 or
808-326-7122. www.bodyglovehawaii.com. 41⁄2-hour snorkel-sails: $112 adults, $72
kids ages 6–17, free for kids age 5 and under. 3-hour afternoon snorkel-sails or whale-
watching trips (offered only Dec–Mar): $66 adults, $44 ages 6–17, free for kids age 5
and under. Scuba rates $61–$81 higher, depending on whether you need gear or
instruction. Morning cruises include continental breakfast and buffet deli lunch; after-
noon sails include snacks.

25 years, who leads excellent whale-watching tours along the Kona Coast
year-round. Sure, you’ll only spot the visiting humpbacks from December
through April, but you can see pilot whales, sperm whales, false killer and
pygmy killer whales, melon-headed whales, and beaked whales, as well as
five kinds of dolphins, in any month. Knowledgeable and engaging, Captain
Dan and his crew are experts at knowing where to look for these wonder-
ful creatures so that you can watch them, undisturbed, in their natural
habitat. (He frequently drops an underwater video camera and/or micro-
phone into the water so that you can see them clearly and listen to their
songs.) What’s more, he professes to have a 99 percent success rate at
finding humpbacks in season. But if, for some reason, you don’t see any
whales at all on your trip, Captain Dan will take you out again for free —
not a bad guarantee! This trip is terrific for visitors of all ages.

No cruises May through early July.
Captain Zodiac Raft Expeditions
Captain Zodiac leads four-hour snorkel cruises to Kealakekua Bay aboard
16-passenger, 24-foot fiberglass-bottom rubber boats (zodiacs); these inflat-
ables, pioneered by Jacques Cousteau, have minimal environmental impact,
sit low to the water, and cruise fast over the waves for a thrill-a-minute ride.
On the way to Kealakekua — one of the best snorkel spots in all Hawaii (see
the section “Snorkeling,” earlier in this chapter) — you’ll search for spinner
dolphins and green sea turtles (plus humpback whales in season) and then
spend more than an hour snorkeling in the bay. On the return, if conditions
permit, the captain takes you exploring sea caves that only these small,
easily maneuverable boats can reach. This expedition is an excellent choice
for adventuresome types. Morning and afternoon cruises are available, as
is a three-hour whale-watching trip in season.

Fair Wind Snorkel Cruises & Orca Raft Adventures
Family-owned and -operated since 1971, this absolutely terrific company
offers my favorite sail-and-snorkel cruises to Kealakekua Bay, the best
snorkel spot in all Hawaii, period. The company’s vessels — the Fair Wind
I and the new state-of-the-art Hula Kai — are comfortable and loaded with
amenities and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
The 60-foot catamaran, the Fair Wind II, has room for about a hundred or
so passengers. It’s an impeccably maintained boat complete with easy-
access water stairs (so you can literally walk into the water), a 15-foot
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 375

water slide, wide-open decks (plus plenty of covered areas if you prefer to
stay out of the sun), a barbecue grill for lunchtime burgers, and freshwa-
ter showers. The boat (including bathrooms) is fully wheelchair accessi-
ble. The smaller, 55-foot Hula Kai (built in 2005) is a Teknicraft power
catamaran with cushioned seating (the best on any snorkel boat on the
islands) and other excellent comfort features, such as state-of-the-art rest-
rooms and freshwater showers. The Hula Kai is an excellent choice for
those who want a first-class experience in a more intimate sailing envi-
ronment. Scuba diving is available onboard.
All levels of snorkelers are welcome: Fair Wind provides all manner of float-
ies and assistance to those who want it and leave experienced swimmers
and snorkelers pretty much to do their own thing (within the established
boundaries, of course). Fair Wind is also a great way to experience Snuba,
a cross between snorkeling and scuba diving that allows you to go as much
as 20 feet below the surface of the water without getting certification or
carrying cumbersome oxygen tanks.
Book ahead, because these cruises fill up fast.

noon cruises include snacks. Scuba add-on $65–$75 extra.
Kamanu Charters
If you want to snorkel in untouristed Pawai Bay but you prefer a more inti-
mate experience than the Body Glove offers, go instead with the Kamanu,
a late-model 36-foot catamaran that limits its crowds to about two dozen
per sail. This route is a good choice for first-time snorkelers (instruction
and all the necessary gear are provided) and nonswimmers because a wide
array of alternative flotation devices is available.
Cruises depart Honokohau Harbor, off Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19), 21⁄2

Scuba diving
With calm, warm waters (75–81°F), 100-plus-foot visibility, and an open
drop-off that supports a wealth of colorful marine life of all shapes and
sizes, the Kona-Kohala coast offers some of the best scuba diving in the
world (including excellent opportunities to swim with manta rays).
Conditions are so good, in fact, that scuba magazines regularly name it
among the best diving destinations in the world.

Jack’s Diving Locker, in the Coconut Grove Marketplace, 75–5819 Alii
Dr., Kailua-Kona (% 800-345-4807 or 808-329-7585; www.jacksdiving
locker.com), is consistently chosen by readers of Rodale’s Scuba Diving
magazine as the best dive shop in the Indo-Pacific, and one of the best in
the world. Two-tank boat and shore dives start at $125, and night dives
with manta rays are $145. Jack’s trips book up fast, so be sure to reserve
in advance.
Jack’s also offers a full slate of introductory dives and is the best dive
shop on the island for kids who want to learn: Skin-diver programs are
available for kids ages 8 and up, and open-water instruction is offered to
kids 12 and older.
If you have little experience but a yen to learn and become certified, Big
Island Watersports (% 808-324-1650; www.snubabigisland.com) is an
excellent outfitter for those in need of first-time instruction and certifica-
tion courses.
Red Sail Sports (% 877-RED-SAIL or 808-886-2876; www.redsail
hawaii.com), which operates watersports and dive centers from the
Hapuna Beach Prince Resort and Hilton Waikoloa Village hotels, hosts
two-tank dives and night dives aboard its 38-foot Delta dive boat (the
Lani Kai) to a number of unique sites accessible from the Kohala Coast;
prices run $98 to $155. Red Sail also offers a one-day introductory scuba
instruction package — including pool instruction, a one- or two-tank
boat dive, and all equipment — for $175 to $190 per person. Check out
Red Sail’s full slate of snorkel cruises, whale-watching trips, sunset sails,
and kayak adventures.
If you want the once-in-a-lifetime experience of night diving with manta
rays, contact Sea Paradise (% 800-322-KONA or 808-322-2500; www.
seaparadise.com). Cruises aboard the company’s 46-foot catamaran,
the Hokuhele, depart from Keauhou for the short trip to “manta village,”
where the graceful creatures congregate for feeding at night. Both
snorkelers and scuba divers are invited. Snorkelers pay $85 for adults,
$59 for kids 4 to 12; certified divers pay $110.
If you want to dive from the volcano side of the island, your best choice
is Nautilus Dive Center, 382 Kamehameha Ave., between Open Market
and the Shell Gas Station, Hilo (% 808-935-6939; www.nautilusdive
hilo.com), where dive charter prices start at $85 for both certified
divers and beginners.
Also keep in mind that both Body Glove and Fair Wind offer scuba
upgrades for divers aboard their cruises to Palani Bay and Kealakekua
Bay, respectively; see the section “On-deck adventures — ocean cruis-
ing,” earlier in this chapter.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 377

Ocean kayaking
Kayaking is another great way to explore Kealakekua Bay, especially if
you’d prefer an up-close, unmotorized relationship with the water and the
marine life around you. It’s quite easy to learn, as long as you know how to
swim: Just get on your sit-on-top kayak, find your balance, and paddle.
That said, I highly recommend taking a guided kayak tour if you’re inex-
perienced, because there are nuances to launching your kayak, dealing
with surf, and getting on and off your kayak in open water. Even if you’re
an experienced kayaker, you may find that going out with a guide offers
the better experience, because the guides know the best snorkel spots,
the history of the area, and where the spinner dolphins like to hang out.
Hawaiian-owned and -operated Aloha Kayak Co. (% 877-322-1444 or
808-322-2868; www.alohakayak.com) offers 21⁄2- to 4-hour guided kayak-
and-snorkel tours from Keauhou Bay for $59 to $79 for adults, and $30 to
$40 for kids under 12, including all equipment and snacks. Reservations
are required at least 24 hours in advance.
If you have some experience under your belt, you can rent single kayaks
for $35 a day, tandem kayaks for $60, with all gear (including a cooler and
car rack). Friendly guys at the shop will point you to the best launch
spots. Half-day and weekly rates are also available, as well as glass-bottom
kayaks and snorkel-gear rentals. Most convenient to Kealakekua Bay is the
Honalo location, on the ocean side of Highway 11 at 79–7428 Mamalahoa
Hwy., across from the 114 mile marker and Teshima’s restaurant.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
378
Try-it diving for beginners: Snuba
If you’ve always been interested in trying scuba but haven’t gotten around to the has-
sles and expense of certification, you can sample a very close approximation: Snuba.
I highly encourage you to try it if you’re so inclined, because Snuba is a marvelous
introduction to the kind of underwater exploration that scuba offers, without any nec-
essary preparation.
With Snuba, you wear a mask and a regulator that’s connected via a 25-foot-long hose
to an oxygen tank that floats on the surface, thereby allowing you to dive deep and
simulate the scuba experience without full training (or a heavy air tank attached to
your back). A great place to try it is with Fair Wind Snorkel Cruises (see the section
“On-deck adventures — ocean cruising,” earlier in this chapter). All it takes is about
15 minutes of instruction; you’ll get about 45 minutes of underwater time. No advance
booking is necessary — the Snuba instructor asks on the way out if you’re interested
in participating. Call ahead to the Fair Wind office to confirm that Snuba will be offered
on your cruise if your heart’s set on trying it.
If you’d like to skip the snorkel cruise and go directly to Snuba, contact Big Island
Watersports (% 808-324-1650; www.snubabigisland.com); both shore and boat
dives are offered daily starting at $89 per person shore dive, $145 boat dive.

Another great option for kayak tours and rentals is Ocean Safaris
(% 808-326-4699; www.oceansafariskayaks.com), also located at the
marina at Keauhou Bay. Prices are similar; bargain hunters and those on
the quest of dolphin sightings might consider the Early Riser Dolphin
Tour, which leaves at 7 a.m., the prime dolphin activity hour ($35 per
person).
Lastly, consider Kona Boys, 79-8539 Mamalahoa Hwy., Kealakekua 
(% 808-328-1234; www.konaboys.com), for single-kayak ($47) and
double-kayak ($67) rentals. Also give them a call for details on their 
variety of half-day guided kayak and kayak-snorkel tours.
Hooking the big one
If you want to catch fish, you’ve come to the right place. Big-game fish
(including monster blue, black, and striped marlin), spearfish, tuna (ahi,
aku, and albacore), mahimahi, ono (also known as wahoo), and other
good eating fish, as well as barracuda and shark, roam the deep, warm
“fish-rich” Kona waters. There are no guarantees, but few anglers come
away empty-handed. More than 100 charter boats depart from four har-
bors along the island’s west coast, but the epicenter for Hawaii sport-
fishing is Honokohau Harbor, located off the Queen Kaahumanu Highway
(Highway 19) 21⁄2 miles south of the Kona Airport.
The best way to arrange a charter is through a charter boat booking
agency before your trip, and the best in Kona is The Charter Desk at
Honokohau Marina (% 888-KONA-4-US or 808-329-5735; www.charter
desk.com). The Charter Desk’s booking agents are real pros; they know
the best boats in Honokohau Harbor, and they’ll sort through the more
than 50 different available boats, fishing specialties, and personalities to
match you up with the boat and crew that’s right for you. When you
book with the Charter Desk, you can be sure that your boat captain is
licensed by the United States Coast Guard, and the boat is fully insured.
Most big-game charter boats carry six passengers maximum. Half-day
and full-day charters are available, and boats supply all equipment, bait,
tackle, and lures. You don’t need a fishing license on a charter boat.
Prices start at around $80 to $140 for a half-day share charter (where
you share the boat with strangers), $190 for a full day. Private charters
range from $300 to $600 for a half-day, $500 to $900 for a full day.
Understand that if you go for a share, you’ll have to rotate rods, so you
won’t get a full four hours of fishing in on a half-day charter. If you’re cal-
culating time-for-dollars spent, you’re better off booking your own boat,
especially if two or three of you are along to split the costs.
One of the best charters on the coast — and an especially good option
for first-timers — is the aptly named Bite Me Sportfishing (% 808-936-
3442; www.bitemesportfishing.com). (See the section “On-deck
adventures — ocean cruising,” earlier in this chapter.) Captain Brian
Wargo will take you out on the Bite Me, a 40-foot air-conditioned turbo
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 379

twin diesel Uniflite vessel, in search of blue, black, and striped marlin;
yellowfin tuna; mahimahi; and other impressive big-game fish. Wargo has
excellent experience catching 500-plus-pound marlin. These are private
fishing charters only with a capacity for up to six passengers, running
five lines at a time. A full-day charter is $650, and a half-day is $395. A
half-day share charter is $109.
In addition, you may also consider booking your boat through Hawaii
Fishing Adventures and Charters (% 877-388-1376; www.sportfish
hawaii.com), which represents about close to a dozen boats based at
Honokohau Harbor, starting at $395 for a half-day private charter. Or try
Charter Services Hawaii (% 800-567-2650; www.konazone.com). If
you’re an experienced angler and prefer to book with a boat captain
directly, consider chartering the Anxious (% 808-326-1229; www.aloha
zone.com), owned by Captain Neal Isaacs.
If you’re interested in light-tackle sportfishing for smaller catches, 
contact Reel Action Light Tackle Sportfishing (% 808-325-6811; www.
fishkona.org/reel_action.html), which can take you out spinning,
bottom-fishing, or trolling for smaller catches. For a real thrill, try ocean
fly-fishing for giant tuna or marlin. Rates range from $100 to $200 per
person on a shared boat, or $400 to $900 for the whole boat (up to six
people) for an eight-hour trip.
Exploring Dry Land
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Visiting Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park is one of the most thrilling things that you can do on the planet. I
know that coming within spitting distance of an active volcano was defi-
nitely one of the highlights of my life. But the excitement doesn’t end
there. Do what you can to budget plenty of time to see at least a few
faces of this wonderfully multifaceted island.
Sightseeing with a guide
If your mobility is limited, or if you’re short on time and you want an
introductory look at the big picture, you may want to hook up with a
guided tour. But if you’ve rented a car and can get around easily on your
own, driving yourself is definitely the way to see the island. But if you’re
going to take a guided bus tour of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, do
yourself a favor — take the more detailed one that departs from nearby
Hilo, rather than the deadly long Circle Island tour that leaves from Kona
and incorporates more than five hours of driving and a good half-dozen
stops into an endurance-challenging 9- to 12-hour day (ultimately short
shrifting the national park in the process). Or, better yet, if you don’t
mind a little hiking in your trip, book the 12-hour Volcanoes Adventure
offered by conservation-minded outfitter Hawaii Forest & Trail (% 800-
464-1993; www.hawaii-forest.com), which travels full circle from the
Kona-Kohala coast and offers more insight into the park and its geology
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
380

and history than you’re likely to glean in a three-day visit on your own.
(See the section “Enjoying guided nature tours,” later in this chapter.)
Polynesian Adventure Tours (% 800-622-3011 or 808-833-8000; www.
polyad.com) offers a range of guided tours in minivans, big-windowed
mini-coaches (good for small groups and big views), and full-size buses.
Their tours tend to be a little more action-oriented than those offered by
competing companies. Expect to spend $65 to $79 per person ($44–$53
for kids 3–11), depending on the tour that you choose and your depar-
ture point.
Roberts Hawaii (% 866-898-2519 or 808-954-8652; www.roberts
hawaii.com) is Hawaii’s biggest name in narrated bus tours. Roberts
offers a circle-island tour for $65 adults, $52 children ages 4 to 11.
I recommend only going out with Polynesian Adventure and Roberts 
if you have mobility or other issues that prevent you from going on 
your own.
Book your Polynesian Adventure or Roberts Hawaii tour online and
score a 10 percent price break.
If you do opt for a guided tour that takes you around the entire island,
remember: It will be chillier on the east coast than it is on the west
coast, so bring a jacket or sweater for your volcano visit. It’s also a good
idea to bring along rain gear and/or an umbrella, as well as sturdy
closed-toe walking shoes.
Enjoying guided nature tours
If you want to experience the Big Island’s natural world, I highly recom-
mend going out with a guide. An expert guide can really help you appre-
ciate the majesty of this fantastic island and even take you into areas
that you couldn’t otherwise reach on your own. Even if hiking and
nature exploring aren’t parts of your daily life, don’t worry; you won’t be
required to be in racing shape. All the following terrific tour companies
offer adventures for every level of experience and ability.
My absolute favorite Big Island outfitter is Hawaii Forest & Trail (% 800-
464-1993 or 808-331-8505; www.hawaii-forest.com), named 2006
Ecotour Operator of the Year by the Hawaii Ecotourism Association and
recipient of the 2007 Keep It Hawaii Award. I first explored the Big Island
with naturalist and educator Rob Pacheco back in 1995, and it was one of
the best — and most fun — nature experiences of my life; so I’m thrilled
to see his first-rate business growing and widening its options for visi-
tors. I never miss an opportunity to go out with Hawaii Forest & Trail
when I’m on the Big Island — you just can’t go wrong with these guys.
Both half- and full-day trips are available; they’re all personalized to a
group’s interest and ability levels and often feature easy or moderate
walking. (Ask when you book if you’re concerned.) Regularly scheduled
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 381

half-day adventures include the Kohala Waterfalls Adventure, which
takes you into private lands on the Kohala Coast to discover hidden
waterfalls and killer views along a family-friendly 3-mile hike.
Full-day outings include the Kilauea Volcano Adventure, a 12-hour trip
from the Kona-Kohala coast to the splendid Hamakua Coast and Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park that’s the best introduction to the active vol-
cano and volcanology that there is. If you have only one day to see the
volcano, see it this way.
Another one-of-a-kind eight-hour adventure that makes lifetime memories
is the Mauna Kea Summit & Stars Adventure, in which your astronomer
guide takes you across Parker Ranch pastureland — gorgeous wide-open
landscape that you never thought you’d see in Hawaii — to the (often
snow-capped) summit of Mauna Kea (at 13,796 ft.), one of the best and
most famous stargazing spots in the world, dotted with a world-class
array of telescopes from the world’s foremost astronomical observato-
ries. At dusk, you’ll descend to 9,000 feet for an incredible lesson in astro-
nomical observation in a night sky unlike any other you’ve ever seen.
Dinner is included, and the outing is restricted to adults only (no kids
under age 16). This trip is a total blast; everyone on ours agreed that it
was the best thing they’d done in Hawaii.
Although you can visit the summit of Mauna Kea on your own, you must
have a four-wheel-drive vehicle and approval from the rental company
(difficult to get) in order to drive on Saddle Road and the summit road.
You’ll also need parkas to withstand the icy temperatures at the summit,
which the guides issue. Finally, you should be accustomed to driving at
high altitudes and need to know a bit about astronomy and the night sky
to get anything out of your visit. For these reasons, I highly recommend
just going with Hawaii Forest & Trail instead.
PinzTrek Off-Road Adventures combine breathtaking natural sightsee-
ing with exciting off-roading aboard a six-wheel-drive Pinzgauer, a 1970s
Swiss Army vehicle. These half-day adventures are great for kids, or
even older folks who don’t mind the bumpy ride, because the vehicles
can reach views and landscapes that are accessible only through ardu-
ous hiking (some are not accessible at all, because the company has
exclusive access to private lands). Two different routes, both of which
include about a mile of walking, are available: the Kohala Wai, which
accesses remote North Kohala lands so you can peek into lush valleys
and view hidden waterfalls, and the Hualalai Holoholo route, a more
rugged volcanic landscape adventure.
A number of bird-watching adventures to private lands are also avail-
able. Rob, from Hawaii Forest & Trail, is a birder at heart and has exclu-
sive access to various private lands that showcase the ecological
diversity of the island, so there’s really no one better to go with if you’re
into bird-watching (or want to learn).
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
382

Call or check the Web site for details and schedules for these and other
adventures. Prices for half-day trips cost $109 to $135 for adults ($89–$99
for kids, but check to see which adventures are age-restricted). Full-day
trips run $155 to $195 per person ($120 for kids under 12; not all trips 
are appropriate for younger ones). Rates include food and all the gear 
that you’ll need. Prices are high, but you get your money’s worth and 
then some. All trips depart from the Kona-Kohala coast; some include
pickup and drop-off, whereas others have a designated meeting point.
Reservations should be made at least a week in advance. Note that certain
trips have restrictions based on age, weight, or health; be sure to confirm
these with the Hawaii Forest & Trail representative when you book. After
you arrive, you can also stop at the Hawaii Forest & Trail Headquarters
and Outfitting Store at 74–5035B Queen Kaahumanu Hwy. (Highway 19, on
the mountain side of the highway across from Honokahou Harbor, behind
the Chevron Station), Kailua-Kona, where you can book trips and pick up
outdoor equipment and nature-related gear and books.
If, for some reason, Hawaii Forest & Trail doesn’t meet your needs or
doesn’t go where you want to go, try Hawaiian Walkways (% 800-457-
7759 or 808-775-0372; www.hawaiianwalkways.com). This reliable outfit-
ter offers a variety of regularly scheduled full- and half-day hikes led by
excellent, enthusiastic guides. The Hawaii Ecotourism Association
named them tour operator of the year in 2002. The Waipio Waterfall
Adventure, a wonderful half-day hike that takes you along the rim of the
Big Island’s best-loved unspoiled valley, leaves daily at 9 a.m. You can
arrange other trips in advance, including a Kona Cloud Forest Botanical
Walk, a Kilauea Volcano Discovery Hike into Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park, a Saddle Road Exploration, or just about any part of the island
you’d like to visit. Prices range from $95 to $150 per person ($75–$95
kids under 12), depending on the trip you choose; all gear, food, and bev-
erages are provided.
If you can’t hook up with Hawaii Forest & Trail for its Mauna Kea Summit
and Stars, head to the top with Mauna Kea Summit Adventures (% 888-
332-2366 or 808-332-2366; www.maunakea.com), a company that has
been leading Mauna Kea tours exclusively for more than two decades.
The price is $190 per person, including dinner, all necessary equipment,
and parkas. You can arrange to meet your guide for your seven- to eight-
hour adventure in Kailua-Kona, or at the Kings Shops at Waikoloa, or the
Saddle Road junction. Reserve two weeks in advance, and you’ll save 15
percent.
Getting a bird’s-eye view — flightseeing tours
Flightseeing is a great way to explore this large, dynamic isle, which
boasts sheer cliffs, pristine valleys, gorgeous waterfalls, expansive lava
fields, and remote beaches that are otherwise inaccessible. And, of
course, there’s no better way to see that spectacular bubbling volcano,
especially if the current flow is too far from civilization to see from
accessible points in the national park.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 383

Blue Hawaiian Helicopters (% 800-745-BLUE or 808-961-5600; www.
bluehawaiian.com; 40- to 50-minute tours $177–$214 per person; two-
hour tour $380–$428 per person) is an excellent flightseeing company
that’s run by David and Patti Chevalier and a loyal staff. Blue Hawaiian
flies a fleet of American Eurocopter AStar 350 helicopters that carry six
passengers, providing each with a 180-degree view and a Bose noise-
canceling headset that lets you enjoy a surprisingly quiet ride. Recent
additions to the fleet are new technologically advanced Eco-Star copters,
which offer even better interior space, comfort, and views; the Eco-Star
flights are the most expensive options. For Hilo-based travelers, Blue
Hawaiian offers a 45- to 50-minute Circle of Fire volcano tour. From
Waikoloa, choose between the gorgeous 45- to 50-minute Kohala Coast
Adventure, which shows you the secret fluted valleys, majestic peaks,
and rugged coastline of the island’s northernmost point; and the Big
Island Spectacular, which takes you over the entire island, from rugged
coast and misty peaks to rain forest and volcano, all within two hours.
Tours depart from Waikoloa Heliport or Hilo Airport.
Book your tour well in advance, and check for substantial online dis-
counts — 15 percent off makes a huge difference at these prices.
You should consider the risks of flightseeing before you sign on.
Although all the companies that I recommend feature skilled pilots and
helicopters with excellent safety records, the truth of the matter is that
flightseeing is a somewhat risky business. Dozens of people have died 
in commercial helicopter crashes in Hawaii over the past decade. Of
course, just getting into your car and driving to dinner is far more dan-
gerous than catching a ’copter ride. Still, you should make informed
decisions when booking.
When reserving a helicopter tour with any company, check to make sure
that safety is its first concern. The company should be an FAA-certified
Part 135 operator, and the pilot should be Part 135 certified as well; the
135 license guarantees more stringent maintenance requirements and
pilot training programs than those who are only Part 91 certified. And if
weather conditions look iffy, reschedule.
Seeing Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
The top natural attraction in the islands, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
is the only destination in the entire U.S. National Parks system that’s
home to a live, lava-pumping volcano. This phenomenal park stands 
testament to 70 million years of volcanic activity, plate tectonics, and
evolution. It encompasses two volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea, and
spans 217,000 acres that reach from sea level to Mauna Loa’s towering
summit at 13,677 feet, and has both vast fields of black lava and an
ancient rain forest.
Both volcanoes are classified as active, but Mauna Loa hasn’t erupted
since 1984. Kilauea, on the other hand, is the most active volcano in the
world. An amazing geological phenomenon, it’s been erupting nonstop

Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 385

since January 3, 1983. Most volcanic flows last a while — several
months, maybe — but going for more than two and a half decades is
simply unheard of in the annals of scientific history. Until now, of course.
When most people think of active volcanoes, they think of Mount St.
Helens: A calm mountain suddenly blowing its stack, belching out
raging, destructive torrents of fire. Hawaii’s volcanoes, however, are
much more mellow geologic creatures: They’re shield volcanoes, which
erupt gradually — usually in a sort of gloopy, Jell-O–like fashion —
rather than in one big, fiery explosion. Thus, they allow for excellent,
safe viewing most of the time, giving you plenty of time to calmly move
out of the way if a blob of lava starts inching toward you (if you should
be lucky enough for park officials to let you get that close, which they
sometimes do). Leave it to Hawaii to have such laid-back volcanoes!
There are two lava flows going at this writing that you’ll be able to see, if
you’re lucky. The primary flow is from the Puu Oo (poo-oo oh-oh) vent to
the sea, where it spills into the ocean in a steaming stream. The hard-
ened lava trail has extended the shoreline seaward, adding new land to
the Big Island as it flows. It used to flow into the sea within the bounds
of the park, at the end of the park’s Chain of Craters Road. However, in
July 2007, changes in the eruption triggered the opening of new vents 
on Kilauea’s East Rift Zone, on the park’s eastern edge and beyond its
bounds, about 12 miles from Kilauea’s summit. Lava is (at this writing,
anyway) flowing into the ocean at Kalapana, at ocean’s edge in the
island’s Puna Region, about an hour’s drive from Volcano Village and 
45 minutes or so from Hilo.
To make matters even more exciting, in March 2008, Halemaumau (ha-
lay-mow-mow) Crater experienced its first explosive eruption since 1924,
followed by a second explosion in April, and it continues to emit gases
that glow in luminous red and orange in the after-dark hours. This one 
is located in the heart of the park, overlooked by the Jaggar Museum,
which has escaped harm thus far.
At press time, the lava flow was going stronger than ever and, despite an
11-day pause in September 1999, shows no signs of stopping anytime
soon, volcanologists say. But neither Mother Nature nor Madame Pele
(pell-ay), Hawaii’s volcano goddess who is said to reside in Kilauea’s
steaming Halemaumau Crater, runs on a fixed schedule. The volcano
could be shooting fountains of lava hundreds of feet into the air, or it
could be dormant on the day you arrive in the park (or the day after this
book goes to press, for that matter) — there are no guarantees.
What’s more, just because the lava is flowing doesn’t mean that you’ll be
able to witness it firsthand. On many days, the lava flows right by acces-
sible roads and within reach of hiking trails; you can get as close as the
heat will allow and even watch it dump into the sea — quite a dramatic
sight. At other times, the lava changes course, flowing miles away from
any accessible points, visible only in the distance (or from the air via
helicopter) or not at all (on occasion it sticks to underground lava
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
386

tubes). Furthermore, the recent flows have been emitting elevated
amounts of sulfurous gases and, at times, ash, which have required offi-
cials to keep visitors at safe distances from the flow at times, even when
it is technically accessible. On my last visit, the closest you could get to
the flow was about 2 miles distant due to the violence and toxicity of the
current eruption — but it was still a sight to behold even at a distance.
If you hear that the flow is going strong and the viewing is good (word
gets around quickly on this side of the island), don’t hesitate: Head
straight to the end of the road. You won’t be disappointed, I promise.
And don’t put it off until tomorrow, when the situation may be entirely
different.
If your visit happens to land during a period when the lava isn’t visible
at all, don’t be too disappointed — or, worse yet, consider your visit a
waste. Although I’ve been lucky enough to have some spectacular lava-
viewing experiences, my favorite day in the park was spent without even
seeing a speck of red. Trust me on this — visiting Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park is a one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-lifetime experience even with-
out the lava show.
Getting ready for your visit
For information before you go, contact Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
headquarters at % 808-985-6000, or visit the park’s official Web site at
www.nps.gov/havo, which features frequent updates on weather and
lava flows. The telephone number also serves as a 24-hour eruption
update and information hot line. Dial the same number (or visit the Web
site) to obtain camping information.
At press time, because the flow had breached the park’s boundary,
Hawaii County officials had opened a viewing area at the end of Highway
130, the Keaau-Pahoa Road, which connects to Highway 11 south of Hilo
in the town of Keaau. If you hear that the flow is still concentrated in the
Kalapana/Puna region on your arrival on the Big Island, call % 808-961-
8093 for the latest information on the lava viewing area, which was open
daily from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. (last car in at 8 p.m.) at this writing. Be pre-
pared for a long walk over rough lava, depending on where the lava is
flowing at the time; good shoes are a must, as are long pants, water, and
flashlights (one per person; most local hotels have them available for
borrowing). And keep in mind that the story could change dramatically
by the time you arrive.
Visit the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory site at
http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov for more complete information on Kilauea’s
recent eruption activity (including pictures) and past history. Another
excellent (albeit unofficial) site for general park information is www.
hawaii.volcanoes.national-park.com.
After you arrive on the island, you’ll find that most information kiosks
are stocked with a free booklet-size official visitor’s guide to the park. 
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 387

I recommend picking one up and reviewing it before your visit, because
it’s packed with practical details, historical background, and sightseeing
information — way more than I am able to supply in these pages.
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is on the Big Island’s east side, about 
30 miles southwest of Hilo along the Hawaii Belt Road (Highway 11). The
drive from Kailua-Kona is about 100 miles and takes 21⁄2 to 3 hours. For
the shortest drive, choose the south route (around South Point) if you’re
staying to the south of Kailua-Kona, the north route (through Waimea) if
you’re staying along the Kohala Coast.
The gateway town of Volcano Village, on the north side of the park off
Highway 11 just about a mile or so from the park entrance, is your best
bet for accommodations and dining (see Chapter 14).
Admission to the park is $10 per car ($5 for pedestrians), which allows
you to come and go as you please for seven days.
Keep these tips in mind as you plan your trip to Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park:
 You really need two or three days to explore the park and environs
thoroughly, so I recommend booking yourself a stay in Volcano
Village, the park’s gateway community; the small and pretty city of
Hilo, about a half-hour drive away; or Pahoa, in the Puna Region,
which is a good option for more adventurous travelers, especially if
the flow is still meeting the ocean at Kalapana. But even if you can’t
dedicate so much time, don’t stay away. You can see a lot of the
park in one day if that’s all the time you have.
 No matter how long you have to visit, do yourself a favor and plan
on staying until after dark at least one evening. That’s when, if
you’re lucky, you’ll be able to witness nothing less than the miracle
of creation as erupting Kilauea volcano spews red-hot, glowing
lava. If you stay for after-dark viewing, bring a heavy-duty night
lantern, because a standard flashlight tends not to be enough for
navigating the walk across the lava fields. (Any hotel or B&B worth
its salt lends its guests a good flashlight, but you may want to call
ahead or ask via e-mail to be sure.) And be prepared to walk; at my
visit before last (in 2006), the lava flow was about 11⁄2 miles from the
end of the road, but you were allowed to hike out to it if you were
appropriately prepared. You might also consider bringing night-
vision binoculars, if you have them.
 If you’re staying on the west (Kona-Kohala) coast and you can only
see the park on a day trip, you might consider visiting with a guide-
led nature tour, such as the one offered by Hawaii Forest & Trail,
or the park hike that Hawaiian Walkways offers in order to maxi-
mize your volcano experience. Otherwise, without a knowledgeable
guide at hand to show you the highlights and explain what you’re
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
388

seeing, you may find that you’re unable to get a real handle on the
park in just a day. Trust me — an expert guide is well worth the
dough you’ll spend. Or, if you only want to catch a glimpse of the
volcano from your perch on the Kona-Kohala coast, consider taking
a helicopter tour that flies over the volcano. See the sections
“Enjoying guided nature tours” and “Getting a bird’s-eye view —
flightseeing tours,” earlier in this chapter.
 The most adventurous among you may want to rent a four-wheel-
drive SUV when you book your rental car on the Big Island, because
a few areas of the park are accessible only by four-wheel-drive. If
you don’t, however, don’t sweat it — I never have, and I’ve seen
more of the park than most visitors. You won’t feel limited.
 I just can’t say it strongly enough: I’ve seen way too many visitors
running around the park soaking wet or freezing their buns off in
shorts and T-shirts. Remember: It’s always colder here than it is at
the beach, so dress accordingly. If you’re coming from the Kona
side of the island in summer, expect it to be at least 10 to 20 degrees
cooler at the volcano than it is there; bring a sweater or a light jacket
and long pants. It’s probably even slightly cooler than it is in Hilo
thanks to a higher elevation (4,000 ft.), so anticipate a drop. In the
cooler seasons, wear layers, and be prepared for temperatures to be
in the 40s or 50s. Always have rain gear on hand, especially in winter.
Sturdy closed-toe shoes are a good idea year-round, and a necessity
if you’re going to walk on the lava flow, because sneakers sometimes
melt on the lava.
 No matter what the weather forecast may be, always bring a hat,
sunglasses, and sunscreen. Take it from me, someone who came
away with quite a sunburn on a day that started with a downpour:
The weather can change at any time. Bring drinking water too,
because it isn’t readily available in most areas of the park.
 Pregnant visitors may want to skip the national park altogether,
because it’s not a good idea to expose yourself or your baby to the
sulfuric fumes that are ever-present. Those with heart or breathing
problems may also want to stay away, although my asthmatic hus-
band has never had a problem in five visits. Otherwise, the park is
perfectly safe for visitors. Some people claim that long-term expo-
sure to vog, the smoglike haze caused by the gases released when
molten lava pours into the ocean, can cause bronchial ailments, but
sulfuric fumes are generally far less dangerous than urban indus-
trial fumes. However, in recent months, vog has proved to be quite
an issue around the island thanks to the recent volcanic activity. In
fact, in May 2008, South Kona was oppressed by terrible vog, caus-
ing scratchy throats and persistent coughs, while Volcano was
clear as a bell. It all depends on the winds. If you have any issues
that may cause you to worry, I suggest that you check current con-
ditions with your accommodations host.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 389

 Lastly, based on current conditions, many areas of the park were
closed due to the high level of volcanic activity in mid-2008.
Therefore, if you’re planning an extended visit to the park, call
ahead to check current park status. However, keep in mind that the
situation can change on a dime, so don’t be disappointed if tomor-
row’s situation isn’t the same as it was when you called yesterday.
Getting your bearings after you arrive
Make your first stop the Kilauea Visitor Center, just beyond the park
entrance, open daily from 7:45 a.m. to 5 p.m. Here you can get up-to-the-
minute reports on the eruption and good viewing points, check out
exhibits that show you how volcanoes work and introduce you to the
plants and animals of the park, watch a 20-minute film on eruptions
(shown hourly), and review a schedule of the day’s activities (posted on
the bulletin board). While you’re there, impress the rangers with your
knowledge of Hawaii’s volcano vocabulary:
 The smooth, ropy lava that looks like swirls of chocolate frosting is
called pahoehoe (pa-ho-ay-ho-ay). It results from a fast-moving flow
that curls as it flows.
 The rough, chunky lava that looks like a chopped-up parking lot is
called aa (ah-ah). It’s caused by lava that moves slowly, pulling
apart as it overruns itself.
Check the bulletin board in the visitor center. Each day at 9 a.m., the
staff posts a schedule of activities — perhaps a ranger presentation or
an easy, guided walk to the summit. The offerings change daily, but
always give visitors the chance to learn from the rangers; they’re an
excellent resource. If the day’s activity doesn’t suit you, ask the rangers
to help you plan your explorations. They’re expert at matching you with
the trails and activities that are best suited to your fitness level and time
constraints.
Be sure to use the restroom before heading into the depths of the park,
because facilities are not readily available in the wild.
Exploring the park
For the best park overview, follow 11-mile Crater Rim Drive, which
loops around the perimeter of Kilauea Crater and serves as the park’s
main road. As it passes through rain forest and lava desert, it takes you
past all of the park’s well-marked scenic spots and points of interest.
The drive takes about an hour if you don’t make any stops, but what’s
the point in that? Assuming that the drive is open for its full length,
allow at least three hours, plus hiking time.
Before you even get in your car at the visitor center to make the drive,
walk across the street and through the Volcano House for a railside
panoramic view of the Kilauea Caldera and its vast, black steaming
floor. Before you enter the building, look to your right for the marked
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
390

steam vents, which illustrate the underground action with a cloud of
warm, wet air escaping from the earth. (Notice how all the rain-forest
ferns have gravitated to the moisture.)
I recommend following the Crater Rim Drive counterclockwise (west)
from the visitor center about 3 miles so that you can stop at the Thomas
A. Jaggar Museum (open daily 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.), early in your drive.
This little museum is well worth a half-hour of your time for the insight it
offers into the park’s geologic complexities, island evolution, and vol-
cano observing; there’s even a great telling of the Pele legend in murals.
(Jaggar was a scientist and volcano observer who arrived to head the
observatory in 1912; he was instrumental in both making the Big Island’s
volcanoes the most closely watched volcanoes in the world and petition-
ing to establish the area as a national park, a status it achieved in 1916.)
The museum overlooks Halemaumau (ha-lay-mow-mow) Crater, which
is the legendary home of Hawaii’s tempestuous goddess of volcanoes,
Pele, and is steaming mightily at this writing.
Natural highlights along the Crater Rim Drive include the Steam Vents
along the Steaming Bluff, where clouds of warmth rise from vents in the
active earth. At Halemaumau (ha-lay-mow-mow) Overlook, walk to the
crater’s edge and take in an alternate view of the steaming crater. Across
the road is Keanakakoi Crater, whose short trail leads to colorful erup-
tion fissures — very cool! — and the backside of the Halemaumau
Crater. As you drive the road, you’ll see that the flows are dated (1959,
1974, 1982), which really brings home the reality of volcanic destruction.
You’ll also pass numerous scenic overlooks and trail heads, and I highly
recommend that you hit the trail at least once during your visit; the fol-
lowing are some highlights to seek out.
The Thurston Lava Tube is the coolest spot in the park. This short 
(1⁄3-mile), easy, well-maintained loop trail leads you into a small rain-
foresty crater, luxuriant with giant ferns and native birds, and to a cave
in the lava flow that hot lava once ran through. (Similar tubes are cur-
rently carrying hot lava underground closer to the current rift.) It’s all
drippy and cool, with naked roots hanging down. You can hike through
the short tube and exit out the other side (bring your flashlight if you
have one).
My absolute favorite is the Kilauea Iki Trail, a 4-mile, two-hour moder-
ate-to-challenging hike that starts across the road from the Thurston
Lava Tube and descends about 400 feet to and across the floor of the
Kilauea Iki Crater, which last erupted in 1959. Crossing the black, steam-
ing crater floor is a wild, otherworldly, magnificent trip and offers the
park’s best opportunity to put yourself in the heart of the matter. Be pre-
pared for the hike with good walking shoes, sunscreen, a hat, and plenty
of water; remember, conditions can change quickly, so raingear is a good
idea even if the sun is high in the sky at the start of the hike.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 391

Another result of Kilauea Iki’s 1959 eruption is Devastation Trail. This
brief and easy half-mile walk with the ominous name shows you what a
volcanic eruption can do to a flourishing rain forest. The petrified land-
scape is quite astounding — it looks like a tree graveyard. Anybody can
manage this walk; the trail head is on Crater Rim Drive at Puu Puai
Overlook.
If you’d like a respite from all the devastation, follow the Kipuka Puaulu
(Bird Park) Trail, an easy 1-mile loop that takes you through a thriving
forest of native trees. The trail head is off Highway 11 to the northeast 
of the main park area, on the Mauna Loa Road. (The park map makes it
easy to find.)
Both the Devastation and Kipuka Puaulu trails are excellent walks to
take between 4 and 5 p.m., because that’s when the park’s resident
pheasants emerge from their daytime nests to poke around and see
what’s going on.
The park has enough fascinating hiking trails to keep you busy and inter-
ested for days on end. Your best bet is, again, to start your day at the
Kilauea Visitor Center, where you can learn about guided walks and 
day-hike options. Remember to always check conditions with the park
rangers before you set out on any hike. If you’re interested in getting a
preview of accessible trails, visit www.hawaii.volcanoes.national-
park.com and click “Hiking Guide.”
After you circle back around to the Kilauea Visitor Center, stop in next
door at the Volcano Art Center (www.volcanoartcenter.org), which
serves as one of the top showcases for island artists. Don’t miss it if
you’re interested in local arts and crafts — from native-wood jewelry
boxes to handcrafted jewelry to first-rate paintings and photographs —
because the works you’ll find here are first-rate.
More attractions worth seeking out
The Big Island certainly has an activity or interest for just about every-
one. In this section, I’ve rounded up some off-the-beaten-path attractions
that are worth a visit.
Along the Kona-Kohala coast
In addition to these sights, you may want to head upcountry from Kailua-
Kona town on Hualalai Road to the charmingly funky gallery-lined town of
Holualoa, which offers a nice peek at Kona’s world-famous coffee-growing
country. See the section “Shopping the local stores,” later in this chapter,
for further details on what you’ll find there.
Hulihee Palace
These days, the ancient port town of Kailua-Kona, lined with waterfront
restaurants and touristy shops, is more like a modern mall than anything
else. But if you have an interest in Hawaii’s history, you may want to take

15 minutes or so to explore Hulihee Palace. Built in 1838, this beautifully
restored two-story New England–style mansion of lava rock and coral
mortar served as the vacation home of Hawaii’s royalty. It features gleam-
ing koa antiques as well as ancient artifacts collected by the Daughters of
Hawaii. There’s a cute gift shop too.
At press time, Hulihee Palace was undergoing extensive renovation to
repair damage from the October 2006 earthquake that the Big Island expe-
rienced. Call the number listed below or Daughters of Hawaii at 
% 808-595-6291 to learn if the palace has been reopened, as well as for
any updated visitor information.

After you’re done exploring the palace — or even if you just view it from
the streetside — head across the street to handsome Mokuaikaua Church,
75–5713 Alii Dr. (% 808-329-0655; www.mokuaikaua.org), the first
Christian church in Hawaii, now housing a Congregational church. The 112-
foot steeple is still the tallest structure in Kailua-Kona. Sunday services
are offered at 8 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., and services last about an hour; child

Kalahuipuaa Fishponds
Scientists still marvel at the ancient Hawaiians’ sophisticated aquaculture
system, which used brackish shoreline ponds to stock, cultivate, and har-
vest fish for eating. This picturesque set of seven adjacent 2,000-year-old
ponds are of two types: The closed ponds, inshore and closed off from the
ocean, were used to raise mullet, milkfish, and shrimp; and ponds that
open to the sea have rock-wall barriers and sluice gates that connect them
directly to the ocean.
These beautifully preserved oceanfront ponds are a stellar example of the
ancient way of life — not to mention a gorgeous place to enjoy a stroll. A
palm-lined lava-rock path winds its way around the ponds; the entire walk
is an easy 21⁄2-mile loop, dotted with wooden benches that let you take fre-
quent breaks and enjoy the vistas (or watch the flying mullets, which love
to leap into the air). Next door is the restaurant at the Mauna Lani Beach
Club, where you can enjoy a refreshing beverage after your walk.
See map p. 368. In the Mauna Lani Resort, 23 miles north of Kona Airport. % 808-
885-6622 for Mauna Lani Resort. To get there: Take Queen Kaahumanu Highway
(Highway 19) to the Mauna Lani turnoff; ask the gate attendant to point you to the
fishponds. If you’re staying at the resort, the free shuttle can take you there.
Kona Historical Society Museum
This well-organized pocket museum is housed in the historic Greenwell
Store, built in 1875 by Henry Nicholas Greenwell out of native stone, with
lime mortar made from burned coral. Antiques, artifacts, and photos tell
the story of the fabled Kona Coast in the heyday of coffee growing and
cattle raising. Serious history buffs should call ahead to inquire about join-
ing one of the museum’s first-rate walking or jeep tours, or their living his-
tory or other educational programs.
See map p. 368. On Highway 11, 1⁄4 mile south of Kealakekua town (between mile
markers 111 and 112). % 808-323-3222. www.konahistorical.org. Admission:
$7adults, $3 children 5–12, free for kids under 5. Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–3 p.m.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
394

Puako Petroglyph Archaeological District
Petroglyphs, lava-rock carvings that tell the story of the precontact past
(much like the paintings inside the great pyramids of Egypt), serve as a fas-
cinating window to Hawaii’s ancient history. These pictures of daily life —
dancers and paddlers, families and chiefs, poi pounders and canoes —
appear throughout the islands, but most of them are found on the Big Island.
The largest concentration is here, at this 233-acre site just north of the
Mauna Lani resort. The easy 3⁄4-mile (one-way) dirt Malama Trail leads you
through a mesquite forest to rock art that’s graphic and easy to see. The
symbols date from A.D. 800 to 1400; carvers used the blue rocks you see
along the path to carve into the harder lava-rock fields. They are very simple
figures, and tend to be self-explanatory in nature. The most compelling art-
work is at the far (right) end of the petroglyph field, where the carvings over-
lap; this area is said to have excess mana, or supernatural power, which
made it a prime canvas. The grave of a young woman, buried with her tea
set, is also said to be located at this end of the field. Early morning or late
afternoon is best for petroglyph viewing. The petroglyphs are thousands of
years old and can be easily destroyed, so don’t walk on them (shoes can act
as an eraser) or attempt to take a rubbing; stick to photos, please.
See map p. 368. Trail head begins at the Holoholokai Beach Park access parking lot,
Mauna Lani resort, 23 miles north of Kona Airport. % 808-885-6622. To get there:
Take Queen Kaahumanu Highway (Highway 19) to the Mauna Lani turnoff and drive
toward the coast on North Kaniku Drive, which ends at a parking lot; the trail head
is marked by a sign and interpretive kiosk.
Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park
If you visit only one historic site while you’re in Hawaii, make it this one.
No other site better illustrates what ancient life in the islands was like —
and, boy, is this place cool.
With its fierce, haunting totemlike idols, this sacred site on the ocean 
looks mighty intimidating. To ancient Hawaiians, though, it was a welcome
sight — especially for defeated warriors and kapu (taboo) breakers,
because Puuhonua O Honaunau (poo-oo-ho-noo-ah oh ho-now-now) was a
designated sanctuary. A massive rock wall defines the refuge; as long as
the troubled Hawaiians made it inside the wall, they were absolved. In
addition to the sanctuary itself, this visually stunning ancient site on the
black-lava coast is also home to fascinating archaeological preservations
and reconstructions, including royal grounds that were home to the alii
(chiefs) of the Kona Coast in premodern times; an ancient temple re-cre-
ation; royal fishponds and burial sites (some pretty powerful chiefs called
this area home); and much more. Heck, the old rock wall alone is worth a
visit: Separating the royal compound from the puuhonua (sanctuary) and
standing 10 feet high and 17 feet thick in spots, it was built entirely with-
out mortar, by simply fitting stones together — a remarkable achievement
considering that it’s been standing since about 1550.
The historic site is tons of fun to explore. At the park entrance, you get a
self-guided tour map that leads you to 16 important sites. The trail takes
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 395

about an hour to follow and serves as a great window into precontact
Hawaiian culture — not only in such fierce life lessons as war and sanctu-
ary, but also in basic living, from fish-raising and -netting to the basic rules
of konane (ancient Hawaiian checkers). Wear shoes or sandals with good
traction, and you can crawl around on the ocean-facing lava flats — fun! I
highly recommend that you launch your visit, however, with a half-hour
ranger-led orientation talk, held in the amphitheater periodically through-
out the day. (Call for the current schedule.) Allow two to three hours for
your visit.
See map p. 368. At the end of Highway 160, Honaunau (about 22 miles south of Kailua-
Kona). To get there: Turn off Mamalahoa Highway (Highway 11) at Highway 160,
between mile markers 103 and 104, and proceed the 31⁄2 miles to the park entrance.
% 808-328-2288. www.nps.gov/puho. Admission: $5 per vehicle, $3 per walk-in
individual; admission good for 7 days. Open: Park Mon–Thurs 7 a.m.–8 p.m., Fri–Sun
6 a.m.–11 p.m.; visitor center daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Off the beaten path: North Kohala
If you look at a map of the Big Island, you see that a mountainous penin-
sula protrudes from the very top of the island. That’s North Kohala, the
last bastion of plantation life on the Big Island until not too long ago. If
you want to experience the old Hawaii vibe, this is the place to do it.
The hour-long drive along the Akoni Pule (ah-ko-nee poo-lay) Highway
(Highway 270) from Kawaihae (at the north end of the Kohala Coast,
where Highway 19 turns inland toward Waimea) to the end of the road at
the island’s north tip is one of my favorite drives in all Hawaii. It takes
you past gorgeous rolling ranchlands with remarkable ocean vistas and
through two charming old plantation towns, Hawi (ha-vee) and Kapaau
(ka-pa-ow), both of which have been transformed into small but reward-
ing shopper’s havens. (See the section “Shopping the local stores,” later
in this chapter, for details.)
As you drive through Kapaau, look to the mountain side of the road,
where you can’t miss the Original King Kamehameha Statue standing
guard outside the New England–style courthouse–turned–senior center
in the heart of town. This unspoiled territory was the birthplace of King
Kamehameha the Great, the great chief who united the Hawaiian Islands
as one kingdom back in 1810. This 8-foot, 6-inch bronze statue was cast
in Europe in 1880 and was lost at sea before being ultimately rescued
and erected here.
After you’re finished browsing Hawi and Kapaau, if it’s a nice day and
you’re enjoying your North Kohala drive, continue a few miles to the end
of Highway 270, where you’ll find the Pololu Valley Lookout, a gorgeous
scenic overlook that takes in a panoramic view of foaming waves and
sheer sea cliffs.
After all this sightseeing, you’re bound to be hungry, so don’t miss retro-
charming Bamboo, in Hawi, for lunch; see Chapter 14 for details.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
396

If you want to explore the verdant ranchlands of North Kohala the way
they were meant to be seen — from the saddle of a horse — contact
Paniolo Adventures (% 808-889-5354; www.panioloadventures.com),
which offers 11⁄2-, 21⁄2-, 3-, and 4-hour rides through 11,000 acres of still-
working cattle lands. This is a spirited ride, not a pokey nose-to-tail
trailer; even brave beginners often get up to a canter. Beginning, inter-
mediate, and advanced riders alike, ages 8 and up, will enjoy these trips.
Rides are $69 to $159 per person. (Be sure to ask about weight restric-
tions and minimum ages for kids. You’ll also need to wear long pants and
closed-toe shoes.) Custom-designed private rides (minimum two people)
are also available.
The interior: Waimea
Smack-dab in the middle of the north road between the west and east
sides of the island is Waimea, the heart and soul of Hawaii’s paniolo
(cowboy) country.
As you drive along Highway 19 east from the Kohala Coast to Waimea,
most of the rolling, grassy ranchland that you see is part of Parker
Ranch (www.parkerranch.com), Hawaii’s biggest ranch and one of the
largest cattle ranches in the entire United States (rather remarkable, if
you think about it).
If you’re interested in learning just how cattle roping came to find a
home in Hawaii, spend a half-hour at the Parker Ranch Visitor Center
and Museum, in the Parker Ranch Shopping Center at the junction of
highways 19 and 190 (% 877-885-7999 or 808-885-7655), which chroni-
cles the ranch’s history from 1847 until today, capturing the essence of
day-to-day life on the ranch along the way. The museum is open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (the last ticket is sold at 4 p.m.).
Admission is $8 (ask about discounted prices for kids 12 and under).
The Parker Ranch also has two historic home sites that you can tour:
Mana Hale and Puuopelu, both open Monday through Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (You must arrive by 4 p.m.) These beautifully restored
ranch homes (once the home of ranch founding father John Parker and
his Hawaiian princess bride) are filled with gorgeous furnishings (lots of
native koa in Mana Hale, European heirlooms at Puuopelu). To get there,
turn south at the Highway 19/190 junction in Waimea and go 3⁄4 mile to
the sign that says “Parker Ranch Historic Homes & Art Collection.”
Curators are available to show you around and fill you in on ranch his-
tory and gossipy lore. Admission is $9 per person; call % 877-885-7999
or 808-885-5433 for more information. Allow an hour or so for your visit.
You can save $1 per ticket by purchasing dual admission to the Parker
Ranch Visitor Center and Museum and the ranch’s historic home sites.
Just let the ticket agent know at purchase time.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 397

If you want to get out and see the ranch itself, a two-hour paniolo-led
Horseback Ride is offered twice daily at 8:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. The trail
ride passes through 19th-century stone corrals that still hold the ranch’s
Herefords on occasion, across vast rolling hills, and to the ranch’s rodeo
arena and thoroughbred racetrack. If you’re lucky, you may even get to
see working paniolo herding, cutting, holding, roping, throwing, brand-
ing, or sorting the cattle. These beginner-friendly rides are $79 per
person, and riders as young as 7 years old are accepted, making this a
great activity for the entire family. Be sure to book at least a few days in
advance by calling % 877-885-7999.
Riders who prefer horseless carriages can opt instead to explore the
rolling ranchlands via 4x4 fully automatic ATVs. Rides are offered daily
at 8:15 a.m. and 12:15 p.m. The cost is $95 per person, and you must be
at least 16 years old to participate. Call % 877-885-7999 or 808-885-7655
to book.
There’s even more to do on Parker Ranch than I have space to discuss
here. For a full list of events and activities, call % 877-885-7999 or go
online to www.parkerranch.com.
The Hamakua Coast
If you drive east from Waimea or north from Hilo (see the following list-
ing), you’ll reach more off-the-beaten-path territory: the mist-shrouded
Hamakua Coast, where you’ll find some wonderful natural attractions
and the one-horse town of Honokaa, which still boasts a weathered old-
plantation charm.
Akaka Falls
Tucked away in a misty, fragrant rain forest, this dramatic 422-footer is one
of Hawaii’s most scenic waterfalls. You can reach it via an easy mile-long
paved loop, which takes you past bamboo and flowering ginger and down
to an observation point, where you’ll have a perfect view. You’ll also see
nearby Kahuna Falls, which is a mere 100 feet tall. Be on the lookout for
rainbows.
See map p. 368. At the end of Akaka Falls Road (Highway 220), Honomu (8 miles north
of Hilo). To get there: From Highway 19, turn left at Honomu and head 31⁄2 miles inland.
Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden
This lush, Eden-like 40-acre valley makes a magical stop for horticultural
buffs, or anybody who wants to experience the extraordinary flora of the
Hawaiian Islands. The spectacular collection of more than 2,000 species
of tropical plants runs the gamut from delicate orchids to towering torch
ginger to 100-year-old mango, coconut, and banyan trees, all of which
thrive in the protected valley’s rich volcanic soil. Stay for an hour or come
to bask in the natural tranquillity of the garden all day.

19, Onomea Bay (81⁄2 miles north of Hilo; look for the blue “4-Mile Scenic Route” sign
on the ocean side of the highway). % 808-964-5233. www.htbg.com. Admission:
$15 adults, $5 kids 6–16, free for kids age 5 and under. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (last
admission is at 4 p.m.).
Waipio Valley
This gorgeous tropical valley at the end of the road on the Hamakua
Coast is very difficult to reach, which is precisely what makes it so spec-
tacular. From the black-sand bay at its mouth, remote Waipio sweeps
back 6 breathtaking miles, boasting intense emerald green taro patches
rustling in the wind between sheer cliffs reaching almost a mile high.
You don’t have to hike down into the remote valley to admire it. Just
take Highway 19 to Honokaa and then turn onto the Kukuihaele Highway
(Highway 240), which leads right to the Waipio Valley Lookout. This
grassy park on the edge of Waipio Valley’s sheer cliffs has splendid views

of the luxuriantly green valley below. Featuring some old redwood picnic
tables and rudimentary facilities, this is the ideal spot to unpack a picnic
while you take in the magnificent view.
The more ambitious among you can hike down the paved path into the
valley, or catch a ride with the Waipio Valley Shuttle (% 808-775-7121),
which offers a 90-minute narrated four-wheel-drive tour into the valley.
The shuttle runs Monday through Saturday at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and
3 p.m. Tickets are $55 for adults, $30 for kids under age 11. Reserve your
spot in advance.
While you’re here, drop in at Waipio Valley Artworks, in Kukuihaele
Village on Highway 240, 2 miles from the lookout (% 800-492-4746 or
808-775-0958; www.waipiovalleyartworks.com). You’ll find a good
selection of local art, Koa heirloom bowls, furniture, ceramics, and more.
You can also explore the valley aboard a mule-drawn wagon with Waipio
Valley Wagon Tours (% 808-775-9518; www.waipiovalleywagontours.
com). This touristy 11⁄2-hour tour is also fully narrated and departs from
the Last Chance Store. Tours are offered Monday through Saturday at
9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. Tickets are $55 for adults,
$25 for kids ages 4 to 12; free for children under 3.
If you want to explore the lush Waipio Valley on horseback, contact
Naalapa Stables (% 808-775-0419; www.naalapastables.com), which
offers 21⁄2-hour nose-to-tail trail rides Monday through Saturday at 9:30 a.m.
and 1 p.m. Tickets are $89 per person, and you must be at least 8 years
old and weigh less than 230 pounds. Tours leave from Waipio Valley
Artworks.
If you want to take one of the guided tours of the Waipio Valley, make
advance reservations to avoid disappointment; call a week in advance to
book a mule tour.
Don’t take your rental car down the steep road that leads into the
Waipio Valley; you won’t get back up the steeply graded hill. What’s
more, most rental-car contracts prohibit it, so if you do get stuck, you’ll
also end up with a hefty tow bill (not to mention a wasted day).
Hilo
I love this pretty bayfront city and its wonderfully nostalgic, if rustic,
atmosphere. Although Hilo is Hawaii’s second-largest city (after
Honolulu), it really feels like a sort of funky old plantation town. Some
people, especially those who come to Hawaii to get away from gray
skies, just don’t understand Hilo’s appeal. I’ve found that you have to 
be something of a retro-romantic to appreciate it.
Despite Hilo’s reputation for rain, you may want to spend a couple of
days here. Hilo is a good base from which to explore Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park, which is only a 45-minute drive away (see Chapter 14 for

hotel recommendations). Hilo also boasts some interesting shopping.
(See the section “Shopping the local stores,” later in this chapter).
But even if you just drive through on your way to the national park, take
a few minutes to cruise or stroll down Banyan Drive, the shady lane that
curves along the waterfront, offering fabulous Hilo Bay views. (A number
of the banyan trees along here were planted as saplings by such celebri-
ties as Amelia Earhart and Babe Ruth.) If it’s a clear day, take the short
walk across the concrete arch bridge in front of the Hawaii Naniloa Hotel
to Coconut Island, if only for a panoramic look at this pretty little city.
Also along Banyan Drive is Liluokalani Gardens, the largest formal
Japanese garden this side of Tokyo. This 30-acre park, named for
Hawaii’s last monarch, Queen Liluokalani, is postcard-pretty, complete
with bonsai, carp ponds, pagodas, and a moon gate bridge. It’s free and
open 24 hours, so stop by to spend a moment in old Japan.
The following are a handful of additional attractions you may want to
seek out while you’re in Hilo. If Hilo’s charms win you over — and they
just might — pick up a copy of the free Explore Hilo walking tour pam-
phlet, which is available all over town and the island. If, for some reason,
you don’t run across it, pick one up at the Big Island Visitors Bureau
office at 250 Keawe St., at Haili Street, across from Pescatore restaurant
(% 808-961-5797; www.bigisland.org).
If you find yourself intrigued by Hilo, contact the Downtown Hilo
Improvement Association, 329 Kamehameha Ave., Hilo (% 808-935-
8850; www.downtownhilo.com; office hours: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.),
which has a very informative Web site detailing the history of the town
and its attractions. You can also stop by its office for helpful informa-
tion, or to pick up a copy of its informative self-guided walking tour of 
18 historic sites.
Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii
This excellent hands-on museum is focused on telling the story of astron-
omy through the dual lenses of both science and Hawaiian culture. Visitors
get a new understanding of the mysteries of the night sky unraveled
through the world’s largest and most important collection of observato-
ries, situated above the clouds atop majestic Mauna Kea volcano. The
museum also unravels the mysteries of history, telling the story of the sky
as the roadmap to Hawaii for the ancient Polynesians — widely consid-
ered the world’s first astronomers — who sailed across the vast Pacific to
find these fair isles. The appealing museum offers hands-on exhibits for
everyone, ranging from a kid-friendly introduction to the Big Bang theory
to computer banks that allow you to interact with Mauna Kea’s telescopes.
(The museum treads lightly with cosmic origins stories, focusing more on
the “what” than the “how,” maintaining appropriate respect for a full range
of beliefs on this subject.) The highlight is the signature planetarium show,
“Maunakea: Between Earth and Sky,” which summarizes the story of the
museum in a half-hour show; I recommend starting your visit with the 
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
402

signature show, and follow by exploring the exhibits. There’s usually a
second “feature” planetarium show on offer that changes periodically; at
press time, it was a 3-D feature on the dawn of the space age. Allow two to
three hours for your visit, depending on your level of interest.
See map p. 368. At the University of Hawaii at Hilo, 600 Imiloa Place, Hilo. % 808-
969-9700. www.imiloahawaii.org. To get there: Follow Kanoelehua Avenue
(Highway 11) to Puainako Street (at Prince Kuhio Plaza); head west on Puainako
Street, go 13⁄4 miles and turn right on Komohana Street, turn right on Nowelo Street,
and turn left on Imiloa Place. Admission: $18 adults, $9.50 kids ages 4–12. Admission
includes 1 planetarium show (your choice); additional planetarium show $6 adults, $3
kids. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–4 p.m. Signature planetarium show at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.;
feature show at 1 and 3 p.m. Check the planetarium schedule for Fri night laser rock
shows, usually at 7:30 and 9 p.m.
Lyman Museum
Composed of two major exhibit halls and a historic missionary home, this
museum should be high on the priority list for culture and history buffs.
The first-rate Earth Heritage and Island Heritage galleries tell the islands’
native natural and cultural story; other permanent collections include
notable collections of Hawaiian and Chinese art. Next door is the fully
restored 1839 home of David and Sarah Lyman, a hybrid New England/
Hawaiian–style house — the oldest wooden house on the island — that
perfectly exemplifies missionary times, which transformed Hawaii per-
manently and served as the foundation for the unique East-meets-West
island culture that prevails today. No other site in Hawaii tells the story so
well. Excellent guided tours of the Lyman Mission House are offered at 11
a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. Your best bet is to arrive about an hour before your tour
time to tour the museum, then follow with the house tour.
See map p. 368. 276 Haili St. (at Kapiolani Street), Hilo. % 808-935-5021. www.lyman
museum.org. Admission: $10 adults, $8 seniors (60+), $3 kids ages 6–17. Family
package: $25 for 2 adults and 2 kids; also ask about AAA discounts; discount coupons
are often available in visitor brochures around town, including 2-for-1 admission
coupons. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Pacific Tsunami Museum
This compelling small museum and education center chronicles the
tsunamis (tidal waves) that devastated — and subsequently reshaped —
Hilo in 1946 and 1960. Exhibits that tell both scientific and personal stories
are on hand; some of the guides are even survivors, with their own tales to
tell. The museum — which can add depth and immediacy to your under-
standing of the massive tragedy that struck Southeast Asia in 2004 — is well
worth 45 minutes or an hour of your time.

Panaewa Rainforest Zoo & Gardens
This cute-as-a-button 12-acre rain-forest zoo — the only tropical rain-forest
zoo in the United States — is a good bet if you have little ones in tow. Some
50 species of birds, reptiles, and mammals are on hand, from Hawaiian
owls to Bengal tigers. The tigers are fed daily at 3:30 p.m., which is quite a
sight to behold. There’s also a petting zoo for the little ones every Saturday
from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m.
See map p. 368. On Stainback Highway (off Highway 11), Panaewa (just south of Hilo).

Rainbow Falls
This 80-footer isn’t quite as towering or dramatic as Akaka Falls (see the
section “The Hamakua Coast,” earlier in this chapter), but the sight of the
waterfall spilling into a pool surrounded by wild ginger is just lovely. Go in
the morning, around 9 or 10 a.m., to see Rainbow Falls at its best.
See map p. 368. On Waianuenue Avenue (Highway 200), Hilo. To get there: Follow
Bayfront Highway (Highway 19) to Waianuenue Avenue and turn inland; the falls are
on the right past the Kaumana Drive intersection.
Hitting the links
The Kohala Coast is home to the top golf courses on the Big Island, and
among them are some of the finest golf challenges in the world. This vast
island boasts far more golfing opportunities than I can list here; if you
want more options, either on this coast or elsewhere around the island,
contact the Big Island Visitors Bureau (% 808-886-1655 on the Kohala
Coast, or 808-961-5797 in Hilo; www.bigisland.org).
The Golf Hawaii Card (% 888-GOLF-918; www.hawaiigolfdeals.com)
costs $60 annually, but can pay for itself in just one or two visits to par-
ticipating courses. Eight courses on the Big Island alone offer signifi-
cantly lower rates for cardholders, including Hapuna, Mauna Kea, the
two Waikoloa courses, Big Island Country Club, and the two courses at
the Kona Country Club. Your Big Island card also scores you bonus use
at some Oahu and Maui courses. For discounted tee times, also check
out the deals available through Tee Times Hawaii.com (% 888-675-
GOLF; www.teetimeshawaii.com).
Probably the best golf course on the Big Island is the Hualalai Golf Course
at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai. Many duffers in the know consider it
the finest course in the state. Unfortunately, you have to be a resort guest
to play it, but for the committed, this Jack Nicklaus–designed champi-
onship course is reason enough to stay there; see Chapter 14 for a review.
Book your tee times well in advance, especially in high season.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
404

Big Island Country Club
The island’s newest course is this 6,114-yard Pete and Perry Dye design,
situated at 2,500 feet elevation above the Kohala Coast, offering welcome
relief from the perennially hot coastal weather. Seven water features come
into play along this popular, immaculately kept, dramatically situated, and
justifiably popular course. The mountain and ocean views are incredible.
An excellent bargain on a pricey golf coast.
See map p. 368. 71–1420 Mamalahoa Hwy. (Highway 190), near Waikoloa Road (at
mile marker 20). % 808-325-5044. Greens fees: $169, $109 after noon; $55 for seniors
Mon and Thurs. With Golf Hawaii Card, fees are $75.
Hapuna Golf Course
This 6,029-yard links-style championship course is widely considered one
of Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay’s finest courses. Boasting indigenous vege-
tation and a design that blends seamlessly with the surrounding land-
scape, it has been honored as Most Environmentally Sensitive Course by
Golf Magazine and Course of the Future by the U.S. Golf Association. The
course extends from the coastline to 700 feet above sea level, with pas-
toral mountain scenery to one side and sweeping ocean views on the
other. The elevation changes keep play challenging, as do the higher-
elevation winds and a series of daunting bunkers. Facilities include a prac-
tice green, driving range, pro shop, restaurant, and fitness center.
See map p. 368. Adjacent to the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel, 62–100 Kauanoa Dr. (off
Highway 19 near mile marker 69). % 808-882-5400. www.princeresortshawaii.
com. Greens fees: $165 ($125 for hotel guests). Twilight rate $145 available season-
ally for tee times after 1 p.m.
Mauna Kea Golf Course
This 6,365-yard Robert Trent Jones, Sr., grande dame has been around
since 1964, but it’s still at the top of its game — just ask the editors of
Hawaii magazine, who recently named it the second-best course in the
state (after the Kiele Course at Kauai Lagoons; see Chapter 17). Its com-
bination of breathtaking natural beauty, stunning oceanfront setting, and
championship-level challenge make it one of Trent Jones’s finest designs
anywhere, and one of the best courses in the state. Expect undulating
greens, more than 100 well-placed bunkers, and dramatic changes in ele-
vation. The signature hole is the 3rd, a par-3 shocker with 200 yards of
ocean standing between tee and green, which the legendary architect
called his favorite hole of all time. Facilities include practice green, driving
range, lockers and showers, pro shop, and restaurant.
At press time, the Mauna Kea golf course was in the midst of a major reno-
vation led by Rees Jones, the legendary course designer’s son. The renova-
tion is slated to be complete in December 2008 — and don’t be surprised if
it comes with higher greens fees.

for guests of the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel). Twilight rates available seasonally for tee
times after 1 p.m.
Mauna Lani Frances H. I’i Brown Courses
Carved out of rugged black lava flows, both of these 6,335-yard champi-
onship courses are real winners. You’ll really know that you’re playing Big
Island golf here; as a matter of fact, the dramatic oceanfront South Course
is so otherworldly that it looks like it might be set on the moon. Long home
to the Senior Skins Game, it’s one of Hawaii’s most difficult golf challenges
and boasts an unforgettable ocean hole, the 221-yard, par-3 7th. The
intense drama of the seasoned North Course is toned down by its rolling
greens and wealth of old-growth greenery, which gives it a Scottish feel;
don’t be surprised if you have to wait for feral goats to clear the fairways
before you take your shot. Facilities include two driving ranges, putting
green, pro shop with rentals, restaurant, and on-course refreshment carts;
pro-instructed golf clinics are available.
In the Mauna Lani resort, 68–150 Hoohana St. (off Highway 19). % 808-885-6655.
www.maunalani.com. Greens fees (for either course): $210 ($145 for resort
guests); twilight rates $90 (times vary).
Waikoloa Golf Club
You have two spectacular courses to choose from here: The beautiful,
sporty par-70, 5,958-yard Beach Course is dramatically set in the lava, and
it reflects designer Robert Trent Jones, Jr.’s, motto: “Hard par, easy bogey.”
Most golfers remember the par-5, 505-yard 12th hole, a sharp dogleg with
bunkers in the corner and an elevated tee surrounded by lava. Designed
by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish, the par-72, 7,074-yard Kings’ Course is
a links-style challenge — and a real shot maker’s course — with six major
lakes and about 75 bunkers that often come into play thanks to ever-pres-
ent trade winds. Facilities include golf shop, restaurant, practice facility,
and golf academy.
See map p. 368. In the Waikoloa Resort, 18 miles north of Kona Airport. % 877-924-
5656 or 808-886-7888. www.waikoloabeachresort.com. Greens fees: $195 ($130
for Waikoloa resort guests); $180 for 2-day access to both courses with Golf Hawaii
Card.
Waikoloa Village Golf Course
This semiprivate course on the slopes of Mauna Kea is a real gem, worth
seeking out for its beautiful views, great game, and relatively affordable
fees. Robert Trent Jones, Jr., designed this 5,490-yard challenge (with a par
72 for each of the three sets of tees) with his trademark sand traps, slick
greens, and great fairways. Facilities include pro shop, putting and chip-
ping greens, driving range, locker rooms with showers, restaurant, club
rentals, and private instruction.
See map p. 368. On Waikoloa Road, Waikoloa Village (off Highway 19, 28 miles north

fees: $80.
Relaxing at the spa
As you might expect from an island with so many fabulous resort hotels,
the Big Island boasts a wonderful collection of spas.
My favorite — perhaps my favorite in all of Hawaii — is the Mauna Lani
Spa, 68-1365 Pauoa Rd., in the Mauna Lani Resort (% 808-881-7922;
www.maunalani.com). Set almost entirely outside and within simple
thatched-roof hales, this glorious island-style retreat has bathed in acco-
lades: It was named number-one spa in Hawaii and number three in the
U.S. by readers of Conde Nast Traveler magazine in 2008, and Travel +
Leisure has called it one of the world’s best. Therapies run the gamut
from the expected menu of massages and facials to tranquil watsu in a
lava-rock, saltwater pool. If you’re a spa fan, don’t miss it.
Another great choice on the Kohala Coast is the Spa Without Walls at
the Fairmont Orchid Hawaii, 1 N. Kaniku Dr., in the Mauna Lani resort
(% 808-887-7540; www.fairmont.com/orchid). For the ultimate in
relaxation, consider the outdoor Awa Earth and Fire treatment, which
starts with a Hawaiian-style lomilomi massage with warm coconut oil,
followed by a relaxing treatment during which Hawaiian medicinal herbs
are compressed into your skin with a warm lava stone to rub any
remaining mainland tension away.
Should you find yourself in Volcano and in need of a pampering treat-
ment, seek out Hale Hoola, 11-3913 7th St., Volcano Village (% 808-756-
2421; www.halehoola.net). The lomilomi massage is to die for, and the
prices are reasonable.
Shopping the local stores
For such a rural island, the Big Island has a shockingly good shopping
scene. Big Island–based artists and artisans generate some of the best
art and crafts in Hawaii, from traditional lauhala weaving (rare to find) to
gorgeous koa-wood gifts. But you do need to venture past Kailua-Kona to
find it.
Kailua-Kona and South Kona
Kailua-Kona is a carnival of T-shirts, tacky trinkets, and silly souvenirs,
with a little beachwear and a few quality gift items thrown into the mix
for good measure. Alii Drive is the heart of the action; all you need to do
is start at one end and browse. The best of what’s on offer can be found
at the Kona Inn Shopping Village, in the heart of town on the ocean side
of the road, where one standout among the 50-plus shops is the Honolua
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 407

Surf Co. (% 808-329-1001; www.honoluasurf.com), which has my
favorite surf wear in the islands.
Hilo Hattie, Hawaii’s biggest name in aloha wear, has an outpost in Kailua-
Kona at 75-5597A Palani Rd. (at Kuakini Highway, next to Burger King; 
% 808-329-7200; www.hilohattie.com). Hilo Hattie is geared to the
tourist market, carrying inexpensive, colorful wear that has improved in
quality and style in recent years, plus a wide selection of souvenirs like
macadamia nuts and Hawaii-grown coffees.
Upcountry Kona: Holualoa
One of my favorite places to shop in all Hawaii is the artsy, funky
Upcountry village of Holualoa, sitting 1,400 feet above Kailua-Kona on
the slopes of Hualalai mountain. To get there, head south from Palani
Road on Highway 11; turn up the mountain at the clearly marked
Hualalai Road turnoff. The curving 3-mile drive up the mountain takes
about ten minutes; after you reach the top, turn left on Mamalahoa
Highway, the coffee country town’s gallery-lined main street.
The first shop you’ll reach, even before you make the turn onto
Mamalahoa Highway, is Kimura’s Lauhala Shop (% 808-324-0053),
where the dying Hawaiian art of lauhala weaving still thrives, thanks 
to Kimura’s group of weavers. Look carefully, however, to separate the
island-made crafts from the increasing number of Polynesian imports.
Farther along Mamalahoa Highway, the highlights include the Holualoa
Gallery (% 808-322-8484; www.lovein.com/holualoagalleryblue.
htm), which showcases original works by a bevy of local fine painters,
sculptors, photographers, and jewelers. The Studio 7 Gallery (% 808-
324-1335), a wonderful multiroomed Japanese-style gallery, showcases
prints, sculpture, multimedia art, jewelry, and gorgeous pottery and
crafts, all with the signature Asian simplicity of artist Hiroki Morinoue.
My favorite gallery in a sea of terrific ones is Dovetail Gallery and Design
(% 808-322-4046), a gorgeous plantation-style building housing a well-
curated collection of the island’s most exceptional crafts, from hand-
turned bowls of rare island woods and hand-painted silks to jewelry,
woodcuts, and more. Nearby is the Holualoa Ukulele Gallery (% 808-
324-4100; www.konaweb.com/ukegallery). Another notable stop, the
Shelly Maudsley White Gallery (% 808-322-5220; www.shellymaudsley
white.com), focuses on the bold tropical-themed works of a local artist,
and the Ipu Hale Gallery (% 808-322-9069) has virtually single-handedly
resurrected the traditional art of gourd carving — a must for fans of
indigenous art forms.
If all this top-quality shopping makes you hungry, stop into the Holuakoa
Café (% 808-322-2233) for well-prepared sandwiches, salads, tropical
smoothies, and 100 percent Kona joe.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
408

Kohala Coast
Probably the finest one-stop shopping on the island is the Waikoloa
Kings’ Shops (www.waikoloabeachresort.com) an open-air shopping
complex at 250 Waikoloa Beach Dr. in the Waikoloa Resort. Highlights
include Blue Ginger (% 808-886-2020; www.blueginger.com), for com-
fortable and stylish island-style batik wear for women and kids; Kubuku
(% 808-886-8581), for the islands’ best selection of gorgeous, creative
pareu (also known as sarongs), many of them custom made for the shop;
and Walking in Paradise (% 808-886-2600), for shoes that emphasize
both style and comfort. You’ll also find such familiar names as Coach,
Louis Vuitton, and Tommy Bahama.
Waikoloa now has a second shopping complex just across the street
called the Waikoloa Queens’ MarketPlace, but I’m generally disap-
pointed with the quality of the shops there.
Giving the Kings’ Shops a serious run for its money are the Mauna 
Lani Shops at the Mauna Lani resort (www.shopsatmaunalani.com).
Highlights include Jourabchi (% 808-885-0040), home to gorgeous
women’s island-style evening wear (and an excellent collection of
evening bags) and some of the finest quality men’s aloha wear on the
market. There’s also Tori Richard by Quiet Storm (% 808-885-4978) for
Tori Richard’s own understated, upscale aloha wear for men and women;
I particularly like the men’s line. Also check out Oasis Lifestyle (% 808-
885-8795), specializing in relaxed women’s fashions (perfect for the
island lifestyle) as well as a creative mix of homewares and jewelry, all
attractively displayed. The bigger names are more limited here, but you
will find Mauna Lani’s own Tommy Bahama Emporium, this one featur-
ing one of their winning cafes.
North Kohala
If you’re interested in high-quality Hawaiian crafts, especially those
made of gorgeous island woods — of which native koa wood is the most
highly prized — head up the Akoni Pule Highway (Highway 270) to the
North Kohala towns of Hawi (ha-vee) and Kapaau (ka-pa-ow). Both
towns are worth browsing, and all the stops are right along the highway.
As you shop around the islands, you’ll see gorgeous koa-wood boxes,
vessels, furniture, and accessories in finer galleries. Prices are high (a
small keepsake box can easily run more than $100) thanks to a quickly
diminishing supply of the wood. The Big Island has the finest koa crafts-
men, because it’s home to the largest existing stand of koa.
If you don’t mind shelling out big bucks for heirloom-quality crafts
carved from koa and other woods, visit the Ackerman Gallery in
Kapaau (% 808-889-5971; www.ackermangalleries.com). Boasting the
best selection of woodcrafts in the islands, as well as Gary Ackerman’s
own Impressionist-style paintings, it’s worth a look even if you can’t buy.
The second location, a little farther up the street across from the King
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 409

Kamehameha Statue, is a lovely gift gallery with more affordable wood
crafts, plus home accessories and jewelry. (I bought a string of Hawaii-
strung Japanese black pearls on my last visit.)
Another excellent stop in Kapaau is the Kohala Book Shop, 54–3885
Akoni Pule Hwy. (% 808-889-6400; www.kohalabooks.com), Hawaii’s
largest used bookstore and one of the most browsable bookshops in 
the islands, featuring everything from rare out-of-print editions to new
books by Hawaii authors to gently used beach reads.
Waimea
Waimea has a bit of offbeat shopping that’s worth seeking out. I really
like Antiques By . . ., housed in a white clapboard cottage at 65-1275
Kawaihae Rd. (% 808-887-6466). There is a wealth of Hawaii-themed
treasures to be found. Prices tend to be high, but negotiable.
I’m also intrigued by Hooked Gallery, across the street at 65-1298
Kawaihae Rd. (% 808-987-0072; www.hookedgallery.com), which spe-
cializes in jewelry and art. I’m not much taken by the art collection, but
the selection of New Zealand jade jewelry, Niihau shell leis, and vintage
pieces is quite remarkable. Be sure to negotiate.
I also like the Gallery of Great Things at Parker Square, 65-1279 Kawaihae
Rd. (% 808-885-7706; www.galleryofgreatthingshawaii.com), a
warm and friendly gallery chock-full of Hawaiian, Polynesian, and Asian
treasures, from primitive to contemporary.
Also make a stop at Dan De Luz’s Woods, 64–1013 Mamalahoa Hwy.,
down the road from Parker Center and next to the Lex Brodie tire dealer-
ship (% 808-885-5856; www.deluzwoods.com). Dan is a master crafts-
man who turns some of the finest koa and Norfolk pine bowls in the
business; masterworks by other artisans are also shown in the unpreten-
tious showroom.
Hilo
Boasting an appealing mix of fine and funky shops, this charming city is
a wonderful place to browse. Shopping is centered in the wooden store-
fronts along oceanfront Kamehameha Avenue, on Keawe Avenue 1 paral-
lel block inland, and on the side streets in between. Note that many of
Hilo’s shops are closed on Sunday, so plan accordingly.
If you want to come home with just one article of aloha wear, buy it at
Sig Zane, 122 Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-935-7077; www.sigzane.com),
whose distinctive, two-color, all-cotton aloha wear is the height of simple
style and good taste. The stunningly beautiful fabrics are sold in a vari-
ety of clean-lined, easy-to-wear styles, and even off the bolt if you want
to take some home. I can’t recommend this marvelous shop enough. The
leather goods are gorgeous, too.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
410

Aloha-wear queen Hilo Hattie has a second Big Island outpost at Prince
Kuhio Plaza, 111 E. Puainako St., at Highway 11 in Hilo (% 808-961-3077;
www.hilohattie.com) — but if you’re going to buy aloha wear while
you’re in Hilo, I recommend Sig Zane.
Basically Books, 160 Kamehameha Ave. (% 800-903-MAPS or 808-
961-0144; www.basicallybooks.com), is your stop for all kinds of
Hawaii books and maps. Other Hilo favorites include Hanahou, 164
Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-935-4555), for an eye-catching collection of
Hawaii-style gifts, both vintage and new, precious and affordable; The
Grove Gallery, 302 Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-961-4420; www.the
grovegallery.com), for a clever collection of island art and crafts;
Dreams of Paradise Gallery, 308 Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-935-5670;
www.dreamsofparadisegallery.com), for a good selection of island-
made art; Koehnen’s Interiors, 76 Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-961-4725;
www.koehnens.com), for gorgeous island-style furnishings, which can be
shipped back to the mainland; Burgado’s Fine Woods, in the S. Hata
Building at 308 Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-969-9663), for koa-wood
crafts and gifts, both affordable and pricey; and Dragon Mama, 266
Kamehameha Ave. (% 808-934-9081; www.dragonmama.com), for Asian
home wares and textiles, from tatami mats to buckwheat pillows to
antique kimonos and much more, all gorgeous.
In the Volcano area
On Highway 11, the road from Hilo to Volcano, you’ll find another out-
post of Dan De Luz’s Woods just past mile marker 12 in the town of
Mountain View (take the first right past the mile marker; % 808-935-
5587; www.deluzwoods.com), where the master bowl turner creates 
gorgeous works in koa, sandalwood, mango, and other island woods.
While you’re at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, take a few minutes to
stop into the Volcano Art Center Gallery, next to the Kilauea Visitor
Center (% 808-967-7565; www.volcanoartcenter.org), a marvelous
showcase for some of the island’s best artists and craftspeople, and a
real delight to browse.
Also seek out Volcano Garden Arts, 19-3834 Old Volcano Rd., Volcano
Village (% 808-985-8979; www.volcanogardenarts.com). This utterly
charming farmhouse-turned-gallery is the domain of multimedia artist
Ira Ono, and features both his attractive works and those of the artists
and artisans from throughout Hawaii and the Pacific, with a few treas-
ures from Southeast Asia in the mix. Many of the pieces are quite afford-
able. The garden is reason enough alone to visit.
Living It Up after Dark
This marvelous island has a wealth of stuff to see and do — more than
you can take in during the course of a single vacation — but it all tends
to come to a screeching halt at sunset.
Chapter 15: Exploring the Big Island 411

Your best source for finding out what’s going on around town, especially if
you’re interested in live music, is the free weekly Hawaii Island Journal.
If you’re staying on the west side of the island, make sunset the highlight
of your evening with a leisurely dinner at an oceanfront restaurant. The
waterfront restaurants in Kailua-Kona all make great sunset perches, as
do the Kohala Coast resorts, which offer beachfront spots for sunset
cocktails and dinner. See Chapter 14 for recommendations. Huggo’s is a
great place to maximize in-town sunset fun, while Don’s Mai Tai Bar at
Don the Beachcomber serves up the perfect mai tai in a glorious ocean-
side setting. You’ll find that all of Kailua-Kona town boasts a party-hearty
atmosphere in the evenings.
On the Kohala Coast, the Hilton Waikoloa Beach’s Malolo Lounge
(% 808-886-1234; www.hiltonwaikoloavillage.com) is a wonderful
setting, designed to evoke the classic steamships of the 1920s. Drop in
for sunset cocktails or live jazz nightly, from 9 p.m. to midnight.
In South Kona, drop by the Keauhou Shopping Center (www.keauhou-
resort.com), which is home to a multiplex movie theater. You’ll also find
Drysdale’s Two (% 808-322-0070), a casual bar and grill that’s popular
with the locals. If there’s a big game being played on the mainland, you
can catch it here on the giant screens — would you expect anything less
from a place named after Dodger great Don Drysdale? Also consider the
oceanside Crystal Blue bar at the Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort and
Spa, 78-128 Ehukai St. (% 808-930-4900; www.sheratonkeauhou.com),
which overlooks an area of ocean where manta rays love to congregate
after dark, making this a great place for cocktails and pupus.
A top sunset draw on the Kona Coast is Captain Beans’ Polynesian
Cruises (% 800-831-5541 or 808-329-2955; www.robertshawaii.com/
big-island/capt-beans-dinner-cruise.php). This two-hour sunset
cruise sails from Kailua Pier nightly and features dinner, dancing, and 
a full-scale Polynesian revue aboard a 150-foot catamaran. It’s really
cheesy, but lots of fun nonetheless. Tickets are $56 to $64 for adults
($32–$40 for kids 4–11) and include your meal, cocktails, the show, and
transportation to and from most hotels and condos on the Kona-Kohala
coast.
You can save 10 percent by booking your Captain Beans cruise online.
Substantially less touristy are the sunset cruises that Red Sail Sports
(% 877-RED-SAIL or 808-886-2876; www.redsailhawaii.com) operates
aboard its 50-foot catamaran, the Noa Noa, from Anaehoomalu Bay at
the Waikoloa resort on the Kohala Coast. The two-hour sail costs $84 for
adults, $51 for kids 3 to 12, including appetizers and a full bar. An extra
plus: You’re likely to spot humpback whales in the winter whale-watch-
ing season. A Dinner Sail Cruise leaves at the same time and is a few
more dollars.
Part V: Hawaii, the Big Island 
412

If you’re looking for entertainment that’s more culturally enriching, see
what’s on at the Kahilu Theatre, just a half-hour’s drive from the Kohala
Coast resorts on Highway 19 in Waimea (% 808-885-6868; www.kahilu
theatre.org), the island’s home for theater, dance, live music, and the
performing arts. Entertainment can range from local music masters the
Brothers Cazimero (who are well worth catching) to the Dirty Dozen
Brass Band to the Kronos Quartet to the Beijing Modern Dance Company.
There’s also an artsy movie theater attached.
Of course, for the most animated after-dark entertainment, head to —
you guessed it — a luau! The Big Island has an excellent Friday-night
option; check out Chapter 14 for more information.
If the volcano is acting up and you’re staying on the east side of the
island, it’s the best show in town. Nighttime is the right time to see the
lava pumping — so get yourself to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and
ask the rangers where’s the best place for lava watching. See the com-
plete park section earlier in this chapter for details.

Kauai

In this part . . .
W
ith its lush, tranquil landscapes, sleepy, seductive
Kauai is simply one of the most beautiful places on

auai is an easygoing, and easily manageable, island. You’ll need a
rental car to get around, so plan on booking one before you arrive
(see Chapter 6). No matter where you’re coming from, you’ll arrive at
Kauai’s Lihue (li-hoo-ay) Airport.
Arriving at Lihue Airport
Lihue Airport (% 808-246-1448; www.hawaii.gov/dot/airports/
kauai/lih) sits on Kauai’s eastern shore just north of Lihue town, at
the end of Ahukini Road (east of Kuhio Highway). Interisland service is
provided by Hawaiian Airlines and go! Airlines. In addition, some
transpacific carriers offer direct service to Kauai, including Alaska
Airlines, American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines, and
US Airways.
Open-air Lihue Airport is very small and easy to negotiate. The major
rental-car companies have service counters directly across the street
from the terminal (in the wooden hut), but you’ll take a shuttle van off-
site to actually pick up your car. All the rental-car agencies offer map
booklets that are invaluable for getting around the island.
Car-rental lots for National, Alamo, and Thrifty are located significantly
off-site from the airport in a poorly signed area that can make returning
your rental a challenge. If there is no price repercussion, I suggest book-
ing with another firm.

Chapter 16: Settling into Kauai 419

Getting from the Airport to Your Hotel
If you’re heading to the Coconut Coast or the North Shore, turn right
immediately out of the airport onto Kapule Highway (Highway 51),
which eventually merges into Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) a mile down
the road. Kuhio Highway leads to the Coconut Coast and the North
Shore. Expect the trip to take 10 to 15 minutes if you’re headed for the
Coconut Coast, and about an hour if you’re staying in Princeville or
Hanalei on the North Shore.
If you’re heading to Poipu Beach or Waimea, follow Ahukini Road out of
the airport and turn left onto Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), which will
take you through Lihue. Stay in the right lane; in less than a mile, merge
right onto Kaumualii Highway (Highway 50), which will take you to the
south and southwest areas of the island. The highway doesn’t follow the
coast, however, so if you’re heading to Poipu, turn left on Maluhia Road
(Highway 520); it’s about 10 miles from where you picked up Highway 50.
You can expect about a half-hour trip to reach Poipu; getting to Waimea
takes 45 minutes or so.
If, for some reason, you don’t have a car, taxis are available at curbside;
however, if you know that you’re going to need a taxi when you arrive, 
I recommend arranging one in advance with Kauai Taxi Company
(% 808-246-9554; www.kauaitaxico.com). Expect the fare to cost
about $48 to reach Poipu, $25 to $28 to reach a Coconut Coast destina-
tion, or $80 to $100 to reach a North Shore destination.
Choosing Your Location
Kauai has three major resort areas: The Coconut Coast, on the East
Shore; the North Shore; and Poipu Beach, on the South Shore.
The Coconut Coast
Of all Kauai’s resort areas, the island’s East Shore makes the most con-
venient base for exploring the island. The Coconut Coast is just a 10- to
15-minute drive north of Lihue (li-hoo-ay), Kauai’s largest town and the
center of island life and commerce, which means that lots of conven-
iences are right at hand. It’s also at the midpoint of the main highway,
which connects the North Shore to the South Shore, so it couldn’t be
more centrally located for sightseeing and beach hopping. A gorgeous
mountain backdrop and leftover island-style plantation buildings help to
make what could have been a suburban-generic resort coast actually
rather charming. And the region’s main beach, Lydgate State Beach
Park, is a winner.
This area is geared toward value-conscious travelers. Your accommoda-
tions choices here are mostly mid- and budget-priced family-friendly
condos. However, although the East Shore doesn’t get as much rain as
the North Shore, it’s not as consistently dry and sunny as the South
Part VI: Kauai 
420

Shore, either; in winter, you should expect a bit more rain than you
might get in Poipu. Also expect more traffic and noise than what you’d
find in Poipu. On my last trip, I was surprised to encounter some honest-
to-goodness traffic jams in this area.
The North Shore
Kauai’s North Shore is as breathtaking as Hawaii gets. It boasts a string
of stunning beaches; two charming towns, Hanalei and Kilauea; lush
fields of taro as far as the eye can see; and cliffs so beautiful that they
starred as Bali Hai in the film version of South Pacific. A sophisticated
and well-manicured resort, Princeville, is tucked away on a peninsula
bluff so that you can enjoy it or ignore it as you see fit. No place on the
island is as soothing to the spirit as this verdant, almost magical coast.
So why don’t I tell everyone to stay up here, you ask? First of all, the
North Shore is quite removed; Lihue is a full hour’s drive away. Second,
the number of accommodations choices is limited. Third, the North
Shore gets lots of rain, especially in winter. Another turnoff is the winter
surf, which can be too turbulent for most swimmers.
Still, the North Shore’s stunning natural beauty more than makes up for
its shortcomings, and I highly recommend staying here. Your best bet is
to come in summer or fall, when the weather is usually excellent. Choose
Princeville if you like world-class golf and spa offerings. If resorts aren’t
for you, try a B&B or vacation rental in island-charming Hanalei, Kilauea,
Anini Beach, or Haena. But if you stay elsewhere, you should set aside at
least a full day to drive here and explore.
The South Shore: Poipu Beach
Excellent year-round weather, great beaches, a wealth of ocean activi-
ties, terrific golf and tennis, and an easy-access location make Poipu
Beach a terrific place to stay. This is Kauai’s all-around best choice in
terms of convenience, climate, activities, and natural beauty. You can’t
go wrong here, no matter what your budget or what kind of accommoda-
tions you’re looking for.
The beach is particularly family-friendly, and the whole area is surpris-
ingly relaxing considering its popularity. It’s one of Hawaii’s best resort
areas, simply because it hasn’t been overdeveloped. And although Poipu
may not be quite as breathtaking as the North Shore (what is?), its
sunny, vibrant setting — red earth, lush greenery, turquoise waves,
blond sand, clear blue skies — can hold its own in any natural-beauty
category. The only marks in the negative column are the 11⁄2-hour drive
to the North Shore, and tiny Koloa, a one-horse plantation town that’s a
bit too ticky-tacky for its own good.
Southwest Kauai: Kalaheo, Hanapepe, and Waimea
Just about a ten-minute drive inland and west from Poipu is Kalaheo, a
pleasantly quiet town offering some wallet-friendly, independent-style
Chapter 16: Settling into Kauai 421

accommodations as well as a more locals-only, nonresort location and
affordable restaurants.
In a bend in the road a few minutes west of Kalaheo is Hanapepe, self-
billed as “Kauai’s Biggest Little Town.” Hanapepe is finally beginning to
realize its years-long potential as an arts community, with an increasing
number of interesting galleries along its main street, Hanapepe Road.
Hanapepe particularly comes alive during its weekly Friday-night art walk.
The southwest town of Waimea is a good 45 minutes from Lihue and
nearly two hours from the North Shore. Not only is it sunny nearly year-
round, but it’s also home to one of my favorite places to stay, a charming
group of fully restored plantation-era beachfront cottages that will
charm the pants off even the most committed modernist. You should
know, however, that you’ll have to drive to the beach (the surf is rough
at Waimea and isn’t suitable for swimming), and you’ll spend a lot of
time in the car if you plan on exploring the island thoroughly. But one of
the most beautiful spots on the island, Waimea Canyon, is nearby, as is
the departure point for most Na Pali cruises.
Getting Around Kauai
You pretty much have to drive yourself around Kauai. The island has a
public transportation system, Kauai Bus (% 808-241-6410; www.kauai.
gov, click on “Transportation” then “Bus Schedules”), but it operates a
minimal fleet and is geared to serving locals, not visitors. It provides
only limited service to the resort areas, runs only during working hours
Monday to Saturday, and you’re not allowed to carry anything larger
than a shopping bag onboard. Taxis are available; call Kauai Taxi
Company (% 808-246-9554; www.kauaitaxico.com), but they’re not
really a viable means for regular transport, either.
Kauai is a compact island — only 25 miles long by 33 miles wide — and
easy to navigate. Still, it does take some time to get around because no
road cuts through the middle of the island, and no road goes all the way
around, thanks to the impassable Na Pali Coast at the northwest corner
of the island.
The island has two major highways, each beginning in Lihue, Kauai’s
biggest town and commercial hub. They each run basically around the
perimeter of the island — one north, one south — dead-ending at the Na
Pali Coast on each side. The entire drive, from end to end, takes about
three hours.
The two major highways are
 Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), which follows the coast north from
Lihue, leading through the Coconut Coast communities of Wailua,
Waipouli, and Kapaa (ka-pa-ah) to the North Shore, where it passes
by charming Kilauea (turn at the Shell Station, where the sign says
Part VI: Kauai 
422

“Kilauea Lighthouse,” if you want to explore) and, 5 miles beyond,
the carefully manicured Princeville resort. Then (31 miles and
about an hour’s drive beyond Lihue) Kuhio Highway runs directly
through Hanalei (probably my favorite little town in all Hawaii) and
Haena (mostly homes and vacation rentals) before ending at Kee
(keh-eh) Beach, where the Na Pali Coast begins.
 Kaumualii (cow-moo-a-lee-ee) Highway (Highway 50) heads south
from Lihue, passing through Kalaheo (ka-la-hay-oh) and Hanapepe
(ha-na-pay-pay) before reaching the little cowboy town of Waimea
(where you can pick up the road that climbs inward and upward to
Waimea Canyon; see Chapter 17 for details); at this point, you will
have traveled 23 miles, or about 45 minutes, west of Lihue. After
Waimea, the road curves north again before winding up in the far
west at Polihale (po-lee-ha-lay) Beach, ending at the other side of
the Na Pali Coast.
Highway 50 doesn’t hug the coast like its northern counterpart — it runs
roughly 4 miles inland until Hanapepe — so Maluhia Road (Highway 520)
cuts south to reach Poipu (po-ee-poo) Beach, Kauai’s most popular
resort, about 10 miles west of Lihue.
Kauai’s traffic problems definitely aren’t in the same league with places
like Los Angeles (or even Honolulu, for that matter). Still, because the
main highways have only one lane traveling in each direction, traffic can
bottleneck in certain spots, especially along the Coconut Coast. The con-
gestion has been getting notably worse in the past couple of years.
What’s more, the roads are curvy (especially after you start heading
toward the North Shore), and the speed limit doesn’t top 50 mph any-
where on the island. So don’t let the short distances fool you; it will take
a full hour to reach the North Shore from Lihue, and 20 minutes or so
longer if you’re traveling the additional 8 miles beyond Hanalei. Allow 
11⁄2 hours to reach Hanalei from Poipu.
Rates tend to be pretty reasonable on Kauai; in fact, this island features
some of Hawaii’s best lodging values. Still, Kauai is an increasingly popu-
lar destination, and travelers are booking rooms earlier and earlier each
year. So try to reserve your accommodations as soon as possible to
avoid missing out on your first choice.
Staying in Style
Remember that you almost never need to pay the asking price for a
hotel room. Check out Chapter 7 for details on how to avoid paying for
full-price hotel rooms. Also see Chapter 5 for advice on how to score an
all-inclusive package that can save you big bucks on both accommoda-
tions and airfare, and sometimes car rentals and activities too.

Aloha Sunrise Cottage/Aloha Sunset Cottage
$$
North Shore (Kilauea)
These two darling North Shore cottages are ideal for independent-minded
couples with a yen for natural beauty and seclusion. Hidden away near
Kilauea on 7 farmlike acres blooming with fruit trees and flowers, each
vacation rental is a beautifully outfitted and utterly charming 700-square-
foot tropical-style home. Each cottage comes complete with full kitchen,
dining table for two, lanai overlooking the expansive lawn and gardens,
washer/dryer, VCR with video library (there’s no TV reception), stereo
with CD player, wireless Internet, barbecue, beach supplies, and more.
There’s no A/C, but you’re highly unlikely to need it. The Aloha Sunset
Cottage is on one level, with a spacious master bedroom and a petite but
pristine bathroom. The Aloha Sunrise Cottage is on two levels, with the
bedroom and living room upstairs and the eat-in kitchen and bath down.
The innkeepers are gracious hosts, and are happy to offer you any advice
you need. Dining, shopping, and fabulous beaches are a pleasant drive
away. A simply delightful choice, especially for romance-seekers. Not
appropriate for families with children.

Bamboo Jungle House
$–$$
Kalaheo
Lucy and Terry Ryan, transplants from Cape Cod, have transformed what
was once only a so-so bed-and-breakfast into one of the most impeccable
and charming places to stay on the island. This charming plantation-style
Part VI: Kauai 
426

mini-estate has all of the hallmarks of a true tropical oasis. The U-shape of
the structure creates a sense of secluded comfort; at its heart are a lap
pool and a lava-rock Jacuzzi with its own waterfall that creates a soothing
sound that pervades the compound. The three guest suites are tucked
away in their own wing. Each is spotlessly maintained and boasts a com-
fortable queen-size bed draped in romantic netting, a well-outfitted private
bathroom stocked with local-made toiletries, TV with cable, a CD player,
wireless Internet access, and its own private lanai. My favorite is the
Bamboo Garden Suite, which features a cozy sitting area and a well-outfit-
ted kitchenette. The common areas are attractively outfitted and wel-
coming, and the breakfasts are deliciously prepared by chef Terry. Both
Lucy and Terry are warm and friendly hosts more than willing to offer local
information and advice. Lucy can also arrange for a to-die-for massage in
their open-air gazebo; you’ll pay a fraction of the cost that you would for
an equivalent experience at the Hyatt’s spa down the road. An ideal choice
for those who want a genuinely local, off-the-beaten-path experience.
Especially suitable for romance-seeking couples. The beach is about a ten-
minute drive away.

Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa
$$$$$
Poipu Beach
I have one big complaint about this hotel: I never get to stay here. It’s
always too full of contented vacationers who adore the high plantation
style, the easygoing vibe, the big and beautiful rooms, the excellent serv-
ice, and the pleasingly sunny South Shore location. The facilities are first-
rate — especially the sigh-inducing, open-air 25,000-foot Anara Spa, one of
the two best spas in the state. One of Hawaii’s best luxury hotels, the Hyatt
is fabulous in an understated way; everyone feels comfortable here. The
oversize, elegant rooms feature rich wood furnishings, well-chosen tropi-
cal fabrics, luxurious marble bathrooms, and spacious lanais (most with
ocean views). Because the ocean is rough here, the gorgeously landscaped
grounds boast a mega–pool complex that’s a total blast without being
over-the-top, plus 5 acres of swimming lagoons (with islands and a man-
made beach) that are perfect for learning to kayak.
The restaurants and lounges are elegant and satisfying across-the-board,
particularly Dondero’s for Italian and Tidepools for romantic open-air
Pacific Rim–style dining. The kids’ program is terrific, including evening
“camp” sessions that allow Mom and Dad to enjoy a romantic dinner alone.
The fitness center offers a good selection of equipment, plus an array of
free classes, and there’s also a tennis center with four courts. Next door is
the Robert Trent Jones, Jr.–designed Poipu Bay Golf Course, home to the
PGA Grand Slam of Golf. You won’t want for anything here. It’s perfect for
honeymooners, families, everybody. Book well ahead.

Hanalei Bay Resort
$$$
North Shore
This condo resort is a good North Shore choice, especially for families who
require the space and comforts of home. It overlooks the same fabled Bali
Hai cliffs and gorgeous golden beach as the ritzy Princeville Resort (see
the listing later in this chapter), but for a substantial savings. The apart-
ments boast plenty of room to spread out, plus rattan furnishings and big
lanais; however, quality can vary (these are individually owned condos),
so if you don’t like the one you’re assigned, ask to see an alternate unit.
Hotel rooms and studios are a spacious 570 feet, while the one-bedrooms
are a large 1,100 square feet and come with a fully outfitted kitchen; most
also have their own washer/dryer and a DVD player in the living room, but
you should inquire about the unit you are renting to avoid disappointment.
(There is coin-op laundry available on property if yours doesn’t boast its
own.) The superlush, terraced grounds feature two terrific freshwater
pools, Jacuzzis, and tennis courts, plus easy beach access. The restaurant
is just fine, and the lounge is a stellar place to sip a sunset cocktail. The
property is part timeshare, so beware; you will be invited to an “orienta-
tion” (read: sales) meeting, but you can ignore it.

Hanalei Colony Resort
$$$
North Shore
This small, quiet, low-rise condo resort is an extremely pleasant and afford-
able place to stay if you’re looking to experience Kauai’s pristine North
Shore in all its lush, tranquil, end-of-the-road glory. It’s well past Hanalei
town, near the very end of the North Shore highway — perfect if you’re
looking to get away from it all, less than ideal if you’re planning to do lots
of exploring. The golden beach that fronts the property is okay, but some
of Hawaii’s best beaches and most celebrated stretches of sand are close
by. The spacious two-bedroom apartments aren’t luxurious, but they have
recently undergone renovation, and they’re very comfortable; some of the
woodwork is a bit worn (an outcome of being this close to the sea), but
Part VI: Kauai 
428

the units are very nicely maintained. Pleasantly furnished in island style,
each one has a lanai, a complete kitchen, ceiling fans (air-conditioning isn’t
necessary), and beautiful views. While the mountain views are nearly as
fab as the ocean views, I recommend splurging on an ocean-view unit if
you can; after all, this is why you came to Hawaii, right? Twice-a-week maid
service is included, and a coin-op laundry is available. The atmosphere is
quiet and relaxing — no TVs or phones to interfere with the waves and
bird song. The Hanalei Day Spa offers massage, body wraps, yoga classes,
and other treatments. Even the kids won’t miss the TV; the resort has
plenty of beach gear at hand, plus a pool, lawn and board games, and more
to keep them happy. There’s an appealing restaurant on-site with live
entertainment most nights (complimentary wireless Internet access is only
available here), plus a pleasant coffee shop next door. Al in all, a delight-
ful place to get away from it all and recharge your batteries. Beware: The
nearest grocery store or restaurant is a 15-minute drive away, so stock up
on staples.

Hilton Kauai Beach Resort
$$$
Coconut Coast
This recent addition to Kauai’s limited full-service hotel scene has its pros
and cons. It has 350 guest rooms and suites spread over 25 lush, ocean-
facing acres. There’s a pool complex with two large pools and attractive
waterfalls, plus a water slide and sand-bottomed children’s pool for the
kids, and great ocean views. The freshly renovated rooms are attractive
and very comfortable, boasting Hilton’s own Serenity bed, travertine
marble in the well-appointed bathroom, its own lanai, and touches such
as desk-level electrical outlets and curved shower rods. There’s a nice spa
and fitness center on-site, and the central location is five minutes from the
airport and convenient to island attractions on both the north and south
shores. However, this location isn’t my favorite on the island; the beach is
a pleasant place for strolling, but you’ll have to drive to a swimmable one.
Also, the hotel was converted to a Hilton from a cheaper property, so it
doesn’t live up to what I expect from a Hilton, and is certainly well below
the standard maintained at the Oahu and Big Island properties. Still, it’s a
fine choice if you prefer a full-service hotel option and can’t afford the
Grand Hyatt or Princeville; I definitely prefer it over the nearby Marriott.

Kauai Coast Resort at the Beachboy
$$
Coconut Coast
This attractive low-rise hotel is a treat through and through for travelers
who don’t want to pay a fortune, but don’t want to sacrifice a beachfront
location, either. The sprawling grounds are as Hawaii should be, with sway-
ing palms and expansive lawns leading to a narrow gold-sand beach that’s
perfect for romantic strolls and sunset watching (just down the road is
Lydgate beach for swimming). Accommodations options are large studio-
style double rooms or one- and two-bedroom condo-style units. The
studio-style doubles feature a king bed, a compact fridge, a microwave, a
coffeemaker, and a private lanai with garden view. The one- and two-bed-
rooms have complete kitchenettes with full-size fridge and dishwasher,
plus a king bed in the master bedroom (as well as two twins in the second-
bedroom units), a sleeper sofa, and a private lanai with either ocean or
garden views. The warm-hued, island-style decor is quite attractive for the
price range, and everything is well maintained. Facilities include a small
but attractive pool with a waterfall, and a much-better-than-you’d-expect
restaurant. The location is one of the finest on the Coconut Coast, central
to both south and north shore attractions and adjacent to the Coconut
Marketplace, whose shops and restaurants are within walking distance.
All in all, a great mid-priced choice. The best value comes in the one-bed-
rooms, so book one if you can afford to do so.

Kauai Country Inn
$–$$
Coconut Coast (Kapaa)
Mike and Martina Hough traded in the L.A. rat race for the laid-back island
lifestyle, carving out their own special farmland corner of Kauai as their
newfound haven. Their Kauai Country Inn is the centerpiece of their 2-acre
organic fruit and flower farm, situated 4 miles inland from Kapaa town and
the island’s Coconut Coast.
The main house features four vacation-rental suites with a private
entrance and bathroom, plus a separate three-bedroom cottage. They’re
all thoughtfully outfitted in Hawaiian style; the one that’s right for you will
depend on your needs. My favorite is the Green Rose Suite, a spacious
upstairs one-bedroom, one-bath suite with vaulted ceilings, hardwood
floors, a well-outfitted full kitchen, a comfortable California king-size bed,
and its own 500-square-foot lanai with barbecue. The Plumeria Suite is
most notable for its big and beautiful bathroom with Jacuzzi tub, as well
as its own kitchenette and spacious lanai with barbecue; this one can be
converted to a large (1,200 sq. ft.) two-bedroom if your brood requires.
The 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom Country Cottage is best for families
(it’s the only accommodation that welcomes kids under 12), and a bargain

considering the quality and generosity of the living space. The Orchid Suite
is a beautiful bargain for wallet-watching couples. All accommodations fea-
ture TV with DVD player and their own computer with free Internet access
(in all main-house suites), as well as free wi-fi. Beach equipment is on hand
for guests, as are free laundry facilities.
The innkeepers are friendly and generous with advice on what to see and
where to go. Attention, Beatles fans: Ask Mike to show you his private
Beatles Museum, whose world-class collection of memorabilia includes
Brian Epstein’s own Mini Cooper S (open to guests of the inn only).

The only Poipu condos that sit right on the sand, this low-rise complex

a pleasant restaurant and bar are on-site, and a first-class tennis center with

if it lives up to its heady promise, should be an exciting addition to a hotel
scene that currently falls short in the modern-luxe category. The hotel will

Nihi Kai Villas
$$–$$$
Poipu Beach
This beautifully maintained Mediterranean-style condo complex, just a
block from the finest stretch of Poipu Beach, is an excellent choice on all
fronts. It’s lovingly and meticulously run, and the tropical-style condo-style
apartments are gorgeous. You can choose a one-, two- or three-bedroom
condo, ranging from 1,000 to 2,100 square feet. Each boasts a full kitchen
(with microwave and dishwasher), ceiling fans, washer/dryer, full cable
and VCR, CD player, lots of windows, and at least one lanai (usually two).
Bedding is usually a king or queen in the master, with two twins in the
extra bedrooms and a sleeper sofa in the living room, but there is some
variation across units, since these are individually owned condos. (Most
units have high-speed Internet access, but you should inquire to be sure
that yours does when you book if you need it.) All units are maintained to
a high standard. One of the things I like best is that you can go online,
review pictures, features (many have ocean views), and quality level
(they’re honest about which ones have been recently renovated and which
ones have not), and choose the one that best suits your family’s needs and
budget. The grounds are well landscaped and quiet, boasting two tennis
courts, paddle ball, barbecues, and two nice pools. Best of all, world-class
Poipu Beach is just a short walk away. There’s no daily maid service, but
I actually enjoyed it on my last stay; I didn’t mind rinsing my own break-
fast dishes, and I thoroughly enjoyed not having to worry about the intru-
sion. All in all, a delightful choice, with options for a range of budgets.

have ocean views. The two-bedroom/two-bathrooms can easily accommo-
date six, as long as two don’t mind sleeping in the living room; even my one-
bedroom unit had a second bathroom. The well-tended grounds feature a
pool, tennis courts, barbecues, and a coin-op laundry, and daily maid serv-
ice makes it feel like a real vacation. Not the best choice for those who
require Internet access, because only dial-up is currently available.

full-service hotel and home-style living worlds. The decor is contemporary
and attractive, and everything is fresh and new, including flatscreen TVs
and big, attractive bathrooms. Free wireless Internet access is a nice perk
for laptop toters. The heated salt-water pool meanders lagoon-like over two
acres and features a terrific set of water slides, waterfalls, and a sandy-bot-
tomed kids’ pool; the expansive grounds also feature three whirlpool spas,
a fitness center, and a very nice Aveda Spa and Salon. Book into building A

sunset watching, but you’ll have to drive elsewhere to swim.

This quiet, upscale cluster of condos is outstanding in every way but one:
The ocean is across the street and the nearest sandy beach is a block away,
Chapter 16: Settling into Kauai 433

even though the waves are right out your window. Still, I love the home-
away-from-home amenities and comforts in these very pleasing apart-
ments, and I hear nothing but good things from those who choose to stay
here. The beautifully manicured grounds feature an especially lovely pool,
barbecues, tennis courts (lit for night play), and an herb garden (you’re
welcome to take samples to cook with). The tropical-style apartments are
extra-large (one-bedrooms are 1,120 sq. ft., two-bedrooms are a massive
1,900–2,600 sq. ft.). All the one-bedrooms have two bathrooms, and most of
the two-bedrooms have three bathrooms, making this an ideal place for
family gatherings. The oceanfront two-story, two-bedroom town-house-
style units are my favorites because they catch the trade winds. All units
have full kitchens, ceiling fans, private lanais, VCRs, CD players, and free
high-speed Internet access; the two-bedrooms also have washer/dryers (a
coin-op laundry is on the grounds). Towels are changed three times a week,
and weekly maid service is offered for longer stays. It’s an excellent choice,
especially if you want a tranquil, residential-style ambience. All of Poipu’s
perks, including beaches and restaurants, are a stone’s throw away.

North Shore
This stunning North Shore resort, a member of Starwood’s Luxury
Collection, is among Hawaii’s very best; in fact, it’s nearly faultless. The
setting is breathtaking (you won’t be surprised to learn it’s the most popu-
lar site on Kauai for weddings), and the tiered hotel steps down the cliffs
above Hanalei Bay to take spectacular advantage of the views. A subdued
color palette and natural fibers strike the perfect note of comfortable
island elegance. Grand and gorgeous public spaces lead to universally siz-
able rooms that come outfitted with eye-catching original art, oversize win-
dows (no lanais, though), and bedside control panels for everything. Your
oversize green-marble bathroom features double sinks and a huge soak-
ing tub, plus a “magic” shower window that you can switch in an instant
from opaque to clear, allowing you to take in those awesome views even
as you shampoo.
The infinity pool is one of the state’s finest and comes complete with a
swim-up bar and always-attentive service. Just steps away is a golden-sand
beach with a wonderful snorkel reef for beginners and well-practiced
snorkelers alike; it remains well protected even when the winter waves kick
up. Additional perks include world-class golf (the Prince Course is regu-
larly named best in Hawaii by Golf Digest), a first-rate spa and fitness
center, a tennis center, a kids’ program, a resort shuttle, and excellent
dining options. Service is impeccable. It’s one of my all-time favorites;
needless to say, you’ll want for nothing here. Expensive, but divine.

With a wonderful beachfront location, this former Holiday Inn resort is a

and amenities. It fronts Lydgate Beach, the best beach on the Coconut
Coast, which has a playground and a protected natural pool that’s ideal for
young swimmers and first-time snorkelers. On-site extras include two
pools, a Jacuzzi, a coin-op laundry, two just-fine restaurants, and a sunset-
view lounge. The regular doubles are on the small side and could use some
upgrading, so book a suite (with pullout sofa), or — even better — a free-
standing family-size two-room beach cottage (with queen-size sleeper sofa
in the living room and a kitchenette with a microwave and a toaster) if
you’re traveling with the kids. If you need to stick with a standard room to
meet your budget, pick one with two queen-sized beds (rather than two
doubles) — they’re a bit larger. All in all, a reasonable beachfront place to
stay if you’re watching your wallet and can score a good deal, which you
usually can.

cue grills, a coin-op laundry, and the Coconut Marketplace just a stone’s
throw away add to its allure. Not luxurious, but a nice value. The only down-
side? Some of the rooms labeled “oceanview” are a stretch, so beware.

Sheraton Kauai Resort
$$$$$
Poipu Beach
This Sheraton is an excellent choice for visitors who like the advantages
that a resort hotel can offer, but who don’t care for the forced formality that
often goes along with it. The resort brims with aloha spirit and an easygo-
ing style that’s reminiscent of old Hawaii. You have a choice of three build-
ings: one nestled in tropical gardens with koi-filled ponds; one facing a
fabulous stretch of palm-fringed, white-sand beach (my favorite, of course);
and one ocean-facing wing that boasts great sunset views. Whichever you
choose, you’ll get a spacious, comfortably decorated room with minifridge;
most in the Ocean Wing have sofa beds, making them suitable for small fam-
ilies. Amenities include an oceanfront pool, a kids’ pool, and a Jacuzzi; a fit-
ness center with daily classes; tennis courts; a handful of restaurants (one
child 12 or under eats free for each paying grown-up in Shells, the signa-
ture restaurant); and a glass-walled lounge featuring live Hawaiian music
and sunset views. Rack rates are ridiculous, but specials abound.

$800–$3,500 suite. Mandatory “resort fee” of $18 for “free” local and 800-access
phone calls, use of the fitness center, wireless Internet access, self-parking,
Hawaiian craft and hula lessons, and more. Promotional rates and/or package deals
are almost always available, so be sure to ask; value rates from $199 at press time.

Sugar Mill Cottages
$
Poipu Beach
Attention, shoestring travelers: This simple plantation-style complex of 12
petite studio apartments sits on a pleasant residential parcel that’s part
of the Poipu Kai resort complex just a five-minute stroll from Brennecke’s
Beach, everybody’s favorite stretch of Poipu sand. Each studio for two
boasts cooling slate floors, air-conditioning, an attractive bathroom
(shower only), a kitchenette with all the tools to prepare a full meal, a
dining table, a TV and VCR, and air-conditioning (almost unheard of at
these low rates). Also request the kitchen that’s right for you because they
vary from petite to nearly full-size. Every three units share a free laundry
room, and each unit has its own beach cooler, towels, chairs, mats, and
toys, plus access to a swimming pool, a gas grill, and a tennis club with
Jacuzzi. This is a simple but solid place to stay in a great neighborhood
for budget travelers, but there’s no on-site manager, so it’s best for inde-
pendent types. The cottages are available for rent through two agencies
(see below), so be sure to price compare. Also, be sure to check Waikomo
Stream Villas (see review below), and stay there if prices are similar, as
you’ll get more space for your money there.

Waikomo Stream Villas
$
Poipu Beach
Here’s a real gem, perfect for families or anyone hoping for all the com-
forts of home at bargain-basement prices. These huge (1,100–1,500 sq. ft.),
well-managed, and attractive one- and two-bedroom apartments have
everything that you could possibly need — fully equipped kitchen, VCR
(plus DVD in most), CD player, high-speed Internet access, ceiling fans, a
king-size or queen-size bed in the master bedroom and a sofa bed in the
living room, washer/dryer, and private lanai, plus a second bathroom and
cathedral ceilings in the two-bedrooms — at very affordable prices. One of
the things I like best is that you can go online, review pictures and quality
level (they’re honest about which ones have been recently renovated or
upgraded to a premium level, and which ones have not), and choose the
one that best suits your family’s needs and budget. The beautifully land-
scaped complex boasts both adults’ and kids’ pools, tennis courts, and a
barbecue area; right next door is the Kiahuna Golf Course, designed by
Robert Trent Jones, Jr., so pack your irons and woods. The beach is a
seven-minute walk away — a worthy sacrifice for the kind of savings you’ll
realize here. Value-conscious travelers who need their space can’t do
better for the dough. No daily maid service, but for the savings that you
get here, you won’t mind pulling the blanket up on the bed or washing your
own breakfast dishes.
At press time, 15 percent discounts were being offered in order to com-
pensate for nearby daytime road construction and new development.
Guests report that the construction isn’t disruptive, especially if you’re
the type to be out all day, and it may very well be complete by the time
you arrive. If you’re concerned, I recommend that you call ahead and
check on the status (the kind folks at Parrish will be honest with you), and
ask for recommendations for a unit away from any current noise.

Wailua Bay View
$$
Coconut Coast
These one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartments on the beach aren’t fancy,
but they offer a wonderful value if your budget is tight. Every apartment
Chapter 16: Settling into Kauai 437

has at least a partial ocean view, plus a complete kitchen (with microwave
and dishwasher), ceiling fans, washer/dryer, TV with VCR, air-conditioning
in the bedroom, and a large furnished oceanview lanai. A sleeper sofa in the
living room makes each unit spacious enough for a budget-minded family of
four who don’t mind sharing. You can choose your own unit online; rates
vary a bit based on quality and view (I like cute number 205, as well as 309
for its premium views). Facilities include a small pool and barbecues.
Apartments closest to the road can be noisy, so book oceanview for maxi-
mum quiet. All in all, it’s an excellent value if you want cheap, comfortable
sleeps. You’ll have to make your own bed, but at these prices, who cares?

Whalers Cove
$$$$$
Poipu Beach
Condo living hardly gets better than this. The individually decorated apart-
ments are elegant and oversize; each has a full modern kitchen, a large fur-
nished lanai, washer/dryer, and ceiling fans throughout. Most have Jacuzzi
tubs in the master bathroom. The units are generally held to a high stan-
dard, but are individually owned and renovated at various times; when you
book, be sure to inquire as to the state of your unit in detail. The contem-
porary and stylish water’s-edge complex was smartly designed to give
each unit a spectacular view of the crashing surf. Hotel-like amenities
include bell service, concierge, and daily housekeeping; an elevator
(uncommon in condo complexes) is another nice luxury touch. A very nice
oceanside pool is on-site, plus a hot tub, a sauna, and barbecues. You’ll
have to drive to the beach, but there’s good swimming and snorkeling
(often with sea turtles) from a rocky cove.

More B&Bs worth writing home about
Tropically tranquil Kauai makes the ideal place to hide away in a B&B. If
you’re a fan, consider these enticing, and quite affordable, options.
In Lawai, a rural hillside community just a short drive from Poipu Beach,
you’ll find the much-beloved Kauai Banyan Inn ($–$$; % 888-786-3855;
www.kauaibanyan.com), offering five charming and beautifully outfitted
suites, a cute brand-new cottage, and a world of off-the-beaten-path
aloha. Rates run $130 to $150 per night.
On the Coconut Coast, consider Inn Paradise Kauai ($; % 808-822-
2542; www.innparadisekauai.com), whose friendly hosts provide
Part VI: Kauai 
438

three impeccably kept and thoughtfully outfitted guest suites, all with
kitchen facilities. Rates run $85 to $120 per night.
On the North Shore, consider the Palmwood Inn ($$$; % 808-631-9006;
web.mac.com/eddihenry), a newly constructed luxury inn built in the
style of a Japanese mountain ryokan. A unique and utterly elegant place
to stay for those who love streamlined Japanese style. Rates are $295 to
$325 per night.
For more options, contact Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts (% 800-
262-9912 or 808-263-3100; www.bestbnb.com), which represents some
delightful B&Bs on the island. The staff can book a room for you in a
Kauai inn that they have inspected and approved, and they offer vaca-
tion home rentals too.
Also check out the fine bed-and-breakfast members of the Kauai Visitors
Bureau, which can be found online at www.kauaidiscovery.com/
accommodations/bed+breakfasts.
Home, sweet vacation home
Kauai has lots of fabulous apartments, condos, and full homes that can
be rented by the day, the week, or the month, and many are just steps
from the ocean. Vacation rentals can be a fabulous deal. They often cost
no more than your average resort room, but for your money, you get a
whole house brimming with conveniences and privacy. Sometimes it’s
even cheaper to rent a home, especially after you factor in the extra
bucks you inevitably hand out at resorts for room service, poolside
cocktails, and the like. Vacation rentals are also the only available option
if you want to base yourself in the North Shore’s most appealing residen-
tial communities, such as Anini Beach, Hanalei, or Haena. Make sure that
you understand payment policies (including any cleaning fees and secu-
rity deposits) and minimum-stay requirements.
I’ve had great luck renting through Kauai Vacation Rentals (% 800-367-
5025 or 808-245-8841; www.kauaivacationrentals.com), which han-
dles top-quality vacation rentals all over the Garden Isle. It has a particu-
larly fab selection on the lush North Shore; renting a home on this quiet
coast is a great way to commune with nature, especially for those who
favor being on their own over the sometimes-smothering atmosphere 
of a big resort. KVR has something for everybody; prices start at about
$850 a week for a cozy cottage for two ($700 for a studio condo) and
reach into the thousands for luxurious multibedroom beachfront homes.
Check out the complete list of options on the extensive Web site. One of
my favorites is the ultracharming Ursula Taylor home, a modern two-
bedroom done in traditional plantation style; it’s perfectly located, just
across the street from idyllic Hanalei Bay and a walk from charming
Hanalei town, and it goes for $1,750 a week.
Poipu Beach Vacation Rentals (% 800-684-5133 or 808-742-2850; www.
pbvacationrentals.com), formerly known as Gloria’s Vacation Rentals,
Chapter 16: Settling into Kauai 439

offers an excellent selection of vacation-rental cottages, condos, and
homes in Poipu and around the island, ranging from $85 to $429 per
night. Now that Gloria is retired, the business is run by her son, Amos
Merkle; you can expect the same great quality and service that Gloria
offered Kauai visitors for 20 years.
Another agency that represents an extensive collection of North Shore
vacation rentals is Hanalei North Shore Properties (% 800-488-3336
or 808-826-9622; www.kauai-vacation-rentals.com). For the best 
deal in sunny Poipu Beach, on either a condo or a full vacation home,
call the Parrish Collection Kaua’i, formerly known as Grantham Resorts
(% 800-325-5701 or 800-742-2000; www.parrishkauai.com). In addition
to managing the Nihi Kai Villas and Waikomo Stream Villas (both
reviewed earlier in this chapter), Parrish handles a wonderful selection
of Poipu-area rental units in a range of other condo developments as
well as dozens of Poipu-area houses (including some beachfront homes
that turned me pea green with envy on my visit to Poipu). Parrish also
rents out Hale Manu, a lovely three-bedroom house on the North Shore,
situated on a lush and fragrant flower farm, which goes for $265 to $400
per night (plus a $200 cleaning fee), as well as a wealth of other great
rentals around the island. Parrish sets exacting standards for all their
rentals; when you rent a Parrish apartment or home, you know that
you’re getting high quality and top value for your dollar. You can — and
should — peruse its full list of properties on the Web. Hawaii’s Best Bed
& Breakfasts (see the section “More B&Bs worth writing home about,”
earlier in this chapter) also represents some excellent vacation homes
on Kauai.
Dining Out
The gorgeous Garden Isle has used its not-so-subtle charms to woo some
of Hawaii’s finest chefs over to its shores. Still, as you might expect, the
dining scene is not quite so broad here as it is on the other islands. For
reasons that escape me, Kauai has an excess of quality Italian, zesty
island-style Mexican, and great burgers — not that I’m complaining,
mind you. Whether you’re looking for a romantic candlelit dinner, fresh
seafood in an oceanfront setting, or just a great island-style pizza, you’ll
find some terrific choices.
In the following restaurant listings, each restaurant review is followed by
a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar
signs are meant to give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one
person — including appetizer, main course, dessert, one drink, tax, and
tip — is likely to set you back. The price categories go like this:
$
Cheap eats — less than $20 per person
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$35
$$$
Moderate — $35–$50
Part VI: Kauai 
440

$$$$
Pricey — $50–$75
$$$$$
Ultraexpensive — more than $75 per person
Of course, it all depends on how you order, so stay away from the surf
and turf or the north end of the wine list if you’re on a tight budget. To
give you a further idea of how much you can expect to spend, I also
include the price range of main courses in the listings.
The state adds roughly 4 percent in taxes to every restaurant bill. The
percentage may vary slightly depending on the county you’re in, and
may be embedded in the total purchase price or shown as an independ-
ent line item on your bill. A 15 to 20 percent tip is standard in Hawaii,
just like on the mainland.
Bar Acuda
$$–$$$
North Shore
Contemporary Mediterranean
This newish tapas restaurant and wine bar is a welcome addition to the
North Shore dining scene. The restaurant comprises a gorgeously simple
Balinese-style dining room, a sleek mahogany bar, and an outdoor dining
area overlooking a lush tropical garden; Tiki torches enhance the roman-
tic mood after dark. The designer simplicity belies Bar Acuda’s low prices.
Come for an elegant family-style spread of nouveau tapas designed for
sharing; highlights include grilled ahi tuna on a bed of truffled potatoes,
medjool date and celery salad dressed with Parmesan Reggiano, home-
made mozzarella served with sweet cherry tomatoes and fresh basil, and
a foie gras torchon served with crisp Fuji apple and walnut toasts. For a
decadent but delicious main, consider the slow-braised beef short ribs
with date and almond salsa seca. This is a great choice for grown-up
palates with a penchant for creative fare and casually sophisticated set-
tings. Look for this place to shine.
See map p. 442. At Hanalei Center, 5–5161 Kuhio Hwy., Hanalei. % 808-826-7081.

Open: Dinner Tues–Sun.
The Beach House Restaurant
$$$$
Poipu Beach
Hawaii Regional
The open-air, on-the-ocean setting makes this place my favorite special-occa-
sion restaurant on Kauai. The long, Japanese-inspired room is lined with
shoji-like windows that make sunset a celebration every night and let in a
symphony of surf after dark. The first-rate food lives up to the setting nicely;
in 2006, Honolulu magazine once again crowned the Beach House as “Best
Kauai Restaurant.” Under the steady hand of chef Todd Barrett, the kitchen
turns out creative island dishes that feature the best of the land and sea,
from fresh-caught fish and island-raised beef to locally harvested organic
greens and salt. The menu changes nightly, but count on such winners as
macadamia nut–crusted mahimahi in citrus miso sauce or mint-coriander
marinated rack of lamb roasted with a goat cheese–garlic crust — yum! And

Blossoming Lotus
$$
Coconut Coast (Kapaa)
Vegan World Fusion
Let’s get one thing straight — I am not a fan of vegetarian restaurants
(much less vegan ones). In fact, I tend to be quite skeptical of them. It’s
not because I don’t love good vegetable-focused dishes — I do. I just don’t
like being obligated to eat vegetarian, or being coerced into eating seitan
or tempeh that “tastes just like chicken.” Not so at this wonderful restau-
rant, a multiple award winner, where you just won’t miss the meat — trust
me. The inventive chefs find the joy in the land’s natural bounty. Highlights
of the endlessly creative menu include the Rockin’ Moroccan spiced and
seared tofu, served with gingered adzuki bean couscous, braised oyster
mushrooms, and sautéed greens with a truffled lemon cream sauce; and a
terrific spanakopita, a Greek classic given the Blossoming Lotus twist with
marinated tofu, organic island greens, and sun-dried tomato sage sauce.
Ingredients are kosher and certified organic whenever possible. Those
dishes marked by a lotus on the menu are “Living Foods” selections, not
heated above 116°F to preserve heat-sensitive enzymes, which raw foods
aficionados consider to be highly nutritious. The high-ceilinged room is
attractive with a pleasant ambience, and service is friendly and casual.
Wine and beer are available, and live music or DJ adds to the mood most
nights. The restaurant also serves a terrific vegan brunch on Sundays from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Just a few doors down, the Lotus Root Juice Bar and Bakery ($), at 4-1384
Kuhio Hwy. (% 808-823-6658), serves breakfast and lunch items, includ-
ing bountiful wraps and organic plate lunches, daily from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.
In the Historic Dragon Building, 4504 Kukui St. (at Kuhio Highway), in the heart of

Japanese/Island Eclectic
Neither raw fish nor live entertainment gets any better on Kauai than what
you’ll find at this loftlike second-floor restaurant and sushi bar (formerly
called Sushi Blues), which is one of the most satisfying and fun places to
eat on the island. The first-rate sushi chef is a master with ultrafresh fish,
much of it caught in island waters or flown in from Japan. There’s also a big
bar with a dizzying menu of martinis, tropical drinks, international beers,

chicken, and steaks for sushi-phobes; and gorgeous Bali Hai views. The
restaurant hosts live music — generally jazz and blues — that creates a

“Right on the Beach, Right on the Price.” If you have kids in tow, skip the
Beach House in favor of this fun, casual restaurant, which boasts ocean
views galore. The fresh fish specials attract locals and visitors alike —
always a good sign of consistent quality. Well-priced and well-prepared
seafood and prime rib dinners (all of which include the creamy New
England–style chowder or the appealing salad bar) are guaranteed to make
Mom and Dad fans, and the best burgers in Poipu (plus a children’s menu)
will keep the kids happy. This longtime favorite is so welcoming and laid-
back that you can come in straight off the beach for baby back ribs, kiawe-
broiled (mesquite-broiled) seafood kebabs, or surprisingly good veggie
selections. The restaurant has great sunset mai tais, too, plus a full menu
of island-style munchies at happy hour (2–5 p.m.). The ground-floor

Kalaheo

Just a ten-minute drive from Poipu Beach, this full-service mom-and-pop

century. It’s the real thing: traditional or whole-wheat crust topped with
homemade sauces, high-quality cheeses, and your choice from the long
toppings menu, and then baked in a real brick oven. You can choose stan-
dard-size pies to share or smaller individual ones if you and the kids just
can’t agree. A very good beer selection that includes Gordon Biersch and
Kona brews is available to wash it all down. The setting is pleasant, with
red-checked tablecloths, old license plates decorating the walls, and
friendly, attentive service — but the terrific pies alone are worth the drive
west from Poipu.

“Bubba refuses to serve any burger costing less than a can of dog food.”
“The food is hot, the service is cold, and the music’s TOO DAMN LOUD.”
Quick wit and commercial appeal aside, Bubba serves up one mean ham-
burger. It’s served on a toasted bun with mustard, relish, diced onions, and
lots of attitude — and is it yummy. Bubba burgers are plump and juicy, so
have a pile of napkins ready and waiting. Chicken, ginger-teriyaki tempeh,
and fish burgers are also available, plus variations on the standard Bubba:
the Slopper (served open-faced and smothered in Budweiser chili), the
three-patty Big Bubba, and the Hubba Bubba (with a scoop of rice and a
hot dog, all smothered in chili and onions). If you need a burger fix, you

Eclectic
Most people think of La Cascata, Princeville’s elegant Mediterranean-

But I just love Cafe Hanalei’s perfect Bali Hai mood. A romantic indoor-out-
door setting makes the most of breathtaking Hanalei Bay and Na Pali views.
The marvelously modern seafood-rich menu features Asian and
Mediterranean accents (and includes plenty of selections to satisfy steak
lovers, too). Add in first-rate service, and you’ve got an ideal dining expe-
rience. Book a table on the casually elegant terrace for the ultimate dinner
for two. The bounteous Sunday champagne brunch boasts sushi and raw
bars (all the peel-and-eat shrimp and crab legs you can put away!) as well
as hot carving stations and made-to-order omelets and crepes. The food is
satisfying through and through.
If you’re in the mood for Italian instead, the resort’s intimate and roman-

simply wonderful. You can dine casually on healthful soups, salads (includ-
ing an excellent Greek), and sandwiches or opt for something more sub-
stantial. The beautifully prepared main plates include seared fresh ahi,
crusted in delicate panko and served with a cilantro pesto and papaya
salsa; Arista pork, slow roasted with garlic and herbs and served South
American–style, with black beans, rice, and tortillas; and a couple of cre-
ative, healthful pastas. The kitchen prepares all its own breads, baked
goods, juices, salsas, curries, and chutneys. Dining is in the fragrant flower-
and-fruit garden, under flickering Tiki torches that set an idyllic island
mood. The restaurant is an excellent choice for vegetarians, especially, but
I recommend it for everyone else, too. Service is Hawaiian-style, so dine
elsewhere if you’re in a hurry (this is Kauai — what’s your rush?). Live
entertainment on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights adds to the
already-winning ambience. A $5 corkage is charged if you bring your own

$$–$$$
Poipu Beach
Mediterranean/Island
Befitting its name, this terrific all-day restaurant possesses an open-air
romantic ambience with touches of the exotic; dining here is akin to being
entertained post-safari on a friend’s elegant outdoor patio. The setting is
casually sophisticated — cool tile floors, rattan and iron chairs tucked
under marble-topped tables, lazily whirling ceiling fans generating refresh-
ing breezes. I imagine Ernest Hemingway hunched over his umpteenth
drink at the bar. The exciting menu is always excellently prepared. Start
the day with Basque piperrada (Spanish scrambled eggs) or crepes dressed
with fresh island fruit. Midday brings a selection of fresh, creatively
dressed sandwiches and salads, such as the spinaci salad, fresh spinach
tossed with garlic-Dijon vinaigrette with crisp pancetta and pine nuts, or
the Casa Pita plate, featuring Mediterranean-spiced chicken or lamb in a
pita with minted yogurt sauce, served with a range of daring accompani-
ments. A menu of small tapas dishes for grazers and family-style sharing
is also available midday; I adore the thick, zesty hummus served with fluffy
pita. Both the island ambience and the culinary sophistication get a boost
at dinner, when the beautifully presented plates shine with such flavorful
dishes as zarzuela (Spanish seafood and saffron stew) and New Zealand
rack of lamb with raisin-apricot demi-sauce. A belly dancer provides fit-
ting entertainment on Thursday nights.

picked fresh from the kitchen garden. The setting is sublime, whether you
choose to dine indoors in a beautiful marble-tiled setting reminiscent of
Tuscany with exquisite Franciscan artwork or on an outdoor patio that
says “Only in Hawaii.” Specialties of the house include an open-faced
seafood “lasagna,” a pan-ocean treat of house-made black ink pasta topped
with Pacific lobster, gulf shrimp, and lump blue crab meat, dressed in
béchamel sauce and marinara. You might also consider the braised short
rib ravioli in wild mushroom sauce (yum!) or a delectable slow-braised
osso bucco. The tiramisu is worth saving room for. You’ll pay too much,
but the food, wine list, ambience, and service are top-notch, making this

Duane’s Ono-Char Burger
$
North Shore
Burgers
Bubba (see the listing earlier in this chapter) would just cringe if I called
him “establishment,” but compared with Duane’s, Bubba is the Wal-Mart
of Kauai burgers. Little more than a red-painted roadside stand with a few
picnic tables and some resident wild chickens, I think Duane’s sets the
standard for island-style burgers, but opinions are perpetually divisive. I
dream about the Local Girl, a juicy patty topped with teriyaki, Swiss
cheese, pineapple, mayo, and lettuce on a bun — a perfect packet of juicy
goodness. Broiled fish sandwiches and Boca burgers provide options for
those who don’t eat red meat. Sublime fries, shakes, and floats round out
the lunchtime experience (or pop into the Whaler’s General Store next
door for a beer to enjoy with your burger). Stop by on the way to the North
Shore or pick up a takeout beach lunch, especially if eating while chickens
and stray cats hang about waiting for your scraps will bother you. (Kealia

fabulous, but some of the tables miss out. The Barefoot Bar, which spills
out onto the sand and boasts its own waterfall (fake, of course), is the

Hamura’s Saimin Stand
$Lihue
Local Hawaiian
I’ve eaten lots of memorable gourmet meals in Hawaii, but this nondescript
lunch counter, family owned since 1951, is the place that makes me yearn
for a repeat visit. Located on an industrial side street just off Lihue’s main
drag, Hamura’s serves up Hawaii’s best saimin (ramen-style noodle soup).
Cozy up to one of the U-shaped counters and order off the posted menu.
The saimin here comes in a variety of sizes and with a variety of extras,
like veggies and a hard-boiled egg. Other offerings include succulently
broiled beef and chicken skewers (a steal at $1 a stick) and Chinese pret-
zels, which are like hard funnel cakes. (I like to put them in my saimin —
a cultural travesty, I’m sure.) Don’t be put off by the brisk service; you’ll
feel right at home — and you’ll be done eating — in no time. You can also
get your saimin to go in Chinese food containers — perfect if you need a
hearty bite on the way to the beach (or the airport). This cultural adven-
ture is a culinary marvel, so outstanding that it was honored with a James
Beard Award in 2006.

Fresh-off-the-boat seafood and a nicely romantic tropical-garden setting
on the banks of the Hanalei River make the Hanalei Dolphin a very pleas-

refreshingly simple. Choose from a wide selection of the day’s catches,
which come charbroiled or Cajun-style, with salad and rice, pasta, or steak
fries on the side (plus hot homemade bread). Alaskan king crab is always
on hand, but why bother? Go with one of the island catches, such as ruby-
red ahi, moist and tender onaga (red snapper), or mackerel-like ono
(wahoo). Starters include such retro classics as shrimp cocktail and
stuffed mushroom caps, and sweet finishes include old-fashioned delights
like strawberry cheesecake and ice-cream pie. Steaks and chicken are
available for non–fish eaters.

This unpretentious restaurant in the heart of Hanalei town is a great choice
for an informal bite at any time of day. Breakfast standards and lunchtime
burgers, deli sandwiches, and salads give way to dinner specialties like pan-
fried Asian-style crab cakes, macadamia-nut fried chicken, and charbroiled
pork chops, deliciously seasoned with locally harvested salt that has its
own hearty, wonderfully distinct flavor. It’s easy to modulate your dinner
bill by sticking with burgers and pasta. The focus is on fresh local produce,
low-sodium meats, fresh-baked and whole-grain, but deliciously rather than
obsessively so. Service is super-friendly and super-easygoing — but the
North Shore isn’t the place to be in a hurry, anyway. Choose a table on the
veranda if the TV set over the bar interferes with your Hanalei reverie — or
take a seat inside to catch the game. There’s live music most evenings, plus
pleasing tropical drinks and a good range of beers on tap. A kids’ menu is

Southwest Kauai (Hanapepe)
Fresh Island/Vegetarian/Italian
This bright, airy, and exceptionally friendly cafe and espresso bar has been
drawing in locals and visitors alike for years for yummy, farm-fresh gour-
met vegetarian cuisine. But the cafe really came into its own over the last
couple of years — and now that baker Doug Jopling has arrived on the
scene, Hanapepe Cafe is making a whole new name for itself as the quin-
tessential village bakers. Start the day with multigrain pancakes, a well-
stuffed frittata, or one of Jopling’s celestial cinnamon buns. Stick around
for a hearty, healthful salad, or sandwich on sweet challah or hearty seven-
grain at lunch, or perhaps one of the restaurant’s range of veggie burgers.
Friday-night dinners (the only night dinner is served) are the big draw,
however, now that there’s fish on the previously all-vegetarian menu. The
menu changes weekly, but highlights to watch for include delectable mani-
cotti, shrimp and asparagus crepes in a creamy alfredo sauce, and any-
thing prepared with the homemade marinara. No alcohol is served, but
you’re welcome to BYOB. Live music adds to the ambience, and the open-
’til-late art galleries along Hanapepe Road make the entire night a memo-

This island-style bistro keeps improving with age; it has matured into a ter-

menu is a tad generic — pastas, salads, island fish — so I was pleasantly
surprised with the high quality and tastiness of the burrito-like ahi wrap.
My fellow diners were equally pleased with selections that ranged from a
bounteous Caesar salad to a fresh grilled mahi sandwich. At dinner, the
coconut shrimp in a sweet chili sauce or the chargrilled pork medallions
topped with pineapple chutney are tropical delights, and the broiled sir-
loin steak topped with a Gorgonzola cheese and burgundy sauce will
appeal to classic tastes. An extensive and pleasing wine list — with some
nice affordable choices — is also on hand at dinner. There’s mood-setting

Korean style, in butter lettuce cups with Asian veggies, or the sweet local
pear salad served atop Kauai-grown baby arugula with toasted almonds
and Gorgonzola, dressed in an orange-sesame vinaigrette. Follow with lov-

tucked into the Hawaiian Variety plate, a gourmet version of the traditional
local plate lunch featuring delectable pulled kalua pork and cabbage,
lomilomi salmon, and sushi-grade ahi poke (marinated in soy sauce). Other
menu highlights included crisp and bountiful entree-size salads, bistro-
style burgers, Mexican dishes done island-style (such as ahi fajitas),
macadamia-nut-crusted ahi, and plenty of vegetarian choices, such as
Shanghai tofu in an orange-ginger glaze. Other perks include an espresso
bar, a smoothie bar, and local favorite, Lappert’s ice cream. They’ll even
pack you a picnic for your hike or day at the beach. BYOB. There’s now a
second location in Kapaa (4-1639 Kuhio Hwy.; % 808-822-1945), but I rec-
ommend sticking with the Hanalei original.

Seafood
This unassuming vintage plantation house on the edge of Hanalei houses
a globe-hopping seafood restaurant. Choose a seat in the schoolhouse-
simple but exceedingly charming dining room or out on the wide veranda
for alfresco dining. The kitchen uses no meat, poultry, refined sugar, or
foods with chemical additives. But healthy doesn’t mean bland. The crea-
tive kitchen pulls out the pan-cultural stops, from yummy taro fritters
topped with papaya salsa to Indian-spiced potato-phyllo pockets (much
like samosas) to crisp Thai summer rolls served with a spicy peanut sauce.
The day’s fresh-caught fish can be served grilled or blackened, with
macadamia butter, peppered pineapple sage, or a honey-ginger-Dijon
sauce, while wasabi-crusted ahi gets a flavorful zest from mirin soy ginger
sauce. I’ve always loved Postcards for its innovative yet unfussy prepara-
tions and the freshness of the local ingredients; the friendly (if at times

PukaDog
$
Poipu Beach
Casual American
When irreverent chef and adventure travel rogue Anthony Bourdain, of the
Travel Channel’s No Reservations, had the opportunity to dine anywhere
he wanted in Hawaii, he headed straight for PukaDog. This simple store-
front hot dog stand has Hawaiianized the hot dog for unrepentant gour-
mands in search of local culinary experiences.
PukaDog starts by baking a bun-size loaf of bread from their own house
recipe. Once you place your order, they pierce a hole in one end (puka
means “hole” in Hawaiian), toast the bun, insert a perfectly grilled Polish-
style sausage, and dress it to your taste. You’ll customize with your choice
of secret sauce — mild garlic-lemon, spicy jalapeño, hot chili pepper, or
super-hot habanero — and tropical relish (mango, coconut, banana,
pineapple, papaya, or star fruit). Top it all off with the condiment of your
choice; my favorite is the lilikoi (passion fruit) mustard. It’s a delicious and
filling tropical treat. Service is aloha friendly, and a veggie dog is available
for those who don’t do meat. There’s now a Waikiki location, too, but this
is the Puka Dog original.

Roy’s Poipu Bar & Grill
$$$–$$$$
Poipu Beach
Hawaii Regional
More casual than Roy’s other establishments throughout Hawaii, Roy’s
Poipu is my favorite of the famous chain. Star chef Roy Yamaguchi’s take
on Hawaii Regional Cuisine has a distinctly Asian accent. Thanks to an
extensive grazing menu of dim sum, appetizers, and imu-baked pizzas, you
can easily eat inexpensively here; my husband and I got no guff at all from
the waitstaff for building a meal from the starter menu (love those spinach-
shiitake ravioli). Signature dishes include luscious Szechuan baby back
ribs (better than dessert!) and blackened ahi with a delectable soy mus-
tard butter. The service is friendly and easygoing, in keeping with the lively
ambience, and the wines bottled under Roy’s own label are affordable and
surprisingly good. Roy’s is a winner that continues to live up to its stellar
reputation in every way.

Waimea Brewing Company
$$
Waimea Island
Eclectic
This casual restaurant on the sunny west side is a just-fine spot for a late
lunch or early dinner after a day spent at Waimea Canyon or Kokee State
Park (see Chapter 17). Housed in an attractively restored 1940s plantation
house with a pleasant outdoor patio, the restaurant is easygoing and kid-
friendly. The big, high-ceilinged, open-air room is barefoot casual, with
shiny blond wood floors and walls decorated with Hawaii movie posters.
Don’t expect much from the food — straightforward bar food like Buffalo
wings, burgers, nachos, and mango-stout-glazed barbecue ribs. Instead,
come thirsty and order up a microbrewed Na Pali Pale Ale (the owner’s
favorite) or a Lilikoi Light (refreshing, with a hint of passion fruit). The IPA
is the house-special beer, but it’s not for the faint of heart. Service can be
slow, so once you have your beer, settle in and relax. Not worth seeking
out, but a reasonable stop if you’re on the west side.
See map p. 442. Adjacent to the Waimea Plantation Cottages, 9400 Kaumualii Hwy.

Wrangler’s Steakhouse
$$$
Waimea
Steaks
This popular Tex-Mex/Hawaii-style steakhouse has “cowboy” written all
over it. It’s a rustically charming place with good food, good service, and
pleasant veranda seating. The menu leans toward hearty burritos, meaty
sandwiches, and substantial salads at lunch, and good-value complete
steak dinners at day’s end. Your lil’ pardners will love the Wild West setting
and the finger-friendly food, including juicy flame-broiled burgers served
with steak-cut fries. The menu also has a few fish and chicken options (like
ahi with penne pasta) for non–red-meat eaters.

Luau!
When it comes to luau, Kauai excels in quantity rather than quality. Not
one is in the ballpark with Maui’s Old Lahaina Luau or Feast at Lele (see
Chapter 12), or the Big Island’s Kona Village Luau (Chapter 14). Still, if
you want to join an island-style party on the Garden Isle, the following
are your best bets; be sure to reserve in advance.
At press time, you could save up to 10 percent on the price of admission
by booking the luau listed below through Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 800-
621-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com).

Grand Hyatt Kauai Luau
This lively Poipu Beach luau is an expensive but generally satisfying luau
choice on the south shore. It boasts a lovely tropical garden setting and a
bountiful spread, which includes a full imu (underground pig roasting) cer-
emony. The lively floor show features Hawaiian and Tahitian dances as well
as Samoan fire dancers in a loosely threaded narrative that tells the story
of ancient Polynesian history and migration to the islands.

essential. Admission: $94 adults, $84 teens (13–20), $57 kids (6–12). Prices include
open bar. Times: Sun and Thurs at 6 p.m.
Luau Kalamaku
The old-school Gaylord’s luau has been reborn as one of the most the-
atrical and satisfying luau productions in the islands. The party is held on
the lovely grounds of a historic 1930s plantation house in the lush heart of
the island, and the show is centered around telling an in-depth story of
Hawaii’s heritage in an artful, original showcase that the performers seem
genuinely proud of. The fire-knife dancer doesn’t disappoint, either. It fea-
tures a traditional imu ceremony starring a kalua-roasted pig, plus a boun-
tiful and delicious luau spread, a full open bar (not just mass-prepared mai
tais), and traditional Hawaiian craft demonstrations and games. Expensive,
but worth it — and definitely the luau to choose if you want to avoid silly
audience participation.
See map p. 442. At Kilohana Plantation, 3-2087 Kaumualii Hwy. (Highway 50), 1 mile
west of Lihue. % 877-622-1780. www.luaukalamaku.com. Reservations required.
Admission: $95 adults, $65 teens 12–18, $45 kids 3–11, free for kids 2 and under. Prices
include open bar. Time: Tues and Fri 4:30, 5, and 5:30 p.m. check-in times available.
Smith Family Garden Luau
This old-school luau is set among 30 tropical garden acres that are simply
magical as the sun goes down. Now, if only the food lived up to the setting.
Expect a traditional imu ceremony followed by a generous spread of
decently prepared traditional dishes like kalua pig, teriyaki chicken, poi,
and coconut cake alongside such familiar standards as teriyaki beef, fried
rice, and Jell-O. There’s a traditional imu ceremony, a guided tram tour
around the grounds, and the “Rhythm of Aloha” show, complete with its
own erupting volcano. Come expecting some good cheesy fun, and you
won’t be disappointed.
At Smith’s Tropical Paradise and Fern Grotto, 174 Wailua Rd., just beyond Wailua
Marina at the mouth of the Wailua River; turn off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) into
Wailua Marine State Park. % 808-821-6895. Reservations required. Admission: $75
adults, $30 kids 7–13, $19 for kids 6 and under. Mai tai, beer, wine, and fruit punch
included in admission. 10 percent online booking discount. Time: Mon, Wed, and Fri
at 5 p.m. (Mon–Fri in summer months).

f any island was made for kicking back, Kauai is it. That said, you can
find plenty of wonderful things to do on Kauai, especially if you’re the
type of traveler who prefers communing with nature over seeking out
man-made attractions and entertainment.
Check with the excellent Maui-based activity center Tom Barefoot’s
Tours (% 800-621-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com), which
may be able to save you a few dollars on many of Kauai’s activities on
land and sea.
Enjoying the Sand and Surf
Kauai is the oldest of the Hawaiian Islands, geologically speaking —
which means that it’s had plenty of time to fashion some world-class
beaches. Lined with powdery white sands and dotted with swaying
palms, the island’s stunning shoreline is skirted by crystal-clear waters
and numerous well-developed reefs for snorkeling.
Combing the beaches
Safety takes top priority at the beach. Always check on the local surf
conditions before you head into the water. At beaches without life-
guards, keep an eye out for posted signs warning of dangerous currents
or conditions. If you see a red flag hoisted at any beach, don’t venture
into the water; the flag indicates that conditions are unsafe for swim-
mers. And never turn your back on the ocean; big waves can come out of
nowhere in a matter of minutes.

Never leave valuables in your rental car while you’re at the beach.
Thieves prey on tourists, and they can get inside your car quicker than
you can spread out your beach towel.
On the Coconut Coast
The following beaches are located along the Kuhio Highway (Highway
56) north of Lihue.
Lydgate State Beach Park
My favorite beach on the Coconut Coast offers the safest swimming and
the best snorkeling on the eastern shore. A rock wall breaks the open
ocean waves, forming a protected natural pool that’s perfect for kids and
first-time snorkelers. Wide, grassy lawns lead downhill to an expanse of
fine-grained sand with dramatic vistas in either direction. Among the facil-
ities are a pavilion, restrooms, outdoor showers, picnic tables, barbecues,
lifeguards, and plenty of parking. Note that the waves can be rough out-
side the protected pool, even in summer, so beware.
See map p. 462. At the ResortQuest Aloha Beach Resort, Kuhio Highway (Highway
56), 5 miles north of Lihue (just south of Wailua River State Park). To get there: Look
for the turnoff at Leho Road.
Kealia Beach
This long, wide, crescent-shaped beach is a great place to play in summer.
Gorgeous golden sands fringe white-crested turquoise waters that are suit-
ably calm, particularly at the north end — but beware winter and year-
round late-day swells. This local favorite is particularly popular with
casual bodysurfers. Kealia is a perfect spot for those seeking solitude
because it has plenty of room for everybody to spread out, even on
summer weekends; however, there are no facilities. Park in the dirt lot and
don’t leave any valuables in your car.
See map p. 462. On Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) just north of Kapaa town, across
from the Kealia Country Store.
On the North Shore
Welcome to the finest beaches in Hawaii — but bear in mind that most of
Kauai’s North Shore beaches aren’t safe for swimming during winter. So
do yourself a favor and head to the South Shore if you want to take a dip
in the winter months (Dec–Mar).
Kalihiwai Beach
This secret North Shore beach is a favorite of local families, who come to
enjoy the wide and gorgeous white sands and the shallow brackish ponds
that remain safe for little ones to play in even when the ocean surf kicks
up. You actually get two beaches here: the main beach, which offers plenty
of sand for everybody to enjoy; and the second beach — actually the
shoreline of the Kalihiwai Stream (accessible via the Anini Beach Road

fork; see the upcoming directions) — from which you can wade across
freshwater shallows to the wide main beach “island” in the middle. (The
main beach is actually a wide sandbar separating the tranquil stream from
the ocean; the ocean and river meet at one very shallow end.)
I suggest using the first set of directions that I give below so that you don’t
have to wade across the stream to reach the beach. (The water is waist-
deep for most adults at its deepest point.) In the warm-weather seasons,
the surf is usually calm enough for swimming and easy wave jumping, and
the stream water is tranquil, shallow, and warm as a bathtub. Preschoolers
love to toddle in the extreme shallows, and bigger kids jump off the lava
rocks into the deep freshwater pool at the beach’s west end (to your left
as you face the waves). The shallows usually stay calm, but stay out of the
surf if it begins to kick up — and stay out altogether in winter. The beach
has no facilities. The crowd runs the gamut from local families to con-
struction workers on their lunch break, but it tends to be friendly and easy-
going across-the-board.
See map p. 462. Off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) past the turnoff for Kilauea. To get
there: As you head toward the North Shore, take the 1st exit called Kalihiwai Road,
near mile marker 24; follow it to the parking lot. Or follow the directions for Anini Beach
(see the next review); take a right at the Anini Beach Road fork (the sign says “Dead
End”), and then park at the makeshift lot just before the “No Trespassing” sign.
Anini Beach
Tucked away in a million-dollar residential neighborhood, this beach is
one of the most beautiful swimming beaches on Kauai. The 3-mile-long
gold-sand beach is shielded from the open ocean by the longest, widest
fringing reef in the islands. With shallow water less than 5 feet deep, it’s the
very best beach on Kauai for beginning snorkelers, and it boasts the most
well-protected North Shore waters in winter. The grassy park has picnic
and barbecue facilities, restrooms, and a boat-launch ramp.
See map p. 462. Off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) past the turnoff for Kilauea. To get
there: As you head toward the North Shore, ignore the 1st exit called Kalihiwai Road
(the turnoff for Kalihiwai Beach) and turn right at the 2nd exit (west of mile marker
25); at the fork, follow Anini Beach Road (left) to the beach park.
Hideaway Beach
Reaching this hidden gem may take a little work, but this beach is well
worth the effort. The perfectly named Hideaway Beach is a gorgeous
pocket of beach in the Princeville Resort where the snorkeling is great, the
sand is powder-fine, and the atmosphere is as tranquil as it gets. Even if a
few other souls find their way there, everyone is happily content to keep
to themselves. Fair warning: Getting to Hideaway is not for the faint of
heart. From the parking lot, walk down the dirt path that runs between the
two chain-link fences on the right; the path will take you to a steep stair-
case that leads down to the beach. It has no facilities, so bring what you
need. You shouldn’t visit this beach at night; the staircase is too tricky to
navigate and there are no lights.
Part VI: Kauai 
464

See map p. 462. In the Princeville Resort off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), just east
of Princeville Shopping Center. To get there: Go 2 miles to the entrance of the hotel;
just before the gatehouse, turn into the public parking lot on your right.
Hanalei Beach
Half-moon Hanalei Bay has to be one of the loveliest beaches on earth.
Gentle waves roll up the wide, golden sand; towering coco palms sway to
the rhythm of the trade winds; waterfalls vein volcanic ridges in the dis-
tance. It’s an excellent spot for swimming in summer; in winter, stick to the
westernmost curve of the bay, where the water usually stays calm even
when winter swells hit. Facilities include a pavilion, restrooms, picnic
tables, and parking. This beach is very popular, but the bay is big enough
for everyone to enjoy; you can usually find a spot to yourself just by
strolling down the shoreline.
See map p. 462. Off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), Hanalei. To get there: Turn right on
Aku Road (just after Tahiti Nui), which leads to Weke Road and the main parking lot.
Tunnels Beach
If I had to pick one beach above all others on Kauai, it just might be
Tunnels. Postcard-perfect, with swaying palms, a shelter of ironwoods, and
gold sand rimming a curving shore, Tunnels is one of the most beautiful
stretches of beach in all Hawaii. Go at sunset, when golden rays butter a
wide-open blue sky and bounce off the green steepled ridges. The sand
here is rougher and more pumice-textured than elsewhere (but somehow
all the more luxurious for it). The ironwoods provide welcome shade in
the heat of the tropical summer. Protected by a fringing coral reef, Tunnels
is excellent for swimming and snorkeling, but beware the winter waves, of
course. No facilities mar the pristine scene, so bring whatever supplies
you think you may need.
You must park on the dirt access road — if you park on the shoulder of
the main road, you will get a ticket. Heed the “No Parking Anytime” signs.
If no parking is available along the access road, go 1⁄3 mile down, park at
the Haena Beach Park, and walk back.
See map p. 462. Off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) beyond Hanalei, 1 mile past Hanalei
Colony Resort, down an unmarked drive. To get there: Turn right down the sandy
access road across the street from the green house; it’s just after the yellow “Narrow
Bridge” sign and the 2-story light green house. Park in the alley or along the highway
with everybody else, walk down the alley, and turn left at the “Beach Path” sign.
Kee Beach State Park
At the end of Kuhio Highway, Kee (kay-eh) is a real dandy of a beach — a
small crescent of golden-brown sand nestled between soaring volcanic
cliffs and an ironwood grove. This remote little spot isn’t quite as lovely as
Tunnels, but it comes close — and it boasts easier access and facilities.
It’s equally terrific for swimming and snorkeling (although a friend I
recently brought here — a bona fide city girl — despised the hippie vibe).
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 465

You’ll really feel as if you’re at the end of the world out here. A well-devel-
oped reef keeps the water shallow and calm, making the inlet great for kids
and snorkelers of all levels; nobody should venture out beyond the reef,
though. Facilities include some rustic restrooms, showers, and lots of park-
ing, but no lifeguard. Don’t be surprised if you see a substantial clutch of
Kauai’s infamous wild chickens pecking and cock-a-doodle-doing their way
around the parking lot.
Kee is where you pick up the trail head to the Na Pali Coast. It takes about
three hours to hike the first 2 miles in (that’s as far as I suggest you go)
and back, so the heartier among you may want to plan on it; see the sec-
tion “Exploring on Dry Land,” later in this chapter, for further details.
See map p. 462. At the end of Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), about 71⁄2 miles past
Hanalei.
In the Poipu area
To reach these beaches, take Maluhia Road (Highway 520) from the
Kaumualii Highway (Highway 50) toward Poipu Beach.
Poipu Beach Park
This big, wide beach park is the perfect beach playground: Grassy lawns
with leafy shade trees skirt abundant white sand at the water’s edge. It’s
actually a series of crescents, with the two most prominent ones divided
by a sandbar: On the left, a lava-rock jetty protects a sandy-bottom pool
that’s perfect for small kids; on the right, the open bay is great for more
advanced swimmers. The swimming is excellent, with small tide pools for
exploring and great reefs for snorkeling and diving. Amenities include lots
of top-notch facilities — including nice bathrooms, outdoor showers,
picnic pavilions, plenty of parking, and a good restaurant and snack bar
(Brennecke’s Beach Broiler; see Chapter 16) just across the street. Poipu
attracts a daily crowd of visitors and local residents (plus a mellow monk
seal who often beaches himself here to sunbathe), but the density seldom
approaches Waikiki levels, except on holidays.
See map p. 462. To get there: From Kaumualii Highway (Highway 50), turn south on
Maluhia Road and follow it to Poipu Road. Go past Poipu Shopping Village and turn
right on Hoowili Road, which will take you to the beach.
Lawai Beach (Beach House) Beach
This small, rocky, white-sand beach just to the west of the Beach House
Restaurant isn’t the most beautiful on the South Shore, but snorkelers will
love it. The water is warm, shallow, clear, and delightfully populated with
clouds of tropical fish. Plenty of streetside parking is available, plus some
nice restrooms and showers just across the street and a grassy lawn in
front of the Beach House.
See map p. 462. On Lawai Road next to the Beach House Restaurant, Poipu Beach.
To get there: From Kaumualii Highway (Highway 50), turn south on Maluhia Road
(Highway 520) and continue south on Poipu Road. At the “Welcome to Poipu Beach”
Part VI: Kauai 
466

sign, go to the right, toward Spouting Horn; it’s a mile or two down, across from the
Lawai Beach Resort (look for the restaurant on your left).
Mahaulepu Beach
Here is one of the finest stretches of untouched sands in Hawaii. With 2
miles of grainy, red-gold sand tucked among rocky cliffs, sand dunes, and
a forest of casuarina trees, this idyllic stretch is perfect for beachcomb-
ing, sunbathing, or just watching the endless waves roll in. Swimming and
snorkeling are risky, except in the reef-sheltered shallows about 200 yards
west of the sandy parking lot. No facilities are on-site — just lots of pris-
tine natural beauty. Best of all, you’re likely to have it all to yourselves,
except for a handful of locals who come here to kiteboard or let their dogs
romp in the surf. Mahaulepu makes a wonderful place to get away from it
all and discover Hawaii at its natural best.
See map p. 462. Off Poipu Road, 3 miles past the Hyatt Regency Kauai Resort and
Spa and 2 miles from the end of Poipu Road (the unpaved stretch is called Weliweli
Road). To get there: Turn right at the T intersection; stop and register at the security
hut, drive 1 mile to the big sand dune, turn left, and drive 1⁄2 mile to the small lot under
the trees.
On the western shore
If it’s raining everywhere else on Kauai, just get in your car and head
west. Keep going to the end of the road, and you’ll find a mini-Sahara
where the sun (almost) always shines.
Polihale State Beach Park
Polihale is a wonderful place to get away from it all. It holds Hawaii’s
biggest beach — 17 miles long and as wide as three football fields. The
golden sands wrap around Kauai’s northwestern shore from just beyond
Waimea all the way to the edge of the Na Pali Coast. Some of the stretches
of sand are accessible from the highway, but I like the remote area past
the cane fields best. The safest place to swim is Queen’s Pond, a small,
shallow, sandy-bottomed protected inlet that’s usually calm, except when
the high winter surf washes over the reef — stay out of the water alto-
gether then. Restrooms, showers, picnic tables, and pavilions are scat-
tered throughout the park, but no lifeguards are on hand.
Be careful at Polihale year-round because this is open ocean, and swim-
ming is dangerous. Strong swimmers can bodysurf with caution in summer,
but everybody should stay out of the water in winter. A few more tips:
Always wear flip-flops or reef shoes; the midday sand can be hotter than
a griddle. Don’t attempt to drive the unpaved cane road out to the beach
if recent rains have left the road muddy. It’s easy to get stuck, and this
beach is far from civilization.
See map p. 462. At the end of Kaumualii Highway (Highway 50), a 40-minute drive
west of Poipu. To get there: Drive past the Barking Sands Missile Range and follow
the signs through the sugar-cane fields to Polihale. The road isn’t paved, but it’s flat
and well graded, so just take it slow; it’s about a 5-mile drive. Queen’s Pond is at the
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 467

31⁄4-mile mark along the cane road, where the road curves near a large monkeypod
tree; take the fork to the left and park almost immediately and then walk north along
the beach until you come to a hollow in the rock; pass through it to the beach.
Playing in the surf
If you want to rent boogie boards, snorkel gear, kayaks, and other beach
toys, Kauai has a number of reliable outlets — all of which can book
organized activities for you, too.
My favorite place to rent snorkel gear is Snorkel Bob’s on the Coconut
Coast at 4–734 Kuhio Hwy. (on the ocean side of the street), Kapaa 
(% 808-823-9433); and at Poipu Beach at 3236 Poipu Rd., just south 
of Old Koloa Town (% 808-742-2206). The best-quality gear — the
“Ultimate Truth” — rents for $8 a day, or $32 a week ($22 per week for
kids) for the mask/snorkel/fins set. If you’re nearsighted, you can even
rent a prescription mask for $12 more, plus boogie boards, life vests, wet
suits, beach chairs, umbrellas, and so on. Budget travelers can rent
basic gear for just $9 per week. The people at Bob’s shop can also sign
you up for select activities — snorkel cruises, helicopter rides, bike
tours, and luau. Both shops are open every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. You
don’t need to reserve in advance, but advance bookings are available
over the phone at % 800-262-7725 or online at www.snorkelbob.com.
You can rent a set of snorkel gear from Snorkel Bob’s at the start of your
trip, carry it with you as you travel throughout the islands, and then
return it to another Snorkel Bob’s location on Oahu, Maui, or the Big
Island. (All shops offer 24-hour gear return service.) I suggest renting
equipment, even if you intend to go on snorkel cruises or kayak trips
that provide gear. Free gear is almost always awful — and I don’t want
you to miss out on spotting sea turtles and other groovy critters
because you’re fussing with a clogged snorkel or a leaking mask.
On the North Shore, rent your gear from the friendly folks at Kayak Kauai
Outbound, 5-5070 Kuhio Hwy., a mile past Hanalei Bridge on Highway 56
(look for them on the ocean side of the road, the third building on the
right as you enter Hanalei, across from Postcards Cafe) in Hanalei (% 800-
437-3507 or 808-826-9844; www.kayakkauai.com). Kayak Kauai rents
snorkel gear, body boards and surfboards, river and ocean kayaks, and
even camping and backpacking gear. (See the kayaking section later in this
chapter for details on their guided kayak trips.) There’s also a second
location on the Coconut Coast at 4-494 Kuhio Hwy., Kapaa.
Snorkeling
Kauai does offer a number of snorkel cruises, but unless you’re going to
combine snorkeling with a Na Pali sightseeing trip (see the following sec-
tion), I say save your money. Kauai is best known for its offshore snor-
keling, which anybody can do — it only requires that you have a small
amount of swimming ability and some good gear (see the preceding sec-
tion for rental locations).
Part VI: Kauai 
468

My absolute favorite offshore snorkeling in Hawaii is off Kauai’s North
Shore. Anini, Hideaway, Tunnels, and Kee beaches are all world-class,
boasting crystal-clear water and a mind-boggling abundance of colorful
fish.
Although placid throughout the summer months, most of Kauai’s North
Shore beaches become too rough for swimming during the winter. Anini
Beach is well-protected enough to stay calm year-round. Kee Beach is
the second-most reliable in terms of calm winter waves.
For little ones or first-time snorkelers, head to the Coconut Coast’s
Lydgate State Beach Park, where a lava-rock wall forms a natural pool
that stays calm even as the waters churn around it. The calm coves at
Poipu Beach Park make another excellent choice for beginners, whether
they’re 6 or 60. Of the North Shore beaches, Kee is the best protected.
Lawai Beach isn’t picture-postcard pretty, but it’s my favorite place to
snorkel in the Poipu area. You may even spot some little critters darting
in and out of detritus left by Hurricane Iniki, such as concrete blocks and
spare tires.
For details on all the beaches that I discuss here, see the section
“Combing the beaches,” earlier in this chapter.
Safety is key when snorkeling. See “Ocean Safety” in the Quick Concierge
at the end of this book for snorkeling tips.
Cruising the Na Pali Coast and 
other on-deck adventures
Hawaii’s most spectacular coastline is also its most isolated destination.
This network of verdant valleys and cliffs on Kauai’s northwest shoreline
composes an unspoiled tropical paradise that few get to experience,
thanks to its utter remoteness. You can see the glorious Na Pali Coast in
three ways: by helicopter tour (see “Taking a flightseeing tour,” later in
this chapter), by hiking in (see “Sightseeing with a guide,” later in this
chapter), or by catching a boat ride around the bend. I like the approach
from sea best; it’s simply breathtaking. Most cruises combine snorkeling
with sightseeing.
Kauai serves as an excellent vantage from which to see the Pacific
humpback whales make their annual visit to Hawaii from Alaska between
December and April. In season, most cruise operators combine whale-
watching with their regular adventures.
The water can be very choppy as you cruise the North Shore. Mornings
are usually calm, but the surf tends to kick up later in the day. Those of
you with sensitive tummies should take Dramamine or other motion-
sickness meds well before you set out on one of these expeditions —
when you’re out on the sea, it’s too late for the drugs to have any bene-
fit. Also available are nausea-prevention wristbands, which you can find
at any drugstore; they seem to benefit many users.
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 469

You may be able to save a few bucks on your Na Pali Coast or other cruise
by booking it through Maui-based Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 800-621-3601
or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com), which also books activities on
Kauai. Tom Barefoot is a very reliable activities center that’s willing to
split its commissions with you so that everybody comes out ahead. You’ll
save 7 to 15 percent on trips with select outfitters.
Capt. Andy’s Sailing Adventures
Capt. Andy runs the Spirit of Kauai, a late-model 55-foot, 49-passenger Gold
Coast catamaran, on a number of regular trips to the glorious Na Pali
Coast. The boat is sleek and comfy, excelling at both speed and stability,
and the staff is friendly, extremely knowledgeable about the Na Pali Coast,
and attentive. Choose from morning, afternoon, and full-day Na Pali Coast
trips, which include sailing, snorkeling, dolphin-watching, and usually
lunch; full-day expeditions even land on a remote beach when conditions
allow. You also have the option of a sunset cruise, which includes cock-
tails, to either Na Pali or Poipu. Call or check the Web site for the current
schedule because the Na Pali schedule is truncated in winter (but whale-
watching compensates).
Capt. Andy also offers Na Pali tours for small groups in 24-foot inflatable
rafts. These boats, which sit lower to the water, offer a fast, utterly thrilling
ride, and are small enough to explore sea caves. Snorkeling is included,
along with breakfast or lunch.
Most cruises depart from the Capt. Andy’s office at Port Allen Marina Center, 4353
Waialao Rd. (at Highway 50 halfway between Poipu and Waimea), Eleele. Poipu
sunset cruises depart from Kukuiula Harbor, Poipu Beach. % 800-535-0830 or
808-335-6833. www.capt-andys.com or www.napali.com/kauai_sailing.
Prices: Na Pali snorkel adventure $139–$159 adults, $99 kids ages 2–12; Na Pali
sunset dinner $105 adults, $80 kids ages 2–12; Poipu sunset sail $69 adults, $50 kids
ages 2–12; rafting trips $139–$159 adults, $99 kids ages 5–12. Note: No children under
age 5 on rafting trips, no kids under age 2 on sailing trips. Discounts available for
online booking.
Captain Sundown
Captain Sundown is the only operator whose cruises depart exclusively
from the North Shore, which is much closer to the Na Pali Coast. Its 40-
foot sailing catamaran carries only 15 passengers, so this cruise is an
excellent choice for those looking for an intimate trip. Options include
year-round Na Pali sails. From April through December, you have two
options: a six-hour morning tour that includes snorkeling, fishing, and a
deli lunch; or a three-hour afternoon sightseeing-only sunset tour. Whale-
watching is the raison d’être on the five-hour winter outing. All trips
include an exciting short paddle out to the boat in a Hawaiian Outrigger
canoe. This is a small family-owned and family-run business, and they’re
committed to making sure that you’re happy, well informed, and seeing
the best of Kauai. Reserve well in advance because these small-capacity
trips often book up a week or more ahead of time.
Part VI: Kauai 
470

Trips depart from Hanalei Beach, Hanalei. % 808-826-5585. www.captain
sundown.com. Prices: 6-hour sail with snorkeling $148–$162 adults, $128–$148 kids
7–12. No kids under age 7.
Liko Kauai Cruises
This Hawaiian-owned and -operated company offers four-hour combina-
tion Na Pali Coast/snorkel/dolphin-watching/cave tours, with lunch. It all
happens on a comfortable 49-foot twin-hulled catamaran (with padded
seating, a nice plus). In addition to seeing whales in season, you’ll peek
into sea caves and lush valleys, glimpse waterfalls and miles of white-sand
beaches, and make stops along the way for snorkeling. The narration is in-
depth, culturally as well as naturally oriented, and very good. Prices
include a deli-style lunch and sodas.
Cruises depart from Kehaka Small Boat Harbor, Waimea; check in at Obsessions
Café, 9875 Waimea Rd. (Highway 50, adjacent to the Big Save Market), Waimea. 
% 888-SEA-LIKO [732-5456] or 808-338-0333. www.liko-kauai.com. Prices: $140
adults, $95 kids 4–12.
Na Pali Explorer
This terrific local, family-owned tour operator offers Na Pali Coast tours
(plus whale-watching expeditions in season) aboard three of the most
exciting boats to cruise the Kauai coast: the 26-foot Explorer I, which holds
16 passengers; the 48-foot Explorer II, which carries up to 35 passengers;
and the 46-foot Ocean Adventurer, with a similar capacity. All are rigid
inflatable boats (RIBs), the kinds of rubber inflatables made famous by
Jacques Cousteau. These sleek vessels skim the surface of the water at up
to 35 knots, which means that they can reach the remote, rugged Na Pali
quickly, and can maneuver closer to the shore, and into hidden sea caves
that other vessels simply cannot reach. The smaller boat makes up for its
lack of amenities with an unparalleled thrill ride that is not for the faint of
heart. The larger boat tones down the thrills a bit in exchange for comfort
amenities like shaded seating, a toilet, and freshwater showers. Still, these
are not fancy boats; both emphasize experience over amenities. No matter
which cruise you select, count on an expert staff that’s knowledgeable,
friendly, and attentive. Prices include continental breakfast, a deli lunch,
and/or afternoon pupus, depending on the trip you choose.
Na Pali Explorer now operates some cruises aboard its Ocean Adventurer
out of Hanalei. If you’re interested in departing from the North Shore, call
for available dates.
Cruises depart from Kekiaola Harbor, Waimea. % 877-335-9909 or 808-338-9999.
www.napali-explorer.com. Prices: $89–$135 adults, $69–$95 kids 5–12.
Ocean and river kayaking
Kauai is an excellent place for kayaking. First-timers don’t have to brave
the open ocean — rather, they can paddle down the Huleia River into
Huleia National Wildlife Refuge, the last stand of Kauai’s endangered
birds (it’s the only way the nature refuge can be explored); cruise calmly
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 471

along the Wailua River, freshwater playground of Kauai’s ancient kings;
or follow the winding Hanalei River out to beautiful Hanalei Bay. More
skilled kayakers can set out for the majestic Na Pali Coast for some real
excitement. Here are the best outfitters:
 Kayak Kauai Outbound, 5-5070 Kuhio Hwy., a mile past the Hanalei
Bridge on Highway 56 (look for them on the ocean side of the road,
across from Postcards Cafe) in Hanalei (% 800-437-3507 or 808-
826-9844; www.kayakkauai.com), offers guided tours, or lessons
and equipment rentals if you want to set off on your own. Gentle
half-day river tours begin at $60 for adults, $45 for kids under age
12; extremely challenging full-day sea-kayak trips for adults run
$145 to $205. The shop has its own dock if you want to explore the
Hanalei River and Wildlife Refuge on your own.
Kayak Kauai Outbound also has a second location on the Coconut
Coast at 4-494 Kuhio Hwy., Kapaa, just a half-mile north of the Wailua
River adjacent to the Coconut Marketplace (% 800-437-3507), where
you can rent kayaks and gear for exploring the Wailua River Monday
to Saturday. Doubles are $75 for the day (no singles available). You
should reserve in advance.
 Outfitters Kauai, on the South Shore, at Poipu Plaza, 2827A Poipu
Rd., just before the turnoff to Spouting Horn (% 888-742-9887 or
808-742-9667; www.outfitterskauai.com), has its own full slate 
of guided kayaking trips. It offers sea tours for skilled kayakers
(including a challenging kayak trip along the Na Pali Coast in
summer; $198 per person; no kids under 15), as well as a guided
paddle along the Huleia and Wailua rivers for less experienced folks
($98 adults, $78 kids 5–14). Daily river kayak rentals are also avail-
able for $40 per person.
Outfitters Kauai has also expanded into kayak rentals along the lazy
Wailua River; Wailua Kayak & Canoe (% 808-821-1188) offers
double and single kayaks for rental from a convenient base-yard
near the mouth of the river. Call ahead and book your kayaks at
least a day in advance; they’re available twice daily for five-hour
rentals ($75 double, $45 single) at 7 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. From Kuhio
Highway, turn onto Kuamoo Road, across from Wailua Bay at the
entrance to the old Coco Palms resort, to reach the base-yard,
where you’ll be issued equipment and a kayak on a wheeled cart,
which you’ll pull by hand for the five-minute walk to the river. The
Wailua Kayak folks will offer you an easy-to-follow map and offer
basic paddling instructions, which is all you’ll need. It’s really a fun
and easy way to explore this tranquil paradise.
 Kayak Wailua (% 808-822-3388; www.kayakwailua.com) offers
well-priced rentals and guided river kayak tours from the Wailua
Marina. At $40 per person (plus a 15 percent guide gratuity) for a
41⁄2-hour guided tour, this is one of the best guided tour deals out
there. First-time kayakers are welcome, and all are welcome to
bring your own bag lunch (one of the ways they’re able to cut back
on the rate).

Catching a wave
If you’ve always wanted to surf the ocean waves, now’s your chance —
Poipu Beach is a great place to learn. Contact Margo Oberg Surf School
(% 808-332-6100 or 808-639-0708; www.surfonkauai.com), the domain
of seven-time world-champion surfer Margo Oberg. Margo’s accredited
instructors swear that they can get anybody up and riding a wave by the
end of a lesson. The price is $65 for the two-hour beginner group lesson,
including equipment; book at least a day in advance. Lessons are also
available for more advanced surfers.
If you already know the basics, you can rent a surfboard from the
Nukumoi Surf Co., across the street from Poipu Beach at Brennecke’s
Beach Center (% 888-384-8810 or 808-742-8019; www.nukumoisurf.com).
A two-hour group lesson is $75 per person, and a small class size — just
four students per class — means you’ll get plenty of attention. Nukumoi

Ziplining through the backcountry
Multifaceted backcountry adventure tours that culminate in a thrilling zipline ride
through the treetops have really taken off on the majestic Garden Isle. You have three
outfitters to choose from:
 Outfitters Kauai (% 888-742-9887 or 808-742-9667; www.outfitterskauai.
com) offers a very exciting everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of a trip that’s a
big hit among thrill-seeking visitors: the Kipu Falls Zipline Safari, which combines
kayaking, rope swinging, ranch hay-riding, jungle trekking, cruising on a motorized
canoe, and flying through the jungle treetops on a zipline into a six-hour adven-
ture. The tour costs $175 for adults, $135 for kids 14 and under. If you want to cut
right to the chase, consider the Kipu Falls Zipline Trek for three hours of rope
swinging, hiking, and ziplining; the cost is $125 adults, $99 for kids 7 to 14. No kids
under age 7.
 Kauai Backcountry Adventures (% 888-270-0555 or 808-245-2506; www.kauai
backcountry.com) offers exclusive access to over 17,000 scenic acres, a
former sugar plantation at the heart of the island, and they really make the most
of it. Kauai Backcountry’s 31⁄2-hour Zipline Adventure is all about the zipline — no
muss, no fuss. After a short four-wheel-drive transfer and a brief orientation, you’ll
zip down a series of seven ziplines to the valley floor below before ending your
adventure with a picnic lunch and a refreshing swim in a natural swimming pool.
A monumental thrill! The cost is $125 per person, and tours are offered daily at
9:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.; no kids under 12.
 You can also book guided jungle and Hanalei kayak adventures that include a
zipline ride as part of the fun with Princeville Ranch Adventures (% 888-955-7669

person, depending on the one you choose.

will take students as young as 9 years old (younger if parents participate
as well). Private lessons are also available. Nukumoi also rents boogie
boards.
If you want to learn to windsurf, reach out to Windsurf Kauai
(% 808-828-6838), which offers windsurfing lessons from Anini Beach,
an excellent — and beautiful — place to learn the basics, whether you’re 
6 or 60. A three-hour windsurf lesson is $75. You can book windsurf les-
sons a couple of days in advance. Private surf lessons from the North
Shore are also available but require further notice, and they depend on
conditions. On the North Shore, surfboards and boogie boards are avail-
able for rent at the Hanalei Surf Company, in the heart of Hanalei in the
Old Hanalei School Building at the Hanalei Center (directly across from
Zelo’s), 5–5161 Kuhio Hwy. (% 866-HANALEI or 808-826-9000; www.
hanaleisurf.com). To arrange for a surf lesson with Hanalei Surf’s own
surf champ and accredited coach Russell Lewis, call % 808-346-5710.
Hanalei Bay is the island’s most popular surf spot in winter, but it’s
strictly for experts — so stay out of the water when the waves are up
unless you really know what you’re doing.
Hooking the big one
You simply can’t find a better place in the world to sportfish than off 
the Big Island’s Kona Coast, often called the Sportfishing Capital of the
World — but if you’re not going to the Big Island, you don’t have to miss
out. Contact Hawaii Fishing Adventures and Charters (% 877-388-
1376; www.sportfishhawaii.com), which can book a first-class charter
for you on the Garden Isle. Prices range from $1,225 to $1,399 for a full-
day exclusive charter (your group of up to six gets the entire boat to
yourselves) down to as little as $149 for a share charter (you share the
boat with five other people).
I always book with Sportfish Hawaii first (% 877-388-1376 or 808-396-
2607; www.sportfishhawaii.com; see Chapter 11 for more info), but
you might also try Lahela Ocean Adventures (% 808-635-4020; www.
sport-fishing-kauai.com), which takes groups as large as 14 out
aboard the Lahela, a 34-foot Radon sport fisher, in search of marlin, ahi,
mahimahi, amberjack, and other sultans of the sea. Shared charters start
at $219 per angler, and the crew will filet one catch of up to 30 pounds
for you.
My favorite Na Pali cruise outfitter, Na Pali Explorer, now runs Explore
Kauai Sportfishing (% 877-335-9909 or 808-338-9999; www.napali-
explorer.com), offering sportfishing tours out of the south shore’s Port
Allen Boat Harbor aboard the Happy Times, its 41-foot convertible
Concorde Sportfisher. Prices are $135 per person for a four-hour tour,
$170 for six hours of sportfishing, and $230 for a full day (eight hours). 
A minimum of four and a maximum of six passengers are taken out per
trip.

For scuba divers (and those who want to be)
Diving on Kauai is dictated by the weather. In winter, when heavy swells
and high winds hit the island, diving is generally limited to the more pro-
tected South Shore. When the winter swells disappear and the easygoing
summer conditions move in, the magnificent North Shore opens up for
divers; there you’ll find a kaleidoscopic marine world that’s one of the
most diverse in Hawaiian waters. I recommend booking a two-tank dive
off a dive boat. Here are the best scuba charters:
 Bubbles Below Scuba Charters (% 866-524-6268 or 808-332-7333;
www.bubblesbelowkauai.com) specializes in highly personalized
small-group dives, with an emphasis on marine biology. It offers up
to two dives daily, plus one night dive, with most trips departing
from Port Allen Small Boat Harbor on the South Shore. The daytime
dives usually feature two locations, depending on conditions. The
night dive is particularly awesome, often featuring octopus and
other nocturnal sea creatures. Prices start at $135, with all equip-
ment and snacks. Instruction, from beginner to refresher courses,
is also offered.
 If you want to explore a wider range of dive sites — including those
off the north, east, and west shores — contact Dive Kauai Scuba
Center, 1038 Kuhio Hwy., Kapaa (% 800-828-3483 or 808-822-0452;
www.divekauai.com). In fact, it offers so many different dives that
you should call for options and prices, which range from $80 to
$315 for one- and two-tank shore and boat dives. Dive Kauai also
offers a “Discover Scuba” introductory program for $105 to $155, 
as well as a full slate of PADI (Professional Association of Diving
Instructors) certification and refresher courses.
 If you’ve never scuba-dived before but want to learn while you’re
on Kauai, Fathom Five Divers, 3450 Poipu Rd., Koloa (% 800-
972-3078 or 808-742-6991; www.fathomfive.com), is the company
to call. In business for more than 15 years, this PADI five-star IDC
facility offers charters for experienced divers and first-timers alike.
It offers no-experience-necessary introductory trips — both tank
boat and shore dives — for $140 to $195 per person, including
class, dives, and all gear. It also offers full-on four- or five-day certi-
fication courses, as well as a range of dives — two-tank boat, night,
and shore dives — for experienced divers at reasonable prices.
Exploring on Dry Land
The most enticing thing about Kauai is its natural beauty — so get in
your car and explore. Take Kuhio Highway up to the North Shore — my
favorite drive in all Hawaii — just surveying the beauty as you go. Stop
to take in the beautiful vistas along the way, have lunch and explore laid-
back Hanalei town, kick back at one of the fabulous beaches along this
shore (see “Enjoying the Sand and Surf,” earlier in this chapter), and
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 475

watch the sunset at the end of Kilauea Lighthouse Road (23 miles north
of Lihue, 7 miles east of Hanalei; turn off at the Menehune Mart). It’s the
best sightseeing you can do on Kauai.
Sightseeing with a guide
If you’re a movie buff — or if you just want a local to show you this gor-
geous island — call Hawaii Movie Tours (% 800-628-8432 or 808-
822-1192; www.hawaiimovietour.com), which offers the finest guided
sightseeing tour of Kauai, hands down. The $119 land tour ($109 for kids
11 and under) shows you more of Kauai in the course of a day (including
private areas and estates not open to the public) than you could take in
on your own if you toured the island yourself for a whole week. (The
four-wheel-drive tour, priced at $131 for adults, $121 for kids, takes you
to gorgeous private preserves where the company has exclusive rights.)
And the movie angle serves as great context — you’ll realize that you’ve
been seeing Kauai on the silver screen for years without knowing it.
Remember Blue Hawaii, Honeymoon in Vegas, Jurassic Park, and Fantasy
Island? Yep — all Kauai! (Even Lilo & Stitch — cartoon Kauai!) Kauai’s
latest starring appearance was in the Ben Stiller 2008 film Tropic
Thunder, where its verdant jungle doubles as Vietnam.
The movie tours sell out regularly, so call well in advance to book your
spots and avoid disappointment. (A month in advance isn’t too early in
the high season.) Also, do yourself a favor and schedule a Hawaii Movie
Tour for early in your trip. That way, you can go back to that hidden
beach or lush garden you fell in love with for some quality time on
another day. You can book tickets for specific dates right on the Web
site. (Check for Internet specials, which are sometimes offered.)
If you want a more general sightseeing tour of the island, or you don’t
want to drive yourself to destinations like Waimea Canyon or the North
Shore, contact Polynesian Adventure Tours (% 800-622-3011 or 808-
246-0122; www.polyad.com), which offers a range of guided tours in
minivans, big-windowed mini-coaches (good for small groups and big
views), and full-size buses. The only reason to go with these folks is if
you have no other way to get around; otherwise, they’re not going to
show you anything that you can’t show yourself without the high price
tag. In fact, they’ll show you less, because these tours are designed only
to give you an overview at each of the stops. You’ll have to go back on
your own if you want to really explore or take time to commune with
nature — which is why I suggest that you guide yourself around in the
first place. Prices run $58 to $80 for adults, $38 to $53 for kids ages 3 to 11,
depending on what tour you book; reserve your Polynesian Adventure
Tour online to get a 10 percent price break.
Taking a flightseeing tour
If you’re going to choose one island on which to take a flightseeing tour,
do it on Kauai. Kauai is the helicopter capital of Hawaii. So much of the
Garden Isle’s pristine natural world — hidden waterfalls, lush valleys,
Part VI: Kauai 
476

mist-shrouded peaks, the rugged interior of the thrilling Na Pali Coast,
the spectral hues of Waimea Canyon’s deepest ravines — is inaccessible
by any other means. Helicopter rides are expensive, but they’re worth
the splurge if you want to take home memories above and beyond those
of less adventuresome visitors. Most companies can even make a video-
tape of your ride for you to take home and relive again and again in the
comfort of your living room.
There are, however, some considerations. Although all the companies I
recommend feature skilled pilots and helicopters with excellent safety
records, the truth of the matter is that flightseeing is risky business.
Dozens of people have died in commercial helicopter crashes in Hawaii
over the past decade, including accidents that occurred on Kauai. Of
course, just getting into your rental car and driving to dinner — or even
getting into the shower in your condo with a renegade bar of soap — 
is many times more dangerous than catching a ’copter ride. Still, you
should make informed decisions when booking.
When reserving a helicopter tour with any company, check to make sure
that safety is its first concern. The company should be an FAA-certified
Part 135 operator, and the pilot should be Part 135 certified as well; the
135 license guarantees more stringent maintenance requirements and
pilot-training programs than those who are only Part 91 certified. And if
weather conditions look iffy, reschedule.
Be sure to book your flight in advance (at least a week before in high
season). All flights depart from Lihue Airport.
 Island Helicopters (% 800-829-5999 or 808-245-8588; www.island

Curt Lofstedt has more than 25,000 hours of flying under his belt,
and he personally selects and trains professional pilots with an eye
to both their flying skills and their ability to show you Kauai. All
flights are in either the four-passenger Bell Jet Ranger III or the six-
passenger American Eurocopter AStar, both with extra-large win-
dows, all forward-facing seats, and stereo headsets to hear the
pilot’s personal narration, which is strong on island culture and his-
tory. You’ll get a free preproduced video of the tour highlights, but
custom videos aren’t available. You can usually snag substantial
discounts by booking online via its Web site. There’s a $23 fuel sur-

surcharge; 90-minute tour: $385 per person, including $45 fuel sur-
charge): A Kauai pioneer, Jack personally started the sightseeing-
via-helicopter trend — so, needless to say, he knows this island
well. He flies four-passenger Bell Jet Rangers, which give everybody
a great forward view and lots of leg and shoulder room, plus win-
dows that open (great for the photographers among you), as well
as six-passenger Eurocopter AStars. Jack’s signature 90-minute tour

hovers over the sights a bit longer than the one-hour flight so you
can get a good look, but the 60-minute tour pretty much covers the
island without whizzing by the big attractions in a blur. If you’re a
shutterbug who’s counting on getting some good shots from above,
though, go with the longer flight. Be sure to check the Web site for
online discounts ($30 off the regular price for the hour-long tour,
$40 off the 90-minute tour at press time).

Sunshine offers a range of birds to choose from: The six-passenger
American Eurocopter AStar offers side-by-side seats (so nobody
sits backward and everybody gets a window seat), while the FX-
AStar offers more spacious seating with extra arm and leg room.
The pricier WhisperStars offer custom bubble windows for maxi-
mum views; the first-class WhisperStar offers extra arm and leg
room. At press time, online bookings made at least seven days in
advance garner you a 10 percent price break.
Exploring Kauai’s top attractions
For such a small, laid-back island, Kauai boasts a wealth of attractions
that are worth seeking out. The Allerton and McBryde Gardens and the
Kilauea Point Wildlife Refuge are my favorites of a fine bunch.
Allerton and McBryde Gardens
A former turn-of-the-twentieth-century private estate that’s been trans-
formed into a nationally chartered research facility for the study and con-
servation of tropical botanics, the 300-acre Allerton Garden is simply
amazing. It’s home to an extraordinary collection of tropical fruit and spice
trees, rare introduced and native Hawaiian plants, hundreds of varieties
of flowers, a marvelous palm collection, a series of Green Giant–size
Moreton Bay fig trees that were featured in Jurassic Park, and some prime
examples of landscape gardening featuring outdoor “rooms” and gravity-
fed fountains that would have turned William Randolph Hearst green with
envy. You can visit the garden only on a docent-led guided tour usually
offered four times a day Monday to Saturday and occasionally on Sunday;
it’s a fascinating, well-spent 21⁄2 hours for serious green thumbs and novices
alike (really — I loved it, and I can’t identify common houseplants), and
it’s well worth the price tag. The secret beach you’ll visit is alone worth the
trip — the view of it from above at the start of the tour was one of the most
awe-inspiring views that I’ve ever seen.
McBryde Garden is a gorgeous research garden that focuses on the con-
servation and cataloging of the plants of Hawaii and the Pacific. It’s home
to the largest collection of native Hawaiian plants in the world (many of
them rare and endangered) in a much more natural setting than what
you’ll see at Allerton. You can tour the well-signed McBryde Garden on a
1-mile self-guided walk daily; a tram will take you into the garden; allow
Part VI: Kauai 
478

about 11⁄2 hours. You also can tour for free a gorgeous native plant garden
located at the departure point.
Reservations are required for the guided tours through Allerton Garden;
they are not required for the self-guided McBryde tour. Reserve your tour
at least a week in advance, especially in the peak months of July, August,
and September. Wear comfortable walking shoes and long pants and bring
insect repellent (you’ll need it). I suggest starting with the Allerton tour
first and then coming back for a McBryde tour if you want more (which
you very well may). You may also want to consider visiting Limahuli
Garden, another National Tropical Botanical Garden on the North Shore
(see the listing later in this chapter).
See map p. 462. On Lawai Road (across the street from Spouting Horn), Poipu Beach.
% 808-742-2623. www.ntbg.org. Allerton Garden 21⁄2-hour guided tours: $40 adults,
$20 children 10–12 (no kids under age 10). Allerton tour times: Mon–Sat at 9 a.m., 
10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2 p.m.; call for Sun tour times, which are occasionally offered.
McBryde Garden 11⁄2-hour tram ride and self-guided tour: $20 adults, $10 kids 6–12

11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m., and 2:30 p.m.
Fern Grotto
One of Kauai’s oldest (“since 1947”) and most popular attractions is this
tacky-touristy trip filled with Hawaiian song and hula — but it’s a good bit
of fun nonetheless. Flat-bottomed boats take visitors up the Wailua River
to a natural amphitheater filled with ferns that’s the source of many
Hawaiian legends (and a popular site for weddings). Mark my words:
Within ten minutes of the launch, you’ll be on your feet doing the Hukilau
(Hawaii’s version of the Hokey Pokey) along with everybody else. The Fern
Grotto is lovely; but you’ll see more stunning natural beauty just by head-
ing to the North Shore, so you have to be in the mood for the cheeky
laughs as well as the ferns. Allow 11⁄2 hours for the round-trip.
See map p. 462. Wailua Marina, at the mouth of the Wailua River. To get there: Turn
off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) into Wailua Marine State Park. Smith’s Motor Boats:

daily at 9:30 a.m., 10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., 2 p.m., and 2:30 p.m.
Kauai Museum
The biggest and best museum on the neighbor islands is housed in an
attractive Greco-Roman–style building in downtown Lihue. If you’re inter-
ested in the history of Kauai and neighboring Niihau (or if you just have a
rainy day), it’s definitely worth a stop. Among the holdings is a wealth of
artifacts tracing the Garden Island’s history from the beginning of time
through contact — when Capt. James Cook “discovered” Kauai in 1778 —
and the present. A short video presentation sets the context for what you’ll
see. The main room houses well-curated rotating exhibitions; I saw a fas-
cinating photo exhibit documenting the reclamation of Kahoolawe, a
Hawaiian island used as a U.S. military bombing target until it was returned
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 479

to the Hawaiian people in the 1990s. You won’t need more than an hour to
see the entire museum — maybe 90 minutes if you’re really interested. The
gift shop is one of the island’s top stops for Kauai-made crafts. Guided
tours are offered Tuesday to Friday at 10:30 a.m. free with admission; reser-
vations are required for groups.
See map p. 462. 4428 Rice St. (across from the post office), Lihue. % 808-245-6931.

kids 6–12. Free admission for the whole family on the 1st Sat of the month. Open:
Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–4 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge
I just love this place. Sitting at the northernmost tip of the Hawaiian Islands
and jutting out 200 feet above the deep blue surf, this nationally protected
203-acre headland habitat is a magnet for magnificent seabirds and land
birds alike. Park your car, pay your entrance fee, and walk an easy 1⁄4 mile
to the rocky headland, whose only structure is the Kilauea Lighthouse,
serving as a beacon for ships arriving from Asian and South Pacific waters
since 1913. Year-round you can spot red-footed boobies, Kauai’s most vis-
ible seabird, which roost in the surrounding trees; the magnificent great
frigate bird, with 71⁄2-foot wings; and the endangered nene, or Hawaiian
goose, the state bird of Hawaii. Depending on the time of year, you might
also spot red- and white-tailed tropic birds; Laysan albatross, famous for
their elaborate courtship rituals; or wedgetailed shearwaters, which like
to winter at sea. Informative placards make identification easy, even for
novices. Look out to sea for spectacular views; if you get lucky, you might
also spot sea turtles, spinner dolphins, and Hawaiian monk seals in the
waters below. Call for the schedule of interpretive programs and guided
hikes. The refuge is well worth a half-hour of your North Shore time.
The wildlife refuge closes its gate at 4 p.m. daily, but don’t let that stop
you from parking along Kilauea Lighthouse Road to watch one of Hawaii’s
most magnificent sunsets. No doubt you’ll have company, both locals and
in-the-know visitors, as you look west to watch the sun sink into the hori-
zon beyond Hanalei Bay, brilliantly illuminating the luxuriant Bali Hai cliffs
with its warm orange rays in the process.
See map p. 462. At the end of Kilauea Lighthouse Road, 1 mile north of Kilauea. To
get there: From Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), turn right at the sign for Kilauea
Lighthouse (at Menehune Mart and gas station, 23 miles north of Lihue). % 808-
828-1413. Admission: $5. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Kokee State Park
Keep going upland and inland through Waimea Canyon, known as the
Grand Canyon of the Pacific (see the listing later in this section), all the
way to the top, where you’ll find a high-altitude treat: Kokee (ko-kay-eh)
State Park. It’s a whole different world up here at 4,000 feet: Kokee is a
cloud forest at the edge of an upland bog known as the Alakai Swamp,
where the breeze has a bite and trees look like the ones on the mainland.
Days are cool, wet, and mild, with intermittent bright sunshine — sort of
Part VI: Kauai 
480

like the Oregon Coast on a good day. The forest is full of beautiful native
plants and imports, like ohia, rare stands of koa, hibiscus, eucalyptus, and
redwoods. Pigs, goats, and black-tailed deer thrive in the forest, as do a
wealth of native birds.
Before you get out of the car, head 3 miles above Kokee Lodge to Kalalau
Lookout, the spectacular climax of your drive through Waimea Canyon and
Kokee. At the lookout, you’ll enjoy a spectacular view into an otherwise-
hidden Na Pali valley that’s untouched by the spoils of civilization; the
panoramic view is simply breathtaking. Wonderful birds reside at the look-
out, which offer reason enough to come; a family of cardinals greeted me
the last time I was here.
From Kalalau Lookout, head back down to the park itself. Before you
explore, stop at the Kokee Natural History Museum, where a colorful
clutch of chickens populates the parking lot. This small, vital museum is
the place to learn about the forest and bog before you see it. If you want a
bite to eat, Kokee Lodge is open for continental breakfast and lunch right
next door. After your museum visit, pick up the nature trail that starts
behind the building at the rare Hawaiian koa tree. (You’ll see lots of expen-
sive gifts, such as boxes and bowls, made out of this gorgeous wood in
shops throughout the islands.) The easy, self-guided walk is your best
introduction to this rain forest, and it’s great for those who’d rather not
take on a tougher trail. The less than 1⁄4-mile walk takes about 20 minutes
if you stop and look at all the plants that are identified along the way.
Here are a few tips to keep in mind when preparing for a visit to Kokee:
 No matter how hot and dry it is down at the beach, bring a jacket
with you up to Kokee, because it gets cold at 4,000 feet. Average
daytime temperatures range from 45°F in January to 68°F in July; 
on my last visit, it was 55°F up here while it was 80°F down on 
the coast. Also bring rain gear and an umbrella if you have it —
especially if you’re visiting between October and May — because
the annual rainfall up here is 70 inches. You can call the museum 
to check current conditions.
 Wear good shoes, because it can be damp and muddy — hiking
boots are preferable (if you don’t have them, sneakers will do).
 The best time to visit Kokee is early in the morning. That’s when
you have the best chance of seeing the panoramic view of Kalalau
Valley from the lookout, before clouds obscure the valley and
peaks. Early morning is also the best time to spot native birds.
 If you’re going to hike, check trail conditions (posted on a bulletin
board at the museum) before you set out. Pick up a free trail map at
the museum, which will allow you to pick the trail length and chal-
lenge that is right for you. Stay on established trails, because it’s
easy to get lost here. Get off the trail well before dark. Carry water
and rain gear and wear sunscreen.
See map p. 462. At the end of Kokee Road, 16 miles north of Waimea; from Kaumualii
Highway (Highway 50), turn north on Highway 550, Waimea Canyon Drive, which
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 481

eventually becomes Kokee Road. % 808-335-9975 or 808-335-8405. www.kokee.
org. Admission: Free! Open: Daily 24 hours; museum daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Guided Kokee Park Wonder Walks are offered daily during the summer
season, depending on weather conditions. Most hikes leave from the
museum at 12:15 p.m. Trail choice depends on weather. Reserve ahead,
as space is limited, and bring light rain gear, good walking shoes, bottled
water, and sunscreen.
Limahuli Garden
If you’ve already visited the gorgeous Allerton Garden on the South Shore
(see the listing earlier in this section) and you want more botanical expe-
riences, head to this North Shore branch of the National Tropical Botanical
Garden, where you’ll find 17 lush, Eden-like acres featuring lava-rock ter-
races of taro and other native and introduced species. This small, almost-
secret garden is ecotourism at its best. You’re welcome to explore the
garden on your own along a 3⁄4-mile loop (be prepared — it’s steep in some
areas), which takes about 11⁄2 hours. Or you can schedule a 21⁄2-hour guided
tour if you want botanical insight into what you’re seeing. Wear comfort-
able walking shoes; umbrellas are available for your use in case it rains.
See map p. 462. Near the north end of Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), 1⁄4 mile before
Kee Beach (look to your left, toward the mountain), Haena. % 808-826-1053. www.
ntbg.org. Reservations required for guided tours. Admission: $15 adults, free for
kids 12 and under. Guided tour: $25 adults, $15 kids 13–18, free for kids 12 and under.
Open: Tues–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4 p.m.; guided tour Tues–Sat at 10 a.m.
Na Pali Coast State Wilderness Park
Na Pali Coast State Wilderness Park is the most spectacular place in the
Hawaiian Islands. This 22-mile stretch of green-velvet fluted cliffs wraps
around the northwest shore of Kauai. Seven valleys crease the soaring
cliffs; hidden within are waterfalls, remote beaches, and other wonders of
nature that are too beautiful to be real — and more than difficult to reach.
You can see it one of three ways: on a commercial cruise for a from-the-
sea perspective (see “Cruising the Na Pali Coast and other on-deck adven-
tures,” earlier in this chapter); via a helicopter ride for an on-high view
(see “Taking a flightseeing tour,” earlier in this chapter); or by trekking in
on your own two feet from the end of the road on the North Shore (park
at the lot at Kee Beach; you’ll see the trail head on the north side of the
road, marked by a large sign). If you reach the 2-mile mark and you want
to go farther, you must have a permit (permits are $10 per night and are
issued in person at the Kauai State Parks Office, 3060 Eiwa St., Room 306,
Lihue; % 808-274-3444; www.hawaiistateparks.org/parks/kauai).
The total length of the trail is 11 miles, and it’s a serious challenge. Visit the
park’s Web site for details and advice before you consider a trip longer
than the 2-mile segment I describe.
Without a permit, you can also hike another 2 miles inland from the beach
to Hanakapiai Falls, a 120-foot cascade. This part of the trail is more 
Part VI: Kauai 
482

difficult, however, and it shouldn’t be tackled if it’s muddy. (I saw people
coming out who had been literally knee-deep in mud.) Allow another three
hours round-trip to the falls.
If you’re planning to hike the Kalalau Trail, keep these tips in mind as you
plan your adventure:
 Wear good, supportive shoes (tennis shoes or hiking boots).
 Don’t attempt even the first half-mile if the trail is too muddy.
 If you’re going any farther than the first half-mile, bring plenty of
water, plus a hat and sunscreen; snacks and insect repellent are a
good idea, too.
 Use the porta-potties at the parking lot before you hit the trail,
because you’ll find no facilities along it.
 If you get as far as Hanakapiai Beach, try to resist taking a dip,
because currents are strong year-round and drownings occur here
regularly. Don’t even think about entering the water in winter.

Sleeping Giant
If you squint your eyes as you drive down Kuhio Highway past the 1,241-foot-
high Nounou Ridge, which forms a dramatic backdrop to the Coconut Coast
towns of Wailua and Waipouli, you just may see the fabled Sleeping Giant. At
the 7-mile marker, look toward the mountain. It’s easy to spot: The geologic
giant lies on his back, with his head pointing north and slightly east, his feet
south and slightly west, and he’s got his great mouth open in a mammoth
yawn. As island legend goes, he’s a giant named Puni who fell asleep after a
great feast, but he reminds me of Gulliver and the Lilliputians. You’re wel-
come to climb the big guy if you like; the Sleeping Giant Trail offers an easy-
to-moderate family hike to a fabulous panoramic view. From the parking lot,
posted signs lead you over the 13⁄4-mile trail, which ends at a picnic table and
shelter. Wear sunscreen and bring water — and a picnic, if you like.
See map p. 462. Trail head on Haleilio Road, off Kuhio Highway (Highway 56) between
Wailua and Kapaa. To get there: At the Kinipopo Shopping Village traffic light (there’s
also a Shell Station here), turn toward the mountain off Kuhio Highway and follow
Haleilio Road for just over a mile to the parking area at telephone pole no. 38; look for
sign at trail head that says “NouNou Mt. Trail E.”
Spouting Horn
Sort of like an ocean version of Yellowstone’s Old Faithful, this puhi — blow-
hole — is quite a natural phenomenon. Big waves hit Kauai’s South Shore
with enough force on a constant basis to propel a spout of funneled salt
water skyward like a dramatic natural fountain, 10 feet or more in the air. An
additional hole blows air that makes a loud moaning sound, ascribed by
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 483

Hawaiian legend to a giant female lizard, Mo’o, who once guarded this coast-
line, gobbling up any intruders that came along. Along came Liko, who
wanted to fish in this area, and Mo’o rushed out to eat him. Quickly, Liko
threw a spear right into the giant lizard’s mouth, who then chased Liko into
a lava tube. Liko escaped, but legend says Mo’o is still in the tube; the moan-
ing sound, they say, is her cry for help (or her toothache, I’d say). You can
stop by for a few minutes to admire Spouting Horn or bring a picnic and
enjoy the view as you munch; the grassy little oceanfront park features
picnic tables and restrooms. This spot is a popular hangout with Kauai’s wild
chickens, who apparently can’t read the posted “No Animals Allowed” sign.
See map p. 462. On Lawai Road, Poipu Beach. To get there: From Kaumualii Highway
(Highway 50), turn south on Maluhia Road (Highway 520) and continue south on Poipu
Road. At the “Welcome to Poipu Beach” sign, go to the right; after you pass Prince
Kuhio Park, Spouting Horn Park will be on your left (across from the entrance to the
National Tropical Botanical Garden).
Waimea Canyon State Park
The great gaping gulch that Mark Twain dubbed the “Grand Canyon of the
Pacific” is quite a sight — no other island offers anything like it. The nick-
name is apt, for the valley and its reddish lava beds remind everyone who
sees it of Arizona’s Grand Canyon. Kauai’s version is bursting with ever-
changing color, just like its namesake, but it’s much smaller — only a mile
wide, 3,567 feet deep, and 12 miles long. You can stop to take in the view
(a great stop on your way to Kokee State Park; see earlier in this chapter),
hike down, and swoop through in a helicopter. (See the section “Taking a
flightseeing tour,” earlier in this chapter.) As you climb north — and up in
elevation — the first good vantage point that you’ll reach is Waimea
Canyon Lookout, located between the 10- and 11-mile markers on Waimea
Canyon Road. Take a peek; you’ll see why the canyon got its nickname. A
few more lookout points dot the route, each offering spectacular views;
Puu Hina Hina Lookout, located between the 13- and 14-mile markers at
3,336 feet in elevation, is a particular jewel.
If you want to hike in, your best bet is the Canyon Trail, which leads to the
east rim for a breathtaking view into the canyon. Park your car at the top
of Halemanu Valley Road, located between the 14- and 15-mile markers on
Waimea Canyon Road, about a mile down from the Kokee Natural History
Museum. Walk down the not-very-clearly marked trail on the 31⁄2-mile round-
trip, which takes about two to three hours and leads to Waipoo Falls and
back. I suggest going in the afternoon — following your visit to Kokee is
best — when the late afternoon light illuminates the canyon magnificently.
Another terrific hiking choice is the Kukui Trail, which you can follow for a
steep but rewarding 21⁄2-mile journey to the bottom of Waimea Canyon.
You’ll traverse about 2,300 feet in elevation each way, so make sure you’re
in shape to handle it. The trail head is on the right side of the road, about
halfway up Highway 550; if you reach Kokee State Park, you’ve gone too far.
See map p. 462. About 11 miles north of Waimea; turn north from Kaumualii Highway
(Highway 50) onto Waimea Canyon Drive (Highway 550). www.hawaiistate

Outfitters Kauai (% 888-742-9887 or 808-742-9667; www.outfitters
kauai.com) offers a guided bike ride down the slopes of Waimea Canyon
for adventure-seeking travelers. It’s an exciting road bike ride that trav-
erses 12 miles from the rim of the canyon down the paved road to the
shoreline. The ride takes about 41⁄2 hours, and morning and afternoon
ride are offered. The cost is $98 for adults, $78 for kids ages 12 to 14; no
kids under 12, please. Call for reservations.
Hitting the links
Always book your tee times well in advance — before you leave home,
preferably — especially in high season.
Be sure to ask about afternoon and twilight rates, which can save you a
bundle. Some courses also offer discounted rates to select hotels and
condos; check with your concierge or call the course directly to inquire.
And for discounted tee times, check out the deals available through Tee
Times Hawaii.com (% 888-675-GOLF or 866-927-1453; www.teetimes
hawaii.com).
Kauai Lagoons Golf Club
Kauai Lagoons often appears on lists of top resort courses in the United
States; in 2000, Golf Digest awarded Kauai Lagoons its gold medal, calling
the Kiele Course “one of the four finest courses in the country.” The Jack
Nicklaus–designed course is excellent, offering an exciting blend of tour-
nament-quality challenge and high-traffic playability — perfect for low
handicappers. The Kiele winds up with one of Hawaii’s most difficult — and
rewarding — holes, a 431-yard, par-4 played straightaway to an island green
surrounded by water; but the signature is the par-4, 330-yard 16th, a short
but demanding ocean-cliff shot whose green isn’t even visible from the tee.
(The trick is to hit your tee shot toward the coconut trees on the right side
of the fairway.) Currently under renovation, the course will emerge even
better than ever by the time you arrive. This is one of the largest practice
facilities in the islands; facilities include a driving range, lockers, showers,
restaurant, snack bar, pro shop, practice greens, golf clubhouse, and golf
club and shoe rental. Duffers looking to work on their game can arrange for
individual instruction or sign up for one of the daily clinics.
3351 Hoolaulea Way (off Rice Street), Lihue (turn at the sign for the Kauai Marriott
Resort and Beach Club). % 800-634-6400 or 808-241-6000. www.kauailagoons
golf.com. Greens fees: $175, twilight rates $125 after noon. Ask about discounts
for guests of select hotels; also, check current greens fees, which may increase fol-
lowing course renovation.
Kiahuna Golf Club
This par-70, 6,925-yard Robert Trent Jones, Jr.–designed course is a real
only-in-Hawaii gem, awarded four stars by Golf Digest. A recent renovation
has left it looking better than ever, with a fresh set of championship 
tees to a par 70. The challenging layout plays skillfully around four large
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 485

archaeological sites, ranging from an ancient Hawaiian temple to the
remains of a Portuguese home and crypt built in the early 1800s. The
Scottish-style links course has rolling terrain, undulating greens, sand
bunkers galore, near-constant winds, a swath of rainbow-colored vegeta-
tion, and terrific ocean and island views. A good mix of locals and visitors
man the tees. Facilities include a driving range and practice greens, and a
good breakfast-and-lunch restaurant, Joe’s on the Green.
2545 Kiahuna Plantation Dr. (at Poipu Road), Poipu Beach. % 808-742-9595. www.

at press time, $65 after 3 p.m.).
Poipu Bay Golf Course
Home to the PGA’s Grand Slam of Golf from 1994 to 2006, this 6,959-yard,
par-72 oceanfront links-style course designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., is
already a favorite among avid golfers — including, no doubt, Tiger Woods,
who has won numerous Grand Slams here. Golf Digest named the course one
of the top ten in all of Hawaii. Fairways and greens are undulating, and water
hazards are located on eight holes; the prevailing trade winds add an extra
challenge. The champs play this rugged beauty, often referred to as “the
Pebble Beach of the South Pacific,” like a British Isles links course — smart
and low. Facilities include an excellent pro shop, plus a restaurant, driving
range, and putting greens, plus private lessons and daily clinics.

Princeville Resort Golf Courses
Nestled in the glorious environs of Kauai’s North Shore, these two much-
heralded Robert Trent Jones, Jr., designs are the real stars of the Kauai
show. One of the most breathtaking — and toughest — golf courses in all
Hawaii, the Prince sits on 390 acres carefully sculpted to offer ocean views
from every hole. Golfers in the know often name it the best layout in the
state, and Golf Digest lauded it as the number-one course in Hawaii. Some
holes have a waterfall backdrop to the greens, others shoot into the hill-
side, and the famous par-3 7th requires that you tee off over a stunning
wide-mouthed gorge — dead against the wind, no less. Needless to say,
accuracy is key here; if you miss the fairway, chances are good that your
ball’s in the drink. The Makai is more forgiving, but don’t kick back just
yet. It’s actually three 9-hole courses in one — the Ocean, the Woods, and
the Lakes — with the Lakes being the most spectacular and the Ocean
being the most thrilling, thanks to a 7th hole that requires you to shoot
from one ocean promontory to the other, with the blue Pacific roiling
below. Facilities include a health club and spa, restaurant and bar, club-
house, golf shop, and driving range.
Contact the resort for information about value-priced three- and seven-
round packages.

Horseback riding
There’s no better way to admire Kauai’s remarkable natural scenery
than from high in the saddle. In the Poipu area, CJM Country Stables
(% 808-742-6096; www.cjmstables.com) offers a number of guided 
2- to 31⁄2-hour rides along the beach, some of which work in a break for 
a swim and a picnic. Prices run $98 to $125 per person, and all levels of
riders are accepted.
Personally, I think that the spectacular North Shore makes even better
quarter-horse stomping grounds. Princeville Ranch Horseback
Adventures (% 808-826-7777; www.princevilleranch.com) can 
take you out on a whole host of guided rides, from a casual yet magical
three- or four-hour waterfall picnic ride ($125–$135) to two- to three-
hour private rides ($140–$185 per person). There’s also a panoramic 
90-minute ride along ocean bluffs ($80) and a chance to participate in 
a full-on 90-minute paniolo cattle drive ($135).
Always book horseback adventures with plenty of advance notice —
before you leave home is best — and inquire about age, height, weight,
and other restrictions.
Getting pampered at the spa
The 25,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art Anara Spa at the Grand Hyatt
Kauai Resort & Spa, 1571 Poipu Rd., Poipu Beach (% 808-742-1234;
www.kauai-hyatt.com), is Kauai’s finest spa, and one of the best in all
Hawaii. “Anara” is an acronym for “A New Age Restorative Approach,”
which sets the tone for Anara’s touchy-feely, homeopathic-minded mis-
sion — and God bless ’em for it. This phenomenal indoor-outdoor facil-
ity — a lush paradise of fragrant gardens, open-air treatment rooms,
lava-rock showers, and therapists with the magic island touch — is the
perfect place to spend the day. The spa’s masterminds know it, which is
why they designed a full slate of spa packages that run anywhere from
11⁄2 hours to a complete day of head-to-toe pampering. You’ll spend an
arm and a leg here, but it’s worth every penny. Stand-alone services are
available as well. This place is always booked, so reserve well ahead.
On the North Shore, Princeville Health Club & Spa (% 800-826-1105;
www.princeville.com/spa.html) isn’t quite so extensive, mission-ori-
ented, or eye-catching, but its facilities are comfortable, its spa menu is
appropriately lengthy, and its technicians are first-rate. (I enjoyed a sub-
lime Aveda facial here on my last visit.) Prices are a bit lower, too.
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 487

Shopping the Local Stores
The Garden Isle isn’t exactly what you’d call a shopper’s destination, so
don’t come expecting to give your credit card an aerobic workout. That
said, a few hidden gems make the Garden Isle sparkle, especially for
those in search of gifts with a Hawaiian flair.
In Lihue
One of the best resources for Kauai-made crafts and gifts is the Edith
King Wilcox Museum Gift Shop at the Kauai Museum, across from the
post office at 4428 Rice St., downtown Lihue (% 808-245-6931; www.
kauaimuseum.org). In addition to astonishing native-wood bowls that
have been carved and polished to a high sheen, the shop boasts a nice
collection of budget-friendly koa gifts like barrettes, bracelets, and key
rings, all made from the gorgeous native wood. The little shop also has a
good selection of books, lauhala bags, coconut products, and more. You
can reach the shop only through the museum entrance, but the door
attendant will let you in for free if you want to skip the permanent collec-
tion and head straight for the salable stuff. Hours are Monday to Friday 
9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Kauai outpost of Hilo Hattie, Hawaii’s biggest name in aloha wear, is
at 3-3252 Kuhio Hwy., at Ahukini Road (the turnoff for the airport; % 808-
245-3404; www.hilohattie.com). Geared to the tourist market, Hilo
Hattie carries inexpensive, colorful wear that has substantially improved
in quality and style in recent years. It’s right by the airport, so this is a
good spot to stock up on last-minute gifts before you head home.
On the Coconut Coast
My favorite shopping stop on Kauai is the Kapa’a Stitchery, on Kuhio
Highway just north of Lihue town (% 808-245-2281). This friendly shop
specializes in locally hand-sewn goods, from aloha shirts to tropical-print
napkins to handbags to boldly patterned, beautifully made Hawaiian
quilts. For do-it-yourselfers, gorgeous island- and Asian-print fabrics are
sold, off the bolt, as are quilting materials and kits.
Kuhio Highway is dotted with mini-malls boasting practical stops and
familiar shops, from Safeway to the Sunglass Hut. Most prominent is the
Coconut Marketplace, 484 Kuhio Hwy., between the Wailua River and
Kapaa (% 808-822-3641; www.coconutmarketplace.com). This open-
air mall features a largely unimpressive collection of 60 or so shops,
mostly of the gift variety. Highlights include Ship Store Galleries
(www.shipstoregalleries.com), which features a compelling collec-
tion of 19th-century nautical antiques among the contemporary art;
Elephant Walk for quality Hawaii-themed gifts; Sole Mates (www.sole
mates808.com), specializing in such terrific comfort shoe brands as
Keen, Teva, and others ideal for the outdoor island lifestyle; the
Hawaiian Music Store (www.hawaiianmusicstore.com) for an excel-
lent selection of island-inspired tunes; and Kauai’s own Lappert’s Ice
Part VI: Kauai 
488

Cream, a must-stop for ice-cream lovers. There’s a free hula show at
center stage each Wednesday at 5 p.m., as well as a farmers’ market
every Saturday from noon to 4 p.m.
One of my favorite shopping stops in all Hawaii is Bambulei, 4-369D
Kuhio Hwy., Wailua (% 808-823-8641; www.bambulei.com), which takes
a little effort to find — but stick with it, especially if you’re a retro buff,
because you’re bound to come away with a prize. It’s on the inland side
of Kuhio Highway just south of the Coconut Marketplace, behind the
green storefront across from Kintaro Restaurant. Watch for the multicol-
ored sign just past the Wailua intersection (where Sizzler is). Little
Bambulei is home to a charmingly displayed collection of vintage Hawaii
and Asian collectibles, from salt-and-pepper shakers and ’50s fiberglass-
shade lamps to aloha shirts and vintage bamboo furniture, plus a small
but elegant selection of new aloha wear. It’s a real joy to browse. Next
door is Caffè Coco, an equally appealing spot for a light snack or a full
meal (see Chapter 16).
Boasting an eclectic blend of old-time retailers and newer fashion bou-
tiques, sweet old Kapaa town has really blossomed as a boutique row of
late. All you need to do is park along Kuhio Highway and stroll the plan-
tation-style storefronts along the few blocks, and you’re sure to come
away with an island treasure. Vicky’s Fabrics, 4-1326 Kuhio Hwy. (%
808-822-1746; www.vickysfabrics.com), boasts Hawaii’s best collec-
tion of on-the-bolt fabrics. Jim Saylor Jewelers, 4-1318 Kuhio Hwy. (%
808-822-3591), specializes in elegant custom jewelry designs and fine
gems. Hula Girl, at 4-1340 Kuhio Hwy. (% 808-822-1950; www.welove
hulagirl.com), specializes in the most stylish lines of aloha wear for
men, women, and kids. Nearby at 4-1322 Kuhio Hwy. is Davison Arts (%
808-821-8022; www.davisonarts.com), for handcrafted island wood fur-
niture as well as paintings and sculpture by local artists. South China
Sea Trading Company, 4-1354 Kuhio Hwy. (% 808-823-8655;
www.sochinasea.com), specializes in fun Asian imports.
On the North Shore
The simple town of Kilauea is home to the North Shore’s premier shop-
ping stop: Kong Lung Company, a gorgeous shopping collective housed
in a historic stone building on Kilauea Road and Keneke Street, a few
blocks from Kuhio Highway (% 808-828-1822; www.konglung.com).
This airy Asian-accented gallery of design brims with beautiful home
wares and gifts from Hawaii and around the world, all artfully displayed.
The collections of women’s wear and aloha shirts in back are the height
of casual island fashion. The shop is expensive, but not overpriced; this
is beautiful stuff. Out back is the Lotus Gallery of Fine Art (% 808-
828-9898; www.jewelofthelotus.com), a Pan-Asian gallery (with an
emphasis on works from India, Nepal, and Tibet) that’s something of 
an oddball but nonetheless boasts some incredible gold and talismanic
jewelry as well as antique artifacts and carpets. To reach Kilauea from
Kuhio Highway (Highway 56), turn right at the sign for Kilauea
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 489

Lighthouse (at the gas station, 23 miles north of Lihue); a few blocks
down on your right is Keneke Street and Kong Lung.
Hanalei boasts more great shopping. Two of the town’s finest shops are
at the entrance to Hanalei town, on the ocean side of Kuhio Highway just
after the bridge and Kayak Kauai Outbound: Ola’s (% 808-826-6937), a
top stop for high-quality island crafts, including a gorgeous collection of
jewelry and koa pieces; and Quicksilver Kai Kane (% 808-826-5594),
which is great for hip aloha and surf wear. (Its groovy collection of surf-
boards alone is worth a peek.)
In the heart of Hanalei on the ocean side of the street, Ching Young
Village covers the basics, from supermarket to pizza joint. Unrepentant
shoppers should instead head across the street to Hanalei Center, which
boasts a small but satisfying collection of boutiques. The standout is the
Yellowfish Trading Company (% 808-826-1227), which features an eye-
popping assemblage of vintage and contemporary Hawaiiana and gifts
with wide-ranging appeal (read: you don’t have to be a retro nut to love
this place), plus vintage bark-cloth fabrics, in case you want to give your
home that tropical touch. The Hanalei Surf Company, in the old school
building at the Hanalei Center (% 808-826-9000; www.hanaleisurf.com),
is the place to go for surf gear and beach goodies.
In the Poipu Beach area
Poipu has few notable shopping opportunities. On your way to Poipu
Beach, you’ll pass Old Koloa Town, a block-long collection of less-than-
exciting storefronts. The standout exception is Sheldon Gate Jewelry
Designs, 5330 Koloa Rd. (% 808-742-6591; www.sheldongate.com), for
remarkable modern jewelry designs, including luminous glass bracelets.
Boutique lovers can find a good mix of sportswear, sandals, and the 
like at Poipu Shopping Village, 2360 Kiahuna Plantation Dr. (at Poipu
Road). Don’t miss the standout Honolua Surf Co. (% 808-742-9152;
www.honoluasurf.com), a Maui-based company that makes terrific
quality casual wear whose appeal reaches well beyond the surf crowd.
My favorite stop for Hawaii-made crafts — even more so than the Kauai
Museum Shop — is the visitor center at the National Tropical Botanical
Garden, on Lawai Road across the street from Spouting Horn (% 808-
742-2433 or 808-742-2623; www.ntbg.org), where the simply displayed
collection is small but high quality. The emphasis is on affordable items
such as koa accessories, lauhala hatboxes, botanical prints, and Hawaii-
made paper goods, although a few excellent examples of koa calabashes
and jewelry boxes are always on display.
Southwest Kauai: Hanapepe
In a bend in the road a few minutes west of Kalaheo (turn off the highway
at the sign that says “Hanapepe, Kauai’s Biggest Little Town”) is Hanapepe.
This one-horse town is finally beginning to realize its years-long potential
as an arts community, with an increasing number of interesting galleries
Part VI: Kauai 
490

popping up along its main street, Hanapepe Road. Hanapepe particularly
comes alive on its weekly Friday-night art walk. But feel free to stop by 
any day of the week to enjoy such shopping and gallery gems as Vintage
Aloha, 3900 Hanapepe Rd. (% 808-335-5797; www.vintagealoha
gallery.com), for vintage-style original art reminiscent of the romantic
Matson Line era by local artist Melinda Morey; Banana Patch Studio,
3865 Hanapepe Rd. (% 800-914-5944 or 808-335-5944; www.bananapatch
studio.com), for affordable gifts and island-inspired original art by gallery
owner Joanna Carolan and other local artists; and others. A real find for
lovers of local art and off-the-beaten-path experiences.
Living It Up after Dark
Things really couldn’t get much quieter than they already are on Kauai.
This island is made for daytime fun — so my advice is to make sunset
the highlight, enjoy a leisurely dinner, and call it a night.
If you want a bit more action, Poipu Beach is your best bet. Of course,
for the most animated after-dark entertainment, head to — you guessed
it — a luau. Kauai has some good options (and one excellent one) that
increase the appeal of just-okay food with an open bar and surprisingly
good island-style entertainment; for my recommendations on the
island’s best, see Chapter 16.
Another fine way to celebrate the end of another day in paradise is 
to set sail on a sunset cruise. I recommend Capt. Andy’s Sailing
Adventures — recommended earlier in this chapter, under “Cruising 
the Na Pali Coast and other on-deck adventures.”
At the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa, 1571 Poipu Rd. (% 808-742-
1234; www.kauai-hyatt.com), the Seaview Terrace makes a lovely spot
for sunset cocktails and a sunset torch lighting ceremony, followed by
live Hawaiian entertainment. After sunset, head indoors to Stevenson’s
Library, a cozy library-like lounge offering live soft jazz and a notewor-
thy menu of after-dinner drinks, plus a sushi menu Friday through
Tuesday evenings. You can even savor your drink over a game of pool,
chess, or backgammon.
Even if you don’t dine at the Beach House Restaurant, 5022 Lawai Rd.,
off Poipu Road, toward Spouting Horn, Poipu Beach (% 808-742-1424;
www.the-beach-house.com), stop at the lounge for tropical cocktails
and a glorious view of the sun setting over the Poipu surf.
Keoki’s Paradise, at the Poipu Shopping Village, at Poipu Road and
Kiahuna Plantation Drive (% 808-742-7534; www.keokisparadise.
com), features a lengthy tropical-drinks menu in the relaxing Tiki-style
Bamboo Bar, plus live music most nights.
For a similar scene in Lihue, head to Keoki’s sister restaurant, Duke’s
Canoe Club, on the beach at the Kauai Marriott and Beach Club, 3610
Chapter 17: Exploring Kauai 491

Rice St. (near Nawilwili Harbor; % 808-246-9599; www.dukeskauai.
com), which also features live Hawaiian music on Friday nights.
My favorite hangout on the North Shore is Bouchons Hanalei (formerly
called Sushi Blues), in Ching Young Village, 5–8420 Kuhio Hwy., Hanalei
(% 808-826-9701 or 808-828-1435; www.sushiandblues.com), a cav-
ernous and casual-chic sushi bar and restaurant that features great food
and great drinks (see Chapter 16) and live jazz and blues or dance music
Wednesday through Sunday nights.
Cheerful Tahiti Nui, 5-5134 Kuhio Hwy., Hanalei (% 808-826-6277; www.
thenui.com), is a genuine Tiki bar that calls itself Hawaii’s oldest bar
and restaurant. I don’t know about that, but you will find a genuinely
joyful, relaxed, old-school vibe at this friendly and ultra-casual vintage
Tiki hut on the fringe of Hanalei town. Come for the tropical cocktails,
and call ahead for the live entertainment schedule.
Just down the road, Princeville has several nightspots. My favorite is the
open-air Happy Talk Lounge at the Hanalei Bay Resort, 5380 Honoiki St.
(% 808-826-6522; www.hanaleibayresort.com), which offers some of
the finest sunset views in all of the islands. Come for cocktails at any
time of day — the lounge is open from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily for
cocktails and munchies — or come to enjoy a side of live jazz with your
sunset Sundays from 4 to 7 p.m., as well as live hula Tuesdays from 6:30
to 9:30 p.m.

 Making yourself at home in paradise
H
awaii may be the 50th U.S. state, but it’s an ocean — and a world — 
apart from its mainland brethren. In fact, because it didn’t join the
star-spangled party until 1959, Hawaii came into the Union as an adopted
adult, complete with its own unique personality, fully formed (indeed,
ancient) culture, and distinct worldview.
Honolulu sits closer to Tokyo than it does to Washington, D.C. — and that
makes a big difference, creating a further divide between the islands and
the Eurocentric perspective that many Americans have on the world.
Even the population is dramatically different. Unlike in the rest of the
United States, no one ethnic group forms a majority in Hawaii. Although
Caucasian and Japanese are the two largest ethnic groups (each accounts
for roughly 22 percent of the population), nearly 35 percent of islanders
consider themselves of mixed ethnicity. Hawaii’s residents, as a group,
don’t consider race a factor in marriage; they’re just as likely to marry
someone from a different race as not.
The fact that Hawaii is both exotic and familiar is one of its greatest
appeals. It’s also one of the biggest pitfalls for visitors, however: Because
Hawaii is part of the good ol’ US of A, many first-time visitors think that
they have it all figured out. What could they possibly have to know?
You need to know a few things, it turns out. If you’d rather come across
as an akamai (smart) traveler than advertise your status as a Malihini
(newcomer), then this chapter is for you.

Mastering the Three Most Important 
Phrases in the Hawaiian Language
Everyone in Hawaii speaks English, of course. A few Hawaiian words and
phrases have made their way into the common vernacular, though, and
regularly pop up in everyday conversation.
You probably already know the Hawaiian word aloha (a-lo-ha), which
serves as an all-purpose greeting — hello and welcome, and goodbye as
well. It’s a warm and wonderful word, full of grace and compassion and
good feeling, so use it liberally; there’s no better way to get caught up in
the true spirit of Hawaii.
A second word that every visitor should learn is mahalo (ma-ha-low),
which means “thank you” and is used extensively throughout Hawaii. If you
want to say “Thanks very much!” or “Thank you so much,” say mahalo nui
loa (ma-ha-low noo-ee low-ah). Not only will the locals be impressed with
your efforts to learn, but they’ll be flattered by your graciousness, too.
Islanders don’t like “goodbye” to be so permanent. So to really sound
like a local, part from others warmly with a hui hou (ah hoo-ee ho),
which means “until we meet again.”
Discovering More Hawaiian Words
If you only know aloha, a hui hou, and mahalo, you’ll do just fine. But if
you consider yourself ahead of the curve and want to know a few more
useful words, take a few minutes to study the following list. That way,
when you’re in a restaurant and the waiter offers your little ones a keiki
menu, describes today’s lunch special as particularly ono, or asks you if
you’re pau when he comes to clear your plate, you’ll feel like a regular
kamaaina:
 alii (ah-lee-ee): Hawaiian royalty
 halau (ha-lau): School
 hale (ha-lay): House
 haole (how-lee): Foreigner or Caucasian (literally “out of breath” —
pale, or paleface); a common reference, not an insult (usually)
 heiau (heh-ee-ow): Hawaiian temple
 hui (hoo-ee): A club, collective, or assembly (for example, an
artists’ collective is an artists’ hui)
 hula (hoo-lah): Native dance
 imu (ee-moo): Underground oven lined with hot rocks that’s used
for cooking the luau pig
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
496

 kahuna (ka-hoo-nah): Priest or expert
 kamaaina (ka-ma-eye-nah): Local person
 kane (ka-nay): Man (you may see this word on a restroom door)
 kapu (ka-poo): Anything that’s taboo, forbidden
 keiki (keh-kee): Child
 kupuna (koo-poo-nah): An elder, leader, grandparent, or anyone
who commands great respect
 lanai (lah-nigh): Porch or veranda
 lei (lay): Garland (usually of flowers, leaves, or shells)
 luau (loo-ow): A celebratory feast
 malihini (ma-li-hee-nee): Stranger or newcomer
 mana (ma-na): Spirit, divine power
 muumuu (moo-oo-moo-oo): A loose-fitting dress, usually in a 
tropical print
 ono (oh-no): Delicious
 pau (pow): Finished or done
 pali (pah-lee): Cliff
 pupu (poo-poo): Starter dish, appetizer
 wahine (wa-wee-nay): Woman (you may see this word on a 
restroom door)
Pronouncing Those Pesky Hawaiian 
Words and Place Names
Because the Hawaiian language has only 12 characters to work with —
the five vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) plus seven consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p,
and w) — Hawaiian words and names tend to be long and difficult, with
lots of repetitive syllables that can really get your vocal chords into a
twist. Master just a few basic rules, however, and “Honoapiilani Highway”
and “Haliimaile” will be rolling off your tongue like “Main Street” and
“Anytown, USA” in no time.
Half the letters in the Hawaiian language — h, k, l, m, n, and p — sound
out just like they do in English. The one consonant that sounds different
in Hawaiian is w. W usually carries the v sound when it follows i or e; for
example, the Oahu town of Haleiwa is “ha-lay-ee-vah.” At the beginning
of words and after a, u, and o, though, it’s usually your standard w —
hence Wailea (why-lay-ah) and Makawao (mah-kah-wow), two Maui 
destinations.
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Lose the Tourist Trappings 497

The vowels are pronounced like this:
a
ah (as in father) or uh (as in above)
e
eh (as in bed) or ay (as in they)
i
ee (as in police)
o
oh (as in vote)
u
oo (as in too)
Almost all vowels are sounded separately, although some are pro-
nounced together, as in the name of Waikiki’s main thoroughfare,
Kalakaua Avenue, which is pronounced “kah-lah-cow-ah.”
Here’s the most important tip to remember when trying to pronounce a
Hawaiian word or name: Don’t be overwhelmed by length. Get into the
habit of seeing long words or names as a collection of short syllables,
and you’ll find them much easier to say. (Accents almost always fall on
the second-to-last syllable.)
The trick is to know where to put on the breaks. That leads me to impor-
tant tip number two: All syllables end with vowels, so a consonant will
always indicate the start of a new syllable. One of the best examples of
this is the tongue-twisting Kealakekua Bay (the famous marine preserve
off the Big Island’s Kona Coast), which throws nearly everyone for a
loop. Break the syllables down by reading the consonants as red flags,
though, and see how easy it becomes: “kay-ah-lah-keh-koo-ah.”
The Hawaiian language actually has a 13th character: the glottal stop,
which looks exactly like an apostrophe (‘) and is meant to indicate a
pause. I’ve chosen not to use the glottal stop throughout this book; it’s
often omitted in printed Hawaiian and on things like store and street
signs. Although serious Hawaiian-language students learn volumes about
the glottal stop and its equal importance to its fellow consonants and
vowels, you don’t need to worry about it for your purposes; you can
basically ignore it when you see it.
I’ve laid out these basics so that you can understand how the language
works, but no one expects you to become an expert at pronouncing
Hawaiian words. Whenever I return to Hawaii, I always feel as if it takes
me a day or two to get my tongue back in working order — and I know
this stuff. Still, practicing is fun, and with these basic tools under your
belt, you’ll quickly get the hang of it. Practice with the first two examples
at the start of this chapter, and you’ll really impress the locals when you
get to Maui: Honoapiilani Highway (ho-no-ah-pee-ee-la-nee) and
Haliimaile (ha-lee-ee-my-lee).
Knowing How to Give and Take Directions
Leave your compass at home — islanders have a different sense of direc-
tion than mainlanders do. Although locals do think of the islands as
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
498

having north shores and south shores, west coasts and east coasts,
seldom will anybody direct you by using the most common directional
terms.
Instead, they’ll send you either makai (ma-kai), a directional meaning
toward the sea, or mauka (mow-kah), meaning toward the mountains.
Because each island is basically a volcano with a single coastal road cir-
cling it, those two terms are often enough to do the trick.
When they don’t suffice, locals are likely to invoke relative terms rather
than “north,” “south,” “east,” or “west.” If you’re standing in Kapaa on
Kauai’s east shore, for example, locals tell you to head toward Lihue if
they want you to go south. In Honolulu, people use Diamond Head when
they mean to the east (in the direction of the world-famous crater called
Diamond Head), and Ewa (ee-va) when they mean to the west (in the
direction of the town called Ewa, beyond Pearl Harbor).
So if you ask an islander for directions on Oahu, you’re likely to hear
something like this: “Turn left and go 2 miles Diamond Head [east], turn
at the light and go 2 blocks makai [toward the sea], and then turn at the
stop light. Go 2 more blocks and turn Ewa [west]; the address you want
is on the mauka [mountain] side of the street.”
If you’re on the Big Island at a luxury Kohala Coast resort and you’re
heading out to catch a snorkel cruise, for example, you’re more likely to
hear something like this: “Go 8 miles past Kailua-Kona [south] to mile
marker 109. Turn makai [toward the ocean] on King Kam Road and then
left at the bottom of the hill.”
Remembering That You’re in the United States
If you’re from the continental United States, don’t say “back home in the
U.S.” when you’re talking to folks in Hawaii. This tip seems like a real no-
brainer, but that long flight across the Pacific and the one-of-a-kind
Hawaiian ambience and culture can really play tricks with your mind.
Islanders are, by and large, a patriotic bunch, so they don’t take kindly
to being left off the national map. Refer to the continental United States
as the mainland, which is what they do.
Another very important point in the same vein: Locals are always called
“islanders,” never Hawaiians, unless they are of native blood, which not
that many islanders are. (Hawaiian is an ethnic label.)
Wearing Sunscreen
You don’t need a trained eye to spot the newest arrivals a mile away —
they’re the ones with the excruciating sunburns. Way too many newcom-
ers fry themselves on the first day of their vacations in an overzealous
quest to tan, putting a major damper on their trip — and sometimes
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Lose the Tourist Trappings 499

their long-term health — in the process. The sun’s rays are much
stronger in Hawaii than on the mainland.
Hawaii’s sun-loving population has achieved the dubious distinction of
having the highest incidence of skin cancer in the United States, and as a
result, it has developed quite an attachment to sunscreen. The deep-tan-
ning Coppertone days are a thing of the past, even among the most zeal-
ous sun worshippers.
Most locals I know use SPF 25 or 30 sunscreen on a daily basis. It’s wise
not to go out in the sun, even for ten minutes, wearing anything less
than SPF 15; those of you with light complexions should stick with SPF
30 or 45.
I always make a special effort to apply sunscreen under bathing suit
straps, on the tops of my feet, on the back of my neck, and on my ears
and lips — all spots that are the easiest to forget but the most sensitive
to painful burns. (In fact, I usually slather up before I get dressed in the
morning.)
Sunglasses and a hat are two more important weapons for fending off
the sun’s rays. Throw away those $5 shades and splurge on a decent
pair with UV filters to protect your corneas from sunburn and to prevent
cataracts. Wear a hat with a wide brim that goes all the way around;
baseball caps leave some of your most vulnerable areas — your ears and
neck — exposed to the sun’s harsh rays.
Attention, Mom and Dad: Infants under 6 months should not be
directly exposed to the harsh Hawaiian sun. Older babies need zinc
oxide to protect their fragile skin, and kids should be slathered with
high-SPF sunscreen every hour. They also need shades, hats, and other
protective gear.
Dressing the Part
There’s nothing more tacky-touristy than a bold tropical-patterned aloha
shirt, right? Wrong!
Invented by an enterprising Honolulu tailor looking for a new way to drum
up business in 1936, the aloha shirt has since spawned a whole wardrobe
of bright, tropical-print wearables for men, women, and children, collec-
tively known as aloha wear. Spirited, beautiful, easy to wear, and com-
fortable, aloha wear is the embodiment of the Hawaiian lifestyle — and
it’s acceptable just about anywhere in Hawaii, from the beach to the
boardroom to the best table at a four-star restaurant. (A tiny handful of
Hawaii’s most expensive resort restaurants do require men to wear a
jacket, but I don’t recommend those places.) Of course, the key to wear-
ing aloha wear well is understanding the line that separates the sublime
from the goofy.
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
500

Look for beautiful, well-designed prints with strong colors and no bleed-
ing. Look for quality buttons (coconut or wood are best, but not a must)
and pattern matching at the seams and pockets. Top-quality brands to
look for include Kahala Sportswear, Kamehameha Garment Co., and
the Paradise Found and Diamond Head labels, all of which have revived
vintage designs; Reyn’s, which boasts beautiful patterns in a range of
flattering styles, especially for women; Tommy Bahama’s, whose top-
quality clothing lines are generically tropical but suit the Hawaii mood
perfectly; and, one of my all-time favorites, Tori Richard, which employs
some of Hawaii’s finest artists to design its patterns. If you visit the Big
Island, Sig Zane’s mostly all-cotton aloha wear and accessories are the
height of subdued sophistication and nature-inspired beauty, whereas
on Oahu, Mamo Howell has elevated the muumuu to haute couture
status. Hilo Hattie is the largest manufacturer and distributor of aloha
wear, and though its stuff isn’t the height of aloha fashion, it has
increased substantially in quality while remaining very affordable.
The cardinal rule of wearing aloha wear like a local rather than a tourist?
No matching. No themed husband-and-wife shirts, no mom-and-daughter
muumuu, no two garments on one person in the same pattern. Period.
Remembering Your Island-Style Manners
As in many Eastern cultures, removing your shoes when you enter a pri-
vate home is common practice in Hawaii — which is one reason why flip-
flops and other slip-on–style shoes are so common in the islands.
Islanders pride themselves on their laid-back manner and friendliness,
and they really show it in their driving habits — so leave your need for
speed at home. And don’t honk your horn to chastise other drivers,
which is considered the height of rudeness. If the car in front of you isn’t
moving quickly enough, or someone cuts you off, just let it slide. Car
horns are used to greet friends in Hawaii.
Leaving Your Work Behind
Even the newly minted mainland millionaires who are buying up Hawaii
real estate left and right understand the meaning of Hawaii. Don’t cart
your business worries halfway around the world; an island vacation is
far too precious for that. Conveniently forget to give your boss your itin-
erary. Hawaii is the place to leave work behind and relax. And you can
drop that rat race attitude while you’re at it. I mean it: Relax!
Smiling a Lot and Saying “Aloha” to Strangers
Who knows? You may even get yourself mistaken for a local.

Ten Easy Steps to 
Island Dining
In This Chapter
 Knowing what you’re eating and how to eat it
 Maximizing your dining experiences
E
ating well in the islands isn’t a problem. Hawaii has lured some of
the world’s finest chefs to its kitchens and managed to cultivate
some stars of its own in the process. If you love quality seafood, fresh-
grown veggies, and sweet tropical fruits, you’ll think that you’ve died
and gone to heaven.
But that’s far from the end of the bounty. Hawaii’s melting-pot society
sets a global table. Although Asian flavors and cooking styles are most
prevalent, island menus travel the globe, from old-world European culi-
nary classics to good ol’ ranch-raised, fire-grilled steaks. Hawaii’s cooks
have even managed to put their own spin on some of the world’s most
revered foods — pizzas, burgers, and burritos — with rousing success.
You may, however, want to know a few things about island dining before
you sit down to a meal — the first being that Hawaii has two brands of
homegrown cuisine: local food (the unpretentious, hearty fare that
islanders traditionally eat on an everyday basis) and Hawaii Regional, or
Hawaii Island, Cuisine (the gourmet version). If you want to find out
more on the culinary front, then this chapter is for you.
Fresh-Caught and Island-Raised
To say that Hawaii’s seafood may be the best in the world is no stretch —
in fact, some of the world’s finest chefs think so. But Hawaii’s bounty
isn’t limited to the sea. A wealth of fresh-grown vegetables, including
leafy lettuces and vine-ripened tomatoes, thrives in the lava-rich soil.
But fruits are Hawaii’s real forte. All you need to do is head to the local
supermarket to discover a whole new world of citrus and more varieties
of banana than you ever knew existed.

Tropical fruit comes as no surprise, of course, but who knew that Hawaii
offered so much island-raised meat? In fact, the island called Hawaii is
home to the largest privately owned cattle ranch in the United States:
Parker Ranch, covering 225,000 acres, including more than 50,000 cattle,
and serving as the heart of Hawaii’s paniolo (cowboy) country.
Traditional Island Eats
Local food is a casual, catchall cuisine, mirroring Hawaii’s melting-pot
soul. Outsider influences on the local cuisine arrived in Hawaii from all
over the map, from Portugal to Japan and just about everywhere in
between.
Local food is generally starch-heavy and high in calories, so don’t expect
it to have a positive impact on your waistline. The most quintessential
element of local food is the plate lunch, which usually consists of a main
dish (anything from fried fish to teriyaki beef), “two scoops rice,” an ice-
cream-scoop serving of macaroni salad, and brown gravy, all served on a
paper plate. Plate lunches are cheap and available at casual restaurants
and beachside stands throughout the islands.
A great place to try local food is at a luau. For more on luau, see the sec-
tion “What to Expect at a Luau,” at the end of this chapter.
The Gourmet Side of the Island Stove
About a dozen or so years ago, Hawaii’s kitchens underwent a culinary
revolution alongside its cultural renaissance, and — voilà! — Hawaii
Regional Cuisine was born. Island chefs were tired of living up to a
Continental standard that was unsuited to Hawaii living, so they created
their own brand of gourmet fare, using fresh local ingredients in creative
combinations and preparations.
This type of cuisine is often disguised under other names, such as Euro-
Asian, Pacific Rim, Indo-Pacific, Pacific Edge, Euro-Pacific, and Island
Fusion, but it all falls under the jurisdiction of Hawaii Regional Cuisine.
Although there are variations, you can expect the following keynotes: lots
of fresh island fish, many Asian flavorings and cooking styles , and fresh
tropical fruit sauces.
A Translation List for Seafood Lovers
Even savvy seafood eaters can become confused when confronted with
a Hawaiian menu. Although the mainland terms are sometimes included,
Chapter 19: Ten Easy Steps to Island Dining 503

many menus use only the Hawaiian names to tout their daily catches.
What’s more, some types of seafood that make regular appearances in
Hawaii’s kitchens simply don’t show up on mainland menus at all.
You’re likely to encounter many of the following types of seafood while
you’re in Hawaii:
 Ahi: This dense, ruby-red bigeye or yellowfin tuna is a Hawaiian
favorite. Ahi is regularly served raw, as sushi and sashimi, or
panko-crusted and seared in Hawaii Regional Cuisine. Yellowfin is
the beefier of the two.
 Aku: This meaty, robust skipjack tuna is also known as bonito. Aku
is best as raw sushi because it can get too dry if not expertly
cooked.
 Au (ow): This firm-fleshed marlin or broadbill swordfish sometimes
stands in for ahi in local dishes. Pacific blue marlin is sometimes
called kajiki, and striped marlin often shows up as nairagi.
 Hebi (heh-bee): This mildly flavored, almost lemony, spearfish is
sometimes the day’s catch in upscale restaurants.
 Mahimahi: This white, sweet, moderately dense fish is Hawaii’s
most popular, and it shows up regularly on mainland menus.
 Monchong (mon-chong): This exotic fish boasts a flaky, tender tex-
ture and a simple flavor. It’s best served broiled, sautéed, or
steamed.
 Onaga (o-na-ga): This mild, moist, and tender ruby-red snapper 
is served in many fine restaurants; be sure to sample it if it’s 
available.
 Ono (oh-no): Ono means “good to eat” in Hawaiian, and this mack-
erel-like fish sure It’s often served grilled and in sandwiches.
 Opah (oh-pa): This rich, almost creamy moonfish is good served
just about any way, from sashimi to baked.
 Opakapaka (oh-pa-ka-pa-ka): Either pink or crimson snapper, this
light, flaky, elegant fish is very popular on fine-dining menus.
 Shutome (shuh-toe-me): This is what mainlanders call swordfish.
It’s a sweet and tender steaklike fish that’s great grilled or broiled.
 Tombo: This is albacore tuna — but this firm, flavorful whitefish
surpasses the canned stuff by miles when prepared appropriately.
 Uku (oo-koo): This gray — pale pink, really — snapper is flaky,
moist, and delicate.
 Ulua (oo-loo-ah): Ulua is large jack trevally, a firm-fleshed, flavorful
fish also known as pompano.

504

Chapter 19: Ten Easy Steps to Island Dining 505
More Everyday Hawaiian Food Terms
All the following foods are common in plate lunches and at luau. A num-
ber of them also pop up on gourmet menus — usually with expensive
ingredients and prepared with a twist, of course:
 Bento: A Japanese box lunch.
 Haupia (how-pee-ah): Creamy coconut pudding, usually served in
squares. A favorite luau dessert.
 Kalua pork: Pork slow-cooked in an imu, or underground oven;
listed on menus as “luau pig” on occasion.
 Kiawe (kee-ah-vay): An aromatic mesquite wood often used to fire
the wood-burning ovens.
 Laulau: Pork, chicken, or fish wrapped in ti leaves and steamed.
 Lilikoi (lil-ee-koy): Passion fruit.
 Lomilomi (low-mee-low-mee) salmon: Salted salmon marinated,
ceviche-like, with tomatoes and green onions.
 Lumpia (lum-pee-ah): The Portuguese version of a spring roll, but
spicier, doughier, and deep-fried (and usually stuffed with pork and
veggies).
 Malassada (mah-lah-sah-da): The Portuguese version of a dough-
nut, usually round, deep-fried, and generously sprinkled with pow-
dered sugar.
 Manapua (man-ah-poo-ah): A bready, doughy bun with sweetened
pork or sweet beans inside, like Chinese bao.
 Ohelo (oh-hay-low): A berry very similar to a cranberry that com-
monly appears in Hawaii Regional sauces.
 Panko: Japanese bread crumbs, most commonly used to prepare
katsu (a deep-fried pork or chicken cutlet).
 Poi: The root of the taro pounded into a purple, starchy paste; a
staple of the island diet, but generally tasteless to most outsiders.
 Poke (po-kay): Cubed raw fish — usually ahi or marlin — seasoned
with onions, soy, and seaweed.
 Ponzu: A soy-and-citrus dipping sauce popular with Hawaii
Regional Cuisine chefs.
 Pupus: Appetizers or hors d’oeuvres.
 Saimin (sai-min): A brothy soup with ramenlike noodles, topped
with bits of fish, chicken, pork, and/or vegetables.

 Shave ice: The island version of a snow cone, best enjoyed with ice
cream and sweet azuki (red) beans at the bottom.
 Taro: A green leafy vegetable grown in Hawaii; the root is used to
make poi (mentioned earlier in this list), and the leafy part of the
vegetable is often steamed like spinach.
Other Local Favorites
Lest all this unfamiliar food talk make you think otherwise, remember that
the majority of Hawaii islanders are red-blooded, flag-waving Americans —
and they love a good burger just as much as your average mainlander.
Hawaii has also co-opted Mexican cuisine and made the burrito its own.
Ethnic Eats
Thanks to Hawaii’s proximity to the Eastern Hemisphere and its large,
multifaceted Asian population, the islands boast a wealth of fabulous
Asian restaurants, including Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese.
With the exception of Japanese, most Asian restaurants tend to be very
affordable. What’s more, because island palates are much more used to
dining Asian-style, the dishes aren’t gringo-ized for a mainland popula-
tion. Dining out in Hawaii, you may just find yourself enjoying the finest
ethnic food you’ve ever eaten.
The Joys and Sorrows of the Supermarket
Hawaii supermarkets offer a number of treats that you won’t find at 
your average mainland supermarket. Poi, for example, comes in instant,
premade, and make-your-own forms. The bounty in the seafood case is
much more diverse than what you see at home; Hawaii refrigerator
cases regularly contain such taste treats as sushi-grade tuna, fresh
Pacific octopus, and whole squid (insert “yum!” or “yuck!” here, depend-
ing on your taste buds).
Just about any Hawaii supermarket will have multiple aisles devoted to
Asian foods, from noodles to bizarre candies. The juice refrigerator case
is also a treat, so don’t be afraid to try something new. 
Java lovers, rejoice. Every Hawaiian island except Lanai has a coffee
plantation, and the local brew is available in just about any average
market. All Hawaii-grown coffees are delicious, but the world-famous
Kona coffee, grown on the Big Island, is the top of the heap.
The greatest bounty appears among the fresh fruits, where you’ll find
such fresh tropical treats as mangoes, guava, star fruit, lychee, lilikoi
(passion fruit), and much more. Pineapples are another Hawaii taste
treat; the small white pineapples are sweetest, and you’ll usually find
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
506

them clearly labeled at the market. The Big Island’s lava-rich soil pro-
duces extraflavorful citrus fruits; Kau oranges, for example, are leg-
endary for their sweetness. Even watermelon is an extraspecial treat;
Molokai-grown watermelons are the best in the world — full of seeds,
but fabulous.
Among Hawaii-grown vegetables, Maui onions are the ultimate treat.
They’re very sweet, but with a distinctive flavor all their own. Dense,
purple Molokai-grown sweet potatoes are another of my favorites.
Don’t shy away from tropical fruits or other foods just because you’re
unfamiliar with them. Islanders are friendly and talkative folks. Super-
market attendants — or even your fellow shoppers — will be happy to
advise you on how to cut or clean island fruits.
Shopping in Hawaii does, however, have a downside — namely, high
prices. Although you’ll save quite a few bucks over three-meals-a-day
restaurant dining by stocking up and cooking for yourself back at the
condo, expect anything that has to wing its way across the Pacific to be
more than you usually pay.
Another Island Tradition: Tropical Cocktails
In Hawaii, the mai tai is practically the official state cocktail. The classic
mai tai is a magical sweet-tart concoction of Jamaican rum, fresh lime
juice, and chunky ice, generally served in a tumbler and topped with a
fresh sprig of mint.
Of course, mai tais may not be your thing. If that’s the case, don’t worry.
You’ll find plenty of other ways to toast your time in paradise. Personally,
I’m a big fan of the piña colada. I know it’s not a Hawaiian cocktail, but it
never fails to put me in the tropical mood, especially when a colorful
paper umbrella and a generous slice of pineapple are included.
What to Expect at a Luau
A luau is the ideal place to experience island traditions — but only to a
degree, of course. Any commercial luau (read: any luau that you’re likely
to attend) will be tainted by its commercialism. But a few luau do a great
job of bringing genuine island culture into the mix.
You can find the best luau — offering the best mix of good food, ameni-
ties, setting, and authentic culture — on Maui. The Old Lahaina Luau
and The Feast at Lele are the best luau that Hawaii has to offer, hands
down. If you’re going to be on the Valley Isle, be sure to book your spots
now; see Chapter 12.
Chapter 19: Ten Easy Steps to Island Dining 507

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
508
If you’re not visiting Maui, don’t despair. Each island offers its own ver-
sions of the luau feast, with the Big Island garnering second-runner-up
awards for its very respectable feast and top-quality entertainment at
Kona Village or the progressive, open-air Gathering of the Kings luau at
The Fairmont Orchid (see Chapter 14). In Waikiki, book your spot at the
oceanfront Royal Luau at the Royal Hawaiian or the family-friendly Sea
Life Luau at the marine playground Sea Life Park (see Chapter 10). On
Kauai, your best choice is the highly satisfying Luau Kalamaku at the
Kilohana Plantation (Chapter 16).
Upon arrival, you’re likely to be greeted with a lei, made of either fresh
flowers or shells, and a cocktail, often a mai tai (or fruit juice, if you’re
too young or a teetotaler). You’ll be led to your assigned seat, usually at
a communal table with chairs (although the Old Lahaina Luau now fea-
tures some traditional seating, on cushions facing low-slung tables).
Cocktails are usually included in the pay-one-price admission fee to a
luau. Open bars are common, but some luau limit you to a certain number
or kind of drink. If it matters to you, be sure to ask when booking.
After the luau pig is unearthed from the imu, everyone is usually asked
to take their seats. You’ll be invited to fill your plate from the buffet luau
spread; the best luau clearly mark the dishes so that you know what
you’re sampling. In addition to the kalua pork (shredded from the bone
after the luau pig is unearthed), you can expect such traditional dishes
as poi, the tasteless purple paste that’s the staple starch of Hawaii.
You’re more likely to prefer such dishes as lomilomi salmon, poke, and
haupia (see the section “More Everyday Hawaiian Food Terms,” earlier
in this chapter). If you’re not an adventurous diner, don’t worry — you’ll
find plenty of familiar dishes on hand, including chicken teriyaki, long
rice, and salad. After dinner comes the evening’s entertainment, usually
a hula show that lasts an hour or so before the evening winds down.

Chapter 20
Ten Ways to Enjoy 
Island Romance
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how to relax and let the island vibe take over
 Making magical memories together
D
on’t cart your worries and everyday stresses halfway around the
world; an island getaway with your partner is far too precious for
that. In this chapter, I give you the ten best ways to find island happiness
no matter how you define romance.
Luxuriating in the Lap of Luxury
Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and spend the big bucks. If staying
in an oceanfront room that lets the sound of the waves lull you to sleep
is important to you, or if you’ve found the luxury B&B of your dreams
tucked away in a rain forest hideaway, don’t visit Hawaii on the cheap.
Spend the extra money and make memories.
If you really want to splurge on that ultra-deluxe beach resort or a zippy
convertible sports car but you’re worried about the cost, consider
splurging for just part of your trip, and make more budget-friendly
choices during the rest of your stay.
Discovering That You Don’t Need Tons of
Luxury for Hawaii to Feel Like Paradise
But maybe your budget just doesn’t allow for a big splurge. Don’t
despair — Hawaii doesn’t have to be a super-expensive destination.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
510
Some of my happiest times in the islands have been spent sitting on the
lanai of a budget condo, watching the sunrise as I sipped home-brewed
Kona coffee. Room service and Frette bed linens wouldn’t have improved
the moment one iota.
Booking the Hot Spots Before You Leave Home
If you have your heart set on dining at a particular restaurant, catching a
highly recommended snorkel cruise, or attending a certain luau, make
your reservations from home.
See the “Exploring” chapters in this book for recommendations on what
to do, and the “Settling In” chapters for tips on the islands’ most sought-
after reservations.
Setting Aside Time for Relaxation
Work plenty of do-nothing time into your plans. Keep your time loose
and go with the flow; don’t plan your days in the same detailed way
you’d map out your itinerary on a grand tour of Europe.
A romantic getaway to Hawaii is less about seeing everything and more
about leaving the conventions of regular life behind.
Enjoying a Heavenly Drive
No Hawaii road is more celebrated than the “heavenly” Hana Highway
(Highway 36), the super-curvaceous road that winds along Maui’s north-
eastern shore, offering some of the most stunning natural sightseeing in
the entire state.
Remember that this drive isn’t so much about the destination as it is
about the journey. The drive takes at least three hours — but allow all
day to do it. Start out early, take it slow and easy, stop at scenic points
along the way, and let the Hana Road work its magic on you. In fact, for
the ultimate romantic getaway, I suggest staying overnight in Hana (see
Chapter 12 for recommendations).
See Chapter 13 for full coverage of the drive.
Making Mornings Your Ocean Time
Hawaii’s beaches tend to be less crowded, and the surf and winds tend
to be calmer, in the morning hours — particularly in winter. Always take
the day’s first snorkel and dive cruise, kayak trip, or surf lesson, when
conditions are calmest and clearest.

Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Enjoy Island Romance 511
Spending a Day at Hawaii’s 
Most Romantic Beaches
Hawaii has more than its share of beaches made for romance. Here are
the finest on each island.
Oahu: Head to the misty, magical Windward Coast, where you’ll find 
glorious Lanikai Beach, one of the world’s most tranquil and beautiful
beaches. Two petite offshore islets, called the Mokuleias, provide the
perfect panoramic finish. See Chapter 11.
Maui: About 21⁄2 miles past the town of Hana, Hamoa Beach is a remote,
romantic spot. This half-moon-shaped beach at Maui’s easternmost point
is breathtakingly lovely, with surf the color of turquoise, golden-gray sand,
and verdant hills providing a postcard-perfect backdrop. See Chapter 13.
Big Island: It doesn’t get better than Hapuna Beach State Park, period.
This big, gorgeous stretch has it all: glorious turquoise surf, a half-mile-
long crescent of powdery-fine white sand, and delighted crowds — both
locals and visitors alike — who come out to swim and play the day away.
See Chapter 15.
Kauai: The perfectly named Hideaway Beach is a gorgeous pocket of
North Shore beach in the Princeville Resort where the snorkeling is
great, the sand is powder-fine, and the atmosphere is as tranquil as it
gets. See Chapter 17.
Toasting the Sunset Every Evening
Sunset is pure nirvana in Hawaii — and these heavenly spots offer you
and your special one a front-row seat.
Oahu: House Without a Key, at the Halekulani hotel, 2199 Kalia Rd.,
Waikiki (% 808-923-2311; www.halekulani.com), sets the Hawaii stan-
dard for the sunset cocktail hour. On an oceanfront patio shaded by a
big kiawe tree, you can sip the best mai tais on Oahu, listen to masterful
steel guitar music, and watch a traditional hula dancer sway with ethe-
real grace alongside the palms as iconic Diamond Head slopes laconi-
cally in the distance. It’s romantic, nostalgic, and simply breathtaking.
See chapters 10 and 11.
Maui: You can’t get closer to the ocean than the alfresco tables at I’o,
505 Front St., Lahaina (% 808-661-8422; www.iomaui.com; $$$$).
Overseen by the award-winning chef James McDonald, I’o is a multifac-
eted joy, with a winningly innovative, mostly seafood menu, first-rate
service, and a top-notch wine list. See Chapter 12.
Big Island: Celebrate the daily spectacle of sunset at Don’s Mai Tai Bar
at Don the Beachcomber, at the Royal Kona Resort, 75-5852 Alii Dr.,

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
512
Kailua-Kona (% 808-329-3111; www.royalkona.com). The glorious
colonnaded bar overlooking the surf is the height of Tiki chic, and the
legendary mai tai is everything it should be. See Chapter 15.
Kauai: The Beach House Restaurant, 5022 Lawai Rd., Poipu Beach 
(% 808-742-1424; www.the-beach-house.com), sets the sunset stan-
dard on the glorious Garden Isle. Even if you don’t dine here, stop at the
lounge for a pair of sigh-worthy tropical cocktails and a breathtaking
view as the sun sets over the Poipu surf. See chapters 16 and 17.
Dining in Style
Hawaii offers special-occasion diners more than enough reasons to cele-
brate. These are my favorite ultra-romantic dining splurges.
Oahu: Everything about Orchids, at the Halekulani, 2199 Kalia Rd.,
Waikiki (% 808-923-2311; www.halekulani.com), is sigh-inducing, from
the gorgeous alfresco setting with its spectacular ocean and Diamond
Head views to the seamless service and note-perfect surf-and-turf menu.
See Chapter 10.
Maui: Despite the high prices, I just love Mama’s Fish House, just off the
Hana Highway at 799 Poho Place, Paia (% 808-579-8488; www.mamas
fishhouse.com; $$$$$). The fresh fish is as fabulous as it can be, and
the beachfront Tiki-room setting is quintessential romantic Hawaii. See
Chapter 12.
Big Island: There’s no finer special-occasion choice on this mammoth
isle than the Hualalai Grille by Alan Wong, at the Four Seasons Resort
Hualalai, 100 Kaupulehu Dr., Kaupulehu-Kona (% 808-325-8525; www.
hualalairesort.com). This wonderful restaurant serves up the exqui-
site, inspiring cuisine of Hawaii’s finest chef in a gorgeous, casually
sophisticated resort setting. See Chapter 14.
Kauai: My sunset favorite, the Beach House Restaurant, 5022 Lawai Rd.,
Poipu Beach (% 808-742-1424; www.the-beach-house.com), is also my
island dining favorite. A winning combination of creative island cuisine
and one of the most romantic oceanfront settings in the islands make
this Kauai’s finest restaurant, hands down. See Chapter 16.
Mellowing Out Like a Local
Islanders tend to take life nice and easy. A clock doesn’t rule them, and
they don’t like to rush. They call it “island time.” While you’re in the
islands, do as the locals do: Take life as it comes, and leave plenty of
space in your day for you and your beloved to appreciate the beauty
that surrounds you.

Fast Facts
American Automobile Association (AAA)
Although roadside service is available to
members on the four major islands — Oahu, 
Maui, the Big Island, and Kauai — the only
local AAA office is on Oahu (see the “Fast
Facts: Oahu” section in Chapter 10 for con-
tact info and hours).
For roadside assistance or information 
on becoming a member, call % 800-AAA-
HELP or point your Web browser to www.
aaa.com, where you’ll be linked to your
regional club’s home page by entering 
your zip code. See the sidebar “The AAA
advantage” in Chapter 4 for details on the
many benefits of AAA membership.
American Express
For office locations, see the “Fast Facts”
sections in Chapter 10 (Oahu), Chapter 12
(Maui), and Chapter 14 (the Big Island);
Kauai does not have an AmEx office. Not
all services are offered at all offices, so
call before you go.
Cardholders and traveler’s check holders
should call % 800-528-4800 or 800-221-
7282 for all money emergencies. To make
inquiries with American Express Travel 
or to locate other branch offices, call 
% 800-AXP-TRIP. For more information,
visit www.americanexpress.com.
Area Code
All the Hawaiian Islands are in the 808
area code. When dialing, you can leave
the area code off if you’re calling someone
on the same island that you’re on. If you’re
calling someone on a different island,
though, you must dial 1-808 before the
seven-digit phone number.
If you’re calling from one island to another
island, the call will be billed as a long-
distance call, which can be more expen-
sive than calling the mainland from Hawaii.
Be sure to use your long-distance calling
card when calling between islands to
avoid adding inflated phone charges to
your hotel bill.
ATMs
All of the islands have plenty of ATMs in
the major resort areas. Branches of
Hawaii’s most popular banks are plentiful,
and all are connected to all the global ATM
networks. Most supermarkets also have
ATMs inside, as do many convenience
stores. Do yourself a favor, though, and
stock up on cash before heading off to
remote areas such as the North Shore of
Kauai, the Big Island’s North Kohala penin-
sula or Volcano area, or the islands of
Molokai or Lanai. These areas do have
ATMs, but why waste precious vacation
time tracking them down and risking that
they won’t be on your network?
One of Hawaii’s most popular banks, with
branches throughout the state, is Bank of
Hawaii, which is linked with all the major
worldwide networks. To find the one nearest

Hawaii For Dummies, 5th Edition

you, call % 888-643-3888 or point your Web 
browser to the Bank of Hawaii’s site www.
boh.com and click on “Locations” in the
upper navigational bar; if you don’t find one
near you, try First Hawaiian Bank (www.
fhb.com). You can also find ATMs on the
MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus network by
dialing % 800-424-7787 or going online to
www.mastercard.com; to find a Visa
Plus ATM, call % 800-843-7587 or visit
www.visa.com and then click the ATM
locator at the bottom of the start page.
Credit Cards
If your Visa card is lost or stolen, call 
% 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994.
MasterCard holders should call % 800-
307-7309 or 800-627-8372. American Express 
cardholders should call % 800-268-9824 or
800-528-4800 (for cardholders) or % 800-
221-7282 (for traveler’s check holders).
Emergencies
No matter where you are in Hawaii, dial
911 from any phone, just like you do on the
mainland. To locate doctors and hospital
emergency rooms on the specific islands,
see the “Fast Facts” sections in Chapter 10
(Oahu), Chapter 12 (Maui), Chapter 14 (the
Big Island), and Chapter 16 (Kauai).
Liquor Laws
The legal drinking age in Hawaii is 21. Bars
are allowed to stay open daily until 2 a.m.;
places with cabaret licenses are able to
keep the booze flowing until 4 a.m. Grocery
and convenience stores are allowed to sell
beer, wine, and liquor seven days a week.
Post Offices
To locate convenient local branches, see
the “Fast Facts” sections in Chapter 10
(Oahu), Chapter 12 (Maui), Chapter 14 (the
Big Island), and Chapter 16 (Kauai).
Maps
All the rental-car companies hand out very
good free map booklets on each island,
which are all that you need to navigate
your way around. AAA members can get
excellent maps of Hawaii free of charge
(see listing above for AAA contact info).
If you want more complete topographic
maps of each island, the best are printed
by the University of Hawaii Press. They’re
available from just about any bookstore in
the islands.
Newspapers and Magazines
The Honolulu Advertiser (www.honolulu
advertiser.com) and the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin (www.starbulletin.
com) are the two statewide dailies; the
Advertiser’s Friday TGIF section is an
excellent source for researching happen-
ings about town, particularly on Oahu. The
main weekly entertainment rag is Oahu’s
Honolulu Weekly (www.honolulu
weekly.com). Daily neighbor island news-
papers include the Maui News (www.maui
news.com), the Big Island’s West Hawaii
Today (www.westhawaiitoday.com),
the Hawaii Tribune Herald (www.hilo
hawaiitribune.com), and Kauai’s The
Garden Island (www.kauaiworld.com).
Hawaii magazine (www.hawaii
magazine.com) is a glossy monthly that’s
targeted to visitors. You can usually find the
current issue in the travel magazine sec-
tions at your local branch of the big chain
bookstores, such as Borders and Barnes &
Noble. Subscriptions are available by call-
ing % 800-333-0357 or via the Web site.
Ocean Safety
Keep these snorkel tips in mind as you don
your fins and head into the water:

Always snorkel with a friend and keep an
eye on each other.
Look up every few minutes to get your
bearings. Check your position in relation to
the shoreline and check whether there’s
any boat traffic.
Don’t touch anything. Not only can your
fingers and feet damage coral, but it can
give you nasty cuts. Moreover, camouflaged
fish and spiny shells may surprise you.
Before you set out, check surf conditions
by calling one of the local dive or snorkel
shops, which can give you the latest on
local conditions and recommend alterna-
tive spots if the prime ones are too rough
for snorkeling.
See chapters 11, 13, 15, and 17 for island-
specific snorkel tips.
Pharmacies
Longs Drugs, Hawaii’s biggest drugstore
chain, has convenient locations on all the
major islands. To locate the nearest branch,
point your Web browser to www.longs.
com and click “Store Locator” at the
bottom of the home page or check the
“Fast Facts” sections in Chapter 10 (Oahu),
Chapter 12 (Maui), Chapter 14 (the Big
Island), and Chapter 16 (Kauai).
Smoking
In Hawaii, smoking is against the law in all
enclosed public spaces, period, including
bars and restaurants. In addition, no smok-
ing is allowed within 20 feet of doorways,
windows, and ventilation intakes. Hotels
are allowed to reserve 20 percent of their
rooms for smokers, as long as they’re clus-
tered on the same floor; notable exceptions 
include Westin and Marriott hotels, which
are now 100 percent smoke free, as are
most B&Bs. Car-rental agencies also have
mostly smoke-free cars; if you want a car
you can smoke in, it’s best to note it when
you make your reservation.
Taxes
Most purchases in Hawaii are taxed at
roughly 4 percent; the exact amount will
vary depending on the county you’re in,
and may be embedded in the total pur-
chase price or shown as an independent
line item on your bill. Expect taxes of about
11.42 percent to be added to your final
hotel bill.
Time Zone
Hawaii standard time is in effect year-
round. Hawaii is two hours behind Pacific
standard time and five hours behind east-
ern standard time — so when it’s noon in
Hawaii, it’s 2 p.m. in California and 5 p.m. in
New York.
Hawaii doesn’t observe daylight saving
time, however, so when daylight saving
time is in effect on the mainland — April
through October — Hawaii is three hours
behind the West Coast and six hours
behind the East Coast (making it noon in
Hawaii when it’s 3 p.m. in California and 6
p.m. in New York).
Weather and Surf Reports
For statewide marine reports, call 
% 808-973-4382. For statewide coastal
wind reports, call % 808-973-6114.
For local conditions and forecasts, see the
“Fast Facts” sections in Chapter 10 (Oahu),
Chapter 12 (Maui), Chapter 14 (the Big
Island), and Chapter 16 (Kauai).
