The nature and plausibility
of Cognitivism

Abstract: Cognitivism in psychology and philosophy is roughly the position that intelligent behavior can (only) be explained by appeal
to internal "cognitive processes," that is, rational thought in a very broad sense. Sections 1 to 5 attempt to explicate in detail the nature
of the scientific enterprise that this intuition has inspired. That enterprise is distinctive in at least three ways: It relies on a style of
explanation which is different from that of mathematical physics, in such a way that it is not basically concerned with quantitative
equational laws; the states and processes with which it deals are "interpreted," in the sense that they are regarded as meaningful or
representational; and it is not committed to reductionism, but is open to reduction in a form different from that encountered in other
sciences. Spelling these points out makes it clear that the Cognitivist study of the mind can be rigorous and empirical, despite its un-
precedented theoretical form. The philosophical explication has another advantage as well: It provides a much needed framework for
articulating questions about whether the Cognitivist approach is right or wrong. The last three sections take that advantage of the ac-
count, and address several such questions, pro and con.

1. Systematic explanation
From time to time, the ills of psychology are laid to a misguided
effort to emulate physics and chemistry. Whether the study of
people is inherently "humanistic" and "soft" (Hudson, 1972), or
whether states described in terms of their 
significance
necessarily escape the net of physical law (Davidson, 1970), the
implication is that psychology cannot live up to the standards of
rigorous science, and perhaps cannot be a science at all. But
science itself often leaves behind efforts to say what it can and
cannot be. The Cognitive approach to psychology offers, I think,
a science of a distinctive form, and thereby sidesteps many
"philosophical" objections - including those born of a dazzled
preoccupation with physics. In my first five sections I will try to
characterize that form.
Science in general is an endeavor to understand what occurs in
the world; hence explanation, which is essentially a means to
understanding, has a pivotal importance. Scientific explanations
differ from common sense explanations at least in being more ex-
plicit, more precise, more general, and more deliberately in-
tegrated with one another. Without attempting a full analysis, we
can notice several broad characteristics which all scientific
explanations share. They depend on specifying a range of fea-
tures which are exhibited in, or definable for, a variety of
concrete situations. They depend on knowing or hypothesizing
certain regularities or relationships which always obtain in situa-
tions exhibiting the specified features. And they depend on our
being able to see (understand), for particular cases, that since the
specified features are deployed together in way X, the known
regularities or relationships guarantee that Y. We then say that Y
has been explained through an appeal to (or in terms of) the
general regularities and the particular deployment of the fea-
tures. The regularities and deployment appealed to have been
presupposed by the explanation, and not themselves explained -
though either might be explained, in turn, through appeal to
further presuppositions.
Philosophers have coined the term deductive-nomological for
explanations in which the presupposed regularities are formu-
lated as laws (Greek: nomos), and for which the guarantee that Y
will occur is formulated as a deductive argument from the laws
plus statements describing the deployment X (Hempel and Op-
penheim, 1949). It can be maintained that all scientific explana-
tions are deductive-nomological, though in many cases that re-
quires a counter-intuitive strain on the notion of "law." So to
avoid confusion I will introduce some more restricted termi-
nology, and at the same time illustrate several different ways in
which the foregoing schematic remarks get fleshed out.
The most familiar scientific explanations come from classical
mechanics. The situational features on which they depend in-
clude masses, inertial moments, distances, angles, durations, ve-
locities, energies, and so on - all of which are quantitative,
measurable parameters. The known regularities or relationships
are expressed as equations (algebraic, vectorial, differential, etc.)
relating the values of the various parameters in any given situa-
tion - e.g., F = ma = dp/dt. Usually some of the equations are
designated laws and the others definitions, but there's a well-
known trade-off in which are which. Equations are conveniently
manipulable and combinable in ways that preserve equality; that
is, other equations can be mathematically derived from them.
The standard form of an explanation in mechanics is such a deri-
vation, given specified deployments of masses, forces, and what
have you (see Newton's derivations of Kepler's laws). It is the
derived equational relationships which are explained (or some-
times the actual values of some of the parameters so related, de-
termined by plugging in the known values of others).
I use derivational-nofnological for this special case form of de-
ductive-nomological explanation - where the distinction of the
special case is that the presupposed regularities are expressed as
equational relationships among quantitative parameters, and the
deduction is a mathematical derivation of other such equations
(and then, perhaps, computing some of the values). Besides
mechanics, fields as diverse as optics, thermodynamics and
macroeconomics commonly involve derivational-nomological
explanations.
But what is important here is that there are other forms or
styles of explanation, even in advanced sciences. I will delineate

two such distinct styles, though I will not claim that the distinc-
tions are sharp. The claim is rather that interesting differences
can be characterized among prime examples, despite the fact that
intermediate cases blur the boundaries. Only one of these
further styles is relevant to cognitive psychology; I delineate
them both because they are superficially similar, and easily
confused. Thus explicitly distinguishing them permits a closer
focus on the one we want. These distinctions are independent of
anything peculiar to psychology, and I will draw them that way
first, to keep separate issues as clear as possible.
Imagine explaining to someone how a fiber optics bundle can
take any image which is projected on one end and transmit it to
the other end. I think most people would come to understand the
phenomenon, given the following points. (If I am right, then
readers unfamiliar with fiber optics should still be able to follow
the example): (i) the bundles are composed of many long thin
fibers, which are closely packed side by side, and arranged in
such a way that each one remains in the same position relative to
the others along the whole length of the bundle; (ii) each fiber is
a leak-proof conduit for light - that is, whatever light goes in one
end of a fiber comes out the other end of the same fiber; (iii) a
projected image can be regarded as an array of closely packed
dots of light, differing in brightness and color; and (iv) since each
end of each fiber is like a dot, projecting an image on one end of
the bundle will make the other end light up with dots of the same
brightness and color in the same relative positions - thus pre-
serving the image.
Clearly that was not a derivational-nomological explanation.
One could, with effort, recast it as a logical deduction, but I think
it would lose more perspicacity than it would gain (diagrams
would help much more). If we do not try to force it into a
preconceived mold of scientific explanations, then several dis-
tinctive aspects stand out as noteworthy. First, what is explained
is a disposition or ability of a kind of object (compare Cummins,
1975). Second, the explanation makes appeals (presuppositions)
of two basic sorts: that the kind of object in question has a certain
form or structure (compare Putnam, 1975), and that whatever is
formed or structured in that way has certain dispositions or
abilities. (The object is a bundle of "parallel" fibers, and each
fiber is able to conduct light without leaking.) Third, any object
structured in the presupposed way, out of things with the
presupposed abilities, would have the overall ability being
explained. That is, it doesn't matter how or why the fibers are ar-
ranged as they are, nor how or why they conduct light; these are
simply presupposed, and they are sufficient to explain the ability
to transmit images.
I call explanations of this style morphological, where the dis-
tinguishing marks of the style are that an ability is explained
through appeal to a specified structure and to specified abilities
of whatever is so structured. (These specifications implicitly de-
termine the "kind" of object to which the explanation applies).
In science, morphological explanations are often called
"models" (which in this sense amount to specifications of struc-
ture), but that term is both too broad and too narrow for our pur-
poses: Logicians have a related but different use for it, whereas
few would call the fiber optics account a model.
On the other hand, the account of how DNA can replicate itself
is called a model - the double-helix model - and it is mor-
phological. Simplistically put, the structure is two adjacent
strands of sites, with each site uniquely mated to a comple-
mentary one in the other strand. And the sites have the ability to
split up with their mates and latch onto an exactly similar new
one, selected from a supply which happens to be floating around
loose. This process starts at one end of the double strand, and, by
the time it reaches the other end, there are two double strands,
each an exact replica of the original. At the opposite extreme of
sophistication, an explanation of how cups are able to hold coffee
would be morphological. The specified structure would be little
more than shape, and the specified abilities of what is so struc-
tured would amount to rigidity, insolubility, and the like.
Now consider a case which is subtly but importantly different:
an explanation of how an automobile engine works. As with mor-
phological explanations, this one appeals to a specified structure,
and to specified abilities Or dispositions of what is so structured.
But in addition, and so important as to dominate the account, it
requires specification of a complexly organized pattern of inter-
dependent interactions. The various parts of an engine do.many
different things, so to speak "working together" or "cooperating"
in an organized way, to produce an effect quite unlike what any
of them could do alone.
I reserve the term systematic for explanations of this style,
where the distinction from morphological explanation is the ad-
ditional element of organized cooperative interaction. Strictly, it
is again an ability or disposition which gets explained, but the or-
dinary expression "how it works" often gives a richer feel for
what's involved. A consequence of this definition is that objects
with abilities that get systematically explained must be com-
posed of distinct parts, because specifying interactions is crucial
to the explanation, and interactions require distinct interactors.
Let a system be any object with an ability that is explained
systematically, and functional components be the distinct parts
whose interactions are cited in the explanation. In a system, the
specified structure is essentially the arrangement of functional
components such that they will interact as specified; and the
specified abilities of the components are almost entirely the
abilities to so interact, in the environment created by their neigh-
boring components. Note that what counts as a system, and as its
functional components, is relative to what explanation is being
offered. Other examples of systems (relative to the obvious
explanations) are radios, common mousetraps, and (disregarding
some messiness) many portions of complex organisms.
Fiber optics bundles and DNA molecules are deceptively
similar to systems, because they have clearly distinct
components, each of which contributes to the overall ability by
performing its own little assigned "job." But the jobs are not
interdependent; it is not through cooperative interaction that the
image transmission or replication is achieved, but only an or-
derly summation of the two cents' worth from each separate fiber
or site. In an engine, the carburetor, distributor, spark plugs, and
so forth, do not each deliver a portion of the engine's turning, in
the way that each site or fiber contributes a portion of the replica-
tion or image. The job metaphor can be expanded to further
illustrate the difference. In old fashioned plantation harvesting,
each laborer picked a portion of the crop (say one row), and when
each was done, it was all done. But at a bureaucratic corporation
like General Motors, comparatively few workers actually assem-
ble automobiles; the others make parts, maintain the factories,
come up with new designs, write paychecks, and so on. All of
these tasks are prerequisite to continued production, but only in-
directly, through a complex pattern of interdependencies. A
system is like a bureaucratic corporation, with components play-
ing many different roles, most contributing to the final outcome
only indirectly, via the organized interactions.
I have described three different styles of explanation, each of
which can be scientifically rigorous and respectable. They are all
abstract or formal, in that they all "abstract" certain features and
regularities from a variety of concrete situations, and then show
how the resulting "forms" make certain properties or events in-
telligible in all such situations. But they differ notably in the na-
ture of the abstract forms they specify, at least in clear cases.
Only the derivational-nomological style puts an explicit em-
phasis on equations of the sort that we usually associate with
scientific laws. But I shall claim that only the systematic style is
directly relevant to cognitive psychology. Thus the charge of
slavishly imitating mathematical physics does not apply to
Cognitivism, and it doesn't matter that quantitative equational
"laws of behavior" seem to be few and far between. Many of the
points I have made have been made before (Cummins, 1975;
Putnam, 1975, ch. 14; Dennett, 1971; Simon, 1969; Fodor, 1965),
but no one, to my knowledge, has previously distinguished mor-

phological and systematic explanation. The importance of that
distinction will emerge in section 4.
2. Systematic reduction
Traditional philosophical concerns for the unity of science and
for the metaphysical doctrine of materialism (i.e., that everything
is "ultimately just" matter in motion) customarily lead to ques-
tions about scientific reduction. Psychological concepts and
theories are prime targets for such questions because they are
not, at first glance, materialistic. This is not the place for a full
discussion of the problem of reduction, but my position about the
nature of Cognitivism will have several specific implications
which should be pointed out. Some of these derive from the sug-
gestion that Cognitivist explanation is systematic, and those can
be considered independently of issues peculiar to psychology.
An aspect common to all the explanations discussed in the last
section (indeed, to all explanations) is that they presuppose some
things in the course of explaining others. More particularly, they
presuppose certain specified general regularities, which are ap-
pealed to, but not themselves explained. But such regularities
often can be explained, by appeal to others which are more
"basic." Such further explanation is reduction, though obviously
it counts as reduction only relative to the explanations whose
presupposed regularities are being explained. This is a fairly
broad definition of reduction, and includes cases which aren't
very exciting in form. Thus, Newton's derivation of Kepler's laws
counts as a reduction of Kepler's explanations of planetary posi-
tions.
A more famous reduction in classical physics, and one with a
more interesting form, was that of thermodynamics to statistical
mechanics. In outline, the values of the parameters occurring in
the equations of thermodynamie theory were found (or
hypothesized) to correlate with quantities definable statistically
in terms of the mechanical parameters of groups of atoms. For
example, the absolute temperature of a region was found to be
proportional to the average kinetic energy of the atoms in that
region. Such correlations are expressed in specific equations
called "bridge equations." It then turned out that the laws of
thermodynamics could be mathematically derived from the laws
of mechanics, some plausible statistical assumptions, and these
bridge equations. The effect was to explain the regularities
which were presupposed by thermodynamie explanations - in
other words, to reduce thermodynamics.
Reductive explanations which explain the equational laws
presupposed by derivational-nomological explanations I call
nomological reductions. Note that the definition refers to the
style of explanation being reduced, not to the style of the reduc-
ing explanation. The reduction of thermodynamics is often cited
as a paradigm of scientific reduction, as if all others should have a
similar structure. But a moment's reflection shows that this struc-
ture only makes sense if the explanation being reduced is
derivational-nomological; otherwise there would be no equa-
tional laws to derive, and probably no quantitative parameters to
figure in bridge equations.
The regularities presupposed by morphological and
systematic explanations are mainly the specified dispositions or
abilities of whatever is structured in the specified way. Hence,
morphological and systematic reductions (which are pretty
similar) are explanations of those abilities. Such reducing expla-
nations can themselves be of various styles. Thus, an explanation
of how thin glass fibers can be light conduits would be, I
think, borderline between morphological and derivational-
nomological. But the explanation of how DNA sites can do the
things appealed to in the replication explanation is very com-
plex; and, for all I know, it is systematic.
In explaining a system, almost all of the abilities presupposed
are abilities of individual components to interact with certain
neighboring components in specified ways. Since intricate,
interdependent organization is the hallmark of systems, the
abilities demanded of individual components are often enough
themselves rather sophisticated and specialized. Conversely,
since systems typically have abilities strikingly different from
those of any of their separate components, systematic organiza-
tion is a common source of sophisticated and specialized
abilities. These considerations together suggest that very elabo-
rate systems could be expected to have smaller systems as func-
tional components. And frequently they do - sometimes with nu-
merous levels of systems within systems. For example, a car's ig-
nition system is a component in the engine system, and the dis-
tributor system is a component in that. Such a multilevel struc-
ture of nested systems is a systematic hierarchy. (See Simon,
1969, for further discussion of hierarchical organization.)
So a systematic reduction of the highest system in a systematic
hierarchy would involve systematic explanations of the specified
interactive abilities of its functional components; and perhaps
likewise for reductions of those, and so on. Only at the lowest
level would systematic reductions be a different style of explana-
tion (typically morphological; compare the explanation of a
crankshaft or piston to that of a coffee cup). Since any scientific
reduction is also a scientific explanation, it will explicitly presup-
pose certain regularities, which can be enquired after in turn. At
any given time, however, some regularities will not be explain-
able. Modern wisdom has it that in the golden age these will in-
clude only the "fundamental" laws of physics, all others being
reducible to them (perhaps through many stages of reduction). A
sequence of reductions taking the presuppositions of an explana-
tion all the way to physics is a complete reduction. A complete
reduction of psychology is one of the dreams of unified science.
A common misconception is that reductions supplant the
explanations they reduce - that is, render them superfluous. This
is not so. Consider the fiber optics reduction. There could be any
number of different explanations for why different kinds of fibers
can conduct light; thus glass threads, with variable index of
refraction versus radius, would call for a different explanation
than hollow silver tubes. But those are irrelevant to the explana-
tion of how the bundle transmits images. The latter takes light
conduction in the fibers for granted and goes on to tell us some-
thing new. This something new would be lost if we settled exclu-
sively for explanations of light conductivity; and on the other
hand, it would not be lost (given the original morphological
explanation) even if light conductivity were totally inexplicable.
The two explanations are quite independent, even though one is
of the presuppositions of the other (compare Putnam, 1975, Ch.
14).
The main point of this section has been that reductions, like
explanations, are not all alike. Hence, the reduction of thermody-
namics cannot serve as a universal paradigm, despite its ubi-
quitous use as an example. In particular, if I am right that
Cognitivist explanation is systematic, then any reduction of
Cognitivism would be systematic reduction (a point to be taken
up further in section 5). This means at least that Cognitivists are
not interested in "psycho-physical bridge" equations (pace
Fodor, 1974), nor are they worried if none are possible (pace
Davidson, 1970).
3. Intentional interpretation
Because the study of the mind presents special scientific difficul-
ties all of its own, I have so far mentioned psychology only inci-
dentally. At the heart of these special difficulties is the problem
of "significance" or "meaningfulness." Large portions of human
behavior, preeminently linguistic behavior, are meaningful on
the face of it, and a larger portion still is "rational" or "in-
telligent" in a way that involves significance at least indirectly.
Yet meaningfulness is a slippery notion to pin down empirically,
and there are conceptual difficulties in connecting "meanings"
with the physical order of cause and effect. So serious are the
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2
217

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
problems that some investigators have even tried to study be-
havior entirely without regard to its significance, but their
achievements have been narrow and limited. Cognitivism, on
the other hand, gives the meanings of various states and
processes a central importance. In this section, I will show how
that can be compatible with the rigorous demands of empirical
science.
I take my cue from the pioneering work of Quine, and the
refinements it has inspired (Quine, 1960; Davidson, 1970, 1973;
Harman, 1973; compare also Sellars, 1963, Ch. 11; Dennett,
1971). Quine's original concern was the translation of utterances
in totally alien languages; since Cognitivism's topic is broader,
we generalize "translation" to "intentional interpretation" and
"utterance" to "quasilinguistic representation." These now must
be explicated.
Suppose we come upon an unfamiliar object - a "black box" -
which someone tells us plays chess. What evidence would it take
to convince us that the claim was empirically justified? It is
neither necessary nor sufficient that it produce tokens of symbols
in some standard chess notation (let alone, physically move the
pieces of a chess set). It is not sufficient because the object might
produce standard symbols, but only in a random order. And it is
not necessary, because the object might play brilliant chess, but
represent moves in some oddball notation.
So it is up to the person who claims that it plays chess to tell us
how it represents moves. More particularly, we must know what
in its behavior to count as its making a move, and how to tell
what move that is. Further, we must know what effects on it
count as opponents' moves, and how to tell what moves they
count as. Succinctly: we must know what its inputs and outputs
are, and how to interpret them. Note that the inputs and outputs
must be of some antecedently recognizable or identifiable types,
and the interpretations of them must be according to some an-
tecedently specifiable regular scheme; otherwise, we will
suspect that the "interpretation" is being made up along the way,
so as to make things come out right.
Of course, simply specifying the interpretation does not con-
vince us that the object really plays chess. For that we would
need to watch it play a few games - perhaps with several op-
ponents, so we're sure there's no trick. What will count as suc-
cess in this test? First, each output that the object produces must
turn out, under the specified interpretation, to be a legal move
for the board position as it stands at that time. Second, depending
on how strictly we distinguish blundering from playing, the
moves must be to some extent plausible (the hypothesis is only
that it plays, not that it plays well). If the object passes this test in
a sufficient variety of cases, we will be empirically convinced
that it is indeed a chess player.
Further, when the object passes the test, the original in-
terpretation scheme is shown to be not merely gratuitous. This is
important because, in themselves, interpretation schemes are a
dime a dozen. With a little ingenuity, one can stipulate all kinds
of bizarre "meanings" for the behavior of all kinds of objects; and
insofar as they are just stipulations, there can be no empirical
argument about whether one is any better than another. How
would you test, for example, the claims that producing marks
shaped like "Q-B2" represented ("meant"): (i) one (or another)
particular chess move, (ii) the solution of a logic problem, or (iii)
a scurrilous remark about Queen Elizabeth and Bishop Sheen?
Nothing observable about those marks in themselves favors one
rendition over another. But one can further observe when and
where the marks are produced, in relation to others produced by
the same object, and in relation to the object's inputs. If those
relationships form a pattern, such that under one interpretation
the observed outputs consistently "make reasonable sense " in
the context of the other observed inputs and outputs, while
under another interpretation they don't, then the first interpreta-
tion scheme as a whole is observably "better" (more convincing)
than the second. In our example, the pattern amounts to playing
legal and plausible chess games, time after time. None (or at
most very few) of the countless other conceivable interpretations
of the same marks would make such sense of the observed pat-
tern, so the given interpretation is empirically preferable.
The problem now is to generalize the points made about this
specific example. I believe there are principled limits to how
precisely such a generalization can be stated; but let us proceed
with a few definitions, relying on intuitions and examples to
keep them clear.
1. A set of types is uniquely determinable relative to a specified range
of phenomena iff:
i. for almost every phenomenon in that range one can unequivocally
determine whether it is a token (instance) of one of the types, and if so,
which one; and
ii. no phenomenon is ever a token of more than one type.
(Compare Goodman, 1968, Ch. 4; Quine, 1960, section 18.)
2. An articulated typology (relative to a range of phenomena) is an
ordered pair of uniquely determinable sets of types such that:
i. tokens of types in the second set (= complete types) are composed
of one or more tokens of types in the first set (= simple types); and
ii. no token of a simple type ever actually occurs in the specified
range of phenomena except as a component of a complete type.
For example, suppose a sheet of paper has a chess game recorded
on it in standard notation (and has no other markings but
doodles). Then relative to the marks on that page, the alphameric
characters of chess notation are the simple types of an articulated
typology, and the sequences of characters that would canonically
represent moves (plus odds and ends) are the complete types.
Note that definitions of complete types may include specifica-
tions of the order in which they are composed of simple types,
and that in general this order need not be merely serial.
3. An intentional interpretation of an articulated typology is:
i. a regular general scheme for determining what any token of a com-
plete type means or represents, such that:
ii. the determination is made entirely in terms of:
a. how it is composed of tokens of simple types; and
b. some stipulations about ("definitions" of) the simple types.
("Intentional" is a philisopher's term for "meaningful" or "representa-
tional.")
4. A quasilinguistic representation is a token of a complete type from
an intentionally interpreted articulated typology.
(Compare "structured description," Pylyshyn, in press.) Obviously, the
identity of a quasilinguistic representation is relative to the specified ty-
pology and interpretation, and hence also to a specified range of
phenomena. The complete types in the chess notation typology are quasi-
linguistic representations (of moves), relative to the chess interpretation.
I am unable to define either "mean" or "represent," nor say in
general what kinds of stipulations about simple types (3-ii-b,
earlier) are appropriate. In practice, however, it is not hard to
give clear intentional interpretations; there are two common
ways of doing it. The first is translation into some language or
notation that we, the interpreters, already understand. Thus a
manual might be provided for translating some strange chess
notation into the standard one. The second is giving an
"intended interpretation," in roughly the logicians' sense. Thus,
a function can be defined from a subset of the simple types onto
some domain - say, chess pieces and board squares; then the
meanings of tokens of complete types (e.g., what moves they
represent) are specified recursively in terms of this function, plus
the roles of other simple types (such as punctuation)
characterized implicitly by the recursion.
Definitions 1 to 4 were all preparatory for the following.
5. An object is interpreted as an intentional black box (an IBB) just in
case:
i. an intentionally interpreted articulated typology is specified rela-
tive to the causal influences of its environment on it - resulting quasilin-
guistic representations being inputs;
ii. likewise for outputs, relative to its causal influences on its envi-
ronment; and
iii. it is shown empirically that under the interpretations the actual
outputs consistently make reasonable sense in the context (pattern) of
218
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
actual prior inputs and other actual outputs.
(It will sometimes be convenient to use the term "IBB" on the assumption
that such an interpretation can be given, even though the specifics are not
known.) The chess player with which this section began is an IBB; so are
adding machines, logic problem solvers, automated disease diagnosers,
and (applying the definitions flexibly) normal people.
There are three problems with this definition that need im-
mediate comment. First, "making reasonable sense" under an
interpretation is not defined - and I doubt that it can be. Again,
however, it is seldom hard to recognize in practice. Often, ex-
plicit conditions can be stated for making sense about certain
problem domains or subject matters; these I call cogency condi-
tions. For the chess player, the cogency condition was outputting
legal and plausible moves in the context created by the previous
moves. For interpreting an object as an adding machine, the con-
dition is giving correct sums of the inputs; for a disease diagnos-
tician it is giving good diagnoses relative to the symptoms pro-
vided. Various authors have tried to give completely general
cogency conditions for interpreting creatures as language users
(Wilson, 1959; Quine, 1960, Ch. 2; Lewis, 1974; Grandy, 1973;
Davidson, 1973). For reasons beyond the scope of this dis-
cussion, I don't think any of these succeed. But it doesn't matter
much in actual field or laboratory work, because by and large
everyone can agree on what does and doesn't make sense.
Second, if one is knee-jerk liberal about what makes reason-
able sense, then all kinds of objects can be trivially interpreted as
IBBs. Thus, a flipped coin might be interpreted as a yes-no deci-
sion maker for complex issues tapped on it in Morse code. I will
assume that such cases can be ignored.
Third, and most serious, the requirement that inputs and
outputs be quasilinguistic representations appears to rule out
many perceptions and actions. In at least some cases, this prob-
lem can be handled indirectly. Suppose an alleged chess player
used no notation at all, but had a TV camera aimed at the board
and a mechanical arm which physically moved the pieces. The
problem of showing that this device indeed plays chess is
essentially the same as before: It must consistently make legal
and plausible moves. This succeeds, I think, because we can
give quasilinguistic descriptions of what it "looks" at and what it
does, such that if they were the inputs and outputs the object
would count as an IBB. In such cases, we can enlarge our in-
terpretation, and say that the object perceives and acts "under
those descriptions" (sees that . . . , intends that . . . , etc.), and
regard the descriptions as inputs and outputs. Where this
strategy won't work, my definition won't apply.
In this section I have addressed the question of how meaning-
fulness or significance can be dealt with empirically. In brief, the
idea is that although meaningfulness is not an intrinsic property
of behavior that can be observed or measured, it is a charac-
teristic that can be attributed in an empirically justified in-
terpretation, if the behavior is part of an overall pattern that
"makes sense" (e.g., by satisfying specified cogency conditions).
In effect, the relationships among the inputs and outputs are the
only relevant observational data; their intrinsic properties are
entirely beside the point, so long as the relationships obtain. But
the fact that they have some characteristics or other, independent
of the interpretation (that is, they are causal interactions with the
environment), means that there is no mystery about how states
with significance "connect" with the rest of nature (Davidson,
1970). The upshot is that a psychological theory need not in prin-
ciple ignore meaningfulness in order to maintain its credentials
as empirical and scientific.
4. Information processing systems
The last section showed only that there is an empirically legiti-
mate way to talk about significances in scientific theories. It did
not say anything about what kind of scientific account might deal
with phenomena in terms of their "meanings." To put it another
way, we only saw how the notion of IBB could make good em-
pirical sense, not how anything could be explained. Yet an IBB
always manages to produce reasonable outputs given its inputs;
and that's a fairly remarkable ability, which cries out for explana-
tion. There may be many ways to explain such an ability, but two
in particular are relevant to Cognitivism. One will be the subject
of this section, and the other of the next.
If one can systematically explain how an IBB works, without
"de-interpreting" it, it is an information processing system (an
IPS). By "without de-interpreting," I mean explaining its
input/output ability in terms of how it would be characterized
under the intentional interpretation, regardless of whatever
other descriptions might be available for the same input and
output behavior. For example, if our chess player is an IPS, that
means there is a systematic explanation of how it manages to
come up with legal and plausible moves as such, regardless of
how it manages to press certain type bars against paper, light
certain lights, or do whatever it does that gets interpreted as
those moves.
In a systematic explanation, the ability in question is under-
stood as resulting from the organized, cooperative interactions of
various distinct functional components, plus their separate
abilities. Further, whatever result it is that the object is able to
yield (in this case the IBB outputs), is typically delivered
directly by some one or few of the functional components. Now,
since we're not de-interpreting, those few components which
directly deliver the outputs of the IPS must have among their
presupposed abilities the ability to produce the outputs as in-
terpreted. But if attributing this ability to those components is to
make good empirical sense, then they must be IBBs themselves.
Hence the effects on them by their functional neighbors in the
system (the interactions appealed to in the explanation) must be
their IBB inputs, which means that they too are dealt with as in-
terpreted. But since these inputs are at the same time the effects
delivered by other components, those other components must be
able to deliver effects (outputs) under an interpretation. Con-
sequently, they also - and by the same argument, all the func-
tional components of an IPS - must be IBBs.
Moreover, all the interpretations of the component IBBs must
be, in a sense, the same as that of the overall IBB (= the IPS).
The sense is that they must all pertain to the same subject matter
or problem. This actually follows from the preceding argument,
but an example will make it obvious. Assuming that the chess
playing IBB is an IPS, we would expect its component IBBs to
generate possible moves, evaluate board positions, decide which
lines of play to investigate further, or some such. These not only
all have to do with chess, but in any given case they all have to do
with the same partially finished game of chess. By contrast,
components interpreted as generating football plays, evaluating
jockeys, or deciding to pull trump could have no part in explain-
ing how a chess player works.
Still, the sense in which the interpretations have to be the
same is limited. First, of course, the types which get interpreted
can vary throughout; they might be keyboard characters in one
case, electric pulses in another, and so forth. More important, the
internal "discourse" among component IBBs can be in a richer
"vocabulary" than that used in the overall inputs and outputs.
Thus, chess player inputs and outputs include little more than
announcements of actual moves, but the components might be
engaged in setting goals, weighing options, deciding which
pieces are especially valuable, and so on. Even so, they all still
pertain to the chess game, which is the important point. (The im-
portance will become clearer in section 5).
It is natural in a certain way to seek a systematic explanation of
an IBB's input/output ability. Seeing this is to appreciate one of
the essential motivations of Cognitivism. The relevant ability of
an IBB is to produce reasonable outputs relative to whatever
inputs it happens to get from within a wide range of possibilities.
In a broad sense of the term, we can think of the actual inputs as
posing "problems," which the IBB is then able to solve. Now
only certain outputs would count as reasonable solutions to any
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2
219

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
given problem, and those are the ones for which some kind of
reasonable argument or rationale can be given. (Cogency condi-
tions are typically spelled out as a relevant rationale for certain
outputs as opposed to others, given the inputs). An argument or
rationale for a solution to a problem amounts to a decomposition
of the problem into easier subproblems, plus an account of how
all the subsolutions combine to yield a solution of the overall
problem. (How "easy" the subproblems have to be is, of course,
relative to the context in which the rationale is required). The
point is that the separate IBB components of the IPS can be
regarded as solving the easier subproblems, and their interac-
tions as providing the combination necessary for coming up with
the overall solution. The interactions in general must be or-
ganized and "cooperative" (i.e., systematic) because rationale
considerations and relationships generally "combine" in com-
plexly interdependent and interlocking ways. (This is why the
systematic/morphological distinction is important.)
So, the interacting components of an IPS "work out," in effect,
an explicit rationale for whatever output they collectively
produce. And that's the explanation for how they manage to
come up with reasonable outputs; they, so to speak, "reason it
through." This also is the fundamental idea of cognitive
psychology: intelligent behavior is to be explained by appeal to
internal "cognitive processes" - meaning, essentially, processes
interpretable as working out a rationale. Cognitivism, then, can
be summed up in a slogan: the mind is to be understood as an
IPS.1
This suggestion stands on two innovative cornerstones, com-
pared to older notions about what psychology should look like as
a science. The first is that psychological explanation should be
systematic, not derivational-nomological; hence, that psychology
is not primarily interested in quantitative, equational laws, and
that psychological theories will not look much like those in
physics. The second is that intentional interpretation gives an
empirically legitimate (testable) way of talking and theorizing
about phenomena 
regarded 
as meaningful; 
hence, that
psychology does not have to choose between the supposedly dis-
reputable method of introspection, and a crippling confinement
to purely behavioral description. Together they add up to an
exciting and promising new approach to the study of the mind.
5. Intentional reduction
The abilities of component IBBs are merely presupposed by an
IPS explanation. That explanation can be systematically
reduced â in the sense of section 2, by turning one's attention to
explaining those component abilities. If it happens that the
components are themselves IPSs, then reduction can proceed a
step by appealing to the organized interactions and abilities of
still smaller component IBBs, and so on. An extension of the
argument in the last section shows that all the IBB components at
all the levels in such a hierarchy must be interpreted as having
the same subject matter; for example, all their inputs and outputs
pertain to the same game of chess, or whatever.
Obviously, then, a complete reduction down to physics (or
electronics or physiology) would have to involve some further
kind of step; that is, eventually the abilities of component IBBs
would have to be explained in some other way than as IPSs. By
definition, IPS explanation does not involve de-interpretation.
Explanation of an IBB's input/output ability that does involve
de-interpretation I call explanation by instantiation. We shall
see that instantiation has two importantly distinct forms.
An object of the sort computer engineers call an "and-gate" is a
simple IBB. It has two or more input wires, and a complete input
type is (for example) a distribution of positive and negative
voltages among these wires. It has one output wire, and is
constructed electronically to put a positive voltage in this wire if
and only if all the input voltages are positive; otherwise it puts
out a negative voltage. Now the cogency condition for a proposi-
tion conjoiner is that it give the truth-value "true" if and only if
all the conjoined propositions are true; otherwise it gives "false."
Since this truth function for "and" is isomorphic to the electrical
behavior of the object (taking positive voltage as "true," and
negative as "false"), the object can be interpreted as an and-gate.
But to explain how the object manages to satisfy the prescribed
cogency conditions, one would not look for component IBBs in-
terpretable as "reasoning the problem through." Rather, one
would de-interpret and explain the electrical behavior in terms
of the electric circuitry and components. The electrical circuit
might well be a system, but it would not be an IPS. Since the first
step of the explanation is de-interpretation, it is an explanation
by instantiation; I call it physical instantiation because the re-
mainder of it is expressed in physical terms.
Not all instantiations, however, are physical instantiations. For
example, computer-based chess players are generally written in
a programming language called LISP, in which the inputs and
outputs of subroutines are interpreted as constructing and
manipulating complex lists. So interpreted, these subroutines
are IBBs, but their subject matter is not chess. What happens,
however, is that the input/output constraints (cogency condi-
tions) on the lowest level components in the chess related
hierarchy are isomorphic to the constraints on IBBs built up in
LISP.2 Thus, the required abilities of bottom-level chessplayer
components can be explained by de-interpreting (or re-
interpreting) them as IBBs solving problems about list-
structures - IBBs which can then be understood as IPS's work-
ing through the rationale for the LISP problem. This, too, is re-
duction by instantiation, but I call it intentional 
instantiation,
because the redescribed ability is still an IBB ability, just about a
different subject matter.
Actually, in a complete reduction of a fancy computer program,
there can be several stages of intentional instantiation. Thus,
LISP languages are generally written (compiled) in still more
basic languages - say, ones in which the only IBB abilities are
number-crunching and inequality testing (the conditional
branch). The last intentional instantiation is in a primitive "ma-
chine language," so-called because that is the one which is
finally reduced by physical instantiation. The real genius of com-
puter science has been to design ever more sophisticated lan-
guages which can be compiled or intentionally instantiated in
cruder existing languages. If it weren't for intentional instantia-
tion, machines built of flip-flops and the like would hardly be
candidates for artificial intelligence.
It is easy to confuse the maneuver of explaining an IBB by
intentional instantiation with that of explaining it as an IPS. The
essential difference is the re-interpretation - or, intuitively, the
change in subject matter. Since I have already used "change of
level" to describe the move from IPS to its separate components,
I will use "change of dimension" to describe the move of de-/
re-interpretation involved in an instantiation. One can think of
the many dimensions in a sophisticated "system" as forming a
hierarchy, but dimension hierarchies should not be confused
with the earlier level hierarchies. There can be different level
hierarchies on different dimensions, but they are "orthogonal"
rather than sequential. That is, it's a mistake to think of the
lowest level on one dimension as a higher level than the highest
level on a lower dimension. Thus, an and-gate is not a higher
level component than a disk memory; they are components on
different dimensions, and hence incomparable as to level.3
The importance of keeping dimensions and levels straight is
illustrated by the following nonsequitur of Lucas' (Lucas, 1964).
Recast in our terminology, Lucas argued that Godel's incom-
pleteness result implied that the mind of a good mathematician
could not be understood as an IPS. The reasoning was that any
IPS could be simulated by a Turing machine of the sort that can
also be interpreted as proving theorems in a formal system. But
Godel proved that any formal system rich enough to include
arithmetic would be able to express truths which were not prov-
able in the system (Godel, 1931; Nagel and Newman, 1958).
220
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
Moreover, for any particular formal system, a good mathema-
tician would be able knowingly to construct such a truth - which
the corresponding theorem-proving Turing machine in principle
could not do. Hence, for any given Turing machine, a good
mathematician can do something which the former cannot, and
therefore they cannot be the same. The error here is in neglect-
ing that an interpretation of an object as a mathematician and an
interpretation of it as a theorem-proving Turing machine would
be on vastly different dimensions. The outputs put forward as
proofs and truth claims on one bear no interesting relation to
those put forward on the other.
In this section, I have outlined what a reduction of cognitive
psychology to the relevant physical dimension theory would
look like. I have not argued that Cognitivism per se is committed
to such reducibility. It would be theoretically consistent to main-
tain that at some bottom level the presupposed IBB abilities
were simply not explainable (much as physics cannot explain its
fundamental laws). Nevertheless, I suspect that many investiga-
tors would strongly resist such a suggestion, and would feel their
work was not done until the reduction was complete.
6. Fallacious supporting arguments
In sections 1 through 5,1 have given a general characterization of
the Cognitivist approach to psychology, and its possible reduc-
tion. In so doing, I have shown how it is innovatively different
from earlier approaches more captivated by the image of physics,
and how it can be unimpeachably rigorous and empirical all the
same. However, it seems to me that the eventual success of this
program, for all its attractiveness, is still very much in doubt. In
the remaining three sections, I hope to make clear my reasons for
caution - taking as much advantage as possible from the explicit
characterization just completed. I will begin in this section by
pointing out the flaws in two seductive general arguments to the
effect that some Cognitivist theory or other must be right.
The first argument is directed more specifically at the
systematicity cornerstone, though as we have seen, the two
cornerstone innovations go hand in hand (see the end of section
4). It goes like this: we know that the nervous system is com-
posed of numerous distinct and highly organized "functional
components" - namely neurons; and (assuming materialism)
there is every reason to believe that the human IBB is somehow
instantiated in the nervous system. So, all that remains to be
found are how the neurons are grouped into higher level
components, how the first instantiation proceeds, how the lowest
components on that dimension are grouped into higher
components, what the next instantiation is, and so on. That is, we
need only "build back up" the intentional and systematic reduc-
tions described in sections 2 and 5, until we reach the overall
IBB. That's an enormous task, of course, but since we know there
are organized components at the bottom, we know in principle it
can be done.
Formally this argument is circular; the reductions mentioned
in describing the "building back up" presuppose the very
systematicity that the argument is supposed to prove. But the
idea behind the reasoning is so attractive that it is tempting to
think that the circularity is an artifact of the formulation, and that
a better version could be found. To see that this is not so, we
must expose in detail the real basis of the formal circularity.
As we observed in section 1, scientific explanation is
essentially a route to understanding; and the understanding is
achieved in part through specifying certain features and regu-
larities that are common to the range of situations where that
kind of explanation applies. The demands of rigor and explicit-
ness that distinguish some explanations as scientific require that
the features and regularities specified "encompass" or "encapsu-
late" every consideration that is relevant to understanding the
phenomenon being explained. In a way, the explanatory insight
derives precisely from the realization that these few specific fea-
tures and regularities are all you need to know, in order to be
sure that phenomenon Y will occur; everything else is ex-
traneous. Thus, the beauty of Newton's mechanics is that a few
parameters and equational laws encapsulate everything that is
relevant to the motions of a great many bodies. For example, the
colors, textures, personalities, and so on of the planets can all
safely be ignored in predicting and understanding their positions
as a function of time.
In a systematic explanation, a comparable encapsulation is
achieved in the specification of a few determinate modes of
interaction among a few distinct components with particular
specified abilities. Indeed, finding interfaces among portions of
an object, such that this kind of encapsulation is possible, is
the fundamental principle of individuation of functional
components - and hence a sine qua non of systematic explana-
tion. For example, dividing the interior of a radio (or engine) into
adjacent one-millimeter cubes would not be a decomposition
into functional components; and the reason is exactly that the
resulting "interfaces" would not yield any dividend of encapsu-
lating what's relevant into a few highly specific interactions and
abilities. By contrast, a resistor can be a functional component,
because nothing about it matters except the way it resists the
flow of electricity from one of its leads to the other. (Of course,
resistors ought not to melt, multiply, or eat diodes, but such in-
junctions are relevant not so much to how the radio works as to
how the various components maintain their required abilities;
i.e., they are a concern of reduction.)
So if neurons are to be functional components in a physio-
logical system, then some specific few of their countless
physical, chemical, and biological interactions must encapsulate
all that is relevant to understanding whatever ability of that
system is being explained. This is not at all guaranteed by the
fact that cell membranes provide an anatomically conspicuous
gerrymandering of the brain. More important, however, even if
neurons were components in some system, that still would not
guarantee the possibility of "building back up." Not every
contiguous collection of components constitutes a single com-
ponent in a higher level system; consolidation into a single
higher component requires a further encapsulation of what's
relevant into a few specific abilities and interactions - usually
different in kind from those of any of the smaller components.
Thus the tuner, pre-amp and power amp of a radio have very nar-
rowly specified abilities and interactions, compared to those of
some arbitrary connected collection of resistors, capacitors, and
transistors. The bare existence of functionally organized neurons
would not guarantee that such higher level consolidations were
possible. Moreover, this failure of a guarantee would occur again
and again at every level on every dimension. There is no way to
know whether these explanatory consolidations from below are
possible, without already knowing whether the corresponding
systematic explanations and reductions from above are possi-
ble - which is the original circularity.
The second argument I will refute starts from the top rather
than the bottom, and is directed primarily at the intentional in-
terpretation cornerstone, with its associated idea of "working out
the rationale." Formally this argument amounts to the challenge:
What else could it be? - but it is much more persuasive than that
brazen rendition suggests. If one disregarded the intentional in-
terpretation of any sophisticated IBB, it would be quite incredi-
ble to suggest that there was some elegant relation between the
particular set of influences from the environment that we call
inputs, and the particular set of influences on the environment
that we call outputs. The relevant actual pattern can hardly even
be described except in some way that is tantamount to specifying
the cogency conditions which the object in fact meets. But since
what we observe is that the object consistently meets these
otherwise quite peculiar conditions, and since the conditions
themselves are typically made explicit by spelling out some ra-
tionale, what else could explain the observations than that the
object works the rationale out? How else would it happen to
come upon those particular outputs time after time?
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2
221

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
To show that a "what else could it be?" argument is inconclu-
sive one need only come up with a conceivably viable alterna-
tive; one need not make a case that the alternative is in fact more
probable, just that it's viable. I will try to construct such an al-
ternative, drawing on recent neurophysiological speculations
about holographic arrangements and processes (van Heerden,
1968; Pribram, 1971, 1974; Pribram, et al., 1974; Pollen and
Taylor, 1974). Fairly detailed hypothetical models have been
proposed for how holograms might be realized in neuronal struc-
tures (Kabrisky, 1966; Baron, 1970; Cavanagh, 1972); and there is
some empirical evidence that some neurons behave in ways that
would fit the models (Campbell, 1974; Pollen and Taylor, 1974;
and compare Erickson, 1974).
Optical holograms are photographs of interference patterns,
which look kind of like the surface of a pond that has just had a
lot of pebbles thrown in it. But they have some interesting
properties (Leith and Upatnieks, 1965; Herriott, 1968; Cathey,
1974). First, they are prepared from the light bouncing off an or-
dinary object, and can subsequently be used to reconstruct a full
three-dimensional colored image of that object. Second, the
whole image can be reconstructed from any large enough portion
of the hologram. (That is, there's no saying which portion of the
hologram "encodes" which portion of the image). Third, a
number of objects can be separately recorded on the same holo-
gram, and there's no saying which portion records which object.
Fourth, if a hologram of an arbitrary scene is suitably illuminated
with the light from a reference object, bright spots will appear in-
dicating (virtually instantaneously) the presence and location of
any occurrences of the reference object in the scene (and dimmer
spots indicate "similar" objects). So some neurophysiological
holographic encoding might account for a number of perplexing
features of visual recall and recognition, including their speed,
some of their invariances, and the fact that they are only slightly
impaired by large lesions in relevant areas of the brain.
What matters to us is that a pattern-recognizer based on these
principles would not (or need not) be an IPS. There are no dis-
tinct functional components whose relevant interactions are
confined to intentionally interpreted articulated typologies. That
is, there is nothing going on which can be regarded as "working
out a rationale" with quasilinguistic representations. By contrast
a typical computer-based pattern-recognizer is an IPS. Thus,
searching for discontinuities in luminance gradients, proposing
that they are edges, checking for connexity among proposed
edges, hypothesizing invisible edges so as to complete coherent
objects, and so on are all rational procedures relative to the
"problem" of identifying objects (see, e.g., Minsky and Papert,
1972).
The neurophysiologists cited have rightly confined their
speculations to recognition and recall processes, because there
one at least has shreds of evidence to work with. (But see Yevick,
1975, for a mathematician's tentative proposal of a holo-
graphically based "logic") We, however, who are answering a
"what else could it be?" argument needn't be so circumspect.
Another interesting property of optical holograms is that if a
hologram of two objects is illuminated with the light from one of
them, an image of the other (absent) object appears (Gabor, 1969;
Firth, 1972). Thus, such a hologram can be regarded as a kind of
"associator" of (not ideas, but) visual patterns. So imagine a set of
such associated patterns, in which the first member of each is a
common important substructure in chess positions, and the other
is one or two moves which are generally powerful or dangerous
around such structures. It seems to me that a set-up like that
could be a nearly instantaneous "plausible move generator" for
chess positions in general. In fact, it would mesh nicely with
much of what is known about how human chess players perceive
the board and their options (de Groot, 1965; Hearst, 1967; Frey
and Adesman, 1976). Moreover, I don't see why ramification and
complication of similar arrangements couldn't yield an object
which generated actual moves. (How, after all, do masters play
"three-second" chess when there's practically "no time to
think?") Implementation of such a device by known optical
means would be difficult or impossible, but I think it fair to point
out also some limitations of the analogy. Optical holograms are
all two-dimensional and static, whereas the brain is three-dimen-
sional and dynamic. Who knows what could happen among
holograms in intersecting planes, or even decomposed into dots
and scattered about in volumes - especially if they dynamically
modified one another in nonchaotic ways? Not so many years
ago, no one could have imagined, except with the vaguest
handwaves, what two-dimensional static holograms can do.
Perhaps living brain homograms could do much more.
Again, the plausible move generator (or even whole chess
player) that I have speculatively outlined would not be an IPS.
Nothing in it "reasons through" the various possible moves and
countermoves which would constitute the rationale for the le-
gality and plausibility of the resulting output. It does not even
contain a representation of the rules of the game, which would
be unthinkable in a chess-playing IPS. But a chess player is a
paradigm example of the kind of case to which the "what else
could it be?" argument was supposed to apply. (Indeed, it's no
accident that this example was so expositorily convenient in sec-
tions 3 through 5). I therefore take that argument to be refuted. I
am not envisioning, of course, that humans (chess players in-
cluded) engage in no cognitive "reasoning a problem through";
introspection, for all its ills, is enough to scotch that. But cogni-
tive psychology is exciting and important for the unobvious
thesis that cognitive information processing can explain much
more than deliberate cogitation and reasoning; and for that larger
thesis, the argument considered is inconclusive.
This last observation should put the whole present section in
perspective. All I claim is that a few commonplace assumptions
will not suffice to demonstrate that Cognitivism is the right ap-
proach to psychology. That should offend no one, since it only
means that the position is not trivial and obvious - as clearly it
isn't.
7. Potentially serious hurdles
In this section, I want to mention three issues which it seems to
me may be serious hurdles for Cognitivism â serious in the sense
of being equally hard to duck or get over. They are: moods, skills,
and understanding. I cannot prove that Cognitivist accounts of
these phenomena are impossible. My aim is rather to show that
such accounts are going to be required if Cognitivism is to suc-
ceed, and that it's dubious whether they will be possible.
I will try to illustrate the nature of the difficulty with moods by
contrasting it with another, which is superficially similar but
more plausibly duckable. There is a long and tortured tradition
in philosophy for distinguishing two kinds of mental phenom-
ena: roughly, cognitive or intellectual states vs. felt qualities or
the purely sensuous given (see Sellars, 1963, ch. 5, for a dis-
cussion of this distinction in the context of a different issue).
Paradigm "felt qualities" would be pains or mere awarenesses of
present red (not categorized or conceptualized as such). Several
recent articles have argued that such states have some kind of de-
terminate immediate character which is independent of any in-
terpretation and/or any role in a systematic organization (Shoe-
maker, 1975; Block and Fodor, 1972; but see Dennett, forthcom-
ing). It would follow that they do not accord with the Cognitivist
notion of a mental state or process.
But without even taking sides on the particular issue, I think
we can see that it doesn't matter much to Cognitivism - which is,
after all, only a theory of cognitive states and processes. In other
words, if felt qualities are fundamentally different, so be it;
explaining them is somebody else's business. This amounts to a
kind of "segregation" of psychological phenomena, along
roughly traditional lines. Such segregation can be legitimate (not
a fudge) given one important assumption: Segregated noncogni-
tive states can be effective in determining intelligent behavior
222
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
only insofar as they somehow generate quasilinguistic repre-
sentations ("red there now," "left foot hurts") which can be ac-
cepted as inputs by the cognitive IPS. This assumption is plausi-
ble enough for felt qualities, and perhaps for some other states as
well. I have in mind the much disputed "mental images"
(Shepard and Metzler, 1971; Pylyshyn, 1973, in press; Paivio,
1975; Kosslyn and Pomerantz, 1977; Dennett, forthcoming).
Since any Cognitivist theory must include some mechanism for
getting from retinal images to cognitive descriptions of what is
seen, I don't see why that same mechanism couldn't also take
inputs from some precognitive visual "tape recorder" (perhaps
one with "adjustments" for orientation, size, and location). Then
playbacks from the recorder would have whatever nondiscur-
sive, "image-y" quality perception has, and Cognitivism would
be unruffled.
But I am much less sanguine about a similar segregation for
moods. The difference is that moods are pervasive and all-
encompassing in a way that felt qualities and images are not. The
change from being cheerful to being melancholy is much more
thorough and far-reaching than that from having a painless foot to
having a foot that hurts. Not only does your foot seem different,
but everything you encounter seems different. The whole world
and everything in it, past, present, and future, becomes greyer,
duller, less livable. Minor irritations and failings are more con-
spicuous and less remediable; ordinary things are no longer fun,
lovely, or pleasing. If melancholy were an input representation
("melancholy here now") it would have to accompany and infect
every other input, and transform the meanings of them all. But
moods not only affect how things look, they affect how one
thinks. What seems reasonable when you're cheerful seems
foolish when you're melancholy, and vice versa. Likelihoods and
improbabilities invert, as do what seems relevant to an issue and
what seems beside the point.
Moods come upon us, but they are neither direct observations
nor inferences. Many things affect our moods, but our moods also
affect how things affect us; and in neither case is it quasilin-
guistic or rational. We do not state or believe our moods, or jus-
tify them on the basis of evidence or goals; they are just the way
things are. In sum: Moods permeate and affect all kinds of cogni-
tive states and processes, and yet, on the fact of it, they don't
seem at all cognitive themselves. That suggests, at. least until
someone shows otherwise, that moods can neither be segregated
from the explanation of cognition, nor incorporated in a
Cognitivist explanation.
The second hurdle I want to mention concerns skills. I see
three pritna facie (not conclusive) reasons for doubting that the
etiology of skillful behavior is cognitive. First, with rare excep-
tions, articulate ness about a skill, no matter how detailed nor in
what specialized quasilinguistic notation, is neither necessary
nor sufficient for having it; it always takes practice, and often
expert examples and talent (^ intelligence). Even a Rhodes
scholar could not learn to play good ping-pong just from listening
to thousands of detailed lectures about it; and even a Rhodes
scholar ping-pong champion might be hard pressed to give a
single detailed lecture on the subject. Second, a person who is
acquiring or upgrading a skill may deliberately and thoughtfully
try to execute certain maneuvers, but the thought and delibera-
tion cease at just about the time the maneuvers become skillful
and "natural"; the expert doesn't have to think about it. Third,
skillful activity is faster than thought. Not only do skilled typists
and pianists not have to think about what they're doing with their
fingers; they can't. If they turn their attention to their fingers, as a
novice must, their performance slows down and becomes
clumsy, rather like a novice's.
A Cognitivist can explain these phenomena away by postulat-
ing some "unconscious" information processing which is
somehow more efficient than, and immiscible with, that con-
scious thinking which is archetypically cognitive. But Dreyfus
asks an interesting pointed question about this ploy, in the spe-
cial case of chess skills (Dreyfus, 1972, p. 18). It is known that
intermediate, advanced, and great chess players are alike in
consciously considering on the order of a hundred plays in think-
ing out a move; they differ in their "skill in problem conception"
(de Groot, 1965) - i.e., in preselecting which moves to think
about. Now the rationales for these good preselections would be
enormously long if they were spelled out (many thousands of
plays). It's possible that players have some marvelously efficient
unconscious information processor which works through these
rationales; but if so, then why would anyone with such a
splendid unconscious ever bother to deliberate consciously and
tediously over a hundred plays? The implication is that the skill-
ful preselection and the tedious cogitation differ not just in
efficiency and consciousness, but in kind, and that neither could
adequately substitute for the other. I think it would take power-
ful arguments (or prejudices) to outweigh this natural construal
of the evidence - and only slightly less so in the case of skills in
general.
But so what? If skillful behavior has to be explained in some
non-Cognitivist way - call it "X" (maybe something to do with
holograms) - then why not employ the segregation strategy in-
troduced above for felt qualities and images? I think the danger
here is not that the segregation strategy wouldn't work, but that it
might work too well. "Skill" is such a broad and versatile notion
that all kinds of things might fall under it. For example, the
ability to act appropriately and adroitly in various social situa-
tions is a sort of skill, as is the art of conversation, and even
everyday pattern recognition; moreover, these are like our ear-
lier examples in that, to whatever degree one has mastered the
skill, one needn't think about it to exercise it. But if very many
such things turned out to be explainable in way X, rather than as
the abilities of an IPS, then cognitive psychology would narrow
dramatically in scope and interest. In the worst case, little would
remain to call "cognitive" except conscious deliberation and rea-
soning - and that's hardly news.
The third hurdle I want to raise for Cognitivism is understand-
ing; but this needs immediate qualification. In one sense, IPSs
undoubtedly can understand, because computers programmed to
be IPSs can do it. We could build a chess player, for example,
that "understands" entered moves in any of three notations.
What that means is that it responds appropriately (sensibly) to
inputs in any of those forms. This is the same sense in which
existing programs "understand" selected English sentences
about colored blocks (see e.g., Winograd, 1972; and compare
Greeno, 1977), airline reservations, and what not. Such usage is
perfectly legitimate, but it's not all there is to understanding.
There is another notion of understanding, which, for con-
venience, I will call "insight" into why certain responses make
sense, or are reasonable. As any teacher of arithmetic or logic
knows, many students can learn the routines for getting the right
answers, without the slightest insight into what's going on. And
when original scientists struggle to find new and better threories,
they grope for new "insights" into the phenomena, or new ac-
counts which "make sense." Whether or not a new account,
perhaps expressed in an unprecedented formulation, makes
sense or is intelligible, is something which great scientists (and
then their colleagues) can "just tell." Of course, whether an ac-
count is scientifically acceptable also depends on how well it ac-
cords with observations; but that does not determine whether it
makes sense in the first place - both are necessary in science.
The ability to tell when a whole account, a whole way of putting
things, makes sense, is what I mean by insight.
The intelligibility of the whole account (or way of talking) then
determines which particular utterances make sense, and what
sense they make. Thus, it is only because quantum mechanics is
an intelligible theory that one can make sense of talking about
the wavelength of a particular electron (but not about the rest
mass of a photon). And this brings us back to the conditions on in-
terpreting something as an IBB. The testable requirement is that
individual outputs make sense in the context of prior inputs and
other outputs. But what determines which outputs would and
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2
223

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
would not make sense in which contexts? That is, what de-
termines which overall patterns render their constituents intelli-
gible under an interpretation, or which input/output constraints
count as cogency conditions? I have said that in appropriate cir-
cumstances, people can "just tell"; they can come to understand
insightfully.
This is not to say that insight is itself some "transcendental" or
impenetrable mystery, which we are forever barred from
explaining. But once we appreciate that it is a genuine problem
we can ask whether an IPS explanation could account for it.
Now, we can understand how an IPS comes up with the reason-
able outputs that it does, because we know how it works; in
particular, we know that it works through a rationale for each
output, and we know that it makes sense to say this of it because
each of its interacting component IBBs consistently accords with
certain cogency conditions. If we did not have that kind of a story
to tell, then we would have no IPS explanation of the overall
IBB's abilities.
So if an IPS explanation is to account for an object's having
insight, then there must be a rationale for the insightful outputs.
More specifically, if the insight is that certain new constraints
constitute a kind of cogency, then there must be a rationale, ac-
cording to the kind of cogency that the object and its components
already exhibit, for why the new conditions count as cogency
conditions. It seems to me that there could be such a rationale
only if the new conditions were equivalent to, or a special case
of, the established ones. For example, there could be no ra-
tionale according to chess player cogency conditions for why ad-
ding machine outputs make sense, or vice versa. If this is right,
then an IPS with general insight into what makes sense would it-
self have to operate according to some cogency conditions that
are ultimately general (so that the others which it recognizes
could be given rationales as special cases).
There are two reasons to doubt that human insight can be
explained that way. First, there is a sense in which it would pre-
clude any radically new ways of understanding things; all new
developments would have to be specializations of the an-
tecedent general conditions. But I think the invention, say, of
derivational-nomological explanation (around the time of Gali-
leo) did comprise a "radical" advance in ways of understanding,
in just the sense that the cogency of the new accounts could not
be defended with a rationale which was cogent by prior stan-
dards. Medieval Aristotelians had explained (and understood)
the motions of various kinds of bodies in terms of their efforts to
get where they belonged, and their thwarting of each others' ef-
forts. Galileo, Kepler, Newton, et al., didn't simply add to or
modify those views. They invented a totally new way of talking
about what happens, and a new way of rendering it intelligible;
mathematical relationships and operations defined on universal
measurable parameters became the illuminating considerations,
rather than the goals and strivings of earth, air, fire, and water. I
don't think a medieval IPS could have come to understand the
new theory unless it had had it latently "built-in" all along. The
same would be true of every IPS child who comes eventually to
understand science, the arts, politics, and so on.
The second doubt has to do with this latent building-in -
essentially, the ultimate general cogency conditions. We really
have no reason to believe that there is any final characterization
of what it is to make sense, except that it would facilitate a tidy
account of intelligence. Barrels of philosophical ink have been
spilt in the search for it, but so far without success. People who
regularly make convergent decisions about the reasonableness of
theories and interpretations don't explicitly work through ra-
tionales for their judgments. So we're back to postulating some
mysterious and magnificent unconscious IPS. But once we admit
that the phenomenon of insight is simply mysterious and
unexplainable at present, then all we have to go on are the prima
facie indications that IPS explanation is inadequate to the task.
In this section I have raised three issues which it seems to me
Cognitivists must face, and which it is not yet clear they can
handle. It is of course possible that successful treatments will
eventually be found. On the other hand, if the approach is
doomed to failure, I suspect that these are tips of some of the
icebergs on which it will founder.
8. The state of the art
Needless to say, the eventual fate of cognitive psychology will
be settled empirically - not by "armchair philosophizing." But
the way in which experimental results bear on scientific theories,
let alone whole approaches to the form that such theories should
take, is seldom straightforward. In this concluding section, I will
venture a few general points about Cognitivism and its relation
to empirical observations.
It is illustrative to begin with cognitive simulation, a subdis-
cipline where cognitive psychology overlaps with artificial in-
telligence. A generation ago, the prospect of building intelligent
computers inspired a lot of enthusiasm and brilliant work; but
everyone must agree that results to date fall well short of early
expectations. General problem solving programs have long since
hit a plateau. Mechanical language translation has proven so elu-
sive and frustrating that even military funding has dwindled. Ad-
vances in pattern recognition are painfully small, and still
confined to contrived special "universes." Even game playing, a
relative bright spot, is a disappointment against once confident
hopes and predictions. About the only thing which exceeds
original forecasts is the amount of computing power which has
become available - and yet isn't enough. Does all this constitute
an empirical refutation of the possibility of artificial intelligence?
Not at all.
Perhaps the lesson is just that the problem was initially
underestimated; soberer judges are now gratified by smaller
steps in a longer trek, and disillusioned pessimists may still be
exposed as carpenters who blamed their tools. On the other
hand, if there were indeed something fundamentally misguided
about the whole project, then recurrent bottlenecks and modest
sparse successes are just what you would expect. The empirical
record is simply ambiguous, and the real problem is to wrest
from it whatever moral it does hold, as clearly and as helpfully
as possible.
Cognitive simulation is not merely an incidental offshoot of
cognitive psychology. It is a powerful and important research
tool, because it provides a new and unprecedented empirical
testing ground. Any IPS, or at least any one which is reducible to
some level or dimension on which component input/output func-
tions are expressible mathematically, can in principle be simu-
lated on a computer. That means that simulations can function as
concrete checks on whether particular proposed IPSs in fact
have the abilities which they are supposed to explain. This is
valuable when the proposed explanations are so complex that it
is otherwise practically impossible to determine whether the
things would actually work as claimed. In effect, the computer
makes it feasible for Cognitivist theories to be more intricate and
complicated than their predecessors could be in the past, and
still remain under detailed empirical control.
By the same token, however, computer simulation serves as
the front line where fundamental difficulties not resolvable by
further complication would first show themselves. This is not to
say that psychological experiments, and programmatic theories
formulated with their guidance, are beside the point; quite the
contrary, they form an essential high-level ingredient in the
whole endeavor. But if one were genuinely to entertain the
hypothesis that Cognitivism is misconceived, then the stumbling
blocks empirically discovered by cognitive simulationists
would be the first place to look for clues as to what went wrong.4
How else than by struggling to build chess players could we
have found out so definitively that the skill of deciding which
moves to consider is not a simple matter of a few readily as-
certained heuristics? What laboratory experiment could have

THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
shown more clearly than the mechanical translation effort that
the hardest thing to account for in linguistic performance is
understanding what the discourse is all about?
If Cognitivism proves to be the wrong approach after all (that's
still a big "if," of course), then the genius who makes the next
basic breakthrough in psychology will probably take his or her
cue from difficulties like these. Empirical indications of what
cannot be done often pave the way for major scientific progress;
think of efforts to weigh phlogiston, to build a perpetual motion
machine, or to measure the speed of the Earth through the lu-
miniferous aether.
A sense of history can give us perspective in another way.
Until the rise of Cognitivism, Behaviorism reigned almost un-
challenged in American psychology departments. It could boast
established experimental methods, mountains of well-confirmed
and universally accepted results, specialty journals carrying
detailed technical reports, texts and curricula for teaching
people to read and write those reports, and a coherent
"philosophy" within which it all fit together and seemed
inevitably right. In short, it had all the institutional earmarks of
an advanced and thriving science. In retrospect, however, Be-
haviorism seems to have made little positive contribution to our
understanding of the human psyche, and to be hopelessly inade-
quate to the task.
Kuhn's notion of a scientific paradigm can be extended in a
way that sheds light on a situation like this (Kuhn, 1962). A para-
digm is a major scientific triumph, so impressive in breaking new
ground, and yet so pregnant with unfulfilled possibilities, that a
technical research tradition coalesces around it as a model. Thus,
the achievements of Thorndike and Pavlov inspired a vigorous
and sophisticated investigation of the conditioning of birds,
dogs, and rats - and also of people, to the extent that they are
similar. But most of the interesting and important aspects of in-
telligent behavior, exhibited especially by humans, turn out to
involve processes qualitatively different from those discovered
by Thorndike, Pavlov, and their followers. So when Behaviorism
was taken as an approach to psychology in general, its paradigm
became a kind of impostor; experiments, concepts, and methods
which were genuinely illuminating in a limited domain posed as
the model for illumination in a quite different domain, where
they had virtually no demonstrated credentials, and really didn't
belong.
Cognitivism is a natural development from Behaviorism. It
retains the same commitment to publicly observable and
verifiable data, the same rejection of posits and postulates that
cannot be treated experimentally, and the same ideal of
psychology as a natural science. Its advantage is having shown,
via the systematicity and intentional interpretation "cor-
nerstones," how to make good empirical sense of meaningful or
rational internal processes - which gives it a much richer and
more powerful explanatory framework. And not surprisingly, it
has now acquired the institutional earmarks of an advanced and
thriving science. But cognitive psychology too can be accused of
having an impostor paradigm. The concrete achievements which
inspire the notion of IPS explanation, and prove it to have ap-
plication in the real world, come originally and almost entirely
from the fields of computer science and automatic data process-
ing. The few cases in which people explicitly and deliberately
work through a rationale do suggest an analogy; but so did the
cases in which people responded to conditioning.
Like their predecessors, Cognitivists have made undeniably
important and lasting discoveries. But also as before, these dis-
coveries are conspicuously narrow, even small, compared to the
depth and scope of psychology's pretheoretic purview. The
brilliance of what has been done can blind us to the darkness that
surrounds it, and it is worth recalling how many shadows
Cognitivism has not (yet) illuminated. How is it, for example,
that we recognize familiar faces, let alone the lives reflected in
them, or the greatest of Rembrandt's portrayals? How do we
understand conversational English, let alone metaphors, jokes,
Aristotle, or Albee? What is common sense, let alone creativity,
wit, or good taste? What happens when we fall asleep, let alone
fall under a spell, fall apart, or fall in love? What are personality
and character, let alone identity crises, schizophrenia, the
experience of enlightenment, or moral integrity? We turn to
psychology if we think these questions .have scientific answers;
and if we shouldn't, why shouldn't we? Cognitivists are as vague
and impressionistic on such issues as psychological theorists
have always been. Of course, they too can buy time with the old
refrain: "be patient, we're only just beginning (though so-and-
so's preliminary results are already encouraging)." Promissory
notes are legitimate currency in vigorous sciences, but too much
deficit spending only fuels inflation.
The human spirit is its own greatest mystery. Perhaps the idea
of an information processing system is at last the key to unlock-
ing it; or perhaps the programmable computer is as shallow an
analogy as the trainable pigeon - the conditional branch as
sterile as the conditioned reflex. There is no way to tell yet, but
we should be as ready to follow up on partial failures as we are
on partial successes. The clues could be anywhere.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
In preparing this paper I have incurred more of a debt than I can properly
express to the inspiration and constant guiding criticism of H. L. Dreyfus.
I am also thankful to several students and colleagues for directing my at-
tention to weaknesses in earlier drafts (some of which, no doubt, remain) -
especially Bob Brandom, Dan Dennett, Jay Garfield, Allan Gibbard, Bill
House, and Zenon Pylyshyn. Finally I am grateful to the University of
Pittsburgh Faculty Grants Committee for research support during the
summer of 1975.
NOTES
1. For readers familiar with the work of Quine, I would like to clear up
what I think is a common misunderstanding. Quine is a Behaviorist of
sorts, and he sometimes seems to defend that on the basis of his doctrine
of the indeterminacy of translation (Quine, 1960, Ch. 2). Thus, it's natural
to suppose that Cognitivism is as opposed to the latter doctrine as it is to
Behaviorism. It isn't. In the terminology of this paper, Quine's claim is the
following: For any IBB, there are many different intentional interpreta-
tions of the same input/output typologies, which are all equally "good" by
any empirical tests; that is, they are all such that the outputs consistently
make reasonable sense in context. Hence, one's "translation" of the inputs
and outputs is empirically indeterminate, at least among these options.
Now, it might seem that if the IBB were an IPS, and if one knew what it
was "thinking" (its internal cognitive processes), then one could de-
termine what its outputs really meant, and thereby undercut the indeter-
minacy. But if Quine is right in his original claim (and I take no stand on
that), then it applies to the interpretations of the component IBBs as well.
Thus the indeterminacy, rather than being undercut, is just carried in-
ward; in Quine's terms, all the translations are "relative to a translation
manual." That would no more rule out Cognitivism than it would linguis-
tics.
2. Strictly, the required relation between the two sets of constraints is
weaker than isomorphism. It suffices if every input/output pattern which
would satisfy the explained constraints on the lower dimension would
also satisfy the cogency conditions on the interpretation being reduced
(the constraints on the upper dimension). This amounts to saying that the
instantiation can explain more than the IBB ability in question - e.g., not
only how it manages to play chess, but also why it always neglects certain
options.
3. To my knowledge, Dennett has made the fullest previous attempts to
explicate intentional reduction, but they seem to me incomplete. In an
early paper (Dennett, 1971), he distinguished the "intentional stance"
(having to do with interpretation and meaning) and the "design stance"
(having to do with systems engineering). But his examples suggest that in
the design stance one attends to the instantiating physical system, while
in the intentional stance one attends to the overall IBB - leaving out
entirely the crucial notion of an IPS. In a later paper (Dennett, 1975), he
effectively remedies this by introducing "committees of homunculii"
(essentially bureaucracies of IBBs; see my metaphor in section 1). Then
by suggesting that each homunculus should be analyzed as a committee of
stupider homunculii, until the stupidest can be "replaced by machines,"
he has what amounts to an intentional reduction. But he still lacks the dis-
tinction of dimension and level, and hence the notion of intentional
instantiation.

4. One of the special merits of Dreyfus' "critique of artificial reason"
(Dreyfus, 1972) is his attempt to gain some positive insights from the
tangle of frustrations that have bedeviled cognitive simulation. See his
pioneering effort (Ch. 1) to extract some order from the apparent chaos, via
the four distinctions: fringe consciousness vs. heuristically guided search;
ambiguity tolerance vs. context-free precision; essential/inessential dis-
crimination vs. trial and error search; and perspicuous grouping vs.
character lists.

On inference from input/output. 
My only justifications for commenting on
the abstruse paper of Haugeland are, first, that it is a basic aim of this journal
to get people to tread in each other's territories, and, second, that the paper
is, presumably, trying to help those, like myself, who have tentative working
models of the mind.
Stripped of its philosophical dressing, the paper seems to be offering as a
central concept the IBB, or meaningful black box. The IBB is characterized
by its outputs' making "reasonable sense" in terms of its histories of inputs.
According to Haugeland, this reasonable sense "is seldom hard to recog-
nize in practice," although he gives no black box or cognitive examples of its
truth. Yet, in the case of quite simple black boxes, whose structures and func-
tions are really unknown (i.e., black), there are tremendous difficulties in de-
riving structural models that make reasonable sense of behaviors. Quite
small amounts of memory and indeterminacy generate great difficulties in

Commentary/H&ugel&nd: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
neuropsychology and neurophysiology. At the cognitive level, even the na-
ture of the inputs and the outputs of the system are in question. In synthesiz-
ing a model of the mind, we have to work up from the structural information
and down from the behavioral information, making inspired guesses as to
how they may be related. Simplification, the essence of understanding, can
result both from reduction to structure and from reduction to behavior. As our
models improve, vague terms like mood, feeling, insight, intuition, under-
standing, intelligence, and so on, will be replaced by more definite ones. In
so far as Cognitivism recognizes the need to take into account the states of a
system as well as its input/output behavior, few would exchange it for be-
haviorism. However, Haugeland seems to be suggesting by his IBB that we
can test the validity of some proposed state-transition structure solely by
means of input/output behavior (i.e., input from the environment and output to
the environment). Common experience with quite simple systems (like
someone else's electronic circuit!) indicates that this is not so.
Perhaps I am saying no more than that it is unreasonable to expect to be
able to define "a specified range of phenomena" in which sets of input types
and output types are "uniquely determinable" in the way required by Hauge-
land for his first step in constructing an IBB. The weakness of his behaviorist
assumption that everything can be derived from input and output is well
illustrated by his "hurdles" of mood, skill, and insight. So long as one
neglects to use knowledge of internal states (derived from physical and
chemical measurements and controls), as in Haugeland's construction of an
IBB, subconscious activity of the mind, which accompanies everything we
do, is bound to invalidate our explanations. What remains when moods, skills
and insight are left out?

On making distinctions that are not maintained. Haugeland's paper ap-
pears to be a textbook example of the sort that convinces scientists (mis-
takenly, I would insist) to conclude that philosophers have nothing of value to
say to them. The author intends to give a critique of cognitivism in
psychology and philosophy. He does not discuss even one example of a
cognitivist analysis of some intelligent behavior - the closest he comes is the
observation that programming a computer-based chess player in LISP is a
nonphysical instantiation. His one example of a noncognitivist analysis is a
fanciful "holographic chess-player" - hardly reassuring to the scientist since
(a) it ignores the strategic elements of the game and speaks only of recogniz-
ing situations; and (b), with some eminent exceptions, most neuroscientists
regard the holographic "model" of the brain as being, at best, only a weak
metaphor. Sections 1 to 5 are devoted to the making of distinctions that are
little used in the critique proper (sections 6, 7, and 8), that ride roughshod
over the reality of current scientific methodology and that are not equipped
with proper delimiting criteria. All that one needs from these sections is an
understanding of Haugeland's slogan that "Cognitivism is the position that
mind is to be understood as an IPS." Before explaining this, let me devote
four paragraphs to these distinctions that Haugeland makes but does
not/cannot maintain.
Section 1 offers a sharp distinction between 
derivational-nomological
explanation (Newton's laws), morphological 
explanation (replication of
DNA), and systematic explanation (explaining the behavior of a system in
terms of its functional components). What I object to is the suggestion that
these are almost exclusive styles of explanation, when, in fact, the three can
occur in virtually any combination. Using Newton's laws to analyze a ball
rolling on a surface requires morphological constraints; analysis of DNA con-
formation involves physics as much as bell-and-stick chemistry; and a
system theorist analyzing an ecological system may well use differential
equations to predict system behavior. Haugeland admits the distinctions
may be somewhat blurred, but makes them so that he can restrict cognitivism
to systemic explanation. We shall return to this point (good for philosophy,
bad for science?) below.
Section 2 argues that a scientifically respectable reduction need not be a
reduction to physics modelled on the statistical reduction of thermody-
namics to mechanics. As a computer scientist, I certainly agree-a
program's function is independent of the physical implementation of the ma-
chine language functions. This is probably the argument that satisfies many
cognitive scientists. However, as a neuroscientist I must take issue with this
form of of cognitivism, for the style of certain types of human cognition may
well depend on the fact that they are implemented in a brain made of
components susceptible to the action of hormones, and there may be no
satisfactory reduction that does not take this chemical activity (that is, the
fine details of circuit-level implementation) into account.
Section 3 labors mightily to define an IBB (intentional black box). This is
simply a black box in which the inputs and outputs can be described in some
symbolic notation that a human being can interpret in such a way that "it is
shown empirically that under the interpretations the actual outputs
consistently make reasonable sense in the context (pattern) of actual prior
inputs and other actual outputs." The author does not know of any criteria for
deciding when a BB is I, shrugging it off with ". . . it doesn't matter much in
actual field or laboratory work, because by and large everyone can agree on
what does and doesn't make sense. . . . If one is knee-jerk liberal about what
makes sense then all kinds of objects can be trivially interpreted as IBBs . . .
[but] I will assume that such cases can be ignored." One hopes that this
"Y'know what I mean?" style of definition will not catch on. The upshot of the
section is what every system theorist knows - a respectable theory can (and
usually does) assign interpretations to the inputs and outputs of a system. In
fact, the judicious choice of such an interpretation is usually the first step in
successful systems analysis.
Section 4, recalling that a systematic explanation shows an ability as
resulting from the organized cooperative interactions of various functional
components, specifies further that an IBB is to be called an IPS (information
processing system) if it can be systematically explained without "deinter-
preting it; for example in a chess program, each functional component must
be doing something chess-like (e.g., exploring moves) rather than nonchess-
like (e.g., printing out marks that can be interpreted as signalling a move).
Section 5 notes that repeating such reductions must eventually lead to
components for which in further reduction deinterpretation must take place-
Haugeland calls this instantiation. This instantiation is physical when the
functional components are expressed in physical terms; intentional when the
functional components are IBBs involving a different subject matter. Note
well, then, that a typical computer program is not an information processing
system in Haugeland's sense since it involves deinterpretation into the level
of the programming language. One hopes that this "inconsistent with normal
usage" style of terminology will not catch on.
Back to Haugeland's summary of cognitivism in the slogan "the mind is to
be understood as an IPS." The translation is as follows: "Cognitivism
analyzes the mind as a system composed of functional components in which
the inputs and outputs of the system itself and of these components fal I under
a common intentional interpretation. Further reduction may be possible
under this interpretation, or may require new interpretations or the transition
to a physical level of description."
Section 6 correctly notes that the structural composition of the brain as a
network of neurons does not guarantee that these neurons are organized into
subsystems that admit intentional interpretation (though, of course, the
possibility that they do provides a variety of subgoals for the neurosciences).
It then offers the hologram metaphor to show that a system need not proceed
by explicitly working out the rationale for its actions. The defects of holo-
graphy as a brain model do not vitiate its use as a debating point, but I do
want to note one apparent weakness in Haugeland's analysis. He talks as if a
functional component must also be a structural component. An associative
memory might well be analyzed into subsystems suited to recognize posi-
tions of pieces, special configurations, and sequences of moves - and so be
an IPS-even if these functions are implemented in overlapping networks.
The deinterpretation need only occur at another level down the reduction
hierarchy.
At this stage I must make a confession of ignorance. I do not know what
"cognitivism" is. I do know what might be called "cognitive simulation" - the
use of programs modelled on those of artificial intelligence to explain
phenomena in cognitive psychology (See Pylyshyn et al., BBS 1:1). I believe
that this approach is a fruitful one, but that evolutionary and pharmacological
considerations must be used to enrich it, as must the "derivational-nomo-
logical" techniques of mathematical system theory. Thus in approaching the
final section of Haugeland's paper, I must look at three questions. (1) Since I
do not know what cognitivism is, does it equal "cognitive simulation?" (2)
Are Haugeland's discussions of limitations of cognitivism philosophically
compelling? (3) Are there scientific reasons to reject pure cognitivism?

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
In section 8, Haugeland talks as if cognitive simulation were what his
paper was about. Yet I wonder if his notion of an IPS really squares with work
in that area. In Samuel's (1959, 1967) checkers-playing program, the adjust-
ment of weights is a crucial feature of the learning procedure and seems to
provide a successful model of skill acquisition. Yet, in section 7, Haugeland
spells out his doubts that "the etiology of skillful behavior is cognitive," list-
ing this as one of three hurdles for cognitivism. Now I agree that skillful be-
havior is not cognitive in Haugeland's sense, but I argue that Samuel's
checker-player is (or can be the basis for) an excellent example of cognitive
simulation. Thus Haugeland's notion of cognitivism is too impoverished to in-
clude cognitive simulation.
Haugeland's argument against cognitivism in section 7 is that moods,
skills, and understanding are hard to implement as IPSs. In section 8 he
argues that cognitive simulation has reached a plateau. But, in fact, A.I. is
making great progress with "understanding," and cognitive simulation, if
expanded to include identification/parameter adjustment methods, can ad-
dress many problems of skills. It may well be true that Haugeland-sense
cognitivism cannot, though I am not sure that his "I don't see how to do it"
arguments carry much philosophical weight.
This brings me to the close. The philosopher may ask "Can cognitivism
explain the mind?" and the scientist may ask "Should I restrict myself to
cognitivism in explaining the mind?" I am all for scientific pluralism, believ-
ing that we poor mortals must specialize in our choice of problems and tools
to solve them. I do not think many cognitive psychologists would choose to
be cognitivists in Haugeland's sense, but many will choose to use cognitive
simulation as an explanatory tool. Some will choose to ignore system theory
and neuroscience (inter alia) in their own work, others will insist that these
are irrelevant to all of cognitive psychology. I understand the strategic deci-
sion of the former and reject the dogmatism of the latter. Accepting Hauge-
land's examples, I expect that neuropharmacology will play a central role in
the analysis of mood, and that biomechanics and control theory will be cou-
pled with the theory of adaptive networks in the analysis of skills. But for the
study of understanding, I think cognitive simulation is the current best bet.
These are not philosophical judgments, but a personal opinion on allocation
of scientific resources.

The scope of cognitivism. Defenses of cognitivism, that in the long run strike
me as more harmful than helpful, have quite often embodied two general at-
titudes toward the theory being defended. The first is that cognitivism not
only represents an alternative that is an advance over previously existing
theories like behaviorism, but that it also constitutes a unique alternative, so
that to reject cognitivism is to throw psychology back into the dark ages of
behaviorism. The second attitude, which provides in some sense a reason for
the first, is that the description of mental processes provided by cognitivism
is the only way in which it is plausible to imagine a mind can work. Thus we
must either describe the mind as an Information Processing System or give
up hope of explaining how it works. What seems to me to be the strength of
Haugeland's position is that he shows it is possible to accept the
cognitivist's claim to offer a psychological theory that is an advance over be-
haviorism, while still suggesting that cognitivism may turn out to be a limited
theory in the way behaviorism did. Thus, Haugeland encourages us to look in
a positive light at the problems that exist for cognitivism as problems that
should encourage us to go forward and not to go back.
The strength of cognitivism, as Haugeland states it, is that it legitimates an
explanation of mental events and processes in mental terms. It encourages
us to think that we can answer questions like "Why did the chicken cross the
road?" in terms of thought, plans, hopes, desires, and other states and
processes belonging to and ascribable to the chicken. Our explanation of its
road-crossing will mention the various things that make this activity mean-
ingful to the chicken. Such an account is scientifically respectable because,
while the inputs to and the outputs from the chicken cannot tell the whole
story of why it crossed the road, they nevertheless constitute good empirical
evidence for the rest of the story by serving as evidence for the various
mental events we ascribe to the chicken to fill in the gap between input and
output. The weaknesses of the cognitivist story stem from the fact that
cognitivism makes very stringent demands on what kind of mental life can
appropriately be postulated to fill the gap. The assumption is that the be-
havior in question can be explained only if it can be accounted for as the
result of some sort of information-processing or hypothesis-testing. In
general, as Haugeland points out, the input must be assumed to be able to
take the form of data posing a problem, and thus must assume some sort of
quasi-linguistic nature, must be assumed to be able to take the form of a so-
lution to the problem, and the postulated mental states must be assumed to
be able to take the form of steps or calculations in the solution of the problem
from the data. But the difficulty is that on this account every mental state must
turn out to be some sort of proposition and every mental process some sort of
calculation. Anything that does not immediately fit this model must either be
assumed not to be mental, not to deserve a psychological explanation, or to
be jammed willy-nilly into the model. And this either requires us to refuse to
call some things mental that otherwise seem to deserve psychological expla-
nation or else dictates that an explanation take what can seem to be a highly
unnatural form.
I think Haugeland is quite right that moods and emotions are generally
very much the kinds of things that we would like to be able to explain in
mentalistic terms. Being in love is not explicable in terms of dispositions to
approach the beloved object; being fearful is not just the disposition to
avoid. As is the case with other mental states, moreover, we want to be able
to attribute the emotion to the organism, to say the emotion belongs to it. Nor
are moods quite so free from evidential support as Haugeland suggests. It
has been pointed out that it is possible to argue about the appropriateness of
a mood, to say, for example, "you ought not to be afraid of the big dog." But
cognitivism is unwilling to talk about the presence of events in a mind except
insofar as the events give rise to quasi-linguistic representations or to
beliefs. Yet there seem to be distinctions between having a mood and beliefs
about that mood, as indeed there are between things like being conscious of
a scene or a throbbing in the temples and having beliefs about any of these
things. Still, it seems hard to understand in what sense one is said to be hav-
ing the mood, or the throbbing in the temples, or awareness of the scene
without these things being represented to one, without their being present in
some form or other in one's mind. Thus it is hard to understand in what sense
one is thought to have a sensation in a prerepresentational form. On the other
hand, it seems clear that no linguistic description can capture the scene or
mood of which one is aware, or that the awareness can be identified with a
set of beliefs about what one is aware of. Thus it seems to me that sensations
have more in common with moods than Haugeland allows and that, in both
cases, a decision not to count them within the domain of psychology is un-
satisfying. It seems clear that things like sensations and moods do serve as
input for us, just as do thoughts and beliefs, and so it seems to me not at all
clear that it is correct to select just one mode of input as relevant to
psychology, even though we have a way of describing thoughts and beliefs -
quasi-linguistic representation - which is not so obviously available for
moods and sensations.
The reason it is thought to be necessary to reduce all forms of input to
quasi-linguistic representations, even in cases where such representations
seem to fall far short of what is actually available (such as "left foot hurts" or,
presumably, "pang of love here now", is that there otherwise seems to be no
way to show how inputs can enter into the calculations that are thought to
constitute the only possible description of mental processes. But, as Hauge-
land and many others have pointed out, requiring a description in terms of
calculating results is assimilating all mental skills and process to that of de-
liberation and reasoning. And certainly many skills, from typing to chicken-
sexing to chess-playing do not seem to involve deliberation and calculation.
Thus it looks as though cognitivists have simply selected one kind of skill,
deliberation, as previously they had sleeted one form of input, and have
insisted that all other skills unconsciously conform to this model, when con-
sciously they do not. But, of course, what the cognitivist wants us to recog-
nize is that the apparent lack of calculation always stems from the fact that
we have not as yet developed an explanation for how the skill is performed.
This is because the cognitivist feels the explanation is incomplete without
the calculation; we have not explained, for example, how faces get
2 2 8

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
recognized, until we have shown exactly what information about faces could
be considered available and exactly what calculations are involved in reach-
ing the conclusion that this is a face.
But it may well be that all skills necessarily appear to take the form of cal-
culations, not because calculating is any more than any other method, ob-
viously the way we do things, but because calculating has a significant
place in the way we usually explain things. We do not think we have ade-
quately justified some conclusion until we have explained the reasons for
holding it. But there is no particular reason why the process of reaching a
conclusion should be the same as the process of justifying that conclusion.
And, moreover, even if we accepted the model of justifying a conclusion as
the model to use in interferring unconscious mental states and processes,
Haugeland shows in his discussion of understanding that what actually goes
on when we seek to devise an explanation is not at all like the cut and dried
process that is assumed to be taking place internally. Devising conditions of
cogency for an explanation is quite often a part of developing an explana-
tion, and conditions of cogency will change as discoveries shed new light on
the nature of problems. Therefore, it seems extremely unlikely that there
should be one unique method of constructing a chain of reasoning that is the
method belonging to us, psychologically speaking, and coded in us to de-
termine the course of our mental processes.
What is attractive about cognitivism is that it shows that it is not out of the
question to develop theories about the mind's using mental terms, in which
we can use our experience of minds to devise these theories. But if we pay
attention to what actually goes on in one's mind and to the kinds of skills one
possesses, there seems no particular reason to believe that the information
processing model is the only nonbehaviorist model available.

On explanation, holograms, moods, and skills. Haugeland has done an ad-
mirable job of presenting the nature of cognitivism and the cognitive ap-
proach to understanding brain function. Although I agree with most of his
points, there are a few to which I must take exception.
Haugeland first discusses three styles of scientific explanation: deductive-
nomological 
(including derivational-nomological), morphological, and
systematic. He claims that "only the systematic style is directly relevant to
Cognitive Psychology." I disagree. Haugeland's major emphasis is
concerned with the mathematical style employed by physicists ("Thus the
charge of slavishly imitating mathematical physics does not apply to
Cognitivism. . . ."), and not the discrete mathematics of computer science
(automata theory, formal language theory, symbol manipulation systems,
etc.). Computer scientists have long been concerned with computation
theory, what can and cannot be computed, how fast various computations
can be performed, and the correctness of the algorithms of computation. The
computation theoretic style of explanation, when applied to computational
systems, is deductive-nomological. Furthermore, the brain shares more of
the features of a computational system (computer, automata, formal lan-
guage, etc.) than it does of a physical system. In particular, cognitive
psychologists talk of memory, information, computation, learning, and con-
trol just as do computer scientists. I therefore suggest that Haugeland should
not rule out the deductive-nomological style of explanation of cognitive
psychology. But I agree that "slavishly imitating mathematical physics" is
not the thing to do.
Another recent formalism that appears to have great promise is the simula-
tion formalism currently being developed by Rieger and Grinberg (1976).
This formalism enables a precise description of complex systems and of
interactions between system components, and it also appears to be the
framework for deductive-nomoiogical explanation of systematic behavior. If I
am correct, then, proof techniques, to be developed and applied to such
descriptions, may be a formalism that is badly needed in cognitive
psychology.
In section 6 of his paper, Haugeland argues that there is in reality no proof
that a cognitive approach to understanding brain function will ultimately suc-
ceed. He brings into his arguments a discussion of several "holographic"
models of memory. I want to emphasize that the holographic models, along
with other models for storage, are generally proposed as associative storage
networks. These models account for some behavioral aspects of brain func-
tion (association [recognition] and forgetting the typical), but almost any
model for associative storage would account for the same aspects of be-
havior. One should not think of the holographic models as any more than they
were intended to be: plausible mechanism for storage, association, and re-
call of information. They are not general models of brain function: in fact, they
are far from it. Behavioral properties that may be discussed by the model
builder, such as learning, deduction, and forgetting, are not generally de-
pendent on the fact that the storage process is holographic. In fact, many of
the properties of optical holograms (three-dimensional reconstruction, pre-
servation of color, resistance to damage, etc.) are not directly relevant to the
neural models. In summary, one must study each model to determine exactly
which properties are ascribed to the storage mechanism, and which
properties to the control mechanisms of the storage system (when to store in-
formation, where to store it, whence to recall information, etc.). Otherwise, the
confusion that results negates the usefulness of the model as an explanation
for the particular function of interest. Haugeland's mention of the holographic
models, followed by a discussion of a plausible move generator for a chess
player, unfortunately distorts rather than clarifies the role of the holographic
memory models.
Haugeland makes one point that merits further discussion. He states,
"Optical holograms are two-dimensional and static, whereas the brain is
three-dimensional and dynamic." In order to make any sense of such a state-
ment, one must interpret "static," "dynamic," "two-dimensional," and "three-
dimensional."An 
optical 
hologram 
is static: once 
photographically
developed, the distribution of silver densities across the hologram is fixed.
The same is most likely true of the permanent memory traces of experience in
the brain: once the neural parameters, whatever they are, are established
and fixed during consolidation, they become static. Although there is no
direct proof that memory traces of experience are permanent, the work of
Penfield and Roberts (1959) and Penfield and Perot (1963) certainly sug-
gests that they are. When Haugeland uses the term "dynamic," he is either
referring to the fact that information patterns in the brain are conveyed by ac-
tive patterns of neural activity, or he is suggesting that there are no
permanent memory traces in the brain. If the reference is to active patterns of
neural activity, then there is a direct analogy with the optical systems. The
light pattern that illuminates and interacts with the hologram to produce the
reconstructed wavefront is dynamic. In each case, a static pattern (distribu-
tion of silver intensities, neural parameters) is used to convert a dynamic pat-
tern (the incident light wave, a neural discharge pattern) into another dy-
namic pattern (the synthesized wavefront, the recalled neural firing pattern).
Finally, if Haugeland uses the term "dynamics" to refer to the very complex
way that information is routed and processed within the brain as an informa-
tion processing system, then the comparison is unfair. The holographic
aspect of the memory models was concerned only with the storage and syn-
thesis processes of memory, not with the more complex control processes
that must take place. In summary, the statement that holograms are static
while the brain is dynamic does not make sense.
My next comment is on the concepts of two- and three-dimensional
processing systems. There are both two- and three-dimensional holograms.
Van Heerden's (1963) method of optical information storage is three-dimen-
sional and holographic, although he did not use that terminology. Three-
dimensional holograms have been used for storing moving images by
continuously changing the angle of the reference wave during the storage
and recall processes, and they have been used for storing multiple images in
the same film. In contrast, there is no conclusive evidence that the brain is a
three-dimensional information processing system analogous to the three-
dimensional storage system of van Heerden. (Note that Beurle, 1956, one of
the earliest neural modelers, viewed the brain as a three-dimensional
storage medium and proposed a storage system analogous to van
Heerden's.) Information in the brain progresses through layers of neurons,
and each layer performs its specific transformation on the input pattern. It is
just as likely that this is a sequence of two-dimensional transformations as it
is a sequence of three-dimensional transformations. In summary, the im-
portance of the three-dimensional nature of the brain is not yet known, and it
may have very little to do with the particular process being performed.
My final comments relate to the serious hurdles proposed by Haugeland. I
do not share his concern about the difficulty of discovering a cognitive (func-
tional) basis for moods. Let me first posit that perception is dependent on
past experiences and how they relate to current events. If the behavior of our
memory stores (including the storage mechanism, the association
mechanism, the recall mechanism, and the control mechanisms) is
systematically modified, then our perceptions will also be altered. The state-
dependent learning studies presented by Overton (1965) may be an extreme

2 2 9

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
experimental example of such chemically induced alterations. Modification
that can result in such state-dependent phenemona can be induced in al-
most every current model of memory by systematically changing some of the
coupling parameters between cells in the memory stores. In the model I
proposed (1970 op. cit.) for information storage and association, for
example, one need only reduce all excitatory coupling coefficients by a
reasonable percent to see this effect. (Reducing both excitatory and inhibi-
tory coupling coefficients proportionately does not produce the effect.) If
moods are related to brain chemistry, and there is certainly reason to believe
they are, and if brain chemistry is related to neural coupling parameters, then
one would expect systematic modifications due to the chemistry of moods to
alter our current perception.
The relationship between skills and other behavior is also easy to explain
with a cognitive model. A very brief explanation goes something like this:
One of our memory systems contains premotor patterns that are invoked and
executed during skillful behavior. These premotor patterns are learned
(stored and then modified) by repetitive conscious practicing of the skill.
" When these premotor patterns are consciously generated for the first time,
they are stored in a memory system for later invocation. The memory traces
are adaptive, and each time the skill is practiced, the stored premotor pat-
terns are recalled and executed (described below). The conscious correc-
tions to the induced movements that result in the more skillful behavior are
used to modify the memory traces, thereby encoding the corrected premotor
patterns. Learning a skill means the process of storing and modifying the
premotor patterns necessary to perform the skill. Once the skill is learned,
performing the skill is accomplished by invoking the proper sequence of
stored premotor patterns. Invoking a premotor pattern means recalling it from
memory and executing it. Executing a premotor pattern means the
transformation of the premotor pattern into the final sequence of efferent
signals necessary to perform the skill. This transformation may involve com-
pensation for such things as speed of execution, specific forces necessary at
the current time to perform the act (such as playing a piano having a heavier
touch than the one used for practice), compensating for other current
systematic irregularities, and so forth. One such systematic irregularity oc-
curs when you speak with your teeth held together. The efferent patterns
required for vocalization are very different than they are for ordinary vocaliza-
tion. Execution of the premotor speech pattern consists in part of transform-
ing it into the correct efferent pattern to the speech musculature to produce
the desired speech sounds.
Unfortunately, insight is one process for which I have no reasonable cogni-
tive explanation, although I do not doubt for a minute that one exists.

How to register dissatisfaction with A.I. Ever since the beginnings of
Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), there have been attempts to show that the funda-
mental goal of the field, the creation of an intelligent computer, is impossi-
ble. Being a specialist in A.I., I view Haugeland's paper as a fairly typical
contribution to this literature.
There is one innovation, however, that I regard as positive, since it seems
to be leading in the direction of a calmer and more considered analysis of
the issues. Strictly speaking, Haugeland is not discussing whether or not
computers can behave intelligently, but rather the tenability of a particular
view of intelligence, which he calls "Cognitivism." Cognitivism, as he sees it,
holds that the mind can be understood as a system (i.e., it operates through
the interaction of conceptually distinct subsystems) and furthermore, that the
subsystem interactions must be understandable at a suitably high level of
abstraction. Thus, a computer that talks because it knows about words and
their meanings would fit under this definition, but one that talked by, say, do-
ing a quantum mechanical simulation of a person would not. Hence there is
no necessary connection between the possibility of intelligent computers
and the success of Cognitivism. Nevertheless, Haugeland would claim, and
quite correctly, that A.I. as currently practiced is committed to Cognitivism
and hence must stand orfall with it. The advantage of this shift in emphasis is
that it removes the argument from the domain of A.I. (a notoriously con-
troversial field) and emphasizes instead the strong links connecting A.I. with
cognitive psychology and, although the author does not mention it, much of
linguistics as well.
This discussion, as well as that dealing with the relation between
Cognitivism and other kinds of explanation (in particular, reductionism),
strikes me as quite reasonable. But this analysis is meant to be in the service
of the second half of the paper, Haugeland's attack on Cognitivism in general
and A.I. in particular, and here is where things go astray. The problem is that
there are only occasional links between the two halves of the paper. Instead,
we get, in the three concluding sections, three of the traditional objections to
A.I.: 1) there is no proof that its assumptions are correct, 2) there exist prob-
lems with no obvious solutions, and 3) A.I. has been disappointing when
compared to early predictions. In the remaining space, I will try to indicate
why I (and, I suspect, my colleagues) do not find his objections persuasive.
The first of these points simply leaves me baffled. Why would anyone think
that there ought to be a "correctness" proof for cognitivism, or any other para-
digm (in Kuhn's sense; 1962 op. cit.)? Buried in any scientific discipline
there are assumptions about what the world is like. In physics, for example,
we assume that the world consists of particles and forces between them (or
some such). These assumptions are never capable of proof and, in fact, are
often found to be false. Cognitivism is neither better nor worse than any other
science in this respect. A more interesting issue is the plausibility of the
assumptions behind Cognitivism. I would be prepared to argue intheirfavor
(the rest of the body is organized like a system; why not the brain?), but this
would take us far beyond the current paper.
As for the second point, Haugeland sees three tough problems as casting
doubt on the cognitive enterprise: moods, skills, and insights. Moods, I
would argue, should be separated from A.I. and cognitive psychology, and
the fact that Haugeland sees no way to do this does not bother me. I can
fantasize several, but more importantly, I do not see moods as so pervasive
in the tasks of importance to A.I. at this time. For example, moods have
minimal influence on how I do pronoun reference, or how I distinguish my
telephone from my briefcase. These are currently important problems: why
things at times seem less livable is not. As for skills, the entire argument
seems to rest on the observation that these are not open to conscious in-
trospection, neither in the way they are learned (by practice, not by reading)
nor in the way they are described (with difficulty), nor while being executed.
But what is this supposed to prove? Nothing in the definition of "Cognitivism"
says anything about the processes' being conscious, and quite rightly so.
Furthermore, there is work in the A.I. literature to suggest that skills are
amendable to cognitive techniques (see Stallman and Sussman on skill ac-
quisition). Concerning "insight," it depends on what one means by the term.
Sometimes Haugeland seems to mean "deep understanding," as when he
comments that "many students can learn the routines for getting the right
answers without the slightest insight into what's going on." We might
imagine, for example, a computer that, given the input currents, can calcu-
late what will happen in an electronic circuit, but that cannot say what any
part of the circuit "is for." The trouble with this example is that there are pro-
grams that can do both. At other times, Haugeland refers to the insights be-
hind major discoveries. While it is true that programs have not made any
major discoveries, the traditional assumption in A.I. is that this is a difference
of degree, not kind. (This is not obviously true, but neither is it obviously
false. Furthermore, there has been some relevant work, Lenat, 1977. His
program starts with very general knowledge about sets and about what
makes something "interesting," and it comes up with, among other things,
prime numbers. This, of course, hardly scratches the surface, but it does sug-
gest that the problem is not unsolvable.)
As for the last criticism of Cognitivism, stagnation compared to early
A.I. predictions, this argument accomplishes nothing, aside from raising the

blood pressure of A.I. types. That A.I. has not been able to solve in twenty
years problems that have been around for 2,000 is not surprising. If Hauge-
land had claimed, instead, that A.I. had not made any significant progress in,
say, the last five years, that would be relevant, but, I think, false. (In
particular, his claim that there has been no progress in general problem-
solving is demonstrably false.) This debate is hard enough without bringing
in points that sound impressive, but are of no relevance.
One problem is that it is never clear in a debate like this what the op-
ponents would take as a rebuttal of their positions. From my own point of view
I can see that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for Haugeland to
change my mind. As he comments, to any problem he brings up. I will simply
respond "Give us time." But I wish to claim that this is, in fact, responsible
scientific practice. Scientists, as Kuhn has noted, never abandon a paradigm
unless there is another waiting to take its place. Currently there is no plausi-
ble replacement for Cognitivism, so neither I nor my colleagues will give it
up.
But this is not to say that the debate need be pointless. Paradigms do
change and they change because one or a few scientists are dissatisfied
with the current one. What Haugeland must do is provide enough evidence to
convince a few that a shift is needed. But this evidence must be much more
specific than vague comments about the problem of emotion, or the lack of
progress in A.I. Haugeland must, in effect, become a specialist in A.I. He
must be able to sit down with researchers and go over computer listings in
order to find out why a program does as well as it does, or why not, and then
using such specific, detailed information, wind a web of dissatisfaction that
will eventually lead to a new Copernicus turning our intellectual world on its
head. Quite frankly, I doubt that this will occur, because I really do believe in
Cognitivism. But if this debate is to go further, it must be at this detailed level.
It is simply the nature of science.

Systems and cognitive capacities. 
Haugeland tells us that cognitive
psychology stands on two cornerstones: that psychological explanation
should 
be 
systematic 
(in 
Haugeland's 
special 
sense), and that
psychological states/processes should be characterized (via intentional in-
terpretation) in terms of their symbolic content (Heston, 1977). This, I think, is
quite right, though I would restrict these observations to the explanation of
cognitive capacities: cognitive psychology need not be represented as
claiming the whole field (see Fodor, 1975 last chapter). In what follows, I
will concentrate on a certain claim Haugeland makes about the explanation
of such capacities. I hope to show that the notion of a cognitive capacity and
the correlative notion of an IBB (something that has a cognitive capacity) is
as yet too fuzzy to bear the weight Haugeland sometimes put on it.
Haugeland criticizes the thesis that the only explanation of something's
having a cognitive capacity (being an IBB) is that it cogitates (as I will
say) - that is, it produces its behavior by, in part, "figuring out" how to satisfy
the cogency conditions definitive of the capacity in question. Putting aside
the possibility of inexplicable cognitive capacities, the thesis Haugeland at-
tacks comes to this: Nothing that does not cogitate can have a cognitive ca-
pacity. Haugeland's argument goes like this: Something might have a cogni-
tive capacity-be an IBB-yet not have "distinct functional components
whose relevant interactions are confined to intentionally interpreted articu-
lated typologies." Such a device would not cogitate, that is, would not
produce outputs by working out a rationale for them. Thus, we cannot move
from the fact that the input-output conditions of an IBB are given by specify-
ing the conditions under which each (interpreted) output would be cogent to
the conclusion that an IBB produces its output on any given occasion by
working out which output would be cogent on that occasion. In short, some-
thing can have a cognitive capacity and yet not cogitate.
I have italicized a description of the move on which I want to concentrate.
How is this supposed to follow from what precedes it? Haugeland plainly
regards this question as trivial. Having envisioned a hologram-based pat-
tern-recognizer, he remarks:
"What matters to us is that a pattern recognizer based on these principles
would not (or need not) bean IPS. (1) There are no distinct functional
components whose relevant interactions are confined to intentionally in-
terpreted articulated typologies. That is, (2) there is nothing going on here
which can be regarded as "working out a rationale" with quasi-linguistic
representations. Section 6; the numbers in parentheses are mine.)"
From this, it is obvious that Haugeland regards (2) as a gloss of (1). This, I
think, is a mistake: An IBB might satisfy (1) and fail to satisfy (2), that is, it
might cogitate even though it has no IBB components at all. I shall give this
claim a name-the Weak Thesis - because I want to distinguish it from a
Strong Thesis that I suspect is true, but will not argue for, that is, that every
IBB cogitates under some interpretation or other. The Weak Thesis is cer-
tainly true if the Strong Thesis is true, for there are certainly IBBs that have no
IBB components, for example, a simple diode AND-gate. But investigation of
the Strong Thesis would be a major undertaking, so I will restrict my attention
here to the Weak Thesis.
If the Weak Thesis is true, then Haugeland's notion of an IPS is ambiguous.
Something that cogitates, but satisfies (1) is, in an obvious intuitive sense, an
information processor, but not a system (of IBBs). What we should like to
mean by an IPS, I think, is an IBB that cogitates because it is a system of
IBBs, that is, an information processor that performs its task by executing a
rationalizing program whose subroutines are executed by component IBBs.
The Weak Thesis can be established by exhibiting a "simple" IBB - that's an
IBB having no IBB components - that cogitates (executes a rationalizing
program). The fanciful mechanical devices typically described in the course
of introducing the concept of a Turing Machine seem fairly clear examples
(See Davis, 1958, chapter 1). Consider the Turing Machine Z defined by Ta-
ble 1. Z computes x +y as follows:
Input: write x + 1 ones followed by a blank ("B") followed by y +1 ones on
Z'stape.
Output: total number of ones on Z's tape at stop.
Start: set Z in s -1 reading the left-most one.
Anything realizing Z will execute the program given by the flow chart in
- Figure 1. It seems evident that executing this program counts as constructing
an output satisfying the cogency conditions for addition, and therefore
cogitates. Any IBB that executes the program cogitates and is therefore an
information processor in my sense. But a realization of Z need not be an IPS:
it could be a simple IBB in just the way a typical AND-gate is. All this re-
quires is that there be no proper components whose special business is to
execute particular instructions in the program. And all that requires is that the
states specified in the transition table should be states of the whole device
(i.e., there is no saying which components of the device mediate which tran-
sitions). As an example, consider a beaker containing two immiscible
chemicals, A and B, B being much heavier than A. Ones are represented by
type-x tablets, blanks by type-y tablets. Tablets are insoluble in layer B, into
which they sink if not dissolved in layer A. At the start, layer A is capable of
dissolving one type-x tablet. Further x-tablets sink into layer B. A y-tablet re-
stores layer A to its original condition. We provide input by linking up tablets
in a track and tipping them one at a time into the beaker. The output is given
by the number of tablets left i n the bottom of the beaker.
It seems pretty clear that this device is an IBB (an adder) that cogitates
(executes chart I) but has no IBB components. To deny this, one would have
to argue that (i) the device has IBB components, or that (ii) the device does
not cogitate. To press (i) is to risk trivializing the notion of an IBB. I cannot

prove this - perhaps layer-B is a "memory," though there is no retrieval - by I
do not think I need to. Turing machines evidently need not be systems of
IBBs any more than an AND-gate. (ii) is rather more subtle. There will doubt-
less be some who will hold that the beaker-device does not execute chart I,
or at least not in the "right" sense, that is, a sense in which executing chart I
would "really" be "working out a rationale" or "figuring out the answers." I
think that the sense in which the beaker-device executes chart I is the only
one in which program execution makes clear sense in this context: given the
required interpretations, it is nomologicaily necessary that the device do
what the chart says to do. Having already aired my views on this (1977), I will
not pursue the matter here. If these points seem controversial, it is because
the concepts of a cognitive capacity and of "working out a rationale" (cogi-
tating) that are central to the cognitivist strategy are still very fuzzy at their
edges - too fuzzy, I think, to bear the weight Haugeland put on them in sec-
tion 6 of his paper.
A final word about the significance of all this. If the Weak Thesis is true,
then "cognitivism" should not be thought committed to the view that the mind
is a system of IBBs (an IPS). Cognitive psychologists attempt to explain an
organism's cognitive capacities by appeal to the hypothesis that nervous
systems execute certain programs, that is, by appeal to the hypothesis that
they cogitate. This in itself does not imply that nervous systems are in-
terpretable as systems of IBBs.
This is as it should be: cognitive theories no doubt give the nervous system
lots of distinct cognitive jobs to do (assume lots of distinct cognitive ca-
pacities), but surely such theories need say nothing about whether or how
these jobs can be delegated to physically distinguishable components. If the
Strong Thesis is true, then the serious question cannot be whether organisms
cogitate (whether they execute programs) but how (which programs they
execute). Haugeland seems to think this trivializes cognitive psychology.
That seems to me like saying we trivialize mechanics when we give up
wondering whether motion is law-governed and concentrate instead on figur-
ing out what the laws are. To suppose that organisms exercise their cognitive
capacities by cogitating is not to speculate on the etiology of behavior, but to
assume that its cogency is not ultimately mysterious.

Co-opting holograms. This paper usefully dispels some of the aura of inevi-
tability that surrounds much of the enthusiasm for cognitive science today.
Even if, as is often said, cognitive science is the only game in town or the
only well developed research program in psychology with a prayer of suc-
cess, it might, for the sorts of reasons Haugeland cites, still turn out to have
been a perniciously seductive dead end. Haugeland says, correctly, that the
best antidote to the "what else could it be?" defense is a sketch of a "con-
ceivably viable alternative." I wish Haugeland had been able to come up
with something more conceivably viable than a hologram-inspired hunch.
Holograms are marvelous information-storers and (in a restricted sense) in-
formation-transformers, and perhaps could be harnessed, as Haugeland
suggests, as powerful content-driven associators or address-finders, but so
far as we know now, that is the extent of their powers, and what we need are
ways of getting information processed in a much more dramatic sense; an
army with high-fidelity holographic maps of the battlefield does not yet have
a battle plan, and what no one (so far as I know) has yet suggested is how to
get holograms to turn the afferent-efferent corner and do the work cognitive
science supposes done by decision-making systems, for instance. Prin-
ciples akin to those of holography might indeed provide much needed
breakthroughs in what might be called the implementation of systems
management, but I do not see how the supposition that structures governed
by such principles could supplant systematic organization altogether can be
anything but a vague wish.
Haugeland's perceptive discussion of the distinction between systematic
and morphological explanations in fact seems to provide the ground for an
argument against just such a hope. He offers DNA replication as an example
of a phenomenon requiring and permitting morphological explanation,
though he grants that a finer-grained account of its mechanics might be, in
his terms, systematic. Look in the other direction, though, at the courser-
grained account of the macroscopic phenomenon to enrich DNA's replica-
tory prowess contributes. The whole process of sexual reproduction surely
requires a systematic explanation, without the rudiments of which DNA re-
plication would be a baffling curiosity. Why should we have such strands in
us? What function are they performing? Self-replication and versatile self-
maintenance (i.e., successful cognition) are the two most sophisticated
processes known to us, I would guess, and now that self-replication is begin-
ning to be understood, after centuries of bewilderment and wild speculation,
it turns out to require a systematic explanation. Haugeland does not have
much to say about what sorts of phenomena are, in principle, amenable to
the various sorts of explanation he describes. It is still compelling, in spite of
his caveats, to suppose that no phenomenon as sophisticated as cognition
could fail to have a systematic explanation. It might well turn out that the
mysteries of sub processes of cognition that are currenty being attacked via
the Rube Goldberg machines of cognitive science can be given
nonsystematic, morphological explanations. This seems to be the Gibsonian
article of faith (Gibson, 1966). Such breakthroughs would still leave the basic
vision of cognitive science intact.
Haugeland's distinction between intentional black boxes (IBBs) and in-
formation processing systems (IPSs) is very important, for it permits him to
raise the often overlooked question: are all IBBs also IPSs? In a footnote he
criticizes an early paper of mine (1971 op. cit.) for "entirely leaving out the

crucial notion of an IPS." This was deliberate, and had I hit upon the term I
would have been happy to have called my "intentional systems" "intentional
black boxes," for that is what I meant to stress about intentional explanation.
The fact that an entity is predictable via an IBB strategy shows us nothing
directly about its internal structure or processing. My point there was, and
still is, to isolate the manifest value of everyday, ordinary-folks-style inten-
tional explanation (e.g., "He threw her the rope because he thought she was
drowning and wanted to save her") from the fortunes, good or bad, of cogni-
tive, sufc>personal theorizing (Dennett, 1969, 1977, forthcoming op. cit.). This
lack of structural or systematic implications is just what makes personal level
intentional explanation vacuous as psychology, a point with which, I think,
Haugeland concurs.

Cognitive problems and problems of cognitivism. 
The single shortest
phenomenologist argument against cognitivism goes like this (cf. Dodwell,
1971, p. 371): I meet someone in the street. As he walks toward me, I sud-
denly recognize him: "It's Steve!" The Steve I am meeting now is the same
Steve I met yesterday. How do I know he is the same? A quick cognitive style
answer would be that my eyes register Steve's image and some physio-
logical signals transmit it to the brain, where in turn by another physiological
process it is established that the input image fits the stored image. Now we
ask, "How does the process know that the input is an example of fitting?"
What is the criterion for this sort of decision? Well, there is a second-order
mechanism that tells what it is like for something to fit a stored image. In
other words, one postulates a model for fitting. But then, surely, a third-order
device will be required to guide the use of the model of fitting, and so on. An
infinite regress has been generated in which a mechanism is "explained"
by its higher level successor mechanism, but in fact nothing has been
explained. Now a compressed phenomenologist answer is that when I see
Steve, I do not really see Steve, but rather what I see is the-same-Steve-as-
yesterday (and this I see in the same way I see color). Thus the same-as-
yesterdayness is built into the perceptual process from the outset as a kind of
primitive. This is how the explanation of how one knows sameness comes to
an end, without employing an infinite series of models and decision guides.
There are three queries I have about Haugeland's most stimulating dis-
cussion of the cognitivist-phenomenologist quarrel. The first concerns the
modes of explanation used in physics versus cognitive psychology. I
contend that the division and comparison Haugeland makes is there only if
we rigidly identify physical theories with sets of (differential) equations and
cognitive theories with some sorts of networks of (information processing)
functional elements (black boxes). The comparison suffers from a category
mistake. What one should compare, I maintain, is on the one hand the
physicist's equations with those describing the information processing net-
work (input-output equations for functional elements plus constitutive equa-
tions relating the elements in the network), and, on the other, the physicists's
system (in general, a network of interacting components) with that of a
cognitivist (also a network). The point is that nomological explanation
belongs to a descriptive (syntactic) level, while Haugeland's morphological
explanation operates on a structural (model) level. Using the standard (lo-
gician's) structure-description completeness relationship, one form of expla-
nation is convertible into the other. Another angle to the business of explana-
tion I cannot discuss here is the use of counterfactuals (even in inductive
situations).
My second query is about meaningfulness. Here again, the difference
between, say, physical and cognitive styles of theorizing may only be ap-
parent but not intrinsic.
S. S. Stevens and those around him handled empirical meaningfuiness in
terms of scale invahance. For example, statements concerning standard de-
viation of temperature are empirically meaningless because standard devia-
tion is not invariant under interval (affine) transforms, defining temperature
scales. Passing from here to more involved physical models (using several
quantities), one observes that meaningfulness can be understood in terms of
invariance groups of automorphisms of these models. In a model-theoretic
framework this in turn corresponds to the problem of (first-order or higher-
order) definability in the language of the models.
I suggest that meaningfulness as discussed by Haugeland ultimately
comes down to the problem of definability. To say that in the case of a
strange chess-playing black box "we must know what its inputs and outputs
are, and how to interpret them," to me simply means that the inputs and
outputs must be definable in our language of chess, which again means at
the model level that certain invariance criteria must be satisfied.
A third query is about phenomenological hurdles. It may well be that skills
such as wine tasting or opera singing (if these are really skills) are simply
outside the domain of applicability of cognitive theories. Every known law in
physics is known to have exceptions, and it does not make physics any less
respectable. As long as the domain of applicability is pleasingly large, kinky
exceptions will not make any difference in holding it.
Simple examples are baffling enough. Take the well-known story about
Paul Dirac, traveling with a friend in a train in England (Rota, 1973, p. 11). As
they were looking out of the train windows, Dirac's friend remarked: "Look at
the beautiful white sheep!" Dirac answered, "Yes, white on one side!" Of
course, we have to somehow argue that Dirac was wrong. We see the grazing
sheep white on both sides! Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence specialists
argue by means of knowledge-driven (top-down) models, philosophers in
epistemology lean on either causal/counterfactual chains or data-, event-,
concept-, or hypothesis-driven schemes. All in all, it amounts to a battle
against gestalt.
The gestalt slogan "The whole is more than the sum of its parts" is to the
point only when one means "any sum." A cognitivist rebuttal must be that
there is always a right kind of subdivision of the whole into its parts whose
correct sum is the whole, even though one may not always be able to find it
computationally.

Cognitivism vs. Hermeneutics. In this impressive paper, Haugeland gives a
clear and convincing account of what a mechanism is, and, in particular,
what an information processing system (IPS) must be. He intends, thereby, to
put us in a better position than ever before to question the plausibility of cur-
rent claims that people are IPSs. Indeed, he succeeds so well in making
precise the underlying assumptions of cognitivism that he seems to have
produced, without realizing it, an argument that human beings cannot
possibly be information processing systems. What his work shows is that the
precondition for studying human beings as information processing ma-
chines, viz. that they be regarded as intentional black boxes (IBBs), may well
be incoherent.
The possible incoherence stems from an incompatibility of the two condi-
tions on what can count as inputs and outputs of an IBB- roughly that the
inputs and outputs (I/Os) must be both computable and interpretable. I will
try to show that, although these conditions are obviously compatible for a
machine that plays a game like chess, they become contradictory when
generalized to human beings. More specifically, I hope to show that Hauge-
land's two conditions on being an I/O of an IBB pick out two different sets of
candidates, those that satisfy only condition one and those that satisfy only
condition two, and that there is no room left in between for the sort of I/O that
satisfies both conditions at once.
it might be helpful to the reader if I first sketch my overall point before turn-
ing to the details of Haugeland's definitions. The first condition for counting
something as an IBB is that the I/Os have to be tokens of types belonging to
articulated typologies. This says, in effect, that to be.computable the I/Os

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
have to be univocal, context-free, elements. It is certainly plausible that
human beings have such I/Os, viz. the digitalized input from the sense
organs and the digitalized input to the individual muscle fibers, but it is not
such I/Os that we interpret as making sense.
The second condition is that the I/Os betokens of types that are interpreta-
ble. As Haugeland spells it out, this means that the I/Os have to make
reasonable sense under an overall interpretation. Now we do, indeed, make
coherent sense of what people say and do, but the level of description on
which we do this, listening to their utterances, watching their expression, and
following their gestures, cannot be further analyzed into articulated types
composed of simple types. We make sense of utterances in ordinary lan-
guage, but ordinary language (let alone facial expressions and gestures) is
not a calculus.
One might think that the interpretable types required by condition two are
simply the computable types picked out by condition one under a different
description, but, although these two sets of I/Os are, indeed, token-identical
in any particular case, I take it that Haugeland accepts a Davidsonian (1970
op. cit.) argument that due to the context-free character of the computable
types and the holistic character of the interpretable types, they cannot be
consistently type-identical. The incompatibility of the types defined by the
two conditions is usually covered up by using such terms as "code," "sti-
mulus information," and "precise I/O function," which seem to satisfy both
conditions. It is the great service of Haugeland's rigorous account to bring
out the question begging nature of all such terms.
I will now formulate this issue as precisely as I can, using Haugeland's
definitions and restricting myself to the special case of linguistic behavior.
To begin with, in definition 1 (Section 3), Haugeland defines a set of types
that are "uniquely determinable relative to a specified range of phenomena"
such that "no phenomenon is ever a token of more than one types." This is to
say that the types must be unambiguous, and, of course, chess notation
satisfies this condition, but natural language is ambiguous and the ambi-
guity may well be necessary.
Natural language also fails to satisfy definition 2 (Section 3) whereby an
articulated typology is defined as "an ordered pair of uniquely determin-
able sets of types such that: i. tokens of types in the second set of (complete
types) are composed of one or more tokens of types in the first set (simple
ones)." The obvious candidates for the simple types are words and for the
complete types, sentences. (If we think of the simple types as letters and the
complete types as words, we will run into the problem that letters are not
given an intentional interpretation.) But if words and sentences are the candi-
dates for the simple and complete types, they fail to satisfy condition ii., viz.
"no token of a simple type ever actually occurs . . . except as a component of
a complete type." Unless the inclusion of the phrase "one or more" in defini-
tion 2.L makes that condition tautologically true, so that every use of words is
a sentence; we can easily think of uses of natural language in which single
words and phrases occur that are not sentences (complete types) and yet the
context fills in the sense. (A famous example is the word "slab," uttered by
workers in one of Wittgenstein's language games.)
According to definition 3, in an intentional interpretation of an articulated
typology "the determination of what any token of a complete type means
must be made entirely in terms of how it is composed of tokens of simple
types." (My italics) But, again, this is not true of natural language, where
context obviously determines speakers' meaning and, it has been argued,
even determines sentence meaning (Searle, 1978).
There is no place in a typology of words and sentences for the elements of
a formal theory of context, even if, as seems highly unlikely, one could ever
be worked out.
All these definitions prepare Haugeland's final formulation of the compu-
tability condition, "a quasi-linguistic representation is a token of a complete
type from an intentionally interpreted articulated typology." But in the light of
what we have just seen concerning natural language, it is no longer clear
why the representations in question are called quasi-linguistic, since they
lack two ubiquitous and perhaps essential features of natural language: am-
biguity and context dependence. If Haugeland's definitions are taken as
defining "quasi-linguistic," they lead to the awkward result that natural lan-
guage itself is only quasi-quasi-linguistic.
Finally, if we remove the restriction of our discussion to the consideration
of language and consider other inputs such as gestures and facial
expressions, these turn out to be even worse candidates for the status of
quasi-linguistic representations than do expressions in natural language,
since as far as we know such expressive behavior has no formal syntax or se-
mantics, and the determination of its meaning depends entirely on what is
perceived as the current situation. Indeed, it is not clear in this case what the
simple and complete types could be.
It might seem that the way out of this difficulty is to hypothesize a highly
abstract formal "language of thought" in which language, gesture, and the
whole pragmatic context could be formally expressed. This, I think is Fodor's
(1975) move, and it does satisfy the computability condition that the inputs
and outputs be specifiable in an articulated typology. But, like neuron firings,
such abstract structures of the digitalized input and output, even if they do
exist, are not tokens of the types we interpret when we make sense of
people's behavior. That is, they fail to satisfy the interpretability condition as
specified in definition 5, iii, that the "outputs make reasonable sense in the
context of actual prior inputs and other actual outputs." Either we must add
the additional farfetched, and perhaps incoherent, assumption that we can
learn the abstract language of thought so we can make sense of it as part of
the everyday practices and behavior that provide our paradigm of making
sense, or Haugeland's definitions have shown that, in the last analysis, the
project of cognitivism is an incoherent dream dictated by the demands of
giving a scientific account of meaningful behavior. Whether this conclusion
reflects adversely on Haugeland's definitions or on cognitivism, I am not at
this moment able to say.
What is clear to me, however, is that Haugeland should not have assumed
so easily that his example of a chess-playing machine being an IBB could be
"generalized," since what is at stake is precisely the difference between
human context dependent behavior and a context-free game. It follows that
he should not have allowed that by applying his definitions, "flexibly" normal
people are IBBs, unless "flexibly" covers all the ways we have just listed in
which his definitions fail to fit human behavior. If he retracts these con-
cessions, his paper poses an even greater challenge to cognitivism than he
explicitly claims. Defenders of cognitivism must either weaken Haugeland's
definition of an IBB or else swallow the counter-intuitive implications of
Fodor's line. Otherwise, we must remain within our common-sense inten-
tional circle and allow that to account for action and perception we "enlarge
our interpretation, and say that [people] perceive and act under descriptions
(sees that. . . , intends 
etc.) and regard the descriptions as inputs and
outputs." In that case, since computation of these I/Os is impossible, we will
find ourselves doing hermeneutics rather than cognitive psychology.

Mind that last step; I think it's loose. Since Haugeland treats a subject of
considerable importance, it is unfortunate that he chooses to present
Cognitivism as a program, like Freudianism or Behaviorism or the other
"isms" that sweep psychology from time to time. It is more useful to look at
Cognitivism as an articulation and defense of a special kind of higher-level
explanation.
Explanations come in kinds for one of two reasons: (1) Heuristic. Some
strategies of explanation simply provide more intuitive, intelligible answers
to a given sort of question than do others. (2) Ontological. Some explananda
are answerable to regularities of behavior fundamentally and irreducibly dif-
ferent from those of other explanada. A relatively uncontroversial example of
case 2 is the mathematical-logical versus the material-empirical. Causal for-
mats are not suitable for the demonstration of mathematical propositions;
and at least since Bacon, a priori explanations have not been thought appro-
priate for observable phenomena.
For reasons of parsimony, if not aesthetics, and unless obliged to think
otherwise, we suppose these two kinds of explanation to be the only two irre-
ducible and indispensable ones. Therefore the divisions of nonmathematical
explanations into causal, functional, teleological, cognitive, and so on, are
divisions for heuristic convenience only. For example, when teleological talk
(about purposes, aims, goals, instrumentalities, etc.) occurs as a shame-
faced shorthand in evolutionary explanations, it is considered as merely a

Commentary/Haugelanci: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
causal/statistical terms. The "correct" kind of explanation would be tediously
long, repititive, circumlocutory, and unintuitive; nonetheless, it is considered
the true coin.
If this same redeemability were not true for other high-level frames of
explanation, like systematic and cognitive, it would imply an ontological
apartheid of their explanada, hence an emergent dualism at a very high level
of explanation - a disastrous result for any hoped-for Unity of Science.
Haugeland concedes that "a complete reduction of psychology is one of the
dreams of unified science" but is explicitly uninterested in discussing it (see,
e.g., the end of his sec. 5). He does not even think that, in the light of
Cognitivism, it is much of a problem: ". . . the fact that [states with
significance] have some characteristics or other, independent of the in-
terpretation (that is, they are [sic] causal interactions with the environment),
means that there is no mystery about how states with significance 'connect'
with the rest of nature." (end, sec. 3) But this is false. There is a mystery, if the
significance of these states (and not just the states minus their significance)
has causal consequences - and it must if it is not an epiphenomenon and in
violation of the laws of thermodynamics. How it can have causal conse-
quences is precisely the question. Rigorous and nonmystical explanation of
this "mystery" is well worth the attention of interested psychologists. It would
be good to see coherent, sophisticated attempts to elaborate logical struc-
tures capable of explaining intelligent behavior as a natural, nonemergent
phenomenon. For in explanations of this sort so far there really is a missing
logical link between the last Intentional step and the first non-Intentional one.
It is true that Haugeland tries very hard to bridge this gap. But does the
concept of physical instantiation of an Intentional schema accomplish the
bridging? Not quite yet, I think. There are several difficulties with the defini-
tion of "Intentional interpretation of an articulated typology," but their
descriptions would require more space than a Commentary affords.
Therefore I offer one blanket objection: Haugeland, it seems to me, tries to
make the type-token relation do for the besought phenomenon-meaning rela-
tion-and the type-token relation is too fragile to bear the load. Indeed, a
type -e.g., the letter A - is ordinarily taken to be merely the set of all its to-
kens. I doubt that so purely extensional a relationship can serve the desired
end, which explicitly includes "making reasonable sense." Therefore (if
Haugeland's definition will not do) the intuitively satisfying, the promising,
the pregnant notions of interpretation and instantiation require lots more
work. Can the demonstration of an isomorphism between an (abstract) inten-
tional schema and the (abstract) type of (concrete) physical structures serve
as a rule of inference? Used in a well-behaved formal scheme of argumenta-
tion, would it close the logical gap between the Intentional and the non-Inten-
tional steps? And what would it commit us to, ontologically?
Haugeland made a brave beginning on considering these questions. I am
aware that I am in part complaining that he did not write the paper I should
have liked him to write. Moreover, I have ignored parts of the paper he did
write. For example, I do not think it is yet time to worry about whether
Cognitivism, as an imperial program, can conquer moods and skills. I am
much more concerned with whether it can coherently handle anything at all. I
hope it can; and I hope that for his next paper Haugeland bends his talents-
and his Cognitive phenomena - to a meticulous demonstration that it can. Fi-
nally, I hope he is permanently disabused of the naive belief that in being "a
science of a distinctive form," Cognitivism "sidesteps many 'philosophical'
objections." There is no escape from philosophical objections but to recog-
nize them, meet them fairly, and overcome them - to everyone's profit.

Systems and explanations. Haugeland has made a significant contribution
by beginning to characterize explanations that show how something works,
rather than by showing why something happens. Haugeland asserts that
these systematic explanations are characteristic of cognitive psychology,
and that by explicating them he legitimates the scientific study of cognition.
I agree that systematic explanations are different from nomological expla-
nations. However, I think they are not unique to cognitive science. I will try to
argue in this commentary that the kinds of systematic explanation that
dominate recent discussion in cognitive science also play an important role
in traditional physical science. I am not sure whether my argument, if ac-
cepted, would make cognitive science more or less legitimate than it is on
Haugeland's analysis. On the one hand, my analysis increases the rapport
between cognitive and physical science because it shows that there is more
in common between them than Haugeland's analysis suggests. On the other
hand, systematic explanations are considerably weaker than nomological
explanations, so we arrive at the familiar opinion that cognitive science is in
a primitive state.
First, let me dispose of a distinction in Haugeland's analysis that does
more harm than good. Haugeland asserts that there are three kinds of expla-
nation; I think there are really only two. Morphological and systematic expla-
nations are not different kinds of explanations. At most, morphological and
systematic explanations can be distinguished on the basis of the systems
that are explained. In some systems, such as fibre optics bundles, the
interactions between components are simple. Then an explanation of how
the system works can be given by saying how each component works, with
no complicated additional analysis of how the components interact. In other
systems, such as automobile engines, the interactions between components
are nontrivial. Then an understanding of the system is not achieved merely
by knowing how the various components function; it is necessary, in addi-
tion, to know how they affect each other, and how these interactions go
together to produce the global functioning of the system. I do not think that
the existence of differences in the complexity of interaction implies different
kinds of explanation. Simpler systems require simpler explanations, to be
sure, but I prefer to think of morphological explanations as systematic expla-
nations of simple systems, rather than as a separate category of explana-
tions.
Haugeland's belief that morphological and systematic explanations are
different in kind has pernicious consequences. For example, it leads him to
conclude that if human memory functions like a hologram, it is not an in-
formation processing system. I was shocked when I found Haugeland saying
this, and I had to conclude that he had been carried away with his argument.
A hologram clearly processes information. When a hologram is suitably
illuminated, the illuminating energy is transformed into an image of the ob-
ject that was recorded initially, and this surely must be a case of information
processing. Since Haugeland cannot identify distinct components that
interact to produce this activity, he cannot fit holograms into his category of
things explained systematically; hence, he excludes them from systems that
process information. I would prefer to have a broader concept of information
processing systems.
However, to argue against the distinction between morphological and
systematic explanations is to quibble. If that distinction is removed, the dis-
tinction between systematic/morphological and nomological explanation
remains, and that is the central contribution of Haugeland's article. It would
be hard to overemphasize the importance of distinguishing between mor-
phological and systematic/morphological (abbreviated as S/M) explana-
tions. Furthermore, Haugeland's reading of contemporary cognitive science
is correct; S/M explanations are predominant there.
Haugeland's remarks raise the question whether S/M explanations are
unique to cognitive science. His major illustration of a systematic explana-
tion is a theory about automobile engines. I think our understanding of this
problem is informed by considering physical examples that are not
engineered as obviously as this one.
Consider what makes a sound. There is an initiating object that vibrates.
That generates a compression wave in a medium, such as air or water. The
wave is transmitted through the medium by successive compressions and
rarefactions of the medium, which we can understand as increases and
decreases in the density of molecules of the medium. Eventually, the wave
produces a vibration of someone's eardrum, and that causes neural im-
pulses that correspond to hearing a sound. There are problems at the point
where we say that the sound is heard, but excluding that, the description
seems a straightforward illustration of S/M explanation. It has components
that interact in nontrivial ways, and the explanation consists of identifying the
components and showing how their interaction produces the phenomena
that are interesting.
Consider another example: a teakettle of boiling water on a gas stove.
Components include the gas coming through the burner, the flame, the ket-
tle, and the water. Understanding the system requires knowing how these
components interact. There are quantitative properties, and deductive argu-
ments can be given about specific features, such as the temperature of the
boiling water (see Hempel & Oppenheim, 1948, op cit.). However, an
analysis of the system into components and relationships is essential to
understanding the system.

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
I believe that it is an error to omit the kind of knowledge involved in Hauge-
land's S/M explanations from a characterization of knowledge in physical
science. Recent analysis of problem solving in physics by de Kleer (1975),
Larkin (1977), Novak (1976), Reif (1977), and Simon and Simon (in press)
have all emphasized the importance of qualitative knowledge in the process
of representing and solving problems. There are strong similarities between
the processes discovered in these studies and the kinds of qualitative
analyses that Haugeland discusses by way of characterizing S/M explana-
tions. The idea is developing that knowledge of physical science has two
aspects: knowledge of the syntactic system in which formal deductions are
constructed, and knowledge of the semantic models of the formal system. In-
formal, semantic knowledge of the kind represented in S/M explanations
remains an important component of physical science; in fact, it appears to
play a greater role in the problem-solving performance of experts than of be-
ginning students (Larkin, 1977; Simon & Simon, in press).
Rather than considering S/M explanations as a distinctive feature of cogni-
tive science, I think they are an important feature of all scientific knowledge,
although their role in physical science may have been neglected because of
the strong development there of formal knowledge and of nomological expla-
nations. Qualitative hypotheses are empirically testable, but to the degree
that knowledge in a science is nomological, hypotheses are more precise
and more strongly testable. For example, a qualitative model of sound is
sufficient to explain why sound will not be propagated through a vacuum,
and that model would be refuted if sound did travel through a vacuum.
However, a more precise and formal model can be stated, including the
speed of propagation through various substances, and this permits stronger
tests. Haugeland makes a correct and important point in noting that S/M
explanations are based on legitimate, empirical knowledge. On the other
hand, cognitive science, in which almost all of our present knowledge is of
the qualitative kind, is less testable than physical science. Whether more
formal, nomological knowledge will eventually develop in cognitive science
remains to be seen. I do not believe that the nature of our subject matter
limits us to qualitative knowledge and S/M explanations in principle.

Half-way to realism: Some sympathetic comments on Havgeland's de-
fence of cognitivism. Haugeland's interesting paper raises, for me, two im-
portant and interlocking issues, one in the philosophy of science and the
other in the methodology of psychology.
1. Given the shortcomings of logical positivism (empiricism) as a
philosophy of science, what account of science should replace it? I shall
argue that though Haugeland's philosophy of science is a step in the right di-
rection, it is only a partial revision of logical empiricism and preserves at
least one of its undesirable features. But Haugeland's admission of "mor-
phological" and "systematic" explanation-formats ought to have carried him
all the way to the neorealist position.
2. In admitting cognitive states, contents, processes, and so on, back into
psychology as real entities with causal powers, the methodology proposed
in Haugeland's theory as a grounding for current practices in psychology is
still scientistic,1 since it draws on only one of the several possible overall
models of human functioning that become available in abandoning logical
empiricism. The effect of a scientistic choice of overall model is to narrow un-
necessarily the range of rhetorics available for psychological explanations.
The philosophical issues. Two deep philosophical questions are raised by
Haugeland's concessionary explanation-formats. They are: (1) Whether the
explanatory power of a theory derives from its content or from its form. (2)
Whether sequential regularities between events and states are the proper
and only basic content for laws.
To make clear how these questions arise, I must turn for a moment to com-
pare and contrast the logical empiricist conception of science with the
neorealist theory. Logical empiricism had two components: empiricism and
logicism. Cognitive psychology seems to have broken successfully from em-
piricism, that is, it is prepared to tolerate concepts whose empirical content
is not given in immediate experience. But it still retains traces of logicism,
since, so far as I can see, even the liberalized conception of scientific expla-
nation offered in Haugeland's paper retains a basic foundation of laws of
regular sequence, or something like it.
The neorealist position is a still more radical departure from logical em-
piricism. Neorealists (e.g., Bhaskar, 1975) hold that the explanatory power of
a theory derives neither from its form, as the logical empiricists held
(Hempel, 1965), nor from its ability to assuage psychological needs of one
sort or another (Scriven, 1962), but from the content of the theory and what it
says about the world. In particular, in order for a theory to have explanatory
power it must describe plausible generative mechanisms and their modes of
working such as to produce observable patterns of, say, human action and
talk.
But to explain an observable pattern two questions need to be answered -
their distinction is lost in Humean reductions of the causal mode of expla-
nation to regularity of precedence. (1) What conditions bring about (that is,
bring into existence) the patterned products we observe. To this question a
reply must mention both an agent or agents and the releasing conditions for
its activity to be realized in action, or, where the dynamic element in a causal
process is external to the individuals and substances involved, some stim-
ulus. (2) But as a scientist one must also be prepared to answer the question:
"What was responsible for the properties of the patterned product generated
by the released activity of the agent or by the external stimulus?"
In general, answers are to be found in structural properties of the material
conditions of the production of the patterns we observe. One might call these
"templates."
In some cases, template and causal agent are materially identical. It is the
gravitational field that both produces downward acceleration and is so struc-
tured that the motion has a certain definite form. In other cases, template and
agent are materially distinct, as when a person acts in an orderly fashion by
following a publicly promulgated rule.
Haugeland's "morphological" and "systematic" explanation-formats are
none other than special cases of the general neorealist schema. It is worth
remarking parenthetically that the "subtle" difference he notices between
them is exactly what Polanyi (1969) noticed between the two kinds of
boundary conditions whose imposition on the laws of physics and chemistry
yields integral systems. In a sense Haugeland has discovered for himself, by
another route, the theory that the neorealists have been arguing for all along
(Harre, 1970). But once that schema is admitted as legitimate, the Deductive-
Nomological (D-N) schema cannot be tolerated as an adequate explanation
schema at all. At best, it is reduced to a peculiar and degenerate case of the
neorealist form of explanation.
There are two common philosophers' mistakes in Haugeland's account
that may have concealed from him how radical is his admission of non-"D-N"
explanation-formats of just the kind he has proposed. He says, "The most fa-
miliar scientific explanations come from classical mechanics." "Familiar to
whom?" one might ask. I think the answer must be "To philosophers of the
logicist tradition," since only in classical mechanics does one find pieces of
reasoning that are much like the D-N format. Explanations in chemistry,
physiology, geology, genetics, and linguistics are far more "familiar" to the
scientific community at large. Even though they bear little resemblance to the
D-N format, they are one and all intelligible and correctly formulated accord-
ing to neorealist criteria of explanatory power since they are constructed
around a certain kind of content.
The second matter that leads Haugeland astray is his rather casual use of
the term "model." I fear it shows that he is not immune to familiar confusions
about the way models function in theories. "Morphological explanations,"
says Haugeland, "are often called 'models'." On the contrary, one should say

that such explanations describe models, and from that thought the neorealist
explanation schema for the mapping of the necessary content emerges
directly (see Table 1).
The structure is linked together through the conditions that (1) M must
behave analogously to the way GM is known to behave, that is, hypothetically
yield OP, and (2) M must have a nature analogous to MS, that is, it must
hypothetically belong to the sameontic category as MS.
This schema not only correctly identifies that epistemic status of the
components of the content of an explanatory theory, but allows us to formu-
late a reasonable account of how, through its two analogies, the model M is
constructed in the absence of knowledge of the generative mechanism GM.
Corresponding to the material relations of analogy among the components of
content there are semantic relations of metaphor and simile among the con-
cepts and their symbolic vehicles in the discourse in which the items in the
scheme are described, that is in the explanatory theory. In this way we can
account for the experience-anticipating 
intensional 
content of
transexperiential concepts.
The methodological issues. In constructing a psychology, we need a
source of concepts to enable us to conceive of appropriate models of the
generative mechanisms we currently cannot study empirically. Cognitive
psychology, as sketched by Haugeland, clearly depends upon a very
general "computer-cum-machine intelligence" source for concepts and their
interrelations for constructing a description of causal (hidden) processes
that could be responsible for manifest human performances.
In terms of iconic model theory, as I have sketched it above in the
neorealist schema, psychological hypotheses of generative processes are
formulated first in terms of thinking, feeling, and so on. To link them with the
physiological base, they are then transformed by being redescribed in
information-processing rhetoric. This rhetoric is not derived from the descrip-
tive language of thinking, feeling, planning, and so on, by abstraction, but
from the model's source. This leads to a cybernetic representation inter-
mediate between the cognitive representation of the processes that generate
thought and action, public and private, and the physiological mechanisms
that realize the cybernetic representation and the structures and processes it
purports to describe. And, of course, it is easy to complain that the choice of
information-processing as a model-source is gratuitous. Since the descrip-
tive system for iconic models of generative "mechanisms" derived from that
source 
drastically 
reduces the 
resources 
for conceiving 
of such
"mechanisms," it is not only gratuitous (that is, uncalled for by the nature of
the individual substances present and their behaviour, the things whose na-
ture and behaviour we are studying), but coming from a general scientism in
the intellectual environment, it is likely to be positively wrong.
By way of contrast, the ethogenic movement, now becoming the dominant
force in social and personality psychology in Europe, would admit no other
model source than human beings themselves (Hudson, 1975) and no other
rhetoric than that derived by a critical analysis from elaborated forms of or-
dinary language. In practical terms, this methodological principle leads to
the setting up of literary productions as sources of concepts for formulating
psychological theories, since literary productions already encapsulate, im-
plicitly, widely tested psychological (and microsociological) theories about
the genesis and meaning of human action, public and private, cooperative
and agonistic.
The most striking developments of this idea have been the dramaturgical
approach in social psychology associated with the Oxford school of social
psychologists, sometimes called "accounting theory" (Harre, 1977) and the
autobiographical approach to personality studies originating in the Brussels
school of assessment of.criminal personality (De Waele, 1976). Both draw
upon literary productions for their concepts, and upon elaborated and
critically tested ordinary language for their rhetorics.
Accounting theory depends upon the interaction between two model-
sources. Human action and interaction is analyzed within a general frame-
work derived from the way drama productions are staged in both traditional
(formal episodes) and radical (improvised episodes) theatre. This analytical
and explanatory system interacts with the adoption of the widespread human
practice of reworking social and psychological reality by talk to make the
social world and human action in it appear reasonable and proper, and the
people engaged worthy of respect, (Marsh, 1978). The theories people use to
promote this picture are, on the ethogenic theory, both revealed in their talk
and accounts and operative in the way they formulate their intentions and
plans, and hence in much of what they do. This aspect connects with the
recent attempt by Gauld and Shotter (1977) to transform the previously pro-
gammatic ideas of hermeneutic psychology into a practical technique.
In short, there are now two psychologies in existence that could
reasonably claim to be alternative to the old operationalist/experimentalist
approach. Both have arisen in conscious opposition to behaviourism in both
its ordinary and its radical forms. Cognitive psychology has transcended the
crude empiricism of its predecessor that confined the experimental tradition
to the status of a protoscience or pseudoscience, most aptly compared to
medieval alchemy. Cognitive psychology is a genuine science. But from the
larger standpoint it is still scientistic in its conceptual resources. In a word, it
has "gone cybernetic" too soon.
At this point another of Haugeland's philosophical contributions becomes
relevant, namely his perception that his morphological and systematic
explanation-formats explain through identifying underlying forms that are
responsible for the form of the products of certain generative processes. In
the morphological case, a synchronically existing form is responsible for the
synchronic form of the product. In the systematic case, a synchronic form
(the structure and layout of an engine) is responsible for the diachronic form
of its operations and the structure of its movements in time. He is clearly right
to see this as a radical shift from nomological foundations of explanation,
since there are no laws of nature relating specific forms to specific forms. Yet
to cite a specific form, isomorphic with the form of a product, as responsible
for that form, is clearly immediately intelligible. Involved here, is what one
might most properly call a "Principle of Natural Order," stating that struc-
tured products are generated from structured templates. It is a principle of
the greatest importance in contemporary science that pays such great atten-
tion to structure. But the perception of the central role of such a principle in
the methodology and metaphysics of science goes back to Aristotle and his
idea of formal cause. Again Haugeland has independently and by another
route discovered one of the central tenets of ethnogenic psychology-that
structured products must have structured causes (Harre, 1977).
My last point concerns Haugeland's way of dealing with the necessity of
grounding psychological functioning in physiological processes. Again I
want to argue that his argument points in the right direction but could have
been carried further. He correctly points out the impossibility of a theory of
neuronal bases for cognitive functioning that takes as its neuronal units
structures and processes identified according to physiological criteria alone
(or any other arbitrary criteria). But he regards as circular the use of "reduc-
tions from above," that is, criteria of individuation for physiological entities
derived from psychological criteria for individuating associated psy-
chological processes and states, and so on. This causes him some unease.
But when we realize that what Haugeland calls "reduction from above" is the
familiar taxonomic priority thesis, proposed, for example, by Jensen (1972),
it is easy to put his mind at rest on this score. Though preliminary classifica-
tions of physiological entities relevant to psychological functioning must be
derived from psychological criteria, the relation so established is between
taxonomies, that is, between kinds, not between individuals. So, though the
kinds are circularly related, individuals may come on the scene that cannot
be classified in either the existing psychological kinds or the existing
physiological kinds. Occasions could occur in which individual states and
processes of either category would threaten the wholesale application of the
taxonomic priority theses (TPT). Once a physiological kind has been es-
tablished, by whatever means, including TPT, it is surely logically possible
that an instance of it could exist without a report of an instance of the cor-
responding psychological kind being given. The appearance of such a case
is usually dealt with in practice by forming a disjunctive taxon, saying, for
example, that anxiety is correlated either with adrenalin or with tryptamine,
and postulating a hidden physiological parameterto accountforthe likeness
or identity of the psychological reading of the state (Harre, 1970).

Commentary/Haugeland: 
The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
It is worth noticing that identifying the physiological "machinery" of
'psychological functioning by the use of the Taxonomic Priority Thesis, that is,
by the method of identifying physiological kinds from already established
psychological kinds, does not depend on any particular model-source for
psychological theory. Cybernetics is attractive, as a model-source, since the
brain is a structure of some sort, with electrical and chemical processes oc-
curring in it. Such a model-source has a special priority on the grounds of
plausibility, since the material realization of computing systems also occurs
in a structured thing in which electrical and chemical processes occur. But it
is clear that the use of TPT to ground psychological functioning in the brain
and nervous system is compatible with quite other sources for models of the
unknown processes that generate meaningful human action. And, as I have
pointed out, the ethogenic movement, the European parallel to cognitive
psychology, draws on literary sources for its models of generative
processes, models that through TPT could lead to a conception of the brain
as a theatre for the rehearsal and production of dramas, and many other
things besides.
NOTE
1. Scientism is the assumption that a new field of enquiry becomes
scientific by drawing on established sciences for its model-sources.

Cognitivism as a paradigm. This paper contains much of value and de-
serves a more extended analysis and response than there is space for here,
so I shall concentrate only on some important criticisms.
Is cognitive science empirical? Haugeland claims to have shown that
"meaningfulness can be dealt with empirically." I am less sanguine than he
on this point.
His argument, as I understand it, is this: on coming across a device or
creature that behaves in some way, one can make hypotheses about what its
behaviour means. These hypotheses can be tested empirically by seeing
whether the behaviour "makes reasonable sense" under the hypothesised in-
terpretation. There are many difficulties in this scheme. There is the Quinean
point about translational indeterminacy (Quine, 1960 op. cit.). There is the
question of how one would ever come to hypothesise meaningfulness of the
behaviour unless one in some sense already understood it. There is the
difficulty of distinguishing between, on the one hand, a device that speaks
language L, but is somehow faulty or incompetent or sick, and, on the other
hand, a device that speaks some other language L'. (If a programmer
exhibits a chess-playing program that turns out, when interpreted by his
rules, to make illegal or crazy moves, one concludes there is a bug in it. The
alternative hypothesis - that it speaks a different language - is so unlikely as
to be almost inconceivable. Again, consider schizophrenic language: is this
a new form of communication, as Laing believes, or a symptom of some inner
derangement?) There is the difficulty of refuting hypotheses of vague com-
munications, for example, inanimate oracles such as the / Ching.
The main point, however, is this: Even if Haugeland's argument were cor-
rect, all it would show would be that ethology could be empirical, not that
cognitive science is. Cognitivists are not faced with a black behaving box
requiring interpretation (like an insect whose strange dances need to be
understood), but with a box whose behaviour is perfectly meaningful, the
problem being to explain how it works. Our hypotheses are not of the form
"this behaviour means such-and-such," but "this cognitive ability (speaking
correct English, recognising faces, playing chess) is realised by the follow-
ing computation: . . . ." Haugeland does not discuss the difficulties in testing
this kind of hypothesis empirically, and I think they are very great (see my
commentary on Pylyshyn, BBS 1:1, 1978).
Systems, levels, and dimensions. Haugeland is correct to draw attention to
what he calls change of dimension and its importance in describing complex
systems-his reply to Lucas is well taken, for example (although one of
Lucas's antecedents is almost certainly false, so his conclusion would be un-
supported in any case). But the concept is not adequately analysed here.
(a) The examples of systems offered are all physical mechanisms of one
sort or another. And his definition of IPS is also oriented that way: thus
components have between them causal relationships that are interpreted in a
typology. But computer programs are not physical mechanisms and are not
like physical mechanisms. Their "parts" are directly symbolic and interact by
the transmission of information rather than energy. They do not causally
influence one another: their intercourse is governed by the very rules that
define the meanings of the symbols they exchange. The fact that evaluation
of the LISP expression (CAR '[A B C]) results (via a call of the function CAR)
in the atom A follows from the rules of LISP, not from any physical law. Nor
are these LISP expressions in any sense coded descriptions of some un-
derlying physical mechanism, of whose internal workings a causal account
can be given. While of course there is, eventually, a physical computer on
which the program is running, the causal relationships that obtain between
the physical parts of this computer and the LISP-ish relationships among the
parts of the program bear no necessary, or even law-governed, relationship
one to another.
(b) Haugeland argues that the components of a chessplayer, for example,
must be talking to one another about chess. He concedes that the inner vo-
cabulary might properly contain - be richer than - the outer one. But he fails
to notice that this richer inner vocabulary may include concepts that he
would want to attribute to a lower "dimension" (usually called "level," as in
"high-level programming language"), thus making mincemeat of his level/di-
mension contrast and of his main point. Minimaxing in game playing is a
good example. This is an algorithm, used by almost all chess-playing pro-
grams, for searching a tree of possible moves. It depends crucially on the
comparing of numbers and operations on labelled trees, neither of which are
about chess. These are top-level components of the main chess-playing al-
gorithm: they are not to be explained away as lower-dimension implementa-
tions - "intentional instantiations" - of some high-level subroutine. Minimax-
ing is an algorithmic technique that directly relates zero-sum two-person
games, trees, and numbers.
Haugeland's central conclusion, that programs must "work through a ra-
tionale" expressed entirely in the vocabulary of the original "problem," is just
false, although some programs may do so.
Rationales, skills, and holograms. This "rationale" idea is asked to bear a
lot of weight in Haugeland's later discussion. There is a subtle shift in its
meaning as this discussion advances from merely (a), the belief that the
components talk to one another in the language of the problem - in any case
often false-to the much stronger (b), the belief that the components ex-
plicitly justify the "solution," which is the final output, where this seems to
mean something like explaining to themselves why the solution is a solution.
It is important to see that (b) is a far stronger claim than (a), and it is (b) that
Haugeland finds so implausible, applied, for example, to skills and moods.
But (b) is even more wrong, as a theory of how programs operate, than (a) is.
One must distinguish an algorithm that works from an explanation of why it
works. (I am indebted to David Marr, who finally convinced me of the truth of
this.) Take an example suggested by Seymour Papert: an algorithm for catch-
ing a ball. One might expect that the rationale behind this skill involved dif-
ferential equations, laws of gravitation, and so forth. But the algorithm is very
simple. If the image of the ball moves upwards, run backwards; if
downwards, run forwards; if sideways, run in the same direction. When the
subtended angle of the image visibly increases, get ready to catch the ball.
Now, this algorithm works, but it works through "no rationale," it just does its
own thing. To show that it works requires some further discussion, but that is
not part of the algorithm, and is not being elaborated in the heads of suc-

Commentary/Haugeland: 
The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
cessful ball-catchers. (Nor does it involve differential calculus.) And, again,
most algorithms are like this.
Much of Haugeland's discussion of skills and moods thus rests on sand.
For example, there is no reason at all to suppose that a computational ac-
count of chess-masters' skill need involve explicating the "thousands of
games" that gave rise to the skill. Berliner (1973) discusses this problem
very insightfully.
There are two responses to be made to Haugeland's "holographic"
counter-example and his discussion of skills.
(a) Leaving aside the fact that a pure holographic device is at best an
associative memory, and therefore could not conceivably be a whole chess
player, the proposed contrast between holographs and computations is
faulty. A physical holograph (optical, for example) is a physical instantiation
of a certain kind of computation, which can be realised on certain kinds of
parallel computer architecture (such as are found in the mammalian retina
and cerebellum). Computations of this general family have been put forward
as models of low-level vision (Marr, 1975) and memory organisation
(Fahlman, 1977), for example. So, even low-level, wholly unconscious, fast
skills may plausibly be mediated by computations.
(b) On the other hand, many apparently unconscious skills have, by a
process that interleaves introspection with implementation, been teased out
into systems of explicit rules. One implements the expert's first faltering in-
trospection, then has him criticise the resulting (bad) program, then imple-
ments his suggested refinements, and so on. Typically, the expert's talents at
introspection become sharpened as the process is iterated, perhaps scores
of times. The first program built this way, the Stanford DENDRAL, is now the
world's expert at analysis of certain mass spectra. Other programs diagnose
plant diseases or recommend antibacterial therapy, with human-level perfor-
mance (see Feigenbaum, 1977, for a survey). But the key point, for us, is that
the human experts recognise the rules as convincing accounts of their own
thinking, and the transcripts of the program's activity as reasonable, con-
vincing justifications for its conclusions.
The success of these programs, and the way they were built, argue
strongly that the experts were working through a similar rule-govered ra-
tionale in deploying their skills. Haugeland doubts whether skills are
mediated by unconscious systems of rules. But the evidence is overwhelm-
ing that many "intellectual" skills are, since the rules are there to be found.
Conclusion. Haugeland clearly comes to bury cognitivism, not to praise it.
Many of his unfounded criticisms of A.I. progress and prospects deserve
detailed replies for which there is no space here; but there is, in any case, a
more fundamental point. Cognitivism is not a theory for which positive and
negative evidence can or should be sought. It is a paradigm, an approach to
constructing theories, a style of theorising. It cannot be correct or incorrect,
only more or less productive. As Haugeland observes, it may ultimately turn
out to be sterile. And it may be very productive. But the only way to tell is to
try doing normal science within it, and see where we get. Anticipating possi-
ble paradigm failures before the paradigm has crystallised is not science but
antiscience.

Two remarks on the characterization of IBBs. Haugeland's paper is a rich
source of ideas for discussion. In my brief comment I shall focus on two
difficulties that I see in his characterization of Intentional Black Boxes (IBBs).
I shall conclude with some remarks about his assessment of the plausibility
of cognitivism.
It is a cardinal tenet of cognitivism that the behavior of a cognitive entity is
meaningful. As Haugeland puts it, "the observed outputs consistently 'make
reasonable sense' in the context of other observed inputs and outputs."
Critics of cognitivism find this tenet contentious: they fail to see how mean-
ingfulness or significance can be made empirically respectable. Haugeland
attempts to answer this objection in section 3 of his paper by means of his
definition of IBBs. He summarizes his response as follows: "although mean-
ingfulness is not an intrinsic property of behavior that can be observed or
measured, it is a characteristic that can be attributed in an empirically
justified interpretation, if the behavior is part of an overall pattern that 'makes
sense'." Yet it is unclear why Haugeland thinks that he has successfully
answered the objection. After all, definition (5) leaves totally unexplicated
the crucial notion of "making reasonable sense," which to my ears sounds
very similar to the notion of meaningfulness with which we began. The prob-
lem, as I see it, is that Haugeland requires that the inputs and outputs of IBBs
be interpretable as "quasi-linguistic representations," but he fails to provide
a semantics for these representations. Or at least he fails to show that such a
semantics can be provided. His definitions (1) through (4) stipulate, in effect,
that quasi-linguistic representations are syntactic structures that obey a
Fregean compositionality principle (viz., the meaning of any token of a com-
plete type is a function of the meanings of the tokens of simple types of which
it is composed, where the functions in question are defined over the syntactic
structures of complete types). But, as Haugeland acknowledges, nothing is
said in these definitions about how the meanings of simple types are
assigned; hence, we are given no semantics for these representations.
Haugeland takes this to be a minor problem, since in practice we can
generally agree on what does and does not "make reasonable sense," that
is, we can agree on what does and does not constitute a reasonable in-
terpretation of these representations. We can, moreover, interpret these
representations by translating them into some antecedently understood lan-
guage, perhaps English or Mentalese.
Critics of cognitivism are likely to be unmoved by such practical
considerations. Translation, they will argue, is fine for a while, but eventually
the cognitivist must get down to the task of "making sense" of the antece-
dently understood language. Of course, it is not incumbent on Haugeland
that he provide a semantics for this language; that is a task for linguists and
psychologists. Yet if Haugeland is to meet his critics' objections, and this is
apparently something that he wishes to do, then it is incumbent on him to
provide reasons for believing that the cognitivist enterprise will not impale it-
self on this task. The problem, though, is this: what sort of reasons would
Haugeland's critics find compelling? What would convince them that mean-
ingfulness or significance can be dealt with empirically? Actually providing
the required semantics might turn the trick, were it not that all semantic
theories that have been proposed for the task are decidedly cognitivist (e.g.,
Anderson, 1976; Bobrow & Winograd, 1977; Charniak& Wilks, 1976;Minsky,
1975; Winograd, 1972, 1976). But given this fact, I suspect that nothing short
of what Haugeland (misleadingly) calls a "complete reduction" of cognitive
psychology would satisfy these critics, since nothing short of that would
demonstrate the compatibility of cognitivism with token physicalism (Fodor,
1975, pp. 9-26). But this is hardly something that can be provided in a single
paper, much less by a single definition.
These skeptical objections aside, Haugeland's own explication of
cognitivism requires that he be able to provide a semantics for quasi-
linguistic representations. The notion of a "change of dimension," charac-
teristic of intentional instantiation, presupposes that one is able to decide
whether two IBBs "pertain to the same subject matter or problem." Intentional
instantiations, we will recall, involve reinterpretation, that is, change of sub-
ject matter or problem. This presupposed ability in turn presupposes that the
inputs to and the outputs from IBBs are in some fairly strong sense
representations of or about a particular subject matter or problem. Spelling
out this sense will require a semantics for quasi-linguistic representations. If
such a semantics could not be provided, Haugeland's notion of intentional
instantiation would collapse.
My second criticism of Haugeland's notion of IBBs is directed toward his
distinction between IBBs and Information Processing Systems (IPSs). IPSs,
we are told, are IBBs whose input/output abilities can be explained in terms
of the abilities of component IBBs without having to reinterpret their inputs
and outputs (see his section 4). The abilities of IBBs that are not IPSs cannot
be so explained. Haugeland's distinction is tenable; however, it obscures
important differences among IBBs, differences that were well captured by
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Commentary/Haugeland: 
The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
Dennett's (1975 op. cit.) "committees of homunculi" metaphor: IBBs can be
approximately ordered on a continuum from those having no componential
structure (e.g., the AND-gaXe) to those having a rich componential structure
(e.g., the human mind). IBBs that are not IPSs are a limiting case. I speak of
the "componential structure" of IPSs in order to emphasize that having
component IBBs is typically part and parcel of the interpretation of an object
as an IBB of a particular type. In other words, the cogency conditions for a
reasonable interpretation of an object's inputs and outputs will typically men-
tion various internal states of that object (e.g., its intentions, desires, beliefs,
etc.). Of course, having a particular componential structure is not a criterion
for interpreting an object as an IBB of a particular type, but having a
particular componential structure is entailed by the interpretation.
The following is the point of emphasizing that IBBs exhibit differing
amounts of componential structure and that the possession of a particular
componential structure will be one of the cogency conditions for interpreting
an object as an IBB of a particular type: cognitivism is not simply a commit-
ment to the claim that "the mind is to be understood as an IPS," but rather that
the mind is to be understood as an IPS having a rich componential structure.
It is not simply that cognitivists think that the abilities of human IPSs can be
explained in terms of the interaction of components "working through" a ra-
tionale for whatever outputs they collectively produce. They also believe that
explanations in terms of such rationales will be sufficiently rich in detail to
provide genuine illumination and understanding; IPS-explanations will
provide the explanatory force in a mature psychological theory. Haugeland's
ungraduated distinction between IBBs that are IPSs and those that are not
obscures this belief. Haugeland thus overlooks what is surely the most
serious threat to the cognitivist enterprise, namely, IPS-explanations of
human abilities may prove to be so impoverished as to be uninteresting. It is
precisely this threat of explanatory poverty that lends importance to current
attempts to extend the domain of cognitivism beyond that explicitly licensed
by the cogency conditions on IPSs: cognitivists attempt to enrich the
componential structure of the IPSs that they study by postulating "uncon-
scious" information processing. If such structurally enriched IPSs prove un-
able to model satisfactorily the behaviors that they are intended to explain,
then cognitivism will have shown itself to be explanatorily impoverished. The
explanatory burden of a mature psychological theory will then have to be
shouldered not by the IPS-explanations of that theory but by its instantiating
explanations.
Haugeland's discussion in section 7 of skills and understanding is
intended to suggest that attempts to extend the domain of cognitivism in this
way will fail. Perhaps Haugeland is right; it is too soon to tell. But even if he
is, that will not show (as Haugeland seemingly believes) that cognitivism is
false. For given the firmly entrenched place of cognitivism in common-sense
psychology, we would surely reconstrue cognitivist explanations in such a
way as to make them "approximately true" under succeeding theories. Of
course, the eventuality that Haugeland envisions would show cognitivism to
be trivial, and that would hardly be less momentous than showing it to be
false.

Cognitivism, psychology, and physics. After reading Haugeland's excellent
and stimulating paper several times, I found myself wondering whether there
was enough disagreement between us to provide the basis for a significant
critical commentary. I agree with him that cognitivism is an important and,
perhaps, quite a promising approach to certain areas of psychological in-
quiry. However, I italicized the "perhaps" because I share all of Haugeland's
doubts and misgivings about its probable success and, especially, about its
scope. Haugeland appreciates and emphasizes ". . . the depth and scope of
psychology's pretheoretic purview," and I share his intimated doubt that
cognitivism can successfully cope with problems outside a rather narrowly
limited portion of this purview.
One of the two main tasks of this commentary will be to argue that the limi-
tations of cognitivism seem to be even more severe than Haugeland indi-
cates. The other task will be to explore what Haugeland calls "modern
wisdom," to the effect that psychology is, in principle, completely reducible
to physics. The discussion will, I hope, reveal that this latter task is not
entirely irrelevant insofar as the limitations of cognitivism are concerned.
Regarding the first point, consider what Haugeland calls the ". . . long and
tortured tradition in philosophy for distinguishing two kinds of mental
phenomena: roughly, cognitive or intellectual states versus felt qualities or
the purely sensuous given." In other terms, this is the distinction between
"sapience" and "sentience" or, in still others, between perception, cognition,
and ratiocination (all cognitive) on the one hand, and sensations, "raw feels,"
and so forth, on the other (Feigl, 1961, 1967). This distinction may suffer from
borderline fuzziness; in fact, it may well be that every (conscious) instance of
sentience is tainted with some degree of sapience and vice versa - or, even,
that sentience (sensation, etc.) is one of the principal vehicles for sapience
(cognition, etc.). In spite of this, however, it seems undeniable that the dis-
tinction is not only viable but also that it is of fundamental importance. Now,
information processing systems, as such, and, therefore, cognitivism, are
concerned only with the sapient (cognitive) aspects of mental processes. It
is true, as Haugeland suggests, that ". . . noncognitive [sentient] states . . .
[may]... be effective . . . [cognitively]. . . insofar as they . . . generate quasi-
linguistic representations ('red there now,' 'left foot hurts') which can be ac-
cepted as inputs by the cognitive IPS." But, in any given case, to call atten-
tion to the fact that, say, a certain sensation is "generating" such a
representational input is to step outside the purview of information process-
ing and to begin what Haugeland calls "de-interpretation," "explanation by
instantiation," and a kind of "nonintentional reduction." The sensation is an
actual vehicle for the cognitive process. In this reductive step, (a component
of) the cognitive process is "reduced" to a sensation. But this is irrelevant as
. far as the structure of the cognitive system is concerned and, thus, it is no
concern of cognitivism. If this is true, then both the intrinsic and the causal
properties of sentient events are completely outside the purview of
cognitivism. Such events include, I maintain, not only pains and the sensory
qualities, but also emotions, moods, essential components of aesthetic and
even intellectual enjoyment and appreciation; in short, it is such events,
states, and processes that comprise the most vital core of the "human spirit."
It seems to me, therefore, that Haugeland is wrong when he suggests that
"there is no way to tell yet" whether cognitivism (the study of information
processing systems) is ". . .at last the key to unlocking . . . [the mystery of the
human spirit]." It is not, as he intimates, an "empirical" matter as to whether
or not cognitivism can provide a comprehensive, exhaustive approach to all
areas of psychology. Just as we knew (or should have known) all along that
behaviorism could not provide such an approach (because we knew all
along that we have rich "private, inner" experience - joys, sorrows, thoughts,
pleasures, and pains), so we already know that a large, valuable portion of
our experience is beyond the scope of cognitivism. Given the nature of our
experience, this is not an empirical matter. It follows from the very limits that
cognitivism sets for itself that much of the most vital purview of psychology is
beyond these limits.
in spite of all of this, I still think it quite reasonable to believe that
psychology (including the "human spirit" as part of its subject matter) can, in
principle, be completely reduced to physics. It would be reduction of a
somewhat special kind but still reduction in a clear, precise, all-out fashion.
But perhaps I should warn that, in such a reduction, a portion of physics
would, in a somewhat different though still quite similar sense, be reduced to
psychology.
I take the subject matter of physics to be the manifold of physical events
and the causal, spatiotemporal relations that hold among these events. To be
a physical event is to occupy a position in the spatiotemporal, causal net-
work. Brain events comprise a subclass of the class of physical events, and
to be a brain event is to occupy a position in an appropriate portion of the

Commentary/Haugeland: 
The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
neurophysiological causal network. (I shall assume without argument that
neurophysiology is, in principle, reducible to physics. Admittedly, this is not
uncontroversial. It is questioned, I believe, by Fodor, 1978.) I now suggest
the contingent hypothesis that mental events, in all of their mentalistic, quali-
tative, experiential richness, occupy positions in a certain appropriate por-
tion of the neurophysiological causal network, that is, that every mental event
is (also) a brain event. It would follow that mental events are (also) physical
events and, therefore, part of the subject matter of physics.
It must be emphasized that I am not indulging in verbal trickery. It must be
required for the reduction that mental events are discovered to be an integral
part of the spatiotemporal, causal network that will be adopted by a
"Utopian" or a "completed" physics. Whether or not this will be or would be
the case is a contingent matter. (It is still another contingent matter, of
course, as to whether or not we shall ever discover that such a reduction is, or
is not, possible.)
Now, if the reduction is possible, all mental events are of course, physical
events. But it also would follow, assuming that there are genuinely mental
events, that some physical events are genuinely mental. This is what I meant
when I said that a portion of physics would be "reduced" to psychology.
Is it absurd to hold that some genuinely physical events are also genuinely
mental? Not, I believe, unless one has a hankering for old-fashioned, Hob-
besian, everything-is-matter-in-motion materialism. Such a view is already
rendered untenable by contemporary physics (to say nothing of introspec-
tion, even with "all of its ills," as Haugeland puts it).
But, I may still be asked, is it not absurd to try to "fit" mental events into the
same spatiotemporal, causal network with forces, fields, electrons, elec-
tromagnetic quanta, and so forth? Surely, it may be objected, these are quali-
tatively in a different "category" from that one that contains mental
phenomena. This is precisely what I want to deny, or, rather, I want to main-
tain that it is not necessarily the case. Physics, properly construed, has here-
tofore been concerned only with the spatiotemporal, causal structure of
families of events. For example, a family of events with one kind of structure
is called an "electron," one with another kind of structure a "train of elec-
tromagnetic radiation," and so forth. Properly construed, physics has been
â¢ entirely noncommital concerning the qualitative or the instrinsic properties
exemplified in individual events. This leaves open the possibility that some
physical events (some brain events, we believe) just are intrinsically our
pains, pleasures, thoughts, and so forth, as we live through them in all of their
qualitative richness. (For a detailed explanation of this view, which was also
advocated by Schlick, 1974, Russell, 1948, Feigl, 1961, and others, see my
works, 1976 and 1978forthcoming).
Let us consider a computer of whose inner composition we are ignorant.
Suppose that after observing its inputs and outputs at some length we begin
to theorize about its inner mechanisms. This could be done in several ways.
Let us suppose that, in our case, we proceed by theorizing that the computer
is composed of various units of "hardware." We then concern ourselves only
with constructing theories about the causal interactions among these units.
We are not concerned with what the individual units are; we remain noncom-
mital about their chemical composition, their qualitative aspects, their in-
trinsic nature. There is a strong analogy between this kind of investigation
and the kind of inquiry conducted by neurophysiologists and physicists in
their study of the brain. Now suppose we expand the scope of our study of the
computer. Either by further theorizing or by examining directly the interior
mechanism, do we discover things about the "hardware." We find out what at
least some of these internal units are; we learn something about their
instrinsic nature. The corresponding analogy for the brain is simply that we
develop and test neurophysiological and psychophysiological theories that
provide information about the intrinsic nature of a select subset of brain
events - information that these brain events are also mental events of certain
specific kinds. Some of these will be sensations, "raw feels," and so forth,
and, thus, will be at the noncognitive end of the spectrum. Some of these may
even turn out to be "vehicles" for cognitive activity, as we saw above; and
then there are also those mental events (that are also brain events) that are
directly cognitive in nature. Insofar as we can put the cognitive activity of the
brain in analogy with IPS computer activity, we must seriously countenance
the possibility that some of the "hardware" involved is genuinely mental.

Competence cognitivism vs. performance cognitivism. Haugeland's
description of the attractions of cognitivism convinced me that I have long
been a cognitivist, although I would not try to give cognitive explanations to
all mental phenomena. His challenges to cognitivism are interesting, and
here are some tentative ideas for meeting them.
We first distinguish competence cognitivism from performance cogni-
tivism. Competence cognitivism tries to relate the output of a mental process
to its inputs as the result of a deduction from its premises. Performance
cognitivism regards the actual mechanism as a process of deduction. I
would support performance cognitivism for some mental phenomena and
competence cognitivism for many more. Arguments that the human brain ob-
tains some of its results faster than can be accounted for by deductive
processes are proper challenges to performance cognitivism but not to
competence cognitivism. Thus we may cognitivistically relate the output of a
skilled action to its input without postulating a deductive internal
mechanism.
Performance cognitivism needs more precision, because it is not clear
when a mechanism is to be considered cognitive, even in machines. In
particular, pattern matching mechanisms are quite varied, and some of them
are closer than others to deductive reasoning.
Here is a conjecture about "understanding." A person can deal with a sym-
bolic input in either of two ways. First, he can manipulate it according to rules
he has learned, and, second, he can translate it into his "internal language."
Only in the latter case can he combine it freely with other information to draw
conclusions. We say that someone has information but does not understand
it when he can manipulate the symbols as objects but has not translated
enough of it into his "internal language." The main symptom of lack of under-
standing is a failure to draw certain conclusions from symbolic information
that seem "obvious" to those who do understand. This phenomenon offers no
problems to cognitivism of either kind, provided we distinguish symbolic
expressions from the information they express.
The most difficult of Haugeland's challenges to cognitivism is the problem
of how moods affect reasoning. It is most acute if we imagine moods to be
chemical; for example, a melancholy mood is just a high concentration of
"melancholine" in the blood-together with its effects. How can this affect
what long term goals seem worth pursuing, as moods often do? My pro-
posals here are tentative and certainly require revision. The presence of
melancholine might cause certain sources of sentences to come into con-
sciousness with higher probability, or to present themselves with greater ur-
gency, or to come with greater frequency. This assumes that the information
retrieval system that determines what comes into consciousness is partly
nonlogical. Likewise it inhibits other sources of sentences. The presence of
melancholine might give rise to the sentence "I am melancholy." Perhaps
this sentence has no special effect by itself, but can trigger learned effects.
The sentence "I am melancholy" might be used logically by the information
retrieval mechanism. Thus there might be rules saying something like "If I am
melancholy, I should list things that might go wrong." This might work, but it
seems subjectively implausible.
All these hypotheses require an explanation of a phenomenon that occurs
in many other contexts. A certain set A of sentences can lead to a conclusion
p. Another set B, consistent with A and maybe even containing A, can lead to
the conclusion~ip. McCarthy (1978) ascribes this to a method of conjectural
reasoning we call circumscription induction. Briefly, applying circumscrip-

tion induction involves jumping to the conclusion that the objects whose
existence follows from a set A of sentences are all the objects there are in a
certain class. This conclusion may lead in turn to the conclusion p. Enlarging
A to B may bring in new objects, and this may lead toip. Without some such
mechanism we would not be able to draw contradictory conclusions from
consistent sets of information merely by neglecting part of it.

Cognitivism and cognitive psychology. Haugeland gives an abstract
characterization of a position he calls "Cognitivism" and then gives reasons
for doubting its eventual success. He does not clearly explain the relation
between cognitivism and cognitive psychology. As I understand his view,
cognitivism is a philosophical position underlying cognitive psychology,
which is a branch of scientific, research. He apparently holds that the philo-
sophical position leads to a program of empirical and theoretical research
committed to a certain sort of explanation of intelligent behavior. The re-
search program, he thinks, will have great difficulty producing adequate
explanations of the approved sort for certain phenomena that fall within its
domain, notably moods, skills, and understanding.
Haugeland's paper is an excellent example of one kind of thing
philosophers can usefully do for psychology: to explicate the philosophical
underpinnings of important approaches in research. His accounts of expla-
nation and reduction (instantiation) in cognitive psychology are masterful
and convincing, and his careful analysis leading to definitions of "intentional
black box" and "information processing system" is a model of good philo-
sophical procedure. I find his defense of the two "cornerstones" of cognitive
psychology persuasive, and also his defense of the view that cognitive
psychology need not have the structure of physics in order to be a legitimate
science.
I shall confine my critical remarks to the characterization of cognitivism
and to the "hurdles." First, it is disappointing not to find a definition of
cognitivism as clear and careful as those offered for "intentional black box"
and "information processing system." To characterize it as the view that the
mind is an IPS is suggestive but not really adequate. Although psychologists
are beginning once again to use the term "mind" without embarrassment or
contempt, it is not clear enough in meaning to figure in an analytical defini-
tion. It would also have been helpful to have been provided with a clear
characterization of the relationship between cognitivism and cognitive
psychology, a clear description of the domain of phenomena relevant to
each, and an account of their explanatory obligations. Without these, the
evaluation of the "hurdles" becomes more difficult.
Second, while it does seem to me that Haugeland's analysis captures the
abstract form of an important class of theories in cognitive psychology, it
also seems to me that cognitive psychology includes theories that are not
cognitivistic in his sense. I have in mind image mediation theories, which are
often advanced as explicit alternatives to theories using (quasi) linguistic
coding. To give just one example, the work of Shepard and Metzler (1971,
op. cit.) seems to support the view that subjects accomplish some mental
tasks by performing mental operations with images, rather than by abstract-
ing features and translating them into a code.
Third, not all cognitive theories that make use of,quasi-linguistic coding
look like models of a process of reasoning the problem through. Many simply
exhibit a computer-like routine that will automatically produce the correct
output for given inputs (Clark & Chase, 1972, present just one of many possi-
ble examples). Does running witlessly through such a routine constitute rea-
soning a problem through? In Haugeland's discussion of this aspect of an
IPS I sense a confusion between generating the right outputs and generating
a method for producing the right outputs. By his own definitions I should have
thought that an IPS would simply produce outputs and not rationales for
them. The rationale for the output would be built into the structure and opera-
tion of the IPS. We explain how an IPS arrives at its output for a given input by
showing the intervening sequence of information-processing steps, and we
explain the correctness or reasonableness of outputs by showing how a
device constructed in that way must (barring malfunction, interference, etc.)
produce correct or reasonable answers. The distinction between generating
a method and generating outputs by that method is important, because it
points to an important difference in research problems in cognitive
psychology. There is the general problem of inventing models of routines by
which human beings solve problems of specific types (such as three-term
series problems), and there is the more fundamental problem of explaining
how we come up with the routines we use, that is, how we put together the
programs by means of which we solve these problems.
I find Haugeland's discussion of potentially serious hurdles for cognitivism
the hardest part of his paper to grasp. I gather that the significant point about
moods is that they can affect intelligent behavior and, therefore (by
cognitivist lights), the outputs of IPSs, while not being components of or
inputs into those IPSs. But there are many noncognitive states and processes
that affect cognitive functioning: emotions, desires, motivation, deprivation,
arousal, hormonal imbalances, fatigue, sleepiness, drug-induced states,
tension, stress, shock, trauma, neurosis, psychosis, brain damage, birth
defects, fever, nausea, disease, pain, and hiccups, to name a few. Why does
Haugeland single out moods for special treatment? I am unable to follow the
discussion of "segregation," but the principle Haugeland lays down (that
segregated noncognitive states can be effective in determining intelligent
behavior only insofar as they somehow generate quasi-linguistic representa-
tions that can be accepted as inputs by the cognitive IPS) seems arbitrary
and much too severe. I do not see why a cognitivist could not maintain that
noncognitive states and processes can simply disrupt the cognitive ma-
chinery in various ways, without there being inputs into the machinery con-
cerning them. On the other hand, I agree with Haugeland (if this is one of his
points) that noncognitive influences on intelligent behavior fall within the re-
search domain of cognitive psychology, and that these are a potentially trou-
blesome area.
The skills Haugeland mentions as he presents his prima facie reasons for
doubting that the etiology of skillful behavior is cognitive are all conspic-
uously motor skills. While some cognitive processing is certainly involved in
learning motor skills (the typist must read, the ping-pong player must follow
the ball), it is indeed implausible (not to say absurd) to suppose that we learn
them by exclusively cognitive means. But why this constitutes any sort of
difficulty for cognitivism escapes me. Here the absence of an account of the
explanatory 
obligations 
of cognitivism and its domain of relevant
phenomena makes itself felt.
As Haugeland continues his discussion of skills, it begins to appear that
what bothers him is that skills are often exercised without conscious thought.
He implies that a theory of skills in terms of unconscious information
processing could not be cognitivistic, because such processing would go
much faster and be much more efficient than conscious thought. All of this
comes as a great surprise. The stock in trade of cognitive psychology has
been the explanation of skills and abilities that we exercise in a flash â
recognition and identification of familiar patterns and objects, understand-
ing speech, remembering familiar facts, solving trivial logic problems. These
explanations have quite commonly been in the form of models that seem to fit
Haugeland's requirements for being cognitivistic. There is nothing in his
analysis to suggest that an IPS cannot work unconsciously, very fast, and
very efficiently. So I simply cannot see the difficulty that skills are supposed
to pose for cognitivism. It is also startling to find conscious thought
presented as the archetype of cognitive processing. The cognitive move-
ment in psychology has clearly taken as its principal archetype the computer
routine, as Haugeland himself seems to acknowledge in his last section.
In his discussion of understanding, Haugeland is talking about very high
level cognitive performance, which cognitive psychology is perhaps not
ready to tackle. After all, we still do not understand how a person is able to
recognize a dog or remember that all dogs are animals. It is difficult to judge
whether "insight" constitutes a problem for cognitivism. A cognitive
psychologist would scarcely be able to approach the topic without a clearer
analysis of it and some experimentally demonstrated facts concerning it.
But whether or not there is an IPS explanation of insight, there may very
well be some intelligent human performances that cognitive psychologists
will be unable to explain by means of cognitivistic theory in Haugeland's
sense. If so, what would be the consequences for cognitivism and cognitive
psychology? Haugeland suggests (but never says) that the two stand or fall
together. This is surely not so. Cognitive psychologists are free to invent

modes of theorizing and conceptions of human information processing that
do not conform to the cognitivist paradigm. (Image processing is apparently
one such mode; holographic processing may be another.) If some intelligent
behavior requires such innovative explanations, then cognitivism will have to
be abandoned as the exclusive account of cognitive processes. That would
not necessarily mean that all cognitivistic explanations must be scrapped,
for they work where they work. And it would not mean the death of cognitive
psychology, but only of one perhaps rather narrow and confining conception
of what, in the abstract, cognitive psychology is supposed to do.

Haugeland's first hurdle. Moods may indeed pose a problem for cognitivist
explanation. Moods are general states of consciousness (certain ways of be-
ing conscious, certain chronic modifications of one's consciousness) during
which, typically, a great variety of conscious mental episodes (perceptions,
thoughts, etc.) occur. [At work here are two senses of consciousness: (1) A
conscious mental episode is one that is conscious* (see the numbered
entries under "consciousness" in the Oxford English Dictionary) It is, or can
readily become, an object of direct awareness such that the person whose
mental episode it is becomes, noninferentially, aware of its occurrence. (2)
The other uses of "conscious" and "consciousness," in the preparenthetic
sentence pertain to consciousnesse. The Dictionary defines consciousness6
as "the state of being conscious, regarded as the normal condition of healthy
waking life." To be consciouse is "to have one's mental faculties actually in
an active and waking state." While we are consciouse, we pass through
moods, which are certain ways of being consciouse. They are modifications
of our consciousnesse, though they are not departures from it.] Haugeland
suggests that the problem about moods lies in the evidently widespread
influence a mood can have on which mental episodes occur while it holds
sway; how these effects come about does not seem to him to be open to
intentional interpretation.
Moods do not have their pervasive effects as a consequence of our being
conscious of their occurrence (although, of course, we are often aware of be-
ing cheerful, melancholy, etc.). No view is proffered here, however, on how
moods function to produce their far-reaching effects. Instead, it is questioned
whether cognitivism requires that all noncognitive causes of intelligent be-
havior be mediated by representations of those causes, for this requirement
is supposed to be a source of the difficulty about moods.
The aim of cognitivist explanation is to account for the intelligent behavior
of objects (or organizations of objects) construed as information-processing
systems. These systems consist of concrete intentional black boxes as func-
tional components that interact to produce the outputs of the system. The
inputs and outputs of the system and of the component black boxes are said
by Haugeland to possess intrinsic properties (a) that are not included in the
intentional interpretation of the input-output relations, and (b) whose
existence removes any mystery about how intentionally interpreted states
might be in the world. As objects in nature, information-processing systems
are potentially subject to myriad noncognitive influences; some of which
surely affect intelligent behavior. Think of the effects drugs called "con-
sciousness-expanding" can have on cognitive processes.
Cognitivist explanation of such influences on intelligent behavior is not
ruled out by their noncognitive character. Presumably, they have their effects
on intelligent behavior by modifying the function and interaction of the inten-
tional black boxes that comprise the particular information-processing
system. Thus, the new input-output patterns (when under the influence)
would be explained systematically and without a "change of dimension."
Cognitivist theories, which presuppose certain regularities, would be formu-
lated with regard to alternative input-output patterns of the various functional
components and alternative interactions among them.
We know that some information-processing systems have different possi-
ble settings; they have the ability to function in different modes. In other
words, the pattern of their input-output relationships is subject to systematic
variation through determinate and reversible changes in how their
components function and interact. Perhaps a change in mood brings about a
change in mode in this sense.
The regularities presupposed by cognitivist explanation of this kind are not
all interpretable intentionally; certain noncognitive influences are not
mediated by representations of those influences, or by other (literal) inputs.
These regularities must be treated as unexplained, as long as one remains
within the framework of cognitivist science. They pertain to certain variable
noncognitive conditions of cognitive functioning in the world.
How Haugeland expresses his view of moods as a serious hurdle for
cognitivism suggests that he may have in mind another characteristic of
moods (in addition to their pervasive influence). He writes of them as affect-
ing and permeating all kinds of cognitive states and processes. Perhaps one
cannot treat them merely as causes because they "infect" the conscious
mental episodes they affect and "transform their meanings." When one is
melancholy, everything seems greyer, duller, and less livable; one might
have said that moods "color" our perceptions, thoughts, memories, expecta-
tions, and so forth. Haugeland seems on the verge of proposing that a mood
provides conscious mental episodes, which occur while the mood holds
sway, with a certain qualitative character, and that this qualitative character
is ignored by cognitivist explanation, which interprets all the component
inputs and outputs of any information-processing system as quasi-linguistic
representations.
In a less obscure context, Haugeland does mention this sort of objection to
cognitivism, but only to dismiss the objection. Others suppose it is a problem
that certain conscious mental episodes (e.g., visual awarenesses) have a
qualitative character that plays no role in cognitivist explanation. But Hauge-
land assumes all such mental episodes are noncognitive causes of inputs
that can be interpreted as quasi-linguistic representations (e.g., a certain
noncognitive sense-impression produces an episode of seeing what color
the grass is).
Once we recognize that particular conscious mental episodes are often
both cognitive and qualitative, the problem for cognitivism reasserts itself.
For example, seeing that the grass over there is green involves (a) the occur-
rence of a quasi-linguistic representation (greenness predicated of the
grass) and also (b) the qualitative presence of the grass. In other words, the
grass is not just known or thought to be green; there is also its concrete per-
ceptual (i.e., visual) presence, its specific qualitative presence in the visual
modality. The mental episode would not be an episode of seeing without its
qualitative character.
It needs to be shown that a component input's (or output's) being qualita-
tive makes (or does not make) a difference to the explanation of intelligent
behavior. Qualitative character may be a matter of intrinsic properties inde-
pendent of intentional interpretation. Or qualitative character may be implicit
in the meanings assigned to certain inputs and outputs by cognitivist expla-
nation. That is, an interpretation of input along the lines of "this grass is
green" may suffice as part of an explanation for certain intelligent behavior
(e.g., snapping a picture of grass) only because it is taken to mean that the
grass was qualitatively present in the visual way.
Why might reference to qualitative character be necessary for the explana-
tion of intelligent behavior? The reason can only be sketchily indicated here.
A degree of perceptual determinateness is often required by intelligent be-
havior, a degree that cannot be provided in most cases by the conceptual
aspect of a perception. In such cases, it is by virtue of the qualitative
presence of the object or scene (to be behaved towards) that the respective
mental episode's reference is fixed. Perceptions, as quasi-linguistic
representations, would often be assigned a meaning in terms of demonstra-
tive constructions. As in the parallel linguistic case, in which full interpreta-
tion requires an extralinguistic act, the interpretation of perceptual inputs
must include the extraquasi-linguistic dimension of qualitative presence in
order to tie the perceptual reference down to a specific environmental cause
of the input.

A program is not an explanation. Systematic explanation differs from deri-
vational-nomological in that the former, but not the latter, necessarily ap-
peals to "specific structures" and the "abilities or dispositions" possessed
by these structures. On the other hand, it differs from morphological explana-

Commentary/Haugeland: 
The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
tion by the reference it must make to a "complexly organized pattern of inter-
dependent interactions" (section 2). Granting such distinctions, one can
argue, as Haugeland does, that the problem of "significance" or "meaning-
fulness," that is, the problem of "connecting 'meanings' with the physical
order of cause and effect," can be circumvented (section 3). This is done by
locating, in the subject matter, interpreted functional units (IBBs or "inten-
tional black boxes") and then, without "de-interpreting," providing a
systematic explanation of the workings of such units. Where this can be
done, the set of such units is called an information processing system (IPS).
The great advantage of Cognitivism then, is that because of this unique
methodology, we are able validly to regard the mind as an IPS. Hence,
"intelligent behavior is to be explained by appeal to internal 'cognitive
processes'. . . interpretable as working out a rationale" (section 4).
Now, what objection do I have to all this? Certainly it is not to the general
thrust, for I am impressed with Cognitivism and its potential. Rather, I am
uneasy about certain premises that seem to me not only to render the argu-
ment inadequate to its task, but that could be seriously misleading as well.
First, I am not yet convinced that there are, in fact, distinct "styles" of
scientific explanation. From Haugeland's examples, I can conclude no more
than that there are differences of complexity among various explanations. By
this I simply mean that when properly formulated an explanans may involve a
chain of more than one deductive argument, and when it does, the "laws"
utilized as premises in the component arguments need not all be drawn from
the same scientific discipline. Thus, unified science is not ruled out merely
on logical grounds, nor are we led to make metaphysical presuppositions
about subject matters. The paradigm shift is not one of explanatory style, but
rather one of change of view regarding the "rational agent." Cognitivism
firmly rejects the old view of the mind as passive (Locke's tabula rasa) in
favor of a dynamic model. And, thus, although Cognitivism's underlying pat-
tern of explanation need not differ from that of the other sciences, it is re-
quired that new symbolic means with which to express this dynamic aspect
be devised. As I see it, this is exactly what the program flow chart, with its
logic of command, feedback, and conditional branching, provides. It is a
new species of mathematics. The computer then sets the empirical
constraints (see Pylyshyn et al, BBS 1:1,1978) and provides for testing
consistency and completeness. But the program is not itself an explanation;
rather, it is a concrete application of one. To illustrate: a chess program is to
an explanation of chess-playing behavior as, say, a prototype of an airfoil is
to an explanation of aerodynamic lift.

Mind and brain revisited: forestalling the doom of cognitivism. Haugeland
argues that if cognitivism fails as a suitable metatheory for psychology, the
problem of moods might be its Achilles' heel. I would like to examine a class
of problems that may offer similar headaches for cognitive theorists, and
suggest two possibilities that imply the existence of reasonable solutions
within a cognitivist framework and a third that seems far less tractable.
Why should moods seem so problematic to Haugeland? Surely it is not be-
cause a cognitivist account of their effects on thought processes is impossi-
ble. After all, the cognitivist's bag of explanatory tricks contains the full
power of a Turing Machine, and it would be a routine (if tedious) matter to
add boxes and arrows to information-flow diagrams that would suitably
readjust the estimates of subjective probabilities, assignments of salience to
stimuli, affective evaluations of other people, and so forth. What must
concern Haugeland, and legitimately so, is the possibility that the effects of
moods cannot be incorporated into a cognitivist theory of thought in a princi-
pled or elegant way. Similar doubts can be raised (although Haugeland does
not invoke them) concerning the effects of development, senility, drug states,
schizophrenia, and brain damage. What these cases share is that thinking
seems to be affected in a drastic, pervasive, and qualitative manner, physio-
logical factors are or may be implicated, and elegant cognitive accounts
seem elusive. I hope to show that the latter two conditions may be intimately
related.
As Haugeland notes, most investigators assume that a bridge between
physiology and cognition exists at the level of the lowest or smallest units of
cognitive explanation. This is an obvious parallel to the way that computer
programs can be written in high-level languages, themselves programmed
in lower-level languages, and so on down to the level of the machine lan-
guage that is physically instantiated in the circuitry of the computer. For
example, Simon and Newell (1964) speak of a small set of "elementary in-
formation processes" as the atoms of psychological theories and the funda-
mental mechanisms that physiologists must explain; Scott (1977) outlines
seven levels of explanation for brain science, levels five, six, and seven of
which are (respectively) the elements of thought from neural network dy-
namics, psychology from the elements of thought, and human personality
and culture from psychology; and Dennett (unpublished) describes mental
organization as a hierarchical committee of homunculi, the stupidest of
which can be "replaced by machines." Part of the appeal of this scheme is
that it allows cognitive psychology to proceed with a policy of benign
neglect toward physiology, since the "units of thought" have a particular
function in higher-level theories regardless of the exact nature of their
physical instantiation, or, as Haugeland notes, whether they have any
physical instantiation at all.
Given that this scheme is correct, there are two ways of accounting for
extreme qualitative variations in thought such as moods, insanity, develop-
ment, and so forth. One would be to assume that physiology plays no direct
role at all: I have already suggested what such an explanation for moods
might look like. In the case of development, we could imagine that the human
infant is "bootstrapped" with an extremely powerful and intricate program
that interacts with its environment and seems to Change in complex ways that
are similar in principle to the chess-playing programs that learn from their
mistakes, or to a theorem-proving program that uses its solutions to one
problem as a component of its solution to another.
A possible objection to this move is that the minds of a six-month-old and a
twenty-year-old, or of a normal person and a schizophrenic seem so radically
different that it strains credulity to say that a single master program might be
behind them all. If one insisted on describing such a program in detail, it
might look too much like a Rube Goldberg contraption to be plausible; but if
one described the program in a general way, it might be inadequate to ac-
count for the phenomena. The best example of the latter horn of the dilemma
is Piaget's claim (see oper. cit. in Brainerd et al., this issue) that the child's
internal representational system increases in logical power as a result of
certain interactions with the environment that are mediated by that
representational system. As Fodor (1975) and Macnamara (1976) argue,
Piaget cannot have it both ways: either the full logical power is in the
representational system to begin with, or the change is precipitated by fac-
tors external to the representational system itself.
This leads to a second possiblity, that qualitative cognitive effects, such as
the elementary information processes or the buffers and memories they
use, can be brought about by quantitative physiological causes via the
bridge between physiology and cognition. Thus, moods might come on be-
cause of a reallocation of processing capacity to different components,
schizophrenics may have deficient attentional filters, and children may
develop because their short-term memory increases, allowing more plans to
be executed at once (Pascual-Leone, 1970). From here, the baton is passed
to the physiologists, who must explain the substrata of the attentional deficit
or memory growth. This scheme has some plausibility; automata theory
shows that one can delineate classes of algebras, logics, or languages
simply by constraining the size or accessibility of the working memory of the
machines on which the structures can be instantiated. Whether this will work
in the desired way for more complex systems is less certain. Perhaps small
changes at the bridging level can percolate upward through the different
levels of organization until they give the behavior of the system new and
emergent properties; on the other hand, in many instances the system might
simply "crash." In any case, we have a second way that cognitivism might
handle HaugeJand's type of objection.
However, if both of these routes go nowhere, a third and more ominous
possibility exists. It may be that the physiological properties of the nervous
system are tied to cognitive processes at many levels, not just the physical
instantiation of the atoms of information processing. For example, one could
install in a computer hard-wire microprocessors or analog subsystems (say,
a differential analyzer) that could perform extremely complex computations
without being decomposable into machine language instructions or any
other interlingua. An observer unaware of such a modification might be hard
pressed to explain the changes in the computer's behavior in terms of a quirk
in its program or a simple alteration of its buffers or registers. In the case of
human beings, physiological maturation, a bad gene, or the sudden release

Commentary/HsLUgeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
of a neurotransmitter could impinge on hundreds of thousands of individual
neurons in highly specific ways and dramatically affect thought and be-
havior. Again, attempts to explain the changes in terms of accommodations
of cognitive schemas or small adjustments of memory or attentional
mechanisms would be fruitless. If this is true of moods, development, and so
forth, then, indeed, Haugeland is correct in warning that an elegant and
purely cognitive explanation may not exist. This would not necessarily spell
the doom of cognitivism, however, just of cognitive isolationism - cognitive
psychology and physiology would not be islands linked by a two-lane
bridge, but countries sharing a long border. Cognitive theorists could ignore
physiology only at their peril in explaining deviations from normal, cool-
headed adult cogitation. However, since this complicates the task of theory
construction tremendously (there are many more degrees of freedom), it
seems a reasonable strategy for researchers to pursue the first two options,
pretending that the third does not exist, for as long as possible.

Image, information, and fast Fourier transforms. What a refreshingly clear
view of cognitivism Haugeland presents in this paper. He does not dismiss
the cognitive approach as trivial (though it might turn out that way) nor as a
panacea for all of psychology's problems. There are, therefore, only a few
comments that I venture.
Haugeland makes a good case for separating holographic image-
processing from information processing-a distinction that I had not made
so clearly for myself. Miller, Galanter, and I have discussed (1960) Image
and Plan as mutually implying each other. In Haugeland's terms, image-
processing and information-processing are different dimensions, and cogni-
tive scientists need to formulate the rules that allow translation from one to
the other and back again. I believe this is the contribution Yevick (1975op.
cit.) is attempting to make, and it is thus more important than just a
demonstration that a holographically based "logic" can be constructed.
Some of the character of translation rules necessary to Haugeland's "inten-
tional interpretation" of the relationship between image- and information-
processing can be.gauged from a model such as that proposed by Luce and
Green (1972). Their physical instantiation is with regard to patterns of neural
impulses: the departure of interresponse histograms from a Poisson distribu-
tion. But in order to perform the necessary manipulations of data, the authors
resort to computer-processing and specifically to using fast Fourier
transforms (FFT) for convenience. But holography consists of encoding in the
frequency domain, and a physical instantiation of this part of the Luce-Green
model might suggest that the FFT is performed at synaptic junctions. This is
a suggestion that can be supported by a considerable body of data (Pribram,
1971; Pribram, Nuwer, & Baron, 1974 op. cit.). The translation rule from inter-
response time to the frequency domain is thus straightforward. The inverse
Fourier transform provides the computer readout in digital terms, but in this
case the translation* rule is not so easily instantiated in the physical nervous
system. Furthermore, other parts of the Luce-Green model refer to other
processes such as "decisions" that may or may not have anything to do with
holography. The character of any translation of the information-processing
aspect of the model and the holographic (FFT aspects) is therefore not just
the invertibility of the transform (though this is an important component), but
the complex of steps in which the transformation is (or is not) resorted to. As
Haugeland notes: "Who knows what could happen among holograms in
intersecting planes or. . . scattered about in volumes-especially if they
dynamically modified one another in non-chaotic ways? Perhaps we will find
there the translation rules that will bring image processing and information
processing together into a more complete cognitive perspective." Hauge-
land's analysis should help us considerably to know whether attempts at
such a synthesis are spurious or sound.

Are right hemisphere activities cognitivistic? 
Near the end of his paper
Haugeland considers the problem posed for cognitivism by skills. The
greater the degree to which one has mastered a skill, the less its exercise
seems to depend on internal cognitive processes. As he says, this is evi-
denced by our inability to articulate how we do it, by the fact that thought and
deliberation cease at just about the time we come to do it well, and by the
fact that thereafter when we think about what we are doing performance de-
clines. Haugeland says a cognitivist might try to "explain away" these
phenomena by postulating an unconscious information processor at work in
executing skills, but suggests this would be very ad hoc.
However, the examples he gives up to this point - playing ping-pong, typ-
ing, and piano-playing-all involve motor skills, and probably the storing
and running off of such learned movements does depend on unconscious
encephalic mechanisms, in eitherthe cerebellum or the midbrain.
Quite another matter is the question of chess skills, which .Haugeland
considers next, and where also he thinks cognitivism might resort to bringing
in the notion of an unconscious information processor in order to save ap-
pearances. But then, Haugeland says, cognitivists would have to face
Dreyfus' (1975 op. cit.) interesting pointed question, which he recasts as
follows:
"It is known that intermediate, advanced, and great chess players are alike in
consciously considering on the order of a hundred plays in thinking out a
move; they differ in their'skill in problem conception' (deGroot, 1965) - i.e.
in preselecting which moves to think about. Now the rationale for these good
preselections would be enormously long if they were spelled out (many thou-
sands of plays). It's possible that players have some marvelously efficient
unconscious information processor which works through these rationales;
but if so, then why would anyone with such a splendid unconscious ever
bother to deliberate consciously and tediously over a hundred plays? The
implication is that the skillful preselection and the tedious cogitation differ
not just in efficiency and consciousness, but in kind, and that neither could
adequately substitute for the other, [section seven]."
But it does not follow from the chess player's being unconscious of how the
moves he studies in depth were preselected that this preselection was done
unconsciously. For as I have argued (1974), it may just be that despite our in-
tuitions, not only the preselection but the insights necessary for successful
cogitation over the moves one studies in depth are supplied across the fore-
brain commissures by the mute (usually the right) cerebral hemisphere. Nor
is it necessary to suppose that the preselection involves running through
thousands of possible continuations to select the promising ones, as a
digital computer would have to do; the so-called minor hemisphere may
simply see what are attractive lines of development, the way a professional
painter or sculptor can quickly pick out in a huge amateur art exhibit the few
pieces showing talent. It is able to do this, I suggest, because the charac-
teristic cognitive mode of the nondominant (for speech and handedness)
hemisphere is not analytic and sequential but synthetic, holistic or Gestalt,
precisely what one would expect if it is specialized for visuospatial percep-
tion.
Underlying the above argument, of course, is the equally radical assump-
tion that chess-playing is not a matter of deductive inference but of perceiv-
ing dynamic interrelationships on the board, hence requiring not logic so
much as visual imagery. In this connection I refer to another study, by de
Groot (1966), where he found that a five-second exposure to a complicated

Commentary/Hangeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
midgame situation was sufficient for a master, though not for a player of
expert rank, to reproduce the situation on another board with few or no errors;
yet when the pieces were placed at random, so they no longer formed a
meaningful chess pattern, masters did no better than beginners at reproduc-
ing the position. Thus the model for chess appears to be not mathematics in
general but geometry.
Evidence that it is indeed the nonspeaking hemisphere that is dominant for
processing geometrical-type cognitive tasks now seems unassailable.
Franco and Sperry (1977) have recently reported a study in which com-
missurotomy subjects were asked to match objects that they could touch but
not see with geometrical shapes they could see. The superiority of the left
hand (controlled by the right hemisphere) over the right hand (under control
of the left hemisphere) in these right-handed people was consistent
throughout, and increased dramatically as the type of geometrical task
progressed from more to less structural constraints involving Euclidean,
affine, projective, and topological space. Indeed, the disconnected left
hemisphere, using the right hand, performs barely above chance level on to-
pological sets. Normal controls show no significant differences in hand
performance on the same tasks, indicating that the speech hemisphere is
utilizing spatial perception provided by its mute companion through the
intact commissural connections. The authors comment (p. 112):
"The present evidence strongly suggests that. . . preverbal apprehension of
geometrical relations is mainly a right hemisphere function. It seems
therefore likely that right hemisphere operations are primary in the apprehen-
sion of geometrical properties of space and that these only subsequently be-
come susceptible to verbalization. An active interaction of the two hemi-
spheres during processing of geometrical problems seems implied and a
similar interhemispheric integration would seem reasonable also for other
cerebral activities involving spatial intuitions and their linguistic
expression."
Applying this now to chess, I am suggesting that the right cerebral hemi-
sphere processes board situations consciously, but that we who talk and
write and read and calculate are not directly aware of this processing, let
alone how exactly it is done. Thus, if this is correct, cognitivism need not in-
troduce the notion of an unconscious information processor at work on a task
that is, after all, an example par excellence of intelligent behavior.
But that does not mean cognitivism is off the hook where chess skills are
concerned - far from it. For, as I have said before (1975), those who take the
computer as a model of cognitive information processing will be hard put to
assimilate right hemisphere functions to that model. (How will we ever, for
example, devise right hemisphere-type algorithms for a computer?) Thus
Haugeland and Dreyfus may be on the right track here, even if they have got
the mechanism wrong. Cognitivists have a lot left to explain.

Worries about Haugeland's worries. I am sympathetic to Haugeland's sym-
pathies with cognitivism in psychology. Cognitivism does seem to promise
an account of many human and animal states and behavior, one that is
"rigorous and empirical," while, unlike behaviorism, its predecessor in this
line, at the same time preserving many of our antecedent mentalistic intui-
tions. It seems to offer what Haugeland has aptly described as a
"systematic," and, I would add, naturalistic framework within which to ac-
commodate many of our beliefs about, for example, our own beliefs and
desires and their causes and effects in the world around us.
But I am worried about Haugeland's worries. He sees cognitivism as hav-
ing to confront three "serious hurdles": "moods, skills and understanding."
Comparing his descriptions of these hurdles with his characterization of
cognitivism, however, it is very difficult to see just what is so serious about
them. They seem to have little or nothing to do with the cognitivism Hauge-
land describes. It is worth making the comparison in considerable detail,
thereby we hope, assuaging Haugeland's, and perhaps many others', fears.
Consider skills. Haugeland claims (1) that they are independent of "articu-
lateness" about them; (2) that "thought and deliberation" are in fact often ex-
cluded by their exercise; and (3) that their exercise is often "faster than
thought." (By "thought" he appears to mean-as, on pain of begging
the question, he must mean - conscious thought.) These claims all seem
plausible enough. Haugeland asserts that they constitute "three prima
facie . . . reasons for doubting that the etiology of skillful behavior is cogni-
tive." But, prima facie as they may be, they seem to have nothing whatever to
do with cognitivism as Haugeland has defined it. "The fundamental idea of
Cognitive Psychology," Haugeland writes, is that "intelligent behavior is to
be explained by appeal to internal 'cognitive processes'"-meaning,
essentially, processes interpretable as working out a rationale. Cognitivism,
then, can be summed up in a slogan: "the mind is to be understood as an
IPS." Understanding, Haugeland's chess-playing Black Box as an IPS; for
example, "means there is a systematic explanation of how it manages to
come up with legal and plausible moves as such, regardless of how it
manages to . . . do whatever it does that gets interpreted as those moves."
Surely he might have added: "and regardless of whether it deliberates, has
conscious thoughts, or is capable of providing, as further output, representa-
tions of how it manages to come up with those moves." At any rate, no such
conditions of "deliberation," "conscious thought," or "articulateness" are in-
cluded in his definitions either of cognitivism, of an IPS, or of an IBB. And
would it not be odd to add them? In the first place, his very paradigm of an
IPS, that very Black Box, would directly fail to satisfy them (or is it, and
Minsky's machines at M.I.T., to be regarded as somehow conscious, and all
that goes with it? If they are, then so might we be, even when we would least
suspect it.) In the second place, such conditions would seem to have
precious little to do with the regularities cognitivism is attempting
"systematically" to explain. Inputs and outputs can presumably "make
reasonable sense" whether or not the system also engages in self-monitor-
ing. Indeed, I would have thought that part of the empirical respectability of
cognitivism derived from its focus upon these sense-making regularities,
instead of depending upon "the supposedly disreputable method of in-
trospection."
In the light of all this, it is thus especially disconcerting to notice Hauge-
land's scorn for the "unconscious." He does argue, quite plausibly, that
"skillful [unconscious] pre-selection and . . . tedious [conscious] cogitation
differ not just in efficiency and consciousness, but in kind": there certainly do
seem to be all sorts of dramatic differences between conscious and noncon-
scious processes. But he has provided no reason whatsoever for thinking this
difference in kind coincides with the difference between the cognitive and
the noncognitive. On the contrary, the examples of his Black Box, modern
computers, many animal behaviors, and most human ones (e.g., understand-
ing natural languages, working out unconscious motives) all suggest that the
difference is one that ought to be drawn within the realm of the cognitive.
(And, indeed, one might rightly demand of a cognitive theory that it explain
just what it is about self-monitoring and conscious cogitation that makes
them, while inefficient, so useful. I see no reason why such a theory could not
meet that demand.)
Put another way: it is not that cognitive processes are, as they have been
traditionally assumed to be, prima facie conscious, with their occasional un-
consciousness calling for the explanation. Rather, as Haugeland's and
others' accounts of cognitivism suggest, cognitive processes per se need
not involve any consciousness at all: "consciousness," if it is a trait of any-
thing, is a trait of only some states of only some, very special cognoscenti,
some particularly complex IPSes, namely, human beings. At any rate, it
seems to be only human beings that act with "thought" and "deliberation"
and are able to report on some - although, as we know just from Freud, by no
means all - of their cognitive states. What needs explaining is not our uncon-
sciousness, but rather, how in the world we manage to do such remarkable
things as "deliberate," "consciously cogitate," and be so "articulate" about
ourselves, and how those things manage, sometimes, to affect the rest of our
states and behaviors.
A similar discrepancy between Haugeland's "hurdles" and his account of
cognitivism occurs when he worries about moods. He makes quite a number
2 4 6 
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
of claims about moods. Some of them are far from obvious: I do not see that
we are yet in a position to know whether, or to what extent, moods are "in-
ferential," "quasi-linguistic," or "rational." Some of them are simply false: we
constantly justify our melancholy by citing our misfortunes, or our joy by cit-
ing our good luck. And recent work on emotions suggest that at least they are
quite highly cognitive. (See Schachter & Singer, 1962, pp. 380, 398, who
present surprising evidence for their claim that "an emotional state may be
considered a function of a state of physiological arousal and of a cognition
appropriate to this state of arousal.") At any rate, Haugeland's claim that
moods "don't seem at all cognitive" seems just groundless and extravagant.
But even supposing that, oddly enough, moods turn out to be not at all
cognitive, still it is difficult to see how they would therefore constitute a
hurdle to Haugeland's cognitivism. If moods are not part of our "intelligent"
behavior, as Haugeland seems to be claiming, then, again by his own
definition, cognitivism does not even aspire to explain them. Digestion, too,
undoubtedly affects and is affected by cognitive states, while not being itself
cognitive. But surely that is hardly a hurdle for cognitivism!
Moods quite probably lie in an area of psychology that straddles both
cognitive theory and physiology. This is an area that, rather than presenting a
hurdle for cognitivism, is, on reasonable assumptions, demanded by it. Any
purveyor of an IPS explanation - whether cognitive psychologist or computer
scientist-expects his IPS program to be realized in some mechanical me-
dium or other (indeed, it is the fact that it is relatively clear just how an IPS
program can be mechanically realized (cf. Section five) that pace Section
six) lends cognitivism its naturalistic plausibility). In being so realized,
whether in transistors or in quivering protoplasm, there will inevitably be
properties of the realizing material that, while being themselves inessential,
will interact with properties that are essential to the IPS program (consider,
for example, the importance of the time neural transmissions take). These
further properties will therefore be necessary to a full account of the
psychology of the actual, spatiotemporal cognoscentum in question. It
follows that the cognitive theory alone would not be sufficient. People are
embodied minds; moods seem to involve properties of both that mind and
that embodiment, and an account of them involves, therefore, both cognitive
theory and physiology. But that a phenomenon involves both cognitive theory
and physiology is an argument for, not against, cognitivism. From the fact
that cognitive theory is not sufficient as psychology, it does not follow that it
is not necessary.
Lastly, Haugeland is worried about "insight" and "understanding." He
fears that a successful cognitivist theory would "preclude any radically new
ways of understanding things." Now, it is certainly true that a successful
cognitive theory would tell us a great deal more than we presently know
about the constraints we impose upon acceptable, "intelligible" theories: on
what "makes sense." Perhaps, as Haugeland seems to suggest, we not only
have constraints upon theories, but constraints upon constraints upon
theories: "general cogency conditions." It is not easy to focus on precisely
what suggestion Haugeland does have in mind in his discussion of "insight."
The word is introduced to distinguish rote from more conceptual understand-
ing of "what's going on;" but, a few sentences later, it is identified with a
more mete-theoretical "ability to tell when a whole account . . . makes
sense"; and, still later, it seems to involve a mete-mete-theoretical recogni-
tion that "certain new constraints [upon acceptable theories?] constitute a
kind of cogency." Only if all these different levels are run together is it plausi-
ble that "there could be a rationale [at the highest level] only if the new con-
ditions were equivalent to, or a special case of the established ones." I see
every reason for keeping the different levels distinct. However, no matter how
abstract and meta-theoretical the ultimate cogency conditions may turn out
to be, there is still all the difference in the world between knowing those ulti-
mate conditions and knowing the results of applying those conditions to their
respective domains. It is, after all, one thing to understand, or even construct,
a computer program to solve some particular problem, and quite another to
solve the problem oneself. Consider again Haugeland's chess-playing Black
Box: we might well come to understand how the box sorts and weighs dif-
ferent chess positions, how it constrains its moves, without our being able to
employ effectively these sortings, weightings, or constraints ourselves (it
might well be that our applying the Box's procedures through the medium of
our language and "conscious thought" would be inordinately cumbersome
and inefficient). Thus, for all our "insight" into the Box, it might well provide
us ever newer "insights" into chess. Similarly, if we ever did succeed some-
day in understanding the principles Richard Feynman's mind employs in se-
lecting plausible physical theories-or in selecting plausible principles for
selecting plausible theories; or, for some n, in selecting plausible n-order
principles for selecting plausible (n - 1)-order principles-that would be a
far cry from ourselves thinking of those theories, or of those (n - 1)-order
principles We just might not be as "smart" as he is: we may not employ the
principles as well or we may not generate as imaginatively the elements of
the domain to which the principles apply; probably both are true. And so
Feynman might well stun us, as did Galileo, Kepler, and Newton before him,
with "a totally new way of talking about what happens," or even (depending
upon how abstract the operant domain is) "a new way of making it intelligi-
ble." Understanding merely understanding may leave a great deal still to be
understood.
Haugeland is skeptical about isolating the "ultimate general cogency con-
ditions." And perhaps one should not quarrel with a healthy skepticism. But
one should quarrel with weak reasons that nourish it: the fact that "people
who regularly make convergent decisions about the reasonableness of
theories and interpretations don't explicitly work through rationales . . ." we
have already seen to be quite irrelevant to the project of supplying a cogni-
tive account of those decisions. And the fact that "barrels of philosophical
ink have been spilt," attempting to make sense of "making sense," "so far
without success" is just false: try the astonishing advances in logic and the
theory of computation that we have witnessed in the last hundred years! It
seems to me that a good deal more success would be realized in this area
were we not to regard the project so monolithically. The ordinary notion of
"making sense," to none other than which Haugeland must be appealing, in-
volves a variety of very different relations, each of which quite probably re-
quires separate treatment: there are not only the deductive relations explored
in logic, but also what might be called the "practical" relations (among
beliefs, utilities, and actions) explored in decision theory, and the theory of
action; as well as the "inductive relations" (between evidence and "the best
explanation" of it) explored in inductive logic and the philosophy of science.
And still more success might be possible were syntactic sense-making rela-
tions (relations among the representations themselves) treated separately
from semantic ones (relations between representations and what they
represent); and were it remembered that it is not only the relations between
input and output that are important to the cognitivist, but also the relations
between (and the quasi-linguistic character of) the intervening states, which
break the syntactic relations down. Perhaps some of the sources of Hauge-
land's despair about success in this area can be traced to his failure to
consider any of these distinctions. That the work in this area is far from
finished is due in part to the fact that a plausible way of going about it was
not really available until these recent advances were realized; indeed, the
very idea of a cognitive psychology was a result of them.
I suppose the reason for postulating some not-all-that "mysterious and
magnificent," but, to be sure, largely "unconscious," IPS is not merely that it
would "facilitate a tidy account of intelligence," but that it offers the best
promise so far: we can imagine, barely, how the account might go. And that, I
submit, is a great deal more than we can imagine about any alternative,
noncognitive account. [I find Haugeland's discussion of the supposed al-
ternative to cognitivism, holography, very puzzling. Holographic representa-
tions may well not represent parts of a whole by parts of themselves; but they
had better be able to represent parts of a whole somehow. If, for example, a
hologram is going to be able to deal with chess, and specifically with
"moves which are powerful or dangerous," then it had better somehow en-
code those very moves, and it had better encode them as powerful or asdan-
gerous. Thought, after all, does not operate directly upon the world, but upon
encodings (or representations) of the world; that is what makes us, as the
philosophers say, "intensional." I fail to see how holography yet presents a
real alternative to cognitivism as a means of operating rationally on these
representations. Perhaps what Haugeland means to argue here is that
holograms would in some way violate his Goodmanesque, "discreteness"
constraints on an IBB (e.g. definition one, section three); but that should then
argue more against the appropriateness of those constraints than against
cognitivism. I see no reason why a cognitive theory should not concern itself
with computations defined over "analog," over "imagistic," or even over
"holographic" representations: it is the computations and representations
that are essential to the project, not any one particular character they might
have.] But, in any case, mere skepticism is not counter-argument: I fail to see
here the seriousness of the hurdles cognitivism must confront, other than
simply the seriousness of actually succeeding.

A middle ground between neurons and holograms. I think that Hauge-
land's distinctions help us to see more clearly what it would take for "cogni-
tive psychology"-construed as "the information processing hypothesis" -
to succeed. The claim that pattern-recognition achieved through something
like reflection of light between holograms would be a case in which "there
are no distinct functional components whose relevant interactions are
confined to intentionally interpreted articulated typologies" seems to me true
and important. Haugeland has shown that the "What else could it be?"
challenge may have sensible answers.
However, I have some doubts about section 7 of his paper. This section
claims that moods, skills, and understanding are "potentially serious
hurdles" for cognitive psychology. These do not seem hurdles of the same
sort. I agree that moods can be thought of neither on the analogue of felt
qualities (which, as Haugeland says, can be thought of as inputs to the
cognitive IPS) nor as somehow being cognitive. But I should think they could
be "incorporated in a Cognitivist explanation" by treating them as analogues
to variations in the power supply to a computer (too strong or too weak
voltage, or some more complex malfunction). Since moods can easily be
produced by drugs, it seems fairly easy to think of their effect on cognition as
being like the effect of power variations on the efficiency of a computer.
There is no reason why cognitivism should think of anything that affects
ability to process information as itself the processing of information.
When it comes to skills, I think that Haugeland should distinguish more
sharply between, say, the professional typist and the chess master. The
former's skill seems to be one that does not require cognitivist explanation,
because it is so easy to think of it in simple reflex terms (connections
between retinal images and finger motions, or something of the sort). For
such skills, physiology or behaviorism seems enough. Cognitivism would be
superflous. I find it fairly easy to think of my own ability to touch-type as a
matter of rewiring (and thus of what Haugeland calls "de-interpretation" of
myself as IBB) rather than as a matter of information-processing. I doubt that
turning these sorts of skills back over to the physiologist or the behaviorist
would "narrow dramatically the scope and interest" of cognitive psychology.
For skills at chess, conversation, or literary composition, however, I think
Haugeland is right. These skills, however, can be coalesced with what he
calls "understanding" or "insight." The common element is the ability to do
something unexpected and successful. Such skills involve what Aristotle
called "mastery of metaphor," and the notion of a computer program for
choosing metaphors does seem crazy. It seems crazy for the reason Hauge-
land spells out concerning "a rationale for the insightful outputs." Here I
suspect nobody really believes that the IPS model will be of much use
(whereas something like holograms seems much more promising). So I think
that the question that Haugeland poses might best be put as: Is there a mid-
dle ground between what can be turned over to the physiologist (for
example, moods) or the behaviorist (for example, routine skills) and what
must wait upon the discovery of something like holograms in the brain (for
example, "brilliance")? If so, is this middle ground broad enough to make
cognitivism a worthwhile program? These seem to me very good questions
indeed, and we should be grateful to Haugeland for getting them into focus.

Some limits and problems of cognitivism. If cognitivism were merely the
position that psychology should not be limited to describing input-output
relations, and that it is a legitimate scientific enterprise to concern oneself
with internal states and processes, the status of cognitivism would not be
very much in question. After all, even physics cannot get by without postulat-
ing internal theoretical states. But I think Haugeland is correct that
cognitivism, or at least one popular version of it, typically involves the addi-
tional claim that the internal states it postulates are intentional states and the
processes it theorizes about involve the transfer and manipulation of informa-
tion. The cognitivist's claim seems to be that psychological explanation
should involve internal states that have content or "meaning" in the way that
words or beliefs are thought to have semantical or representational
properties. On Haugeland's account, cognitive explanations are explana-
tions via quasi-linguistic representations, or as Fodor (1975) puts it,
cognitivism is a theory of propositional attitudes requiring a representational
medium or "language" of thought.
Now if all that this fuller claim amounted to was that human beings have
beliefs, desires, plans, and expectations, that is, propositional attitudes, and
that ascription of propositional attitudes is easiest and clearest where lin-
guistic behavior can be brought in, the cognitivist's position would not be
very novel or that controversial. After all, appealing to propositional attitudes
to describe and explain human behavior predates computer technology by
centures, while drawing arrows between boxes labeled "storage," "sensory
input," and "speech control" adds little to such commonplace remarks as
that which we say is a function of what we see and remember. Furthermore,
although a correct analysis of propositional attitudes is not at hand, few
would deny the practical usefulness of talking about human activity in these
terms.
Where I think cognitivism becomes a more controversial thesis is in its own
analysis of intentional states and in its attempt to explain psychological
phenomena other than propositional attitudes in terms of informational states
and processes. Haugeland points out in the first section of his paper a few of
the difficulties involved in assigning representational status to internal states
and raises doubts about the scope of cognitive-type explanations in the
second. While I have qualms about aspects of Haugeland's claims, my pur-
pose in what follows is not to criticize Haugeland but to develop his points a
bit more (perhaps further than Haugeland himself would feel comfortable).
To take Haugeland's second point first, if cognitive explanations are
essentially explanations by means of intentional states and informational
processes, they will be limited to those phenomena that can be explained
within such a framework. But it is not obvious how much of what cognitivists
are tempted to theorize about falls within this domain. Haugeland indicates
some areas he feels may not be amenable to this sort of account: moods,
skills, and understanding. Now if Haugeland's intuitions are right, this would
be a damaging blow, since so many of the phenomena cognitivists hope to
explain can reasonably be considered skills (e.g., pattern recognition, chess
mastery, perhaps even language competence). Yet Haugeland's skepticism
is not without foundations, for on the face of it, the assumption that skills or
their acquisition are in general reducible to quasi-linguistic representational
states is highly problematic.
While Ryle (1949) has taken a beating over the years for his atheoretical
approach to explanation, the main thrust of his challenge to what he called
"the intellectualist legend" still has its merit. For a wide range of skills, at-
tempting to explain "knowing how" (i.e., a skill) or the acquisition of know-
how in terms of "knowing that" (i.e., informational states) seems a nonstarter.
The point has been made over and over again that knowing the principles of
balance or being able to write out a grammar for L is neither necessary nor
sufficient to confer upon the possessor bicycle-riding or language
competence. Nor does the logic of the situation change if the knowledge is
not conscious but is instead a description in some quasi-linguistic brain lan-
guage. If conscious "knowing that" is not enough to account for skills, uncon-
scious "knowing that" would not seem to be on any better ground. Possess-
ing a skill is just not the same sort of thing as possessing information
describing skill performances. What is missing, of course, is an account of
how one applies the information or puts it to use. Nor is it clear in many cases
what is gained in the way of explanation by postulating these internal in-
formational states. Consider, for example, pattern recognition skill. We want
to understand how a person is able to apply a label or respond differentially
to all triangles or letter A's. Now to be told that the person has an internal
label or quasi-linguistic representation of these concepts still leaves open
the question of how the person learns and is able to apply these internal
representations. So the original problem looms again, only this time it is skill
with internal representations that is at issue.
Now the cognitivist's position may be read not as claiming that skills are
reducible to "knowing that," but rather that several of the processes from

Commentary/Haugeland: 
The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
input to output can be described in informational terms. Thus even a clearly
physical skill such as bicycle-riding can be described in intentional lan-
guage (e.g., balance sensors "determine" the degree of tilt, and, "employing
a rule" of balance, send "messages" to the appropriate muscles to com-
pensate). And what is to prevent us from describing other skills and skill-
acquisition similarly? Perhaps nothing. But then nothing can prevent us from
describing the knee jerk reflex in this manner, too (e.g., the sensor in the joint
"determines" whether the pressure is greater than n and, when it does, sends
a "message" to the effector network to move the leg). And after all, the
electric eye dollar-changer might also be described in propositional attitude
idiom. If there is a problem with these descriptions, it is not so much that they
are false but that they are somewhat misleading. They make it seem as
though the knee joint and dollar-changer have internal states that are
seriously like the states we are in when we have beliefs or take propositional
attitudes towards some condition. When we claim a person represents
something as P or believes that P, we assume the person must understand
the label or proposition P. On the other hand, it does not seem reasonable to
claim that these mechanisms understand what it means for a pressure to be
greater than n or for something to be a dollar.
It is at this point, too, that one can perhaps question the force or
significance of the essential cognitivist claim that psychological explana-
tions are in terms of intentional states. That intentional idioms can be used in
some descriptions of skills and mental processes need not be denied. What
seems less clear is that all the internal states typically invoked have
reference content or "meaning" and can be said to be understood in the
same way that persons are said to understand words and use them to formu-
late beliefs.
While this is no place to launch an analysis of intentionality or understand-
ing, I think Haugeland's demand that input-output relations "make sense"
may be took weak. As he himself recognizes, almost anything, even a flipped
coin, can be interpreted in a way that makes sense to us. Haugeland says
such cases can be ignored, and I agree. They seem to lack the complexity,
the means-ends adjustment, the features of adaptation and learning, of being
subject to reason and evidence that we see as part and parcel of our more
usual attributions of intentionality and understanding. To give substance to
the claim that internal states are intentional, it must be reasonable to see
these states as having sense and making sense to the organism or
mechanism using them, not just to us. The fact that a cell complex fires
whenever condition $ occurs is not to claim that the complex understands <Â£.
Nor is the situation substantially changed if the complex not only fires but
produces something else that because of the correlation, we are tempted to
call a <f> label or representation. For the 4> label will not be very intentional un-
less it is itself understood. Furthermore, as these internal states become
more removed from correlation with external stimuli, it becomes increasingly
difficult to see them as understood representations having reference and
other semantical properties on par with our more ordinary symbols.
Understanding is not an all-or-none process or the grasping of some fixed
idea. Understanding, to borrow a phrase from Harman, involves mastery of
an "evidence-inference-action game" and is itself very much a skill-like af-
fair. Now to the extent the use, function, and acquisition of our internal quasi-
linguistic representations do not share these features, the claim that these
representations are understood seems problematic. In turn, the claim that our
internal states and processes are truly intentional rests on the analogy
between these states and our more usual propositional attitudes. At the point
where the analogy breaks down, we can begin to question what remains
significantly distinctive to cogntivist explanations.

On Cognitivism's 
explanations 
and limitations. 
Haugeland's task is
twofold: (1) to provide an explication of cognitive theory and research, and
(2) to appraise (largely negatively) the cognitivist research program. Al-
though most of Haugeland's exposition of cognitivism appears correct, some
of his more critical attempts are problematic, particularly the alleged
"potentially serious hurdles" to cognitivism. Before turning to these, a few
emendations and criticisms of Haugeland's treatment of reductionism are in
order.
While agreeing with Haugeland that "the ills of psychology are [some-
times] laid to a misguided effort to emulate physics and chemistry," the im-
portance of physics and chemistry to cognitive psychology should not be
underplayed. Making these connections helps undermine the frustration
often associated with the black-box nature of theorizing in cognitive
psychology. How, for example, does one choose between two radically di-
vergent interpretations of the component Intentional Black Boxes (IBBs)?The
physical sciences can provide a strong candidate standard in terms of which
that choice can justifiably be made.
Accordingly, Haugeland's three explanatory maneuvers can be ranked in
terms of their explanatory power. Explaining an IBB as an Information
Processing System (IPS) occupies the lowest rung, for such an account is
limited to the particular kind of task in question. Next is explaining an IBB by
intentional instantiation, which is the level of explanation claimed for the
General Problem Solver computer simulation. These two levels, however,
exemplify what Cummins (1977, p. 272) calls the Analytical Strategy of
analyzing a disposition into a number of relatively less problematic disposi-
tions such that organized manifestations of these analyzing dispositions
amount to a manifestation of the analyzed disposition. Moreover, subsuming
dispositional regularity under a physical law (the Subsumption Strategy in
the Cummins's terminology and explanation by physical instantiation in
Haugeland's) provides the third level of explanation and constitutes an im-
portant, if not critical, constraint on the first two levels (the Analytical
Strategies). Here, it is worthwhile to quote Cummins (p. 273) in full:
"A natural assumption - and a correct one I think - is that the Analytical
Strategy must eventually terminate in dispositions which yield the Subsump-
tion Strategy. For without this assumption, the apparent explanatory progress
afforded by the Analytical Strategy is mere appearance. That strategy makes
progress only insofar as the analyzing capacities are relatively less prob-
lematic as compared to the capacity analyzed. We undermine such progress
if we suppose that our analyzing capacities might ultimately prove resistant
to the Subsumption Strategy, for to suppose this is to allow that the ca-
pacities may be utterly mysterious and inexplicable from the point of view of
physical science: we shall be barred from any account of why some things,
and not others obey the associated law. One needn't endorse any starry-eyed
claims about the unity of science to find this prospect unwelcome."
So, contrary to Haugeland, cognitivists should be interested in psy-
chophysical bridge laws and very worried if none are possible.
Turning from Haugeland's exposition to his critique, he proposes three
"potentially serious hurdles" to a cognitive research program: moods, skills,
and understanding. Wisely avoiding the pitfalls of impossibility arguments
("your research cannot, in principle, accomplish x"), Haugeland shows the
implausibility of these three phenomena being given a cognitive treatment.
Yet, even though an account of each will undoubtedly prove difficult and
complicated, contrary to Haugeland, no prima facie reasons exist for doubt-
ing the applicability of the cognitivist approach to them.
Haugeland's case against the cognitive account of moods can only be
made by assuming that moods "don't seem at all cognitive themselves." Yet,
there is just as much prima facie evidence to believe that a mood is not an
integral quality but is rather a complex interplay of feelings, beliefs, evalua-
tions, and the like. While admittedly "moods permeate and affect all kinds of
cognitive states and processes," what is being affective in that case may
well include some other cognitive state and process in addition to some felt
qualities. In other words, my mood affecting my present thinking may be tan-
tamount to some general belief that I have about the world (for example,
extreme pessimism) affecting my current thinking. There do not seem to be
any prima facie reasons for accepting Haugeland's account over this one.
Moreover, the extent Haugeland allows for segregating felt qualities from the
cognitivist's concerns is the extent to which they can be segregated as fac-
tors of moods.
Skills present a somewhat different problem in that many skills, particu-
larly motor skills, do not seem analyzable into discrete mental (or informa-
tion) processes. Yet, this may only indicate a different kind of information
processing, as, for example, pattern recognition, taking place while one is

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
acquiring a skill. As Simon notes (1976, p. 80), these different types of in-
formation processing account for some of the different abilities of, for
example, duffer and master chess players:". . . the short-term memory of the
chess master has the same capacity, measured in chunks, as the short-term
memory of the duffer, but [the] duffer's chunks consist of individual pieces
while the master's chunks consist of configurations of pieces." Hence, in ap-
plying this to Haugeland's example, the duffer's and master's "consciously
considering on the order of a hundred plays in thinking out a move" may
simply be different ways of processing the information, and the master's
ways are as amenable to a cognitive account as the duffer's.
Finally, "understanding" is highly ambiguous in that it can be contrasted
with ignorance, mere knowing, and misunderstanding (Scriven, 1972, p. 32);
Haugeland's sense of understanding as insight is no exception. Insight
could consist in "believing or feeling that one understands" (Scriven, 1972,
p. 32), in the ability to specify why something makes sense, or in developing
a novel concept. None of these is beyond the purview of cognitivism. While
Haugeland wants to deny that "insight is itself some 'transcendental' or im-
penetrable mystery, which we are forever barred from explaining," he still
wants to "admit that the phenomenon of insight is simply mysterious and
unexplainable at present." Some of the mystery surrounding the concept
insight is dispelled by providing an analysis, and an analysis would spell out
just those antecedent conditions thought by Haugeland to be implausible.
Admitting that all new developments would have to be products of an-
tecedent general conditions does not "preclude any radically new ways of
understanding things." On the contrary, it helps us understand creative
insights. Even Galileo's derivational-nomological explanation had important
precursors (Shapere, 1974).
The enigmatic phenomena cited by Haugeland are just a sample of those
that people have proposed as obstacles to cognitivism. Some general com-
ments, negative and positive, can be made about this strategy. First of all,
the strategy assumes more than it seems capable of delivering, for some-
thing fairly definitive must be known about the obstacle phenomenon that
makes it incompatible with the cognitive research program. For example,
claiming that insight presents a serious hurdle to simulation presupposes a
fairly well-worked out analysis of the constituents of insight. After all, we want
to know what it is about insight that creates the problem. Here a dilemma
arises. For once that analysis is given, then the phenomenon, in being more
manageable and less mysterious, seems more amenable to a cognitive treat-
ment. Nevertheless, Haugeland's warning that the simulation approach may
well be, like behaviorism, overstepping its fruitful bounds of inquiry is well
worth noting. Yet, in many cases these limitations are uncovered only by
overstepping them.
Although I have been mostly critical of Haugeland's paper, that should not
detract from the many fruitful insights he has provided, particularly those on
explanation and intentions.

Indivisible performances, implicit grasp, and the problem of meaningful-
ness. John Haugeland's excellent article has done a great deal to clarify the
issue about cognitivism. In particular, his distinction within reductive expla-
nations of different kinds of "instantiation," as he calls it, makes the process
involved much clearer.
I agree very much with Haugeland that "the eventual fate of cognitive
psychology will be settled empirically"; and I share with him some doubts
about whether it will in the end pan out. I would like to expand a little on
these. My remarks here touch on an issue that is latent in each of the three
areas where Haugeland sees "potentially serious hurdles" for cognitivism in
his section 7.
The great strength of cognitivism over behaviorism, as Haugeland points
out, is that it promises to give acceptable scientific accounts of our rational
behavior qua rational behavior. An important phase of the explanation in-
volves breaking down our rational performances into the component steps
that make them up (or, it is believed, must make them up); for instance, the
steps of calculation that enable us to arrive at a correct answer. The whole
performance can be explained by a series of part-performances. And there is
the additional payoff, from the standpoint of scientific reductionism, that
these part-performances can eventually be matched by machines, thus
promising what Haugeland calls a physical instantiation.
A central difficulty for the cognitivist program that seems to be emerging
more and more clearly is the existence of performances that cannot be so
broken down. An example is the chess player's preselection of certain possi-
ble moves as the ones worth working out in all their consequences. It seems
implausible to hold that this results from an unconscious step-by-step cal-
culation of the chances of a much wider range of moves, or a step-by-step
application of some heuristic procedure.
But nor can such immediate judgments or unconscious selections be just
seen as a species of immediate experience, like our seeing red, or feeling
cold. For they are cognitive performances and have their own kind of ra-
tionality. Indeed, they are related to the step-by-step particulate observations
that do not seem to explain them; and that (sometimes) in two ways. First, we
may build up over time an ability to grasp at a glance that this area is one of
weakness for our opponent and therefore worth considering. But, typically,
we start off in a more painful step-by-step way. We learn by particular
experiences - our queen is pinned in one game, queen and king are forked
in another-to see a certain configuration as one of weakness, even though
this weakness-judgement cannot be exhaustively specified in any such list of
particular disasters. The step from particular discovery to general grasp is
the same we observe with many skills, as Haugeland points out, where the
stage of learning may require a lot of concentration on particular movements,
which concentration is not only unnecessary but impossible when we have
mastered the skill.
Secondly, our grasp of the board is related to particulate judgments also in
that we can make it yield some. If asked why this position looks weak, we can
give a number of possible concrete dangers that could arise. And the chess
player does something like this when he begins to zero in and consider
particular moves. And yet, while related in both these ways to particular
judgments about the consequences of particular moves, the chess player's
grasp of the board does not seem to be rationalized by them, in the sense
that the successful performance of this general grasp of the position results
from a series of part-performances that are particular judgments.
In other words, we may have to allow for a particular kind of human perfor-
mance, which is the achieving of an implicit grasp of a domain. To have such
a grasp is to know something of the kind of explicitly statable fact that is true
of the domain, but not necessarily to have (even unconsciously) registered
any such facts. To put it another way, there is a relation of justification
between any claim to an implicit grasp and explicit factual judgments-for
instance, my claim to grasp areas of strength and weakness on the board is
considerably less credible than that of a master, just because my hunches so
often turn out badly when I actually work through the detailed moves. But this
relation of justification is not matched by an explanatory one- I do not have
the grasp because I have made the explicit judgments.
The implicit grasp seems to play an important role in human life: think of all
the things we are always taking in and responding to about the feelings of our
interlocutor, the mood of a conversation, the beauty of a landscape and a
work of art, where any attempt to be explicit seems an attempt to unpack very
partially our implicit understanding, rather than to provide the grounds that
determined the judgment. If such performances turn out to be something like
what they look or feel to us-and the pattern of failures of Artificial In-
telligence and Computer Simulation make this more plausible-then they
will not be amenable to the mode of explanation hitherto dominant in cogni-
tive psychology. The issue is not mainly one of atomism versus holism. It is
not because these performances have a gestalt property, and are undivided
wholes, that they pose a difficulty. The problem is rather that they seem to
have their own kind of rationality. They are related to particulate judgments,
that is just the trouble, only not in the canonically prescribed way.
If these performances do turn out to be unamenable to the cognitivist ap-
proach, then this will also involve our going beyond the account of meaning-
fulness that Haugeland gives in section 3. This in two ways. First, the clear

Commentary/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
singling out of a range of tokens that can then be assigned to a number of
types may in the end fit only the linguistic cases, or at least the cases where
we have some notation. But when we are, for instance, grasping someone's
mood, or his feeling toward us, in his speech and manner, we find it very
difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the performance in two stages: the
selection of the cues, on one hand, and the interpretation given them, on the
other. And this may correspond to a basic and not just surface feature of this
kind of performance.
The second possible modification concerns what it means to make sense
of a given domain through an interpretation. Haugeland talks of making
reasonable sense of outputs in the context of prior inputs and outputs, and
sees the capacity to do this as the test of an interpretation. The example here
is a chess game. By interpreting "P-K4; P-K4; QKt-B3 ..." as a series of
chess moves, we can see how all these make the kind of sense that a chess
game makes. The difficulty arises around the kind of sense that will be
recognized as such by cognitivist psychologists. They can certainly recog-
nize various overall patterns as making sense, that is, satisfying specified
cogency conditions, and this can be the meaning they give to "meaningful-
ness," provided the elements forming the pattern are not themselves defined
in terms of intentionality or meaningfulness. Thus the moves of a game of
chess form a pattern, defined quite independently of what it is like to
experience or be aware of a given event as a chess move. Indeed, when ma-
chines play chess we do not usually imagine that anyone is experiencing or
being aware of the moves. Similarly, the theories of meaning developed out
of the work of Quine and, latterly, Davidson, are grounded in the coherence
we can see in a set of utterances in a given context, where the coherence is
understood as holding between the truth-conditions of the utterances and the
facts that obtain. Once again, this is a pattern we can discern in things that
are defined quite independently of what it is to understand, or be aware of,
the meaning of an utterance. The Quine-Davidson type theory of meaning is
very much one that might be developed by an outside observer who never
entered into communication with the beings whose language he is trying to
map.
It is doubtful whether this notion of meaningfulness could cope with inter-
changes founded on the kind of performance I called an implicit grasp, for
instance a conversation where I somehow take in and sustain the tone my
interlocutor has set. For perhaps the tone itself can be defined only in terms
that refer to meaningfulness. This latter could then no longer be defined in
terms of a certain cogency without circularity. This is not meant, of course, as
a criticism of Haugeland's careful and illuminating discussion in section 3.
On the contrary, he presents there very well the kind of notion of meaningful-
ness that cognitivism requires. My doubts concern whether this notion is ulti-
mately defensible; and for all I know, Haugeland may share these doubts.
The question of principle raised here is whether we can have an adequate
theory of meaning that does not give an account of what it is to understand an
expression, or be aware of something as meaningful. This issue has already
been raised against Davidson's theory of linguistic meaning, for instance by
Dummett (1975). There may be another key issue here that cognitive
psychology wi 11 have to face.

Is making reasonable sense reasonable? It should be said at the outset that
Haugeland's fine analysis of cognitivism does not encompass all varieties of
what is ordinarily called "cognitive psychology." That is no criticism, but it is
important to see the limits of application of his view. Thus, a good part of
contemporary research is aimed at what Haugeland calls Deductive-
Nomological Explanation. Consider, for example, chronometric experi-
mentation on mental processes, a tradition that Blumenthal (1977) had
characterized as deriving from Wundt. Further, Haugeland's approach takes
no account of those explanations based on developmental processes.
Piaget's (1970; see also Brainerd, this issue), in particular, does not fit com-
fortably with any of Haugeland's three types of explanation, since none are
time-dependent. This having been said, it is important to see that his
analysis does relate, in an interesting fashion, to all those attempts made in
recent years to provide systematic explanations of cognitive phenomena. It
thus covers simulation-dependent approaches like Simon's (1969 op. cit.),
semantic-based models of memory like Norman and Rumelhart's (1975), and
much else in addition.
Haugeland attempts to characterize such cognitive psychology in a way
that is "unimpeachably rigorous and empirical all the same." The heart of his
argument is the use of intentional interpretation as an explicit formalism per-
mitting the incorporation of meaningfulness in cognitive models. Put briefly,
if an intentional interpretation of an ordered behavioral system is possible,
and if the interpretation "makes reasonable sense," then we can use the
interpretation as part of a systematic explanation. Are such interpretations
testable? If they are, that is, if they lead to potentially falsifiable claims that
can be checked, then cognitivism will, indeed, rest on an empirical footing.
Yet, how can we accept "making reasonable sense" as a criterion? Hauge-
land feels that this presents no difficulties: "By and large everyone can agree
on what does and doesn't make sense."
This is, however, simply not so. To see the problem, consider the human
propensity for detecting meaning and pattern where none exists. This is a
propensity that forms the basis of all projective tests. It is, in fact, extra-
ordinarily difficult not to see a pattern. If you doubt this, try looking at a tiled
floor without grouping separate tiles into small groups, or try seeing a
Rorschach card as "just an ink blot." These elementary phenomena are part
of a broader tendency, one that means we will always be able to come up
with an interpretation that "makes reasonable sense." Further, social
agreement on which interpretations make the most sense is no help at all.
Consider the Necker cube. By Haugeland's criterion, it is truly a three-
dimensional object, since most people see it that way.
A similar problem has confronted psychology before. In 1889, Binet wrote
that all animals, even one-celled protozoa, possessed psyches. Since such
creatures show intentionality in pursuit of food, in sexual interaction, and in
avoiding noxious stimuli, it "made reasonable sense" to Binet to attribute the
same psychological structures to protozoa that are found in man. Was Binet
wrong? We would now say yes, but not because his notion of mind was test-
able (it was not) and not because it did not make reasonable sense (it did). It
failed, instead, on grounds of parsimony. There is an alternative approach -
Morgan's (1891) in particular-which offered a better way to understand
protozoa. Even if we disagree that Morgan's Canon applies to human
thought, the notion of parsimony continues to compel assent. If, as Hauge-
land says, a nonintentional model of mind can be developed, it will create
grave problems for cognitivism, and for exactly the same reason.
The problem with cognitivism is not that patterns of behavior do not exist.
The existence of chess games and of, say, de Groot's (1965op. cit.) finding
of memory differences between master players and amateurs is sufficient
evidence to refute elementist approaches to cognitive phenomena. There are
patterns, and the patterns do call for explanations. What I am arguing is that
intentional explanations of the sort developed by Haugeland have not been
shown to be testable in the way he has argued. Intentionality does, indeed,
"make reasonable sense," but we cannot admit that as our touchstone for
testability. Descartes' "Evil Genius" lives within us and will fool us every time
if we try.
Haugeland has not, of course, simply presented a defense of cognitivism.
The most valuable part of his presentation concerns three potential empirical
hurdles that cognitivism must overcome: moods, skills, and understanding.
In calling these the "tips of some of the icebergs on which (cognitivism may)
founder," Haugeland may be alluding to the common problematic charac-
teristic of all three problems, namely consciousness. We still lack any real
sense of the role that consciousness should play in thinking. None of our
models, least of all computer simulations, provides a functional role for con-
sciousness. It is this gap in our approach to cognitive phenomena that pro-
vided a beginning point for Jaynes's (1977) startling book on consciousness
as something to be explained. But how? Deductive-Nomological Explana-
tions? Systematic Explanations? Or Jaynes's unique Phylogenetic Explana-
tion? Haugeland has helped us see that sooner or later the problem will need
to be directly addressed by cognitive psychology. We may never be able to
say what consciousness is, anymore than biologists have been able to say
what life is. But we should be asking, more often that we do, what attributes
consciousness possesses and what relationships it enters into. Perhaps then
we will be able to look forward to not our Newton, but to our Watson and
Crick.

Some problems of intentionality. Haugeland's paper will be welcomed by
seasoned as well as incipient cognitivists as an eminently helpful and stimu-
lating contribution. If it should not convert staunch followers of the be-
haviorist gospel to the view that "the Cognitive approach to psychology of-
fers . . . a science of a distinctive form," it will probably not be Haugeland's
fault. His lucid exposition of the three types of explanation cuts through much
of the fog that has been created by enthusiastic but often inaccurate promul-
gation of cybernetics, systems theory, and structuralism - all of which imply
the discrimination between "morphological" and "systematic" coordination.
Haugeland should also be congratulated on his unequivocal statement of the
fact that explanatory reductions do not "supplant the explanations they
reduce" and on his courageous frontal approach to the problem of intention.
Using chess as an example in his analysis of how one may come to in-
terpret a black box as intentional is a good didactic simplification. I would
suggest, however, that the very element whose exclusion makes that
example simpler than other, less conventional activities might lead us to take
a somewhat less positivistic stance than does the author in his later evalua-
tion of Cognitivist theory.
Condition (iii) for interpreting an object as an IBB is that the object's
outputs "consistently make reasonable sense." Haugeland is aware of the
problems this expression raises, but he says that "it is seldom hard to recog-
nize in practice" how "reasonable sense" should be defined. I think we have
to be more explicit about this. In the context of several games of chess it will,
as a rule, be easy to decide whether or not a presumed player's moves, on
the whole, make sense. There will even be occasions when this can be de-
cided about a single move. This is so because within the context of chess we
know a priori what a player's goal has to be, and there will be no doubt what-
soever about recognizing it when it is achieved. It is, indeed, a matter of ac-
cepted rules, and a person or box that has no conception or a deviant con-
ception of what constitutes "mate" will not be considered a chess player at
all. However, when we come to consider other activities that are not so ob-
viously governed by a set of explicit conventional rules, the situation is much
more obscure because we have no a priori knowledge of the observed sub-
ject's goals in terms of which his or her actions could be judged to make
sense and, hence, to be intentional.
Jurists, who are frequently faced with the problem of deciding whether or
not a person's action was intentional, have created the rather powerful
maxim: A person will be presumed to intend the natural, probable conse-
quences of his acts.. This works well enough in court, because there it is
tacitly assumed that people have much the same ideas (knowledge) as to
what are natural, probable consequences of the acts under consideration.
But if, as philosophers or scientists we are faced with a black box, a wild-
living chimpanzee, or a person from a significantly different cultural back-
ground, we are in no way justified in making that tacit assumption, because
we simply do not know what they believe to be natural, probable conse-
quences of acts. Therefore, as long as we remain passive observers, we can-
not be sure whether or not their acts are intentional (cf. von Glasersfeld &
Silverman, 1976).
Fortunately, as Hofstadter (1941) has suggested, there are ways and
means for an observer to test hypotheses about an observed organism's
intentions or goals, by creating obstacles or, more generally, disturbances
for the organism (cf. Powers, 1973, for tentative implementations). Epistemo-
logically, such tests are equivalent to any other hypothesis tests, in that they
may tell us whether or not our hypothesis remain a viable explanation for our
observations, but not whether this explanation is "true" or "false" in any
absolute ontological sense.
There is yet another epistemological aspect to be considered. The inten-
tions that an observer attributes to an observed organism are necessarily de-
termined in a limiting sense by the set of goals that are conceivable to the
observer as well as by his beliefs concerning rules, methods, and activities
that are likely to lead to the attachment of these goals. This observer-
dependent "conjectural" character of explanations, however, can hardly be
said to be unique or discrediting to the Cognitivist approach to "systematic
explanation." It seems to be the character of all scientific explanation.
Another fairly important issue is involved in the hypothetical example of
the brain hologram. The proposed "fixed" association between an "important
substructure in chess positions" and "powerful or dangerous" moves would
have to be considered either innate or acquired. If we decided that it was in-
nate, we would have to discard any intentional explanation because, as long
as we believe the theory of evolution, we would be obliged to say that the
association was the result of accidental variation and unintentional selection.
If it was acquired, however, it would have to have been "holographed" into
that brain at some prior time by someone's goal-directed, intentional selec-
tion. If the brain now shows no evidence of making new selective associa-
tions of that kind, it would be classified as an IBB whose goals have been set
by some IPS that decided which positions were to be associated with which
moves. If, on the other hand, the brain were still making new selective
associations, the information-processing and decision-making capability
would have to reside within it (at least if we exclude hypnosis or telepathy)
and, qua whole brain, it would be classified as IPS. This distinction, I hasten
to add, is obviously based on the distinction Pask (1969, p. 23) made
between "purpose of" and "purpose for."
That point is relevant also to the problem Haugeland raises with regard to
skills. I can see no reason why an IPS of a certain level of complexity should
not have the capability of "deliberately and thoughtfully" building up, say, a
sequence of motor acts under appropriate perceptual feedback control fora
given recurrent purpose, and then "automating" the whole arrangement by
giving it direct access to the sensory signals that were originally used for the
control of the activity in the central processor. Since we can build a ther-
mostat that perfectly realizes the purpose of maintaining, without conscious-
ness on its or on our part, the room temperature we set (purpose for), there
seems to be no logical obstacle to our automating (after deliberate compila-
tion) the general motor pattern for hitting a ping-pong ball in such a way that
only those parameters that determine where the ball with go remain under
our conscious control. People who have to learn to double-declutch when
shifting gears (e.g., in competitive sports car racing) seem to do exactly that.
The movements of foot on clutch and hand on gear lever come relatively
quickly under autonomous control; gauging the intermediary jab on the gas
pedal according to perceptual signals indicating engine rotation and actual
speed of the car, however, takes very much longer to become "automatic"
and probably never does so entirely. The salient feature in all this is that,
experientially, we are all aware of the fact that there are many quite compli-
cated motor activities whose control, after a period of more or less conscious
supervision, can be relegated to an unconscious level. The application of
control theory to these cases seems promising because it supplies a con-
ceptual model for the strange observation that, while the execution of the
motor sequence seems wholly unconscious, their direction (i.e., the setting
of particular goals of reference values that determine each individual execu-
tion) remains under conscious control.
It is to be hoped that Haugeland's paper, because it supplies a number of
very clear methodological definitions and draws attention to problems that
psychologists, by and large, would rather avoid, will not only be discussed
but also acted upon. There are, I believe, good reasons to predict that both
empirical and theoretical investigation of the "hurdles" he mentions will
show the Cognitivist's systemic approach rather more powerful and fertile
than this conservative evaluation might lead one to expect.

its treatment of "meaning"? Second, precisely what difference does the truth
or falsity of the theory that human beings can be viewed as extremely com-
plex IPSs make to the question of explanation in psychology?

Cognitivism's contributions: 
some questions. The most clearly focused
sections of Haugeland's paper provide a potentially valuable account of the
disunity of science. His main thesis is that "cognitivism," understood as the
view that intelligent behavior can be explained in terms of "internal cognitive
processes," has suggested an entirely novel approach to the question of
explanation in psychology. ("Intelligent behavior" has here to be construed
broadly enough to include such different activities as understanding lan-
guage, playing games of strategy, and visually recognizing objects.) If I have
understood it correctly, his view is that cognitivism has liberated us from the
paralyzing assumption that explanation in psychology must be "derivational-
nomological." Instead of looking for laws and axioms governing behavior, we
are entitled to look for explanations of "how things work," given in terms of
the interaction of discrete functional components, that is, for "systematic"
explanations.
My first problem is a direct result of the author's ambivalent assessment of
the value of computer-simulation studies. On one hand, he gives an interest-
ing argument to the effect that what is involved in being in a certain mood, or
having a certain skill, or acquiring insight into a problem cannot be
explained as a feature of an information-processing system. This in turn
casts doubt on the assumption that even routine problem solving can be
explained as the activity of an IPS, as long as moods, skills, and insight can
be expected to affect directly the ability to solve routine problems. It would
be tempting to conclude that such simulation studies lack theoretical value
for psychology, and it is surprising to find the author maintaining just the op-
posite, in particular that such studies have greatly contributed to our under-
standing of the problematic notions of "meaning" and "significance." It is
difficult to tell from the exposition how the improved notion of meaning differs
from the behaviorist notion of "stimulus-meaning." while remaining powerful
and empirical. Perhaps the ability of an IPS (or even an IBB) to produce novel
but interpretable outputs in response to novel inputs has an explanatory role
to play here, but it would be helpful to have some fairly informal clarification.
My other difficulty concerns the possibility of what might be called
"cognitivism without automativism." Here I am troubled by the possibility of
arguing in the following way: "If human behavior could be explained as the
behavior of an IPS, then 'systematic' explanation in psychology would be
possible . . . But there is little reason to suppose that most intelligent or even
goal-directed behavior does involve the representation of problems as
branching tree-structures, and the performance of subsequent surveying and
matching operations . . . Therefore, there is no reason at all to suppose that
explanation in psychology can be systematic. What science is possible may
turn out to be unified after all."
No matter how easy it is to refute such an argument, it requires refutation
because it has been energetically maintained by philosophers, for example,
Ryle, that systematic explanations of rational behavior are impossible. The
fact that many people find Ryle's arguments somewhat weak in this connec-
tion is entirely beside the point. If the position is false, it must be false be-
cause psychology has already succeeded in showing that such apparently
simple concepts as "perceiving," "understanding a sentence," and "decid-
ing on a move" can be understood as processes that involve the cooperative
interaction of a number of separate subprocesses. If there is any reason to
suppose that explanation in psychology is distinctive in the way Haugeland
suggests, examples should be ready to hand. It is extremely difficult to
evaluate the suggestion that holographic models might provide explanations
of the right kind without knowing howthe model is supposed to be realized in
the actual structures of the brain. In particular, it is hard to know whether the
form of explanation involved will be "systematic," "morphological," or
something else altogether.
To sum up, then, my main questions are two. Haugeland makes it clear
that, as far as he is concerned, recent studies in artificial intelligence have
more than a purely practical value; they do not simply give us a reliable
means of testing, say, the adequacy of grammars: What exactly, then, are the
virtues of cognitivism, which make it, in spite of its implausibility, subject to
neither the sterilities of behaviorism nor the vacuities of introspectionism in

The two modes of identifying 
objects: descriptive and holistic 
for
concrete objects; recursive and ostensive for abstract objects. In the sec-
tion in which Haugeland proposes a hologram-like process as a possible al-
ternative to the I.P.S. model of cognitive behaviour, he writes as follows:". . .
there is nothing going on which can be regarded a 'working out a rationale
with quasi-linguistic representations.' By contrast a typical computer based
pattern recognizer is an I.P.S. Thus searching for discontinuities in lumi-
nance gradients, proposing that they are edges, checking for connexity and
so on [i.e. procedures usually called feature extraction, -my addition] are all
rational procedures relating to the problem of identifying objects."
In Section 7, he states: "First, with rare exceptions, articulateness about a
skill, no matter how detailed nor in what specialized quasi-linguistic nota-
tion, is neither necessary nor sufficient for having it; it always takes practice
and often expert examples and talent (j= intelligence)."
The author here points out a distinction between two modes of understand-
ing our environment: the first identifies objects by quasi-linguistic
representations; the other apprehends objects by means of nonarticulate
skills. This dichotomy; which is undoubtedly related to the complexity of the
concrete objects to be recognized or manipulated, was projected as follows
by von Neumann (1966, pp. 51-54): "certain objects are such that their
description is more complex than the object itself."
We can explicate this proposition on a theoretical level in the domain of
optical patterns. (See Yevick, 1975op. cit.). Such patterns or objects are thin,
white regions on a black background. These can be simple (regular), like the
outlines of rectangles; or complex, like the outlines of Chinese characters or
random-like motions. The following holds true: a complex object requires a
long (sequential, quasi-linguistic) description but yields a sharp recognition
(auto-correlation) spot under holographic filtering; hence it is identified most
readily by holographic recognition, or holistically. A simple object requires a
short (quasi-linguistic) description but yields a diffuse recognition spot;
hence it is identified most readily by quasi-linguistic representation or
description.
Description and holographic recognition thus appear as two (comple-
mentary) modes of identifying an object: the more complex the object, the
longer its description and the sharper its auto-correlation spot, and vice
versa. The more complex they physiognomy of a person, the more unique,
and hence sharper, its identity and ease of recall; the more simple, the more
common and hence "unidentifiable." Perfect holographic recognition ob-
tains for a totally "random object", that is, one with an infinitely long descrip-
tion; for a perfectly sharp point the opposite is true.
Suppose that one is given a store of objects with which one is familiar, a
holographic recognition device, and a quasi-linguistic mode of representa-
tion; one is then presented with an arbitrary object to be "identified." An ap-
proximate match is obtained either by producing a description of acceptable
length or by holographic recognition of a subset of similar (associated) ob-
jects from the store. The mode of identification that will be more appropriate
then depends on the complexity of the unknown object. If it is simple, we
"know" it by a short linguistic description; if it is complex, by the "associa-
tions" it evokes.
If we consider that both of these modes of identification enter into our
mental processes, we might speculate that there is a constant movement (a
shifting across boundaries) from one mode to the other: the compacting into
one unit of the description of a scene, event, and so forth that has become fa-
miliar to us, and the analysis of such into its parts by description. Mastery,
skill and holistic grasp of some aspect of the world are attained when this ob-
ject becomes identifiable as one whole complex unit; new rational
knowledge is derived when the arbitrary complex object apprehended is
analytically described.
This dichotomy is also relevant in the purely formal domain where we deal
with so-called abstract objects. We note that Haugeland introduces the no-
tion of "dimension" and discusses the "disconnected" nature of two ortho-
gonal dimensions. He then applies this insight to indicate the incom-

parability of the mind of a mathematician and the Turing-Machine, and
relates this to Godel's proof that any formal system rich enough to include
arithmetic can express truths not provable in the system.
A careful scrutiny of the various presentations leading to Godel's result
reveals that the "abstract objects" that are the entities under discussion in a
formal system actually occur in two modes: as objects identified by bold-
faced pictures or shapes or marks on paper, and as objects generated recur-
sively from certain zero-entities, recognized in some way by their rank, that
is, the first of a certain list (Quine, 1950); an expression of length one
(Shoenfield, 1967); a sequence of one symbol (Godel, Pred. 15 in van
Heijenoort, 1970; Mendelson, 1964); entities generated by a successor
operation on a pair of arguments (Kleene, 1970, pp. 247, 251-252; Pred. Dn
1 should readry s"0). We recognize abstract objects of the first kind byosten-
sion (holistically); those of the second kind are recognized by sequential
generation or description. But whereas in the case of concrete objects dis-
cussed above, it is possible to assert that these two modes of (approximate)
identification refer to the same object, the abstract objects have no identity
recognizable beyond their formal mode of representation or generation.
Thus, going beyond Haugeland's remark and using the word "mode" for his
"dimension," we note that the mixing of modes is already present in the argu-
ment that yields Godel's undecidability result: it rests essentially on the
identification of abstract objects ("formal numerals") recognized in two dis-
connected modes. The well-known confusion between Mention and Use
reappears here as a confusion between showing and telling or display and
enumeration, that is, as a mixing of dimensions.
The following quotation from Freudenthal (1960), who attempted to
construct a language, "Lincos," aimed at cosmic communication, clearly
projects the irreducible duality: "We have agreed to abstain as much as
possible from showing (concrete things or images of concrete things) but we
cannot entirely abstain from it. Our first message will show numerals as an in-
troduction to mathematics. Such an ostensive numeral, meaning the natural
number n, consists of n peeps with regular intervals; from the context the
reader will conclude that it aims aishowing just the natural number n."
For minds to communicate or to do formal mathematics, they must possess
both a quasi-linguistic (sequential, rational) and a holistic (ostensive,
associative) dimension.

Author's Response
by John Heligoland
The critical assessment of Cognitivism: a closer look
Like most of the commentators, I shall concentrate my remarks
on specific issues where I have detailed rejoinders, emenda-
tions, or concessions. But I do want first to express my genuine
thanks for the many generous and thoughtful observations made
by so many people; I hope this necessary brevity does not ob-
scure my sincerity. Since a number of questions were raised by
more than one author, and still others touch on similar problems
in interestingly related ways, I have chosen to organize my
replies by topic, rather than by commentary; for convenience,
these are arranged in roughly the order of the original paper. To
facilitate scanning for particular points, commentators are cited
in bold face type.
Section 1. Arbib objects to the distinction of explanatory styles
because they "can occur in virtually any combination." But his
example of a ball rolling on a surface depends on the characteri-
zation of the surface. A mathematical solution with the surface
defined only as H(x,y) would be derivational-nomological (D-N),
whereas an explanation of a path that cited only the walls of a tilt-
ing maze, or the grooves in a model drainage system, would be
morphological; and there could be intermediates. The analysis of
DNA "involves physics as much as ball-and-stick chemistry" be-
cause it involves not only an explanation of the replication ability
but also a reduction of that explanation - the latter is required to
show how the former is physically realized. More generally, just
because phenomena occur in combination is no grounds for fail-
ing to distinguish them.
Greeno maintains that the morphological/systematic distinc-
tion reflects only a difference in complexity. But I think the
"complicated additional analysis of how the components
interact" marks an (unsharp but) important difference in kind -
at least when the interactions are intricately organized. In a full
blown case, it is precisely the sophisticated orchestration of the
interactions that yields the explanatory insight. This element is
entirely lacking (not just less complex) in morphological explana-
tions of coffee cup or fiber optics abilities (and also in the reduc-
tive explanation of water boiling).
According to Harre, systematic explanations are those in
which the synchronic form of an item is cited in explaining the
diachronic form of its operations. This may be true, but it fails
again to mention the crucial organization of the (diachronic)
component interactions. Thus, the movement of a ball through a
maze is diachronic, but its "form" would be explained mor-
phologically. Harre also wants allies in his wholesale rejection
of logical empiricism, particularly in his view that the deductive-
nomological schema is "peculiar and degenerate." It still seems
to me, though, that Newtonian explanations of planetary orbits
are derivational- (hence deductive-) nomological and perfectly
respectable. Admittedly, however, this schema is "most fa-
miliar" only in certain traditions, and not across the board.
Econoraos proposes an alternative classification of explana-
tions: those that are heuristically convenient and intuitive,
versus those that give ontologically "true coin." Her claim that
the former are merely promissory notes, to be redeemed by the
latter, is a metaphysical thesis about reduction. But she and I
agree that my distinctions do not address that issue and can all be
thought of as heuristic in her sense.
Finally, Baroe, Domotor and Otto argue that the explanation
of how IPSs work is derivational-nomological, but with a distinc-
tive kind of mathematics. Computation theory, they say, plays
the same role in explaining computational systems that dif-
ferential equations play in physics. I see two differences. First,
computation theory is not used to express a closed, complete
body of empirical laws comparable to Newton's (expressed as
differential equations); rather, it is a formalism for defining
proper and nondefective operation of various computing systems
and for determining further characteristics of systems so defined.
For example, the outputs of an adding machine can be predicted
(and explained, in one sense) by deriving them from the "laws"
of arithmetic, plus statements of the initial conditions (inputs);
but the similarity to D-N explanations is illusory. Arithmetic
laws are not empirical generalizations confirmed by painstaking
observation of known adding machines (or accountants); they are
prior conditions that an activity must meet if it is to count as addi-
tion. If a planet fails to behave as predicted, it is not defective -
the laws are (or else they are misapplied). But if a machine adds
incorrectly, arithmetic is not defective - the machine is (or else it
is being misused). The empirical problem is not to discover and
verify computational laws, but to determine which black boxes
can be interpreted as performing which computations.

Response/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
Second, IPS explanation explains how something works, not
why paramaters have certain values, or even why certain events
occur. It is no more derivational-nomological than the explana-
tion of how an engine works, despite the mathematical precision
of its formulation. D-N explantion is subsumptive in character;
we understand something because we see it as an instance or
special case of what we empirically know to be invariant in na-
ture (scientific laws). What we "see" in systematic explanation is
how an organized complex of component abilities and interac-
tions "adds up" to a new overall ability. That is not subsumptive,
though, to be sure, it takes the regularity of nature for granted.
Baron, Domotor and Otto have rightly pointed out that IPS expla-
nation can employ a rigorous formal apparatus, but that does not
imply that it has the more specific form of derivational subsump-
tion.
Section 3. Several commentators noticed an oversight in my
characterization of IBBs. Since the inputs and outputs make
sense in virtue of a pattern they exhibit - a pattern that is
extended in time - an IBB interpreter can often attribute endur-
ing intentional "states" and changes therein. For example, a
blind chess player (person or machine) must keep track of, or "re-
member," the current position, updating it after each move. Such
attributions yield a fuller, or more complete, IBB interpretation.
Some input/output patterns may be so complicated as to be unin-
telligible without this added completeness (thus, attributing
beliefs and desires might be an essential ingredient in interpret-
ing human behavior). But these "full" interpretations are still
quite external, in the sense that they have nothing to do with
internal structure or workings - they imply nothing about
whether the object is an IPS, or if so, which one. They are simply
further specifications of the pattern in the inputs and outputs, in
the vocabulary of the interpretation.
Thus, Dennett points out that full IBB interpretation is all he
meant by "adopting the intentional stance" (1971). Athertonand
Schwartz note that you can attribute plans, hopes, and so forth, to
an agent without being committed to an IPS explanation. Arbib
implies that not all "functional components" are "structural
components," and Hayes says that "having a particular
componential structure" can be entailed by some IBB interpreta-
tions. This means, I take it, that a full interpretation might appor-
tion enduring states among enduring "components"; unfortu-
nately, the word "component" suggests internal structure -
perhaps "faculty" would be less misleading. (As I use the term,
a "functional component" must be a structural component in an
actual system, though, of course, the "structure" may only be
specifiable relative to another system, such as an IPS on a lower
level or dimension.) McCarthy proposes a useful terminology for
the distinction: "competence cognitivism" concerns full IBB in-
terpretations, and a step-by-step spelling out of their cogency
conditions; "performance cognitivism" involves IPS explanation
of cognitive competence in terms of actual interactions of actual
functional components. It is to performance cognitivism that my
discussions are addressed.
Andreae balks at the claim that reasonable interpretations are
"seldom hard to recognize in practice." He is thinking, however,
of finding or generating interpretations in the first place, whereas
the claim is only about recognizing them as reasonable, once
they are proposed. Tweney, on the other hand, complains that
reasonableness is too easy to find; we see "meaning and pattern"
everywhere, even in inkblots. But none of his examples involve
inputs and outputs in articulated typologies; interpreting these
on the basis of observed patterns is much more difficult.
Matthews rightly feels that the notion of "making reasonable
sense" is closely related to that of "meaningfulness," but that
does not argue against the one serving as a criterion for empi-
rically testable attributions of the other. Domotor's discussion of
theoretical meaningfulness overlooks the difference between a
meaningful theory of meaningless phenomena and an equally
meaningful 
theory 
that 
attributes 
meanings 
to 
certain
phenomena. It is like the difference between description and
translation - only the latter involves intentional interpetation.
Arbib is satisfied to call interpretations "judicious" and skip any
"Y'know what I mean?" style definitions. Were he more candid
about his own terminology, he might appreciate that all explica-
tion - scientific, philosophical, or otherwise - ultimately ends
with "Y'know what I mean?" This is no excuse for shirking the
hard work of clarification, nor for failing to acknowledge what
remains unclarified.
Dreyfus and Taylor raise a more serious question. They accept
my account of IBB interpretation for adding machines and
mechanical chess players, but they doubt that the same goes for
our "interpretations" of each other (even "applying the defini-
tions flexibly"). Both home in on the requirement that inputs and
outputs be individually and independently interpretable, once
the overall interpretive scheme is specified. (This follows, as
Dreyfus 
details, from the definition 
of "quasi-linguistic
representation.") Taylor is right in saying that the issue is not
holism (in Quine's sense); IBB interpretation is holistic, since in-
dividual interpretations are possible only relative to a successful
overall scheme. The question is, rather, "contextualism": can
there be an overall scheme that assigns interpretations to ut-
terances independent of their specific contexts? Dreyfus argues
that natural language may be essentially ambiguous, in that the
meanings of what people actually say may be only partially and
loosely constrained by the finest possible "semantics" (holistic
interpretation) for speech behavior; the particular context
(including the conversational situation, tone, etc.) supplies such
further determinateness as there is. Taylor suggests that our
sensitivity to these contexts may involve a noncognitive (in my
sense), nonsemantic (in the Quine-Davidson sense) capacity that
he calls "implicit grasp of a domain"; in other words, actual
meaningfulness may not be fully capturable in terms of in-
terpretations.
My views are as tentative as theirs. Cognitivism might have an
escape roughly like the one I outlined for perception and action,
but generalized to cover linguistic perception and speech acts. It
amounts to saying that even if people are not strictly IBBs "on
the surface," they nevertheless have an "inner" IBB, the inputs
and outputs of which we can surmise from surface stimuli and
behavior (knowing what we do about the situation, etc.). These
surmised inputs and outputs would all be quasi-linguistic, and
IPS explanation might proceed from there inward (Dreyfus ap-
propriately mentions Fodor in this connection). At stake is
whether the partial quasi-linguisticness of ordinary discourse
(its "quasi-quasi-linguisticness") is to be understood as a sur-
viving surface manifestation of a thoroughgoing, deep quasi-
linguisticness. The fate of the "interpretation approach" to
meaningfulness is the same issue. Or, in still other terms, it is ap-
proximately the question of how far McCarthy's competence
cognitivism can go, beyond what we would intuitively call
"problem solving." I just do not know.
Section 4. Hayes and Monk share a worry about "working out a
rationale"; they wonder whether this means that an IPS must
"justify" its outputs to itself or "generate a method for produc-
ing" those outputs. It does not; it only means that we can give a
certain kind of explanation of how the object consistently
manages to produce sensible outputs, namely, it is so
constructed that the internal interactions leading to its outputs
will always be interpretable (by us, not it) as the steps of ra-
tionales that justify those outputs (to us). Because we see that it is
so constructed, we can understand (explain) its consistent ability
to make reasonable sense.
Monk adds that nojt every "computer-like routine" for pro-
ducing correct outputs is interpretable as "reasoning the prob-
lem through." I agree; the overall IBB might have to be inten-
tionally instantiated before its ability can be explained. For
example, a computer simulation of the electronic circuit of an
and-gate could itself be interpreted as an and-gate, but not (on

that dimension) as an IPS. More interestingly, holographic
associative memories can be computer simulated, but the
simulations are not IPSs - even though they are instantiated on
IPSs. Indeed, on the infinite computer of folklore, we could pre-
sumably simulate the brain; but that would prove nothing about
the explanatory form of psychology. Charniak says the same
thing from the other direction: the failure of Cognitivism (in my
sense) would not entail the impossibility of intelligent com-
puters (though much current work would be undermined).
Cummins presses the point in a different way: there are IBBs
that "cogitate" (work out rationales), but that are not explainable
as systems of interacting IBB components. This does not, as he
charges, render the notion of IPS ambiguous; an IPS is, by
definition, a system of interpreted components. Avoiding this
possible confusion is the motivation for the definition. His pills-
and-liquids example is essentially similar to a diode and-gate (for
which a "machine table" and "flow chart" could also be con-
cocted). The only difference is that the temporal sequence of
overall physical states in his device more closely parallels the
order of boxes in the chart. But he is quite right that since they
are overall states of the whole object, rather than interacting
states of separate IBB components, the object is not an IPS (in
my sense); it is a physically instantiated IBB. In effect, the ma-
chine table that he provides is a competence theory (in Mc-
Carthy's sense), and is the sort of "fuller" IBB interpretation that
I allowed earlier.
Section 5. Arbib and Hayes are bothered by intentional
instantiation, and the dimension/level distinction. Arbib sup-
poses that such precise terminology rules out typical computer
programs as IPSs, which is a simple misunderstanding; instantia-
tion in a program written in another "language" is not incompati-
ble with being an IPS, though, as just mentioned, not every com-
puter instantiated IBB is (on the same dimension) an IPS. Hayes
wonders how operations on numbers and labeled trees can be in-
cluded in the interpretation of a chess-playing IPS, since they do
not pertain to chess. But on that dimension the representations
are of position values, possible move sequences, and the like; it
is only when interpreted as such that their relations and
transformations make sense in the context of explaining how a
chess player works. The interpretations of them purely as nu-
merical or abstract tree-search operations are on other (instantiat-
ing) dimensions. It is because intentional instantiation is (by
design) so often transparent, that its conceptual importance has
been overlooked.
Economos and Hayes also miss the point about physical
instantiation, she saying that significances themselves must
interact (or "have causal consequences"), and he that these
interactions are symbolic and informational, rather than causal
and energetic. On any intentional dimension of description, of
course, this is quite correct (whether or not to use the term
"causal" on such dimensions is a verbal issue). But the power of
the physical instantiation idea is that the very same interactions
can simultaneously have physical descriptions - indeed, they
must in any concrete, working system that we know how to
construct (compare Maxwell). The physical system is designed
in such a way that in obeying physical laws it will, when in-
terpreted, also "automatically" obey what Hayes calls "the very
rules which define the meanings of the symbols" (this being just
my condition on cogent interpretability; see also Davidson,
1970). If Economos thinks this still leaves a mystery, or violates
the laws of thermodynamics, then she must think the same about
pocket calculators.
Greeno and Simon believe the possibility of reduction shows
systematic or IPS explanations to be weaker than those of
physics. There is no dispute if "weaker" means "less-funda-
mental," in the sense that "fundamental" physics is (by defini-
tion) that to which all other explanation is supposed to be reduci-
ble. Nor is there dispute if they mean that an explanation and its
reduction together explain more than the explanation without
the reduction. But if, as I suspect, they mean that IPS explana-
tions are only a temporary stopgap, until more powerful physical
explanations can come in and take over, then I disagree. The
laws of physics do not and cannot say anything about chess; they
can no more explain how a chess player plays chess than the ad-
ditivity of lengths can explain how a slide rule multiplies. In
general, reducing explanations explain different things than the
explanations they reduce.
Two final points: Simon (like many people) regards reducti-
bility as essential to Cognitivism and he concludes that psycho-
physical bridge laws are necessary after all. The conclusion does
not follow. "Bridge law" is a technical term in a very specific ac-
count of how some reductions proceed, for example, the reduc-
tions of classical thermodynamics and optics. I have outlined a
general account of reduction that includes the bridge-law
procedure as a special case and systematic reduction as a quite
different special case; they should not be confused. Greeno
seems to think the following five contrasting pairs denominate
approximately the same distinction (among explanations):
systematic versus derivational-nomological; qualitative versus
quantitative; informal versus formal; semantic versus syntactic;
and less testable versus more testable. I would not comfortably
assimilate any two of these, but let me just say that IPS explana-
tions can be expressed quite formally (computation theory) and
be fully testable (do the interactions occur as required or not?)
and yet be systematic and, in some sense, "semantic."
Section 6. Baron, Dennett, and Hayes kindly remind me
of the "rightly" in my remark about hologram models:
"neurophysiologists have , . . rightly confined their speculation
to recognition and recall processes." Baron adds a stern and
generally stifling warning: "One should not think of the holo-
graphic models as any more than they were intended to be. . . .''
His own further remarks remain limited by this injunction; thus,
he discusses the possible difference between static and dynamic
models only with regard to memory.
Dennett puts the genuinely hard question more directly: can
we even imagine something roughly hologram-like "getting in-
formation processed in a much more dramatic sense" than mere
"content-driven" association? My vague outline of a chess-move
generator was meant to suggest that we can (or, at least, that it is
not obvious that we cannot); unfortunately, however, it is at best
"suggestive." As Dennett must realize, it is difficult to avoid
prejudicing the issue, just in formulating it. Are we asking for
something that "processes information" but is not an "informa-
tion processor"? That sounds incoherent. Yet we want something
that does more than simply transmit the "information" (to
another place or time) or "translate" it (into another representa-
tional mode). Even sorting it, selectively distributing it, or hav-
ing it control a mechanical process would not be sufficiently im-
pressive. We want a device that "uses" the various things it
knows to make intelligent overall choices, draw intelligent net
conclusions, and so on. We now know that IPSs can do this, at
least to some extent, but is it only IPSs that can do it? The trouble
is that if we redescribe "behaving intelligently" as "getting in-
formation processed in a dramatic sense," then our terminology
tends covertly to beg a deep question about the nature of in-
telligence. The central aim of my discussion is to define "in-
formation processing system" with enough precision to make
clear that being intelligent does not entail being an IPS. The
guiding thesis of Cognitivism is not a conceptual truism, but an
important empirical hypothesis. Dennett seems to appreciate
this. If, after that, he still finds it difficult to envision specific,
detailed alternatives ("What else could it be"?), it is not surpris-
ing - our intellectual and technological heritage leaves us all in
the same boat.
The foregoing should also explain my lack of sympathy when
GreenÂ© says he would "prefer to have a broader concept" of IPS
or when he objects that holograms "clearly" process information
or when Hayes claims they instantiate "a kind of computation."

THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Response/Hangelsnid: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
We need not haggle over particular words, but we must recog-
nize that narrow, refined concepts are at least as important to
scientific progress as broad ones. GPS, SHRDLU, DENDRAL,
CHESS 4.5, and the like all exhibit a certain kind of structure
that holographic associators, string net analogs, and maybe
people do not exhibit. I hope my definitions capture it, and I
want a term for it. Without such a "narrow" term we cannot even
sensibly ask whether human intelligence is realized in that kind
of structure, or whether there are limits to what can be so
realized - and those are crucial questions we all care about.
The trouble with the language of "information theory," "con-
trol theory," "cognitive theory," "computation theory," "deci-
sion theory," and so on is that it is used in a variety of technical
and intuitive ways. The intuitive senses make it seem obvious
that memory is "information storage and retrieval," that per-
ceptual recognition is a "transformational computation," that
making up your mind is a "decision process," and that reveries,
hunches, inclinations, and longings are "cognitive states." Then
one or another technical sense makes it seem like something
nontrivial and scientifically important has been said. To take just
one example, Baron speaks of "the very complex way that in-
formation is routed and processed within the brain"; what is he
talking about? If he means "information" in Shannon's sense,
then, of course, we can regard the brain as routing and process-
ing it, just as we can the blood, ecosystems, and telephone net-
works. If he means "information" in the sense that Sherlock
Holmes could get a lot of it from amazingly subtle clues, then he
knows little more than did William James, or even LaMettrie,
about what that has to do with the brain. But if he means "in-
formation" in the sense in which chess programs route and
process information about pieces, options, position values, and
so on, then transferring the notion to people is conjectural, and,
in the present context, question begging. More likely, however,
he has jumbled all these senses together, and thus cannot
imagine doubting that his phrase describes the decision
processes in Sherlock Holmes's neurons. It is time to start using
our terminology more selectively so that we can say exactly what
we mean and see what our evidence really supports.
Section 7. Monk feels that the seriousness of the hurdles is
hard to assess because the proper domain of Cognitivism (or
cognitive psychology) is not sharply delineated. Fair enough.
The extent of the domain is itself an empirical question to be set-
tled, in effect, by how much turns out to be cognitively explain-
able. The threat of the hurdles, if any, is that the domain will
prove disappointingly small. Hence, my strategy is to suggest
that each hurdle might be noncognitive and yet infect large areas
that one would hope to find in the cognitive domain. Thus, Do-
motor's dismissal of them as "kinky exceptions" (even physics
has exceptions, he says) entirely misses the point. Tweney sup-
poses that the problem in all three hurdles is the role of con-
sciousness. That strikes me as most plausible for understanding,
least for skills. But, frankly, I did not mention it in any of the
cases, because I do not have the foggiest idea of what to say. I
have so little grip on the notion of "consciousness" (though I do
not deny that it is genuine and important) that I cannot imagine
what a theory would have to do to account for it, nor do I know
what a theory would lack if it did not. Call if a fourth hurdle, if
you like, but I cannot even see what "clearing" it would involve.
On moods. Charniak objects that moods are not so pervasive as
I make out: they have minimal effect, he says, on currently im-
portant problems, like how we do pronoun reference, or tell
telephones from briefcases. I am not convinced. Consider a mo-
ment at a party, when someone says: "This is just too much" or
"He's driving me up the wall." Might not the objective referents
(and/or the linguistic antecedents) of "this" and "he" depend im-
portantly on whether the speaker is irritable, high, hilarious, or
feeling frisky? Understanding the sentence requires understand-
ing the situation, which includes understanding the people in
it - their moods, their personalities, their reactions to themselves
and to one another. And that understanding itself will be a func-
tion of the mood of the hearer.
We should step back, however, and ask why pronoun
reference and telephone/briefcase discrimination are "currently
important problems." There are two sandwiching reasons: first,
they are very difficult (as yet unsolved); second, according to cur-
rent views, they ought to be comparatively straightforward and
tractable - compared, that is, to full discourse analysis and appre-
ciation (or adequate "representation") of genuine human situa-
tions. These latter will almost surely require attention to moods.
(What is the import of this adjective or simile? Is that sympathy,
triumph, or bemusement in her smile?) Relative mood-inde-
pendence may in fact be part of the reason that certain gram-
matical and recognitional problems are currently important; but
if so, that is just a backhanded acknowledgment that current
theory is stumped by moods.
Pinker is seduced by "the full power of a Turing machine" and
thinks the problem with moods must lie in finding not just any
old account, but a "principled or elegant" one. Now it may be
that an infinite Turing machine could calculate every movement
of every molecule in a person's body, given the initial conditions
and physical stimuli. But that has nothing to do with
psychology - it could do the same for Lake Michigan. To say
instead that it could calculate certain behavioral outputs in terms
of "estimates of subjective probabilities, assignments of salience
to [input data]" (not stimuli!), and so on, is to assume the ade-
quacy of competence cognitivism for that range of behavior. But
it is not obvious that vindicating this assumption for mood-
influenced behavior would be "routine if tedious" (see Dreyfus>
McCarthy, and Taylor). Indeed, Pinker's own "third and more
ominous possibility" implies as much: behavior affected by
moods might not be fully determined by cognitive states alone.
My concern, however, is with performance cognitivism, and in
that case the full power of arbitrary Turing machines is quite
beside the point. The question is the "actual mechanism" by
which the behavior is produced, and whether that mechanism
can be consistently interpreted as an IPS.
There is a problem of cross purposes when Atherton and Rey
object that we do "justify" moods. Certainly, we explain the oc-
currence of moods, and, in that sense, give "reasons" for them;
thus: "Naturally Jane is upset; look at all that's happened to her."
Also, we criticize them as unseemly or overwrought ("Not that
much happened to her.") Similarly, we sometimes explain
beliefs by citing reasons for their occurrence, such as: "He thinks
it's a trap because he's paranoid," or "She only believes it be-
cause she wants to so much." But there is a different sense in
which we more often "explain" beliefs by "giving reasons": we
cite arguments from available evidence to the effect that the
belief is (probably) true. Likewise, we support desires by offer-
ing arguments to the effect that what is desired is desirable,
given evidence and other desiderata. I do not believe we give
reasons in this latter sense for moods, and that is what I mean by
saying we do not "justify" them (roughly, "epistemically").
Moods do not follow from evidence or premises and thus they
are never correct or incorrect as inferences; at most they are
understandable and proportionate, or peculiar and dispropor-
tionate. Moods do not "represent" the world, either rightly or
wrongly, as being one way rather than another; at most, they af-
fect the way the world is represented, and how one behaves in it.
The most common analogy is rose-colored glasses, which do not
"depict" the world as rosy (either justly or unjustly); at most,
they infect and influence one's judgments about the "colors" of
things.
By the way, some emotions might be different from moods in
this regard: envy, resentment, and gratitude, for example, seem
more likely to have a "representative" or "belief-like"
component than do good cheer, boredom, or grouchiness. That
is, there seems to be an aspect, or even constituent, of them that
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Response/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
is either true or false, and likewise either rationally justified or
not.
Baron, McCarthy, Natsoulas (maybe), Pinker, Rey, and Rorty
all seem to assume that whatever is noncognitive about moods is
ipso facto physiological - thus their allusions to drugs, brain
chemistry, and voltage changes. It is as though Cognitivist and
physiological explanations were the only conceivable candidates
(with the former exhausting psychology). I confess it astounds
me how quietly and easily this gets taken for granted, without a
hint of an argument, and usually without even being noticed.
Moreover, it strikes me as an intellectual cop-out: if our
psychology cannot handle it, then no psychology can, and we
will just imagine some magical "chemistry" that does - for
example, the "dormitive power" of opium. Only McCarthy is
candid about it: melancholy is "just a high concentration of
melancholine in the blood" (and bilious tempers in general have
to do with bile of various colors? ... or is it psychedelic
voltages?) And tacking on a high-sounding remark about altered
sentence probabilities, changed coupling parameters, different
functional modes, reallocated processing capacity, or
program/protoplasm interaction is just shriller whistling in the
dark. Nothing specific about moods is accommodated, except
that they vary, and make a difference.
Simon, however, has an interesting idea: a mood may not be an
"integral quality," but rather a "complex interplay" of numerous
cognitive states (together, perhaps, with "feelings"). It would be
like an exciting or depressing chapter in a novel; the characteri-
zation does not apply to any particular sentence or to any
specifiable structure of sentences, and yet there is nothing on the
pages but ordered sentences. Thus, even if boredom is no
particular cognitive state, it might be an overall feature of a large
group of them. Still, suggestive as the proposal is, several ques-
tions come to mind. First, moods are in a sense "integral" or
"coherent"; we do not find ourselves one-third bored, one-third
fascinated, and one-third crestfallen (on the other hand, it is com-
mon to be both excited and nervous, or both serious and ag-
gressive). In a story, the mood coherence is dependent upon the
author's prior sense of real life and is appreciated by an already
sensitive reader, but a psychological account must explain the
"coherence" of the "original." Second, one's successively occur-
ring new thoughts, inclinations, and so on (whether precipitated
by perception, conversation, rumination, or whatever) most of-
ten "fit" the mood one already has. How, if a mood is just an
overall character of many separate cognitive states, can it have
this general net influence on subsequent states? Third, moods af-
fect how things "seem"; a mosquito can be anything from a nui-
sance to intolerable; the same flowers or music can range from
deliciously sweet to negligible to cloying. And fourth, in dif-
ferent moods, the flesh hangs differently from the bones: facial
expressions, "body language," tone of voice. How is the model of
moods in a novel going to account for these?
I do not say that these questions cannot be answered, or even
that "chemistry" will not be just what Cognitivism needs to com-
plete the answers. I think many commentators feel that my ques-
tions do not prove anything - that I have failed to give convinc-
ing counterexamples and am just waving my hands. So they wave
their hands back, and think we are even. But that misses the
point. Cognitivists have powerful and well-developed stories to
tell about problem solving, sentence parsing, memory organiza-
tion, and the like. Whether ultimately right or wrong, these are
honest, articulate efforts, sensitive to the details of the
phenomena, with considerable explanatory content and initial
plausibility. But when it comes to moods (and, to a lesser extent,
skills and understanding), practically all they have is hand-
waves: dormitive power, with a little decorative jargon. This
situation may or may not last, but the longer it does, the more
likely it is to be important. If and when the frustrations and limi-
tations of AI and cognitive theory begin to seem like anomalies
and counterevidence (a different point for each person), then
"hurdles" such as these are good places to look for the underly-
ing problem. Hand-waving back at me does not obviate my ques-
tions; it underscores the need for them.
On skills. Baron and von Glassersfeld effectively take the
Cognitivist line to which I allude: in their words, we automate,
or store for later invocation, (pre-) motor patterns, which we have
previously built up or consciously generated. They say nothing,
either directly or indirectly, about why paying attention in-
terferes with skills, or why articulate people are so often inarticu-
late about them (Rey "sees no reason" why something could not
be said, but he does not say it). More important, they do not in
the least confront Dreyfus's difference-in-kind objection. How
can they purport to answer my worries, when they do not even
address them?
Arbib and Hayes believe human skills have already been
computer-modeled, with Samuel's checker player and Stanford's
DENDRAL. They might as well have stuck with the chess
example, but then the response would have been more obvious:
CHESS 4.5 explicitly evaluates hundreds of thousands of options
per move, which (on the best evidence) is three orders of mag-
nitude more than any person. A program that matches human
competence does not necessarily model human performance [cf.
Pylyshyn et al., BBS 1:1. 1978]. Of course, you can hypothesize
unconscious (and, so far, undetectable) human performance,
comparable to what the program does, but then again you face
the Dreyfus objection. Furthermore, known IPSs have actually
matched only a narrow range of human competence - always for
specific, highly structured ("toy") problems (spectrum analysis,
disease diagnosis from given symptoms, mathematical routines,
rule-defined games). Just suppose that human performance is in
fact realized in a radically different way. Then the possibility
even of competence matching might be fundamentally limited.
This is plausible enough, given what we know: how many com-
puter programs can do "childishly easy " things, like watching a
movie and telling you who is angry, who the good guy is, and
who won?
Rey rightly points out that the distinction between conscious
deliberation and whatever is unconscious need not coincide
with that between cognitive and noncognitive (even if delibera-
tion is a pretheoretical paradigm of cognition). I also agree that
the possibility of consciousness is more "remarkable" and in
need of explanation than that of nonconscious information
processing. My prima facie point is only that, on the level of
reflective common sense, our archetypically cognitive and skill-
ful capacities are very different. So a theory that proposes to
assimilate the latter to the former on a deeper level is driven to
postulate something that runs counter to the evidence of com-
mon sense - which is perfectly respectable in science when the
postulate is satisfying on other grounds. But in this case, the pos-
tulate has little to recommend it except that the theory would
need it to remain viable. It fits further available evidence, at best
spottily and poorly; and when you press for details, it assumes
the proportions of a deus ex machina, so powerful that you
wonder why it does not take over completely. If unconscious
chess "processing" is really just as cognitive (working through
rationales) as conscious counting out, the only operative dif-
ference being a thousandfold increase in efficiency, then why
does that last tenth of a percent have to be worked through so
clumsily and slowly? And why are so many less rule-structured,
but otherwise "easier," skills so much harder to program at all?
Simon cites H. Simon's work on different sized "chunks," for
short-term memory and processing (e.g., in chess play), but com-
pletely ignores the skilled "preprocessing" by which the rele-
vant chunks are selected. Puccetti suggests this preprocessing
might be conscious, even though we are unaware of it, and he
calls it "cognitive," even it it does not fit the IPS or "computer"
model. I think we mainly agree, though I find his terminology
foreign. The split brain work is intriguing, but I have no view on
it. I am sympathetic when Rorty and Schwartz note a deep simi-
larity between understanding and at least some skills, but I do

THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1978), 2

Response/Haugeland: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
not see the sharp distinction that Rorty wants between these and
other skills. Typing from a manuscript, driving in traffic, and the
like, even when quite "automatic," seem to involve some degree
of understanding, and I suspect that a lot of light conversation
does not involve much more. I think Rorty's distinction is
another holdover from the Rylean "intellectualist legend" that
Schwartz mentions.
Finally, Hayes and Taylor point out an important feature of
many 
skills: acceptable performance 
is constrained 
by
justifiability. Thus, no matter how people actually generate chess
moves, the moves are good precisely to the extent that they can
be rationally justified - and good players would endorse the ra-
tionales (after studying them). Hayes thinks this "argues
strongly" that the experts were working through such rationales
all along, but I see no argument stronger than: "What else could
it be"? (Cf. Atherton.) Taylor has a name for what else it could
be: "implicit grasp of a domain" with its "own kind of ra-
tionality." I believe that expressions like this are a valuable
contribution to discussion, and reflect a sensitive feel for the
phenomena, but (like everybody else) I wish we had a more
worked-out account of the nature and physical instantiability of
these phenomena.
On understanding. McCarthy conjectures that the difference
between merely manipulating symbols according to rules and
understanding them is whether they have been translated into an
"internal language." In the Cognitivist view, however, such a
language is just so many more symbols manipulated according to
(internal) rules. Schwartz sees the difficulty in internal inten-
tional states "making sense to the organism or mechanism using
them, not just to us." And Matthews is worried that Cognitivism
will "impale itself" on this problem; translation (the interpreta-
tion approach) cannot ultimately handle it, because of a regress
threat.
But it seems to me that one strength of Cognitivism is its prima
facie 
ability 
to answer 
such 
questions: 
understanding
"mentalese" just corresponds to manipulating the internal
symbols according to appropriate rules. Precisely what the IPS
model shows is that this is possible without an extra "little man
in the head" to interpret the symbols and apply the rules; gone is
the bugaboo of the question-begging homunculus. In this sense,
a chess playing machine understands perfectly well the moves
we type in, and also many of their implications.
Something else is bothering me: why do some rules make
sense, and others not? For surely there are sets of rules that we or
a machine could master, and yet that make no sense at all; a ver-
satile ability to "apply" them would not be tantamount to under-
standing the "symbols" manipulated, because there is nothing to
understand. It is tempting to suggest that the rules we actually
follow make sense "to us," just because they are the ones we
follow. But how, then, can our rules change, where a nontrivial
necessary condition on the new ones is that they make sense? It
might be answered that our "real" rules do not change; all that
change are the more specific forms that we "translate" into them.
Or perhaps (as Rey may have in mind) there are unchanging
meta-rules that determine sensible rules.
But these unchanging (eternal?) rules must be not only "built-
in" but also astonishingly powerful. The rules of chess would not
suffice because they are not general enough. Yet the abstract
structures of set theory, or even Turing Machines (which are
very general, when you allow intentional instantiation), are not
concrete enough: all sorts of nonsense systems can be instan-
tiated ("modelled") in set theory. The hypothesized built-in
rules must be both so general that they cover all possible
genuine cogency conditions and, at the same time, sufficiently
detailed and specific to rule out millions of possible sets of
nonsense rules. That is, directly or indirectly, they must fully
specify all and only the appropriate manipulations of any
symbols that pertain to any (humanly) intelligible subject matter
whatsoever (and no others). Since appropriate manipulations
often depend on individual symbols (what they "mean"), I
suspect that this double requirement forces one back to a Fodor-
like universal and innate "language of thought" (or Leibnizian
"universal characteristic"), in which anything that any human
being could ever say or imagine is already unambiguously
expressible. But one person's modus ponens is another's modus
tollens. I find the conclusion so incredible that if Cognitivism
implies it, then so much the worse for such premises.
It seems to me, however, that there is a deeper side to this:
understanding pertains not primarily to symbols or rules for
manipulating them, but to the world and to living in it. Linguistic
articulation can be a vehicle for such understanding, and perhaps
articulateness is prerequisite to any elaborate understanding.
But cases where facility with the symbols is plausibly sufficient -
like well-defined games, mathematics, and AI "micro-worlds" -
are very peculiar and, I think, parasitic. Paradigms of under-
standing are rather our everyday insights into friends and loved
ones, our sensitive appreciation of stories and dramas, our in-
telligent handling of paraphernalia and commerce. It is far from
clear that these are governed by fully explicable rules at all. Our
talk of them is sensible because we understand what we are talk-
ing about, and not just because the talk itself exhibits some
formal regularities (though that, too, is doubtless essential).
When the rationalists took cognition as the essence of being
human (res cogitans), they meant especially theoretical cogni-
tion, as in mathematics and mathematical physics. The under-
standing manifested in arts and crafts was not a different
phenomenon, but just imperfect theory, sullied by obscurity and
confusion. Cognitivism is heir to this tradition: to be intelligent
, is to be able to manipulate (according to rational rules) "clear and
distinct" 
quasi-linguistic representations - sullied now by
omissions, probabilities, and heuristics. But, deported from the
immortal soul, they forfeit their original anchorage in God's
honesty and the natural light of reason. Bereft of their credentials
from above, the distinction of certain procedures as "reasonable"
floats adrift, unless it can be otherwise explained. Evolution
comes vaguely to mind, but more needs to be said. My own
hunch is that the intelligibility of rational "theorizing" (from un-
' conscious "cognition" to set theory) is a derivative special case of
an antecedent, atheoretical, intelligent "practice" - a prior
"grasp" of how to get along in a multifarious existence. If articu-
late theory is one developed derivative, there can be others: the
appreciation of fine art, a subtle sense of personality, the "mas-
tery of metaphor" (Rorty, from Aristotle), even creativity and
wisdom. We will understand understanding when we under-
stand its many forms, primordial and refined. In the commerce of
understanding, words are only money.
Section 8. Atherton and Dreyfus (and, in a different way,
Harre) point out that part of the attraction of Cognitivism lies
in preconceptions about what counts as "explanatory" or
"scientific" (see also Dreyfus, 1972, pp. 143-46). I think this is
deep and important. While Cognitivism has broken away from
the derivational-nomological mold of physics and a few other
disciplines, it retains a larger scientific prejudice favoring com-
plexity over richness and elaboration. The ideal is a set of clearly
delineated parts or factors, which combine in exactly specifiable
ways, such that the complexes are precisely the phenomena to be
explained. It is a kind of atomism, whether of components or
variables, and its pedigree is coeval with that of clear and distinct
ideas. The sort of understanding that Cognitivism is least able to
account for may be just what is needed in psychology itself.
Harre cites the "ethogenic movement," which draws its
"rhetoric" from literature and drama (rather than mathematics
and technology?). Whether this would mean psychology could
not be "scientific" strikes me as largely a verbal question; it
could certainly be empirical, convincing, and illuminating. But,
as I said to Taylor (and admitted earlier to Dennett), what I
mostly feel the lack of is a detailed account of how such things
could be instantiated. Here Cognitivism has (so far) all the ad-

Response/Umigelsnid: The nature and plausibility of Cognitivism
vantages; my hologram speculation was at best a vague indica-
tion of what an alternative might possibly look like.
Still, 1 am not at all happy with Charniak's and Hayes's invoca-
tion of Kuhn to blunt criticism. In caricature, the sentiment is:
don't bother us with problems - "normal scientists" are sup-
posed to be pig-headed. That is not so, and Kuhn does not say it;
and, of course, nor do Charniak and Hayes quite say it. Charniak
says a critic must "become a specialist" who can "sit down with
researchers and go over computer listings," and perhaps also
come up with a "plausible replacement." Hayes suggests that
Cognitivism has not yet "crystallized," and hence expressing
misgivings is "antiscience." The implication in both cases is that
I am out of place to question and should rather keep my mouth
shut.
Not surprisingly, I disagree. Paradigms are no more sacrosanct
than anything else in science. I am not sure what it means to say
that Cognitivism has not crystallized; but if it has not, maybe that
is because it is not going to - it has probably already had more
genius-hours invested in it than has the whole of classical
physics. I agree with Charniak that in this kind of debate there
are few clear-cut rebuttals; short of a stunning new achievement,
the best a dissenter can do is "wind a web of dissatisfaction." For
that the prerequisite is a well-informed and penetrating
overview, not the nitty-gritty of workaday expertise. The aim is
not to pinpoint the flaws in particular efforts, but to begin articu-
lating what is common in a variety of well-known nagging frus-
trations - to waken, it is hoped, a few from their dogmatic slum-
bers and perhaps, somewhere, to stimulate "a new Copernicus."
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I am indebted to Jay Garfield for valuable assistance in formulating these
replies.
The Behavioral arid Brain Sciences is now calling for papers (as
well as for recommendations of topics and already published
articles or books) for Open Peer Commentary. Respondents are
requested to provide an explicit rationale for seeking or recom-
mending Commentary and to include a list of possible com-
mentators (see Instructions to Authors and Commentators).
We are also accepting informal nominations for (A) Cor-
responding Associate Commentators (who perform Open Peer
Commentary on accepted articles) and for (B) members of the
Board of Editorial Commentators (who referee submitted
manuscripts in addition to performing Open Peer Commentary).
A list of those who have thus far joined the Associateship
hierarchy is available from the editorial office (and will appear in
Volume I, Number 4 of this Journal). Qualified professionals in
the behavioral and brain sciences who have either (1) been for-
mally nominated by a current BBS Associate, (2) refereed for
BBS, or (3) had a commentary or article accepted for publication
can serve in capacity A or B.
To help in optimizing the service of Open Peer Commentary to
the behavioral and brain science community, the editorial office
would welcome suggestions from readers and Associates as to
the optimal (1) length of a commentary, (2) number of com-
mentaries per treatment, and (3) format for treatments.
Communications regarding these matters should be addressed
to the Editorial Office, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, P.O. Box
777, Princeton, N.J. 08540.
