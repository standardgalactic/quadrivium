The Free Company T-Shirt 
!
!
The word “free” is one of the most persuasive and powerful words in the English language. In business, it’s a great 
word to use when it comes to marketing to people. People love the idea of getting free stuff. One of the best and 
easiest ways you can build brand awareness, boost customer loyalty, and grow your business is by giving away free 
company swag. But take note: not all swag is created equal. Don’t make the mistake of wasting money on stuff 
that the average person ultimately just ends up throwing into a junk drawer and forgetting about— like notepads, 
pencils, stress balls, etc. Give away free t-shirts instead. Why? Because people will actually wear them. 
 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Free Company T-Shirt:  
!
• The Free T-Shirt From InVision 
• The Free T-Shirt From Trakio 
• The Free T-Shirt From When I Work
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Create a few initial design options for your company t-shirt. Once you’ve decided on a final design, have 
your first batch of shirts made and sent to you using an online retailer or local brick-and-mortar shop. 
!
Step 2: Start sending or giving your new t-shirts out to friends, prospects, social media followers, customers, and 
anyone else who requests one. Want to go the extra mile? Automate the entire process using one of the 
recommended tools listed below. 
!
Step 3: Follow up with everyone and ask them to send you photos of themselves wearing your t-shirt, or have 
them share it with you on Facebook or Twitter. Collect the photos and put them on a page on your website.

The Welcome Email 
!
!
First impressions are everything. These days, you have to spend as much time nurturing new relationships and 
building loyalty in the digital world as you do in the physical world. Consumers want to buy from companies that 
make them feel like they’re getting the same hands on, personal, “mom and pop shop” experience and attention 
online as they would if they were to actually walk into your business and meet you face to face. When you take the 
time to send every new customer a personalized welcome email, it not only gives you the opportunity to start 
nourishing a new relationship, it also gives you the chance to give new customers that personal, human touch 
they still look for when interacting with a business they haven’t bought from before. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Welcome Email:  
!
• The Airbnb Welcome Email (Source: VERO) 
• The Basecamp Welcome Email (Source: VERO) 
• The Buzzsumo Welcome Email (Source: VERO)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Decide what you want your welcome email to say, how you want it to make new customers feel, and what 
you want it to achieve. Do you want to make them feel excited? Do you want to help them be successful? Do you 
want to send them a special new customer offer? Remember: this is your chance to make a great first impression. 
!
Step 2: Craft your welcome email in your email client. Decide whether you want to send a plain-text or html 
welcome email. Both are fine—it just depends on your business, your customers, your style, and your preference. 
!
Step 3: Automate the process so you don’t have to manually send out a welcome email every time a new 
customer comes on board (most email providers have detailed steps on how to do this).

The VIP Beta Launch 
!
!
Remember in Tip #1 when we told you that everyone loves free stuff? Well the same is true when it comes to 
exclusivity. It’s great to feel like you’re part of a special group that not everyone has access to. Smart business 
people know this. It’s why you can open your wallet or purse right now and probably find one or two VIP 
membership or reward cards to a local gym, clothing shop, or grocery store. If you’re in the early stages of starting 
your business or launching a new product, one of the best ways you can build up hype and acquire customers fast 
is by offering exclusive early access to a limited amount of people. It’s what we call the VIP Beta Launch, and it’s 
how most new startups today are able to get so much instant attention and see such fast growth. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the VIP Beta Launch:  
!
• The Invite-Only Inbox By Gmail Launch 
• The Beta Program From Dropbox (Source: NextShark) 
• Spotify Canada Early-Access Launch (Source: Reddit)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Think about how you want your beta launch to work. How many people do you want to sign up? What will 
you offer people who sign up (beta products, early access, a free account for life)? Formalize your plan.  
!
Step 2: Use one of the recommended tools below to build a simple landing page that includes: (1) a description of 
your new product or business, (2) information about your beta program, (3) an opt-in form to capture information. 
!
Step 3: Start promoting your new business or product everywhere you can think of. Write a press release, email 
your friends, share the news on social media, talk about it networking events—do whatever you have to do to get 
people to visit your opt-in page.

The HARO Brand Buzz Boost 
!
!
When you’re in the early stages of growing a business or launching a new product, getting press and building buzz 
is essential. Fortunately, you don’t have to hire an expensive public relations firm or pay thousands of dollars on 
advertising in order to get the word out out about your new business or products. There are a lot of inexpensive 
options you can take advantage of. One great way to build brand buzz without having to spend a dime is by 
leveraging yourself as a thought leader or expert on a particular subject with the help of a service called Help A 
Reporter Out (HARO). HARO helps you connect with reporters and bloggers who need sources and quotes from 
industry experts for the stories they write. It’s a great way to get your company and products in front of people. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the HARO Query Email:  
!
• Request From a Wall Street Journal Writer 
• Request From an Associated Press Writer 
• Request From a Forbes Writer
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Sign up for an account at helpareporter.com. With a free account, you’ll get free queries sent to your 
inbox 3 times each day. With a paid account, you can set up keywords preferences, build a profile, and get alerts 
sent early. 
!
Step 2: Look through queries and find opportunities that will allow you to leverage yourself as an industry 
influencer. Use tools like MOZ or Buzzsumo to determine if the website where your quote will be shared on is 
reputable and has enough visitor traffic to make it worth your time.   
!
Step 3: Once you’ve picked a query, respond with your quote and a short bio and a link to your website.

The Education-Focused Email Series 
!
!
People want to work with companies that can help them solve their problems. One of the best ways you can 
differentiate from your competitors, grow your email list, and boost conversions is by showing people that you’re 
willing to go out of your way to help them. A great way to do this is by offering a free email course that potential 
customers can stumble upon and subscribe to when they are looking for answers to their questions. It’s also 
another great way to build loyalty and trust with people, because it gives you the opportunity to position yourself 
as someone who is genuinely interested in and committed to helping solve problems and provide solutions, and 
less as someone who is obsessed with trying to make a quick buck. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Education-Focused Email Series:  
!
• The User Behavior Course Product Psychology 
• The Quick Tips Course From CoSchedule 
• The Scheduling Crash Course From When I Work
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Decide on a topic for your course. Your topic should relate to your industry and the problems your 
business or products help solve. It should also have some SEO power behind it, so perform some keyword research 
using Google Adwords’ Keyword Tool before making the final decision about your topic. 
!
Step 2: Write the lessons for your email course (no more than six). Start with an introduction, then go deeper as 
the course progresses. End the course with a strong call-to-action that helps people understand what to do next.  
!
Step 3: Create a drip campaign for your course using one of the tools below, then promote it by sending an email, 
writing a blog post, creating a landing page, and sharing it with your social media followers.

The Promise, Not Features Headline 
!
!
Headlines are extremely important when it comes to websites—some might say even more important than the 
rest of the copy you put on your homepage. Why? Because your headline is often the first thing people notice 
when they land on your homepage—it’s another “first impression” opportunity.  In a lot of cases, it only takes the 
average person about 15 seconds or less to decide whether or not to stay on your website or continue their search 
elsewhere. Crafting the right headline can help you keep visitors on your page longer—long enough to convince 
them that you have the solution they’ve been looking for. If you want to start testing how different headlines 
perform, write one that offers a specific promise. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Promise, Not Features Headline:  
!
• The Headline From Rejoiner (Source: Quick Sprout) 
• The Headline From Salesforce 
• The Headline From Trunk Club (Source: Quick Sprout)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Write a list of 25 potential headlines to use on your site. Try to avoid writing headlines that describe what 
your business is. Instead, write ones that describe what your customers get as a result of using your products or 
services. Your headlines should be between 5-9 words.  
!
Step 2: Pick your best 2-3 headlines and perform some preliminary research to determine which one performs 
best. This can be done by using a tool like Optimizely. For a less expensive test, create two tweets that both go to 
the same site but use a different headline for each. Track which one gets the best click-through-rate.  
!
Step 3: Add the winning headline to your homepage. Perform new headline A/B tests from time to time.

The Lean Homepage A/B Test 
!
!
When you’re in the early stages of launching your business, you want to try to spend as little as possible to get 
your operation up and running. That’s why it’s fairly common for new business owners to make the mistake of 
thinking that once the first version of their business website is finally complete and up and running, it never has 
to be touched again. But if your business is one that heavily relies on business from online consumers, you can’t 
afford to neglect your website in this way. It’s essential that you take time to learn about the people who visit 
your website in an effort to find out what it is that ultimately influences their decision to convert or not convert. 
Thankfully, there are a lot of inexpensive tools out there that make performing A/B tests on your website a breeze. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Lean Homepage A/B Test: 
!
• Call-To-Action A/B Test From USTREAM (Source: Optimizely.com) 
• Navigation Menu A/B Test From Formstack (Source: Hubspot.com) 
• Headline Copy A/B Test From AWAYfind (Source: Unbounce.com)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Pick two areas of your homepage that you could A/B tests on. Examples include your headline copy, the 
placement, color, or language of your main CTA button, the items in your navigation menu, or the entire 
homepage itself.  
!
Step 2: Use one of the recommended tools listed below to build individual experiments for each of the areas of 
your website you wish to test. Each tool provides helpful resources that you can refer to when setting up your test. 
!
Step 3: Push your experiment live. Let it run for no less than a week, review the results you get, then make 
changes to your site accordingly.

The Quick Feedback Request 
!
!
Unfortunately, when it comes to doing business with people online, you just don’t get the same level of 
interaction that you would if you were selling them your products or service face-to-face—at least not 
automatically. When you interact with someone in person, you can easily sense or observe things like confusion,  
hesitation, or excitement. If you sense that a person is unwilling to buy from you, you can engage with them and 
ask them why they feel the way they do. That level of interaction is an important part of business growth, and it  
needs to happen online too. One great way to start interacting with people and learning from them online is by 
implementing tools that encourage and invite your website visitors to provide feedback with you. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Quick Feedback Request:  
!
• The Feedback Request From GQ (Source: Qualaroo) 
• The Feedback Request From TomTom (Source: Qualaroo) 
• The Feedback Request From The University of Alberta (Source: KISSmetrics)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Think about what kind of questions you wish you could ask your website visitors. For example, maybe you 
want to know if your homepage copy makes sense. Or maybe you want to know what reservations people have 
about buying products from you. Write your questions down in a document and pick one you’d like to start with.  
!
Step 2: Create an account for one of the recommended tools below. Once you have your account set up, build 
your form. Make sure the question (or questions) you include in your form are easy to understand.  
!
Step 3: Publish your feedback form and start gathering feedback by sharing your form on social media or boosting 
traffic to your website. Interpret the data you get and decide if there are changes that could be made.

The Personalized Call-To-Action 
!
!
As mentioned in Tip #7, A/B testing is a great way to learn more about how your website visitors think and why 
they make the decisions they make. Just like headlines, there’s a lot you can test when it comes to call-to-action 
buttons. You can run tests on things like color, location, size, and shape, but you should also take the time to run 
tests on copy—the actual words you use to try to get people to convert. To differentiate from competition and get 
people to actually click on the buttons you include on your website, you have to think about your industry, your 
customers, and the problems your products or services help solve. You can’t just use the same language everyone 
else uses in their CTA buttons—like “Buy Now” or “Sign Up”. You have to dig deeper and get more personal. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Personalized Call-To-Action:  
!
• "Start Scheduling" CTA From When I Work 
• "Start Designing" CTA From Canva 
• "Become a Driver" CTA from UBER
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Set up your account on Visual Website Optimizer (VWA). Alternatively, you can use Optimizely if desired. 
If needed, go through any of the recommended readings to familiarize yourself with call-to-actions.  
!
Step 2: Think about the problems that your business helps solve. Remember: your goal is to find out if you can 
boost conversions by using personalized messaging that your prospects can relate to—as opposed to using the 
standard messaging that you typically see on CTA button. Come up with a few button copy options to test.  
!
Step 3: Create and launch your A/B test. Let it run until you have enough data to determine which version is more 
effective.

The Handwritten Thank You Letter 
!
!
We live in a pretty technology-driven world. We rely heavily on technology to be successful in our personal and 
professional lives. That being said, at the end of the day, we’re all guilty of feeling nostalgic at one point or 
another about certain tendencies and routines of the past. In business and in life, saying the words “thank you” 
can be extremely meaningful and powerful for all parties involved. One of the best ways you can boost customer 
loyalty and land new customers is by expressing appreciation and gratitude to those who choose to buy from you 
and work with you—after all, your business can’t survive without your customers. If you really want to impress 
and surprise your new customers, send them a handwritten letter or card thanking them for their business.
Examples of Use

How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Compose a few templates you can use when it comes time to write a thank you letter to a new customer. 
Include a few spots in your letter where customization/personalization can be added.  
!
Step 2: Develop a process or plan for sending out thank you letters to new customers. Your letter should be sent 
within a week of your new customer coming on board. If your business is still small, you can handwrite and send 
the letters yourself, or have one of your employees help you. If you’re growing too fast to send manually, hire a 
freelancer to help you, or use one of the recommended letter-writing tools below.  
!
Step 3: Buy materials if needed (cards, pens, envelopes) and start sending out your thank you letters.

The “Get Right To The Point” Landing Page 
!
!
Sometimes people don’t need to be sold on all the features you offer. Sometimes people don’t need to land on a 
fancy website full of photos and design components and smooth parallax functionality to decide if they want to 
buy from you. Sometimes they want a more simple experience. Sometimes when you’re selling to people online, 
all you really need to do is get right to the point. That’s why running A/B tests on your homepage or on other 
landing pages is worth your time—you could find out that your customers don’t need to see all the junk you think 
they need to see in order to convert. In fact, sometimes all that junk just makes for a lower conversion rate. If you 
haven’t been seeing the conversion numbers you expected, try simplifying your website and get right to the point.
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the “Get Right To The Point” Landing Page:

• The Homepage From Neil Patel

How To Implement This Tip

do when they land on your site. Do you want them to give you their email address? Sign up for a free account? Try 
a demo? Your answer will help you determine what the main focus of your new landing page will be.

The Lean Social Branding Design Technique 
!
!
These days, you don’t need to hire an entire marketing or design team in order to compete with the big guys—in 
fact, we recommend that you try your hardest to keep things at your startup as lean as possible for as long as 
possible. That being said, if you do decide to take our advice and hold off on hiring someone to help you with the 
occasional design projects that pop up from time to time as you grow your business, you’re going to have to pick 
up the slack yourself. Creating brand-consistent graphics for your social media accounts is one design project that 
you can’t afford to neglect. Fortunately, there are a lot of tools out there that make it possible—and even easy—to 
create professional-grade branding graphics that will help you build trust and connect with more prospects. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Social Branding Designs:  
!
• Coca-Cola on Facebook and Twitter 
• Autosend on Facebook and Twitter 
• Whole Foods on Facebook and Twitter
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Decide what type of message you want to portray through your social media designs. These are the 
graphics that appear on your Facebook page, Twitter profile, LinkedIn company page, and any other sites you’ve 
decided to create a presence on. Your designs should incorporate your logo and any other imagery that is 
consistent with any other marketing material you’ve already created.  
!
Step 2: Create your first round of graphics using one of the recommended tools below. We recommend giving 
Canva a try first. If needed, you can find size dimensions and best practices in the recommended reading section.

The Screencast Product Demo 
!
!
Did you know that our brains process visuals 60,000x faster than text? With that fact in mind, it’s no surprise that 
videos have become one of the primary ways new and existing businesses educate consumers on their products 
and services. Thanks to video hosting sites like YouTube, Vimeo, and the plethora of video creation software tools 
that now exist, it’s never been easier for businesses to create and share high-quality videos with people online. 
Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to know where to start. If you want to start experimenting with creating videos 
for your business, start with a product demo video. Most businesses that have an active presence online have 
product demo videos. Why? Because they’re helpful, they’re easy to make, and they’re great conversion tools. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Screencast Product Demo:  
!
• The Product Demo Video From BaseCamp 
• The Product Demo Video From ZenPayroll 
• The Product Demo Video From Zapier
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Think about what you want to focus on during your demo. For example, you could provide a broad 
overview of your product, or you could focus in on a particular feature that you know people need help 
understanding how to use effectively. Write up a preliminary outline for your demo.   
!
Step 2: Next, write a script for your product demo. Since only your voice will be included in the video, you can 
read from it word for word when it comes time to record. Your script should also include cues that help remind 
you what to show on your screen as you give your demo. Go through your entire demo 1-2 times before recording.  
!
Step 3: Use one of the tools below to record your demo. When it’s ready, upload and share it on your website.

The Promotion-Driven Godzilla Blog Post 
!
!
As a rule of thumb, you should never create a blog post (or any piece of content) that you can’t promote. It’s a 
waste of time. For that reason, when it comes time to think of your next blog post idea, it can be helpful to start at 
the end and work your way back. You need to write blog posts that people actually want to read, but your posts 
also have to be good enough to make people want to share them with others too. Enter the Promotion-Driven 
Godzilla Blog Post. You’ve likely seen these types of posts before as a reader of blogs—these are the monster posts 
that you come across and can’t help but think to yourself: “Wow, this is amazing stuff!” They’re usually 2,000 
words or more and are packed full of tips, resources, and other useful information. It’s time for you to write one.

How To Implement This Tip

Step 1: Find a great blog post on a topic you’d like to write about that already exists—one that has been linked to 
and shared hundreds or thousands of times. You can figure this out using a tool like Buzzsumo. 
!
Step 2: Read through the post and ask yourself: could you make it better by adding more depth to it? Or by 
updating it with new information? If you think you can, start working on writing your own post. Warning: do not 
plagiarize someone else’s work. Your goal is to provide something better that is ORIGINAL. No one likes a cheater.  
!
Step 3: Compile a list of websites, blogs, and people you can send your post to once it goes live. Then publish 
your post, and send emails out to everyone asking them to share the link and help you promote your new post.

The Elevator Pitch Explainer Video 
!
!
How many times have you been asked to tell someone about your business? How long does it usually take you to 
describe it to people? Five minutes? Two minutes? How about 30 seconds? In business, time is money. If part of 
your journey of launching your business involved writing a business plan or pitching to potential investors, then 
you know how important things like brevity and your choice of words are when it comes to describing your 
business. You have to be confident that if you walked into an elevator with someone and they asked you what you 
did, you could describe it by the time the doors opened again. The same speed, precision, and consistency needs 
to take place when you’re pitching people online. So how do you do it? By making a stellar Explainer Video.
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Explainer Video:  
!
• The Explainer Video From Spotify 
• The Explainer Video From Airbnb 
• The Explainer Video From Dollar Shave Club
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Think about what you want your video to look like and how you want it to make people feel. Spend a few 
days watching explainer videos from other companies and jot down some notes about what you like or don’t like 
about them. If you’d like someone else to create your video for you, use one of the recommendations below.  
!
Step 2: Write a first-draft script for your explainer video. Keep in mind: your video should be no longer than two 
minutes, it should tell a story, have a voice, and it should compel people to take some sort of action after the 
video ends. If desired, read up on other explainer video script best practices. Then finalize your script.  
!
Step 3: Begin work on the actual production of the video. Revise, make edits, and finalize. Upload when complete.

The Editorial & Social Calendar Strategy 
!
!
To implement successful marketing strategies and campaigns for your business, you have to have a plan. When it 
comes to participating in social media communities and blogging for your business, the worst thing you can do is 
be inconsistent. If you’ve made the decision to invest your time and money into using social media and blogging 
as marketing and conversion tools, you have to go all in. You can’t half-ass it. If you’re still relatively new to social 
media and blogging, or if you’ve been neglecting either lately, one of the best ways to get back on the right track 
is by using editorial and social media publishing calendars. Calendars not only help you plan ahead and save time,  
they also force you to think more about your customers and the types of content you want to create and share. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Editorial & Social Calendar Strategy:  
!
• The Editorial Calendar From Buffer (Source: Buffer) 
• The Editorial Calendar From CoSchedule (Source: Buffer) 
• The Annual Editorial Calendar From Forbes (Source: CoSchedule)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Sign up for one of the tools below. You can create editorial calendars using a pencil and paper or a 
program like Excel, but if you use one of the tools we list, you can automate some of your efforts and end up 
saving even more time.  
!
Step 2: Begin building your calendars. Think about what types of updates you’d like to share, how often you’d like 
to publish, and when you’d like to share content with your followers. Ideally, you should publish content on days 
and at times when you know your followers are listening. To determine that, you’ll need to dive into analytics. 
!
Step 3: Keep updating your calendars. Try to get to the point where you’re working 30 days ahead of schedule.

The Surprise First, Ask Second Guest Post 
!
!
One of the most effective ways to boost website traffic, build brand buzz, and connect with new potential 
customers online is by guest posting on other popular and reputable blogs around the web. That being said, you 
have to do it right. For guest posting to be helpful in any way to you and your business, you have to choose 
opportunities wisely. A good way to do so is by thinking not in terms of the new links you could get as a result of 
your efforts, but in terms of the new relationships you could establish instead. Want to avoid sending out cold 
guest post requests to people? Stand out by mentioning them in a blog post on your site first before sending your 
request. Not only will it perk their interest, it will show them that you’re interested in relationships, not links.
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Guest Post Outreach Email Templates:  
!
• The Guest Post Outreach Email From Me (Sujan) 
• The Guest Post Outreach Email Template From Quick Sprout (Source: Quick Sprout) 
• The Guest Post Outreach Email Template From Groove (Source: Groove)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Use Buzzsumo and Twitter to make a list of potential blogs you’d like to write a guest post on. Look for 
blogs that relate to your industry or target audience. Only choose reputable blogs that regularly update their site 
with new posts. Find email addresses for the person you’d like to send your guest post request to.  
!
Step 2: Read a few blog posts that have been recently published on the site you want to guest post on. Jot down 
the topics covered on the blog, the writing style, and anything else you notice. Come up with 3-5 topic ideas. 
!
Step 3: Mention the company, site, or person you want to work with somewhere in your next blog post. Then send 
an email to the contact you found and share the post with them. Add in your guest post pitch and see if they bite.

The Trigger-Based Customer Email Series 
!
!
It’s tempting to feel like your job is done once you make the sale, but if you’re at all interested in customer 
retention and repeat business, your work is far from over. Thanks to the widespread adoption and use of email and 
smart devices, you have the opportunity to continue nurturing customer relationships long after the initial sale in 
ways that were never before possible. Most businesses today attempt to collect email addresses from prospects 
and customers as an additional way to connect with them after they’ve made a purchase or left a store or website, 
but if you haven’t ever done so for your business before, now is the time to start. One of the best new ways to 
nurture leads and build customer relationships today is by sending out trigger-based emails.
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Trigger-Based Emails:  
!
• The UBER Welcome Email (Source: Hubspot) 
• The Modcloth 6 Months Together Email ((Source: Hubspot)

Step 1: Think about the lifecycle of your customers. What information do they need in order to be successful and 
at what point in time do they usually need or ask for that information. If they haven’t converted yet, how can you 
persuade them to take the next steps? These are questions that will help you write your trigger-based emails.  
!
Step 2: Review the recommended tools below and decide which one will work best for you. Sign up for an account 
and spend time learning how the platform works and what is needed from you before you can launch your trigger-

The Industry Influencer Blog Post 
!
!
When you want to learn more about a particular topic, process, strategy, or industry, where do you usually go? If 
you’re like us, you look for experts and try to learn from them. If you’ve been blogging consistently week after 
week but you’re not seeing the results you were hoping for, it’s time to try something new. One strategy we use to 
drive more traffic to blog posts and reach new audiences involves publishing what we call Industry Influencer 
Blog Posts. These are round-up style posts that include original advice, tips, and experiences from real experts 
who have agreed to chime in on a particular topic or question. They are great for building new relationships with 
influencers who are willing and able to help promote your content and bring new readers to your blog. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Industry Influencer Blog Post:  
!
• The Marketing Predictions Post From Forbes 
• The SEO Post From Ahrefs 
• The Blogging Post From Buffer
How To Implement This Tip

Step 1: Come up with your topic and think of one question you can send to your list of contributors. The trick is 
to make your question easy to answer, but broad enough to allow for a wide variety of interesting answers.

Step 2: Build a list of people you’d like to reach out to for your blog post. Then, create a Google Form that you can 
send to your list that includes your question and a spot for them to leave their names, titles, and company 
websites. For example, here’s a form that I (Sujan) created and used to gather quotes for a recent post I published.

The Social Proof Confidence-Booster 
!
!
Social proof is a type of conformity. It’s the concept that people decide to do what they think others are doing in 
an attempt to reflect what they view as correct behavior. In business, social proof can be an incredibly powerful 
tool when it comes to influencing purchasing decisions. Whether you realize it or not, most business websites you 
visit today display some sort of social proof in an effort to boost conversions. You can (and should) use the same 
strategy to try to persuade more people to convert when they land on your page. Sure, you might not have as 
many users as Facebook or send your products to customers in every single country in the world, but you can still 
come up with  and display  on your website social proof that relates to your business in some way. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Social Proof Statements:  
!
• The Social Proof From Basecamp 
• The Social Proof From Buffer 
• The Social Proof From Help Scout
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Think about what kind of social proof statement or visual you can display on your website. For example, 
you can share customer testimonials, the number of products you’ve sold, the number of customers or followers 
you have, how many cities, states or countries you ship products to, or review ratings for your products or 
services.  
!
Step 2: If you don’t have a designer or web developer on hand to help you illustrate your social proof statement, 
use a tool like Canva or PowerPoint to make your graphic. Incorporate your new graphic on your homepage.  
!
Step 3: If desired, create a few different versions of your social proof statement and A/B test using Optimizely.

The Progress Bar 
!
!
Along with social proof statements, it’s also safe to say that you probably regularly see and are influenced by 
progress bars on websites—even if you don’t always consciously notice them. It’s another great tactic that 
businesses use to get people to do things like buy a product, complete a profile, or make it through an onboarding 
process. Why do progress bars work so well? There’s actually a fair amount of science behind it, but the gist is, as 
humans we feel the need to complete unfinished tasks. In fact, our bodies even reward us for completing tasks by 
releasing endorphins. As a business owner, you should take the time to capitalize on this idea by incorporating 
progress bars somewhere on your website. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Progress Bar:  
!
• The Blog Setup Progress Bar From Ghost (Source: Ghost) 
• The Referral Progress Bar From Referral Saasquatch (Source: Referral Saasquatch) 
• The Mobile Checkout Progress Bar From Under Armour (Source: Smashing Magazine)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Think about where you could add a progress bar in your conversion process. Could you build a progress 
bar that helps users determine where they are in the setup process? Or perhaps you could you build a progress bar 
to show them what else they need to do in order to use your product or service successfully.  
!
Step 2: Work with a designer and a developer to start working on the look and functionality of your progress bar. 
Your progress bar should update as your user or customer completes the assigned tasks you’ve included.  
!
Step 3: Test your progress bar, try to break it, fix any weak areas, then push it live.

The Beefy Customer Testimonial 
!
!
You can spend all day talking about how great your products and services are, but at the end of the day, the people 
you’re trying to sell to are more likely to be influenced by what other people say about you, your company, and 
your products. That’s why most business owners go out of their way to gather customer testimonials and 
encourage happy customers to write reviews about their products or their business as a whole. Testimonials can 
be powerful conversion tools! The problem is that everyone has figured this out, and as a result, everyone now 
includes testimonial text blurbs in strategic places around their website. That’s why we recommend you take the 
time to create beefier customer testimonials in the form of videos, case studies, and spotlight blog posts. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Beefy Customer Testimonial:  
!
• The Customer Testimonial Video From ZenPayroll 
• Case Study Blog Post From Zapier 
• The Customer Testimonial Video From When I Work
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Create a list of 5 happy or loyal customers you could reach out to for a testimonial. Decide whether you 
want to create a video testimonial, a case study, or a blog post. Consider asking your customer for their 
preference.  
!
Step 2: Come up with an outline for your testimonial interview. If you decided to move forward with the blog post 
or case study, write up a few questions and send them to your customer to answer. If you decided on the video, 
coordinate with your customer and find a day/time that you can record them on video.  
!
Step 3: Put your customer testimonial together and when it is complete, place it prominently on your homepage.

The Live Chat 
!
!
You can learn a lot about your business by talking to your customers. It seems like such a simple concept, but 
you’d be surprised to know how many business owners fail to actually take the time to have honest, open 
conversations with their customers. It’s true! As a result, they end up making decisions based on assumptions—
assumptions that aren’t always correct. If you want to grow your business and gain a better understanding of your 
customers, their pain points, their objections, and their needs, you need to take the time to actually talk to them. 
Unless you see your customers in person on a regular basis, you need to be more proactive when it comes to 
communicating with them. Putting live chat on your website is one great way to get started. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Live Chat:  
!
• Live Chat on IndiGo Car Hire (Source: Zopim) 
• Live Chat on Disruptive Advertising (Source: Olark)

!
Step 1: Sign up for one of the recommended tools below. Read through the onboarding and setup documentation 
to learn more about how to use the tool you choose.

Step 2: Before you implement live chat on your website, you need to decide who on your team is going to be in 
charge of managing and responding to live chats, when you’re going to make the live chat available to your 
visitors, and what your goals are (what do you want to learn from customers?).  You should also come up with 
some clear guidelines that people can follow or refer to when responding to live chats.  
!
Step 3: Launch live chat on your site, let your customers know the feature exists, and see how the first week goes.

The Tell Your Story, Sell More Products Method 
!
!
Everybody loves a good story. In business, telling a good story can lead a potential customer to pick you over one 
of your competitors. Thanks to advances in technology and the popularity of sites like YouTube, Vimeo, 
Instagram, Snapchat, and others, it has never been easier to create and share stories with the entire world. As a 
business owner, it’s important that you take the time to develop a compelling brand story that you can share with 
people—it’s an essential part of building your reputation and helping people understand why you do what you do 
and how your business came to be. Telling your brand story is also a great way to build trust and remind people 
that at the end of the day, your business is managed and run by real humans. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of great brand stories:  
!
• The Story Behind TOMS Shoes 
• The Story Behind CustomInk  
• The Story Behind Sweet Leaf Tea
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Spend an afternoon thinking about what led you to start your business, who was there to help you, and 
how you felt. Jot down a few pages of notes and create an initial outline for your brand story. 
!
Step 2: Decide how you want to tell your brand story. Some brands choose to create an entire infographic-like 
timeline that illustrates how their business came to be. Others like to tell their brand story on video, or with a 
combination of words and photos. Write the first draft of your brand story and gather any supporting materials 
you’d like to include (quotes from others, old photos and footage, old logos, etc).   
!
Step 3: Publish your brand story somewhere on your website. Then start sharing it with your network.

The Responsive Design Conversion Strategy 
!
!
Your business website might looks great on a computer, but how does it look when you try to access it from your 
smartphone or tablet? Ten years ago—and maybe even five—it didn’t matter much, but these days, if people can’t 
easily view your products and services from their mobile devices, you risk losing them to a competitor who has 
taken the time to make sure their website it optimized for every type of viewing experience. If you haven’t gotten 
with the times yet and made some serious changes to your website in order to cater to the mobile habits of the 
general public, you can’t afford to wait any longer. It’s time to implement a responsive design for your website.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Responsive Design:  
!
• Responsive Design From Skinny Ties (Source: Digital Telepathy) 
• Responsive Design From The Boston Globe (Source: Digital Telepathy) 
• Responsive Design From Mashable (Source: Digital Telepathy)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: If you aren’t familiar with responsive design, go through the recommended resources listed below.  
!
Step 2: Make a plan for launching an updated website that can be easily viewed on any device. If you don’t have a 
website yet and you can’t afford to hire a developer, there are plenty of website platforms you can find online that 
offer responsive themes. If you do have a website already, determine what needs to happen in order to make the 
changes. Set a timeline for yourself and your team and decide on an official launch date for your updated site.  
!
Step 3: Work with your internal developers to update your website, teach yourself along the way, or hire a 
freelancer to help you complete the project.

The “Unboxing” Video 
!
!
Remember how excited you were as a kid to open presents on your birthday? If you’re a business owner who sells 
physical goods and products to your customers, your goal should be to work as hard as possible to create the same 
experience for when your customers finally get your products in their hands. But you shouldn’t stop there. You 
should also make an effort to create that same level of excitement for your prospects—the people who have never 
stepped foot in your store or even heard about your products or business before. So how do you do it? One great 
way is by creating “unboxing” videos for your products. An unboxing video is kind of like a product demo video, 
but it should be a little more fun, a little less serious, and a little more exciting.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the “Unboxing Video”:  
!
• The BookBook Unboxing Video From IKEA 
• The Naked Lipgloss Unboxing From Urban Decay  
• The iPhone 6 Unboxing Video From Apple
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Watch a few unboxing videos on YouTube to get an idea of the kinds of videos people are producing. Most 
unboxing videos you’ll find are made by consumers, as opposed to brands, which is great—because it’ll give you 
the unique perspective needed to make a video that your customers will get excited about.  
!
Step 2: Write a script and a brief summary of what you want to happen in your video. Do you want to physically 
unbox your product on camera while you talk about what makes it so great? Or would you rather talk on screen 
and cut in and out of photos or footage of your product? Think about what your customers would want to see. 
!
Step 3: Begin production on your video. You don’t have to hire professionals. Finalize it and put it online.

The Free Ebook / Resource 
!

If you own a business, it’s probably safe to say that you possess a good amount of experience and knowledge on a 
particular subject, industry, or type of product. You might be sharing your insight and expertise with other people 
on your team, in one-on-one conversations with customers, or in the blog posts that you publish on your website, 
but have you ever thought about packaging your advice, stories, or tips into an ebook or other type of 
downloadable resource? It’s a great and relatively easy way to start getting the word out about your business, 
leveraging yourself as an industry influencer, and adding more email addresses to your list. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Free Ebooks:  
!
• The Free Guide From ZenPayroll

How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Decide on the topic and preliminary title of your ebook or resource. To pick a topic, think about the most 
common questions you get from customers, review the content you’ve published on your blog in the past, and do 
some initial keyword research. Once you have your topic, write an outline for your book.  
!
Step 2: Build a simple opt-in form to place on your website. You want to put this form up as soon as you can so 
that you can start promoting it and collecting email addresses from people who are interested in reading it.

The Demographic-Targeted Blog Post 
!
!
When it comes to blogging, you’ll never get the traction or the ROI you want to get unless you’re willing to try 
different things. A content or blogging strategy that works for one company you follow might not necessarily 
work for your blog or your audience. That being said, there is one type of blog post that we’ve found to be fairly 
successful for a lot of different companies we’ve worked with in the past. It’s what we call the Demographic-
Targeted Blog Post, and the reason it tends to do so well for most companies is because of how ultra-specific they 
are. With Demographic-Targeted Blog Posts, your goal is to create compelling content for a very specific type of 
person or group of people within your broader target audience. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of demographic-targeted blog posts:  
!
• The Blog Post From Movoto 
• The Blog Post From Mint 
• The Blog Post From Lululemon
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Make a list of potential blog topics. To come up with ideas, perform keyword research and think about 
who your ideal customer is. What are their interests? Where do they live? What milestones have they 
experienced? The blog post topic you decide on and the content you create should cater exclusively to a specific 
type of person or group of people within your broader target audience.  
!
Step 2: Once you’ve decided on a topic, write your blog post. While you write, use Buzzsumo to find influencers 
and bloggers who might be willing to share your post with their followers once you publish it. Publish your post. 
!
Step 3: Start promoting it by emailing the influencers you found earlier and asking them to share the post.

The Top Posts Digest 
!
!
The problem with blogging regularly for your business is that sometimes your best blog posts and most-shared 
content gets buried overtime as you continue to publish more and more content. As a marketer, it’s your job to 
implement promotion strategies that keep these posts alive. One great way to extend the life of your blog posts is 
by creating what we call a Top Posts Digest. A Top Post Digest is a compilation of your best and most shared blog 
posts from a particular period of time. Lots of companies publish this type of post, not because they are interested 
in tooting their own horn or patting themselves on the back, but because it’s a great way to get their best and 
most well-received content in front of new readers and potential customers. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Top Posts Digest:  
!
• Shutterstock's Top Posts For 2014 List 
• Buffer's Top Posts For 2014 List 
• When I Work's Top Posts For Bosses List
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Use Google Analytics to compile a list of posts that received the highest traffic during a particular period 
of time. You can also compile a list of top posts that all relate to the same topic. Decide how you want to share

The Social Media / Blog Giveaway 
!
!
As mentioned back in Tip #1, people love to take advantage of opportunities to win free stuff. It doesn’t matter 
how old you are, winning is— and always will be—exciting. With that in mind, another easy way to build brand 
awareness, grow your email list, increase traffic to your website, and land more customers is by launching a 
giveaway on your blog or a contest on one of your social media pages. If you haven’t been seeing the level of 
engagement that you wish you were seeing on your social media pages, or if your blog traffic has flatlined, 
launching a giveaway can be a great way to light the spark again.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Social Media / Blog Giveaways:

Step 1: Do some brainstorming to decide what kind of contest you want to run, where you want to run it, what 
you want people to do in order to enter, and what you want to give away. Tip: don’t give away a lame prize—offer 
something that people can actually get excited about.  
!
Step 2: Sign up for one of the recommended tools below and begin building your giveaway or contest. 
!
Step 3: Launch your contest by sharing the news on social media, writing a blog post about it, inviting your 
customers to participate, and emailing anyone else who can help you get the word out about your campaign.

return. We call this the Gated Content Method. It’s an effective strategy that a lot of businesses use to capture 
more leads and nurture relationships online.

The Weekly Roundup Blog Post 
!
!
As a new business owner, you can’t waste any time when it comes to building up your credibility and positioning 
yourself as someone who knows what they’re talking about. If you want people to engage with you, work for you, 
and buy from you, you have to prove to them that you have the right ideas, the right solutions, and the right 
frame of mind. One great way to start making a name for yourself in the industry you operate in is by publishing 
Weekly Roundup posts on your blog. The Weekly Roundup Blog Post is another type of compilation post, similar 
to the post mentioned in Tip #29, but slightly different. With this post, instead of sharing your own best posts, 
you’re curating and sharing great posts from other people and companies in your industry.  
Examples of Use

Here are a few real-world examples of Weekly Roundup Blog Posts:  
!
• The Weekly Roundup From Bon Appetit 
• The Weekly Roundup From FiveThirtyEight

choice would be a topic that directly relates to your industry or customers in some way.

podcasts, and other types of content to link to and include in your weekly roundup.

Step 3: Gather the links you’d like to include in your first weekly roundup. Write a 1-2 sentence summary for each 
piece of content you include in your roundup. After your post goes live, email the people you included in your 
post to let them know you mentioned them and to ask them if they’d be willing to share your post.

The Free Tool That Helps & Converts 
!
!
As a business owner, your job is to make your website visitors care more about you. By helping them, you have a 
better chance of developing an ongoing relationship with them. When you need help, what’s the first thing you 
usually do? Grab your iPhone and plug your question into Google and wait for it to spit out answers, right? Your 
prospective customers do the same. Wouldn’t you like to show up at the top of that Google results list whenever 
your customers ask questions that you can help them answer? That’s where the opportunity to share an original, 
interactive tool comes into play. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of free conversion tools:  
!
• The Employee Scheduling Excel Template From When I Work 
• The Mortgage Calculator From Zillow 
• The Social Media Marketing Resource Kit From Buffer
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Decide what kind of tool you want to make. You should create a tool that (1) helps your ideal customer in 
some way, (2) has SEO value, (3) doesn’t cost you a lot of time or money to develop, and (4) allows you to build 
and nurture a list of potential customers.  
!
Step 2: Create your tool. Your tool doesn’t need to be complicated. It just needs to answer someone’s question or 
solve someone’s problem. For your first tool, consider making something that doesn’t require hiring a developer 
to help produce, like a template, a cheat sheet, a planning document, or a reference chart. 
!
Step 3: Decide where your tool is going to live. You can go as simple as creating a blog post, or you can create an 
entire landing page for your tool. Write copy for your tool, incorporate an opt-in form to capture emails, and 
automate delivery using an email client like Mailchimp.

The Better Subject Line 
!
!
In email marketing, your subject line is your first impression. If you don’t take the time to write compelling 
subject lines, your emails flop. That’s just the way it is. It doesn’t matter how good, or compelling, or persuasive 
you think the email you wrote is—if your subject line stinks, no one will ever see it. If you want to learn how to 
write better subject lines for your emails, you have to be willing to run A/B subject line tests for every single email 
you ever send out to your list. It’s the only way to increase open rates and ensure that more people are actually 
opening and reading your emails. Thankfully, it’s pretty easy to do. 
Examples of Use

Here are a few real-world examples of subject line A/B tests:

subject lines, it’s helpful to learn about best practices and common strategies.   
!
Step 2: If you’re already sending out emails on a regular basis, see if the email client you use has the functionality 
for you to run A/B tests on your subject lines. If the option doesn’t exist, consider moving to another provider.  
!
Step 3: Learn how to set up the A/B test and run it on the next email you send out. Spend time reviewing the 
results so you can get a better idea of what kind of copy converts better. This will help you continue to make 
improvements to your subject lines over time.

The Social Integration Technique 
!
!
As a business owner, you can’t afford to ignore social media. Thanks to sites like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and 
hundreds of others, people are more connected with each other than ever before in history. To successfully launch 
and grow a business today, you have to participate. But if you really want to differentiate from competitors and 
boost conversions, you have to also take the time to ingrate social media into your website. The goal of social 
integration is to make it possible (and easy) for your website visitors to continue interacting with their 
communities while they spend time doing things like reading your content or learning about your products.

easy for visitors to log into your site or leave comments using their Facebook accounts.

assistance from a developer in order to successfully implement the tools on your site.

The Exclusive Interview Blog Post 
!
!
In Tip #17, we gave you an outreach strategy for getting guest posts. As mentioned, it’s a great way to start 
building brand buzz and credibility for yourself. Tip #38 is also an outreach strategy that involves working with 
other people in your industry, but it’s a little different. For the Exclusive Interview Blog Post, you’re not reaching 
out to others in an attempt to publish a guest post on their blog. Instead, you’re reaching out to top industry 
influencers and including them in a Q&A style post on your own blog. It’s another technique that you can use to 
show your prospects that you know the right people. It’s also a chance for you to bring new traffic to your website.

Buzzsumo to find people who have an active presence and following on social media. With Buzzsumo, you can 
also see how likely a person is to respond to people on Twitter, which can give you an idea of how likely they 
might be to respond to a request from you.  
!
Step 2: Once you have your list, start collecting email addresses. There’s really no trick for finding an email 
address. You just have to use Google to try to hunt it down. Check places like their social media profiles, their 
website, or their past company press releases.  
!
Step 3: Send out your request email. Make it brief. Introduce yourself and ask them if you could interview them 
for your blog. Pitch a topic. If they bite, follow up with questions, or set up a time to talk to them on video.

The Exit Intent Pop-Up 
!
!
You might be implementing all the right strategies needed in order to boost web traffic and get people to your 
website, but it’s not much use if you can’t convince them to buy from you once they get there. One technique 
that’s been steadily growing in popularity over the last few years is what’s known as the Exit Intent Pop-Up. It’s 
likely that you see these all the time when you’re visiting new sites. They are the message boxes that pop up as 
soon as you decide it’s time to leave a website. A lot of business owners are afraid to use them because of how 
forceful and annoying they can sometimes be, but at the end of the day, smart business owners get over it because 
of how effective they are in boosting conversions.

studies on the website of the tool you ended up choosing, or just search Google. There are plenty of examples out 
there that you can learn from. In general, the goal is to write copy that is somewhat forceful—without sounding 
rude. You’ll see what we mean when you look for examples of these on other sites.

The Industry Trade Show Brand Boost 
!
!
To build a successful business today, you have to have a strong online presence. You have to invest in strategies 
that can help you connect with and convert more people who are looking for solutions to their problems—
solutions your business can provide. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore growth opportunities that exist in

The Niche-Focused Blog Strategy 
!
!
You can’t blog just for the sake of blogging, or because someone told you that’s what you’re supposed to do. You 
have to have an intentional strategy in place in order for blogging to help your business in any way. If you’re in 
the early stages of blogging for your business, or if you’ve been blogging for a while but still haven’t seen much 
traction, consider implementing what we call the Niche-Focused Blog Strategy. The Niche-Focused Blog Strategy 
works like this: instead of writing boring blog posts about your company, or generic posts that look like every 
other blog post from other businesses in your industry, do something different. Think bigger. Create a niche-
specific blog that a very focused group of people will come to see and use as a resource to improve their lives.
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Niche-Focused blogs:  
!
• Mint 
• Movoto 
• Honest
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: The first thing you need to do is review the 3 examples above. Then, read through the 2 case studies we’ve 
linked to below. These resources and case studies will help you gain a better understanding of what niche blogs 
actually are and why they work so well.  
!
Step 2: Next, think about the people you are trying to reach. Who are they? What do they need help with? Use 
this information to come up with a new focus for your blog. Try to be ultra-specific. When it comes to blogging, 
broad topics don’t work. People want specifics. Decide on your focus and come up with your first 10 post ideas. 
!
Step 3: Find a better blog theme for your website on Themeforest. Pick one that looks different than all the other 
blogs you see on company websites. Hire someone to help you install your theme and make sure to design it in a 
way so that it’s consistent with your brand. The first post you publish should describe the new focus of your blog.

The Twitter Chat 
!
!
If you’re still fairly new to Twitter, you might feel like all you ever see is noise. Knowing how or who or when to 
engage with people on Twitter can be difficult. Twitter can be a great lead generation and growth tool—but you 
have to know how to use it. If all you’re doing on Twitter is publishing tweets day after day and you never try 
anything different, you’re not going to get anything out of it. It’s going to be a giant waste of your time and 
energy. If you want to test something new, try organizing a Twitter Chat. Twitter chats are great for reaching 
qualified leads and strengthening your reputation in an industry, as well as the reputation of your company. The 
best part is, they are free to organize—you don’t have to spend a penny. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of Twitter Chats:  
!
• The Twitter Chat From Brian Honigman 
• The Twitter Chat From HubSpot 
• The Twitter Chat From AIA

has to be interesting enough to grab the attention of not only users, but also guests.  
!
Step 2: Create a simple landing page or publish a blog post that describes your Twitter chat. Look at the examples 
provided above if you need help. Next, reach out to a few business partners or influencers in your industry who 
might be willing to be interviewed by you on your first Twitter chat. Pick a time, date, and unique hashtag to use.  
!
Step 3: Once someone agrees to host with you, come up with engaging questions to ask them.  Start getting the 
word out about your upcoming Twitter chat, and make sure people know that you want them to engage and chime 
in during the Twitter chat. When your first Twitter chat is over, use Storify to build a recap of the discussion. Add 
your recap to your landing page or blog posts as an example of what people can expect.

The Testimonials Strategy  
!
!
Despite what some may tell you, testimonials are still powerful tools that can be used to influence purchasing 
behavior on your website. As mentioned before, you can talk about how great your business is all day long if you 
wanted to, but at the end of the day, prospects want to hear from other people. Real people who use or have used 
your products. With that in mind, you need to be proactive when it comes to gathering and sharing the great 
things that people say about you and your company. The Testimonials Strategy is simple: put together a process 
for collecting testimonials, and create a place (or places) on your website to feature them. When you display 
testimonials and case studies on your website, it helps boost confidence among your prospects.
Examples of Use

• Testimonials on ZenPayroll (Source: ZenPayroll) 
• Case Studies From KISSmetrics

your company and products helped certain people succeed in a big way, ask them to work with you to develop a 
case study.   
!
Step 2: After you have your first batch of testimonials and case studies, decide where you want them to live on 
your website. A few good places to consider: your homepage, your product pages, and your About page.  
!
Step 3: Automate the testimonial gathering process as much as possible by using one of the recommended tools 
below. Continue adding great testimonials and case studies to various sections and pages of your website.

The Online Reviews Request 
!
!
Like testimonials, reviews are also great tools to use when you need to combat any fears or objections your 
prospects might think of when deciding whether or not to do business with you. If you own a local brick-and-
mortar business, reviews can really help bring new traffic through your doors. If you own a SaaS business or some 
other type of business that operates primary online, reviews are also important. One mistake a lot of business 
owners make is that they don’t ever think to actually ask people to write reviews—they just assume it will happen 
naturally. And sometimes it does. But smart business owners don’t wait for people to leave reviews. They ask 
them.
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of online review requests:  
!
• An Online Review Request Page From a Dental Office 
• An Online Review Request Page From a Carpet Cleaning Business 
• A Blog Review Post of XERO
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Make a list of happy customers that you can reach out to. Additionally, you can also create a list of 
influential bloggers who might be willing to review your products or services. 
!
Step 2: If you haven’t already, you need to set up profiles for sites that people can go to when they’re ready to 
leave you a review. For brick-and-mortar businesses, use Moz Local. For SaaS businesses, make sure you get listed 
on sites like GetApp.  
!
Step 3: Create a page on your website that you can send people to when they agree to write you a review. See 
above for examples. Reach out to people on your lists and see who is willing to leave you a review. You decide 
whether or not you want to create an incentive or reward for people as a way to encourage them to participate. 
Include a link to your new “leave us a review” page in your email signature.

The Promotion Swap 
!
!
As mentioned back in Tip #14, you should make it a rule to never create content that you aren’t sure you’ll be able 
to promote. There are a lot of content promotion strategies that you can implement in order to bring more people 
to your website. One of our favorite strategies is what we call The Promotion Swap. It’s pretty simple. The 
Promotion Swap is basically an informal agreement that you make with another company or partner to share each 
other’s content when it makes sense to do so. It’s a great way to build social partnerships with companies and 
like-minded business owners who want the same thing that you want: to build brand awareness, increase web 
traffic, and ultimately grow their businesses. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of promotion swaps:  
!
• The Tweet From TinyHR 
• The When I Work / Gryffin Promotion Swap (1 of 2) 
• The When I Work / Gryffin Promotion Swap (2 of 2)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: The first thing you need to do is decide who you want to reach out to. You should look for companies that 
have a similar customer base as you, and ones that have a decent following on sites like Facebook and Twitter. 
!
Step 2: The next step is to reach out to the people you put on your list, but first—consider implementing part of 
the strategy we outlined back in Tip #17: mention the people or companies you want to reach out to in a blog 
post. Then surprise them with the link when it comes time to ask them for help with promoting your content.  
!
Step 3: Send your outreach emails. Tell them that you mentioned them in your blog post, that you’re a fan of their 
content, and ask them if they’d be interested in working together to promote each other’s content from time to 
time. If they agree, follow up by sending them a list of your top 5 posts and ask them to reply with their list. Find a 
place for their posts in your social media publishing schedule and @ mention them whenever possible.

The Marketing Partnership Strategy 
!
!
Asking another business owner or company to help promote your content is a great way to earn a quick win for 
your company, but there’s a lot more you can and should do when it comes to partnering with other businesses. If 
you want to grow your business and get in front of prospects that you haven’t engaged with before, one great way 
to do it is by establishing a more formalized marketing partnership with a company or a handful of companies 
that have a smilier audience or user base as yours. If you want to test the waters a bit with marketing 
partnerships, a good place to start is by creating and publishing a piece of content with another company.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of marketing partnerships:  
!
• The Co-Hosted Webinar Example 
• The Co-Branded Infographic 
• The Co-Branded Video
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: As you did in the previous step, make a list of potential partners that you’d like to reach out to. The 
companies you pick should have an active online presence, a strong email list, and customers that you can benefit 
from gaining access to.  
!
Step 2: Reach out to the companies on your list and see if any of them would be interested in launching a co-
branded content marketing campaign with you. Let them know you’re interested in creating a piece of content 
together (like a video, an infographic, an ebook, a webinar, etc.). If desired, you can also pitch them some ideas.  
!
Step 3: Move forward with interested parties. Divvy up the work that needs to be done and split the cost down the 
middle. Put together a promotion plan with your partner, finalize your piece of content, publish it, and start the 
promotion phase.

The Stayin’ Alive Content Strategy 
!
!
Content marketing is a necessity when it comes to connecting with more people online, building brand 
awareness, and growing your startup. If you want to get more out of the content you produce for your blog, 
consider taking the time to repurpose your best posts into other forms of content that you can publish on other 
sites. This is what we call the Stayin’ Alive Content Strategy. It’s a fairly common content marketing strategy that 
can help extend the life of your best content, give you more bang for your buck, and also share your value with 
new audiences.   
Examples of Use 
!
Here are some ideas of content repurposing: 
!
• The Coschedule Blog Post & Slideshare Presentation 
• The Buffer Blog Post and YouTube Video 
• When I Work Blog Post and Infographic
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Pick one of your best blog posts that you’ve published within the last six months. Use Google Analytics to 
find the one that got the highest page views.  
!
Step 2: Make a plan for repurposing the blog post into at least 3 new pieces of content. For ideas, take a look at 
the recommended reading articles below. If you’re planning on making visuals, a slideshow presentation, or an 
infographic, use one of the recommended tools listed below.  
!

The Co-Branded Infographic 
!
!
You might have noticed that we mentioned the Co-Branded Infographic briefly in Tip #48, but it’s such an 
effective and simple tip to implement that we felt it was worth spending some additional time on. Infographics 
are particularly powerful pieces of content for 3 reasons: First, they are visual. Second, they are embeddable. And 
third, people love sharing them. And all in all, they really aren’t that expensive to produce. So, if you’re thinking 
about giving the whole content partnerships strategy a try, we recommend that you start by co-creating an 
infographic.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of co-branded infographics:  
!
• The Infographic From Nameberry & Pishposh 
• The Infographic From 5 Wedding Vendors 
• The Infographic From Vidyard and MarketingProfs
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Use the Google Keyword Planner Tool to perform some keyword research in an effort to come up with the 
right topic. Pitch your infographic idea to another company that you’d like to work with. If they like the idea, 
move forward with the project by working together to create an outline for your infographic. Keep in mind: your 
infographic should tell a story. It should include supporting data and research, but in order for it to do well, it has 
to tell a story. 
!
Step 2: Create your infographic by using one of the recommended tools below. Alternatively, you could hire a 
freelance designer to help you create your infographic. Depending on their experience and skill-level, you may be 
able to spend less than what you’d spend using one of the mentioned tools.  
!
Step 3: Work with your partner to put together a promotion plan for your infographic, then launch when ready!

The Inactive Users Email 
!
!
How many times have you signed up for a new app or service and then forgot about it or lost interest? If you’re 
like us, it’s probably more times than you can count. It’s a common issue that nearly every SaaS or app company 
has to deal with: inactive users. One of the most direct ways you can communicate with any users who sign up for 
your app is by sending them emails. If you’re fed up with inactive users, try sending them enticing engagement-
driven emails as a way to get them to start using your app or service again.  
!
Examples of Use

The Animated GIF Tutorial 
!
!
Thanks to sites like Buzzfeed, Mashable, Upworthy, and others, GIFs are all the rage these days. If you aren’t 
familiar with them,  a GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a type of animated image.  Perhaps because of their 
growing popularity among web users, more and more savvy startups have started creating and using them to 
onboard users and as education tools. If you’re looking for ways to beef up your onboarding process or make user 
education a little more interesting, try making a few Animated GIF Tutorials that explain how your product works.  
!
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of GIF tutorials:  
!
• A Tutorial GIF from When I Work 
• The Tutorial GIF From Intercom 
• The Tutorial GIF From User App
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Start thinking about what processes or features you can make GIFs for. For example, do you regularly get 
the same question over and over again from users in regards to how a particular feature works? Or do you have a 
new feature that you’re in the process of rolling out? Creating GIFs that address these two scenarios could help 
provide clarity for your users and save you tons of time.  If you need a little inspiration, take a look at the 3 
examples above to see how other companies are using GIFs.  
!
Step 2: Create your GIF. If you want to keep things really simple, use Record It. It’s incredibly easy to use. If you 
have more experience with Photoshop, feel free to use that to make your GIF instead.  
!
Step 3: Decide where you want to put it. For example, you could put it somewhere in your Help center, include it 
in one of your onboarding emails, or send it to individuals who reach out to you for help on Facebook and Twitter.

The Timely Piggyback Social Media Post 
!
!
One of the best and easiest ways to get your social media followers talking is by taking the opportunity to chime 
in whenever you see popular or timely topics being covered in the news or written about on other pop culture 
sites like Buzzfeed. It’s what we like to call the Timely Piggyback Social Media Post. These are types of posts you 
publish during the Super Bowl, on the day that a new big blockbuster comes out, or when the weather is doing 
something it hasn’t done in 25 years. They’re effective in boosting engagement because they piggyback off topics 
that everyone cares about.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of piggyback posts:  
!
• The Tweet From Johnson & Johnson (Source: Social Media Explorer) 
• The Facebook Post From Warby Parker (Source: Social Media Explorer)

Step 1: Take a look at the Major Holidays article we included in the recommended reading section below. If you 
have a social media publishing calendar that you use, go through the holiday list and make notes about the ones 
you want to make sure to post something about when the day comes. Think about other upcoming events that you 
can talk to your social media followers about. You can also become more aware of timely post opportunities by 
using a tool like Buzzsumo to set up alerts for specific topics.  
!
Step 2: When it comes time to chime in on a topic, use Hootsuite to track and participate in conversations on 
Twitter. You can also use tools like Canva or PowerPoint to quickly create funny or entertaining graphics to share 
with people.

The Countdown Urgency Conversion Technique

Online shopping has made it easier for consumers to talk themselves out of making purchases. Without store 
owners and salespeople breathing down their necks, there’s no pressure. It’s a problem that a lot of companies 
deal with. One great way to motivate your prospects to take action is by creating a sense of urgency. It’s a trick 
that companies like Amazon and Groupon have perfected over the years, and as a result, their growth continues to 
skyrocket day after day. You can easily create a sense of urgency on your own website by building a countdown 
timer and using it in areas where conversion is low.

The Gamification Engagement Method 
!
!
Everyone loves being rewarded or recognized for doing the right things. As a business owner, you can take 
advantage of this truth and use it to grow your business. How? By implementing the Gamification Engagement 
Method. Gamification is a pretty simple concept, but it can be incredibly effective when it comes to getting your 
users and customers to do what they need to do in order to be successful and get the most out of your products. 
Gamification works like this: you show a user how to perform an action, or you give them a list of actions to 
complete, the user completes the action, then you give them a reward. Pretty straightforward, right? If you’re 
looking for more ways to get your customers to take action, try making the process a little more fun. 
Examples of Use

to drive engagement and action. Think about what you need users to do in order to be successful.

product. If you don’t have an internal team yet, reach out to someone on oDesk for help.

Step 3: Test the gamification on a small batch of people before pushing it live for your entire user base. Work out 
any kinks and see if what you create makes sense to people. Ask for feedback, make any final adjustments, then 
push it live. Once it’s live, it’s up to you to track how it’s impacting engagement and activity.

The Rare CEO/Owner/Founder Email 
!
!
When your startup was brand new, it probably made a lot of sense to communicate with prospects and clients 
directly—especially if you were your only employee at the time. But as your business continues to grow and you 
hire more people to help you with all the tasks you used to manage on your own, you should consider phasing 
yourself out of most of the direct communication that happens with clients. There are, of course, exceptions that 
should be made from time to time—like when your biggest client is waiting on the other line—but if possible, try 
your hardest to only communicate with customers and prospects when you really want or need them to listen.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are some good times to use the Rare CEO Founder Email Strategy: 
!
• When you really want feedback from customers 
• When you’re making big changes to your company or products 
• When you want to celebrate a company milestone or welcome a new customer 
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Put one of your employees in charge of all client communication. Your goal is to phase yourself out so 
that your customers become accustomed to only hearing from you when you have something really important to 
tell them, when you need their help, or when you want to welcome them or show them your appreciation.  
!
Step 2: Re-train your customers and help them understand who their new point of contact is. If your company is 
still small, set up an introduction call with each client and whoever you put in charge of client communication. 
!
Step 3: Begin your new phase of only reaching out to people for select occasions. It’s simple, but it’s a great way 
to boost engagement, build trust throughout your team, and get the focused attention of your customers when 
you need to.

The Visible Phone Number Hack

!
With so many other great ways to communicate with customers these days, it can be tempting to hide your 
company’s phone number from prospects and customers, or even get rid of your office phones all together. But 
you’d be surprised to learn how many SaaS and online companies are putting phone numbers back on their 
websites. Why? Because as it turns out, talking to people on the phone can be a pretty effective way to boost 
conversions. If your numbers weren’t where they needed to be last quarter and you’re looking for a much-needed 
boost, give the Visible Phone Number Hack a try.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Visible Phone Number Hack:  
!
• The LessAccounting Case Study 
• The Case Study From Flowr 
• The Visible Phone Number From Groove (Source: Groove)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Before flipping the listed phone number switch back on, make sure you have enough team members to 
manage calls. If needed, give them a training session on how to speak with customers on the phone, and purchase

are put into one of three buckets: the Promoters, the Passives, and the Detractors. The test is meant to teach you 
more about your customers and your company. It’s a simple tool for fueling future growth.

The Timely Holiday Offer 
!
!
One of the best times to send emails to your users is during the holidays. It’s true that on holidays your users are 
probably get inundated with emails, but a lot of people don’t actually mind that much. In fact, they look forward 
to the opportunity to take advantage of the special offers they know companies send out. It’s the same reason why 
people still go out and shop in stores on Black Friday. They know it will be madness, but the special deals make it 
worth it. If you want to boost conversions over the next big holiday, try sending out a Timely Holiday Offer.  
!
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few best times of year to send out offers: 
!
• The Offer Email From 500px (Source: VERO) 
• The Offer Email From Amazon (Source: VERO) 
• The Offer Email From ebay  (Source: VERO)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: The first thing you need to do is decide what you want to offer. For ideas, take a look at the 3 examples we 
provide above. 
!
Step 2: Once you’ve decided on your offer, design your campaign in your email client. In order for your holiday 
offer to be successful, you need to take the time to theme your email to coincide with whatever holiday you plan 
to send it out over. Work with a designer to create some original graphics for your campaign to spice things up 
even more.  
!
Step 3: Send your email out and see how it impacts your conversions. If it works, look for the next opportunity to 
send a similar email out—just be careful not to overdo it. Your offers will be less enticing the more often they are 
presented.

team, but you might not be as skilled as you wish you were in perfuming keyword research on your own. This tip,

The UGC Growth Strategy 
!
!
One of the best ways to spark engagement and reach new audiences on social media sites like Facebook and 
Twitter is by creating user-generated content campaigns. User-generated content is content produced and shared 
by your followers, customers, or prospects. Most companies run these types of campaigns for three reasons: (1) 
because they help strengthen brand reputation, (2) because they do a great job of illustrating brand loyalty, and 
(3) because once they are set up, they don’t require a lot of ongoing management. 
!
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of UCG Campaigns:  
!
• The Warby Parker Home Try-On Campaign 
• The Starbucks White Cup Contest  
• The Lululemon #thesweatlife Campaign
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Decide what kind of UGC campaign you want to launch on your social media sites. For this campaign to 
work, you really have to think about who your customers are. Your products should be the primary focus of your 
UGC campaign. To get an idea of what other companies are doing, take a look at the examples above.  
!
Step 2: Once you’ve come up with your UGC campaign idea, start spreading the word. You can take the time to 
create a dedicated landing page for your campaign if you want (see the Lululemon example), or you can just run 
your contest on Twitter (see the Warby Parker example). It just depends on how much time and resources you 
have at your disposal.  
!
Step 3: To get things moving, reach out to a few of your best or most loyal customers and ask them if they’d be 
willing to participate. Once you get the ball rolling, things should start picking up.

The Value-Based Video Series

Remember back in Tip #50 when we wrote about repurposing your best blog posts into other forms of content 
that you can publish on other sites? If you’re ready to put that tip into action, consider pairing it with this tip—
The Value-Based Video Series. To implement them together, all you have to do is find a blog post series that 
you’ve published in the past and repurpose the content into a series of educational videos to share on YouTube. 
The Value-Based Video Series is a strategy that can be used when you want to build up your credibility and 
connect with prospective customers who are actively looking for answers to their problems. 
Examples of Use

The Niche-Focused Forum Participation Technique 
!
!
If you want to connect with more like-minded people who can help you grow your business, try finding a niche-
focused forum to participate in. If you were to ask the average business owner where to spend time engaging with 
others online, he or she would probably mention Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. It’s unlikely that forums would 
be included in the list. But forums can be great places to go to when you want to exchange ideas with others, get 
honest feedback about your products,  network with people, learn new skills, and find more customers. 
!
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of niche forums:  
!
• Reddit Small Business 
• Quora Startups 
• Reddit Startups
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Look for forums to join by going to Google and typing [your topic] + forum in the search bar. You’ll get a 
lot of results and some will look better than others. Spend time navigating around discussion boards to decide 
whether or not it’s a good fit. You can also take a look at more popular and well-established forum community 
sites like Reddit and Quora when trying to decide which forum you want to participate in.  
!
Step 2: When you find a forum that peaks your interest, try to find an “introductions” topic so that you can start 
things off by telling people a little about yourself and your company.  
!
Step 3: Try to participate in discussions at least once per week. Then bump it up to twice a week. Then three 
times a week. The more time you can spend interacting with other people, the more credibility you’ll build.

The Helping Hand Hack 
!
!
Each customer will experience your product differently. A few customers will instantly understand your product 
and the rest will need help at different moments during their lifecycle. Instead of relying on support tickets to tell 
you when someone needs help, you can set up triggers in your app or website to alert you when problems arise 
and automatically reach out, before they ask.This is an easy way to boost conversions, reduce churn, and get 
customer feedback to help you optimize your website. Anytime a customer gets stuck during the sign up or 
payment process, you’re immediately there to help before they get the chance to leave. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the “Helping Hand” hack: 
!
• GrooveHQ 
• Kickstarter 
• Mailchimp 
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Identify moments when a customer or prospect is having trouble or confused (i.e. starting to use a feature 
but not finishing, looking at a support, FAQ, or pricing page,or not logging in for a while). You can reach out to 
customers and review support requests to identify these problem areas. 
!
Step 2: Setup lifecycle messages (email, text messages, website notifications, handwritten notes, etc,) using the 
recommended tools. Use the website events and user behaviors you identified in the previous step as problem 
areas to automatically send out targeted messages to customers. 
!
Step 3: Write messages that guide the customer through the exact problem they’re having. Try to use plain text, 
write conversationally, and include specific user details like their name to encourage replies and boost 
conversions.

you’re able to create and publish high-quality content for your blog, and at the same time, you’re able to use the 
posts as a way to answer everybody’s questions all at once. It’s a win-win for your business. And because the 
series is all about your business and products,  it’s some of the easiest content you’ll ever have to create.

How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Make a list of the top 50 FAQ’s you get from people about your business or your products. If possible, try 
to chunk similar questions into groups of 10. If you can’t come up with 50, get more by reaching out to your 
customers and followers on Twitter, sending out emails, and asking people over the phone.  
!
Step 2: Once you have your list of FAQs and you’ve chunked them into groups of 10, you’re ready to start writing. 
You’ll write a total of 5 blog posts for your series—one post for every group of 10 questions.  
!
Step 3: Finish writing your first post and hit publish when ready. Publish one post a week until you’ve answered 
all of the 50 questions. Promote the content on social media, and put a link to the post in your Help center or 
somewhere else on your website for people to find. Keep the link handy in case you ever have to email it to 
someone on the fly.

whenever and wherever possible. It seems like a simple concept, but you’d be surprised to know how many 
startups never take the steps to do something as simple as using a person’s first name in an email. But addressing 
people by their first names isn’t the only way you can make your users and prospects feel more comfortable when 
they’re interacting with your business. You can also personalize the experience your visitors have when they land 
on your website or use your app.

minutes, even when you’re on vacation. FOMO is the uneasy feeling you get when you feel like you might be

media, and in your email marketing campaigns. To add an extra layer of urgency to your email, consider adding a

to your free t-shirt form that you implemented after reading the first tip in this book? What about  link to your 
company’s explainer video? These are all ways you can engage with users and prospects in an effort to move them 
down the conversion funnel.

The Endorsement From a Well-Known Hero 
!
!
As we mentioned in Tip #20, social proof can be an incredibly powerful tool when it comes to influencing 
purchasing decisions. Social proof usually comes from business data, like amount of customers, number of sales, 
and the companies and partners you work with, but social proof can also come from other places. Some 
companies, for example, attempt to build brand awareness and boost confidence by getting endorsements from 
well-known celebrities or industry leaders. Surprisingly, even a simple endorsement from a celebrity can be pretty 
effective when it comes to converting more prospects online.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of celebrity endorsements:  
!
• The Neff Example (Source: ConversionXL) 
• The Seth Godin Example (Source: ConversionXL) 
• The Priceline Example (Source: ConversionXL)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Your first step is to decide if you even want to reach out to a celebrity in an attempt to get them to 
endorse your products or business. To come to a decision, you’ll have to think about who your customers and 
prospects are and what matters to them. Would seeing one of their heroes on your website influence their 
decision to buy from you in any way? If you don’t think you customers would care, table this tip for another time.  
!
Step 2: If you do think your customers would care, your next step is to make a list of celebrities you want to reach 
out to. You should categorize them into an A list, a B list, and a C list. Your A-listers are your heroes. Your B and 
C-listers are still pretty great, but they are also a little more accessible than the people at the top of your list.  
!
Step 3: Make a plan to reach out to the celebrities you pick. If they have a website, they probably have a media 
contact you can reach out to. Make a strong pitch and see if anyone on your list bites.

The PR Push Outreach & Pitch Strategy 
!
!
When you’re in the process of growing your business, you have to take any press you can get in an effort to build 
brand awareness and start connecting with qualified leads. Unfortunately, there’s about a million other startup 
owners just like you who are all battling for the attention of journalists and bloggers who might be willing to write 
a story about their business. Competition for attention is fierce, and the people you want to cover your startup 
usually don’t have a lot of extra time on their hands. The PR Push Outreach & Pitch Strategy can help you find 
the right people to cover your startup news.  
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few scenarios that you would use this strategy for: 
!
• When you’re preparing to launch new products 
• When you’re preparing to announce a new major partnership  
• When your company is doing something really awesome and meaningful for others 
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Find journalists and bloggers who cover your niche. You can use a tool like MuckRack, but it’s pretty 
expensive. If you’re still trying to keep things pretty lean, we recommend you use Buzzsumo to find the right 
people. Make a list of reporters and bloggers that you’d like to reach out to.  
!
Step 2: Come up with the pitch you want to send to the people on your list. It’s important that you pitch stories 
and not your products, even if it is your products that you want them to write about.  
!
Step 3: Send individual, personalized emails to each person. Don’t send a bulk email, and don’t attach a press 
release. Just introduce yourself and be brief. If anyone bites, you can send them more information in your follow-
up email. If you’re targeting a pretty big list, you can use Streak to send out your emails.

The Blog RSS Email 
!
!
You might be blogging for your business, but are you actively working to build a list of email subscribers that you 
can send new content to on a regular basis? If not, you need to get started. In a lot of cases, the people who read 
your blog posts are also the same people who could benefit from using your products. When you take the time to 
set up a way for people to subscribe to your blog updates, you set yourself and your company up for future growth. 
The New Blog Post Email is a pretty quick and simple strategy to implement. But if you can get people to the point 
where they are comfortable receiving regular messages from you in their inbox, you’ll have a much easier time 
building trust and transforming them from passive readers into loyal customers. 
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the New Blog Post Email:  
!
• The Blog Post Email From Buffer (Source: VERO) 
• The Blog Post Email From CoSchedule (Source: VERO) 
• The Blog Post Email From Help Scout (Source: VERO)
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: The first step you need to take is go into your email client and design the RSS email template that you 
want to use for every new post you publish on your blog.  
!
Step 2: Once you have that in place, you’ll want to create an opt-form to place in various locations on your 
website. You should definitely add it to your blog, but also consider adding it on one of your highest visited non-
blog website pages. You could also build an entirely separate blog subscription landing page that offers 
information to visitors on why they should sign up and what to expect.  
!
Step 3: Once you have everything in place, start spreading the word and sending traffic to your rss opt-in forms.

We’ve spent a good amount of time talking about landing page optimization in this book, and it’s because it’s an 
essential skill that you have to learn to master as the founder of a startup. With that in mind, get ready for 
another landing-page focused tip. For this tip, we want to help you recognize the value of your About page. Most 
business About pages on the web look pretty similar to one another. They usually include some combination of a 
paragraph or two about the company,  a mission statement, and if you’re lucky, some actual photos of the people 
who work there! We want to encourage you to make something better for your website: An About page that 
actually converts.

prospects to convert. Some ideas include your story, some powerful social proof statements, some testimonials, 
some pictures of your team, some strategic messaging targeted toward your prospects, and most importantly, a 
CTA button or opt-in form .  
!

The 1-2-3 Onboarding Email 
!
!
You only have one chance to make a solid first impression when it comes to welcome emails. It’s your chance to 
start things off on the right foot by giving your users what they need in order to get the most out of your app or 
software. If you haven’t quite decided what you want the first email you send to a new user to say, we recommend 
using what our friend Jimmy Daly calls the 1-2-3 Method. Your welcome email should be relatively simple and to 
the point. The 1-2-3 Method can help you craft and email that stays true to those goals.

with long and short term engagement. For example, you might know that your users need to fill out their profiles 
right away in order to be successful. If that is the case, your 1-2-3 Onboarding email should focus on helping them 
achieve that specific task and nothing else.  
!
Step 2: Make a decision about what 3 steps or chunks of information you want to include in your welcome email. 
Remember to keep it as simple as possible. You can always send them a follow up email with more information 
down the road. If you need some inspiration, look at the examples provided above.

The “Aha! Moment” Optimization Phase

Moment. An Aha! Moment is when your value proposition finally clicks for your users. The point at which Aha! 
moments happen are different for every company. If you want to grow your business and convert more users, you

people to experience it.

really love and appreciate getting to filter through and analyze all the data that you’re collecting at any given 
time on your website. If you’re looking for a new A/B test to run, look to your sign up forms. If your sign up form

The Upgrade Offer

If you own and operate a SaaS business, one of the jobs you have to take on from time to time is figuring out how 
to motivate your users to upgrade. One great way to do so is by sending them an upgrade offer email. In order for 
your users to be willing to upgrade, they have to trust you, and they have to believe that your product is valuable 
enough to invest in. You can persuade them in your email by making sure you write compelling copy that 
converts, include some social proof to boost confidence, and of course, include links that send people directly to

The Win-Back Email 
!
!
If your business is like a lot of businesses out there, you probably have contact information stored somewhere for 
customers who—for whatever reason—chose to stop buying your products or doing business with you. Some 
companies never do anything with this list. But smart business owners realize the opportunity that still exists 
with this group of people. They know that in a lot of cases, it’s easier to sell to people who are already familiar 
with their business and products than it is to convert someone new. Enter the Win-Back Email. It’s your chance to 
reach back out to former customers and convince them that they still need you.   
Examples of Use 
!
Here are a few real-world examples of the Win-Back Email:  
!
• The Verizon Win-Back Email 
• The Groove Win-Back Email  
• The Netflix Win-Back Email 
How To Implement This Tip 
!
Step 1: Identify, or segment, the people that you want to reach out to. Start with customers who have canceled or 
stopped doing business with you sometime within the last 60-120 days.  
!
Step 2: Craft your email. To make it as lean as possible, go plain-text. You can always add the bells and whistles 
later. You can send your email manually, or use one of the automation tools we list below. You’ll have the best 
chance of persuading your former customers to come back aboard if in the email you (1) highlight any new 
features you’ve added, (2) give them a special offer, (3) include a strong CTA (call-to-action).  
!
Step 3: Send the email off, see if anyone bites, and make adjustments accordingly based on the results you see.
