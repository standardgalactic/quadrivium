About the Authors
Dr. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher has taught Biblical Studies and Peace
Studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles for 20 years. 
He received his Master of Divinity from Associated Mennonite Biblical
Seminary in 1981 and his Doctor of Philosophy in Biblical Theology from
Oxford University in 1986. He has published several books and articles 
in Biblical Studies and Peace Studies, including Jonah, Jesus, and Other 
Good Coyotes: Speaking Peace to Power in the Bible; Introduction to the Old
Testament: Our Call to Faith and Justice; and A Biblical Theology of Exile.
Dr. Smith-Christopher lectures widely in churches and parishes throughout
the United States and abroad and also appears frequently on documentary
television programs dealing with biblical themes on A&E, the History
Channel, and the National Geographic Channel.
Dr. Smith-Christopher has the interesting job of being a Protestant (Quaker)
Bible teacher at a Roman Catholic university, which means that he works
across different Christian traditions. He enjoys diverse viewpoints and 
perspectives, and when it comes to “non-canonical” books, diversity is the
name of the game!
Stephen Spignesi is a bestselling author, editor, screenwriter, and university
instructor. He has written 42 nonfiction books and one novel, Dialogues
(Random House). He is coauthor of several For Dummies books, including
Second Homes For Dummies and Native American History For Dummies. He’s
also the author of the recent George Washington’s Leadership Lessons (Wiley),
which he co-wrote with the Executive Director of Mount Vernon, James Rees.
He is a Practitioner in Residence at the University of New Haven where he
teaches writing. He also has several original screenplays in submission to
production companies and is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of the small-
press publishing company, The Stephen John Press. He lives in New Haven,
Connecticut, with his wife Pam and their intelligent, asthmatic cat Carter.


Dedications
From Daniel: This book is dedicated to Zsa Zsa, whom I married in 1992
because I’m no dummy!
From Stephen: I dedicate this book to the memory of my father, with love.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Daniel: This has been a very rewarding task, largely because of my tal-
ented cowriter Stephen, who transformed my often difficult (and occasionally
just plain bad) writing into something understandable. If there are still prob-
lems in this text, it has nothing to do with him — he had plenty of heavy lift-
ing with all the stuff he did catch! I would like to thank Chrissy Guthrie and
Elizabeth Rea for their always valuable and insightful questions and clarifica-
tions in the writing process, and a special thanks to Mike Lewis for giving me
the honor of writing this book. His insistence that I was the perfect author for
this project was flattering and humbling. You have my heartfelt gratitude,
Mike. Also, the entire editorial staff at Wiley have been tremendously helpful,
and I appreciate them very much. Finally, I have two important sets of folks
to mention: I feel deep appreciation to all my adult students in the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Diocese of San Bernardino, and the Diocese
of Las Vegas (yes, you, Fr. Joe and St. Anthonys!) who always kept me on my
toes and helped me to understand the importance of explaining things as
clearly as I could — you are no dummies! And lastly I want to acknowledge
the patience of my family as I worked on this project — love to Zsa Zsa, our
son Jordan, and our daughter Sydney.
From Stephen: First and foremost, I’d like to thank my coauthor Daniel for his
friendship, his good humor, and his talent and astonishing knowledge of bibli-
cal theology, which made working with him an absolute delight. Also, I must
thank our Acquisitions Editor Mike Lewis for his . . . well, for just about every-
thing. You’re a real paesan, brother. Also, mucho gratitude to our Senior
Project Editor Chrissy Guthrie and our Senior Copy Editor Elizabeth Rea for
their keen sense of what this book needed to be, and for their counsel and
questions that served to get it there! Also, personally, I’d like to thank my
agent and great friend John White, my inordinately helpful Teaching Assistant
Adrienne Candela, and my dearest friends Valerie, George, Jim, Charlie, and
Bob for their support and strong shoulders on which I have been known to
occasionally lean.

Introduction
T
he phrase “lost books of the Bible” is an oxymoron. If a book is really lost,
then how does anyone know about it? Good question, right? In some
cases, there are some genuinely “lost” books because historians and scholars
know the title and maybe a quotation here and there from other ancient
sources, but the writing itself isn’t available because it didn’t survive into the
modern world. However, if that were the only kind of writing covered in Lost
Books of the Bible For Dummies, it would be a very short book!
In most cases, of course, the lost books aren’t really lost; they’re simply
rarely read, forgotten, or only recently rediscovered. That is, the main sub-
ject of this book is the ancient Jewish and Christian religious writings that
didn’t end up in the Hebrew Bible (what many Jews refer to as the “TaNaK,”
an acronym from the Hebrew words for “Torah, Prophets, and Writings”), the
Christian Old Testament, or the Christian New Testament.
About This Book
If you’re intrigued by the idea that the Bible was a “selection” of writings and
that there were some writings “not selected,” then this book is for you!
In this book, we attempt to summarize most, if not all, of the religious writ-
ings that have survived from ancient Jewish and ancient Christian writers.
But if you want to know about those books not included in the Bible, then
you clearly won’t be satisfied with short summaries! So, this book is intended
to be your starting point on your journey of discovery. From here, you can go
to the various writings themselves (all available in English) and dig into them
for yourself.
Here’s what you can expect from this book:
 A basic introduction to the process that led to the formation of the
Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, and the New Testament
 A summary of most of the writings that are available for study and that
aren’t in the Bible

 An explanation of the differences among the available non-biblical writ-
ings, especially because some of them arguably came close to being
included while others were definitely less popular
 Suggestions of ways to understand some of the more difficult-to-read
writings
 Suggestions of how to start your own exploration of the world of non-
canonical writings
In short, this book starts you on a journey of discovery of lost books that
won’t be so “lost” when you finish!
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, we use the following general conventions that you should be
aware of:
 When we introduce a new term in a chapter, we italicize it.
 Keywords appear in boldface.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them stand
out from the rest of the text.
As well, some terms, abbreviations, and other elements of this book may be
confusing without some explanation, so the following sections clear up addi-
tional conventions used in this book.
“Canon” and “non-canonical”
The word “canon” comes from the Greek and typically refers to a set of mea-
surements, like a “ruler” or “yardstick.” But it also can refer to a set of mea-
surements used to reproduce a copy of something. When the early Christians
started using the term (sometime after 100 CE, it seems), it eventually came
to mean the “set list” of writings that were to be included in the Bible.
Problem is, people started using “canon” before lists were drawn up, so no
one is absolutely certain what the early Christians thought was their “canon”
until the first actual list of writings appeared around 367 CE.
All writings that didn’t make it into the canon of the Old or New Testaments
or the Hebrew Bible are therefore known as non-canonical writings. Bottom
line: This entire book is all about non-canonical writings! For a terrific resource

and Michael Homan (published by Wiley).
Dates: BCE and CE
Dates are always difficult to remember, but ancient dates can be downright
confusing! In this book, we use the following designations when referring to
the time before and after the beginning of Christianity.
 BCE: Before the Common Era (that is, before the beginning of Christianity)
 CE: The Common Era (after the beginning of Christianity)
These designations are the same as BC and AD, respectively, but BC and AD
are specifically Christian forms, whereas BCE and CE are more inclusive of
both Christians and Jews. What we today call Judaism was also taking shape
at about the same time as Christianity — Judaism and Christianity are both
descendants of ancient Hebrew religion, and they both went their own ways.
To recognize this fact, we refer to the “Common Era” (common between
Judaism and Christianity).
“Hebrew Bible” versus “Old Testament”
Although the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament are the same group of writ-
ings, “Hebrew Bible” is the label Jews prefer to use when speaking of their
Bible. The term “Old Testament” is the specifically Christian name for the
first section of the Christian Bible. Christians, of course, added the New
Testament writings to their Bible.
When we speak of the Old Testament in this book, we always keep in mind
that Roman Catholic, Orthodox (Greek, Russian, Coptic, and so on), and
Protestant Christians don’t entirely agree on the specific writings to be
included in their respective Old Testaments, but they do agree on the writ-
ings of the New Testament. You can find out more about these differences of
opinion in Chapter 2.
Translations
In this book, we cite from the best translations of non-canonical writings that
are available. In some cases, a few different translations are available, but we
3
Introduction

always go with the most recent, most scholarly translations available. The
appendix provides you with a list of all the books and studies we cite.
What You’re Not to Read
Believe it or not, this book does contain material that’s entirely skippable. 
We don’t mean to say that this material isn’t useful or interesting; we simply
mean that it isn’t critical to your understanding of the material in the chapter.
(Of course, we’d be flattered and honored if you read every single solitary
word we’ve written in this book, but we both live in the real world, so no guilt
if you don’t!)
Anyway, information marked with a Technical Stuff icon is, well, technical. It’s
a tad arcane, but provided for those of you who are interested in the minutiae
of ancient texts.
The sidebars, which appear in gray-shaded boxes, are full of interesting mate-
rial (at least we think so; it is our book, after all) that you don’t need to read
to understand the chapter but that will serve to enhance your enjoyment of
the chapter if you do.
So, to sum up, skip this stuff if you want, but a splendid time is guaranteed
for all who don’t!
Foolish Assumptions
In writing Lost Books of the Bible For Dummies, we made a number of assump-
tions about you, our reader. We assume that any or all of the following
descriptors may be true for you.
 You’re curious about ancient history.
 You’re interested in making discoveries for yourself.
 You’re fascinated with controversies in religious issues without being
threatened by that controversy.
 You’re willing to understand that not all ancient writings left out of the
Bible are therefore bad or even wrong — some of them may surprise you
with their beauty and wisdom!
 You’re patient in understanding that summaries are always inherently
unfair to the writing itself and serve only to whet your appetite and help
you choose the ones you want to take the time to read.

How This Book Is Organized
We organize this book into parts so that you can jump around to the informa-
tion you’re looking for, but you also can read it from beginning to end if that
suits your fancy. Here’s a look at the different parts that comprise this book.
Part I: Setting the Stage
Most people are shocked (shocked, we say!) to discover that, for Jews and
Christians both, the Bible didn’t take its final shape until about the third or
fourth century. What was the holdup? In this part, we examine how the Bible
emerged in its current forms for Christians and Jews, the two religions that
share major sections of the Bible. We also provide foundational information
on the various categories of religious writing. Understanding these categories
will help you to better understand the discussions that take place throughout
the book.
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books
In this part, we examine the pre-Christian Jewish writings that have survived
but aren’t in any of the Christian Old Testaments or the present Hebrew
Bible. What are these strange writings, and where did they come from? We
answer these questions, surveying lots of different writings, and we pay par-
ticular attention to the Dead Sea Scrolls, what’s known as the Apocrypha, and
to one very special lost book: the Book of Enoch.
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus
The Christian non-canonical writings that we cover in this part focus on the
person of Jesus. These include gospels and other sayings of Jesus as well 
as some types of writings about Jesus that weren’t included in the New
Testament.
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings
The New Testament features four “Gospels” about Jesus but then proceeds to
writings from and about the earliest followers of Jesus — the first Christians.
Many writings about these early Christians weren’t included in the New
Testament. There are gems to be found, and discoveries to be made! In this
5
Introduction

part, we start by covering writings from a rather strange group called the
“Gnostic Christians.” We then follow with chapters on Christian books that
almost made the cut, other apocalyptic writings, and legends about Paul and
other early Apostles of Jesus.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this traditional section of For Dummies books, we summarize some of the
“bottom-line” issues. For example, if time is tight and you want to read about
only the top ten Jewish and Christian books not in the Bible, start here at 
the back!
As a little bonus, we consider ten sayings of Jesus that don’t appear in the
New Testament and enjoy musing whether they’re genuine words from Jesus.
You also get our list of ten lost books that every student of the Bible should
be familiar with.
Finally, we include an appendix of additional resources in which we provide
the titles of most of the best English translations of the various non-canonical
writings of the ancient Jews and Christians, as well as some key reference
works. Enjoy!
Icons Used in This Book
All For Dummies books use graphic icons to call attention to key pieces of
information that we like you to pay particular attention to as you read. Here’s
a quick rundown of the icons used in this book and what they mean.
This icon points out useful pieces of biblical or historical info that will aid in
your understanding of the material being discussed.
This icon is attached to key themes, concepts, facts, or dates that you should
keep in mind and that may crop up again.
When you see this icon, watch out for things to be wary of, such as making
false assumptions about a topic or misinterpreting a commonly held belief in
a way that confuses rather than clarifies an issue.
This icon highlights details on translations, linguistic anomalies, geographical
specifics, and other nonthematic info that, nonetheless, is interesting and fun
to know.

Where to Go from Here
This book is written so that you can read each chapter on its own. However,
it makes sense to begin with Part I, which generally deals with questions
about how the Bible was formed, before you decide to skip around in the
chapters that summarize different kinds of writings. If you’re mainly inter-
ested in Jewish writings that aren’t in the Bible, then you want Part II. If
you’re interested in Christian books not in the Bible, then head to Parts III
and IV. What about Part V? Well, we confess that we had some fun with that
section because we got to create some unconventional lists.
Finally, if you find that you’re really into all this lost books stuff and want to
know more, you can check out some of the additional books and resources
we list in the appendix.

Part I
Setting the Stage

In this part . . .
T
his part starts by asking the obvious questions: 
How do books get “lost”? And if they’re lost, how 
does anyone know anything about them? We provide
some answers to these questions and discuss the very
important issue of forming a “canon” of the Bible — an
approved, “this is it, and no more” list. We also explore
the important (and frankly, controversial) question about
how the Bible came to be — both the Hebrew Bible (what
Christians call the Old Testament); and the Christian
Bible, which features both the Old Testament and the New
Testament. Finally, we include a chapter in this part that
gives you some tools to understand different styles of
ancient Jewish and Christian religious writing so that you
can better understand our discussions of various lost
books.

Chapter 1
How to Lose Books of the Bible: 
A Hands-On Guide
In This Chapter
 Understanding what “lost” really means
 Surveying the three greatest lost book discoveries
 Categorizing ancient religious writings
 Looking critically at the idea of lost books and their importance
L
et’s face it: the idea of “lost books” — no matter what the field — is tanta-
lizing and exciting. And when you combine the appeal of arcane writings
and “secret knowledge” with the Bible, well, the result is practically irresistible!
The idea of lost books suggests secrets to be discovered, information to be
gained, and surprises ahead. It also calls up romantic images of archaeolo-
gists uncovering long-lost manuscripts, blowing off the dust, and reading the
unexpected. (This is obviously one reason archaeologists are so romanti-
cized, even though most archaeologists hardly have lives like Indiana Jones!)
In this chapter, we discuss the general idea of lost books in relation to the
Bible and discuss some of the most spectacular discoveries of the 19th and
20th centuries in terms of ancient Jewish and Christian writings. We also talk
about the debates and processes that finally led to the Bible that exists
today, and the fact that most people think about two groups of writings when
they should be thinking about three. What we mean is that most folks think of
the writings that made it into the Bible and all the others that did not. But
there’s a third group that we call the “almost in” books. This is the especially
fascinating group that some Jews and Christians deeply treasured but that
still didn’t make the final cut!

What Do We Mean By “Lost Books 
of the Bible”?
“Lost books of the Bible” is certainly an intriguing phrase and an even more
intriguing concept. But what exactly does it mean? Are there really books out
there that were supposed to be in the Bible, but somehow got “lost” along the
way? Well, not really. By “lost books,” we actually mean a few different things.
Books that were always around, 
just unknown by most people
Literally dozens and dozens of writings from the time before Jesus, written by
different groups of ancient Jewish writers, weren’t included in the standard
collection of writings known as the Bible. But these writings were never actu-
ally lost. (For many people who don’t know about them, however, they may
seem like “lost books.”) For example, most everyone has at least heard of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, but most don’t realize that in addition to the familiar books
of the Hebrew Bible, these famous scrolls contain some very unusual writings
from an unusual group of pre-Christian Jewish believers who lived in the
desert near the Dead Sea.
Many people read the Bible but have no idea that ancient Jewish writings
that weren’t included in the Hebrew Bible (what the Christians call the Old
Testament) even exist. Furthermore, many Christians who know their New
Testament very well are unaware of the many early Christian writings that
weren’t included in the modern Christian New Testament.
Quite a few of these writings have long been available in English translation and
gathered into collections, and biblical scholars read and study them very care-
fully as important historical sources — even if Christians in the churches don’t
read them or even know about them. For example, about a dozen writings now
called the Apostolic Fathers (see Chapter 13) consist of writings that some early
Christians did want in their New Testament! Other writings were written by fac-
tions or groups that had particular disagreements with what later emerged as
Orthodox Christianity. It turns out that the first centuries of Christianity were
quite a wild ride — lots of debates, meetings, arguments . . . and lots of writings!
Sometimes the only reason historians even know about some writings that are
still lost is because the writings are quoted in the arguments of early Christian
theologians who try to show how unacceptable they are.
12
Part I: Setting the Stage 

Books that were lost but found again
Some lost books have turned up over the centuries. Most of the time, these
are writings that scholars knew existed but thought were lost. The famous
Book of 1 Enoch (see Chapter 6) is one such example; it’s not only well known
from early Christian use but also is even quoted in the New Testament’s Jude:
It was also about these that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam,
prophesied, saying, “See, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy
ones, to execute judgment on all, and to convict everyone of all the deeds of
ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the
harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
—Jude 1:14–15
Early Christian writers after the time of the New Testament also referred to 1
Enoch on occasion, so its existence was known. Then in the late 18th century,
the Scottish explorer James Bruce was exploring in Ethiopia and found that
the Ethiopic Christians had hand-copied editions of this book in the ancient
Ethiopic language of Ge’ez. He brought some copies back to Europe, generating
great excitement until it was finally published in English some 30 years later.
To Europeans, the Book of 1 Enoch was lost, but to Ethiopians (who probably
wondered what all the fuss was about), it was not.
One way that lost books are found is in old libraries where they’re gathering
dust and ignored until someone realizes what they are and reveals them to
the world. Many formerly lost books were discovered in this way — in the
backs of ancient libraries or even in museums!
Books quoted in other works 
but never actually found
One category of lost books are those whose titles are known and that schol-
ars have some general ideas about content-wise thanks to quotations and ref-
erences in other ancient writings, such as early Christian theologians who are
arguing about them. But they don’t have actual copies of these books . . . yet.
But in these cases, scholars and researchers definitely know what to look for!
The recent excitement about the rediscovery of the Gospel of Judas is similar.
(We summarize this work in Chapter 11.) Scholars knew that such a writing
13
Chapter 1: How to Lose Books of the Bible: A Hands-On Guide

existed, but it didn’t turn up until the late 20th century. The discovery was
announced to the world with great fanfare in 2005, with a rather significant
campaign of books, television programs, and promotional activities.
Previously unknown books
We don’t want to sound too cynical by suggesting that calling these works
“lost” is always erroneous and an overstatement, because entirely unknown
writings are occasionally discovered. It happened in 1948–1956, when the
Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. Included in the large number of texts found
over a number of years in the caves by the Dead Sea in Israel/Palestine were
ancient Hebrew versions of books in the Hebrew Bible. However, the collec-
tion also included a large number of writings entirely new, entirely unknown,
and entirely unexpected by modern scholars and historians. These were
unique writings written by the small group that once owned and produced
these hand-written scrolls. So, sometimes unknown writings can turn up.
Three of the Greatest “Lost 
Books” Finds of All Time
To get an idea of how this “lost books” business works, take a look at three of
the greatest finds of the 19th and 20th centuries that are directly related to
the Bible:
 The discovery the Codex Siniaticus, one of the oldest complete New
Testaments in Greek in possession today
 The discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library (1945)
 The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1947–1956)
Throughout this book, we discuss some of the results of these discoveries
(and others), but here we focus on the stories of these three major discover-
ies and a bit about why they were so significant. Not every discovery is this
dramatic, and, of course, we chose the best ones to get you, our reader,
warmed up to the subject!
The Codex Siniaticus
Here’s a great beginning to a story: There once was a German professor of 
the Bible named Constantin Tischendorff who was notable for his interest in
recovering the earliest manuscripts of the Bible he could find. In 1844, he first
14
Part I: Setting the Stage 

visited the famous ancient Greek Orthodox monastery St. Catherine’s, which
sits at the base of a mountain in the Sinai desert traditionally thought to be
the Mount Sinai where Moses received the law (a claim highly disputed by
modern archaeologists and historians, by the way).
Although he was searching for old manuscripts, Tischendorff never could
have dreamed that his travels would soon reveal one of the most important
early manuscripts of the Bible. According to one version of the story, the vis-
iting scholar spotted some Greek handwritten pages heading for the fire and
recovered them, only to discover that they were ancient Christian manu-
scripts. In another version of the story, he saved actual pages of a Greek
Bible that were headed for the trash, but either way, Tischendorff’s inquiries
led to his being shown what he thought should have been a treasured book
from the monastery library (and, in still other versions of the story — it was
already a treasured work): It was a Greek Bible from the fourth or fifth cen-
tury CE! It had portions of the Greek Old Testament and a complete New
Testament . . . and then some. (The “then some” included some of what was
later called the Apostolic Fathers, books that eventually did not end up in the
New Testament; see Chapter 13 for more on this collection of writings.)
Eventually, Tischendorff returned to the monastery in 1859 with funding from
the Tsar of Russia and convinced the monks to lend (or sell, depending on
whom you believe) the famous book to the Tsar. The monks today claim to
have a letter from Tischendorff promising to return the manuscript, so they
accuse him of stealing it!
Like a great murder mystery, the plot thickens. When the Russian Revolution
occurred, Lenin needed cash and agreed to sell the ancient Bible manuscript
to the British Museum in 1933. It remains on display at the museum to this
very day. According to one story, a large crowd gathered when the book was
delivered to the museum, and the entire crowd dropped to their knees as the
book was slowly walked up the long stairway to the museum entrance. Great
story. But why all the fuss?
This particular Bible, known today as Codex Siniaticus (which means The
Book from Sinai), may well be one of the 50 Bibles commissioned by Emperor
Constantine I, the first Christian Roman Emperor, who wanted Bibles produced
for 50 churches in his new capital city, Constantinople (modern Istanbul).
Furthermore, this New Testament contains the Epistle of Barnabas and the
Shepherd of Hermas, which don’t appear in the existing New Testament. The
inclusion of these works in the Codex suggests to some scholars that some
early Christians included them among New Testament books. Also, the Gospel
of Mark that appears in the Codex differs slightly from the version in the exist-
ing New Testament — it has the famous “shorter ending” that follows the
description of the empty tomb. (There are two disputed endings to the Gospel
of Mark: the longer ending found in some early manuscripts, and the shorter
ending found in Codex Siniaticus. Most English translations of the New
Testament provide both endings so you can compare them.)

Chapter 1: How to Lose Books of the Bible: A Hands-On Guide

The discovery of the Nag 
Hammadi Library
In the Nag Hammadi region of southern Egypt, a couple of poor farmers were
digging for some nitrates to fertilize their crops when they uncovered a jar.
Hoping that it contained something valuable, they broke it only to discover a
number of leather-bound papyrus pages and many fragments of written work.
The farmers wrapped up the ancient writings and brought them home.
They recognized some of the ancient writing as Coptic (an ancient Egyptian
language now used almost exclusively as a written language in the Coptic
Christian churches in Egypt and Ethiopia), so they assumed that the writings
had something to do with Christianity. Eventually, they gave the pages to the
local Coptic Christian Priest. It wasn’t long before the manuscripts made it to
the Coptic Museum in Cairo.
The collection of writings turned out to be Coptic translations of older Greek
manuscripts of Christian writings from the fourth century. Because ancient
Christian monks once practiced solitary prayers in the local caves of the Nag
Hammadi region, it was assumed that the writings were deposited in the caves
for safekeeping and then forgotten. Some have suggested that, at one point,
the discovered writings weren’t considered acceptable for early Christians to
read, and so instead of destroying them, some ancient Egyptian Christians
decided to bury them.
16
Part I: Setting the Stage 
Why do so many ancient manuscripts 
turn up in Egypt?
The answer to this question is easy: Ancient
manuscripts survive really well in Egypt’s very
dry climate. Also, many ancient Egyptian writ-
ings are written on papyrus, which consists of
flattened and interwoven long strips of leaves
from the papyrus plant that grows wild up and
down the Nile. Papyrus is very durable, and it
likes dry climates!
Even moving the short distance north into
modern Israel/Palestine and especially as far
north as Lebanon increases the rainfall just
enough to make the environment and atmos-
phere less friendly to ancient manuscripts.
Unless these fragile writings are sealed in clay
jars, they’re unlikely to make it (even in Egypt,
but it’s where they have the best chance).
Of course, another important reason for so
many discoveries in Egypt is that ancient Egypt
was a major Jewish and Christian center —
especially ancient Alexandria on the coast —
and therefore many writings were produced
there.

Most of the Nag Hammadi writings (collectively referred to as the Nag
Hammadi Library) show signs of Gnostic influence, an ancient philosophy
that influenced a large number of early Christians but led to serious quarrels
from Christians who believed that Gnosticism introduced dangerous ideas
into Christian theology (see the Gnosticism discussion in Chapter 12). No one
knows for sure how these writings were first deposited or why, so the theo-
ries are pure speculation.
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
For biblical studies, easily the most spectacular find of the 20th century —
and perhaps even the most spectacular find in the entire millennium — is the
Dead Sea Scrolls.
The story is now rather famous: A Bedouin boy was trying to find a stray 
goat that had wandered into one of the dozens of caves in the hillsides by the
shores of the Dead Sea (see Figure 1-1 for a photo of these caves). Apparently
hoping to chase the goat out of the darkness in the back of the cave, he threw
a rock to startle the goat, but the rock hit something and the boy heard the
sound of breaking clay. The rest, as they say, is history.

17
Chapter 1: How to Lose Books of the Bible: A Hands-On Guide

Some of the scrolls were eventually sold to Professor Eleazar L. Sukenik at the
Hebrew University; others were sold to clergy of the Syrian Orthodox Church,
until they too were eventually purchased by representatives of Israel.
After it became clear where the original clay jars were discovered, all the
remaining caves throughout the entire area were thoroughly searched, turn-
ing up more and more discoveries. All told, over 800 manuscripts and thou-
sands of pieces and fragments were found, and other finds were discovered
in later years. Most of the scrolls are now kept in Israel, but smaller pieces
are in other museum collections.
The Dead Sea Scrolls contain two kinds of material:
 Copies of writings known from the Bible (the Bible, of course, was deter-
mined later than the time of the Scrolls)
 Copies of Jewish religious writings that were never seen before (some
known, but some entirely unknown)
It’s presumed that the community who originally produced these writings trea-
sured both kinds of literature with equal reverence. The writings that only they
knew and treasured most likely were writings that they composed, which is
why they weren’t known and quoted by other ancient Jewish writers (as far as
scholars know) and also why there are multiple copies of these writings.
Portions — some more complete than others — of every book of the Hebrew
Bible except Esther are represented in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The real signifi-
cance of the “biblical” books (of course, there wasn’t a Bible yet at the time)
is that they’re written in Hebrew and Aramaic and therefore are older than
any other Hebrew versions that exist in modern times. Because of the tradi-
tion in Judaism of using scrolls that are only in very good condition, older
scrolls were typically destroyed in favor of newer copies. Therefore, before
the Hebrew manuscripts of the Dead Sea were discovered, the oldest Hebrew
manuscripts were only as old as the ninth to tenth centuries CE.
Although scholars had old Greek translations of the biblical books (like Codex
Siniaticus) prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, they didn’t have very
old Hebrew versions. So, when you look at a Dead Sea Scroll, you’re looking at
a Hebrew version of these writings that’s virtually 1,000 years older than any
Hebrew language copies of the Bible that had been seen for hundreds of years.
It’s like taking a giant step back in time to see how the Hebrew Bible looked
back then. Of course, the discovery of these manuscripts revolutionized the
study of the Hebrew Bible because it supplied much older manuscripts to
work with and to compare with more recent versions.
The dates of the scrolls are estimated to be from about 300 BCE to 50–60 CE.
Scholars assume that these scrolls were written by a community of Jews who
were disappointed with the religious life in Jerusalem and may even have had
some arguments with the people controlling the Temple there. It appears that
18
Part I: Setting the Stage 

the community left Jerusalem to set up a separate community somewhere
near the Dead Sea and possibly at the ruins near Qumran. When the Jewish
Revolt led to Roman military reprisals against Jewish towns and communi-
ties, one theory is that members of this community hid their library in hopes
of coming back to retrieve it after things had settled down — but nobody sur-
vived who knew where the works were hidden. So, there they sat, in those
caves, until the 20th century.
In, Almost In, and Out: Categorizing
Ancient Religious Writing
Anyone who studies the formation of the Bible soon discovers that the
process involved lots of discussion about various writings — especially among
Christians. The Jewish scholars, interestingly enough, didn’t talk much about
the issue of a “set collection” of special writings even though they most cer-
tainly did make a final decision about their collection of religious writings — a
collection that eventually became the Hebrew Bible. The Christians eventually
had to decide what their Bible would contain, but they had to decide on con-
tents for both their Old Testament and their New Testament. The Jewish tradi-
tion eventually decided what comprised their Hebrew Bible, but their decision
process was quite different from the Christians’ even though they were talking
about some of the same writings!
To complicate matters even more, not only are we talking about three differ-
ent processes (Christians working on two different collections and Jews work-
ing on one), but also there were never only two categories of religious writings:
good and bad. That’s far too simplistic, and furthermore, it’s not true to the his-
torical facts and the discussions that actually took place.
There are actually three categories of ancient religious writings in the lives of
the ancient Jews and the ancient Christians:
 The books that are in the Bible.
 The books that were almost in the Bible. Lots of people like them, but in
the end, they didn’t make it.
 The books that were rejected for inclusion in the Bible. These books had
no shot at being included.
Note: Lost Books of the Bible For Dummies doesn’t focus on the first category,
the books that are in the Bible. We briefly talk about them collectively, but if
this is your real interest, then we recommend that you turn to The Bible For
Dummies, by Jeffrey Geoghegan and Michael Homan (published by Wiley). Even
though we speak about the Bible throughout this book, we’re mainly interested
in the second and third categories, the “almost in” and the “clearly out.”

Chapter 1: How to Lose Books of the Bible: A Hands-On Guide

Questioning the Idea of Biblical 
Lost and Found
When you get past the initial excitement of the idea of lost books and espe-
cially lost books of the Bible, some questions start nagging: How does anyone
lose a book of the Bible? In fact, how can anyone lose such an important writ-
ing? And how does anyone find such books? Do people know where to look,
or are the discoveries simply fortuitous accidents?
How do books get lost?
The interest in discovering lost books isn’t new, but you may be wondering
how books that are so important get lost in the first place. 
Well, the main problem is that we are modern persons who think like modern
people! We have printing presses that produce thousands of copies of a book,
and wonder how anyone could lose a book — even a bad book.
But in the ancient world, books were rare. They had to be produced by hand,
and they were kept in libraries, sometimes far from population centers where
the precious writings could be damaged, stolen, or destroyed. If you only
20
Part I: Setting the Stage 
Complicating matters: Adding a fourth category
An early Christian historian named Eusebius of
Caesarea (early fourth century) is often called
the Father of Christian History Writing because
he wrote a massive work (that we still have,
usually published in two volumes) called the
History of the Church.
In his work, Eusebius discusses some of the
debates and discussions among Christians
about the religious books that would eventually
become part of the canon of the New Testament.
Eusebius actually talks about dozens and
dozens of early Christian writings, including the
books that eventually did become part of the
New Testament. In his discussion, however,
Eusebius divides these writings into no less
than four categories:
 The writings that everyone agrees are cen-
trally important
 The writings that people argue about but
most everyone likes
 The writings that people argue about but
only a few people like
 The writings that pretty much nobody likes

have a few copies to begin with, you begin to understand how a writing could
be “lost.” If a tragedy occurs — disease, fire, conquest — precious manu-
scripts could be lost forever. Many discovered manuscripts appear to have
been hidden precisely to prevent bad things happening to them. Furthermore,
if the writings were produced by a small faction, a “group” within the larger
Church, then perhaps only a few copies were ever made. And, last, we hate to
admit it, but the early believers (bless them) were not above destroying books
that they didn’t like, either.
When you think about it, each and every discovery of an ancient manuscript
from before the days of printing is an incredible gift to modern scholars, read-
ers, and historians. The interesting thing is, finding rare writings was already
something that ancient people loved to talk about. Of course they knew how
rare writings were . . . so you know they knew how important it was to find
something older! We can easily prove this with a story from the Bible itself.
Just because it’s “found” doesn’t 
make it important
Earlier in this section, we raise an important question: “How can such impor-
tant writings ever be lost?” Part of the answer is already in the question:
Important writings are rarely lost. For both the Jews and the Christians, the
only books that became lost were books not considered important by very
many people. Think about it — if a work is unknown and never quoted, or
only rarely mentioned by other ancient writers . . . then the fact of the matter
is that the work wasn’t really missed. These writings are the work of a small
group of people, and it’s therefore very easy to overestimate their importance
because of the romance of finding ancient writings!
Although it’s always important to find ancient writings to add to the evidence
for writing ancient history, it’s another matter completely to try to determine
how important a writing is. After all, somebody’s ancient grocery list may be
ancient, and it may tell historians something about ancient diets or family
meals, but it hardly belongs in the Bible as a sacred discovery. In short, age is
not the only issue here.
In fact, books of the Bible aren’t really lost or found. The Bible emerged from
a long process of using writings in the life of a religious tradition. The very
fact that these writings weren’t lost is important — you don’t lose something
that you use again and again, make copies of, and distribute all around. But if
you’re a small group whose writings don’t appeal to very many folks, then
when you die out, so does the interest in your writings . . . sometimes. The
important point is this: Scholars actually have every single work that was
21
Chapter 1: How to Lose Books of the Bible: A Hands-On Guide

quoted extensively and often by ancient Christians. They weren’t lost. But
what scholars don’t have is every work that ancient Christians ever quoted.
Some writings that weren’t quoted very often (if at all) haven’t survived.
True, it would be nice to have them, but that’s not the same as saying, “A
book of the Bible is missing!” That would make a great headline, but it doesn’t
make sense. How could it be so important if it’s lost?
Do Books Get Suppressed?
Another way to speak of lost books, however, has more to do with modern
ideas than ancient ones. Some modern scholars, for example, have decided
that they quite like some of the books that were excluded from the Bible. For
one reason or another, they defend their interest in those books by suggest-
ing that it was a “political” decision to exclude these writings.
However, the fact is that Christianity in the first few centuries was never so
centrally and powerfully organized. Nobody paid much attention to “central
leaders” until the Roman Empire became “Christian.” So, most of the time,
the early Christian leaders decided to endorse those writings that the Christians
already were using for over 200 years and finding really positive and useful.
Leaders weren’t imposing books on people who didn’t want them, just follow-
ing along with the “group decision.”
On the other hand, modern readers may wonder if there was some kind of
agenda (religious or political) that led to some books being excluded. If you
could make the historical case that a large number of people liked a particu-
lar writing that was excluded, then you may have a good argument that some-
thing is up — and you have reason to wonder what happened!
Although it doesn’t happen anymore, books may have been suppressed, or
even destroyed, among early Christians. In fact, some believe that the Nag
Hammadi Library is a group of writings that some early Christian didn’t have
the heart to destroy, so he buried them (or hid them) instead, and the docu-
ments survived to the present.
The real question is whether there’s any such thing as a modern conspiracy
to hide some religious writings. The answer should be obvious to anyone
who has visited a good university library! There they are in plain sight:
English translations of everything that has been found so far.
It’s traditional that historians or archaeologists have the right to be the first
ones to publish their discoveries. But they’re supposed to get to it in a rea-
sonable amount of time. They’re allowed a few years to do some research
22
Part I: Setting the Stage 

and carefully prepare a publication of what they’ve discovered, including a
translation, but they aren’t supposed to take lots of time to do it. Other schol-
ars will get very impatient if the find isn’t published fairly quickly.
For example, some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were held up for publication for
decades, causing a great outcry among scholars until it was revealed that
photographic copies of virtually all the main scrolls were available in
libraries in different parts of the world. The Huntington Library in Los
Angeles famously made the first announcement that they would make these
previously secret photographs available for scholarly examination. Why were
they kept from public view in the first place? We hesitate to answer this
because it doesn’t put scholars in a very good light! The scrolls weren’t being
suppressed because people were afraid of what they said; rather, it’s now
quite clear that the scrolls were being held by a handful of scholars who
wanted the sole right to decide who could publish them and do research on
them. Eventually, a public outcry against the scholars who kept these scrolls
to themselves incited the Huntington Library to break the silence by
announcing the availability of the photos.
What does this story reveal? Basically this: The scholarly world would never
tolerate a suppressed discovery. No church, no museum, and no organization
has the ability to keep discoveries from the public for long. The outcry even-
tually becomes intolerable (and rightly so!). Moreover, most scholars
absolutely agree with full disclosure and staunchly resist the idea that any-
thing should be suppressed. Although some people believe that some ancient
writings may be suppressed to protect certain institutions or even whole reli-
gions, the simple fact is that many scholars have no particular religious inter-
ests, and so they certainly wouldn’t go along with any religious-based
attempt to suppress writings.
So, although “conspiracy to suppress evidence” sounds exciting, in the end
it’s really impossible to execute in the modern scholarly and academic world.
Medical researchers wouldn’t last long if they faked or withheld evidence . . .
it’s the same with ancient historians! The only lost books of the Bible that
remain unknown are the ones that are still lost.

Tracing the History of the Jewish
and Christian Biblical Canons

 Debating what’s in and what’s out of the Christian canon
B
elieve it or not, the Bible as you know it didn’t come into existence out
of whole cloth or from any single unanimous decision by ancient schol-
ars that also commanded widespread popular acceptance by the people.
Furthermore, nobody sat down and consciously said, “Today I’m writing a
book of the Bible.” Instead, selected writings became well-known, well-loved,
and passed around . . . and that led to the discussion of which collection or
list of such writings were recommended to everyone.
Having said that, however, a good word to describe the period in which the
decisions about the books of the Bible were made, as well as the process
involved in such decisions, is contentious. While a core of writings seemed to
always be at the center from as early as the second century CE, the fringes
continued to be debated before lists were finally settled upon. In this chapter,
we go through that process and look at what books and writings were consid-
ered, who did some of the considering, and who made the final decisions as
to what the Holy Bible would actually look like.
But isn’t this book about the books that didn’t make it into the Bible as we
know it today? Why does it matter how and when the biblical canon was
assembled? And why should we even care? Glad you asked. There are very
good answers to those questions . . . and that’s why you’re here. 
The most obvious question about “lost books” is how they got, well, “lost” in
the first place. That means revisiting how the canon was formed to see if we
can figure out the basis for excluding some writings (it isn’t always obvious).
But more important, one discovers that this was a slow process that involved

lots of debates and arguments, and was not a single decision imposed “from
above” by any one leader in either the Jewish or Christian traditions. There is
no “plot” here; it was a debate with lots of participants.
First Things First: Understanding a
Biblical Canon
The word “canon” comes from a Greek term that originally meant “measuring
stick,” like a ruler or yardstick. The word was also used to refer to a set of
measurements or even plans for proper construction of something, like a
temple or a shrine.
When used in connection with collections of writings, the term “canon” refers
to a widely recognized list of texts. For example, you may have heard of a
canon of British literature, a canon of Greek poetry, and so on. These are
simply the most popular works or the basics to get you started. In biblical
studies, however — and this is important — “canon” means much more. A
biblical canon refers to the actual approved list of scripture (meaning simply
religious books) that became central to religious discussion and debate on
matters of faith. If it isn’t on the list and therefore part of the canon, it isn’t
considered a solid basis for the faith.
Keep in mind that when we talk about scripture, the term “canon” means
“official and approved,” not simply “suggested, recognized, or recommended.”
In other words, a canon of poetry is suggested writings, but a biblical canon
is the approved list and no others! The latter is much more formal.
The notion of agreeing on a biblical canon is a very controversial idea
because, for starters, there’s a great difference between scripture and canon,
and it’s very important not to confuse the two. Many religious traditions have
scriptures — written works that they consider to be very important for their
religious traditions. Buddhism has a scripture, as does Hinduism. But not all
these religious traditions have a canon — a limited list that was officially
determined and which excludes some writings and includes others. Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam fit the definition, so to speak, by having what can
undeniably be called canons: lists of approved writings that intentionally
exclude other writings.
Of course, a canon becomes important only when there are other books
besides what’s on the approved list. With lots of ancient writings available,
the canon is a selection from the larger collection of material. When it comes
to studying the biblical canon, the essential questions to ask are:
26
Part I: Setting the Stage 

 Who determined this list?
 Why were the books that were excluded not chosen?
 Do these excluded books contain something interesting?
 Were they suppressed or hidden from people?
Curiosity is the name of the game. Whenever someone says, “These are the
good books, the right books,” we instantly want to know about the bad ones
and the rejected ones! It’s just human nature, we guess. After all, you did just
buy a book on the lost books of the Bible, right?
Not Everyone’s Biblical 
Canon Is the Same
The main reason biblical canons become a bit complicated is that no less than
four different religious groups are involved in the discussion about the Bible.
Start with Judaism: Judaism has a Bible that they usually call the TaNaK (an
acronym for Torah, Prophets, and Writings) or sometimes the Hebrew Bible.
All three Christian groups — Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestants — adopted
the Hebrew Bible as the first part of their Bible, and then all three added a
New Testament composed of selected early Christian writings.
This is where things get a bit complicated. The three main Christian bodies all
adopted the same New Testament (which is an impressive achievement, given
everything they disagree on). However, they did not adopt the same version of
the Old Testament. It’s a fascinating story that’s fairly straightforward:
 The Roman Catholic Church adopted the Hebrew Bible but added a few
later Jewish writings commonly known as The Apocrypha or Deutero-
Canonical Books. We discuss these books in Chapter 4.
 The Protestant churches, beginning with Martin Luther and John Calvin
in the 16th century, excluded the Deutero-Canonical Books and decided
to adopt the same list of books as the Jews. So, the Protestant Old
Testament is the same list of books as the Hebrew Bible (but usually
arranged in a different order).
 The various Orthodox churches (Russian, Greek, Ethiopic, and so on)
added even a few more Jewish writings to their Old Testament, in addi-
tion to the Apocryphal books added by the Catholic Church.
The remaining sections in this chapter walk you through how the Jews formed
their Hebrew Bible and how Christians formed their Old and New Testaments.
27
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons

The Evolution of the Old Testament 
(Or Hebrew Bible)
Because the Hebrew biblical writings are much older than the Christian writ-
ings, most historians start discussions about the formation of the canon by
talking about the origin of sacred writings among Jews. And this makes sense
because these sacred writings were the basis for the Christian canon as well.
In this section, we take a look at how a “scripture” led to a “canon” for the
Hebrew writings that became the Old Testament for Christians and the
Hebrew Bible for Jews.
Transitioning from oral tradition 
to the written word
A very old Jewish tradition claims that the famous Hebrew scribe Ezra drew
up the list of the books now known as the Hebrew Bible for Jews. It’s a tradi-
tion that’s really based on only a few verses from the book of Nehemiah, and
when you actually look at those verses, you can see that it doesn’t quite say
that. The problem is that the Hebrew Bible rarely talks about sacred writings.
This tradition arose among the early Rabbis, the first Jewish religious leaders
of the kind of Judaism that survives to this day. In fact, the Bible itself doesn’t
really talk about any writings. Most communications — even from God —
were oral and therefore passed on by speaking.
In the ancient world, very few people could read except for trained scribes.
Even kings usually couldn’t read and hired scribes to write for them, so refer-
ences to kings “writing letters,” for example, probably meant that they dic-
tated the letters. If you read the famous stories about how God
communicated to the people in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt, you
quickly see that the tradition is that Moses and the people heard God — God
didn’t send a letter:
Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, in
order that the people may hear when I speak with you and so trust you ever
after.” When Moses had told the words of the people to the Lord . . .
—Exodus 19:9
“Hear,” “told,” “speak” . . . that was the means of communication. Practically
speaking, even if someone like Moses could write, the people would have
needed to have things read to them by someone literate.
Most historians think that the first major indication of scriptures (religiously
important reference writings for the Jews) is during the time of King Josiah,
28
Part I: Setting the Stage 

who reigned in Jerusalem from 640–609 BCE. The book of 2 Kings says 
that King Josiah started a reform campaign to clean up the Temple and try 
to reform the religion of Israel to return to the teachings of Moses after a
series of bad kings. While cleaning up the Temple, one of the Priests found 
a scroll. 
What did the Priest find? What was this writing, this discovered scroll? The
general consensus among historians is that it was the present book of
Deuteronomy or at least the laws that appear in the book of Deuteronomy.
The discovery of the scroll is one of the oldest references in the Bible to
important writings. But you should keep in mind that nobody is saying any-
thing about “scriptures” or “holy writings” yet. The find in 2 Kings is just an
important writing that was referred to as a “book of the covenant” (presum-
ably a version of the laws of Moses, and most likely a version of the book of
Deuteronomy). Still, it’s a beginning.
Grouping writings together
When did religious writings become important for the Jewish community as a
whole? The next important event in the evolution of the Jewish canon comes
almost 200 years after King Josiah (but still about 450 years before Jesus) and
involves Ezra.
Ezra and Nehemiah were both Jewish officials and descendents of the exiles
that the Babylonians led away from the destroyed Jerusalem back in 587 BCE.
After the Babylonians, the Persian Empire took over, and they allowed some
of the Jewish captive exiles to return to the land of Palestine. Nehemiah and
Ezra were allowed to visit back in Jerusalem. The Book of Nehemiah 8:1–6
says that the Priest who was also described as a “scribe,” Ezra, brings some
very special things with him on his visit back to Jerusalem:
All the people gathered together into the square before the Water Gate. They
told the scribe Ezra to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord
had given to Israel. Accordingly, the priest Ezra brought the law before the
assembly, both men and women and all who could hear with understanding.
—Nehemiah 8:1–2
As we mention earlier, this was 200 years later than King Josiah, and look
how things were changing! “Reading the Law” was a big event — part of a 
religious service, even! People stood to listen to it. Clearly, the “book of the
Law of Moses” was becoming a centrally important writing. In short, the
people were now acting like they had a scripture that was important. No 
specific books are mentioned, and it’s still too early to talk about a canon, 
but things were definitely progressing toward the importance of religious
writings.
29
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons

Clues of preferred writings 
in the book of Sirach
The Jewish writing called the book of Sirach (sometimes called Ecclesiasticus)
was written by a famous Jewish scholar named Jesus ben Sira, who lived
about 200–175 years before Jesus Christ. This book has some important pas-
sages that support interest in the formation of a list of Hebrew religious writ-
ings. In a long chapter about the heroes (and villains) of Hebrew history,
Sirach eventually says something quite interesting:
It was Ezekiel who saw the vision of glory, which God showed him above
the chariot of the cherubim. For God also mentioned Job who held fast to all
the ways of justice. May the bones of the Twelve Prophets send forth new
life from where they lie, for they comforted the people of Jacob and
delivered them with confident hope.
—Sirach 49:8–10
This passage mentions the prophet Ezekiel . . . but not a book. It seems hard
to believe, however, that author Jesus ben Sira is only referring to oral tradi-
tions considering that Ezekiel lived almost 400 years before Sirach! Even more
interesting, however, is that this passage refers to “the Twelve Prophets.”
Clearly, some writings were being grouped into a kind of set already at this
time, and the set was referred to as “The Twelve.” It seems a bit unusual to
talk about “the bones” of the prophets, but clearly what Sirach means is that
their writings continue to inspire even though the speakers are long dead!
Sounds like these writings are becoming highly valued in the community!
Furthermore, in a famous Prologue later attached to the book of Sirach, a
writer who claims to be Jesus ben Sirach’s grandson says something even
more striking — and note that the timing is only about 135–120 years before
the time of Jesus Christ:
Many great teachings have been given to us through the Law and the
Prophets and the others that followed them, and for these we should praise
Israel for instruction and wisdom. Now, those who read the scriptures must
not only themselves understand them, but must also as lovers of learning be
able through the spoken and written word to help the outsiders. So my
grandfather Jesus, who had devoted himself especially to the reading of the
Law and the Prophets and the other books of our ancestors, and had
acquired considerable proficiency in them, was himself also led to write
something pertaining to instruction and wisdom, so that by becoming
familiar also with his book those who love learning might make even
greater progress in living according to the law.
—Sirach Prologue 1:1
30
Part I: Setting the Stage 

This Prologue seems to set up the three categories of important Jewish books:
 Law: The five books of the Torah — Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
and Deuteronomy
 Prophets: “The Twelve” plus Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel
 Other writings: Probably including Psalms, Song of Songs, Esther, and
eventually Daniel . . . and perhaps even other writings (including even
Enoch for some Jewish readers at this early stage)
Rabbis and other experts weigh in
Soon after the time of Jesus, there’s a fork in the road. Judaism develops
down one road, and Christianity goes down a separate road. We focus on 
the Jewish path first. For Judaism, the authority of groups of rabbis in the
Jewish community is enormously influential in the determination of canonical
writings. So, we turn to their writings to follow the story of the canon in the
Jewish tradition. (Later in this chapter, we backtrack and follow the Christian
debates about their canon.)
31
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons
Who is Josephus?
Josephus was a Jewish military leader who
was part of the Jewish Revolt against the
Roman occupation of Palestine between 66–70
CE. Josephus was captured by the Romans and
eventually went (or was taken) to Rome. It
seems that he became so impressed with the
Roman Empire that he decided that the revolt
was all just a big misunderstanding! He
believed that if the Romans were to really
understand who the Jews were and their
important history, then the Romans would real-
ize that the Jews would be better allies than
enemies. In order to accomplish this reconcili-
ation with Rome, Josephus took it upon himself
to write a history of the Jewish people, in Greek,
so that Roman citizens (and especially leaders)
could read it and come to appreciate what swell
people the Jews were.
Happily for us, most of Josephus’s many vol-
umes of writings have survived and have
become a very important source of Jewish
thought in the first century. However, it’s impor-
tant to always keep in mind that Josephus was
writing to try to impress the Romans, and this
intention may have influenced his reports. For
example, when Josephus retold the stories of
the Bible, he sort of smoothed over little bits that
he thought might offend the Romans.
Josephus is an important source of historical
information (whether biased or not!) for the
centuries just before, and even during, the time
of Jesus because he carried on his historical
descriptions right up to his own time!

A rabbinic council at Yamnia?
One very common theory about the creation of a Jewish canon is that it
started with a very special gathering of Jewish rabbinic students and schol-
ars under the leadership of Rabbi Yohanon Ben Zakkai, one of the most
important early Jewish Rabbinic leaders.
The rabbi led a gathering in his school in a town on the coast of Israel called
Yamnia. So, some historians refer to a “Council at Yamnia” around 90 CE. It’s
thought that a canon may have started to emerge among Jewish leaders in
Yamnia, but is there any evidence that they made a decision? Not really.
Other Jewish voices: Does Josephus write about the Jewish Scriptures?
With little evidence that any decisions were made at Yamnia regarding a
canon of books, scholars often turn to a Jewish historian who was not a
Rabbi, but a soldier-turned-historian named Josephus, for more clues to the
story of the Jewish canon.
Josephus was a Jew writing in the first century CE, and lucky for everyone, he
wrote about the Jewish Scriptures. Included in Josephus’s writings are the
following interesting passages:
. . . we do not possess myriads of inconsistent books, conflicting with each
other. Our books, those which are justly accredited, are but two and twenty,
and contain the records of all time . . . which contain the records of all the
past times; which are justly believed to be divine; and of them five belong 
to Moses . . . but as to the time from the death of Moses till the reign of
Artaxerxes king of Persia, who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were
after Moses, wrote down what was done in their times in thirteen books. The
remaining four books contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of
human life . . .
We have given practical proof of our reverence for our own Scriptures. For
although such long ages have now passed, no one has ventured either to
add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable . . .
—Against Apion, section 1:8
Looks great, but how helpful is this, really? Josephus gives a number, 22, sug-
gesting pretty much the books now recognized in the Jewish canon (if you
combine Ezra-Nehemiah, for example, and suggest that Esther was still being
questioned) — but Josephus does not make a list. And it’s not known what 
he means by “accredited.” Josephus does suggest, however, three sections:
Moses, Prophets, and the “remaining books.” It seems clear that some kind of
collection of books was emerging clearly in the first century CE, but a firm list
remained out of reach. Furthermore, Josephus talks about different groups of
Jews disagreeing over which scriptures are important and which ones aren’t.
So, if they were still debating the matter, clearly no central list had emerged
just yet.

The rabbis discuss books that “defile the hands”
So, neither Yamnia nor Josephus provides a canon yet. The problem is,
there’s further evidence that the rabbis were still debating some of the books
even after Yamnia!
Early Jewish rabbis debated about holy books by discussing books that
“defile the hands.” These are books that are so holy that they shouldn’t be
handled in an improper way.
The problem is these discussions in the early rabbinic writings we call The
Talmud really only talk about three disputed books: Esther, Song of Songs, and
Ecclesiastes. The debate is whether these three books “defile the hands” — and
many historians interpret the debate as evidence that the issue of the canon
was still being debated by the rabbis in the second to fourth centuries CE!
The Talmud: At last the list appears!
In modern Judaism, the generally acknowledged decision about the canon of the
Hebrew Bible is identified in the Talmud (but not part of the “defile the hands”
discussion; refer to the preceding section “The rabbis discuss books that ‘defile
the hands’”). The Talmud is a collection of authoritative rabbinic teachings com-
piled in the sixth century CE, but it also includes material from many centuries
before and even some material from the time before Christianity (although not
very much of it is that early). A section of the Talmud that many scholars date
no later than 200 CE contains a discussion that includes the following:
Our Rabbis taught: The order of the Prophets is, Joshua, Judges, Samuel,
Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and the Twelve Minor Prophets . . .
. . . The order of the Hagiographa is Ruth, the Book of Psalms, Job, Prophets,
Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel and the Scroll of Esther,
Ezra and Chronicles . . .
—Baba Bathra 14, Babylonian Talmud
Who wrote the scriptures referred to here? The Babylonian Talmud suggests
some proposed authors:
Moses wrote his own book and the portion of Balaam and Job.
Joshua wrote the book which bears his name and [the last] eight verses of
the Pentateuch.
Samuel wrote the book which bears his name and the Book of Judges and
Ruth.
David wrote the Book of Psalms.
—Baba Bathra, 14a–14b, Babylonian Talmud
33
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons

Clearly, this is the elusive evidence that lists and titles of writings were
clearly understood, and the Talmud comes about as close as possible to evi-
dence for a Jewish canon, even though rabbinic leaders in Judaism didn’t use
the term “canon.”
In fact, for Jewish history, there was no real debate about the importance of
the first scrolls of Moses that made up the Torah, the first part of the Hebrew
Bible, because older references establish its use. Even if there’s no evidence
of some final meeting among rabbis to decide the canon of the Jewish
Hebrew Bible, by the sixth century CE and probably already by the second to
third centuries CE, the Hebrew Bible was largely agreed and set (despite con-
tinued discussions about Esther).
Jewish scholars still debate what criteria were used for this list that finally
appears in the Talmud, but it seems that one major criterion was that the
books needed to be written in Hebrew and were thought to be written before
the time of Ezra (450 BCE) because of the tradition in early Jewish teaching
that “prophecy ceased” after the time of Ezra. These issues continue to be
discussed to this day.
The Christian Old Testament: Translations
of Jewish Writings into Greek
In the previous section, we follow the development of the Hebrew Bible for
the Jews, but there was also a translation of the Jewish writings into Greek in
the last two centuries before Jesus. This translated collection of Jewish writ-
ings ended up not being the same as the Hebrew Bible because later writings
were included with the Greek translations of the older Hebrew works . . . and
this difference becomes especially important for the Christian movement
when it comes along.
In order to discuss how the Christians started to put together their Bible, we
need to begin with the older work of the translation of the Jewish writings
into Greek, because this leads us directly to the Christian Old Testament.
Sometime between 300 and 200 BCE, a massive project was started among
those Jews who had been living for a few generations in Alexandria, the great
Egyptian coastal city that served as a kind of headquarters for the Greek
rulers over Egypt after Alexander the Great’s conquests. Eventually, a large
Jewish community resided in Alexandria, so it seems logical that it was the
base for this great project of translating the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek so
that Greek-speaking Jews could read their scriptures in the language that
they were most comfortable using.
34
Part I: Setting the Stage 

Even though this project was largely completed before Christianity, the
resulting Greek translations became centrally important for the Christian
movement when it started. The Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, called the
Septuagint, was quickly adopted by the first Christians as the “Old Testament
Scriptures” even before the New Testament writings started to emerge.
This Greek version included more writings than the Jewish rabbis accepted
for the Hebrew Bible, and those extra writings became part of the Christian
Old Testament but not part of the Hebrew Bible.
Over 80 percent of the time the New Testament quotes the “scriptures,” it
prefers the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible over the Hebrew-language ver-
sion. This speaks volumes, so to speak. (Sorry.) Christianity was becoming a
religion spoken in Greek (and eventually also in Latin), and thus Christianity
had a tendency to prefer the Greek translations of the old Jewish writings for
the Old Testament.
One Last Push to the Christian 
Old Testament: The Influence 
of Marcion of Sinope
Christians adopted the Greek translations of the Jewish writings (plus a few
extra writings), and that collection (called the Septuagint) became the Old
Testament for Christians. But there was one last debate among Christians
that really clarified the issue of even having a Christian Old Testament, and it
was the debate around the highly controversial early Christian intellectual
known as Marcion.
35
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons
Yet another name for the Hebrew 
Bible/Old Testament!
In Australia, there’s a growing tradition of 
referring to the Old Testament as the “First
Testament” and the New Testament as the
“Second Testament.” Some university profes-
sors down under even identify themselves as 
a “Professor of the Second Testament” or
“Lecturer in First Testament.” It’s an interesting
idea that has one interesting side benefit: Some
Australian Christians refer to modern life as the
“Now Testament.” Those clever Aussies!

Marcion of Sinope (who died around 160 CE) was a very powerful personality
and intellect, and as a wealthy ship owner, he had the money to back up his
brains.
Marcion started a religious movement based on his ideas about Christianity.
Basically, he was so repulsed by the violence and rituals of the Hebrew Bible
that he came to believe that the God preached by Jesus must have had noth-
ing to do with the god of the Jews!
Marcion therefore advocated that Christians should only use an edited ver-
sion of the Gospel of Luke (his edited version, of course) and the writings 
of Paul (at least the ones he liked). Marcion thought that Paul taught that
Christians were no longer connected to the laws and traditions of Moses and
thus no longer connected to the Jews.
But Marcion went even farther and said that Christians should have nothing
to do with the Hebrew Bible — and thus have no Old Testament at all!
So, did Marcion’s little collection of writings spur other Christians into
action? In other words, did the Christians start to decide their list as a
response to Marcion’s pressure? Clearly Marcion posed a major challenge,
especially on the matter of the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament).
Historians know that many early Christian writers responded to Marcion —
sometimes with fiery rhetoric. Particularly vocal was a North African Christian
theologian named Tertullian (155–230 CE), who wrote responses to Marcion
almost 50 years after Marcion began to get noticed. Tertullian and others
worked furiously to reaffirm the Christian commitment to the Hebrew
Scriptures and the use of other Christian gospels and letters. But it’s also
clear that the Christians were still in no hurry to set an official canon; they
only wanted to reaffirm that they treasured the Hebrew Bible as scripture.
Two Nudges for Christians to Begin
Forming Their Own “New” Testament
The adoption of the Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures and the
debate with Marcion (both discussed previously in this chapter) clarified for
early Christianity that it had an Old Testament. But what about a New
Testament? When did the Christians finally decide on that part?
It seems that for the first century at least, the Christians were content to cite
Hebrew Scriptures in their preaching and writing and also cite sayings of
Jesus or even letters of Paul. But there was very little talk of a New Testament
in the first century.
36
Part I: Setting the Stage 

Why did Christians move in the direction of a second set of scriptures — a
“New” Testament? Were Christian writers pushed to come up with one list?
Why draw up a list at all? After all, even though Christians as early as Paul
refer to the Jewish scriptures, many early Christians preferred the oral tradi-
tions about Jesus! They preferred preaching and knowing who taught the
preacher so that they could trace the teachings back to Jesus through the
Apostles. So why worry about a New Testament at all? Scholars typically
debate the impact of two “nudges”:
 The rise of the Montanists
 Gnosticism
The rise of the Montanists
If Marcion wanted to cut too much from inclusion in the Christian canon,
arguably Montanism would have potentially added too much. Montanism’s
challenge was really more for a New Testament than an Old Testament, but
when you start talking about lists, you find that the Christians talked about
both parts.
Montanism was a fascinating early Christian movement founded by Montanus,
who was from Phrygia (in modern Turkey). In 170 CE, he began to preach
about the near return of Jesus. He seemed to have that certain something —
a very attractive personality that apparently had a particularly strong impact
on women (not that there’s anything wrong with that, of course).
Montanus claimed to be a prophet and therefore able to add new messages
and the possibility of new writings to the body of existing religious texts.
Montanus defended his idea of “new revelations from God,” but he also
taught a strict regimen of self-control, fasting, and even seeking martyrdom.
Some thought that the Montanists were crazy, but others were impressed;
Tertullian became a “convert” to the Montanist perspective, perhaps because
he was always rather a strict kind of guy and liked the Montanist rules of per-
sonal discipline!
The idea here is that, in Montanus, the Christian church faced someone who
claimed to have more revelations (as opposed to Marcion arguing for less rev-
elation) and therefore the idea that the Montanists could, in theory, continue
to add more ideas to the Christian tradition. The creation of a canon raises
two very important questions:
 Can someone or anyone add new books to the canon?
 Where does the adding of scriptures for the Christians stop?
37
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons

What if Montanus had written books and claimed that they were “New Words”
from Jesus? How could the Christians respond to him if they didn’t have a set
list of books? So, Montanism and the Christian response to it furthered the
discussions about first locking into a canon and then protecting the teachings
of Jesus and the Apostles from later “prophets” who would try to add things.
In addition to “new words” — what about changed words of Jesus? What hap-
pens when people start to write their own versions of the sayings of Jesus?
This is the next challenge: Gnosticism.
Gnosticism
Sometime in the early third century, historians begin to see evidence of a new
teaching spreading among some Christians. It was a movement of people who
believed that they had secret knowledge about Christianity.
“Gnosticism” is derived from the Greek word “gnosis,” meaning “knowledge.”
In the 19th century, a German ancient history scholar coined the term
“Gnosticism” and applied it to this Christian movement, and the name stuck
even though the ancient Gnostics had other names for themselves, like “ones
with knowledge.”
Gnosticism seems to have emerged from certain Greek, and especially
Platonic, philosophical ideas about the importance of the spirit over the
material or body. Central to Gnostic beliefs is the notion that the material
world, the body, and all things one sees are ultimately not real or important.
Rather, the spirit is real, and people must not let the “apparent” world dis-
tract them from that fact.
According to the Gnostics, this material world was created by a lesser god,
not the “true God of spirit and light.” This thinking, of course, is a direct chal-
lenge to the importance of the Hebrew Bible. (It’s similar to Marcion’s chal-
lenge but is more philosophically based.) Gnostics further believed that
death liberated the spirit and therefore wasn’t bad at all! Even more, some
Gnostics also believed that Jesus wasn’t a real physical person and only
appeared that way because someone from the higher God of spirit and light
could only be pure spirit, not involved in this dirty world. Gnostics were
deeply offended at the idea that Jesus really suffered like a human would, and
most important, Christian Gnostics believed that Jesus taught secret knowl-
edge to only the select, the spiritual elite. Gnostics had very secretive groups
and even wrote their own scriptures to defend their ideas (see Chapter 12 for
more on Gnostic writings).
Truth be told, they were not above literally making up words of Jesus to
defend their views! Regardless of the quality of the content, Gnostics wrote a
lot, and thankfully many of their buried scriptures survived to be discovered
in Egypt in 1945 (specifically the Nag Hammadi Library, which we explore in
38
Part I: Setting the Stage 

Chapter 12). So, historians and scholars now understand a lot more about
Gnostic Christianity (and non-Christian Gnosticism, which was an even larger
movement) than they used to.
Obviously, Gnosticism presented a serious threat to early Christianity and its
relationship to the Hebrew Scriptures. With the increase in Gnostic writings
from the time, it seems clear that these writings eventually got the attention of
Christian leaders who carefully argued against them, revealing the truth about
them. There were even Gnostic writings that claimed to be “Gospels” — like
the recently recovered Gospel of Judas (which we discuss in Chapter 11). We
know it to be a Gnostic writing because of its ideas, like the fact that it deni-
grates the physical and praises death as a release from this world. The Gnostic
philosophy is the reason Judas is seen in this work as a hero — because his
actions released Jesus from his physical body! Weird? Absolutely. And many
early Christians clearly thought so, too.
Second-Century Debates 
on the Christian Bible
Eventually the Christians got around to drawing up lists of what they felt
should be considered their biblical canon. As we discuss in the previous sec-
tion, this list making was in part a reaction to various fringe groups of
Christians that began to crop up.
The formation of the Christian biblical canon really kicked into high gear in
the second century when some early Christian writers — Melito and Origen,
in particular — took a shot at it. The earlier discussions of particular books,
and shorter lists, all seem to lead to a final decision at the time of
Constantine and were followed by lots of final decisions from the different
Christian churches.
Note: From this point on, the Christian debates about their canon of the 
Bible becomes difficult to separate between Old Testament debates and New
Testament debates. So, to make matters a bit easier to follow, in this section,
we discuss the Christian formation of their Bible as a whole: Old and New
Testament.
Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria
defend the four Gospels
In addition to the highly controversial groups and movements that may have
pushed Christians to think about their important writings, some early
39
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons

Christian writers already in the second century (100–200 CE) were referring
to many of the books that would become part of the Christian Bible.
For example, Irenaeus (living around 120–200 CE) makes an interesting argu-
ment about why the Christians use four Gospels: He points to the four direc-
tions (east, west, north, and south) as clear evidence for why there should be
four Gospels! Okay, the argument seems silly, but at least he was defending
four Gospels! We know that there were others, so mentioning “four” means
that a list is clearly emerging; choices are being made.
Clement of Alexandria (150–around 216 CE) and Tertullian (155–230 CE) also
referred to four Gospels, and a second section of the Christian writings was
being based on a foundation of Paul’s letters. Historians have second-century
references to most of the writings that became part of the New Testament
and evidence of heavy use of the Greek translations of the Old Testament.
Athanasius outlines the Christian 
Bible in use today . . . almost
Athanasius’s Festal Letter of 367 CE is renowned as one of the clearest state-
ments of the Christian canon in possession, and Athanasius even uses the word
“canon” to boot! (A festal letter is a missive written on the occasion of important
festivals.) The nearby sidebar offers a lengthy excerpt from the letter.

The Muratorian Fragment: The oldest 
list of New Testament books?
Sometime around 1740, an Italian scholar
named Lodovico Antonio Muratori discovered
leaves of an old Latin text in a seventh to eighth
century CE codex (hand-written, bound book) in
a library in Milan.
Scholars soon determined that a very important
segment of this work was translated from Greek
and probably dated to about 180–200 CE. The
fragment includes a discussion of the books of
the New Testament and mentions “four
Gospels,” but it only names Luke and John. It
also mentions epistles of Paul, Peter, and John
as well as Revelation. Thus, the Muratorian
Fragment provides evidence of the existence of
these New Testament writings.
Even more interesting, the Muratorian Fragment
mentions “forged letters” of Paul, which the
writer attributes to Marcion (refer to the earlier
section “The influence of Marcion the Sinope”).
Because the document refers to the Shepherd
of Hermas as “written very recently” and schol-
ars date the Shepherd of Hermas to the first half
of the second century — Muratori’s Fragment
is dated late second century.
But not everyone agrees that the Fragment is
that old, and some even say it’s from the fifth
century. If it’s older, it suggests that the New
Testament canon (it doesn’t use that term, by
the way) was forming at that time but still wasn’t
absolutely certain.

41
Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons
An excerpt from Athanasius’s Festal Letter
“Since some few of the simple should be
beguiled from their simplicity and purity, by the
subtleties of certain men, and should hence-
forth read other books — those called
Apocryphal — led astray by the similarity of
their names with the true books; I beseech you
to bear patiently, if I also write, by way of
remembrance, of matters with which you are
acquainted, influenced by the need and advan-
tage of the Church.
In proceeding to make mention of these things . . .
it seemed good to me also, having been urged
thereto by true brethren, and having learned from
the beginning, to set before you the books included
in the Canon, and handed down, and accredited
as Divine; to the end that any one who has fallen
into error may condemn those who have led him
astray; and that he who has continued steadfast in
purity may again rejoice, having these things
brought to his remembrance.
There are, then, of the Old Testament, twenty-
two books in number; for, as I have heard, it is
handed down that this is the number of the let-
ters among the Hebrews; their respective order
and names being as follows. The first is
Genesis, then Exodus, next Leviticus, after that
Numbers, and then Deuteronomy. Following
these there is Joshua, the son of Nun, then
Judges, then Ruth. And again, after these four
books of Kings, the first and second being reck-
oned as one book, and so likewise the third and
fourth as one book. And again, the first and
second of the Chronicles are reckoned as one
book. Again Ezra, the first and second [Ezra and
Nehemiah] are similarly one book. After these
there is the book of Psalms, then the Proverbs,
next Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. Job
follows, then the Prophets, the twelve being
reckoned as one book. Then Isaiah, one book,
then Jeremiah with Baruch, Lamentations,
Baruch, the epistle, one book; afterwards,
Ezekiel and Daniel, each one book. Thus far
constitutes the Old Testament.
Again it is not tedious to speak of the [books] of
the New Testament. These are, the four Gospels,
according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
Afterwards, the Acts of the Apostles and
Epistles (called Catholic), seven, viz. [namely] of
James, one; of Peter, two; of John, three; after
these, one of Jude. In addition, there are four-
teen Epistles of Paul, written in this order. The
first, to the Romans; then two to the Corinthians;
after these, to the Galatians; next, to the
Ephesians; then to the Philippians; then to the
Colossians; after these, two to the Thessalonians,
and that to the Hebrews; and again, two to
Timothy; one to Titus; and lastly, that to Philemon.
And besides, the Revelation of John.
These are fountains of salvation, that they who
thirst may be satisfied with the living words they
contain. In these alone is proclaimed the doctrine
of godliness. Let no man add to these, neither let
him take ought from these. For concerning these
the Lord put to shame the Sadducees, and said,
‘Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures.’ And 
He reproved the Jews, saying, ‘Search the
Scriptures, for these are they that testify of Me.’
But for greater exactness I add this also, writing
of necessity; that there are other books besides
these not indeed included in the Canon, but
appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who
newly join us, and who wish for instruction in the
word of godliness. The Wisdom of Solomon, and
the Wisdom of Sirach, and Esther, and Judith,
and Tobit, and that which is called the Teaching
of the Apostles, and the Shepherd. But the
former, my brethren, are included in the Canon,
the latter being [merely] read; nor is there in any
place a mention of apocryphal writings. But they
are an invention of heretics, who write them
when they choose, bestowing upon them their
approbation, and assigning to them a date, that
so, using them as ancient writings, they may find
occasion to lead astray the simple.”
—Excerpt taken from the 39th Festal Letter

In his letter, Athanasius seems to have had an “A” list of books that he said
were central to his list, and a “B” list of other books that he also liked and
recommended, like Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Esther, Judith, Tobit, the
Christian book the Didache, the famous Shepherd of Hermas, and also the
book of Baruch in the Old Testament.
His famous Festal Letter is often quoted in debates about the emergence of
the Christian biblical canon.
Constantine settles the matter (sort of) 
at the Council of Nicea
While debates regarding books of the Bible raged, bigger things were happen-
ing also. Huge changes came over Christianity and the entire Roman Empire
in 313.
This was the time when Constantine, one of the most powerful warriors of
ancient Rome, was trying to consolidate his rule over the entire Empire.
When he tried to return to Rome to solidify his power as Caesar and Lord of
all the Roman Empire, he faced a larger army already stationed in Rome. As
he crossed the famous Malvern Bridge in 312 CE, Constantine apparently had
a vision in which he was shown a symbol and assured that “with this symbol,
you will be victorious.” The symbol was apparently a form of the Christian
cross, and Constantine painted it on the shields of his soldiers and created
crosslike symbols for the soldiers to carry into battle. When Constantine was
victorious, he came to believe that he had been called by the Christian God
to rule Rome.
Christianity was gaining its most militarily powerful convert ever! As soon as
Constantine came to power over the Roman Empire, he passed the “Edict of
Toleration” in 313, making it illegal to persecute Christians. In short order,
however, Christianity also received lots of royal favors — new buildings built
at royal expense, protection for Christian leaders, and Roman power behind
Christian gatherings to settle long-simmering issues. In short, Constantine
worked to make Christianity the central religion of the Roman Empire.
Whether he was genuinely interested in the teachings of Jesus or not (and
we’ll try to resist being too cynical about this question), Constantine was 
definitely a good Roman soldier and thus was interested in what Roman
Caesars were always interested in: absolute power and absolute stability of
his Empire. It just wouldn’t do to have the Christian leaders of his new
“Imperial Religion” arguing with each other over trivial matters. He had an
Empire to run! So, Constantine called an official Council of the Church at
Nicea in 325 CE (see Figure 2-1 for an artist’s rendering of this historic event).
42
Part I: Setting the Stage 

© Bettmann/Corbis
Part of the debates at this Council was over the Bible. Eusebius, who has sup-
plied most of information about all these events in possession (including his
highly favorable opinions of Constantine), records that Constantine appears
to have imposed his power behind the present canon of the Bible that included
the Apocryphal books in the Christian Old Testament. Thus, the results of
Nicea are evident in the fact that, soon after, confident lists were written, such
as the Festal Letter of Athanasius in 367 CE (refer to the preceding section).
In fact, when Constantine made the interesting decision to shift his capital to
Constantinople (modern Istanbul), he decided to commission 50 copies of
the Bible for the churches in his new capital city. Clearly the decision to com-
mission these Bibles was part of Constantine’s influence in finally settling the
issue of the canon.
Modern churches follow with 
final statements of their own
By the end of the fourth century, the Christian canon was settled more or 
less for western Christians (for example, the “Roman” Catholic Church). Still,

Chapter 2: Tracing the History of the Jewish and Christian Biblical Canons

Christians often gathered for great councils to debate and discuss important
religious subjects, including the canon.
These councils are usually named for the city where they took place. The
Council held in Laodicea (perhaps around 363 CE) discussed the books of the
Bible, but the results probably resembled the Festal Letter of Athanasius.
Finally, however, the Council at Hippo, influenced by the famous early
Christian theologian St. Augustine, met in 393 and also determined a list and
made a formal pronouncement. But did this pronouncement really settle the
matter of the Christian canon? Apparently not, because modern churches
have felt the need to also make final statements! Here’s a rundown of more
modern developments:
 The Roman Catholic Church didn’t finally and officially set its canon of
the Bible until 1546! It took place at the famous Council of Trent cen-
turies after the time of Jesus. The Roman Catholic Church’s canon,
which remains in place today, includes the standard Jewish list of the
Hebrew Bible, plus the Deutero-Canonical books and the standard list of
the New Testament.
 The Greek Orthodox Church finally established its official canon in 1950
(yes, 1950) and included 2 Ezra and 3 Maccabees, with 4 Maccabees
printed in an appendix in the Bible.
 Protestantism is thought to have started with Martin Luther (1483–1546),
so the various Protestant groups established their canons after his time.
Martin Luther famously determined that his movement would adopt the
Jewish canon, which is why the Jewish Hebrew Bible and Luther’s Old
Testament differ only slightly in arrangement, but contain the same 
writings.
 The Reform churches (for example, the churches emerging from John
Calvin’s traditions, such as Presbyterian churches and many Baptist
churches) established their present canon in the late 16th century. Calvin
endorses the same canon as Luther, which is why all Protestants in the
modern world have the same books of their Bible.
In any case, it should be clear that if you want to understand the canon of the
Christian Bible (both Old and New Testaments) and even the Jewish Hebrew
Bible, you have to recognize that their creations were slow processes.
Nobody’s canon dropped from the sky ready-made!

The Different Categories of
Ancient Religious Writing
In This Chapter
 Organizing ancient religious writings
 Defining the styles of Old Testament books
 Understanding the types of writing in the New Testament
 Envisioning a tumultuous future in apocalyptic writings
A
ncient religious writings are commonly grouped into accepted “styles.”
When studying the “lost” writings, it’s necessary to understand these
various styles in order to use a common vocabulary and identify individual
omitted texts by their type.
In this chapter, you discover the various styles and patterns that ancient
Jewish and Christian religious writing tend to follow. This is very helpful
information because it allows you to identify, classify, and better understand
the other writings that weren’t included in the Bible as you know it today.
We use these classifications throughout this book as we look at the lost books
of the Bible, so you may want to check back in with this chapter as you read
to refresh your memory of the classifications.
The Hows and Whys of Organizing
Ancient Writings into Style Categories
Ancient religious texts are defined by the kind of writings they contain. These
styles include poetry, gospels, apocalyptic writings, and more. Modern bibli-
cal scholars have not created these various styles and categories of religious

writings out of whole cloth, but they’ve worked to refine the categories to
make them more helpful for organizing ancient texts.
Scholars know with certainty that some stylistic structures and creation of
categories of religious writing began in the ancient world. In the days before
the Bible, and even in the days before Jesus, the Jews used important styles
of religious writings over and over. As certain ancient writings among the
Jews became increasingly popular, they began to be arranged together and
increasingly mentioned together in groups.
For example, the Bible has more than one list of the “Laws of Moses” — one
at Exodus 20, another at Deuteronomy 5 — which is why there are actually
two versions of the iconic Ten Commandments. Books that contain laws in
the Hebrew Bible were organized together. All the laws of ancient Israel, no
matter when they became laws, are grouped together in the first five books 
of the Bible.
Similarly, the books of the various Prophets evolved into a collection as well.
Over 150 years before the time of Jesus, the shorter Prophetic scrolls like
Amos, Hosea, Nahum, and Obadiah are called simply The Twelve.
In the ancient period before the Bible became a set number of books, or a
canon, these writings were already being sorted or organized by their style
and content. Law books were kept together; prophetic books were kept
together; and poetry books, including Psalms, the Song of Solomon, and
others, also tended to be kept together. The Christian tradition even tended
to sort all “history-sounding” writings together as well, which is why Samuel,
Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah are all together in the Christian Old
Testament.
Fortunately for you and your understanding of all the different descriptions
of lost books or other writings discussed in this book, modern scholars have
fine-tuned the definitions of these styles.
How does one determine a style?
Styles of ancient Jewish and Christian works are determined by a variety of
factors. The imagery used, the language used (sometimes right down to the
specific words used), and the ideas expressed all contribute to assigning 
a specific writing to a particular style or genre of religious writing. In ancient
Jewish writing, for example, laws are virtually impossible to confuse with 
stories or parables. In the New Testament, it’s hard to confuse “Gospel” with
“Epistle/Letter.” Knowing these styles makes it much easier to assign lesser
known works to a particular category.

Using style as a tool for 
studying the lost books
You may be thinking to yourself, “Okay, so biblical books fall into style cate-
gories. So what?”
Finding out about these various style forms of ancient Jewish and Christian
religious writing is a tremendous help when it comes to reading books that
aren’t in the Bible. When you know the styles, you begin to recognize that
these books most certainly do follow a style — often the same style as the
books that are in the Bible. The styles place the writings within a context,
both historical and literary, and provide insights into the minds of their 
creators.
Knowing the patterns and styles of biblical literature helps you sort out what
a non-biblical book is trying to be. Here are some possibilities:
 Is it attempting to be a letter in the style of Paul’s letters?
 Is it attempting to be a Gospel like Matthew or Luke?
 Is it attempting to be a Prophetic speech like Micah, Jeremiah, or Isaiah?
When trying to assess whether something is a valid piece of potential
Scriptural writing, it helps to know what the writer was hoping to accom-
plish. For instance, suppose you’re an early Christian (play along, okay?), and
you believe that you have something important to say about Jesus. Odds are
you’ll want to write a Gospel — the typical kind of Christian writing about
Jesus — because you’ll know that the form will almost guarantee a reader-
ship, and your message, narrative, speculation, or advice will be heard.
In case you’re wondering, these lost books were not rejected from the Bible
because they broke the rules for ancient religious writing. They aren’t “tech-
nically defective,” so to speak. Rather, writings are rejected because of their
content and ideas. The issue is “orthodoxy,” not “fashion”!
Surveying Styles of Religious 
Writing in the Old Testament
The variety of Old Testament religious book styles is, in a sense, a response
to the times and the needs of the people. When a culture is floundering, or at
47
Chapter 3: The Different Categories of Ancient Religious Writing

least searching for answers, books of laws, wisdom, and allegorical stories fill
the void.
There was undeniable social, cultural, political, and religious instability in 
the days the Old Testament books were written — especially beginning in the
late eighth century and continuing under the conquering armies of Assyria,
Babylon, and Persia. The writings were an attempt to provide answers and
balance.
In this section, we survey these various styles of writings in the Hebrew Bible,
explaining each category and listing which books fall into which category.
Please keep in mind that even the following assignment of styles is not uni-
versally agreed upon in every detail by religious scholars and historians. The
experts have disagreements regarding specific definitions of each style, as
well as what should and should not be included in individual “lost” canons.
But for purposes of our discussion, these categories are more than adequate.
Law
Typically, historians refer to law “codes” in the ancient world (a code in
ancient writing is simply a body of laws). In order to be defined as a law code,
the text must be a listing of laws, often (but not always) organized by subject
and typically written in a set form in the ancient world.
In the Bible, laws are typically written in two forms, the Apodictic and
Casuistic forms:
 Apodictic laws: These are laws written as if God is speaking directly, as
in “You shall not. . . .”
 Casuistic laws: These follow the classic form of ancient law: “If (or
“when”) X, then Y.” For example, Leviticus 6:1–5 contains the following
casuistic law: “When any of you sin and commit a trespass against the
Lord by deceiving a neighbor in a matter of a deposit or a pledge, or by
robbery, or if you have defrauded a neighbor . . . you shall repay the
principal amount and shall add one-fifth to it.”
It’s also common for explanations to follow the actual laws in the text. For
example, Exodus 21:28 is a law about an ox that gores someone. But the
verses that follow include more details that a judge or elder must examine in
order to come to a decision about what to do about the ox (for example, has
it done this before?).
48
Part I: Setting the Stage 

Scholars don’t have any lost books of the Laws of Moses — at least not yet.
(They’re still looking.) They do have the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy,
which include all the known laws of Moses (far more than the famous Ten
Commandments, of course). So, a newly discovered collection of more laws
from the Jewish tradition would be quite interesting to find.
Words to the wise: The Wisdom Books
When we speak of “wisdom,” we mean something different than book knowl-
edge. Wisdom is the result of experience, which is why people tend to ask
elders for advice that they hope is wise advice.
The Hebrew Bible has three classic books known as Wisdom Books that pass
on knowledge gained from human experience. These are
 The Proverbs
 Ecclesiastes
 Job
The Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible (begun around 250–200 BC) adds
two more Wisdom Books:
 Sirach
 The Wisdom of Solomon
The Wisdom Books have three specific characteristics that make identifying
them as such quite simple. They are as follows:
 The word “wisdom”: The word is used predominantly in these books to
describe what they’re talking about: wise advice designed to provide a
life lesson. The word “wisdom” isn’t used to describe laws, for example,
or the speeches of prophets.
In Hebrew, the word “wisdom” is hokma. This is the source of the popu-
lar Arabic name “Hakim” from the same Semitic language root.
 The “compare and contrast” instructional adage: In addition to the
standard form of a proverb, which is a short saying intended to commu-
nicate brief but profound lessons for life, the Wisdom books also employ
an Israelite wisdom technique known as the comparison or contrast
49
Chapter 3: The Different Categories of Ancient Religious Writing

that’s pretty easy to spot. (Jesus used this teaching style occasionally as
well.) Here are some examples:
• “The wise of heart will heed commandments, but a babbling fool
will come to ruin.” (Proverbs 10:8)
• “The wise are cautious and turn away from evil, but the fool throws
off restraint and is careless.” (Proverbs 14:16)
 The illustrative parable: Parables are model stories that praise the
wisdom and foresight of the central character (for example, Ecclesiastes
9:13-16 is a short little tale of a wise man saving an entire city).
Incidentally, the parables of Jesus are often considered stories modeled
on the ancient Hebrew form of wisdom stories used to teach people
proper behavior and attitudes. In other words, when Jesus told these
stories, his followers would have recognized the style of his storytelling
from older books of wisdom and wisdom stories.
Back to the past: The historical narratives
Some examples of Old Testament historical books include:
 Joshua
 Judges
 The two books of Samuel
 The two books of Kings
 The two books of Chronicles
 Ezra
 Nehemiah

Part I: Setting the Stage 
Reaching across style lines: The book of Daniel
The stories of the book of Daniel are often con-
sidered wisdom stories because, in the text,
Daniel and his three friends are praised for their
great acumen and because the words “wise”
and “wisdom” are used throughout. Yet, Daniel
isn’t considered a Wisdom book and is usually
grouped with the apocalyptic texts due to its
dominant visionary content.
Daniel is an unusual book in that it has two rad-
ically different styles. Chapters 1–6 are the
famous stories, including the story of Daniel in
the lion’s den. But Chapters 7–12 radically shift
gears into apocalyptic visions. Most scholars
question if they came from the same hand; it
seems clear that the apocalyptic visions were
added to the stories at a later date.

These books are all written in the form of a historical narrative, meaning that
their main purpose seems to be a survey of events over a period of time.
In ancient Hebrew writing, historical writing isn’t necessarily an objective
recounting of historical events. Like all historical writing, the ancient
Hebrews put a spin on their telling in order to teach profound ideas, pass
judgment on bad characters and their behavior, and praise the exemplary
behavior of their “good” characters.
For example, check out this basic fact, followed by a judgment:
In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah began to reign
over all Israel at Tirzah; he reigned twenty-four years. He did what was evil
in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of Jeroboam and in the sin that
he caused Israel to commit.
—1 Kings 15:33–34
The Prophets weigh in
Prophetic books in the Hebrew Bible consist of collections of the sayings of a
Prophet. These sayings are typically gathered into speeches, or what biblical
scholars refer to as oracles.
Prophetic books include larger writings such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel,
and shorter books such as Amos, Hosea, and even Obadiah, which is only
one chapter long!
Typically, a Prophet speech begins with the all-important messenger formula,
which may be expressed as “Thus Says the Lord,” “God says,” or something
else along these lines. Then the Prophetic speech is written as if God is speak-
ing because the Prophet is communicating to the people as literally a messen-
ger from God. Check out this formula in Amos, where Amos speaks for God
after the initial phrase:
Thus says the Lord:
For three transgressions of Israel
And for four, I will not revoke the punishment
—Amos 2:6
Some prophetic books consist mostly of sayings from the Prophet, like Amos
or Hosea or even shorter books like Nahum or Habakkuk. But some prophetic
books contain historical narrative also, even describing some aspects of the
life of the Prophet.
51

Once upon a time: Stories and legends
Truth be told, stories and legends is a rather dangerous category. Why?
Because for some people, the very idea that the Bible contains stories that
aren’t intended to be factual, literal history is troublesome, and many reject
the notion completely.
But it’s clear that some stories in the Bible are just that — stories. One exam-
ple is Jotham’s Fable in Chapter 9 of Judges, in which olive trees, fig trees, and
grapevines talk and express a powerful message, which is the purpose of the
story.
Although it’s true that it’s sometimes hard to see the line between what is
intended to be a story and what’s now believed to be a story, the fact remains
that the Bible contains stories. Jesus told many stories with messages, and
yet, for example, people don’t worry about whether the Good Samaritan was
real because they understand that it’s part of a story intended to teach a
message about generosity of spirit and treating others as you would like to 
be treated.
Writings often suggested as pious stories include the Joseph tales in Genesis
37–50, Daniel, Esther, Jonah, and Ruth. In the little story of Ruth, undoubtedly
told to challenge certain negative attitudes toward Moabites, the opening line
even sounds like a story: “In the days when the judges ruled, there was famine
in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the coun-
try of Moab” (Ruth 1:1). There isn’t much specificity here because it doesn’t
really matter to the point of the story.
52
Part I: Setting the Stage 
Why is it important to acknowledge 
the fiction in the Bible?
When studying books not included in the New
Testament, you come to writings that describe
events in the lives of Jesus, Paul, or Peter.
Sometimes, these writings have storylike ele-
ments, such as people flying through the air, a
lion speaking to Paul, and so on, that raise 
the question of whether these were stories 
told by some early Christians as educational
entertainment — like Christian folklore.
Accepting the idea of intentionally fictional bib-
lical folklore is much easier than accepting the
existence of false claims about what really 
happened. With writings with storylike ele-
ments, you have to decide if such stories were
excluded from the Bible because they recount
events that never really happened or because
Church leaders didn’t like the messages of the
stories, even if the leaders knew that they were
just stories. In any case, trying to decide what
was originally intended to be a story is usually
tricky business. Welcome to the world of bibli-
cal scholarship!

Poetry
The Hebrew Bible also contains poetry books. These poems can be deeply
religious, like the famous Book of Psalms, or they can be entertaining and
even erotic love poetry, like the Song of Solomon. (If the Song of Solomon
were translated literally — as it rarely is — and if ratings were assigned to
books, it would no doubt be rated “R.”):
How fair and pleasant you are
O loved one, delectable maiden!
You are stately as a palm tree,
And your breasts are like its clusters
I say I will climb the palm tree
And lay hold of its branches
O may your breasts be like clusters of the vine
—Song of Solomon 7:6–8
In the category of religious poetry like the Psalms, you find many kinds of
poems — such as poems of great sadness or “laments” (Psalm 44), poems of
celebration (Psalm 46), or even poems of learning history (like Psalms
105–106, a poetic history of Israel). But how does anyone know what Hebrew
poetry is?
The key to recognizing Hebrew poetry is parallelism. The poetry doesn’t
always rhyme or have a set pattern, but typically the two (sometimes three)
lines have a very close relationship called parallelism. Parallelism may be
indicated by lines repeating the same idea in slightly different words or
saying the opposite of each other. You also may notice an inherent “beat” as
you read it aloud. Consider this example:
Why do the nations conspire,
and the peoples plot in vain?
—Psalm 2:1
The parallelism is seen in the fact that “nations” and “peoples” are the same,
and “conspire” and “plot in vain” are also the same. In this case, virtually the
same idea is stated in two different forms.
Most of the time, it’s easy to spot parallelism in Hebrew poetry, allowing you
to quickly identify it as poetry and not narrative or normal speech patterns.
Some poems were sung (it’s possible that most were intended to be sung),
but not all of them. Scholars believe that some poems had an educational
purpose, and if they were sung, it was along the lines of an educational song
like the ones commonly used on Sesame Street to teach children.

The New Testament Styles 
of Religious Writing
The styles of writing in the New Testament are simpler and somewhat more
accessible than the types of books in the Old Testament. They break down
into the three following categories:
 Gospels
 Acts
 Epistles
This section looks at all three of these styles and their identifying 
characteristics.
The Jesus tales: The Gospels
One of the most interesting questions that New Testament scholars often dis-
cuss is a deceptively simple one: What is a Gospel?
The word “gospel” is a translation of a Greek word meaning, simply, “good
news.” The question seems so simple because a few examples of Gospels are
available, so one is tempted to point to one and say, “There, that is a Gospel.”
But then the issue gets a bit more complicated with a follow-up question:
How do you know a Gospel when you see one? If a writing tells stories about
Jesus’s life, and also includes his Teachings, it’s a Gospel. The four examples
from the Bible — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John — exemplify perfectly the
quintessential religious Gospel.
The discussion starts getting interesting when you consider where the early
Christians got the idea for a Gospel. Many historians aren’t certain that the
Gospel form had any precedents. In fact, one prominent theory is that the
earliest Christians quite simply invented it. Some modern historians suggest
that the Gospels in the New Testament can be compared to the short biogra-
phies written by the Greek writer Diogenes in The Lives of the Philosophers in
200 CE. The problems with this theory are twofold: Diogenes came after the
biblical Gospels, and his biographies didn’t include the teachings of the
philosophers, as the Gospels do. In the end, you don’t really need to know
where the concept of the Gospel came from in order to appreciate the form
and recognize its important role in the New Testament.
54
Part I: Setting the Stage 

In Chapter 13, we tell you about the few gospels written that were not
included in the New Testament, and you discover that sometimes the term
“gospel” is used for any book that purports to talk about Jesus or the sayings
of Jesus.
Stories of early Christians: The Acts
The idea behind the Acts books is to show how the first followers of Jesus
carry on what Jesus started. That’s why Acts shows the Apostles doing mira-
cles like Jesus and teaching about Jesus: acting and preaching like Jesus did.
So, any early Christian writings that claim to give more information about
some of the first followers of Jesus are often called Acts, like Acts of Peter or
Acts of Paul. They’re modeled on the general idea of the Bible’s Acts of the
Apostles.
In general, the Acts-type literature of the early Christians is often compared
to the historical section of the Hebrew Bible, although there are some impor-
tant differences. Acts, nevertheless, is the main source of information about
what happened to the very first followers of Jesus and how the Christian
movement took root.
Not-so-breaking-news (although this may be new news to many): The book in
the Bible known as Acts of the Apostles was written by the same guy who
wrote the Gospel of Luke. In fact, Acts is the second part of a two-part project
of which Luke was the first installment. It’s notable that the early Christians
located Acts right after the four Gospels. The early Christians had to inten-
tionally break apart Luke and Acts in order to achieve the present arrange-
ment. Why they broke it apart is anyone’s guess — perhaps to emphasize the
similarity of the Gospels? Or to model the New Testament after the Old
Testament, with historical books following “Laws of Moses”?
As I write this letter: The Epistles
One of the most unique forms of literature used by the early Christians was
the Epistle, or letter. This is an interesting form of writing in that it vividly
depicts and reflects the lives and times of the first Christians. There are lots
of Epistles, of course: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Colossians, Ephesians,
Philippians, Thessalonians — all of which are called by the name of the
addressee (for example, the church in Corinth, the church in Rome, and 
so on).
55
Chapter 3: The Different Categories of Ancient Religious Writing

Christianity grew under the yoke of the Roman Empire. In addition to commit-
ting horrific acts of violence and taxing people nearly to death, Rome built
roads and maintained communications along these roads. Letters were an
obvious and important form of communication between the far-flung loca-
tions where Christianity grew in the empire.
The important thing about ancient letters is that they have a definite form
that consists of three main parts:
1. The author
2. The persons to whom the author is speaking
3. A greeting
Consider the beginning of three different writings in the New Testament by
the Apostle Paul:
 “Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are
in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from
God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Ephesians 1:1–2)
 “Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our
brother Sosthenes, To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who
are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those
who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their
Lord and ours: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 1:1–3)
 “Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ
Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: Grace to 
you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”
(Philippians 1:1–2)
Paul writes letters, which also all end with a similar pattern, too: Usually Paul
finishes his letters with personal greetings to or from specific people if he
knows someone, and gives a final blessing.
Paul is just one example of Epistles that follow the styles and rules for letter
writing in the ancient world, and he rarely changes his style.
In a Class All Their Own: 
Apocalyptic Writings
The people living in the ancient lands of Palestine, Egypt, and Mesopotamia
couldn’t just flip on the TV set and watch Star Trek when they wanted to see
56
Part I: Setting the Stage 

what a possible future world may look like. But they most certainly did dream
about the future, and they also wrote about it — a lot!
We can say this because great quantities of their writings have survived 
from the ancient world, including lots of visions of the future that were writ-
ten by ancient Jewish writers. However, these visions weren’t accepted into
the Hebrew Bible, nor did the early Christians accept them as part of the 
Old Testament.
These ancient Jewish visions of the future are apocalyptic writings. This is
arguably one of the most important styles of religious literature because so
much non-biblical writing is apocalyptic visions. If Wisdom books look back
to the experience of elders and the past (see the earlier section, “Words to
the wise: The Wisdom Books,” for an explanation), then one could say that
apocalyptic books look to a revealed future for knowledge.
In this section, we look at what makes a work “apocalyptic,” where such writ-
ings can be found in the Bible, and what are their characteristics.
What makes it apocalyptic?
“Apocalypse” is a Greek word that literally means “revelation.” One of the
most famous apocalyptic books in the Christian Bible is the New Testament
book known as the book of Revelation. The real title of this book, however, is
the Apocalypse of John.
Revelation begins with brief letters to seven churches in Asia Minor (all now
in modern Turkey) but then launches into the visions of John, revealed to
him (he says) by Jesus. The rest of the book consists of John’s narration of
these visions of judgment of the earth, leading up to a great spiritual battle
between Jesus and Satan.
The other apocalyptic book that made it into the Bible isn’t really a whole
book, but part of one. The book of Daniel is divided into two sections:
wisdom stories of Daniel and his friends in the first half, typically counted as
Chapters 1–6; and a series of strange visions in Chapters 7–12.
But the category of apocalyptic books also can include a whole group of
books that have a similar style and feel to Revelation and Daniel 7–12 but that
weren’t included in the Bible.
Some genuine, genuinely strange mysteries surround these apocalyptic writ-
ings, one of which is their abundance. Apocalyptic writing was clearly a very
popular form of literature that interested many ancient people (many modern
people, too, for that matter), and it’s clear that a large number of people took
57
Chapter 3: The Different Categories of Ancient Religious Writing

it very seriously. Is there some kind of code to understanding apocalyptic
writing? What did the ancients see in this stuff? The following sections pose
some answers to these questions.
The apocalyptic writing in the Bible
Professor John J. Collins explains that there are really two different kinds of
apocalyptic writing that one can identify among the dozens of examples:
 Otherworldly journeys: Descriptions of strange places in heaven or hell
 Historic symbolism: Descriptions of strange events and happenings that
are intended to be symbolic of events that are going to occur in the real
world
Both Revelation in the New Testament and Daniel 7–12 in the Old Testament
are apocalyptic writings that fall under the historic symbolism category.
Characteristics of apocalyptic literature
Apocalyptic literature has personality traits, so to speak, and these common
elements appear in the writings consistently and repeatedly. Here’s a look at
the eight most common facets of apocalyptica, to coin a term.
 Turmoil: Apocalyptic writings are written in a style emphasizing spiri-
tual and social turmoil. Things aren’t right in the world, and the writer
expresses a great sense of unrest.
 Urgency: Apocalyptic writings have a sense of urgency, implying that
the changes coming in the world (or the entire cosmos) are coming very
soon. When you read these writings, try to imagine a very excited and
agitated voice reading them aloud.
 The end is coming!: Apocalyptic writing writes as if history — the world
the writer and readers know — is coming to an end and the present cir-
cumstances are going to change.
 But it will be great!: In many apocalyptic writings, the end that’s coming
will be followed by one more step: the new paradise. Beyond the coming
catastrophes is a new reality.
 Let me explain . . . : One of the really interesting parts of apocalyptic
writings is the presence of a heavenly being who is willing to explain the
strange and frightening visions.
58
Part I: Setting the Stage 

 What is that?: Typically, apocalyptic writings describe visions that are
populated by strange and alarming beasts, such as multiheaded dragons
and animals that combine features from different species.
 We’ve seen this before, haven’t we?: It seems clear that apocalyptic
writers read each other’s work because many of the strange images and
beasts appear in many different apocalyptic works.
 Who wrote this!?: Apocalyptic writings are typically written under a
pseudonym, or false name. This is usually thought to be for two reasons:
because apocalyptic writing is usually hotly political, often very critical
of present regimes and governments; and because the naming of these
books borrows the fame of older biblical characters.
Why did people write (and read) 
this stuff?
It’s possible that the oldest apocalyptic writings, and maybe including Daniel
7–12 in the Bible, were actually based on strange visions that the writers
experienced. But it’s equally clear that many apocalyptic books seem to have
been written intentionally — that is, written in the style of apocalyptic litera-
ture. Thus, scholars can say that it became a literary style. But why? What is
it about the apocalyptic style that appealed to Hebrews in the ancient world?
The appeal boils down to the mood and thinking of these books: The times
are bad, God is going to bring about change, and the change is coming very
soon (thank goodness!). It’s clear that many of the apocalyptic writings arose
in circumstances of oppression when Jews had to live under the brutal eco-
nomic and political policies of the Persians, Greeks, or Romans.
Ultimately, scholars and historians think that most of these visionary stories
were really hopeful reassurances that God is with the people, and especially
that God wasn’t losing control of world events that may have seemed out of
control.

called the “Apocryphal books.” These books are
the writings that Jews and Protestant Christians don’t
include in their Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, but that
Catholics and Orthodox Christians do. Technically, they
aren’t “lost,” but because most Protestants don’t know
much about them, we include them here.
In this part, we also cover some sacred writings from
Jewish writers before and after Jesus that nobody
included in their Bible. (Take note that we identify these
books by the kinds of religious literature outlined in 
Part I.) The fact that they didn’t make it into the Old
Testament (or New Testament) doesn’t mean that the
books in this part are “bad books”; many of them have
good, strong messages and were big hits in the early cen-
turies. These are the books that hardly anyone knows
about except historians who specialize in this kind of
stuff. But why should they have all the fun? After all, most
of these writings are in English and just waiting for you to

M
ost readers of the Bible don’t take long to figure out that some Bibles
have more books than others. What is going on here?
Put simply, the canons of different churches — that is, the authoritative lists
of books that are endorsed by church officials as writings that can be used to
determine faith and theology (see Chapter 2) — are, well, different.
In this chapter, we take a look at a group of writings that did make it into the
Catholic and Orthodox Old Testament, but did not make it into the Hebrew
Bible or Old Testament of Protestant Christians. (To this day, Catholic and
Protestant Old Testaments are still different in this regard.) We also look at
some reasons why some groups decided to include them, and why others 
did not.
Getting to Know the Apocryphal 
Books of Jewish History
After Alexander the Great started conquering throughout the ancient Near
East in 333 BCE, Greek started to become the “language of the Empire.” As
Jews spread to different parts of Alexander’s great conquests, they slowly
began to adopt Greek as the language most people could understand outside
the Jewish homeland. So, as they continued to write religious works, some of
these writings were composed in Greek, but all of them are now known in
only Greek editions. Some of them may have been written in Hebrew origi-
nally, but what’s in possession today is mainly Greek. All these materials
come from later Jewish history but are still before the time of Christianity.

In this section, we survey these important books that compose what’s now
called the Apocrypha (from the Greek word “hidden”) but what the Catholic
Church refers to as Deutero-Canonical Books (“Deutero” means “second,” so
the term probably suggests “Secondary Canonical”).
What are these books and where 
did they come from?
The Apocryphal books include the following:
 Tobit
 Judith
 Additions to Esther (often cited as Esther 10:4–16:24)
 Wisdom
 Ben Sira, also called Sirach or Ecclesiasticus
 Baruch, including the Letter of Jeremiah
 Additions to Daniel:
• Song of the Three Children
• Story of Susanna
• Bel and the Dragon
 1 Maccabees
 2 Maccabees
 3 Maccabees
 4 Maccabees
 1 and 2 Esdras
 Psalm 151
These writings come from the Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible. In fact,
these books originated in the Jewish project to translate the older Hebrew/
Aramaic writings of their tradition into Greek, starting in the late third cen-
tury BCE. But as they worked, they started to include writings written nearer
to their own time, and some works continued to be written and added.
(Remember, there wasn’t a set canon yet, so why shouldn’t they have kept
adding more?) The result of their translation efforts is normally referred to as
the Septuagint (pronounced sep-two-a-gint or sep-two-gint; see the nearby
sidebar for what this means).
64
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

A source of controversy
Christians appear to have routinely included the Septuagint among their
sacred scriptures, and the New Testament quotes or alludes to some of these
writings, suggesting that Christians were well aware of them and read them.
In fact, when the early Christians eventually created the canon of the Old
Testament, these Apocryphal books were included.
This is not to say, however, that early Christians weren’t aware of the works’
status as later writings. For example, Jerome (347–420 CE) was a famous early
Christian who was responsible for producing a Latin translation of the Bible
for Christians (known as the Vulgate). Although Jerome used both Hebrew
and Greek originals to produce his Latin translation, he included the
Apocryphal books, which he very consciously identified as “secondary,” and
he even used the term “Apocrypha” to describe them.
Christianity had always used and read these Apocryphal books, but the
actual decisions about whether to consider them sacred scripture — that is,
to include them in official canons — faced continued debate in Christian his-
tory. See the next section for more on how Jews, Protestants, Catholics, and
Orthodox Christians view these books.

Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha
The Septuagint and the meaning 
behind the number 70
“Septuagint” literally means “70” in Greek. Why
70? One theory is based on an ancient legend
recorded in a writing known as the Letter of
Aristeas (from around 150–100 BCE). It tells the
story that Ptolemy II of Egypt, one of the rulers
who lived after Alexander the Great’s con-
quests, wanted a copy of the Jewish scriptures
for his great library in Alexandria. He commis-
sioned six Jewish scholars from each of the
Twelve Tribes of Israel to translate the Bible into
Greek, and those 72 scribes were cut to 70, thus
the Septuagint.
It’s a good story, but most scholars and historians
don’t buy it. Regardless of the origin, the name
stuck and is always used today. Furthermore,
there seem to be different versions of the Greek
translations as well, so there isn’t just one single
form of the Septuagint. Modern scholars have
tried to combine all the versions into one “critical
edition,” which is the version used by students of
the Greek Bible today.

How different faiths view these works
What’s the main difference between Catholic and Orthodox Christian readers
on the one hand, and Protestant Christian and Jewish readers on the other
hand? The difference is their opinion about the importance of this collection
of these writings.
The Jewish view
Although all Jews read and knew these later writings in the century before
Jesus and the first century CE (and they still know all about them), it appears
clear that the Jewish communities never used these additional writings to the
extent that the Christians did.
There’s little evidence of much debate in Jewish sources about including the
writings in any official list of scripture. However, even if these writings aren’t
part of the Jewish canon of the Hebrew Bible, there’s widespread Jewish
appreciation for the stories in the Apocryphal books as fine examples of
Jewish storytelling, such as in Judith (seen as a heroine of the faith for her
courage) and Tobit (deeply committed to his faith even in a foreign land).
Bottom line: The Jewish tradition has no significant religious use for these
books because they’re seen as, at best, pious stories with highly doubtful 
historical roots, and they’re also long after the days of Ezra, who is seen as 
a traditional authority for bringing together sacred writings (see Chapter 2
for more on Ezra’s role in the formation of the Hebrew Bible).
The Protestant view
If you want to say that Protestants all agree on anything, be prepared for a
fight. After all, you’re dealing with Protestants: Protest is what they do.
Most Protestant Christians believe that Catholic and orthodox Christians
should never have adopted these Apocryphal books in their Bible because
Martin Luther felt that they had questionable religious value. Thus, Luther,
noting that Jerome already referred to later Jewish writings as “Apocryphal,”
felt free to remove them from his suggested list of biblical books for his
movement, which grew into the Protestant Reformation in Europe.
In fact, ol’ Marty was rather cavalier about all previous official canons and
muttered a number of unkind remarks about some of the New Testament
books that he didn’t much like, either (James comes to mind. Luther called it
an “epistle of straw!” because he didn’t like its very Jewish emphasis on
doing acts of faith). But eventually his movement decided not to remove
them from its canon. Conveniently, Luther then adopted the Jewish list of
books, which is why the generally agreed-upon Protestant canon of the
Christian Old Testament consists of precisely the same books as the Hebrew
Bible — although in a somewhat different order.
66
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Protestantism in general exists after the 16th century, but the dates of the
official canonical lists of the Bible are obviously later. The Church of England
(Episcopalians or Anglicans) affirmed their canon in 1563, and the Calvinist
traditions (known as “Reformed” traditions, such as the Presbyterian and
Baptist traditions) affirmed their canon in the Westminster Confession of
1647.
Bottom line: In general, Protestants assign canonical status only to those
books that also appear in the Jewish canon of the Hebrew Bible, and
Protestants reject the status assigned to the Apocryphal books in both
Catholic and orthodox traditions.
The Catholic view
Basing their canonical decision on a variety of early Christian witnesses but
definitely also on Jerome’s Latin Vulgate, which quickly became the Bible of
choice in the Western Catholic tradition, the Roman Catholic Church contin-
ued to produce Bibles over the centuries that included the Apocryphal
books, often situated between the Old Testament and New Testament.
However, this list wasn’t official until the stunningly recent date: 1545! 
This was the Nineteenth Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church, usually
referred to as the Council of Trent. Famously, Trent was the Council called to
respond to the growing challenges of Protestantism in Christian Europe, and
it was here that the Catholic Church made its final decision about the biblical
Canon. This is when the Deutero-Canonical books were officially in.
It seems hard for some modern Christians to believe that the final decision
was made so late in history, but it was merely a formality to officially stamp
what writings the Church had been using in practice for literally centuries.
The pressure of Protestant questions, however, forced the decision. It’s inter-
esting to speculate on whether the Catholic view would have hardened in this
way without Protestant challenges, but that’s a matter for another book!
Bottom line: The term “Apocrypha” should be used carefully. The Catholic
and orthodox traditions prefer to dub the writings “Deutero-Canonical.” For
these Christians, these are definitely not considered lost books of the Bible
but rather list books of the Bible! (Sorry for the bad joke, but coauthor Dan’s
a theologian, not a comedian!)
The Orthodox Christian view
Orthodox Christian churches take their canon a step further and have tended
to include even more later writings in their Bible, such as 3 and 4 Maccabees,
and an extra Psalm, numbered as Psalm 151, and sometimes the books of 
1 and 2 Esdras, which closely resemble (and even partially reproduce) Ezra
and Nehemiah and discuss roughly the same time period of Jewish history.
67
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

Each Orthodox Church (that is, Russian, Slavic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and so
on) made independent decisions about the Canon of the Bible, of course, but
the Greek Orthodox Church, for example, seems to have taken official action
at the Jerusalem Synod of 1672, but others suggest that it wasn’t “official”
among Greek Orthodox throughout the world until 1950(!).
Bottom line: Those Christian churches where a great amount of doctrinal and
liturgical tradition are central aspects of church life (for example, Catholic
and Orthodox) felt less need to be absolutely clear on the approved list of
scripture, those writings that had been used, commented upon, and studied
for centuries. There was, in short, a trusted tradition of use.
A Survey of Apocryphal Books
Whether you consider them canonical or not, the Apocryphal writings cer-
tainly contain important history. After the Babylonian Exile of 587 BCE, the
Hebrews lived under foreign occupation right through the era of the Roman
Empire and the beginnings of Christianity. The Babylonians were conquered
by the Persians in 539 and lived under Persian rule for 200 years, but pre-
cious little is known about what life was like under the Persian Empire.
The period of time that’s better known is the time after the conquests of
Alexander the Great and the following rule by Hellenistic (Greek) rulers who
divided up his vast territories when he died in 323. It’s this period of time,
after Alexander’s conquests, that most of the Apocryphal/Deutero-Canonical
books talk about. One of the basic questions these writings (as well as writ-
ings universally accepted in the Bible) address is, “How shall we live in these
times?”
On the one hand, some of the writings reflect stories that arose about
Hebrew advisors to foreign rulers who seemed to get along (and even occa-
sionally do very well) with the foreign monarchs. Stories like Daniel 1–6,
Tobit, and Esther suggest that there were certainly dangers facing Hebrews
living as minorities under vast Empires, but that survival and success were
certainly possible with God’s help.
Other writings, however, represent a much stronger assertiveness about
Jewish independence from foreign rule. There were times when Jews in Israel
even managed to live in semi-independence under Jewish leaders known as
Hasmoneans (the descendants of the Maccabean Revolutions described in 1
and 2 Maccabees). In fact, it’s possible to divide these Jewish writings before
Christianity into two tendencies according to their attitudes toward foreign
rule: hostile (for example, Judith and 1–4 Maccabees) and limited coopera-
tion (for example, Tobit and the additional stories added to the book of
Daniel in the Deutero-Canonical materials, which don’t change its general
tone of limited resistance).
68
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

As we summarize these later historical texts in the following sections, keep
the following question in mind: Is a political as well as religious attitude
reflected in these writings? Clearly, books like Maccabees and Judith carry a
strong political message that even advocates violence against enemies,
whereas books like Tobit and Wisdom of Solomon seem more pious and even,
at times, conciliatory.
The Maccabean books preach 
the message of nationalism
The book of 1 Maccabees is a kind of history of the violent events that led to
a temporary, semi-independent state of the Hebrews under the dominance of
a strong Jewish family known as the Hasmoneans and their descendants. The
other Maccabean books deal with slightly different parts of Greek period
Jewish history. 2 Maccabees retells some of the story of 1 Maccabees, but
then discusses famous martyrs. 3 Maccabees tells of Jewish resistance to
oppression in Egypt. Finally, 4 Maccabees is a somewhat strange book dealing
with the “reasonableness” of the martyrs of 2 Maccabees, suggesting that
their actions did in fact pay attention to reason — a trait particularly valued
among Greeks.
The attitude of most of the material of these books is combative and strong.
The writers believed that many of the Jews were becoming corrupt by pagan
rule in Jerusalem and advised that this rule must therefore be thrown off at
all costs! The revolution (today you’d call it a guerilla war) that broke out is
often called the Maccabean Revolution because it was initially led by a man
named Judas who was nicknamed “the Maccabee” (meaning “the Hammer”)
because he was so successful as a military strategist. However, the books
vary in their assessment of the tactics for successfully resisting foreign
oppression. 1 Maccabees is definitely military, but 2 and 3 Maccabees also
depend on God’s miraculous intervention.
The history leading up to the Maccabean Revolt and the events that occurred
right up to direct Roman rule in 63 BCE are somewhat complex. The principal
sources for the Hellenistic period are the books of 1 and 2 Maccabees; schol-
ars also have some information from the Jewish historian Josephus, but
Josephus lived after the time of Jesus and sometimes his descriptions from a
later time are considered questionable by modern historians.
Alexander’s vast empire was divided among his generals on his death in 323
BCE. The fate of the Hebrew people was determined in the struggles between
the ruling dynasties of the generals’ descendants (the Ptolemys of Egypt and
the Seleucids of Syria). There was considerable internal struggle in Palestine,
and inevitably a violent struggle broke out among Jewish factions about the
control of the Temple, its worship, and who would be the High Priest.
69
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

These internal debates, however, were made worse by the fact that a growing
faction of Jews sought to be more Greek in attitude, practice, and outlook.
This also meant becoming less and less scrupulous about the observation of
traditional Jewish practice and rites. Such “modernist” attitudes inevitably
drew a reaction from a more traditional population.
Now that you have a bit of background on the books in general, in the follow-
ing sections, we examine the interesting similarities and differences between
these four books that all now bear the name “Maccabee.”
1 Maccabees: A soap opera with swords
The primary text of the group of books now called 1, 2, 3, and 4 Maccabees is
clearly 1 Maccabees.
The book of 1 Maccabees can be summarized as the histories of the victories,
setbacks, and eventual reign of the family descendants who ruled right up to
the Roman occupation of Palestine in 63 BCE. In general, the book outlines
two main points:
 How God used this family to provide leadership to engage in military
and diplomatic maneuvering to successfully stay in power for several
generations (and of course, these books presume that this is a good
thing, despite the fact that the books admit that they had Jewish 
opposition)
 How the Priesthood of the Temple, the central institution of Jewish life
at this time, passed into the control of this ruling family
The book follows the pattern of biblical history writing modeled after the his-
torical books of the Bible such as 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, and 2 Kings,
and therefore many modern readers consider it to be written as if it contin-
ues the story of the rulers of Israel.
The heroes of 1 Maccabees clearly stand in a biblical tradition of power and
reassertion of Hebrew military identity mixed with some serious desire for
vengeance for centuries of Jewish exile and foreign rule. Consider some of
the last words of the elder Mattathias, the instigator of the revolt, as he
passes the torch to his son, Judas:
Judas Maccabeus has been a mighty warrior from his youth; he shall
command the army for you and fight the battle against the peoples. You
shall rally around you all who observe the law, and avenge the wrong 
done to your people. Pay back the Gentiles in full, and obey the commands
of the law.
—1 Maccabees 2:66–68
If you like soap opera intrigue, changing alliances, threats, and coun-
terthreats, you’ll love 1 Maccabees. It’s a celebration of military prowess,
strategy, and victory after setback.
70
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

2 Maccabees offers more support for the Maccabean Revolt
Somewhat oddly, the book known as 2 Maccabees backtracks to cover only
part of the historical period addressed in 1 Maccabees.
2 Maccabees begins with a description of the reign of Seleucus IV (187–175
BCE), who reigned before the hated Antiochus IV (175–164 BCE). The book of
2 Maccabees doesn’t go any farther than Judas Maccabeus’s impressive defeat
of a Greek General, Nicanor, whereas 1 Maccabees carries on much farther.
The oddity is perhaps best explained by the fact that 2 Maccabees claims to
be a summarization of another work that’s now lost but which was a history
of the Maccabean Revolt written by Jason of Cyrene. 2 Maccabees also features
two letters at the beginning, apparently directed to Jews in Egypt and Cyrene,
imploring them to take up the celebration of Judah’s impressive victories in
Jerusalem (and also, it would seem, recognize Judah’s claim to authority!).
It’s normally thought that 2 Maccabees was composed finally in the late
second century BCE, but others think it was later into the first century BCE.
Compared to 1 Maccabees, some scholars have argued that 2 Maccabees is
just a more dramatic and emotional work in support of Judah’s revolution,
but others have wondered whether the introduction of more miraculous
assistance and the theme of martyrdom was intended to introduce a more
profoundly religious element into discussions of the Maccabean Revolt. After
all, even though 1 Maccabees presents the warriors as pious, there’s little
doubt that they engage in decidedly worldly strategies, alliances, and tactics.
2 Maccabees, on the other hand, introduces much more of God’s involvement by
means of miracles and features extended descriptions and testimonies of non-
warriors (the priest Eleazer, and most famously, a woman and her seven sons)
who nevertheless die for the cause as martyrs rather than betray their faith.
3 Maccabees: Angels save the Jews
Although this book is called 3 Maccabees, it’s a work with an entirely differ-
ent character than 1 and 2 Maccabees except that it also narrates Jewish
resistance to foreign rulers. 3 Maccabees takes place during the reign of
Ptolemy IV (around 221–205 BCE).
The precise date of this work is impossible to pinpoint, and scholars argue
that it may be a veiled reference to later persecutions of Jews, such as in the
time of Roman Emperor Augustus, who started to register Jewish subjects
and charge a poll tax around 24 BCE. However, persecutions were sadly all
too common in the ancient world, so this amounts to guesswork.
Unlike 1 and 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees isn’t generally considered an accu-
rate historical account of real events but rather a dramatic series of stories
intended to encourage readers to faithful resistance to foreign rulers who
attempt to persecute Jews.
71
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

In 3 Maccabees, Ptolemy, one of the Greek rulers over Egypt in the days after
Alexander the Great’s death, has determined to exterminate the Jews of
Alexandria because he’s angry at his reception in Jerusalem when he tried to
enter the Temple, which is forbidden to non-Jews! Back in Egypt, Ptolemy
tries to get a listing of all the Jews in order to know who will abandon their
faith or be executed, but the officials run out of ink and papyrus after 40 days
of work and can’t finish the job.
So, the King orders that the Jews be rounded up in a large coliseum and be
trampled by elephants. But on the first try, the King oversleeps and can’t give
the actual order. The King completely forgets about his order and even acts
surprised that he would suggest such a thing! When he recovers his anger,
however, angels appear and drive the elephants back toward the King’s offi-
cials. In the end, the King repents of his attempts and recognizes the loyalty
of his Jewish subjects.
3 Maccabees almost has the air of dark comedy, but it also reminds the reader
of the same kinds of threats of total annihilation that appear in the biblical
book of Esther and stories like Daniel. 3 Maccabees reminds us that behind
these stories is the reality of persecution of the Jews. Some have even sug-
gested that 3 Maccabees contrasts a kind of nonviolent resistance to suggest
alternative tactics from those advocated in the more militaristic resistance of
1 Maccabees. An interesting idea, to say the least.
4 Maccabees provides examples for martyrs
The only reason that 4 Maccabees is called a Maccabean book in the first
place is because the subjects of this writing are the martyrs described in 2
Maccabees: Eleazar and the mother and her seven sons. But 4 Maccabees
isn’t a historical work at all; it’s an argument defending the notion that these
martyrs acted in a reasonable as well as pious manner. In deeply Greek style,
the writer defends their actions as the expression of reason, which is able to
control the passions and thus allow these martyrs to act in the courageous
manner that they did:
The supremacy of the mind over these cannot be overlooked, for the
brothers mastered both emotions and pains. How then can one fail to
confess the sovereignty of right reason over emotion in those who were not
turned back by fiery agonies?
—4 Maccabees 13:4–5
It appears that this work is intended to convince Greeks of the Jewish com-
mitment to reason and rationality while at the same time affirming Jewish
religious practice. Early Christian interest in 4 Maccabees, however, seems to
be based on the examples provided for early Christian martyrs in both 2
Maccabees and this book, 4 Maccabees, which praises their sacrifice as both
72
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

faithful and rational! Given the number of important Christian leaders who
also faced martyrdom, the Jewish martyrs of the two Maccabean books
would have been of obvious interest as examples of courageous faith.
Tales of Jewish heroes
Among the Apocryphal writings are a series of stories that focus on a central
hero — male or female. These stories, although very likely legendary, often
portray the central characters facing very real threats so that Jewish readers
could relate quite closely to the dangers in the story — and the characters’
wisdom in finding solutions to their dilemmas!
The book of Tobit and the book of Judith are the two best examples of Jewish
hero stories from the Apocryphal collection. We give you a rundown of these
stories in the following sections.
The charming Tobit
The book of Tobit introduces one of the most charming figures in later Jewish
tradition. Tobit is introduced as a descendant of the exiles from the Assyrian
Empire’s conquest of the Northern State of Israel in 722. This claim about
Tobit is highly doubtful, historically, because scholars know virtually nothing
about any survivors of that deportation, and it’s unlikely that a story such as
this would surface over 600 years later!
Because the work appears to make no reference to the Maccabean Revolt
(which surely would have been alluded to in some way if it had occurred at
the time of writing), Tobit is presumed to have been written in the early
second century BCE — in other words, before the Maccabean Revolt broke
out. The book mentions honoring “the Prophets” (14:4–5) and tithing, both
later Jewish traditions, so it can hardly be dated much earlier than this.
Tobit is a pious Jew who risks his life to give a proper burial to murdered
Jews in the land of the Assyrian Empire. One day he’s blinded and begins to
ask God to end his life. Just before doing so, however, he remembers some
unfinished business involving money he left in another town, and he sends
his son Tobias to go and bring it back. Meanwhile, precisely when Tobit was
asking for death, a young maiden named Sarah is in the town where Tobias is
headed, and she’s also asking for death because she was engaged to seven
men who were all killed by an evil demon named Asmodeus.
God sends an angel to accompany young Tobias, who doesn’t know that an
angel is advising him, keeping him safe, eventually delivering him from the
demon Asmodeus, and finally healing his father’s blindness. There are some
73
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

charming details in the story. For example, when Tobias falls in love with
Sarah, Sarah’s father Raguel starts digging his grave, telling his wife that they
should expect the worst and try to keep dead fiancé number eight as quiet as
possible!
But the book of Tobit also has some serious aspects. For example, the speech
Tobit gives to his son before sending Tobias on his journey is a moving
speech containing wise and pious advice about being a good person even
when living in a foreign land. Following is an excerpt from this speech:
Revere the Lord all your days, my son, and refuse to sin or to transgress his
commandments. Live uprightly all the days of your life, and do not walk in
the ways of wrongdoing; for those who act in accordance with truth will
prosper in all their activities. To all those who practice righteousness give
alms from your possessions, and do not let your eye begrudge the gift when
you make it. Do not turn your face away from anyone who is poor, and the
face of God will not be turned away from you. If you have many possessions,
make your gift from them in proportion; if few, do not be afraid to give
according to the little you have.
—Tobit 4:5-8
Judith makes Holofernes lose his head
In striking contrast to the book of Tobit is the story of the powerful Israelite
woman, Judith. Although the book of Judith was probably written some time
in the first century BCE, the setting of Judith is unclear: Judith is said to live
in a town known as Bethulia, but the location of this city is somewhat dis-
puted. It’s accepted that Judith isn’t intended as a historical source, so read-
ers can overlook the setting and just appreciate the story and think about
why it was considered so important.
Faced with threatening Assyrian troops, the town leaders of Bethulia are about
to surrender. The very beautiful Judith, appalled at this lack of faith, decides
to take matters into her own hands and use the oldest power in the world —
feminine attraction. She pretends to switch her loyalty to the Assyrians and
is quickly escorted to the General, Holofernes (a name unknown outside of
the book of Judith). Holofernes, predictably, begins to think of ways to seduce
Judith. Playing coy for a time, Judith insists that she be allowed to leave the
Assyrian camp to engage in prayers and bathing, which she does for a few
days. Then on the night that Holofernes thinks he is going to get lucky, Judith
gets him drunk, cuts off his head, and walks out of the camp. (The Assyrian
guards still think that she’s innocently going into the wilderness to bathe and
pray.) When Judith returns to Bethulia and presents the head of Holofernes,
the people are emboldened to defeat the Assyrian army, now in disarray at
the death of its leader. In the end, Judith is celebrated as a hero.
74
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Judith’s activism has sometimes been compared with that of the Maccabees
and contrasted with the quiet piety of Tobit, who seems entirely nonthreaten-
ing in his dependence on God’s assistance but also his quiet resistance to
assimilation.
More Daniel stories
In the Greek translations of Daniel, four large sections were added to the
book of Daniel. Of these, the first is a pious poem of praise, but the other
three are additional stories of the central hero, Daniel. All three stories —
Susanna, Bel, and the Dragon — reveal Daniel to be a wise and cunning man.
These stories are sometimes referred to (with due apologies to Edgar Allan
Poe’s Inspector Dupin!) as the first genuine detective stories in history. Daniel
examines evidence and produces information with all the skill of Sherlock
Holmes himself. Like other Apocryphal writings, these stories clearly fit the
times — pious stories of spiritual heroes in the days after Alexander’s con-
quests of the East.
The Prayer of Azariah
A poem usually called “The Prayer of Azariah” but sometimes called “The
Song of the Three” is attached to chapter 3 of the book of Daniel. Chapter 3 
is where the three pious Jews (Mishael, Hananiah, and Azariah) are miracu-
lously spared from death in the fiery furnace of the Babylonian ruler,
Nebuchadnezzar.
The poem begins with a confession of sin and request for forgiveness as the
three face death, and after the miracle of being spared from the fire, the sec-
tion changes and goes into an extended praise of God, glorifying the power
and majesty of the God who has saved the young Jews from their fiery death.
Susanna
The story of Susanna is about a pious Jewish woman who routinely bathes in
her private backyard but is seen by two elderly Jewish men. They made a
pact with each other to try and force Susanna to sleep with them, and when
Susanna piously refuses, the two then publicly accuse her of committing
adultery with someone else. They claimed to have seen the act firsthand.
Because they’re respected elders, the people believe the two men and pre-
pare to execute Susanna for adultery as the law demands. All are in agree-
ment with the punishment — except young Daniel. Daniel separates the two
men and reveals their stories to be contradictory. Thanks to Daniel,
Susanna’s honor is restored (and the elders are executed)!
75
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

Bel
In the story of Bel, Daniel is shown a great handmade idol, called Bel, by King
Nebuchadnezzar, who aims to prove to Daniel that it really is a god. The King
believes that the idol actually comes to life and eats the food put before it
every day. Rather strikingly, Daniel laughs at Nebuchadnezzar for his foolish-
ness (a detail suggesting that this story comes long after the actual condi-
tions of living under the cruel Babylonians!) and proposes a test. Daniel asks
for ash to be spread around the food table, and when Daniel and the King
return the next morning, Daniel points out to the King that there are foot-
prints in the ashes, revealing that the Priests of Bel have emerged in the 
night and taken the food to fool the King into believing that Bel the idol 
had eaten.
The Dragon
The Dragon is a short story that features Daniel proving that an impressive
animal (called a “dragon,” but not of the Harry Potter variety!) is no god by
concocting a potion that kills it.
An expanded book of Esther
The expansions of Esther are quite interesting because, in a direct sense,
they restore God to the book of Esther. The original version of the book of
Esther may be as old as the later part of the Persian Period (523–333 BCE).
But in the Greek translations of biblical books, Esther actually grew in size
with a number of significant additions to the story.
It has long been noted that God is never mentioned in the older (and shorter)
Hebrew book of Esther, but God makes rather important appearances in the
Greek additions to this book, which were most likely made in the first cen-
tury BCE. The original was likely at least 200 years older than the more reli-
gious Greek additions (possibly even older). The sections of these Greek
additions (some of which may have been written originally in Hebrew before
they were translated into the Greek that we now have) are typically distin-
guished by letters; see the following list for explanations:
 Addition A: Mordecai’s dream of the future and the way he discovers a
plot against the Persian monarch
 Addition B: A text of the King’s proclamation to kill all the Jews as his
evil advisor Haman had intended; the text of this proclamation wasn’t
included in the older Hebrew version of the story
76
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

 Addition C: The extended texts of Mordecai and Esther’s prayers to God
for deliverance, especially for Esther as she prepares to beg the King to
reverse Haman’s evil plot against the Jews
 Addition D: Further details about the King’s compassion for Esther and
his sympathy for her emotional state
 Addition E: The text of the King’s proclamation allowing the Jews to live
and proclaiming their innocence and righteousness; the proclamation
also allows the Jews to defend themselves if anyone tries to carry out
the original evil order
These additions attest not only to the popularity of the Esther story — which
obviously fits right in with the themes of 3 Maccabees, Tobit, and the addi-
tions to Daniel (see those sections earlier in the chapter) — but also the free-
dom to edit, supplement, and honor a story by, well, adding to it!
Later collections of Wisdom
Wisdom collections were a very popular form of Jewish literature (examples
include Proverbs and Ecclesiastes), and it’s clear that Jews just kept writing
these accounts of folk wisdom and wise advice (a bit like Ben Franklin’s wise
advice). The cool thing about reading Wisdom books is that most of the
advice sounds just as true today as it was then!
The Wisdom of Solomon
The Wisdom of Solomon is a collection of wise teachings gathered by some-
one who obviously was in serious conversation with Greek philosophy and
ideas; a number of fascinating features in this writing show development 
of Jewish thought in the Greek period and development of classic Wisdom
thought as well. (See Chapter 3 for an explanation of the different forms 
of Jewish religious writing, including Wisdom literature.) The Wisdom of
Solomon is an example of a later book that nonetheless preserves the older
Wisdom style and theme.
The Wisdom of Solomon features two unusual aspects that we think are espe-
cially worthy of comment. It carries on the tradition within Wisdom literature
of actually personifying Wisdom as a special creation of God. In the book of
Proverbs, the classic Wisdom book of the Bible, there’s an interesting ten-
dency to personify Wisdom as a beautiful woman. In addition to the rather
racy way of talking about the seductions of foolishness (portrayed as a dan-
gerous woman) as opposed to the wholesome love of wisdom (the other
77
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

beautiful woman), there’s also a further discussion of “lady wisdom” as a 
creation of God before God even created the cosmos (see Proverbs 8:22–31).
The Wisdom of Solomon continues to speak in the feminine of this personi-
fied Wisdom:
Wisdom is radiant and unfading, and she is easily discerned by those who
love her, and is found by those who seek her. She hastens to make herself
known to those who desire her. One who rises early to seek her will have no
difficulty, for she will be found sitting at the gate. To fix one’s thought on her
is perfect understanding, and one who is vigilant on her account will soon
be free from care . . .
—Wisdom 6:12–15
The Wisdom of Solomon also comments on violence in earlier Hebrew his-
tory. The writer talks about how God didn’t originally intend to wipe out the
Canaanites in the time of Joshua’s entry in the land, but their stubbornness in
refusing less lethal means was their downfall:
But even these you spared, since they were but mortals, and sent wasps as
forerunners of your army to destroy them little by little, though you were not
unable to give the ungodly into the hands of the righteous in battle, or to
destroy them at one blow by dread wild animals or your stern word. But
judging them little by little you gave them an opportunity to repent, though
you were not unaware that their origin was evil and their wickedness
inborn, and that their way of thinking would never change.
—Wisdom 12:8–10
Does such a discussion represent the writer’s attempt to explain God to for-
eigners who may wonder whether the destruction of the Canaanites in the
days of Joshua wasn’t a bit excessive? There are many such hints that
Wisdom is a book intended as a dialogue with non-Jews and thus appeal to
reasoned arguments, religious devotion, and especially Platonic forms of
philosophical argument.
Sirach’s words of wisdom
In the book bearing his name, Jesus Ben Sira, or just Sirach, this Jewish
philosopher seems to return to the confident views of the older Wisdom book
of Proverbs — confidence that it’s possible to lead a wise and productive life
even if one isn’t among the wealthy or elite. Sirach is normally dated between
200–175 BCE because the Prologue, added by someone claiming to be
Sirach’s grandson, is fairly securely dated to about 132–120 BCE.
Although not much is known about either Grandpa Sirach or his grandson,
the style of the writing is rather typical for Wisdom material, with the inter-
esting exception that Sirach addresses more characters from Jewish history
than Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, or Job — the three older Wisdom Books. For
example, the Patriarchs (Abraham and Jacob) are discussed in Sirach but
78
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

never make an appearance in the older material. Sirach, then, seems to pre-
sume the beginnings of a collection of writings that by his time are consid-
ered important already! He even refers to the 12 shorter books of the
Prophets as simply “The Twelve” — in short, already a set as they now
appear in the Old Testament.
Sirach offers a long series of sage advice — much of which seems as valid
today as when the ink was still wet. For example:
Do not abandon old friends, for new ones cannot equal them. A new friend
is like new wine; when it has aged, you can drink it with pleasure.
—Sirach 9:10
These writings of Sirach have an interesting social conscience as well; for
example, “Stretch out your hand to the poor, so that your blessing may be
complete” (Sirach 7:32). Like Proverbs, reading Sirach is a delight. Many of
the sayings are wise pearls that a modern person can string on his or her
own collection of helpful and enriching insights into the human condition.
Jeremiah-inspired literature
Two writings in the Apocryphal books focus on the importance and influence
of the Prophet Jeremiah: a short document known as the Letter of Jeremiah
and the book of Baruch.
The Letter of Jeremiah
The Letter of Jeremiah is an expansion of the letter that Jeremiah wrote to the
Babylonian exiles in chapter 29 of the biblical book of Jeremiah. In that famous
biblical letter, Jeremiah talks about the length of time that the exiles will be in
captivity. In the Letter of Jeremiah, however, the subject changes to idol wor-
ship and the advice to resist the worship of idols no matter how impressive the
idols look (referring to ones made of gold and silver, and so on).
It’s likely that this Letter was recast at a later time to try to warn against the
enticements of the Greek civilization and their gods given that their cultural
achievements, monuments, temples, and rituals were otherwise so impres-
sive. “Don’t be fooled,” says the Letter of Jeremiah!
The book of Baruch
Although based on a real historical character named Baruch who wrote the
book of Jeremiah (as reported in Jeremiah 36:4), the book of Baruch is a late
work only attributed to the famous Scribe of the Prophet Jeremiah.
Baruch features two main sections: a long prayer and a long, poetic hymn (or
song) addressed to Israel. The writing is set in the time of Jeremiah, when the
79
Chapter 4: The Controversial Apocrypha

Babylonian armies defeated and destroyed Jerusalem and forced the tragic
exile of many Jews from Jerusalem and the surrounding countryside to Babylon.
Reflecting the ideas of the Prophet Jeremiah, Baruch reminds readers that
Jerusalem was defeated because of the sins of the people. In the second part,
however, the book turns to encouragement, especially teaching that the
people should seek the knowledge of God. Yet the book also promises that
those who so cruelly destroyed Jerusalem will be punished.
Baruch, therefore, uses the setting of the Babylonian destruction of
Jerusalem in 587 BCE, and the exile of many Judeans right after that tragic
event, to write about persecutions and trials faced by the Jewish people in
later times. In a sense, it speaks in a historic “code.” “Babylon” came to be
used to symbolically speak of all oppressors of the Jews. (Note that the
Roman Empire is called “Babylon” in the New Testament book of Revelation,
and in 1 Peter 5:13.) It appears that Baruch, like many of the books of the
Apocrypha, was written to encourage Jews in troubled times.
Sadly, books of encouragement in troubled times were always useful because
troubled times kept coming. Probably one of the main reasons these writings
survived is that they were relevant in the frequent difficult times of Jewish his-
tory from 587 BCE right down to the Roman Empire (and, of course, beyond).
In the Bible or Not, These Books Are 
of Great Value to Modern Readers
Whether Christians or Jews choose to “include” these books in their Bible as
the Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions have chosen to do, they are still
valuable works that provide a great deal of information about Jewish thought
and practice in the centuries leading up to the rise of Christianity, and the
rise of Rabbinic (Modern) Judaism.
We hear about severe persecutions, we hear deeply moving calls to encour-
agement and reassurance, and we hear charming stories of Jewish “heroes,”
both violent and nonviolent, warriors and martyrs, who give us a profound
sense of a religious tradition and a people struggling to survive the chal-
lenges of living under various world empires.

M
ost people have heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls, but not many really
understand what that refers to. It’s important to know about the once
unknown writings of the Dead Sea Scrolls because they can help you under-
stand the diversity of Jewish beliefs in the years leading up to the beginnings
of Christianity; they also teach about the diverse backgrounds before the
clear development of early Rabbinic Judaism.
No one claims that the Dead Sea Scrolls include “missing” or “lost” books of
the Bible, but like some of the more unusual Christian writings we examine 
in later chapters, these writings show how wild some religious speculation
can get. When you read the Dead Sea Scrolls in English, you may conclude:
Interesting place to visit . . . but I wouldn’t want to live there. In other words,
although we’re deeply grateful that the community kept copies of what later
became the books of the Hebrew Bible (all except Esther), it’s also clear that
their own writings (which they may have treasured as equal in importance to
the writings that later became Scripture) are typically rather strange, difficult
to understand, or downright mean-spirited.
In this chapter, we give you an introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls and the
kind of literature that they contain. But half the fun is starting with the sto-
ries about how they were found in the first place! I mean, finding sacred
scrolls in caves — you can’t beat that, even in Hollywood.
Note: Throughout this chapter, we cite two different sources for each actual
quote from a scroll. We use the standard, scholarly numbering system for all
fragments and scrolls of the Dead Sea (used by all scholars in all publications
about the scrolls), but we also refer to the page number of the English trans-
lation provided in the best edition currently available: The Dead Sea Scrolls
Translated: The Qumran Texts in English, Second Edition, by Florentino Garcia
Martinez (Eerdmans).

A Little Background on 
the Dead Sea Scrolls
The term “Dead Sea Scrolls” refers to a number of “collections” of ancient
manuscripts that since about 1948 have been discovered over the years in
the caves along the shores of the Dead Sea (the basin of the Jordan River, the
border between modern Israel and modern Jordan).
The main collection that everyone thinks of as the Dead Sea Scrolls consists
of scrolls found hidden in 11 caves on the shore of the Dead Sea. Unfortunately,
these scrolls were in a very bad state (Figure 5-1 represents one of the more
intact scrolls), and although they include known biblical books of the Hebrew
Bible, most of the pieces are exactly that — frustratingly broken, torn, or
deteriorated fragments. A few scrolls are nearly complete — such as the
Prophet Isaiah — but virtually everything else has pieces missing.
Most of these texts are on papyrus, a form of writing material made by weav-
ing and flattening the leaves of the papyrus plant that grows along shorelines
throughout the Middle East.

How they were found: Be careful 
where you throw rocks!
There’s real romance to the legends of the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
However, as the modern Dead Sea Scroll scholar Florentino G. Martinez has
written, the stories have conflicting versions.
The most famous version is that a young Bedouin boy named Mohammed ed-
Dhib chased his goat into a cave, and when he threw a rock, it struck one of
the sealed clay jars where some scrolls were placed all those centuries ago!
In another version of the story, it was three shepherds who found the scrolls.
But regardless of the specifics of their discovery, the fact is that by 1947, the
scrolls were coming to light.
Who wrote them
Even after the scrolls came to the public’s attention, debates raged about
how genuine and how old they really were. After decades of careful research
on the pottery forms where some of the manuscripts were found, the kinds of
writing used in the scrolls, and the chemistry and form of the scrolls them-
selves, it’s clear today that the scrolls are Jewish writings written by a group
of Jews with unusual religious ideas (often called sectarians or separatists).
They lived apart from the rest of Jewish society because they believed that
they were the “pure” Jews and that the others were corrupt — especially
those Jewish officials running the Temple in Jerusalem. These strange ideas
are represented by their own religious writings — writings different from 
the books that they also kept copies of that later became Jewish scripture.
Remember, two bodies of texts make up the Dead Sea Scrolls: the texts that are
copies of biblical books and the texts that are the separatists’ own writings.
The scrolls were produced by a community living at Qumran, a site not far
from the various caves on the edge of the Judean desert, where similar pot-
tery was discovered. It seems obvious that all the various finds came from
Qumran because copies of the same writings were found in various caves.
This community composed these writings from the third century BCE right
up to about 68 CE, when the site was used by the Romans as a garrison in
preparations for their conquest of Masada (the last holdouts from the Jewish
Revolt of 67–70 CE).
This Qumran community kept these writings until they hid them in the caves,
probably as a result of Roman threats. What they kept were two different cat-
egories of writings: biblical writings (many of which may not have come from
this community in the first place) and their own religious writings outlining
their unique Jewish beliefs.
83
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls

Why the Discovery of the Scrolls Was
Sensational for Biblical Scholarship
Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, modern scholars didn’t have
ancient Hebrew texts of the Bible! Only copies of copies of copies . . . well,
you get the idea. Although they had very old Greek fragments and biblical
writings from as early as the fourth century (that is, Greek translations of the
Hebrew writings), as well as pieces from as early as the second century, the
oldest actual versions of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament,
written in Hebrew were from the ninth to tenth centuries CE.
Among the Dead Sea Scrolls discoveries were pieces — and sometimes large,
almost complete sections — of every single book of the Hebrew Bible except
Esther. To this day, you can visit “The Shrine of the Book” in Jerusalem and
read the Hebrew manuscripts of biblical books like the Prophet Isaiah on dis-
play there. It’s a real treat to watch visiting Israeli schoolchildren read these
2,000-year-old texts because they recognize much of the Hebrew!
With the discoveries of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the caves, scholars had
Hebrew writings of biblical books that were sometimes 1,000 years older than
what they had before 1947. Amazing! Now they were able to check their ideas
of what the Hebrew versions of the old books must have been (based on
those ninth- to tenth-century versions) by comparing much older manu-
scripts. The discovery really gave a boost to biblical scholarship.
The following sections discuss the areas of study that were broadened with
the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
84
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 
Patience pays off: Gaining access to the scrolls
Before 1991, access to even photographs of 
the various scrolls and pieces of scrolls was
forbidden by the Israel Antiquities Authority,
which appointed a group of scholars as the
“guardians” of the scrolls. Obviously, this limi-
tation created a huge outcry among scholars
around the world, who protested that important
discoveries should be available to all scholars
as soon as possible.
On September 22, 1991, the Huntington Library
of Pasadena, California, revealed that the Israeli
government had quietly deposited a complete
set of photographs of the scrolls (sets were also
given to other international libraries) with the
library and that it would make these photographs
available for study. Since that time, other
libraries have opened up their sets of photos,
and research on the scrolls has increased 
dramatically.

Different versions of biblical books
Particularly intriguing to scholars was the fact that some biblical books were
present in the scrolls in more than one version! There appeared to be differ-
ent arrangements of some books, for example, and a different chapter order
for a copy of Psalms that even included a few Psalms not otherwise included
in the later “canonical” version. These differences suggest that different ver-
sions of biblical books were circulating in the days before definite versions
were agreed upon and definitely before final “lists” were drawn up! What’s so
interesting to modern biblical scholars is that the Qumran community clearly
maintained different versions of the same books.
Did the Qumran community have a “canon”? Many of their writings quote from
biblical books, but they also quote from books that weren’t later accepted in
the Jewish “canon” of the Hebrew Bible, such as Jubilees. It doesn’t appear
that they had an idea of a definitive “list.”
Some possible lost fragments 
of biblical books
Are there “lost books” of the Bible among the Dead Sea Scrolls? Well, part of
the answer to this question is obvious — the Bible didn’t yet exist in the con-
ventional sense when the Qumran community lived and wrote their materi-
als. They obviously treasured their “biblical writings” as well as their own
writings. But occasionally, there are some tantalizing hints of some materials
that may have once been part of the biblical books we now have but that
were in fact “lost.”
Our favorite example of this is a fragment known as the “Prayer of Nabonidus.”
Nabonidus was a Babylonian Ruler who lived about 556–539 BCE. Many schol-
ars believe that many of the stories in the book of Daniel that talk about
Nebuchadnezzar originally must have been talking about Nabonidus. The
name was probably changed to Nebuchadnezzar because he was the more
famous Babylonian ruler and the destroyer of Jerusalem in 587 BCE.
The question is this: Is there a lost story of Daniel in the Dead Sea Scrolls?
Here’s the text (the [brackets] indicate missing parts, with educated guesses
filled in):
Words of the prayer which Nabonidus, king of the land of Babylon, the great
king, prayed when he was afflicted by a malignant inflammation, by decree
of the God Most High, in Teiman. I, Nabonidus, was afflicted . . . for seven
years, and was banished far [from men, until I prayed to God Most High]
and an exorcist forgave my sin. He was a Jew from [exiles, who said to me]
85
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls

Make a proclamation in writing, so that glory, exaltation and honor be given
to the name of the God Most High. And I wrote as follows: When I was
afflicted by a malignant inflammation . . . I prayed for seven years [to all]
the gods of silver and gold [of bronze and iron] of wood, of stone and of
clay, because [I thought] that they were gods . . .
—4QPrNab (tr. Martinez, 289)
That’s pretty much all we have. But it’s intriguing and sounds so much like
many of the elements of the famous Daniel stories in the book of Daniel 1–6!
And, given that three more Daniel stories turned up in the Greek translation
of the book of Daniel, is it too much to suppose that perhaps other Daniel sto-
ries once circulated and that this fragment from the Dead Sea Scrolls is yet
another one? The problem is that “Daniel” isn’t specifically mentioned; other-
wise, the apparent similarities to the plots of the known Daniel stories seem
pretty amazing.
Even though the Dead Sea Scrolls don’t provide revolutionary lost books that
will change everything about modern religion, they do provide lots of intrigu-
ing hints and suggestions.
“Interpretations” of biblical books
Another form of writing from the Dead Sea Scrolls that involves biblical mate-
rial is works that interpret biblical books, including works known as Pesherim
(the singular form is Pesher).
Pesherim are “interpretations” of biblical books, mostly the Prophets. But the
style is quite strange and unfamiliar to modern readers. Often, the biblical
Prophet (such as Habakkuk, one of the more famous scrolls) is quoted by a
single verse and then the phrase “The Interpretation is . . .” appears followed
by a very brief explanation. Consider an example from the Pesher on Micah;
we indicate the direct quote from Micah in bold:
What are the High Places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? I will
reduce Samaria to a country ruin, a plot of vines. The interpretation of
this concerns the Spreader of Lies, since he has misdirected simpletons.
What are the “high places” of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? The
interpretation of this concerns the Teacher of Righteousness who teaches the
law to his council and to all those volunteering to join the chosen of God,
carrying out the law in the council of the community . . .
—4QpMic10 (tr. Martinez, 194)
86
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Two things are worthy of note here because they’re fairly typical of these
Pesher interpretation writings:
 The interpretation is rather loose. In this example, the words of Micah
about Jerusalem are considered positive (about the community) and the
words about Samaria negative. In fact, in the actual passage in Micah, it
seems clear that both places are being condemned by the Prophet Micah
in the late eighth century BCE.
 Individuals are named. In this example, the “hero” is the “Teacher of
Righteousness” (probably the founder of the community) and an enemy
is named as “Spreader of Lies” (quite possibly the High Priest who was
serving in Jerusalem at the time).
Reading these Pesher materials from the Dead Sea Scrolls reveals that the
interpretation was almost always carefully applied to the time of the writer of
the scroll itself and not the time of the biblical book being quoted. Some of
these scrolls specifically mention events known to have occurred in the first
century BCE, so the general idea seems to be that these interpretation scrolls
are trying to apply the biblical teachings of various Prophets to their own
time, paying no attention to the details of the biblical book’s own time!
Possible new Mosaic laws revealed
Apparent rewritings of the Laws of Moses in the Torah, which consists of the
first five books of the Bible, are among the more controversial kinds of litera-
ture discovered among the Dead Sea Scroll fragments.
This finding is surprising because one would think that the laws of Moses
would have been pretty off-limits as far as change was concerned. Yet, even
in the Dead Sea community, it seems that Moses material wasn’t sacrosanct.
The Temple Scroll not only was the single longest scroll discovered (nearly
nine meters long with 67 columns written on it) among all the Dead Sea
Scrolls, but also many copies and fragments of the document were discov-
ered in other locations.
This scroll reads very much like the laws of Moses in the biblical books of
Leviticus, Exodus, and Deuteronomy, but in the Temple Scroll these laws
have been rather freely mixed together with occasional materials that don’t
appear in the biblical books. Some scholars suggest that the Temple Scroll
was considered part of the Torah in the Qumran Jewish community.
87
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls

Some go further and suggest that the Temple Scroll was the Torah for this
community, which used it instead of the more well-known books of Moses
that ended up in the Bible. In other words, it’s possible that the scroll had the
same religious and “ethical” status as the laws of Moses, which according to
Jewish tradition are the words of God as given to Moses. A rather large per-
centage of the Temple Scroll laws are written in the same style (God speaks
to Moses directly in the first person) as the books of Moses in the Bible. Most
of these laws have to do with ritual practices of the Priests, sacrifice, and
other aspects of ritual (down to details like burial of the dead, for example).
Often the practices are elaborated beyond the instructions given in the Bible.
Looking at Other Writings Commonly
Referred to as Dead Sea Scrolls
Although the term “Dead Sea Scroll” is usually intended to refer to a limited
number of scrolls (and hundreds of fragments of scrolls) found on the shores
of the Dead Sea, other writings are sometimes included in the general term.
It’s important to understand the different kinds of literature, when and where
they were found, and more important, when they’re normally dated. Here’s a
rundown:
 The Wadi Daliyeh Papyri: This collection of papyrus writings, dated
from the fourth century BCE, was discovered in caves north of Jericho.
It was accompanied by many artifacts (seals and metal work in particu-
lar) which were considered just as important as the Wadi Daliyeh writ-
ings themselves. The writings appear to be mostly business documents,
including a number of “bills of sale” for slaves written in ancient Aramaic
(the language of the region in the fifth to fourth century BCE or toward
the end of the Persian rule over Palestine). This collection doesn’t
appear to have any religious writings, but the writings are valuable
sources for historians.
 The Masada Manuscripts: When the famous mountaintop fortress of
Masada was excavated by archaeologists in the 1950s, they found sev-
eral manuscripts. Among them were several biblical books, including
Sirach (the late Wisdom book that appears in Catholic and Orthodox
versions of the Old Testament), pieces of other biblical writings, and
some non-biblical books known from fragments in the main collection of
Dead Sea Scrolls. Most of the biblical manuscripts weren’t different than
our present versions, although pieces of Ezekiel apparently showed
some interesting variations.
 The Manuscripts of Murabba’at: These texts were found at a wadi — a
ravine created when water cuts into a mountainside — called Murabba’at.
Several pieces of correspondence dealing with the Bar Kochba revolt of
132–135 CE were discovered along with small pieces of biblical texts.
88
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

 The Manuscripts of Nahal Hever: Most pieces of these religious writings
are too small to identify, but this collection includes a great number of
contracts and letters from the Bar Kochba era. These writings were dis-
covered in 1960–1961.
 The Manuscripts from Wadi Seiyal and Pieces of the Twelve Prophets:
These texts consist of several pieces of legal documents in various
ancient languages. Some scholars suspect some of these documents to
really be from the area of Nahal Hever.
Checking Out the Unusual Religious
Writings from the Dead Sea Collection
Among the most spectacular finds of the Dead Sea Scrolls are the books that
are not biblical books at all but rather are writings made by the Qumran
Jewish community to defend their own religious ideas and encourage them in
their life and in their ideals.
Most historians refer to the Qumran community as separatists or sectarians
because the vast majority of their writings seem to either advise a form of
purity and removal from others who aren’t in the community or amount to
angry dreams of future warfare and destruction of their enemies.
Scholars who work on these writings suggest dividing the “unusual” writings
from the Dead Sea Scrolls into the following categories:
 Predictions of future spiritual battle
 Rules for community life
 Poetry
 Liturgy
 Astronomical texts
Predictions of future spiritual battle
Much of the non-biblical material in the Dead Sea Scrolls collection engages
in contrasts between the good guys and the bad guys. The good guys (Sons
of Light), obviously, are the members of the Qumran community, and the bad
guys — well, this could be generic (all the rest of those people) or some have
wondered if it was directed against specific enemies. Could it be, for example,
that the bad guys were specifically the Jewish leaders back in Jerusalem? Some
have speculated that the Qumran community was started by disenfranchised
Priests who felt alienated (or even thrown out!) by the powerful Priests back 
89
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls

in Jerusalem, and so they retreated to the desert to start their own purified
community and wait for the day when God would lead them back to
Jerusalem, and to power, in triumph!
Among the most important documents that suggest this interpretation is the
famous War Scroll. Included in this fascinating (and often shockingly violent)
set of documents are careful instructions for a “spiritual war” that’s coming
very soon. The opening lines set the stage:
For the Instructor: The Rule of the War. The first attack by the sons of light
will be launched against the lot of the sons of Darkness, against the army 
of Belial, against the company of Edom and of Moab and of the sons of
Ammon.
—1 QM 1:1 (tr. Martinez, 95)
Evil spiritual armies are aligned with foreign peoples (Edom, Moab, and so
on) so that this battle is understood to be heavenly and earthly armies
together. Frankly, it all begins to sound like some big Lord of the Rings-type
battle with hordes of evil troops against the “sons of Light”:
There will be infantry battalions to melt the heart, but God’s might will
strengthen the heart of the sons of light.
—1QM 1:14 (tr. Martinez)
Included in these many scrolls and portions of scrolls are even banners with
messages written on them (the messages are provided), trumpets sounding,
and even battle cries, such as:
For the battle is yours!
With the might of your hand
Their corpses have been torn to pieces
With no-one to bury them!
—1 QM XI.1 (tr. Martinez, 103)
Also included in this category of writings are texts that set forth actual mea-
surements for the rebuilding of Jerusalem. This seems to go along with the
war, it seems, because plans are already established for the reconstruction of
Jerusalem after the war. From these texts, it’s understood that Jerusalem is
the anticipated goal of the battle — not the community in the desert! The
community is simply waiting there for the heavenly trumpets to sound the
charge. Although the war extends for 40 years, much of the books centers on
the last battle.
90
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Rules and ethical instructions 
for the community
Two of the most famous writings in the Dead Sea Scrolls are the documents
known now as the Rule of the Community and the Damascus Document. Both
documents establish a kind of discipline, or set of rules, for the community.
This fact becomes more obvious when you read lines like this one from the
beginning of the Rule of the Community:
This is the rule for the men of the Community who freely volunteer to
convert from all evil and to keep themselves steadfast in all he prescribes in
compliance with his will. They should keep apart from men of sin in order
to constitute a community in law and possessions, and acquiesce to the
authority of the sons of Zadok . . .
—1 QS V:1–2 (tr. Martinez, 8)
Zadok is the famous founder of an order of Priests in the Bible, and it seems
that the community saw themselves as inheritors of the “pure” line of the bib-
lical Zadok. His name occurs frequently in Dead Sea documents.
Included in the Rule of the Community are all kinds of instructions for how
people are supposed to relate to each other in this community as well as 
the ritual means of maintaining the “purity” of the individual and the group.
Along the way are interesting discussions of the community in relation to
“evil tendencies” that community members are warned about. Clearly, this
group thought that their rules were part of what made them superior to out-
siders — that is, all the rest of the Jews!
The rules can get rather strict, such as the rules against falling asleep during
meetings of the community, where numbers of days of punishment are given:
Whoever utters with his mouth futile words, three months; for talking in the
middle of the words of his fellow, ten days. And whoever lies down and goes
to sleep in the session of the Many, thirty days . . .
—1 QS VII 11–13 (tr. Martinez, 11)
(Hmmm . . . maybe something to read to your kids. . . .) Part of the Rule con-
tains some poetry — perhaps intended as rules to be “sung” to help people
memorize them. Others think that that the community repeated the poetic
phrases together during some kind of religious service.
91
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls

On the other hand, the famous Damascus Document also has historical inter-
est, and speculation surrounding this document is based on the fact that it
may give a kind of history of the Qumran community. Typically, scholars turn
to this document as a basis to suggest that the Qumran community was a
breakaway group when the Hasmoneans (descendants of the Maccabees)
took over the Priesthood in Jerusalem. In this writing, historical events can
be interpreted in the symbolism. For example, when they talk about the evil
ones — they mean those Jews who oppose them — they often interpret bibli-
cal passages to refer to their enemies literally. In the following example, the
text quotes a passage from Deuteronomy 32:33:
“Their wine is serpents’ venom and the head of cruel, harsh asps.” The
serpents are the kings of the peoples and the wine their paths and the asps’
head is the head of the kings of Greece.
—Col. VIII (tr. Martinez, 38)
Poetry
Among the interesting non-biblical materials contained in the Dead Sea
Scrolls collection are a number of poetic texts — often in pieces so small as
to make it difficult to reconstruct entirely — that are very similar to the
Psalms in the Bible. In fact, most scholars refer to these as Apocryphal
Psalms.
Many of the fragments of these non-biblical Psalms seem entirely acceptable
in content and probably weren’t included only because they were written
later than the collection that ended up as “canonical” in Jewish and Christian
traditions. Some of these so-called other Psalms may well have been older
than the Qumran community and simply were preserved among their biblical
materials. In other words, many scholars believe that some of this Psalm-like
poetry wasn’t actually written by the community.
“Wisdom is a woman” poems
Other poems can be a bit, well, unusual. For example, one of the interesting
traditions that’s typical of ancient Jewish wisdom literature (literature that
gives advice on wise ways of living and success in life) is that, on occasion,
wisdom becomes “personified” as a beautiful woman. Learning wisdom is
equated with falling in love with wisdom.
Most of the poetry isn’t like this, though, and one of the clues of the late
nature of many of these Psalms is surely the fact that many, if not most, of the
themes play off light against dark, good against evil, and especially name an
evil being (often “Belial”) against the goodness of God. Finally, themes of
God’s ultimate judgment against evil are also common throughout.
92
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

These contrasts are further examples of the “us against them” feeling drawn
from the vast majority of the Dead Sea materials that are not in the Bible.
Much of the poetry is lovely, but then it takes a turn toward a nasty vindic-
tiveness, and at that moment, you can breathe a little sigh: “Thank goodness
that one wasn’t included in the canon!”
Exorcism Poems
Among the Apocryphal Psalms are a few really spooky poems. These are
called Exorcism Poems, and they’re clearly intended to ward off evil spirits, or
“Belial,” a term used for the same spirit that later Christians would know as
the Devil. These poems are written like a Psalm, as if David wrote them, but
they advise certain ways to ward off evil. Here’s an example, with missing
parts filled in as best guesses:
Call on the heavens at any time, when Belial comes upon you, you shall say
to him: Who are you, accursed amongst men and amongst the seed of the
holy ones? Your face is a face of futility, and your horns are horns of a
wretch. You are darkness and not light, sin and not justice . . .
—11 Q 11 IV (tr. Martinez, 377)
So, basically, insult him a lot and he goes away. Apparently it’s that simple.
Liturgy
Included in this collection of materials are fragments that have been sorted
together because they appear to suggest prayers for special occasions. The
presumption is that these are prayers that were given for certain times of the
year, on specifically numbered occasions or even every day, as evidenced by
the opening, “When the sun rises, you shall say. . . .”
In this group, there’s special interest in a group of texts named Word of the
Luminaries. These writings are interesting because they seem so similar to 
a set form of prayer known from the Bible in Daniel Chapter 9, Nehemiah
93
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls
Acrostic Psalms
A popular form among the Dead Sea poems is
acrostic Psalms. These are Psalms arranged so
that consecutive lines of poetry begin with the
next letter of the Hebrew Alphabet (kind of like,
“A is for . . ., B is for . . .,” and so on). But, of
course, it isn’t possible to reflect and express
this pattern in an English translation, so you just
have to take our word for it!

Chapter 9, and the apocryphal book of Baruch. This form of prayer seems to
have become popular among Jews after the disasters of the Babylonian con-
quest of Jerusalem in 587 BCE because examples of the prayers are in biblical
books that come after that date.
Typical of these prayers are elements including
 Recounting God’s deeds of mercy in the past
 Recounting people’s mistakes in the past
 Admitting that people are suffering because they ignored God’s warnings
 Asking God to forgive people one more time
Knowing this, you can recognize these themes in the following text, which
begins with a discussion of God’s just punishments in the past but neverthe-
less continues:
But in spite of all this you did not reject the descendants of Jacob and did
not hurl Israel to destruction, breaking the covenant with them. For you are
a living God, you alone, and there is no other apart from you. You
remembered your covenant. . . .For you have poured your holy spirit upon
us, to fill us with your blessings, so that we would look for you in our
anguish, and whisper in the grief of your reproach . . .
—4 Q 504 V (tr. Martinez, 415)
Another writing in this group is often called Sons of the Sabbath Sacrifice. This
writing reflects the realm of angelic speculation and nearly apocalyptic-like
imagery (see Chapter 3). For those who enjoy reading the strange imagery of
books like the last book of the New Testament, John’s Revelation, then this is
the Dead Sea Scroll for you! Here’s a sampling:
He will celebrate the God of the exalted angels seven times, with seven
words of wonderful exaltations. Psalm of praise, on the tone of the fourth, to
the Powerful One who is above all the gods with his seven wonderful
powers. He will praise the God of the powers seven times, with seven words
of wonderful praise . . .
—4 Q 4031 (tr. Martinez, 421)
In this document, you see typical signs of this kind of literature — lots of 
repetition, use of numbers like seven (Hebrews loved to use number 7 and
number 12 whenever possible, viewing them as numbers that were whole and
complete), and imagery of angels and heavenly beings. You even get the idea
94
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

that the very reading of these passages is supposed to induce some kind of
altered state of consciousness. To be honest, this stuff alters our state into
unconsciousness (zzzzzz), but to each his own.
Astronomical texts
Saving the strangest for last, among the unusual religious writings in the
Dead Sea Scrolls are elements of astronomical, perhaps even astrological,
interest in the movements of the stars and planets. The reason for these doc-
uments seems obvious: When you’re in the desert and the oil lamps go out
and the sky opens up before you, it’s hard not to be impressed. And if you’re
of a religious turn of mind (as the Qumran community most certainly was),
you may start turning that religious mind toward making sense of what you’re
witnessing above you!
It’s known from such books as the Book of 1 Enoch (see Chapter 6) that
ancient Jews, like most ancient people, were fascinated with the skies and
often sought to interpret information from their observations. When you
stare long enough, you begin to see patterns in the stars and in the move-
ment of the lights. The sun rises and sets, the moon changes shape, and the
star patterns appear to move as well.
One of the practical uses of all this observation, of course, was setting the
calendar of festivals, feasts, and holy days. So, the main reason for observing
the sun, moon, and stars was to make sure that the community was doing
things at the right time (like farmers have had to do from the beginning of
human agriculture). But, their minds could have easily wandered to other
things. If said farmer didn’t understand basic astronomy, he could have
drawn some, well, shall we say (ahem), unusual conclusions from all this.
In fact, most historians think that there may well be a close relationship
between the speculation in 1 Enoch (see Chapter 6) and the pieces of astro-
nomical texts that were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. It seems that 1
Enoch was a summary of much wider speculation going on among ancient
Jewish observers of the skies.
Most of the astronomical texts are long lists of numbers and calculations;
because they’re physically in such a fragmented state, it’s difficult to make
sense of the text. However, some pieces seem to suggest interest in horo-
scopes! Zodiac signs are actually mentioned in some fragments, and one 
fragment even seems to engage in a kind of prediction:
95
Chapter 5: The Dead Sea Scrolls

. . . And his thighs are long and slender, and the toes of his feet are slender
and long. And he is in the second position. His spirit has six (parts) in the
house of light and three in the pit of darkness. And this is the sign in which he
was born: the foot of Taurus. He will be poor. And his animal is the bull . . .
—4 Q 186 (tr. Martinez, 456)
Who is this talking about? Is it a prediction about a person? Is it a description
of a constellation? This excerpt is a good example of the problem with work-
ing with fragments of texts . . . tantalizing words, but incomplete.
Perhaps, in the end, one of the most fascinating aspects of working with Dead
Sea materials is the detective work — poring over little pieces of papyrus in
hopes of matching something up!

I
n 1773, Scottish explorer James Bruce (1730–1794) returned from Ethiopia
with three copies of the Book of Enoch. (He was in Ethiopia searching for
sources of the Nile River, which he found, by the way.) Before Bruce’s discov-
ery, scholars thought that it had existed at one point in pre-Christian times,
but the Book of Enoch was believed to have been irretrievably lost. Bruce
proved this notion wrong.
In 1821, an English translation of the book was produced and was a sensation.
Had The New York Times Book Review been around in 1821, it’s a safe bet that
Enoch would have made the bestseller list (although numbers-wise, it proba-
bly wouldn’t have beaten the Harry Potter series!). Note: The English transla-
tion used here is translated by Professor Isaac and is included in the volumes
edited by Charlesworth, Apocrypha and Pseudopigrapha of the Old Testament
(see appendix).
Arguably one of the most important lost books of the Bible — and a book that
really was lost to most of the world for centuries — the Book of 1 Enoch is a
book that both Jews and Christians really ought to know something about. It
was widely read by Jews and Christians and was especially influential to 
early Christian thought. Even now, 1 Enoch is the subject of some full-scale
commentaries — the ultimate indicator of an important writing in the
modern academic world! Therefore, 1 Enoch has pride of place in this book
as the only writing that has its very own chapter!

The Book of Enoch discussed in this chapter is 1 Enoch. There are two other
Enoch books, called 2 and 3 Enoch; however, they’re less influential and not
well-known writings. Most people, therefore, refer to 1 Enoch simply as “The
Book of Enoch.” (You can check out Chapter 8 for a bit on the other Enoch
books.)
Who the Heck is Enoch, Anyway?
You’re probably wondering who this “Enoch” is and why we can justifiably
consider “his” book a lost book of the Bible.
A better question may be who Enoch isn’t. Enoch isn’t the writer of the Book
of 1 Enoch. The truth is, no one has any idea who wrote the Book of 1 Enoch
because it was common for ancient writers of these kinds of books to give
the book a famous name, like a pseudonym. Furthermore, there’s great suspi-
cion that other writers may have added material to 1 Enoch along the way.
The first writer chose the name “Enoch,” and later contributors added more
material about this same Enoch as the central character of their stories. Why
was this Enoch such a popular topic for writers of this kind of visionary
book?
Although the Book of 1 Enoch isn’t in the Bible, the person named Enoch is,
and thus the book is worth looking at as a possible contender (OK, maybe a
long shot) for Biblical inclusion — assuming it was widely available back
when the final versions of the Old and New Testament were being compiled.
Enoch had Scripture cred, for lack of a better phrase. The Enoch we speak of
is a descendant of Seth, the son of Adam and is also the father of Methuselah
who lived (according to Genesis 5:23) for 969 years. He’s mentioned by name
in the Old Testament in Genesis and in the New Testament in Luke and
Hebrews. As well, The Book of Enoch is actually quoted in Jude 1:14.
A famous verse about Enoch sets our stage for his being able to give us
divine information:
Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.
—Genesis 5:24
This verse is so intriguing that artists, such as Sebastiano Ricci, have 
re-created this experience (see Figure 6-1).
98

God took him? What does that mean?
Centuries later, one writer in the New Testament book of Hebrews gives a
pretty good idea of what ancient people thought this meant: “By faith Enoch
was taken so that he did not experience death . . .” (Hebrews 11:5). Yes, the
tradition emerged that Enoch was taken up into heaven instead of having
died.
Figure 6-1:

carried up
into heaven.
99
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

Simply put, 1 Enoch is about what Enoch saw in heaven and was able to tell
people upon his return to earth. In fact, all the books of Enoch are written
with that premise, but 1 Enoch truly intended to be a message from the other
side.
What Makes 1 Enoch So Important?
Lots of ancients read Enoch, lots of ancients knew Enoch, and lots of ancients
quoted from Enoch.
Okay great. But why are modern people interested in this book? The answer
is multifaceted:
 The Book of Enoch is the oldest form of visionary literature known as
apocalyptic writings (refer to Chapter 3 for more on this and other styles
of religious writing), and so it’s studied as an early example of what will
become an explosion of writings in the centuries after Enoch.
 Enoch proves that different Jewish writers were thinking quite different
things in the centuries before and during early Christianity. In short, it
proves that ancient Jewish thought was quite diverse.
 Enoch seems to have had some serious influence on early Christian
ideas.
100
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 
The many translations of Enoch
A fraction of the present Book of Enoch was dis-
covered among the fragments found among the
Dead Sea Scrolls, and about one-third of the
book is preserved in various other Greek frag-
ments. Also, chapters 1–32 were found bundled
with the Christian works known as the Gospel
of Peter and the Apocalypse of Peter in a Coptic
grave discovered in 1886 in Akhmim, Egypt.
The full form of the Book of 1 Enoch as we now
have it is from the Ethiopic language, which is
technically known as Ge’ez. It’s a Semitic lan-
guage, which means it’s related to biblical and
modern Hebrew and also modern Arabic.
James Bruce’s copies came from the 15th cen-
tury, but numerous clues suggest that this book
was translated into Ge’ez centuries ago from
Greek, and in turn, the Greek was translated
from Aramaic originals. (Aramaic was an
ancient language used by the Jews in the time
before and after Jesus.)

 Enoch presents a full form of the idea that Satan began as a fallen angel,
and that this fall led directly to evil angels having sex with humans and
producing a race of giants that God wipes out with the famous Flood. In
short, Enoch provides a somewhat different version of why the famous
Flood occurred!
These are mega-important issues for historians, so we look at each of them in
turn in this section.
The ultimate example of 
apocalyptic literature
Enoch is written in the literary style of ancient religious writing that’s called
apocalyptic. (“Apocalypse” literally means “revelation,” and thus apocalyptic
literature claims to reveal something from an unusual vision or even from the
author’s personal visit to heaven.)
Apocalyptic literature is a form of symbolic and visionary writing that often
uses bizarre imagery, sometimes features travels in heaven, and usually uses
strange creatures to communicate a message about events that are about to
unfold. It’s clear that reading such speculative visionary literature was highly
popular in the ancient world (among both Jews and Christians and beyond)
because there are so many surviving examples of this type of ancient “sci-fi/
fantasy.”
Enoch fits the literary style of apocalyptic literature because the central
figure, Enoch, reveals to the reader what he sees during an extended visit
into the heavens. Among the opening lines is this: “This is a holy vision from
the heavens which the angels showed me: and I heard from them everything
and I understood” (Enoch 1:2).
At the same time, the book is also written in highly symbolic and, at times,
difficult to parse language. Some sections are more difficult to understand
than others. For example, consider the extended observations about the
movement of the sun and moon:
This is the first commandment of the luminaries: The sun is a luminary
whose egress is an opening of heaven, which is located in the direction of
the east, and whose ingress is another opening of heaven, located in the
west. I saw six openings through which the sun rises and six openings
through which it sets. The moon also rises and sets through the same
openings, and they are guided by the stars together with those whom they
lead.
—1 Enoch 73:1–4
101
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

Okay, so maybe these are some kind of calculations based on ancient obser-
vation, but it gets weirder:
These are the names of the sun, the first Oryares, and the second Tomas.
The moon has four names: Its first name is Asenya, its second Abla, the third
Banase, and the fourth ‘Era. These are the two great luminaries.
1 Enoch 78:1–3
There have been attempts to interpret these various names (for example,
based on Hebrew words, “Oryares” may break down into “or” = “light” com-
bined with “heres” = “sun”), but they’re guesses at best and are often read as
corruptions of the suggested Hebrew terms.
In many parts, the visions of Enoch as described to his son Methuselah are
classic examples of apocalyptic-style visions of coming destructions and
calamities:
First I saw a scary vision regarding which I prayed to the Lord . . . I saw in a
vision the sky being hurled down and snatched and falling upon the earth.
When it fell upon the earth, I saw earth being swallowed up into the great
abyss, the mountains being suspended upon mountains, the hills sinking
down upon hills, and tall trees being uprooted and thrown and sinking into
the deep abyss.
—1 Enoch 83
For many centuries, it was widely believed that the six chapters of Daniel in
the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament were the oldest example of apocalyptic liter-
ature. Now, however, scholars know that Enoch is much older than Daniel
and may well be the oldest example of apocalyptic writing in possession.
Fragments and pieces of the book of Enoch found among the Dead Sea Scrolls
have been conclusively dated much earlier than Daniel.
Insight into the diversity of 
Jewish belief and thought
Enoch is a fascinating work because it’s a large book that presents religious
ideas that are quite different from those in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.
For example, Enoch boasts much more speculation, more strange visions and
images, more fascination with things like the movement of the stars and sun,
and even an odd symbolic way of speaking of historical events.
102
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

And this is precisely why it’s so interesting. Obviously some ancient Jews
were interested in Enoch-type religious writing, and therefore — and this is
important — Enoch proves that Jews believed, thought, and practiced their
religious lives in a variety of ways.
Enoch’s influence on Christianity
Did Enoch influence later Christian ideas? Many scholars answer a resound-
ing yes. Enoch scholar Professor George Nickelsburg supplies a nice list of
themes and ideas from the Enoch tradition that he thinks may have influ-
enced some of the writers of the New Testament, including:
 Early references to the “Son of Man”: The Gospels may reflect some of
Enoch’s use of the theme of the “Son of Man.” Scholars had previously
supposed that the Gospels drew this phrase and image mainly from
Ezekiel and especially from Daniel 7, which the Christians then applied
to Jesus. But it’s now equally possible that 1 Enoch 62–63 may be even
more influential on Matthew 25, which portrays Jesus teaching about the
judgment of people who are being judged according to their treatment of
the Son of Man. The Enoch connection is especially strong because the
people being judged are the elite, wealthy, and powerful people who
ignored the needs of others. This is very similar to the point being made
in Matthew, but not similar to Daniel 7!
 Direct quotes from Enoch in the Epistle of Jude, which deals espe-
cially with themes of judgment: Consider this excerpt from the Epistle
of Jude, verses 14–15:
It was also about these that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam,
prophesied, saying, “See, the Lord is coming with ten thousand of his holy
ones, to execute judgment on all, and to convict everyone of all the deeds
of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all
the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
 Quotes from Enoch about the angelic rebellion and references to the
Flood in 2 Peter 2:4: What’s interesting is that this reference in 2 Peter
specifically connects the angelic rebellion and the Flood — a connection
not explicit in Genesis but clear in Enoch!
 Many varied and prominent themes from Enoch in the book of
Revelation:
• Both chronicle a seer’s ascent into heaven.
• Both record similar throne visions.
103
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

• Both are dominated by earthly and heavenly events related to
judgment.
• Both use “Son of Man,” “Suffering Servant,” and Davidic Messiah —
that is, the idea that a king will eventually arise from the line of
David.
• Both mention the locking up of Satan for a period of years as part
of the events of the coming judgment day.
An alternate explanation 
of the Great Flood
One of the enduring fascinations with the Book of Enoch is the fact that it
greatly elaborates on the Flood narrative of Genesis. As it reads now, Genesis
states that the flood was brought about by the sins of humanity, especially
their horrific violence against one another (Genesis 6:11,13). Enoch, however,
brings wider issues into play; the flood was brought about by God in order to
put an end to the horrific mixing of evil, fallen angels with humans. When the
two cohabitated — fallen angels and humans — they gave birth to creatures
on the earth.
Did Enoch simply elaborate on the strange four verses in Genesis 6:1–4?
Scholars have wondered what those verses are referring to for literally cen-
turies, and the modern scholarly view is that these four verses are what’s left
of a tradition that has been lost. Whether Enoch actually supplies the missing
information or, more likely, Enoch simply makes up an explanation for these
verses at a much later time is a matter of continued debate.
Surveying the Sections of 1 Enoch
One of the most interesting and controversial aspects of the Book of Enoch is
that it’s clearly divided into five discreet and different sections. This isn’t
controversial because people disagree with the idea of five sections; rather,
the controversy is over dating the five different sections. Did they all come at
the same time? Or did the Book of Enoch grow over the years, which could
suggest that a community of “believers” treasured these writings, added to
them, and kept them? If this is the case, then what kind of community trea-
sured this book?
104
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Because Enoch places very little emphasis on obeying the laws of Moses,
some historians have suggested that maybe it was a kind of “alternative
Torah” with its own Five Books that contrast with or offer a different kind of
spirituality than the older Torah (the Five Books of Moses with the traditional
laws). Others think this idea is rubbish and argue that the number of sections
isn’t so clearly five, anyway.
This section provides a rough outline of the contents of this amazing book so
that you can form your own opinion on this issue of five sections.
Scholars of Enoch (especially Professor George W. E. Nickelsburg, arguably
the most important scholar working on 1 Enoch in the late 20th century and
the present) suggest that the following ideas are expressed in the Book of
Enoch as a whole:
 The authors live in bad times characterized by violence.
 The times are also characterized by perverse teaching.
 This state of affairs parallels the situation before the Flood.
 Divine judgment will sweep away sinners and their teachers, like the
Flood did once before.
 Those who maintain this proper view do so by divine wisdom and 
teaching.
 The revelation of “watchers” or teachers and the judgment on evil teach-
ers is part of God’s plan for salvation of others. Readers are expected to
learn by observing teachers of truth and falsehood!
 The wisdom of the book is Enoch’s; what the book reveals is what he
learned.
I. The Book of Watchers, Chapters 1–36:
Hooking up with evil angels
The Book of Watchers is one of the oldest sections of Enoch, and it was prob-
ably already completed at least 200 years before the time of Jesus, and
maybe even older than this. Note: Dating Enoch sections is, we should add,
rather controversial business!
The heart of this section is chapters 6–11. This is the section that describes
the revolt of “heavenly watchers” — angels — who do evil on earth and bring
forth God’s judgment. One of the horrible things they do is have sex with
human women, subsequently creating horrendous evil beings. 1 Enoch 7 says
105
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

that the human women gave birth to “great giants” who quickly turned canni-
bal when the people stopped feeding them. The angels’ affairs bring on God’s
angry judgment in the Flood. The Book of 1 Enoch has a somewhat different
explanation of the Flood than Genesis chapter 6.
It’s interesting that Enoch associates certain kinds of magic with evil. This
could be a reflection of the author’s attitudes toward magical rites and prac-
tices. On the other hand, you just gotta love a book that says that two of the
most horrible evils that the bad angels taught humans have to do with
making weapons . . . and women’s cosmetics.
And Azaz’el taught the people the art of making swords and knives, and
shields and breastplates; and he showed to their chosen ones bracelets,
decorations, shadowing of the eye with antimony, ornamentation, the
beautifying of the eyelids, all kinds of precious stones, and all coloring
tinctures and alchemy . . .
—1 Enoch 8
Weaponry and makeup in the same passage? Is Enoch comparing the two as
equally effective tools of conquest? We’ll leave that judgment to you, dear
reader, because we won’t touch that one with a 10-foot shepherd’s staff.
II. The Book of Parables, Chapters 37–71:
The one who is sent
The Book of Parables is usually dated to the first century BCE and therefore
is considered the most recent part of the Book of 1 Enoch. This section is a
detailed description of the judgment that God is preparing, and it introduces
God’s “vice-regent,” the being who will serve as God’s deputy over the 
judgment.
The vice-regent is really the center of attention for many scholars. The figure
goes by many different names and titles, including
 The Elect One
 The Anointed One
 The Son of Man
Christians have long found this section of 1 Enoch very intriguing because it
suggests that some Jews before the time of Jesus were talking about a second,
important heavenly being — and this guy sounds an awful lot like later
Christian descriptions of Jesus. This section is crucial, obviously, for those
who seek a full and complete background to their New Testament study.
106
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

When you look at some specific parts of the Book of Parables, it’s easy to see
why some readers are so fascinated. Check out this passage in which Enoch
watches events in front of him and then asks his angel friend who they’re
seeing:
And I asked . . . Who is this? . . . And he . . . said to me, “This is the Son 
of Man, to whom belongs righteousness, and with whom righteousness
dwells. . . . for the Lord of the Spirits has chosen him, he is destined to be
victorious before the Lord of the Spirits in eternal uprightness. This Son of
Man whom you have seen is the One who would remove the kings and the
mighty ones from their comfortable seats and the strong ones from their
thrones. He shall loosen the reins of the strong and crush the teeth of the
sinners. He shall depose the kings from their thrones and kingdoms.”
—1 Enoch 46:2–5
This section drives some historians crazy. You can almost hear the frenzied
outcry of academic voices shrieking, “Okay, time out!” (Do academics actu-
ally shriek?) Many of these folks suspect that some later Christian did some
creative editing to this section, and they even have a likely scriptural source:
the famous words of Mary known as the “Magnificat” in the first chapter of
the Gospel of Luke:
He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the
thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down the powerful from their
thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things,
and sent the rich away empty. He has helped his servant Israel, in
remembrance of his mercy . . .
—Luke 1:51
But scholars don’t jump to conclusions, and they also ask these questions:
Isn’t it also possible that there were Jews before the time of Jesus who were
expecting God to send someone special to do precisely these kinds of things?
Could Mary have been one of those Jews expecting God to do something
soon? Is it too much to suggest, then, that Mary knew the discussions fea-
tured in the book of Enoch? As is the case with many ancient writings,
instead of providing lots of answers, 1 Enoch tends to raise more interesting
questions.
In any case, Enoch shows that there were all kinds of different ideas about
who the “one sent by God” would be and what he would be like. This is pre-
cisely why so many New Testament readers find Enoch so fascinating. It
shows the variety of views held by Jews in the centuries and decades just
before the beginning of the Christian movement.
107
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

Keep in mind that the Son of Man described in Enoch presides over horren-
dous judgment and the bad people — the kings and rulers — aren’t given a
chance to repent because they find out about the truth too late. Passage 63
talks about these rulers begging for “a little breathing spell,” but that idea’s a
non-starter, so to speak, and the text says that these guys have “no chance to
become believers.”
There’s no denying that a real nasty streak of sadistic, hellfire-type punish-
ment of the wicked runs through 1 Enoch and the Book of Parables in particu-
lar. Most Christians and Jews — then and now —quite rightly find this a bit
disturbing.
III. The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries,
Chapters 72–82: “So, what sign are you?”
The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries contains detailed astronomical and cal-
endrical lore, including descriptions of movement of the moon, sun, and
stars; the number of days in the year; and other celestial topics.
This section, sometimes called “Luminaries,” probably has some roots in the
Persian period ranging from 539–333 BCE, and so many experts consider it to
almost certainly be the oldest, or among the oldest, section of the Book of 1
Enoch. It is, in any case, hardly ever dated after the second century BCE.
Among the more interesting aspects of this complex section is that it estab-
lishes the importance of the solar calendar against the older Jewish and
Mesopotamian traditions of the lunar calendar. Why is this so important?
Perhaps because calendars determine ritual observations, but another inter-
esting reason is that 1 Enoch interprets the regular movements of the stars,
moon, and sun as actually containing moral lessons. How’d the writers come
up with this notion? Because they believed that the regular movements of the
heavenly bodies are regular because they’re obedient to God.
Obviously, the writers of this section didn’t understand things like gravity
and physics, so they concluded that the interesting regularity that they
noticed was a lesson for life, and that lesson was something like: “Behave
yourself and obey God. If the planets can do it, you can, too.”
If you enjoy reading astrological charts, plotting hurricane movements on a
map, and doodling the solar system, then you may find this section of 1
Enoch interesting. It’s certainly an acquired taste.

IV. The Dream Visions, Chapters 83–90:
Tales of sheep and goats
The Dream Visions is a shorter section that contains two visions that Enoch
recounts to his son. The first is about the destruction of the world — not a
surprising topic for a book of apocalyptic literature. But the second vision is
really a zinger and one of the truly amazing bits of this truly amazing book.
The second vision is a long retelling of Jewish history but with all the people
played by animals. It’s known as the Animal Allegory, and it takes the story of
Hebrew history from the beginning all the way to the time of Judas
Maccabeus, around 167–164 BCE. The content of the vision helps scholars
date this section of 1 Enoch.
The Israelites are sheep, the Egyptians are wolves (sounds a bit like Orwell’s
Animal Farm, doesn’t it?), and all the action takes place in the form of a narra-
tive about these animals wandering here and there, facing dangers, and get-
ting new leaders (goats, rams, you get the idea). Here’s a version of the rise of
Judges to assist the Israelites in the days before the kings, when the Israelites
were attacked by other tribes (the dogs, foxes, and boars in this account):
Now the dogs, foxes, and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the
Lord of the sheep raised up another sheep, one from among them — a ram
which would lead them.
—1 Enoch 89:42
The section follows the story of the Bible right up to the time of the
Maccabean Revolution against the Greek rulers over Palestine, stopping
somewhere around 164 BCE.
The Dream Visions is a fascinating read and a good challenge of your Bible
knowledge: see if you can guess what biblical characters are referred to as
the story progresses.
V. The Epistle of Enoch, Chapters 91–105:
Final words
The Epistle of Enoch is written as a letter to Enoch’s son, and it was probably
composed in the second century BCE.
109
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

Like other such letters in Enoch literature, this section is filled with instruc-
tions on living a good life and learning the lessons from Enoch. Of course, all
the Enoch lessons, speeches, and letters were intended for everyone to read,
not only Enoch’s son, so the advice is general and comprehensive.
In Verse 91, the boy is told to “love righteousness,” which isn’t a bad sugges-
tion when you come right down to it. Some other examples from Verse 94
include:
 Walk in the way of peace.
 Be worthy.
 Stay away from oppressors.
 Eschew injustice.
 Don’t put your trust in wealth.
 Don’t forget God.
In reading this section of 1 Enoch, it quickly becomes obvious that people
held considerable resentment toward the powerful of their day — the ones
the writers consider to be responsible for the times being so bad. (This
sounds like a case of the more things change, the more they stay the same.)
Ironically, this theme is why the book of Enoch continued to be read in its
day and remained popular: Blaming the rich and powerful is always in style
and always a popular spectator sport.
Odds and ends
In addition to Enoch’s five basic sections, most scholars conclude that there
exists other material that ought to be considered additional content. These
writings don’t fit into the final (fifth) section but rather are add-ons of differ-
ent kinds of shorter material. Here they are:
 Chapters 106–107, the birth of Noah: This short section is a version of
the birth of Noah, an important figure in all the Enoch literature. In this
section, Noah is praised as a wonderful, righteous man who will survive
the coming judgment. Verse 106 describes Noah’s Flood and reveals that
Noah and his three sons will survive the deluge. (We say “will” because
from Enoch’s perspective, the flood hasn’t happened yet!)
 Chapter 108: This chapter is a final warning about coming judgment,
written as a letter to Enoch’s son, Methuselah. It repeats themes already
found in earlier portions of 1 Enoch and is a very short chapter at the
end of the book.

The Major Religious Themes 
of the Book of 1 Enoch
Enoch claims to give you information that you need. It isn’t so much that
you’re supposed to do something but that you’re supposed to be informed.
This, by the way, is one important reason many Christians and Jews didn’t
like the book of Enoch: To be blunt, it isn’t a very moral book. There are few
instructions for living a good life, caring for others, and knowing what that
means. Enoch isn’t like a prophet who instructs, or a Moses who teaches how
to live, or even a wise teacher who provides proverbs of wise sayings. Enoch
just gives information and descriptions that sometimes imply living a good
life but rarely explain how to go about it. Having said that, the Book of Enoch
is a very religious work.
In this section, we look at some of the major religious themes that stand out
in this long work.
Judgment
Judgment is probably the most central and most important theme of the
whole Book of Enoch. Using the Flood narrative as a kind of universal lesson
about judgment, 1 Enoch condemns those who claim that they’re correct and
that they know that God isn’t going to judge them. But at the same time, the
book encourages those who may waver in their commitment to the way of
truth.
Along the way, however, Enoch describes a very interesting aspect of that
judgment: It will involve a vice-regent — Wisdom personified as an existent
person, drawing on other themes from the Bible such as the fascinating
image of the “Suffering Servant” of the Prophetic book of Isaiah (chapters
52–53), and even the archangel Michael as presented as “one like a Son of
Man” (which probably simply meant that Michael looked like a person) in
Daniel 7.
The ones who are particularly in danger of judgment are the rulers of the
world — the kings and the powerful individuals. The judgment aspect of 
1 Enoch raises all sorts of questions: Is Enoch, then, a statement that repre-
sents the anger of the oppressed? Is it a kind of apocalyptic religion of libera-
tion? Or is it just vindictive literature written by people who love to sit
around and talk about how the powerful will pay someday?
111
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

We think that the answer is all of the above. By reading about the judgment 
of the powerful and elite, you’re not only warned not to behave like them 
but also assured that justice will be done — eventually, even if not in the 
present age.
The judgment theme is clear: Those who righteously die will be vindicated,
and those who escape justice will be punished. In the end times described in
Enoch, judgment will make injustice right again because the created order
will be restored.
Sin as rebellion
According to Enoch, sin was brought into the world because of the fallen
angels — a sort of heavenly revolt. (Note that Enoch pretty much blows off
the whole Adam and Eve and the forbidden fruit story!)
112
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 
Why read this “judgmental” stuff?
An ancient book like Enoch discusses judgment
on nearly every page. Final, harsh, and severe
judgment for some, and wonderful paradise for
others. These are rarely popular ideas in the
modern world, so it’s reasonable to wonder why
people enjoy reading about judgment (both then
and now).
Some people think that Enoch represents a
group of people who consider themselves a
persecuted minority, and that’s why they’re so
interested in judgment. There certainly is a vin-
dictive streak in Enoch, but there also are ways
in which judgment has been a comforting theme
close to the hearts of many people who have
suffered from the hands of the powerful.
Consider Negro spirituals that deal with the bib-
lical Flood story. In one venerable old song,
people are pounding on the Ark, trying to get
Noah to let them in! Yet the Flood story in
Genesis says nothing about people pleading
with Noah and nothing about knocking on
doors. But this judgment theme is a focus of the
old spirituals . . . and it isn’t too difficult to figure
out why!
Judgment is an attractive subject if you believe
that you’ve suffered unjustly, that the rich and
powerful have gotten away with murder and
think that they’ll continue to get away with it. In
that case, judgment literature is strangely com-
forting because it reaffirms your belief that right
is right and wrong is wrong, and if it looks like
“right” isn’t doing too well just now, these writ-
ings and songs reassure you that judgment is
coming — for all.
Next time you wonder why ancient people loved
reading judgment stories, think about how you
feel when the criminal is led away in handcuffs
at the end of CSI. Hmm. Maybe Horatio Caine,
Perry Mason, and Judge Judy are simply
modern versions of Enoch?

But, the book cautions, sin is still also the responsibility of each human
being. You can pay attention to the warnings of Enoch, or you can (and
almost certainly will) suffer the consequences. The saved are those who
respond well to the wisdom and warnings of Enoch; the others are the sin-
ners. Thus there’s little discussion of forgiveness because people tend to be
divided into the good and the bad.
In fact, one of the main arguments that Enoch isn’t a strongly Christian docu-
ment is based precisely on the absence of the notions of repentance and
change, which are major themes of the New Testament. In Enoch, there’s little
possibility of change: You’re in, or you’re out.
The elevation of Enoch and 
devaluation of Moses?
Some scholars of Enoch note that for a Jewish book, there’s precious little
about obeying the laws and commandments — that is, the laws of Moses.
If there’s one thing that defines what it means to be a Jew in the ancient
world, obeying the laws of Moses is right up there. Yet, hardly anything in
Enoch talks about this. The book tells people to be “righteous” but doesn’t
really explain what that means. You get the idea that righteous means “Pay
attention to Enoch’s words.” So, did the people who wrote Enoch have a
lower opinion of Moses and the Mosaic laws? Some Enoch scholars place
great credibility in this idea.
Forewarned is forearmed
The writers of 1 Enoch believed that they were informing everyone of the
truth. Readers of Enoch believed that the book contained dire warnings of
the consequences for those who ignore the book and its teachings and there-
fore aren’t prepared for the coming judgment.
But how are readers supposed to know that these words and teachings are
true? It’s simple: Enoch went to heaven, so you can take what he says to the
bank.
But in other sections, the book seems to suggest that you can also figure out
the truth by thinking about Jewish history (the animal story in the Dream
Visions section is a version of Jewish history; refer to the section “IV. The
Dream Visions, Chapters 83–90: Tales of sheep and goats” earlier in this 
113
Chapter 6: The Strange Story of the Book of Enoch

chapter for more). The book also suggests that you can figure out the truth
by just being observant and watching how the planets, stars, sun, and moon
move — which is the point, it seems, of the extended discussions in the 
sections on the Heavenly Luminaries.
So we would be remiss not to acknowledge the contradictions in Enoch and
to suggest that its inconsistencies may be part of the reason Enoch never
made it into the Old Testament.

Borrowed from the Greeks
In This Chapter

 Exploring works of astrology and guidelines for living
 Borrowing the style and format of plays
 Piecing together the possible sources and dubious claims of fragments
T
he Jews and the Christians learned how to write different kinds of books
and writings. Some of these writings have their roots deep in Jewish his-
tory (Prophetic books, for example, or Psalms and other poetry) while other
writing styles were learned from other people. Modern biblical scholars, for
example, are pretty sure that the ancient Hebrews learned how to write
Wisdom Literature (that is, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Sirach) from the
ancient Egyptians because Egyptian “Wisdom” writing is so much older than
Hebrew versions. Also, some of the Hebrew writings actually copy specific
passages from older Egyptian writings. For example, compare Proverbs
22:17–23:11 with the ancient Egyptian “Wisdom of Amenemope”; the latter is
historically dated well before the actual papyrus itself, which is from the sev-
enth to sixth centuries BCE.
When Jews encountered another major literary civilization, the Greeks, there
was bound to be some mutual influence and, in fact, some mutual admiration.
Like the Roman civilization, which also deeply admired the Greeks, it’s now
perfectly obvious to historians that many ancient Jews were more than a
little impressed with Greek ways of life, thought, and living — and some
Jewish literature reflects the deep influence from the “classical” world of
Greece and later Rome.
In this chapter, we survey some ancient writings that clearly reflect Jewish
interest in the Greek world and the times after Alexander the Great con-
quered this region (333 BCE). Virtually all these writings are available in

English in various sources, but coauthor Daniel recommends the wonderful,
two-volume book The Old Testament Pseudopigrapha, edited by James
Charlesworth (see the appendix for full description). Charlesworth’s edited
volumes contain the entire text of the works that we now discuss in this
chapter, and Charlesworth’s volumes also provide scholarly comments by
various experts and translators.
Writings from the Greek Period (333–64 BCE) were typically intended to
defend the Jews and their religious beliefs and practices, but they usually
weren’t considered “inspired” — especially if they borrowed Greek literary
forms! They were written to defend Jewish beliefs and sometimes used and
cited the older writings that eventually did become part of the Bible. Still,
you have to admit . . . it would have been cool to have had a play in the Bible,
wouldn’t it?
The Sibylline Oracles
In the ancient Greek world (and far beyond it!), there was commonly a leg-
endary “seer” who was often described as an old woman. Purportedly, she
could peer into the unknown and give reports, or oracles, of what she saw.
Sibyl is, by all accounts, the Queen of Prophecy, Miss Prediction, and the
Oxford Dictionary of Anticipated Events. So widespread was the fame of the
earliest “Sibyl” that she ended up multiplying, so to speak. At one time, many
Sibyls were giving predictions and speeches all around the ancient world. So
you got your “Nostradamus,” your “Edgar Cayce,” and your evening news
weatherperson (okay, maybe that last one isn’t so good at predictions). But
in the ancient world none of these prognosticators had anything on “Sibyl”!
Cities became famous for their own Sibyls, so it’s hardly a surprise that some
ancient chambers of commerce sat around saying, “What we need in this
town is a Sibyl!”
Sibyl’s influence on Jewish writers
No one knows if there ever was a real Sibyl back in history who started all
this legendary stuff, but references to her start as early as the fifth century
BCE! So, anything that claimed to be a message from a Sibyl commanded
instant attention.
In fact, it appears that it wasn’t long before some Jewish writers, and also
Christian writers later on, decided they liked this Sibyl stuff (it sounded
rather like other aspects of Jewish writing) and began using this style of writ-
ing. The result is the Sibylline Oracles.
116
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

The Oracles is a rather large collection of materials, now referred to as Books
1–14, although much of the collection is fragmented. The dates of this mater-
ial begin as early as the third to second centuries BCE, and it continued to be
produced and added to after the seventh to eighth centuries CE. Obviously,
this chapter is particularly interested in those portions of the Sibylline
Oracles that show earlier thought and influence. Note: One of the most
important modern scholars to work on these writings is Professor John J.
Collins, and it’s his translation into English that we cite along the way (it’s
also in the collection that we recommend in the chapter’s introduction).
Sibyl speaks: Portions of 
the Sibylline Oracles
Typical of all the Sibylline Oracles are somewhat vague “predictions” of the
rise and fall of empires, individual rulers, and even palace intrigue. These
details are often important for modern historians trying to identify a specific
historic ruler so that modern readers have a better idea of the time period of
the writing and the possibly historical information that is contained.
Tales of Jewish history and connections to biblical writings
The Jewish character of these adaptations of Sibylline literature is clear from
the prophetic nature of judgment passages such as this:
Therefore the Immortal will inflict on all mortals
Disaster and famine and woes and groans
And war and pestilence and lamentable ills
Because they were not willing to piously honor the immortal begetter of all
men, but honored idols made by hand.
—Sibylline Oracles 3:600–605
The Jewish or Christian content is further apparent from specific passages
that praise the history of the Jews, explicitly refer to the coming of Jesus, or
call for repentance, like this one:
Ah, wretched mortals, change these things, and do not
Lead the great God to all sorts of anger, but abandon
daggers and groanings, murders and outrages,
And wash your whole bodies in perennial rivers.
Stretch out your hands to heaven and ask forgiveness
For your previous deeds and make propitiation . . .
—Sibylline Oracles 4:160–165
117
Chapter 7: Plays, Poets, and Other Ideas Borrowed from the Greeks

In Book 1, for example, you see very early the influence of a Jewish writer
who speaks of the Creation account with some interesting variations on the
Genesis material. While describing Adam, for example, the writer states that
he was alone but goes on to say this:
Behold another form like his own. God himself indeed took a bone from his
flank and made Eve, a wonderful maidenly spouse, whom he gave to this
man to live with him in the garden. And he, when he saw her, was suddenly
greatly amazed in spirit.
—Sibylline Oracles 1:20–30
Connections to non-biblical Jewish writings
There are important connections in Sibylline thought to other non-biblical
Jewish writings. For example, the Book of 1 Enoch refers to heavenly “watch-
ers” that appear to be angels. In the Sibylline Oracles, their specific creation
is mentioned.
The Oracles also provide delightful additions to biblical tradition, such as the
notion that God told Noah to preach to the world so that the people might be
saved before God determined to flood the earth:
Noah, embolden yourself and proclaim repentance to all the peoples, so that
all may be saved . . .
—Sibylline Oracles 1:127–128
Brain teasers
Part of the fame and attraction of the Sibylline literature is the difficult and
puzzling passages that lend themselves to multiple interpretations and mean-
ings. Consider, for example, this “riddle” on the name for God, which still
defies modern attempts to work out what the writer is getting at:
I am the one who is, but you consider in your heart . . .
I have nine letters, I am of four syllables. Consider me.
The first three have two letters each.
The last has the rest, and five are consonants.
The entire number is: twice eight
Plus three hundred, three tens and seven. If you know who I am
You will not be uninitiated in my wisdom.
—Sibylline Oracles 1:135–145
118
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Even though we are talking about largely Jewish writings, occasionally it
looks like a later Christian writer has inserted a few lines. This reminds us
that it was often early Christians who preserved these writings — and just
couldn’t resist making a few comments as they recopied the texts! Check out
this one that sounds as if the pagan Sibyl recognizes the significance of Jesus:
I speak from my heart of the famous son of the Immortal . . .
He will walk the waves; he will undo the sickness of men;
He will raise the dead. He will repel many woes.
From one wallet men will have surfeit of bread
When the house of David brings forth a shoot . . .
—Sibylline Oracles 6:1, 6:12–15
The Treatise of Shem: An Early 
Astrology Column
The Greeks loved watching the stars and making up stories to go with the
shapes and forms they saw. In fact, they also rather liked the zodiac tradition.
So, it seems, did some ancient Jews as well! The Treatise of Shem gives clear
astrological guidance in the general terms familiar to those who are into this
kind of stuff but vague enough to be impressive to all (for example, “You will
walk through a door today” . . . that kind of thing . . .). Here’s an example that
refers to Hebrew letters:
And if the year begins in Taurus: Everyone whose name contains a Beth, or
Yudh, or Kaph will become ill, or be wounded by an iron [weapon]. And
there will be fighting . . .
—Treatise of Shem 2:1–2
Historians note that this work isn’t very “Jewish” except for the occasional
reference to Passover in the chapter on Virgo, for example, or references to
prayers to the Living God in the chapter on Libra. Still, coauthor Daniel
rather likes the end of the chapter on Pisces, which hopefully promises,
“Then at the end of the year there will be peace and prosperity among men,
and love and harmony among all the kinds who are on the entire earth. . . .”
(On a personal note, I can’t help but wonder as to when precisely such love
and harmony is supposed to occur on our planet.)
This work, which is dated by historians to no later than 31–20 BCE, is quite
significant for one essential reason: It proves Jewish interest in the zodiac
signs and thus at least some Jewish interest in the entire realm of astrology.
The interest is probably from Jews living in the dispersed Diaspora, where
they would have had more contact with astrological lore.
119
Chapter 7: Plays, Poets, and Other Ideas Borrowed from the Greeks

One of the many reasons why this interest by some ancient Jews in zodiac
lore is a bit of a surprise is that the Old Testament is clearly opposed to any-
thing that smacks of “worshipping” the stars. Here are two passages as 
evidence:
And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun,
and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be
driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath
divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
—Deuteronomy 4:19
And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had
ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the
places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to
the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
—2 Kings 23:5
Most historians take these passages to be a not-too-subtle condemnation of
any kind of astrological speculation.
On the other hand, there are subtle suggestions here and there that some
kind of astrological interests remained a part of Jewish (and later Christian)
interest. Note the astrological suggestions of young Joseph’s dream: He had
another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “Look, I have had another
dream: the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me”
(Genesis 37:9). Furthermore, New Testament historians often point out that
the famous “wise men” must have been referring to some kind of astrological
knowledge when they came to find the young Jesus:
In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise
men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, “Where is the child who has
been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have
come to pay him homage.”
—Matthew 2:1–2
Finally, recent historians have suggested that a key to the book of Revelation
may well be its interest in interpreting constellations and astronomical phe-
nomenon (comets, heavenly bodies, and so on) as symbolic of future events
to come!
Where previously these suggestions would not have been taken too seriously,
in fact, the Treatise of Shem is a work that clearly establishes the possibility
of Jewish and therefore Christian interest in precisely these kinds of issues.
120
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Because both mainline Jewish and orthodox Christian tradition eventually
condemned any kind of astrology as contrary to a belief in God’s ultimate
control of the universe, you can see why a document like the Treatise of
Shem would be controversial. Still, like so many of the other writings that we
examine in this book, the Treatise shows the wide variety of ideas among
Jews and Christians in the days before “correct thinking” tended to weed out
unapproved interests.
Pseudo-Phocylides: Wisdom 
and Rules for Living
Phocylides (pronounced fo-sill-i-dees) was an actual ancient Greek poet from
the sixth century BCE who was famous for writing wise collections of advice.
Ancient writers cite him for the work entitled Pseudo-Phocylides, and although
very little of his own writing has survived, like the Sibyls (refer to the earlier
section “The Sibylline Oracles”), Phocylides is a famous “source” of wise and
ethical sayings. Therefore, the attributions to Phocylides are another clear
example of a Jewish writer “borrowing” the style of a pagan, Greek writer in
order to write a Jewish version of a Greek work. It’s generally thought that
this writer wrote between 50 BCE and 100 CE, so it is roughly from the same
time period as Jesus.
“Pseudo” in front of the title of an ancient writing always means the same
thing: Modern historians do not accept that it was written by the person it
claims to be written by! The general name used for almost all this kind of
material we’re looking at in this chapter is “Pseudopigrapha,” which means
“writings under a false author’s name.”
Scholars speculate about why anyone would want to write under the name of
a non-Jewish poet or philosopher, of course. Some say that the writings were
a way for Jews to give advice to non-Jews (or even preach to them) or for
Jews to prove that their wisdom was just as good as pagan wisdom. Others
believe it was a way for Jews to prove that wise non-Jews still recognized the
power of the Jewish tradition. In any case, Pseudo-Phocylides is yet another
fascinating example of Jewish interest in using a decidedly non-Jewish form
in order to communicate their own values.
Most of the “wisdom” of Pseudo-Phocylides is pretty much standard biblical
stuff. Table 7-1 presents some examples from Pseudo-Phocylides with biblical
references so that you can see how closely Pseudo-Phocylides parallels bibli-
cal ideas.

this:

For what has been done can no more be undone.
—Pseudo-Phocylides 55–56
But Pseudo-Phocylides isn’t without a few surprises, including this one sug-
gesting possible Christian pacifist influences:
Put on a sword, not for bloodshed but for protection
But may you not need it at all, neither outside the law nor justly
For if you kill an enemy, you stain your hand.

Ezekiel the Tragedian
The Greeks wrote many plays, and among the most popular form of Greek
play was the tragedy. (This form was later adapted by William Shakespeare
with rather impressive results, as you know.)
Greek tragedy focuses on the adventures — and also misfortunes — of lead
characters who are often historical persons. Sometimes, it explores how “the
gods” have intervened into the lives of humans. Tragedies are always matters
of serious events, as opposed to comedies. Furthermore, they’re usually 
written in a certain Greek literary style (iambic trimeter, as it happens) that
happens to be the style adopted by the writer of Ezekiel as well!
Tragedies were written in a set form borrowed by a Jewish writer (presumed
to be writing about 200 BCE) to write a play about the Exodus. So, Ezekiel
isn’t about the Prophet Ezekiel but rather is the name of the proposed writer
of this play.
One historian, R.G. Robertson, suggests that the Greek play forms used by
famous Greek playwrights like Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides may have
especially influenced Ezekiel the Tragedian because he lived in Alexandria,
and the Greek rulers of Alexandria famously stole the originals of the Greek
texts from Athens and sent copies to Alexandria. The fame of this daring
action — aimed to supply their famous “library” with famous documents —
may have partially inspired a Jewish playwright living in Alexandria.
The various “scenes” in Ezekiel the Tragedian include:
 The birth of Moses and saving the baby in the basket from the Nile
 Moses breaking up a fight between Hebrews, who then reveal that they
know that Moses has killed someone
 Moses at the burning bush
 The Ten Plagues in Egypt
 The escape of the Hebrews
123
Chapter 7: Plays, Poets, and Other Ideas Borrowed from the Greeks

The Exodus . . . live on stage!?
Was this play supposed to be on stage? Was it ever seen? Scholars debate
this point, but Robertson observes that the fact that many aspects of the
writing have survived suggests that it was especially adapted for the stage.
Robertson’s English translation attempts to maintain some of the meter (that
is, the rhythm of the verse) to preserve the way it may have sounded as it
was performed.
One reason these questions are so interesting is that, if Ezekiel the Tragedian
was seen, it would be a striking indication of how deeply engaged the ancient
Jews may have been with surrounding cultures! Did Jewish citizens of Greek
cities actually attend Greek plays? Would they have considered the religious
associations with ancient Greek theatre to be “pagan worship” and therefore
forbidden to Jewish attendance? Perhaps Ezekiel was written precisely to
allow Jews to attend a theatre performance that wasn’t religiously offensive.
The following speech by God describing the plagues and their visceral
unpleasantness gives you an idea of the drama of seeing and listening to this
play:
A host of frogs and lice I’ll cast on earth
Then sprinkle aches from the furnace round,
And ulcerous sores shall thus burst forth on men.
And swarms of lies shall come and sore afflict
The men of Egypt . . .
Darkness I’ll decree for three whole days,
And locusts send, who shall the residue
Of food consume and every blade of grass . . .
—Ezekiel the Tragedian, lines 135–146
Consider another surviving scene: Picture an Egyptian character as he
describes the Hebrews who have left Egypt after the plagues but are now
seeing the coming of Pharaoh’s forces:
The Hebrew, when confronted by our host
Lay strewn about hard by the sandy shore
In masses there upon the Red Sea’s strand
Some were engaged in caring for the young
Together with their wives, worn out with toil,
With many flocks and herds and household stuff.
And they, all unprotected, without arms,
On seeing us sent up a doleful cry,
‘gainst heaven they inveighed, their father’s God . . .
—Ezekiel the Tragedian, lines 204–212

It’s tempting to stand up, raise your hands in dramatic gesture, and read this
out with great flair, imagining such speeches on a stage. Great stuff! It’s too
bad that more of this play hasn’t survived — it would be fascinating to watch
an ancient Greek-style play written by a Jewish writer dealing with biblical
history! If it weren’t for the early Christian writers who quoted heavily from
the many different books they read, we wouldn’t even have these few 
fragments.
A display of unusual religious ideas
Historians are also interested in this play from Ezekiel because of the develop-
ment of certain unusual religious ideas. One scene reminds readers of apoca-
lyptic visions when Moses has a dream that he sees the throne of God and
God gets up and motions for Moses to sit down and view the earth from
“God’s perspective.” Such visions are more common in apocalyptic literature,
but the prominence given to Moses as one who will “work with God” in heaven
is a striking development. Also, the writer dwells a bit on the Egyptian reac-
tion to God’s miracles and the destruction of the armies of Pharaoh. We sup-
pose, however, that one would expect more, well, drama in a drama!
Fragments of Greek-Influenced 
Jewish Writers
If ever there were a truly frustrating exercise, it’s the examination of frag-
ments of books that no longer exist. Fragments are either of the following:
 Actual pieces of books that have survived in archaeological discoveries
and have deteriorated so badly that they aren’t easily read
 Writings that are quoted in later works
Quotations are, by far, the greatest source of fragments, but they’re more
frustrating than actual pieces because they raise one very disturbing ques-
tion: Can we trust this ancient author not only to be right that such a writing
once existed but also to have quoted it accurately and in detail? The answer?
We may never know!
125
Chapter 7: Plays, Poets, and Other Ideas Borrowed from the Greeks

Obviously, with such questions, it’s only possible to look at some samples of
these kinds of writings and offer brief observations about how significant
they may be. These debated fragments reveal that
 Jews were very much in dialogue with their surrounding cultures, and
especially with Greek culture; historians have only a smattering of the
total amount of material they wrote in this dialogue.
 Jews frequently felt the need to defend themselves in intellectual argu-
ments about their history and their faith, and they took up Greek liter-
ary forms to do so.
Clearly, the ancient Jews had plenty to say and didn’t back down! The follow-
ing sections offer a brief selection of some of these fragments.
As modern readers of ancient history, people are often totally dependent on
ancient writers who tried to quote heavily from literature that they knew.
Sadly, for many ancient writers, these quotes are the only fragments of their
literary work that has been preserved. In other words, the writers’ works gen-
uinely are “lost books.” The vast majority of this material is “defensive” or
represents dialogue and explanation to non-Jews. If it was helpful and inter-
esting at the time, it continued to be read, but it’s easy to see how some
material that was too topical eventually dropped into disuse, was eventually
forgotten, and disappeared. It’s another case of survival boiling down to “it
was still used over and over again.”
Philo the Epic Poet
The main interest in the Philo fragments, mostly quoted in a Christian source
(Eusebius, fourth century CE), is the Jewish use of a specifically Greek form
of poetry. The poetic aspect isn’t easily demonstrated in English because of
the translation, of course, but we can note one or two interesting themes that
are developed in these fragments. What you can presume is that the entire
work must have summarized, in poetic form, aspects of Jewish history. Here’s
an example passage:
From them the Most High, great Lord of all created a most blessed spot, even
from of old, yea from the days of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, rich in
children, from whom was Joseph, who was interpreter of dreams for the
scepter bearer of Egypt’s throne, revolving time’s secrets with the flood of
fate . . .
—Fragment 2 (ed. Charlesworth, 783–784)

Orphica: Writings imitating 
Orpheus the poet
Orpheus, one of the most famous ancient Greek poets, is widely referred to in
classical literature. He’s believed to have perfected the playing of the lyre and
to have written a number of ancient hymns to accompany his playing.
References to Orphean “hymns” and poetic lines are found as early as the
fifth century. These particular fragments, however, are clearly Jewish
attempts to write “Orphic” poetry in the pagan form, and they’re only known
because they’re quoted in the writings of the early Christian Church Father,
Eusebius, from whom comes many such quotations of works that are now
lost.
Some of the common questions about Orphica include:
 Were these attempts to write a “Jewish Orpheus” — a kind of religious
propaganda?
 Were they attempts to convert Greeks by using a famous Greek writer
and claiming that he came to understand the truth of the Jewish God?
 Were they intended for Jewish consumption only?
The answers to these questions are mysteries, as are the lines of poetry
themselves, which are rather cryptic descriptions of God but descriptions,
nonetheless, that are vaguely familiar to readers of the Hebrew Bible/Old
Testament.
For example, compare the following passage of Orphica to descriptions in
Isaiah 66:1, “Thus says the Lord: Heaven is my throne and the earth is my
footstool”:
I will sing for those for whom it is lawful, but you uninitiated, close your
doors . . .
My son, I will point it out to you, whenever I notice his footsteps,
And the strong hand of the mighty God.
But I do not see him, because around [him] a cloud is set up . . .
Yes he after this is established in the great heaven
On a golden throne. He stands with his feet on the earth.
He stretches out his right hand to the ends of the ocean.
The foundations of the mountains trembles within [his] anger
—Orphica (ed. Charlesworth, 799)
127
Chapter 7: Plays, Poets, and Other Ideas Borrowed from the Greeks

Aristobulus: The first Jewish philosopher
There are five fragments attributed to the writer Aristobulus. The main inter-
est in these fragments, which are quoted in early Christian writing, is that
Aristobulus tries to mix Jewish religious ideas and Greek philosophy. In fact,
he’s sometimes called the “First” Jewish Philosopher (something that would
have been considered an oxymoron in earlier times — Greeks did philosophy,
Jews did religion!) and thus is considered part of a tradition that developed
more in the work of the later Jewish philosopher, Philo of Judea, from whom
many writings are available.
The Aristobulus fragments claim to be explanations to Greek rulers about the
religion of the Jews. As such, Aristobulus attempts to explain aspects of
Hebrew descriptions of God in the Hebrew writings that may raise objections.
For example, early in the second fragment (quoted from Eusebius)
Aristobulus notes that the Hebrews talk about God having hands, legs, arms,
and so on. But Aristobulus explains that this should not be understood 
literally:
Now “hands” are clearly thought of even in our own time in a more general
way. For when you, being king, send out forces, wishing to accomplish
something, we say, “The King has a mighty hand” and the hearers are
referred to the power which you have. Now Moses indicates this also in our
Law when he speaks thus, “God brought you out of Egypt with a mighty
hand” and again he says that God said to him, “I will send forth my hand
and I will strike the Egyptians” . . .
—Fragment 2:6–8 (ed. Charlesworth, 838)
Even more interesting is the claim (apparently quoted with approval by
Eusebius!) that many of the Greek philosophers learned some of their better
ideas from the Hebrew writings. After referring to the importance of Moses
and his laws, Aristobulus writes:
And it seems to me that Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato with great care
follow him in all respects. They copy him when they say that they heard the
voice of God, when they contemplate the arrangement of the universe, so
carefully made and so unceasingly held together by God . . .
—Fragment 4 (tr. Charlesworth, 840)
Interestingly, this passage goes on to quote from the Jewish Orpheus passage
that we discuss in the preceding section!
128
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Eupolemus: Third-hand quotations
The work of Eupolemus that’s available for study is another series of quoted
fragments of a history of the Jews written by a Greek-speaking Jewish author
who probably completed his work before 100 BCE.
Once again, scholars are dependent on extensive quotations from the two
Christian writers Clement of Alexandria (150–216 CE) and the voluminous
Eusebius (260–340 CE) to give them a taste of this Jewish writer’s work. Both
of these Christian writers, however, quote another work by Alexander
Polyhistor, and so the Eupolemus fragments are third-hand quotations! This
separation from the source has led to some interesting mistakes; in one case,
scholars have figured out what may have happened to cause a change in the
text. Consider this fragment that discusses King David’s decision to build a
Temple for God in Jerusalem, described in the Bible in 2 Samuel and repeated
in 1 Chronicles:
Since David wanted to build a temple for God, he asked God to show him a
place for the altar. Then an angel appeared to him standing above the place
where the altar is set up in Jerusalem and ordered him not to set up the
temple, because he was defiled with human blood and had waged war for
many years. His name was Dianathan. He gave him a command that he
should entrust the building to his son . . .
—Fragment 2, 30 (ed. Charlesworth, 866)
The biblical story of David and the Temple doesn’t describe an angel in this
episode about the Temple, but it does describe the intervention of the
Prophet Nathan. Furthermore, although the passage in 1 Samuel states that
David was not to build the Temple, it only explains the reason — because
David was a man of war — in 1 Chronicles. It seems clear that somewhere
along the line the prophet Nathan’s involvement turned into the intervention
of an “angel” with the name “Dianathan” (dia means “through” or “by means
of,” so it’s possible that the name was intended to mean “by means of
Nathan”).
The fragment also gives rather extensive details about the actual construc-
tion of the Temple — no doubt intended to impress non-Jewish readers
already familiar with impressive Greek structures!
This work of Eupolemus also contains some interesting letters written by
Solomon to seek assistance in building the Temple — letters to foreign rulers
who seem only too pleased to help him out! None of this is in the Bible, of
course, but you have to admit that it adds a nice flair to the story!

Chapter 7: Plays, Poets, and Other Ideas Borrowed from the Greeks

Cleodemus Malchus and where 
the word “Africa” came from
In a short paragraph quoted by Josephus (and thus thought to date before
100 BCE), a certain “Cleodemus Malchus” (whoever he was) indicates some
rather spurious historical claims about the origins of the word “Africa.”
He claims that the continent’s name is derived from two of the sons of
Abraham:
 Iafra
 Afera
Such claims to speak with authority about foreign places and people are 
very common in ancient writings and are usually to be treated with great
suspicion.
Artapanus: A story about 
Moses the inventor!?
A certain ancient writer called Artapanus is quoted in Eusebius, and although
thought to have written 300–200 BCE, Artapanus is quoted indirectly by
Eusebius from Alexander Polyhistor.
Artapanus is quoted as defending the history of the Jews and Jewish ideas
from attacks by Greeks and other pagan writers. So, these fragments contain
high praise for Jewish “heroes” like Abraham, Joseph, and especially Moses.
In fact, there’s a lot of material about Moses from some source entirely
unknown to us now.
The bottom line is that the ideas quoted from Artapanus are probably simply
made up, such as the notion that Moses was an inventor:
. . . he invented boats and devices for stone construction and the Egyptian
arms and the implements for drawing water and for warfare and 
philosophy . . .
—Fragment 3
According to the fragment, Moses was loved by the masses, who then called
him Hermes (the name of a Greek god). This is a clear attempt to mix Jewish
characters with Greek religious ideas.
130
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Pseudo-Hecataeus on the Jews
Some fragments are attributed to the real historian, Hecataeus of Abdera
(who lived in the fourth century BCE). Scholars have many extensive quota-
tions from the genuine Hecataeus, and many of these deal with the Jews. It
appears that he knew something about them, but even the genuine parts
(quoted in the work of a later writer) have some very interesting variations
on the descriptions of Moses.
However, modern historians are highly doubtful of other fragments attributed
to Hecataeus, no doubt because of his significance as a writer; as a result,
they refer to the writings as Pseudo-Hecataeus. It seems that many early
Jewish and Christian writers made overly enthusiastic claims by using
sources that they couldn’t possibly hope to confirm (sometimes on hearsay,
other times from written sources), but they went ahead and used this mater-
ial if it served their purpose!
The most interesting of these Pseudo-Hecataeus quotations claims to illus-
trate the argument that the Jews were a steadfast people who wouldn’t give
up their faith:
Therefore, even though spoken ill of by their neighbors and by foreign
visitors, and even though frequently treated with disrespect by the Persian
kings and satraps, their determination could not be shaken. Without
defense, they meet tortures, and the worst kinds of death on behalf of these
laws, and they do not disown their hereditary way of life.
—Pseudo-Hecataeus 191 (ed Charlesworth 918)

Apocalyptic Literature 
(a.k.a. Really Strange Books)
In This Chapter
 Hearing from Zephaniah, Ezra, and Sedrach
 Digging into the books of Baruch
 Reading non-biblical accounts about Abraham, Adam, and Elijah
 Following Isaiah’s path of martyrdom and ascension
 Elaborating on the story of Jacob’s ladder
 Charting the course of a geographical apocalypse
A
s we explain in Chapter 3, an entire category of ancient religious writing
is known as “apocalyptic” literature (from the Greek word meaning 
“revelation”). Typically, these writings involve long, detailed descriptions of
visions experienced by the writer. They often use bizarre imagery (multi-
headed animals, combinations of animals, seas of glass, many days of travel
into the heavens, and so on) and just as often involve gruesome descriptions
of “final judgment” that punishes evildoers and rewards good people.
Part of the point of these writings appears to be conveying the message, “Be
good . . . or else you’ll experience this stuff!” Also, these writings typically
involve a conversation between the person seeing the vision and an angel or
heavenly being who explains some of the meaning of the vision. Most of these
visions symbolically describe events in the writers’ own time, but they also
shed light on things that were expected to happen soon. In short, the mes-
sage is that change is coming.
So much apocalyptic literature has survived that scholars can easily con-
clude that lots of it was written and that it must have been very popular read-
ing indeed! Suffice it to say that these strange visions allowed the writers to
explore all kinds of ideas and emotions that readers were eager to absorb.

Although there were lots of apocalyptic writings, only a couple of them made
it into the Bible: Daniel in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and the
Revelation to John in the New Testament. In general, apocalyptic imagery
was controversial and had little enduring moral or spiritual value beyond its
bizarre imagery. The strongest reason cited by many historians for why there
isn’t more of this type of literature in the Bible is that there was a great deal
of apocalyptic enthusiasm behind the Bar Kochba Revolt of 132–135 CE, and
when that ended badly (there was heavy loss of life when Rome put down the
revolt), Jewish communities lost interest in apocalyptic speculation. When
the angels didn’t show up to help with the revolt, people may have thought
that it was time to read the religious stuff about “settling in for the long haul”
rather than preparing for coming judgment.
In this chapter, we explore some of these strange writings that never made it
into the Bible (and in most cases, you can be thankful for that!), giving you
brief samples so that you can decide for yourself whether they’re something
you’d like to read fully in an English translation. Note: For this chapter, most
of the English translations are found in the two-volume work edited by
Charlesworth, Old Testament Apocrypha and Pseudopigrapha (see the appen-
dix for all references used).
The Apocalypse of Zephaniah
The first century BCE to first century CE work the Apocalypse of Zephaniah is
named for the Prophet Zephaniah of the Bible only because the visionary
says in the writing, “I, Zephaniah, saw these things in my vision. . . .” Of
course, this work was written many centuries after the traditional time of the
Prophet Zephaniah and thus was written under a pseudonym borrowed from
the earlier history of ancient Israel. Zephaniah was actually a Prophet from
the sixth century BCE.
This apocalyptic work is notable for themes that are familiar to readers of the
book of Revelation in the New Testament: For example, angels blow on trum-
pets, and there are descriptive passages in which the visionary talks about
seeing people being punished in judgment. What’s really interesting about
the Apocalypse of Zephaniah, however, is that the vision has a very personal
impact on the visionary; when he sees people being punished in Hades by
horrible-looking creatures, he wonders what they are:
When I saw them, I was afraid. I said to that angel who walked with me, “Of
what sort are these?” He said to me, “These are the servants of all creation
who come to the souls of ungodly men and bring them and leave them in
this place. They spend three days going around with them in the air before
they bring them and cast them into their eternal punishment.”
I said, “I beseech you, O Lord, don’t give them authority to come to me!” . . .
—Apocalypse of Zephaniah 4 (ed. Charlesworth, 511)
134
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

The Apocalypse of Zephaniah also expresses the idea of a heavenly book in
which one’s sins are recorded! Zephaniah, to his horror, is allowed to read
the book on his own sins, and describes the experience as follows:
I found that all my sins which I had done were written in it, those which I
had done from my youth until this day. They were all written upon that
manuscript of mine without there being a false word in them. If I did not go
to visit a sick man or a widow, I found it written down as a shortcoming
upon my manuscript. If I did not visit an orphan . . . A day on which I did not
fast or pray . . .
—Apocalypse of Zephaniah 7 (ed. Charlesworth, 513)
In this passage, you can see early reference to ideas, such as the Book of Life
and places of judgment, that are taken up in other Jewish and Christian writ-
ings. Of particular importance is the following prayer addressed to God by
Zephaniah, who begs God for help by reminding God how God saved others
in the past:
You are the one who saved Israel from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of
Egypt. You saved Susanna from the hand of the elders of injustice. You save
the three holy men, Shadrach, Meschach, Abednego, from the furnace of
burning fire. I beg you to save me from this distress . . .
—Apocalypse of Zephaniah 6:10 (ed. Charlesworth, 513)
The reason that these references to the book of Daniel are important is
because Susanna was only added to Daniel in the Greek versions, after 200
BCE, so the reference helps scholars date this writing! By Chapter 9,
Zephaniah gets good news: “Be courageous! . . . Your name is written in the
Book of the Living!” So, in the end, the book encourages the reader to work so
that his life is listed in the right book!
The Ezra Books
Ezra the Scribe was one of the most famous characters late in Hebrew Bible
history (around 450 BCE). Because the Bible famously celebrates Ezra as
“bringing the scrolls of the law” on his visit to Palestine and teaching people
from these scrolls in what looks like a formal gathering (Nehemiah 8:1–2),
he’s often spoken of in early Jewish tradition as the one responsible for gath-
ering the old writings into what would become the Bible.
Virtually all the Ezra writings discussed in this section are considered rather
late (perhaps even up to the ninth century CE!) in comparison to the other
writings that we examine in this book. But they’re often included in discus-
sions about lost books because there’s great suspicion that they may be
based on older material. Although they may be based on older Jewish 
135
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

writings or tradition, these writings also show signs of Christian influence,
probably because they were kept among Christian churches longer than they
were in the Jewish communities.
Given that many early Christians were also Jewish, it seems hardly surprising
that ancient Christian writing would also honor Ezra and his legacy and that
such a central character would feature in later books as well. Quite a few
later apocalyptic visionary works also were attributed to Ezra; the following
sections guide you through them.
The Greek Apocalypse of Ezra
In the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra, Ezra is taken up into heaven and shown 
the various punishments reserved for evil persons. The following elements
from the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra are typical of all the Ezra writings (non-
canonical writings that prominently feature Ezra):
 Detailed descriptions of the various places of heaven and hell (usually
featuring numbers 7 and 12, as in seven gates, seven steps up, twelve
mountains, twelve beings or seven beings, and so on)
 Details of gruesome punishments
 Detailed descriptions of the glorious throne of God, surrounded by
strange animals and angelic beings
Many of these descriptions are clearly influenced by and further develop-
ments of the famous description of the Throne of God in the biblical book of
Isaiah, chapter 6.
A very important feature of these Ezra writings, however, are the questions
being asked by Ezra himself. Not only does Ezra ask about what he is seeing
(such as, “Why are these people suffering?”), but he also asks rather heavy
questions of the angels, like “Why don’t you help them?” to which the invari-
able reply is some form of “They had their chance!” In a sense, these books
frequently anticipate the obvious questions from readers — questions still
asked by modern readers!
Among the intentionally frightful scenes in the Greek Apocalypse is when
Ezra is shown the Antichrist — a decidedly Christian concept. The idea that a
future religious leader will claim to be the returned Jesus is a notion fre-
quently taken up in Christian discussions (see Epistle of 1 John in the New
Testament) and one that seemed to intrigue people. The idea of warning
people against this seems to be motivated by warning people about false reli-
gious teachers in general, no matter who they claim to be!
136
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

The Vision of Ezra
In the Vision of Ezra, Ezra is carried into “the infernal regions” (the gates of
hell) and shown a variety of different kinds of sins. Among the expected sins
(lust and adultery) are a few somewhat surprising sins, such as the people
shown to Ezra who “did not receive strangers and they did not give alms,
they took unjustly the things of others for themselves” (Vision of Ezra 30–33).
But as in the Greek Apocalypse, the Vision touches on a clear worry about
false teachings, and some of the sins shown to Ezra include people who 
were “. . . Doctors of the Law who confused baptism and the law of the 
Lord, because they were teaching with words, but they did not spur on to
works . . .” (Vision of Ezra 46–47).
Many Roman era works like the Vision mention exposure of infants as a
dreadful sin. Apparently, one way to deal with unwanted children was simply
to abandon them in the wilderness to die after birth; this practice also is 
frequently condemned in early Christian literature.
The Questions of Ezra
The Questions of Ezra is precisely that: Ezra asks questions of God with
regard to the future and especially to the rewards and punishments of the
future era.
All the Ezra-focused materials refer to the soul’s fate after death (suggesting
Greek philosophical influence), and the Questions of Ezra is no exception.
But in this writing, readers also encounter a rather charming little proverb 
on prayer:
For your prayers are thus: just as a farmer goes forth, comes to sow, and the
Shoot comes forth joyous and graceful and desires to produce numerous
fruit, and thorn and weeds also come forth and choke it and do not let
numerous fruit be assembled. Similarly, also you, when you go inside the
church and desire to offer prayers before the Divinity, the cares of this world
and the deceit of greatness (wealth) come forth and choke you and do not
let numerous fruit be sown . . . 
—Questions of Ezra 7–38 (ed. Charlesworth, 599)
The Revelation of Ezra
The Revelation of Ezra is a short fragment that seems almost like a horo-
scope. It consists of a prediction of the kinds of good and bad things that will
happen during a year if that year begins with a particular day of the week.
137
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

Here is a sample, based on Monday:
The day of the Moon (Monday) makes both winter and summer moderate.
There will be great floods and sickness, infantry warfare, changes of rulers,
and many wives will sit in lamentation, there will be much ice, kings will
die, there will be a good vintage, bees will die . . .
—Revelation of Ezra 4
The Apocalypse of Sedrach
The first- to fifth-century CE text the Apocalypse of Sedrach is a good example
of a book from a very late source (15th century CE Greek manuscript) that’s
generally held to be based on older materials (from perhaps as early as the
first centuries of Christianity).
138
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 
What’s with all this judgment stuff?
Modern readers of religious writings — espe-
cially apocalyptic writings — often express
shock and even revulsion at the subject of judg-
ment. Typically, modern readers think that judg-
ment was a crude way to scare people into
being good and that some modern people talk
too much about judgment and not nearly
enough about love. Sometimes talk about pun-
ishment and judgment comes off as so, well . . .
judgmental! That’s what we think, but what did
they think — the writers and readers of apoca-
lyptic literature? Were these people just angry
or something?
Consider this: Judgment is usually only bad if
you feel that you are the one being judged —
especially if you consider the judgment to be
unfair! There are other situations in which you
actually expect people to be judgmental. For
example, you expect judges in court to say to
guilty people, “Shame on you!” People applaud
that kind of judgment when they feel that justice
is served.
So, the next time you read ancient writings that
talk about judgment, ask yourself, “Who wrote
this? Why are they talking about judgment so
much?” For an ancient people like the Jews,
who were often harassed, often conquered,
sometimes horribly treated, life didn’t feel very
fair at all. The early Christians, too, often faced
persecution and suffering, especially in the first
300 years of Christianity. It’s clear that they
sometimes wondered, “Where is our God?” And
that is where judgment comes in.
For these ancient people feeling oppressed and
abused, judgment was something that sounded
good! It gave them the sense that the abuse
was going to stop soon and that right would be
right and wrong would be wrong. The next time
you think about how judgmental these ancient
writings are, ask yourself why you watch Law
and Order, Boston Legal, or Judge Judy. . . .
Truth be told, we have our own judgment litera-
ture, too!

The nice thing about the Apocalypse of Sedrach, and the reason that it’s
notable, is that, compared to other apocalyptic literature, it has a much more
hopeful tone and a stronger emphasis on love. The work starts off with a
sermon, beginning with this positive note: “Beloved, we must prefer nothing
more than unfeigned love . . .”, and continues along these lines. Along the
way, the writer quotes from 1 John:
Do not be advised to do anything without love. If you say, “I hate my brother
but I love Christ” you are a liar, and John the Theologian rebukes you, for
how can one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, love God
whom he has not seen . . . Oh how extraordinary and paradoxical is the
miracle that he who has love fulfills all the law!
—Apocalypse of Sedrach 9–10 (tr. Charlesworth, 609)
Like the Ezra materials covered earlier, the Apocalypse of Sedrach features
conversations between Sedrach the seer and God. In one line of questioning,
Sedrach asks if a person who lives a sinful life for over a hundred years but
repents at the very end will be forgiven. God says that the person will be for-
given if he repents in his last three years.
Like Abraham bargaining with God in the book of Genesis, Sedrach doesn’t let
the question drop, asking, “What about if a person repents within one year of
their death, God? What about only 40 days, God?” Each time, God offers to
forgive. In fact, the entire conversation is an emphasis on the forgiving love of
God, and in some ways, the Apocalypse of Sedrach is a nice antidote to the
rather harsh tone of other works! However, it does get in some licks: Those
who refuse to repent of their sins aren’t spared!
Further Books of Baruch
Baruch was the scribe who wrote the book of Jeremiah in the Bible (Jeremiah
36:4) and may have been responsible for major sections of 1–2 Samuel and
1–2 Kings as well. His famous association with Jeremiah led to Baruch becom-
ing a rather important biblical character in later tradition — especially
because Baruch apparently was a scribe who knew how to write, and that
skill was very rare in the ancient world!
Few biblical characters could make that claim, so Baruch is an obvious candi-
date for later writers to pick up on and develop further! Similar to the Ezra
traditions of a later era, more Baruch writings were composed also portray-
ing the great scribe as taking journeys to heaven and writing what he saw.
The context of these visions, however, is the times of the actual historic
Baruch. Following are those “further” books of Baruch:
139
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

 2 Baruch (early second century CE)
 3 Baruch (first to third centuries CE)
 4 Baruch (first to second centuries CE)
The historic Baruch, with Jeremiah, lived in the tumultuous times surround-
ing 587 BCE when Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian Emperor conquered
Jerusalem and carried away many prisoners of war. These events, known as
the Babylonian Exile, are symbolically used in 2 and 3 Baruch to speak of a
later time. 4 Baruch goes in a somewhat different direction, as we explain in a
later section.
2 Baruch
It seems a short step to go from inviting readers from later times to compare
their situations with that of Baruch in an earlier time to suggesting that
Baruch could actually anticipate and speak about those later developments! 2
Baruch is set in the context of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in
587. The Temple was destroyed this first time by Nebuchadnezzar and a
second and final time in 70 CE by the Romans. The two events seem to scream
out for comparison, and that’s precisely the idea behind 2 and 3 Baruch.
The central questions on the lips of Baruch in 2 Baruch are likely the same
questions asked by Jewish faithful when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in
70 CE:
 How could God have allowed this?
 Has God abandoned us?
A major section of 2 Baruch consists of a conversation between Baruch and
God on precisely these questions. For example, 2 Baruch portrays God’s
angels actually assisting in the destruction of the city walls of Jerusalem back
in 587 BCE, so that the people know that God’s doing this, not the forces of
Babylon. In other words, the first fall of Jerusalem was the result of judgment,
not merely military defeat. When Baruch protests, God clarifies that evil will
be punished and God will not spare his own from punishment if they have
sinned. However, those who are righteous will also have their rewards. And
after all, says God, if a person has a bad youth but a happy older life, he for-
gets the youth! The implication seems to be that punishments are temporary
and better times ahead will prove more memorable.
There follows a series of mystical numbers and symbolic language that com-
municates basically one thought: Things will appear to get bad, and just
when people begin to loose all hope, “the time will awake.” People in bad cir-
cumstances were comforted by the idea that they weren’t abandoned no
matter how bad things looked.
140
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

A promise in 2 Baruch includes the future fruitfulness of the land — the
peace enjoyed by people who know only violence now — and the fact that all
will be fed. Much of the symbolism and themes of judgment followed by par-
adise parallels the language of the New Testament book of Revelation, espe-
cially when 2 Baruch speaks of the coming of the “Anointed One” who will
officiate over the resurrection of the dead.
The final chapters are these words of encouragement from Baruch to Jewish
believers everywhere: Stand firm! Study the signs of the times! Be encouraged
about the future!
3 Baruch
3 Baruch has a similar theme to 2 Baruch: It uses the historical tragedy of 587
BCE to muse about later tragedies such as the Temple destruction in 70 CE,
or perhaps later events like the suppression of the ill-fated Bar Kochba Revolt
in Palestine (132–135 CE).
Particularly intriguing about 3 Baruch, however, is a series of visits into dif-
ferent layers of heaven (which is why 3 Baruch is reminiscent of similar trav-
els in heaven and hell in the famous Book of 1 Enoch, which you can read
about in Chapter 6).
Visiting First Heaven
As Baruch is weeping over the fate of Jerusalem, an angel of God whisks him
off to the heavens, where they enter a gate at the First Heaven. Here, Baruch
is curious about the size of the plains of heaven and also asks about the
strange beings he sees there. The angel tells him that these beings (who
seem to be mixtures of people and animals) were the ones who tried to build
the Tower of Babel (in Genesis 11) and were punished.
Visiting Second Heaven
Baruch then proceeds to the Second Heaven where he encounters more
strange people, specifically the ones who tried to build the bricks for the
Tower of Babel. As Baruch continues with the angel, he’s shown the vine that
grew the fruit that tempted Adam and Eve but was destroyed by the Great
Flood (3 Baruch Chapter 4). It’s said that Noah replanted the vine because
God had positive plans for the continued life of the plant. A Christian editor
then inserts a sentence about Jesus being the result of that vine (John 15:1),
but the original work carries on without strong Christian references.
More layers of heaven
3 Baruch continues with many unusual references as Baruch ascends into
various layers of heaven. In one layer, he’s shown a version of the phoenix
bird that protects the earth from too much of the sun’s light (kind of like an
141
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

ancient ozone layer!). This section also has a mythical interpretation of the
moon as an angelic being that helped to tempt Adam and Eve and was there-
fore reduced in light, compared to the sun, as punishment.
Visiting Fifth Heaven
At the Fifth Heaven, Baruch and the angel meet Michael, the “commander in
chief” of the angels. Michael is, of course, famously an important angelic per-
sonality already in Scripture (Daniel 10:13 and 12:1, and Revelation 12:7) and
assumes even greater significance in 3 Baruch. Here, Michael is portrayed as
carrying a large bowl of the good works of people upwards to God, and then
he explains the inevitability of judgment on evil to Baruch.
4 Baruch
Finally, we come to 4 Baruch. This one isn’t really an apocalyptic book but
rather an expansion of biblical tradition. However, it does have apocalyptic
elements, such as the prominent role of angels. 4 Baruch elaborates on the
tragic events of 587 BCE when Jerusalem was conquered and destroyed by
Babylon. However, contrary to biblical history, in 4 Baruch the prophet
Jeremiah is taken among the captives!
An interesting part of the story has to do with Jeremiah’s trusted friend,
Abimelech the Ethiopian. In the story, when Jeremiah learns of Jerusalem’s
fate (before it happens), he pleads with God to spare his friend Abimelech.
God grants this in a course of events that may remind you of Rip Van 
Winkle — Jeremiah sends Abimelech out of Jerusalem to gather figs, and
when Abimelech sits down to rest by a tree, he sleeps for 66 years! When he
awakes, he discovers the awful truth about Jerusalem’s fate and the fact that
Jeremiah is gone. But Baruch sends a letter to Jeremiah saying that
Abimelech is alive.
In the final chapter of 4 Baruch, which obviously was edited by later
Christian writers, Jeremiah dies and then rises to life three days later to
announce the coming of Jesus centuries later! There follows a brief series of
apocalyptic-style predictions focused on events surrounding the future
coming of Jesus. Then you come to a strange ending in which Jeremiah dies
for good, but not before a stone image of him distracts his opponents long
enough for him to explain everything that he saw to Baruch. (It seems that
there may be missing parts of this work because Jeremiah claims that he has
explained many mysteries to Baruch, but all that scholars have is this brief
Christian section.)
When the mob discovers that they’re stoning a mere stone image of
Jeremiah, they find the real guy and kill him. This element certainly reflects
the opposition that Jeremiah faced among his own people during his lifetime,
according to the biblical book of Jeremiah.
142
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

The Apocalypse of Abraham
The Apocalypse of Abraham begins with the biblical tradition that Abraham
grew up in Mesopotamia with his father Terah. Terah was a maker of idols,
and Abraham is said to have taken some on the road to sell. Some were
destroyed by accident, leading Abraham to contemplate their reality and
wonder if they really are gods. After all, his father had to make them, and
they couldn’t even save themselves from falling off Abraham’s donkey! Later,
a god even burns in the fire as Abraham prepares food for his father.
Somewhat humorously, Terah doesn’t see the obvious and instead decides
that the god “prepared my food” when the idol burned in the fire. Abraham
laughs at this thinking, and you see his emerging disbelief in the various
idols.
A real gem in this book, however, is Abraham’s speech to his father. Abraham
says that Terah’s “gods” aren’t even as venerable as gold gods, which are
made of something valuable like silver or gold. But none of them are gods;
fire is more powerful than all of them because it destroys even silver and
gold, but fire isn’t a god. Water is more powerful than fire, but it isn’t a god.
By extension, the sun is more powerful than all this, but it disappears at
night, so it’s hardly a god either.
You can see an interesting philosophical idea emerging in Abraham’s speech
as he arrives at the notion that there must be something even higher and
greater that is creator of all. God finally appears to Abraham and says, “You
are searching for the God of gods, the creator . . . I am he!” (Apocalypse of
Abraham 8:3–4).
After Abraham’s speech, the Apocalypse of Abraham borrows from the bibli-
cal accounts of Genesis and portrays the famous animal splitting sacrifice
(Genesis 15) as a rite instructed by an angel of God to prepare Abraham for a
series of revelations. While Abraham waits, he’s briefly tempted by Azazel,
the evil angel, but another good angel drives Azazel away and prepares
Abraham for his visions.
The visions begin with a spectacular description of the throne of God in
flames, surrounded by strange beings that combine aspects of different ani-
mals (this vision is very similar to that given in the book of the biblical
Prophet Ezekiel, chapters 1–3). In subsequent chapters, Abraham is called
upon by God to view different scenes on earth: masses of people divided into
good and bad; specific sins committed by people, including Abraham’s own
people; and then finally an explanation of the coming judgment.
Like many of the apocalyptic books that we consider in this chapter, the
Apocalypse of Abraham ends with a series of generalized predictions of dis-
asters coming upon the earth just before the final judgment occurs, exempli-
fying the modern saying, “It is always darkest just before the dawn.”
143
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

This first to second century CE work, probably originally written in Hebrew
in Palestine, has been passed through Slavonic languages into Russian, and
thus scholars are dependent on Russian versions to help reconstruct the
original as best as they can.
The Apocalypse of Adam
The Apocalypse of Adam is a first- to fourth-century CE Gnostic writing that
was found among the Nag Hammadi manuscripts discovered in Egypt in the
early 20th century. Seth, the son of Adam, became very important in Gnostic
belief because he was supposed to be the one to whom Adam revealed many
secrets, which Seth passed on to the people who called themselves Gnostics
(see Chapter 12 for more on Gnostic beliefs). “Gnosis” is the Greek word for
“knowledge.”
The Gnostic philosophy, which appears to have arisen in the second century
CE, influenced many other religious traditions, including Judaism and espe-
cially Christianity. There were many Christian Gnostic writings, but the
Apocalypse of Adam appears to be a Gnostic Jewish writing — that is, a work
that draws on the Jewish instead of the Christian tradition in order to argue
Gnostic beliefs.
In short, the Gnostics believed that the material world isn’t real in any pro-
found sense and that the only reality is spiritual. The God of the Hebrews, the
creator of this world, is an evil god who tries to cover up the truth about the
Higher God, the God of Light and Truth.
Thus, in Gnostic writings, the Hebrew biblical narrative is typically told as a
narrative of enslavement to an evil god who doesn’t want humans to know
the truth. But according to the Apocalypse of Adam, an Illuminator will come
with the truth.
This work has a long poetic sequence that describes this Illuminator as one
who was carefully chosen and cared for by the angels of the Higher God.
There are 13 sections in the sequence, and each section ends with the
phrase, “thus, he came to the water.” Given that water and “coming to the
water” are themes throughout the entire writing, it’s possible that this writing
had something to do with a kind of water ritual (perhaps a sort of baptism)
conducted as part of entry into a Gnostic sect.
According to the Apocalypse of Adam, the Illuminator eventually reveals the
truth to humanity, and the truth is the knowledge that’s passed on to Seth for
safekeeping.
144
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Note: Although most of the surviving Gnostic writings are Christian Gnostic
writings, the Apocalypse of Adam stands out as one that appears to have no
specifically Christian elements at all, suggesting the wide range of religious
themes and sources that Gnostic religious writers could use in the ancient
world.
The Apocalypse of Elijah
A first- to fourth-century CE work, the Apocalypse of Elijah is considered an
older Jewish work with later Christian editing in various locations. It begins
with a praise of fasting as a form of spiritual battle against temptation and
sin. The writer is reacting, apparently, to those who have questioned the
importance of fasting, but this writer is strongly set in favor of fasting as a
spiritual practice that prepares one for facing evil in the same way that a
craftsman must use tools and a warrior must use weapons.
There follows a section that appears to be a visionary prediction of the rise
of evil rulers in the countries surrounding the writer (some suggest that the
writer must be in Egypt). These predictions are typically vague, as in “A king
will rise in the West,” but there’s a strong warning that this ruler will be
seductive in using the language of peace and joy. The writing even tells how
to recognize him: He will have two sons, and from the one with a demonic
face, evil kings will arise, and people will cry out because of the oppression
he will bring. Even 12-year-old children will be drafted into this evil king’s
armies.
A later Christian editor read these references to be the Antichrist, and so
develops this theme further. The writer warns that the Antichrist will accom-
plish many impressive things and then helps readers out by giving a strange
physical description to aid in recognizing him: “skinny-legged young lad . . .
tuft of gray hair . . . his eyebrows will reach to his ears . . .” (Apocalypse of
Elijah 3:15).
The sequence of events in the Apocalypse of Elijah becomes even odder:
You’re introduced to a virgin named Tabitha who chases the Antichrist. The
Antichrist kills her and casts her body on the Temple, but it’s revealed that
her blood will produce healing. Then you read about the martyrdom of Elijah
and Enoch as they also take up the fight against the Antichrist. They rise
from the dead and keep up the battle.
This theme of conflict is maintained through the persecution of Christians.
Jesus appears, takes up the faithful (similar to the Rapture idea in Revelation
in the New Testament). Afterward, however, the writing foresees earth experi-
encing frightening evils:
145
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

And on that day the earth will be disturbed, and the sun will darken, and
peace will be removed from the earth. The birds will fall on the earth, dead.
The earth will be dry. The waters of the sea will dry up. The sinners will
groan upon the earth saying, “What have you done to us, O son of
lawlessness, saying I am the Christ, when you were the devil!?”
—Apocalypse of Elijah 5:7–11
In the end, Christ returns with the faithful and reigns for a thousand years.
The evil ones cry out, “We thought we had time, but we did not!” Like many
apocalyptic writings, the entire Apocalypse of Elijah revolves around the
theme and goal of the last judgment.
Clearly, this work shares similar themes with the famous book of Revelation
in the New Testament, but it’s likely that these themes come from general
apocalyptic lore and not directly from the New Testament work.
The Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah
The Martyrdom and Ascension of Isaiah is clearly a book composed of two
major sections that describe the martyrdom and ascension of the prophet
Isaiah, a historic figure who began preaching in ancient Israel around 740
BCE. From his influence came the enormously important writing known as
the book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible. The Martyrdom and Ascension is
believed to be dated to the second century BCE for parts of the book and up
to the fourth century CE for other portions.
Isaiah’s martyrdom
The first section of the book, considered the older portion, is a legend about
the martyrdom of Isaiah that’s similar in many respects to other second cen-
tury BCE martyr stories, especially those contained in 2 Maccabees and the
“near martyr” stories of Daniel 1–6. It’s often thought that the dramatic
increase in martyr stories as religious literature among the Jews probably
increased with the persecution of Jews under the Greek rulers over Palestine
between 200–150 BCE, which gave rise to the Maccabean revolts near 164
BCE. Typical of all these stories is a conversation between the evil ruler and
the faithful person in which the faithful person is offered clemency to
renounce his faith. This element appears in this work.
The legend speaks of the evil king Manasseh murdering Isaiah at the instiga-
tion of Satan (under the name “Beliar,” used frequently in other apocalyptic
literature). According to this legend, Isaiah is literally sawed in half after
refusing to abandon his faith in God.
146
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Isaiah’s ascension
The second portion of the book, often called the Ascension of Isaiah, seems to
be a Christian work (although the Christian elements may have been edited
into an older Jewish work). Isaiah is visited by angels who raise him upward
through seven heavens. Briefly stopping at each of the seven heavens, Isaiah
sees angels singing and praising God, and he’s told to go higher to see whom
they’re praising. Finally, Isaiah reaches the seventh and final heaven only to
meet Jesus before he’s born as a human child. There follows a summary of
the life of Jesus, all viewed in short order by Isaiah before the risen Jesus
rises once again to the seventh heaven.
The fact that the biblical Isaiah didn’t tell this story is addressed at the end
of the Ascension, where it says that Isaiah was sworn to secrecy until all
these predicted events took place.
Sorting out the different sections of this work, however, isn’t easy. It’s widely
held that the actual visits of Isaiah in heaven form an older part of the work
and the martyrdom section may be a Christian addition. However, if you
remove the really obvious Christian references, it’s possible to argue that the
entire work is pre-Christian and thus entirely Jewish in character.
The Ladder of Jacob
Jacob’s famous dream described in Genesis 28 is obvious inspiration for an
apocalyptic text — it seems ready-made for such an interpretation! In the
Ladder of Jacob, Jacob’s dream is elaborated. In the biblical passage, Jacob
sees a ladder with angels going down and up from heaven to earth (already
pretty striking imagery); but in this writing, God tells an angel named Sariel
to explain to Jacob the symbolic meaning of the dream. Here’s part of Sariel’s
explanation:
You have seen a ladder with twelve steps, each step having two human
faces which kept changing their appearance. The ladder is this age, and the
twelve steps are the periods of this age. But the twenty-four faces are the
kinds of the ungodly nations of this age . . .
—Ladder of Jacob 5:1–2
There follows the typical series of vaguely general predictions that give histo-
rians headaches and raise more questions, such as, “Is this symbol a reference
to a real ruler? If so, which one?” and so on. Among the specific predictions is
the following reference most likely to the enslavement in Egypt before Moses
and less likely to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 587 BCE:
147
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

Know, Jacob, that your descendants shall be exiles in a strange land, and
they will afflict them with slavery and inflict wounds on them every day . . .
—Ladder of Jacob 5:16
It’s precisely the vagueness of this kind of prediction that allows people to
read the Ladder of Jacob and say, “Wow! That’s just like us today!” This has
been the case particularly when the work has been read by Jews who face
persecution and mass movements after
 The Assyrian conquests of 722 BCE
 The Babylonian conquests of 587 BCE
 The Greek conquests of 333 BCE and 200 BCE
 The Roman conquests of 64 BCE
 The Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE
 The Roman suppression of the Bar Kochba Revolt in 132–135 CE
Hopefully you get the idea that, when experiencing these kinds of bad times,
people get some kind of comfort from believing that it’s all part of some 
plan . . . and especially when that plan includes changes coming!
This short little first century CE writing is only available to modern readers
from Slavonic and Russian sources (for example, from Eastern Christian 
traditions in the vicinity of modern Bulgaria), but it was most likely originally
composed in Greek.
The History of the Rechabites
Consider one last odd first- to fourth-century CE work with somewhat
unusual apocalyptic elements. The History of the Rechabites sets itself in the
time of the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem, similar to many of the texts
reviewed in this chapter. This context is probably because of the parallels
that readers sensed between that time and their own time of persecution —
especially around the time of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.
In the History, Zosimus is fasting in the wilderness in hopes that God will show
him where the “Blessed Ones” dwell. There’s no explanation of who these
Blessed Ones are until later in the writing. An angel, who appears to transform
into a strange animal, brings Zosimus to a beautiful island. Typically, Jewish
apocalyptic writings emphasize that the visionary visits heavenly locations 
(or occasionally, the “other place”). But in this writing, Zosimus appears to go
on a literal journey to another location on earth! The island is occupied by
strange and unusual people, and one of these Blessed Ones actually appears to
148
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Zosimus to be like an angel. Like the proverbial “take me to your leader”
encounter, Zosimus is taken to the Blessed Ones’ gathering, where he must
answer a series of questions, particularly questions dealing with the final
events of history (ah . . . we knew we’d get to that subject, right?).
Zosimus is so bothered by the Blessed Ones’ constant questions that he tells
a messenger to lie to them and say that he’s not available. When the lie is dis-
covered, Zosimus is nearly kicked out of paradise! He apologizes, and the
Blessed Ones explain to him who they are, which is what today might be
called an “order” in the Catholic sense of people who make a vow to form a
special and unique religious community. They live a nomadic existence in
tents apart from regular society, and they don’t drink wine. (In fact, there’s a
historical basis for this explanation in Jeremiah 35, where Jeremiah affirms
the Blessed Ones’ faith and tells them that they will survive even when
Jerusalem is conquered.)
The History then elaborates that the entire order was magically transported to
this island where they live an idyllic existence without war, money, sin, or
impurities. Even the weather is perfect, so they live off the produce of the land.
They sleep with their wives only once in their lives and produce two children,
one for marriage and one for virginity. From the perspective of the writer, obvi-
ously, these are characteristics of some kind of perfect society, and the History
is intriguing from that perspective if for nothing else. A Christian editor has
inserted some comments about the significance of Jesus, but it seems an obvi-
ous intrusion in what is generally thought to have been a Jewish writing.
The History is like a geographical apocalypse rather than a future apocalypse
and is clearly among the more unusual of the writings we survey in this chapter.
Other “Travels with God” Literature: 
2 Enoch, 3 Enoch, and 3 Baruch
Although 1 Enoch (which is discussed in detail in Chapter 6) is the most
famous, there were two other ancient books that use the Enoch character,
both of which were written much later than 1 Enoch. They’re known as 2
Enoch and 3 Enoch.
These two related books cover very similar territory:
 Descriptions of travels upwards through the levels of heaven
 Descriptions of what is learned from the travels
One of the interesting things about all Enoch literature is that it all describes
travels from Earth to other, spiritual places where information is gathered
and then passed back to humans.
149
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)

Like the Greek Prometheus who stole fire from heaven and brought it to
earth, so these writings take information about and from heaven and bring it
back to earth. But 2 and 3 Enoch books aren’t the only books about travels in
heaven; another example worth mentioning is 3 Baruch.
2 Enoch
In 2 Enoch, Enoch gives a short speech to his sons that contains ethical
instructions for things like taking care of the poor and avoiding injustice, and
then Enoch is taken up into heaven.
Levels of heaven
2 Enoch describes each level of heaven with the authority of someone who’s
been there. Here’s a rundown of the ten levels:
 Level 1 is where the “storehouses” of weather are kept, including rain,
snow, ice, and fire (which perhaps refers to lightning).
 Level 2 is the place of punishment for the wicked.
 Level 3 is the pleasant place for the righteous and for those who have
done justice in their lives.
 Level 4 contains the physical bodies of the universe. It’s where Enoch is
able to measure the flights and path of stars and the sun as well as the
movements of the angels that accompany these heavenly bodies. The
description of this level contains complex calculations of the length of
days and the movement of stars.
An interest in astronomical numerical detail is also a part of 1 Enoch.
 Level 5 is where Enoch meets the famous fallen angels, led by Satan.
 Level 6 is where Enoch sees the archangels in charge of all the heavenly
beings.
 Level 7 (Seventh Heaven!) is the place where Enoch sees heavenly armies
and catches a glimpse of God on God’s Throne in Heaven. Enoch is so
overcome by his visions that the angels encourage him to “be strong.”
 Levels 8 and 9, which Enoch passes through rather quickly, are where
Enoch sees zodiac signs.
 Level 10 is where Enoch finally sees of the face of God.
Note: If this sounds a bit like 2 Corinthians 12:2, then you’re paying attention!
The notion of levels of heaven may have been an influence on Paul from none
other than Enoch, although other ancient Jewish writing also uses this theme.
150
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

A sitdown with God on Level 10
Upon reaching Level 10, God explains the creation of the world to Enoch in
much more detail than provided in the creation stories of Genesis. It’s made
clear to Enoch that he’s intended to learn from this explanation and carry it
back to earth.
This description has some genuinely charming details, such as the sugges-
tion that God made man from seven components:
 His flesh from earth
 His blood from dew and the sun
 His eyes from the bottomless sea
 His bones from stone
 His reason from the mobility and speed of angels and clouds
 His veins and hair from the grass of the earth
 His spirit “from my spirit” and from wind
Enoch is an eager student and takes good notes, which he needs because he’s
granted 30 days back on earth to explain to his sons and anyone else who will
listen what he has learned before he returns to heaven forever.
151
Chapter 8: Apocalyptic Literature (a.k.a. Really Strange Books)
Dating dilemmas for 2 and 3 Enoch
The dating of 2 Enoch is controversial, with
some historians suggesting the first century
BCE but other estimates as late as 900 CE.
The fact that some details (such as specific
terms and even wordplay that only make sense
in Greek but not in the later Slavonic transla-
tions) suggest a Greek origin for this book, how-
ever, has suggested to many historians that
original parts of this work must go back to early
centuries of Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity.
3 Enoch, on the other hand, is normally dated
after 70 CE, after the destruction of the Temple
in Jerusalem by the Romans in that year. 
3 Enoch has references to Rabbi Ishmael, an
early Jewish leader who was born in the first
century, just before 70 CE, so the writing can’t
be any older than that. The book as it exists
today, however, contains material that was
clearly added for a long time after that 70 CE.

3 Enoch
3 Enoch contains even stranger descriptions of the levels of heaven but is
generally similar in content to 2 Enoch. One difference is that in 3 Enoch,
readers are introduced to Rabbi Ishmael, who encounters the angel named
Metatron. Metatron clarifies to Rabbi Ishmael that he is, in fact, Enoch.
3 Enoch draws from descriptions of the levels of heaven in 2 Enoch (refer to
the earlier section, “Levels of heaven,” for the list) but is especially fasci-
nated with the gathering and listing of names, including providing 70 names
of God, more than 70 names for Metatron/Enoch, and a slew of names of vari-
ous archangels. All this suggests an interest in the details of the heavens, and
some historians believe that these names may have been believed to have
magical properties.
3 Baruch
We should start by pointing out that there is both a Book of Baruch 
(1 Baruch) and a 2 Baruch, both of which are well known and accepted by
Catholics as part of the Apocrypha (see Chapter 4). All this Baruch literature,
like the Enoch literature, is based on a famous biblical persona, Baruch, a
real historical figure responsible for writing down the sayings of the Prophet
Jeremiah. But fascination with Baruch led to a series of works attributed to
him, including two apocalyptic writings.
1 Baruch and 2 Baruch are quite different from Enoch-like writings about jour-
neys in heaven, but 3 Baruch is very similar to Enoch. It includes descrip-
tions of journeys into at least five levels of heaven. In 3 Baruch, Baruch is
shown good places for good people and places of punishment for bad people
as well as the workings of heaven and the various heavenly beings.
The interesting part of 3 Baruch is the fact that God allows Baruch to plead
for the fate of evil persons, that they may be spared punishment. This is a
somewhat unique feature of ancient literature that’s almost always rather
graphic in its description of the punishment of evil people.

Chapter 9
Popular Legends and Expansions
of Older Hebrew Traditions
In This Chapter
 Revisiting Solomon and David
 Taking a new look at the Adam and Eve story
 Reviewing and analyzing Testament literature
T
his chapter covers some of the interesting writings from the Greek and
Roman periods of Jewish history that are loosely based on older Jewish
writings — most of which ended up in the Bible. Typically, historians and
Bible scholars are interested in these kinds of writings because they represent
an interesting form of “interpretation” of the older biblical stories in which the
authors literally add details and sometimes retell the older material in a new
fashion.
The most intriguing question to ask when studying these materials is whether
any of these writings supply “missing elements” from the older biblical materi-
als. In other words, were some of the episodes, short pieces, or elements of
these stories based on older oral traditions? Or are they simply later “elabora-
tions” of the older tradition?
It’s clear that all the writings discussed in this chapter are later elaborations
on biblical traditions — a kind of Jewish (and often also Christian) entertaining
folklore with some ethical instructions. Furthermore, some of these writings
contributed to magical beliefs that eventually raised suspicions among Church
and Rabbinic leadership, who often looked askance at such practices that were
often popular rituals among (frightened!) common people — if not the scholars
as well!

The Odes of Solomon
We consider this late-first to early-second century CE collection of poetry to be
the star of the show in this chapter. We confess that much of this judgment is
based on the sheer beauty of the language. Whoever wrote these lines poetically
describes what seems to be a profound experience of faith. It’s likely that the
work is ascribed to “Solomon” only because other Old Testament poetry is
assigned to him even if it was written centuries later (like Proverbs and espe-
cially Ecclesiastes).
The Odes of Solomon contain some genuinely moving lines, and the general
consensus, although occasionally disputed, is that these are Christian works
so deeply influenced by Jewish ideas that they represent spiritual poetry of
early Jewish Christians.
Jewish-Christianity was a part of early Christianity that eventually died out as
Christianity became an increasingly non-Jewish religious movement. Of course,
the New Testament was largely written by Jewish-Christians. When scholars
speak of Jewish-Christianity, they usually mean those Jewish-Christians who
were not entirely in agreement with St. Paul’s open attitude toward non-Jews
and who didn’t accept Jewish practices when they became Christians. St.
Paul’s “missionary” movements, however, led to increasing numbers of non-
Jews being accepted into the Christian movement without first becoming Jews,
and later, even without much familiarity with Jewish tradition.
In the poems that comprise the Odes of Solomon, you hear something of the
spirituality of these early Jewish-Christians. The poems also have the occa-
sional odd turn of phrase and even some images that are a bit unorthodox.
For example, the notion that Jesus didn’t really die raises some theological
problems; however, it may just be a poetic way of speaking of the Resurrection,
or it may be a quite unorthodox statement that Jesus wasn’t actually fully
human and therefore only appeared to die — an idea that Christians argued
about rather vehemently in the early centuries.
Despite these occasional doctrinal “hiccups” (which were sufficient enough
to keep the collection out of the New Testament, we dare say), much of the
poetic imagery of the Odes is undeniably quite expressive. For example:
As the wind moves through the harp and the strings speak,
So the Spirit of the Lord speaks through my members,
And I speak through his love
—Ode 6
My joy is the Lord and my course is toward him,
This way of mine is beautiful.
For there is a Helper for me, the Lord
He has generously shown himself to me in his simplicity
154
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Because his kindness has diminished his grandeur
He became like me, that I might receive Him . . .”
—Ode 7
You also can see a level of social comment about Jesus and the poor in the
midst of these rapturous lines of worship:
Stand and be established,
You who once were brought low.
You who were in silence, speak,
For your mouth has been opened.
You who were despised, from henceforth be raised
For your Righteousness has been raised
For the right hand of the Lord is with you
And he will be your helper . . .
—Ode 7
Joseph and Asenath
Joseph and Asenath is a charming story written sometime between the first
century BCE and the second century CE. It’s a romantic tale that may remind
you of Kiss Me, Kate and My Fair Lady set in the biblical world. It’s a tale with
all the trimmings: drama, charm, and even animal characters!
Here’s a breakdown of the story: Asenath, the daughter of an official of Pharaoh,
hates all men, but somewhat inconveniently for her, she’s also very beautiful
and thus is a magnet for the males with whom she comes into contact. She
hates all of them, that is, until she sets eyes on the handsome Joseph, portrayed
as a young official in the Egyptian administration (based very loosely on the
book of Genesis stories of Joseph).
But Joseph won’t even consider a relationship with a non-Jew! Asenath is terribly
sad, but Joseph says a prayer for her, and while he’s away, Asenath goes through
a significant conversion experience, abandoning the many gods of the ancient
Egyptians for the Jewish God. In a notable prayer, she acknowledges that she has
been wrong worshipping false gods but is hopeful for grace:
But I have heard many saying
That the God of the Hebrews is a true God
And a living God, a merciful God
And compassionate and long-suffering and full of pity and gentle
And does not count the sin of a humble person . . .
—Joseph and Asenath 11:10
155
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

The mighty angel Michael comes to announce that Asenath’s prayers have
been heard, and she is transformed. In a slightly strange scene, a hive of bees
surrounds her in the moment of spiritual transformation. Joseph returns some-
time later to find that she’s transformed, and they are married in the household
of the Pharaoh.
The work, charming as it is, has some interesting aspects that scholars focus on:
 Joseph maintains his clear Jewish identity despite working in foreign
service. This is reminiscent of the older tales of Daniel, Tobit, Esther,
and others. But this story contains little hint of the danger of being with
foreigners that you see in the older tales.
 The “conversion” of Asenath may say a lot about mixing with foreigners.
There’s a considerable debate among historians as to whether the con-
version means that this tale actually attempts to argue for the acceptance
of foreigners as legitimate wives (under certain spiritual conditions). If so,
then it’s literature that very much goes against the grain of a general
antipathy about mixing with foreigners that is evidenced in most of the
literature from the Greco-Roman period of Jewish society (circa 333
BCE–300 CE).
Moreover, scholars debate whether the initial prayer of Joseph over Asenath,
praying for her to be among the chosen ones, was from an actual prayer
tradition over non-Jews. There’s no proof of this practice, but it seems like
something that could apply in situations other than just this story.
Life of Adam and Eve
This first-century CE “expansion” of the biblical story of Adam and Eve from
Genesis has survived in two rather different versions. One has more apoca-
lyptic-like elements than the other, but they both follow the same general lines.
In this section, we summarize the general story line of both surviving versions.
As the story opens, Adam and Eve are hungry, having been expelled from the
famous Garden where they never had to worry about food. In their desperation,
Adam tells Eve that they must beg God to either let them back in or at least let
them have some food. They decide to go about begging God in a very strange
manner: Adam will go to the River Jordan and Eve will go to the River Tigris (in
modern Iraq), and they’ll stand up to their necks in the water and fast and pray.
Soon, fish and marine animals gather with them, and they actually stop up the
rivers’ flow!
Satan, however, tricks Eve into breaking her fast by pretending to be an angel
of God who has heard her prayers. When Satan is confronted by Adam for
tricking Eve “once again” (the tradition that the snake in the Garden was
actually Satan is a late tradition that does not appear in the original biblical
156
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

story of Genesis but appears in the late Jewish work, the Wisdom of Solomon),
Satan explains why he’s so angry with them: Satan’s original refusal to honor
God’s creation of humans led to his expulsion from heaven. Note: A somewhat
different version of Satan’s expulsion is provided in the older and more famous
1 Enoch (see Chapter 6).
After Adam and Eve recover from this initial deception, the rest of the narrative
describes how they come to accept the reality of pain and death. In a poignant
scene, the sons of Adam gather around their dying father demanding to know
what pain and death are — after all, nobody has died yet! Before he dies, Adam
is taken into heaven and given a number of revelations, which he’s allowed to
tell to his son Seth (who was born to replace the murdered Abel).
Because this writing doesn’t contain an extended discussion of what Adam
was told in heaven, the book isn’t really a full apocalyptic-like writing — and
readers are left wondering if something is missing. What is certainly the case,
however, is that later Jewish and Christian mystical movements centered
their traditions on Seth, who became famous for insights and knowledge, and
this tale may be among the ancient stories that tried to explain the impor-
tance and significance of Seth. After all, this writing does suggest that Adam
left important writings in Seth’s care.
Additional Psalms from 
the Dead Sea Scrolls
Among the materials found in the Dead Sea Scrolls (see Chapter 5) were
scrolls that included some additional Psalms.
The Bible has 150 Psalms, but the Scrolls provided the famous “151–155” Psalms.
For the most part these Psalms, dated to between the third century BCE and the
first century CE, are explicitly based on stories of David and deal more directly
with David than most of the biblical Psalms do. This fact suggests that they were
written much later than the more familiar Psalms in the Bible, carefully drawing
on the established traditions about David. Many of the biblical Psalms aren’t
nearly as specific as those found with the Scrolls, such as Psalm 152, which
alludes to enemies as lions:
It is not sufficient for them to ambush my father’s flocks;
and to tear a sheep from his sheepfold?
They are even wishing to slay me.
Spare, O Lord, your elect one;
and deliver your holy one from destruction . . .
—Psalm 152:3–4
157
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

Psalm 154, however, has an interesting association with Wisdom Mystical
teachings, such as the continued tradition of personifying wisdom as a
woman (discussed in Chapter 3):
For to announce the glory of the Lord
Wisdom has been given
And to recount his many deeds,
She was made known to humanity
. . . From the utterances of the righteous ones is heard her voice;
And from the congregation of the pious ones her song.
—Psalm 154:5–6, 154:12
It remains an open question why these Psalms weren’t included in the Bible,
although the best guess seems to be their late date. In other words, it’s possi-
ble that they were written too late to make it in.
Psalms of Solomon
Another body of Psalms not included in the Bible is traditionally assigned to
the famous son of David who became King after him, namely “Wise” King
Solomon. Historians point out that these Psalms from the first century BCE
seem to focus on the Jewish confrontation with the Romans in Palestine in
the first century BCE. Pompey took over Palestine in about 64 BCE. Here’s an
excerpt from one of the so-called Solomonic Psalms:
The lawless one laid waste our land, so that no one inhabited it;
They massacred young and old and children at the same time.
In his blameless wrath he expelled them to the west
And he did not spare even the officials of the country from ridicule
As the enemy was a stranger
And his heart alien to our God, he acted arrogantly
—Solomonic Psalm 17:11–13
There are 18 of these Solomonic Psalms, and thankfully historians have lots
of manuscripts that have preserved them. The manuscripts date from the
tenth to sixteenth centuries CE, but the Psalms are presumed to date much
earlier, of course, and were written originally in either Hebrew or Greek.
Many of these Psalms of Solomon include themes of judgment and expulsion of
foreigners or judgment of the foreigners. If you overlook this vindictive streak
(especially given the historical circumstances involved), you can enjoy some
genuinely beautiful lines that are very reminiscent of the more lyrical and evoca-
tive lines of the biblical Psalms. To be fair, the biblical Psalms also occasionally
give in to some judgmental attitudes.
158
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

Prayer of Manasseh
According to the biblical history books 1–2 Kings, Manasseh, the son of
Hezekiah, was one of the most evil and corrupt kings in all Jewish history.
Many evil Kings are compared to him in the Bible, and he seems to have set
the standard for despotic, pagan rule. Still, a tradition arose that Manasseh
eventually repented of his evil deeds — and the Prayer of Manasseh is the
prayer of that confession.
This prayer from the second century BCE to first century CE is found in many
older Greek manuscripts but isn’t considered a legitimate part of the older
biblical traditions. It’s widely noted that the Prayer borrows many lines from
Psalm 51 and thus is pretty clearly a derived tradition. However, one could
possibly argue that this prayer form is found in somewhat older biblical books;
such “prayers of confession” became more widely used in the centuries after
the destruction of Babylon in 587 BCE (see, for example, Daniel 9, Ezra 9, and
Nehemiah 9), and this prayer shows some resemblance to that tradition.
It seems clear that the prayer arose because of concern on the part of latter
readers that the Bible never “resolved” the issue of evil kings of ancient Israel.
Thus, prayers of confession like the Prayer of Manasseh attempt to “clean up”
some religious loose ends that are perceived in the biblical traditions.
I (coauthor Daniel) would suggest that such literary editing and additions
made to the older tradition are entirely harmless, even if they come rather
late in the game. The sentiment behind the prayers — that people come to
see the error of their ways — obviously is rather nice and reassuring!
Testament Literature: 
Famous Last Words
The works covered in the following sections are all classified as Testaments
because they all revolve around final speeches made to a man’s family before
he dies. The Bible seems to feature such monumental last words as a literary
style of focusing on enduring messages left by famous people.
Although the Testaments contain a mix of material — including apocalyptic
visits to heaven and hell — the major content is famous biblical characters’ final
statements made before they die. Think of them as a last will and testament.
The main precedent for this kind of writing, of course, is the book of Genesis;
in chapters 49–50, Jacob gathers his 12 sons and offers a kind of prophetic
word about each of them as he blesses them. You can also find a biblical
precedent for this kind of practice in 1 Kings 2, when David talks to Solomon
159
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

and begins by informing his son that he, David, is about to “go the way of all
the earth . . .” and then offers important advice.
The following Testaments are therefore expansions of biblical material that in
many cases carry the discussions and historical references down to the
Greco-Roman period, which helps historians identify the approximate dates
of the actual writing.
The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs
Unlike the book of Genesis, in the second-century BCE writing Testaments of
the Twelve Patriarchs, each of the 12 sons of Jacob does the talking. Many of
them begin with a confession of their particular sins and then provide advice
to “my children” — the presumed readers of the Testaments.
One of the reasons that this particular writing was popular — and continues
to be read with great appreciation — is the profound ethical advice that
many of the brothers give to their children. The writing has a striking peace-
fulness at a time when violent events were rocking the Jewish communities
(in the second century BCE through to the first century CE).
Starting with Reuben, the first of the twelve
The first of the confessors in Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is Reuben.
Reuben confesses to sexual sin, and in the process of repenting of this sin, he
comes to understand the “seven spirits of deceit.” These are spirits aligned
against humanity that are also given seven spirits of life. The idea seems to
be that each positive spirit has a negative counterpart. The positive spirits
are as follows:
 The spirit of Life: Humanity created as a composite being
 The spirit of Seeing: Which brings desire
 The spirit of Hearing: For instruction
 The spirit of Smell: From which comes taste and drawing breath
 The spirit of Speech: From which comes knowledge
 The spirit of Taste: From which comes consuming food and drink
 The spirit of Procreation and intercourse: From which could come sin
from an overly strong fondness for pleasure
160
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

After noting an eighth spirit of Sleep, which appears somewhat neutral,
Reuben lists these spirits of error:
 The spirit of Promiscuity
 The spirit of Insatiability
 The spirit of Strife
 The spirit of Flattery and trickery
 The spirit of Arrogance
 The spirit of Lying
 The spirit of Injustice
Hopefully you can clearly spot the beginnings of what will evolve into the
seven deadly sins paradigm in later medieval thought, although there’s also a
tradition of “sin lists” that, at the time of the Testaments, had already begun
in the New Wisdom Literature of the Bible. Consider this example:
There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to
him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a
heart that devises wicked plans, feet that hurry to run to evil, a lying witness
who testifies falsely, and one who sows discord in a family. My child, keep
your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.”
—Proverbs 6:16–20
More confessions from the remaining sons
Following Reuben, each son of Jacob discusses a particular sin or sins. Simeon,
for example, confesses to deceit and envy of his younger brother, Joseph.
However, not all the sons discuss sins and results. Levi, for example, reveals
aspects of the heavenly realms, including a description of what occurs in the
three “layers” of heaven. There follows an extended discussion of Levi’s
descendants, who become the Priests of the Temple service in ancient Israel.
Of particular interest in this section on Levi is a “Priestly Messiah,” a poetic
description of a future Priest-King that may refer favorably to the Maccabean
rulers (who also proclaimed themselves High Priests — much to the disgust
of some aspects of the Israelite population in the second and first centuries
BCE) or that may simply indicate yet another variety of “expectation” among
pre-Christian Jewish movements.
The confessions of Zebulon include a recounting of his attempts to live a
good life, offering food to the poor and care for the sick; he gives this advice
based on his observations of life:
161
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

To the extent that a man has compassion on his neighbor, so that extent the
Lord has mercy on him. For when we went down into Egypt, Joseph did not
hold a grudge against us. When he saw me, he was moved with compassion.
Whomever you see, do not harbor resentment, my children, love one
another, and do not calculate the wrong done by each to his brothers. This
shatters unity, and scatters all kinship, and stirs up the soul. He who recalls
evil receives neither compassion nor mercy.
—Zebulon 8:3–6
Much of the sons’ teaching seems to build toward a picture of Joseph, whose
compassion on his brothers in Egypt (as recorded in Genesis) is seen as a
model of patience and long-suffering nature. In fact, when you get to the
Testament of Joseph, there’s a section that suggests rather dramatically that
Joseph’s attempts to live a good life are parallel to the teachings of Jesus. Either
this is a Christian insertion into the work or a rather dramatic anticipation of
Jesus’s teachings in Matthew 25:31–46. Consider Joseph’s words:
I was taken into captivity: the strength of the Lord came to my aid
I was overtaken by hunger — the Lord himself fed me generously
I was alone — and God came to help me
I was in weakness — and the Lord showed his concern for me
I was in prison — and the Savior acted graciously on my behalf
I was in bonds — and he loosed me . . .
—Joseph 1:5–7
Like that of the 11th son, Joseph, the final confession of Benjamin contains
profound calls to peacefulness:
If your mind is set toward good, even evil men will be at peace with you; the
dissolute will respect you and turn back to the good. The greedy will not
only abstain from their passion but will give the oppressed the things which
they covetously hold . . . for if anyone wantonly attacks a pious man, he
repents, since the pious man shows mercy to the one who abused him, and
maintains silence . . .
—Benjamin 5
The Testament of Job
Job is one of the most perplexing books of the Old Testament. The Testament of
Job, a work from the first century BCE to first century CE, purports to be about
a non-Jew named Job. In the Testament, God and Satan make a wager to see
how loyal Job will remain if his life is made miserable. Satan doesn’t believe
that Job will continue to praise God if Job has nothing to be thankful for.
162
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

The entire biblical book of Job consists mostly of conversations between the
suffering Job and his “friends” who come to discuss his situation with him;
each one advises Job in a different way, and none of them believe that Job is
really innocent of sin. The book appears to be a frank reflection on suffering
in this life and is also famous for featuring some of the most striking poetry in
the Bible.
The Testament of Job, however, is an expansion on the biblical material. Even
though the discussion of Job’s losses is very brief in the Bible, in the Testament,
it’s the subject of considerable attention. Job’s piety and his widely known
generosity to the poor are expressed in great detail, and this is followed by a
detailed ledger sheet of his losses (for example, Satan destroyed “7,000 sheep . . .
3,000 camels . . . 500 donkeys . . . 500 oxen”) as well as more details on the death
of his family.
The Testament elaborates on the biblical story and occasionally stops to tell
a “back story” explaining why the biblical text reads the way it does. Among
these unusual stories is the story of three “sashes,” or pieces of cloth, that
God gives Job, who then gives them to his daughters to perform miraculous
feats such as speaking in heavenly languages. Finally, the Testament describes
Job’s own death.
Other than glorifying Job’s deeds for the poor and his generosity before
Satan’s intervention, there seems little in this writing that is particularly
memorable or rewarding other than a few entertaining tales only awkwardly
related to the older tradition surrounding the biblical book of Job.
The Testaments of the Three Patriarchs
Clearly, Testament literature is a popular literary form used to sum up the
important wisdom of life in order to pass it on to the next generation. It’s nat-
ural, then, that writers would assign “last testaments” to other famous people
in the Bible as well — as the Testament of the Three Patriarchs does with famous
characters from Genesis. However, the odd thing about these three sections is
that the famous people are rather apprehensive about their deaths and even
try to postpone their final hour!
In each of the three testaments, Michael the archangel is sent to the famous
earthly person to explain that he’s about to die and that Michael is there to
take away his spirit and bring him to heaven.
The Testament of Abraham
As the Testament of Abraham begins, God sends Michael to fetch the spirit of
Abraham because it’s time for Abraham to die. As in the famous scene in
Genesis 18 when heavenly visitors come to see Abraham, here Abraham
163
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

doesn’t seem to understand at first why Michael has come to visit. Michael
returns to heaven to protest to God that he just can’t take Abraham’s spirit
because old Abraham is such a righteous man!
God and Michael hatch a plot to plant a dream in Abraham’s son Isaac’s sleep
about his father’s death so that when Isaac describes his dream to his father,
Abraham will come to understand that it’s finally his time.
The rest of the Testament of Abraham essentially consists of Abraham asking
questions of Michael, attempting to stall his death until he gets a number of
questions answered. Abraham wants to see the heavens and to understand
more about the judgments against humanity. Michael (and God) agrees to
these requests, and Abraham is taken up into the heavens to be shown the
glories of heaven and the judgments prepared for human beings.
Along the way, Abraham sees human beings in the very acts of sinning,
including fighting with swords, engaging in sexual immorality, and thieves
breaking into a house to steal from it. In each case, Abraham demands that
the sinners be punished, and Michael agrees. But God becomes concerned
with Abraham’s overzealous attitude toward the punishment of sinners:
. . . Abraham has not sinned and he has no mercy on sinners. But I made the
world, and I do not want to destroy any one of them, but I delay the death of
the sinner until he should convert and live . . .
—Testament of Abraham 75
Abraham is shown how the judgment of God attempts to draw people away
from their sins. This writing seems to include a criticism of other Jewish writ-
ings that are too zealous about punishment, and it calls for more compassion
than even Abraham managed to exhibit.
Abraham also asks Michael about the understanding of evil. So death himself
comes to visit Abraham, but what Abraham sees is a handsome man dressed
in colorful robes! Eventually, Abraham figures out who this is and demands
that he show himself as he truly is. There follows a frightening description
that includes:
 Seven fiery heads
 A lion
 A cobra
 A serpent
 The face of swords
 Storm-tossed seas
 Poisons
 Every disease known to humans
164
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

After a discussion about the nature of death and the fact that people are des-
tined to die in different ways, death promises life and strength to Abraham if
Abraham kisses his hand. Thus Abraham is deceived by death, and immediately
Abraham’s spirit is taken from his body. The book ends with the mourning of his
family.
The Testament of Isaac
This second-century CE work, which is the second installment of the Testaments
of Three Patriarchs, begins like the Testament of Abraham (see the previous
section) except that there’s no “bargaining” with Michael that leads to
extended discussions about death, the nature of judgment, and the heavens.
The Testament of Isaac is more ethical in its teachings, including an extended
passage about Isaac’s advice to his children. Among the ethical injunctions
advised to his child Jacob, Isaac advises:
. . . continue to supplicate God with repentance for your past sins, and do
not commit more sin. Accordingly, do not kill with the sword, do not kill with
the tongue, do not fornicate with your body, and do not remain angry until
sunset. Do not let yourself receive unjustified praise, and do not rejoice at
the fall of your enemies or of your brothers. Do not blaspheme; beware of
slander. Do not look at a woman with a lustful eye . . .
—Testament of Isaac 4:49–54
After a lengthy ethical speech, Isaac (like Abraham) is taken up into heaven
and allowed to see the judgments against sinners. Some of these visions are
very strange, such as the person being eaten by lions over and over again.
When Isaac asks why this person is suffering in this way, he’s told that the
man was angry with his brother for hours and died before he could be
reconciled to him.
Eventually, Isaac meets Abraham, who gives him further spiritual advice, and
then Isaac briefly returns to earth to say a final goodbye to his son Jacob, after
which Isaac dies. At the end of this work is a recognition that these stories are
to be read on a special day of the year. This detail probably applies to the
entire work of the Testaments of the Three Patriarchs, not only the material
dealing with Isaac.
The Testament of Jacob
This roughly second- to third-century CE work seems to complete the three
works, identified in some modern collections of non-biblical writings as
Testaments of Three Patriarchs.
165
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

The Testament of Jacob features Jacob commenting on the future of the
Israelite peoples. It also includes ethical advice for his descendants. Scholars
generally think that this writing doesn’t add a significant amount to the mate-
rial covered in the testaments of Abraham and Isaac.
In the Testament of Jacob, an angel appears to Jacob and explains that it’s
the same angel who has been protecting Jacob throughout his life (referring
to episodes noted in the biblical story of Jacob in Genesis). An interesting dif-
ference between this work and the testaments of Abraham and Isaac is that
this work frequently advises its readers to consult the books of the Bible for
more information. But, like the others, it features a list of sins to avoid and
ethical practices and spiritual practices to maintain.
The Testament of Moses
The Testament of Moses is a first-century CE work that purports to be a word
of advice and prophecy given to Joshua, the successor of Moses in the
Israelite story of the Exodus and conquest of the land of Canaan.
But in this Testament, Moses informs Joshua of the unfortunate events in the
future of Israel, including the sins of the people leading to the destruction of
the Temple and the events of the Maccabees and their taking over the Temple
in Jerusalem. This writing appears to contain serious hostility toward the
Maccabean family, a point which has led many scholars to wonder if this
work is to be associated with the Dead Sea community, which also held deep
animosity toward the Temple officials who descended from the Maccabean
conquerors of Jerusalem.
Chapter 6 of the Testament of Moses contains a description that many histo-
rians presume to be a description of Herod the Great and his overcoming of
the Hasmonean (Maccabean) dynasties between 37 BCE and 4 CE:
Then powerful kings will rise over them, and they will be called priests of
the Most High God. They will perform great impiety in the Holy of Holies. And
a wanton king, who will not be of a priestly family, will follow them. He will
be a man rash and perverse, and he will judge them as they deserve. He 
will shatter their leaders with the sword . . .
—Testament of Moses 6
Joshua is overcome with grief at knowing that Moses is soon to die, but
Moses continues to encourage him despite the warnings of unfortunate
developments in the future. This work is a word of hope for the righteous:
Despite the coming problems, they will flourish!
166
Part II: Ancient Jewish Lost Books 

The Testament of Solomon
The first- to third-century CE Testament of Solomon is one of the most enter-
taining and strange writings that we survey in this chapter. This work is at once
shocking and entertaining: It reveals that there was a large Jewish population
(and a Christian population) who maintained a very detailed and deeply held
belief about magical amulets and warding off demons. It also reveals that this
population felt that it was very important to have highly technical and detailed
information about the precise names of the demons and the precise names of
the angels used to ward off the power of the demons.
The setting and context of this book is the great building of the Temple in
Jerusalem. As you know from the biblical history, although David has the notion
to build a Temple in Jerusalem for the God of Israel, David isn’t able to carry out
his plan. Solomon, his son, is the one chosen for the task. This writing, however,
elaborates an entire series of legends about the construction of the Temple.
As the story begins, you’re introduced to a Temple construction worker whose
son (also working on the Temple, it seems) is plagued by a demon who is not
only stealing the wages of his work but is also literally sucking the life out of
the boy (out of his thumb!) every night. When this situation comes to the
attention of King Solomon, the King gives the boy a magic ring with powers
over demons. When the demon shows up, the boy throws the ring at the
demon and demands that he go to King Solomon himself! The demon is com-
pelled to go, and this is where the story gets interesting.
King Solomon demands to know the name of the demon, who is “Ornias.” Ornias
explains not only his name but also the zodiac sign he resides in (this is another
indication of Jewish interest in astrology at this early date). As King Solomon is
about to punish Ornias with forced labor, Ornias begs for mercy, whereupon
Solomon demands to meet the King of Demons himself! Using the magic ring,
“Beelzeboul” (similar to the name in Matthew 10:25) is brought to Solomon.
For the next few chapters, Solomon forces the King of Demons to call up indi-
vidual demons one by one. The demons are forced to explain who they are
and which heavenly angels have power over them. In each case, a heavenly
angel is named, suggesting that this writing may have been partially intended
to provide a guide for the making of magical amulets against particular evils.
What’s truly fascinating, however, is that each time a demon is controlled by
Solomon, he then puts the demon to work on some portion of the Temple —
cutting stones, making ropes, cutting wood, and so on. Here’s a brief example
of this enslavement of a demon using a kind of magical action:
167
Chapter 9: Popular Legends and Expansions of Older Hebrew Traditions

Finally, I asked him, “By what name are you thwarted?” He responded, “The
name of the archangel Azael.” Then I placed my seal on the demon and
commanded him to pick up stones and hurl them up to the heights of the
Temple for the workmen . . .
—Testament of Solomon 7:7–8
One “giveaway” explanation for all the technical names in this work comes in
Chapter 13, when one of the demons named Obyzouth, who causes babies to
die in birth, admits that he’s resisted by people writing the name of the
Archangel Raphael on “. . . a piece of papyrus and I shall flee from them to the
other world!” In fact, in Chapter 15, Solomon explains that he’s writing this
work so that, after his death, his descendants will know how to exert power
over demons.
Sadly, at the end of the Testament of Solomon, Solomon succumbs to his
passion for a woman who insists that he offer sacrifices to her gods or she
won’t marry him. Because of this sin, Solomon confesses that God’s spirit
departed from him, and he warns his readers that he’s leaving this informa-
tion for those who would “find grace forever.”

Lost Books 
about Jesus

In this part . . .
T
his part proves that Jews definitely didn’t have all the
fun in the ancient world. When it came to writings
about Jesus, the earliest Christians had their books that
they trusted and revered (the four canonical Gospels), but
they also knew about a number of writings that were prob-
ably intended to be pious entertainment and a few that
were downright unsettling. In this part, you discover that
some early Christian writings about Jesus seemed to be
inspired by sheer curiosity, approaching questions like
“What happened to Jesus as a young man?” and “Did
Jesus say much outside of the four Gospels?” Ask a ques-
tion often enough, and somebody comes up with some
creative answers . . . and you find that some of the early
Christian writings about Jesus are nothing if not creative!

Ancient Writings on the Youth 
and Infancy of Jesus
In This Chapter
 Defining the Infancy Gospels
 Summarizing accounts of Jesus’s youth in various infancy writings
M
ost modern Christians don’t realize that the birth of Jesus held little
importance in earliest Christianity compared to the Resurrection — as
evident from the fact that the infancy of Jesus is dealt with so briefly in the
New Testament. Most of the charming tales and traditions about Christ’s
birth and infancy arose much later — beginning in the second century but
expanding exponentially as people became more interested in the subject.
For the study of the Infancy Gospels of Jesus, we turn to a marvelous
resource produced by the noted New Testament and Apocrypha scholar, J. K.
Elliott. He has actually categorized all the major Infancy Gospels into “synop-
sis form” so that you can follow the general outline of each work, comparing
each section as he moves along. This is a tremendous resource for study, and
it indicates the major episodes of most of these writings. In other words, most
of these works have some version of the traditions listed in the next section.
What’s Covered in the Infancy 
Gospels and Why
What follows is the list of Infancy Gospel categories created by J. K. Elliott.
This organizational structure has become the standard arrangement in biblical
scholarship regarding the Infancy Gospels:
 Mary’s birth and upbringing
 The Annunciation
 Mary visits Elizabeth

 Mary’s pregnancy and its explanation
 The birth of Jesus
 The Adoration of Jesus
 The presentation at the Temple
 The Magi (whom you may know as the “Wise Men”)
 The slaying of the infants and the flight to Egypt
 Jesus as a child
There are no real surprises here. In fact, this list is pretty close to what one
might formulate by using the Infancy stories in the two Gospels that feature
birth narratives: Luke and Matthew.
Most historians believe that these additional writings, the Infancy Gospels, arose
from the sheer curiosity of the early Christians and their persistent question,
“What was Jesus like as a youth?” This interest seems hardly surprising given
that people tend to be curious about the backgrounds of major personalities
from more recent history. So, could you suppose that perusing the Infancy
Gospels is like reading a second-century People magazine? Perhaps, but with a
considerable amount of religious piety added in, to be sure! These writings were
intended to encourage faith, not make fraudulent claims.
Take care not to think like a modern when evaluating what amounts to reli-
gious folklore. Some folklore is intended to be very pious and devotional and
is expressed with exaggerated claims that often aren’t historical, although
intended with positive motives!
Primary Sources about the Infant Jesus
There are two basic sources for info about the infant Jesus. The Proto-
Evangelium of James and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas (not to be confused
with the Gospel of Thomas, a different work that we cover in Chapter 11) are
the two oldest of the Infancy Gospels. Others were written that add new
episodes or ideas, but they largely draw on the two older writings as sources.
Over 150 Greek texts of the Proto-Evangelium of James are on record, showing
that it was widely read and appreciated. It’s dated sometime in the second
century CE. Similarly, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is also dated to roughly
the second century CE.
Some very important ideas, especially in Roman Catholic and Orthodox piety
surrounding Mary, can be traced to the influence of these writings. A key
example is the Immaculate Conception of Mary, which refers to the belief in
these later traditions that Mary was born without original sin and had an
extraordinarily “pure” life (pure meaning “no sex”).
172
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

The Proto-Evangelium of James
The notion of a “Proto-Evangel” literally means “before the Good News.”
These are events that are purported to take place before the events covered
by the biblical Gospels. As such, the Proto-Evangelium of James sets up the
Gospel stories with additional information about the characters in the early
years of Jesus but also introduces characters that will turn up later. This is a
classic example of early Christians being so curious about some of the famil-
iar characters of the Gospel story that they wanted what we now call in the
movie biz a “prequel” to the story as well as the many “sequels” that were
written about events after the Gospel stories.
Note that all the information supplied in the Proto-Evangelium takes place
before you actually find out about Jesus himself, and most of the writing is
about the supporting characters in the story.
Episode one: Mary is born
The Proto-Evangelium of James begins with a sad scene as Joachim, the
father of Mary, appears to offer gifts at the Temple in Jerusalem. An official
stops Joachim and says that it isn’t proper for a man who hasn’t contributed
a child to Israel to offer gifts ahead of those who have. This insult saddens
Joachim, and after checking to be sure that indeed most of the major figures
of Israelite history have had children, he retires to the wilderness to fast for
40 days and nights.
Meanwhile, his wife Anna is also lamenting her childless state. Outside under
a laurel tree, Anna sings a song of lament to God, praying that she, like Sarah
in the Old Testament, might still be given a child. Immediately an angel
appears to announce that Anna will have a child and that two other angels
have also told Joachim, who is already preparing to make a huge sacrifice
from his flocks for a celebration. When he returns from his fast, Anna meets
him in great joy, and they rest that night.
Joachim’s gift at the Temple is accepted, and soon Anna gives birth to a
female child and names her Mary. As soon as Mary can walk, Anna makes a
pact with God that Mary will be dedicated to God at the Temple and be cared
for by Hebrew virgins. Mary’s first birthday is celebrated with great joy, and
the Priests bless Mary:
O God of the heavenly heights, look upon this child and bless her with a
supreme blessing which cannot be superseded.
—Proto-Evangelium of James 6:2 (tr. Elliott)
Upon Mary’s third birthday, Joachim and Anna fulfill their promise to God
that Mary will serve in the Temple, and she’s taken there. The people at the
Temple are amazed that a 3-year-old is so willing to stay at the Temple:
173
Chapter 10: Ancient Writings on the Youth and Infancy of Jesus

And her parents returned marveling, praising the Lord God because the
child did not turn back. And Mary was in the Temple of the Lord nurtured
like a dove and received food from the hand of an angel.
—Proto-Evangelium of James 8:1–2 (tr. Elliott)
Episode two: Joseph is chosen as Mary’s husband
This episode is quite interesting. The Priests at the Temple decide that Mary
must leave the Temple as she approaches age 12 because if she were to begin
menstruating while at the Temple, the Temple would become unclean. So, they
search throughout Judea to find an appropriate husband for her. A miraculous
sign chooses Joseph, who in this writing already has sons and is an older man.
At first, he protests that he will be a laughingstock for marrying a young girl!
But the Priests advise him to obey God’s selection, so Mary is taken into
Joseph’s house as a ward. Meanwhile, Joseph goes on a building campaign (he
is, you recall, a carpenter).
Episode three: Mary weaves the veil that will be torn
A clever episode is inserted here. The Priests of the Temple determine to have
a veil made for the Holy of Holies in the Temple, and they find seven virgins to
weave and make this sacred cloth. They remember Mary and choose her to do
part of the work. This is the same veil, of course, that’s miraculously torn at
the crucifixion of Jesus, so this episode has some clever foreshadowing.
Episodes four and five: Behold, a virgin shall conceive . . .
Episode four is the announcement by an angel to Mary that she is to give
birth to Jesus. This episode doesn’t seriously diverge from the New Testament
accounts in Luke, and episode five, in which Mary’s cousin Elizabeth (mother
of John the Baptist) visits with Mary, is even shorter than the account in Luke.
As Mary starts to show her pregnancy, the Proto-Evangelium elaborates on
something that readers of the New Testament have wondered about for cen-
turies: Surely there was a serious reaction from Joseph! This writing deals with
the issue in a big way:
And he struck his face, threw himself down on the ground on sackcloth and
wept bitterly saying, “With what countenance shall I look towards the Lord
my God? What prayer shall I offer for this maiden? For I received her as a
virgin out of the Temple of the Lord my God and have not protected her.
Who has deceived me? Who has done this evil in my house and defiled the
virgin? Had the story of Adam been repeated in me? For as Adam was
absent in the hour of his prayer, and the serpent came and found Eve alone
and deceived her, so also has it happened to me!”
—Proto-Evangelium of James 13 (tr. Elliott)
174
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Joseph asks Mary why she has done this. Joseph is perplexed: If he doesn’t
reveal the truth to the religious authorities, he fears that he’s sinning, but if he
turns Mary over to the authorities (Priests, or local elders), she will die. He
decides to try to spirit her away quietly. However, in time, she’s discovered, and
the Priests demand to know why Joseph has violated Mary and consummated a
marriage with her — a marriage that hasn’t taken place as yet! They both plead
innocence, but of course no one believes them. The Priest puts them through an
ordeal of drinking a special potion that reveals guilt, and they both survive, indi-
cating innocence (this scene is similar to the ritual in Numbers 5). The Priest
honors the results of the test and sends Joseph and Mary home.
The time for the birth approaches, and like in the New Testament story (Luke 2:1),
Joseph must go and register his family. Along the way, Joseph sees Mary first
sad and then laughing because she has had a vision of one group of people
weeping and another group rejoicing. Soon, Joseph finds a cave where Mary
can give birth.
In one version of the tradition, Joseph sees a vision of everything in heaven
coming to a stop — heavenly rivers stopped, heavenly animals stopped, work-
men stopped — all apparently in awe of the approaching birth. A midwife hap-
pens to walk by, and Joseph sends her to Mary in the cave. After a bright light,
Jesus is born and begins to feed at Mary’s breast. The midwife, however, does-
n’t believe that a virginal birth is possible, and she tells Mary to prepare for her
to test with her finger. When the midwife does this, she cries out: “Woe for my
wickedness and unbelief; for I have tempted the living God!” (Proto-Evangelium
of James 20). Her hands are immediately stricken, and an angel tells her to
touch the child and be healed.
The appearance of the Wise Men follows rather closely to the account in the
Gospel of Matthew.
Episode six: Zacharias, John the Baptist’s father, is martyred
The Proto-Evangelium adds an entirely new and final episode with regard to
King Herod seeking the child John (Jesus’s cousin, the future “Baptizer”).
Elizabeth and the child are miraculously hidden in a mountain with an angel,
but John’s father Zacharias, who is a Priest in the Temple, faces Herod’s anger.
Herod has him slain, and Zacharias’s blood stains the Temple. Eventually, the
Priests choose another Priest, Simeon, to replace Zacharias. Simeon eventu-
ally appears in the New Testament in Luke’s account of Jesus’s birth.
The Proto-Evangelium concludes with a brief note claiming that James has
written the account.
175
Chapter 10: Ancient Writings on the Youth and Infancy of Jesus

The Infancy Gospel of Thomas: 
A mischievous young Jesus
The Infancy Gospel of Thomas has gained some notoriety precisely because of
the unexpected way in which the young boy Jesus is portrayed as a rather
mischievous prankster whose pranks are more dangerous because of his mirac-
ulous powers! Many people have heard of one or two of the stories featured
here, but it’s important to get the whole story, because the point of the writing
seems to be the maturing of Jesus, which you can only grasp from reading the
entire work. It was hardly intended to be a blasphemous work, but those who
only know an episode or two may think differently!
Episode one: Bringing clay sparrows to life
The Infancy Gospel of Thomas begins when Jesus is 5 years old. The first
episode involves Jesus playing in mud (sounds right for a 5-year-old) and
making clay sparrows. But it’s Sabbath, and someone tells Joseph that his
son is profaning the Sabbath by making things. When Jesus is confronted, he
claps his hands and the clay sparrows turn to real birds and fly away.
Episode two: The young Jesus kills a playmate
In the second episode, Jesus gathers pools of water, and the son of Annas the
Scribe disperses the pools with a stick. The young Jesus is angry:
You insolent, godless ignoramus! What harm did the pools and the water do
to you? Behold, now you also shall wither like a tree and shall bear neither
leaves nor root nor fruit!
—Infancy Gospel of Thomas 3:2 (tr. Elliott, 76)
The boy dies immediately, and his parents yell at Joseph: “What kind of child
do you have, who does such things?” What kind indeed! Another child bumps
Jesus, and he too is struck dead by the child Jesus. Parents begin to complain
to Joseph to control his kid. When Joseph confronts Jesus, Jesus strikes the
other children’s parents blind! Fed up, Joseph takes Jesus by the ear to scold
him — whereupon Jesus protests at being treated this way.
However, a man called Zacchaeus overhears the exchange between Jesus and
Joseph and is impressed with how Jesus can speak; he asks Joseph if he can
tutor the clever boy. Zacchaeus starts with the Greek alphabet, but after a
time, Jesus asks the teacher about the first two letters, Alpha and Beta:
How do you, who do not know the Alpha according to its nature, teach
others the Beta? Hypocrite, first if you know it, teach the Alpha, and then we
shall believe you concerning the Beta.
—Infancy Gospel of Thomas 6:3-4 (tr. Elliott, 77)
176
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

This excerpt suggests a Gnostic quality to this writing, especially in the
sneering attitude toward those who are considered ill-informed. Further, it’s a
strange saying, suggesting that most people don’t understand truth beyond
simple basics, and an all-knowing young Jesus almost ridicules people for not
knowing these deeper truths. Zacchaeus begs Joseph to take Jesus back
because the tutor can’t handle Jesus or understand what Jesus has been
saying: “. . . Whatever great thing he is, a god or an angel I do not know what I
should say . . .” (Infancy Gospel of Thomas 7:4). Then Jesus laughs and talks
about his calling:
Now let those who are yours bear fruit, and let the blind in heart see. I have
come from above to curse them and to call them to things above, as he who
sent me ordained for your sakes. . .
—Infancy Gospel of Thomas 8:1
Note the clear Gnostic hints: the nasty laughter, the idea of “being sent” from
the higher God of light, and the notion of coming to teach rather than act.
Episode three: The young Jesus resurrects a playmate
This episode has Jesus playing on an upper story of a house. The boy playing
with Jesus falls and dies, and Jesus is accused of killing yet another child. But
Jesus asks the dead child, “Arise — and tell me, did I throw you down?” (The
Infancy Gospel of Thomas 9). The child rises to life and tells everyone that he
wasn’t pushed. From this time on, the miracles that Jesus performs are some-
what more positive than in earlier episodes, but not entirely. For example, Jesus
heals a man who accidentally chops into his foot while chopping wood, he
makes corn grow so abundantly that everyone in the village shares the extra
food, and he also stretches a piece of wood that Joseph has cut too short for
a project.
At age 8, Joseph tries another teacher. But when Jesus answers this teacher,
the teacher slaps Jesus, and Jesus strikes him dead. When a third teacher
tries to teach Jesus, he immediately recognizes Jesus’s wisdom and allows
Jesus to teach instead. When Joseph comes to check on his son, the third
teacher tells Joseph to take Jesus because he already knows what he needs
to know. Jesus is pleased with the third teacher and to honor him raises to
life the second teacher who was stricken.
Jesus performs a series of miracles — raising a dead child and a dead worker
to life to the amazement of all. Finally, one of the traditions of this writing ends
with Jesus, at age 12, teaching the elders in the Temple (following the biblical
tradition you see in Luke and from artist Heinrich Hofmann’s rendering in
Figure 10-1). It’s likely that this episode in the actual Gospel of Luke inspired
some of the ideas further developed in somewhat controversial ways in the
Infancy Gospel of Thomas. It’s worth remembering this interesting tradition in
Luke in order to see how a line or two may have led to further development of
the “youth of Jesus” folklore explored in writings like the Infancy Gospel of
Thomas. Here’s the passage from Luke:
177
Chapter 10: Ancient Writings on the Youth and Infancy of Jesus

And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival.
When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed
behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Assuming that he was
in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. Then they started to look
for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they
returned to Jerusalem to search for him. After three days they found him in
the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them
questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and
his answers. When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his
mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your
father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.” He said to them,
“Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my
Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he said to them. Then he
went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His
mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in
wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.

Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

The idea of Jesus not behaving entirely as expected toward his parents may
have inspired the authors to push this idea farther in the Infancy Gospel of
Thomas. But what you should notice is that Jesus moves from youthful
prankster to more mature healer and miracle worker at age 12. The goal of
this Infancy Gospel is to magnify the maturing of Jesus into a full realization
of his relationships to human beings — less judge and more loving.
Professor J. K. Elliott, one of the modern experts on non-canonical Christian
literature, points out that the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is really misnamed
because it doesn’t deal with the birth of Jesus at all, but his early boyhood!
Furthermore, no part of the text actually claims to be written by a “Thomas”!
Secondary Infancy Gospels
Well, one good idea deserves another, right? It seems clear that the Infancy
Gospel of Thomas, although interesting in many ways, was also offensive to
many early Christian readers and thus spun off into “sequels” or even differ-
ent versions! The next few writings appear to be elaborations of the Thomas-
type stories.
The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew: Taking 
the older works a step farther
The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which Professor Elliott and others date to the
sixth century CE, is considerably later than the two major writings covered
earlier in this chapter, but this document made many of the traditions in the
older works known throughout medieval Europe.
In other words, Pseudo-Matthew (“pseudo” means there’s no concrete evi-
dence as to who the actual author was) was more widely known than the
older writings the Proto-Evangelium of James and the Infancy Gospel of
Thomas. Pseudo-Matthew passes on many of the traditions from those writ-
ings, but it also adds considerably to the traditions about Mary. Some sug-
gest that it was written to promote the piety about and the traditions of
veneration of Mary in the early and middle medieval Christian traditions.
Emphasis on Mary’s piety
The earliest divergence from the older traditions is the lengthy descriptions of
Mary’s youth in the Temple. At length, Pseudo-Matthew describes Mary’s
piety, her time spent in prayer, and the fact that she greeted everyone with
“Thanks be to God” (and the writing notes that she started the tradition of
using this greeting among Christians). When the Priests tell Mary that it’s time
179
Chapter 10: Ancient Writings on the Youth and Infancy of Jesus

for her to marry and bear children and that this is acceptable in the Israelite
tradition, Mary answers in terms that suggest her continued devotion to
sexual purity — which will not be violated, of course, by a “virgin birth”:
It cannot be that I should know a man, or that a man should know me. . . .
God is first of all worshipped in chastity. For before Abel there was none
righteous among men, and he by his offerings pleased God, and was without
mercy slain by him who displeased him. Two crowns, therefore, he
received — of oblation and of virginity, because in his flesh there was no
pollution . . .
—Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew 6–7 (tr. Elliott, Synopsis, 16)
Pseudo-Matthew then follows the Proto-Evangelium of James closely up to
the point when Mary is given to Joseph, but Pseudo-Matthew also adds the
detail that Joseph was away for over nine months working before he returned
to his home to find Mary pregnant. The detail, obviously, serves to further
protect the reputations of Mary and Joseph!
The ritual of the test in the Temple
Pseudo-Matthew elaborates on the Temple ritual of drinking the mixture ordered
by the Priest to reveal guilt. After drinking the potion, the ritual includes circling
the altar seven times. Joseph survives the test, indicating innocence, and then
attention is on Mary; the Priests presume that she must be guilty if Joseph is
innocent. Everyone is astonished when she also circles the altar seven times and
survives, insisting on her innocence.
The addition of these ritual actions to the story suggests ritual performances,
and it’s possible to see in these later writings the beginnings of liturgical drama,
which led to many forms of Passion plays and biblical-based medieval dramas
in Southern European churches.
The examination of Mary after Jesus’s birth
The next major scene in Pseudo-Matthew elaborates on the examination of Mary
immediately after the birth of Jesus. In the older tradition, only one woman
examines Mary, and her hands are crippled as a result. In Pseudo-Matthew, how-
ever, more midwives are involved in the birth, and the first one who examines
Mary is amazed and praises God. But the second midwife doesn’t believe her and
also requests to examine Mary. She’s stricken, apparently as a result of her
doubts. But like the older tradition, the stricken midwife is healed by worship-
ping the child.
The Holy Family’s journey to Egypt
The major sections in which Pseudo-Matthew adds a great amount of mater-
ial are in the journey of the Holy Family to Egypt to escape the persecutions
of Herod. Even on the road in the opening paragraphs of these additional sto-
ries, you get an idea of the folkloric (or better, “piously legendary”) nature of
180
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

this material. When they pass some caves, the traveling party (which has
picked up some companions along the way) is terrorized by dragons:
Then Mary put Jesus down and even though he was not yet two years old he
stood on his feet before the dragons, which worshipped Jesus before
departing. This fulfilled the prophecy of the Psalmist, which says, “Praise the
Lord from the earth, ye dragons; ye dragons, and all ye deeps.” Jesus walked
before the dragons, commanding them to hurt no one. However, Mary and
Joseph were very much afraid that the dragons should hurt the child. Jesus
said to them, “Do not be afraid, and do not consider me to be a little child;
for I am and always have been perfect; and all the beasts of the forest are
tame before me.”
—Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew 18-24 (tr. Elliott, Synopsis, 113)
This interesting passage clearly draws from Psalm 148:7: “Praise the Lord
from the earth, you sea monsters and all deeps. . . .” The passage probably
refers to legendary sea monsters believed to exist by many of the peoples
surrounding the ancient Israelites. This may be a kind of taunt from the
ancient Israelites against those beliefs. However, the tradition merges with
medieval belief in dragons of a different sort!
According to Pseudo-Matthew many animals accompanied the travelers, to
the delight of the young Jesus. Also, when they stop at an oasis, Jesus makes
the palm trees bend over to make it easy to pick fruit and uproot from their
roots a source of water. Finally, Jesus makes the long journey much shorter.
When they arrive in Egypt, the party comes to a pagan Temple with many
idols of gods. When Mary and the child enter the Temple, all the idols bow in
submission to Jesus and then shatter. When a local official approaches with
his army, the priests of the Temple fear that the family will be killed. But the
officer says that the idols would not have bowed if Jesus weren’t God of Gods
and King of Kings, and he honors the child Jesus.
Jesus as a youth
Pseudo-Matthew picks up with significant additional material in the story again
after the return from Egypt and begins to follow the traditions of the Infancy
Gospel of Thomas (refer to that section earlier in this chapter to find out more
about these traditions). In Pseudo-Matthew, however, the first boy who’s struck
dead for messing with Jesus’s pools of water is eventually brought back to life
after Mary pleads with Jesus. Furthermore, the boy who nudges Jesus (pre-
sented as intentional bullying in Pseudo-Matthew) is also healed after Mary
and Joseph plead with Jesus. However, Pseudo-Matthew also makes a stronger
appeal about the nastiness of those who interfered with Jesus even as a boy —
suggesting that they were no angels! The Infancy Gospel of Thomas doesn’t
mention this, and it’s clear that the later writer of Pseudo-Matthew wants to
present Jesus in a somewhat more flattering light in these stories.
181
Chapter 10: Ancient Writings on the Youth and Infancy of Jesus

Pseudo-Matthew also elaborates heavily on the exchanges between Jesus and
his proposed teachers. In this version, the teachers are more malevolent,
there’s a bit less esoteric mystery, and there’s still a discussion of Alpha and
Beta. In the end, Jesus is presented in a more positive (and less mysterious)
light than he is in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas; for example, his laughter is
joyful instead of the laughter of one reviling stupid people:
Jesus, smiling . . . with a joyful countenance, said in a commanding voice to
all the sons of Israel standing by and hearing, “Let the unfruitful bring forth
fruit, and the blind see, and the lame walk right, and poor enjoy the good
things of this life, and the dead live, and each may return to his original state,
and abide in him who is the root of life and perpetual sweetness.” And when
the child Jesus had said this, forthwith all who had fallen under malignant
diseases were restored. And they did not dare to say anything more to him . . .
—Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew 30–31 (tr. Elliott, Synopsis, 148)
Pseudo-Matthew finishes with two charming stories: one episode in which
the young Jesus plays with a lioness and her cubs to the astonishment of
everyone who watches (“. . . they recognize who I am, why don’t you?”), and
another episode in which Jesus assists Joseph in healing an older man who
was sick and died. At this point, Pseudo-Matthew seems to lead into a discus-
sion of the ministry of Jesus, probably intending to be followed by readings
from the New Testament Gospels.
The Arabic Infancy Gospel
The Arabic Infancy Gospel is another collection of early Jesus legends, based
heavily on the Proto-Evangelium of James and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas
(both of which we cover earlier in this chapter). This work is likely to be fifth
century at the earliest and is often thought to be based on an origin work written
in Syriac (an early Semitic language related to Hebrew and Aramaic) and coming
from Christian traditions of the East. Eastern Christians (in Syria and farther
east) used Syriac heavily from the second century CE onwards, and Christian his-
torians and theologians to this day study the rich tradition in Syriac.
A considerable amount of the material that’s unique to the Arabic Infancy
Gospel focuses on the Holy Family in Egypt. Also, the work adds more mira-
cles to the journey through Egypt, with a series of visits to different towns
and a new miracle in each town. The miracles include:
 Healing a bride who couldn’t speak
 Driving demons from a young women
 Scaring away robbers with miraculous sounds of many people
 Driving away a serpent who had tormented an important woman in
another village
182
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

In one of these longer, more elaborate stories, a princess cries privately until
companions of the Holy Family find her and ask what’s wrong. She explains
that after a long time, she finally provided a son to the Prince, but the child
was stricken with leprosy and the father wanted nothing to do with him. The
companions of the Holy Family arrange to take water used to wash the child
Jesus and pour it over the princess’s son, who’s instantly healed to great joy
and celebration.
Finally, when Mary and Jesus are traveling, two robbers in hiding discuss
whether to attack them. One of the robbers begs to leave them alone, but the
other refuses. Mary overhears the conversation and blesses the good robber,
named Titus, for trying to do a good work. Although they’re prevented from
doing Mary and Jesus any harm, the young Jesus identifies the men as the
two robbers who will eventually be crucified on either side of Jesus, and
Jesus will forgive Titus for having tried to do the right thing years earlier.
We can’t conclude our survey of the Arabic Infancy Gospel without mention-
ing one more charming miracle story from the youth of Jesus. In the story,
Jesus is playing with some children near the dye works of a man named
Salem. When cloth accidentally spills into a vat of dye and everything is col-
ored indigo, Salem is angry that his work is ruined. The young Jesus, how-
ever, offers to change the colors of the cloth, and as Salem calls out a color,
Jesus draws out cloth from the indigo vat that’s miraculously colored the
very color that Salem asks for!
Other infancy traditions of later vintage
Christian history beyond the fourth century CE knows many more infancy
traditions that contain even more elaborations on the earlier traditions.
Surveys include such writings as
 The Arundel Manuscript: A Latin text that may go back to the fourth to
fifth centuries CE and contains a few additional traditions but mostly tes-
tifies to the Latin traditions that became more widely known in the West
 The History of Joseph the Carpenter: A text that’s narrated by Jesus in
the first person and adds a tradition about the death of Joseph
 Later materials that show that these traditions arrived in Ireland very
early (perhaps in the seventh century CE) and were subject to copying
and additional development there (for example, the three Wise Men are
called “Druids” in one version)
Most of these tales of the birth of Jesus and the boyhood of Jesus are rather
innocent, at times quite entertaining, and even occasionally quite moving.

Chapter 10: Ancient Writings on the Youth and Infancy of Jesus

In some places, however, these traditional stories are taken quite seriously as
stories of faith. Among the Coptic Orthodox churches of Egypt, for example,
Egyptian Christians have journeyed an entire “itinerary” of the travels of the
Holy Family as a kind of spiritual pilgrimage for centuries, with travelers cele-
brating the specific miracles at each stop along the way. An American writer
recently wrote about his experiences following this old traditional path in
modern Egypt, and it’s a wonderful read; we recommend that you check out
Jesus in Egypt: Discovering the Secrets of Christ’s Childhood Years, by Paul
Perry (Ballantine Books).

Chapter 11
Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus
In This Chapter
 Finding the lost sayings of Jesus
 Identifying Jesus’s sayings in early Christian literature
 Reviewing the major “other” gospels
Jesus spoke. And according to some ancient “lost books,” he spoke words
that didn’t end up in the Bible as you know it. Sometimes, these sayings
are found in quotations from early Christian writers. In other cases, they’re
ancient fragments of texts that mention a saying or two of Jesus. Finally, how-
ever, there’s an entire collection called the Gospel of Thomas that has dozens
of sayings claimed to be from Jesus.
In this chapter, we examine some of these traditions about Jesus that circu-
lated from the first to third centuries CE — the first “Christian” centuries. In
some cases, you see that these writings represent a kind of sequel to known
sayings of Jesus from the Gospels, but in other cases, intriguing sayings are
quoted that seem reasonably similar to the Jesus known from the Gospels.
And, if it looks like his words and sounds like his words . . . well, then maybe it
is his words! You come to find out, however, that this discussion can get
understandably controversial when dealing with Jesus, the central figure in
the largest religion in the world.
With the intriguing exception of the Gospel of Thomas, virtually all the writings
discussed in this chapter are derivative — that is, they’re clearly based on
knowledge of the older, canonical gospels. They don’t add significant infor-
mation on the historical Jesus. Thomas, however, is treated as a special case
because it may contain a few genuine sayings; but without any narrative
description of Jesus, and because Thomas includes some obviously Gnostic
forgeries as well, it’s easy to see why the work was also excluded from the Bible.

Sources for Lost Sayings of Jesus
Many “sayings” of Jesus don’t appear in the canonical Gospels you know
(Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). In fact, some of the most famous sayings of
Jesus are in the New Testament but aren’t in the Gospels! Consider the following
well-known quotation of Jesus cited in the Book of Acts but unknown in the four
Gospels:
In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help
the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: “It is more
blessed to give than to receive.”
—Acts 20:35
Fair enough — but what about sayings that are completely outside the New
Testament? Plenty of those exist, too, and we have three main “sources” for
these kinds of sayings. This section walks you through each one.
First source: Works by later 
Christian writers
Many such sayings of Jesus are quoted by later Christian writers, including
 Origen
 Tertullian
 Jerome
 Clement of Alexandria
Many other writers from the second to fifth centuries CE and beyond also quote
sayings of Jesus. Sometimes it’s difficult to know what they’re quoting — a book,
an oral saying, or someone they heard — but historians have tried (and keep
trying) to sort this out. You can understand the difficulty if someone just says,
“It is said. . . .” Does that mean the source is oral or written? You get the idea.
Second source: Small 
fragments of papyrus
Other sayings of Jesus are noted in small fragments of papyrus (the main
writing material in ancient Egypt and elsewhere) located mainly in Egypt
(because papyrus lasts longer in the dry heat there, especially if it’s buried).
186
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Sometimes these fragments of texts are large enough to read many lines;
other times, unfortunately, scholars can hardly read anything at all on the
fragments.
Third source: Complete writings 
that have survived
Some of the lost sayings of Jesus have survived as complete (or very nearly
complete) writings, such as the Gospel of Thomas (as opposed to the Infancy
Gospel of Thomas, a quite different writing that we examine in Chapter 10) or
the shorter Gospel of Judas. Although historians often refer to these as “books,”
they’re usually collections of papyrus pages or parchment (animal skins
made into pages).
Did Jesus Really Say That? Separating
False from Genuine
Different Gospels (writings about Jesus) were written for different reasons,
and each Gospel writer decided to include things that the writer thought was
important. Matthew, for example, includes episodes that remind his reader of
the history of Israel and the life of Moses. Only Matthew has the family of
Jesus fleeing to Egypt, thus reproducing aspects of the history of Israel. Only
Matthew has Jesus deliver his famous “sermon on a mount” — thus reminding
his readers of Moses on Sinai. On the other hand, only John shares the famous
“farewell speeches” of Jesus, such as John 17, where Jesus expresses serious
concern about the safety and well-being of the disciples after Jesus leaves them.
The point of this is to say that all the Gospels have a perspective on Jesus.
The problem, however, is that some of the perspectives taken by some early
Christians were considered to be in error — or outright heresies — in the
judgment of the “orthodox” Christian movement (that is, the movement that
eventually became the main interpretation of the Christian faith). These writ-
ings were accused of misrepresenting Jesus and, even worse, were some-
times accused of literally making up sayings of Jesus to back up their own
religious ideas. Thus scholars are faced with the problem of misrepresenting,
or even making up, Jesus quotations.
Understand that misrepresentation and fabrication are two different things.
In some cases, a saying of Jesus may be more or less accurate but is quoted
in a misleading way. In other cases, the saying is an outright fabrication.
187
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

Sometimes it’s easy to tell the difference between misquotings and fabrications,
but not always. If you know the general ideas of a religious challenge to early
Christianity (like Gnosticism), it’s easier to identify a misrepresentation or even
a fabrication. For example, even though the present form of the Gospel of
Thomas (discussed later in this chapter) is clearly a product of Gnostic
Christians who were pressing their own Gnostic agenda, some of the quoted
sayings may be genuine sayings from early traditions about Jesus.
Sayings of Jesus Quoted in Early
Christian Literature
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, many sayings of Jesus were cited by
early Christian writers. Sometimes, these writers were quoting these sayings
with approval — they liked them and used them to support an argument.
Because we aren’t terribly concerned here with those arguments, we simply
cite some of the supposed quotations from Jesus that they use.
But in many other cases, these early Christian writers were attacking writings
that they thought were false, and they quoted passages to show how they
should be dismissed or avoided! In many cases, these early Christian writers
cite writings that are no longer available. Yes, many of them are truly “lost.”
Maybe someday someone will find a copy of the Gospel of the Ebionites or the
Gospel of the Hebrews, works that are quoted from by early Christian writers.
That will be an exciting day, and then we can decide for ourselves if the
quotes are fair representations of these “lost Gospels.”
Quotations from the Jewish-Christian
gospels
Jewish-Christians were a group of early Christians who were Jews and who
taught that Christians should still maintain a strong tie to Jewish tradition
and practice. A number of gospels discussed in early Christian writings are
assumed to have been written by these Jewish-Christians, although, sadly,
none of the writings themselves are in possession today. However, they’re
cited by early Christian writers who occasionally include actual quotes.
It’s assumed that the gospels were written by Jewish-Christians because of
these strong suggestions of maintaining Jewish traditions and the positive
statements made about Jewish traditions. For example, strong statements
honoring the Mosaic Law and a strong sense of social responsibility to fellow
believers have a very positive and very Jewish emphasis as opposed to
strictly spiritual discussions.
188
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

A further problem is whether all the different titles mentioned in early Christian
writings are actually different books — or different titles for some of the same
writings. Gospel of Nazarenes? Gospel of Hebrews? Gospel of Ebionites? Are
they all different?
The following titles are mentioned in early Christian writings and are believed
to come from the Jewish-Christians.
The Gospel According to the Hebrews
The lost Gospel According to the Hebrews is specifically cited by early
Christian writers such as:
 Clement (150–circa 216), an early Christian philosopher in Alexandria
 Origen (185–254), one of the most famous early Christian philosophers
in Alexandria
 Jerome (331–420), a translator of Scripture into Latin who was therefore
familiar with many early texts, including many that historians don’t 
have now
 Eusebius (263–339), an early Christian historian who has provided a
great deal of information about events and texts circulating among early
Christians
Jerome cites the following saying of Jesus quoted in this gospel: “Never be
glad unless you are in charity with your brother.” What’s notable about this is
it mandates a social concern for taking care of each other — a principle that
seems typical of Jewish ethical concern that goes right back to the Mosaic
law (Deuteronomy 15:4, 15:8, 15:11, and so on)! In fact, it sounds like it comes
from Jesus precisely because Jesus often speaks of this kind of compassion
for your “brothers and sisters.” Not surprising for a Jewish teacher, of course.
A second, longer quotation from the Gospel According to the Hebrews is
even more interesting because it highlights the importance of James in the
Jewish-Christian tradition. James was revered as a pious Jew as well as a
Christian leader of the Church in Jerusalem, so it’s hardly surprising that a
reputed Jewish-Christian gospel features a resurrection appearance to James
that doesn’t receive attention in the four canonical Gospels:
Now the Lord, when he had given the cloth to the servant of the priest, went
to James and appeared to him. For James had taken an oath that we would
not eat bread from that hour on which he had drunk the cup of the Lord till
he saw him risen from the dead. Again a little later the Lord said, “Bring a
table and bread,” and forthwith it is added: “He took bread and blessed and
broke it and gave to James the Just and said to him, ‘My brother, eat your
bread, for the Son of Man is risen from those who sleep . . .’”
—Jerome, de Viris Illustribus, 2
189
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

Jerome quotes this same Gospel of the Hebrews with another very Jewish-
sounding ethical teaching of Jesus:
In the Gospel of the Hebrews which the Nazarenes are in the habit of
reading it belongs to the greatest sins when “one afflicts the spirit of his
brother.”
—Jerome, On Ephesians
The Gospel of the Nazareans
Origen also cites from what he calls a Gospel according to the Hebrews, which
exhibits characteristics similar to the social and ethical emphasis of Jewish
Mosaic Law as well as positive statements about Jewish faith and tradition.
It’s often suggested that this is the same work that in other early citations is
referred to as the Gospel of the Nazareans.
Origen cites this Gospel of the Nazareans, which he says contains the follow-
ing fascinating expansion of a Gospel saying, most of which is familiar from
the known Gospels, except for the final sentence:
Another rich man said to him, “Master, what good things shall I do to live?”
He said to him, “O man, fulfill the law and the prophets.” He replied, “I have
done that.” He said to him, “Go, sell all that you possess and distribute it to
the poor, and come, follow me.” But the rich man began to scratch his head
and it did not please him. And the Lord said to him, “How can you say, ‘I
have fulfilled the law and the prophets’ since it is written in the law: You
shall love your neighbor as yourself, and lo! Many of your brethren, sons of
Abraham, are clothed in filth, dying of hunger, and your house is full of
many goods, and nothing at all goes out of it to them.” And returning to
Simon, his disciple, who was sitting by him, he said, “Simon, son of Jonas, it
is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man (to
enter) the kingdom of heaven.”
—Origen, On Matthew
According to Matthew 19, Jesus did say something very much like this, but when
you compare the two verses, you see that in the saying from the Gospel of the
Nazareans, Jesus goes into much greater detail about the social expectations of
what it means for people to share with each other and take responsibility for
each other. Furthermore, there’s also the unique and interesting reference to
your brothers, “sons of Abraham,” a phrase that Jesus never uses in the known
Gospels. In short, the saying from the Gospel of the Nazareans presumes a
unique emphasis on concern for fellow Jews that’s to be expected in a Jewish-
Christian gospel.
190
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

The Gospel of the Ebionites
The word “ebionites” comes from the Hebrew word for “poor or needy”
(Deuteronomy 15:4, 15:7, 15:9, and 15:11) and may have been adopted as a
name from the saying of Jesus, “Blessed are the poor,” or Jesus’s otherwise
generally favorable comments toward the poor.
The term is typically associated with a group of Jewish-Christians known as
Ebionites. Many of the quotations from the Gospel of the Ebionites are simply
rearrangements of known canonical material, but there also are some striking
and unknown sayings, such as the following that’s quoted by the early
Christian writer Epiphanius (320–403 CE):
I have come to abolish the sacrifices: if you do not cease from sacrificing,
the wrath of God will not cease from weighing upon you . . .
—Epiphanius, Against Heresies
This saying is a striking attack on the ritual of sacrifice but may not be
entirely foreign to a group of Jews for whom the sacrificial system has been
corrupted, or even stopped, by the “sacrifice” of Jesus. It furthermore
appears that the Ebionites were vegetarian, having rejected not only the sac-
rifice but also consumption of meat entirely.
Quotations from other gospel traditions
Some of the unusual early gospels reflect the ideas or odd notions of a partic-
ular sect or group quite different from the mainstream Christian movement.
They wrote their own versions of the teachings of Jesus in order to justify
those beliefs. Although the gospels show great diversity in early Christianity,
sometimes they’re downright surprising in their strange versions of Jesus!
When you come across quotes that sound strange, they were sometimes
quoted by early Christian writers to prove that they’re not genuine sayings!
The Gospel of the Egyptians
The Gospel of the Egyptians is a writing that seems to have been used to pro-
mote the views of a small group of Christians who completely ceased to believe
in marriage and sexuality. (They must have been a fun bunch, eh?) Clement of
Alexandria, who had little sympathy for this group, quoted their writings where
they claim that Jesus was opposed to marriage and giving birth:
For they say: the Saviour himself said, “I have come to undo the works of the
female,” by the female meaning lust, and by the works — birth and decay.
—Clement, Stromateis (“Miscellanies”)
191
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

Such a saying has so little in common with what’s known of Jesus and of
Jewish tradition and its praise of marriage that it seems a clear example of a
fabricated word to defend a particular religious idea — specifically, celibacy.
The Gospel of Matthias
It was Clement who identified the late-second-century CE writing the Gospel
of Matthias as a Gnostic writing, although some modern historians aren’t so
sure if Clement was right. However, if the following is an authentic quotation
from this source, it certainly sounds like the typically anti-physical, “against
the body” bias of the Gnostics:
. . . Matthias also taught thus: that we should fight with the flesh and abuse
it, not yielding to it at all for licentious pleasure, but should make the soul
grow by faith and knowledge . . .
—Clement, Stromateis
On the other hand, Clement cites another saying from this same source that
sounds somewhat different in orientation, although it could be interpreted to
mean some kind of sexual sin or activity, in which case it would be very much
in the spirit of the previous quote:
They say that in the Traditions, Matthias the apostle always states, “If the
neighbor of a chosen one sin, the chosen one has sinned: for had he
behaved himself as the world enjoins, the neighbor also would have been
ashamed of his way of life, so as not to sin.”
—Clement, Stromateis
Fragments of Jesus Sayings: 
Pieces of Unknown Gospels?
In his recent translation of a series of fragments of Jesus sayings, Professor J.
K. Elliott, one of the most important scholars of non-canonical Christian liter-
ature, includes the Oxyrhynchus fragments found in 1905 (they’re named for
an ancient Egyptian town about 100 miles south and west of modern Cairo)
and other fragments named for places or persons who first identified them or
even the wealthy benefactors who donated to museums (like the Egerton
Papyri, which we cover in a later section). These fragments are normally
dated late second century CE and as late as the fifth century.
In the following section, we discuss some of these fragments.
Such fragments are usually identified by the place they were found and by a
number to identify the particular fragment (because there are sometimes
hundreds of little fragments!).
192
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Oxyrhynchus 840
Oxyrhynchus 840 is the name given to a tiny fragment containing an interest-
ing piece written in very small letters, apparently so that it could be rolled up
and worn as an amulet inside some kind of casing.
In this long quotation, Jesus and his disciples are confronted by a Pharisee
and Priest who challenge Jesus as he walks in the Temple. He’s apparently
not supposed to be walking in a place of purity in an unclean state. Jesus
responds and engages in a polemical conversation:
. . . Thereupon the Saviour stood with his disciples and answered him: “Are
you then clean, here in the temple as you are?” He said, “I am clean, for I
have bathed in the pool of David and have gone down by one staircase and
come up by the other, and I have put on clean white clothes. Then I came
and viewed the holy vessels.” “Alas,” said the Saviour, “you blind men who
cannot see! You have washed in this running water, in which dogs and pigs
have wallowed night and day, and you have washed and scrubbed your
outer skin which harlots and flute-girls also anoint and wash and scrub,
beautifying themselves for the lusts of men while inwardly they are filled
with scorpions and unrighteousness of every kind. But my disciples and I,
whom you charge with not having bathed, have bathed ourselves in the
living water which comes down from heaven . . .”
—Oxyrhynchus 840
When you compare this excerpt to Matthew 23:25–27, the saying from
Oxyrhynchus 840 seems rather close to many of Jesus’s own teachings about
purity regulations (which Jesus often took issue with):
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of
the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside also
may become clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside look beautiful, but inside
they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth.
—Matthew 23:25–27
Oxyrhynchus 1224
Other fragments, such as Oxyrhynchus 1224, seem to be variations on known
Gospel traditions. In the following excerpt, the brackets indicate presumed
words filled in by Professor Elliott in his translation:
193
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

And the scribes and [Pharisees]
And priests, when they saw him
Were angry [that with]
Sinners in the midst he [reclined]
At table. But Jesus heard [it and said:]
The healthy do not need [the physician] . . .
—Oxyrhynchus 1224
Compare this excerpt to a passage from the Gospel of Matthew:
And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came
and were sitting with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they
said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and
sinners?” But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need
of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire
mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”
—Matthew 9:10–13
As you can see, the Oxyrhynchus 1224 selection is quite close to the known
Gospel tradition, suggesting that different versions of sayings of Jesus were
also circulating among early Christians.
The Egerton Papyri
In 1934, an Egyptian antiquities dealer sold a series of second-century CE
papyrus fragments to the British Museum. The source of these celebrated
documents, called the Egerton Papyri, is unknown.
The collection is generally dated between 100 and 150 CE and thus is one of
the oldest fragments of Jesus writings in possession. It doesn’t appear to
have any Gnostic tendencies, although historians continue to debate that
point. The Egerton Papyri contains a number of fascinating portions, including
the following debate between Jesus and other Jewish scholars:
. . . And Jesus said to the lawyers: “Punish every wrongdoer and
transgressor, and not me . . .”
Then, turning to the rulers of the people he said this word: “Search the
scriptures, in which you think you have life. It is they which bear witness to
me. Do not suppose that I have come to accuse you to my father. There is
one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have hoped.”
And they said: “We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for you, we do not
know, where you are from.”
194
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Jesus answered and said to them: “Now your unbelief is exposed to the one
who was witnessed to by him. If you had believed [in Moses] you would
have believed me, because he wrote to your fathers about me . . .”
—Egerton Papyri
The Egerton Papyri also records an unknown miracle:
“Why is the seed enclosed in the ground, the abundance buried? Hidden for
a short time, it will be immeasurable.” And when they were perplexed at the
strange question, Jesus, as he walked, stood on the banks of the River
Jordan, and stretching out his right hand, he filled it with seed and sowed it
upon the ground. And thereupon he poured sufficient water over it. And
looking at the ground before them, the fruit appeared . . .
—Egerton Papyri
Whole Writings That Contain 
Sayings of Jesus
When it comes to sayings of Jesus, fragments are just the beginning. Longer
works also exist, and it’s presumed that most if not all of these writings are in
possession. Of course, these are among the most spectacular writings about
Jesus from early Christianity precisely because of their size and the amount
of material. Don’t forget, however, that the fragments we consider in this chapter
(especially Egerton) are important because they’re old. The complete writings —
namely the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Judas — are available in versions
that aren’t nearly as old as the fragments. Both of these writings, however, are
clearly Gnostic in spirit. Note that the Gospel of Judas is much more deeply
Gnostic than the more famous Gospel of Thomas.
The Gospel of Thomas
Although in Chapter 12 we talk about the Gnostic writings found in 1945 in
Egypt at Nag Hammadi, we cover the second-century CE Gospel of Thomas in
this chapter because it’s perhaps the most important fuller writing about
Jesus that’s in possession outside of the biblical Gospels and because refer-
ences to Thomas are made even outside the Nag Hammadi Library.
195
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

The Gospel of Thomas gets scholars’ and historians’ juices flowing for a
number of reasons:
 It’s a lengthy work and therefore lends itself to serious study.
 It consists mostly of 114 sayings of Jesus with very little narrative
description of the life of Jesus (as is found in the canonical Gospels).
For decades, scholars have proposed that Matthew and Luke must have
used a collection of sayings of Jesus when they wrote their Gospels because
so many sayings of Jesus are the same word for word in both Gospels. Many
historians doubted that such a document (called “Q” for the German word
“quelle,” or in English, “source”) could have existed . . . until the Gospel of
Thomas was found! Note: We aren’t saying that Thomas is “Q.” In fact,
nobody is saying that. However, the very existence of an early collection of
sayings of Jesus like Thomas suggests that writings like this did exist, and
thus the possibility of “Q” is more likely.
 Many New Testament scholars believe that some of these sayings of
Jesus may well be genuine because of the work’s age. Origen was already
talking about a Gospel of Thomas in the second century CE! Just
because they ended up in a collection with other sayings that probably
aren’t genuine doesn’t mean the whole collection is worthless.
So, how do you tell the difference between the genuine sayings and the fabri-
cated ones? Now there’s a question for the scholars to argue about for years
and years . . . and years. Determining which sayings are authentic is tricky busi-
ness, of course, so two common criteria are applied to sayings-in-question:
 Does it sound like Jesus based on things Jesus taught?
 Does it sound like other things Jesus actually said?
The following sections discuss passages that obviously don’t meet these cri-
teria, passages that do, and passages that meet one but not the other.
Passages that are strange enough to obviously not be from Jesus
In some cases, it’s easy to tell that a saying is just made up. Consider the fol-
lowing examples from the Gospel of Thomas:
Jesus said, “Blessed is the lion which the man shall eat, so that the lion will
become man; and cursed is the man whom the lion shall eat, and the lion
will become man.”
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 7
The disciples said to Jesus, “Tell us which way our end will occur?” Jesus said,
“Have you indeed discovered the beginning, that you search for the end? In the
place where the beginning is, there the end will be. Blessed is he who will
stand at the beginning: he will know the end and he will not taste death.”
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 18
196
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Jesus saw some infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, “These children
who are being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom.” They said to
him, “If we are children shall we enter the kingdom?” Jesus said to them,
“When you make the two one, and when you make the inner as the outer and
the outer as the inner and the upper as the lower, and when you make the
male and female into a single one, so that the male is not male and the female
is not female, when you make eyes in place of an eye, and a hand in place of
a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, then you
shall enter the kingdom . . .”
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 22
Um, what was that again? Does the lion thing have something to do with the
persecution of Christians — with them being fed to lions in the Roman
Circus? And what the heck does “discovering the beginning” mean? And that
last one, Saying 22, is a real conundrum . . . and quite frankly, we don’t buy
for a minute that Jesus said any of these things!
Saying 7, about the lion and man, seems to make very little sense, and that’s
not typical of Jesus, who always explained his images rather well. The other
sayings are also just plain too cryptic — but they are typical of the Gnostic
movement’s love of strange and puzzling images. Because he taught simple
folk most of the time, Jesus was rarely this cryptic and unclear.
Sayings that sound like canonical Gospels and are probably genuine
Some of the sayings in Thomas, however, are very much like what is found in
the canonical Gospels. For example, this saying from Thomas expresses
much the same idea as the verse from Luke:
Jesus said, “Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find . . .”
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 2
So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find;
knock, and the door will be opened for you.
—Luke 11:9
Other sayings from the Gospel of Thomas are slightly different versions of
well-known parables in the canonical Gospels. In the case of the story of the
Sower, some New Testament scholars wonder if Thomas preserves a more
original form of the story that traces to Jesus himself:
Look, the Sower went out, took a handful [of seeds], and scattered [them].
Some fell on the road, and the birds came and gathered them. Others fell on
rock, and they did not take root in the soil and did not produce heads of
grain. Others fell on thorns and they choked the seeds and worms ate them.
And others fell on good soil, and it produced a good crop: it yielded sixty per
measure and one hundred twenty per measure . . .
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 9
197
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

If we were to ask what a Gnostic gospel’s interest would be in a genuine saying
of this kind, the answer is fairly straightforward: The Gnostics wanted to differ-
entiate between the people who truly understood Jesus’s message (namely, the
Gnostics!) and those who did not. So, even if it were genuine, any saying that
could be bent or interpreted toward the Gnostic frame of reference could still
serve a purpose!
Passages that sound like Jesus but have 
no parallel in the canonical Gospels
Some passages in the Gospel of Thomas have no parallel in the canonical
Gospels but sound very much like something Jesus would say.
Here’s a fascinating example: a parable about the Kingdom of God being unin-
tended goodness. In the canonical Gospels, Jesus speaks about doing right-
eousness even if nobody is watching; this seems to be the idea behind the
following story from Thomas:
Jesus said, “The Father’s imperial rule is like a woman who was carrying a
[jar] full of meal. While she was walking along a distant road, the handle of
the jar broke and the meal spilled behind her [along] the road. She didn’t
know it; she hadn’t noticed a problem. When she reached her house, she put
the jar down and discovered that it was empty.”
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 97
Now, the fact that the meaning of this parable is a bit hard to work out doesn’t
necessarily mean that Jesus didn’t say it. It may well simply refer to the idea
that people should live their lives so that they’re surprised by unusual things
happening as opposed to expecting unusual things or even living a good life
just for the rewards!
Consider a very unusual parable-like saying attributed to Jesus in the Gospel
of Thomas:
The Father’s Imperial rule is like a person who wanted to kill someone
powerful. While still at home he drew his sword and thrust it into the wall to
find out whether his hand would go in. Then he killed the powerful one.
—Gospel of Thomas, Saying 98
Frankly, the violence of this image is shocking and isn’t at all consistent with
the nonviolent teachings of Jesus. But it’s a parable — not an ethical exam-
ple. Jesus isn’t advocating violence but rather is advocating taking prepara-
tions and being ready for a task.
So, at first, you may be tempted to reject this saying. But think again: this
particular story uses a startling example, which, of course, is very much in char-
acter with Jesus. After all, Jesus uses serpents as a positive example, contrary
to Hebrew tradition (see Matthew 10:16, “. . . be wise as serpents . . .”), and he
198
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

speaks of servants being killed and cities destroyed as part of a parable (see
Matthew 22:1–7). Along these lines, then, many New Testament scholars
wonder if Saying 98 — without parallel in the canonical New Testament — is
nonetheless genuine.
The Gospel of Judas
The announcement of the discovery of the Gospel of Judas has generated a
flurry of interest over the past ten years. National Geographic sponsored a
major media event about this writing, complete with extensive publicity, a
television special, and books. However, the initial thrill has calmed down
rather significantly.
A number of people suggested that this was a “genuine” work, a genuine
gospel, and lots of people believed that the Judas is the one who wrote it.
Same name and all, right? Has to be him, right? Wrong.
The historical Judas did not write the Gospel of Judas. This document is actu-
ally a Gnostic writing from (probably) no earlier than the late second century
CE, and perhaps even later. As a Gnostic work, therefore, it has a great deal in
common with the Nag Hammadi manuscripts that are the subject of Chapter
12, but because it was found apart from the Nag Hammadi collection and
released only recently to public attention, we choose to briefly talk about it in
this chapter on early non-canonical traditions about Jesus.
This short work, the publication of which had all the intrigue of a modern
mystery novel, finally came to light in 2005 after a long series of secretive
negotiations and meetings. The actual contents of the book hardly justify
such excitement — the Gospel of Judas is a rather typical example of Gnostic
spirituality.
A typical Gnostic tract
The Gospel of Judas features many of the common traits of Gnostic
Christianity, including
 The notion that the Jewish God is a lower and somewhat malevolent god
compared to the “higher god” of Light who originally sent Jesus
 The rejection of the material world, including the significance of human
bodies
In keeping with these themes, the Gospel of Judas portrays Jesus as laughing
at the notion of the Eucharist! The meal, as an expression of the material
presence of God in the world, is depicted as honoring the wrong God — the
material God rather than the spiritual God of Light. This further suggests
some material connection in the Gnostics’ minds between the Eucharist, the
world, and God.
199
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

Furthermore, the Gospel of Judas highlights the Gnostic sense of elite knowl-
edge. Jesus rather crudely taunts the disciples: “Do you think you know me?”
Note the emphasis on knowledge; they think they know, but they do not. Not
surprisingly, the disciples react with some indignation at this abuse from
Jesus; note that their anger is seen in the Gospel of Judas as itself an indica-
tion of “lower understanding.”
Judas, the Jesus “insider”
In the Gospel of Judas, Jesus shows special treatment to Judas and privately
reveals information to him. Again, the theme of secrecy and privileged infor-
mation is typically Gnostic. In this gospel, the information given to Judas is a
series of meditations on the nature of the heavens and somewhat obscure
notions that are quite typical of the kind of esoteric, symbolic, and opaque
“spirituality” found in the Nag Hammadi texts (see Chapter 12).
Of particular interest is a series of “teachings” about the nature of God as the
first, ungenerated ground of all existence and how everything that exists is in
some form derived from God’s existence, either negatively by ignoring or dis-
obeying this god or positively as an emanation from this god. However, this
information seems a somewhat awkward addition to the story of Jesus, the
disciples, and Judas — an opportunity, if you will, to splice in Gnostic ideas.
In the end, astonishingly, Jesus praises Judas for betraying Jesus because
Judas’s act finally allows Jesus to be rid of his earthly prison — his earthly body:
But you [Judas] will excel all of them. For you will sacrifice the man that
clothes me . . .
—Gospel of Judas
Physical death leads to spiritual life, so Judas is a hero!
A serious reading of the Gospel of Judas is difficult because it seems altogether
taunting and abusive of Christian orthodoxy in its attempt to take the ultimate
“villain” in Christian tradition, Judas, and make of him a laudable, heroic figure.
The writing seems almost calculated to enrage non-Gnostic Christians. While
many historians argue that the Gospel of Judas is a pious work by a Gnostic
writer that reveals a very positive attitude toward Jesus, the depiction of
Jesus, much less Judas, is also rather disturbing.
Consider this example: In ancient manuscripts, laughter is rarely the reaction to
harmless amusement or enjoyment; rather, it’s typically a sign of ridicule (con-
sider Daniel laughing at Nebuchadnezzar in the story of Bel in the Deutero-
Canonical version of Daniel). To have Jesus ridiculing the twelve disciples with
malicious laughter is difficult to reconcile with a respectful attitude!

Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

The Gospel of Peter
The Gospel of Peter is an elaborate resurrection account referred to by Origen
in the second century and Eusebius in the fourth century. The actual docu-
ment, however, wasn’t discovered until 1886 in Egypt.
This second- or third-century CE work is virulently anti-Jewish and similar to
attitudes seen in early Christian writings like the Epistle of Barnabas (see
Chapter 14 for more on this work). This gospel transfers the blame for the
death of Jesus from the Romans (who were, after all, the ones really responsi-
ble) to Jewish opposition to Jesus.
The Gospel of Peter portrays the Resurrection of Jesus in grand fashion. This
text actually provides a description of how two angels sent down from God
opened the tomb of Jesus and how the soldiers guarding the tomb saw it all.
At that point, things start to get a bit strange:
. . . [the soldiers] saw three men come out from the sepulcher, two of them
supporting the other and a cross following them and the heads of the two
reaching to heaven, but that of him who was being led reached beyond the
heavens. And they heard a voice out of the heavens crying, “Have you
preached to those who sleep?” and from the cross there was heard the
answer, “Yes.”
—Gospel of Peter 10 (tr. Elliott, 156–157)
To recap, the angels brought Jesus out of his tomb, but their heads extended
up into the sky (not sure how that works, but anyway) . . . and a walking wooden
cross followed behind them and spoke. Right. We think it’s fair to say that the
Christians who are aware of this text are thrilled that this “gospel” wasn’t taken
seriously . . . but it does raise interesting questions as to why an early Christian
writer thought that this was important information.
The idea of the talking cross has especially fascinated modern scholars, who
wonder what this image is intended to communicate. Is a talking cross symbolic
of the death of Jesus as part of a cosmic plan, so that even the wooden cross
“knows” what’s happening? Does it suggest later traditions of a cross being a
site of an early Christian Oracle like the ancient Delphi Oracle? Symbolic scenes,
however, figure prominently in some Gnostic circles and certainly in apocalyptic
visions, so either tradition could have influenced this presentation.
In the mid-19th century, in the Mayan-populated area of the Yucatan Peninsula,
a group of Mayan peasants who rebelled against their European overlords
believed that they were led by God through a “talking cross” who spurred on
the revolutionaries. There’s no evidence that the ancient Christian Gospel of
Peter could have possibly influenced the Mayan phenomenon, but more than
one reference to a talking cross certainly is an interesting coincidence, isn’t it?
201
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

It’s highly unlikely that the Gospel of Peter adds anything to modern histori-
cal knowledge, but it certainly does add to the view of the variety of ideas cir-
culating among early Christians. Thankfully, the nasty attitude toward the
Jews that’s represented in this writing wasn’t made part of the New
Testament.
The Gospel of Bartholomew (Or “You sure
do ask a lot of questions, Bart!”)
The fourth-century CE early Christian theologian and translator of the Bible,
Jerome, mentions yet another gospel written under the name of another of
the disciples of Jesus, a Gospel of Bartholomew.
In their study of early non-canonical gospels, scholars point out that no docu-
ment under this name has survived, but the following available texts do fea-
ture the name “Bartholomew”:
 Questions of Bartholomew
 Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ by Bartholomew the Apostle
There’s no way of knowing if these other two writings have any connection
with what Jerome calls the Gospel of Bartholomew.
Questions of Bartholomew
The Questions of Bartholomew writing is precisely that: The disciple
Bartholomew asks Jesus a series of questions when the resurrected Jesus
reappears to the disciples after his crucifixion.
It’s easy to see why such Questions literature would arise: People had legiti-
mate questions about specific interpretations of some of the sayings of Jesus.
Following are a few of the more interesting selections from this work.
Bartholomew asks Jesus about his disappearing on the cross
Questions of Bartholomew contains some wondrous accounts. In the first
question, for example, Bartholomew tells Jesus that he watched the crucifixion
from a distance and saw that Jesus actually disappeared from the cross for a
while. Bartholomew wonders where he went! Jesus answers,
Blessed are you, Bartholomew, my beloved, because you saw this mystery,
and now I will tell you all things whatsoever you ask me . . .
—Questions of Bartholomew 1:8 (tr. Elliott, 655)
202
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Jesus describes how he went into Hades to free Adam and other entrapped
souls. (In other words, you may read this as a “reversal” of the curse of Adam’s
sin on humanity, a notion taken up by Paul in Romans 5:12.) Clearly, this task is
an expansion of the famous tradition that Jesus “descended into hell” upon his
physical death and did battle with Satan, and thus the Resurrection was not
only his defeat of his own death but the defeat of Satan and death in general.
These are themes already encountered in brief form in Paul’s New Testament
writings, but they’re considerably expanded in the Questions of Bartholomew.
Particularly provocative is Jesus’s comment that 30,000 people die every day.
When Bartholomew asks how many of this number are righteous, Jesus sadly
answers, “Hardly fifty-three!” Jesus also informs his disciple that 30,001 souls
are born every day — that is, one more than die every day.
Mary risks global Armageddon
Jesus wasn’t the only one bombarded with questions in this work. In the next
very strange section, the disciples ask Mary what it was like to have the child
Jesus formed within her. Surprisingly, she pleads with them that she not be
asked to describe this, but when the disciples insist, she asks them to surround
her and literally brace her on all sides to “hold her together,” lest the holiness
of what she is about to describe blow her apart! Just as she finishes the story,
Jesus suddenly appears and warns Mary not to finish the story or the world
will end! You can presume that there are some questions you won’t get
answers to . . . unless, of course, you don’t mind triggering the apocalypse.
Asking about sin, humanity, and judgment
After Jesus is back in the picture, the disciples want to ask him further questions.
What’s rather funny, however, is that everyone is so afraid to ask that they argue
with each other about who should do the asking! Peter, for example, tells Mary
that because she bore the child who reversed the curse of Adam and Eve, she
should ask. Mary fires back that Peter’s the one who Jesus put at the head of the
group, so he should ask. Meanwhile, Bartholomew steps up and asks the questions.
Bartholomew’s questions concern
 The nature of hell and judgment
 The nature of the creation of humanity
 The nature of specific sins
Asking about the unforgivable sin
In a final series of questions, Bartholomew asks Jesus about the famous
“unforgivable sin.” This draws on the Gospel tradition of Mark in which Jesus
states, “. . . but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have
forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin” (Mark 3:29). Jesus’s clarification to
Bartholomew is quite startling:
203
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

Whosoever shall decree against any man who has served my holy Father
has blasphemed against the Holy Ghost. Every man who serves God with
reverence is worthy of the Holy Ghost, and he who speaks anything evil
against him shall not be forgiven!
—Questions of Bartholomew 5:4 (tr. Elliott, 667)
It seems that persecution of Christians is what’s intended here: Because
every Christian is worthy of the Holy Spirit, attacking Christians is also
attacking the Spirit within them. This is a very interesting interpretation, to
say the least.
Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ
The related Bartholomew work known as the Book of the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ is actually a combination of a series of episodes, all dealing with
appearances of Jesus after his resurrection. Here’s a recap of four episodes:
 In an opening sequence that flashes back to before the crucifixion, one
of the disciples brings a chicken to the table and relates how some Jews
told him that when the chicken was killed, Jesus would bleed and die
just like the chicken! And what’s Jesus’s response to this? He says, “It is
true,” and proceeds to bring the chicken back to life, after which it flies
away. Many historians consider this episode a prediction of the death
and resurrection of Jesus.
 Jesus is visited in his tomb by demonic figures who are shocked to find him
alive, and thereafter, Jesus goes to hell and releases all the souls but three:
• Herod
• Cain
• Judas (and Jesus apparently scolds Judas)
 A gardener describes Jesus’s resurrection to nine women who have
come to visit the Tomb of Jesus, and then Jesus appears to them on a
fiery chariot.
 Thomas raises his own son to life after seven days of death, and the boy
describes the scenes that he saw in heaven, including 12 seats in heaven
reserved for the Apostles. This episode elaborates on the tradition of
“doubting Thomas,” the story of the Apostle Thomas, who refused to
accept that Jesus had risen from the dead and demanded to feel his
wounds as proof (see John 20).
These writings attributed to Bartholomew have clear parallels with apocalyptic
visionary material seen in both Jewish and other early Christian writings, and
they’re particularly similar to the much more popular writing the Shepherd of
Hermas (see Chapter 13 for details on Hermas).
204
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

Writings on the Death of Jesus
Other writings purport to add to the knowledge of the events leading up to,
and after, the death of Jesus. Among these are documents in which Pilate
plays a significant part. One of these documents has actually been called the
Acts of Pilate; it’s the first part of the Gospel of Nicodemus. The Acts of Pilate
is collected with other writings including Christ’s Descent into Hell (which is
the second part of the Gospel of Nicodemus), a series of letters from an
alleged correspondence between Pilate and Herod, and other letters from
Pilate to other Roman officials.
The Acts of Pilate, or the Gospel 
of Nicodemus
In the writing known as the Acts of Pilate, Nicodemus is a pious Jew who attempts
to defend Jesus and then investigates the events of the resurrection after Jesus’s
death.
The resurrected Jesus also appears to Nicodemus. The work begins with the
known canonical Gospel accounts of the trial, death, and resurrection of
Jesus, but then it expands far beyond the basic information in the Gospels
and provides some fascinating details.
When Jesus first walks into the presence of Pilate, the Roman Standards (the
eaglelike symbols held on poles) bow before Jesus, angering Pilate because
he thinks that some of his soldiers either are playing games or are secret
admirers of Jesus. When Pilate orders stronger soldiers to hold the stan-
dards, the images atop the standards bow once again when Jesus enters. This
is a charming detail — with perhaps some political implications.
The book features some rather nasty debates between Jesus, Pilate, and the
Jewish Elders that surely summarize some of the real debates between
Christians and Jews throughout the first centuries of Christianity. The
debates include what were probably common accusations faced by early
Christians, including claims that
 Jesus was an illegitimate child.
 Jesus was a sorcerer.
 Jesus’s family fled to Egypt because they were driven out by their neighbors
rather than because of God’s protection.
205
Chapter 11: Lost Gospels and Sayings of Jesus

Pilate hears a number of testimonials by those who were healed or exorcised
of demons, but Jewish crowds overrule them and insist on the crucifixion of
Jesus. Throughout the actual trial, Pilate protests Jesus’s innocence and tells
the Jewish speakers to deal with Jesus in their own way. The crucifixion, how-
ever, carries on as stated in the Gospels, with some expansions of the story,
including an extended discussion of Joseph of Arimathea, who donated a
tomb for the body of Jesus.
The main expansion of the traditional story, however, takes place after the
crucifixion. The Acts of Pilate features an extended investigation by priestly
Jewish leaders, who attempt to learn the fate of Jesus because of the empty
tomb. The risen Jesus, however, appears to many, including Joseph of
Arimathea, and eventually many of the Jewish leaders come to recognize the
true identity of Jesus.
Christ’s Descent into Hell
Christ’s Descent into Hell is a dramatic presentation of Jesus storming the
gates of Hades, defeating the attempts of Satan and Hades (here presented as
two different characters) to keep Jesus out.
Jesus comes to hell and releases all the people who were trapped there
because of Adam’s original sin (including many historic figures of the Old
Testament and Adam himself, who has a prominent part in the story). In one
version of Christ’s Descent, a cross is planted in hell to serve as a powerful
symbol of Christ’s defeat of death and sin.
The general description of Christ’s entry into hell is very similar to elements
of the Questions of Bartholomew (see the earlier section), suggesting that
both draw from popular early Christian folklore surrounding the canonical
descriptions of the death and resurrection of Jesus.
Brief letters and correspondence of Pilate
A number of short works purporting to be letters sent by Pilate to other officials
suggest that Pilate wasn’t a willing participant in the crucifixion of Jesus and
generally exonerate the entire Roman Empire. Indeed, in one of these letters,
Caesar is angry at “the Jews” for the crucifixion of Jesus and commands serious
retribution.
206
Part III: Lost Books about Jesus 

In general, the tone of the Pilate materials is polemic, accusatory, and clearly
anti-Semitic. Furthermore, the positive depiction of the Roman Empire is
quite likely to reflect the period after 313 CE when Constantine started the
process that led to the Roman Empire itself becoming Christian. That is to
say, anti-Semitism during the period when Christians held the power of govern-
ment — the Roman Empire — was seriously deadly for Jewish communities
who chose not to be converts. For many Jews after the seventh to eighth cen-
turies, the Islamic world afforded at least some level of security and protec-
tion when persecution was a serious danger in the Christian world. Writings
like the Pilate materials show how religious propaganda can be used to stir
up hatred and animosity.

Christian Books

In this part . . .
T
he New Testament isn’t just about Jesus. One of the
most important books for Christianity is a “history
book” called the Acts of the Apostles that tells some of the
stories of early followers of Jesus like Stephen, Peter, and
Paul (and Mary, for that matter). St. Paul, of course,
became one of the most influential early Christians, and
many of his letters became so popular that they were in
the New Testament. But other stories were written about
Paul, Peter, Mary, and even some of the other disciples
that no one hears much about at all — Andrew and
Thomas, for example.
In this part, we explore many of these early Christian writ-
ings that talk about early Christian leaders. Again, there
are lots of entertaining legends and a few disturbing ideas,
but altogether it’s fascinating reading. We also introduce
you to Christian legends, early visions, and adventures
that aren’t for the faint of heart. We summarize all these

Chapter 12
The Gnostic Christian Writings
In This Chapter
 Defining Gnostic Christianity
 Recapping writings from the Nag Hammadi Library
 Tying together Gnostic and Orthodox Christianity
W
e use the word “esoteric” a lot in this chapter. From the Greek 
meaning “inner,” it refers to ideas that are difficult or impossible to
understand for “outsiders” because these ideas are described in images or
language that’s meaningful only for those initiated into the mysteries or
secrets. There can be esoteric symbols and drawings (like Masonic symbols
or those of other secret clubs) or esoteric writings (like the stuff we look 
at in this chapter).
Many Gnostic writings are almost completely esoteric, and some of these
writings use language, terms, names, and ideas so totally strange as to 
defy modern understanding. Happily, however, some of the writings can be
worked out enough to reveal at least some of what the writers were thinking,
and that’s what we tackle in this chapter. In doing so, we draw on the English
translations edited by James Robinson (The Nag Hammadi Library) and also
Bentley Layton (The Gnostic Scriptures). See the appendix for both sources.
In this chapter, we conduct a survey of Gnostic Christian writings. Gnosticism
was an early Christian “heresy” that was attacked and debated by the early
Christians, whose views emerged as “orthodox Christianity.” Therefore, none
of these writings were ever considered for inclusion in the New Testament,
even though the Gnostic Christians obviously treasured them!
Some of these writings have been known for some time, whereas others were
more recently discovered in the spectacular find in Egypt at the place known
as “Nag Hammadi,” and so they’re referred to as the Nag Hammadi Library.
Because of this discovery, much more is known about early Gnostic Christian
thought — but not as much as scholars and historians would like to know!
(You’ll see what we mean as you read on.)

Understanding Gnostic Christianity
“Gnosis” is a Greek term that means “knowledge.” So, a Gnostic would be
someone with knowledge. Simple, right? Not so fast. Historically, the term
“Gnostic” is most often used specifically to refer to an ancient religious 
movement that began probably early in the second century CE, if not earlier.
Modern historians refer to this movement as Gnosticism (although it isn’t the
term the ancient Gnostics used for themselves).
Some ancient Gnostics were interested in Christianity, and it’s also probably
the case that some early Christians were impressed with a Gnostic way of
understanding Christianity.
Gnostic Christianity can be described as a form of Christianity concerned
with typically Gnostic themes, particularly
 The nature of spiritual reality
 The origin of the spiritual beings
 The origins and fate of the human soul
 The meaning of Jesus
 The nature of salvation
However, it seems quite clear that Gnostic Christianity dwelt on ideas that
were either very minor in other forms of Christianity (like the true nature 
of the creation of the world — not a huge theme in the New Testament) 
or even openly hostile to ideas in other forms of Christianity (for example,
Gnosticism did not like the New Testament emphasis on the physical 
suffering and bodily resurrection of Jesus).
What Gnostic Christians 
believed, in a nutshell
All Gnostics, whether Christian or not, were interested in the origins of the
world and also in understanding the origins of good and evil. In the Christian
Gnostic cosmology (a system of beliefs about what exists), we can identify
some basic ideas common to all Christian Gnostic literature.
Being of light
Christian Gnostics believed in an all-knowing, entirely independent being of
light, the origin of everything, who wasn’t created but always was. This
“being” existed before anything or anyone else. Everything that now exists is,
212
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

in some way, derived from this first perfect being that the Gnostics call by
many different names: divine source, omnipotent one, the “ineffable” . . . you
get the idea. This being is purely good.
A created second being
The original being gave rise to a second being, although Gnostic writings
never quite explain why. Think of this concept in terms of amending the
famous line from the philosopher Descartes, “I think, therefore I am”; for
Gnostics, it’s “He thought, therefore others came about.”
Gnostics sometimes call this second being after pure perfection “Barbelo,” a
name that some speculate is formed by Coptic terms for “projectile” (thus
one “emitted” from the oneness) or, some suggest, the Hebrew terms for “god
in four” (“b” = “in” + “arba” = 4 + “El” = god).
Although Gnostics usually refer to this second being as male, they occasion-
ally use feminine terms. This second being then expanded into additional
beings, most importantly the personified Wisdom, usually called by the Greek
term for “wisdom,” Sophia. She’s often described as a feminine being growing
out of the thought of the unknown and unknowable god of light. Different
Gnostic texts go into intricate detail on the number of “beings” that were gen-
erated at this stage after Barbelo, speculating that it was 365 for every day of
the year, or perhaps 70. Sometimes these beings appear to embody certain
traits — good ones like wisdom, happiness, and courage; or bad ones like
jealousy and hatred.
Making of matter
For Gnostics, following the creation of the second being and subsequent
beings is the stage involving the creation of the material universe — that is,
the one we experience every day. This involves the creation of a being almost
always called by the name “Yaldaboath.”
This being is considered a lesser being, and in many Gnostic myths, this
lesser being creates the known world with flaws. Why? Because the being 
is flawed. Where do these flaws come from? Why is there evil in the world?
There are various, strange explanations for how evil could come from an 
originally pure good, but philosophers have been beating their heads on that
one for centuries. In their writings, the Gnostics seem to answer that evil 
was made by Sophia, a lesser power, as a rebellious act apart from the higher
god’s permission. This Yaldaboath is usually pictured as trying to convince
humans that he’s the true god because he initiated the physical creation 
(but not the spiritual, inward part of humanity).
Making of man
In Gnostic writings, the creation of humanity is a special case. Although 
they are material beings, Sophia (or other beings in some versions) attempts
to take away (or perhaps balance) the powers of Yaldaboath, so she gives
213
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

humans a “piece” of pureness even though they’re tainted by being creatures
in this lesser, material universe. But Yaldaboath strikes back by convincing
these humans that he, in fact, is their god, not the original God of light and
goodness.
You can see the lines drawn from a kind of spiritual battle in history as the
forces of good struggle over humanity against the forces of evil.
How Gnostic beliefs clashed with 
traditional Jewish and Christian beliefs
Okay, we admit it: The Christian Gnostic cosmology all sounds totally 
bizarre. But there are some rather startling implications to it all; here are 
the highlights:
 Many Gnostic Christians believed that the “Jewish God” was precisely
Yaldaboath: the lesser, even evil, being that sought to fool humans
into believing that he was, in fact, their god. Thus, Gnostic Christians
tended to deny the significance of the entire Jewish tradition for their
own faith and practice, or at least interpret it according to their 
own ideas!
 Because the Gnostics believed that the material world was the result
of a lesser god, material things weren’t important — even material
bodies weren’t important. They believed that they would be free upon
death to regain their true spiritual nature and rejoin the spiritual world
of good.
 In general, ethical practices that tended to value material issues of
care and concern for bodies were a very minor concern. There is,
quite frankly, very little ethical instruction in Gnostic literature, although
to be fair, it isn’t entirely absent.
 Because the physical body was part of the unimportant world, sexual
pleasure and sexual procreation were usually seen as corrupting,
although not always flatly condemned. In short, the material world was
rejected in favor of spending time speculating on a heavenly world and
awaiting one’s freedom to reunify with the God of light and goodness.
In Gnostic Christianity, Jesus is the great informer or messenger. He’s the one
sent from the higher light to inform humans of their true inward nature and
their intended destiny to escape the material universe and rejoin the forces
of light and good. In all Gnostic literature, Jesus begins as a pre-existent being
who “takes on” the form of material humans. But most Gnostic scriptures
deny that Jesus was truly physical or really suffered. Gnostic Christians
214
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

believed that people could be saved by knowledge of the truth and by know-
ing who they were. Thus, you’re no longer “asleep” in the material world.
This is why most of these writings consist of attempts to teach or inform the
reader about “the truth.”
Gnostic Writings Galore: The Nag
Hammadi Library
After the Dead Sea Scrolls of 1948–1952, one of the most dramatic discoveries
of the 20th century is easily the discovery of the Christian Gnostic writings at
Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. Included in this discovery were 13 bundles of
texts in varying condition from excellent to very fragmentary. There are some
45 different documents in the Nag Hammadi collection, virtually all of them
Gnostic in the sense that they’re either overtly Gnostic or lend themselves to
Gnostic interpretation.
The language of the Nag Hammadi manuscripts is Coptic, the ancient written
language of the Egyptians. It’s clear that virtually all these writings, however,
are translations from Greek. Historians debate where they came from: Were
they buried by an ancient monk because the writings would otherwise have
been burned? They were found near the location of ancient monasteries, so
most historians think that early Christian monks must have had something to
do with these writings.
In this chapter, we don’t take time with the Gnostic writings from Nag
Hammadi that aren’t clearly Christian; instead, we focus on the most notable
Christian writings. Some of the writings (including a fragment from Plato)
have no Christian connection whatsoever, while others are only mildly
Christian (perhaps featuring a brief insertion here and there into what’s 
otherwise clearly a non-Christian work).
Most of these writings clearly have Gnostic philosophy at the heart of their
argument. As we indicate, Gnosticism was rejected as denying orthodox
beliefs about the Old Testament and the physical nature of Jesus and his 
existence and suffering. Gnosticism appears to have promoted some rather
strict ascetic tendencies that supported a denial of the importance of the
physical, either in physical care for other persons’ needs for food and shelter
or in positive views of sexuality and family life. There are exceptions to these
generalizations, of course, but they are exceptions.
These writings are typically so difficult to understand and are written with
such strange imagery using such bizarre language that it’s often impossible
to be certain that you really do understand what they’re talking about!
215
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

Although historians and scholars find these writings interesting, sometimes
inspiring (like The Sentences of Sextus), and occasionally entertaining 
(coauthor Daniel is quite fond of The Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles),
their value is in revealing the diversity of early Christian ideas — even the
weird ones!
Although it may be dangerous to propose an “organization” for books that
are inherently difficult to understand, in this chapter we propose to examine
the Gnostic writings by the general subjects they address. If they speak
mostly of the Gnostic ideas of Creation, or about Jesus, then we group them
accordingly. We hope this makes this survey a bit easier to work through.
Many of these writings present different versions of the same kind of mater-
ial, namely a recitation of the Gnostic ideas about the creation of all things
from the one, uncreated God, the present state of many beings, the material
universe, and the spiritual conflicts within the cosmos.
Questions for Jesus
One interesting form of Gnostic Christian writing is what we might call
“Questions for Jesus.” Although the specific ways that Jesus shows up to 
talk with disciples may vary, the point seems to be the same in each case: an
opportunity to quiz Jesus on matters of concern to Gnostic spirituality. Of
course, this scenario is also a rather effective tool for promoting Gnostic
ideas by assigning them to Jesus, now isn’t it?
The Apocryphon of James
The Apocryphon of James, from around 150–200 CE, exemplifies the “question
time” genre of Gnostic writing.
According to the writing, 50 days after the Resurrection, James and Peter ask
the risen Jesus a number of questions about the nature of the universe and
especially about what happens after death. Jesus tells them not to fear death:
“Scorn death, therefore, and take thought for life! Remember my cross and
my death, and you will live!” (Apocryphon of James 5:30-35, ed. Robinson, 32).
This work, which features an unusually large amount of understandable lan-
guage, even contains variations on parable forms, though the message of the
parable isn’t immediately obvious:
. . . the kingdom of heaven is like an ear of grain after it had sprouted in a
field. And when it has ripened, it scattered its fruit and again filled the field
with ears for another year. You also, hasten to reap an ear of life for
yourselves that you may be filled with the kingdom . . .
—Apocryphon of James 12:20-25 (ed. Robinson, 35)
216
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Probably because so much of it is rather clear in its meaning, the
Apocryphon is often considered “mildly” Gnostic, but it still features typical
aspects of Gnostic portrayals of Jesus — such as Jesus getting irritated with
so many questions and apparently getting impatient with his disciples!
The Apocryphon of John
The Apocryphon of John is a pre-185 CE work that’s another of the
“Questions” writings, this time dealing with the origins of evil and how
humans are to escape evil.
After John prays for information, a multiple being appears as young, old, and
a servant, apparently all at once. This being, intended to be Jesus in various
forms, proceeds to explain Gnostic cosmology: God as the monad (unitary
one) and the creation of the secondary beings Barbelo and a feminine being.
This feminine being’s desire to conceive of a thought from herself results 
in the creation of Yaldaboath, the first archon (creator), who then starts 
to create other beings. In a fascinating extended discussion of the creation 
of humanity, this writing lists many different beings — each given strange
names — who contribute parts of the body of Adam. Here are a few 
examples:
 Bano created the lungs.
 Sostrapal created the liver.
 Anesimalar created the spleen.
But it’s the feminine mother being who gives Adam the power of life and thus
the part of good that’s in humanity. Referring to elements of the Genesis sto-
ries, the Apocryphon describes Adam’s son Seth as the one chosen to receive
Adam’s information about all this creation, but Seth’s wisdom is forgotten
until Jesus comes to restore the truth.
The prominence of Seth in some of these writings has led many to believe
that there was a separate Gnostic group, called Sethites, who valued the 
spiritual being called Seth very highly and sometimes, it seems, identified
him with Jesus.
The Book of Thomas the Contender
In the Book of Thomas the Contender, which is estimated to be from around
200–250 CE but certainly before 350 CE, numerous sayings of Jesus are 
clearly modeled on the canonical Gospels but are deeply Gnostic in tone. 
For example, Jesus is portrayed as very much against any sensuality or 
sexuality, a common ascetic, anti-material, “anti-physical bodies” theme in
Gnostic writing:
217
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

Woe to you who love intimacy with womankind and polluted intercourse
with them!
Woe to you in the grip of the powers of your body for they will afflict you
Woe to you in the grip of the forces of evil demons . . .
. . . For when you come forth from the sufferings and passions of the body,
you will receive rest from the good one, and you will reign with the kind,
you joined with him and he with you, from now on, for ever and ever Amen.
—Book of Thomas the Contender 143 (tr. Turner, ed. Robinson, 205)
This work models itself on the style of much of Jesus’s actual teaching, espe-
cially the typical Wisdom-style of teaching that contrasts the behavior of the
wise with that of the foolish and the use of “woes” like Prophetic literature
from the Old Testament.
The First Apocalypse of James and the Second Apocalypse of James
There are two roughly 100–150 CE Apocalypse of James writings in the Nag
Hammadi collection, and they both appear to be discussions between Jesus
and his brother James, who was, in fact, historically the first leader of the
Jerusalem Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus.
In the First Apocalypse of James, however, James questions Jesus about his
own fate, and Jesus explains how James will die as a martyr. Along the way,
James takes the opportunity to question Jesus on matters of Gnostic interest,
such as the number of spiritual beings created at certain times in the 
cosmic order:
James said, “Rabbi, are there then twelve hebdomads and now seven as
there are in the scriptures?” The Lord said, “James, he who spoke
concerning this scripture had limited understanding. I, however, shall reveal
to you what has come forth from him who has no number. I shall give a sign
concerning their number.”
—First Apocalypse of James 26 (tr. Schoedel, ed. Robinson, 262)
The Second Apocalypse of James shows Jesus trying to comfort James as he
faces further details about his suffering and martyrdom. James is finally mar-
tyred by being thrown from the Temple and, after he survived the fall, being
buried up to his waist and stoned to death. The work ends with James utter-
ing a prayer as he dies, asking to be delivered from his body but judged as a
good man.
The Apocalypse of Peter
The Apocalypse of Peter, from around 200–300 CE, claims to be an explanation
of the true nature of spiritual mysteries that Jesus gave to Peter. Along the
way, however, you notice serious signs of conflict between the writers (and
readers) of this work and the group of Christians who later come to be
Orthodox Christians. One can hear the arguments in the following passage:
218
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

And there shall be others of those who are outside out number who name
themselves bishop and also deacons as if they have received their authority
from God. They bend themselves under the judgment of the leaders. Those
people are dry canals . . .
—Apocalypse of Peter, 79-80 (tr. Brashler, ed. Robinson, 376)
And Jesus offers advice about waiting for them to fall:
The Saviour said, “For a time determined for them in proportion to their
error they will rule over the little ones. And after the completion of their
error, the never-aging one of the immortal understanding shall become
young, and they (the little ones) shall rule over those who are their rulers.
The root of their error he shall pluck out, and he shall put it to shame to that
it shall be manifest in all the impudence which it has assumed to itself.”
—Apocalypse of Peter 80 (ed. Robinson, 376)
Finally, among the interesting ideas about Jesus, Peter is given to understand
that the true Jesus never really suffered but rather watched and laughed as
the “fleshy part” was nailed to the cross:
The Saviour said to me, “He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing,
this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and feet they drive the
nails is his fleshly part, which is the substitute being put to shame, the one
who came into being in his likeness. But look at him and me.”
—Apocalypse of Peter 81 (ed. Robinson, 377)
The Gospel of Mary
The Gospel of Mary, a 200 CE or later work, has generated considerable inter-
est because of the prominence of Mary Magdalene and her portrayal as
among the leaders of the early Christian movement. She even teaches some
of the other disciples based on specific instructions given to her. This frag-
mentary document is quite interesting in its details.
As the work begins, Jesus is explaining some matters to the disciples, with
Peter asking one final question about sin in the world. Jesus gives a rather
brief and truncated version of the origin of darkness in the world in mildly
Gnostic terms and then proceeds to say his goodbyes. After he leaves, 
Peter and the other men are afraid, saying that they killed Jesus, so there’s
nothing to stop people from killing them also! Mary steps up and encourages
everyone:
Do not weep and do not grieve nor be irresolute, for his grace will be
entirely with you and will protect you. But rather let us praise his greatness
for he has prepared us and made us into men. When Mary said this, she
turned their hearts to the Good . . .
—Gospel of Mary 9 (tr. Macrae and Wilson, ed. Robinson, 525)
219
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

Peter, understanding that Mary has some important ideas to teach, asks her
to tell them what Jesus taught her. She agrees, but the text appears to be
broken, and when it picks up again, Mary appears to be well into a detailed
description of a soul experiencing many levels of heaven as it travels. As the
soul passes a kind of test at each level, it travels to the next level and learns
something new. At the fourth level, seven different forms are perceived. This
excerpt shows the esoteric nature of this teaching:
The first form is darkness, the second desire, the third ignorance, the fourth
is the excitement of death, the fifth is the kingdom of the flesh, the sixth is
the foolish wisdom of flesh, the seventh is the wrathful wisdom . . .
—Gospel of Mary 16 (ed. Robinson, 526)
When the soul announces that it has conquered these things (perhaps
through the power of Jesus), it is released to the rest of time, and apparently
reunifies with God, or is “silent.”
At the apparent end of Mary’s teaching, Andrew doesn’t believe her and says
that he doesn’t think Jesus said these things because they’re strange ideas.
We have to admit that we’re with Andrew on this, but in the writing, Peter
also begins to doubt and wonders if Jesus really spoke to a woman without
their knowledge. They even appear a bit jealous.
At this confrontation, Mary begins to cry and asks if they think she’s lying to
them. The disciple Levi steps up to defend her against Peter and complains
that Peter is always so hotheaded:
. . . But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her?
Surely the Savior knows her very well. That is why he loved her more than
us. Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect man and acquire him
for ourselves as he commanded us, and preach the gospel, not laying down
any other rule or other law beyond what the Savior said . . .
—Gospel of Mary 18 (ed. Robinson, 527)
This rather staunch defense of the leadership of a woman among the early
Christians is obviously a sentiment of keen interest to feminist scholars and
others interested in the issue of early Christian women in leadership within
early Christianity. Even people not particularly interested in Gnostic spiritual-
ity see in this document at least some evidence of debates about the leader-
ship of women in the early movement, suggesting that in some parts of the
early Christian world, women most certainly were in leadership until they
were suppressed in later Christian practice.
The Letter of Peter to Philip
In this roughly 190–250 CE work, Peter writes to the Apostle Philip, asking
him to come to visit. Philip gladly comes, and when he arrives, Peter takes
him and others to the Mount of Olives (just outside Jerusalem), where 
220
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

they pray for protection from persecution. A great light appears, and Jesus
manifests, asking why they’re praying when Jesus already promised that he
would be with them forever.
In true Gnostic fashion, however, the disciples decide to ask Jesus some
questions (rather like, “So, now that you’re here . . . can we ask a few things
we forgot about before?”). They ask, “Lord, we should like to know the 
deficiency of the aeons and their pleroma” — translation: we want to know
how evil began, and how things are going to end!
Jesus repeats many of the expected aspects of Gnostic cosmology in a (mer-
cifully) rather brief response. Peter is thrilled with the reassurances about
the cosmos and also the end of time, and he enthusiastically preaches to his
fellow disciples that although it appeared Jesus suffered and died, “My broth-
ers, Jesus is a stranger to this suffering, but we are the ones who have suf-
fered through the transgression of the mother.” In other words, humans will
have to suffer to rid themselves of their material bodies, but now that they
know this, they can perform wonders in the world as they await their deaths.
Eugnostos the Blessed and the Sophia of Jesus Christ
Eugnostos the Blessed and the Sophia of Jesus Christ are an interesting combi-
nation of texts from around 100–150 CE. They’re printed together in some
English editions for a very good reason: Eugnostos is copied and expanded
by the Sophia of Jesus Christ.
This pairing provides the very unusual opportunity to see how an ancient
Gnostic Christian writer basically cribbed from one work and made it
Christian by inserting Jesus answering questions posed by his disciples.
Most of the things that Jesus says, however, are clearly copied directly from
the first work! The subject of the discussions appears to be a rehearsal of the
same cosmic origin myths of God, the emergence of Sophia, and the creation
and significance of humanity.
Gnostic ideas on Jesus
Another form of Gnostic literature is a narrative about the nature, identity,
and work of Jesus. This isn’t written as if Jesus is speaking but rather is a nar-
rative description. As such, the writings in this category are a kind of sermon,
and in fact, some of them may have been Gnostic sermons or teachings
shared in some kind of gathering.
The Tripartite Tractate
The Tripartite Tractate is a longer Gnostic writing than many that we cover in
this chapter. From around 200–250 CE, it’s a response to critics on Gnostic
ideals and thus tries to explain Gnostic beliefs. Don’t start thinking it’s an
221
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

easily read work, though. The Tractate is deeply esoteric in tone and in its
use of symbols and language. For example, God is described as unknowable
by humans
. . . because of his inscrutable greatness and his incomprehensible depth,
and his immeasurable light, and his illimitable will. This is the nature of the
unbegotten one . . .
—Tripartite Tractate 54 (tr. Attridge and Mueller, ed. Robinson, 62)
As in typical Gnostic cosmology, the “Logos” (like “Sophia” in other Gnostic
forms; this refers to “a created second being”) falls short and creates lesser
beings. As a result, in the good creation of Jesus and the Church, Logos turns
away from its fallen state and assists in the redemption of creation.
The nature of Jesus is described as a good being who “. . . let himself be 
conceived and born as an infant, in body and soul.” Even the disciples are
described here as from God. However, the ultimate desire of humanity is
reunification with God:
When the redemption was proclaimed the perfect man received knowledge
immediately, so as to return in haste to his unitary state, to return there
joyfully, to the place from which he came to the place from which he 
flowed forth.
—Tripartite Tractate 123 (ed. Robinson, 96-97)
The Gospel of Philip
Professor Isenberg, one of the translators we consulted for the Nag Hammadi
works, suggests that the roughly 250–300 CE Gospel of Philip may contain 
a series of sacramental songs and poems, but otherwise, the book seems
somewhat disorganized.
Despite its lack of organization, it’s among the more entertaining of the Nag
Hammadi writings because most of it seems rather clear and understandable.
That doesn’t mean, however, that some of its ideas aren’t strange! In this writ-
ing, readers discover that Christ voluntarily laid down his life from the very
day the world came into being:
Then he came first in order to take it, since it had been given as a pledge. It
fell into the hands of robbers and was taken captive, but he saved it . . .
—Gospel of Philip 53:10 (tr. Isenberg, ed. Robinson, 142)
This gospel denies some basic orthodox Christian ideas; following are two
examples:
222
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

 The virgin birth of Jesus is denied by engaging in rather questionable
reasoning that Jesus, in Matthew 16:17, identifies another father: “Jesus
replied, ‘Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed
to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.’” The writer asks why Jesus
would identify another as his “father” unless there was already an
earthly one.
 The work contends that water baptism isn’t considered “real” because
spiritual baptism is the really authentic and meaningful form of baptism.
There are also some rather strange sayings of Jesus rendered in a Gnostic 
orientation, such as, “Blessed is he who is before he came into being. For he
who is, has been, and shall be. . . .” For more unusual sayings attributed to
Jesus, turn to Chapter 11.
Finally, the Gospel of Philip suggests that the cross of Jesus was made from a
tree that Joseph planted, but oil for christening (perhaps used in a Gnostic
Christian ritual) comes from the olive tree, described as a “Tree of Life.” This
christening ceremony seems to be a rite or ritual that’s more highly valued
than baptism and is mentioned in a few other Gnostic works.
As in other Gnostic writings, the Gospel of Philip also refers to the “Bridal
Chamber.” This is a very interesting Gnostic idea: As husband and wife
become one in the act of making love in a literal Bridal Chamber, this image is
used to refer to humanity regaining their unity with God. Thus the Bridal
Chamber becomes a popular Gnostic image for reunified spiritual persons.
Lest you think something literally sexual is implied here, it’s worth pointing
out that Gnostic writings contrast this spiritual union to physical sexual
intercourse, which is considered evil and lustful.
Finally, this gospel contains some of the sneering judgmentalism that we refer
to earlier as characteristic of Gnosticism: There are many kinds of people, 
the writer says, and some will never understand the truth. Thus, the Gospel
of Philip portrays Jesus using the image of different animals and then 
explaining:
There are many animals in the world which are in human form. When he
(God) identifies them, to the swine he will throw acorns, to the cattle he will
throw barley, and chaff and grass, to the dogs he will throw bones. To the
slaves he will give only elementary lessons, to the children he will give the
complete instruction.
—Gospel of Philip 81 (ed. Robinson, 157)
The point here is painfully obvious: Some people are little better than swine,
who get only acorns; or cattle, who get only barley; and so forth. The true
“children of God” (that is, of course, the Gnostics) are the only ones who will
get the truth. It’s little wonder that some historians accuse the Gnostics of
elitism and arrogance.
223
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

Dialogue of the Saviour
In the Dialogue of the Saviour, from around 150–200 CE, Jesus purports to give
the disciples (and Mary) some important information. Although portions of
the text are missing, enough remains to appreciate the general tone of the
work. Knowing the truth is compared to knowing the source, the origin, the
“root,” which ties to the Gnostic emphasis on knowing the origins of the
cosmos and spiritual reality, as you see in this excerpt:
If [one] does not [understand how] fire came into existence, he will burn in
it, because he does not know the root of it. If one does not first understand
water, he knows nothing. For what use is there for his to be baptized in it? If
one does not understand how blowing wind came into existence, he will
blow away with it. If one does not understand how body, which he bears,
came into existence, he will perish with it . . .
—Dialogue of the Saviour 134 (tr. Koester and Pagels, ed. Robinson, 250)
Gnostic ideas on creation
As we said earlier in this chapter, how the world came to be is central to
Gnostic ideas. It was the creation of the lesser god and that god’s creation 
of this world that caused the whole mess we’re in now, according to the
Gnostics. So, they explain the creation — and refer to it — again and again in
their own idiosyncratic ways. The basic story is the same: Jesus came to
solve problems that started with the very beginning of the cosmos. Put that
way, it does sound like Paul’s ideas about the fallen Creation and Christ as the
“new Adam” (Romans 5), so you can see that the Gnostics weren’t entirely
original. Still, the Gnostics dwell on this subject far more than the New
Testament ever did.
The Gospel of Truth
A 140–180 CE writing, the Gospel of Truth is particularly intriguing for many
historians precisely because it may be the actual writing of one of the most
important early Christian Gnostic teachers, Valentinius. It’s not really a
gospel of Jesus, though, but a compendium of Valentinian ideas of Gnostic
Christianity.
This work reveals the origins of human existence and the origins of darkness
and mistakes in the fall of Sophia as well as the importance of Jesus and his
role in informing humans of the truth. The work has a joyful tone as it speaks
of the bliss of reuniting with God and celebrates the eventual return of all to
unity with God.
The gospel is a good example of Christian Gnosticism, and we think it’s a
good document for newcomers to the study of Gnosticism to read in order 
to get an idea why some may find these kinds of ideas quite attractive. The
224
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Gospel of Truth contains less of the nasty, sneering streak that you find in
other Gnostic Christian writings (Jesus laughing at disciples, many people
called “stupid” or compared to swine or cattle, and so on), and one gets the
idea that Valentinius was probably a nice old guy!
For example, the celebration of Jesus is quite poetic, but note how it empha-
sizes what people learn from Jesus and that salvation is information:
For this reason, Jesus appeared; he put on that book; he was nailed to a
tree; he published the edict of the Father on the cross. O such great teaching!
He draws himself down to death though life eternal clothes him. Having
stripped himself of perishable rags, he put on imperishability.
—Gospel of Truth 20 (tr. Attridge and Macrae, ed. Robinson, 42-43)
There’s genuine compassion in how God reaches out with important informa-
tion about reality to fill the void left by “deficiency” and lack of understanding:
For this reason incorruptibility breathed forth; it pursued the one who had
sinned in order that he might rest. For forgiveness is what remains for the
light in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma [fullness]. For the physician
runs to the place where sickness is . . .
—Gospel of Truth 35 (ed. Robinson, 48)
The Hypostasis of the Archons
The third century CE work the Hypostasis of the Archons appears to be a
retelling of Genesis chapters 1 through 6, but it claims to be a fuller explana-
tion of these chapters in that it expands the biblical writing with Gnostic 
cosmology.
The writing claims to be the words given to Norea, a proposed daughter of
Eve. The standard Gnostic themes are present, including a final suggestion
that Christ will eventually come to grant people the critical information they
need for salvation.
On the Origin of the World
This roughly 300–325 CE work is another rehearsal of the spiritual beginnings
of the cosmos — first the spiritual world and then the material world.
Readers are told of the creation of Sophia, the creation of Yaldaboath and
Yaldaboath’s belief that he’s actually God, and the announcement of the
coming of Christ to bring knowledge.
One thing that sets On the Origin of the World apart from some of the other
writings that cover similar topics is an apocalyptic, “last judgment” type of
ending as light and dark, good and evil, are sorted out. The work ends:
225
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

. . . For everyone must go to the place from which he has come. Indeed, by
his acts and his acquaintance each person will make his nature known.
—On the Origin of the World 127 (tr. Bethge, ed. Robinson, 139) 
The Apocalypse of Adam
The Apocalypse of Adam, from around 100–200 CE, purports to be a long
explanation of the nature of the cosmos by Adam to his son, Seth. Many
scholars consider it a non-Christian Gnostic work. It’s based roughly on the
opening chapters of the book of Genesis, and in fact, it has very few Christian
features. The Apocalypse illustrates that the Nag Hammadi Library did
indeed contain many non-Christian works, thus pointing to the existence 
of Gnostics outside of the Christian movement.
The Concept of Our Great Power
The Concept of Our Great Power is a difficult work from around 300–400 CE
that presents a narration of the origins of the cosmos that’s similar to other
Gnostic documents we consider in this chapter, but it’s written without many
of the familiar names. Instead, this work presents spiritual beings (the High
God as “The Great Power”) involved in a conflict that’s represented as a con-
flict between fire and water. Occasionally, a biblical name is cited (such as
Judas and Logos) suggesting that the writer was Christian, but as a whole,
the work appears to describe a spiritual battle that leads to the salvation of
souls who will be reunited with God.
Sethian Gnosticism
Sethian Christian Gnosticism is marked by the apparent importance of the
son of Adam known as Seth (Genesis 4 and 5). Works in this category clearly
display some unique features, most especially proposing some serious
changes in the Jesus story, so it’s often proposed that Sethian Gnosticism
was a particular branch (perhaps a denomination) of Gnostic Christianity.
The Gospel of the Egyptians
The Gospel of the Egyptians is a deeply esoteric and difficult writing from
around 150 CE. It’s sometimes described as a book of Sethian Gnosticism
because of the apparent importance of the son of Adam known as Seth. He’s
considered a historical repository of ancient wisdom:
Then the great Seth was sent by the four lights, by the will of the Autogenes
[perhaps meaning self-generated] and the whole pleroma [fullness], through
the gift and the good pleasure of the invisible Spirit, and the five seals, and
the whole pleroma . . .
—Gospel of the Egyptians 62-62 (Boehlig and Wisse, ed. Robinson, 216)
226
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The contents of this work reiterate much of the same cosmology of
Gnosticism seen in many of the other writings, although this gospel contains
what appear to be sounds written as a series of vowel letters — iiiiiiiiiii and
oooooooooooo, for example. It’s possible that these sounds were interpreted
as coming from the spiritual beings. These sounds also could have been sym-
bolic representations of names of gods or even sounds to be repeated in
Sethian rituals (kind of spooky, eh?).
The Second Treatise of the Great Seth
In the Second Treatise of the Great Seth (likely pre-third century CE), Jesus
explains to selected persons how he came about as a higher being; he
explains that he didn’t die on the cross but that Simon of Cyrene, who carried
Jesus’s cross, actually died in his place while the spirit of Jesus watched from
the cosmos:
I did not succumb to them as they had planned. But I was not afflicted at all.
Those who were there punished me. And I did not die in reality but in
appearance, lest I be put to shame by them . . . I was rejoicing in the height
over all the wealth of the archons and the offspring of their error, of their
empty glory, and I was laughing at their ignorance . . .
—Second Treatise of the Great Seth
Jesus laughing at the ignorance of others? It’s not a pretty picture. In ancient
writings, laughter was almost always a sign of ridicule — never merely an
indication of enjoyment. In other words, the Gnostics are not saying that
Jesus is “laughing with you . . .”, if you get our drift. In fact, this work has a
kind of sneering disrespect of the Jewish tradition — Adam, Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, David, Solomon, and even Moses are all laughingstocks, and all give
witness to another being who is not truth.
Melchizedek
Melchizedek is a curious 200–300 CE work that purports to be an explanation
of the significance of Jesus by comparing him to Melchizedek, the priest
briefly mentioned in the Old Testament (see Genesis 14:18 and Psalm 110:4).
Melchizedek was a priest who spoke to Abraham in the book of Genesis, and
he has been a figure of mystery for centuries. According to some scholars,
this work may have originally been a document from a unique group of
Christians who preserved a strange tradition of honoring this mysterious
Melchizedek as a “previous appearance” of Christ in biblical history. Thus,
some early Gnostics may have believed that Christ was a kind of “reappear-
ance” of Melchizedek.
These scholars have suggested that the work originally belonged to a small
group of Christians perhaps known as Melchizedekites, and that it was edited
by a Sethian Gnostic Christian who perhaps wanted to read the significance
227
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

of Seth in some of the features of this work. The trouble, however, is that the
text is badly damaged, and filling in the missing words and ideas requires a
lot of guesswork.
The Paraphrase of Shem
A deeply esoteric work, The Paraphrase of Shem (second century CE) appears
to represent conflicts between three levels of reality, in this order:
 The god of light
 The “Spirit”
 Darkness
“Shem” is entrusted with the knowledge given in this work. Throughout, the
power of the spirit (often called “Fire”) is contrasted with the negative power
of water, and thus even the water of baptism is considered unacceptable. It
seems that the writer has picked up on water imagery in the Bible (refer to
primordial waters in Genesis 1:1–5, as well as references to the Great Flood
and baptism) and rendered it as representative of evil in opposition to light
and fire. The Paraphrase is only mildly Christian in nature and may be related
to Sethian Gnostic literature.
Gnostic wisdom
Another way of grouping Gnostic writings together is to consider those writ-
ings that appear to offer advice for living your life. This was the main idea
behind Wisdom books like Proverbs in the Old Testament and James in the
New Testament. In Gnostic writings, these works seem to be advice for living
a spiritual life according to Gnostic values and beliefs.
The Teaching of Silvanus
The Teaching of Silvanus (from around 300–400 CE) is often described as
“Greek Christian Wisdom,” which means that its teachings read rather like
the Book of Proverbs or the Epistle of James in the New Testament, both fine
examples of Jewish Wisdom teaching (see Chapter 3 for a more complete
explanation of what we mean by Wisdom writings).
Some historians seriously doubt that the Teaching of Silvanus is a Gnostic
tract; there’s too much practical emphasis on living in the material world for
this to be a deeply Gnostic work, if Gnostic at all. But like a few other writings
in the Nag Hammadi collection, it’s possible to interpret the work in a Gnostic
manner. As in many Wisdom books, the advice in the Teaching often seems
quite timeless and worthy of serious consideration by many Christians. Here
are some rather pleasant examples:

Do not tire of knocking on the door of reason, and do not cease walking in
the way of Christ. Walk in it so that you may receive rest from your labors. If
you walk in another way, there will be no profit in it . . .
—Teaching of Silvanus 103 (tr. Peel, Zandee, ed. Robinson, 389)
Let Christ alone enter your world, and let him bring to naught all powers
which have come upon you. Let him enter the temple which is within you so
that he may cast out all the merchants. Let him dwell in the temple which is
within you, and you may become for him a priest and a Levite, entering in
purity. Blessed are you, O soul, if you find this one in your temple.
—Teaching of Silvanus 109 (ed. Robinson, 391)
The Sentences of Sextus
Before the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library, the Sentences of Sextus was
known in Latin, Syrian, Armenian, and Georgian translations, but the version
in the Nag Hammadi Library is the oldest version now available.
The Sentences represents Wisdom sayings but also contains rather striking
high moral values. Some of the material may be from non-Christian sources,
but it’s hard to avoid the impression that much of the moral guidance here is
deeply Christian in tone and tenor.
The “Sentences” isn’t Gnostic material, although it shows occasional ascetic
tendencies; following are some exemplary quotations from the Sentences of
Sextus that show some ascetic, if not outside Gnostic, tendencies:
 “Do not become guilty of your own death.”
 “Do not be angry at him who will take you out of the body and kill you.”
 “If someone brings the wise man out of the body wickedly he rather
does what is good for him, for he has been released from bonds.”
 “The fear of death grieves man because of the ignorance of the soul.”
—Sentences 320-322, (tr. Wisse, ed. Robinson, 505)
But these ascetic, antimaterial tendencies are just slight. In fact, the 
concern for the material and social well-being of others, and the concern for
Christians being involved in helping others, is a materially moral tone foreign
to much of the deeply Gnostic writings of the Nag Hammadi collection. As
you see throughout this chapter, such writings are preoccupied with identify-
ing names and powers of spiritual entities. Here are some of the more striking
moral advices in the Sentences that make it clear that this work is definitely
not Gnostic:
 “If you take on the guardianship of orphans, you will be the father of
many children and you will be beloved of God.” (340)
 “The love of man is the beginning of godliness.” (371)
229
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

 “He who takes care of men while praying for all of them — this is the
truth of God.” (372)
 “It is God’s business to save whom he wants; on the other hand, it is the
business of the pious man to beseech God to save everyone.” (373)
 “It is better for man to be without anything than to have many things
while not giving to the needy; so also you, if you pray to God, he will not
give to you.” (377-378)
 “If you, from your whole heart, give your bread to the hungry, the gift is
small, but the willingness is great with God.” (379)
 “May your pious works precede every word about God.” (359)
 “God does not need anything, but he rejoices over those who give to the
needy.” (382)
 “The faithful does not speak many words, but their works are numerous.”
(383)
 “The philosopher who is an outer body, he is not the one to whom it is
fitting to pay respect, but the philosopher according to the inner man.”
(392)
(all from ed. Robinson, 506-508)
Gnostic legends and tales
These writings from the Nag Hammadi Library (and some known outside of
that collection as well) seem to expand on New Testament characters and
traditions. Some are written like letters (such as Paul’s or John’s Epistles in
the New Testament) or legends (like the non-canonical Acts of Andrew or Acts
of Paul and Thecla). Not all these writings are clearly Gnostic, but they 
may have been kept by Gnostic Christians because they could be easily 
interpreted in a Gnostic manner.
The Prayer of the Apostle Paul
This brief prayer (it’s less than one translated page) was in the opening 
cover of the first group of writings found at Nag Hammadi and isn’t especially
different from prayers in other books. From around 250–300 CE, it’s a joyful
request to God to reveal important knowledge: “. . . And the first-born of the
pleroma [fullness] of grace — reveal him to my mind!” (Prayer of the Apostle
Paul, tr. Mueller, ed. Robinson, 27-28).
The Treatise on Resurrection
An interesting writing addressed to a certain “Rheginos” and addressing the
nature of life after death, the Treatise on Resurrection (from around 170–200
CE) attempts to reassure the Christian believer about what happens during
230
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

and after one’s mortal demise. It states, “The thought of those who are saved
shall not perish. The mind of those who have known him shall not perish”
(Treatise on Resurrection, 46, tr. Peel, ed. Robinson, 55).
The resurrection is seen as a kind of “completeness” that isn’t possible in
earthly life, but resurrection already begins with those who have renounced
evil during this life. Those who: “. . . flee from the divisions and the fetters . . .
already have the resurrection . . .” (Treatise on Resurrection, 49, ed. Robinson,
56-57). The idea seems to be that freedom from the chains of this world can
begin in this life by knowing and studying Gnostic information.
The Exegesis of the Soul
This roughly 200–230 CE work is among the more interesting of the writings
because the story is fairly clear. The Exegesis of the Soul is a novelistic story
of the soul expressed through the journey of a female being who falls into the
material world. Her plunge into the bodily form is described as a descent into
prostitution, but she’s redeemed by a purer love and then returns to the
house of the father.
This work, somewhat unusually, is typified by frequent quotations not only
from the Bible but also from Homer’s Odyssey. Also, marriage and intercourse
are used as symbols of becoming reunited with true selves (like the image of
the Bridal Chamber in other Gnostic writings like the Gospel of Philip; see
that section earlier in this chapter).
The Exegesis, however, doesn’t have very many explicitly Christian teach-
ings. However, it does speak in a female voice and use images of falling into
abuse before being restored by “despising this life, because it is transitory.”
The female being learns about her light as “she goes about stripping off this
world” (tr. W. Robinson, ed. Robinson, 192–198).
The Apocalypse of Paul
In this roughly 150–200 CE text, Paul meets a child on the road who knows 
all about Paul and begins to explain spiritual realities to Paul. Immediately
following a little lesson from the boy, Paul then goes into various layers of
heaven, where he witnesses souls on trial and learns a bit more about the
nature of heaven and spiritual reality by ascending upwards into these 
various layers of heaven.
The Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles
Professor Parrott, one of the translators of the Acts of Peter and the Twelve
Apostles into English, argues that this work from around 100–300 CE isn’t 
necessarily a Gnostic work because the views of Jesus are more or less 
orthodox. Instead, it may belong to the later Christian “Acts” literature that
we examine in Chapter 15. The Acts is a fascinating allegorical tale of the 
disciples being sent into the world to spread the message of Jesus. In fact, 
it’s a charming story.
231
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

When Peter and other disciples decide to set sail on a ship, they find 
themselves arriving on a strange and otherwise unknown island called
“Habitation.” Peter decides to help the disciples find a place to stay and goes
to the city. There, he happens upon a man crying, “Pearls, Pearls!” But the
rich people of the island can’t actually see that the man is holding anything,
and thus they reject him as a mocker. The poor people of the island, however,
are deeply impressed with the man’s claims to have pearls and beg to at least
see them even though they can’t afford to buy any. The man identifies himself
as “Lithargoel,” and tells Peter that Peter is welcome to come to his city, 
but that the way is hard. One must not carry much of value or even excess
food or water because the robbers and animals along the way will take 
anything of value.
Peter finds the town but is met on the road by a physician and an assistant.
The physician reveals himself to be another form of Lithargoel, who then
reveals himself to be Jesus! Jesus explains to Peter that he must go through
the world with the gospel as a pearl to offer freely to the poor, and Peter
must renounce all wealth to make it through the world:
. . . the physicians of this world heal what belongs to the world. The
physicians of souls, however, heal the heart. Heal the bodies first, therefore,
so that through the real powers of healing for their bodies, without medicine
of the world, they may believe in you, that you have power to heal the
illnesses of the heart also.
—Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles 11 (tr. Parrott, ed. Robinson, 293)
The care for physical needs is uncharacteristic of Gnostic literature, but this
story was probably preserved by Gnostics because it could be interpreted in
a Gnostic manner. This work is a great example of allegorical tales from the
early Christians (like the Shepherd of Hermas, the Acts of Paul and Thecla,
and others).
The Thought of Norea
The roughly 100–250 CE work The Thought of Norea consists only of 52 lines
of text and appears to be a kind of prayer or praise of Norea, a proposed
daughter of Eve. It may be a prayer said in a prelude to some reading of other
literature that purports to be from Norea.
The Testimony of Truth
From around 175–250 CE, The Testimony of Truth is considered only a partial
document, with perhaps as much as half of it missing. Still, you can get an
interesting idea of the character of this writing, including its anti-material
notions, its anti-Hebrew ideas based on its initial attack on the Mosaic Law,
and its take on the idea of procreation:
232
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The Law commands one to take a husband or to take a wife and to beget, 
to multiply like sand of the sea. But passion which is a delight to them
constrains the souls of those who are begotten in this place, those who defile
and those who are defiled in order that the Law might be fulfilled through
them. And they show that they are assisting the world; and they turn away
from the light . . .
—Testimony of Truth 30 (tr. Pearson, ed. Robinson, 450)
This writing claims that when Jesus was baptized, the Jordan River stopped
flowing. It goes on to explain that because the Jordan River represents the
desire for sexual intercourse, Jesus basically stopped sex! Again you can see
the Gnostic suspicion of any human sensuality.
Furthermore, this writing is more explicit than others about the fallen nature
of the Jewish God. Pointing to a number of admittedly troubling passages in
the Old Testament as evidence (such as God “hardening” Pharaoh’s heart 
in the Exodus story and God sounding generally vengeful in many Old
Testament passages), the writer claims that this isn’t a true God!
The Interpretation of Knowledge
Elaine Pagels, one of the foremost scholars of Gnostic Scriptures, considers
the Interpretation of Knowledge to be a “unique opportunity” to see how the
Christian Bible was interpreted and used in Christian Gnostic circles. This
likely second-century CE writing appears to be a series of teachings based 
on scripture, but the teachings are given a decidedly Gnostic interpretation.
Pagels seems correct, however, when she emphasizes that this writing also
includes many attempts to settle disputes among the members:
But is someone making progress in the Word? Do not be hindered by this; 
do not say: “Why does he speak while I do not?” for what he says is also
yours, and what which discerns the Word and that which speaks is the 
same power . . .
—Interpretation of Knowledge 16-17 (tr. Pagels, ed. Robinson, 478)
The writer borrows St. Paul’s description of the Church like the various 
cooperating parts of the human body:
If they are fit to share in the true harmony, how much the more those who
derive from the single unity? They ought to be reconciled with one another.
Do not accuse your Head because it has not appointed you as an eye but
rather as a finger. And do not be jealous of that which has been put in the
class of an eye or a hand or a foot, but be thankful that you do not exist
outside the body . . .
—Interpretation of Knowledge 18 (ed. Robinson, 479)
233
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

A Valentinian Exposition
Another exposition of Gnostic cosmology, A Valentinian Exposition (from
around the early second century CE) is similar in some ways to the Tripartite
Tractate (refer to that section earlier in this chapter) but has some significant
differences of view on many aspects of that cosmology.
As Pagels points out, this work claims that God is originally a single unitary
being, whereas the Tripartite Tractate seems to suggest that the original
being was a combined being of male and female elements in the single unity.
There are three documents that collectively make this “Exposition,” including
writings on Anointing, Baptism, and Eucharist.
Of particular interest with regard to this work are the ending paragraphs,
which may be parts of a Gnostic anointment, baptism, and Eucharistic ritual.
Consider this portion of an anointing ritual, perhaps intended for prayers 
of healing to accompany being anointed with oil. The prayer starts 
rather nicely:
It is fitting for you at this time to send thy Son, Jesus Christ, and anoint us to
that we might be able to trample upon the snakes and the heads of the
scorpions and all the power of the Devil — since he (that is, Christ) is the
shepherd of the seed. Through him we have known thee. And we glorify
thee: Glory be to thee, the Father in the Son, the Father in the Son, the
Father in the holy Church and in the Holy angels. From now on he abides
forever in the perpetuity of the Aeons, forever until the untraceable Aeons of
the Aeons. Amen.
—On the Anointing (tr. Pagels, ed. Robinson, 487)
The First Thought in Three Forms (Or “Trimorphic Protennoia”)
The 100–200 CE work called the First Thought in Three Forms consists of a
series of “I am” sayings by a being who identifies the nature of true spiritual
existence. In general, the First Thought describes the various ways in which
light is understood to defeat darkness in the cosmos. Historians consider this
work to be Christian only by a few editorial glosses added to the writing; it
doesn’t directly address issues of the identity and nature of Christian life.
Consider a portion:
I am the Invisible One within the All. It is I who counsel those who are
hidden, since I know the All that exists in it. I am numberless beyond
everyone. I am immeasurable, ineffable, yet whenever I wish, I shall reveal
myself of my own accord. I am the head of the All. I exist before the All, and
I am the All since I exist in everyone . . .
—First Thought in Three Forms 1 (tr. Turner, ed. Robinson, 513)
234
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The writing contains some discussions of the Christ, but in esoteric language
of Gnostic spirituality:
Then the Perfect Son revealed himself to his Aeons who originated through
him, and he revealed them and glorified them and gave them thrones and
stood in the glory with which he glorified himself. They blessed the Perfect
Son, the Christ, the only-begotten God. And they gave glory, saying “He is! He
is! The Son of God! The Son of God! It is he who is! The Aeon of Aeons
beholding the Aeons which he begot! For thou hast begotten to thine own
desire! Therefore we glorify thee . . . [sounds indicated by vowels].”
—First Thought in Three Forms 38 (ed. Robinson, 513)
The Act of Peter
The Act of Peter is a strange 150–200 CE story purporting to be about Peter’s
daughter; it reflects Gnostic interest in denying physical sexuality and
embracing ascetic denial of the flesh.
As the story begins, a crowd gathers around Peter, and they point out a gross
inconsistency: Peter has healed many people of their diseases and afflictions,
but Peter’s own daughter is paralyzed and can’t walk. “Why do you not heal
your own daughter?” they ask.
Peter then heals her instantly, proving that God is well able to do it. But he
then tells her to return to her place and “become an invalid again.” The
crowd is horrified, but Peter explains that this is all for the best because
she’s too beautiful and men might sin because of her! (Nice dad, eh?)
Peter then tells the story of Ptolemy, who was totally captivated by Peter’s
daughter’s beauty when she was only 10 years old. Ptolemy captured her, 
and just before he tried to have sexual intercourse with her, she became 
paralyzed. The servant of Ptolemy brought her back to Peter and his wife in
this condition.
After this, Ptolemy becomes so overcome with guilt that he goes blind 
from weeping. Peter calls for him, and Ptolemy is led to Peter’s presence.
When Peter heals him, the miracle leads to many people becoming Christian.
There’s a brief suggestion that Ptolemy did many good things during the
remainder of his life and in his will left a large amount of money to be given 
to the poor.
The Act closes with a prayer of thanksgiving from Peter, who distributes
bread from the money left by Ptolemy. Of course, we would say that this isn’t
a very flattering picture of Peter’s own family life, nor a very loving attitude
toward his daughter!
235
Chapter 12: The Gnostic Christian Writings

Gnostic Christianity’s Influence 
on “Orthodox” Christianity
Gnostic Christianity represented a significant alternative form of early
Christianity even though it didn’t survive the ancient world and therefore
ceased exercising much influence on the formation of Christianity in later
periods.
Gnostic Christianity helped to create the conditions in which orthodox
Christianity began to take shape. To put it another way, what was later (say,
after the fifth to sixth centuries CE) recognized as orthodox Christianity took
shape precisely by arguing with and reacting to Gnostic Christianity.
Orthodox (remember that in this case, we mean simply “orthodox” in belief,
not the later “Eastern Orthodox” churches) Christianity had to reaffirm its
commitment to the human Jesus. Orthodox Christians argued about the pre-
cise relationship of Jesus as a being that is both human and divine — to deny
the human part was to tear away a major part of Christian affirmation of this
world as God’s good creation and also tear away the importance of the
bodily, material world in which people must live and function. Care for the
poor and care for the hungry are important “body” issues that orthodox
Christianity affirmed against the Gnostic tendencies to deny the importance
of this world and human bodies. We take care of each other because bodies
are important! Furthermore, the physical existence of Jesus as human is a
strong basis for arguing such issues as concern for the environment.
Gnosticism also had a tendency to deny the significance of sexuality as
among God’s gifts to humanity. A strict Gnostic denial of the ultimate impor-
tance of physical bodies may be a comfort to those who suffer or are in 
pain in their bodies in this world, but it also has the unfortunate impact of
suggesting that sexuality and family life are somehow bad or impure.
Finally, it’s still argued that the debates against the Gnostics also forced 
the orthodox Christians to clarify which books and writings were acceptable
and which were not. Clearly, just because something is written doesn’t make
it acceptable . . . and the early Church finally had to come to grips with 
this fact.

Chapter 13
Christian Books That Were
Strongly Considered
In This Chapter
 Meeting the Apostolic Fathers
 Identifying the books that launched Christianity
S
ometime after 700 CE in the medieval period, the most popular of the
early Christian writings that are not in the New Testament began to be
gathered together and referred to as “the Apostolic Fathers.” (Yes, you read
that right: The writings themselves — not their authors — were referred to as
“the Apostolic Fathers.”) Interestingly, some of these books may have been
written before some of the books that are in the New Testament.
In the early centuries of Christianity, many people believed that the early
books were written by students of the first Apostles of Jesus, suggesting a
line of tradition that begins with Jesus and proceeds through his disciples
(the Apostles), and then to the next generation, the so-called Apostolic
Fathers.
In this chapter, we take a closer look at these fascinating writings and note
that these are especially important because some of these books actually
were part of some early Christian New Testaments. Remember, the final list of
books that are the Christian Bible came out in 367 CE. There was a variety of
opinions about certain books. The early Christian books most often men-
tioned with great appreciation are the books we survey in this chapter.
There’s considerable disagreement about these writings, especially on the
issue of when they’re dated. We briefly discuss the debates as we look at 
each of these famous writings, but one thing is absolutely clear: This chapter
discusses the most important Christian writings that are not in the New
Testament. These really are the “Almost In” books of early Christianity.
Therefore, it’s an interesting exercise to read through these writings and

wonder how any of these books might have changed the modern form of
Christianity if they had been included in the New Testament. In some cases,
perhaps they wouldn’t have caused very much change, but in other cases,
they may have changed things for the better. This exercise is part of the fasci-
nation with these writings.
The Standard List of the 
Apostolic Fathers
The following lost books comprise the majority of the commonly accepted
list of writings known as the Apostolic Fathers:
 The Shepherd of Hermas
 The Didache (also known as the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles)
 The Epistle of Polycarp
 The Martyrdom of Polycarp
 The Letters of Ignatius
 1 and 2 Clement
 The Epistle of Barnabas
 The Epistle to Diognetus
One reason these writings were so popular is that they seem to give 
evidence of the struggles of early orthodox Christianity against rival forms 
of Christianity. It’s now known that there were lots of different kinds of
Christianity in the first few centuries, but only some of these forms survived.
The form of Christianity that emerged as orthodox, leading toward the
Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, is represented in these
early writings, and that’s one reason these writings, on occasion, mention
early debates between Christian groups. Equally pressing is the state of the
Christian movement itself in times of trouble and persecution; some of these
writings are quite moving in their concern for the well-being of Christians in
various ancient cities and locations.
The Shepherd of Hermas
By far the most impressive, longest, and strangest of the early Christian writ-
ings that almost made it into the Bible is the collection of various writings
known as the Shepherd of Hermas.
238
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Essentially, the Shepherd of Hermas is an account of the visions and revela-
tions from angelic figures to the freed slave named Hermas, the recipient and
ostensibly the writer of the work. This bizarre collection of materials is a
mixed bag of imagery and scenes. At times, it’s charming, fascinating, surpris-
ing, and a delight to read. There are moments when it even sounds a bit like
something from Tolkien (author of The Lord of the Rings series, among other
works). But there are also passages in the Shepherd of Hermas that are down-
right disturbing, like the images of the punishment of sinners as sheep being
mistreated by mean shepherds called “angels of punishment.”
Strange as it may seem to the modern reader, Hermas was a very popular
early Christian work, and it was printed with the New Testament in some
very early handwritten Bibles and collections of Christian writings.
“The Shepherd of Hermas” is a bit of a misnomer, frankly, because the angelic
person who communicates with Hermas in the work assumes many identi-
ties, including women of varying ages. Although it’s an actual shepherd in
only part of the book, The Shepherd of Hermas is the work’s traditional title.
The Shepherd of Hermas can be appreciated as a collection of the kinds of
stories, images, and conversations that would have kept early Christians, and
perhaps even early Christian young people, entertained for hours. Although
they run a bit long at times, many of these stories are still quite entertaining
and occasionally profound. In the following sections, we discuss some of the
various visions and lessons that are found in the Shepherd of Hermas.
Who was Hermas? Who knows?
It’s often suggested that the writing attributed to Hermas is from Rome, but
truth be told, no one knows for sure who Hermas is, was, could have been, 
or wasn’t.
In Romans 16:14, Paul writes, “Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas,
Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.” Don’t confuse the Hermas
mentioned by Paul for the Hermas of the Shepherd of Hermas.
It’s possible that “Hermas” is a fictional name given the conventions of 
writing such apocalyptic books, which often use a pseudonym for the author
or source.
The Shepherd of Hermas is assumed to be a second-century work. Origen,
the early Christian writer (185–254 CE), mentions it, providing the latest date
for its existence, while some estimates for Hermas include even the early
decades of the second century CE, circa 100–130 CE. Among the difficulties
with dating this work and assigning it to a known area is the fact that it doesn’t
quote Christian writings very much at all, and it seems entirely removed from
some of the debates of the late first and early second century.
239
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

Surveying the Shepherd of Hermas
The Shepherd of Hermas was normally divided into three sections, but there
weren’t clear-cut distinctions among them. Recent editions of this work have
redivided this long writing along similar lines but provide chapter breaks 
for easier reference; the revised organization breaks it down into these three
sections:
 The Visions: Chapters 1–25
 Commandments/Mandates: Chapters 26–49
 Parables: Chapters 50–114
Historians usually classify the Shepherd of Hermas as apocalyptic because it
involves visions and revelations from angelic figures to the freed slave named
Hermas, the recipient and ostensibly the writer of the work.
Lessons from Hermas’s visions
In the beginning of the book, Hermas is introduced as the former slave of a
Roman noblewoman named Rhoda. The writer (who’s understood to be
Hermas) explains that he became friends with Rhoda long after he served 
as her slave and once helped her out of the Tiber River while bathing.
Presumably, Hermas saw her naked, but he claims that his thoughts of her
were pure: “When I observed her beauty I began reasoning in my heart, ‘I
would be fortunate to have a wife of such beauty and character.’”
Later, while traveling, he falls asleep only to have a series of very strange
dreams. Initially, Rhoda appears to him in his dream, accusing him of impure
thoughts. Hermas protests, and the rest of the book consists of lessons
revealed to Hermas by various heavenly figures.
The first is a woman who appears to Hermas at different stages of life, sug-
gesting different stages in the life of the Christian Church and even in the life
of a Christian. In subsequent visions, a younger woman appears to Hermas
and reveals a great tower built of various bricks drawn from different loca-
tions. The book later clarifies that the reader is intended to understand this
tower as the Christian Church composed of different kinds of people, some
considered good and others bad. The different colored bricks that make up
the tower are a parable about different kinds of people — those with faith
that sustains them, those who give up their faith, and all who have a variety
of different experiences.
In fact, three main images run through the book to represent different forms
of the same general message about the composition of the Church and 
different kinds of people. The images are
240
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

 Different bricks that make up the tower
 Different plants that come from seedlings cut from the tree that is 
the Church
 Material drawn from different mountains to build the Church
Although these are the main images, there are other genuinely strange
aspects of Hermas’s visions, such as his vision of an overnight stay with a
group of beautiful virgins (chapters 87–88). Although sexual activity is decid-
edly denied, the description has an erotic element with which Freud would
no doubt have had a field day. Later, the book piously interprets the virgins
as holy spirits, but not before the reader’s imagination has run wild!
Lessons from the commandments of the Shepherd
Following Hermas’s visions, a shepherd is introduced as a kind of angelic
companion to Hermas; the Shepherd tells Hermas that he has been assigned
to stay with Hermas and instruct him.
In much of the rest of the book, you read about the Shepherd’s lessons for
Hermas. As you can see from the following list, these commandments include
some rather basic ideas (our comments appear in parentheses):
 Believe that God is one, who created and completed all things.
 Hold on to simplicity and be innocent . . . do not slander others.
 Tell the truth always.
 Don’t allow sexually immoral thoughts to arise within you — think of
your wife, not others’ wives.
 Be patient, and resist being irritable and bitter.
 Proceed on the Straight Path, and avoid the Crooked Path. (Included is
the notion that you can follow one of two angels in your life: a good one
or a bad one.)
 Obey the Commandments of God, and don’t fear Satan.
 Refrain from Evil, but don’t refrain from doing Good.
 Don’t be of two minds — be confident in your faith.
 Don’t be grieved. (Apparently, this means that you shouldn’t worry
about the concerns of this life.)
 Test Prophets for the truth — don’t believe in false prophecies.
 Clothe yourself with the desire to do good, and avoid evil desires.
Parables to reaffirm the Shepherd’s commandments
The last section of the Shepherd of Hermas is the Parables, or stories. Some
of these are similar to Jesus’s parables (for example, the famous “sower of
241
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

seeds” parable in Mark 4:3–9 and the “talents” parable in Matthew 25:14–31).
The difference is that the parables of the Shepherd of Hermas teach different
kinds of lessons; most of these stories reaffirm the same lessons taught by
the Shepherd in the Commandments section of the book (see the preceding
section).
The Didache: The First Written Catechism
An early teaching tool intended to summarize the moral expectations of
Christian faith is The Didache; it’s also known as the Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles.
The word “Didache” is taken from the Greek word for “teaching.”
The Didache is often dated very early — at the end of the first century CE —
which suggests considerable historical value to some of the discussions
included. For example, the discussions of fasting, baptism, and Eucharist
(Communion) establish that these practices were being regularized in
Christian worship at a very early date.
The three main subjects taken up in the Didache, each of which we discuss in
this section, are
 The two ways: Chapters 1–6
 Church order: Chapters 7–15
 Church offices: Chapter 16
The two ways
The first section of the Didache presents another version of the famous two
paths identified as life and death — a theme that’s common to both Christian
and Jewish moral instruction.
The path of life is described by the moral principles involved, and the path of
death is described by a listing of traits characteristic of this negative direc-
tion. The opening sequence of this part of the Didache is short and to the
point; it draws directly on the teaching of Jesus: “There are two paths, one of
life and one of death . . . this then is the path of life. First, love the God who
made you, and second, your neighbor as yourself . . .” (Didache 1).
Although Jesus isn’t explicitly quoted here, this section consists largely of
quotes from the New Testament strung together in a series, specifically
Matthew 22:37–39 and Luke 10:27.

Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The social conservatism in the Didache is often debated. Just how much did
Christians want to change society, for example? In Paul’s letter to the
Ephesians, Paul famously states that slaves are told to obey masters even as
masters are also told never to mistreat slaves (Ephesians 6:5–9). So, some
argue that this is evidence that Christians were cautious and didn’t seek
major social change. But is this really a social conservatism? Other historians
argue that the early Christians may not have even been able to conceive of
Roman society without slavery, and besides, they didn’t make the rules or
live in a society in which change could be suggested (Rome was hardly a
democracy!). Therefore, the early Christians changed what they could 
change — their own society. Thus, they sought to make the conditions better
at least among themselves and even purchased the freedom of Christian
slaves on occasion. (Ignatius’s Letter to Polycarp mentions purchasing free-
dom for slaves among Christians (4:3), but Ignatius also seems concerned
that the churches not use all their money for this purpose!)
Church order
The second section of the Didache takes up instructions for church rituals,
such as baptism, fasting, and the “thanksgiving meal,” or Eucharist. This sec-
tion even includes suggested prayers for the observation of these early
Christian rituals.
The section is of obvious interest to those who study the history of Christian
rituals because it provides a very early account of these practices in the
Christian movement. On baptism, for example, the Didache says the 
following:
And concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things,
baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in
living water. But if you have no living water, baptize into other water; and if
you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm. But if you have neither, pour
out water three times upon the head into the name of Father and Son and
Holy Spirit. But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the baptized,
and whoever else can; but you shall order the baptized to fast one or two
days before.
—Didache 7
Church offices
The last section of the Didache is a description of various offices in the
Christian Church, with particular attention given to the care of Christian
prophets. The book warns that there are some who claim to be church lead-
ers and teachers, but there are ways to recognize whether they’re genuine or
not. The most common test is based on their attitude toward money and
243
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

whether they hang around and mooch off the church too much! A pretty
good indicator of genuineness, eh?
The end of the Didache is a brief apocalyptic description of the end times,
but this text doesn’t appear to be complete, and many historians suggest that
the actual ending has been lost.
The Epistle of Polycarp to the 
Christians at Philippi
Polycarp was an early church leader in Smyrna, which is today Izmir in
modern Turkey. He’s singularly unique because so much is known about him
thanks to three writings, all of which are part of the Apostolic Fathers. These
writings are
 The Epistle of Polycarp to the Christians at Philippi
 An account of Polycarp’s death (see the next section “The Martyrdom of
Polycarp”)
 Ignatius’s letter to Polycarp (see the later section “The Letters of
Ignatius”)
Polycarp’s letter to the Christians at Philippi is a general body of advice to 
all levels and ages of the people in the Church asking them to behave in an
appropriate manner and especially to take care of one another. Leaders of the
church, for example, are advised to avoid the love of money. (Hmmm, that’s a
good tip for everyone, we think.)
The letter also cautions against “false teachings” and “false teachers,” sug-
gesting that, at the time it was written, the differences in viewpoints among
Christians were beginning to bother leaders who considered themselves
orthodox in their views.
Polycarp’s letter also addresses friction within the Church, but an interesting
difference is that Polycarp quotes from the teachings of Jesus (especially 
sayings that you may know from the books of Matthew and Luke) much more
frequently than another Apostolic Father, Ignatius, does.
The Martyrdom of Polycarp
Among the most unusual of the writings known as the Apostolic Fathers is
the short account known as the Martyrdom of Polycarp. It’s a description of
244
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

precisely that: the events leading up to and then the death of the Church
leader, the elder Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna.
Historians have long noted the similarities between this description and
many of the Passion accounts of Jesus given in the Gospels; the parallels 
are no doubt intentional because the writer of the Martyrdom of Polycarp 
frequently notes, “. . . for Polycarp waited to be betrayed, as also did the
Lord. . . .” Other comparisons are the famous dialogues: In the Gospels, Jesus
has interesting dialogues with Pilate and Herod, and in the Martydom of
Polycarp, Polycarp engages in dialogue with his adversaries who have the
power of his life in their hands. In both cases, Jesus and Polycarp act as if
these adversaries are not really deserving of much respect!
Scholars date this book anywhere from the 150s to the 170s CE, but most 
historians prefer the earlier date because the actual death of Polycarp is
cited in the early 150s.
The Martyrdom of Polycarp includes rather gruesome descriptions of deaths
of Christians by torture and wild animals in public executions. Included in 
the descriptions of the death of Polycarp are elements typical of other 
martyr stories, such as the many attempts by Roman officials who try to talk
Polycarp out of his own execution: “Take pity on your age!” But the crowd
calls for the death of Polycarp and other Christians who are called “atheists”
for not “believing in” the Roman gods. The cry of the crowd is reminiscent of
the Passion accounts of Jesus, but in this case, it’s clear that the crowd is
composed of all kinds of people.
According to this writing, Polycarp has visions and dreams about his impend-
ing death and therefore knows that his martyrdom is coming. Along the way,
the document carefully cautions Christians against actively seeking to be
martyred; yet it makes it clear that if Christians are faced with death and mar-
tyrdom, they should face it with courage.
Polycarp is offered release if he only confesses “Caesar is Lord,” but he
refuses. In an act of impressive defiance, he’s told to turn to his fellow
Christians and say “Away with the atheists,” but instead he turns to the
Roman officials and crowd and says to them, “Away with the atheists!” As 
in many martyrdom accounts (including the famous discussions between
Herod, Pilate, and Jesus in the New Testament, and 2 Maccabees in the
Apocryphal books), a long conversation takes place between the Roman 
official and Polycarp, but Polycarp refuses all attempts to get him to recant
his faith.
According to the writing, when the officials try to burn Polycarp alive, a mira-
cle occurs that spares him from the flames even though they keep burning
around him. Frustrated that he’s not burning up, a Roman soldier stabs him
with a lance. At once, a dove emerges from the wound, and the blood that
gushes from Polycarp extinguishes the flames. The dove often is considered a
manifestation of Polycarp’s rising spirit.
245
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

After Polycarp’s body was successfully burned following the stabbing,
Christians considered his bones treasures that should be kept. This reaction
points to a very early beginning of the tradition of relics that became so 
widespread in later Christianity.
The Letters of Ignatius
Ignatius was a leader in Antioch, one of the most important cities for early
Christianity. (It’s where the word “Christian” was first coined, according the
biblical book of Acts.) In the Letters of Ignatius, he heads from what’s known
today as Syria to Rome to his own execution.
Far from avoiding his impending death, however, Ignatius seems to revel in
the idea of his own martyrdom. Ignatius travels under guard by land, taking
considerable time to get to Rome. Along the way, he receives visitors, sends
and receives letters, and interacts with Christian groups.
In this section, we examine the seven letters of Ignatius, which some scholars
used to doubt as authentic (and thus, possibly written later) in part because
other, clearly later letters were also circulating. But the seven we examine
here are considered the real deal!
The messages of the seven letters
Today, seven of the Letters of Ignatius are considered authentic, but for cen-
turies many more than seven letters were in circulation, some in very long
versions. Not surprisingly, considerable debate raged about what were the
authentic letters even though the seven currently considered authentic were
mentioned and quoted in second-century Christian writings. By the seven-
teenth century, however, the generally recognized seven letters of Ignatius
had been agreed upon by historians and leaders of the Christian Church.
It appears that Ignatius was martyred in the time of the Roman Emperor
Trajan (98–117), so the seven letters are a very early collection of important
Christian letters.
Each of Ignatius’s seven letters is addressed to a different group (or individ-
ual in the case of the seventh letter). They have some interesting similarities
and differences, such as Ignatius’s lovely tendency to provide some encour-
agement at the beginning of his letters, even as he addresses different issues
specific to each location. The following list takes a look at each letter one 
by one:
246
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

 To the Ephesians (the Christians in Ephesus, in modern Turkey)
In this letter, Ignatius reaffirms the reputation of the Church in Ephesus
to be strong and compassionate, but he also advises the people to be
careful of “false teachers” who would divide the Church against itself.
It’s evident in this letter that Ignatius is capable of some charming prose:
“This is the beginning and end of life: faith is the beginning, love is the
end. And the two together in unity are God: all other things that lead to
nobility of character follow” (14:1).
 To the Magnesians (the Christians in Magnesia, in northern Greek 
territory)
The notable content in this letter is Ignatius’s attacks on Judaizers who
maintain Jewish traditions. Ignatius wants to maintain the “new” teach-
ings of Jesus.
 To the Trallians (the Christians in Tralles, now Aydin in modern Turkey)
After his typical encouraging opening, Ignatius warns about theological
ideas that he doesn’t agree with. In this letter, the imagery gets serious
as he attacks those who “. . . mingle Jesus Christ with themselves, as if
giving a deadly drug mixed with honeyed wine, which the unsuspecting
gladly takes with evil pleasure, but then dies” (6:2). The fact that
Ignatius emphasizes in chapter 9 that Jesus really was born, really lived,
and really died at the hands of Pilate suggests that the heresy he was
fighting against was the idea that Jesus only appeared to be a physical
person but really was not. (This is an early heresy known as docetism,
meaning “to appear.”)
 To the Romans
Ignatius commends the faith of the Roman church but cautions them
against taking action to prevent his martyrdom: “I urge you, do not
become an untimely kindness to me. Allow me to be bread for the wild
beasts; through them I am able to attain to God” (4:1). Interesting, how-
ever, he also refers to his Roman guards as “wild beasts” who frequently
mistreat him (5).
 To the Philadelphians (the Christians in Philadelphia, now Alasehir in
western Turkey)
Again, Ignatius is concerned about divisions within the Church and
urges unity: “For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ and one cup
that brings the unity of his blood, and one altar, as there is one bishop
together with the presbytery and the deacons, my fellow slaves”(4).
Apparently, there were also those who advised continued observance 
of Jewish ritual laws, which upset Ignatius immensely (see the letter 
to the Magnesians earlier in this list). By this time, Christianity and
Judaism were going their separate ways, and there was no love lost
between them.
247
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

Ignatius’s letter to the Philadelphians makes an interesting reference to
debates about the sayings of Jesus, but Ignatius asserts his own confi-
dence and qualifications to interpret the tradition about Jesus, even if
others claim to have a “written record.” Ignatius’s words suggest that
there already may have been disputes about genuine writings — that is,
writings that disagree with what Ignatius considers correct belief about
Jesus. He writes, “But as for me, Jesus Christ is the ancient records: the
sacred ancient records are his cross and death, and his resurrection,
and the faith that comes through him” (8).
 To the Smyrneans (the Christians in Smyrna, now Izmir in Turkey)
In Smyrna, there were disputes about whether Jesus was truly human or
only appeared to be. In his letter to the Smyrneans, Ignatius gets a bit
testy with folks who argue that Jesus only appeared to be human: “They
are the ones who are only an appearance!” (2:1). Ouch. Ignatius cites the
post-Resurrection accounts in the Gospels to argue against this ten-
dency to deny the material reality of the human Jesus. He advises
Christians in Smyrna to avoid those who argue with them about Jesus’s
humanity.
 To Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna
Ignatius addresses a letter to a fellow church leader, Polycarp, Bishop 
of Smyrna. Given the divisions Ignatius refers to in his general letter to
the Christians in Smyrna (see the preceding bullet), it comes as little
surprise that he advises Polycarp to work toward unity and quotes Jesus
(Matthew 10:16) to advise Polycarp to be “. . . wise as a serpent in all
things and always pure as the dove” (2:2).
Defending Christian orthodoxy
Of particular interest in the letters of Ignatius is his defense of Christian
orthodoxy (that is, the “right belief”). It’s why these writings have gotten 
so much attention, especially by historians who wish to better understand
the divisions and debates that plagued the early Christian movement. In 
his letters, Ignatius takes objection to two major heresies: the Judaizers and
the Gnostics.
Judging Judaizers
Judaizers (somewhat ironically given that Christianity was, after all, originally
a Jewish movement) are Christians who wish to affirm their continued 
Jewish identity and even insist that a strong adherence to traditional Jewish
practices — such as attending synagogue, observing strict food laws, and
maintaining ritual purity — ought to be the norm for all Christians, whether
Jewish or Gentile.
248
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

As the Christian movement grew among non-Jews, there was considerable
debate about whether Christianity should change its ritual practices to
accommodate the increasing non-Jewish population of converts. These folks
weren’t always attracted to all the ritual requirements of Jewish life — most
notably, undergoing circumcision (see the nearby sidebar on this pleasant
topic!). In his letter to Christians in Philadelphia, for example, Ignatius calls
his Jewish and Christian opponents on this issue “tombs of death” (6:1).
Not buying into Gnosticism
Gnosticism is the idea that humans are spiritual rather than material beings
and that the most important reality is spiritual rather than the temporary
body that humans occupy. (For more on Gnostic writings, see Chapter 12.)
This philosophical set of ideas had a great impact on many Christians.
249
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered
Why was circumcision so important?
Circumcision, the surgical removal of the fore-
skin on the male penis, is a physical act that’s
usually performed within a month of birth for
male children in many religious and cultural tra-
ditions around the world.
There’s an ongoing debate about whether the
practice is rooted in ancient beliefs about
health or superstition, but it’s clear that it was
considered one of the main ritual requirements
of Jewish identity and faith in ancient Jewish
practice, beginning early in the biblical texts.
According to the tradition in the book of
Genesis, this physical mark was the sign of the
agreement that God made with Abraham and a
sign to accompany God’s promise that Abraham
would have as many descendants as the stars
in the sky (Genesis 15 and Genesis 17:11).
When you think about it (after blushing, per-
haps), it makes some sense that the physical
sign of this nature would involve the male sex
organ if the accompanying promise was the
promise of descendants. Thus, any sexual act
would involve being visually reminded of God’s
promise to Abraham!
However, circumcision came to have wider 
symbolic significance as well, and in early
Christianity, it was used as a kind of shorthand or
code to speak of Jewish ritual observance more
generally. Thus, Paul speaks of a kind of spiritual
circumcision in his famous letter to the Roman
Christians: “For a person is not a Jew who is one
outwardly, nor is true circumcision something
external and physical. Rather, a person is a Jew
who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a
matter of the heart — it is spiritual and not literal.
Such a person receives praise not from others
but from God” (Romans 2:28–29).
Clearly, the single physical marking has come 
to represent a spiritual identity that involves
observing more than this one act in Jewish tra-
dition. When historians speak of the pro-
circumcision arguments in early Christianity,
they refer to people who advocated a wide range
of Jewish ritual practices, not only this one.
However, one can easily understand why new adult
male converts to Christianity often found the idea of
circumcision to be highly objectionable (and even
scary!). It wasn’t always just a symbolic objection,
nor was it always just a religious issue.

Gnosticism tends to praise the idea of death as liberating the soul and down-
grades the significance of any material issues of life as mere distractions.
Furthermore, Christian Gnostics wrote many of their own writings, consider-
ing Jesus a true Gnostic teacher when interpreted correctly. However, the
Gnostics also wrote their own Gospels complete with highly suspicious quo-
tations from Jesus that rather conveniently supported their own ideas. When
in his letter to the Smyrneans Ignatius attacks those who teach that Jesus
only “appeared” to suffer but didn’t actually suffer (because he didn’t have a
real body, which would have offended Gnostic ideas about the importance of
the spiritual over the material), it seems clear that Ignatius is directing some
fire toward Gnostics in the churches (2).
1 Clement
I (Daniel) confess that when asked, “Which of the Apostolic Fathers would
you have included in the New Testament?”, I usually answer without hesita-
tion: 1 Clement. Why? Because this letter is mostly about people getting
along with each other. As I look at the world of Christians squabbling 
with each other, it seems to me that it surely wouldn’t have hurt to have a
stronger message of “Peace, brothers and sisters!” over the centuries. And 
as a wise old friend of mine was fond of saying, “And if it can’t hurt, it’s 
gotta help!”
1 Clement is written in standard letter form and now is divided traditionally
into 65 chapters. However, this breakdown is misleading because the work
isn’t as long as you may think; some of the so-called chapters are only five or
six verses long. Also, 1 Clement is directed to the Christians in Corinth (yes,
the same church addressed by Paul in the New Testament books of 1 and 2
Corinthians . . . apparently a somewhat feisty congregation!).
There’s some controversy over whether the writer of 1 Clement really was
Clement, the historical leader of the Christians in Rome, and even whether
the historical Clement was the second or third Bishop in Rome. Some schol-
ars wonder whether a person of such authority wouldn’t have mentioned
that he had such authority in the course of the letter. The belief that Clement
is the author of this letter is at least as old as the early fourth-century writ-
ings of Eusebius, and one Christian writer — Dionysius of Corinth — claims
Clement as the author in the second century CE. In any case, it’s very possi-
ble that this letter dates from the time of Roman Emperor Domitian (81–96
CE), particularly given the argument of some scholars that the letter may 
be a response to conditions of persecution during Domitian’s reign.
250
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Two reasons 1 Clement is important
Professor Bart Ehrman, who has written extensively on early Christian 
literature, believes that the importance of 1 Clement can be summarized in
the following points:
 The early and heavy use of Hebrew Bible Scripture quotation in
Christian letters, pointing to an early tradition of citing treasured 
religious writings even before there was an official canon
 The presumed importance of the church in Rome as a source of 
leadership and influence over other churches
1 Clement begins by praising the reputation of the church in Corinth and
expressing the writer’s sadness over the disagreements that have arisen —
especially disagreements among younger church members over the older
leadership that arose because of jealousy. The letter then goes through an
interesting series of Hebrew Bible citations of conflicts between characters 
in the Jewish tradition, pointing out how jealousy ruined their relationships
and even endangered lives. The writer follows that up with contemporary
examples, one of which is how jealousy led to the killing of Peter and 
Paul: “Because of jealousy and strife Paul pointed the way to the prize for
endurance. Seven times he bore chains; he was sent into exile and stoned, 
he served as a herald in both the East and the West, and he received the
noble reputation for his faith” (5:5–7).
In a particularly moving section, the writer of 1 Clement advises repentance,
that is, willingness to admit your mistakes in hopes of reconciling with those
you disagree with. 1 Clement reviews another series of episodes of reconcilia-
tion in Hebrew history, including Noah, Abraham, Jonah, and finally Jesus.
Clement’s message for the ages
What’s Clement’s message for the ages? Basically, it’s “Why can’t we all just
get along?” It appears in thoughts like these:
 “We should treat one another kindly, according the compassion and
sweet character of the one who made us.” (14:3)
 “Therefore we should cling to those who keep the peace with piety, not
those who wish for peace out of hypocrisy.” (15:1)
This message is based firmly in the writer’s understanding of the example of
Jesus. 1 Clement’s advice to the leadership is also a strong word of caution,
recognizing that the conflict most likely has two sides:
251
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

For Christ belongs to those who are humble-minded, not to those who 
vaunt themselves over his flock. The scepter of God’s majesty, the Lord 
Jesus Christ, did not come with an ostentatious show of arrogance or
haughtiness — even though he could have done so — but with a humble
mind, just as the Holy Spirit spoke concerning him.
—1 Clement 16:1–2
According to 1 Clement, even the regular patterns of the planets and sun are
signs of the harmony and peacefulness of the cosmos; the sun and moon
don’t interfere with one another (1 Clement 20). Interestingly, the writer even
makes reference to the legend of the Phoenix, the bird that’s reborn in flames
every 500 years! It seems likely that the writer takes this legend quite literally
as a natural example of resurrection and new life.
2 Clement
Some scholars have suggested that 2 Clement is the most under-appreciated
book of the Apostolic Fathers. Perhaps so. Although it’s often called a “letter,”
it doesn’t reveal the standard elements of the letter form and is, in fact, a
speech or sermon. It may be the oldest Christian sermon after the preaching
that’s summarized in the book of Acts in the New Testament. Historians are
equally perplexed about the author; it certainly isn’t Clement, but nobody
knows who else it could be! Finally, no one even knows when 2 Clement was
written, although most guesses place it around 120–170 CE.
Questionable interpretations of Scripture
In general, 2 Clement advises moral behavior based on a large number of ref-
erences to the Hebrew Scriptures and Jesus. However, 2 Clement reveals
some interesting techniques for the interpretation of Scripture — and I rather
doubt that modern readers of the Bible would be entirely happy with what
appears to be somewhat strained interpretations just to make passages rele-
vant for the writer.
Consider the following, which begins with a quotation from the biblical
Prophet Isaiah: “Be jubilant, you who are infertile, and who do not bear chil-
dren! Let your voice burst forth and cry out, you who experience no pains of
labor!” (Isaiah 54:1). In Isaiah, this is most likely a call to anticipate renewal
and restoration of Israelite peoples after going through difficult times. But 
the writer of 2 Clement takes it in a completely different direction: “Now,
when it says, ‘Be Jubilant, you who are infertile and who do not bear chil-
dren’, it is referring to us. For our church was infertile before children were
given to it . . .” (2 Clement 2:1).
252
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The writer isn’t saying, “That verse might be thought to remind us of our 
situation.” Oh no. The writer says, “That old verse was literally talking about
us right now!”
In other words, 2 Clement essentially says that the Hebrew Bible is really a
Christian document because it speaks about Christians and the issues that
Christians face. This interesting aspect of 2 Clement reveals some of the ways
in which Christians made the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) into a
Christian — and therefore not Jewish — book.
A lost teaching of Jesus?
Another fascinating aspect of 2 Clement is that it cites a teaching of Jesus
that is unknown in the Gospels but similar to a Gospel version of the teach-
ing. There’s the Gospel teaching in which Jesus says, “I send you as sheep
among wolves . . .” (Matthew 10:16; Luke 10:3). But 2 Clement records that
Peter actually discussed this idea further:
But Peter replied to him, “What if the wolves rip apart the sheep?” Jesus
said to Peter, “After they are dead, the sheep should fear the wolves no
longer. So too you, do not fear those who kill you and then can do nothing
more to you; but fear the one who, after you die, has the power to cast your
body and soul into the hell of fire.”
—2 Clement 5:2–4
The writing as a whole seems quite obsessed with the notion of repentance
and turning away from sin in this world quickly. 2 Clement carries a strong
notion about judgment coming soon but also an equally strong sense of the
responsibilities of taking care of people in this world. The writer says, “Giving
to charity, therefore, is good as a repentance from sin. Fasting is better than
prayer, but giving to charity is better than both. Love covers a multitude of
sins . . . for giving to charity lightens the load of sin” (16:4).
A final thought on faith and 
doing the right thing
A final thought comes at the end of this sermon: If repentance is so impor-
tant, why do the sinners seem to be doing so well? It seems at first that 2
Clement is giving the standard, stereotypical answer: “They’ll be paid in
heaven,” but then the writer concludes with a profound thought, namely that
this is a matter of faith, not a business transaction! People don’t do the right
thing merely for instant rewards but rather for the simple fact of doing the
right thing! The text is as follows:
253
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered

But neither should this thought disturb you, that we see the unjust becoming
rich while the slaves of God suffer in dire straight. We need to have faith,
brothers and sisters! . . . For if God were to reward the upright immediately,
we would straightaway be engaged in commerce rather than devotion to
God. For we would appear to be upright not for the sake of piety but for 
a profit.
—2 Clement 20:2–4
The Epistle of Barnabas
The Epistle of Barnabas is attributed to a very early Christian leader and
preacher who was often associated with Paul but isn’t considered a genuine
writing of this early Christian. Nevertheless, it’s a very popular early work
and one of the Apostolic Fathers.
It appears that the Epistle is addressed to Christians (or specifically Jewish-
Christians) who wished either to return to Judaism or practice a form of
Christianity that continued to embrace much of Jewish traditional practice
and ritual.
The writing seems to anticipate the rebuilding of the Temple of Jerusalem,
which was destroyed by Romans in 70 CE, and so usually is dated after that
event. It’s also possible that it dates to the early decades of the second cen-
tury when there was some speculation of rebuilding the Temple yet again.
Some historians speculate that a particular event may have incited the strong
anti-Jewish polemics of this writing; possibilities include the Bar Kochba
Revolt of 130–132 CE, in which some Jewish-Christians were persecuted by
Roman officials for suspicion of being involved in the revolt (and perhaps
some were!).
Frankly, historians of Christianity express some relief that the Epistle of
Barnabas wasn’t accepted into the New Testament canon because it contains
a level of anti-Jewish polemics that no doubt would have made Jewish-
Christian relations over the years worse than they already were.
Right off the bat, Barnabas attacks 
traditional Jewish practices
The Epistle begins immediately with an attack on traditional Jewish practices
of sacrifice and fasting, declaring both to be empty actions from a Christian
perspective. To make this point, the writer even quotes Hebrew prophets
who criticize the sacrifice! The Hebrew prophets, like Amos (Amos 5:21–25),
were deeply offended by the abuse of the sacrificial system by wealthy per-
sons who simply wanted to cover over their mistreatment of the poor by
adding more sacrifices rather than actually changing their behavior.
254
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

For the writer, righteous actions are better than sacrifice, and taking care of
the poor is better than fasting (a thought that’s already noted by Hebrew
prophets like Isaiah 58 and Micah 6:7–8). Thus, the writer wants to argue that
God has passed over the Jews in favor of the Christians and attempts to use
the Old Testament to argue his point.
Some historians believe that the last portion of the writing, chapters 17–21,
may have come from another source because it goes in a radically different
direction, taking up the famous “two paths” idea seen in the Didache (see the
earlier section) — the path of light versus the path of darkness.
Revisiting the two paths
As in other early Christian writings, the Epistle contains a discussion of the
two paths: one of righteousness, and one of evil (“the Dark One”; 20:1). The
two are contrasted with all kinds of characteristics of good (be humble,
meek, and gentle) and evil (sexual immorality, killing the unborn, greed), in
the contrast between light and darkness. This form of teaching that radically
contrasts between good and evil, sometimes involving following good angels
and bad angels (see the earlier section “Surveying the Shepherd of Hermas”),
was a typical teaching style of early Christian and Jewish writings.
The Epistle to Diognetus
The Epistle to Diognetus is considered one of the first Christian apologetics,
or defense of Christian faith to a person asking for more information. This old
and common form of Christian writing may come out of authentic answers to
255
Chapter 13: Christian Books That Were Strongly Considered
Barnabas’s bizarre interpretation techniques
The Epistle of Barnabas reveals some very
strained techniques of interpretation. For exam-
ple, in the Old Testament, Abraham is told to cir-
cumcise 318 people (Genesis 14:14). The Epistle
of Barnabas (chapter 9) compares the Greek let-
ters used to write these numbers to the letters
used to spell “Jesus,” therefore taking this Old
Testament passage as a reference to Jesus.
Sometimes these interpretations are quite enter-
taining (Moses commands humans to not eat
pigs because pigs live in luxury and therefore are
examples of laziness and gluttony; chapter 10)
and other times are downright nasty (Jews are
called fools for wanting to rebuild the Temple;
chapter 16). This is hardly an acceptable tech-
nique for interpretation in modern historical
work, but isn’t entirely unusual for ancient argu-
ments. Such techniques were well known in
other documents, even including early Rabbinic
interpretation of Scripture within the context of
early Judaism.

inquiries by real people or simply may be a rhetorical device. This particular
work seems to be dated at the latest to the late-second century, but many
suggest it’s early-second century.
An apologetic is a formal defense of a doctrine. The word comes from the
Greek word “apologia,” which means “in defense of.”
The writer of the Epistle begins with an attack on Roman worship of forms,
idols, and figures, and also explains why Christians aren’t the same as Jews.
The Christian is a sojourner in the world
The most famous exposition in the Epistle to Diognetus is the rather poetic
description of Christians as aliens, or sojourners, in the world. It’s perhaps
intended to be an exposition of the famous words of Jesus to be in the world
but not “of the world” (John 17). Here’s the quote from the Epistle:
They live in their respective countries, but only as resident aliens: they
participate in all things as citizens, and they endure all things as foreigners.
Every foreign territory is a homeland for them, every homeland foreign
territory . . . they live on earth but participate in the life of heaven . . . they
love everyone and are persecuted by all. They are not understood and they
are condemned . . . to put the matter simply, what the soul is in the body,
this is what Christians are in the world . . .
—Epistle to Diognetus 5:5, 5:9, 6:1
The bottom line: Pay attention 
to God’s creation
The writer of the Epistle defends Christianity as a faith that delivered pagan
Greeks and Romans from their former blindness in worshipping empty gods
and suggests that the truth of Christianity can be perceived simply by paying
attention to the majesty of God’s creation. The suggestion that such insights
will result in people taking better care of each other is moving. Here’s the
quote from the Epistle:
For whoever takes up the burden of his neighbor, whoever wants to use his
own abundance to help someone in need, whoever provides for the destitute
from the possessions he has received from God — himself becoming a god
to those who receive them — this one is an imitator of God.
—Epistle to Diognetus 10:6

Traditions about St. Paul
In This Chapter
 Exploring writings attributed to Paul
 Following along on Paul’s adventures in other writings
W
ithout a doubt, the second most important character in the New
Testament after Jesus is Paul of Tarsus, or St. Paul. The two main rea-
sons Paul is so important are:
 His influence is felt in virtually all forms of modern Christian expression.
 A large portion of the New Testament is influenced by his writings, his
work, or his thought.
It comes as no surprise, then, that there are lots of writings dealing with 
Paul — even a few claiming to be written by Paul — that didn’t make it into
the New Testament. In this chapter, we take a look at non-canonical Paul —
both the writings that claim Paul as the author and a few legendary accounts
of Paul’s adventures.
Paul is thought to have written most but not all of the letters (called epistles)
attributed to him in the New Testament. Some writings, like Hebrews, may
have been included in the New Testament because at one time they were
thought to be written by Paul, but modern New Testament scholars are quite
certain that Hebrews and a few others are definitely not from our boy! See the
nearby sidebar, “Arguing about Pauline authorship in the New Testament,”
for more.
So, if letters were written in the name of Paul, but not by Paul, and they’re in
the New Testament anyway, it’s hardly surprising that the practice of writing
Pauline books continued. These writings supposedly by Paul and many about
Paul continued to be produced in the first 500 years of Christianity.

Paul didn’t know Jesus before the crucifixion but rather says that he was
called to be an Apostle (an early follower of Jesus) by a startling vision of the
risen Jesus while on the road to Damascus. Before this vision, Paul was
apparently quite anti-Christian and even presided over persecution of
Christians. After his experience, Paul became one of the most dynamic
preachers and teachers of Christianity in the entire history of the movement!
258
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 
Arguing about Pauline authorship 
in the New Testament
As with many influential writers, confusion sur-
rounds Paul’s writings. Paul is credited with
writing a lot of books in the New Testament; 
virtually all New Testament scholars agree 
that Paul wrote Romans, 1 Corinthians, 1
Thessalonians, Galatians, Philippians, and
Philemon. However, even though all these
works are purported to be written by Paul, most
New Testament scholars are quite adamant that
Paul did not write 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, or 2
Thessalonians; also, he probably (this is less
certain) didn’t write Ephesians or Colossians.
Some New Testament scholars think that one
reason someone would sign another name to a
work is to do that person honor; if you think you
were influenced by someone important, you
may think it’s arrogant to sign your own name
when you think your ideas are basically from
your teacher, so you sign your teacher’s name,
not yours. It’s a perfectly innocent idea but one
that’s likely to cause problems for later genera-
tions who don’t agree that accurate authorship
isn’t important!
Scholars come to these opinions about Paul’s
writings usually based on arguments of Greek
writing style or even content. They argue that
subtle but potentially significant differences
exist between Colossians, for example, and 
1 Corinthians or Romans in terms of religious
arguments. Consider the difference between
the following two passages:
 “Therefore we have been buried with him
by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ
was raised from the dead by the glory of 
the Father, so we too might walk in newness
of life. For if we have been united with him
in a death like his, we will certainly be
united with him in a resurrection like his.”
(Romans 6:4–5)
 “When you were buried with him [Jesus] 
in baptism, you were also raised with him
[Jesus] through faith in the power of 
God, who raised him from the dead.”
(Colossians 2:12)
Did you catch it? In Romans, Paul talks about
how, in the future, we will experience resurrec-
tion like Jesus did. Colossians, however, sug-
gests that a Christian, by becoming a Christian,
has already experienced a raising! Would Paul
have written the Colossians line? Many argue
no and say that he may not have entirely
approved of this idea of a “present experience”
of resurrection, which makes it into a kind of
spiritual experience. Paul probably believed in
an actual resurrection, like Jesus already expe-
rienced, but for us it will be after death and in
the future!
Is this enough to build an argument that
Colossians was written by a different author?
Maybe so . . . but at least you see how these
debates can go.

Later Non-Biblical Letters and 
Writings Attributed to Paul
Paul (shown in a mosaic in Figure 14-1) is most famous for his letters in the
New Testament. They were addressed mostly to churches but sometimes to
an individual (for example, Philemon is in fact a personal letter to an early
Christian named Philemon). As we explain earlier, Pauline letters continued
to be produced after Paul was long gone. Neat trick, eh?
In this section, we look at some of these later letters that were supposedly
written by Paul, even though no one today really believes it. These letters
include one that seems to be basically a patchwork from real letters, another
tradition that consists of correspondence with the Roman philosopher
Seneca, and finally another letter to Corinth!

Chapter 14: Traditions about St. Paul

The Epistle to the Laodicians
The Epistle to the Laodicians consists largely of sentences from genuine
Pauline epistles strung together in a very short letter. It’s no surprise, then,
that it sounds like Paul because most of it is! Consider the following familiar-
sounding phrases:
And his mercy will work in you, that you may have the same love and be of
one mind. Therefore, beloved, as you have heard in my presence, so hold
fast and work in the fear of God, and eternal life will be yours. For it is God
who works in you. And do without hesitation what you do. And for the rest,
beloved, rejoice in Christ and beware of those who are out for sordid gain.
May all your requests be manifest before God and be steadfast in the mind
of Christ. And do what is pure, true, proper, just and lovely. And what you
have heard and received, hold in your heart, and peace will be with you.
—Epistle to the Laodicians 9–16 (tr. Elliott)
Still, this letter has been recognized as a later writing by early Church writers.
The Correspondence of Paul and Seneca
The Correspondence of Paul and Seneca is supposed to be an exchange of
brief letters between Paul and the famous Roman philosopher Seneca (“The
Younger”; 4 BCE–65 CE). However, we have no evidence from the known 
writings of Seneca that he ever carried on such a correspondence, and
frankly, very little of any significance is said between them in this writing,
other than mutual admiration.
That admiration, in itself, was probably the point; it’s possible that the 
writing was intended to show how even a famous Roman respects Paul. But
beyond that, the Correspondence isn’t very thrilling. Seneca, for example,
applauds Paul’s ideas but doesn’t say which thoughts he has in mind or why
he likes them:
These thoughts, I believe, were expressed not by you, but through you;
though sometimes they were expressed both by you and through you; for
they are so lofty and so brilliant with noble sentiments that in my opinion
generations of men could hardly be enough to become established and
perfected in them. I wish you good health, brother.
—Correspondence of Paul and Seneca (tr. Elliott)
Paul, being not terribly modest (an attitude that’s occasionally evident in the
real New Testament Paul), expresses his thanks for the compliments:
260
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

. . . you write somewhere that you are pleased with my letter, and I count
myself fortunate in the approval of a man who is so great. For you, a critic, a
philosopher, the teacher of so great a ruler, nay even of everyone, would not
say this unless you speak the truth. I hope that you may long be in good
health.
—Correspondence of Paul and Seneca (tr. Elliott)
And it goes on rather like this for about 14 short little letters. (Yawn.)
The Later Corinthian Correspondence
The Acts of Paul collections include documents purported to be an exchange
of letters between Paul and the Christians in Corinth. Scholars consider these
letters, called the Later Corinthian Correspondence, an extension of the corre-
spondence in the New Testament — 1 and 2 Corinthians, generally acknowl-
edged to be actual writings of Paul. These letters, however, are latter
creations, associated with these later writings about Paul and not written by
Paul himself.
This collection of letters begins with a letter to Paul about two visitors who
have come to the Corinthian Church teaching ideas that the Corinthians
don’t think are right:
What they say and teach is as follows: They assert that one must not appeal
to the prophets and that God is not almighty, there is no resurrection of 
the body, man has not been made by God, Christ has neither come in the
flesh, nor was he born of Mary, and the world is not the work of God but of
angels . . .
—Later Corinthian Correspondence (tr. Elliott)
Most of these ideas are readily identified with the mystical teachings of
Gnosticism, which we cover in Chapter 12. So, whatever the source of these
purported letters, they’re certainly not from Gnostic Christian writers given
that the letters strongly attack those views.
Paul replies to this letter at some length, affirming traditional and orthodox
views of Jesus being born of Mary, from the line of David, and being raised in
the flesh at his resurrection. Paul also affirms the Old Testament traditions,
especially the Prophets. In short, Paul summarizes:
Turn away from them and keep aloof from their teaching. And those who
say that there is no resurrection of the flesh shall have no resurrection!
—Later Corinthian Correspondence (tr. Elliott)
261
Chapter 14: Traditions about St. Paul

Paul also refers to Jonah as a symbol of Christ’s resurrection (an interpreta-
tion of Jonah that was popular in early Christian folklore).
Legends about Paul
In this chapter, we consider a number of stories that later Christians (after
the first century) began to write about the first followers of Jesus — the
Apostles. But the Apostle Paul is rather special in that he occupies a good
deal of attention in the New Testament (more than any other Apostle), so it’s
hardly surprising that many legends about him arose.
The writings that comprise the Acts of Paul contain numerous themes and
ideas similar to the other later Acts (those of Peter, Thomas, and so on), but
the strong female figures in the other writings aren’t nearly as powerfully por-
trayed as Thecla in the Acts of Paul (see the next section for her story).
These writings have generated a considerable amount of interest because
they suggest that there may well have been strong female leaders in the early
Christian movement — and perhaps even a real Thecla who stands behind
the legends (like there’s a real Paul who stands behind these legends, as
well).
Virtually all this material was known by early Christians to be late and uncon-
nected to Paul, with the possible exception of the Paul and Thecla tradition,
which a few early Christian writers appear to have taken seriously. Modern
historians continue to be fascinated with the story of Thecla, as were ancient
Christians right into the Middle Ages. However, modern historians are in
agreement that this material shouldn’t be taken as anything other than inter-
esting indications of what second to fourth century Christians were thinking
and reading about.
The Acts of Paul and Thecla
The story of St. Paul and his ministry to, and later with, Thecla is one of the
most fascinating pieces of early Acts literature (see Chapter 15 for other Acts
of early Apostles). In fact, the female character Thecla was a very important
person in later Christian art and legend, but it’s unknown if her character in
that usage was based on a real person or entirely a matter of folklore.
The Acts of Paul and Thecla opens with Paul traveling with two non-
Christians, finally arriving in a town where Paul knows a Christian family
headed by Onesiphorus, his children Simmias and Zeno, and wife Lectra.
Obviously, Lectra hasn’t exactly behaved according to Paul’s counsel of 
virginity, but there’s no condemnation of them for being a family:
262
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

. . . after Paul had gone into the house of Onesiphorus there was great joy
and bowing of knees and breaking of bread and word of God about
abstinence and the resurrection. Paul said, “Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God; blessed are those who have kept the flesh chaste, for
they shall become a temple of God; blessed are the continent, for God shall
speak with them; blessed are those who have kept aloof from this world, for
they shall be pleasing to God; blessed are those who have wives as not
having them, for they shall experience God . . .”
—Acts of Paul and Thecla 5 (tr. Elliott, 365)
Paul’s fame becomes a matter of local gossip, and soon many people are
coming to hear him preach, including Thecla, a woman from an elite family
who’s engaged to marry a local nobleman named Thamyris. However,
Thecla’s mother becomes quite worried about her daughter’s interest in the
teachings of Paul, and she contacts Thamyris with the bad news: Thecla is
talking about remaining unmarried! Oh no! When Thamyris investigates, he
finds that Thecla’s mother is right, and he’s furious. Soon, Paul is arrested
and Thamyris is among the accusers:
O proconsul, this man — we do not know where he comes from — makes
virgins averse to marriage!
—Acts of Paul and Thecla 16 (tr. Elliott, 367)
And the trial begins. Paul is imprisoned until the local governor can deter-
mine what to do with him. Meanwhile, Thecla continues to visit Paul in
prison. When she’s dragged into the trial, she states publicly that she refuses
to marry Thamyris, and her own mother condemns her to die for refusing the
marriage! Thecla is condemned to be burned for her refusal, but the attempt
to execute her fails:
. . . the executioners arranged the wood and told her to go up on the pile.
And having made the sign of the cross she went up on the pile. And they
lighted the fire. And though a great fire was blazing it did not touch her. For
God, having compassion upon her, made an underground rumbling, and a
cloud full of water and hail overshadowed the theatre from above, and all
its contents were poured out so that many were in danger of death. And the
fire was put out and Thecla saved.
—Acts of Paul and Thecla 22 (tr. Elliott, 368)
In a subsequent episode, Thecla follows Paul to Antioch where a man named
Alexander attempts to marry Thecla. But she “tore his cloak and pulled off his
crown, and made him a laughing-stock!” Here you see the theme of strong
female characters in this later Christian folklore literature. Thecla is not intimi-
dated! For her attack and refusal to marry, she’s condemned to be fed to wild
beasts in a theatre. Even though she is befriended by a high-placed noble-
woman named Queen Tryphaena, Thecla’s sentence is still to be carried out.
263
Chapter 14: Traditions about St. Paul

When Thecla faces the wild beasts, however, the first creature — a lioness —
roars out of her cage only to lie at the woman’s feet. When next a bear tries to
attack her, the lioness kills it. Finally, the lioness confronts a lion, they’re both
killed, and Thecla mourns the death of her protector, the lioness. She jumps
into a pool of water filled with dangerous “seals” in order to baptize herself.
Because no animals seem able to kill her, Alexander (the second man she
refused to marry) demands that he be allowed to release bulls to kill her. But
when Queen Tryphaena faints and people believe she has died, Alexander
calls a halt to the event.
The Governor, however, is impressed with all these events and asks Thecla to
explain why no animals will touch her. She replies:
I am a servant of the living God and, as to what there is about me, I have
believed in the Son of God in whom he is well pleased; that is why not one
of the beasts touched me. For he alone is the goal of salvation and the basis
of immortal life. For he is a refuge to the tempest-tossed, a solace to the
afflicted, a shelter to the despairing; in brief, whoever does not believe in
him shall not live but be dead forever.
—Acts of Paul and Thecla 37 (tr. Elliott, 371)
The Governor releases Thecla to the joyful shouts of many women who came
to the theatre in her support. Queen Tryphaena converts to Christianity and
takes Thecla home for a rest, and later she heavily supports the poor and the
Christian ministry of Thecla. Thecla goes to visit Paul, who’s astonished to
see her alive and well, but Thecla soon returns to her homeland where she
“enlightened many by the word of God” and eventually “rested in a glorious
sleep.” So ends the story of Paul and Thecla.
Further Acts episodes and travels
Further descriptions of Paul’s travels and miracles come after the Thecla
material. Included in this material is the Third Epistle to the Corinthians, and
then the Acts of Paul carry right on! In one fascinating episode, Paul is pray-
ing with fellow Christians in Corinth when he hears two prophets who stand
and deliver messages. At first, a male prophet announces that Paul is going to
be martyred. This news distresses everyone (Paul included!) until a second
prophet, a woman named Myrta, rises and assures them all that God has a
wonderful plan for Paul in Rome and that many will be saved because of his
ministry. At this reassuring word, Paul and others rejoice.
What’s fascinating about this episode, of course, is the window it provides
into a Christian service where messages from Prophets are part of the 
gathering — suggesting that this story may be an accurate portrayal of these
kinds of early Christian gatherings and the hearing of Prophets among the
people.
264
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The Martyrdom of Paul
Among the Acts of Paul literature is a striking description of the last days of
Paul in the writing the Martyrdom of Paul. Having arrived in Rome, Paul is told
of the death of a young man named Patroclus, who was even known to Caesar
Nero. Paul leads the Christians in prayer for his life, and the boy rises to life.
Nero is stunned to see the boy alive, and the following conversation reveals
the strong political orientation of some of this literature:
“Patroclus, are you alive?” He answered, I am alive, Caesar. But he said,
“Who is he who made you alive?” And the boy, uplifted by the confidence of
faith, said, “Christ Jesus, the king of the ages.” The emperor asked in
dismay, “Is he to be king of the ages and destroy all kingdoms?” Patroclus
said to him, “Yes, he destroys all kingdoms under heaven, and he alone
shall remain in all eternity, and there will be no kingdom which escapes
him.” And he [Nero] struck his face and cried out, “Patroclus, are you also
fighting for that king?” He answered, “Yes my lord and Caesar, for he has
raised me from the dead!”
—Martyrdom of Paul 2 (tr. Elliott, 386)
Nero is obviously frightened by the power of Paul and the Christians and is
horrified to discover that some among his own guard and soldiers have
become followers of Jesus. He promptly has them executed, acting in pre-
cisely the tyrannical manner that history has judged the real Nero to have
lived. Finally, Paul appears before Nero, who condemns Paul to be beheaded
(the form of capital punishment for Roman citizens, who weren’t crucified or
tortured). After Paul is beheaded, however, his spirit is seen praying with
other Christians, and more members of Nero’s guard become Christians as a
result of seeing Paul’s spirit. So ends the account.
The Apocalypse of Paul
The Apocalypse of Paul is a major writing that’s more widely known than
another, short apocalyptic writing from the Nag Hammadi Library that’s
clearly Gnostic (we look at it briefly in Chapter 12). The Apocalypse is quite
lengthy, but unlike many apocalyptic writings, it’s not terribly difficult to
understand. In fact, we sometimes wish that some of it was difficult to under-
stand given that the sections of “judgment on sinners” can get both graphic
and, well, rather mean-spirited.
Why write an Apocalypse that claims to be from Paul? Because Paul had 
serious apocalyptic interests (see 1 Corinthians 15, for example) and even
refers in the New Testament to a vision that he either learned about or expe-
rienced for himself. Consider this excerpt, and note that 2 Corinthians 12:6–7
suggests that Paul is the visionary in question:
265
Chapter 14: Traditions about St. Paul

It is necessary to boast; nothing is to be gained by it, but I will go on to
visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a person in Christ who fourteen
years ago was caught up to the third heaven — whether in the body or out of
the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person —
whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows — was
caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no
mortal is permitted to repeat.
—2 Corinthians 12:1–4
The Apocalypse of Paul was written with this famous passage from
Corinthians firmly in mind. But how early is the Apocalypse writing? In his
1924 edition of English translations of much of the early Christian apocryphal
books, Professor James notes that the first certain reference to this writing is
from St. Augustine (354–430 CE), who dismissed it as a forgery. Apparently,
however, it was popular among early monks, which makes sense because
their particular lifestyle is praised in many aspects of this writing.
One of the interesting aspects of this writing is that it begins with a later
monk (perhaps from the fourth century) having a vision while living in the
same house as Paul in Tarsus (modern Turkey). In this vision, the monk is
told to tear into the foundation of the house, where he finds a box. He opens
the box to reveal a writing left by Paul. Most ancient writings rarely describe
their own discovery, so this is a rather interesting beginning (and suggests
that the writing can’t be later than the fourth century).
God speaks to the sun, moon, stars, and ocean
The writing from Paul is described in great detail, beginning with a series of con-
versations between God and the sun, moon, stars, and ocean. Each says to God
that it’s sick and tired of watching humans screw up their lives (and their eter-
nal fate) so badly, and each asks why God doesn’t let them use their powers and
teach humans a lesson. Each time, God answers in the same way — “I know
what they are doing” — but assures the sun, moon, stars, and ocean that God
wants to be patient, “. . . until they [humans] are converted and repent”
(Apocalypse of Paul 6, tr. Duesnsing and Otero, Schneemelcher, II, 717).
The earth explains how it’s especially depressing to watch what happens at
sunset:
For at that hour all the angels go to the Lord to worship him and bring
before him all the deeds of men, whether good or evil, which each of them
does from morning until evening. And one angel goes forth rejoicing from
the man he indwells but another goes with sad face . . .
—Apocalypse of Paul 7 (ed. Schneemelcher, 718)
266
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

This notion that Creation watches the sins of humanity is a rare theme in
apocalyptic literature and may well be inspired from Paul’s famous words in
Romans:
For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of
God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the
will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set
free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of
the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in
labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have
the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the
redemption of our bodies.
—Romans 8:19–23
As Paul watches, angels come to God with good news about the good people
they’re in charge of watching over. But after the angels are finished, “other
angels who were weeping came into the meeting,” and they report the bad
news and beg to be released from their duties of watching such sinners! God
tells them the same thing that God told the sun, moon, and stars: “You must
serve them until they are converted and repent, but if they do not return to
me, I shall judge them” (Apocalypse of Paul 10, ed. Schneemelcher, 719).
At this point, Paul is escorted to the third part of heaven where he witnesses
a group of particularly nasty-looking angels whom he’s told are angels of 
punishment, “appointed for the souls of the wicked” (Apocalypse of Paul 11,
Schneemelcher, 719). Immediately after this, however, he sees glorious, 
shining angels and is told: “These are the angels of righteousness: They are
sent to lead in the hour of their need the souls of the righteous who believed
God was their helper!” (Apocalypse of Paul 12, ed. Schneemelcher, 720).
Paul sees the process of judgment
Paul asks to see how the process of judgment actually takes place in an indi-
vidual case, and he’s taken to view a kind of trial (which could have been the
inspiration for the Albert Brooks movie Defending Your Life):
And the angel said to me: This man whom you see is righteous. And again 
I looked and I saw all his deeds which he had done for the sake of the name
of God; and all his desires, which he remembered and which he did not
remember, all of them stood before him in the hour of need . . . the wicked
found no dwelling in him, but the holy had power over his soul, directing it
until it left the body . . .
—Apocalypse of Paul 14 (ed. Schneemelcher, 720)
Paul even sees evil angels appear and demand to examine the soul for signs
of their evil handiwork! They’re anguished, however, that they missed a right-
eous soul: “How did this soul escape us! It did the will of God on earth!”
(Apocalypse of Paul 14:30, ed. Schneemelcher, 721).
267
Chapter 14: Traditions about St. Paul

The next scene is another individual trial, this time of someone who’s judged
to be unredeemed and evil. The book works like this — contrasting good with
evil, light against dark, going back and forth between rewards for the good
and punishment for the bad. In this case, Paul is told to watch the trial of:
. . . a soul which has provoked the Lord day and night by saying: I know
nothing other than this world: I eat and drink and enjoy what is in the world.
For who has gone down into the underworld and coming up has told us that
there is a judgment there?
—Apocalypse of Paul 14–15 (tr. Elliott, 625)
The evil angels relish this trial: “Yes! . . . you belong wholly to us!” (Apocalypse
of Paul 16, ed. Schneemelcher, 722). When this soul pleads with God, God says:
“You showed no mercy in your life, why should I now show mercy to you?
Confess your sin!” (Apocalypse of Paul 17, ed. Schneemelcher, 723).
The soul makes the mistake of saying that he didn’t sin in his life. Oops, that’s
the wrong thing to say to God in heaven! God replies:
Do you think that you are still living in the world where each of you sins and
conceals it and hides it from his neighbor? Here, however, nothing is hidden!
—Apocalypse of Paul 17 (ed. Schneemelcher, 723)
What’s particularly interesting (and frankly, a bit troubling) in this scene is
that this evil soul is shown the souls of all the people he wronged during his
life! Not a pretty picture.
Paul visits the dwelling places of the righteous and sinners
After the long series of conversations regarding judgment, Paul is escorted 
to the second heaven (one level down, we suppose). Here, he’s shown the
dwelling place of the righteous. It’s a glorious and shining land, so wonderful
that even the good people say, “Why did we utter a word from our mouth to
irritate our neighbor for even a single day?” (Apocalypse of Paul 22, ed.
Schneemelcher, 726). Paul is curious, however, and asks his angelic host to
see more.
He’s led to Lake Acherusia, where he’s shown the City of Christ. Paul gets a
tour of the city and sees righteous people and their dwelling places as well as
the various features of the surrounding walls and towers. Here, Paul is intro-
duced to famous people of the Bible, such as the Patriarchs of the Old
Testament, the Prophets, and even all the infants that King Herod ordered
killed (according to Matthew 2:16) when he tried to eliminate the young
Jesus. The Apocalypse of Paul describes more of the various sights of the
City until Paul’s escort takes him to “the other place.”
268
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Paul is shown a river of fire: Some people are immersed up to their knees,
some up to their navels, others to their lips, and others up to the hair! There
follows a gruesome description of the various sins committed by those who
have these various “levels” of punishment and suffering. Some are being pun-
ished for sexual sins (adultery and fornication figure rather prominently in
these descriptions) and others are punished for lack of mercy and compas-
sion on the poor.
Especially interesting, however, are the horrific punishments meted out to
Church leaders who didn’t properly conduct their offices or their lives even
though they were part of the Church. In these descriptions (divided into 
particular Church offices, such as deacon, elder, and so on), you hear the
writer’s serious protests against corruption in the Church (according to 
his view) from the period of the fourth century.
Paul continues his “tour of terror” — the Apocalypse even identifies punish-
ments for somewhat unexpected sins like breaking one’s fast before the
appointed hour — and you can get a general idea of the narrative from the
following:
And again I saw there men and women set with lacerated hands and feet
and naked in a place of ice and snow, and worms consumed them. And
when I saw it I wept and asked: “Who are these, sir?” And he said to me:
“They are those who harmed orphans and widows and the poor, and did not
hope in the Lord; therefore they pay their own particular penalty
unceasingly.”
—Apocalypse of Paul 39 (ed. Schneemelcher, 732)
All in all, Paul’s tour is pretty scary stuff, which is, of course, precisely the
point of this kind of literature. Paul’s reaction to all he sees is hardly pride or
arrogant enjoyment of punishment. In fact, Paul weeps bitterly at the fate of
the condemned; he weeps so much that the Angel asks him, “Are you more
compassionate than the one who made them? These people chose their fate!”
(Apocalypse of Paul 40, ed. Schneemelcher, 734).
Paul meets biblical figures
Paul eventually meets more biblical characters, including Mother Mary,
whose conversation with Paul in this writing is particularly interesting, given
that they never met in real life. Because this story is a vision of the human
Paul, Mary advises him to be patient because he will come back to heaven
soon enough! Paul then meets and greets a series of biblical characters,
including Moses and Adam. The work abruptly ends after the brief encounter
with Adam, suggesting to many modern historians that the Apocalypse of
Paul is missing its actual ending.
269
Chapter 14: Traditions about St. Paul

Not much in the Apocalypse of Paul reflects the actual historical Paul, any of
his writings, or even much of his life as it’s known from his own writings and
the biblical Acts of the Apostles. Finally, there’s no early tradition that Paul
wrote such a work; a tradition surely would have arisen very early if Paul did
in fact compose such a work. For these reasons, scholars consider it to be
clearly a later work of imaginative authors.

T
he biblical book of Acts of the Apostles is a kind of historical narrative that
describes some of the stories of early followers of Jesus after the death,
resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. But the book of Acts in the Bible is a bit
miserly with information about all the disciples. It talks some about Stephen,
a bit more about Peter, less about James, and a lot about Paul. But the fact
that there were other disciples, too, begs the inevitable question: What 
happened to them?
Among the early Christians were some creative writers who were more than
up to the task of answering that question. Acts of Thomas, Acts of Andrew, Acts
of Matthew, and Acts of Peter are their writings about more of Jesus’s disciples,
and it seems that books may have been written about other disciples as well.
There were even further Acts of Paul, but we deal with those in Chapter 14,
which focuses on this central early Christian preacher and teacher.
For the most part, these Acts works are rather late — third century and after —
which is one reason they wouldn’t have been considered for the Bible.
However, they may be based on some older legends. Figuring out if any of
these stories are based on actual events in the lives of the Apostles is tricky
business indeed! There may be some genuine memories behind some of the
fanciful stories — such as Thomas actually going to India — but beyond that,
many of these stories appear to be for pious entertainment and “edification” 
(a fancy word that basically amounts to calling it “feel good” fiction!).
This chapter provides you with some information on this type of Acts litera-
ture and then discusses the various Acts stories that took their lead from the
more widely known biblical book Acts of the Apostles.

Getting a Handle on Acts Literature
Clearly modeled on the New Testament book of Acts (also called Acts of the
Apostles), these later Acts books share a number of interesting similarities
even if they deal with different Apostles. It’s a bit of a mystery why these 
few Apostles were chosen — and perhaps there are others that are now 
completely lost — but the fact that these Apostles have these Acts books
may suggest that some stories circulated about these specific Apostles very
early on.
Necessary style characteristics of Acts lit
In some ways, Acts books are almost the same thing as a Gospel, except that
they aren’t about Jesus! Acts aren’t really biographies because they don’t
really talk about birth and development of the Apostles. They aren’t really
just teaching books, either, because they do tell stories about the adventures
of their Apostle subjects. In fact, the closest analogy to these Acts writings
are the saint stories in the later Catholic and Orthodox Christian traditions;
they’re pious stories meant to both entertain and edify, or carry spiritual
messages for the reader. We think the best way to really appreciate these sto-
ries is to imagine a group of young children (probably not too young) sitting
around an elder Christian man or woman who is telling them stories of the
first followers of Jesus. As you read the stories, imagine the eyes of the 
children getting bigger during the “scary” parts, hear the laughter during 
the charming parts, and even feel the sadness during the descriptions of
courageous death and martyrdom.
Although the Acts writings are certainly innocent enough as a kind of
Christian “pious folklore” and entertainment, early heresy hunters like
Epiphanius were concerned lest anyone take any of this material too seri-
ously, and therefore the works were condemned.
The criticism and condemnation is no surprise when you take into considera-
tion the Encratitic (see the sidebar, “Encratitic ideas: Going extreme” for
more on this concept) and “anti-physical” character of some of the stories.
These tendencies would have raised suspicion of even more serious heresy
like Gnosticism.
However, we suggest that the Encratitic elements of the stories are really the
only jarring aspects of what otherwise can be read with great enjoyment.
They’re really very entertaining stories, and it’s easy to see why they were
popular. Some of the events mentioned in these writings even turn up later in
medieval religious plays performed for audiences in villages and cities
throughout medieval southern Europe (especially France, Spain, and a bit in
England).
272
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Who wrote these stories?
The documents we look at in this chapter have some interesting similarities;
they’re so similar, in fact, that a tradition arose rather early that one man,
Leucius Charinus, wrote them all. Leucius is the original author proposed for all
the more famous Apocryphal Acts: Acts of Paul (see Chapter 12), Acts of Peter,
Acts of John, Acts of Andrew, and Acts of Thomas. Although not a biblical name,
Charinus was associated with John the Apostle as early as the ninth century CE.
Contemporary scholars doubt that one person actually wrote all these works,
but interesting parallels between the works make it clear why this idea of a
common author arose:
 All the writings have a strong streak of Encratitism, which refers to the
tendency to condemn all forms of sexual activity even among married
persons. This could have been a tendency among many Christians who
273
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders
Encratitic ideas: Going extreme
Encratitic ideas are associated with Christians
who believe that any form of sexual activity —
even within marriage — is improper. Fun bunch,
right? But how early does this strange notion
appear? Does 1 Timothy 4:1–5 in the New
Testament (often erroneously attributed to St.
Paul) already speak of those who deny marriage
and sexuality? Does 1 Corinthians 7 suggest that
Paul is already facing these ideas at the church
in Corinth? Whether or not it’s an idea among
very early Christians, we certainly know that the
writings of the Church father Clement of
Alexandria (d. 215 CE) begin to speak about an
early “heresy” associated with the denial of
sexual activity, even for married people.
This way of thinking is often associated with
Gnosticism and other movements that denied
the goodness of the material world and the
physical creations. Sexuality seems to have
been a particularly troubling issue for many
early Christians who thought that any and all
sexual activity was giving in to evil desires and
lust. In contrast, Orthodox Christianity affirmed
marriage and married sexuality and refused to
go along with any condemnation of the physical
world as inherently evil.
In its ultimate expression, a Gnostic-type denial
of the “redemption” of the physical could
amount to a denial that Christ was ever really
human because, in their view, if Christ became
human (that is, “physical”) he would have had
an “unholy” involvement with the physical
world. The idea that Jesus only appeared to be
human, but never was, is known as docetism.
Orthodox Christianity may have had lots of argu-
ments about how Jesus could be fully human
and fully God, but it always presumed that he
was both, in some mysterious way.
In later Christian history, despite being con-
demned as heretical, Encratitic ideas occa-
sionally reappear. For example, among the
Russian Christian sects known as the Skoptsky
(literally, “castrates”), some members actually
cut off their sexual organs; less drastic, the
Shaker sect of early American history denied
sexuality entirely for its members (which even-
tually led, as you can imagine, to the movement
dying out).

went to extremes on this idea, or it could have been the work of a partic-
ular early group of Christians who advocated somewhat extreme ideas
(Paul dealt with some of these folks in 1 Corinthians 7).
 All the stories feature spectacular miracles performed with such ease
that they seem almost mundane!
 Almost all the stories feature spiritual conflict between the hero of the
story and evil opponents (often Roman officials).
The similarities among these works probably result from the fact that they all
were written according to an accepted style for these kinds of writings. The
style was based very loosely on the style of the biblical (and older) Acts of
the Apostles, although these stories exceed the biblical book in drama and
impressive accomplishments.
The Acts of Andrew
A variety of texts that feature Andrew as the main character are grouped
together in a kind of family of writings. The following works are collectively
read together as the Acts of Andrew:
 The Acts of Andrew
 The Acts of Andrew and Matthias
 The Acts of Peter and Andrew
 The Acts of Andrew and Paul
In this section, we briefly summarize the various stories that make up the
Acts of Andrew and touch on various ideas presented in the writings that
differ from Orthodox Christianity.
It’s difficult to determine which events and which stories in the Acts of
Andrew are the oldest. The oldest actual reference to writings now known as
the Acts was in the early Church father Eusebius’s writings from the fourth
century CE. (He makes it very clear that he does not like the writings.) For
our purposes, however, we summarize the various texts that are collectively
read together as the Acts of Andrew without worrying about which stories
are older.
274
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Andrew, Stratocles, and Maximilla
In the Acts of Andrew, you’re first introduced to Stratocles (pronounced strat-
oh-clees), the brother of Aegeates (pronounced egg-ee-ah-tees), who’s mar-
ried to Maximilla. Stratocles is terribly worried about a servant who has
become sick, but Maximilla tells her brother-in-law not to worry because
there’s a holy man in town (our hero, Andrew!). As Andrew arrives at the villa
of the wealthy citizens, he immediately senses a spiritual struggle going on
inside:
On entering the gate, Andrew says, “Some force is fighting inside; hurry
brothers!” Without asking questions, he bursts inside to find the servant
foaming at the mouth, entirely contorted.
Maximilla and her friends tell Stratocles, “Now you’re going to see something
pretty cool” (our paraphrase, sorry . . .). Andrew demands that the demon
leave the servant, and voilá! The demon promptly obeys Andrew’s command.
Stratocles is clearly impressed, and Andrew gives a long speech with interest-
ing imagery. Instead of speaking of Stratocles “converting” in conventional
terms, Andrew says that there’s a new person trying to be born within
Stratocles and that Andrew wishes to be a kind of midwife to the birth of a
new person (odd language, perhaps, but you get the point). In short,
Stratocles becomes a follower of Andrew and a Christian, and the other
Christians seem quite pleased with this new convert from the upper class!
The conversion of the upper class wasn’t unusual, but it was a cause for
some concern among other Romans. It seems they tolerated the religious
notions of the slaves, women, and foreigners — but when Christianity began
to make inroads in the upper class, it immediately appeared on the radar
screen of the elite, and that often meant trouble. In these stories, conversions
and miracles often stir up the anger of local authorities. It seems that this
reaction is a true-to-life theme in these stories.
This idyllic scene is interrupted by the arrival of the evil tyrant Aegeates. He
doesn’t notice the Christians who have gathered in the villa because it’s clear
that he has one thing in mind — sleeping with his wife Maximilla! When
Aegeates seeks her out, he doesn’t realize that she’s at prayer:
Rescue me at last from Aegeates filthy intercourse and keep me pure and
chaste, giving service only to you, my God . . .
—Acts of Andrew 14
275
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

A tired Aegeates doesn’t push the issue and sleeps. Maximilla seeks advice
from Andrew, who prays that she be delivered from “this disgusting pollu-
tion” of married sex. Maximilla makes a servant girl named Euclia up to look
like herself in order to sexually service Aegeates for a number of days. Euclia
begins to make demands for money and jewelry, and she brags to other ser-
vants. Aegeates finally gets wind of all this and punishes Euclia severely —
still wanting to preserve Maximilla’s reputation. However, Aegeates is pretty
angry about Maximilla’s refusal to sleep with him, and he soon discovers that
it all traces back to the religious teacher Andrew. Andrew is imprisoned,
much to the people’s anguish, but the prison gates are miraculously opened
when visitors come to see him. Andrew continues to meet with visitors,
including Maximilla, but he never actually leaves the prison. The book fea-
tures Andrew’s rather long (and often a bit tedious) speeches telling
Maximilla not to succumb to Aegeates’s demands to sleep with him.
Throughout these various speeches and prison orations, Andrew seems in
perfect control of events and intent on martyrdom. Despite threats from
Aegeates, Andrew refuses to encourage Maximilla to sleep with her husband.
Aegeates considers his options to kill Andrew (inspired, the writing suggests,
by “his father, the Devil!”). Finally, Andrew reveals to his followers that Jesus
has shown him that he is to die by impalement on a stake.
The first time that Andrew is taken for execution, Stratocles beats up the
armed guards in order to release Andrew! He implies that he would have
killed them if Andrew had not stopped him:
Thank the blessed one for educating me and teaching me to check my
violent temper. Otherwise, I would have demonstrated for you what
Stratocles and Aegeates the rogue are capable of!
—Acts of Andrew 52–53
Andrew explains that his followers shouldn’t be so concerned about his
impending death, and he even laughs at Stratocles’s lack of understanding. 
(A common Gnostic theme is derisive laughter when someone doesn’t prop-
erly understand something.) Andrew then explains that death will be the
wonderful release of his soul and insists that his crucifixion proceed.
Andrew’s miracles cause social unrest
In another of the Acts of Andrew writings, Andrew heals a soldier of a demon,
and the soldier immediately puts away his military clothing and weapons and
tells Andrew that he wishes to “acquire the uniform of your God.” His fellow
soldiers warn him that he’ll be punished, but the former soldier and now 
follower of Andrew tells his mates to consider the power of Andrew:
276
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

O ignorant ones, do you not see what kind of man this is? For he has no
sword in his hand nor any weapon of war and yet these great miracles are
performed by him . . .
—Acts of Andrew (tr. Elliott, 271)
Other stories of Andrew
In addition to individual writings, a summary of other Andrew writings is pro-
vided by Gregory of Tours (a Gallo-Roman historian of the sixth century); it
summarizes other miracles and adventures in texts that no longer exist.
Among the stories is an interesting piece about Andrew in the town of
Thessalonica (the church that received what’s known as 1 Thessalonians, the
first famous letter from Paul in the New Testament). When soldiers approach
Andrew to take him prisoner for preaching against the local temples and
idols, one of the soldiers falls dead. Andrew raises him to life again to prove
God’s power, but the officer in charge isn’t impressed. He puts Andrew in a
stadium and releases a wild boar to attack him, but the boar doesn’t touch
Andrew. The soldiers try to whip a bull into killing Andrew, but the bull turns
on the soldiers, kills many of them, and then falls dead. Then the proconsul
sends a leopard to attack Andrew, but the leopard kills the proconsul’s son!
Andrew promptly raises the son back to life, at which point the proconsul
goes home defeated.
Acts of Andrew and Matthias
In a text among the Andrew traditions, called the Acts of Andrew and Matthias
(perhaps referring to Matthew), Matthias is sent to a city of cannibals called
Myrmidonia. When Matthias is captured, he’s fed for 30 days in preparation
for being eaten, but then Jesus appears to Andrew and tells him to go save
Matthias.
Andrew takes friends and heads out to find a boat to sail to Matthias’s rescue.
But the hired boat has some rather strange crewmen — it turns out that the
captain is Jesus in disguise. He carries on interesting conversations with
Andrew along the way. When a storm comes up, the disguised Jesus even
tells Andrew to reassure his friends in the boat by telling them stories about
Jesus:
If you are indeed a disciple of the one called Jesus, tell your disciples the
miracles your teacher did so that their souls may rejoice and that they may
forget the terror of the sea . . .
—Acts of Andrew and Matthias 8
277
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

Jesus the disguised boatman quizzes Andrew about various stories of Jesus,
and there’s a delightful scene in which Andrew tells the boatman that if
Andrew were to tell the boatman all the mysteries that Jesus revealed to
Andrew, “you would not be able to endure them!” The irony is rich, and the
way in which such stories could be made into Christian folklore plays in later
medieval European traditions is patently obvious. There are moments of very
impressive storytelling in these narratives.
Andrew arrives in time to free Matthias and over 100 other prisoners that
were to be eaten as well, and he foils the townspeople’s attempts to kill their
victims. Finally, Andrew reveals himself to them, and they torture him horri-
bly. Each time, however, Andrew is healed. Finally, a flood overtakes the city
and many people are drowned. In the end, Andrew raises all the victims from
the dead, and the entire town converts to Christianity, builds a church, and
begs Andrew to stay and teach them.
Acts of Peter and Andrew
In the Acts of Peter and Andrew, a rather interesting story takes place where
Peter and Andrew are engaged in a kind of debate with a wealthy man named
Onesiphorus. When Onesiphorus wants to know the secret of Peter’s and
Andrew’s power, Andrew says that Onesiphorus must abandon his wife and
possessions. He’s angry at this, and when Peter quotes Jesus to say, “It is
easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter heaven” (Matthew 19:24), Onesiphorus can’t believe his ears! It seems
impossible! Here’s where the story gets interesting.
Peter gets a needle, places it on the ground, and then commands a camel to
walk through the eye of the needle. According to the story, “The eye opened
like a gate and the camel passed through; and a second time, at Peter’s 
bidding . . .” (The Acts of Peter and Andrew 18-19, tr. Elliott, 301). Although it’s
questionable whether this literal interpretation is what Jesus had in mind,
the demonstration does make for a great story!
This episode is interesting for another reason: It suggests how some of these
legends began as interpretations or parables that arose when discussing and
teaching the sayings of Jesus — rather like a sermon illustration in a good
Sunday morning sermon!
The Acts of John
The work referred to as the Acts of John is a composition of a variety of
ancient and medieval texts. When the story opens, John has arrived in
Ephesus (the city where very early Christian traditions suggest that the
actual Apostle John died). A man identified as a “commander in chief,”
278
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Lycomedes, begs John to heal his wife Cleopatra (not an uncommon name in
the ancient world, of course). John goes to heal Cleopatra, but Lycomedes is
so overcome with anxiety about his wife that he dies. John brings the raised
Cleopatra into the next room and proceeds to raise Lycomedes from the
dead! Lycomedes is so overcome with appreciation that he not only supports
John’s ministry but also hires a painter to produce a painting of the Apostle.
When John sees the final portrait, he has the opportunity to make an interest-
ing little speech about Jesus as the great painter:
[Jesus] who paints us all for himself, who knows the colors which I bid you
use are: belief in God, knowledge, fear of God, love, fellowship, meekness,
goodness, brotherly love, chastity, integrity, firmness, fearlessness,
cheerfulness, honesty . . .
—Acts of John 29
But John, who (it says) has never seen an image of himself, says that the real
painting is childish and imperfect — a painting that is a “dead picture of what
is dead.” This is a faintly Gnostic sense of denying the significance of the
material world. (Too bad, because otherwise the idea of Jesus as the “great
painter of life” is a rather charming idea).
John goes on to preach lengthy sermons in which Gnostic ideas are even
more evident. For example, John talks about times when he touched Jesus
only to discover that Jesus’s body wasn’t normal:
Sometimes when I meant to touch him, I met a material and solid body; and
at other times again when I felt him, the substance was immaterial and
bodiless and as if it were not existing at all . . .
—Acts of John 93
John also describes a strange ritual in which Jesus tells his disciples to make
a circle around him as he sings a strange song:
Now we give thanks, I say:
I will be loosed, and I will loose. Amen.
I will be pierced, and I will pierce. Amen.
I will be born, and I will bear. Amen.
I will eat, and I will be eaten. Amen. . . .
The whole universe takes part in the dancing. Amen.
He who does not dance, does not know what is being done. Amen.
—Acts of John 95–96
These lines suggest that Jesus emphasizes the mysterious over the obvious —
the spiritual over the material. Gnosticism relished these puzzles that suggest
that there’s more to life than the obvious, and they enjoyed the test of wits
and strange language that’s open to mystical interpretations. It may even sug-
gest actual rituals to accompany such language!
279
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

The writing then goes into an even longer description of various names for
God, Jesus, and references to the cross. Jesus explains that he actually wasn’t
on the cross:
Therefore I have suffered none of the things which they will say of me: that
suffering which I showed to you and to the rest in dance, I wish to be called
a mystery . . .
—Acts of John 101
After these long speeches from John, the stories about him resume (although
they too feature speeches!). At Ephesus, which was actually famous for the
cult of Artemis, John destroys the Idol of Artemis, and the pagan Temple
begins to fall apart, killing a priest inside the grounds. Eventually, John raises
the Priest from the dead, and the Priest becomes a disciple of John.
There follows a series of events including an interesting episode when John
returns to Ephesus for another visit. John hires a room for himself and the
others with him, but the beds are full of bugs! John commands the bugs to
“be considerate, and leave your home for this night . . .” and like in a Disney
film, they obey and crawl out, only to return when John and his gang leave
the room!
Finally, there’s a very odd episode in which a beautiful woman named
Drusiana, wife of Andronicus, dies. John delivers a speech basically saying
that she’s at rest and no longer in danger of being sexually active! In the
meantime, a man named Callimachus, who was aflame with sexual desire for
Drusiana, bribes a servant to let him and his servant into her tomb. He pre-
pares to sexually use her corpse, stating that what she refused in life, he can
take in death. But both Callimachus and his servant are killed by a snake, and
they remain in the tomb for three days. Meanwhile, John and Andronicus go
to visit the tomb to pay their respects . . . only to discover that Drusiana’s
body isn’t alone. John raises Drusiana and Callimachus, who confesses his
sin. John also raises the servant, who refuses belief in the God of John and
eventually dies a horrible death as a sinner! This very bizarre story provides
an opportunity for still more long speeches from John about spiritual reali-
ties and the true nature of Christian faith.
Professor J. K. Elliott points out in his translation of the Acts of John that an
early Christian writer named Nicephorus produced what’s called a stichome-
try. A stich is a line of writing, so a stichometry amounts to a work in which
Nicephorus actually counted lines of text. Because Nicephorus says that the
original Acts of John consisted of 2,500 lines, and because that many lines no
longer exist for scholars to study, Elliott suggests that about two-thirds of the
original work has survived. Over the years, scholars and historians have tried
to reproduce the original work, so the work that Elliott translates for modern
readers is a composition from a variety of ancient and medieval texts.

The Acts of Peter
It hardly comes as a surprise that early Christians were curious about the
other main Apostle of the first group: Peter (see Figure 15-1 for just one of
many artistic renderings of this great figure in Christianity). So, legends about
the famous Peter were also written, gathered together, and passed on.
Because Peter later became the basis for the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), sto-
ries about Peter are particularly interesting even if they aren’t historical.
There are longer and shorter works that talk about Peter, and scholars argue
which part belongs with which part — but that doesn’t really stop us from
reading them with great appreciation.
Note: Because there’s some discussion about how the Acts of Peter originally
read, and because there are various versions of the text, we’ve chosen to
summarize the texts as presented in Professor Elliott’s translations.

Peter and his objection to 
his daughter’s sexuality
One of the traditions associated with the Acts of Peter collections is a story
about Peter’s paralyzed daughter. (A version of this same story appears in
the Nag Hammadi Library, which we mention in Chapter 12.)
Peter goes about his work of healing many people, but a few concerned crit-
ics ask him why he doesn’t heal his own daughter. They question whether or
not he can actually do it. Good questions, right?
Peter heals her to demonstrate that he can, after which she reverts to her
previous state. Peter then explains the reason his daughter appears crippled
and partially paralyzed. When she was only 10, a man named Ptolemy
became sexually attracted to her. Before he could act on his desires, how-
ever, she was paralyzed. Soon afterward, Ptolemy confessed his sin and lived
an exemplary life, leaving his wealth to the poor when he died. The implica-
tion of this strange (and frankly somewhat cruel) story is that, from the per-
spective of the writer, it’s better to be crippled than sexually attractive!
Even worse is the short story in the Acts of Peter that features a peasant man
who asks Peter’s advice about how to preserve his daughter’s virginity. Peter
tells him, “The Lord will bestow upon her what was expedient for her soul” —
and she falls dead! Once again, you can identify the Encratitic tendencies of
these writings — carried to an extreme degree. The message is that it’s better
to be crippled or even dead than engage in sex.
Peter and Simon the Magician face off
A major portion of the Acts of Peter tradition introduces Simon, known also
as Simon Magus (which means “Simon the Magician”) from a biblical story in
Acts chapter 8, where a magician named Simon offers to “buy” the ability to
perform miracles.
In the Bible, Peter scolds Simon somewhat severely, but then you hear noth-
ing more about him. However, Simon passed into Christian folklore and
became a kind of archenemy of early Christians and one responsible for
many heresies. Whether blaming Simon for heresies is pure folklore or has
any basis in a historical person is now impossible to tell.
The Acts of Peter features a major confrontation between Peter and Simon.
282
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Simon trashes Christianity
God tells Peter to go to Rome to confront Simon, who has apparently been
leading many people astray with his attacks on Christianity and his otherwise
impressive magical abilities. When Peter arrives in Rome, he’s greeted by
what remains of the Christian community; they explain that things are worse
than Peter may have known!
A former good Christian and elite citizen named Marcellus once heavily sup-
ported the poor and widows in Rome and was even known by the Emperor
for his good deeds. But Simon has convinced Marcellus that Christianity is
false; as a result, Marcellus has housed Simon and turned away from the
Christians and his service to the poor.
Peter retorts with speeches and minor miracles
When Peter hears of Simon’s influence on Marcellus and his overall effect on
the Christians in Rome, he goes into a long, angry speech about evil and the
work of the devil. The confrontation between Peter and Simon seems
inevitable. When Peter then goes to confront Simon and challenge him, Simon
refuses to meet Peter. Peter miraculously gives a big dog the power of speech
and sends him to confront Simon.
In the meantime, Marcellus is rather impressed with Peter’s actions and runs
to Peter to confess his failure. Marcellus is received back into fellowship
(with accompanying long speeches from Marcellus and Peter, of course). As
Peter speaks to a local crowd, a demon-possessed man laughs at Peter and
tells him that Simon is still arguing with the talking dog. When Peter drives
out the demon, it bursts a statue of Caesar into fragments, after which Peter
miraculously reassembles the statue.
Peter’s minor miracles (including resurrecting a smoked fish from the
market) appear to be building up to the confrontation with Simon. Finally,
Jesus appears to Peter to tell him to get ready for the big struggle, and along
the way, Jesus tells Peter about some of Simon’s trickery in the past.
Simon denies Peter’s theology about Jesus
Marcellus describes a very strange dream to Peter about an ugly woman
appearing — representing Simon’s evil power. In the dream, Marcellus says,
Peter told him to take his sword and cut off her head! Marcellus basically
says he couldn’t hurt a fly, and a heavenly being comes and chops up the
woman in his dream. Peter seems encouraged by this grisly dream, thinking 
it reassures him of defeating Simon.
283
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

Everyone comes to an assembly in Rome: senators and prefects, Christians,
and onlookers. Peter and Simon stand before the crowds, who demand that
Peter prove his miraculous powers. But first, there’s a verbal debate. Peter
recounts the story from Acts 8 and challenges Simon. Simon denies Peter’s
theology about Jesus:
Men of Rome, is a God born? Is he crucified? Whoever has a master is no
God. And when he spoke, many said, “You are right, Simon!” And Peter said,
“Cursed be your words against Christ . . .”
—Acts of Peter 23
Peter defeats Simon
Peter cites Scripture to support his assessment of Jesus, but then he con-
fronts Simon again, essentially saying that talk is cheap and demanding to see
Simon’s powers.
The Prefect in charge demands an impartial challenge. He puts one of his
slaves in front of the two men and tells Simon to kill him and Peter to revive
him. Simon whispers something in the slave’s ear, and he falls dead. But just
before Peter responds, a prominent woman from the crowd speaks of her
dead son, and Peter asks that he be brought to Peter then and there. Simon
isn’t impressed with all this and returns the crowd’s focus to the dead servant.
Simon asks the crowd if they will punish Peter if Simon can also raise the 
servant. When Simon makes the servant appear alive (apparently by moving
his head), the crowd goes for Peter. Peter asks them to examine the servant,
and they discover that he isn’t really alive! The crowd turns on Simon, threat-
ening to burn him — but Peter demands that Simon be spared:
If you continue, the boy shall not rise. We have learned not to recompense
evil for evil, but we have learned to love our enemies and to pray for those
who persecute us. For should even he repent, it is better. For God will not
remember the evil. Let him, therefore, come to the light of Christ. If he
cannot, let him inherit the portion of his father, the devil. But do not let your
hands be contaminated . . .
—Acts of Peter 28
Peter raises both the servant and the woman’s son, and the woman is so
grateful that she gives money to the poor. In the meantime, Simon makes one
last great attempt to overcome Peter: He tells everyone that he’s going to fly!
Amazingly, Simon accomplishes this feat, but Peter strikes him from the sky
with his power, and Simon breaks his leg from the fall. In a somewhat perfunc-
tory ending, the story states that Simon eventually dies.
284
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Martyrdom of Peter
The end of the tradition focuses on the martyrdom of Peter. Rather like the
stories of Andrew (refer to the earlier section “The Acts of Andrew”), Peter
meets his death at the hands of a Roman official who’s angry that his wife has
become a Christian and thus refuses to sleep with her husband anymore!
The story of Peter’s death affirms a tradition that Peter died on a cross, but
upside down. In the end, Peter affirms that only the “visible” part of him will
die — his soul will live on.
The Acts of Thomas
It’s fortunate that most of the Acts of Thomas has survived for study. The 
earliest mention of these traditions is in the writings of the fourth-century
“heresy hunter” Epiphanius, but allusions to some of the specific traditions
and stories also appear in earlier material.
The opening scene: Thomas gets picked 
to bring Christianity to India
As the Acts of Thomas begins, the Apostles are casting lots to determine
where each Apostle is to go in the world. Jesus’s brother Thomas finds out
that he’s headed to India. He’s not terribly excited about this assignment and
tries to avoid going, even after Jesus appears to him in the night. So, when a
merchant named Abban comes to visit from India, Jesus actually “sells”
Thomas to Abban, claiming that Thomas is Jesus’s slave. When Thomas 
discovers that he has been sold, he accepts the inevitable, and in a reconcili-
ation of sorts, Jesus gives the money from the sale back to Thomas to help
him on his journey. Abban, on the other hand, is delighted with his purchase,
especially when Thomas informs him that he’s a carpenter like his brother
and father, Joseph.
The belief that Thomas brought Christianity to India is very ancient, and
many Indian Christians to this day claim “Apostolic origins” for their Church.
The fact that very early traditions suggest an association between Thomas
and India is intriguing and may well suggest that Christianity did indeed
come to India very early in Christian history. Certainly there were well-
traveled trade routes linking Rome, Palestine, and India, and some trade
routes went even as far as China!
285
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

The second scene: Thomas doesn’t build 
a palace . . . on Earth, that is
In the second scene of the Acts of Thomas, there appears one of the most
charming stories of the entire corpus of writings we consider in this chapter.
Abban, the one so overjoyed to have purchased such an accomplished slave,
tells King Gungaphorus all about Thomas and his abilities. The King wants to
build a great palace and asks if Thomas can do it. Thomas answers:
Yes, I shall build it and finish it; for because of this I have come, to build and
to do carpenter’s work.
—Acts of Thomas 17
This comment has a double meaning because Thomas refers to the “carpen-
ter’s work.” The carpenter is clearly Jesus, and so Thomas makes a veiled ref-
erence to the fact that he’s in India in order to share Jesus’s message and
spread Christianity. Some traditions even suggest that Thomas was the twin
brother of Jesus and therefore that’s why Thomas was also a carpenter.
The King sends money to Thomas on a regular basis, which Thomas
promptly distributes to the poor of the area. But when the King asks some
friends what his new palace looks like, they inform him that Thomas has built
no such palace but has given away the King’s riches along with healing the
sick and performing many miracles.
The King is so angry that he considers ways to kill Thomas. That night the
King’s brother Gad dies and appears in heaven. When the heavenly atten-
dants show Gad the various places to live in heaven, he sees a magnificent
palace and asks to live there! He’s told that he can’t because, “This palace is
the one which that Christian has built for your brother . . .” (The Acts of
Thomas 22, tr. Elliott, 456).
Gad begs to be allowed to tell his living brother about the glorious palace
that Thomas has built by doing good deeds in the name of the King.
Returning to life, Gad begs the King to be allowed to live in even a basement
room of the magnificent palace in heaven. The King comes to understand
how Thomas built his palace in heaven rather than on earth, and the King
and his brother then spend the rest of their lives giving to the poor and are
eventually sealed (anointed with oil) and then baptized as Christians.
Incidentally, one of the interesting aspects of these later Acts writings is the
information provided about rituals such as anointing with oil and baptism.
The Acts of Thomas, for example, shares ritual words to accompany the
anointing that may suggest aspects of the actual sacramental rites of the
third to fifth centuries CE. While anointing with oil, Thomas says:
286
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Come, holy name of Christ, which is above every name
Come, power of the Most High, and perfect compassion,
Come, gift most high
Come compassionate mother
Come fellowship of the male
Come revealer of secret mysteries . . .
—Acts of Thomas 27
The third scene: The Garden of Eden’s 
“serpent descendant” obeys Thomas
In the third scene, Thomas sees a great serpent by the road who has attacked
a young man. In a long speech, the serpent identifies itself as a descendant of
the serpent that tempted Adam and Eve, that hardened Pharaoh’s heart
against the Israelites, and that’s tied to a series of other negative influences in
Scriptural tradition. Thomas commands the serpent to heal the boy by suck-
ing out the poison, and the serpent obeys Thomas. Just imagine this scene
depicted in medieval plays!
The fourth scene: A colt 
gives Thomas a ride
In the fourth scene, Thomas converses with a colt that eventually convinces
Thomas to ride on his back so that the colt can perform a service to the
Apostle. At first, Thomas refuses to mount the animal, but the colt assures
him that it would be a blessing. After the colt delivers Thomas to his destina-
tion, Thomas tells the colt to return to the wild.
The fifth scene: Thomas 
banishes an incubus
In the fifth scene, Thomas drives away a demon who has been sleeping with a
woman for five years. When Thomas drives away the demon, the demon
makes a fascinating speech as he leaves the woman that he has fallen in love
with: He comments that Thomas looks like Jesus, who fooled the devil
because he didn’t look very impressive in his earthly form.
287
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

The sixth scene: Thomas rails 
against “insane intercourse!”
In the sixth scene, a young man who has just committed murder attempts to
take the Eucharist with Christians; he’s immediately physically deformed for
his crime. When he explains what happened, he tells of his passion for a
woman who wouldn’t sleep with him; he murdered her out of jealousy that
she would sleep with anyone else:
When the apostle heard this he said, “Oh insane intercourse, how you lead to
shamelessness! O unrestrained lust, how have you excited this man to do this!”
—Acts of Thomas 52
The Apostle Thomas goes to the place where the woman killed lay dead, and
together, he and the killer raise her from the dead. She then discusses her
vision of visiting various places in hell and tells of the punishments of those
who have sinned in this life. Thomas uses the occasion of her explanation of
the “other side” to deliver a lengthy sermon on Christianity, emphasizing the
judgments that will be given for the sin of adultery and finishing with some
thoughts on the meaning of the coming of Jesus.
The seventh and eighth scenes: 
Thomas banishes more demons
An officer of King Masdaeus encounters Thomas and tells Thomas of the
troubles of his wife and daughter, who seemed to have been attacked by
demons. Thomas has pity on them, gathers them and a group of friends
together for a sermon, and seems to assure them that they will be okay.
The group travels to the home of the officer, and along the way Thomas
miraculously tames wild asses to pull the wagon and then dismisses them
when the journey is finished. Thomas calls for the daughter and mother to
come forward, and he heals them.
The ninth scene: Thomas counsels 
against marriage and sex
In the most lengthy of the adventures in the Acts of Thomas, the Apostle
Thomas encounters Mygdonia, the wife of the elite Charisius. Thomas is
preaching about Jesus and the lifestyle of Christians, and many are
impressed — especially Mygdonia, who immediately bows before Thomas
and asks to be included in this new teaching.
288
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

As a result of Thomas’s influence, Mygdonia goes home a changed woman
who no longer wishes to sleep with her husband because she’s now “bound”
to someone even greater (Jesus, of course). Charisius, not entirely realizing
that he has essentially lost his wife, tells her about a dream:
I saw myself at a meal near King Misdaeus, and beside us stood a table fully
laden. And I saw an eagle coming down from heaven taking away two
partridges from the place before me and the king, which he carried into his
nest [Greek: heart]. And he came near again fluttering about us. And the
king ordered a bow to be brought to him. The eagle took a dove and a
pigeon from the place before us. The king shot an arrow at him which
passed through him from one side to the other without hurting him. And he
flew to his nest unscathed . . .
—Acts of Thomas 91 (tr. Elliott, 482)
This dream essentially summarizes what is about to happen: The eagle
(which represents Thomas, Christianity, or Jesus — but is more often an
image of political power like Rome, so this is an ironic image for a Roman to
imagine!) will take away the wife of Charisius, but the King’s wife will also
come under the influence of Thomas’s teaching. Similar to the other Acts 
literature we consider in this chapter, Thomas is imprisoned by the angry
Charisius and the King for turning their women against them. The preaching
of Christianity in some of these early Acts writings actually breaks up some
marriages of the elite. Some feminist readers now say that these are acts of
liberation because the women were often trapped in unjust and oppressive
relationships. This is an interesting idea, of course, but it seems that part of
the point here is the avoidance of sexuality as well in a radical definition of
purity.
Thomas tells the famous “Hymn of the Pearl” story
While facing prison, Thomas tells his fellow prisoners a story, known as 
“The Hymn of the Pearl,” that’s one of the most famous stories in the Acts 
of Thomas. In this narrative (which may or may not have its origin in this
writing), a child is sent on a journey by his parents to find a pearl guarded by
a serpent in another world. But the child must leave behind his wealth and
riches to go on the journey. Also, because he goes to a different world, he
needs to make himself look like the others in that world:
I clothed myself in garments like theirs, so that I would not be seen as a
stranger
And as one who had come from abroad to take the pearl
Lest the Egyptians might arouse the serpent against me
But somehow they learned that I was not their countryman.
They dealt with me treacherously, and I tasted their food
I no longer recognized that I was a king’s son, and I served their king
And I fell into a deep sleep because of the heaviness of their food . . .
289
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

. . . The child forgets his true identity, until a letter from the parents wakes
him up:
To our son in Egypt, greetings!
Awake, and rise from your sleep
Listen to the words in this letter
Remember you are the son of kings
You have fallen beneath the yoke of slavery
Remember your gold-spangled garment
Recall the pearl for which you were sent to Egypt,
Your name has been called to the book of life . . .
—Acts of Thomas, “The Hymn of the Pearl” 109, 111
This story is an allegory of the Gnostic belief that persons are from the God
of Light; they descend into the world of the material things and forget who
they really are — thinking that the material world is all there is. The letter
from the child’s parents is, then, the Gospel message of the Gnostic Jesus,
who reminds people of who they really are:
Remember you are the son of kings!
You have fallen beneath the yoke of slavery.
Remember your gold-spangled garment
Recall the pearl for which you were sent to Egypt,
Your name has been called to the book of life!
—Acts of Thomas 111
The martyrdom of Thomas
Charisius believes that by imprisoning Thomas he has dealt with his problem
and his wife will return to his bed (and, he probably thinks, to her senses!). In
an interesting conversation, Charisius asks if he’s more beautiful than Jesus!
After all, didn’t Mygdonia once love him? Mygdonia explains how her new
faith makes the old “love” pale in comparison:
That time was of the earthly life, this of the everlasting. That was of a
transient pleasure, this of an everlasting. That was of the day and of the
night, this of the day without night. You have seen the wedding which passed
over and remains here. This wedding remains in eternity. That communion
was of destruction, this is of eternal life . . .
—Acts of Thomas 124 (tr. Elliott, 495)
Upon hearing this, Charisius is so angry that he goes to King Misdaeus to
demand that Thomas be killed to prevent the spreading of such thoughts.
The King tells Thomas that if he heals the marriage, then Thomas will go free,
but Thomas refuses and isn’t impressed with the King’s threats. Soon enough,
even the King’s wife is impressed by Thomas, and the King blames Charisius
for ever mentioning Thomas to him! If that isn’t bad enough, Vazan, the King’s
son, takes an interest in Thomas and eventually becomes a follower as well.
290
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The story continues with the King becoming increasingly determined to kill
Thomas and Thomas continuing to minister to those who follow him, seem-
ingly unimpressed with the anger of the King. In the end, the Martyrdom of
Thomas is described as being run through with spears by the King’s soldiers.
When two of Thomas’s followers refuse to leave his body, the “resurrection
body” of Thomas appears to them and reassures them that Thomas isn’t
really dead. Charisius and King Misdaeus eventually realize that they’ll never
have their wives back and allow them to continue in their Christian practices.
A final word and a happy ending
A short narrative ends the Acts of Thomas (it’s kind of like an afterword).
King Misdaeus has another son who’s possessed of a demon, and the King
goes to the grave of Thomas. The Apostle’s body, however, was taken else-
where for burial, so the King places dust from the grave on his son’s neck and
says a prayer begging Jesus to heal his son. When the boy is healed, the King
joins the Christian group in his kingdom, and the writing ends on a rejoicing
note — an appropriately Hollywood happy ending!
291
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders
Sexuality and liberation in the ancient world
Some scholars have wondered if there isn’t
more to the frequent theme seen in ancient writ-
ings about women giving up sex and even their
marriages. Was it merely a form of early
Christian spirituality that denied any physical
pleasures as always sinful? Some scholars
have noticed that there are many strong female
characters in these writings who
 Defy social convention
 Act unafraid of their male “superiors”
 Often use language suggesting that they 
no longer feel that they’re under male
authority
Do these writings reflect an ancient form of
women’s liberation? Some historians argue that
ancient marriage was almost always a relation-
ship in which a male dominated a female, and
ancient sexuality was almost always a sign of
male dominance over females. If this is pre-
sumed in many cases, then one way to have
expressed women’s liberation in the ancient
world was to liberate women from marriage and
sexuality entirely — even break up oppressive
relationships! On their own, women were then
free from earthly domination and free to exer-
cise leadership — precisely what’s reflected in
these writings!
So, part of the teaching in ancient Christian
writings may have been motivated by a disdain
for physical participation in sex or other “plea-
sures of the flesh” (gluttony, drinking, and adul-
tery are frequently mentioned), but another part
of the teaching may have been that these writ-
ings were trying to express a sort of women’s
liberation for the third to fifth centuries.
In fact, many social commentators and theolo-
gians argue that, in the roughly 1,700 years 
that have passed, people haven’t yet really
learned to make marriage and sexuality more
liberating — although perhaps people at least
understand the importance of equality more
now than then, even if they still aren’t good at
practicing it!

Checking Out Some “Secondary” Acts
More Acts stories and writings continued to be written even into the third to
seventh centuries. More stories were added, and older stories were elabo-
rated and drawn out. As we mention earlier, some of these episodes and sto-
ries began to turn up after the tenth century in medieval European Bible
plays, which were performed outside churches and in villages by traveling
troupes of actors. (The film The Reckoning is an interesting depiction of such
traveling groups.)
In the 1924 edition of English translations of many of these non-biblical Acts
works, M. R. James speaks of the secondary character of many texts that
should be grouped with the older Acts literature that we cover in this chapter.
Both James and Elliott (whose more updated and superior translations we’ve
been mainly using) agree that these texts have minimal theological impor-
tance but contain stories and traditions that continued to be of interest to
later readers.
Most of these later works don’t warrant extensive coverage in this book
because they appear long after the canon was established for the Christian
Bible. Still, the early Christian folklore is often interesting and always enter-
taining, and it’s interesting to note that such stories of early Christian leaders
continued to be written for hundreds of years. In fact, references to such writ-
ings continue into the fifth to eighth centuries CE, and many of these stories
eventually ended up as themes in medieval religious dramas and plays after
about 1100–1200 CE.
In this section, we look briefly at two examples of these later Acts-type 
writings.
The Acts of Philip
The Acts of Philip is divided into separate acts, rather like Thomas (see “The
Acts of Thomas” earlier in this chapter). In these short acts, Philip performs
a series of miracles.
In one, Greek philosophers call on Jewish Priests from Jerusalem to come
and deal with Philip, and there’s a rather nasty conflict between the High
Priest and his 500 assistants that paints Jewish leaders in a very bad light —
another sad example of early Christian anti-Semitic ideas, we fear! Philip
eventually impresses the 500, who convert, but the High Priest is sent to hell
as an unbeliever.
292
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The angry side of Philip is dealt with at the end of the series of writings.
Among the favorite stories in the Acts of Philip is Act VIII, which contains the
conversion of a leopard! The leopard attacks a goat-kid, but the goat-kid begs
for its life (speaking with a human voice) on account of the arrival of Apostles
of God. The leopard visits Philip and takes him to where the goat-kid lay, and
Philip heals the animal. The animals fall down in gratitude to Philip and his
associates!
In the fascinating concluding acts, Philip and Bartholomew are both in trou-
ble in Hierapolis (in the area of modern Turkey) for preaching the Gospel and
converting a large number of people, including Nicanora, the wife of the
Roman proconsul. Like many of the other Acts, this conversion leads to her
refusing sexual relations, which especially upsets the proconsul, who’s
described as a “tyrant.” Philip and Bartholomew are nailed upside down to
the wall of the Temple, but the interesting action begins when Philip curses
almost the entire town to destruction — the earth opens up and hundreds of
people descend to hell!
Jesus comes to visit Philip and scolds him, and then saves the people:
And a voice was heard: “I will have mercy on you in my cross of light . . .
and I shall bring back those who have been swallowed up.” And he drew a
cross in the air, reaching down into the abyss, and it was filled with light,
and the cross was like a ladder. And Jesus called the people, and they all
came up.
—Acts of Philip (tr. Elliott, 517–518)
Jesus determines that Philip should be disciplined for his action, and further-
more, Jesus raises the hundreds that were cast into hell. They all convert,
repent of killing Philip, and are received into heaven. The story finishes with
Philip’s death as a martyr, presumably facing some delay in entering heaven
as further discipline from Jesus.
The Passion of Bartholomew
In the Passion of Bartholomew, the Apostle Bartholomew is sent to India,
where he lives with the poor who congregate at a pagan temple for healing.
Demons who live there have been healing people in order to maintain their
authority but can no longer do so when Bartholomew arrives. When the local
King Polymius hears about this, he tells the Apostle that his daughter is pos-
sessed of a demon, and Bartholomew heals her. Bartholomew carries on with
his traveling ministry, but the King then packs up a camel with silver and
gold and tries to find him, only to be visited in the night by the Apostle who
tells him that he doesn’t care about such things!
293
Chapter 15: Even More “Acts”: Writings of Other Early Christian Leaders

King Polymius enters into an extended discussion with Bartholomew, who
speaks of the birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary — the second virgin in human
history! When the King asks who is the first, Bartholomew answers that
Adam was born of the virgin earth!
The King seems intrigued but is especially impressed when Bartholomew
demands that the demon return to the idol in the Temple and confess to
everyone that he, the demon, is a fraud and that the people were made ill in
the first place by the devil to fool the people into believing that the idol was
healing them. King Polymius is so impressed that he tries to break the
Temple apart. When he’s unsuccessful, Bartholomew miraculously destroys
all the idols.
Meanwhile, pagan priests from a nearby town go to King Astreges (King
Polymius’s brother, it seems) and complain about the destruction of temples
and idols. These other priests cause a stir that leads to Bartholomew’s 
martyrdom. However, in a storybook ending where, you may say, “evil gets 
its reward,” the evil King Astreges dies a horrible death, and King Polymius is
made a bishop by his people — all of whom have converted.

Chapter 16
Early Christian Apocalyptic
Visions
In This Chapter
 Identifying apocalyptic writing
 Assessing apocalyptic writings of Peter, Thomas, and James
 Christianizing Hebrew apocalyptic writing
T
he word “apocalypse” means “revelation,” and biblical historians also use
it to refer to a kind of religious literature from the ancient Jews and
ancient Christians — apocalyptic literature. As you can imagine, these works
have to do with visions and revelations experienced by the writers. The most
famous example of this apocalyptic style of religious literature is, obviously,
the Apocalypse of John, the last book of the New Testament; not surprisingly,
it’s better known as Revelation. However, many Christians are surprised to
learn that this unusual book isn’t really that unusual; it’s only considered so
because it’s the only example of apocalyptic writing that the early Christians
chose to include in the New Testament. But they had plenty to choose from!
The ancient Jews wrote apocalyptic books also, as we survey briefly in
Chapter 4. Historians know that it was a popular — and very influential —
form of religious writing in the ancient world because they literally have
dozens of Jewish apocalyptic writings and even quite a few explicitly
Christian apocalyptic writings. In some cases, because many of the early
Christians were also Jewish, some older Jewish apocalyptic writings were
edited by Christians to transform an originally Jewish writing into a Christian
work by adding a few important references to Jesus. In other cases, it’s more
certain that works were entirely Christian compositions. Hardly any of these
writings were actually included in the Bible (probably just as well!), but they
do occasionally make for some bracing reading.
In this chapter, we first discuss the characteristics necessary for something
to be considered an apocalyptic writing. Then we survey a few Christian
apocalyptic writings that didn’t make it into the Bible. Finally, we survey
some works that were originally Jewish but underwent some Christian
amendments.

You may be wondering how this genre could be so popular given that the
New Testament only ended up with one apocalyptic work. According to
Matthew 24, Jesus preached on apocalyptic themes, and the most famous
apocalyptic book in Christian history — the Revelation to John — stands at
the symbolic end of the New Testament. Revelation is a full dose of “Christian
apocalyptic” to which few of these other writings really add anything signifi-
cant. After all, the last judgment is the last judgment . . . and apparently, the
New Testament was considered to have enough for the early Christians when
they determined the canon of the Bible.
“Apocalypse” is Greek and means “revelation.” The actual title of the last
book of the New Testament is the Apocalypse of John, but it’s known by the
translated title, the Revelation to John.
What Makes an Apocalyptic Writing?
Scholars continue to debate the issue of whether apocalyptic writings are
really all that different from prophetic writings given that both claim to pro-
vide messages from heaven. But there are some interesting differences, espe-
cially in their imagery. Scholars often cite some of the following criteria for
apocalyptic writings:
 The writings often claim to be descriptions of visions — visions of the
future or visions of visits to heavenly places (particularly different levels
or places in heaven or hell).
 After the vision, the writings often introduce an intermediary, an angel
or other heavenly creature, who explains (some of) the symbolism of the
vision.
 They usually deal with judgment, but not always.
 They often suggest events that are just about to take place — time is
short!
 The writings typically involve bizarre images, like multiheaded beasts 
or combination beasts (lions with wings, goats with many horns, and 
so on). In visits to levels of heaven or hell, there are often graphic
descriptions of punishment with fewer descriptions of rewards.
 You get a turbulent sense of impending crisis. (This is never calm 
literature!)
 If the writing has a vision of judgment, there’s often a brief description of
an idyllic age that follows, such as the “New Heaven and New Earth” in
Revelation in the New Testament.
 The visionary is often physically affected by the vision, experiencing
weakness, collapse, and so on.
296
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

 It seems that time and history as we know it is coming to an end. A great
transition is coming soon.
 Apocalyptic writings only occasionally dwell on themes of social justice
and right living. The Prophets heavily emphasize this, but apocalyptic
writing does so only once in a while.
Bizarre visions and beasts
As we’ve stated, apocalyptic writings claim to narrate a vision experienced
by the writer, accompanied by strange and bizarre images such as multi-
headed beasts or combination beasts (having features of more than one
animal). Consider, for example, the only apocalyptic writing that’s in the Old
Testament, the second half of the book of Daniel:
In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and
visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote down the dream: 
I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four winds of heaven stirring up the
great sea, and four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one
another. The first was like a lion and had eagles’ wings. Then, as I watched,
its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to
stand on two feet like a human being; and a human mind was given to it.
Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised
up on one side, had three tusks in its mouth among its teeth and was told,
“Arise, devour many bodies!” . . .
—Daniel 7:1-5
After reading Daniel, consider Revelation at the end of the New Testament; in
chapter 13, you encounter frightening images that were undoubtedly
intended to symbolize the Roman Empire:
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads;
and on its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous
names. And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a
bear’s, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave it his
power and his throne and great authority. One of its heads seemed to have
received a death-blow but its mortal wound had been healed . . .
—Revelation 13:1–3
Sound familiar? Hopefully you’re beginning to see the interesting similarities
in the apocalyptic style. In this typical apocalyptic fare, these visions are 
considered to be symbolic of
 Regimes in the world
 Rulers
 Spiritual powers active in heaven and on earth
297
Chapter 16: Early Christian Apocalyptic Visions

Emphasis on the final judgment 
of all mankind
Also typical of apocalyptic writings is an emphasis on a final judgment of all
humanity by God — a sorting out of the good and evil. Sometimes the judg-
ment is accompanied by rather gruesome descriptions of punishment of the
wicked and fanciful descriptions of the wonders and blessings in store for the
righteous.
Many historians believe that apocalyptic visions come out of circumstances
of persecution or suffering and therefore express outrage and anguish. Think
about it: If you’re suffering in this world, and especially if you see powerful
and corrupt people doing very well while you suffer, this kind of “they will get
theirs” message is welcome and perfectly understandable. It’s the religious
literature of frustration and anger that comes from a people too powerless to
take any other kind of action, so they write and pray their anger!
Christians, especially in the first 300 years of Christianity before it became a
“tolerated” religion in the Roman Empire (and eventually become the religion
of the Roman Empire — and started doing some persecuting of its own),
often experienced periods of persecution and oppression. Historians debate
just how severe this was, but it’s clear that many Christians lost their lives
and others lost their homes and possessions as a result of officially sanc-
tioned persecution. It hardly seems surprising, then, that even though they
were taught by Jesus (and Paul) to never return evil for evil, some Christians
still “got their licks in” by writing visionary works about how evil folks would
get their punishments soon enough!
The Apocalypse of Peter
The Apocalypse of Peter is a very early writing that’s noted in many early
Christian discussions of acceptable and unacceptable literature and is
included in some collections of sacred writings. It’s clear that the work had
considerable influence on later Christian thought, but scholars debate about
just how influential it was. The suggested dates for the Apocalypse of Peter
vary from 100–150 CE, which is very early indeed, and there’s evidence that it
was still being recopied by Christian scribes as late as the ninth century CE.
The Apocalypse of Peter discussed in this section has no connection with a
work with the same title that appears in the Nag Hammadi Library (and isn’t
as old as this one). We discuss that other one in Chapter 12! Same name, 
different books. Isn’t this fun?

Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Anticipating the Day of Judgment
The “launching point” for this writing appears to be the authentic discus-
sions from Jesus as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew:
When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him
privately, saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of
your coming and of the end of the age?” Jesus answered them, “Beware that
no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the
Messiah!’ and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and
rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but
the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: all
this is but the beginning of the birth pangs . . .”
—Matthew 24:3–25:1
According to Matthew 24, Jesus continues with an extended discussion of
very apocalyptic-sounding descriptions of coming trials and travails to face
the Christians in the near future. Although scholars debate how much of this
Jesus actually said and how much is elaborated by the Gospel writers based
on, for example, the devastations of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in
70 CE, this discussion provides the initial impetus for the elaboration found
in the Apocalypse of Peter.
As the Apocalypse opens, Jesus tells the brief parable of a fig tree that’s
removed from a garden because it doesn’t bear fruit. The fig tree is the
“House of Israel,” and being removed is the punishment for those who sin
and reject God’s commands. While gazing into the hand of Jesus, Peter
reports a horrific vision of the Day of Judgment:
And this shall come at the day of judgment upon those who have fallen
away from faith in God and have committed sin. Cataracts of fire shall be let
loose; and darkness and obscurity shall come up and clothe and veil the
whole world; and the waters shall be changed and turned into coals of fire,
and all that is in them shall burn . . .
—Apocalypse of Peter 5 (tr. Elliott, Apocryphal New Testament, 602)
Laying out punishments
After the rather stereotypical description of the horrors of the Day of
Judgment’s arrival, the writing outlines many of the punishments of different
kinds of sinners: punishments for those who blasphemed (hanging by their
tongues! Ouch!), those who denied righteousness, and those who committed
sexually immoral acts. Here are some notable examples:
299
Chapter 16: Early Christian Apocalyptic Visions

And the murderers and those who have made common cause with them
shall they cast into the fire, in a place full of venomous beasts, and they
shall be tormented without rest, feeling their pains . . . and the angel Ezrael
shall bring forth the souls of those who have been slain, and they shall
behold the torment of those who slew them and say one to another,
“Righteousness and justice is the judgment of God. For we heard, but we
believed not, that we should come into this place of eternal judgment.”
—Apocalypse of Peter 25 (Akhmim Verses. 25, tr. Elliott, 604)
Early Christians were especially opposed to the common Roman practice of
exposing unwanted infants to death by exposure — you know, leaving them
outside to die or be killed by animals! Thus, this visionary writing includes a
horrific punishment for parents who commit such crimes:
. . . and their children stand opposite them in a place of delight, and sigh
and cry to God because of their parents saying, “These are they who
despised and cursed and transgressed your commandments and delivered us
to death . . . ”
—Apocalypse of Peter 8 (tr. Elliott, 605)
The rich who don’t share their wealth with the poor and those who lend
money and charge interest also are punished:
And into another place nearby, full of filth, they cast men and women up to
their knees. These are they who lent money and took usury [interest] . . .
—Apocalypse of Peter 10 (tr. Elliott, 606)
But lest you think that the punishments prescribed aren’t so harsh after all,
note that these penalties are for “sins” that modern folk certainly aren’t as
concerned about as people obviously once were. The Apocalypse of Peter
also condemns those who engage in sex before marriage, homosexuals, and
even servants who don’t obey their masters! In such cases, of course, we
have to take into consideration the changing notions of personal and social
moralities when reading this.
In the end, the sinners beg for mercy, but the angel of Hell taunts them: 
“Now you repent, when it is no longer the time for repentance, and nothing of
life remains!” (The Apocalypse of Peter). The sinners accept the inevitable —
God is just!
Some versions of this work suggest that in the end, Jesus actually responds
to Peter’s weeping for mercy for sinners and promises that eventually all will
be forgiven for their sins and Jesus will have pity on them. This idea that
there will eventually be universal forgiveness after a period of suffering for
sin is evident in some early Christian writings and is widely debated among
modern interpreters of this literature.

Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

The Apocalypse of Thomas
The Apocalypse of Thomas may go back to just before the fifth century CE,
but it incorporates elements that are rather typical of apocalyptic 
literature — namely frightening descriptions of the events of the end of time.
In fact, this brief writing doesn’t contain much teaching or many positive
messages at all. It’s essentially a series of despairing predictions about nega-
tive events that are only occasionally punctuated by the predictions of a few
good rulers. These positive notes give the distinct impression of being 
temporary “reprieves” in the downward spiral.
The brief opening suggests that Jesus told these matters to Thomas. It’s 
followed by the list of disasters; here’s a good example:
The place of holiness shall be corrupted, the priesthood polluted, distress
shall increase, virtue shall be overcome, joy perish, and gladness depart. In
those days evil shall abound; there shall be respect for no one, hymns shall
cease in the house of the Lord, truth shall be no more . . .
—Apocalypse of Thomas (tr. Elliott, 647)
The Apocalypse makes some predictions about good and evil rulers:
After a little space there shall arise a king out of the east, a lover of the law,
who shall cause all necessary and good things to abound in the house of the
Lord . . .
—Apocalypse of Thomas (tr. Elliott, 647)
But immediately following a period of good things; then:
The kings of the earth and the princes and the captains shall be troubled,
and no man shall speak freely. Grey hairs shall be seen upon boys, and the
young shall not give place to the aged . . .
—Apocalypse of Thomas (tr. Elliott, 648)
And then, literally, all hell breaks loose:
Then shall all the fountains of waters and wells boil over and be turned into
blood. The heaven shall be moved, the stars shall fall upon the earth, the sun
shall be cut in half like the moon, and the moon shall not give her light . . .
—Apocalypse of Thomas (tr. Elliott, 648)
301
Chapter 16: Early Christian Apocalyptic Visions

At the end of this writing is an arrangement of the seven days (plus one) of
the destruction:
 The first day brings a cloud of blood from the north.
 On the second day, the earth will move from its place.
 On the third day, hell will open up (with the great stench of brimstone).
 On the fourth day, earthquakes will occur.
 On the fifth day, darkness will cover the earth.
 On the sixth day, the heavens will open and angels pour out, and souls
will reconnect with their bodies for resurrection of the dead.
 On the seventh day, a great battle between the forces of good and evil
will take place.
 On the eighth day, there will be victory for the righteous as they “rejoice
that the destruction of this world has come.”
The Apocalypse of Thomas isn’t particularly unique, nor does it have much
value as a theological document. However, it’s a further example of the apoc-
alyptic style and the ironic popularity of these “lists of events” already in the
ancient world. (Even modern writers make these “lists of events” that are
popular to this day!)
The Letter of James
The Letter of James claims to be secret revelations given by Jesus to James
and Peter. Some scholars (J. K. Elliott, for one, who is a noted New Testament
and Apocrypha scholar) disagree with other scholars who would date it ear-
lier, and want to date this work to third century CE. Like other documents
that we consider in other chapters (especially the Nag Hammadi writings,
which we cover in Chapter 12), the Letter is written in the dialogue format,
with a person asking questions and Jesus answering them. The subject, how-
ever, is clearly apocalyptic in tone, although the final judgment is only
vaguely hinted at in the context of “attaining salvation.”
In the beginning dialogues, Jesus tells Peter and James that they must be
“full” so that they aren’t “lacking.” But what they should be full of isn’t clear,
and Jesus doesn’t ever quite make it clear. He launches into a different dis-
cussion immediately following another question about resisting the power of
evil. Jesus replies that Satan will try to win them over, and so they must
resist. The best way to do that is to resist the enticements of the flesh. Jesus
concludes this little speech with these words: “Remember my cross and my
death, and you will live!” (Letter of James 5:30–35). But James and Peter don’t
really like that answer — they don’t want to face death like Jesus did!
302
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Jesus then counsels them that they must not fear death, because “the king-
dom of God belongs to those who are dead” (Letter of James 6:15–16). There
follows a few more strange discussions about the “head of prophecy” being
cut off when John was killed (Letter of James 6:30; compare to Matthew
14:8–10), but then Jesus tells Peter and James not to allow the kingdom of
heaven to wither away. In a parable-like comparison, Jesus says that the king-
dom of God is like a date palm whose fruits provide for many, and Jesus tells
Peter and James to continue to provide “good fruit” like the tree.
In one of the most interesting portions of the Letter, Jesus says that Peter and
James should be eager for instruction, from which comes life. Again, it’s the
Gnostic theme that salvation comes from information! But still, Jesus says in
this writing that the prerequisites for such instruction are
 Faith
 Love
 Works
Jesus compares instruction to sowing grain: When you plant it, you have
faith; when it sprouts, you love it; and you then do the work of using it for the
food it provides, putting some in storage to be planted in the future. So, Jesus
says:
. . . receive for yourselves the Kingdom of Heaven: unless you receive it
through knowledge, you will not be able to discover it.
—Letter of James 8:25
The Gnostic character of many of the sayings in the Letter of James, and else-
where in Gnostic writings, is readily apparent. For example, the concept of
salvation through knowledge is Gnostic, as is the changing moods of Jesus.
(For more on Gnosticism, turn to Chapter 12.) In the following sequence,
Jesus’s mood turns a bit ugly, and he scolds James and Peter, telling them
that their salvation is up to their own behavior and understanding, so they
had better not mess it up! Then just as quickly, Jesus speaks about how he
will forgive much and leaves them to “plead for you with the Father.” One can
only sympathize with Peter’s confusion at these seemingly contrary words
from Jesus, first encouraging and then discouraging:
Sometimes you urge us on toward the kingdom of heaven, yet other times
you turn us away, Lord. Sometimes you make appeals, draw us toward faith,
and promise us life, yet other times you drive us away from the kingdom of
heaven . . .
—Letter of James 13:25
In the end, Jesus is more positive and is encouraging just before he ascends
back into heaven.

Chapter 16: Early Christian Apocalyptic Visions

“Christianized” Hebrew 
Apocalyptic Writings
The series of works identified as Christianized Hebrew apocalyptic writings
are basically Jewish in tone and imagery, but they’re also supplemented with
Christian images and ideas. Some scholars argue that they were written this
way (with the Christian characteristics) to begin with but simply were writ-
ten by Jewish-Christians with naturally strong Hebrew influences, using 
Old Testament themes and images. We address some of these writings in
Chapter 4; in the context of this chapter, we look at some of them as specifi-
cally Christian apocalyptic works.
Christian additions to the Sibylline Oracles
The Sibyls were female seers and diviners of the ancient world, famous for
their predictions and oracles of fate. Many ancient cities had Sibyls who drew
people from miles around to come and consult them. They weren’t originally
a Jewish or Christian phenomenon but rather pagan. However, already in the
centuries just before Jesus, Jewish writers were borrowing the form of the
Sibylline Oracle to construct religious writings that “borrowed” the authority
of a Sibyl. Among these Jewish compositions are also inserted sections that
are Christian in origin, suggesting that Christians at least edited some of the
compositions and may have also written whole sections.
The Sibylline Oracles deal with somewhat vague predictions of what’s coming
in world politics, but they were transformed into apocalyptic writings about
the end times by both Jewish and Christian writers. More than a dozen books
are recognized as collections of Jewish and/or Christian Sibylline Oracles.
Among them are a few good examples of likely Christian insertions or editing.
In Book One, you find the following interesting insertion of Christian themes
after a sequence of dividing world history into separate sections (dealing
mostly with Old Testament times and characters such as the Flood and 
King David):
Then indeed the son of the great God will come,
Incarnate, likened to mortal men on earth,
Bearing four vowels, and the consonants in him are two.
I will state explicitly the entire number for you . . .
Priests will bring gifts to him, bringing forward gold,
Myrrh, and incense. For he will also do all these things.
—Sibylline Oracles 1:324
304
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Included in this section is an affirmation that Gentiles will be brought under
Christ’s leadership because they will begin to recognize God’s rule. The text
that follows plainly shows rather strong anti-Jewish sentiment, blaming Jews
for not receiving Christ and not accepting his status from God. It’s followed
by a rather poetic rendition of the crucifixion of Jesus as drawn from the
Passion accounts of the Gospels.
In Book Two, the judgment led by God in the final days is described, in some-
what standard terms. In this description, Christ makes an appearance:
Christ, imperishable himself, will come in glory on a cloud
Toward the imperishable one with the blameless angels.
He will sit on the right of the Great One, judging at the tribunal
The life of pious men and the way of impious men . . .
—Sibylline Oracles 2:241–242
Professor John J. Collins, one of the world’s authorities on this literature,
calls Book Six of the Sibylline Oracles a “hymn to Christ.” This very short
writing speaks of the coming of Christ to heal and to teach wisdom and 
finishes with a word spoken to the cross itself:
O wood, o most blessed, on which God was stretched out;
Earth will not contain you, but you will see heaven as home
When your fiery eye, o God, flashes like lightning.
—Sibylline Oracles 6
In Book Eight, you find an even more powerful presentation of the life of Jesus
just before a description of the upheavals of God’s judgment at the end of time.
Christian additions to the 
Fourth Book of Ezra
In The Fourth Book of Ezra, an originally Jewish writing appears to have been
“framed” with Christian chapters at the beginning and end. The main, “Jewish”
body of the book consists of revelations to the biblical figure Ezra, a Priest in
the Persian Period (who lived roughly around 450 BCE); this writing is nor-
mally dated first century CE in the present form.
The Christian additions to this work are the first two chapters and the final
two chapters (15–16), which consist of further descriptions of final judgment
and the end of the age. In the first chapters, however, Ezra is shown a vision
of the history of Israel as well as a move by God to save the Gentiles. Ezra
sees a vast multitude determined to worship the true God, and before the
older Jewish section of the work begins, Ezra sees a vision of a man “crown-
ing” the multitudes with a crown of faith:
305
Chapter 16: Early Christian Apocalyptic Visions

Then I said to the angel, “Who is that young man who places crowns on
them and puts palms in their hands?” He answered and said to me, “He is
the Son of God, whom they confessed in the world.” So I began to praise
those who had stood valiantly for the name of the Lord . . .
—Fourth Book of Ezra 2:42–48
Christian additions to the 
Apocalypse of Elijah
The Apocalypse of Elijah, which purports to be additional visions of the end
times given to the Prophet Elijah, also features Christian additions that are
usually quite obvious. For example, when God’s intention to judge between
good and evil is described in the opening section, just after the affirmation of
the power of the Devil in the world, it says:
Therefore, on account of this, the God of glory had mercy upon us, and he
sent his son to the world so that he might save us from the captivity . . .
—Apocalypse of Elijah 5
You also get this interesting passage about the return of Christ:
When the Christ comes, he will come in the manner of a covey of doves with
the crown of doves surrounding him. He will walk upon the heaven’s vaults
with the sign of the cross leading him. The whole world will behold him like
the sun which shines from the eastern horizon to the western. This is how
he will come, with all his angels surrounding him . . .
—Apocalypse of Elijah 3:2–4
The Apocalypse goes on with a startling description of the “son of lawless-
ness,” a kind of anti-Christ figure who can do everything that Jesus did on
earth except raise the dead — and by that inability he will be “found out” by
the faithful. Finally, the writing announces that Christ will inaugurate his reign
of 1,000 years and create a New Heaven and New Earth — images borrowed
from the New Testament’s Revelation to John.
The Apocalypse writings that feature Christian “inserts” show not only how
early Christians made use of these writings but also the freedom that
Christian copyists felt to simply edit in sections that honored their own 
traditions! There was apparently a strong sense of malleability in working
with these writings — that is, they weren’t considered sacred or untouchable
at all!
306
Part IV: Lost Early Christian Writings 

Judging from the fact that stories of final judgment, the sufferings of hell, and
the glories of heaven continued to be riveting subjects to Christian audiences
right up to their appearance as themes in European medieval religious drama
from 1200 to the 1500s, apocalyptic themes were constant favorites. People
wanted reassurances about their spiritual futures as well as assurance that
evildoers would “get theirs in the end.” It seems that both were popular and
comforting messages.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You want a quick summary, you say? Just give me the
basics, you say? A “bottom line” kind of person, are
you? Then this part is for you. Here, we summarize a
series of “Top Ten” lists that you’ll never hear from David
Letterman! You get the ten weirdest books written by
early Jews as well as ten from Christian writers. You also
get our recommendation of ten books that every serious
student of the Bible should read. Finally, we consider ten
“sayings of Jesus” that are reported in sources outside the
New Testament and take a moment to consider the
provocative question, “Does it sound like him, or not?”

Chapter 17
Ten Weirdest Jewish Lost Books
In This Chapter
 Browsing the Book of Enoch
 Exploring documents found with the Dead Sea Scrolls
 Reading a few documents with religious “nasty streaks”
 Telling stories and glimpsing the possible future
W
hen we say a lost book is “weird,” we mean that it contains any of the
following, and in many cases, all of the following:
 Odd, surreal imagery
 Arguments that either don’t make sense (to us!) or are contrary to tradi-
tional canonical themes found in the Bible
 Narrative elements that fly in the face of what the traditions appear to
be in the canonical writings eventually endorsed by either the Church
for Christians, or the Rabbis for Judaism 
These factors contributed to the rejection of these lost books for canonical
inclusion, but they certainly make for interesting reading nonetheless!
The criteria we use for selecting “weird” writings for this chapter apply to
both the Jewish lost books discussed here and the Christian lost books that
we cover in Chapter 18. Now, this “weird” business is, of course, a huge
matter of opinion. Some folks think that some of the writings that are in the
Bible inch toward the edge of the “weird” category, if they haven’t fallen in!
Still, it’s interesting to propose reasons why some of these books didn’t make
the cut for either Judaism or Christianity (now see . . . they did agree on some
things!).

1 Enoch
Several books are attributed to Enoch, but here we’re addressing “numero
uno” — the book often called simply “Enoch” but better identified as 1 Enoch.
In fact, 1 Enoch (see Chapter 6 for a full discussion of this book) makes two of
our Part of Tens lists because, even though we consider it to be required
reading for anyone interested in biblical studies (see Chapter 20), at the same
time it’s decidedly weird.
Written most likely between 300–100 BCE, 1 Enoch is a lengthy apocalyptic
work; in fact, it’s probably the oldest example of this genre of religious writ-
ing that exists today.
So why is Enoch in the “weird” category? Apocalyptic literature is already a
strange form of writing in that it uses bizarre images, features angelic visi-
tors, involves dreams and visions, and so on. But Enoch really pushes the
envelope. It’s supposedly written by a human (Enoch) who’s taken directly
into God’s realm (Genesis 5:24) and given a tour of the various places in
heaven, including the locations where God keeps rain and snow and wind.
Enoch is given lists of names of fallen angels, and he sees mountains of differ-
ent metals and scenes where judgment is to take place. Then suddenly, the
story changes into a detailed discussion of the moral lessons of watching the
precise movement of the stars, moon, and sun. Then you read of dreams of
cows and falling stars . . . and then there’s a retelling of the entire history of
ancient Israel as an allegory about sheep. Check out this description of the
rise of King David:
Now the dogs, foxes, and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the
Lord of the sheep raised up another sheep, one from among them — a ram
which would lead them. That ram began to fight on all sides those dogs,
foxes, and wild boars . . .
—1 Enoch 89:42–44 (tr. E. Isaac, in Charlesworth, Vol. 1, 69)
So, if 1 Enoch is so strange, why is it also a critically important work? It’s
important because there are many sections of 1 Enoch — including a lengthy
series of discussions about the “chosen one” of God who will assist in judg-
ment in the end times — that were either later Christian additions to the
work or represent pre-Christian Jewish ideas quite clearly compatible with
later Christian discussions of Jesus! If these are, in fact, pre-Christian sections
of Enoch, then they’re clearly ideas that would have influenced later
Christian reflection on Jesus. Another famous aspect of Enoch: It contains the
oldest account of the origin of Satan as a “fallen angel” — an idea that went
on to be very influential; it’s cited in early Christian literature, and known by
many Christians to this very day (even though most Christians don’t know
anything about the book of Enoch!). Because there’s very little discussion of
Satan in the Hebrew Bible, the prominence of the “fallen angels” in Enoch is
all the more interesting.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The War Scroll (From the 
Dead Sea Scrolls)
The Dead Sea Scrolls contain several writings that were important to the
Qumran community — the folks who hid the scrolls in the first place (for a
fuller discussion of the Dead Sea Scrolls, head to Chapter 5). They had their
own literature, and the War Scroll is an apocalyptic vision of the end times
when the “sons of light” (obviously the community and their angelic allies)
would go to war against the “sons of darkness” (and their angelic allies) to
retake and purify the Holy Temple of Jerusalem and inaugurate the future. In
the end, all darkness is destroyed and light lives on.
This strange vision can get quite graphic and gruesome in its descriptions of
spiritual battle. For example:
For the battle is yours!
With the might of your hand
Their corpses have been torn to pieces
With no-one to bury them!
—War Scroll 1 QM Col. XI
Place your hand on the neck of your foes
And your foot on the piles of the dead!
Strike the nations, your foes!
—War Scroll, 1 QM Col. XII
The War Scroll also describes the banners to be carried into battle (including
what they will say) and seems to describe certain kinds of troop movements
for the angelic, apocalyptic battle. Clearly the Qumran community consisted
of some angry and vindictive folks . . . but the interesting bit is that this was
to be a spiritual battle fought with angels and men together.
Psalms of Exorcism (From the 
Dead Sea Scrolls)
Among the weird and interesting writings in the Dead Sea material not found
anywhere in the Bible are exorcisms against Satan and evil spirits. Members
of the Qumran community were taught to repeat certain prayers when they
felt that they were confronted with evil spirits. Here’s one such prayer:
313
Chapter 17: Ten Weirdest Jewish Lost Books

When Belial comes upon you, you shall say to him: Who are you, accursed
amongst men and amongst the seed of the holy ones? Your face is a face 
of futility and your horns are horns of a wretch. You are darkness and not
light . . . Yahweh will shut you in the deepest Sheol . . .
—11Q Apocryphal Psalms Col. IV
It’s odd to think that hurling a series of insults is intended to drive away an
evil spirit, but there you are. Maybe all those people swearing on the freeway
are really trying to drive out evil spirits. . . .
The Pesher Literature (From the 
Dead Sea Scrolls)
Pesherim (meaning “interpretations”; “pesher” is the singular form) are 
writings from the Dead Sea Scrolls that involve biblical material. These are
“interpretations” of biblical books, mostly the Prophets. But the style is quite
strange and unfamiliar to modern readers. Often, the biblical Prophet (such
as Habakkuk, in one of the more famous scrolls) is quoted verse by verse, 
followed by the phrase, “The Interpretation is . . .” and a very brief explana-
tion. Consider the following example from the Prophet Habakkuk; the actual
biblical text refers to judgment against rulers who conquer others merci-
lessly and build empires:
Alas for you who build a town by bloodshed, and found a city on iniquity!
—Habakkuk 2:12
But the Pesher interpretation transforms this verse into a condemnation 
of the Priests in Jerusalem that the Dead Sea community members despise
(its references to building a city and erecting a community refer to the
Jerusalem Temple and its priestly staff):
The interpretation of the word concerns the Spreader of Deceit, who has
misdirected many, building a useless city with blood and erecting a
community by subterfuge.
—1QpHab (tr. Martinez, 201)
The free manner in which the verses are interpreted and the fact that some of
these scrolls specifically mention events that occurred in the first century
BCE ( instead of the time of the Prophet being quoted) shows that biblical
interpretation and proof-texting go way back. Many of the interpretations
derived from this verse-by-verse exposition, however, earn these writings a
clear place on the “weird” list!
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Proof-texting is the practice of using quotations from a document out of 
context to support an ideological point. Often, when read in context, the
quote actually doesn’t support the alleged contention.
The Life of Adam and Eve
The Life of Adam and Eve (first century CE) is an example of the late Jewish
fondness for legendary “expansions” of the biblical stories, this time dealing
with Adam and Eve. Of the two rather different versions of this work, one has
more apocalyptic-like elements than the other, but they both follow the same
general lines.
After being thrown out of Eden, Adam gets the great idea to stand in the
middle of the Jordan River, and he sends Eve to stand in the middle of the
Tigris River until God relents and has compassion on the two humans. It sort
of goes without saying why this work finds a place on the “weirdest” list.
Consider this excerpt:
And Adam said, “I tell you, water of the Jordan, mourn with me and gather
to me all swimming creatures which are in you and let them surround me
and so lament together with me. Let them not mourn for themselves, but
rather for me, because it is not they who have sinned, but I.”
—Life of Adam and Eve 8
Soon, fish and marine animals gather with Adam and Eve, and they actually
stop up the river! Satan, however, tricks Eve into stopping her fast by 
pretending to be an angel of God who has heard her prayers.
It isn’t immediately obvious why stopping up rivers will impress God 
(or Satan, for that matter). Furthermore, Satan complains to Adam that the
reason Satan was expelled from heaven was because he wasn’t terribly
impressed with God’s creation of humanity. It’s not exactly the most pro-
found explanation of the origins of evil, but it’s certainly entertaining.
The History of the Rechabites
In the History of the Rechabites, a pious man named Zosimus is fasting in the
wilderness in hopes that God will show him where the “Blessed Ones” dwell.
There’s no explanation of who these Blessed Ones are until later in the writ-
ing. An angel who seems to change shape into a strange animal brings
Zosimus to a beautiful island.

One of the unique aspects of this work is that instead of being transported to
heaven or hell, Zosimus is taken to a different geographical location. When
Zosimus finally meets one of the Blessed Ones (who appears to him to be like
an angel), he’s taken to their gathering. The gathered Blessed Ones ask God
why this person is visiting and if it means that the end of the world has come.
God says that it isn’t the end of the world and that Zosimus should be told
who the Blessed Ones are for seven days, after which he’ll be returned to his
world. The book describes a number of such conversations about these
Blessed Ones — how they live, why they live the way they do, and what
lessons may be learned from their lives.
This writing is a vision of a geographical apocalypse rather than a future
apocalypse. Normally, apocalyptic writings are about events that are about to
happen; they describe changes in time. This work, however, describes an
idyllic place rather than an idyllic time. This detail makes this writing among
the more unusual of the apocalyptic Jewish writings surveyed in this book —
not an easy feat to accomplish!
The Sibylline Oracles
In the ancient Greek world (and far beyond it!), there was a legendary seer,
often described as an old woman, who could peer into the unknown and give
reports (called oracles) of what she saw. The seer was called a Sibyl. No one
knows if there ever was a real Sibyl who started all this legendary stuff, but
references to her crop up as early as the fifth century BCE.
It appears that it wasn’t long before some Jewish writers decided that they
liked this Sibyl stuff and therefore started using this style of writing. The
result is a rather large collection of writings called The Sibylline Oracles
(see Chapter 7), or Books 1–14. Like other lost book writings, many of the 
collections are fragmented. The dates of this material begin as early as the
third to second centuries BCE, and they continued to be produced and added
to after the seventh to eighth centuries CE.
Typical of all the Sibylline Oracles are somewhat vague “predictions” of the
rise and fall of empires and individual rulers as well as accounts of palace
intrigue (often important for modern historians trying to identify a specific
historic ruler).
Part of the fame and attraction of the Sibylline literature are the difficult and
puzzling passages that lend themselves to multiple interpretations and mean-
ings. Consider one of these odd and even troubling descriptions of events to
come; it’s specific enough to be frightening but vague enough to apply to just
about anything:
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

But when on earth there are raging earthquakes
And thunderbolts, thunders, lightnings . . . and the mildew of the land
And frenzy of jackals and wolves, and slaughters
And destruction of men and bellowing oxen.
Four footed cattle and laboring mules
And goats and sheep, then much farmland
Will be left barren through neglect
And fruits will fail. Selling of free men into slavery
Will be practiced among very many people, and robbing of temples.
Then indeed the tenth generation of men will also appear
After these things, when the earth-shaking lightning-giver
Will break the glory of idols and shake the people of
Seven-hilled Rome. Great wealth will perish . . .
—Sibylline Oracles, 2:5–17
Or check out the following, from later in the same section:
But whenever this sign appears throughout the world,
Children born with gray temples from birth
Afflictions of men, famines, pestilence, and wars
Change of times, lamentations, many tears;
Alas, how many people’s children in the countries will feed
On their parents, with piteous lamentations. They will place
Their flesh in cloaks and bury them in the ground, mother of peoples,
Defiled with blood and lust . . .
—Sibylline Oracles, 2:153–162
The Treatise of Shem
The Treatise of Shem (see Chapter 7 for details), which historians date to no
later than 31–20 BCE, is quite significant for one essential reason: It proves
ancient Jewish interest in the zodiac signs and thus at least some Jewish
interest in the entire realm of astrology. The interest was probably strongest
among Jews living in the Diaspora especially, where they would have had
more contact with astrological lore than other Jews back in the homeland.
So what’s so weird about this writing? Precisely the astrology! The Old
Testament is rather clearly opposed to anything that smacks of “worship-
ping” the stars (check out Deuteronomy 4:19 and 2 Kings 23:5 in particular),
and most historians take this to be a not-too-subtle condemnation of any kind
of astrological speculation. As well, both mainline Jewish and Orthodox
Christian traditions later condemned any kind of astrology as contrary to a
belief in God’s ultimate control of the universe. So, you can see why a docu-
ment like the Treatise would be controversial. It shows the wide variety of
ideas among Jews and Christians in the days before “correct thinking” tended
to weed out unapproved interests.
317
Chapter 17: Ten Weirdest Jewish Lost Books

As a writing, the Treatise of Shem gives clear astrological guidance in the 
general terms familiar to those who are into this kind of stuff, but the guid-
ance is vague enough to be impressive at many different times (such as, 
“You will walk through a door today”). Consider this example:
If the year begins in Aries: The Year will be lean. Even its four-footed
[animals] will die and many clouds will neither be visible nor appear . . .”
—Treatise of Shem 1
Not so strange perhaps, but such predictions get rather odd:
And oil will be valued in Africa; but wheat will be reduced in value in
Damascus and Hauran, but in Palestine it will be valued. And (in that region
there will be) various diseases, and sicknesses, even fighting will occur in it.
But it will be allowed to escape from it and be delivered.
—Treatise of Shem 1
The real oddity of the Treatise is precisely the notion that “fates” are embed-
ded in the cosmos in the astrological sense, that things happen because of
planetary alignments, signs, and signals; this is contrary to the idea of a 
personal God who’s in control of all events. And such astrological thinking
certainly goes against accepted biblical teachings!
The Apocalypse of Zephaniah
The Apocalypse of Zephaniah is a work named for the Prophet Zephaniah of
the Bible only because the visionary says in the writing, “I, Zephaniah, saw
these things in my vision. . . .”
Of course, the Apocalypse was written many centuries after the traditional
time of the Prophet Zephaniah, and thus it was written under a pseudonym
borrowed from the earlier history of ancient Israel. Zephaniah was a biblical
Prophet from the sixth century BCE. The book in the Bible that contains
some of his speeches, what’s known as the biblical book of Zephaniah, is
already interestingly unique because it features visions that were somewhat
unusual for biblical prophets. Some historians suspect that the biblical book
of Zephaniah is a writing that’s already moving in the direction of apocalyp-
tic-like visions that were definitely more common in the later period, begin-
ning in the fourth to third centuries BCE.
This work features notably weird themes that are familiar to readers of the
book of Revelation in the New Testament: for example, angels that blow on
trumpets and descriptive passages where the visionary talks about seeing
people being punished in judgment.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Like other equally weird apocalyptic works, the Apocalypse reads almost like
you, the reader, are walking around the outside of an old downtown depart-
ment store that’s famous for its picture windows. As you walk around gazing
at the different windows (which are the scenes in the story), you become
increasingly alarmed at the scenes of suffering, punishment, and lamentation.
Certainly not the kind of store you want to shop in!
As you can imagine, then, this vision has a very personal impact on the
visionary, Zephaniah. For example, in one window (that is, scene) Zephaniah
sees people being punished in Hades by horrible-looking creatures, and he
wonders what they are. Zephaniah is told about these ugly angels who carry
off the bad people:
He said to me: “These are the servants of all creation who come to the souls
of ungodly men and bring them and leave them in this place. They spend
three days going around with them in the air before they bring them and cast
them into their eternal punishment.
I said, “I beseech you, O Lord, don’t give them authority to come to me.” 
The Angel said, “Don’t fear. I will not permit them to come to you because
you are pure before the Lord.”
—Apocalypse of Zephaniah 4
The notion that sins are kept track of in heaven in a kind of holy ledger is
affirmed in this writing:
Then I looked, and I saw him with a manuscript in his hand. He began to
unroll it. Now after he spread it out, I read it in my own language. I found
that all my sins which I had done were written in it, those which I had done
from my youth until this day. They were all written upon that manuscript of
mine with there being a false word in them. If I did not go visit a sick man or
a widow, I found it written down as a shortcoming upon my manuscript . . .
—Apocalypse of Zephaniah 7
By the ninth chapter, Zephaniah gets good news: “Be courageous! . . . Your
name is written in the Book of the Living!” So, in the end, the work encour-
ages the reader to work so that his or her life is listed in the right book!
The Apocalypse of Adam (From the 
Nag Hammadi Library)
The Apocalypse of Adam is a Gnostic writing found among the Nag Hammadi
manuscripts discovered in Egypt in the mid-20th century (see Chapter 12 for
more on the Nag Hammadi manuscripts). The son of Adam, named Seth, was
very important in some subsects of Gnostic belief because he was supposed
319
Chapter 17: Ten Weirdest Jewish Lost Books

to be the one to whom Adam revealed many secrets. Seth passed the secrets
on to the people who called themselves Gnostics.
There were many Christian Gnostic writings, but the Apocalypse of Adam
appears to be a Gnostic Jewish writing — that is, a work that draws on the
Jewish rather than the Christian tradition to argue Gnostic beliefs.
The Gnostics were a strange group to begin with. They believed that the
material world wasn’t “real” in any profound sense and the only “reality” was
spiritual. They also thought that the “God” of the Hebrews, the creator of this
world, was an evil god who tries to cover up the truth about the Higher God,
the God of Light and Truth. Thus, in other Gnostic writings (which, not sur-
prisingly, are quite strange as well), the Hebrew biblical narrative is typically
told as a narrative of enslavement to an evil god who doesn’t want humans to
know the truth.
The Apocalypse of Adam speaks of Adam and Eve originally knowing that
they were superior to the god that made them because they were partly
formed from the light of the higher God. Eventually, however, they “fell” and
lost their knowledge of this higher God. Here, Adam and Eve become
“enslaved” to the lesser god:
Next, we became acquainted with the god that made us. For we were not
alien to his powers. And we served him in fear and servility. And after this,
we became dark in our hearts and I, for my part, was asleep in the thinking
of my heart.
—Apocalypse of Adam 1–2
But, according to the writing, an “Illuminator” will come with the truth. A long
poetic sequence describes aspects of this Illuminator as one who was care-
fully chosen and cared for by the angels of the Higher God; each section of
the sequence ends with the phrase, “thus, he came to the water.” This person
eventually reveals the truth to humanity, which is the knowledge now being
passed to the safekeeping of Seth, according to this writing. It seems possible
that this writing had something to do with a kind of water ritual (perhaps a
sort of baptism or a Jewish “Mikvah”) of entry into a Gnostic sect because
water and “coming to the water” are themes throughout the entire work.
Although most of the surviving Gnostic writings are Christian, the
Apocalypse of Adam stands out as one that appears to have no specifically
Christian elements at all, suggesting the wide range of religious themes and
sources that Gnostic religious writers could use in the ancient world.
Whereas the Christian Gnostics emphasized the coming of Jesus to bring the
true knowledge of the higher God of Light, in the Apocalypse of Adam, a
Hebrew story (Creation) is used to express some of the same Gnostic themes.
The book makes the “weird” list mainly because of the boldness of changing
the biblical tradition in order to argue against the biblical tradition!

Chapter 18
Ten Weirdest Christian Lost Books
In This Chapter
 Exploring unusual imagery and miracles
 Looking at Jesus from different perspectives
 Touching on some really cryptic writings
“W
eirdness,” of course, is in the eye of the beholder. We can already
hear many of our colleagues in historical studies and biblical
studies bemoaning our selections for weird lost books and e-mailing us to
say, “How can you guys call that weird!?? It’s terribly important!!”
Well, weird doesn’t necessarily mean “unimportant,” but it does mean (to us,
anyway) that these writings include one or more of the following:
 Strange images
 Arguments that don’t appear rational or even sensible
 Ideas that strike modern readers as quite contrary to the spirit of the
Bible (for example, violent images used in relation to Jesus)
In this chapter, weirdness abounds (always an appealing notion, right?) as we
share with you our list of the ten weirdest Christian lost books. (You can find
our ten weirdest Jewish lost books in Chapter 17.)
The Shepherd of Hermas
The Shepherd of Hermas is a book filled with strange visions that a certain
early Christian perceived and then wrote about in this work. It’s a bit long
and can get a bit tedious, but it was very popular among early Christians.
Some Christians even grouped it with other books that became the New
Testament! The Shepherd of Hermas didn’t make the final cut, of course, but
it deserves recognition as the kind of “Christian folklore” that was once very
popular reading indeed.

In the parables, the largest section of the work, there are three main images
that represent different forms of the same general message about the composi-
tion of the church and different kinds of people in it. The images are as follows:
 The different kinds of Christians represented by different bricks that
make up the “tower” of the Church
 Different plants that are seedlings cut from the “tree” that is the Church
 Material drawn from different “mountains” to build the Church
The parables are sometimes quite clear, but the tone taken in the Shepherd’s
conversations with Hermas is very odd. For example, after telling Hermas a
parable, Hermas quite rationally asks to have it explained:
I begged him fervently to explain to me the parable of the field, the master,
the vineyard, and the slave who built a fence around the vineyard . . . he
answered me, “You are extremely brazen in your requests. You should ask
nothing at all, for if anything needs to be explained to you, it will be.” I said
to him, “Lord there is no point in showing me something that you do not
explain, when I do not know what it is.”
—Shepherd of Hermas (Visions, 11:1–2)
The Shepherd tells Hermas that he’s brazen and shouldn’t ask so many ques-
tions . . . but then proceeds to tell him that because Hermas is persistent, the
Shepherd will explain the parables to him.
Hermas strikes us as entirely reasonable in his requests and the Shepherd as
impatient and callous! If we spoke to any of our students that way, neither of
us would be teaching much longer!
In general, we think this book is strange because it seems to actually delight
in its mystery and puzzles. The visions, when explained, seem sensible
enough — so why not just get to the point? Why the puzzles, visions,
imagery, and impatient questions? Are these elements used simply because
they’re entertaining, or perhaps because “visions” have their own kind of
authority that demands attention? Hmm . . . maybe we should say, “I had this
vision . . .” more often than, “I had an idea the other day. . . .” It does have a
certain ring to it, eh?
The Gospel of Peter
One of the famous so-called lost Gospels is the Gospel of Peter. In this Gospel,
the Resurrection of Jesus is portrayed in grand fashion: It features a descrip-
tion of how God sent down two angels to open the tomb of Jesus and how the
soldiers guarding the tomb saw it all. At that point, however, things start to
get a bit strange; consider this passage:
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

. . . [The soldiers] saw three men come out from the sepulcher, two of them
supporting the other and a cross following them and the heads of the two
reaching to heaven, but that of him who was being led reached beyond the
heavens. And they heard a voice out of the heavens crying, “Have you
preached to those who sleep?” and from the cross there was heard the
answer, “Yes.”
—Gospel of Peter, lines 39–42
Essentially, the Gospel claims that Jesus and the angels walk out of the tomb
followed by a walking and talking wooden cross. The idea of the “talking
cross” has especially fascinated modern scholars, who wonder what this
image is intended to communicate.
Symbolic scenes figure prominently in some Gnostic circles and certainly in
apocalyptic visions, so either tradition could have influenced the presenta-
tion here. However, we categorize this early Christian writing in this “weird”
list because it’s difficult to understand, particularly why it was considered
important or even inspiring to have the cross speak. (What may be even
weirder is that early readers were impressed with this notion!)
The Martyrdom of Polycarp
Given that early Christianity faced a series of horrendous persecutions, it’s
hardly surprising that stories of the courageous martyrdom of early Church
leaders became an important form of early Christian literature.
The Martyrdom of Polycarp is a very early example of this kind of Christian 
literature that also happens to feature some unusual miracles along the way,
which is why this work is part of the list in this chapter.
Polycarp was an early Bishop in Smyrna (today it’s Izmir in Turkey). It’s inter-
esting to note that during his persecution, Polycarp was offered release if he
only confessed, “Caesar is Lord,” but he refused. In an act of impressive defi-
ance, he was told to turn to his fellow Christians and say “Away with the 
atheists,” but instead, he turned to the Roman officials and crowds and said
to them, “Away with the atheists!” This kind of early Christian brassy and
nonviolent courage is quite admirable, in our opinion!
But as we said earlier, some of the miracles described in this work are a bit
strange. As in many martyrdom accounts, there are interesting miracles asso-
ciated with the death. When the officials try to burn Polycarp alive, a miracle
occurs that spares him from the flames, but then a Roman soldier stabs him
with a lance. At once, a dove emerges (perhaps it’s his rising spirit), and the
gushing blood extinguishes the flames. Of course, martyrs couldn’t always
count on miracles to save them, and often the miracles described in early
323
Chapter 18: Ten Weirdest Christian Lost Books

Christian literature accompany the martyrs’ deaths rather than prevent
them, but these unusual events suggest a power greater than the power that
executes the believers!
The weirdness of the Martyrdom of Polycarp comes partly from the notion
that early Christians actually treasured stories of their leaders being exe-
cuted. This is hardly a modern idea of inspiring literature, and it forces read-
ers to recognize that early Christians lived in quite different circumstances,
where accepting the possibility of execution for their beliefs was a sign of
strength, not weakness.
The Epistle of Barnabas
We list the Epistle of Barnabas in the “weird” category, but we’d also list it in
the “dangerous” category, if there was one!
The Epistle, which is not believed to have been written by the famous com-
panion of Paul (refer to Acts 4:26, 9:27, and elsewhere), is a letter that sadly
reveals the extent of anger and argument between early Christians and Jews
in the first two centuries of Christianity. Because of a reference to possibly
“rebuilding” the Temple (destroyed by Roman soldiers in 70 CE), this work is
clearly written after 70 CE. Also, you should keep in mind that there’s a much
later writing (which comes after the time of Muhammad and the beginnings
of Islam in the seventh century CE) called the Gospel of Barnabas that isn’t
related to the Epistle of Barnabas, which is much older.
The Epistle is a sustained attack on Jewish tradition, probably directed
against Jewish-Christians who continued to practice their Jewish religious
and ritual life while accepting the identity of Jesus as the promised Messiah.
This particular form of early Christianity, often identified as Jewish-
Christianity, died out by the fifth to sixth centuries CE. After reading The
Epistle of Barnabas, one hardly wonders why!
While it’s true that the Epistle of Barnabas is not all negative (some of it is
actually quite nice), we think we can live without a Christian calling Jews
“wretches”:
I will also speak to you about the Temple, since those wretches were
misguided in hoping in the building rather than in their God who made
them, as if the Temple were actually the house of God . . .
—Epistle of Barnabas 16:1
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The general tone of the Epistle is that the promises of the Hebrew Scriptures
to the Jews were really about Christians — and Christians replace the Jews 
as the true people of God. Such arguments aren’t unique to this writing, of
course, but they become especially problematic in writings that were as
widely read as the Epistle of Barnabas. A good antidote to Barnabas, inciden-
tally, is Paul’s Epistle to Romans in the New Testament, which clearly teaches
that God is not “finished” with Jews and Judaism!
Anti-Semitism has been a horrendous legacy of some forms of Christianity,
and the Epistle reveals how nasty this attitude could be already in the early
centuries of Christianity. Hopefully, reading it will remind modern audiences
to be much more vigilant about the dangers of hateful or dismissive speech!
The Infancy Gospel of Thomas
If you’re intrigued rather than repulsed by the idea of Jesus being a naughty
little boy before he “matured” into understanding his identity as the Messiah,
then the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is the book for you.
The young Jesus is portrayed in the early part of this writing as a mouthy,
bratty, headstrong kid who “zaps” other kids dead on the spot for messing
with his playtime or for bumping into him. Later versions of these legends try
hard to portray the events in a more positive light (the boy who bumped him
was a bully, and so on), but this does little to remove the initial shock of read-
ing the Infancy Gospel. When Mary and Joseph’s neighbors complain, they’re
struck blind by Jesus.
The point of this writing seems to be that Jesus eventually grows up and gets
it. By the age of 12, he realizes what he’s called to do — preach compassion
and engage in healing. But the opening sequences are a bit startling for
modern Christians who aren’t used to thinking of Jesus as a troubled kid!
Unless you have a bratty kid who you hope will grow up to be great some
day, this story may leave you with the question, “Why did any early
Christians find these stories inspiring?”
One likely answer is this: If the young Jesus had a few things to learn, like real
humans inevitably do, the story is an effective way of arguing that Jesus was
fully human in all ways as well as the “Son of God” and Messiah. It’s always
hard to relate to someone who’s perfect in every way. Historians know that
the identity of Jesus as both “human” and “divine” was a subject of constant
325
Chapter 18: Ten Weirdest Christian Lost Books

Christian debate, and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is one interesting —
although certainly unconventional — way to argue the “humanness” of Jesus
by arguing that as a youth, he experienced the need to mature and grow in
wisdom like humans do. After all, Luke 2:52 says that Jesus “grew in wisdom,”
suggesting that Jesus didn’t know everything from birth!
Valentinus: On Jesus’s Digestive System
One of the most important Gnostic leaders, Valentinus (100–170 CE), is
quoted by an early Christian writer named St. Clement of Alexandria. In this
otherwise lost work, Valentinus comments on Jesus’s digestive system
because he was determined to deny that Jesus was a normal human being
like others. The full humanity of Jesus is affirmed by most Orthodox
Christians. Consider Valentinus’s argument:
He was continent, enduring all things. Jesus digested divinity: he ate and
drank in a special way, without excreting his solids. He had such a great
capacity for continence that the nourishment within him was not corrupted,
for he did not experience corruption.
—Epistle of Valentinus to Agathopous
(quoted in St. Clement of Alexandria, tr. Layton, 238)
Maybe it’s a good thing that this Epistle from Valentinus is still lost, eh? It
shows you the extent to which ancients tried to debate the exact relationship
between the physical and spiritual natures of Jesus (human and God). This
argument raged for centuries, incidentally, and was the subject of major
church gatherings in the first six centuries of Christianity.
The Gospel of Truth (From the 
Nag Hammadi Library)
One of the most important writings from Valentinus (see the previous sec-
tion), the Gospel of Truth, was found among the Nag Hammadi materials. It’s
among the clearer Gnostic writings and at times is quite moving. One can
begin to actually see the attraction that Gnostic interpretations of Jesus must
have had for those with a certain attraction to the mystical. (See Chapter12
for an in-depth discussion of Gnosticism and Gnostic writings.)
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

In the following passage from the Gospel of Truth, Jesus becoming humanlike
is explained as an act of God’s compassion to be more easily known to
humans. However, even as the general idea comes across, the imagery main-
tains its Gnostic “foreignness”:
Acquaintance from the father and the appearance of his son gave them a
means to comprehend. For when they saw and heard him, he let them taste
and smell of himself and touch the beloved son, after he had appeared to
tell them about the father, the uncontained, and had breathed into them
what was in the thought (of the father) doing his will. When many had
received the light, they converted to him, for they were strangers and did not
see his image and had not recognized him.
—Gospel of Truth 5:23–36 (tr. Layton, 259)
Calling the higher God the “uncontained” one, calling the divine within
humans part of the “thought” of the Father that was “breathed” into them,
and referring to Christian conversion as acquiring knowledge (rather than
acknowledging God’s actions in the world through Jesus) are all rather
strange notions that are typical of Gnostic Christianity. There’s little empha-
sis on the material, the world, and the humanness of Jesus; in some ways the
Gospel of Truth is the opposite of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, which
depicts Jesus as perhaps a bit too human (see the “Infancy Gospel of
Thomas” section earlier in this chapter).
The Acts of Andrew
You may have guessed that we really like the early Christian folklore that’s
featured in these various “Acts of . . .” books that tell strange and wonderful
stories of early Apostles like Thomas, Peter, Paul, and this one dealing with
Andrew. (Chapter 15 describes many of these early Acts stories.)
However, as this is the “weirdest” category, we confess that the Acts of
Andrew is our least favorite of this genre because it seems that Andrew is
most concerned with keeping people pure from engaging in sex — any sex —
whether it’s between married or unmarried people!
The attitude in this book reveals that there were early groups of Christians
who thought that all sexuality was evil, despite Paul’s advice to people who
want to get married that they should get married and sleep together! (If you
don’t believe us, read 1 Corinthians 7.) Despite its bad rap, Christianity is not
“anti-sex,” so this work goes completely against what’s taught in the Bible
with ideas like the following passage, in which Andrew counsels a female 
convert who’s resisting all sexual intercourse with her husband, Aegeates:
327
Chapter 18: Ten Weirdest Christian Lost Books

“O Maximilla, my child,” Andrew replied, “I know that you have been
moved to resist any proposition of sexual intercourse and wish to be
dissociated from a foul and filthy way of life . . . Maximilla, do not commit
this act! Do not submit to Aegeates’ threat. Do not be moved by his speech.”
—Acts of Andrew 37 (tr. Elliott, 256)
Even at the end, the Acts of Andrew confirms its “anti-material” attitude by
teaching that the body is not important; Andrew’s death isn’t even very
important to him because it’s the soul that’s truly “real.”
The First Thought in Three Forms 
(From the Nag Hammadi Library)
Try this one on for size:
It is I who am the sound that exists
Bestowing sound upon everyone;
And they recognize that a posterity exists within [me]
It is I who am the parent’s thinking;
And from me emanated sound, that is acquaintance with the infinites:
I exist as the thinking of the entirety
Being joined to unrecognizable and incomprehensible thinking
I personally showed myself forth among all those that had recognized me.
—First Thought in Three Forms, 36:14–22 (tr. Layton, 90)
If your reaction to this excerpt from the Gnostic First Thought in Three Forms
is some version of, “Um, could you run that by me again, please?” then we all
agree that this is mighty strange stuff. Imagine sitting in a meeting where this
is read out loud . . . and people around you are nodding their heads and
saying, “Oh yes!” “Amen,” and “That’s right!” Frankly, we would wonder what
we were missing.
Gnostic literature attempts to explain the origins of beings, often suggesting
that beings other than the original God came into existence by first being
“thoughts” of the original God. Those thoughts then take on life on their own
and then get into conflicts. The literature eventually explains that humanity
gets caught in the midst of these spiritual, ethereal conflicts. Some people
found these writings inspirational and informative . . . and we find that about
as disturbing as the writings themselves, but perhaps we need to be more
open-minded . . .
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Reality of the Rulers (From the 
Nag Hammadi Library)
As with the preceding section, we can barely make sense of this work either.
The Reality of the Rulers is another good example (we suppose . . .) of Gnostic
spirituality at its best (or worst). Hard to read, hard to understand, and filled
with obscure references. As we say about the First Thought in Three Forms,
the amazing thing about some of these writings is that some early Christians
actually liked this stuff and were able to make sense of it. Our opinion is that
something was in their brownies, but don’t take our word for it . . . have a
little sample (of the book, that is, not the brownies):
This Ruler, by being androgynous, made itself a vast realm, an extent
without limit. And it contemplated creating offspring for itself, and created
for itself seven offspring, androgynous just like their parent. And it said to its
offspring, “It is I who am the god of the entirety.”
—Reality of the Rulers 94–95
Scholars can discern that this work is mostly about the Creation accounts,
but the specific details are elusive, to say the least. Furthermore, we’re gener-
ally nervous about writings that are so vague that anyone can read just about
anything they want into them. We have a bad enough time with the real New
Testament . . . we hardly need more confusion, now, do we?
Still, it’s important to be as respectful as possible. A large number of Gnostic
Christians suffered some severe abuse (at the least) and persecutions 
(at worst) for treasuring this kind of writing. Just because today’s readers
think it odd doesn’t mean for a split second that those who did love this stuff
deserved anything worse than a respectful debate!

S
ome early sayings of Jesus are quite different from the four “canonical”
Gospels. Although these utterances don’t abound, they are out there and
deserve some attention. We look at ten of them in this chapter and tell you
why they’re noteworthy.
The most important early source of such sayings is the Gospel of Thomas
from the second century CE, but Jesus’s quotes also appear in the works of
early Christian writers like Origen, Tertullian, and Jerome. (It seems that these
guys had access to writings that are now lost.) Many scholars have gathered
up most of these sayings and then asked themselves, “Do any of these sound
genuine?” This study raises interesting questions, like whether these “sayings”
sound like other known Jesus sayings or even sound like a first century Jewish
teacher! And the answers are sometimes yes, sometimes no.
We’re not just interested in those sayings that are the most likely to really be
Jesus. We’re also interested in sayings that seem to accurately portray the
historical Jesus — in other words, statements that are very close to the spirit
of Jesus. So, as a Quaker biblical scholar, I (Daniel) understand the historical
Jesus to be, at the very least, a profoundly revolutionary teacher who taught
about social as well as spiritual change and justice and who also advocated
nonviolence over violence as the means to work for that change.
Therefore, my selection of “top ten” sayings of Jesus not in the Gospels is
influenced by my own background. Others would choose differently, and
from different sources. But then again, that’s part of the fun of being different
kinds of people, right?

Take Care of Your Brothers
Source: The Gospel of the Hebrews/Nazarenes, a lost Gospel only rarely
quoted in Pseudo-Origen (possibly after 250 CE); and other early Christian
writings
Another rich man said to him, “Master, what good things shall I do to live?”
He said to him, “O man, fulfill the law and the prophets.” He replied, “I have
done that.” He said to him, “Go, sell all that you possess and distribute it to
the poor, and come, follow me.” But the rich man began to scratch his head
and it did not please him. And the Lord said to him, “How can you say, ‘I
have fulfilled the law and the prophets’ since it is written in the law: You
shall love your neighbor as yourself, and lo! Many of your brethren, sons of
Abraham, are clothed in filth, dying of hunger, and your house is full of
many goods, and nothing at all goes out of it to them.” And returning to
Simon, his disciple, who was sitting by him, he said, “Simon, son of Jonas, 
it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man (to
enter) the kingdom of heaven.”
—Gospel of the Nazarenes
Many will recognize that, according to The Gospel of Matthew, Jesus said
something very much like this already. Following is an excerpt from the
Gospel of Matthew:
The young man said to him, “I have kept all these; what do I still lack?”
Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and
give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then
come, follow me.” When the young man heard this word, he went away
grieving, for he had many possessions. Then Jesus said to his disciples,
“Truly I tell you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” When
the disciples heard this, they were greatly astounded and said, “Then who
can be saved?” But Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is
impossible, but for God all things are possible.”
—Matthew 19:20–26
When you compare the Gospel of Matthew to the Gospel of the Nazarenes,
you see that the Gospel of the Nazarenes has Jesus going into much greater
detail about the social expectations of what it means to share with each other
and take responsibility for each other. So, for some readers, the Nazarene 
version seems to be more Jewish in its social concerns for others.

Near the Fire
Source: Origen, an early Christian theologian (185–254 CE); the Gospel of
Thomas (second century CE)
In his work entitled Sermons on Jeremiah, Origen refers to a quote from Jesus
that he’s not sure is genuine; modern New Testament scholars are more con-
vinced of the source because the quote also occurs in the Gospel of Thomas:
He who is near me is near the fire. He who is far from me is far from the
kingdom.
This saying isn’t so different from the strong self-identification statements
that Jesus makes in the Gospel of John, but it combines this idea with the
strong teachings of Jesus on the “Kingdom of God” more typical of the Gospel
of Mark.
More on Fire!
Source: Gospel of Thomas (second century CE)
The really interesting thing about this saying is that it seems related to the
previous saying from Origen in that Jesus is talking about the Kingdom of
God with the element of “fire.” This use of fire in a positive sense seems 
typical of Jesus and his use of somewhat shocking images, such as serpents.
In short, it does sound like him!
Jesus said, “I have cast fire on the world, and behold, I guard it until it
blazes.”
John the Baptist talks of Jesus baptizing with fire (Luke 3:16), and Jesus
describes his work as “bringing fire”:
I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!
—Luke 12:49
Make Your Enemies into Comrades
Source: Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 1224, an early Greek fragment from the third to
fourth centuries CE
And pray for your enemies. For he who is not against is with you. He who
today is far-off — tomorrow will near to you. . . .
333
Chapter 19: Ten Sayings of Jesus You Won’t Find in the Bible

This quote is a clear combination of two otherwise well-known sayings of
Jesus:
John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your
name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.” But
Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him; for whoever is not against you is for
you.”
—Luke 9:49–50
You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your
enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who
persecute you . . .
—Matthew 5:43–44
One can argue that Jesus could have said the words from Oxyrhynchus
Papyrus 1224 precisely because he definitely said things just like it! But the
combination in the Greek fragment puts a much stronger emphasis on the
positive results that can come from “loving enemies” — one of the most diffi-
cult sayings of Jesus. Here you see Jesus as a practical teacher of diplomacy
and peacemaking — and the potential results.
The Importance of Making Peace
Source: Gospel of Thomas (second century CE)
Jesus said, “If two make peace with one another in the same house, they
will say to the mountain, ‘Be moved!’ and it will be moved.”
—Gospel of Thomas 48
This is an adaptation of Jesus’s teaching on moving mountains already known
in the Gospel tradition, although in Thomas, the emphasis is on the relation-
ship of people. In Mark and Matthew, the emphasis is on faith in God; here’s
an example from Mark:
Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. Truly I tell you, if you say to this
mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and if you do not doubt in
your heart, but believe that what you say will come to pass, it will be done
for you . . .”
—Mark 11:22–23

Care for Your Brother!
Source: Jerome’s (347–420 CE) “Commentaries on Ephesians,” and “Ezekiel”
The Lord said to his disciples: And never be joyful, save when you behold
your brother with love.
This quote is similar to another saying that Jerome quotes from this same
alleged source (now lost); Jerome writes:
In the Gospel According to the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes read, there is
counted among the most grievous offences: ‘. . . He that has grieved the
spirit of his brother . . .’
These quotes are arguably “more Jewish” in that they’re strongly ethical, 
not only “spiritual” — that is, they’re connected to issues in the world 
(like people taking care of each other) and not just issues of spiritual 
significance. In short, they’re political as well as spiritual!
The Upside-Down Kingdom
Source: The Gospel of Thomas (second century CE)
Jesus said, “The man advanced in days will not hesitate to ask an infant of
seven days about the place of life, and he shall live. For many who are first
will be last . . .”
In this phrase, the Gospel of Thomas has combined in a tighter saying what
may have been implied in the context in Mark 9. Note the connection between
receiving children and Jesus’s famous phrase about role reversal (social
reversal) in the Kingdom of God:
He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “Whoever wants to be first
must be last of all and servant of all.” Then he took a little child and put it
among them; and taking it in his arms, he said to them, “Whoever welcomes
one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me
welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”
—Mark 9:35–37
335
Chapter 19: Ten Sayings of Jesus You Won’t Find in the Bible

The Empty Jar of Meal
Source: The Gospel of Thomas (second century CE)
Jesus said, “The Kingdom of the Father is like a woman who was carrying a
jar which was full of meal. While she was walking on a long road the handle
of the jar broke; the meal spilled out behind her on the road. She did not
notice it; she was unaware of the accident. When she came to her house she
put the jar down and found it was empty . . .”
This short parable has no parallel in the Gospel accounts, but it seems simi-
lar to the spirit of Jesus when he talks about unintentional goodness — going
about your life doing the right thing without seeking publicity and attention
so that others will see that your good life has an impact on the world. This is
the opposite spirit to spin doctors and publicity agents, to put it in modern
terms. Here’s an example from Matthew:
But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand
is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees
in secret will reward you.
—Matthew 6:3–4
The Muslim Jesus?
Source: Exterior mosque carving; also found in “Abdallah ibn Qutayba” (ninth
century CE)
On the South Wall of the Great Mosque at Fathpur Sikri (in India), there’s a
fascinating quote attributed to Jesus. This city was built by the famous Indian
monarch, Akbar, in the 16th century but was in use only ten years. By 1605, it
was largely deserted because of the inadequate water supply. Carved on the
Buland Darwaza (Gate of Victory) is the following saying:
Jesus, on whom be peace, has said: “The world is a bridge. Go over it, but
do not build a house upon it!”
This saying, as well as the one covered in the next section, comes from
Islamic tradition; we chose to include them in this list to illustrate that Islam,
of course, also honors a rich tradition of Jesus sayings. They all came late in
the game, of course, as Islam began 600 years after the time of Jesus. But
they’re still fascinating and occasionally quite moving. In this saying, Jesus
advises one to not become too attached to the things of this world — like
riches, fame, and power — but keep one’s mind on the values of God! Of
course, the saying expresses this message with much more poetic grace and
the kind of memorable images so typical of Jesus.

The Greater Spirituality
Source: Abdallah ibn Qutayba (ninth century CE)
Jesus met a man and asked him, “What are you doing?” “I am devoting
myself to God,” the man replied. Jesus asked, “Who is caring for you?” 
“My brother,” replied the man. Jesus said, “Your brother is more devoted to
God than you are.”
I (Daniel) confess that I love this last one. Tarif Khalidi cites it in his wonder-
ful book, The Muslim Jesus; Khalidi uses it as quoted by an early Islamic the-
ologian who died in 884 CE. Islam, of course, honors the teaching and legacy
of Jesus very highly, although not as a human embodiment of God as most
Christian traditions do.
It’s not surprising, then, that Islam maintains a large number of teachings
associated with Jesus, some of them clearly based on the known Gospels but
others very much in the spirit of Jesus, like this gem. This saying reveals clear
emphasis on the practical spirituality of Jesus — a spirituality that stresses
the importance of people taking care of each other!

Top Ten “Lost” Books Every
Student of the Bible Should Read
In This Chapter
 Exploring works that expand upon biblical material
 Comparing what Jesus said with what he may have said
 Appreciating the diversity of views and creative expressions in both Christianity and
early Judaism
T
hey may not have made it into the Bible, but their historical, doctrinal,
narrative, and spiritual significance make these ten books “must reads”
for serious students of the Bible.
All the works that we address in this chapter are available in books or online
and are well worth your time. Experiencing these lost books will enhance
your understanding and appreciation of the Bible as it’s known today.
The Gospel of Thomas
The Gospel of Thomas is a very early collection of sayings of Jesus arranged
in a list without the normal narrative or description of the events in the life of
Jesus that you read in the Gospels of the New Testament. It has been dated as
early as the late first century or early second century CE.
Many of the alleged sayings of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas are clearly influ-
enced by the early Christian “heresy” (or should we say “disagreement”)
known as Gnosticism, which emphasized “secret knowledge” as the way to
salvation. This knowledge was also characterized by a definite downgrading
of the physical world and physical bodies as less important — and even
something to be “denied” — as a way to develop the soul or spirit, which was
considered far more important. We devote Chapter 12 to Gnosticism and
Gnostic Christian writings.

New Testament scholars have been taking the Gospel of Thomas increasingly
seriously as a very important non-canonical series of teachings of Jesus.
Does it contain some “lost” sayings of Jesus? Maybe, but the whole thing
makes fascinating reading regardless.
Some of the sayings attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas are rather
questionable, have Gnostic tendencies, and are dismissed by New Testament
scholars as contrary to known sayings of Jesus. However, some of the sayings
in Thomas are eerily familiar; they sound so much like Jesus that they may
well be his and simply weren’t preserved in the Gospels of the New
Testament.
Another really important reason to know about Thomas actually has to do
with the books of Luke and Matthew. One of the most important theories
about the origins of Luke and Matthew is called the two source theory. This
theory suggests that the writers of Luke and Matthew used two books, or
“sources,” to help them write their Gospels — especially those parts in Luke
and Matthew that are virtually the same. The theory also suggests that the
writers copied some parts of their works from older sources. One source is
definitely the Gospel of Mark, thought to be the oldest Gospel. The other
source is called “Q” for the German word “quelle,” which means “source.”
This was a theorized collection of Jesus sayings that may have circulated
before the Gospels were written. Such a collection of sayings was disputed by
many . . . until Thomas was discovered and proved that such “collections of
sayings” did in fact exist as a form of early Christian literature. Thomas isn’t
“Q,” but it shows that there were writings that simply listed sayings — much
like “Q” was supposed to be.
1 Enoch
1 Enoch is a long book that claims to be a record of the experiences of the
enigmatic figure known as Enoch in the book of Genesis 5:24. That verse sug-
gests that Enoch was taken up into heaven without dying, so the book called
1 Enoch is a report that he made to his son after he came back to earth and
described his journeys in heaven. The only full version of 1 Enoch is in
Ethiopic because it was preserved for centuries by the Ethiopian Christians,
who revered it as virtually “Sacred Scripture.” The work was rediscovered by
westerners in the 18th century.
1 Enoch is weird (see its inclusion in Chapter 17), but it’s also terribly impor-
tant and at times downright fascinating (especially the long allegorical sec-
tion that describes Old Testament history as adventures of sheep, goats,
wolves, and other four-legged friends!). 1 Enoch helps you understand 
the development of Jewish writing about “end times,” commonly called 
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

apocalyptic writing. Presently, 1 Enoch is the oldest example of this style of
writing that exists. Pieces of it were found in the Dead Sea material, dated as
early as 300–200 BCE.
It’s clear that 1 Enoch was terribly important to many people and was 
widely read by Jews and Christians — it is even quoted in Jude in the New
Testament. Furthermore, 1 Enoch proves that there were many different
kinds of Jewish belief in the centuries before Christianity, and it establishes
that at least some Jews were expecting a Messiah very similar to what Jesus
later was!
1 Clement
We’re often asked if there are any early Christian writings that we would have
included in the New Testament if it had been up to us. Frankly, that’s a dan-
gerous question, because if it were up to modern readers, the Bible might be
twice its existing length for some or half as long for others! But if we were
asked, we think we have a pretty good answer: We would have been open to
including 1 Clement.
1 Clement praises peace and harmony between Christians, and in our opin-
ion, Christians could use a lot more peace and harmony! The letter from
Clement (and there’s little doubt that it’s written in standard letter form) is
now traditionally divided into 65 chapters, but the work isn’t as long as you
may think because some of the chapters are only five or six verses long.
Even though 1 Clement was actually part of some early collections of the so-
called important Christian writings that eventually led to the final version of
the New Testament, the work has gotten a bad rap in some circles because
the writer wants to restore some leaders in a church in which the older lead-
ers have been deposed. So 1 Clement is often read as a kind of conservative
call to keep the old guard in power and sometimes is used to defend the
status quo! We doubt that the book is that conservative, and moreover, the
conservatism is not a major part of 1 Clement. Most of the book is a compas-
sionate and concerned pleading from an early Christian leader to other
Christians that asks, to quote Rodney King, “Can’t we all just get along?”
Joseph and Asenath
Joseph and Asenath is an excellent example of ancient Jewish pious story-
telling at its best — charming, entertaining, and at times actually quite
moving. It’s an example of the kind of writings that use the Bible as the basis
341
Chapter 20: Top Ten “Lost” Books Every Student of the Bible Should Read

for spinning out further elaborations, and some of these elaborations reveal
more about the later times than those times in the story itself. In this case,
the conversion of Asenath in order to marry Joseph raises interesting ques-
tions about conversions to Judaism in the Greek and Roman period, but not
the actual “time” of Joseph. Possibly written before Christianity in the first
century BCE, this story tells a much-expanded version of the tales of Joseph
in Egypt and goes far beyond the material in the closing chapters of the book
of Genesis.
Often referred to as a “biblical romance,” the story features Joseph working
as an official under Pharaoh and falling in love with a beautiful but very head-
strong Egyptian woman. She eventually converts to Judaism and becomes
Joseph’s wife (or we should say that she first falls for him, but we don’t want
to give away too much of a great story!).
Of course, this writing addresses some serious subjects. It may well have fea-
tured in debates among Jews with regard to the permissibility of marriage
with non-Jews and under which conditions this was acceptable. Furthermore,
the more positive statements about Jews living in Egypt may have reflected
Jewish life in the Egyptian diaspora in the centuries just before Christianity,
especially the large Jewish community in the coastal city of Alexandria —
once a very prominent Jewish and later Christian community.
The Odes of Solomon
One day, British Quaker scholar of ancient manuscripts J. Rendal Harris
found a book left in his office in Birmingham, England. It turned out to be 
The Odes of Solomon! Although other versions of the Odes have now been
identified, we confess that we love this story of discovery — an important
ancient writing cannot only be discovered after a search or discovered acci-
dentally, but in this case, it can even be mysteriously delivered to your door!
Not only is the story of how one of the old versions of the Odes of Solomon
turned up a charming tale, the book itself is nothing short of beautiful. The
sheer beauty of the language and the joyful expressions of faith would have
made this, in our opinion, a welcome addition to the Christian Bible.
Moreover, in the poems that make up the Odes, you hear something of the
spirituality of early Jewish Christians. (The general consensus, although
occasionally disputed, is that this is a Christian work deeply influenced by
Jewish ideas, and thus perhaps it was an early “Jewish-Christian” writing.)
Though the book has some rather odd turns of phrase and even some images
that are a bit unorthodox, on the whole it’s quite moving. For example, the
notion that Jesus didn’t really die raises some theological questions — but on
the other hand, it may just be a poetic way of speaking of the Resurrection,
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

or it may be a quite unorthodox statement that Jesus wasn’t actually fully
human and therefore only appeared to die. The latter is an idea that
Christians argued about rather vehemently in the early centuries!
Still, despite these occasional doctrinal hiccups (which were sufficient, how-
ever, to keep the work out of the Christian Bible), we find much of the poetic
imagery of the Odes to be as moving as much of the biblical Psalms.
3 Maccabees
3 Maccabees takes place during the reign of Ptolemy IV, whose throne name
was “Philopator” (he reigned around 221–205 BCE). It’s impossible to know
the precise date of this work (long after Ptolemy IV’s reign, of course), and
some scholars even argue that it may be a veiled reference to much later 
persecutions of Jews, such as in the time of Roman Emperor Augustus, who
started to register Jewish subjects and charge a poll tax sometime around 
24 BCE.
In 3 Maccabees, Ptolemy determines to exterminate the Jews of Alexandria
because he’s angry at his reception in Jerusalem when he tries to enter the
Temple, which is forbidden to non-Jews. He orders that the Jews be rounded
up in a large coliseum and trampled by elephants. But on the first try, the
king oversleeps and doesn’t give the actual order. On the second try, the king
completely forgets about his order and even acts surprised that he would
suggest such a thing! When he recovers his anger in the third attempt, angels
appear and drive the elephants back toward the king’s officials! In the end,
the king repents of his attempts and recognizes the loyalty of his Jewish 
subjects.
3 Maccabees almost has the air of dark comedy. It seems that the stories are
told for pious entertainment, but they also feature an interesting assumption
that even nonviolent resistance will be honored by God through God’s mirac-
ulous intervention. (This is a reminder of the stories of Daniel, particularly
the story of Daniel in the lion’s den and the story in which God miraculously
prevents Jewish martyrs from burning in the fiery furnace.) The historical
reality of the stories of 3 Maccabees is widely doubted, but the stories are
definitely entertaining.
Yet on a more somber note, the stories point to a reality of fearful existence
for Jewish subjects of Greek and Roman Imperial rule. Thus, the stories may
not be literal history, but speaking of severe persecution was definitely based
on the experience of fear and persecution that was only too real for many of
the Jewish communities throughout the centuries before and after the rise of
Christianity.

The Acts of Peter and 
the Twelve Apostles
The Nag Hammadi Library, a collection of 13 bundles of written works discov-
ered in 1945 in Egypt, ranks among the most spectacular discoveries of
ancient Christian texts in the 20th century.
Although virtually all these works are Gnostic in character and therefore 
considered outside the “main” tradition that became Orthodox Christianity,
some of these writings are real treasures — and we consider The Acts of Peter
and the Twelve Apostles to be one of those treasures.
Unlike the esoteric and strange writings that compose most of the Nag
Hammadi Library, the Acts story is a charming tale of the early Christian fol-
lowers of Jesus encountering Jesus in various disguises as they travel on a
fantasy-like journey on an unknown island. The story is filled with allegory
and metaphor about the Gospel message and would make a charming 
children’s tale (well, most of it would anyway . . .).
If you like C.S. Lewis and “Christian fantasy” literature, you’ll be thrilled to
discover that such fantasy literature is among the early, and favorite, styles
of early Christian writing. Themes of the righteousness of the poor, the arro-
gance of the rich and powerful, and the miracle of faith in Jesus are all
expressed in powerful terms in this story.
The Acts of Thomas
The Acts of Thomas features one early Christian tale that’s worth the price of
admission (and worth much of the strange stuff in the rest of the book).
In this early Christian legend, the Apostle Thomas is sent to India and
employed by a king to build him a palace. The king regularly sends Thomas
money, thinking Thomas is hard at work. But Thomas is actually giving all 
the money to the poor and starving. The king finds out, and plans to have
Thomas killed! But just then, the king’s brother dies and his spirit goes to
heaven, where he’s shown a magnificent palace — a palace that Thomas has
been “building” for the king in heaven with Thomas’s good deeds!
The king’s brother is allowed to return to earth briefly to beg the king to
allow him to live in even a basement closet of his magnificent heavenly
palace! The king understands the message and becomes a devoted follower
of Jesus.
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Acts of Paul and Thecla
The story of St. Paul and his ministry to (and later with) Thecla is one of the
most fascinating of the early Acts literature. In this series of legends that
comprises The Acts of Paul and Thecla, Thecla becomes a major female
Christian leader after being converted by listening to Paul. In fact, Thecla
went on to become a very important person in later Christian art and legend,
but we have no idea if the character was based on a real person or entirely a
matter of folklore. But even if her story is folklore . . . it’s mighty good folklore!
When Thecla is threatened with death because she refuses to marry a local
nobleman, the attempt to execute her by burning her at the stake fails
because of miraculous intervention. Attempts made to feed her to wild ani-
mals are also miraculously stopped. The local official who tried to feed her to
the lions is convinced by Thecla’s courage, and Thecla goes on to become a
local Church leader whose preaching converts many.
The big question is why a widely popular Christian legend would feature a
female preacher and leader if women weren’t preachers or leaders in early
Christianity. In short, even if Thecla is a legend, she may well be based on
real female leaders in early Christianity, and that would be good news indeed.
Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs
Like the story of Joseph and Asenath, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs
is another expansion of the biblical tradition written by a Jewish writer in the
years just before Christianity.
The story is based on Jacob’s blessings of his sons in Genesis 48–49. Unlike
the book of Genesis, in the Testaments each of the 12 sons of Jacob do the
talking, often beginning with a confession of his particular sins and then
giving advice to “my children” — the presumed readers of the testaments.
One of the reasons that this particular writing was popular — and continues
to be read with great appreciation — is the profound ethical advice that
many of the brothers give to their readers. In many of these speeches, you
see a striking peacefulness precisely at a time when violent events were rock-
ing the Jewish communities (in the second century BCE through to the first
century CE).
345
Chapter 20: Top Ten “Lost” Books Every Student of the Bible Should Read

Much of the teaching in this writing seems to build toward a picture of
Joseph, whose compassion for his brothers in Egypt in Genesis is seen as a
model of patience and long-suffering. In fact, when you arrive at the
Testament of Joseph, a section suggests that Joseph’s attempts to live a good
life parallel the teaching of Jesus rather dramatically. This is either a
Christian insertion into the work or a rather dramatic anticipation of Jesus’s
teachings in Matthew 25:31–46.

Appendix
Resources for Those Who 
Are Really into This 
“Lost Books” Thing
W
e hope that you’ve read some (or all!) of the Lost Books of the Bible 
For Dummies, made lots of notes in the margins (yes, we write in our
books sometimes!) like “Must read this” or “Wow! Really??” and now you want
to head off to the library or bookstore and start your engines! This appendix
provides a list of the books we recommend to help you on your way. We’ve
included some of the best discussions and best translations of these writings
in English. Enjoy your journey, and maybe we’ll see you in the aisles of the
library (shhhhhhh . . .!).
 Apocryphal Gospels: An Introduction by Hans-Josef Klauck, translated by
Brian McNeil (Continuum, 2003)
This interesting book contains translations of only the materials about
Jesus — not other early Christian literature — and some good notes
from Professor Klauck.
 The Apocryphal New Testament: Being the Apocryphal Gospels, Acts,
Epistles, and Apocalypses by Montague Rhodes (Clarendon Press, 1924)
If you find this book, buy it (and if you find two, send me one!). This was
the standard edition of many of the early Christian writings translated
into English and has since been replaced by the next book in this list,
the masterful translation by J. K. Elliott.
 The Apocryphal New Testament: A Collection of Apocryphal Christian
Literature in an English Translation by J. K. Elliott (Clarendon Press, 1993)
This is it, folks — the main collection of early Christian non-canonical
writings all in one handy volume. It isn’t the cheapest book you’ll ever
buy, but it certainly is one of the most interesting! Professor Elliott is
one of the most knowledgeable scholars working in this field, and his
translations are not only readable but downright elegant!

 The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature edited by Frances Young,
Lewis Ayres, and Andrew Louth (Cambridge University Press, 2004)
If you want a little more historical background about the entire world of
early Christian writings, including early Christian theologians, this is a
very helpful collection of articles. It’s a bit academic, but definitely 
readable.
 Constantine’s Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament by
David L. Dungan (Fortress Press, 2007)
David Dungan has some really fascinating ideas about how Constantine
the Emperor may have intervened in the decisions about what books are
in the Bible and what books aren’t in the Bible. This clearly written
resource makes a compelling argument!
 A Feminist Companion to the New Testament Apocrypha edited by 
Amy-Jill Levine (Continuum, 2006)
There are lots of materials in the lost books category that relate to
issues dealing with women in early Christianity. If these issues matter to
you (and they should matter to all of us, really), then the scholars who
contributed to this resource have provided some helpful notes to many
early Christian lost books.
 The Five Gospels: What did Jesus Really Say? by Robert W. Funk, 
Roy W. Hoover, and The Jesus Seminar (Polebridge/Macmillan
Publishing Company, 1993)
This is the famous book that came from the “Jesus Seminar,” a gathering
of New Testament scholars who tried to come to agreement on which
New Testament sayings are definitely from Jesus. This book includes a
survey of the sayings of Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas.
 The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon by Lee M. McDonald
(Hendrickson, 1995)
This is one of the best, clearest, and most thorough presentations of the
whole issue of how the canon of the Bible (Old Testament and New
Testament) developed in history. McDonald has written a number of
works on this topic, but this is the best of the lot.
 The Gnostic Discoveries: The Impact of the Nag Hammadi Library by
Marvin Meyer (HarperCollins, 2005)
This is an interesting book about the Nag Hammadi library and early
Christian Gnosticism, but be aware that it’s not a collection of 
translations.
 The Gnostic Gospels by Elaine Pagels (Vintage, 1989)
Professor Pagels is one of the best known and most widely appreciated
scholars of Gnostic Christianity. Always provocative and interesting,
she’s justly noted for her scholarship on this subject, and in this book,
she pays particular attention to the role of female characters in Gnostic
texts.

Lost Books of the Bible For Dummies 

 The Gnostic Scriptures by Bentley Layton (Doubleday & Co., 1987)
This is probably the most popular translation of the Nag Hammadi 
(and other) Christian Gnostic writings. Professor Layton has worked
hard to make very difficult writings a bit easier to read and perhaps
understand. He also provides very helpful discussions and notes with
the translations.
 Holy Writings, Sacred Text: The Canon of Early Christianity by John Barton
(Westminster/John Knox, 1997)
This is a very interesting work that deals with some of the more difficult
questions about the formation of the early canons of the Bible. If you’re
fascinated with the process of determining the Bible contents, this book
is required reading!
 How the Bible Came to Be by John Barton (Westminster/John Knox, 1998)
Here, the Oxford scholar John Barton takes up the general question of
the emergence of the Bible in a straightforward and learned manner. We
highly recommend this resource.
 An Introduction to the New Testament Apocrypha by F. Lapham (T&T Clark/
Continuum, 2003)
This is a very interesting work that discusses the geography of the early
non-biblical materials and how their location may have influenced the
kind of writings from that area.
 Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew
by Bart D. Ehrman (Oxford University Press, 2003)
Bart Ehrman is one of the most important scholars working in the field
of non-canonical literature (having translated an entire edition of the
Apostolic Fathers), and his work is well worth a read!
 Lost Scriptures: Books That Did Not Make It Into The New Testament by
Bart D. Ehrman (Oxford University Press, 2003)
Again, Bart Ehrman is one of the best authorities in this field, and this
book is a collection of translations of excerpts from some of the writings
we discuss in this book. (A full collection, however, can be found in
Elliott and the older work by Rhodes, both of which appear earlier in
this list.)
 The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Volumes 1 and 2 edited by 
James H. Charlesworth (Doubleday & Co., 1985)
This is the standard translation of the Jewish and Old Testament 
writings — that is, writings dealing with Old Testament themes, even if
written by early Christians. Each translation, by many different scholars,
includes an excellent introduction summarizing what scholars think
about each writing.

Appendix: Resources for Those Who Are Really into This “Lost Books” Thing

 1 Enoch 1: A Commentary on the Book of 1 Enoch Chapters 1–36, 81–108
(Hermeneia: A Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible) by
George W.E. Nickelsburg (Fortress Press, 2001)
George Nickelsburg is one of the world’s authorities on Enoch literature,
and this is the first volume of his wonderfully detailed commentary on
the Book of Enoch (also known as 1 Enoch). If you’re curious about
Enoch, this resource is the place to start!
 Other Early Christian Gospels: A Critical Edition of the Surviving Greek
Manuscripts by Andrew E. Bernhard (T&T Clark/Continuum, 2006)
This is another excellent overview of the non-biblical materials dealing
with Jesus, especially for those interested in reading the Greek texts.
 The Nag Hammadi Library edited by James M. Robinson (Harper and
Row, 1988)
This is one of the main and the only comprehensive translations of the
Nag Hammadi materials in English. You’ll find good notes at the begin-
ning of each translated work.
 New Testament Apocrypha, Volumes 1 and 2 edited by Wilhelm
Schneemelcher (Westminster/John Knox Press, 1992)
This wonderful collection of two volumes of translations into English of
Christian non-canonical writings covers much of the same ground as
Elliott’s translation but also contains further scholarly notes. (We used
this work particularly for our chapter on non-canonical Pauline writings.)
 A Synopsis of the Apocryphal Nativity and Infancy Narratives by J. K.
Elliott (Brill, 2006)
In this wonderful work, Professor Elliott has arranged all the early
Infancy writings about Jesus into a “parallel,” which means you can read
and compare each of them as you go because he divides them into simi-
lar scenes and episodes. Typically brilliant work by Professor Elliott!
