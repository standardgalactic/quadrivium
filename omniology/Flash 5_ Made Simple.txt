Preface 
Macromedia Flash is the application that is used to create those 
animated interactive multimedia pages you see on the Web. 
Designers love to use it because it allows them to efficiently 
produce and deliver Flash movies with stunning effects. 
Virtually all modem web browsers can view Flash movies 
without needing any further software. This means that the same 
Flash movie can be viewed on any common web browser 
regardless of the operating system that is being used. 
Flash can do much more than animate sound and vision though. 
Actions can be added to elements of a Flash movie to make them 
respond intelligently to the user. Flash 5 builds on earlier 
versions to provide more creative actions than ever before. This 
means that imaginative interaction can now make Flash movies 
a magical user experience. 
This book is a beginner's guide to starting out with Flash 5 and 
assumes that the reader has no previous experience of working 
with vector graphics or animation programs. The Flash interface 
often provides several ways to perform a task but this book 
mostly concentrates on using the mouse pointer and gives the 
keyboard shortcuts for Flash on the Windows platform. 
You are shown by example how to use the tools in the Flash 
interface to create and manipulate graphics before learning how 
to animate them. You will discover how to create rollover 
buttons that interact with the user and how to add sound to your 
movies so they really come alive. Finally the book explains a 
number of ways to deliver your movie for viewing. 
After following the examples in this book you will be able to start 
creating your own exciting Flash movies.

The Macromedia Flash installer will have created icons which 
can be used to launch the Flash interface. 
A Flash interface displays these three major components: 
e 
The Flash toolbar which provides menu commands that 
can be used as an alternative to using graphic controls or 
keyboard shortcuts 
• 
The Flash toolbox which contains the creative tools 
• 
The Flash editor where graphics and text are drawn

Basic steps 
1 
Click the Start button. 
2 Move the pointer to 
Programs 
3 Click on the Flash 
menu option.

face ready for use. 

Tip 
Press [Ctrl +#] to 
disླྀlay ot hide a hack­
ground grid on the 
stage. 
The grid will not aཱུpear 
in the final mollie but is 
helཷful to align shaྲྀes. 
The Flash editor 
The editor window is where Flash images and animations are 
created. A new editor window can be opened from the Flash 
toolbar by selecting the File > New menu options. 
Each editor window has these three major components: 
• 
A layers panel to create and manipulate drawing layers 
• 
A timelinepanel that has graduated markings and controls 
that are used to create animations 
• 
A blank area that is called the 'stage' where all graphics are 
created in Flash. 

The Flash toolbox 
The toolbox contains all the tools needed to draw, paint and 
manipulate images in the stage area of the Flash editor. Select a 
tool by clicking on any of the icons in the tools panel. Separate 
panels contain icons to select the view of the stage, the colours 
to draw or paint and further options that can be applied.

Ovals and rectangle shapes can be easily drawn on the stage with 
the oval and rectangle tools. With a shape tool selected, just click 
on the stage and drag the mouse to see a preview of the shape 
appear. The size of the preview changes dynamically as the 
mouse is moved. Release the mouse button when the shape is the 
desired size and Flash will draw the final shape. The shape will 
have both an outline and a filled centre in the colours that are 
currently selected in the Colors panel on the toolbox.

Selecting elements 
Graphic shapes that are drawn on the Flash stage are made up 
of separate elements. A filled circle, for example, comprises a 
centre fill element and an outline stroke element. Elements can 
be manipulated to change their size, shape, colour or position. 
The element that is to be manipulated must first be selected by 
the arrow tool to identify itto the program. Flash adds a highlight 
pattern to the selected element to make it recognisable to the 
user. The highlight pattern disappears when the element is 
deselected.

Freehand lines can be drawn on the stage using the pencil tool 
in the Flash toolbox. Lines will be drawn in the style, colour and 
thickness of the current stroke. When the pencil tool is selected 
a button appears in the toolbox options panel that can be clicked 
to offer three drawing modes. Drawing on the stage in ink mode 
leaves all the usual jagged edges that appear in freehand draw­
ing. The appearance of these lines is greatly enhanced if the 
smooth mode is used instead to remove the imperfections.

The straighten mode option that is available when the pencil tool 
is selected provides an easy way to refine freehand lines with 
jagged edges into straight lines or regular arcs. Additionally this 
is an intelligent function that automatically evaluates the drawn 
line to see if it is close to being a rectangle or oval shape. If so, 
Flash will transform the freehand drawn line into a rectangle or 
oval of the same approximate dimensions and with the current 
stroke settings.

Changing lines 
The arrow tool that is used to select elements can also be used 
to modify lines. Placing the arrow tool at the end of a line causes 
the cursor to change and allows the end point of the line to be 
dragged to a new position. Similarly placing the cursor along a 
line's length enables the line to be dragged into a curve.

Drawing curves 
The pen tool draws by creating a series of points that are joined 
together to form a line. A simple click on the stage with the pen 
tool adds a point to the line series. A click and drag adds a point 
that has adjustable features called bezier handles which allow the 
line from a previous point to be curved.

Changing fills 
A shape that has been drawn freehand on the stage may have 
small gaps between lines so that the shape is not exactly joined. 
Flash can still fill this shape using the paint bucket gap options. 
These allow you to specify the size of permissible gap when 
attempting to apply a fill with the paint bucket tool. If the gap is 
too big the fill will not be applied. Often this can be overcome by 
zooming out to temporarily reduce the physical gap size.

Brushing colour 
The Flash brush tool provides a means to paint freehand strokes 
of colour on the stage. It is important to note that these brush 
strokes are purely fill elements and do not have any stroke 
component. The brush size and shape can be specified using the 
brush options which are displayed in the toolbox options panel 
when the brush tool is selected.

Adding text 
When the text tool has been selected in the toolbox just click a 
starting point on the stage then start typing to add some text. The 
text will appear on the stage in a single line text box that grows 
as the length of the text increases. This text box has a round 
handle at its top right hand corner that can be used to resize the 
box and so wrap the text contents to appear on multiple lines. 
The round handle then changes to a square handle to indicate 
that word wrap is turned on in that text box.

ʒ Adding a drop shadow effect is a popular way of making text 
E stand out by creating an illusion of depth. This is easily done in 
Flash by duplicating the text in a lighter shade and changing the 
duplicate's position to be slightly offset to the original.

reating a layer 
Imagine layers as transparent sheets stacked one on top of the 
other. You can draw on any of these layers so that the graphics 
can overlap without coming into direct contact. When Flash 
opens an editor window the stage contains a drawing area that 
is designated Layer 1 by default. Additional layers can be added 
above this default layer to add overlapping graphics.

Basic steps 
1 
Click the New button 
on the main toolbar or 
press [Ctrl + N] to 
open a new editor 
window. 
Or 
2 Use the existing layer 
i n  the current editor 
window. 
3 Add an example 
g raphic on this layer. 
4 Click the I nsert Layer 
button in the layers 
panel to create a new 
layer above the cur­
rent one - see its new 
label added i n  the 
layers panel. 
5 Add an overlapping 
g raphic example i n  
the new upper layer. 
0 The stage in the editor 
window now contains 
two layers with a 
g raphic on each. The 
graphics overlap 
visually but cannot 
i nteract because they 
are not in direct con­
tact with each other. 

Basic steps 
1 Create multiple layers 
in the editor with a 
graphic on each one. 
2 Double-click on the 
label of a layer that is 
to be renamed .  
3 Type a meaningful 
name onto the label -
the new name is set 
when you click on the 
stage or another item. 
4 Click all the other 
labels and type new 
names for them. 
5 Click on the label of a 
layer to be deleted.

Controlling layers 
The layers panel in the Flash editor is where all layer features are 
controlled. When working with a lot oflayers it is advisable, and 
more professional, to give each layer a meaningful name. 
Double-click any layer's label in the layers panel then type anew 
name to rename that layer. To delete any layer just click its label 
in the layers panel then click the trash button.

Hiding layers 
The layers panel can be used to toggle the visibility of all layers 
by clicking the eye icon. Individual layers can be hidden and 
revealed by clicking the dot on their label below the eye icon. 
Click to sho 
52 
Basic steps 
1 
Click on the eye icon 
in the layers panel to . 
hide all layers - the 
dots below the eye 
icon on each label 
change to crosses to 
signify that the layers 
are hidden. 
2 Click the eye icon 
when all layers are 
hidden to show them 
once more - the 
crosses on each label 
change back to dots 
to signify that the 
layers are revealed. 
3 Click the dot below 
the eye icon on a layer 
label to hide that layer 
- that dot changes to 
a cross to signify that 
the layer is hidden. 
4 Click the cross below 
the eye icon on a layer 
label to show that 
layer once more - the 
cross changes back to 
a dot to signify that 
the layer is revealed.

Or 
Click on the lock icon 
in the layers panel to 
lock all layers - the 
dots on each layer 
label below the lock 
icon change to sig nify 
that each layer is 
safely locked. 
Click on the outlines 
icon in the layers 
panel to show all 
graphics as outlines -
the fil led squares 
below the outlines 
icon change to empty 
squares to signify that 
each layer is only 
showing outlines. 
Click on the individual 
outlines icon on a ny 
layer label to display 
ful l  graphics again on 
that layer. 
Click on the individual 
lock icon on any layer 
label to unlock the 
g raphics on that layer. 
When working with several overlapping layers it is advisable to 
lock those layers containing finished graphics so that they 
cannot be accidentally altered. Click on the lock icon in the 
layers panel to lock all layers. To lock individual layers click on 
the dot below the lock icon on that layer's label. 
It is sometimes helpful for clarity to view the graphics as just 
outlines. Click on the outlines icon in the layers panel to change 
all layers to outlines. To view individual layers as outlines click 
on the square below the outlines icon on that layer's label.

Change the stacking order 
Using layers means that the position of graphics on the stage can 
be changed in three dimensions. As usual the position can be 
changed from left to right and from top to bottom by dragging 
the graphic with the arrow tool. Also the position can be 
changed from front to back by rearranging the stacking order of 
the layers. 
The labels in the layers panel follow the current stacking order. 
So the label at the bottom of the panel belongs to the bottom 
layer on the stage with higher layers shown above. To change the 
stacking order just drag a label to a new position and the layers 
will be rearranged accordingly. 
2 Drag the label 
3 Release the mouse 
54 
Basic steps 
1 
Click on the label of 
the layer to be moved. 
2 Hold down the mouse 
and drag the label to 
a new position in the 
stacking order. 
3 Release the mouse to 
complete the move. 
0 The stacking order of 
the layers is now 
rearranged so that 
graphics on higher 
layers wil l  overlap 
those on lower layers. 

Basic steps 
1 
Click on the dots 
under the eye icon to 
hide the upper layers. 
2 Drag the arrow tool to 
select the elements to 
be moved. 
3 Press [Ctri + G] to 
group the selected 
elements. 
4 Press [Ctri +X] to cut 
the selected group 
onto the clipboard. 
5 Click on the dots 
under the eye icon to 
show the upper layers. 
6 Click on the top layer 
label to make it the 
active layer. 
7 Press [Ctri +Shift+V] to 
paste the selected 
g roup from the clip-
board. 
0 The graphic elements 
that were selected a nd 
g rouped on the bot-
tom layer are now 
pasted onto the top 
layer at their original 
location on the stage. 
Moving between layers 
Graphics can be moved between layers using a cut'n'paste 
method to cut them from one layer then paste onto another layer. 
This is useful to promote a graphic to a higher level in the 
stacking order so changing the way that other graphics overlap.

Each Flash document is provided with a library which may be 
used to store components used in that movie. The library can 
store graphics, sounds, bitmaps, text and even entire animations 
such as rollover buttons (see page 1 14). 
The advantage of storing these assets in a library is that one or 
more copies of any item stored in the library can be easily added 
to a movie. This is very useful when creating animations where 
the same graphic needs to be appear several times. The term 
'symbol' is used to describe a graphic that has been stored in a 
library and each copy ofthe symbol is called an 'instance' .  
Contents of the document library are shown in the library 
window that can be opened by clicking on the Show Library 
button in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor window.

Importing raphics 
Flash graphics are stored as a series of shapes and fills. This type I 
l 
of graphic is called a vector graphic. Vector graphics are more I 
i 
efficient than bitmaps which need to store information about I 
lli 
every single pixel in the graphic. Also vector graphics can be I 
scaled up or down without loss of clarity, unlike bitmaps. 
I 
Flash can use vector graphics that have been created in other 
popular vector graphic applications such as Macromedia Free­
hand and Adobe Illustrator as well as Metafile (WMF) and 
Enhanced Metafile (EMF) formats. To select a vector file to 
import into a Flash movie, click Import on the tool bar's File 
menu or press the [Ctrl+R].

Importing bitmaps 
Flash can import bitmap graphics in the popular file formats of 
GIF, JPG, BMP and PN G. This allows you to use your favourite 
graphics application to create a non-vector graphic for use in 
Flash. If imported GIF or PNG graphics include any transparent 
areas, Flash will preserve that transparency in the graphic that is 
placed on the stage. To select a bitmap file to import into a Flash

The result of converting a bitmap to a vector graphic is not an 
exact duplication of the original graphic but an approximation of 
it with a set of vector shapes. Four settings in the Trace Bitmap 
dialog box control how accurately these shapes trace the colour 
areas in the original bitmap graphic. 
• 
Color Threshold is a range of 1 to 500 that specifies how 
similar adjacent colours will be grouped together. Higher 
settings make Flash less discerning and produce fewer 
final vector shapes, so reducing the file size. 
• 
Minimum Area is a range of 1 to 1 ,  000 that specifies how 
many pixels Flash should use when calculating the colour. 
• 
Curve Fit specifies how accurately Flash should draw the 
outline around the final vector shapes. 
• 
Comer Threshold specifies if Flash should draw sharp 
comers or more rounded comers.

Importing animations 
Flash can import animated GIF s into the movie in much the same 
way as importing a single graphic in the GIF file format. Flash 
recreates the individual frame images in the original animation 
and places them in the timeline panel as separate frames on the 
current layer. Each ofthe frames are also added to the library as 
separate bitmap symbols.

Importing a sequence of graphics 
Flash has an intelligent option to import a sequence of graphics 
to be used as an animation. If the files are within a single folder 
and have the same name with a different ending number, Flash 
recognises the sequence and offers to import them all together.

Flash allows an imported bitmap to be used as a fill pattern in 
place of a solid fill colour. This creates a repeating tiled pattern 
of the bitmap in the filled area and can be applied with any ofthe 
tools that create a fill - oval, rectangle, paintbrush and paint 
bucket tools. 
The bitmap first needs to be broken apart, using [Ctrl+B], then 
selected with the eyedropper tool. Once selected, the bitmap 
appears in the fill colour block in the toolbox Colors panel and 
can be painted onto the stage.

Modifying bitmap fills 
Bitmap fills can be repositioned, scaled, rotated and skewed 
using the Transform Fill modifier that is available in the toolbox 
options panel whenever the paint bucket tool is selected. With 
the Transform Fill modifier selected, just click on a bitmap fill on 
the stage to produce a set of handles that can be dragged to 
manipulate the tiles within that fill. The centre handle can be used 
to drag the tile to a new location and the outer handles used to 
change the tile shape. All other tiles within the fill will repeat 
these modifications throughout the pattern.

The Flash timeline 
Animation requires a number of images, that are each slightly 
different to one another, to be displayed in sequence. If they are 
shown fast enough the eye cannot tell that they are individual 
images, so the illusion of smooth motion is created. Each one of 
the images is called a 'frame' .  
Typical animations can have lots o f  frames but these can be 
broken down into 'keyframes' ,  which define a new movement, 
and 'in-between' frames, that just display incremental changes 
between one keyframe and the next. Animation studios would 
historically employ their best artists to create keyframes then use 
lower-paid ones to laboriously produce the in-between frames. 
Flash uses the same process to create animations but can 
automatically create the in-between frames for you. Each frame 
is shown in the Flash time line panel with keyframes denoted by 
a bullet point. When a Flash movie is played each of the frames 
in the time line will be displayed in succession at a specified rate. 
A red line indicates the current frame. To select a different frame 
just click on it in the timeline panel.

The time line panel can be detached from the editor window and 
the appearance of its frame scale can be customised using a 
special frame view menu. This menu is opened by clicking the 
button at the top right corner ofthe time line panel. Options allow 
the size of each frame segment to be increased and include a 
preview of the actual content of each keyframe. This is very 
useful to identify the content of each keyframe at a glance.

reatin 
es 
A blank keyframe can be added to the time line to provide a blank 
stage where a new image can be created in an animated se­
quence. All the frames between the new blank keyframe and the 
first keyframe automatically gain the image content of that first 
keyframe. The new keyframe is initially blank but will contain 
the new image that is created on the stage to form a new frame 
in the animation sequence. 
To insert a new blank keyframe first select a frame on the 
timeline then press [F7]. Alternatively press the right-hand 
mouse button and choose the Insert Blank Keyframe option 
from the context menu.

continue an animation sequence. To duplicate a keyframe use 
the Insert Keyframe option in the context menu or [F6]. 
83 

andlin frames 
The frames that appear between keyframes have a special 
relationship with the first keyframe because they each display its 
content. Additionally they provide an area in which to create 
intermediate tweened animation between the first keyframe and 
the next, as detailed in the next chapter. These in-between 
frames can be added to the time line with [F5] or by choosing the 
Insert Frame option from the time line's context menu.

change from a hand 
to a pointer. 
Click to select the 
required frame. 
The single in-between

Tip 
The appearance of the 
cursor in the timeline 
indicates the type of 
selection that can be 
made: 
An entire keyframe unit 
can be selected with the 
hand cursor. 
lndhtidual frames can 
be selected when the 
cursor appears as a 
pointer. 
The method of selecting frames in the time line will vary depend­
ing on the type of frame and whether you want to select just a 
single frame or multiple frames:

To select a single empty frame, or a single keyframe, or a 
single final in-between frame, just click on it.

To select a range of empty frames hold down [ Alt] while 
dragging across the frames. 
In-between frames and their associated preceding keyframe are 
treated as a single unit that can be selected by clicking on any of 
the in-between frames. To select an individual in-between frame 
hold down [Ctrl] then click on it.

context menu. Multiple frames can also be moved in this way by 
initially selecting a range of frames. Because Flash immediately 
replaces the contents of the current frame it is a good idea to 
always paste frames into empty frames or in-between frames. 
This prevents accidentally replacing the contents of a keyframe. 
Unwanted keyframes can be deleted separately when you are 
sure they are no longer required. 
If a keyframe is cut from the timeline, the next in-between frame 
will automatically become a keyframe with the same content as 
the cut keyframe.

Flash allows frames to be dragged around the timeline to 
reposition a single frame or multiple frames. Also copies of an 
existing frame, or frames, can be dragged to a new location. This 
is a faster method than using the context menu options. To drag 
a keyframe unit to a new location first click on one of its in­
between frames and hold down the mouse button. Move the 
cursor along the timeline to the new required location. The 
cursor hand changes to a clenched hand when dragging frames 
and a preview box shows where the frames will be positioned. 
When the mouse button is released the move is completed.

When you test a movie, using [Ctrl+Enter ] ,  Flash first saves the 
movie as a file with a .swf extension then plays that file in a test 
window. There are other ways to quickly preview the animation 
directly in the Flash editor without creating a swf file. The 
simplest preview method is to manually drag the play head back 
and forth in the area at the top of the time line. Alternatively Flash 
provides a Controller dialog box with VCR-style buttons that 
can be used to play the animation. The Controller dialog box is 
opened by selecting Window > Toolbars > Controller on the 
main Flash toolbar.

Onion skinning 
Flash provides a great feature that makes it easy to align frame 
content with that of surrounding frames by showing their 
content in dimmed form on the current stage. This is called the 
Onion Skin mode and is turned on by a button at the bottom of 
the timeline panel. There is also an Onion Skin Outlines mode 
button that allows the surrounding frame content to be shown 
only as outlines on the current stage. When either Onion Skin 
mode is selected, Onion Markers appear in the timeline over 
frames included in the Onion Skin view. The range of included 
frames can be adjusted using the Modify Onion Markers menu 
that is available from another button in the timeline panel. 
Choose the Onion 2 option to display 2 frames each side of the 
current frame. The Onion 5 option increases the range to 5 on 
each side and Onion All displays all the frames.

Frame rate 
Basic steps 
Frame rate is the speed at which movies display successive

Double-click the frame 
frames. This speed is expressed as the number of frames per 
second (fps) that are displayed. The frame rate needs to be fast 
enough to create the illusion of animation but not so fast that the 
images become blurred. A frame rate that is too slow must also 
be avoided as it would allow the viewer to discern the individual 
frame images. 
The standard frame rate for movie film is 24 frames per second. 
Internet animations however are best displayed at 12 frames per 
second so this is used as the default frame rate by Flash. A 
custom frame rate can be specified for an entire Flash movie by

Tip 
To precisely position a 
selected object use the 
directional arrow keys 
on the keyboard. 
Although the frame rate cannot be adjusted for individual parts 
of a movie the animation speed can be speeded up, or slowed 
down, by changing the number of frames in a sequence. Adding 
frames will slow the animation by taking longer to complete a 
particular movement. Extra frames could be simple in-between 
frames but the animation will be smoother if the added frames 
are keyframes showing the graphic at intermediate positions.

Take note 
The tweened frames are 
not actually new graphic 
frames but rather are 
mathematically created 
by Flash. This is far 
more efficient than 
making a mottie with 
lots of keyframes and 
reduces the file size of 
the finished movie.

The Motion Tween feature can be used to animate graphics in 
ways other than just changing their position on the stage. 
Tweening can automatically generate intermediate frames for 
changes to the size of a graphic. This can be used to grow or 
shrink a graphic in a Flash movie.

Tweening rotation 
Motion tweening can automatically generate intermediate frames 
for changes to the orientation of a graphic. This can be used to 
rotate a graphic or make a spinning graphic. As with other 
motion tweens, Flash calculates the difference between two 
keyframes to generate the images in the in-between frames. By 
default the direction of rotation will automatically be that which 
requires the shortest amount of rotation.

on the facing page in an anti-clockwise direction. The direction 
of rotation can be specified manually in the Frames dialog box. 
The total number of rotations can also be specified here. This can 
be used to create a graphic that spins a set number oftimes in a 
specified direction.

otion guide layers 
A motion guide layer is a special layer that only contains a path 
along which to animate a graphic in an associated normal layer. 
To create a motion guide layer click on the layer that is to be 
associated then click the Add Guide Layer icon. The pencil tool 
can now be used to draw the desired path in the motion guide 
layer. Once the centres of the graphic in the start and end 
keyframes are aligned with the guide the animation will travel 
along the prescribed path. 
3 Draw a path 
1 05 

Orienting to a path direction 
Animations that follow a path on a motion guide layer may seem 
to be a little unnatural if they maintain a fixed orientation. For 
instance, an aeroplane flying a loop-the-loop should at some 
point be upside down, and not maintain a horizontal position. 
We can make the graphic follow the path more naturally by 
ticking the Orient to path option in the Frame dialog box. It is 
also better to rotate the graphic in the first keyframe to face in 
the direction of the path so that the initial alignment is natural.

the first keyframe of 
the motion tween .

Tip 
Turn on the Onion Skin 
fiew as you adjust the 
Easing falue to see how 
the frames change. 
Animations that are created using tweening spread the motion 
evenly across the total number of in-between frames in that 
sequence. The speed of a tweened animation cannot therefore be 
changed by adjusting the number of frames in the sequence as we 
did with the frame-by-frame animation example on page 93. 
Instead tweened animation speeds can be varied by setting the 
Easing value in the Frame dialog box. This value is zero by 
default when the frame rate is constant. Changing this to a 
negative value makes the animation start slowly then accelerate. 
This is called Easing In. A positive value on the other hand 
produces an Easing Out effect where the animation starts 
quickly then decelerates.

Rollover buttons 
Buttons can be included in Flash to allow the user to interact 
directly with a movie. The visual appearance of an interactive 
button should change as the user places the cursor over the 
button, or clicks on the button, to provide feedback. This is 
called a rollover effect. In Flash a special type ofbutton symbol 
automatically provides four frames labelled Up, Over, Down 
and Hit in which slightly different button graphics can be stored 
to represent each stage of the rollover effect. 
Press [Ctrl + F

Basic steps 
1 
Press [Ctri + F8], or 
select New Symbol on 
the toolbar I nsert 
menu, to open the 
Symbol Properties 
dialog box. 
2 Type a name for the 
new button symbol. 
3 Click the Button option 
to specify that the new 
symbol wil l  be an 
interactive button. 
4 Click OK. 
0 Flash creates a new 
symbol in the library. 
0 The stage enters edit 
mode with frames 
shown on the timeline 
for each button state.

Basic steps 
1 
With the button sym­
bol in edit mode click 
on the first frame in 
the button's timeline. 
2 Create a graphic on 
the stage that wil l  
represent the button i n  
its natura l  Up state. 
3 Click the second 
frame then right-click 
and choose I nsert 
Keyframe from the 
context menu. 
4 Create a graphic to 
represent the button in 
its Over state. 
5 Click the third frame 
then right-click and 
click I nsert Keyframe. 
6 Create a graphic to 
represent the button in 
its Down state. 
0 The button now has 
an individual graphic 
associated with each 
of its rollover states. 
The natural Up state of a rollover button displays the graphic 
that is held in the first frame of the button symbol's timeline. 
When the user places the cursor over a button the Over state 
displays the graphic held in the second frame of its time line. A 
button's Down state displays the graphic in the third frame ofthe 
time line when the user clicks the button. Each of these graphics 
can be added to the appropriate time line frame when the button 
symbol is in edit mode on the stage. 
115 

Button Hit state 
The fourth and final frame in the time line of a button symbol is 
the Hit state that defines 
active area of the button. For a 
typical graphical button this will simply be a block covering the 
same size as the graphics in the Up, Over and Down states. If the 
button is more complex, such as a piece oftext or a line drawing, 
the block should cover the entire area of the button to avoid 
creating any unresponsive spots. The Hit frame's contents are 
never actually displayed so they need only be a single-colour 
block defining the active button area.

Button preview 
The rollover effects of a button are not usually enabled in 
normal editing mode. This allows the button to be repositioned 
on the stage without encountering the various button states. A 
button can, however, be previewed in normal editing mode by 
switching on a feature called Enable Simple Buttons. This is an 
option found on the tool bar's Control menu, or just press 
[Ctrl+Alt+B] .  Alternatively the rollover effects can be seen in 
Test Movie mode by pressing [Ctrl+Enter].

added to frames and objects, such as a button, using the Flash 
ActionScript scripting language. Learning ActionScript means 
learning a new language and is beyond the scope of this book. 
We can, however, get a taste of ActionScript by exploring how 
actions can be added to rollover buttons. A typical use for a 
button might be to relocate to another frame when it is clicked. 
Similarly, the new location might also have a button to return to 
the original location when the user clicks it.

Invisible buttons 
The only button frame that must have a graphic is the Hit frame 
that defines the active area of the button. Buttons that do not 
have graphics in the Up, Over and Down frames will be invisible 
in the movie. An invisible button can be used to make the entire 
movie frame clickable. This is useful to resume playback of a 
movie that pauses on a frame containing a lot of text.

Creating hot spots 
Invisible buttons can be used to create hot spots in the movie 
frame that will respond to the user's mouse movements. The 
graphic in the button's Hit frame does not need to correspond 
to any other graphic so can be made any shape and size to create 
a hot spot anywhere in the frame. Several hot spots could be 
added to a single existing graphic ifthey do not overlap. The hot 
spot can respond to a mouse click by adding content to its Down 
frame. The Over frame can create a pop-up effect when the 
user's mouse is placed over the hot spot.

Importing sounds 
Flash running on a Windows operating system can import sound 
files in W A V format and MP3 format for inclusion in a movie. 
These sound files are imported into Flash from the Import dialog 
box in just the same way as bitmaps or other artwork. The 
Import dialog box can be opened using the File > Import menu 
options or by pressing [Ctrl+R]. When a file is selected the sound 
is added as a new Symbol in that movie's Library.

A Flash movie can haཻte 
multiཛྷfe sound layers. 
Embedding sound 
As the number of components in a movie increases the time line 
becomes increasingly cluttered. Although not essential it is a 
good idea to create a separate layer for actions and another 
separate layer for sounds so they can each be easily identified. 
Sounds can be attached to any keyframe by dragging an instance 
ofthe sound symbol from the library in the same way that other 
symbol instances are added to the movie. When a running movie 
reaches a keyframe that contains a sound that sound will begin 
to play then continue to the end of the sound clip regardless of 
the progress of the ensuing frames.

The Sound dialog box 
Various sound properties can be controlled in the Sound dialog 
box that can be opened by choosing Window > Panels > Sound 
from the tool bar or by double-clicking on a frame in the time line. 
At the top of this dialog box is a drop-down list of all sounds in 
the movie and details of the current selection are displayed. The 
Sync property is set to Event by default to allow the sound to 
play through once without synchronization with other frames. 
The Effect field contains a drop-down menu of channel and fade 
effects. It is useful to match a sound effect with an animation. For 
instance you can match a graphic moving from left-to-rightwith 
a sound that fades from the left speaker to the right speaker.

Using Start sounds 
Sounds that play normally have a Sync property set to Event. 
This Sync value can be changed in the Sound dialog box to Start, 
Stop or Stream to specify how the sound should be played. The 
Start setting is useful in looping movies to prevent accidentally 
playing multiple instances of a sound. Normally the default 
Event setting allows multiple instances of a sound to play 
concurrently but the Start setting will not play a sound if that 
sound is already playing.

Tip 
Loop a musical sound 
clip to add an efficient 
backing soundtrack to 
a mollie. 
A sound can be played repeatedly by setting the Loop value in 
the Sound dialog box with the number of times that the sound 
should repeat. Both Event sounds and Stream sounds can be 
looped this way. Flash combines the loops into a single continu­
ous waveform. This means that a sound effect can be applied to 
the combined sound as if it were just a single sound. Any Sync 
setting will also be applied across all of the repeated sounds.

Exporting from Flash 
Flash can export a single frame or all the frames in a movie using 
the Export command options in the File menu. The currently 
selected frame can be exported using the Export Image option 
to a wide variety of formats including GIF, JPEG, BMP and 
Adobe Illustrator. The Export Movie option will export all 
frames in the movie as a sequence of sequentially numbered 
individual images in these formats. Additionally Export Movie 
can convert a Flash movie into a single animated GIF, a 
Windows A VI or a Quicktime MOV file.

Controlling dimensions 
The original dimensions and background colour of a movie can 
be specified in the Movie Properties dialog box. When publish­
ing for theW eb, the area allocated for the movie on the web page 
will normally match these Movie Properties dimensions. Cus­
tom dimensions for this area can be specified in the HTML tab 
of the Publish Settings dialog box. This alone will not change the 
displayed size of the movie unless the Scale setting is also 
changed to 'Exact fit' for the specified area dimensions. This 
could be used to stretch a half-banner to full banner size.
