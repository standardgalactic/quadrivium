About the Author
Family lifestyle expert Joe LoCicero’s obsession with cakes and instruction
began with the Flintstones-themed cake his mom served for his fifth birthday.
Before the cake was doled out, Joe explained to everyone the importance of
embellishing a cake with frosting and figures. He developed an immediate
interest in deconstructing and designing desserts, and by the time he was in
seventh grade, his carrot cakes had become such a hit that local organiza-
tions auctioned them off at fundraisers.
More recently, the Southern-bred LoCicero has spent the last 15 years in Los
Angeles working in the entertainment industry as a party planner, writer,
columnist, and marketing consultant. He also works wonders as a cake deco-
rator, accomplished home chef, creative instructor, and entertaining guru.
Having organized big-budget parties for network, studios, agents, and stars,
Joe founded Chartreuse Cake in 1999, which specializes in themed, fantasti-
cally crafted cakes for large gatherings such as birthday parties, bridal and
baby showers, signature events, and private screenings. His Red Velvet Cake
and its wide variety of decorations is his most requested. Chartreuse Cake
has also catered meals for independent films, and dessert buffets for celebri-
ties. LoCicero also continues to offer one-on-one home cooking instruction.
In 2004, Joe and his wife founded Practical Whimsy (www.practicalwhimsy.
com), a company that celebrates family style with products, recipes, party
tips, and of course ideas for cakes. Joe and his wife champion the importance
of family supper and celebrations and have given presentations on those topics
to corporations, organizations, and educational institutions including MTV,
Paramount, Viacom, Turner Broadcasting, Loyola Marymount University, and
Southern California’s Discover Conference.
Joe’s column on entertaining, “Practical Whimsy: Southern Hospitality,
Hollywood Style,” is a regular feature in Y’ALL: The Magazine of Southern
People, and he’s the author of a number of books, including The Complete
Idiot’s Guide to Clear Thinking and Streetwise Meeting and Event Planning.
Additionally, Joe is the Food Contributor for momready.com.
LoCicero has been featured in Cosmopolitan, Woman’s World, several daily
newspapers in the U.S. and Canada; radio outlets including Sirius’ Martha
Stewart Living Radio; and network affiliate news programs.
LoCicero lives in Los Angeles, where he cooks dinner every night for his wife,
Lori, and their two young children. They have cake as often as possible.


Dedication
To Dalton, whose love for cakes, zest for life, and ever-burgeoning outpouring
of new ideas provide a happy, constant source of inspiration.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I truly regard cake decorating as a way to celebrate the infinite number of
happy occasions that can bring friends, colleagues, relatives, and immediate
family together. In that spirit, I’m so thankful to my nieces and nephews —
Eli, Mary Elle, Samuel, Tucker, Savannah, Ethan, Paulina Jane, and Alex —
who take cake and celebrating very seriously and have fueled my passion for
cakes, served as excellent taste testers, and proved to be unending idea fac-
tories. And to my delightful daughter Garcy, who has already shown me that I
was, in fact, prepared to have a girl, particularly one who has such fabulous,
discriminating taste.
I’ve realized that people can be just as passionate about enjoying cake as I
can be about making and decorating them. Jill and Mark Illsley, Maureen
FitzPatrick and Doug Armstrong: Your unending support and encouragement,
your graciousness, and your ever-present humor humble me.
I’d also like to thank Kristy Wylie and Shari Kaufman, two champions of my
cakes who never missed the chance to express their sheer delight, spread the
word, and show me the importance of never making light of a talent you’ve
been given And I appreciate all my friends and colleagues at Paramount, Disney,
Turner Broadcasting, and Sony who heaped praise on myriad confections,
instilling more pride, happiness, and publicity than they’ll ever know.
To those who willingly enter the Practical Whimsy test kitchen and help us so
immeasurably — namely the incredibly talented Sarah Kent and Julie Jones.
Your assistance in so many areas was absolutely invaluable. You make us
smile and never let us down.
At Wiley, I so appreciate my Acquisitions Editor Stacy Kennedy’s passion for
this project and understanding of my vision; Project Editor Tim Gallan’s stead-
fast commitment and easygoing style; Copy Editor Elizabeth Rea’s cheer and
verve; and Pam Mitchell’s expert recipe testing.
In Jacky Sach, I am always happily amazed at what a dedicated advocate I
have. I’m so lucky to be in league with such a smart, savvy agent who never
wavers from helping me accomplish the ideals I strive for. And that sense of
humor: Don’t get me started!
I also want to point out my parents, Joe and Gloria, whose zeal for good food
and love of us all propelled us to believe that we can do anything. And finally,
to my favorite cake lover, my amazing Practical Whimsy coconspirator/wife
Lori, who let me have an actual chartreuse-colored cake for our wedding . . .
and had no idea what she was getting us into when she ordered me that
Martha by Mail cake decorating kit oh-so-long ago.

Introduction
I
often hear moms and dads, girlfriends and boyfriends, wives and husbands
say, “I really wanted to decorate a special cake for this birthday (or party,
or dinner, or . . . insert occasion here), but it just seemed too hard,” or “I
meant to come up with a cake, but I ran out of time,” or “I’d like to do that,
but I’m not that creative.” If you’re guilty of using these excuses or others like
them, banish them from your mind because an admirable desire to bake and
decorate a beautiful cake for someone (or some event) means that you already
have the perfect running start. Add some cake flour, confectioners’ sugar, a
few techniques, and a couple of easily attainable supplies and you’ll be pleas-
antly amazed at how easy and fun it can be to produce a delicious, lovely cake
that becomes the smashing centerpiece of a celebration.
From a very early age, I was enthralled with cakes as the four kids in my
family got to select whatever birthday cakes we wanted. I often requested a
sunshine orange cake with orange frosting; my sister’s favorite was strawberry
through and through; one brother favored milk chocolate cake, frosting, and
filling; and my other brother routinely asked for a choo-choo chocolate chip
ice cream cake with chocolate frosting. Eventually, we graduated to more
innovative tastes and accoutrements, like the coconut cake that hosted a big
top and circus on parade and the banana peanut butter cake that featured a
wild configuration of Flintstone toys. I also started to understand how cake
delighted grown-ups as much as (if not more than) it did kids, and as an adult
planning events and parties for networks, studios, and Fortune 500 companies,
I realized that celebrations and opportunities to enjoy cake are everywhere.
Particularly delicious, eye-catching cakes can put anyone in a festive mood
and make any event that much more memorable.
No doubt you have much to celebrate with friends, family members, and col-
leagues. And a cake is that winning component that makes everyone realize
that where they are, who they’re with, and what they’re doing is special.
Although you certainly may order the cake from a local bakery or supermar-
ket (and occasionally, you may have to), the taste, look, charm, and feelings
conveyed by a homemade decorated cake are simply unparalleled. Be it at a
birthday party, bridal shower, wedding reception, anniversary celebration,
graduation, holiday gathering, date night, awards banquet, retirement party,
bon voyage soirée, or dessert buffet, your own specially created cake is always
welcome.
For your cake decorating endeavors, you can draw inspiration from a variety
of sources: some common, some unique, some understandable, some unfath-
omable. Inspiration may come in the form of haute couture fashion design, a

vintage piece of china, a college football game, a cereal box, a state map, an
advertising relic from a certain decade . . . and of course the person or event
being honored.
About This Book
This book shares the basics and beyond necessary to bake, frost, fill, and
decorate a variety of cakes. Because I cover varying degrees of difficulty, 
this book truly is accessible to all. Each cake commands different skills for
all the activities that complete the cake’s look: mixing up batters, whipping
up frostings and fillings, modeling frosting roses or marzipan miniatures, get-
ting desired results from assorted icing tips, handling frosting-filled pastry
bags, and selecting the perfect embellishments to be eaten or just simply
marveled at. But ultimately, the beauty of cake decorating is that it can be
very simple and elegant or extraordinary and detailed.
You can use the tips, tools, guidelines, and instructions herein to create your
own designs, or you can rely on the proven recipes and directions I provide to
bake and decorate tested (and happily tasted) cakes for a variety of occasions
and celebrations. Regardless of your choice, you can use the information I pro-
vide on an assortment of techniques and a wide range of embellishments to
complete, accomplish, and perfect stunning creations.
I promise that, in no time at all, you’ll be creating, baking, and decorating your
very own cakes that will amaze, impress, and delight . . . and bring incalculable
rewards for your time and effort.
Conventions Used in This Book
Baking is one culinary art in which using precise ingredients and following a
recipe to a T are absolute musts. If you’re not the type to read a recipe before
diving in, here’s my gentle plea to change your ways for the better.
For optimal results, keep the following recipe conventions in mind as you
embark on each new cake project:
 Most of the cake recipes call for cake flour, which is a lighter, finer version
of all-purpose flour that makes cakes more tender.
 Confectioners’ sugar (also known as powdered sugar) is 10X.
 White granulated and brown sugars are cane sugars.
 Butter is unsalted. Do not substitute margarine or vegetable spread.
2
Cake Decorating For Dummies 

 Extracts (vanilla, almond, and so on) are pure (not imitation), unless
otherwise indicated.
 Salt is finely granulated table salt, not kosher or sea salt.
 Oil is all-vegetable. Avoid other kinds of oil (such as peanut), and 
definitely steer clear of any type of olive oil.
 If water is called for, use filtered water.
 Unless otherwise directed, mixing should be done with a stand mixer
rather than a hand mixer.
Occasional patches of text highlighted in gray are known as sidebars, and
they contain information that I think may come in handy or interest you.
Although I’m fond of the details doled out in sidebars, reading them isn’t
required for your understanding of the text or your ability to execute any
of the projects. (But if you do read the sidebars, you’ll have some great con-
versation starters to use at parties and an even deeper understanding of cake
trivia, origins, and such.)
Foolish Assumptions
Call me crazy, but in writing this book, I assumed a few things about you, the
reader:
 You love cake or are eager to impress with cake.
 You know your way around a baking aisle or have a friend to guide you.
Beyond that, anything goes: You may be ready to try cake decorating for the
first time; you may have done some cake decorating in the past but want to
expand your repertoire, ratchet up your skill level, add a few techniques; or
both. In any case, you don’t need to have any experience whipping up prize-
winning confections in order to get something from this book. You just need
an appetite for sweet success.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts that cover cake decorating from all angles,
from an overall look at its primary components to preparing layers and frost-
ings to be embellished in various ways, with a variety of techniques, for a
myriad of occasions and celebrations. The parts also cover serving in style,
taking shortcuts, and getting kids involved.

ing your pantry with the finest ingredients for the most delicious and most
impressive cakes.
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake
The chapters in this part delve into the details for determining how your
cake should look and embracing some easy artistic concepts with which to
design it. With design in hand, you prepare to make the cake from scratch
and set it up for the decorating process.
Part III: Topping, Filling, and
Embellishing Your Creations
With a luscious cake baked and waiting, this part tackles demystifying and
deconstructing the cake decorating process with foolproof recipes and
instructions for topping the cake with frostings and icings, spreading the
layers with complementary fillings, and embellishing the creation with the
perfect accoutrements, designs, and accompaniments.
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s
Special Occasions
Nothing says “celebrate” like a cake at a gathering, party, or event. Part IV
looks at some of the most popular times for cakes, and showcases raves-
winning, delicious creations with easy-to-follow directions. And, since most
parties build up to that moment when the cake will be served, these ideas
won’t let partygoers down. In addition to a comprehensive selection of
cakes you’ll love to make and decorate, you’ll also glean — in different 
chapters — tips on baking with kids, commanding popular shower
power moves, and dream up even more occasions for cakes.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Obviously, I love cake decorating and just can’t get enough of it. The endless
design possibilities, flavor combinations, vibrant colors, amazing tastes, and
happy cake eaters coalesce for a remarkably fulfilling experience.
If you’re just starting out, you may want to flip to Part I to find out about get-
ting the cake decorating tools and ingredients you need for the job as well as
map out space in which to work. Then you may want to segue into mastering
a few basic recipes and trying some simple designs.
If you already have some experience decorating cakes, you may want to head
to the chapters containing recipes for cakes and frostings and add those to
your repertoire. Or you may turn to Chapters 11 and 12 to pick up a new
embellishment technique or two, like working with different icing tips, 
modeling with marzipan, or crafting buttercream roses.
Part IV, the home of recipes and instructions to create specific cake designs,
is a great place to start if you have experience in decorating or if you have a
child’s birthday party, a cousin’s wedding, or another special occasion on the
horizon. The cakes in these chapters will cheerily light up a celebration and
cake eaters’ faces.
If someone you want to impress is coming over tonight and you don’t have
time to go through the whole process of cake decorating, skip directly to the
fast fixes in Chapter 19.
Cake decorating is a marvelous union of art, baking, your point of view, and
your knack for celebrating in style. I encourage you to relish every moment 
of the process, from concept to creation, because few pursuits can boast such
satisfying, vibrant, heady — and delicious — results.

veryone loves to see cake at a gathering, party, 
or event. This part puts you squarely — and 
delightedly — on the path to tapping into your well 
of creativity and swiftly building skills for designing,
baking, and decorating amazing cakes. You delve into 
setting up your very own cake station, collecting the
tools you need, and considering how to style a cake 
your way.

Acquiring the Skills and Creativity
In This Chapter
 Linking baking skills with your creativity and tastes
 Working through the cake process
 Becoming a cake designer
 Embracing all cake opportunities
C
ake decorating requires both skill and creativity . . . but you can do it
for every occasion that calls for a celebration! With an understanding
of some basic mechanics (and maybe a few secrets), you can create amazing,
memorable cakes that impress and delight partygoers, event attendees, and
families alike.
Truth be told, who needs an occasion to bake and decorate a cake? When
you get wrapped up in the sheer enjoyment of dreaming up a cake’s design,
mixing batters and making frostings, selecting the perfect accompaniments
and colors, and the tasty results that undoubtedly bring smiles aplenty, you
don’t need an occasion to create a delicious masterpiece.
If you peruse magazine pages or fancy bakery cases with cakes that you think
your work can’t possibly match up to, fear not! All you need is the instruction
in this book, the inspiration provided by your family, friends, and events . . . and
a love of cake!
Bridging Baking and Creativity
From a very young age, practically everyone loves to eat cake. (Do you have
pictures of yourself on your first birthday with cake smeared all over your
hands and face? I do.) For most people, the word “cake” conjures up images
of sweet times, fun gatherings, and memorable celebrations. 
On its own, a cake certainly can be beautiful and delicious. But a decorated
cake, particularly one with well-executed flavors and designs that’s stunning
in its own right and appropriate for the occasion, takes the event to another

level, delights all those in attendance, and — perhaps most important — makes
the celebrant or honoree feel even more special.
Chefs and bakers sometimes are referred to as culinary artists because, in
many ways, food influences expression and creativity like more conventional
art forms. There may be sweet ingredients you can’t wait to try, an imported
candy in the perfect color that inspires you to create a whole design around
it, or a restaurant dessert that you’re eager to recreate.
Cake decorating, as an art and activity, allows you to express yourself in so
many ways. You build upon an array of talents such as baking, cooking, pairing
flavors, thinking up and drawing designs, creating and assigning colors, mas-
tering tip techniques, and modeling embellishments. In addition to executing
the final cake design, you also infuse your personality and artistic expression
into how the cake is showcased and served.
And cake decorating can be as simple or complex as you like. You can transform
cake layers and sizes into a towering masterpiece, like a multitiered chocolate
cake castle with edible stone walls and gum paste flowers climbing multiple
stories, or a simple confection, like a double-layer round white cake with
raspberry filling and swirls of buttercream frosting on the outside. You can
elaborately script a message in chartreuse frosting or feature rows of different
colored shredded coconut. You can top it with pink roses or festoon it with
silver dragees. Experimenting with and practicing different techniques helps
you swiftly take on more delicate or demanding decorations.
Gathering the Tools and Ingredients
Cake decorating requires that you acquire — and know how to use — a variety
of tools and equipment. Some items are common enough that you’re likely to
have them on hand already, but others may require some Internet shopping
or visits to stores that specialize in cake decorating. If you don’t plan ahead
and keep yourself organized, all the things you need and use in cake baking
and decorating could take over your kitchen! Like many activities and hobbies,
cake decorating needs a home base. One organization item I recommend you
put together is a cake decorating kit that includes tips, flower nails, pastry
bags, and other items. Although some apparatuses and goods, such as odd-
sized baking pans and decorating turntables, may not fit in a kit, they do fit
in with your endeavors, so you need to have them on hand as well. Further,
cake baking and decorating relies on an assortment of typical ingredients,
some of which all aspiring and practicing bakers are familiar with. Other
ingredients, like food coloring gels and embellishments, are quite unique
to cake decorating.
10
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Cake decorating utilizes a space that doesn’t have to be massive but does
have to be efficiently appropriated and used. Trust me: You absolutely 
don’t need a five-star kitchen to work on your masterpieces. Keen organization
skills help you make the most out of your existing counter space for sufficient
elbowroom.
Picking Up the Skills
The art of cake decorating breaks down into several skill sets, which you
eventually combine (effortlessly, of course) to create your cakes. From the
first hint of a desire to decorate cakes, it’s important to remember that cake
decorating is a process; you get to mix things up and get your hands dirty
with decorations, but you also need to spend time thinking about your cake
and planning your design and execution.
Baking the foundations
The foundation for your work — that is, moist and delicious cakes — means
that you have to tackle baking with verve. And baking — believe it or not —
has rules you should follow for ultimate success. For instance, to get the
most out of your baking efforts, use key ingredients, line your pans, and take
care to mix the perfect batters.
When your cakes come out of the oven, you must prepare them . . . much 
like an artist readies a canvas. From leveling to torting to crumb-coating, you
depend on a host of strategies to create the optimal surface for decorating.
In Part II of this book, I provide some master cake recipes, such as Delicious
Yellow Cake, A Most Excellent White Cake, and Cocoa Chocolate Cake. When
you get these cakes under your belt, you can experiment with them in a vari-
ety of ways to create new and different flavors.
Spreading on the layers
Before segueing to decorate the outside of the cake with designs and embellish-
ments, you may want to consider adding a filling other than frosting between
the cake’s layers. Fruit curd, whipped cream, and nut spreads can all comple-
ment the cake and frosting flavors while adding another flavor dimension.
After baking and filling your cake, you head into the favorite cake-covering
domain of many: frosting . . . gobs and gobs of frosting. Buttercream, chocolate
11
Chapter 1: Acquiring the Skills and Creativity

ganache, and cream cheese (all of which I give you recipes for in Part III),
are delicious standards. Of course, even though frostings are fun to mix and
master, other cake coverings, including icing, fondant, and glaze, have their
own distinct advantages, too.
Decorating with tips and embellishments
Oftentimes, when people dream of a tasty and perfectly decorated cake, they
can’t help but imagine frosting lined up in rosettes or stars, in ridges around
a cake’s circumference, spelling out names and greetings, or even forming
complete pictures. These decorations are all made possible thanks to icing
tips, of which there are many different kinds to use for cake decorating. You
can almost certainly replicate in frosting any frill, design, or picture you have
in mind thanks to the tips that you guide to outline and fill in designs. Because
there are so many different tips available to you, and because the designs you
create using them can range from simple to highly complex, Part III covers tips
from all angles: the staggering array of available tips, the amazing effects they
can produce, and how you can pick up tip skills with some guidance, instruc-
tion, and a little practice.
Icing tips unleash a veritable juggernaut of choices and effects, while embell-
ishments also enhance cake designs. Embellishments are edible and inedible,
common and uncommon, accoutrements, trimmings, frills, and figures. They
range from fresh flowers you pick up or order from a nursery to candies you
find on a grocery store aisle. An inedible embellishment may be a wedding
cake topper made out of fine bone china or a car made out of pressed tin. Or
you may choose to apply a few more techniques to craft embellishments out
of frosting, as in roses or hyacinths; out of marzipan, as in miniature, realistic
versions of fruits and vegetables; or out of gum paste, as in flowers.
Setting up, striking down
Your cake no doubt will be a stunning creation in its own right, but you should
keep in mind how it will be presented just before it’s served. You never want
your amazing work of art just to be plopped down on a table next to a garbage
can or in a dark corner surrounded by the wires of a nearby coffee pot! Set up
your cake for success by placing it properly on a sturdy, decorated cake board
and taking care with transportation, and showcase and serve your cake in a
venue that does it — and cake eaters — justice.
After the lights dim on the big event, you (hopefully) won’t have any leftovers
because your cake will have been such a hit. But if you do find yourself with
remaining cake, don’t let it go to waste! Carefully storing, refrigerating, and
freezing both just-baked cake layers and frosted finished cakes guarantees
that your cake always tastes as good as its first outing.
12
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Infusing Your Own Taste
After you master some basic recipes and techniques, a good deal of the fun 
of cake decorating lies in bringing your own tastes, talents, preferences, and
personality to the proceedings. For your creation, you’re part architect and
part fashion designer . . . and the best part is that you actually get to eat your
work of art.
When you’re wearing the architect hat, you figure out your cake’s structure
and size and how the layers and embellishments will hold up. And much
like a fashion designer working on apparel, you get to decide your own look, 
texture, and overall appearance using frostings, icings, and embellishments
instead of fabrics. Draw upon your own preferences and palette while taking
into account the celebration and the honoree being feted with cake.
For the most impressively decorated cake, you have to start with a plan, so
hunker down and map out what your cake will look like. With only a vague
image in mind, you’re on the road to disaster if you take a stab at decorating
willy-nilly with an icing bag filled with an arbitrarily colored frosting. Some
people want to race right on to picking up that icing spatula and getting that
frosting on the cake, but they’re really missing out. Part of cake decorating’s
charm and allure definitely plays into laying out how your particular confec-
tion will look and how you plan to achieve it and then doing your best to
follow that path or — if need be — improvising to get your desired result.
In putting your own creative spin on a cake, you need to consider several
points regarding the event, party, or occasion, and the honoree (or honorees).
To make sure that you devise the right cake plan for the occasion, your cake
research entails finding out about the celebrant’s likes and dislikes, the theme
of the party, the colors involved, the feel of the location, and so on.
Your plan may involve deftly following a pattern, adapting a design from a
template, or coming up with your own design from scratch. Whatever design
route you decide to take, you’ll be choosing colors, considering shapes and
sizes, plotting out the design in the space available, and factoring in curves,
lines, and outlines.
Calling All Occasions
With cake decorating, you quickly realize that opportunities for a wonderfully
decorated cake are limitless. Consider making cakes for these special events:
 Kids’ birthday parties
 Grown-up dinner parties
 Baby showers
13
Chapter 1: Acquiring the Skills and Creativity

 Bridal showers
 Weddings
 Anniversaries
 Graduations
 Housewarmings
And these holidays:
 Valentine’s Day
 Easter
 The Fourth of July
 Halloween
 Thanksgiving
 Christmas
 New Year’s Eve
Part IV of this book arms you with recipes and instructions for creating cakes
for a variety of special occasions and a variety of honorees. From whimsical
birthday cakes for boys, girls, or both, to themed creations that prove that
cakes aren’t just kids’ stuff, baby and bridal shower cakes, to wedding and
anniversary confections, and cakes for many holidays in between, your 
memorable creations add to the events and stand the test of time. Some of
the designs I provide feature elements particular to the occasion, such as 
fondant, frosting flowers, or kid-friendly decorations. And each chapter in
this part reviews considerations you should bear in mind when making
cakes for kids (both boys and girls), men, and women.
Recognizing Possibilities
Your cake decorating ventures (and adventures) may be so entertaining,
thrilling, and fulfilling that you decide to switch careers or make cake deco-
rating a part-time job. Taking cake decorating to the next level isn’t as simple
as making cakes and selling them to friends and family. When starting a cake
decorating business, you have goals to consider, a workspace to locate,
equipment to get your hands on, and marketing strategies to implement.
So whether you decide to take it up as a career or simply enjoy it as a hobby,
cake decorating will provide you — and countless others — constant opportu-
nities to celebrate life’s occasions . . . and eat cake!

Assembling Your Cake 
Decorating Kit
In This Chapter
 Gathering the tools for cake decorating
 Storing your supplies
I
n a sense, the magic of cake decorating begins with your very own cake
decorating kit that’s tailored to your needs, wants, skills, and aspirations.
Depending on the level of decorating you’re taking on, this kit could be a
durable box, a plastic case, or an entire cupboard; it includes all the goods,
gadgets, and tools you need to turn out decorated cakes. You may already
have some of the items for your kit, but others may be new and mysterious.
So this chapter helps with the intimidation factor by explaining the uses and
various functions of your kit items along with where you can get them in the
first place.
The items included in this chapter cover quite an extensive range of equipment
that assists in baking, leveling, frosting, filling, and decorating. Don’t feel like you
have to run out and buy everything listed here all at once or like you can’t give
cake decorating a go without having every single item on hand. Throughout the
chapter, I point out the items that are absolutely essential, and you can choose
to add other items to your cake decorating kit as you become increasingly profi-
cient in some areas or veer off in new decorating directions.
Targeting Tips and Flower Nails
Closely associated with cake decorating and integral to your endeavors, tips,
couplers, and flower nails are the tools that will need a special place in your
kit because they will help you create and craft a host of fabulous designs. While
just the terms may initially seem intimidating, fear not: They won’t be only a

trusty addition to your kit, you’ll enjoy them as some of your most valuable
resources.
Starting with essential icing tips
When it comes to stocking your cake decorating kit, you have dozens of icing
tips to choose from, but you’re likely to rely on only a handful of tips over
and over again in your cake decorating escapades. Because of that, you can
start off with a simple collection of some standard sizes.
Before I get into specific tip sizes, I recommend that you work with nickel-plated
tips, which should be washed by hand. Plastic tips are widely available — and
usually you can run them through a dishwasher for easy cleanup — but they
aren’t as reliable as metal tips in design or execution.
Based on my experience, a collection of round tips in a variety of sizes will serve
you well; when you’re just getting started, you’ll repeatedly call on round tips #1
through #10. These tips are appropriate for a range of techniques that are both
simple and stunning and include piping dots and strings, scripting, forming
block letters, and writing messages. You should also gather the following
more-specialized tips:
 Star tips, such as #16, #18, #21, and #32
 Basket weave tip, such as #48
 Leaf tips, such as #67 and #352
 Petal tips, such as #102, #103, #104, and #125
A variety of tips are shown in Figure 2-1.
Rather than purchase individual tips, many people opt for tip sets, which
include many of these essential tips; sets range from student sets that have
less than 10 tips to professional ones that boast more than 50 tips. (I was
pretty ambitious from the get-go, and my first kit had more than 30 tips,
which I continue to supplement.) Standard tips run less than $1 each, so if
you start out with a small tip set, you certainly can keep adding on at a rela-
tively slim cost.
When you purchase your tips, make sure to buy a tip cleaning brush, too. A
very worthy and very inexpensive investment, the tip cleaning brush helps
you get deep into pointed tips to remove any frosting residue that running
water (or a wadded-up, damp paper towel) just can’t get!
Regardless of whether you buy individual icing tips or a set, take the oppor-
tunity as soon as possible to test every tip, practicing with each one to see
its particular design and to start thinking about how you can integrate each
one into your cake decorating. As you play around, remember that some tips
16
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

can give more than one effect: As you pipe, turn the tips over on different
sides to maximize the frosting effects.
For a more-detailed discussion of all kinds of tips and their forms and functions,
check out Chapter 11.
Adding couplers
To fit a tip onto a pastry bag, you need a coupler, which consists of two parts:
 A round plastic cone that you fit inside the pastry bag
 A coupler ring that you screw over the tip on the outside of the bag
I like having lots of couplers handy (see Figure 2-2) because they allow me to
ready several different colored frostings all at once. Also, couplers are useful
when your cake design involves different piping designs in the same color
frosting: Instead of preparing a pastry bag for each tip you need to use, you
just outfit one bag of frosting with a coupler and then change the tips.
For some reason, cake decorating kits sold as a complete lot rarely include more
than one or two couplers. Invest in at least a few more; they’re inexpensive, and
having them on hand is guaranteed to save you time.
Fixating on flower nails
A flower nail is a spindly tool with a large, circular flat head; as you can see in
Figure 2-3, it looks very much like its name suggests. However, the head of a
flower nail is much larger than that of any nail you’d find in a hardware store.
Flower nails come in different sizes, but a #7 is a good standard size for your
decorating kit.
Figure 2-1:
Icing tips.
17
Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

The head of a flower nail is big enough to craft a single frosting rose bloom on,
but even if rose-making doesn’t interest you, you also can use it for creating
other types of flowers.

Picking Out Paper Goods
and Pastry Bags
A few disposable goods are completely indispensable in your cake decorating
efforts. The following items don’t necessarily fit into a cake decorating caddy,
but they should be on hand in your pantry:
 Parchment paper: You use parchment paper to line your baking pans,
particularly big ones and pans that you’re filling with tender batters. In
addition, parchment paper also provides a good practice surface to test
out designs beforehand with your frosting-filled pastry bag. Purchase
parchment paper either by the roll or in packs of 12-x-16-inch sheets.
 Wax paper: If you decide to frost and decorate a cake on the platter or
tray that you plan to serve it from, placing wax paper strips under the
edge of the cake before you decorate and then removing them after you’re
done keeps your serving platter, plate, or board free of any smudges or
frosting drips that could detract from a neat presentation.
Wax paper also provides a handy assist when creating multiple frosting
flowers and storing flowers until you’re ready to apply them to your cake.
Attach a square to a flower nail with a dab of frosting, and pipe a flower
directly onto the wax paper. Then remove the wax paper square from the
nail, attach a clean square, and pipe the next flower.
 Plastic tumblers: Clear, plastic tumblers are great for holding frosting-filled
pastry bags upright or for holding empty bags upright while you fill them
with frosting.
 Paper bowls: Mixing frosting and colors in paper bowls means easy
cleanup.
 Plastic spoons: Mixing frosting and colors with plastic spoons is a great
way to cut down on your cleanup time.
 Cupcake liners: Keep cupcake liners in stock, and be on the lookout
for liners that are pretty but out of the ordinary. For instance, a pattern
sold around the holidays actually may be suitable for year-round use.
 Disposable pastry bags: You have more than one option for pastry bags,
but I almost always veer toward disposable ones. I find that it’s just plain
easier to toss a frosting bag away after you’re done using it rather than
try to clean out the excess frosting and then dry it. If you prefer, you can
use reusable decorating bags — just be sure to keep them clean and dry
so that they’re always ready for your next cake decorating adventure.
 Cardboard rounds and squares: Typically, you set each layer of a cake
on a cardboard round or square (depending on the shape of the layer) to
provide stability to the cake, to keep it from cracking or breaking as you
move it around, and to make it easier to move during the decoration and
boarding process.

Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

Sizing Up Pan Shapes
Baking pans are a necessity. Invest in chef-quality ones, which, although
expensive, more than make up for the cost with durability and results.
Good pans produce cake layers that are higher and more level. Chef-quality
pans have perpendicular sides, which give your cake straight and clean lines
(rather than slanted ones) for a much more professional look.
As far as pan shapes are concerned, you can get a lot of decorating mileage
out of just a few basics.
Rectangular and square
Rectangular cake pans produce some of the most common cake shapes, like
quarter-sheet, half-sheet, and sheet cakes. Typically, these sizes are for cakes
for crowds, big and small. While this terminology is consistent among bakers,
I’ve found that the sizes for these cakes actually varies. As a general guideline
though, a quarter-sheet cake is 9 x 13, a half-sheet is 12 x 18, and a full-sheet
is 18 x 24. Therefore, a full-sheet could be “put together” by having the more
regular 12 x 18 size on hand. The rectangular cake pans you should have are
the 9-x-13-inch and the 12-x-18-inch. In addition, for variety, I recommend
picking up a 10-inch square pan as well.
When you have only one pan of a certain dimension, you double your baking
time when you need two layers. Consider getting two pans in the 9-x-13-inch
and 10-inch sizes. The 12-x-18-inch pan is big enough and deep enough that
it’s unlikely that you’ll stack two such generous layers.
Round and oval
Round cakes are perhaps the most ubiquitous cake shape. Because smaller
rounds are perfect for cakes for small dinner parties and family gatherings,
invest in two 8-inch or 9-inch rounds. If you occasionally take on bigger 
parties and like a little variety, consider having 10-inch, 12-inch, and 14-inch
rounds on hand, too. I’m also a fan of the 6-inch round pan; a decorated cake
that size makes a simple thank-you to someone, and it also provides a nice
accent to a bigger cake.
Oval cakes have been in vogue lately, so if you’re into the modern look, you
may want to have this type of pan as well.
20
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Cupcake tins
If you opt to go the cupcake route on a cake recipe, you’re likely to need two
cupcake tins, each one with 12 wells. A nonstick surface is only necessary if
you don’t plan to use cupcake liners.
Bundt
Some bakers like Bundt pans because they can just pour in the batter and 
not worry about leveling and layering. I developed a fondness for these pans
when I was mastering the Tunnel of Fudge recipe from scratch.
Traditional Bundt pans allow you to create interesting shapes with cake
(such as the doll dress cake in Chapter 13 and the jack-o’-lantern cake in
Chapter 17) with a minimal amount of work. I recommend that you have
at least one Bundt pan in your equipment cupboard. Nonstick varieties are
available but not necessary. And while you can certainly invest in a cavalcade
of different shapes and sizes of Bundt pans, I suggest you at least have one
traditional-shaped one.
Specialty shapes
In recent years, you may have noticed that cooking stores and even chain
stores are flooded with an assortment of cake pans in all sorts of shapes.
These specialty pans aren’t necessary for general cake decorating, but if a
particular shape catches your attention and triggers your creativity, go for it!
Unfortunately, cakes don’t always turn out like the pictures on pan packaging,
so if you plan to use a specialty shape pan for a special occasion, do a trial
run and bake a cake in it ahead of time to avoid any mishaps with your final
product. Also, many specialty pans turn out cakes with raised or indented
features, and baking a test cake gives you the opportunity to figure out the
best way to spotlight the intricate design. For example, you may want to
sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar or coat it with a thin icing that settles
into the design’s fine lines.
Boarding Cakes
Every cake needs a home. Cake plates and cake pedestals are standard for
round cakes. However, for larger cakes — such as quarter-sheet, half-sheet,
and full-sheet cakes, my favorite vehicle is a 16-x-22-inch hardwood pastry
21
Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

board that’s 3⁄4-inch thick. Other options for cake boards include foam core,
cardboard, plywood, and Masonite.
If you work with only one cake at a time, you need only one pastry board, which
you can easily dress up to go with the cake or the occasion. For example, you
can cover the board with wrapping paper and then heavy cellophane wrap to
keep it clean. Or you can dress the board with an assortment of decorative foils
that are available online or at national craft stores. (I cover cake board deco-
rating in Chapter 7.)
Don’t cover your cake board in aluminum foil. Sure, it does the job, but it 
isn’t the most attractive covering. You have so many options for coverings,
and the shiny, wrinkly presence of plain aluminum foil will definitely detract
from your delicious, beautiful cake.
Gathering General Utensils
You may already have some of the items in this category of goods in your
kitchen. In the cake decorating process, they’re the workhorses that both 
fortify and enhance your endeavors.
Ruler
A ruler is a must when measuring out designs and transferring the width,
height, and length of a sketch to the actual cake. You may also need it to
figure out the lengths of frosting strings, garlands, swags, and borders.
Cookie, fondant, and gum paste cutters
Cookie cutters provide you with ready-made outlines and stencils for filling in
with sanding sugars and nonpareils. (Plus, you can incorporate different-shaped
cookies into your cake design.) Gum paste cutters are specifically sized for
shaping flowers, and fondant cutters come in a nice range of graduated sizes
for layering or creating other designs with rolled fondant. Most of these dif-
ferent kinds of cutters come in either metal or plastic; I find that metal cuts
more easily, but plastic’s easier to clean . . . so in the end, it’s your pick!
Cooling racks
After that cake comes out of the oven, it has to cool somewhere, and the criss-
cross wirework of cooling racks provides optimal ventilation. To accommodate
22
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

a variety of cake shapes and sizes, have two sizes of racks on hand — a 10-x-
16-inch and a 141⁄2-x-20-inch. Also, because you have to invert cake layers when
they come out of the oven, it’s a good idea to have two cooling racks of each
size for flipping the cake over.
Buy stainless steel or nickel-plated cooling racks so that you don’t have to
contend with rust.
Pastry brush
A pastry brush, preferably one with silicone bristles, is a great tool for 
sweeping the crumbs from your just-baked cake. Getting the crumbs off
your cake surface and sides makes your crumb coat more effective (because
there are fewer crumbs to cover up), which keeps your frosting as crumb-free
as possible.
Use a dedicated pastry brush for your cake decorating work. Although
pastry brushes clean up well in a dishwasher, it’s better not to worry about
what scents or residue may remain on the brush from that barbecue chicken
you basted or the roasted vegetables you brushed with olive oil.
Rubber spatulas
No kitchen utensil works quite as effectively for scraping every last drop
of cake batter or frosting out of a mixing bowl as a flexible rubber spatula.
Rubber spatulas also are perfect for gently folding whipped egg whites or
whipped cream into a recipe. Stock up on different shapes and sizes.
Large spatula
I recommend also getting a stainless-steel spatula (or turner) that will make
moving a cake layer — from cooling rack to cake board, for example — easier.
The wood-handled spatulas I use for this are 14-inches long, with the stainless
steel “blade” or “lifter” portion measuring 10-inches long by 3-inches wide.
Thermometers
To make cake baking and decorating easier and more accurate, you need a
candy thermometer and an oven thermometer. A candy thermometer is about
23
Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

12 inches long and has a clip on the back side so that it can hang down into
your pot for an accurate temperature reading. Look for a stainless steel vari-
ety that’s dishwasher-safe. A candy thermometer is necessary when preparing
cooked frostings and fillings, such as caramel and lemon curd, in which the
mixture has to reach a certain temperature for the desired flavor and consis-
tency. Some recipes call for a mixture to be heated to the thread or soft-ball
stages, both of which are clearly marked on a candy thermometer.
An oven thermometer helps you keep your oven’s temperature in check. You
may have set the oven to 350 degrees F, but it may not actually be that hot —
or it could be hotter. An independent gauge, the oven thermometer clips to
an oven rack so that you can easily read the oven’s actual temperature. If the
reading doesn’t match up with your oven setting, then you can make the nec-
essary adjustments to get the temperature you need.
Cake tester
You can certainly rely on toothpicks or bamboo skewers to test a cake for
doneness, but I suggest having something more permanent. This skinny,
stainless steel rod usually measures between 5 and 7 inches.
Rolling pins
A rolling pin — which can be wooden, marble, or metal — is a must for work-
ing with rolled fondant. Depending on how often you work with marzipan, gum
paste, and fondant, you may also consider purchasing smaller, nonstick rolling
pins designed specifically for working with those confections.
Toothpicks, bamboo skewers, and dowels
This trio of wooden tools works wonders for your cake decorating in a variety
of capacities. Their most obvious duties include:
 Toothpicks: Handy for mixing colors into marzipan or fondant and for
testing for doneness (if you don’t have a metal cake tester)
 Bamboo skewers: The perfect tools for sketching out a cake’s design on
a frosted cake
 Dowels: Provide internal support to tiered cakes
24
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Tooling Around with Decorating Specifics
The tools covered in this section help you refine your cake design and allow
for a more polished and professional look.
Decorating comb
This type of comb has no place on a vanity! Drawing it over a layer of frosting
creates evenly spaced rows, lines, and V-shaped patterns across the top of a
cake or along its sides. Cake decorating combs come in varying lengths. Some
have a straight side that produces no texture, and others may have teeth on
both sides. Different widths distinguish the teeth on each side of a dual-sided
comb (see Figure 2-4).
Turntable
The turntable can be absolutely invaluable in decorating. Invest in one and
you’ll wonder how you ever decorated without it! With this device, your cake
sits on a platform that rests on a rotating wheel of sorts. You can stay in one
position while you spin your cake around to frost and decorate it on all sides.
With a turntable, you also get an even visual perspective of all sides of the cake.
Plastic turntables with pedestals are fairly inexpensive. You can also find
turntables that have pedestals that angle up, which make decorating even
easier (especially when you’re working on a time-consuming and involved
design like a basket weave). If you want to step up from plastic, sturdier
turntables are available with cast-iron stands and aluminum tops.

Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

Leveling assists
A level cake that provides a flat surface for designs is a cake decorator’s dream.
And achieving a level cake is easier than you think with this trio of tools.
Levelers
Cake levelers allow you to slice off a cake’s dome or crown so that you’re left
with a completely level, flat surface. Typically, this apparatus consists of a
sharp blade or wire stretched between two short steel poles with a handle on
the top. You adjust the blade to the height of your cake top, set the poles on
your work surface, and slide the blade across the cake, taking off just enough
to make the entire layer level. Levelers come in both large and small varieties
to accommodate various sizes of cakes.
Particularly sturdy and sharp levelers can also torte layers, allowing you to
split a cake into two or three layers that you then fill.
Bake even strips
These insulated strips fit snugly around a cake pan to insure moist, even cake
layers and prevent cracked or domed tops. You soak the strips and then place
them around the circumference of the pan before baking. Essentially, the strips
retard baking on the outer edges for more evenness throughout.
Heating core
Recommended for cakes that are 10 inches or larger in diameter, a heating
core distributes heat so that larger cakes bake more evenly. This hollow
stainless steel element is about 31⁄2 inches in height and 4 inches in diameter.
You place it in the center of the cake pan and then fill the pan and core with
batter. When the cake is done baking, you remove the core, pop out the piece
of cake that’s inside it, and use that piece to plug the hole in the cake layer.
After you frost the cake, the repaired hole is unnoticeable.
Icing spatulas
Icing spatulas are essential for coating your cakes. These spatulas are quite
different from the ones you may use to flip burgers or fried eggs: They look
more like knives with rounded blades and usually feature wood or molded
plastic handles.
In the icing spatula arena, I prefer offset or angle-blade spatulas. I find that
they’re more flexible and give my cakes a smoother finish. I recommend that
you get two sizes of the offset kind: a 4-inch one and a 9-inch one. In addition,
you’ll also get a lot of use out of a straight 8-inch spatula, which is particularly
good for crumb coating. A variety of spatulas is shown in Figure 2-5.
26

Figure 2-5:

spatulas.
27
Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

Bench scraper
Usually about 6 inches long, a bench scraper is an ideal tool for smoothing
out the frosting on a cake’s sides or circumference. The scraper typically has
a molded plastic handle on one side that allows for easy guiding of the other
straight-edged side.
Fondant smoother
This tool, which is somewhat shorter than a bench scraper, helps smooth out
the draping of rolled fondant for an even finish. You gently glide the fondant
smoother across the surface of the cake to take out any wrinkles or bumps.
Modeling tools
Usually made from plastic, a modeling tool set is ideal for shaping creations
out of gum paste and fondant. The typical set includes a ball tool to cup and
smooth petals, a veining tool for lining up realistic-looking veins in leaves,
and a shell tool to emboss patterns.
A color wheel
Color plays an important part in cake decorating for your frosting base, the
colors you use to tint frosting, and how you pair colors for different designs.
A color wheel, which you can find at art and craft stores, helps you see how
certain colors contrast with each other for a dynamic effect or blend together
for a complementary tone. You may not even realize some of the colors avail-
able to you until you take a few spins on the color wheel and see the limitless
possibilities that await you and your cake!
A color wheel has rotating pieces of cardboard stacked on top of each other
that let you see gradations of color and how a color mixes with another one
to create a third hue (see Figure 2-6). Most color wheels also give you a brief
primer on color definitions such as primary, secondary, and tertiary as well
as tints, tones, and shades.
Chapter 5 offers tips for introducing and using color in your design, and
Chapter 7 covers the process of mixing colors for your cake decorating 
work.

Keeping All Your Tools Together
After you collect all your cake decorating kit items, where do you put them?
I recommend a portable caddy that will easily store and, if necessary, transport
your most vital items. Craft and cake decorating supply stores carry storage
boxes that are made specifically for cake decorating, but you can also be
inventive. You may find just what you need at a sporting goods store, hard-
ware store, or craft store. I’ve seen people repurpose or christen anew a tool
kit, art caddy, sewing kit, and even a fishing tackle box for their cake decorat-
ing headquarters.
A caddy can’t hold your baking pans or cooling racks, but it should have
a place for your tips, spatulas, pastry bags, decorating comb, and so on.
Whatever box or caddy you go with needs to be augmented with tip holders,
which are molded plastic cones that keep your icing tips clean, upright, and
easy to identify when decorating. If you buy a tip set, you can just hang on to
the box it comes in. Or you can purchase a tip storage case, which usually is
pretty inexpensive.
Figure 2-6:

utes of a

29
Chapter 2: Assembling Your Cake Decorating Kit

You may also want room inside the box or caddy to store your coloring
gels (which I cover along with other related cake foodstuffs in Chapter 4).
If you put your gels in the same caddy as your other tools, make sure that
you sequester them appropriately, like in a sealed plastic bag, so that if one
accidentally breaks open, it doesn’t ooze all over everything else. No matter
how into color you are, you probably aren’t too keen on having your tips,
icing bags, ruler, and sundry other supplies stained a bright shade of leaf
green or neon pink.
Finding the Goods
With the vast array of retail outlets available on the Internet, it’s easier than
ever to get your cake decorating kit up and running . . . and staying the course.
Before you pull out your wallet, I recommend wandering through a cake deco-
rating store or the cake decorating aisles at a national craft chain store to famil-
iarize yourself with what’s out there. Look at the inventory, touch (but don’t
open!) the supplies, read the packaging, and ask questions of a knowledgeable
salesperson. Just don’t buy everything you see all at once!
Decorate a few cakes with just the core supplies. Then take another look at
the additional offerings to see if any have potential to earn a place in your
cake decorating kit.
In addition to the cake decorating supply stores and national craft store
chains, cooking stores often devote at least some space to cake decorating.
Big box stores also may have a few supplies in their kitchen and housewares
sections. For a complete listing of my recommendations for where to buy cake
supplies, check out Chapter 21.

Chapter 3
Planning Your Workspace
In This Chapter
 Organizing your kitchen to facilitate baking and decorating
 Checking out necessary appliances and equipment
 Getting your oven in shape
 Dealing with refrigeration and freezing
T
his chapter focuses on laying out the most productive area for designing,
baking, frosting, filling, and decorating your creation. I show you how best
to use the space you have, and I describe the equipment you need to maximize
your cake decorating potential. With the proper set-up and equipment, your
cake decorating will flourish (rather than be derailed) . . . no matter what
your current kitchen looks like.
My initial cake decorating endeavors growing up were in the crushed confines
of a kitchen that, decked in the harvest gold hues of the 1970s, was the con-
stantly humming hub of a very busy household. When I first started turning
out cakes professionally, I worked in a tiny bungalow kitchen with uncoop-
erative tile counters and a slanted floor that tested both my patience and
the oven’s ability to bake even cake layers. So I can say from experience that,
however small, old, or peculiar your kitchen may be, you can make a cake
decorating space that works for you!
Organizing Your Kitchen: 
What Goes Where
You may have visions of lengthy, polished, stainless steel counters, several
deep sinks, and a bounty of double ovens, but you really don’t need a million
dollar dream kitchen to accomplish all your cake baking and decorating.
What you do need is to keenly analyze your particular workspace and adapt
it for your adventure. Besides delineating the area where the actual cake dec-
orating will occur (see the next section for that information), you’ll need to
figure out the best place for appliances — large and small — for access and

efficiency. You also need to determine the kind of counter space that will
work for you and adopt some tidy habits for a smooth-running endeavor.
The must-haves in a cake-friendly kitchen are the kitchen components that
do figure into your entire cake venture. They include the following:
 Refrigerator for chilling layers, frostings until they’re ready to tint and in
between uses, and your finished cake
 Oven for baking
 Stovetop for cooking frostings and fillings
 Mixer for preparing batters, frostings, and fillings
 Freezer for freezing layers (optional)
 Microwave for melting and softening
 Food processor for chopping nuts, chocolate, embellishments
 Spice or coffee grinder for preparing ingredients that should be finely
powdered
Creating a decorating zone
Survey your kitchen to determine where you may set up shop to decorate.
Fortunately, because decorating largely takes place after baking, you can get
all your baking ingredients and equipment such as cooling racks out of the
way before bringing in frosting, coloring gels, piping bags, and embellishments.
Because you can’t just work anywhere you set down a cake, keep in mind the
room you’ll need to decorate and the access you’ll need to your tools and
supplies, including your tinted frostings and embellishments, appliances
such as a mixer or spice grinder, and equipment such as a sink.
If you have a cake board, a turntable, or cake cardboard rounds, lay them
out in the workspace to get a real sense of the room each item takes up. If
you don’t have those accessories, lay out your baking pans to get a rough
idea of space allotment. If you don’t have enough room in one part of your
kitchen to work with your decorating equipment, keep moving around until
you find the right-sized space.
Also get a sense of the accessibility of the tools you call on in decorating your
cakes. You don’t always use all these utensils and decorating assists on every
project, but it’s helpful to get an idea of the space they take up and the space
you need to use them. These include (but aren’t limited to)
 Cups, glasses, or clear tumblers to hold frosting bags upright
 Bowls in which to mix coloring gels into frosting
 A tray of tips
32
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

 Icing spatulas
 Decorating combs
The space you decide on for decorating doesn’t have to be exclusively for
decorating; it just has to serve you during the actual course of decorating. So
if you have to shuffle around or remove counter staples (such as a toaster or
coffee maker), you can put them back after you’re done.
If possible, don’t set up your decorating space where you may repeatedly bang
your head into an upper cabinet as you work, and the burners of a stove don’t
qualify as a working counter space.
Promoting accessibility and efficiency
Much is written about the kitchen triangle, the workspace pathway between
the refrigerator, sink, and oven, but I don’t worry so much about that for cake
baking and decorating. More important is making sure that all the ingredients
for the task are lined up, that all the appliances and apparatuses are in work-
ing order, and that all the accoutrements are collected, stacked, and close at
hand.
Nothing can stifle (and possibly stop) the cake baking and decorating process
like a missing ingredient, a burned-out mixer, or an oven that doesn’t reach
the desired temperature. If you spot potential problems and troubleshoot
from the outset, you’re in for a much smoother operation.
Purchase a couple of clear plastic containers (with lids) in which you can 
collect only the tools, accessories, and nonperishable embellishments that
you plan to use for a particular cake. If you don’t have the space to lay out
everything you need, the containers provide a handy resource to pull from
so that you aren’t interrupting the cake process to sift through lots of utensils
and foodstuffs to find what you need.
Checking out the counter space
In terms of the counter space itself, you really need a smooth, level surface
on which to work.
Countertops made of Corian, stainless steel, granite, or Caesarstone are
ideal for rolling out fondant or marzipan on because they’re seamless.
However, if you have tile countertops, for example, you don’t need to
remodel your kitchen to decorate a cake. You can roll out materials on a
large cutting board or durable piece of heavy plastic, or you can purchase
even bigger cutting boards — made of stainless steel, for example — on
which to do your decorating. Several cake equipment retailers, such as
33
Chapter 3: Planning Your Workspace

www.kitchensource.com and www.frigodesign.com, sell these types
of cutting boards online. If you get one and things are still rocky, lay damp
kitchen towels underneath the large cutting board when you’re working to
anchor the board and offer you a stable surface for decorating.
Giving yourself a little elbow room
Regardless of whether you’re in a commercial space, an expansive kitchen, 
or one that could pass for a cooking closet, get rid of the clutter. Baking and
decorating a large cake is made more difficult than it actually is when you’re
squeezed for room.
Interestingly enough, more space doesn’t necessarily mean more organization;
even when working out of a commercial or commercial-grade kitchen with
long gleaming countertops, you still have to stay on top of keeping the area
clean and constantly putting things away. So as you finish each task, put away
all the tools involved. Don’t sabotage yourself!
To aid your progress and process further, begin your decorating with an
empty dishwasher or sink, and clean as you go along. Also have a full roll
of paper towels and a clean stack of kitchen towels at the ready to tackle
inevitable spills and messes quickly.
Hauling Out the Heavier Equipment
In beating batters, making frostings, incorporating ingredients, and fashioning
embellishments, you must rely on an assortment of small appliances to effi-
ciently and effectively get the job done.
Kitchen mixers
I’m very passionate about my particular mixer. I started with a guaranteed
refurbished one from a kitchen outlet store that I still have (and that works
perfectly) even though the volume of cakes I produce necessitated getting a
professional-grade one.
When it comes to choosing a kitchen mixer, you have many options and man-
ufacturers available to you. To narrow the field, I recommend that you first
visit manufacturer Web sites to gets specs and terminology for the models
you’re interested in so that you can ask educated questions, understand the
answers, and conduct effective follow-up. Then check the Web for feedback
on certain models and visit a store that lets you operate mixers to see how
they are in action.
34
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Don’t choose a model because you’re into the color, it matches your kitchen,
or it’s on sale. I’ve had to use mixers that were beautiful to look at but didn’t
get the job done well at all. Make sure that you fully investigate a mixer’s
functionality and comparison shop before you make a decision, particularly 
if you’re thinking about making a substantial investment. I’ve found that, in
the case of stand mixers, you get what you pay for! It’s not worth buying a
cheap mixer over and over again if one $250 model can last for decades (and
many more expensive models certainly do).
I vastly prefer a stand mixer to a hand-held one. Although a handheld mixer is
good for small, quick jobs or to have around as a backup, the recipes you mix
for cake decorating projects really require a powerful stand mixer, preferably
one that has at least a five-quart capacity with a 325-watt motor.
For best results when making frostings, batters, and fillings, your mixer
should come with both a balloon whisk and paddle attachments.
Food processors and grinders
Both full-size and mini food processors are exceptionally handy in chopping
ingredients, such as nuts or dried fruits, or pulsing small quantities of fresh
fruits, needed for some batters, frostings, and fillings. Here again, take the
time to fully investigate the models out there, and find the one that best
suits your needs.
Grinders — either spice or coffee — also are useful for pulverizing 
substances — such as coffee crystals — into a fine powder that’s easy to
incorporate into a batter or frosting. You should designate an inexpensive
coffee grinder just for nuts and spices so that your nuts don’t taste like coffee
and your coffee doesn’t taste like nuts.
Pasta makers
This equipment recommendation may come as a surprise, but depending on
how much work you do with fondant or gum paste, you may want to invest in
a pasta maker.
Although not an absolute necessity for your kitchen, a pasta maker is very
useful for rolling out fondant to make bows, ribbons, and strips. It’s also a
timesaver for flattening pieces of gum paste for parts of flowers.
Ideally, you can borrow a pasta maker or work with someone who already
has one to determine if it’s a piece you think is a must-have. Some kitchen
mixers come with pasta maker attachments, too; if yours does, try it out
before you decide whether or not to buy a freestanding pasta maker.

Chapter 3: Planning Your Workspace

Firing Up an Accurate Oven
Whether you have a double oven or tiny range, your cake depends on a
good heating environment. You may be surprised to know that there are 
actually two kinds of ovens available for baking. Knowing about each kind
will assist you in turning out the best cakes. Further, cake decorators also
revel in the speed and convenience a microwave oven can provide for a host
of related duties. 
Conventional vs. convection ovens
Conventional ovens heat from below. At the bottom of the oven chamber is
an electric heat source that uses air (heated by gas or electricity) to cook
the food (or bake the cake). Conventional is the most common type of oven
used in today’s kitchens. As a result, baking instructions in recipes generally
assume that this is the type of oven the reader has.
Some ovens simply don’t have the capacity for large pans, so if you’re work-
ing with a size or shape of pan for the first time, put the empty pan into your
empty, cool oven to make sure it fits. 
Most ovens are 27-inches or 30-inches. But, if you have the money to spend and
the space to put it, I’d go with a 36-inch oven. While certainly not absolutely
necessary for the home baker, the accommodation for multiple cookie sheets
and large cakes — and the time you save in baking multiple layers all at once —
is worth the investment.
And if you’re currently in the market for an oven, do yourself a favor: Take
your baking sheet and cake pans down to the appliance store and get a 
first-hand look and feel for how everything fits.
Advanced bakers tend to prefer convection ovens for their dependability. In
convection ovens, an embedded fan circulates hot air around the baking pan
for faster and more even baking. What’s more, convection ovens don’t have
the hot spots or cool spots that may plague conventional ovens. Generally,
convection ovens should be set at a lower temperature than a conventional
oven. Commonly used in commercial operations, convection ovens have 
definitely gained in popularity in home use despite their higher cost.
In either case, be familiar with your oven’s idiosyncrasies: if it runs hot or
cold pertaining to temperature, or if you need to check before suggested
“done” times because your oven’s generally a few minutes off.
36
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Perfecting temperatures
A good cake depends on a heating environment that you can measure accu-
rately. With some ovens, the temperature you set doesn’t match the actual
temperature inside the oven; if you aren’t aware of the discrepancy, you’re in
for some frustration. When the temperature is off, baking times are woefully
unpredictable, and you’re left with an underbaked cake soup or an overcooked
cake brick — neither of which is the moist and delicious creation you had in
mind.
Invest in an oven thermometer to monitor the temperature inside your oven.
Too often, cake problems can be traced to the fact that the oven just isn’t
the temperature you think it is. If you’re aware of the fact that your oven is
too hot or too cold, you can lower or raise the temperature to make up the
difference. However, to make sure that your temperature problems aren’t a
symptom of a bigger problem or continue to worsen, I suggest calling a pro-
fessional to inspect your oven.
Before you turn on the oven, make sure that the racks are in the position you
need them to be to bake your cake. Further, after you place your cake in the
oven to bake, don’t open and close the door excessively. Checking for done-
ness near the end of the baking time is fine, but up until then, pop the oven
light on and use the window to check on your cake. Each time you open the
oven door, the temperature drops — as much as 100 degrees in some models!
The microwave has its place, too
Although not normally the oven you use for actual baking, a microwave is a
supreme help when it comes to melting chocolate, heating cream and milk,
and softening butter. As you probably know, microwave ovens vary widely
(and wildly) in terms of cubic feet, wattage, and settings. If you’re new to
using it in cake decorating assistance, give yourself time (and at least a
few tries) to get the results you want. 
Refrigerating and Freezing
Before you even begin to pull out ingredients to mix your batter, assess your
refrigerator space. Ask yourself:
 Do I have enough room for the cake’s layers?
 Do I need room to accommodate fillings or frostings before they’re
applied to the cake?
 Do I have enough room for the finished cake?
37
Chapter 3: Planning Your Workspace

If necessary, clear out some space and rearrange moveable shelves to accom-
modate what you expect to refrigerate. Remember that you don’t have to fit
the layers, fillings, and finished cake in there all at once. However, making the
necessary arrangements beforehand saves you frustration and reduces the
chance that you’ll have to watch a whipped cream filling melt while tossing
out a dozen leftovers.
Personally, I recommend a “French door bottom freezer” refrigerator. This
type has dual, same-sized refrigerator doors, and a pull-out freezer drawer
below the doors. In this style — unlike a typical side-by-side — you’re able
to have shelving that’s the width of the refrigerator, and you don’t sacrifice
depth because the freezer compartment (which also is the width of the refrig-
erator) is directly below the refrigerator unit. A 20 cubic feet model is fine,
but if you have the space and many cakes in your future, by all means check
out the 25 cubic feet possibilities.
The freezer may not be an appliance that you expect to use much in cake baking
and decorating, but I recommend that you put it to good use by mixing up an
extra batch of cake batter when you’re making a cake, bake up both cakes, and
freeze the extra layers. In so doing, you’ll want to make sure that the layers
can be positioned flatly; you don’t want to be standing them up on end. While
they can be stored in a freezer that’s part of a side-by-side refrigerator (depend-
ing on how much else is in your freezer), I recommend a freezer compartment
that affords your cake layers the entire width of the refrigerator.
Cake layers wrapped in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil keep for 30 days.
You may hear that you can keep cake frozen longer, but I don’t recommend it. In
addition, I also advise against freezing frostings or fillings. To defrost cake, pull
the layers out of the freezer and keep them wrapped until they’re completely
thawed.

Stocking Your Pantry
In This Chapter
 Picking the best of the basics
 Introducing coloring and flavoring choices
 Gathering essential embellishments
T
o make, bake, and decorate stunning cakes, you must start with the finest,
freshest ingredients. The best-looking cakes should taste delicious, too.
To ensure that you don’t let your dessert-loving audience down, use the
utmost care in understanding and selecting all the ingredients you need.
In this chapter, I help you evaluate all those baking essentials that work together
to create your sweet culinary masterpiece. You find out which ones you should
plan on keeping on hand so that baking and decorating a cake is a more imme-
diate proposition. Armed with the information in this chapter, you’ll see that
assembling a cake’s components doesn’t have to be overwhelming or intimi-
dating at all.
The Lowdown on Baking Staples
Whatever cake you decide to tackle, you’re almost guaranteed to need the fol-
lowing elementary yet essential ingredients: flour, sugar, eggs, and a fat, such
as butter or oil. In addition, you’ll call on a host of other foodstuffs to make
sure your cake rises, is moist, tastes flavorful, and has a delicate crumb.
Because you require these ingredients in your cake making (and some go
into frostings and fillings, as well), it’s a good idea to keep them stocked in
your pantry.
Some baking ingredients have longer shelf lives than others; this section
includes guidelines for storage and freshness. Familiarize yourself with
your ingredients by smelling them, tasting them (if appropriate), and
knowing their normal compositions, aromas, and appearances. You’ll be
more primed to spot any offending ingredient that’s not worthy of your 
confection.

Cake flour and all-purpose flour
All-purpose flour is generally used for a range of baked goods and foods.
However, as far as cakes are concerned, I prefer to use cake flour. Most of
the recipes in this book (and often, for cakes in general) call for cake flour.
It’s more finely textured than all-purpose and has less gluten in it, which
means that it produces a more delicate, tender cake.
If a recipe lists cake flour as an ingredient, do your best to follow it; you’ll 
definitely notice a positive difference in your cakes. However, if your recipe
calls for cake flour and you have only all-purpose flour, simply omit 2 table-
spoons from each cup of cake flour called for in the recipe. Conversely, if
you’re substituting cake flour for all-purpose flour, add 2 tablespoons for
each cup of all-purpose flour called for in the recipe.
In the baking aisle of your grocery store you may come across self-rising flour,
which has baking powder already mixed in. Steer away from this type of flour
for the sake of simplicity and the ability to control your ingredients. By using
all-purpose or cake flour instead of self-rising, you can add baking powder
according to your recipe’s specifications and follow the recipe more accurately.
When you get your flour home, empty the box or wrapper it comes in into 
a clear plastic or glass container with an airtight lid. If you have both all-
purpose flour and cake flour, keep them straight by labeling the outside of
the containers.
Even though flour keeps for months in airtight containers, take note of the
expiration dates on the original packaging and mark them on your flour 
containers. Stale flour is no friend to a cake!
Sugars
Cake recipes often call for granulated white sugar, which is the most popular
staple for sweetening baked goods. During baking, white sugar also lends that
nice golden color to white and yellow cakes. Occasionally, recipes call for
brown sugar; they usually specify whether you should use light (or golden)
brown or dark brown sugar. Light brown sugar imparts a smoky molasses
flavor, whereas dark brown sugar carries a stronger caramel taste.
Frostings often rely on confectioners’ sugar. Being a fine powder, confectioners’
sugar dissolves well so that your frostings and fillings don’t have a grainy
taste. This sugar is also an essential ingredient in fondant and gum paste.
Store all types of sugar in airtight containers. Even though they’re fairly
easy to tell apart, you should label the containers to avoid any missteps.
40
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Butters, oils, and shortening
Fats bring richness to your cakes. Most of the cake and frosting recipes in
this book call for butter, and by that I mean unsalted sweet butter. The butter
you buy should be in a carton stamped with a “Use by” date, that you should
definitely honor.
In baking cakes and making frostings, don’t use margarine or spreads of any
kind. The fat content of these products is lower than that of butter, so they
don’t yield the same texture. And worse, the taste just isn’t the same.
In terms of oil, you should stock up on all-vegetable oil for baking. You’re
probably aware of several other kinds of oil that are available — such as 
safflower, olive, and even grapeseed — but you should stick with vegetable
oil for cake baking. In addition to oil, you use shortening, available in both
tubs and sticks, for both frostings and greasing your baking pans.
Some brands of shortening come in a butter flavor variety, but stick with the
regular, unflavored version. The butter flavor interferes with the intended
flavor of your cake.
Oil and shortening don’t have indefinite shelf lives. Pay attention to expiration
dates; even if the product hasn’t officially expired, if a tub or bar of shortening
or a bottle of oil smells rancid, don’t use it! I’m often asked, “How do you know
if oil or shortening has gone bad?” Believe me, it’s a no-brainer; the smell of a
rancid fat is one you’d never associate with something edible.
Eggs and egg whites
Fresh eggs are key to your cake turning out perfectly. Be sure to check the
sell-by date stamped on the egg carton before you buy them, and store them
in the carton (rather than in a tray that may be part of your refrigerator) to
keep them as fresh as possible.
When a recipe calls for egg whites (think royal icing) and doesn’t include a
step for cooking them, buy a carton of pasteurized egg whites rather than
separating whites from raw eggs. When you use pasteurized egg whites, you
don’t have to heed warnings about food-borne illnesses to pregnant women,
the elderly, or young children, all of whom shouldn’t eat raw eggs. Pasteurized
egg whites generally need to be used within a few days of opening the carton.
Baking powder, baking soda, and cornstarch
Both baking powder and baking soda are leavening agents that work with
other ingredients in your cake to make it rise. You can keep them in the 
41
Chapter 4: Stocking Your Pantry

containers they came in, but make sure to keep them only until their expiration
dates. After a time, baking powder and baking soda lose their potency, making
them worthless to your cake batter.
Recipes for glazes and fruit fillings often call for cornstarch, a thickening
agent. Keep it in the original container, and use it by the expiration date for
best results.
Chocolate
Here’s a topic that gets almost everyone excited, and depending on your
household’s cravings, it may be hard to keep stocked in your pantry . . . but
do try! In addition to cocoa (see the next section), chocolate is a key ingredi-
ent in many cakes — including chocolate, marble, fudge brownie, and white
chocolate — and frostings, including ganache.
For baking, you can use chocolate chips (milk chocolate, semisweet, and
white) and baking squares (semisweet and bittersweet). The chips are typi-
cally sold in 12-ounce packages; the squares are divided into 1-ounce por-
tions, typically eight to a box. Store chocolate in a cool, dry place but not in
the refrigerator.
Grocery stores in larger cities and upscale chains usually carry a variety
of better or higher-end chocolates, but it comes down to taste preference:
Some prefer chocolate with a high percentage of cacao, whereas others are
happy with the taste of a common candy bar. Regardless, when purchasing
chocolate for cake baking and decorating, check the ingredients: For best
results, cocoa butter should be the fat listed, and you don’t want to use a prod-
uct full of such nonchocolate ingredients as palm kernel or cottonseed oil.
If a recipe calls for you to chunk or grate chocolate, don’t use a food processor,
which will just produce a mess. For chocolate chunks, place the chocolate
squares or bar on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to chop it. Or if
the chocolate is wrapped up, skip any mess by hitting it several times against
the cutting board to break up the bar. For grated chocolate, chill it and then
use the fine side of a box grater or a handheld microplane grater to finely
shred it.
Spices and seasonings
You should have an array of spices and seasonings at the ready to either
heighten an existing flavor or incorporate a new or complementary one. 
Keep the following ingredients in your pantry:
42
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

 Cinnamon, ground
 Cocoa 
 Espresso powder
 Ground cloves
 Ground ginger
 Ground nutmeg
 Salt
Spices can be expensive, so you may be tempted to buy them in bulk at a
warehouse store. But unless you plan to bake many cakes regularly with the
same spices, stick with smaller quantities. Dry spices lose their potency after
time, and some can even go rancid, so you don’t want them sitting in your
cupboard for years on end. Keep track of the purchase dates of your spices
by labeling the bottles, jars, cans, or tubs with permanent marker.
Opening the Dairy Case
Recipes for both cakes and frostings call for dairy products galore. In each
case, be mindful of expiration or sell-by dates. Pull fresh, perishable dairy
goods out of a cold case in your grocery store, and, of course, if you notice
a foul odor, curdling, or mold, get rid of the product even if the stamped date
says it should be fresh!
Fresh milk
You may need whole milk for your cake batter or heavy cream for a chocolate
ganache. Some cake batters rely on the smooth tang of buttermilk, and some
fillings need a splash of half-and-half.
I generally recommend steering clear of reduced-fat, lowfat, or fat-free milk
when baking or making frosting. Particularly if you substitute a fat-free prod-
uct for a full-fat one, the taste and overall result is disappointing. However,
reduced-fat buttermilk is fine if that’s all you can get your hands on.
Canned milk
Evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk are thicker and richer than
regular milk due to their manufacturing processes that remove water. Also,
sugar is added to produce sweetened condensed milk. Both kinds of canned
milk are delightful additions to frostings and fillings.
43
Chapter 4: Stocking Your Pantry

You can determine the shelf life of canned milk by checking out the expiration
date printed on the top, bottom, or wrapper of the can.
Other dairy products
Depending on the recipe, you may use such other dairy products as cream
cheese, sour cream, or yogurt. In all cases, stick with full-fat versions (unless
a low-fat recipe calls for otherwise). Particularly in the case of cream cheese,
don’t substitute reduced-fat Neufchatel; it tastes fine but doesn’t hold up
volume-wise to cream cheese’s fluffiness.
Coloring Agents
Color undeniably plays a vibrant, fun, and impressive role in cake decorat-
ing. Although other ways to color — including sprays, markers, and even 
airbrushing — exist, you’re most likely to use gels and pastes to tint your
frostings.
They generally don’t carry expiration dates, but you can’t hold on to food
coloring gels and pastes forever. Over time, they can separate or change
color, either lightening or darkening your intended shade. I recommend not
keeping gels and pastes for more than a year after purchase. Use a permanent
marker to write the date you bought the product on its label. And keep the
gels and pastes in a cool, dry area of your pantry or an area that’s not exposed
to heat, moisture, or harsh light.
Gels
Food coloring gels often come in 3⁄4-ounce plastic squeeze bottles. Typically,
the color of the gel is marked by a round dot in that color on the bottle’s 
flip-top. 
Some gels in popular colors come in larger quantities. Cake decorating kits
usually include a combination of 8 to 12 of the most popular colors, such
as black, blue, sky blue, red, pink, fuchsia, green, violet, brown, orange, teal,
and yellow. Food coloring gels are readily available on the Internet as well as
in cake decorating supply stores. You may not find the colors you want in
larger chain craft stores, which tend to have limited stock of gels but plenty
of pastes to choose from.
44
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

These bottles of coloring gel are different from write-on gels available in the
baking aisle of your grocery store. You use that type of gel, which is more
translucent than frosting, to write messages on a cake. Write-on gels have
little effect in adding a hue to a white frosting.
I’m partial to using food coloring gels rather than pastes to color frostings.
Squeezing the coloring gel into the frosting a drop at a time makes for less
mess and easier maneuvering than adding pastes to a mixture.
Pastes
Food coloring pastes, which usually come in 1⁄2-ounce pots, are more concen-
trated in color than their gel counterparts. Pastes are widely available in larger
chain craft stores as well as cake decorating supply stores in individual pots
or in sets of 8 to 12 popular colors (see the preceding section for the most
common colors).
Pastes sometimes yield a truer color than gels for the hue you’re trying to
achieve. However, you need some utensil — such as a toothpick — to add
the paste to the frosting. And, needless to say, you shouldn’t use the same
toothpick twice or you may get mixed colors or bits of buttercream or royal
icing in your paste pot (an unsanitary proposition at best).
Gathering Flavorings and Other Liquids
You need several liquid accoutrements for your cake making adventures to
add flavor, make gum paste and fondant, and accent batters.
Extracts and flavorings
On the flavor front, pure vanilla extract and almond extract are must-haves.
Depending on the favorite tastes in your household, you also may want to
include lemon extract, orange extract, anise (which has a licorice flavor),
and peppermint extract.
When it comes to extracts, use pure extract rather than the imitation counter-
part. The flavor of pure extract truly tastes more pure and intense than that
of imitation extract, and it doesn’t include any artificial ingredients. However,
if you’re eager to use a flavor that you can’t find in the pure form, the imitation
is okay.
45
Chapter 4: Stocking Your Pantry

If you’re preparing white frosting with vanilla extract as one of its ingredients,
know that the frosting will turn slightly ivory in color. If you want the frosting
to remain true white, you have to use a clear vanilla extract, which is only
available in the imitation form.
In addition to extracts, you have a wealth of other flavorings — also known 
as candy oils — to pick from to satisfy a recipe’s needs or to fulfill someone’s
special request. The possibilities really are endless and exciting. For instance,
these are widely available on the Internet and through specialty kitchen stores:
 Black walnut
 Blueberry
 Butterscotch
 Caramel
 Cherry
 Coconut
 Cream soda
 Eggnog
 Hazelnut
 Macadamia nut
 Passion fruit
 Peach
 Peanut butter
 Piña colada
 Root beer
 Violet
But be mindful in using flavorings because they’re more concentrated than
extracts, so a little goes a long way. If you’re adding flavoring to a batter or
frosting, begin with as little as 1⁄8 teaspoon, take a taste, and gradually add
more to your liking. (You can always add more flavoring, but you can’t take
it out after the fact!)
Additional flavorings are in the form of soaking syrups, such as those you see
in a coffee house, and liqueurs. Both liquids may be used to moisten layers of
cake while adding flavor. Occasionally, you also may need a liqueur to flavor
a cake batter.
46
Part I: Getting Ready to Decorate with Ease and Expertise 

Other common liquids
In your cake-filled escapades, these last few staples are good to have on hand:
 Corn syrup: A common sweetener that comes in both light and dark
varieties and lends a subtle caramel flavor (light) or a more dramatic
one (dark); called for in fondant and gum paste recipes
 Honey and maple syrup: Ingredients that add depth and also shade 
flavors with a different, rich sweetening effect
 Fruit juice: Contributes both liquid and flavoring to a recipe; use freshly
squeezed for best results
 Vinegar: Interacts with other ingredients for both taste and leavening
purposes
Embellishing with Pizzazz
Reserve room in your pantry for a bounty of goodies that lend charm, sophis-
tication, or just plain good humor to your cake creation. These are the fun
foodstuffs!
This section covers a few categories of goods to consider using for decora-
tions and, in some cases, adding to batters, frostings, and fillings. Be on the
lookout for any other treats that thrill you in color or appearance. (I address
actually enhancing your cakes with embellishments in Chapter 12.)
Candies
Practically anything goes when you’re decorating with candy. It’s a good idea
to keep bags of your favorites handy in case inspiration strikes and you need
them for a cake. Plus, if you don’t use the candy, you can always just eat it!
Candies commonly used in cake decorating include:
 Bubblegum
 Candy canes
 Candy corn
 Conversation hearts
 Jells and gummis
 Jelly beans
47
Chapter 4: Stocking Your Pantry

 Licorice
 Lollipops
 Marshmallows
 Peppermints
 Sours
 Stick gum
 Taffy
Chocolates
Chocolates come in many shapes, from round candy-coated chocolates to
chocolate kisses, from chocolate chips to chocolate squares or bars. You
can use the variety of shapes to create elaborate designs or illustrations, 
or simply make curls and shavings off a block of chocolate.
I recommend using chocolate as soon as you can. But for having some on
hand, semisweet chocolate can keep up to a year in your pantry. However,
you should keep packages sealed in resealable bags for optimum freshness.
As for milk chocolate and white chocolate, freeze those varieties if you’re
not using them immediately, wrapping them in a plastic, resealable bag when
you do.
Colorful additions
You have access to a kaleidoscope of amazing colors in the variety of sprinkles,
sanding sugars, and nonpareils on the market. Use them as simple, festive
decorations or as part of a more intricate design. Like spices and coloring
gels, these additions also don’t keep forever. Most likely, they won’t be
stamped with a “use by” date, but don’t keep them past a year from when 
you bought the container. And remind yourself by writing the date on the
container with a permanent marker.

 Coming up with an inspired design
T
he occasion’s coming and you’ve committed to having a cake there. Or
maybe you’d like to commit to have a cake there but don’t feel experi-
enced enough in the cake decorating department. Rest assured: Rather than
stop by a bakery or order one at the discount warehouse, you can craft your
own great-tasting, awe-inspiring cake.
Cake decorating isn’t just about the decoration, though; many aspects factor
into the equation of producing the best cake for an occasion. That’s why I
refer to cake decorating as a process. This chapter examines the first part of
the process, when you spend some time thinking about the occasion and fig-
uring out what kind of cake — from the shape and size to the flavors and the
design — is the most appropriate.
Considering the Occasion
and the Atmosphere
Here’s where your cake design starts. If you didn’t take time to assess the
upcoming event, you’d just put out a plain white or chocolate cake and call
it a day. But with all the opportunities for delicious and beautiful cakes, who
wants to just do that?
To make your cake memorable and truly special, analyze the event it will be
featured at. When I use the word “analyze,” I don’t mean that you have to

embark on some laborious, intense process. Gathering all the information
you need to influence and inform your cake’s taste and design should be both
fun and educational.
Surveying the celebrant and celebration
Before tackling the cake for an occasion, I like to spend some time with
the person in charge of the event and ask him or her some important ques-
tions. Each question addresses distinct, distinguishing characteristics of
the event, the person being feted, and ultimately, the cake that will be a culi-
nary centerpiece.
Some questions relate directly to the cake, but some just give you a better
idea of the event. You want your cake to be ideally suited to both the cele-
brant and the celebration, so it’s best to become familiar with what will be
going on at the event.
The following questions pertain to a wide spectrum of events: birthday par-
ties, baby showers, team league award ceremonies, anniversary banquets,
and evening weddings. Use this list as a guide for the upcoming event for
which you’re supplying a cake.
 What is the celebration? Does it have an official name?
 Is someone in particular being celebrated (such as a birthday honoree, a
wedding couple, or a baseball team)?
 How would you describe the celebrant?
 What are his or her interests, hobbies, and favorites?
 Does the celebrant have a favorite cake flavor? Frosting flavor? Filling?
 When is the event being held (both day and time)?
 How long will the event last?
 Is this an annual event, or a one-time-only affair?
 Where is the event taking place?
 What is the tenor or atmosphere of the event?
 How is the event space being decorated?
 Are there predominant colors to take into account?
 Is there a particular theme to consider?
 Is there a touchstone, heirloom, memento, or mascot that should some-
how factor into the cake decoration?
 Will there be flowers at the event? If so, what kinds and what colors?

Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Taking theme and audience into account
In all the information you gather, you obviously want to focus on the celebrant
and event. But you have two other major considerations as well: theme and
audience.
If the event doesn’t have a theme, you’re free to create one for your cake that
works with what you know about the celebrant. But if the event does have a
theme, you have to make sure that your cake fits in. In other words, a Santa
Claus cake isn’t right for a birthday party unless the birthday falls on December
25th or the celebrant looks like St. Nick. And a soccer field cake doesn’t play
well at a wedding (although featuring it as the groom’s cake isn’t unheard of).
These may be extreme examples (and I know of worse ones!), but they illustrate
my point that if you don’t factor in the event’s theme, your cake will be hope-
lessly incongruent with the affair. You want your cake to be in the spotlight
because it’s an appropriate celebration of the event, not because it’s completely
out of place.
In addition, realize that your theme should be carried out on a cake that fits
in with the people attending the event and ultimately eating the cake. Sure,
you may think a passion fruit puree with chopped lychee is a tasty filling for 
a white chocolate cake, but is a gang of 6-year-olds really going to enjoy it?
Regarding the audience, the rule of thumb is to avoid going too complex for
an audience that loves simple and to shun the too unusual for a group that
revels in the norm. Basically, in considering your taste and design, strive to
be age and theme-appropriate, and you’re off to a winning start.
Calculating how much cake to make
In many instances, your design starts with the shape of a cake: hexagon, square,
circle, petal, heart, oval, or rectangle. When you know the shape, you can
narrow down the size of that shape based on the selection of cake pans avail-
able. Most shapes come in many sizes; for example, round pans usually start
at 6 inches in diameter, and a rectangular or sheet cake can be anywhere up
to 18-x-24-inches in size.
I often get asked this question: How can I be sure that I’ll have enough cake?
I always err on the side of having too much cake. Leftovers are easy to dole
out, and people are compelled to return for seconds when the cake tastes
good. Ultimately, you never want someone to be left with an empty plate
because there was a run on the cake. Too much cake is better than not
enough, but let’s be real, too: A sheet cake for 40 looks ridiculous at an 
intimate gathering of 6, so some thoughtful planning is necessary.
If you’re planning to be at the event to cut the cake, decide beforehand how
the cake can be cut (and even make it a step in your design process). Even go
53
Chapter 5: Prepping for the Cake Decorating Process

as far as sketching up a sample cutting template or diagram. If it’s an oddly
shaped cake or features several layers, it’s helpful to know ahead of time how
to efficiently parcel it out into appetizing pieces of cake. If you don’t plan to
be at the event, create cutting guidelines for whoever does the honors. For
more information about the different shapes of cakes, and how many servings
they can yield, check out Chapter 22.
Be prepared to adjust your cutting plan to slice smaller but still substantial
pieces of cake if more guests than were expected show up.
Table 5-1 has some general guidelines for common cake sizes and their yields.

Picking Up Cake Decorating Lingo
Like any specialty, cake decorating has its own words and phrases that are
uniquely special to the art and craft of the process. As you embark on creat-
ing an amazing design perfect for the occasion at hand, familiarizing yourself
with this jargon sets you on course to dive in and master the recipes and
designs for delicious, memorable cakes.
Understanding the tools
As far as tools and utensils are concerned, you depend on icing spatulas to
spread your frosting, smooth it out, and make it conducive to decoration. In
addition, you may decorate your cake with different applications of frosting.
To do so, you place the frosting in pastry bags and use couplers to attach tips
in various sizes and designs. Those tips, along with the pressure you apply
to the pastry bag, produce different effects. A tool that fits in the tip category
54
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

(but isn’t actually a tip, per se) is the flower nail, which you use as a platform
on which to pipe the petals, ruffles, edges, and stamens of flowers, from roses
to lilacs and chrysanthemums to carnations.
For the cake itself, you put each layer on a cardboard base for easier move-
ment and transporting during the decorating process, and you may need to
place it on an elevated turntable to make it easier to decorate. You need to
prepare a cake board to host the finished cake; the board may be made of
wood, foam core, or a similar sturdy substance and be covered with your
choice of decorative materials. Whatever you use may need to be wrapped
again with a protective layer — such as thick cellophane — that’s easy to
wipe off so that your final presentation is neat and tidy and not smudged
with frosting.
Gathering components and coverings
You may want to flavor the cake using extracts or flavorings. White, yellow,
and chocolate are the most common types of cake, but your imagination
can run wild with red velvet, lemon, spice, and Tahitian vanilla flavors. You
pair the cake with any number of frostings for spreading on the top and sides
of the cake. The popular buttercream frosting may take on any of a number 
of flavors. A stiff decorator frosting, which is more rigid than buttercream, is
best for piping decorations. Other leading choices for frosting feature cream
cheese and chocolate ganache, which is made with whipping cream and semi-
sweet chocolate.
The frosting you plan to use on the outside of your cake also can serve as the
filling in between the cake layers. Or you may opt for a completely different
but complementary taste for the cake’s filling. A filling can be a mousse or
jam or can contain fruit or nuts.
Instead of traditional frosting, you may cover the surface of your cake with
any of the following:
 Icings, which are traditionally thinner than frostings, can sport a shiny
or matte finish. Royal icing, made with confectioners’ sugar and pasteur-
ized egg whites, hardens upon drying for a lasting effect.
 Glazes, which are made from heating sugar and water to produce syrup,
are a shiny coating for nuts and fruits atop a cake.
 Rolled fondant, a smooth covering made from confectioners’ sugar and
corn syrup (among other ingredients), gets carefully rolled out and laid
over a cake.
For decorating, you may choose to tint frostings, royal icing, and fondant with
food coloring gels or pastes, available in a lively, rainbow assortment of colors.
55
Chapter 5: Prepping for the Cake Decorating Process

You add them to achieve the desired shade for your effect, embellishment,
lettering, or design.
Prepping the surface
After you bake your cake, you need to level the top to create a perfectly flat
canvas on which to create your masterpiece.
Preparing your cake for decoration may be a bit of a construction project:
You may be working with several layers and need to construct tiers. Tiers
usually require you to insert dowels into the layers to add support so that
each layer doesn’t cave in when another layer’s placed on top of it. Other
than tiers, you may be cutting cakes to fit together to form a bigger shape
or working with a cake mold of a particular shape.
When you initially frost your cake, you cover it with a crumb coat, which is a
thin layer of frosting that seals in crumbs. You refrigerate it and then, when
that coat hardens, you’ll frost over it for a finished, seamless, smooth final
frosting coat.
Adding embellishment
Embellishing is often thought of as the most fun part of cake decorating
because, in this stage, you explore piping techniques, and place and 
position edible and inedible embellishments on your cake.
In determining your embellishments, you work from a plan — either a blueprint
of your very own design, a stencil you’re filling in, a pattern you’re following,
or a template you’re using as a guideline.
Piping refers to using a tip to apply frosting in any number of applications
and effects, including rosettes, shells, string work, lace work, and garlands,
among others, as well as borders around the top and bottom edges of your
cake.
You use icing tips and piping techniques to form letters or scripting for a mes-
sage. Specialized piping techniques include the basket weave, which involves
arranging rows of finely-grooved piping to produce a woven effect that looks
very much like a basket. In addition, you can pipe out large amounts of frost-
ing to form figures, such as clowns, dolls, or animals. And by using your icing
tips and a flower nail, you can create flowers to enhance your cake’s design.
Other edible embellishments include chocolate, nuts, fruits, and nonpoisonous
flowers as well as coconut, nonpareils, sprinkles, a variety of candies, and
sanding sugars. Inedible embellishments include just about anything, from a
wedding cake topper to tiny vintage toys or a ballerina ornament.
56
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

In addition to being a cake covering, you can use fondant as an embellishment;
fondant cutters allow you to create shapes or letters. Further, you can mold
gum paste and marzipan into figures and shapes: Gum paste, which is edible
but not very tasty, is great for shaping into flowers, and marzipan, which is
edible and tasty (it’s made from ground almond paste), is often molded into
fun, colorful vegetable shapes.
Picking Flavors for the Cake and Frosting
You have an infinite number of possibilities where the flavors and kinds of
cakes, frostings, and fillings are concerned. Simply perusing the variety of
boxed cake mixes and tubs of frostings available at your local grocery store
will give you an idea of the choices that await you when you prepare cakes
and frostings from scratch.
You want your cake to be as impressive on the inside as it is on the outside.
With the endless flavor combinations available, take the event and celebrant
into considerable account by asking yourself the following questions:
 Has there been a special request for a specific kind of cake and frosting?
If so, does it need to be tweaked (either because a recipe doesn’t exist or
because it’s so nontraditional that people at the party may not like it)?
 If a special request runs the risk of turning many event attendees off, can
you incorporate that flavor into cupcakes served on the side or a tier to
be removed from the main cake?
 If you’re not dealing with a special request, what cake and frosting combi-
nation will be the most delectable and enjoyed by everyone in attendance?
 Are any flavors or ingredients off-limits? (For example, a birthday cake
for a 1-year-old shouldn’t contain nuts because of concerns regarding
allergies or choking; the honoree at a retirement party may be allergic
to strawberries.)
 Is there a theme that the cake and frosting flavors should follow? Harvest,
tropical, and springtime themes immediately conjure up scents associated
with delicious, definitive flavors such as cinnamon, coconut, and lemon,
respectively.
 Is there a color scheme for the event that a certain flavor naturally ties
in with? (For example, a red, white, and blue color scheme is perfect
for a cake with three layers: one strawberry, one blueberry, and one
marshmallow.)
Having answered these questions, one flavor combination may immediately
spring to mind. If not, chart out a few options and test out some flavor pair-
ings or peruse store shelves to get a sense of what you can create from scratch
for this occasion.
57
Chapter 5: Prepping for the Cake Decorating Process

Devising a Design
The final step in the planning process for a decorated cake is finalizing a
design and committing to the actual cake.
The design process breaks down into four stages:
1. Brainstorming an array of choices to find the perfect idea
2. Deciding on the best design and draw up the blueprint
3. Assigning the right colors to the design
4. Assessing whether or not the cake you’re planning fits the bill in
terms of the event, theme, celebrant, and other relevant factors
Finding inspiration
Spend some time brainstorming ideas and gathering inspiration for how you
want the cake to look. In starting out, you may have an exact idea, a general
idea, or no idea at all; regardless, the right inspiration helps you fine-tune
your creation or coax it to fruition.
Your inspiration can come from anywhere: the Empire State building, a fashion
movement of the 1960s, your son’s comic books, or a 1920s etiquette book.
Don’t assume that you have to settle for a teddy bear-shaped cake or a square
that says “Happy Birthday” unless you think a more-traditional design is per-
fect for the celebration. But if you’re convinced that you can’t come up with a
better idea, think again.
When you have an upcoming occasion to plan a cake for, you may be surprised
at what jumps out at you as a possibility for a cake design. Take a look around
you, and peruse photos that fit in with the theme of the party or event for
the featured cake. In some cases, an honoree or celebrant knows exactly
what he or she wants the cake to look like, such as the shape of a football
helmet, a parachute, or a re-creation of a high school prom. You may not
have a detailed vision of such images, but remember that the Internet is
loaded with photos to help you out. Simply enter the theme or look into
your favorite search engine and browse the results. 
Taking stock of your options
Mull over the various ways you can design your cake based on your inspiration.
Depending on the time you have and your eagerness to explore, you may
want to pull out a pad of paper and sketch out a few of the ideas you have in
mind.
58
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

You may want to ease into your design. For instance, if your original plan of
building a pirate ship cake from scratch seems overwhelming, don’t be afraid
to step back and take a simpler approach.
Consider your skill set before committing to a cake design. Cake decorating
should be an enjoyable, continuing activity . . . not one that you immediately
abandon after a frustrating first go. To that end, realize that every design —
or the thought of a design — carries a multitude of choices; be open to
all possibilities. For example, rather than build a pirate ship out of cake,
you could draw one on the cake’s surface and fill in the ship’s spaces with
crushed candies. If drawing the pirate ship on the cake seems too daunting,
find a toy pirate ship or a cake topper set of pirate paraphernalia and pipe
waves of blue frosting around it.
After you come up with the perfect design, make a rough sketch of it. Don’t
worry if you weren’t an art major or think you can’t draw; you can sketch just
fine for cake planning purposes. The sketch is a visual, handheld guideline
that you can easily muck around with and make adjustments to for the exact
look you’re trying to achieve with your cake. Believe me: You don’t want to
be standing over your cake with only a mental snapshot of what the cake
should look like. To sketch out your design, you need the following:
 Sketchpad of plain white paper
 Drawing pencil
 Pencil sharpener
 Set of colored pencils
 Gum eraser
Discerning colors
Part of the design process is assigning colors to your sketch, the blueprint
for your final cake. Use your colored pencils to color in your sketch and see
how the color combinations you’re expecting to use look on your design.
Each season, the fashion industry adopts a hot color palette of the hues
that are “in.” If possible and appropriate — and particularly for cakes and 
celebrations for grown-ups — you may want to use some of those colors for
your cake. You can either check out fashion magazines for the latest shades,
or type “color trends” or “hot colors” followed by the current year into your
Internet search engine and investigate the sites that pop up. You can also visit
one of my favorite sites for color at www.pantone.com. Pantone’s business
is color. It’s a company that facilitates both communication and technology
about color for a variety of industries, and it offers a plethora of the current
season’s eye-catching hues and other related valuable information on their site.
59
Chapter 5: Prepping for the Cake Decorating Process

Don’t choose a color for the cake just because it’s your favorite (unless it’s
for your own birthday!) or because you think a few colors pair well in your
mind. Use your coloring pencils to experiment and actually see what goes
with what. You may be surprised to find that, when you see hues side by 
side, they aren’t anything like what you expected . . . or they look better
than you thought, giving you more confidence in your design.
Chapter 7 offers further advice and instructions regarding finding and mixing
colors and coming up with the best shades for your work.
Greenlighting your plan
Having come up with the design for your cake and given it the colors that
work best, you must determine if your planned cake will be the event’s 
definitive culinary centerpiece. You want the celebrant to revel in the cake’s
taste and creation and all the cake eaters to remember it as a vibrant, delicious
cake.
For a final review, consider this last set of questions to ensure that you’re
embarking on a successful cake decorating adventure. If you’re comfortable
with your answers, you’re well on your way to an amazing amount of fun in
the kitchen.
 Have I tested this flavor combination of cake, frosting, and, if appropriate,
filling? Am I sure the flavors complement one another?
 Will the majority of the cake eaters like the cake’s flavor?
 Is the design congruent with the celebrant’s style?
 Is the design appropriate for the event?
 Do the colors pair well with each other and with the event?
 Is the design too complicated for my skill set?
 Before I begin baking, do I have the design clearly mapped out?
 Before I begin decorating, have I reviewed and tweaked the design 
sufficiently?

C
akes can attract attention for eye-catching
designs, but unfortunately, they sometimes
fall flat when it comes to taste. Don’t sacrifice
taste for decoration, or vice versa. With a little
care, attention, and an indispensable collection of recipes, you can take your
creation to the next tier — shining an even bigger spotlight on your decorat-
ing because the cake itself tastes so good!
The foundation for your soon-to-be masterpiece begins with a cake that’s
moist and delicious. In this chapter, you’re treated to the techniques that
are keys to a visually exciting cake’s basic — but important — beginnings:
measuring ingredients, pouring batter, lining pans, and taking cakes out of 
the oven. Plus, you get recipes that will become the staples of your baking
endeavors, providing the perfect inside tastes to accompany your cake deco-
rating. After all, the goal is to make a cake that people want to admire and eat!
Comprehending the Language
of Cake Baking
Before you fire up the oven and get your stand mixer whirring, you need to
be familiar with a few terms that you’re bound to see in almost every recipe
you tackle.
 Greasing: Greasing your pan refers to spreading butter or shortening
all over the insides of your cake pans before pouring batter into them.
Recipes often tell you also to flour the pan after greasing it by shaking
Recipes in This

a few teaspoons of flour around the pan to completely cover the surface.
These steps ensure that, after baking, a cake comes out of the pan with-
out sticking to the bottom; when you flip the cake onto a cooling rack, it
should come out perfectly intact.
 Preheating: Preheating the oven so that your cake goes in at the desired
temperature is of paramount importance. Otherwise, your cake is sub-
jected to a longer baking time while it sits in the oven waiting for it to
reach the desired temperature. Another downside to not preheating
your oven is that it takes longer to heat because a big cake’s in there
waiting to bake.
 Sifting: Sifting is a technique that involves measuring dry ingredients
(most often flour) into a sieve or sifter and then passing it through the
mesh of that apparatus. Sifting allows you to break down (or eliminate)
compacted clumps that may have settled in your dry ingredients. If you
don’t catch ’em, these clumps become balls in your batter and also pre-
vent proper leavening, which allows your cake to rise to its best occasion.
 Creaming: Creaming usually refers to mixing softened butter (or what-
ever type of fat you’re using, such as shortening or a butter/shortening
mixture) and sugar together until you have a completely smooth mixture.
It’s usually the first step in mixing your cake ingredients. The quickest
and easiest way to cream butter and sugar is to use the paddle attach-
ment on your stand mixer.
 Folding: To fold ingredients, you use a rubber spatula to gently draw the
addition into the batter. Recipes usually call for folding when you need
to incorporate stiffly beaten egg whites or freshly whipped cream into a
batter. The technique requires a delicate touch because you don’t want
to destroy the air and lift of the beaten or whipped ingredient.
Measuring Up
In measuring your ingredients, precision is key. You may be surprised to find
out that baking cakes actually is very scientific. (It’s no surprise to me when
I find out that a medical doctor, like my brother, or a chemist is an excellent
baker!) Whereas some cooking almost pleads for you to add a dash more of
this or that, complement the ingredients with others, or give your own twist
to the listed instructions, cake baking commands (and even demands) that
you stick to the prescribed regimen.
For some liquid ingredients — such as milk, cream, buttermilk, or oil — you
should rely on a glass measuring cup. Using a glass measuring cup is easier
in the long run because you get an exact visual on your measurement. It also
makes for easier pouring of liquid ingredients. For precise measuring, set the
62
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

glass measure on your work surface and fill it while checking the measure at
eye level. Don’t pick up the measuring cup to check the measure. To get an
even, accurate measure, leave the cup on your work surface and bend or
kneel down to check it.
Following are a few general recommendations for measuring:
 Consider having on hand two sets of measuring cups and spoons: one
for liquid ingredients and the other for dry ingredients. This conve-
nience cuts down on your preparation time and allows you to easily
segue between measuring out different ingredients.
 Take your time and measure your ingredients out before you start
mixing things together. Your cake batter will come together much
more quickly if everything’s measured and ready to go.
 For ease in clean-up, consider lining your work surface. Wax paper and
aluminum foil both work well to catch spills and drips, especially from
milk and eggs, and they make clean-up a breeze.
 Don’t measure over the batter you’re mixing. If you need only a small
amount of an ingredient — such as salt, vinegar, or vanilla — you may
be tempted to simply spoon out a bit as the mixer is running. But one
slip and it’s time to start over. After all, a little vinegar goes a long way
(and a lot of vinegar really ruins a cake batter!). Once an ingredient’s
mixed in, there’s no getting it out, so err on the side of caution and mea-
sure over another bowl.
If your recipe calls for dry ingredients measured by weight (or if you’re extra
excited about measuring), invest in a kitchen scale, which determines quantity
more precisely than a volume measurement. Scales come in both manual and
electronic versions; in either case, make sure that weigh-ins account for both
ounces and grams. If you opt for a manual scale, get one with a removable
weighing bowl or tray, and make sure the numbers are easy to read. I prefer a
digital kitchen scale just because it tends to be more compact (which makes
it easier to store), and I like that a digital display expresses the weight clearly
and quickly. Plus, I like that I can put my own bowl on it for quick and easy
measuring.
Flour
Before you measure out flour for a cake recipe, stir and aerate it first with
a balloon whisk to break up any lumps. Stirring the flour first also leads to
more accurate measuring.
Gently spoon the flour into a stainless steel or plastic measuring cup (don’t
scoop it straight out of the container). Then level the flour by scraping a knife
63
Chapter 6: Baking the Perfect Cakes

across the top of the cup. You don’t want to pack the flour into the cup, so
take care not to press the knife down too hard as you level.
If a recipe calls for flour that’s not sifted, you simply measure it out as I
describe and add it to the recipe. However, recipes mentioning “sifted flour”
need particular attention:
 If a recipe calls for “flour, sifted,” you measure out the flour, sift it, and
then add it to your recipe.
 If a recipe calls for “sifted flour,” you measure out a little more flour than
what’s called for, sift it, and then precisely measure the amount you need
from the sifted flour.
You can buy presifted flour, but it may still need to be sifted. When flour
sits on a grocery store shelf, it settles, meaning that lumps inevitably form.
Therefore, I recommend that you always sift flour, even if the package says
it’s presifted.
Sugar
Measure sugar in much the same way as you measure flour (see the preceding
section). Even though sugar is less likely to clump than flour, make sure that
yours is lump-free. Stir it up first, scoop the sugar into your measuring cup,
and then level it with the flat side of a knife.
If a recipe calls for light or dark brown sugar, you need to pack it firmly into
your measuring cup (and still make sure that it is level). When you add brown
sugar to the mixing bowl, the sugar should hold the shape of the cup it came
from.
Butter and shortening
Measuring butter is fairly easy: On sticks or bars, follow the tablespoon and
cup indications on the wrappers. In your local grocery store, you can find 
1-pound packages of butter, each containing four bars. Each 4-ounce bar is 8
tablespoons, or 1⁄2 cup.
Some cake recipes may call for shortening, or in some cases, you may be able
to substitute shortening for butter. If you’re using shortening, opt for packaged
shortening that comes in bars. Like sticks of butter, you can measure off table-
spoons and cups quickly and neatly without having to scoop shortening out
of a container to fill measuring cups or spoons.
64
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Eggs
When preparing eggs for a recipe, crack them into a separate measuring cup
or bowl. Preparing the eggs separately has two advantages:
 On the rare occasion that you get a bad egg (literally), you don’t ruin
your entire batter by mixing the bad egg in.
 If a bit of shell comes away as you crack the egg, it’s far easier to fish it
out of your measuring cup (with a fork, of course!) than out of a mixing
bowl full of other ingredients.
Spices, baking soda, and baking powder
Recipes usually call for dry ingredients like spices, baking soda, and baking
powder in measuring spoon amounts. Dip the clean measuring spoon into the
ingredient, and level it off with a knife’s straight edge before adding it to your
mixing bowl.
Sticky substances
For ingredients such as honey, molasses, or corn syrup, squeeze or pour the
substance into a measuring spoon or cup rather than scoop it out.
Cover the measuring surface with nonstick spray so that the sticky goodness
slides right out into your mixing bowl and you have a much easier time clean-
ing up everything.
Vanilla, vinegar, and other liquids
Simply pour liquid ingredients from the bottle into your measuring spoon or
cup. Just be sure to pour them away from the mixing bowl in case you pour
too much or a bit sloshes out as you’re measuring!
Fruits, nuts, and the like
To measure chopped nuts, flaked coconut, or dried or grated fresh fruits (or
vegetables, like carrots for a carrot cake), spoon the ingredient into a measur-
ing cup and tap it down lightly to get an accurate measure. Then add it to your
batter.
65
Chapter 6: Baking the Perfect Cakes

Prepping the Pans
To prepare the pans you’re using for the particular cake you’re baking, you
need to grease, flour, and, with some cakes, line them with parchment paper
(although not always in that particular order!).
For greasing pans, many cake bakers swear by shortening while others prefer
butter. For a time, I would have suggested only shortening . . . but now I use
only butter. In general, I avoid most nonstick sprays because I’ve found that
they tend to leave a gummy residue on the bakeware after the cake’s turned
out. That said, I’ve had nice success with a cooking spray that includes flour,
so if you’re committed to cooking sprays, I suggest you look for that kind.
To line a pan, you put a piece of parchment paper into the pan after you
grease it. This step is often necessary when baking large cakes — such as
sheet cakes or wedding cakes — because it allows for more uniform baking
and basically gives you a double-guarantee that the cake will turn out cleanly.
To line the pan:
1. Grease and flour the entire pan.
Using a paper towel or piece of wax paper, spread butter or shortening
all over the inside of your cake pan, and then shake a few teaspoons
of flour around the pan to completely cover the surface. To get a light 
coating of flour, tap the pan against the heel of one hand as you move
it around. When the pan’s coated in flour, dump out any excess.
2. Set the pan on the parchment paper right-side up, and trace around
the bottom of the pan with a pencil. Then cut the shape out and place
the paper in the bottom of your pan.
3. Grease and flour the parchment paper, following the procedure in
Step 1.
Lining a pan with parchment paper is completely unnecessary (not to mention
difficult) for a Bundt or highly detailed pan. For these pans, grease all the

Experience of a cooking spray convert
I first tried cooking spray with flour when I was
asked to make a rosebush cake that I designed
to include 36 rose cakelets each baked in a very
intricate blooming rose-shaped mold. I knew
that getting butter into all the crevices of the
molds would be an arduous, time-consuming,
and ultimately unsuccessful task. A catering
friend had mentioned having good results with a
cooking spray with flour, so I decided to give it
a try. The cakelets tumbled out of the molds per-
fectly, the molds weren’t left sticky, and a new
allegiance was born.

nooks and crannies using a nonstick spray with flour. For more advice on
working with molds, see the sidebar “Baking with molds.”
Mixing the Batter
Mixing up your cake batter is the fun part of cake baking because you see
all the individual ingredients come together. Some recipes call for you to
combine all the ingredients in a single bowl and just mix away. This kind of
cake is referred to as a dump cake. However, mixing up the batter is a bit
more complicated in many recipes, and it’s another part of the cake baking
process in which you really need to follow instructions.
Most of the basic cake recipes in this chapter begin with creaming butter and
sugar. You should start with softened but not melted butter; cream the butter
first, then add the sugar gradually. Beat the butter and sugar, basically drawing
air into them, until the mixture is pale in color, light, and fluffy.
Many recipes tell you to add flour alternately with milk (or buttermilk or
cream). When alternate adding is necessary, start and end with the flour.
For most cakes, you should try to mix the flour in four even additions and
the liquid, in between that, in three equal ones. Mixing these ingredients in
alternate additions prevents the cake from becoming tough or full of tunnels.
During the mixing process, be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl at least
two times with a rubber spatula. It’s so disheartening to ready your batter for
pouring and discover that a whole mess of ingredients settled at the bottom
of the bowl and were never incorporated in the batter. The mess doesn’t look
pretty added as an afterthought to the top of your cake pans when you pour
the batter!
If you get to the end of pouring the batter and realize that a disheartening
amount of ingredients have settled into the bottom of the bowl, don’t despair.
Gently scrape the batter back into the mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to
stir in the ingredients that went unmixed the first time. Then beat the batter
just long enough to incorporate all the ingredients. For the whole process,
work quickly, and don’t overbeat. Pour the batter back into freshly cleaned,
greased, and floured pans.
Because not everyone uses the same stand or hand mixer, times for mixing can
vary: Two minutes of beating with one mixer could be more than two minutes
on another and less than two minutes on a third mixer. So you should look for
recipe watchwords, such as “creamy,” “light and fluffy,” or “just combined” to
give you visual cues.

Chapter 6: Baking the Perfect Cakes

Getting Down the Rules
for the Perfect Cakes
Perhaps you’re baking a cake for an anniversary celebration, your daughter’s
birthday, or a neighbor’s homecoming. Whatever the event, stick to a recipe
that you’ve already tried and now trust. The time will come when you can
scan a recipe and attempt it without a preliminary outing because you’re
familiar with ingredients, proportions, and different flavorings. But for now,
stick with and perfect a cake repertoire that you can turn to for most celebra-
tions and cake-worthy opportunities.
If you really want to branch out but aren’t totally comfortable with the cake
you’re attempting, give it a trial run. If it’s too large, mathematically downsize
the recipe, and do a taste test so that you can see and taste the cake’s taste
and texture, make minor adjustments (if necessary), and — most important —
build your confidence for the main event.
You may get inspired and suddenly have an idea for a cake that you think
will be perfect for the occasion, but unless you have time to test it before-
hand, now’s not the time to experiment. Do that on your own time!
Give yourself enough time! Your cake (and you, for that matter) will suffer if
you rush through the baking and decorating process. This section covers the
basic steps of cake baking, from beginning to end.
Reading up and getting ready
Before you start measuring and mixing, read through the entire recipe. You
don’t want to get midway through making a cake only to realize that you need
68
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 
Wow! That’s a lot of cake!
Las Vegas celebrated its 100th anniversary in
2005 with the world’s biggest birthday cake. The
cake weighed 130,000 pounds and was 102 feet
long, 52 feet wide, and 20 inches tall. The cake’s
ingredients added up to 23,000 pounds of flour;
35,000 cups of sugar; and 130,000 eggs. The
frosting, which weighed roughly 34,000 pounds,
consisted of 42,000 cups of sugar; 10,200 cups
of shortening; 5,200 cups of butter; and 5,200
cups of corn syrup. Five hundred volunteers
spent 14 hours constructing and decorating the
cake, which consisted of 30,240 half-sheet
cakes. This undertaking makes all your baking
endeavors much less daunting, doesn’t it?!

to let the batter refrigerate for 90 minutes . . . and you were supposed to be at
an event with the cake an hour ago.
As you review your recipe, assemble all your ingredients and measure every-
thing out to make sure that you have what you need and you have enough of it.
Before you start mixing, preheat your oven, and select and prepare (grease,
flour, and line) your pans. Use the shape of pan that the recipe suggests. Your
cake may end up looking quite different than you want it to if you fill a different
kind of cake pan with the batter without making any adjustments to the recipe.
Opt for shiny pans for best results. If you bake in a dark-colored or glass pan,
lower the oven temperature 25 degrees.
Battering up and baking
If you’re using only one pan, simply pour your batter into the pan after it’s all
mixed up, and smooth it with a rubber spatula to encourage a more level rise
as it bakes.
If you need to divide your batter up into more than one pan, you have two
choices for even distribution: Simply eyeball it, or if you’re eager to be more
exact, use a kitchen scale to ensure that your pans weigh the same when
filled.
I don’t recommend pouring batter into a measuring cup and doling out
amounts into pans. Scraping batter in and out of cups tends to mess with
its volume and delays getting fresh batter in the oven. The less you futz with
it, the better!
Batter should come up to approximately two-thirds of the pan’s height. Any
less and you have a layer that looks too flat. Too much and your cake overflows
into the oven. After you pour the appropriate amounts of batter into your
pans, smooth the batter with a rubber spatula to encourage a more level rise
as it bakes.
Set the pans in the oven on the middle rack, but make sure not to crowd
them. If you need to, stagger the pans on different racks. There needs to be
enough space between the pans for the heat to circulate and cook the cakes
evenly. If you notice during the baking time that one layer seems to be cook-
ing faster than the other, switch the pans’ rack positions.
Opening your oven door too much during baking tampers with the oven’s
temperature and may cause your cake to deflate a bit. Instead of opening the
door, use your oven light to check the cake’s progress.
69
Chapter 6: Baking the Perfect Cakes

Leveling during baking
This step may seem a little silly but, during baking, you may notice that your
batter swoops to one side or that there’s more in the front of the pan than in
the back. This unevenness could be the result of a maladjusted backing rack,
a slightly tilted oven, or an uneven floor. If your cakes consistently come out
lopsided, get out a toolbox level. On a cool oven, check the level of your
racks and the oven itself, and also check the floor the oven sits on.
If the oven isn’t level on your floor (or if your entire floor is actually uneven)
you could prop up the oven with a shim (a thin piece of wood). However, I
recommend having a handyman or kitchen contractor check out your situa-
tion because messing with the oven’s positioning, particularly if it’s a gas
oven, can cause all kinds of problems if the remedy goes awry.
If you think that your oven rack is the culprit, pull it out of the oven and exam-
ine it. If it’s warped, replace it. If the rack looks fine, it could be sticking to the
inside of the oven at an angle or lodged into an off-kilter position because of
baked-on food. Your best recourse with an uneven rack is to thoroughly check
out the situation to determine the cause.
Knowing when a cake is done
Testing for a cake’s doneness can be tricky. Many cake bakers espouse the
virtues of a cake tester that, when inserted in the center of the cake, comes
out completely clean, but I advocate the importance of a few moist crumbs
attached to the tester. (If you don’t have a tester, a toothpick works fine, 
too.) Too often, cakes are overdone. In addition to the cake tester test, look
for other signs of doneness, including:
 The cake springs back when lightly touched.
 The cake has risen and is just pulling away from the sides of the pan.
 The cake doesn’t jiggle when you pull the oven rack out to inspect it.
 The cake’s color indicates that it’s done, such as a golden brown top if
it’s a yellow cake.
 The cake has lost the sheen of a shiny batter.
Just as mixers vary for mixing, ovens vary for baking. So always take a baking
time as a suggestion and make adjustments for your oven. Become familiar
with how your make and model operates by paying close attention to baking
times and results when you bake, well, anything. And use an oven thermome-
ter to check the accuracy of your oven’s temperature. If you set the oven for
400 degrees F, does it actually get that hot? If not, or if it hits 425 degrees, you
need to adjust a cake’s baking time accordingly.
70
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Cooling and extracting the cake
Before leveling (slicing off any slight peak to your cake layer) and frosting,
your cake must cool completely. To cool your cake and get it out of the pan
the right way, follow these steps:
1. Let the cake sit in its pan for 10 minutes after you pull it out of the
oven.
2. Insert the tip of a knife into the space between your cake and the side
of the pan, and glide it carefully around the pan.
3. Place one cooling rack on the top of the cake, grab the rack and the
cake pan, and quickly flip it all over, inverting your cake onto the
cooling rack to cool completely.
4. Slowly and carefully pull the pan directly up and away from the cake.
If you lined your pan with parchment paper, peel it off the facing side
of the cake.
5. Lay a second cooling rack on the facing side of the cake (which is
actually the bottom of the cake), and invert it again by holding both
racks and flipping them.
Avoiding cake-tastrophes
As you work to perfect your cakes, you may run into a few problems: Your
cakes may seem dry, shrink too much, or contain tunnels, for instance.
Don’t dismay. Make sure that your oven is reaching the right temperature
and that you’re ready to check for doneness at the appropriate time. If the
oven doesn’t seem to be the problem, many times the culprit is undermixing
or overmixing.
71
Chapter 6: Baking the Perfect Cakes
Baking with molds
Cathedrals, Christmas trees, fire trucks, snow-
men, roosters . . . you can get a cake mold in vir-
tually any size, shape, or creation.
If you decide to use a cake mold, take note of its
capacity. If you don’t have the right amount of
batter to fill the mold, the cake doesn’t take on
the desired shape. And too much batter results
in a misshapen cake (and probably a drippy
mess in your oven, too).
Before pouring batter into a mold, grease and
flour it properly. Many cake molds have intricate
designs and patterns that make greasing tricky.
To ensure that you get all the crevices, use a
nonstick spray with flour.

Being aware of potential cake problems at the outset can make you more
mindful in your next endeavor. Check out these handy guidelines and try,
try again. Don’t let it intimidate you — it’s only cake batter!
 If your cake is dry, cracked on top, or appears to have shrunk, you
may have overmixed the batter. On the dryness front, you also may have
skimped on the liquid ingredients.
 If your cake has a coarse texture or has holes and tunnels running
through it, you may have undermixed the batter.
 If your cake falls, you may have tested too soon for doneness, or it may
be underbaked.
 If your cake doesn’t rise properly, the batter may have been overmixed
or undermixed.
 If your cake is stuck in the pan, you may not have greased the pan or
parchment paper enough, or you may have left the cake in the pan for
too long after baking.
You may have to live with a few lumpy or dry cakes on your road to delicious
perfection, but don’t sweat it too much. That’s why I advise you do a test run
and give your cakes a preliminary sample.
Above all else, have fun when baking your cakes. When you relax, you enjoy
the process more and — after just a bit of fine-tuning — your cake eaters can
enjoy your efforts, too.
Perfecting the Basic Cake Repertoire
This section contains a handful of very important ingredient tips and some of
the trustiest recipes to produce cakes that you can later lavish with stunning
decorations and your own creativity. These recipes are all designed to fill two
9-inch round pans or one 9-x-13-inch rectangular pan. (Many of the recipes
in this book start with these basic recipes but then are adjusted to produce
larger cakes or to incorporate different flavorings.)
Lining up the ingredients
Keep the following tips in mind when gathering your ingredients to make the
cakes in the next section:
 Don’t substitute margarine for butter, and definitely steer clear of vegetable
oil spreads, as the amount of fat in them varies. Furthermore, you should
72
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

always use unsalted rather than salted butter so that you control the salt
in the recipe (and don’t have to contend with it if it’s not an ingredient in
the recipe). In addition, cut the butter into 1⁄2-inch chunks to make the
creaming process easier.
 Most of the recipes in the next section call for cake flour, which I’m a
huge fan of when it comes to cakes. Cake flour is milled from soft winter
wheat, which produces delicate flour that really isn’t interchangeable
with all-purpose flour. Sifting cake flour is almost always a necessity in
recipes, so I usually get that out of the way first, sifting the flour into a
large bowl and then measuring out of that bowl.
 When a recipe calls for milk, I usually stick with whole milk. From time to
time, I’ve substituted reduced-fat milk, but whole milk really is best. The
lower fat content of one percent and fat-free milk detracts from the fat in
the recipe and results in a less rich flavor.
 For eggs, size matters, and large eggs are the norm for the following
recipes. However, if you must use an egg substitute, two large eggs gen-
erally equal 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 cup of substitute, and three eggs are roughly equal
to 1⁄2 to 2⁄3 cup of substitute. With those guidelines (and the equivalents
that are usually printed on egg substitute cartons), you can substitute
accordingly.
 If a recipe calls for separate egg whites or egg yolks, you need to separate
those parts of the eggs. The easiest method is to crack an egg over a bowl
(not your mixing bowl!), let the yolk glide into one half of the shell, and
let the white fall away into the bowl. You may need to transfer the yolk
back and forth between the shells a few times before the white completely
separates. Alternately, you can use an egg separating device that allows
the white to strain through a slotted sieve, but I’m partial to the hands-only
method (because it’s fun and it leaves one less apparatus to clean up!).
Take care in handling raw eggs. Wash exposed surfaces (and your
hands) with an antibacterial soap after handling eggs to prevent 
cross-contamination.
 In recipes that call for oil, use only all-vegetable oil, and definitely stay
away from olive oil! That’s one taste that you don’t want in your cake!
Making the cakes (finally!)
Without further ado, here are some basic cake recipes. Remember to practice,
have fun, and don’t forget to enjoy the finished product.

Smoothing the Way for Decorating
In This Chapter
 Thinking through your decoration plan

 Creating a level, layered cake for decorations
 Transferring designs to the cake canvas
 Choosing and mixing colors for maximum effect
A
fter your cake is out of the oven (I cover baking cakes in Chapter 6),
you need to put it in tip-top, level shape to smooth the way for fillings 
to stack up, frostings and icing to shine, and decorations to sparkle. At that
point, you can put your design plan in motion on the cake and feature it
attractively for serving as well.
Perhaps the only thing worse than a cake that tastes bad is one that looks
bad, and if you don’t prepare a baked cake properly, your decorations won’t
look right no matter how skilled you are or how much time you spend trying
to get it just right.
Although your work on decorating starts after the cake comes out of the oven,
the best way to ensure an attractive cake is to start the design process before
you rev up your mixer. That means planning ahead and thinking through your
entire cake design before you make your first move. In Chapter 5, I dole out
some ideas and inspiration for drawing up the cake design. In this chapter,
you take the first steps of actually implementing those creative stirrings on
the cake itself. You also get some ideas for covering the cake board in a way
that enhances the overall design of your cake, working with design templates
and patterns, and mixing colored frosting that makes your cake look just as
good as it tastes.
Devising Your Game Plan
So you know what cake you’re baking, you’ve picked a frosting, and you know
exactly what you want your cake to look like just before its served, right?

If you don’t, take a breather right now and make some decisions. Before you
start baking the cake — and even before you preheat that oven — you have
to know how the cake is supposed to look in its final presentation.
Of course something may go amiss, you may have to improvise, a color may
not turn out as planned, or you may decide that the design of a star tip looks
better than a round one. But, overall, you need to have your blueprint in place.
If you don’t, you’re left to make it up as you go along, and that’s certainly not
the way to get great results.
Start your planning by considering how much time you have to prepare the
cake and how best to use that time. You also need to think through your design
plan from start to finish in order to make sure you’re not left missing ingredi-
ents or wondering how everything will come together.
Timing
With the design in hand, map out a timetable that includes your approximate
times for
 Gathering ingredients and materials for your cake’s presentation 
 Baking and cooling the cake layers
 Preparing the frosting
 Making the filling
 Decorating the cake
 Staging the cake
To ensure accuracy and prevent unwanted delays, assemble all your ingredients
before you start mixing anything. (You may not want to set out refrigerated
ingredients; just make sure you have what the recipe calls for.)
For example, take a look at this timetable for the Play Ball! Baseball Cake from
Chapter 13. Keep in mind that you should read through an entire recipe first
to ascertain not just prep time, baking, and decorating, but also cooling and
refrigeration. Plus, the recipes will include not only the cake, but also the
frosting (and possibly separate filling) you’ll have to make. Taking all these
aspects into account will help create a successful, entire, and complete cake
decorating experience. To make this cake from start to finish, you need this
much time:
Initial prep time
At least 30 minutes to gather ingredients and
to set up your cake board
Preparing the cake batter
15 minutes
Baking and cooling time
50 minutes, plus 2 hours for cooling
82
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Preparing the frosting
10 minutes
Decorating time
1 hour, plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Staging
At least 30 minutes, to ensure that the cake
board is clean and free of crumbs and frosting,
and also to set up and decorate the area from
which the cake will be served
Adding up the different times involved will give you a realistic timetable.
Oftentimes, I’ll bake the cake the night before a birthday party, for instance,
and crumbcoat it. Then, the day of the event itself I’ll concern myself with all
the decorating and final staging.
Keeping design in mind
Decorating a cake takes time, but you can save yourself some trouble by
having all the elements of your design mapped out and ready to go. Consider
these questions regarding design elements that may play roles in your cake
design:
 Will you use a template or stencil? If so, do you have it on hand?
 Will you have to sketch a design out in the frosting? Do you have a
bamboo skewer or toothpick to do so with?
 Are candies or confections part of the design? Do they need to be sepa-
rated out, and if so, are they?
 Do you know what you’ll do with colored frostings after they’re mixed?
 Do you have the icing tips you need? Would it save you time during 
decorating to have extra tips available, and if so, do you have them?
 Will you be scripting a name or message? Do you know how everything
is spelled?
 Have you composed the entire greeting word for word?
 Have you measured and blocked out the design on a piece of parchment
paper the same size as your finished cake to ensure proper placement
and proportion?
Covering Cake Boards
The cake board, which is the foundation that holds your stunning creation, is
an important element of your presentation. Cake boards are usually made of
a hardwood pastry board, Masonite, plywood, foam core, or heavy plastic.
Before you’re in the throes of mixing, baking, and decorating, get your cake
83
Chapter 7: Smoothing the Way for Decorating

board ready and keep it waiting in the wings until you’re ready to place your
cake on it. A cake from a bakery may just come on plain, sturdy cardboard,
but when you’re the one doing the baking and decorating, you can decorate
the cake board to reflect the special nature of the event the cake is being 
featured at.
Wrapping it up in paper and fabric
You don’t want the cake board decoration to conflict with the look of the
cake or distract attention from the cake with too busy a pattern, but a cake
board wrapped in a simple print looks festive and polished. Consider folding
a piece of fabric, wrapping paper, or patterned tissue paper over the board to
lend color and vibrancy.
After you wrap the cake board in paper or fabric, you need to cover it with
heavy cellophane as well. If you don’t, the cake and frosting are likely to
create unsightly stains on the material.
Using fondant or royal icing
Wrap your cake board with a sheet of colored fondant or spread a smooth
layer of white or tinted royal icing on the board and let it dry before resting
your cake on top. These options bring a beautiful and understated look to
your cake presentation and accent the cake with their clean appearance.
Considering unconventional ideas
Other possibilities for dressing up the cake board may fit in with your cake’s
design while lending fun or elegance to the presentation through visuals that
enhance (but don’t overwhelm) the cake. A few unconventional covering ideas
include:
 A map
 Sheet music
 A collage of greeting cards
 A collage of mementos
 Scrapbook essentials such as striped paper
With each of these coverings, consider their size. You may need to firmly
secure the items on a large piece of paper (particularly if you’re forming them
into a collage), and wrap heavy cellophane over it.
84
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Position the covering so that the most visual elements are around the cake’s
perimeter. It would be a shame to create a work of art for the cake board and
then cover it up completely with the cake.
Leveling and Torting the Cake
Leveling a cake that didn’t bake evenly and has a domed top can be an absolute
maddening proposition for some. But you must level a cake so that you can
create or place your design on a flat surface. Unleveled cakes just don’t look
very professional. After you put in all the energy and effort to devise a design,
bake, frost, and decorate a cake, you don’t want your cake eaters concentrat-
ing on the hump in the center of the cake; you want them to notice your amaz-
ing artistry! And with torting, you want to separate layers so that, after they’re
filled, they stack back up evenly.
A few tricks can help you level your cake with ease — and none of them require
a visit to the hardware store for a construction level!
Loving to level
I actually prefer leveling the cake before I put it on the cakeboard. With bigger,
rectangular cakes (such as those that are 12-x-18-inches), that means leveling
the cake on the cooling rack and then flipping it over onto your cakeboard so
that you have a nice even surface — that’s actually the bottom of the cake —
to decorate. Smaller layers can be leveled while they’re sitting — preferably,
if you have one — on a decorating turntable because they’ll be easier to
move to the cakeboard (with a large spatula/turner, described in Chapter 2)
once they’re leveled and decorated.
Before you make your leveling move, make sure that your cake has cooled
completely.
Some bakers are perfectly content to take a long serrated knife and lop off the
offending cake dome (see Figure 7-1). However, not everyone has such a
steady hand, and the last thing you want to do is keep slicing into a cake in a
futile attempt to even out the mess you’ve made. If you keep slicing away in a
quest for levelness, you may just end up with a very low-lying cake or one
that looks like a bed with a sunken hole in the middle.
Instead, consider picking up a cake leveler. With this handy tool (which looks
like a hand saw with a wire instead of a saw blade), you adjust the level to your
cake’s height and draw a steel wire across the top of the cake, slicing off the
dome and leaving you with a flat surface. Figure 7-1 shows you how to use a
cake leveler.
85
Chapter 7: Smoothing the Way for Decorating

Walk around the cake after you level it just to make sure that you’ve leveled
the entire cake top and not just the center. I even suggest bending down on
your knees to take in the cake top at eye level.
You may also want to consider employing a couple of available methods to
encourage a flatter cake top through even baking. These apparatuses are 
further explained in Chapter 2.
Tackling torting
Torting involves splitting each layer of a cake into one or more horizontal
layers that you then spread icing or fillings, such as mousse, citrus curd, or
jam, on before stacking them back up. Torting a cake makes for a dramatic
impact when the cake is sliced because the cake eater gets a peek at layers
upon layers of cake and filling.
An adjustable cake leveler, which I explain in the preceding section, works
wonderfully to give you a clean cut exactly in the middle of a cake layer. If
you want to slice the layers by hand, insert toothpicks halfway into the sides
of the cake in the middle of the layer and completely around the circumference.
Take the toothpicks out and use the tiny holes they leave as your guide as
you slice the layer in half with a sharp, serrated knife (see Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-1:
Leveling 
a cake.
86
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Accurate torting is important because if you aren’t ruthless in evenly slicing
the layer in half or into thirds or quarters, you’ll have a very difficult time
achieving a level cake as the end product. Just one uneven layer can throw
your whole cake off-kilter.
Drawing Up Designs
You know what you want your finished cake to look like, but how exactly do
you plan to achieve that look? You have several options to go about getting
the design you want actually on the cake.
As I explain in Chapter 5, don’t feel like you have to be a professional artist
with a mastery of paint strokes and who can draw intricate patterns. On
the other hand, you don’t want your design to look like amateur hour either.
Several premade design options are available, including templates that you
trace around and patterns you fill in. Still, don’t be afraid of freehand drawing
or coming up with an original design. For example, flip through a kid’s coloring
book for a host of easy drawings to mimic. You can break down any illustration
into a series of shapes.
Start off simply. Don’t try to recreate a Monet the first time out. Instead, start
with a tulip or a tree.
Figure 7-2:
Torting 
a cake.
87
Chapter 7: Smoothing the Way for Decorating

Sizing up the cake
For any design or illustration, you have to keep in mind the entire size of your
cake. A 6-inch design in the center of a 12-x-18-inch frosting canvas just doesn’t
look finished. Conversely, and unless you’re purposely achieving an all-over
design, don’t feel like you have to fill up every square inch of the cake’s sur-
face and sides. Blank space can have its place too, especially in drawing the
eye to your intentional design.
As the cake comes out of the oven, assess your canvas and compare the
cake’s surface with your design blueprint. Ask yourself these questions:
 Will everything fit?
 Do I need to make any adjustments to the design?
 Did the sides of the cake rise enough to accommodate any piping planned
for the perimeter?
If you’re creating a three-dimensional cake design, make sure that you have
all the pieces you need for the decoration. When your cake comes out of the
oven, get your ruler out and make sure that all the pieces will fit as they
should and according to your drawing.
Whether your cake will be flat or three-dimensional, make changes to your
design before you start decorating. Trust me: You don’t want to be midway
through decorating and realize that the cake is bigger (or smaller) than
you expected, causing your decorations to look askew, awry, or altogether
misplaced.
Sketching
If you opt to do a freehand illustration on the cake, use a bamboo skewer
to sketch out the design or artwork that you’ll fill in later with piped stars,
smooth frosting, or some other material.
For the best sketching surface, level the cake, apply a crumb coat of frosting,
and refrigerate to seal. Frost the cake and refrigerate it again before you
start sketching. It’s much easier to carve a sketch into refrigerated frosting
because it firms up. If you mess up your sketch, just frost the cake again,
refrigerate it, and then have another go at it. (Check out Chapter 8 for tips
on smooth frosting techniques.)
88
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

Tracing
Tracing a design on your cake is a relatively easy way to decorate with a one-
dimensional design. Just cut out the shape or picture of the object you want
to have on your cake, lay it on the frosted and refrigerated cake, and trace
around it with a bamboo skewer.
If tracing around a paper cutout proves too cumbersome, use the skewer or a
toothpick to poke holes around (or even through) the cutout. You can get as
detailed as you want by poking holes all over the cake, following the lines and
nuances of the design. Tracing in this manner gives you a connect-the-dots
design that you can outline by piping over with a pastry bag outfitted with a
round tip.
Using templates
Templates are line art that you can blow up or reduce to fit the dimensions
of your cake. Follow the tracing process covered in the preceding section to
transfer the template design to the cake. Then fill in the template with piped
stars or beads, for example.
Templates usually come with color suggestions and tell you what frosting to
put where, but the choice really is up to you. I categorize templates more in
the free-rein arena of cake decorating because you get the outline but make
your own choices about how to complete it.
Following patterns
Patterns are a more regimented approach to cake decorating in that they
include suggested frosting colors and placement. Cake decorating patterns
usually involve a conventional shape or design or the licensed artwork of a
cartoon character. 
A pattern for an entire cake usually doesn’t come with a template that you
trace; rather, you draw the basic design by hand. If you select a specialty pan
in a specific shape, like a pineapple, a piano keyboard, or a cartoon character,
the pan’s packaging is likely to include a photo of the finished cake to show
suggested colors and outlines.
89
Chapter 7: Smoothing the Way for Decorating

Choosing Colors
Color is a key component of the cake design process. Putting together the
right contrasting and complementary colors makes your cake visually excit-
ing and appealing and makes your design pop. Unfortunately, no matter how
good your cake tastes, the wrong combination of colors can make your cake
distracting and uninviting.
Experimenting before proceeding
The key to great cake design colors is experimentation. Working with
colored frostings is like working with paints in that your options are unlim-
ited. Particularly if you don’t have a lot of experience with tinting frostings,
don’t be afraid to mix and mess around with colors as you coordinate your
design options. You may find colors that you never thought you’d like and 
fall in love with them when you see them paired with others.
If you mix up colored frosting for your cake and find that the colors just don’t
go well together after all or aren’t what you had in mind, start fresh. Make more
frosting and tint another batch, or try mixing a different shade. Just because
you make colored frosting doesn’t mean you have to use it!
Mixing just the right color
The advice and guidelines in this section apply to working with white frosting,
such as buttercream, stiff decorator frosting, or royal icing.
Food coloring gels take a lot of the guesswork out of mixing frosting colors
because they come in a variety of shades. The color should be listed and pic-
tured on the squeeze bottle or paste vial of the color, but don’t just assume
that you’ll end up with that color exactly. Test it first. For example, if your but-
tercream isn’t bright white, the resulting hue may be darker than the color on
the bottle. Or you may be unable to find the shade of avocado, tangerine, or
coral that you need in a tint, so it may be up to you to create it yourself.
Here’s some general advice to follow as you mix colored frostings:
 Use just a little bit of coloring gel or paste at a time as you’re coloring
your frosting. You can always add more, but you can’t take it back after
it’s mixed in!
 If you need quite a bit of black frosting, consider adding a black tint
to chocolate frosting instead of white frosting. Because you start with 
a dark base color, you end up using much less black coloring gel.
90
Part II: Preparing the Canvas of Cake 

 Colored frosting darkens and the color gets richer after it’s mixed, so
wait an hour before using it on your cake. The color you see when you
first mix a tint with frosting may not be the final color, so make sure that
it’s the hue you had in mind before you apply it to your cake.
 To make frosting a touch lighter in color, add some white food coloring
gel. To make frosting a little darker in color, add some black gel, but be
careful because a tiny bit of black gel goes a very, very long way.
Taking stock of colors
Now’s the time to pull out the color wheel you have in your cake decorating
kit. Understanding just a few rules about colors will help you mix just the
right color for your cake design.
Red, blue, and yellow are primary colors. They’re considered stand-alones
because they can’t be mixed or created from any other combination of 
colors . . . no matter how hard you try.
Combining primary colors in equal amounts produces secondary colors. For
instance, mixing yellow with blue produces green; red with yellow produces
orange; and blue with red produces violet. Taking things a step further, mixing
one primary with one secondary color yields a tertiary color. For example,
mixing yellow and green brings, you guessed it, yellow-green, comparable to
a chartreuse hue.
If you want to become better versed in the color arena, I suggest setting aside
time for a practice and experimentation session. Gather up a bottle each of
red, yellow, and blue food coloring gels, and mix up a few batches of butter-
cream frosting. With a color wheel nearby, combine colors to your heart’s
content. Have pen and paper handy so that you can record what your different
combinations yield, and use that information for coloring your future cake
designs.
Charting different shades
Food coloring gels come in a variety of colors and shades, and to make things
even easier for you, manufacturers also provide recommendations for creating
even more hues by combining their available colors. In the end, though, you
have to mix and decide for yourself, adding in a few drops here and there or
electing not to add in as much color to begin with. When you’re shopping for
food coloring gels, keep the following points in mind:
 If you’re striving for a vivid hue, check out the gels that have “Super” or
“Neon” as a prefix. They tend to offer deeper, richer tones.
 The name of a coloring gel may not always be what you expect. For
example, I’m partial to the color leaf green, but it’s really more of a kelly
green. If your design involves leaves on a tree and you want them to be
as realistic as possible, you may opt for forest green, pine green, or moss
coloring gels (or mix up a color on your own).
91
Chapter 7: Smoothing the Way for Decorating

Table 7-1 breaks down the combinations for a variety of colors. I developed
these color recipes by mixing many batches of frosting and colors, but mixing
colors isn’t an exact science. Brands of coloring gels differ slightly in the colors
they offer (even if the hues share the same name), so use the information in
this table as a jumping off point for your coloring endeavors, and then develop
your own tried-and-true combinations.

veryone’s familiar with the kid who decadently draws his finger through
some fluffy frosting, samples his stash, and then happily licks his lips.
(Or maybe you were once that kid!) If you do your job right, everyone who
sees your cakes, adults included, will wish they could act just like that kid.
The frosting on your cake is more than just a sweet covering — it’s the first
impression your cake eaters get of the creation they’re about to indulge in. In
this chapter, you find out how to pair a cake with the right frosting for the best
effect in both taste and appearance. You also get a handle on some simple frost-
ing recipes that work in an array of decorating situations. I explain how to
color frostings and how to frost your cake just so for a clean space on which
to create your masterpiece. If you’re interested in a simpler design, I cover
your options for texturing your frosting, too.
Stirring Through the Rules for Frosting
For any cake, frosting presents two challenges:
 It has to win your cake eaters over with its taste.
 It has to be smooth, spreadable, and flexible enough to allow you to pipe
and otherwise create decorations for the cake.
With those goals in mind, take care in preparing your frostings to perfection.
Pay particular attention to the following:
 Sifting: Sift your dry ingredients, especially confectioner’s sugar, when
the recipe calls for it. It may seem unnecessary, but if you don’t sift the
Recipes in 
This Chapter

 Cream Cheese Frosting
 Chocolate Ganache
 Milk Chocolate Frosting

sugar, you’ll end up with clumps (small and large) of sugar in your frosting
that detract from a smooth finish.
 Creaming: Solids like cream cheese and butter should be thoroughly
creamed (but not overmixed). Clumps of these solid ingredients make
for a sloppy frosting appearance, and they also can wreak havoc with
your pastry bag, leaving the frosting stuck in the tip rather than flowing
onto your cake.
Some recipes in this chapter refer to using a mixer’s paddle attachment.
Using a paddle rather than a whisk attachment makes creaming butter,
cream cheese, or shortening a faster and easier proposition.
 Working with clean equipment: Take care to use clean, grease-free
bowls and attachments for mixing frosting. If you have to use the same
bowl that you mixed your cake in, wash it with hot, soapy water, and 
dry it thoroughly before preparing your frosting. The same goes for 
your whisk or paddle. When your equipment isn’t clean, you run the
risk of introducing unwanted flavors into your frosting or messing up 
the mixing with bits of cake batter.
Matching up Frostings and Cakes
Party guests and cake eaters appreciate variety, so don’t feel like you always
have to pair chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and white cake with white
frosting. Those combinations are appropriate for some events, but after you
have some frosting basics down, you can be inventive, creative, and experi-
ment a bit with cake and frosting combinations.
Don’t lose control of your taste combinations. Some flavors are great on their
own but not so great together; this is particularly true with strong-flavored
cakes and frostings. For instance, orange-flavored frosting on a peanut butter
cake may not go over so well with most cake eaters.
96
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
Frosting to the rescue
In medieval times, wedding guests brought
small cakes that were stacked on a table, and
the bride and groom had to try and kiss over all
the stack of cakes. Seeking to avoid a messy,
mushy ruckus, a young baker decided to put all
the cakes together and cover them with frost-
ing, paving a sweet way for the concept of
tiered wedding cakes.

Before you go to all the work to bake and decorate a cake, taste your cake
and frosting combination for yourself. Your skills and success depend on
sampling, practicing, and being excessively familiar with the taste and mouth
feel of frostings such that you can match them up appropriately with the
right kind of cake. So, indulge! Getting a handle on the tastes and consisten-
cies of your frostings will bring you greater success in your cake decorating.
The possibilities for cake and frosting pairings are limitless! However, if
you’re not into experimentation, think about flavor combinations that you
like in candy bars, ice cream flavors, or sundaes. These favorites will help
you determine what cake and frosting flavors work well together.
The most common pairings (and the safest ones for big crowds) are
 Chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting
 Yellow cake with chocolate or vanilla buttercream frosting
 White cake with vanilla buttercream frosting
 Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting
Although there are no hard and fast rules for combinations, keep your answers
to these questions in mind when making a cake and frosting pairing:
 Have you tasted this combination before (in a cake, candy bar, or other
confection)?
 Do these flavors “get along,” or will one overpower the other one?
Mixing Frostings
The frosting recipes in this section are basic ones that you can tint, flavor,
or leave alone for an equally great taste and appearance. All are good for
piping designs (covered in Chapter 11) or dressing up with edible or 
nonedible decorations.
Whichever frosting you choose to make for your confection, work toward a
spreadable consistency. The frosting should be thick enough to hold a piped
shape but thin enough to pipe with just gentle pressure on the pastry bag.
A little frosting doesn’t go a long way, so you should always be prepared to
make another batch of frosting in case you start decorating and find you’re
running short. You never want a cake to look — or taste — like you skimped
on the frosting.
97
Chapter 8: Whipping Up Frostings

Following you’ll find some suggested guidelines for frosting and its basic
equivalencies for some popular cake sizes.
 2 cups is enough to fill and frost two 9-inch rounds
 2 cups is enough to frost the tops of 24 cupcakes
 3 cups is enough to fill and frost two 10-inch squares
 21⁄2 cups is enough to frost the top and sides of one 9-x-13-inch rectangle

Buttercream Frosting
The most versatile of the lot, buttercream frosting is sure to be an essential component
of your frosting repertoire. It spreads and pipes wonderfully, and because of its lustrous,
white appearance, you can tint it to exactly the color you want. As if that weren’t enough,
this recipe requires no cooking!
Tools: Electric mixer, paddle attachment
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 3⁄4 cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted
1⁄4 cup milk
1 In a large bowl, beat the butter and vanilla on medium speed for about 30 seconds.
2 Gradually add half the sugar, beating well.
3 Beat in the milk, and then add the remaining sugar. Continue beating until the frosting is
smooth and creamy and reaches the desired consistency.
Tip: If the frosting is too thick, add milk in 1 teaspoon increments, beating each addition
well, until it reaches the desired consistency.
Vary It!: For chocolate buttercream, beat in 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder in
Step 1. For almond buttercream, substitute 1 teaspoon almond extract for the vanilla. For
orange buttercream, substitute 1⁄2 teaspoon orange extract for the vanilla.

99
Chapter 8: Whipping Up Frostings
Stiff Decorator Frosting
If you have a lot of ground to cover decorating-wise on your cake, or if the intricacy of
the design will require time and patience, this frosting is an excellent choice because it
holds its shape for a long time, without hardening immediately, allowing you the latitude
to futz with the decorating without it “melting.” 
Tools: Electric mixer, paddle attachment
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
7 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
3⁄4 cup all-vegetable shortening
1⁄3 cup whole milk
1⁄4 teaspoon almond extract
1 Combine the sugar and shortening in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on low speed
until the ingredients start to come together. Beat in the almond extract.
2 Gradually add the whole milk as you increase the mixing speed until the frosting is
smooth and creamy. If necessary, beat in a few more drops of milk until you reach the
desired consistency, which should be holding firm but pliable peaks.

Cream Cheese Frosting
This frosting pairs exceptionally well with a host of cakes, including the Best Carrot
Cake Ever (Chapter 6), Red Velvet Cake (Chapter 17), Piña Colada Cake (Chapter 14),
and Key Lime Cake (Chapter 15) . With a consistency and color similar to buttercream,
it’s also an ideal frosting for piping. Note: For optimal flavor and texture, don’t use
reduced fat cream cheese or Neufchatel cheese in this recipe.
Tools: Electric mixer, paddle attachment
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
8-ounce package cream cheese, softened
1⁄2 cup unsalted butter, softened
3 3⁄4 cup confectioner’s sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 In a large bowl, cream the butter and cream cheese on medium speed until combined
and fluffy.
2 Set the mixer on low speed, and add the confectioner’s sugar to the creamed mixture
in batches. After all the sugar is incorporated, increase to medium speed to thoroughly
mix the ingredients.
3 Add the vanilla, and continue beating until combined.
Tip: If the frosting doesn’t completely combine in your mixer, scrape down sides of the
bowl with a rubber spatula and continue beating.
Vary It: For a peppermint cream cheese frosting, substitute 1⁄2 teaspoon peppermint flavor-
ing for the vanilla. For a lemon cream cheese frosting, substitute 1⁄2 teaspoon lemon 
flavoring for the vanilla.

Chocolate Ganache
This simple recipe for a rich, dense, and delicious chocolate frosting speeds up the
process with an assist from your microwave. You can’t tint ganache, but its deep brown
color is more than delightful.
Tools: 2-quart glass measuring cup
Preparation time: 5 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 3 cups
3 cups (18 ounces) semisweet chocolate
chips
11⁄2 cups heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 In the glass measuring cup, combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream. Microwave
on high for 11⁄2 minutes, or until the chips melt. Stir the mixture with a rubber spatula
until smooth and evenly combined; no chunks of chocolate should remain.
2 Add the butter to the warm chocolate mixture, and stir until melted. (The butter gives
the ganache a glossy sheen.)
3 Cover the measuring cup with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 1 hour, until the
ganache holds its shape such that it’s thick enough that you could frost a cake with it.
You can test it by spooning out a bit to see how it stands up on a spoon, or tilt the mea-
suring cup back to make sure the ganache doesn’t jiggle. Stir the ganache again when
you’re ready to frost the cake.
Tip: To pipe ganache, divide it up before you refrigerate it. If it gets too stiff in the refrigera-
tor, put it in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of hot water, and stir it until it warms up
enough to pipe.

Milk Chocolate Frosting
This versatile frosting adds a nice (and decadent) depth to the Cocoa Chocolate Cake
(Chapter 6) and White Chocolate Cake (Chapter 17), and it amps up the flavor as a 
filling for the Delicious Yellow Cake (Chapter 6) and A Most Excellent White Cake
(Chapter 6). Whatever cake you decide to pair it with, know that it’s always a hit with
candy bar connosseurs. 
Tools: Electric mixer, paddle attachment
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups
1⁄2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1⁄4 cup sifted unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter until fluffy.
2 Add the cocoa powder and sugar, and beat on medium speed to combine.
3 Gradually add in the whipping cream, beating until the frosting is creamy. If necessary,
beat in additional cream one drop at a time until the frosting reaches the desired consis-
tency to be perfectly spreadable.
Tinting Frostings
Part of the beauty of frostings such as buttercream and cream cheese is their
ability to take on strikingly beautiful colors that enhance your decorating
adventure.
To tint frosting, you need to pick up some food coloring paste or gels from
your local craft store or a cake decorating supply house. The colors widely
available on grocery store shelves don’t produce the brilliant, deep hues
that pastes or gels do. In addition, gels and pastes come in an amazing vari-
ety of colors, so you may be able to buy a more unusual color like lavender,
chartreuse, aqua, or magenta rather than mix it up yourself.
In tinting frosting, the key is to add just a little coloring at a time. If you dump
in a whole bunch at once, you have no recourse in correcting the color if it’s
too deep, too bright, or just plain wrong.
I’ve found that the best tool for coloring is a toothpick. Follow these steps for
tinting:

1. Insert the toothpick into the gel, and scoop out a bit of coloring.
2. Shake a drop or two of coloring into the frosting, and stir it in with a
spoon, evenly distributing the shade. Evaluate the result and decide
whether or not you need to add more coloring.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until you have the color you want.
4. Stir your frosting completely so that you don’t have white streaks
zooming through your perfectly tinted frosting.
If you’re using a squeeze gel container of coloring, you can squeeze a few
drops into the frosting. However, until you’re comfortable with the coloring
process, stick with the toothpick method. You’ll have more control over your
color’s outcome that way.
The longer the frosting sits, the deeper the hue becomes, so don’t be sur-
prised when your perfect shade of leaf green gets a little dark. Instead, com-
pensate for the change during the coloring process by going a little easy on
the green gel.
Don’t flavor your frosting and then throw off your cake eaters with a different
color. For example, a lemon-flavored frosting should be yellow, not pink, just as
an orange-flavored one should be orange and not green. People expect certain
colors to taste a certain way, and mixing up colors and flavors distracts them
from taking in the full beauty and impressiveness of your brilliant creation!
Frosting with Finesse
Frosting a cake is more than just slapping on a layer of sweet confection and
calling it a day. Frosting the right way requires time, tools, and attention to
detail. The most important tools you should have on hand are different sized
icing spatulas, a pastry brush, and a decorating turntable. Check out Chapter 2
for more information on these.
When you have your plain or colored frosting ready to apply to your cake,
check its consistency. If the frosting is too thick, you’ll tear the cake as you
attempt to spread the frosting. To thin out your frosting, return it to the mixer
and add some milk (a teaspoon at a time) until it’s the right, spreadable consis-
tency. If the frosting is too thin, it will run or puddle, leaving you with incom-
plete and unattractive coverage. If it was once the right consistency, it probably
has just gotten too warm, so put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to allow
it to thicken.
Keep your frosting from crusting and drying out by covering the bowl with a
damp paper towel until you’re ready to frost. If you won’t be using the frosting
soon, cover the bowl with an airtight lid and place in the refrigerator.
103
Chapter 8: Whipping Up Frostings

Follow these steps, which are illustrated in Figure 8-1, to frost a two-layer, 
9-inch round cake. These guidelines are easily adaptable to other cake sizes:
1. Gather all the tools you’ll need to frost: wax paper, offset icing spatu-
la, frosting knife, silicone brush, and (preferably) a pedestal that has 
a rotating round top.
2. Place four 2-x-8-inch strips of wax paper around the board your cake
will sit on for presentation. Place the first layer of the leveled cake on
the board, and then put the board on the pedestal.
3. With the silicone brush, sweep all excess crumbs off your cake layer.
4. Use the frosting knife to scoop about 1⁄2 cup of frosting onto the cake
layer. With the offset icing spatula, spread the frosting evenly and
smoothly on the top of the cake only. The initial crumb coat (which I
discuss a little later) will be a scant, thin layer of frosting; think of it as
providing a “protective seal” for your cake. The subsequent coat will
be quite thicker, about 1⁄4-inch to 3⁄8-inch thick.
A frosting knife is a specialty tool with a generous blade that allows you
to heap frosting onto your cake layers easily. You can also use a rubber
spatula to scoop frosting out onto your cake.
The way to use an icing spatula depends on what’s best for you. Spreading
icing from the front edge of the spatula may be more comfortable than
holding the back edge, so practice to see which method you prefer.
5. Place the second cake layer — flat side up — on top of the first. 
Again, sweep any excess crumbs off the top and sides of cake.
6. Use the frosting knife to scoop 1⁄2 cup of frosting on top of the cake,
and use the offset spatula to spread it out in even strokes to be a thin
seal for the crumb coat, and a 1⁄4 to 3⁄8-inch thickness for the second
coat. Use excess frosting from the top of the cake to frost the sides of
the cake, rotating the pedestal as you use the flat edge of the spatula
for a smooth, even finish. Add more frosting from the bowl as neces-
sary to cover the sides with a thin layer of frosting.
This first layer of frosting is the crumb coat (which I explain in the next
section). The cake needs to be refrigerated for at least 1 hour before you
apply the final frosting coat.
7. For the final coat of frosting on the cake’s top and sides, repeat Step 6
but with a thicker layer of frosting. Keep adding and subtracting frost-
ing until you have the smooth, finished look that you desire.
Taking care to crumb coat
Have you ever noticed that some cakes have bits of crumbs in the frosting?
Unless you’re going for the speckled look, applying a crumb coat to your cake
104
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

will stop those crumbs in their tracks. The thin layer of frosting provides 
protection to keep crumbs out of your decorations and the frosting layer
that your partygoers see. This one simple step ensures professional-looking
results for your frosted cake. Follow these steps to crumb coat your cake:
1. After your cake has cooled completely, level it and brush off any
excess crumbs.
2. Using a wide icing spatula, spread a thin layer of frosting over the top
and all sides of the cake.
3. Refrigerate the cake for a least 1 hour.
Chilling the cake allows the frosting to crust and seal in any crumbs that
may still be left on your prepared cake.
Thanks to the crumb coat, when you apply the second coat of frosting to the
cake, you don’t have to worry about any crumbs mixing in with the frosting.
You’re guaranteed to get a clean, polished presentation.
Smoothing out the frosting
Some cake designs benefit from a textured coat of frosting, which I discuss 
in the next section. But many bakers and cake decorators crave the smooth
look that wedding and other elaborate cakes tend to sport.
Figure 8-1:
Frosting 
a cake.
105
Chapter 8: Whipping Up Frostings

Make the process of frosting your cake a bit easier by setting your cake board
on a sturdy surface. If necessary, place it on damp kitchen towels to keep it
from shifting as you work. If you’re frosting a round cake, consider putting it
on a turntable that you can spin as you frost.
You have a few options to go about getting a smooth coat of frosting on your
cake.
 Use an icing spatula. Perhaps you grew up watching a parent or grand-
mother frost cakes using a butter knife. That was fine then, but for best
results, bring in an icing spatula! The spatula flattens out the frosting
and creates sharp edges, particularly at the corners of a square or rec-
tangular cake.
Put some frosting on your cake and then slide the spatula’s flat edge
across the top of the cake in an even, continuous motion. Then run the
spatula over each side of the cake, working your way around.
 Use a piece of parchment paper or a paper towel. Press the paper onto
the frosting and then lift it off, or carefully pull it across the surface of
the cake. Work on the top of the cake first, and then the sides.
 Use the straight edge of a ruler or strip of stiff, clean cardboard or
poster board. Draw the straight edge across the cake, collecting the
excess frosting and leaving a smooth surface in your wake. Perform
this method on the top of the cake first, then repeat on the sides.
If you try these methods and still don’t achieve the smooth results you want,
refrigerate your cake to let the frosting harden a bit. Then try using the icing
spatula again or a bench scraper to even out the frosting.
Going the Textured Route
Cake decorators love to use embellishments, but you may find that the most
appropriate cake decoration for an event, gathering, or party is a simple tex-
tured frosting. With just a few simple tools — a spoon, an icing spatula, and
a decorator’s comb — you can create a number of different textures in your
frosting.
Ridges
For this texture, drag a decorator’s comb through the cake’s frosting, creating
evenly spaced lines that run vertically or horizontally across the top of the
cake. Create the same effect on all four sides of a square or rectangular cake.
106
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

In using a decorator’s comb, I usually position it at a 45-degree angle.
However, you can produce more distinct lines by holding the comb perpen-
dicular (at a 90-degree angle) to the cake.
To create the ridge effect, you have a choice among several kinds of combs,
with different spaced-teeth and also line effects that include waves, shallow-
and-deep lines, alternating widths, and thick grooves. Take advantage of that
variety for the look and impression you’re trying to achieve.
This texture looks particularly good on a round cake. Combing the side of
the cake as well as the top creates a dramatic look because the lines circle
the cake.
Hobnails
For this look, make sure that you spread a lot of fluffy frosting on the top and
all sides of your cake. Press the back of a soup spoon into the frosting and
then give the spoon a twist to swirl the frosting, and lift the spoon off the
cake (see Figure 8-2).
Zigzags
To create a zigzag texture, use your decorator’s comb or a fork to make rows
of Ws. First draw the comb down to the right, and then draw it up to the right
(see Figure 8-2). Repeat the process across the cake’s surface and sides.
Figure 8-2:
Textured
effects.
107
Chapter 8: Whipping Up Frostings

Swirls
For a whimsically swirly appearance (see Figure 8-2), pull the decorator’s
comb through the frosting in a wave-like motion. Or for more texture, draw 
an icing spatula through the frosting in a series of S shapes all over the cake.
Petals
This look takes the hobnail a step further. With a soup spoon, gently press
the back of the spoon into the frosting, and then lift up the spoon in an arc,
causing the impression to look like a tear-shaped flower petal.

n addition to using frostings (which I cover in

Sweetening Up Your Cake with Icing
Like frostings, icings offer a wealth of taste and flavor options. But unlike
frostings, which are generally thicker in content, taste, and structure, icings
are thinner and often pourable (although you can also spread many icings,
too). Over time, they harden up.
Sugar is the major component of icing (and, actually, glazes too; see the sec-
tion “Putting the Shine on with Glazes” later in this chapter), and the two
main types of icing are
 Confectioners’ sugar icing: This icing basically consists of confectioners’
sugar (also referred to as powdered sugar) and some type of liquid. You
can thin it out with additional liquid and flavorings in order to make it
easier to pour or spoon over a cake for a quick finish.
 Royal icing: You make this icing with confectioners’ sugar and egg
whites, and its consistency is ideal for piping (see Chapter 11).
Be mindful that — as with frostings — you want the icing to complement the
taste of your cake, not overpower it. So although a chocolate icing would be
delicious on a chocolate or cinnamon cake, I wouldn’t put it on a lemon or
rhubarb one. Instead, I’d decorate those cakes with a simple confectioners’
sugar icing, which goes with just about any flavor you can think of.
With most of the icing recipes in this chapter, don’t skip the step of sifting
confectioners’ sugar. If you don’t sift, you’re likely to end up with little clumps
of powdered sugar on the top of your cake. The clumps are harmless, but
they’re unsightly and detract from a cake’s polished presence.
Starting with basic confectioners’
sugar icing
Basic confectioners’ sugar icing consists of confectioners’ sugar (big surprise)
and some kind of liquid or liquid flavoring. The beauty of these simple icings
is that you don’t need a mixer to make them; you can whisk them up by hand.
Consistency is an important concern with basic confectioners’ sugar icing. If
it’s too thick, you have a gloppy mess on your cake. If the icing’s too thin, it
slides right down the cake and forms an icing river at the base.
Icing a cake with this type of icing is relatively simple in that you have two
basic options:
110
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

 Drizzling: With this technique, you partially cover the cake with an 
icing design; you can decorate the cake with a striped or circular effect,
for example. To drizzle basic powdered sugar icing on your cake, follow
these steps:
1. For easy clean-up, place waxed paper on your counter or work
surface.
2. Set a wire rack on the waxed paper, and place the cake to be
iced on the rack.
Alternately, you can place the cake directly on a cake plate: First
lay strips of wax paper on the plate where the cake will sit, and
then place the cake on top. You’ll remove the paper strips after
you’ve finished drizzling.
3. Dip a large spoon, a ball whisk, or even a fork (different tools
give you different looks) into the icing, hold it approximately 1
inch above the cake, and move the utensil in a circular or rec-
tangular direction (depending on your cake’s shape), letting the
icing drizzle across the cake (and, if you like, over the sides).
Pay attention to how the icing lays on the cake as you drizzle. If
you find that it’s pooling at the bottom of your cake, the icing is
too thin and you need to whisk in more (sifted) confectioners’
sugar to thicken it.
4. If your cake’s not already on a cake plate or serving platter, use
a large spatula to move the cake from the wire rack to the serving
plate.
 Pouring: With this technique, you cover the cake completely with icing.
For a quick covering of icing, follow these steps, which are illustrated in
Figure 9-1:
1. Place the icing in a container that has a spout, like a large glass
measuring cup.
2. Place wax paper on your counter or work surface. Set a wire
rack on the wax paper, and place the cake to be iced on the rack.
3. Pour the icing over the cake to cover, working for even coverage.
For a rectangular cake, pour the icing in rows. For cakes in other
shapes, pour in a circular fashion.
4. Carefully tip the wire rack back and forth to let excess icing drip
off, ensuring smooth, even coverage. Run a spatula around the
sides of the cake for a smooth finish.
5. Use a large spatula to move the cake from the wire rack to its
serving platter or cake plate.
111
Chapter 9: Dusting and Glazing: It’s Icing on the Cake

Although basic confectioners’ sugar icings aren’t ideal for piping because of
their thinness, you can tint them with colors for a fun effect. (An icing that is
a good candidate for piping is royal icing, which I cover in the next section.)

Simple Confectioners’ Sugar Icing
You’ll find yourself calling on this versatile recipe again and again. It’s a particularly
tasty way to dress up a pound cake! This icing is best used for drizzling over cakes.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
2 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons plus 4 teaspoons whole milk
(use more as needed)
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon milk.
2 Whisk in the additional milk 1 teaspoon at a time until the icing is of drizzling consis-
tency (that is, it’s lustrous and opaque and coats the back of a spoon).
Vary It! Give this icing a citrus twist by substituting 1⁄4 teaspoon lemon extract or 1⁄2 teaspoon
orange extract for the vanilla. For a nutty, almond-flavored icing, substitute 1⁄4 teaspoon
almond extract for the vanilla.
A fun way to jazz up the basic vanilla confectioners’ sugar icing is to create
a tie-dye effect on your cake. Tweens and teens especially love the groovy
colors and design. The great thing about this technique is that you can’t
mess it up, I promise! Just let your creativity take over. (This tie-dye effect
looks particularly great on the Rich Pound Cake recipe in Chapter 6.) Follow
these steps to give your cake a tie-dye look:
1. Gather a variety of food coloring gels.
I like to use green, blue, pink, green, and orange for this decorating 
technique.
2. Divide the confectioners’ sugar icing into small bowls — one for each
color you’re using.
3. Add each coloring gel to its own bowl of icing until you achieve the
desired color. Start with just a bit of the gel — a little goes a long way —
and add more as needed.
4. Use a teaspoon to drizzle each icing color separately around the top 
of the cooled cake, letting them run together to produce the tie-dye
effect.
You can also draw the colors into each other using the tip of a bamboo
skewer.

Simple Chocolate 
Confectioners’ Sugar Icing
To please chocolate lovers in a jiffy, drizzle this icing over a one-layer Cocoa Chocolate
Cake (refer to Chapter 6) or Lori’s Chocolatey Chippity Cake (refer to Chapter 19).
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1⁄2 cup
1 cup sifted confectioners’ sugar
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons whole milk
(use more as needed)
1⁄8 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1⁄2 cup fresh-squeezed tangerine juice
6 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together all the ingredients.
2 Dip the top of each cupcake into the icing, and then set it upright on a wire rack until
the icing hardens.
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, cocoa powder, and 1 tablespoon of milk.
2 Whisk in the additional milk 1 teaspoon at a time until the icing is of drizzling consis-
tency (that is, it’s lustrous, and coats the back of a spoon).
Sunshine Cupcake Icing
With this very easy, citrus-flavored icing, you can quickly decorate a multitude of
white or yellow cupcakes. After the dipping part, top each one with a candied orange
or lemon peel to indicate the icing flavor, or add a beach-themed cupcake pick for 
decoration.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 21⁄4 cups (enough to top 4 dozen cupcakes)

Getting versatile with royal icing
One of the most popular icings is royal icing. Typically made with confection-
ers’ sugar and egg whites, royal icing is a cake decorating favorite because it
can be used in a variety of applications.
Royal icing differs from basic confectioners’ sugar icing (see the preceding
section) in that it’s often used in piping decorations. When prepared cor-
rectly, royal icing hardens in such a way that allows you either to keep it as
is on your cake or to use other forms and colors to embellish a design made
with it. You can even use royal icing to cover the board that a cake sits on as
a way to surround the cake with a smooth, white base.
How you want to use royal icing determines its consistency. You use a thicker
royal icing to coat a cake; you use a slightly thinner version for intricate letter-
ing or details.
For any task, if the royal icing’s not the right consistency, your cake, decora-
tions, or both, won’t look right. Like basic confectioners’ sugar icing, if your
royal icing is too thick, add more liquid; if it’s too thin, add more sugar. When
working with royal icing, it’s important to cover what you’re not using at the
moment with a damp cloth or paper towel to ensure that it doesn’t dry up
and crust over.
For decorating, royal icing tints beautifully because the base color is such a
bright white. Use food coloring paste or gel to achieve the desired color (you
may need to use more than you would to color frosting).
One of royal icing’s prime components is egg whites, but you shouldn’t use
raw egg whites to make the icing. Although raw eggs yield the same results 
in the following recipes, they may cause food poisoning and shouldn’t be 
consumed by pregnant women, young children, or the elderly. Instead, use
meringue powder or pasteurized egg whites. (I prefer pasteurized egg whites
because you don’t have to mix anything, whereas meringue powder must be
mixed with water.)
115

Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
Royal Icing
I like to use this icing for drawing, filling in, and accenting designs and forms on cakes.
(It also works well for decorating cookies.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
4 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
3⁄4 cup pasteurized egg whites
1 tablespoon fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1 In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients.
2 Beat the mixture with a stand or a hand-mixer until the icing holds its shape and isn’t
runny. If it’s too thin for piping, add more sugar 1 tablespoon at a time and continue
mixing until it reaches the desired consistency.
Tip: To tint the icing several different colors, pour the icing into separate bowls, and then
add and adjust coloring gels with a toothpick or by squeezing a few drops of color at a time
into the icing.
Giving Fondant a Try
You may not know what fondant is, but chances are you’ve seen it on cakes or
sweet treats at some point. Fondant is an icing comprised of confectioners’
sugar and gelatin (among other ingredients). In its most common incarnation
for cakes, fondant is kneaded into the form of soft dough and rolled out to
form a smooth covering that seals in freshness and adds a perfect-looking,
smooth, hard coating to cakes. However, it’s something of a multiutility
player in the world of cake decorating because it can take many forms: rolled
or poured, for coverings, trims, and even shapes, figures, and a variety of
edible decorations. And no matter how you plan to use it, the natural white
color of fondant not only looks great as is but also tints beautifully.
Fondant is often preferred for cakes appearing at outdoor events because
it tends to hold up in hot or humid conditions. However, as with all cake cre-
ations, don’t plan on keeping your fondant-covered cake out for a long time in
the heat.

Working with rolled fondant
In its rolled form, fondant is like a chewy, creamy sugar paste. Most likely
you’ve seen it as that smooth-as-silk covering on a wedding cake. This kind 
of fondant’s dough-like consistency allows you to roll it out, drape it over 
the cake’s surface, and form it around the cake. As such, it gives the cake a
finished, polished look.
I include a recipe for rolled fondant in this section, but you have easier and
less time-consuming options at your disposal. Many baking supply stores
(and even national craft store chains) offer ready-to-use fondant as well as
fondant mix. In tackling the all-encompassing responsibilities of cake decorat-
ing (think planning, designing, baking, and crafting decorations), mess-free,
ready-made fondant gives you at least a little breathing space time-wise. And
although you sacrifice the “completely homemade” moniker by taking a fon-
dant shortcut, you don’t sacrifice taste or texture.
117
Chapter 9: Dusting and Glazing: It’s Icing on the Cake
Rolled Fondant
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1 pound
1⁄4-ounce package unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoons cold water
1⁄2 cup corn syrup
1 tablespoon glycerin
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
1 teaspoon clear pure vanilla extract
8 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1 In a medium bowl, stir together the gelatin and the cold water; let the mixture stand
until it thickens. Then place the gelatin mixture in the top part of a double boiler and
heat it over medium heat, stirring continuously until the gelatin is dissolved.
2 Add the corn syrup and glycerin to the gelatin mixture, and mix well. Stir in the short-
ening, and just before it’s completely melted, remove the mixture from the heat and stir
in the vanilla. Let the mixture cool until it’s lukewarm (about 90 degrees F on a candy
thermometer).
3 Place 4 cups of confectioners’ sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, place all
the lukewarm gelatin mixture in the well, and then use a wooden spoon to draw the
sugar from the edges into the liquid.
4 Mix in some of the remaining sugar 1⁄2 cup at a time until the stickiness disappears.
5 Transfer the fondant from the bowl to your work surface, and knead in the remaining
confectioners’ sugar. Knead until the fondant is smooth, pliable, and doesn’t stick to
your hands. (If it’s too soft, add more sugar. If it’s too stiff, add water one drop at a time.)

6 Use the fondant immediately, or store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container. When
you’re ready to use it, bring it to room temperature, and knead it until it’s soft again.
Tip: If you don’t have a double boiler, you can make your own: Fill a heavy, medium-sized
saucepan with water about 1⁄3 of the way up the sides of the pan. Bring the water to a boil,
and set a medium, heat-proof bowl snugly on the top of the saucepan.
Preparing a cake for a fondant cover
Before being covered in rolled fondant, a cake typically is frosted with butter-
cream or royal icing. The buttercream or royal icing acts as glue for the fondant
to neatly stick onto the cake. (You can find out more about buttercream —
including a recipe — in Chapter 8. A Royal Icing recipe appears in the section
“Getting versatile with royal icing” earlier in this chapter.)
For a nice sticky surface for rolled fondant to adhere to, you also can cover
the cake in a glaze first. For more on glazes and glaze recipes, see the section
“Putting the Shine on with Glazes” later in this chapter.
Placing fondant on a cake
Placing fondant on your cake isn’t too tricky a proposition with an able assist
from a rolling pin. You also need an offset spatula, a pizza wheel cutter, and
cake smoothers, which are handy, flat-handled plastic squares that you use
to flatten the fondant. When you have your tools assembled and your cake is
ready and waiting (see the preceding section), follow these steps, which you
can see in Figure 9-2, to cover the cake:
1. Sprinkle cornstarch on your work surface, and roll the fondant to a
thickness of 1⁄4 inch and a circle that’s slightly bigger than the size
needed to completely cover the top and sides of your cake.
2. Gently roll the fondant onto your rolling pin. Place the fondant-rolled
pin at one edge of your cake, letting the fondant drape down that side
of the cake. Roll the pin away from the edge where you started so that
the fondant rolls off your pin and onto the cake top.
The fondant should cover the top and drape the sides of your cake.
3. Using your hands, gently press the fondant into the sides of the cake.
You should have excess fondant all around the base of your cake.
118

4. Use a pizza wheel cutter to trim the excess fondant from the base of
the cake. With the back edge of an icing spatula, flatten the fondant
into the base all around the cake.
5. Use a cake smoother to gently press the top and sides of the cake for a
finished, flat effect.
Pouring fondant
Poured fondant is — as its name suggests — fondant that you pour over your
cake for a hard, shiny, smooth coating. Poured fondant is most commonly
used on petit fours, those dainty, bite-sized and usually elaborately decorated
cakes you often see at wedding receptions and baby showers.
As with rolled fondant, you can find more-than-adequate premade possibili-
ties when it comes to poured fondant. Options include powdered fondant mix
that you add ingredients to and heat over a double boiler to reach the right
pourable consistency and fondant that you simply have to melt.

Poured Fondant
You can use this poured fondant to cover petit fours or even to cover an entire cake.
This is one of two recipes for swift, pourable fondant; the other is 2EZ Petit Fours Quick
Fondant. Which one you use is a matter of your preference for taste and appearance.
This fondant imparts a sweet, vanilla flavor and creates a thicker fondant shell on the
confection.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
6 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1⁄2 cup water
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 teaspoon clear pure vanilla extract
1 Combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy saucepan.
2 Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches a temperature of 110
degrees F on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat and pour over your cake.
If you’re taking on icing small cakes, such as petit fours, follow these steps to
minimize the mess and make the most efficient use of your poured fondant:
1. Set the petit four on a multitined chocolate fork or angel food cake
slicer. Hold the fork or slicer in one hand over a bowl of warm poured
fondant.
2. With a large spoon in your other hand, spoon the fondant over the
petit four, covering the top and all sides. Spoon additional fondant
until the petit four is complete covered. As you work, let the excess
fondant drip back into the bowl.
3. Use the flat edge of a knife to slide the petit four off the fork or slicer
onto a cooling rack so that the fondant can harden completely.

Chapter 9: Dusting and Glazing: It’s Icing on the Cake
2EZ Petit Fours Quick Fondant
This recipe is very easy to double, triple, or even quadruple depending on how many
petit fours you need to decorate. Its almond flavor sets it apart from the Poured Fondant
in the preceding recipe.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
2 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1⁄2 teaspoon almond extract
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together all the ingredients until smooth.
2 Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and heat over low heat until warm, about 100
degrees F on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat.
3 If necessary, add hot water, drop by drop, as you stir the fondant until it reaches the
proper consistency (thick but pourable).
4 Place the saucepan containing the icing over another saucepan or bowl of hot water to
prevent it from thickening as you use it.
Tip: If the poured fondant starts to become gloppy and unmanageably thick, mix in a few
drops of a simple sugar syrup (1 cup of sugar dissolved in 1 cup of water).
As you keep your poured fondant warm while you use it, don’t leave it on
the stove to continue cooking and run the risk of burning. Keep the icing at
around 100 degrees F on a candy thermometer or it will thicken, crust-up, and
otherwise be too hard to work with.
Dusting for a Different Look
Dusting refers to lightly sprinkling an ingredient over your cake for a finished
look that doesn’t interfere with your cake’s flavor. Dusting can be done in a
jiffy, and it’s a sound choice for a cake that’s rich and dense on its own. Dusting
also is a great way to decorate cakes that you’re trying to keep on the lighter
side and may be serving only with some fresh fruit, for example.
In addition to being quick and easy, dusting allows you to create lots of differ-
ent designs on your cakes. For instance, stencils (that you buy or make) can
produce many pretty patterns — from scattered snowflakes and stars to rows
of clowns and ballerinas. Just think about the variety of cookie cutters out

there, and you get an idea of the various sizes and shapes you can festoon a
cake with.
Deciding what to dust with
With a couple of primary ingredients that you can probably find in your pantry,
you’re well on your way to executing some stunning cake-top creations in mere
minutes.
Confectioners’ sugar and cocoa
For dusting’s easiest incarnation, place confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder
in a sieve and shake it over the top of a cake for a beautiful sprinkling.
Before you start dusting, make sure that the top of your cake is dry 
(not in taste, but to the touch!). If you’ve just removed your cake from the
refrigerator or the top is otherwise too moist, the cake will absorb the sugar
or cocoa and you’ll be left with a blotted mess. So bring the cake to room
temperature before proceeding.
Items with different flavors and textures
The great thing about dusting is that you can use practically anything!
Ingredients such as sanding sugar, nonpareils (little chocolate discs covered
in sugar sprinkles), and even finely-crushed cookies and peppermints not
only look spectacular but also taste fantastic!
For these heartier dusting ingredients, you need to frost your cake with a medium
such as buttercream frosting (see Chapter 8) that the decorations can easily
adhere to. If you were to sprinkle jimmies or nonpareils on a dry cake, most of
them would slide right off and you’d be right back where you started!
Using stencils
Combining the dusting technique with stencils opens a world of creativity
for your cake decorating endeavors. Although stenciling looks best when
it’s done with confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder, design options abound.
Although you can use stencils in repetitive patterns, I’ve also used separate
ones with confectioners’ sugar to create a snowy winter scene and even a
performance of The Nutcracker! I’ve also used nonpareils in various colors to
fill in a rainbow stencil and placed blue and pink jimmies in different sizes of
circles for a child’s “Playing with Bubbles” party.
122
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

A stencil sits on top of your cake, so you may want to coat the underside of it
with a thin layer of vegetable shortening for ease in lifting it off after you’re
done dusting your design.
To use a stencil for dusting your cake top, follow these steps, which are illus-
trated in Figure 9-3:
1. If the shape of your stencil allows it, stick two small loops of masking
tape on the facing side of the stencil at opposite edges (like at the 
positions of 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock).
2. Gently set the stencil on the cake.
3. Put confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder in a sieve, and shake the
sieve over the open portions of the stencil, using a gentle tapping
motion with the heel of your hand for a light, controlled sprinkle.
4. When the open portions are completely dusted, gently lift the stencil
off by the handles you created with the masking tape, taking care to
hold the stencil level.
If you slant the stencil at all, you may wind up with sugar or cocoa in
unwanted spaces on your cake.
Creating your own stencils
You can find a variety of cake decorating stencils in baking supply stores and
even national craft store chains, but you also shouldn’t be shy about creating
your own. Children’s coloring books and clip art available on the Web and in
books both provide excellent images for homemade stencils.

123
Chapter 9: Dusting and Glazing: It’s Icing on the Cake

Using scissors or a razor blade knife, cleanly cut out any image you want to
use on your cake and cut out the open space that will be dusted. If you want
a sturdier stencil, just trace the image onto cardboard and cut it out again.
If you like an image but it’s too small or too large for your cake top, enlarge or
reduce it on a photocopier to the desired size. Cut it out of the paper, trace it
onto cardboard, and cut it out again to get your stencil.
Filling in cookie cutters
In addition to buying or making your own stencils, cookie cutters offer a vast
array of shapes, forms, and sizes that you can also use to dust designs on
your cake. You can use just one — like a dolphin or seashell shape — or
create a scene with several cookie cutters. For instance, you may group the
shapes of a Christmas tree, stockings, and a Santa Claus on the top of a holi-
day cake.
To use a cookie cutter as a stencil, simply lay it gently on the cake top, use a
sieve to dust on confectioners’ sugar or cocoa (or sprinkle another dusting
ingredient by hand, if you like) either in the open space or around the outside
of the cutter depending on the type of cutter you’re using and the design you
prefer. Carefully remove the cutter to reveal your design. If necessary, use your
fingers to gently pack in any jimmies or crushed candies that may have strayed
from the outline.
Putting the Shine on with Glazes
With their glossy sheen, glazes literally highlight the cake that you set on a
table. Besides their sweet taste, glazes actually add to a cake’s appearance,
giving the cake top or topping — such as sliced or whole fruits — a shiny,
glassine look. Glazes also seal in moisture and prevent any fruits on the top
of your cake from browning.
Typically, glazes consist of confectioners’ sugar, water, and such additions as
melted chocolate, citrus zest, extracts, or fruit juice. However, some glazes
are simply fruit jams melted over low heat. Whatever the ingredients, a glaze
tends to be more liquid than icing and has a perked-up flavor.
Unlike frosting or icing, most glazes aren’t intended to cover an entire cake.
The desired look is a glaze-covered cake top with drips of glaze down the
sides.
The glazes that I supply recipes for in this section pair nicely with sponge
cakes that soak up flavor as well as pound, butter, angel food, and plain
chocolate cakes. While I supply recommendations for glaze and cake flavor
124
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

combinations in each of the glaze recipes, keep in mind that Bundt-shaped
cakes are often ideal for glazes, which particularly flatter that shape and
make for an eye-catching confection.
To glaze your cake, follow these easy steps:
1. Set the cake on a cooling rack, and place the cooling rack over a
cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Conversely, you can set your cake on a wax paper–lined cake plate and
just remove the wax paper after you’re done glazing.
2. Use a spoon to heap a portion of the glaze onto your cake, and let the
excess drip down the sides. Continue spooning glaze over the entire
surface of the cake until the top is covered.
For thicker glazes, use a pastry brush to distribute the glaze more
evenly.
125
Chapter 9: Dusting and Glazing: It’s Icing on the Cake
Buttery Vanilla Glaze
Pour this glaze over your cake shortly after you remove the cake from the oven. You
want the cake to soak up the glaze while it’s still warm.
Preparation time: 12 minutes
Yield: 2 cups
1 cup granulated white sugar
1⁄2 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1⁄2 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 In a medium saucepan, heat the sugar, buttermilk, corn syrup, and butter over medium
heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a boil.
2 Boil for 2 minutes, stirring the mixture continuously.
3 Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the vanilla. Let the glaze cool a few minutes
before applying it to your warm cake.

126
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
Chocolate Glaze
This glaze is a sweet, shiny addition to any cake. And in my opinion, practically anything
tastes better with a smooth chocolate coating!
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
1⁄2 cup granulated white sugar
1⁄2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1⁄2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons light corn syrup
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and cocoa powder with a balloon whisk.
2 In a 4-cup glass measuring cup, combine the cream and corn syrup.
3 Add the sugar mixture gradually into the cream mixture, whisking until smooth. Add in
the butter, and stir to combine.
4 Microwave on high for 2 minutes until the mixture is completely smooth. Then stir in
the vanilla. Let the glaze cool for a few minutes before spooning onto the cake.
Mocha Glaze
I think coffee and chocolate make a delicious, unbeatable combination, and this glaze is
perfect for chocolate cakes, butter cakes, pound cakes, and — of course — coffee-flavored
cake. (The recipe for Coffee-Flavored Cake, which is a modified version of my Delicious
Yellow Cake, appears in Chapter 17.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
2⁄3 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
11⁄2 teaspoons instant espresso powder
12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped

1 In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream, corn syrup, and espresso
powder. Bring to a simmer (which should take about 2 minutes), and stir to make sure
the espresso powder dissolves.
2 Remove from the heat, and mix in the chocolate. Stir until smooth.
127
Chapter 9: Dusting and Glazing: It’s Icing on the Cake
Caramel Glaze
This glaze is one of my favorites. Its richness pairs exceptionally well with a host of
cakes, such as nutty ones (such as almond and walnut), basic varieties (such as choco-
late and yellow cake), and the complementary Brown Sugar Cake (turn to Chapter 17 
for the recipe). Not surprisingly, it’s a hit over apple and banana cakes as well.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1⁄4 cup granulated white sugar
1⁄4 cup light brown sugar
1⁄2 cup heavy cream
1 In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter.
2 Add the granulated and light brown sugars to the melted butter. Cook the mixture, stir-
ring frequently until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes.
3 Stir in the cream (be careful of splattering), and bring to a boil.
4 Stir constantly as the mixture boils for 2 minutes. Then remove it from the heat. Let the
glaze cool for a few minutes before you pour it on your cake.

128
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
Lemon Glaze
This quick glaze’s lemon kick makes it light and refreshing. Try it served over citrus,
poppy seed, and even cherry cakes. For best results, pour this warm glaze over a warm
cake.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
1⁄2 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice
11⁄2 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1 In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the lemon juice and sugar. Stir frequently
until the sugar dissolves.
Fruit Glaze
You brush this glaze on fruit to give it an attractive, glossy appearance, both on top of a
cake and in a fruit filling. For best results, bring this glaze to room temperature before
putting it on the fruit.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1⁄4 cup
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 tablespoons water
1 In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine all the ingredients.
2 Bring the mixture to a boil, and let it boil for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

or some cakes, the frosting is also the filling —
the sweet confection you find in between the
cake layers. But for other cakes, you can take flavor
to new heights by introducing another layer of
taste: Use a filling between the layers that differs
from — but complements — the frosting.
Fillings can take on any number of textures and
tastes; smooth, creamy, chunky, fruity, nutty, and
chocolatey are just the tip of the iceberg. With so
many options, how’s a cake baker to choose? In
this chapter, I give you the lowdown on selecting the perfect filling for your
cake and follow up with recipes that tackle both traditional and unique flavors.
And, I fill you in on adding flavor to layers another way — with sweet syrups
ideal for cakes.
Picking the Best Filling for Your Cake
You may associate fillings with wedding cakes, but it’s time to move past the
formal ceremony and consider all the delicious possibilities where fillings
are concerned. With the right filling, you can give a cake for any occasion an
entirely different personality. As you consider your cake creation, think about
adding a filling that complements your cake and frosting to add depth and
interest.

When deciding on the kind of cake you’ll make, give some thought to how the
flavors and tastes will coalesce. The following list offers recommendations
for tasty cake and filling combinations:
 Chocolate cake pairs well with caramel filling, peanut butter filling, mocha
filling, and pecan filling.
 White chocolate cake pairs well with raspberry filling, cherry filling, and
dark chocolate filling.
 Yellow cake pairs well with chocolate or fudge filling, tropical fruit (mango,
passion fruit) filling, summer fruit (peach, blueberry) filling, and spicy
fillings such as cinnamon, fig, or raisin-nut.
 White cake pairs well with strawberry filling, lemon curd filling, and
coconut filling.
Be aware that not all cake and filling combinations make taste buds happy.
For example, I usually avoid pairing chocolate cake with fruit fillings and
carrot cake with chocolate fillings.
You aren’t obligated to use a different filling than the frosting on your cake.
Just make it a consideration in your cake creation and design. Particularly
with a white cake, you have a virtually wide open playing field because white
cake provides such an impartial, subtle flavor. But whenever you’re baking
a cake that has a strong taste and scent, like fudgy chocolate, pineapple,
mocha, or red velvet, you’re best sticking with a simple, basic frosting and
bypassing fillings altogether.
Taking Care with Fillings
Spreading a filling on your cake isn’t much different from frosting your cake.
Follow these basic steps:
1. Make sure that your cake has sufficiently cooled down before you
begin filling it.
2. Anchor the bottom layer to your cake pedestal or cake board with a
dab of frosting.
3. To hold your filling in place and prevent oozing, pipe a thick ridge of
frosting around the outside edge of your layer, as shown in Figure 10-1.
For best results you’ll want to put about a 1⁄2 cup of frosting into a pastry
bag that’s been outfitted with a #11 or #18 tip to pipe a ridge that’s thick
enough to hold in the filling but not be obtrusive.
4. To place the filling inside the frosting border, either spoon or pour it
carefully.
130
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

Then use an offset spatula to spread the filling around, getting as close
to the frosting border as possible.
As with frosting, don’t skimp on the filling; make sure you have plenty to
work with. But also, don’t overfill your cake layers: You don’t want the filling
running off and down the sides of your cake, mixing in unwantedly with your
frosting and ruining all your hard decorating work.
Indulging in Creaminess: Smooth Fillings
With smooth fillings, the flavor is the star. With just a few basic ingredients,
you can create light, flavorful fillings that add a special decadence to your
already delicious cakes.
In addition to whipped cream fillings, I’m also very fond of filling cakes with
mousses, which have whipped cream folded into them to make them light
and fluffy. The recipes for creamy fillings in this chapter range from tasty
variations on whipped cream, to the thicker, candy-like flavors — like choco-
late and caramel — that work so well with many cakes, and both a traditional
(chocolate again!) and nontraditional (key lime) take on irresistible mousses.
For these fillings, you’ll want to use a hand or stand mixer (instead of 
trying to do the work by hand) to achieve the best results in both taste
and consistency — and to save you time. While I prefer using a stand mixer,
a hand mixer will do the trick.

Chapter 10: Amping Up the Flavor: Spreading Fillings

The filling recipes in this chapter that call for whipped cream require it to be
whipped until stiff peaks form. What exactly are stiff peaks? That’s when the
cream has reached a point that it stands up on its own. (However, pay atten-
tion to the process: If you beat beyond that point for too long, you’ll end up
with butter!) When you’re done whipping the cream (that is, you’ve achieved
stiff peaks and added any flavorings or sugar), fill your cake as soon as possi-
ble. Timing is everything: If you’re using whipped cream, whip it close to serv-
ing time, and plan on keeping it refrigerated. If not, the whipped cream loses
its volume and starts puddling.
For recipes that tell you to whip cream into stiff peaks, it’s essential to start
out with cold whipping cream. Absolutely don’t use whipping cream that’s
been sitting out of the refrigerator and collecting drops of moisture for any
amount of time. You need to use very cold (but not frozen) cream to achieve
the desired result.
Put your empty mixing bowl and beater into the freezer for 30 minutes before
you begin whipping cream to help your cause.
132
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
Basic Whipped Cream
Whipped cream is a popular choice for fillings, particularly with fruit flavored cakes,
because it imparts a subtle, sweet flavor that both highlights virtually any kind of cake
and spotlights stronger flavorings. Its texture also makes it a nice, lighter alternative to
consider for buttercream frostings. While it’s not a good choice for covering the outside
of your cake, you can also have this available to be served with your cake as a cake
condiment.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1⁄4 cup confectioners’ sugar
1 In a large bowl, beat the cream on medium speed until it starts to firm up a bit, and
gradually add in the confectioners’ sugar.
2 Beat on high speed until stiff peaks form.

133
Chapter 10: Amping Up the Flavor: Spreading Fillings
Chocolate Whipped Cream
This is another popular filling that, like Basic Whipped Cream, can also be served on
the side with your cake. Depending on your frosting choices, this is a wonderful filling
for white, yellow, and chocolate cakes.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 3 cups
11⁄2 cups heavy whipping cream
11⁄4 cups confectioners’ sugar
1⁄3 cup cocoa
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and beat on high speed until stiff peaks form.
Coffee Cream
This coffee-flavored filling is a deliciously different take on whipped cream that makes
an excellent filling in chocolate cakes. Just don’t substitute regular instant coffee for the
espresso powder. The taste won’t be the same, and the instant coffee crystals don’t dis-
solve as well in the filling as espresso does.
Preparation time: 5 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 4 cups
2 cups whipping cream
1⁄4 cup confectioners’ sugar
3 teaspoons instant espresso powder
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and beat on high speed until stiff peaks form.
2 Fill the cake immediately, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour, or until you’re ready to
serve it.
Some smooth fillings, like the Caramel Filling that follows, require cooking,
which means that you need to get your hands on a candy thermometer. The
candy thermometer sits in the saucepan while the mixture cooks and allows
you to easily monitor the temperature of your filling to ensure that it reaches
the proper temperature.

A candy thermometer is a must-have when you’re making a filling recipe that
requires you to boil a mixture to the soft-ball stage, which happens around
238 degrees F. The soft-ball stage means that, if you were to drop a hot glob of
filling in cold water, it would form a soft ball.
134
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
Caramel Filling
This filling is particularly delicious with yellow cakes, chocolate cakes, and the Brown
Sugar Cake (see Chapter 17), and it pairs well with a variety of chocolate frostings. I’ve
often called on this to create cake versions of candy bars because its sweet, rich taste 
is so satisfying.
Preparation time: 30 minutes (includes cooling)
Yield: 2 cups
1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1 cup granulated white sugar
1⁄2 cup unsalted butter
1⁄2 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 In a large saucepan, combine all ingredients and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the
sugar completely. Remove the filling from the heat when it reaches 238 degrees F on a
candy thermometer (soft-ball stage), which should take about 8 minutes.
2 Transfer the filling to a medium bowl, and let it cool to room temperature (about 20
minutes). Beat on medium speed until the filling reaches a spreadable consistency.
Amazing Chocolate Filling
This delicious filling is smooth and chocolatey but not too sweet to be paired with a
chocolate cake.
Preparation time: 45 minutes (includes cooling)
Yield: 2 cups
1 cup cocoa
1 cup granulated white sugar
1 cup evaporated milk

1 In a medium bowl, sift together the cocoa and sugar.
2 In a medium saucepan, stir to combine the dry mixture with the milk over medium-low
heat.
3 Stirring frequently, cook until the mixture thickens to a spreadable consistency (about
20 minutes).
4 Transfer the filling to a medium bowl, and let it cool to room temperature (about 20
minutes) before using it on your cake.

Chocolate Mousse
Here’s a delectable take on chocolate mousse that makes a beautiful inside surprise to
several kinds of cakes, including (obviously) chocolate, but also white chocolate,
marble, and, in a deconstructed twist on a German chocolate cake, coconut.
Preparation time: 15 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 3 cups
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
11⁄2 cups cold heavy cream, plus 1⁄2 cup heavy
cream
1⁄2 cup confectioners’ sugar
1⁄4 cup granulated white sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 In a medium saucepan, combine the confectioners’ sugar and 1⁄2 cup heavy cream, 
stirring over low heat.
2 Add the chocolate chips, stirring frequently as they melt and the mixture becomes 
well blended.
3 Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla, and set this chocolate mixture aside.
4 In a large bowl, beat 11⁄2 cups of heavy cream on medium speed, and gradually add in the
granulated sugar. When all the sugar has been incorporated, beat the mixture on high
speed until stiff peaks form.
5 Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, taking care not to overmix. Refrigerate
for at least 1 hour before using on your cake.

Key Lime Mousse
This tart and refreshing mousse is a great filling for white, coconut, or citrus cakes. You
can use the juice of other limes, but key limes give it a distinctive taste that cake eaters
love and comment upon.
Preparation time: 20 minutes plus 2 hours to overnight for refrigeration
Yield: 3 cups
1⁄2 cup fresh key lime juice (from about 15 key
limes)
2⁄3 cup granulated white sugar
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1⁄2 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces
1⁄4 cup cold whipping cream
1 In a medium saucepan, combine the key lime juice and sugar, stirring over medium heat
for 2 to 3 minutes until the sugar dissolves. Then remove from the heat.
2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg yolks.
3 Gradually add the key lime syrup to the eggs, and then return the custard to the saucepan
over medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 2 to 3 minutes until it coats the back of
the spoon. Be careful not to let the custard boil.
4 Remove the key lime custard from the heat, and add the butter, stirring until the butter
dissolves. Refrigerate the custard for at least 2 hours. (If possible, refrigerate the custard
overnight for best results.)
5 In a large bowl, beat the cream on high speed until stiff peaks form. Mix a small amount
of cream into the refrigerated key lime custard, and then fold the remaining cream into
the custard, gently drawing the two together without overmixing. Refrigerate the mousse
until you’re ready to use it on your cake.

Dulce de Leche Filling
A popular dessert in Latin American countries, dulce de leche, which is essentially
carmelized sugar in milk, has quickly found a following in cake decorating circles. This
recipe is an easy way to turn dulce de leche into a fabulous filling.
Preparation time: 1 to 11⁄4 hours
Yield: 3 cups
2 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk
1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2 Pour the milk into an 8-x-8-x-2-inch clear glass baking dish that fits into a larger, deeper
cake pan. Cover the glass dish with aluminum foil.
3 Place the large cake pan on the oven rack, and set the glass dish inside it. Fill the larger
pan with boiling water until the water reaches two-thirds of the way up the sides of the
glass dish.
4 Bake for 1 to 11⁄4 hours, or until the milk turns a caramel color.
5 Use a rubber spatula to scrape the filling into a large bowl. Beat the filling on medium
speed until it reaches a spreadable, smooth consistency (about 1 minute).

Crunching Things Up: Chunky Fillings
Chunkier fillings add a depth of texture to your cake. As with smooth fillings,
you have to be mindful of what fillings you pair with what cakes. For example,
if your decoration plan includes several crunchy decorations on your cake,
you may not want to overdo it with a chunky filling, too. Take the whole cake —
and each bite — into account.

Pink Cherry Filling
This cherry filling is a nice soft one for white birthday cakes, and the color contrast of
pink filling against white cake is particularly pleasing to the eye.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 cups
2 cups whipping cream
1⁄4 cup sifted confectioners’ sugar

Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
1 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 cup granulated white sugar
3 egg yolks
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
11⁄2 cups shredded coconut
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, sugar, egg yolks, and butter. Bring to a
simmer, and continue cooking until thickened (about 10 minutes), stirring occasionally.
2 Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and stir in the coconut and nuts. Let the filling cool
to room temperature before using it on your cake.
Raspberry Filling
Raspberry is a popular filling for wedding cakes, but you’re certainly not limited to that
usage. This simple, unadorned filling spreads sweetly and vibrantly and tastes especially
great on white chocolate cake.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 11⁄2 cups
1 cup granulated white sugar
1⁄4 cup cornstarch
1⁄2 cup water
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cups fresh raspberries
1 In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and cornstarch over medium heat. Gradually
add the water, and stir to dissolve.
2 Add the butter and raspberries, and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil the filling, stirring
constantly, until it thickens to a spreadable consistency.
3 Let the filling cool to room temperature before spreading it on your cake.
Coconut Filling
Any time you’re looking to add a tropical twist to a white cake, yellow cake, or even
carrot cake, look no further than this zesty and creamy addition.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 cups

Summoning Syrups
Certain cakes, like the Sponge Cake (Chapter 6), and heavier denser cakes,
such as the Honey Cake (Chapter 17), practically scream to be moistened
with a flavorful syrup for ultimate deliciousness. Syrups are usually made
with a ratio of confectioners’ sugar and water, with some flavoring added,
and they’re brushed on cakes that will readily soak them up.
The ratio of sugar to water that you choose dictates a heavy or light syrup.
For instance, after being heated, a 1 cup sugar to 1 cup water ratio produces a
thicker syrup than one in which 1⁄3 cup of sugar is dissolved in 1 cup of water.
If you’re interested in checking out how different syrups complement or detract
from different kinds of cake, you can pick up bottles of fruit-flavored syrups at
some specialty markets, online retailers, and restaurant supply stores.

Chapter 10: Amping Up the Flavor: Spreading Fillings
Orange Syrup
This syrup really livens up a cake with its citrus zip and would be nice on a Sponge
Cake that has a fruity filling. The sugar-liquid ratio will produce a thin syrup with a
highly-concentrated taste.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
1 cup granulated white sugar
2 cups fresh-squeezed orange juice
1⁄2 cup orange liqueur
1 In a medium saucepan, stir to combine all the ingredients.
2 Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Simmer for
about 10 minutes until the mixture thickens and reduces slightly.
3 Remove the syrup from the heat, and let it cool partially before using it.

142
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 
1⁄2 cup fruit preserves, jam, or jelly (your
choice)
1 In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, simmer the preserves until they liquefy and
stir easily.
2 Strain the partially cooled mixture through a sieve before using it.
Tip: You can also spread this syrup over fruit on a cake.
Your Choice Fruit Syrup
This recipe couldn’t be easier — or produce a tastier result. All you have to do is pick
up your favorite fruit preserves, jam, or jelly, or you can explore your grocery’s jelly
aisle and branch out with a new flavor. For instance, mango or papaya preserves add 
an exotic, tasty flavor to the layers of a tropically themed coconut cake. Apricot jam
brings a wonderfully complementary flavor to vanilla-flavored or honey cake. (This
recipe makes 1⁄4 cup but is easily doubled or tripled.)

 Getting to know icing tips
 Working with piping tools
 Taking on piping techniques
F
or some, icing tips can be an intimidating aspect of cake decorating. The
thought of filling and operating a pastry bag with these tiny metal cones
attached may seem cumbersome, unwieldy, and difficult. And the idea that they
produce stars, flowers, and even words can seem downright inconceivable.
But cake decorating that ventures beyond a basic coat of frosting usually
involves tips — with their vast varieties and amazing effects — so it’s an
area you should get comfortable with. In this chapter, I help you sort out the
tips available for your artful creations and tell you which tips produce which
designs. I also offer instructions on using tips to create popular designs such
as shells, stars, swags, and basket weaves as well as flooded and filled in out-
lines, and frozen frosting transfers.
Decoding Tip Numbers
You may have taken a look at icing tips before and thought: How can there
possibly be so many? How will I ever know what to do with each of them?
Aren’t they like a pencil . . . can’t one sort of do everything?
Tips are marvelous because, after you master the mechanics of filling and
holding a pastry bag, they put a staggering number of decorating possibilities
at your disposal. Don’t be put off by the number of tips there are to choose from
or think of the preparation part as drudgery. Think of yourself as a painter lining
up brushes and tools to accomplish a masterpiece.
When you first get started using tips, you’re likely to rely on a few tips for
most of your designs and projects. When you get comfortable with those, it’s
easier than ever to branch out into more tips and add more designs to your
repertoire.

A tip-tionary
Although you probably know what scripting means, you may not have heard
some of the other common terms that relate to a tip’s form and function. (The
next section tells you which tips create which result.) The following are stan-
dard tip techniques:
 Basket weave: With a basket weave, you replicate in frosting the look
of a woven basket. Traditional basket weave tips are grooved, creating
depth and dimension for rows and rows of straight lines that run alter-
nately horizontally and vertically, usually around the sides of a cake.
 Borders: Borders can be straight lines, stars, rosettes, shells, or many
other forms and frills. They provide a finished look along the top and
bottom edges of the cake.
 Drop flowers: Drop flowers are usually more representative than realistic
in their design. You use any number of tips to create a quick flower.
 Fill in: When you fill in, you complete an artwork outline using lines or
stars in a repeating pattern, compacting those lines and stars as close as
possible so that the background frosting doesn’t show through. Fill in is
similar to the paint-by-number process or coloring in a coloring book.
 Fleur-de-lis: This pretty cake adornment is a stylized version of the iris
flower. It makes a dramatic repeated design.
 Garlands and swags: These designs consist of strands of icing that can
resemble ribbons, vines, or swinging banners. You can embellish them
further with frosting shells, dots, or rosettes. They create interest around
the circumference of the cake.
 Lace: Tight, skinny lines and curls of frosting create this look, which is
especially popular on shower and wedding cakes.
 Lattice work: Much like a trellis you’d find as part of a landscape design,
lattice work on a cake makes a realistic backdrop for climbing designs.
Lattice work is kind of like a basket weave but features more space in
between the piped lines.
 Lettering: You use the most basic round tips to create block letters on a
cake.
 Outlines: If you’re trying to set off part or all of your decorating work,
you may opt to define it with a fine or thick outline of icing in a darker
color.
 Rosettes: Resembling mini-roses, rosettes are a pretty addition to a
cake’s rim, base, or surface design. Like drop flowers, they’re more rep-
resentative than realistic.
144
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

 Ruffles: These wavy, thick bands of frosting make a luxurious border.
 Scripting: This technique refers to writing words on the cake in cursive.
 Shells: Another popular border choice, shells may take a bit of practice
to get right. The icing tip’s groove marks create indentations like you’d
find on a seashell. You can leave shells plain or embellish them for more
dramatic effect.
 Stars: A very popular decoration for borders and a feature in a multitude
of designs, stars fit in with many themes and color schemes. Besides being
simple to pipe, rows and rows of stars can fill in sections of a bigger design
for a textured and impressive (but easy to complete) look.
The most popular tips
Icing tips are numbered according to their sizes and shapes, and as you can
see in Table 11-1, you have (literally) hundreds of tips to choose from. The
table covers the basic icing tip groups, lists the tip numbers in those groups,
and tells you what designs you can produce using those tips. Many of the tips
and designs are shown in Figure 11-1.

with no center, so you can fill in the center with a single dot or several dots
(using a small round tip) to form a stamen in any other color you choose.
The cake decorating recipes in Part IV give you an idea of how to use the
most popular and common tips. A beginner’s cake decorating kit typically
has just a couple of round tips (#3 and #12), star tips (#16 and #21), the rose
(#104), and the leaf (#352), but you have a plethora of other options available.
Experimenting with all the tips that you can get your hands on will make your
cakes even more impressive.
The next time you’re in a bakeshop or at your grocery store’s bakery 
department, take a look at the cakes to see if you can tell which tip was used
for which design element. Take particular note of effects you’d like to put
on your own cakes. If you have trouble figuring it out, just ask the bakers
behind the counter; they usually love answering questions about their work.
Seeing and learning about others’ decoration work can influence yours for
the better.

Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

Preparing to Pipe
You have many choices for pastry bags: featherweight, reusable plastic ones;
cone-shaped bags; and even 15-inch parchment paper triangles that you roll
into cones. But for me, there’s only one choice: clear, plastic disposable bags.
They’re widely available in grocery stores, craft stores, and cake decorating
shops, which is evidence that cake decorators everywhere love the conve-
nience they offer. Disposable piping bags offer these advantages:
 They make cleanup a snap.
 You can keep track of the frosting colors and easily grab the one you
need because the bags are transparent.
 You can quickly gauge how much frosting you have left in a bag.
Figure 11-1:
Different
tips,
different
effects.
147
Chapter 11: Tip Talk

Initially, I tried using the featherweight, reusable plastic bags, but aside from
having trouble telling which color was in which bag, I could never get them
as clean as I wanted. When you’re working with rich buttercream and ganache,
you have to contend with residue that takes lots of hot water and scrubbing
to get rid of. It’s my guess that what I spend on disposable items I probably
save in hot water!
Gathering the goods
As you prepare to master tip techniques, in addition to pastry bags and tips,
you need the following equipment:
 Couplers: To hold the tip in place in the pastry bag
 Coupler rings: To screw tips onto couplers
 Large icing spatula: To transfer frosting from the tinting bowl to the
pastry bag
 Locking bag clips: To keep the pastry bag sealed as you work
 Tall cups: To hold the frosting-filled pastry bags upright while you fill
them and when you’re not using them
 Moist paper towels: To place inside the tall cups to keep tips from
drying out while you work
Outfitting a pastry bag
Follow these instructions (and check out Figure 11-2) to outfit a pastry bag
with the proper hardware and your beautifully tinted frosting:
1. Prepare one tall plastic cup (16 ounces or so) for each pastry bag you
plan to fill. For each cup, moisten a paper towel, fold it into a square,
and place it in the bottom of the cup.
2. Drop a cone-shaped coupler into a pastry bag and position it so that
the small end of the coupler fits into the point of the bag. Snip off the
end of the bag only to the point that the cone is flush with the opening.
3. Insert an icing tip into the coupler ring, and screw the coupler ring
onto the pastry bag.
4. Fold down the wide end of the bag to make a 2-inch cuff. Set the bag
upright in the tall cup, and fold the cuff over the rim of the cup.
The cuff keeps the bag neat.
148
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

5. Using the large icing spatula, transfer 1⁄2 cup to 2⁄3 cup of frosting to the
bag.
These amounts are great for practicing. When you’re decorating a cake,
you want to fill the bag half-full. Any more than that and frosting will
ooze out as you pipe.
6. Roll the cuff back up, and secure the bag with a locking bag clip.
A bag clip is similar to a chip bag clip that snaps into place.
Figure 11-2:

a pastry 
bag with

149
Chapter 11: Tip Talk

Holding the bag
Before you begin piping, remove the bag clip that you affixed to the bag. As
you work, you’ll keep the bag sealed with your guiding hand loosely gripped
around it.
When piping, you apply pressure to the bag with your dominant hand and
guide the bag with your other hand. To hold the bag while decorating, curl
four fingers of your nondominant hand around the top of the bag, and apply
even pressure with your dominant hand at the tip end to squeeze frosting
through the tip. The frosting will continue coming out until you stop squeez-
ing. As you decorate, periodically squeeze frosting from the top of the bag
down toward the tip so that you get a steady flow of frosting and therefore a
neater execution of your design.
Practicing Tipping Points and Techniques
There’s no secret to mastering tip techniques for cake decorating. Succeeding
in piping boils down to one word: practice. Fortunately, setting up a practice
station is incredibly easy, and working with the tips to experiment and craft
creations is fun, too.
To practice, you need some frosting to work with, such as the stiff decorator
frosting recipe in Chapter 8. I prefer to practice with actual frosting, but you
also may use shortening, which has a similar consistency to frosting and is
more convenient because it doesn’t involve any preparation. The medium
you use is your choice.
To set up a practice station, place sheets of wax or parchment paper down
on a smooth work surface or an inverted cookie sheet. Follow the directions
for outfitting a pastry bag provided in the section “Preparing to Pipe” earlier
in this chapter, line up the tips you want to practice with, and pipe away.
When you’re comfortable with one tip and design, switch it out for another
tip and continue practicing.
To keep track of your tip studies, write the tip number on the wax or parch-
ment paper in permanent marker, and then pipe next to it. Study the tip as
well as the frosting that comes out, examining the tip’s features from all
angles. For example, tip #67 makes leaves from one direction but, if you flip
the tip over and pipe, you get attractive ruffles.
150
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

Lining up dots, rosettes, shells, 
stars, and leaves
All dots, rosettes, shells, stars, and leaves are not created equal. Different 
tips turn these designs out in all different sizes, making it easy to create 
variations on these popular decorations. For instance, dots — the easiest
shapes to pipe — can be as small as the #1 tip or as big as the #809 tip. More
than likely, you’ll stay in the #1 to #12 range. (You can find descriptions of
these designs in the section “A tip-tionary” earlier in this chapter.)
To pipe a dot, you simply hold your bag at a 90-degree angle, squeeze the
frosting out, stop squeezing, lift up your tip, and move on. If tips intimidate
you, start with the open round tips in the #1 to #11 range, which are easy to
maneuver.
When you feel confident in a simple dot, try enhancing your dots. For instance,
with a #10 round tip, you can form a heart by piping two inverted teardrops
side by side. A teardrop is just a modified dot in that, instead of lifting the tip
up immediately, you draw it away from the dot before lifting up.
Rosettes, shells, stars, and leaves may take a bit more practice and patience
than dots, but you’ll be crafting them in no time as well. Just be sure that you
outfit your pastry bag with the right type and number of tip; refer to Table
11-1 for guidance.
For rosettes:
1. Hold the bag at a 90-degree angle to the surface, about 1⁄8 inch above it.
2. Squeeze the pastry bag and hold the tip in place briefly before
moving the tip around to the right in a short circular motion.
3. Stop squeezing just before you reach the original starting point, and
pull the tip away.
To make shells:
1. Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface, slightly above the
surface.
2. Squeeze the pastry bag until the frosting builds up and fans out into a
base as you lift the tip up slightly.
3. Relax pressure as you lower the tip, just until it touches the surface.
4. Release the pressure on the bag. Pull the tip away without lifting it off
the surface, drawing the shell to a point.
151
Chapter 11: Tip Talk

For a row of shells, place the head of one shell on the tail of the shell that pre-
cedes it. For larger shells, increase your piping pressure. For smaller shells,
use less pressure.
To create stars:
1. Hold the bag at a 90-degree angle to the surface, about 1⁄8 inch above it.
2. Squeeze the pastry bag until a star forms. Release the pressure, and
pull the tip away at a 90-degree angle. To get a well-defined star, make
sure that you stop squeezing before you pull the tip away.
To make leaves:
1. Hold the pastry bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface, touching the
tip to the surface.
2. Squeeze the pastry bag, drawing the tip into a leaf shape, lessening
pressure as you move to the leaf’s point.
3. Release pressure on the bag, and bring the leaf out to a point.
Guiding lines, garlands, and swags
For outlining, you guide your tip around an illustration already present on
your cake’s surface. To practice outlining, draw a design on paper in perma-
nent marker and lay it underneath the wax or parchment paper on your prac-
tice surface so that the design is visible. Then follow these steps:
1. Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle to the surface, touching the tip to
the surface.
2. Pick a starting point, and squeeze the pastry bag with the tip on the
surface so that the icing sticks. Raise the tip slightly as you squeeze
and move the tip along the design, guiding the tip above the surface.
3. To end the outline, stop squeezing the bag, touch the tip to the sur-
face, and pull the tip away.
When you’re done practicing and ready to attempt curved lines, garlands, or
swags around a cake’s diameter, a plastic lid comes in exceptionally handy.
Just press it lightly all around the sides of the frosted cake so that part of the
lid forms either the bottom-half of a circle or a downward-facing arc, depend-
ing on your desired design. The indentations serve as your piping guide.
152
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

Piping borders
A succession of dots, rosettes, shells, or stars makes for an interesting, multi-
dimensional border. For variety, you can stagger the effects or pipe them out
in contrasting directions.
Also, you can combine these designs for borders. For instance, a vine looks
even sweeter with rosettes at points along it. Rosettes also may be separated
by leaves, and swags can join shells together. Enliven combinations even
more with tiny accent dots, stars, or thin ruffles, or join spaced-out decora-
tive groupings together with frosting strings.
You can add a lot to borders to make them appealing and attractive, but don’t
overdo it or you’ll end up with a gloppy frosting mess of overlapping, indistin-
guishable shapes. Spend some time sketching out your ideas beforehand,
taking note of which embellishments fit where, which complement each
other, which are the focal points, and which work best as accents.
Make some practice time to perfect your border design . . . particularly if it’s
a technique that you haven’t tried before or you’re combining two (or more)
techniques for the first time.
Basket weaving without
becoming a basket case
The basket weave design makes for an elegant allover covering for a cake, but
it’s also sometimes referred to as the ultimate border because, for full effect,
it must cover the entire perimeter of a cake, from top to bottom edges. As a
border design, the basket weave works on cakes of any shape.
After you master the specifics of basket weaving, you’ll realize that you can
use many different tips to accomplish the look — even those that aren’t
specifically designated for basket weaving. It’s all a matter of preference for
the size and style of the cake you’re decorating. Just remember to keep your
lines crisp and your weaving orderly.
Follow these directions to execute the basket weave design, and refer to
Figure 11-3:
1. Position your pastry bag perpendicular to the side of the cake. Starting
at the top edge, and with the ridged side of the tip facing up and the
tip just touching the surface, squeeze the bag as you lift the tip just
153
Chapter 11: Tip Talk

barely away from the side of the cake and move it down slowly in a
vertical line, applying even pressure as you go from top to bottom. At
the bottom edge of the cake, touch the tip to the surface of the cake
again, stop squeezing, and lift the bag completely away.
2. Hold the bag perpendicular to the side of the cake, and position it at
the top of the vertical column from Step 1, 1⁄2 inch to one side of it. The
ridged side of the tip should face away from the cake. Pipe a bar that
extends 1⁄2 inch to either side of the vertical column.
3. Right underneath the horizontal bar in Step 2, press the edge of your
tip into the cake to make a slight indentation. Underneath that inden-
tation, pipe another bar the same size as the first one. Repeat the
indentation and piping all the way down the vertical column.
4. Pipe the next vertical column from the top edge of the cake to the
bottom, covering the ends of the horizontal bars.
5. Pipe horizontal bars over the column from Step 4, spacing them so
that they fill in the gaps left by the previous horizontal bars.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 around the perimeter of the cake.

Flooding, Filling, and Other 
Fun Design Techniques
As you become familiar with a host of tips, you’ll undoubtedly appreciate
their use and ease in some simpler applications that can feature small 
illustrations on your cake or ones that cover the entire surface.
Tips afford you the chance to decorate and accentuate your cakes with a range
of designs, including filled outlines and scripted letters and messages. Another
interesting technique, the frozen buttercream transfer, is a fun and somewhat
unconventional way to add dimension to your cake in an eye-catching way.
Flooding a design
Flooding a design is a common way of decorating cookies, and it works for
cake decorating, too. To begin, you need a cake that’s already been crumb
coated, frosted, and refrigerated to form a crust.
With this decorative method, you use royal icing (refer to Chapter 9 for a
recipe) to outline an image, and then, with a large round tip on a pastry bag (or
even a squeeze bottle), you fill in the outline with a solid color of frosting. You
should squeeze out enough royal icing to flood or completely fill the outline.
Depending on the consistency of the royal icing, you may need to smooth it
out with an icing spatula after you flood the outline.
If you want to add different-colored accents to a flooded design, you have to
let the icing set and dry for several hours first.
Filling a design
Flooding is just one way to fill a design; other methods add dimension and tex-
ture to the design. For example, cake pans in the shapes of teddy bears, beach
balls, or cartoon characters usually come with guidelines that tell you what
icing tips and frosting colors to use to fill in the designs in a paint-by-number
fashion. You also have the option of coming up with your own tip and color
designs to add color, character, and dimension to cakes in interesting shapes.
The easiest and most effective way to fill a design is to use a #16 star tip with
multiple frosting colors. Follow these instructions:
1. Frost your cake with a neutral-colored base frosting and refrigerate it
for 1 hour so that the frosting hardens into a crust.
155
Chapter 11: Tip Talk

2. Use a toothpick to section off or sketch out the different areas or
shapes that you plan to fill in.
3. With a #3 icing tip, outline those areas in the color frosting for that
particular graphic component.
4. Pipe stars, each one right next to the other, to fill in the design area.
The base frosting in the design area should be completely covered
with stars.
For a star how-to, refer to the section “Lining up dots, rosettes, shells,
stars, and leaves” earlier in this chapter.
To complete the design, you may choose to pipe straight lines or ruffles
around the cake’s perimeter for additional dimension. Outlining your star-
filled creation gives it a finished look.
Lettering and scripting
Sometimes, a simple message can really make (and take) the cake. When you’ve
mastered letters in different styles, you can take your cake lettering and script-
ing to new heights. Writing on a cake can be as simple as fashioning initials or as
detailed as using a sheet cake’s rectangular shape as a page in a book, complete
with the text you’d find in a fairy tale, for example. For most, lettering on a cake
is a way to express a snappy, happy greeting or warm wishes.
Granted, you’re at an advantage if you already have good penmanship. If your
regular handwriting is messy or unattractive, practice your technique to get a
feel for how to mold, shape, and guide letters and also the best way to hold
and guide your pastry bag.
Practice is very important when it comes to lettering and scripting in frosting.
Use the different sizes of round tips, like #1 to #12, to get a feel for the size
and thickness of letters they produce. When you practice, don’t be afraid to
play around a bit and try block letters and cursive. If you’re feeling particu-
larly adventurous, tip #44 is a great choice for calligraphy-style scripting. If
you’re struggling with different writing styles, surf the Internet for calligraphy
examples or pick up an instructional book on calligraphy at your local library
and practice writing in different ways before you try piping. (On more than
one occasion, I’ve literally drawn on the techniques I learned in a calligraphy
class.)
When you feel comfortable enough to try writing on a cake, decide what
you’re going to write before you take the tip to the surface! Don’t wait until
you have frosting coming out of your pastry bag to choose your words —
you’re likely to end up with a squiggly mess or misspelled words. Also, the
number of letters or words you’re putting on a cake dictates the size of the
156
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

tip you use; if you’re just scripting initials or a short message, you can use a
large tip, but if you have a lot of words to fit on the cake, a small tip is best.
Follow these guidelines for turning your words into a frosting message:
 For scripting, use buttercream or stiff decorator frosting (see Chapter 8
for recipes). Both are smooth and firm enough to produce crisp letters.
 On a cake that has been crumb coated, frosted, and refrigerated, use a
toothpick or bamboo skewer to sketch out the message. Don’t bear
down too hard; you’re just blocking out where your letters will appear. If
you make a mistake, frost the cake again, refrigerate it, and start over.
 Don’t put too much frosting in the pastry bag — stick with about 2⁄3 cup.
And before you start scripting on the cake, test the frosting’s consistency
by piping a few letters or words on a piece of wax paper.
 Make sure that the cake you’re scripting on is placed straight on the table
or work surface. If it’s slanted, your writing may end up slanted, too.
 If you’re unhappy with the way your writing looks, lift it off the surface
of the cake delicately with a toothpick or bamboo skewer, and begin
again. (It’s particularly easy to lift your lettering off the cake if the cake
has been refrigerated and the frosting is cold.)
When you make frosting for lettering and scripting, it’s important to sift the
confectioners’ sugar thoroughly. Little balls of sugar in the frosting can clog
up the pastry bag as you pipe, and although you can usually remove or break
up the clog with a toothpick, the flow of your scripting will have already been
interrupted. Unlike some decorations, it’s hard to hide mistakes in writing.
Creating a frozen buttercream transfer
With a frozen buttercream transfer, you create a graphic image off the cake,
freeze it for permanence, and then adhere it to the cake. This technique draws
on some of the tip techniques discussed in this chapter, but it allows you to
cheat a bit in the sense that you create artwork that looks as if it were applied
directly to the cake. For this process, you need:
 Buttercream frosting
 Pastry bags and round icing tips
 Wax paper
 A graphic image printed in reverse
 Tape
 A flat, portable surface (preferably a large wooden cake board)
157
Chapter 11: Tip Talk

Follow these steps to create a frozen buttercream transfer:
1. Tape the image to the cake board, and then tape a piece of wax paper
over the image.
The wax paper, which serves as tracing paper, will hold your finished
design.
2. Use your choice of outline color to pipe an outline of the picture with
fresh, firm buttercream frosting.
Follow the bold lines on your image. This step is similar to outlining a
fill-in design on the cake itself, which I cover earlier in this chapter.
3. Much like you would for a paint-by-number picture, fill in the outline
by piping the different colors you desire. Use round tips to fill the
design with solid frosting.
Think about the layers of your colors, and color the parts of your image
that stand out first. For example, if you’re filling in a flower arrangement
of flowers and leaves in a vase, you do the flowers first, then the leaves,
and finally the vase. (Think about a real flower arrangement: The flowers
cover up the leaves, which cover up the top of the vase.)
4. When you finish coloring the graphic by filling in the outlined areas,
smooth out the frosting by gently pressing it down with an icing spat-
ula. Take care not to blend the colors underneath.
Smoothing settles your frosting into the grooves to create a clean and
complete finished product.
5. Place the creation into the freezer for at least 11⁄2 hours.
6. Remove the transfer from the freezer, unfasten the tape from the cake
board, and turn the design resting on the wax paper over onto your
frosted cake.
7. Gently peel off the wax paper.
Your reverse image should be a colorful, layered piece of artwork on top
of your cake.

A
s cake decorating increases in popularity, now more than ever before
you have a host of accoutrements, accessories, trimmings, frills, and
figures to choose from when decorating your cake. Some require a bit of know-
how to master, like modeling marzipan and gum paste or making roses, whereas
others just call for a keen eye for fun detail.
This chapter welcomes you to a world of creativity as you explore and pick
up the skills involved in transforming your cake into a celebratory, theme-
appropriate vision with a plethora of enhancements.
Easing into Enhancements
The beauty of cake decorating is that sometimes a simple, fresh, and natural
approach is best. You don’t always have to undertake a huge, monumental
task; the occasion or the time available to decorate may force you to go
with a simpler and quicker — although still impressive — design.

 Marzipan
 Gum Paste

The great thing about starting out simply is that you get a strong handle on
fundamentals of placement and design in your cake decorating endeavors.
These opportunities provide you with the chance to show off basic skills
while dressing up a cake beautifully at the same time.
Adding zip with fresh fruit
Cakes topped with fresh fruits look spectacular. Just wander down the produce
aisle of your local grocer and imagine the possibilities. Consider the beauty —
and simplicity — of a cake topped with a concentric arrangement of glazed
whole cherries, raspberries, strawberries, sliced peaches, or halved apricots.
(Flip to Chapter 9 for glaze recipes.) If you’re planning a cake that will feature
fruit as a prime component, take these guidelines into account:
 In choosing fruit to put on top of the cake, keep in mind the flavor of
your cake. Choose fruits that will complement it, not overpower or
work against it. For instance, raspberries pair well with white and dark
chocolate, but mangoes would make for an odd pairing with any kind
of chocolate. However, they’re delicious with white and yellow cakes.
 Certain fruits, such as sliced bananas and apples, brown quickly, so they
won’t look as appealing as other options. For that reason, I advise that
you avoid glazing these fruits on cakes.
 Consider the fruit’s appearance. For example, lemon and orange slices
look nice and shiny, but quartered wedges of these fruits are too bulky
and don’t present them in such a flattering light.
 Stick with fresh fruits. Although frozen fruits are convenient and a great
ingredient in some recipes, they tend to get mushy when they’re defrosted
and also may bleed juice onto your cake if they’re not completely defrosted
and drained before you arrange them.
 Quality control is a must. Make sure that any fruits you plan to decorate
with are clean and free of brown or moldy spots.
The following fruits all make particularly colorful additions to a cake:
 Strawberries (whole or sliced)
 Raspberries
 Blueberries
 Mango slices
 Kiwi slices
 Pineapple chunks
 Star fruit slices

Tropical Fruit Panorama Cake
Here’s a tropical cake take on a fruit tart that includes luscious fruits on top of white
cake. It’s pretty, simple, and makes for a beautiful presentation.
Tools: Two 9-inch round pans
Preparation time: 15 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 12 servings
One batch Most Excellent White Cake batter
(see Chapter 6)
One batch Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
1⁄2 cup guava jelly
2 kiwis, skinned and sliced
1⁄2 pint blueberries
1⁄2 pint strawberries
Mango, pitted, skinned, and sliced
1 Bake the cake according to the recipe in Chapter 6. After the layers have cooled, level
them, and stack them with a layer of buttercream in between.
2 Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of buttercream frosting to the cake, and refrigerate it
for 1 hour. Then frost it again.
3 In a small saucepan, heat the guava jelly over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it 
liquefies.
4 Arrange the fruit in concentric circles on top of the cake. Begin with the kiwi slices in
the center of the cake, fanning them out; circle the blueberries around the kiwi; circle
the strawberries around the blueberries; and add the sliced mango around the straw-
berries.
5 Brush the fruit with guava glaze.
Smelling the fresh flowers
Edible flower decorations can range from a simple marigold, zinnia, or
chrysanthemum popping out of the middle of a Bundt cake to mounds of
roses and violets climbing trellis-like up a five-tier wedding cake.
Although some flowers are edible, I recommend that you use them only for
decoration.
Regardless of whether guests will be munching on floral decorations or just
admiring them, the flowers you use on a cake should always be pesticide-free. 
To be safe, you should either buy them from a trusted source or use ones that
you or someone you know has grown personally so that you know firsthand that

they’re safe. You don’t want anyone getting sick from the residue left on the cake
by the flowers you selected. Fortunately, if you don’t have the time or space to
grow them yourself, it’s fairly easy to find organic flowers that fit the bill.
Considering floral options
You have a wide range of “safe” flowers to consider for your cake, including:
 Apple blossoms
 Carnations
 Cornflowers
 Daisies
 Gardenias
 Gladioli
 Hibiscuses
 Honeysuckle
 Lavender
 Lilacs
 Marigolds
 Nasturtiums
 Pansies
 Passionflowers
 Petunias
 Roses
 Sunflowers
 Violets
If you know of a flower that you really want on your cake, do some research
on it first to determine whether it’s food-safe. For instance, lily of the valley
is beautiful and has a lovely scent, but it’s also poisonous.
Poisonous (though beautiful) flowers include:
 Hyacinths
 Hydrangeas
 Lilies of the valley
 Morning glories
 Sweet peas
 Wisteria
162
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

If you’re determined to have poisonous flowers play a starring role on your
cake, recreate them in frosting, gum paste, or marzipan. They’ll be more 
awesome than the real thing because they’ll be safe!
Keeping flowers perky
You may need to keep the flowers on your cake hydrated, especially if your
cake will be on display for a while before it’s eaten. You have two options:
 Cut a 3-inch piece of a drinking straw, and tape one end closed. Fill the
straw with water, and then place the flower’s stem inside.
 Purchase flower holders or spikes from a floral or cake decorating supply
company. You fill these holders with water and insert the flower stems.
With both options, you can press the hydration station into the cake and
then insert flowers, or you may choose to insert flowers into the holders and
then lay them on the surface of the cake, arranging them so that blooms art-
fully cover the holders.
Use flowers in tiered cakes that feature separators. Fill the space between the
layers with flowers, arranging them so that the blooms are all you see.
Getting a bit nutty
Decorating with fruits and flowers means that you have to follow a few rules,
but you don’t have to be quite as picky with nuts. No matter the presentation,
nuts add both flavor and presence. If you’re not familiar with different nutty
tastes, spend some time conducting a taste test to sample and appreciate the
myriad possibilities you have.
Pair nuts with flavored cakes. Macadamia nuts taste delicious with banana
cake, walnuts and carrot cake make a great team, and pecans and bourbon
cake are a natural combination. As for peanuts, they’re great with brownie
cake, but their strong flavor means they don’t work well with other flavored
cakes such as lemon, mint, or spice.
Some kinds of nuts that you’re sure to find in multiple ready-to-use forms
(shelled, whole, sliced, chopped, and even slivered) include
 Almonds
 Cashews
 Hazelnuts (also known as filberts)
 Macadamia nuts
 Peanuts
163
Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

 Pecans
 Walnuts
Whole, sliced, chopped, or slivered?
Whether you’re working with whole or sliced nuts, you can fan them out
on the top of a cake or apply them to the sides. With chopped nuts, you can
sprinkle them in a pattern on the top of a cake (for example, you may place
them inside a stencil or cookie cutter) or press them onto the sides. You 
can use slivered nuts similarly. The most commonly found slivered nuts 
are almonds, which are usually blanched and slivered. If you want to use 
slivered almonds, buy them that way; preparing them would be difficult and
time-consuming.
If you’re using whole nuts, such as pecans or walnuts, make sure that they’re
in good, unblemished shape, and aren’t chipped or streaked in some way.
Similarly, if you’re decorating with sliced or slivered nuts (such as almonds),
only use full, complete slices or slivers; keep those that are chipped or broken
out of your design.
If you decide to use chopped nuts and opt to do the chopping yourself rather
than buy them ready-to-use, prepare them in a consistent size. When you’re
working with a lot of nuts, it’s best to chop them in batches. Make sure that
the size matches throughout each nut batch, and don’t combine your chopped
batches until you’re happy with the size of the nuts in each batch. Pick out
any bigger pieces while the quantities are still small.
Go easy on yourself
Don’t add to your cake decorating work by using nuts that have to be cracked,
skinned, shelled, or otherwise prepared. Find ones that are ready to place on
your cake or that need only to be chopped. When you have to spend time
roasting and rubbing skins off hazelnuts, for example, your prep time
increases, taking away from the time you have to decorate.
Modeling with Marzipan
Marzipan is an almond paste that you can use to cover entire cakes, but 
generally, it’s more commonly formed into embellishments and decorations.
I love working with marzipan: I find it fun, rewarding, and even therapeutic to
mold it into all sorts of fascinating shapes and decorations.
Made from ground almonds, marzipan also has a great taste. It’s an embellish-
ment cake eaters enjoy diving into. You can make your own marzipan, but it’s
readily available at most grocery stores on the baking aisle. (It’s usually sold
in 7-ounce tubes.)

Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments
Marzipan
This recipe for homemade marzipan requires you to get your hands dirty, so roll up
your sleeves. Plus, if you like, you can get kids to join in on the marzipan merriment.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 pounds
16 ounces almond paste
1⁄3 cup pasteurized egg white
1⁄2 teaspoon almond extract
4 cups confectioners’ sugar
1 In a large bowl, use your fingers to break up the almond paste into small chunks.
2 In a separate bowl, sift the confectioners’ sugar; set aside 3⁄4 cup for use when kneading
the marzipan.
3 Stir the almond paste into the sugar, and make a well in the center of the mixture.
4 In a small bowl, combine the egg white and almond extract; pour into the well in the
almond paste and sugar mixture. Stir until well mixed.
5 Sprinkle your work surface with a little of the reserved confectioners’ sugar, and turn
out the almond mixture. Knead the mixture, adding more sugar as needed to prevent
sticking, until the marzipan is smooth and pliable.
Simple techniques: Coloring and cutting
With just a few drops of a coloring gel or paste, it’s easy to tint the neutral
color of marzipan. The best way to color marzipan’s neutral shade is to break
off a chunk of marzipan to work with, dip a clean toothpick into your coloring
gel or paste, and poke the toothpick into the marzipan. Roll the marzipan
between your fingertips and against your palm, kneading it to evenly distrib-
ute the color.
When kneading color into marzipan, spread a little vegetable shortening on your
fingertips if you find that the marzipan is sticking to your fingers too much.
Easy ways to decorate with colored marzipan (or uncolored, for that matter),
are rolling it into balls (all the same size, or different sizes for interest) or flat-
tening it out and cutting out different shapes.
To cut shapes from marzipan, use a nonstick rolling pin on a clean work sur-
face and roll the marzipan out to a thickness of 1⁄8 inch. Press cookie cutters
into the marzipan just as you would into cookie dough. If the cookie cutters
stick to the marzipan, rub their insides with a little vegetable oil. In a sense,

marzipan is much like cookie dough in that you can make the most out of it
by gathering the scraps and rolling them out over and over.
Advanced techniques: Modeling
After you play around with marzipan a bit and become comfortable with its
texture, working with it becomes increasingly easier. Marzipan is particularly
easy to sculpt because it’s soft enough to shape and pieces of it stick together
very easily.
You can sculpt many shapes and figures simply with your fingers. My favorite —
and probably the most common — are marzipan fruits and vegetables. But once
you have the hang of it, no shape is off-limits! I’ve seen marzipan Easter eggs,
Halloween ghosts, Christmas stockings, and even golf balls and gift-wrapped
boxes. One of my favorite marzipan creations is an avocado!
When you start modeling marzipan, have the actual object you’re trying to
recreate in front of you (or a picture of it, if you can’t get your hands on the
real thing). For example, if you want to make a marzipan strawberry, have
a real strawberry in front of you to refer to and examine as you work. Your
effort will be so much better for it! Although you undoubtedly know what an
orange or pumpkin or rose looks like, you’ll look at it differently when you
have to recreate it through food sculpting.
Several tools can help you in your marzipan modeling. What you use really
depends on how fancy, intricate, or detailed you want your creations to be,
but here are some of the most basic tools:
 Coloring pastes or gels
 Deviled egg plate: Use it as your palette if you’re working with several
different colors
 Nonstick rolling pin
 Metal (preferably) or plastic cutters in round or leaf shapes
 Veining tool: Has curved, sharp ends that allow you to both sculpt and
craft detail work on an object’s surface
 Umbrella tool: Has a rocket tail–shaped point to make lifelike impressions
at the top of certain fruits and vegetables, like where leaves would come
out of an apple, for example
 Craft knife: Scores the surface of vegetable shapes
 Small grater: Leaves fine imprints on the surface of a shape
166
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

If you think you’re not ready to take on marzipan but would like to work on
your shapes, practice with a very accessible — and very unintimidating —
substance: kids’ modeling clay.
The following instructions for creating vegetables and fruits allow you to
transform marzipan into stunning cake decorations. Remember: Many of
these shapes begin simply with a small ball of colored marzipan.
Tomato
Roll a piece of red marzipan into a ball, squash the ball slightly to give it a
plump, oval shape, and score the sides, as shown in Figure 12-1. For the top
of the tomato, roll out some green marzipan. Use a small star-shaped cutter
or cut a star with a craft knife or paring knife, and affix the piece to the top of
the tomato.
Carrot
Roll a piece of orange marzipan into a tapered cone shape. Use the craft knife
to make hash marks on the sides of the carrot. Roll out a piece of green marzi-
pan, and cut out a large leaf shape (see Figure 12-1). Use the knife to make
cuts all around the leaf’s perimeter to resemble the dainty fronds that top a
carrot.
Figure 12-1:
A marzipan
tomato 
and carrot.
167
Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

Pumpkin
Roll out a ball of orange marzipan, and score the sides with a craft knife. Create
a pumpkin vine by rolling green marzipan into a spaghetti strand thickness
and coil it around a bamboo skewer that’s been dusted with confectioners’
sugar to prevent sticking. You can also add leaves to the vine by pinching
small balls of green marzipan into tiny leaf shapes and affixing them to the
vine and to the top of the pumpkin.
Lettuce head
Begin with a pea-sized ball of green marzipan. Roll out another piece of green
marzipan and cut out several small pieces in the shape of small rose petals.
One at a time, wrap the petal-shaped pieces around the ball to create a layered
effect.
Strawberry
Roll a ball of red marzipan between your hands to form a strawberry shape —
wide at one end tapering to a rounded point at the other end. Press the sides
of the strawberry into a small food grater to give it the look of seeds. For the
strawberry cap, cut three small triangles out of green marzipan, and affix them
to the top.
Blackberry
Roll out a ball of deep purple marzipan, and break off little pieces one at a time
to make several tiny balls. Press them together gently into a berry shape.
Make a stem out of a tiny rectangle of green marzipan, and press it into the
blackberry’s top.
Working with Gum Paste
Gum paste is a malleable substance that can be crafted into a variety of decora-
tions. Most likely, you’ve seen gum paste in the form of flowers on top of wed-
ding cakes. Although edible, unlike marzipan, gum paste doesn’t taste very
good at all, so it’s definitely the sort of decoration that should be admired but
not consumed. Gum paste can be stored indefinitely, so decorations can be
kept as mementos to commemorate an event.
You can make gum paste from scratch with only a few specialty ingredients,
but most cake decorators opt to purchase ready-made gum paste from baking
supply and craft stores.
168
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

Although you can transform gum paste into any number of objects, flowers
are the most popular gum paste creation. Though difficult to master, gum
paste gives you complete control over the kinds of flowers you can decorate
your cake with as well as the colors of those flowers. So although you can’t
put the poisonous lily of the valley on a cake, you can use gum paste stems of
them. Or if real dogwood blossoms aren’t available in your area, you can still
decorate with them through the magic of gum paste.
To be honest, gum paste can present quite a challenge for cake decorators.
Although the end product looks intricate, beautiful, and life-like, getting there
takes a lot of practice, patience, and dedication to perfection. Working with
gum paste is time-intensive, so unless you’ve become highly proficient, don’t
expect to whip up an entire cake’s worth of flowers quickly.
Some of the more popular gum paste floras used in cake decorating include:
 Calla lilies
 Carnations
 Daisies
 Ferns
 Forget-me-nots
 Freesia
 Gardenias
 Ivy
 Leaves
 Lilies of the valley
 Lisianthus
 Orchids
 Roses
 Stargazer lilies
 Stephanotis
 Sweet peas

Gum Paste
Whether you just want to play around and get some flower-making practice in or you’re
ready to tackle decorations for a special cake, try this recipe for homemade gum paste.
It calls for a specialty ingredient, gum tragacanth, that’s widely available in some outlets
of national craft store chains as well as cake decorating supply stores and Web sites.
Preparation time: 15 minutes plus overnight for the paste to mature
Yield: 1 pound
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1⁄4 cup warm water
1 tablespoon gum tragacanth (also known by
the brand name Gum-Tex)
4 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar, divided
1 In a medium saucepan, heat the corn syrup and water over low heat until just warm.
2 In a medium bowl, combine the gum tragacanth with 1 cup of confectioners’ sugar.
Remove the corn syrup mixture from the heat, and stir in the sugar mixture.
3 Turn the contents out onto your work surface. Gradually knead in the remaining confec-
tioners’ sugar until your paste is pliable and not sticky.
4 Store the gum paste in a plastic bag overnight to let it mature to the right consistency
before you work with it.
If gum paste intrigues you but you’re not ready to commit to working with it
just yet, you can purchase many kinds of gum paste flowers at bakeries and
baking supply stores. Select some premade flowers, examine and inspect
them close-up, and note the detail on petals, stamens, and leaves. Then figure
out the best way to place them to dress up a cake, and see if you like the look
and aura.
Tooling around with gum paste
Whether you’ve made your own gum paste or bought some ready-made, you
have a variety of tools at your disposal to craft flowers out of. (Keep in 
mind that many of these also come in handy for marzipan molding.)
 Food coloring gels or pastes: You use these to tint the gum paste to a
desired shade.
 Cutters: You can rely on a wide range of plastic or metal cutters to help
you achieve a realistic look and design. Some cutters are the actual shapes
of flowers whereas others are petal-shaped.

 Tools: Five tools come in handy for a host of shaping techniques. They’re
all about 6 inches long and are usually plastic, pencil-shaped, and easy
to grip (see Figure 12-2). They are
• Dogbone: Pressing this tool, which has a rounded hook on the end,
into gum paste makes a petal look open.
• Ball: This tool has a small, hard ball on the end that you can use to
cup or smooth out a petal.
• Veining: This tool, which tapers off to sharp points on each end,
works nicely for drawing a leaf’s veins.
• Shell: This tool has a scalloped end with which to imprint lines on
flowers.
• Umbrella: You can insert this sharp-pointed tool into the gum paste
for scoring, forming buds, and imprinting veins.
 Foam mat: You set your gum paste on a foam mat to make it easier to
sculpt with the tools. (You can even use a gardener’s kneeling pad or a
computer mouse pad.)
 Adhesive: Although you have a number of adhesive options for holding
gum paste designs together, pasteurized egg white is a good choice. For
another adhesive, dissolve 1⁄4 teaspoon gum paste in 1 tablespoon water.
 Heavy-gauge wire: Wire allows you to spear the bud you’re working on
to attach petals to the flower.
 Petal dusts: These are highly concentrated powdered colors that you can
apply to your gum paste flowers after they’re dry. Dusts make flowers
look more realistic.
 Paint brushes: You need one brush to apply adhesive to gum paste
pieces. In addition, craft paintbrushes in a range of sizes help you in
applying petal dust in both large and small spaces.

Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

Assembling and coloring 
gum paste flowers
Some cake decorators adamantly steer clear of gum paste, always opting for
fresh flowers instead and arguing that those made of gum paste are too artifi-
cial. Although I understand their point, it’s easy to marvel at flowers that look
so real but have been sculpted out of a foodstuff.
To make a wide variety of different kinds of gum paste flowers, you start with
the same basic steps. For almost every kind of flower, follow these steps:
1. Dust your work surface with cornstarch.
2. Tint a small amount of gum paste if you want the flower to be a certain
color.
Use a toothpick to dab the color into the gum paste. Then knead the color
in (drop by drop) until you achieve your desired shade.
3. Using a (preferably) nonstick roller, roll out the gum paste to a paper-
thin (1⁄16 inch) thickness.
Have a large glass bowl turned over and standing by so that you can put
gum paste you’re not working with at the moment underneath it to keep
the gum paste from drying out.
4. Using the appropriate cutter, cut the entire flower (such as a daisy or
dogwood blossom) or the petals (such as for a rose or carnation) that
you need to form the bloom. Simply press the cutter down hard, and
lift it straight up; don’t twist it back and forth to release the shape.
5. Place your shape(s) on a foam pad.
6. With the appropriate tools (refer to the preceding section), shape the
flower’s petals or leaves.
7. Set the shape on a piece of parchment paper to dry and harden.
8. When dry, use a brush to dust the shapes with petal dusts — if desired —
to accent their details and make them look more realistic.
If you’re adding stamens, sepals (the little green bits under the petals), stems,
or other greenery, prepare those items out of gum paste just as you do the
petals and leaves and then apply them with adhesive (usually pasteurized
egg white).
Lilies and roses are two flower varieties that require some special work to
grow out of gum paste. The following sections walk you through the specifics
of crafting these flowers.

Lilies
Although it may look complicated, this flower is surprisingly easy to make
with gum paste. Just follow these steps, and check out Figure 12-3:
1. Tint the gum paste to your desired shade (or buy some already 
colored).
2. Roll the gum paste out to a thickness of 1⁄16 inch. With a cutter or small
paring knife, cut out five leaf-shaped petals that are 21⁄4 inches long, 3⁄4
inch wide at the center, and taper at the ends.
3. Wad up a small piece of aluminum foil into a tall cone shape. Sprinkle
cornstarch on the foil (so that the finished lily doesn’t stick to it), and
place a small ball of colored gum paste (the same color as the lily) at
the top of the cone. Use a pastry brush to cover the ball with pasteur-
ized egg white.
4. Affix the petals to the ball one at a time, overlapping them slightly
and making sure that they stick to the ball. In the overlapping, use a
bit of egg white to make the petals unfurl from each other. Bend the
petals slightly outward at the bottom of the cone so that it looks like
the flower is opening when it is inverted.
5. Let the lily dry on the aluminum cone for 24 hours before gently twist-
ing it off.
6. Adhere artificial stamens, which are available at craft stores, to the
ball inside the lily, or sculpt some out of thin white ropes of gum paste
with tiny yellow or brown spheres attached to one end.
7. Attach the stamens to the ball either by inserting them into a few dots
of royal icing piped onto the ball or by lightly brushing the ball with
egg white and sticking them to it.
Roses
The most popular gum paste cake flower is also probably the most difficult to
make, so be patient with the process. Your persistence will pay off, I promise!
For a single rose, you need the following materials: gum paste, four sizes of
petal cutters (small, medium, large, and extra large), a dogbone tool, pasteur-
ized egg white, and a 6-inch length of 24-gauge wire. The following steps and
Figure 12-4 outline the procedure:
1. Tint the gum paste as desired.
2. Shape a small ball of paste into a miniature cone that’s approximately
11⁄2 inches wide at its base and 1⁄4 inch wide at its top point.
3. Make a hook at one end of the 6-inch length of wire, and insert it into
the base of the gum paste cone, driving it up almost to the tip. Let this
dry and harden for 24 hours.
173
Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

4. Roll out a small piece of gum paste, and cut two petals out of it with a
small cutter. Soften their edges with a dogbone tool.
5. With a little egg white, attach the first petal to one side of the cone,
wrapping it halfway around the cone. Holding the wire, twist the cone
to your right (if you’re right-handed; work the other way if you’re left-
handed), and attach the second petal so that it’s slightly higher than
the first petal and overlaps the first petal’s edge. Molding these two
petals around the tip of the cone creates the center of the rose.
6. Cut three medium size petals out of the gum paste, and soften their
edges. Attach each one to the first layer of petals with some egg white,
overlapping them slightly on the sides such that the first petal is tucked
inside the second petal and the second inside the third. Pinch the tops
of the petal outward a bit to resemble a rose in full bloom.
7. Repeat Step 6 with four large petals, then with five extra large petals,
and finally with five more extra large petals. When you’re done, five
layers of petals should surround the cone.
8. Dry the entire rose overnight.

Tending to Frosting Roses
Making roses with frosting requires a certain level of comfort in handling a
pastry bag, which I cover in Chapter 11. However, with just a bit of practice,
you’ll get the hang of it and be well on your way to making beautiful roses for
your cakes.
I always encourage aspiring cake decorators to take a close look at a real rose
before they begin piping one. Even though a frosting rose isn’t the most life-like
representation of the actual thing, getting an idea of a rose’s natural form will
help you create a sweet replica.
Nailing the form
The easiest way to start crafting a rose out of frosting is to affix a small marzi-
pan cone onto a flower nail, which basically looks like a long nail with a large,
Figure 12-4:
Making 
a gum 
paste rose.
175
Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

flat head. Outfit a pastry bag with frosting (tinted to the color of rose you
want) and a #104 icing tip, which has a big, curved end that tapers to a point
at the bottom, follow these steps and check out Figure 12-5.
1. Hold your pastry bag in your right hand so that the thin end of the
icing tip faces upwards at a 45-degree angle, and hold the flower nail
in your left hand.
If you’re left-handed, hold the pastry bag in your left hand and the flower
nail in your right.
2. Mound some frosting at the top of the marzipan cone, and rotate the
nail as you pipe around the cone to form the center of the rose.
3. Begin the petals by piping just below the rose’s center, turning the nail
as you make horseshoe-shaped motions with the pastry bag. Make three
petals in this manner.
4. Add petals in odd numbers for succeeding rows. Make sure to begin
each row in the middle of one of the existing petals to create an over-
lapping, blooming effect, and start each new row of petals below the
preceding row.
5. When you’ve achieved the size and fullness you want, insert the nail
into a piece of foam to keep it upright while the frosting dries and
hardens, about 1 hour.
Figure 12-5:
Piping a

rose.
176
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

If your rose looks smashed or flat, your initial cone may not have been high
enough to accommodate the layers of petals. If the petals are too skinny,
you may have held your frosting bag too close to the rose as you piped your
petals, creating a more vertical look. If your petals are squiggly, you may have
squeezed the bag too hard. Make the necessary adjustments when piping
your next rose.
If you don’t want your rose to have a marzipan center or you simply don’t have
any marzipan, put a 2-x-2-inch piece of wax paper on the nail head. Using the
#104 icing tip and holding the pastry bag at a 90-degree angle, mound a cone
of frosting on the wax paper, and then follow the regular steps covered in this
section. After the rose hardens, you can lift it off the wax paper and place on
your cake.
Skipping the nail and going 
straight for the cake
When you feel confident in your ability to maneuver a pastry bag to create a
frosting rose, you can pipe roses directly on the cake. Start by piping a mound
of frosting with the #104 tip. Then follow the steps in the preceding section
for making a rose on a marzipan cone or wax paper.
Consider piping other kinds of flowers directly onto the cake, too. For instance,
piping a sunflower or daisy on a cake is fairly easy. For a large daisy, use a
#69 icing tip, which is curved. With the curved end facing up, start in the
center of the cake and draw the frosting petal outward, releasing pressure on
the pastry bag so that the petal narrows to a point. Repeat this all around the
cake. With a #3 icing tip and frosting in a contrasting color, pipe small dots in
the center of the daisy to resemble a stamen.
Make the process of piping flowers onto the cake easier by putting your cake
on a turntable. It allows you to pipe the petals more fluidly and also spin the
cake easily when determining the best placement for flowers.
Dipping into the Candy Jar
Whether your goal is to fashion a totally edible experience for your guests or
simply to get creative with your decorating, candies and other edible foodstuffs
provide limitless possibilities for making everything from a tile mosaic to
train wheels, from jewels in a treasure chest to picnic paraphernalia on the
beach.
I enjoy conceiving a design and then trying to figure out how to make it work
using different and often unexpected edibles. For instance, I discovered a
177
Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

completely sweet and edible way to make a rose out of a lollipop surrounded
by chewing gum petals. And sometimes I see a new kind of candy and find
myself inspired to build a cake around that!
Try to look at candy and foodstuffs differently. You never know what could
become the shape or foundation for a cake design you’re working on!
Simple but sublime options
The easiest and most common decorations are sparkles, nonpareils, and jim-
mies. They jazz up a cake in a jiffy. But rather than just scatter them on top,
give some form and function to your decoration by placing them inside a
cookie cutter, pressing them into the sides of the cake, or using them to fill
in a design. You also can use them to highlight or outline other designs.
Candies
In addition to adding color and interest to your cake, candies are great for
spelling out numbers and names, or you can reinvent them as all sorts of
objects and object parts. Consider these different applications of easy-to-
find candies:
 Peppermints can be pinwheels.
 Gumdrops can be little caps and hats, blinking lights, or the centers of
flowers. You can also roll them out and cut or form them into different
shapes.
 Necco wafers can be a mermaid’s scales or roof tiles on house.
 Jawbreakers can be beach balls.
 Whips or shoestring licorice can be animal whiskers, railroad tracks, or
eyelashes.
 Jelly beans can be jewelry. They look especially good as the gemstone
in a frosting ring or pendants on a necklace.
Online vendors such as www.groovycandies.com and www.candyware
house.com offer an amazing variety of specialty candies; if you have an idea
for a decoration but aren’t sure what candy to use, they may have just the
kind, color, and shape of candy you’re looking for.
For a lot of cake designs, you don’t need much candy to get the right look.
If that’s the case for your design, visit a bulk candy store to get just a few
pieces of a favorite treat or just pick up the small packages or boxes of
candy in a grocery store’s check-out aisle.
178
Part III: Topping, Filling, and Embellishing Your Creations 

Confections
In addition to candy, a plethora of other sweets offer a variety of options for
your cake decorating adventures. Consider these possibilities for a scene or
object you’re trying to create:
 Marshmallows can be pillows or soapsuds.
 Squares of gum can be floor tiles or bases on a baseball field.
 Wafer rolls can be fences.
 Doughnuts can be tires or inner tubes.
 Cotton candy can be clouds or a ballerina’s tutu.
 Crushed cookies can be dirt, sand, a racetrack, or a ball field.
 Coconut can be unruly hair (if it’s tinted) or snow (if it’s not).
 Fruit-striped gum can be fashioned into surfboards, snowboards, skis,
pennants, and license plates.
Other treats
Don’t stop at the stuff you find only in the sweet shop. The supermarket is
overflowing with opportunities to craft and create. Consider these ideas:
 Ice cream cones can be castles, princess hats, or cornucopia shapes.
 Pretzel sticks can be ladders or flag poles.
 Graham teddy bears, animal crackers, and gummi bears add a lively
animal presence to a scene.
 Raw sugar or brown sugar can be a beach shore.
 Flavored gelatin can be pool water (blue) or lava running down the side
of a mountain (red).
 Fruit tape can be fashioned into a pet’s collar, a necklace, or leather
straps on a treasure chest.
Choosing Inedible Features
When it comes to outfitting a cake for an event, by no means are you limited
to the packaged offerings of cake decorating supply companies. For some
events, parties, and celebrations, you may find that the most appropriate
cake decorations aren’t edible — and that’s okay. The great thing about cake
179
Chapter 12: Enhancing with Embellishments

decorating is that you’re free to expand your horizons occasionally or often
and include cake decorations that are for show rather than taste.
When you’re working with inedible decorations, make sure that you clean
them thoroughly before placing them on the cake. Also, if you know that chil-
dren will be at the party or event, make sure that you (or the party’s host or
hostess) remove all inedible features before cutting and serving the cake.
Toy stores and toy departments at chain stores are brimming with items that
make excellent cake toppers. For example, if your cake is for an aspiring action
hero’s birthday, check out action figures, which can serve double-duty as dec-
orations and gifts. For one aquarium-themed cake I made, I was hard-pressed
to find edible sea animal decorations. When I thought outside the box, I went
to a toy store and found a large plastic tube filled with a variety of plastic
whales, seals, octopuses, and fish.
Don’t forget to check the Internet and flea markets for unconventional cake
decorations. Consider wedding cakes: Some engaged couples insist on vin-
tage cake toppers and won’t settle for reproductions; the Internet is one of
the best resources for such items. In another example, I was hired to make a
cake with a 1960s-era home theme for a housewarming party, and the thought
of creating furniture out of gum paste or frosting seemed tedious. Plus, I wasn’t
sure that the results would sparkle with a sense of fun. Instead, I found mod,
colorful dollhouse furniture on the Internet, which turned the dessert into a
conversation piece!
The only limit to embellishing your cake is your imagination: Gather inspiration
from shapes, sizes, foods, treats, themes, and nature as you turn your creation
into a one-of-a-kind design.

Conceiving the Perfect Birthday Cake
When you’re faced with creating a cake for a child’s or teen’s birthday, it’s
important to remember that your cake becomes more special when it truly
takes into account the personality of the birthday boy or girl. If the child is
turning 1 or 2, it’s likely that you’re the one deciding the cake’s theme. But an
older child usually has a definite idea about the flavor and look of the cake he
or she wants you to create.
In thinking about baking and decorating the perfect cake for the occasion,
consider answers to these questions:
 What does the child like?
 What are his or her current interests, hobbies, or obsessions?
 What are his or her favorite colors?
 What is his or her favorite cake flavor?
Realistically, carving a cake into the shape of a favorite video game character,
a football helmet, a train, a floral teapot, or a cheerleading pom-pom seems a
bit intimidating. But you can always use a kid’s current likes as a great jumping-
off point. With a little ingenuity and a few common ingredients, you can turn the
top of a cake into a computer screen or make a pom-pom out of icing.
Kids’ cakes, more than any other themed cakes, challenge you to look at 
traditional circular and rectangular cake shapes in new and different ways.
Carving Cakes into the Shape 
of Numbers and Letters
One of the simplest ways to personalize a birthday cake is to carve the cake
(or cakes) into the shape of
 Numbers, to announce the age of a birthday celebrant
 Letters, to form initials or entire names
With a sharp knife and a diagram to follow, you’re on your way. Do assess the
cake prior to taking your knife to it, though. For instance, you may want to
use a toothpick or bamboo skewer to lightly mark your cutting lines. Figures
13-1 and 13-2 show how you can easily carve a cake up to be a number or a
letter of the alphabet.
184
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

Use a long, sharp knife to make the cuts, and have a tall glass or pitcher of
warm water nearby to dip your knife into if the cuts aren’t coming out cleanly.
If the letters you’re cutting have spaces such as the triangle in an A or the
horseshoe-shaped ovals in a B, P, or R, don’t worry about cutting out the
space if you feel like you’ll make a mess of it. You can insert all kinds of deco-
rations in the space instead, such as little candies, squares of chocolate, or
even real flower blooms.
You can personalize both number and letter cakes even more by
 Decorating them with favorite candies
 Sprinkling them with edible confetti
 Adding symbols of favorite hobbies or characters
 Creating special scenes with edible and inedible features
 Dressing them up with fresh flowers, fruits, or nuts

Theme Cakes Boys Go Nuts Over
In my experience making cakes for kids’ birthday parties, I’ve noticed that
boys tend to be partial to the same sorts of cake designs: Action heroes,
moving vehicles like race cars, trucks, tractors, and motorcycles, and sports
of all kinds usually get the greatest reactions from boys.
Following are two of my most favorite designs to make for boys’ birthday 
parties.
187
Chapter 13: Festive Cakes for Kids
Play Ball! Baseball Cake
A sheet cake provides the perfect playing field for several sports. In this recipe, with the
help of some frosting “grass,” chocolate candies, crushed graham crackers, and some
action figures, you can transform an everyday cake into a baseball fan’s paradise.
Note: Creating the grass and the blue ball trim around the base of the cake requires a
great deal of frosting, so have a few batches ready for coloring.
Tools: 12-x-18-inch cake pan, #3 icing tip, #5 icing tip, #11 icing tip, #133 icing tip
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 50 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 1 hour plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings 
For the cake (recipe follows):
2 batches Cocoa Chocolate Cake batter (see
Chapter 6)
11⁄2 cups miniature chocolate chips
For the frosting:
3 batches Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
Leaf green food coloring gel
Royal blue food coloring gel
Brown food coloring gel
1⁄2 cup graham cracker crumbs
40 foil-wrapped milk chocolate baseballs
5 baseball figurines (batter, fielder, pitcher,
catcher, and umpire)

Making the Chocolate-Chocolate Chip Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the cake pan and line the bottom with parch-
ment paper. Set the pan aside.
2 Prepare the Cocoa Chocolate Cake batters as described in Chapter 6, and combine in
large bowl. Stir in the miniature chocolate chips.
3 Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 minutes, or until a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
4 Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edges, and invert the
cake onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
5 Level the top of the cake (see Chapter 7 for leveling instructions).
Decorating the cake
1 Cover the cake with a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
2 Add a second coat of frosting, and refrigerate the cake again for 1 hour.
3 Divide and tint the remaining frosting as follows: 3 cups leaf green, 2 cups royal blue,
and 1⁄2 cup brown. Leave the remaining frosting — approximately 1⁄4 cup — untinted to
use to pipe the bases.
4 On the cake’s top surface, use a toothpick to make a wide V: Start in the top left-hand
corner, draw a diagonal to the center of the bottom edge, and continue the line up to
end in the top right-hand corner of the cake. (The inside of the V will be the bottom half
of a baseball diamond; the area outside the V will be grassy areas.)
5 Use the #3 tip to outline the V with brown frosting.
6 Inside the V, use your smallest icing spatula to spread a very thin layer of untinted frost-
ing. Sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs on this layer of frosting to form the infield, and
pat them down.
7 If desired, pipe “Happy Birthday” or the boy’s name inside the baseball half-diamond with
the #5 tip. If you mess up, gently scrape off the piped frosting, sprinkle more graham
cracker crumbs, and try again.
8 Outside the V, use the #133 tip to pipe grass. Starting in the top left-hand corner of the
cake, pipe a giant L, moving the tip in a circular motion as you pipe. Pipe a smaller L
inside the first L, and repeat the process until you’ve filled in that side of the baseball
diamond. Repeat on the right-hand side of the V.
9 At the top two corners of the graham cracker infield and at the bottom of the V, use the
#11 tip to pipe 11⁄2-x-11⁄2-inch white squares to mark first base, third base, and home
plate.
10 Use the #11 tip to pipe little royal blue “balls” around the outside edge of the cake 
top, and around the base of the cake. (See Chapter 11 for tips on piping dots and ball
shapes.)
188
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

11 Press the foil-wrapped chocolate baseballs into the vertical sides of the cake. If they
don’t stick, dab a little frosting on them before placing them on the cake.
12 Dab some of the remaining frosting on the undersides of the baseball figurines, and
arrange them on the cake to create a winning scene like the one shown in Figure 13-3.

Other ideas for boys
Trains, rockets, pirate ships, bugs, and dinosaurs
are just a few other theme possibilities for
cakes guaranteed to please boys.
Don’t worry — you don’t have to create a 3-D
masterpiece. You can start out simply. Use
miniature loaf pans to create the perfect size
cakes for train cars, and affix cookies to the
bottom edge of each miniature cake to look like
wheels. If you’re going for a bug theme, cover
the top of a cake with crushed chocolate cook-
ies to look like dirt, and scatter gummi bugs and
worms for the full effect. You can even stick the
worms into the cake so that they look like
they’re crawling out!

“Have a Good Year” Race Car Cake
Boys in particular always seem to appreciate a car that zooms. I’ve found this race car
cake to be a favorite of boys from 5 to 15 years old — and piping the boy’s age on the
cake as the car’s number makes it even more memorable! Before kids dive in, they’re
sure to linger and appreciate all the different treats that make up the wheels, spoiler,
steering wheel, tailpipe, and headlights. This cake is shown on the second page of the
color section.
Tools: Two 9-x-13-inch cake pans, #5 icing tip, #7 icing tip, 8 toothpicks, 10-inch bamboo
skewer, long serrated knife, ruler
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 30 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 90 minutes plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake:
2 batches Delicious Yellow Cake batter (see
Chapter 6)
2 batches Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
For the frosting:
Royal blue food coloring gel
Electric blue food coloring gel
Red food coloring gel
7 strips striped sour fruit tape
4 chocolate doughnuts
5 small, vanilla yogurt–covered pretzels
4 chocolate kiss candies, wrapped
3 teaspoons honey
Lengthwise half of a 7-ounce chocolate bar
5 gumdrop candies (two yellow, two red, one
green)
2 red licorice whips
12 miniature marshmallows
For the decorations:
1 Prepare two Delicious Yellow Cakes following the recipe in Chapter 6. After the cakes
are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of
frosting to one of the cakes, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
2 Place the second cake squarely on top of the first cake.
3 Create the raised area for the spoiler and the slanted top of the race car. On one of the
short sides of the cake, measure 31⁄2 inches in from the edge, and lightly score the top of
the cake with a toothpick at that measurement. Measure 1⁄2 inch down from that point on
each side of the cake, and insert a toothpick on each side of the cake at that measure-
ment. With another toothpick, lightly score the cake diagonally from the first toothpick
to the bottom of the top layer of cake. Repeat on the other side of the cake. Using the

lines and toothpicks as your guide, use a serrated knife to cut away the top part of the
cake. Discard the cake that comes off with the diagonal cut.
4 Apply a crumb coat of frosting to the cake’s top layer and sides, and refrigerate the cake
for at least 1 hour. (If possible, refrigerate the cake overnight for best results.)
5 Tint 2 cups of frosting with equal parts royal blue and electric blue food coloring gel.
Frost the entire cake with the blue frosting.
6 Tint 11⁄2 cups of frosting with red food coloring gel. Use the #7 tip to outline the lines and
right angles of the car (the car’s base, the rectangles of the car’s sides, and the spoiler’s
resting place) with red frosting. Pipe a square in the center of the top of the car for the
driver’s seat. In front of the driver’s seat, pipe a big red circle for the car’s number to
rest on.
7 Affix two fruit tape strips to the sides of the car. Affix two more strips so that they run
down the top of the car. With red frosting, outline the strips on the top of the car.
8 Stick three toothpicks, evenly spaced, into each doughnut, and press them into the
sides of the cake to look like wheels. Dab some white frosting on 4 yogurt pretzels and
place them on the doughnuts to look like hubcaps.
9 Place the chocolate kisses — bottom-side out — side by side on the front end of the car
so that the bottoms of the kisses form double headlights. With the #5 tip, pipe a red rec-
tangle frame around each pair of headlights.
10 For the spoiler, spread honey on the back of 3 fruit tape strips and place them on the
half chocolate bar. Trim the strips to size. Cut two 3-inch pieces of red licorice, and
place a toothpick inside each piece. Gently push each toothpick into each side of the
chocolate bar. Affix the spoiler to the back end of the car, where you cut away a portion
of the cake in Step 3.
11 Decorate the 1⁄2-inch strip below the spoiler with the gumdrop candies.
12 For the tailpipe, cut a 2-inch piece of red licorice. Thread it onto the bamboo skewer,
followed by the miniature marshmallows. Stick the bamboo skewer into the back of the
race car, licorice end first.
13 For the steering wheel, gently press a yogurt-covered pretzel into the center square at
the top of the cake.
14 Either pipe the birthday boy’s age into the red circle made in Step 6, or gently press a
number-shaped candle into the red frosting circle on the top of the car.
Theme Cakes for Little Ladies
As with cakes for boys, I’ve been struck by how girls tend to gravitate toward
similar cake themes: Princesses, ballerinas, and dolls all make regular appear-
ances on birthday party cake tables when girls are running the show.

Ballerina Stage Cake
Give a girl a birthday stage to dream on with this ballerina scene. You can even redress
this stage for other themes; for example, use the same basic structure but showcase a
doll show or a Broadway hit. This cake is shown on the first page of the color section.
Tools: Three 9-inch round cake pans, #5 icing tip, #18 icing tip, 31⁄2-inch round plastic lid, 
3-inch round plastic lid
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 40 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 1 hour plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Yield: 20 servings
For the cake:
11⁄2 batches Most Excellent White Cake batter
(see Chapter 6)
For the frosting:
2 batches Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
1⁄4 cup unsalted butter
2 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1⁄4 cup seedless strawberry preserves
2 tablespoons whole milk
For the decorations:
Soft pink food coloring gel
Burgundy food coloring gel
8 pink hard-shelled candies or jelly beans
10 plastic ballerina figurines
Making the cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 9-inch cake pans.
2 Prepare the Most Excellent White Cake batter according to the recipe in Chapter 6.
Evenly distribute the batter among the three pans.
3 Place the pans in the oven, making sure that they have at least 1 inch of space in between
them. Rotate them once during baking to make sure they bake evenly. Bake for 30 min-
utes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
4 Let the cakes cool in their pans for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edges, and invert
them onto cooling racks to cool completely.
5 After the cakes are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7).

Preparing the Strawberry Buttercream Frosting
1 Combine the butter, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and strawberry preserves in the
bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on low speed until the mixture starts to come together.
2 Gradually add the milk, continuing to beat on low speed, until the frosting takes on a
creamy consistency.
Decorating the cake
1 Cut one layer in half to form two semicircles. Line up the semicircles to form a semicir-
cle of double thickness. Trim the cut sides to make them equal and uniform, if necessary.
Sandwich the two semicircles together with strawberry buttercream frosting, and set
the cake aside.
2 Spread strawberry frosting on the top of one of the other cake layers, and place the
third cake layer on top.
3 Spread strawberry buttercream on half of the top of the double-layer cake. Place the
semicircular cake on that frosting, arranging the semi-circular cake so that the rounded
side aligns with the rounded edge of the two-layer cake. This forms the stage backdrop.
4 Spread a crumb coat (thin layer) of white buttercream frosting over the cake and the
backdrop. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
5 Spread a second, thicker layer of white buttercream over the entire cake and backdrop.
Refrigerate for 1 hour.
6 Divide and tint the remaining white buttercream as follows: 2 cups soft pink and 11⁄2
cups burgundy.
7 Outfit a pastry bag with a #18 tip and pink buttercream, pipe pink stars around the base
of the cake, the front edge of the stage, and the top of the backdrop. (Refer to Chapter
11 for further information on piping stars.)
8 Make the curtains on either side of the backdrop. On the left side of the backdrop, use a
toothpick to mark where the drapes would fall on each side (refer to the photograph in
the color insert); your mark should look like a letter K that begins three-quarters of the
way down from the top of the backdrop. Using the #5 tip and the burgundy frosting,
hold the pastry bag at a 45-degree angle and pipe curved thick lines along your mark 
to resemble the curtains’ folds going inward and then curving down to the base of the
stage. Pipe a band where the upper and lower arcs meet to resemble a tieback. Repeat
the whole process on the right side of the backdrop (the shape on this side is a back-
wards K).
9 Make the cornice of curtains at the top of the stage. Divide the area into thirds and
mark each point with a toothpick. Using the #5 tip and the burgundy frosting, pipe a
large semicircle between the first and second marks, making the swag as low as you
want the curtain to hang. Fill in the swag with increasingly smaller semicircles. Repeat
in the other two thirds of the curtain area.
10 Using half of a 31⁄2-inch round plastic lid as a guide, imprint semicircles around the verti-
cal surface of the two-layer cake to form swags around the circumference of the cake.
193
Chapter 13: Festive Cakes for Kids

Repeat with half of a 3-inch plastic lid, setting the smaller semicircles inside the bigger
semicircles.
11 Use the #5 tip and burgundy icing to pipe along both sets of swag markings.
12 Press a pink hard-shelled candy or jelly bean into the meeting place of each set of swags.
13 Dab white frosting on the underside of the ballerina figurines. Arrange them in rows on
the stage in front of the backdrop.

“You’re a Real Doll” Cake
This cake never fails to impress kids and adults alike because the cake actually forms
the dress of a fashion doll. You may find other versions of this recipe that call for shav-
ing the cake in a certain way to form the dress or baking a cake in a round bowl (which 
I find makes for a hard cake to cut!) to get the right shape. I’ve found that a Bundt pan
and two 9-inch round pans work beautifully to give me the shape I need.
Other than the doll, you don’t need any other accoutrements to make this cake special —
just lots of frosting. And be prepared to go through lots of it! Because it takes a bit of
time to create all the rows of frosting that decorate the dress, this recipe calls for stiff
buttercream frosting. After all, you don’t want the dress pattern to droop while you
work! This cake is shown on the first page of the color section.
Tools: Two 9-inch round cake pans, 12-cup traditional Bundt pan, #30 icing tip, #35 icing
tip, plastic wrap, long serrated knife
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 2 hours plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake:
2 batches Delicious Yellow Cake batter (see
Chapter 6)
For the frosting:
4 batches Stiff Decorator Frosting (see
Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
11-inch tall fashion doll
Deep pink food coloring gel
Orange food coloring gel

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 9-inch pans and the Bundt pan,
and set aside.
2 Prepare two batches of Delicious Yellow Cake following the recipe in Chapter 6. Put one
batch in the Bundt cake pan, and divide the other batch into the two 9-inch round pans.
3 Bake the two rounds according to the recipe, and bake the Bundt cake for 50 minutes.
After the rounds are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7). Let the Bundt cake
cool completely, but don’t level it.
4 Sandwich the two round layers together with a layer of frosting, and spread a layer of
frosting on the top layer. Then place the Bundt cake on top. Apply a crumb coat (thin
layer) of frosting to the entire cake, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. (If possible,
refrigerate the cake overnight for best results.)
5 Using the open circle of the Bundt cake as your guide, cut a circle out of the center of
the layered cake below. Pull this cake out (you may need to use a serving spoon).
Reserve the scraps.
6 Frost the cake again with a thin layer of frosting, and refrigerate for 1 hour
7 Raise the doll’s arms and wrap plastic around her arms and hair. Place the doll into the
center hole of the cake. To keep her centered and in place, insert cut-up scraps from
Step 5 in the open space. Frost around the doll to create a smooth, complete surface for
your decorating.
8 Divide and tint the remaining frosting as follows: 4 cups deep pink and 4 cups orange.
9 Outfit a pastry bag with a #35 tip and pink frosting. Starting at the front of the doll, pipe
three rows of pink stars (see Chapter 11) down the front of the cake dress. I like to pipe
the rows at a diagonal to make it look like the dress is swirling, but if it’s easier (or more
preferable) for you, you can simply pipe in straight lines down the front of the dress.
10 Outfit a pastry bag with a #30 tip and orange frosting. Pipe three rows of orange stars
on either side of the pink stripe. Continue piping three-row stripes around the dress,
alternating the frosting color with each row.
11 Using the #30 tip, pipe a band of orange frosting around the doll’s waistline.
12 Using the #35 tip and pink frosting, create the ruffled layers of the dress’s bodice by
piping horizontally around the doll, moving the tip up and down as you go. Finish by
frosting pink straps over the doll’s shoulders.
13 Remove the plastic wrap from the doll’s head and arms.
14 To finish the dress, pipe a ring of orange stars or waves around the base of the cake.
Vary It!: Definitely play into your celebrant’s favorite colors by selecting whichever color
combination most appeals to her, or use colors that fit the party’s theme. If you’re not sure
or have many favorite colors to choose from, play around with different combinations to
determine which ones look best together.

Down on the Farm Cake
This darling cake is sure to be a hit with both city and country folk. (And the farm fig-
urines make quick work of the decoration.)
Tools: Two 9-inch round cake pans, decorating comb, #32 icing tip
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 30 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 40 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 12 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
1 batch Most Excellent White Cake batter
(see Chapter 6)
4 ounces semisweet chocolate squares,
melted and cooled
For the frosting:
1 batch Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (see
Chapter 8 for the variation on traditional
buttercream)
For the decorations:
1 cup crushed chocolate graham sticks or
crackers
1⁄4 cup green jimmies
Plastic farm animals, tractor, barn, fence,
trees

Making the Marble Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round pans and set
aside.
2 Pour half the white cake batter into a medium bowl. Spoon all the melted chocolate into
the batter, and gently swirl the two together with a rubber spatula. (Don’t overmix or
you’ll end up with a chocolate batter and no marbling.)
3 Divide the remaining white batter evenly between the two pans. Then divide the mar-
bled batter evenly over the white batter. Don’t stir them together; the marbled batter
will settle into the white batter.
4 Place the pans in the oven, making sure that they have at least 1 inch of space in
between them. Rotate them once during baking to make sure they bake evenly. Bake for
30 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out with
moist crumbs attached.
5 Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges, and invert
them onto cooling racks to cool completely.
6 After the cakes are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7).
Decorating the cake
1 Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to the entire cake, and refrigerate it for 1
hour. Then apply a second coat of frosting to the cake.
2 Using a #32 tip and the chocolate buttercream, pipe shells (see Chapter 11) around the
top rim of the cake. (The shells keep the chocolate crumb and jimmie decorations from
falling off the edge.)
3 On the top of the cake, use a toothpick to mark a wavy line that divides the surface in
half. On one side of the line, scatter the crushed chocolate pieces and press them down
gently. On the other side of the line, sprinkle the green jimmies and press them down
gently.
4 To create the scene, place the farm animals in the green grass, and set up the tractor,
barn, and trees in the chocolate dirt.
5 Pull a decorator comb through the frosting on the sides of the cake, following the cake’s
circumference.
6 Use the #32 tip to pipe chocolate buttercream shells around the base of the cake.

Circus Roar Cake
This cake makes quite a statement and is likely to get little ones roaring. I like to use
this cake, which utilizes two sizes of round pans, to showcase two cake flavors. For
example, a 1-year-old can enjoy a lighter flavored cake in the 6-inch round while the
adults enjoy a more decadent cake flavor in the bigger cake.
For this particular recipe, a luscious cinnamon flavor permeates the cake, from the
Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting to the (optional) cinnamon-chip eyes to the pennant-
shaped cinnamon gum that circles the cake.
Tools: 14-inch round cake pan, 6-inch round cake pan, #5 icing tip, #22 icing tip, #48 icing
tip, #100 icing tip
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 50 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 90 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake:
3 batches Delicious Yellow Cake batter (see
Chapter 6)
For the frosting (recipe follows):
7 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3⁄4 cup all-vegetable shortening
1⁄3 cup whole milk
For the decorations:
2 batches Stiff Decorator Frosting (see
Chapter 8)
Dark brown food coloring gel
Warm brown food coloring gel
Egg yellow food coloring gel
1⁄4 cup cinnamon or chocolate chips
8 sticks cinnamon-flavored chewing gum, cut
into pennant-shaped triangles
2 1⁄8-ounce box animal crackers
2 black licorice whips, cut into three 4-inch
strips
Making the cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the two round pans and line them with parch-
ment paper.
2 Fill both pans with cake batter, about 2⁄3 full, and place them in the oven. Bake the 6-inch
cake for 20 minutes, and then remove it from the oven. Continue baking the 14-inch
cake for another 30 minutes.
3 Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges, and invert
them onto cooling racks to cool completely.

4 Level the 14-inch cake, but do not level the 6-inch cake. Let the domed shape of it
remain as is.
Making the Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting
1 In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the cinnamon to the confectioners’ sugar and com-
bine by hand with a balloon whisk.
2 Turn the mixer on low, and add the shortening to the sugar mixture. Gradually add the
milk until the frosting starts to come together.
3 Increase the mixer speed until the frosting becomes creamy. If necessary, add a few
more drops of milk to achieve the desired consistency.
Decorating the cake
1 Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to both cakes, and then place the small cake
at the center bottom of the big cake. Refrigerate the cake for 1 hour.
2 Apply a second layer of cinnamon buttercream to the entire cake.
3 Divide and tint the Stiff Decorator Frosting as follows: 21⁄2 cups dark brown, 11⁄2 cups
warm brown, and 1 cup egg yellow.
4 Using tip #5 and the dark brown frosting, pipe the outline of two lion eyes. From the
inner corner of each eye, draw a line directly down and then up and over onto the 
6-inch cake. Make the lines meet to form the lion’s nose and snout, and then pipe the
lion’s mouth (it should look like a rounded W) from that meeting point.
5 Place cinnamon (or chocolate) chips inside the eyes to form the irises. Place chips in
the snout on the small cake, too.
6 For the lion’s mane, prepare three pastry bags of frosting as follows: one bag outfitted
with a #22 tip and dark brown frosting; one bag outfitted with a #48 tip and warm brown
frosting; and one bag outfitted with a #100 tip and yellow frosting.
7 Pipe the lion’s mane by making thick curls (a mixture of stars and wavy lines; see
Chapter 11) with the dark brown and filling in with wavy lines of warm brown. Use
the yellow to add blonde highlights.
8 Stick the gum pennants into the frosting on the side of the cake, spacing them evenly all
the way around.
9 Dab a bit of cinnamon frosting on the back of the animal crackers and stick them to the
side of the cake in between the gum pennants.
10 Stick the licorice whips into the lion’s jowls on the small cake to form his whiskers.
Vary It!: Pipe frosting around the base of the cake and stick powdered candy sticks verti-
cally into the frosting at even intervals.

Chapter 13: Festive Cakes for Kids

Getting Kids Involved
Kids have great imaginations, and their refreshingly fanciful ideas and love
for certain confections can bring a lot to the table when you’re facing the task
of designing and making cakes. Never underestimate the whimsy that a child
can add to your decorating projects.
When you get kids involved in cake design, baking, and decoration, be practi-
cal about their participation. Pick recipes that are simple, don’t require much
time, and let the kids get involved with stirring, scooping, placing, and other
tactile endeavors.
Following are a couple general guidelines to consider as far as children in the
kitchen are concerned. Obviously, unless they’re older, you don’t want them
near the oven or stove top or working the mixer.
 At the age of 5, they usually can grease a pan, stir batter, and measure
certain ingredients. In addition, they can add some decorations to the
cake, like sprinkles or candies.
 By the age of 8, they can crack eggs, chop butter, and grate certain 
ingredients.
For your first attempt at baking and decorating with kids, consider using a
box of cake mix as a foundation. The mix lets you can see what they’re capa-
ble of and interested in while minimizing the work and mess!
Think of ways that, after the cake has come out of the oven and cooled, the
kids can add their own creative flourishes to make it stand out or be their
own. And make sure the kids see the end result. No matter how you think it
looks, they’ll be impressed that they made something that everyone will
enjoy eating.
Before you begin baking with the kids in the kitchen, they need to understand
the importance of being clean when preparing food. Take the following steps:
 Make sure that they’ve washed their hands thoroughly.
 Tie back long hair.
 Give them aprons to wear.
 Have damp dish cloths or wet paper towels (or even wet wipes) handy
for them to keep their hands clean so they’re less inclined to lick their
fingers or smear ingredients together.

Trying Kid-Friendly Recipes
The recipes in this section enlist kids’ help and let them actually be participants
rather than on-lookers in the cake baking and decorating process. Follow these
basic steps to get started:
1. Get kids acclimated to the cake process by reading the recipe aloud
from start to finish so that they know what’s involved. If possible, let
them see a picture of the finished product so that they know where
they’re headed.
2. Assemble all the ingredients and acquaint kids with each one.
3. Show kids the various equipment, from bowls and pans to measuring
cups and spoons to decorating tools, that you’ll be using to make the
cake.
4. As you progress through a recipe, keep the kids tuned in by letting
them see how each step brings the cake together. When possible,
let them perform steps so that they have an even greater sense of
accomplishment when the cake is finished.
These recipes are really kid-friendly, but you may also consider letting imagi-
nations run wild by baking one of the basic Most Excellent White, Delicious
Yellow, or Cocoa Chocolate cakes (refer to Chapter 6 for recipes), mixing up
some frosting, and letting the kids loose with an assortment of candies and
other confections.

No-Bake Cherry Cake and Icing
This cake doesn’t even require you to use the oven! It calls for already-prepared ingredi-
ents, so you and the kids can vary the taste to your liking with a variety of cake mixes,
pie fillings, and fruits. So, if you or the kids don’t like cherry filling, you can easily sub-
stitute blueberry, apple, strawberry, apricot, pineapple, or whatever else you find on
your grocer’s shelves!
Tools: Microwaveable 12-cup traditional-shaped silicone Bundt pan, wooden spoon, 
balloon whisk
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Baking time: 12 minutes plus 5 minutes for cooling
Decoration time: 10 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
18.25-ounce box white cake mix
21-ounce can cherry pie filling
1 egg
For the cake:

202
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
For the icing and decorations:
1 cup confectioners’ sugar
1 tablespoon milk
Pink food coloring liquid
12 maraschino cherries
Making the cake
1 Combine all the cake ingredients in a medium bowl, and mix them together with a large
wooden spoon. The batter will be quite thick.
2 Pour the batter into a microwave-safe Bundt pan. Microwave on high for 12 minutes. If
your microwave doesn’t have a rotating tray, turn the pan halfway around after 6 minutes.
3 Remove the cake from the microwave, and let it sit in the pan for 10 minutes. (It continues
to bake for 5 minutes after coming out of the microwave.) Then turn it out onto a plate.
Preparing the icing
1 In a medium bowl, stir the confectioners’ sugar with a balloon whisk to break up any
lumps.
2 Add the milk and whisk it until the icing reaches a drizzling consistency. Add additional
milk, a drop at a time, if you need to thin out the icing.
3 Stir in a few drops of pink food coloring.
Decorating the cake
1 Drizzle the icing over the cake.
2 Place the cherries around the top of the cake, either evenly spaced or arranged in clus-
ters of two or three.
S’mores Cupcakes
No one can resist these campfire-inspired treats . . . particularly because they’re in the
form of cupcakes — the perfect single serving!
Tools: Two 12-well muffin pans, cupcake liners
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Baking time: 20 minutes plus 30 minutes for cooling
Decoration time: 15 minutes
Yield: 24 servings

203
Chapter 13: Festive Cakes for Kids
18.25-ounce box yellow cake mix
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
11⁄3 cup water
3 eggs
2 cups miniature marshmallows
3 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
24 miniature graham cracker bears
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the muffin pans with cupcake liners.
2 In a medium bowl, combine the yellow cake mix with the oil, water, and eggs. Beat on
low speed for 30 seconds, and then on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the
sides of bowl twice during the mixing process.
3 Divide the batter evenly among the 24 wells. Place two marshmallows and a few choco-
late chips into each well of batter.
4 Bake the cupcakes for 20 minutes, or until the tops spring back when touched lightly.
Let the cupcakes cool for 30 minutes before removing them from the pan.
5 Place 11⁄2 cups of chocolate chips in a 2-cup glass measuring cup, and microwave for
about 1 minute on high, or until the chips are melted and smooth when stirred with a
spoon. Let the chocolate cool slightly so that it’s just warm to the touch.
6 Pour chocolate onto each cupcake. Before the chocolate hardens, place a graham cracker
bear flat on the top of each cupcake.
Berry Good Crumble Cake
Kids love to smush food together, and as long as their hands are clean, I find nothing
wrong with that . . . especially where this recipe is concerned. For the dough of this
cake, they can use their fingers to crumble the butter into the flour and sugar and to
press the dough into the bottom of the pan and onto the filling. However, the filling
itself requires the help of an attentive adult!
Tools: 8-x-8-x-2-inch square cake pan, squeeze bottle
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Baking time: 40 minutes
Decoration time: 10 minutes
Yield: 9 servings
For the cake:
1 cup granulated white sugar
4 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces
1 egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

204
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
For the filling:
3 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, or
strawberries, or a combination
1⁄2 cup granulated white sugar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons butter
For the topping:
1⁄2 cup seedless raspberry or boysenberry
preserves
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the square cake pan and set it aside.
2 In a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, baking soda, and cornstarch. Mix in the butter
chunks. Let the kids use their fingertips to distribute the butter into the dry ingredients,
or use a pastry cutter to achieve a crumbly consistency.
3 Add in the egg and vanilla, and mix the dough (hands are great tools for this) until it
just comes together. Set aside.
4 In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the berries, sugar, lemon juice, corn-
starch, and butter. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. The mixture should thicken
slightly.
5 Press half of the dough into the bottom of the cake pan. Pour the fruit mixture over it.
Let the mixture cool before pressing the remaining dough on top of the fruit mixture.
6 Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the crumble is golden brown.
7 Heat the preserves in the microwave for 30 seconds until they liquefy and are easily
stirred with a spoon. Spoon the liquid into a squeeze bottle.
8 After removing the cake from the oven, squeeze the preserves on the top of the crumble
in a decorative pattern.

Cakes for Grown-Ups

 Thinking about what adults enjoy in a cake
 Creating cakes just for women and just for men
 Decorating cakes that appeal to everyone
W
hy should kids have all the fun at parties?
Grown-ups enjoy delicious and well-decorated theme cakes just as
much as the younger set.
Cakes designed for grown-ups require a little more imagination and preparation
than cakes for children or teens simply because adults are more likely to pay
attention to the details and look a little longer before digging in. But the results
can be more impressive, too. Just paying attention to a few key details can
put you well on your way to crafting a wonderfully sweet and special party
centerpiece. In this chapter, I explore some traditional possibilities and more
unconventional designs . . . all in the spirit of a grown-up celebration that really
takes the cake!
Gearing Up for Grown-Up Cakes
A cake can be the ultimate, satisfying conclusion to a grown-up’s party . . .
especially if you take into account the guest of honor’s personality and the
party’s theme when planning your cake decoration.
Further, adults are particularly honored when someone bakes and decorates
a cake just for them. Kids love cake and gooey frosting, but adults are truly
appreciative of not only the cake’s taste but also the time, effort, and creativ-
ity involved in making it.

Brainstorming a design
As you start thinking about decorating the perfect cake for a grown-up’s
party, I recommend that you consider the following questions as you con-
ceive the design:
 What kind of birthday party or special event will the cake be served at?
 How many people will be enjoying your creation?
 Who’s invited to the party? Is it strictly for adults, or will kids be there
too?
 If it’s a dinner party, what kind of cuisine will be served?
Your answers to these questions can help you determine the size, shape, and
decorations for the cake. Further, if the party is mostly for adults, you can
consider branching out with a cake that embraces more adult flavors, such as
coffee, liqueur, exotic fruit, or interesting spices.
Taking personality into account
In addition to the party’s theme and logistics, consider what specifically suits
the celebrant and the celebration. For example, an outdoors-themed party
can mean camping for one, surfing for someone else, and mountain climbing
for another. You want your cake to be spot on, so you have to look at the
party and the guest of honor from all angles.
To really personalize your cake, do some digging to find out the celebrant’s
favorite flavors. Don’t just make a strawberry cake because you think it will
look pretty when you cut into it. Get a sense of the kinds of cake the cele-
brant really loves, and also find out if any ingredients are off-limits.
Simple Letter and Number Designs
The recipes in this chapter tell you how to make some impressive cakes for
men and women, but you also can depend on some popular standbys —
involving letters and numbers — to dress up a cake design.
As you become more comfortable in your cake baking and decorating, I
encourage you to strike out beyond the tried and true. If you opt for the 
letter or number route (which is particularly popular for birthdays), do try
206
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

to infuse your celebrant’s personality into the cake decorating somehow,
either with favorite colors or flavors or tokens of interest.
Playing the alphabet game
Similar to kids’ cakes, you can make a grown-up’s cake special by shaping it
into letters to form a monogram, first name, last name, or nickname. Another
option is to cut a cake or cakes into the number of the person’s age for a mile-
stone birthday such as 30, 40, or 50.
Check out Chapter 13 for more on how to carve cakes into letters and numbers
and personalize them even more with a variety of adornments.
Piping monograms and initials
Carving cakes into letters and numbers is fun, but you should never underes-
timate the class, simplicity, and ease of scripting letters on top of a birthday
cake. In the same vein as spelling out a name in cake shapes, you can pipe a
single initial or entire monogram in frosting on top of a cake.
You can go fancy or keep it crisp and clean. For ideas and inspiration, check
out the fonts in your computer’s word processing program or type “fonts”
into your favorite Internet search engine and browse the results. With a little
practice and patience, you should be able to mimic the styles you find.
To script a name, monogram, or message, follow these steps:
1. Use a ruler to mark on parchment paper the dimensions of the cake pan
you plan to use, or — better yet — trace around the pan to provide an
accurately sized space.
Make a few copies of this template so that you have plenty of practice
space.
2. In the available space, write out what you want to put on the cake,
taking care with the size and spacing of your letters.
3. If it’s your very first time scripting, practice piping with actual frosting.
Outfit a pastry bag with a #5 or #7 tip, and put 1⁄2 cup of frosting in the
bag. (You can also use shortening to save your frosting for the main
event.) Trace over your writing with your pastry bag, taking care to
make the lines smooth and consistent.
4. When you’re confident in your piping, use a toothpick to delicately trace
your strokes on the cake itself, using your practice sheet as a guide.
5. With the pastry bag outfitted with a #5 or #7 tip and the frosting you
want on your final cake, follow the toothpick strokes.

Designing Cakes Ladies Swoon Over
For special occasions with a female guest of honor, you may find that you
have so many — maybe too many — cake design choices to consider and
pick from.
In devising an idea and designing the cake, be cognizant of the celebrant’s
favorite color. Most men don’t pay much attention to a cake’s color, but you’ll
be amazed at how many women will marvel when you remember and incor-
porate the wild hues or soft pastels they’re crazy about. (Some tend to have
passionate, averse reactions to colors they don’t like as well, so that’s another
good reason to keep color in mind!)
The Jewelry Cake and Lucious Luau Cake that follow are design concepts 
that have been vastly appealing at many women’s parties I’ve been hired to
provide cakes for. I give you colors and other design ideas for these cakes,
but you can easily personalize and tailor each of the cakes to your particular
celebrant or celebration.

Jewelry Cake
This cake benefits from a sparkly look and a clever saying. Most women I know are very
fond of jewelry, and this is a cake that’s as fun to look at as it is to eat. And with the right
decorations, which are fairly easy to find, the decoration process moves very swiftly.
This cake is shown on the third page of the color section.
Tools: 9-inch round cake pan, 14-inch round cake pan, #7 icing tip
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 25 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):

Making the Pink Velvet Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour the round pans.
2 Prepare the cake batters as described in Chapter 15. Combine the batters into one
bowl, and mix in pink food coloring gel (as much as is needed for your desired color).
3 Divide the batter into the pans, filling each one about 2⁄3 full, and bake for 45 minutes, 
or until a toothpick inserted in the center of each one comes out with moist crumbs
attached.
Decorating the cake
1 After the cakes have cooled, level them (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer)
of frosting to both cakes, and refrigerate them for 1 hour.
2 Frost the 14-inch layer completely. Place the 9-inch layer on top of the 14-inch layer,
toward the back of the cake so that the smaller cake creates what looks like a neckline
on the larger layer.
3 Frost the smaller layer.
4 Nestle the pink and green rock candy jewels end to end against the edge of the smaller
layer, alternating them to form a two-color necklace. Leave a small space in the exact
center of the candy necklace and at each end (on either side of the small layer).
5 In the space in the center of the necklace, gently press the stick of clear rock candy into
the cake, letting the clear crystal portion dangle like a pendant.
6 Mix deep pink food coloring gel into 2 cups of frosting.
7 Using the #7 tip, pipe dots around the edge of the top layer of cake. Pipe dots extending
from both ends of the rock candy necklace, and then pipe dots around the base of the
bottom cake layer.
8 Write “Have a Gem of a Birthday,” “You’re a Gem!,” or the guest of honor’s name or initials
on the top cake layer.

Luscious Luau Cake
The lady of the hour doesn’t have to be Gidget, it doesn’t have to be summertime, and
you don’t have to be in Maui to love this cake. It’s a perfect complement to so many dif-
ferent kinds of theme parties, having been served at beach blanket bingo, luau, surf ’n’
sand, tropical, and pool party themes with rousing success. The finished cake is shown
in Figure 14-1.
Tools: 12-x-18-inch cake pan, #11 icing tip, bamboo skewer
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 1 hour plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
3 batches modified Delicious Yellow Cake
batter (see Chapter 6)
4 1⁄2 cups coconut milk, divided into 11⁄2-cup
portions
3 cups drained, crushed pineapple, divided
into 1-cup portions
For the frosting:
3 batches modified Buttercream Frosting (see
Chapter 8)
3 teaspoons cherry extract
For the decorations:
11⁄2 cups packed light brown sugar
Royal blue food coloring gel
2 plastic palm trees
3 plastic beachgoers
3 plastic surfboards (or 3 pieces of fruit stripe
gum cut into a similar shape)
3 hula dancer cupcake toppers
3 toothpicks
3 sugar Tiki masks
Birthday candle
4 miniature pretzel sticks
2 gummi fish (preferably clownfish)
1 gummi shark
4 gummi rings (for inner tubes)
1 gummi lobster
Making the Piña Colada Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour the cake pan.
2 Prepare the cake batters as described in Chapter 6, but in each batch, substitute 11⁄2
cups coconut milk for the whole milk, and fold the pineapple into the batter before
pouring it into the pan.
3 Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in
the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.

Making the Maraschino Cherry Frosting
1 Prepare the frosting as described in Chapter 8, but in each batch, substitute cherry
extract for pure vanilla extract.
Decorating the cake
1 After the cake has cooled, level it (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of
frosting to the cake, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
2 Frost the cake completely. Drag the bamboo skewer horizontally across the top of the
cake, approximately one-third of the way down, to make a shoreline.
3 To create the sandy coastline, cover the upper third of the cake (including the sides)
with brown sugar, pressing it lightly into the cake.
4 Mix blue food coloring gel into 3 cups of frosting until you achieve a color that looks
like water. Using a large icing spatula, cover the bottom two-thirds of the cake with the
frosting. Make ridges and swirls to resemble ocean waves.
5 Arrange the palm trees, beachgoers, surfboards, and hula dancers on the brown sugar
beach. Stick toothpicks into the Tiki masks, and position them around the hula dancers.
6 Place a birthday candle in the brown sugar, and arrange the pretzel sticks around the candle
so that they lean in toward each other like a camp fire. Be sure to leave enough space above
the candle so that the pretzels don’t catch fire when you light the birthday candle!
7 Place the gummi fish, shark, and rings in the ocean, and put a lobster on the shoreline.
8 Outfit a pastry bag with the #11 tip and 1⁄2 cup white frosting. Pipe a series of wave caps
and foam on the blue ocean.
9 Use the skewer to write a message, such as “LUAU!” in the brown sugar sand. 
Tip: You can find many of the inedible plastic decorations for this cake at cake decorating
Web sites (such as those listed in Chapter 21), and on the cake decorating aisle at national
craft chains. For the gummi candies, check candy shops in your local shopping mall and
also online candy retailers.

Chapter 14: Cakes for Grown-Ups
Other ideas for women’s cakes
When it comes to cakes designed for women,
you have a host of ideas at your disposal. For
instance, flowers are always a great choice for
a woman. If you can find out the guest of honor’s
favorite varieties, you can incorporate fresh,
unsprayed flowers on the top of the cake or
create them out of frosting (check out possibil-
ities in Chapter 11) or gum paste (which I dis-
cuss in Chapter 13). Dresses, shoes, hats,
garden items, birds, polka dots, teacups, and
ribbons are other design ideas that you can use
to delicious, beautiful, and feminine effect.

Winning Over Men
You may feel a bit challenged where men and cake are concerned because,
whereas themes for women’s cakes may seem abundant, men’s tastes may
strike you as limited (but you really just need to brainstorm a bit). And,
granted, far less attention has been given to cakes for men: You may see
bakery display cases chock-full of cakes that would be perfect for a woman’s
party, but those for men are lacking or missing completely! But rest assured,
the recipes in this chapter will satisfy even the hardest-to-please or 
impress . . . and foster your creativity in coming up with your own concept, too.
Consider the celebrant’s particular interests, personality, and favorite flavors —
as well as dislikes that you should avoid — to create a memorable decorated
cake.

Other ideas for men’s cakes
For cakes for men, consider cutting and shap-
ing layer cakes into a yacht, cabin cruiser, sail-
boat, or airplane. Also, you can use decorations
to create the theme, such as:
 Cigars and bars: Incorporate chocolate
cigars and pipe frosting in the shape of mar-
tini glasses
 Barbecues: Use licorice strips for the grill
and frosted cupcake tops for burgers

Chapter 14: Cakes for Grown-Ups
Vegas, Baby! Cake
When each of the kids in my family turned 21, my parents treated us to a trip to Las
Vegas, where we came face to face with the almost kaleidoscopic sight of chips, tokens,
coins, tumbling sets of dice, decks of cards, and spinning wheels. That perspective
inspired this cake, which is (not surprisingly) a consistent favorite of men and ideal for
poker-themed parties and casino nights. The rum-flavored cake batter adds another
grown-up element to the cake. You can see a version of this cake in Figure 14-2.
Tools: 14-inch round cake pan, #3 icing tip, #5 icing tip, #7 icing tip, #11 icing tip
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 11⁄4 hours plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 24 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
3 batches modified Delicious Yellow Cake
batter (see Chapter 6)
1⁄2 cup dark rum
For the frosting:
3 batches Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
Red red food coloring gel
Black food coloring gel
Lemon yellow food coloring gel
Sky blue food coloring gel
14 foil-wrapped dark chocolate poker chips (3
inches in diameter)
8 mint truffle chocolate playing cards
(measuring 13⁄8 x 2 inches)
14 gold foil-wrapped chocolate coins (3
inches in diameter)
12 dice lollipops, various colors
45 3-inch lengths black licorice
45 3-inch lengths red licorice
Making the Rum Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour the round pan.
2 Prepare the cake batters as described in Chapter 6, but in each batch, combine the
milk with 1⁄2 cup dark rum before adding that mixture to the batter alternately with the
flour mixture.
3 Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in
the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.

Decorating the cake
1 After the cake has cooled, level it (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of
frosting to the cake, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
2 Frost the cake completely. Using a toothpick, create the iconic Vegas sign by making 
a horizontal diamond-shape that measures 5 inches across the middle. Create seven 
circles at the top of the sign in which to write “WELCOME.” Underneath the circles,
write “TO” in block letters and script “Fabulous” all on one line. Sketch the words 
“LAS VEGAS” in the exact center of the sign, and then center “Nevada” underneath that.
3 Above the sign and a bit to the left, sketch an eight-point star by forming one large
cross and then skewering it with a second cross set at a 45-degree angle. Sketch a
straight line radiating from each point of the diamond-shaped sign to the edge of the
cake, dividing the cake into four quadrants.
4 Divide and tint the frosting as follows: 2 cups red, 2 cups black, 1⁄2 cup lemon yellow, 
and 1⁄2 cup sky blue.
5 Outfit a pastry bag with a #3 tip and black frosting; outline the seven circles at the top of
the sign. Outfit another bag with a #5 tip and red frosting; pipe the “WELCOME” letters
inside the black circles.
6 Remove the #5 tip from the red frosting bag, clean it, and place it in a pastry bag with
the sky blue frosting; pipe “to Fabulous” and “Nevada,” following your sketch.
7 Refit the red frosting bag with a #7 tip, and write “LAS VEGAS.” Also pipe over your
sketch of the star above the sign.
8 Outfit a pastry bag with a #11 tip and yellow frosting; outline the sign.
9 Remove the #11 tip from the yellow frosting bag, clean it, and place it in the black frosting
bag (replacing the #3 tip that was in the black bag). Pipe over the lines radiating out from
the sign, and outline the top edge of the cake.
10 Place the multicolored poker chips in the upper right quadrant, the chocolate playing
cards in the lower right quadrant, the gold foil coins in the upper left quadrant, and the
lollipop dice in the left lower quadrant. Press these decorations gently into the frosting.
11 To create the feel of a roulette wheel on the outside edge of the cake, arrange alternating
vertical columns of three black and three red licorice segments. Press the licorice gently
into the frosting.
12 Using the #11 tip, pipe a band of black frosting around the bottom edge of the cake. 
Tip: You can find many Vegas-style candies and other edible decorations (such as gummi
versions of cards, casino chips, and dice) online at www.candywarehouse.com and
www.vegasimage.com. In addition check out candy shops in your local shopping mall 
or online counterpart such as www.sweetfactory.com.

Golf Game Cake
You’ll be on course to make a golfing guy feel above par with this cake, which draws on
some delicious edible treats for the sand trap, water, greens, and even the golf ball! This
cake is shown on the third page of the color section.
Tools: 12-x-18-inch cake pan, #7 icing tip, Mason jar or 16-ounce plastic container with a
tight lid, 6-inch round cookie cutter or biscuit cutter
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 45 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings

Making the Peanut Butter Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour the cake pan, and set aside.
2 Prepare the cake batters as described in Chapter 6, but in each recipe, substitute light
brown sugar for white granulated sugar and substitute 3⁄4 cup smooth peanut butter 
plus 1⁄2 cup unsalted butter for the unsalted butter called for in the original recipe.
3 Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in
the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
Decorating the cake
1 After the cake has cooled, level it (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of
frosting to the cake, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
2 Mix green food coloring gel into 2 cups of frosting until you achieve a color that looks
like grass. Frost the cake completely.
3 Use a toothpick to sketch a loose figure eight shape for the green of the course.
4 In the upper right corner of the cake (outside the curve of the figure eight), use a small
serving spoon to dig out a kidney-shaped patch. Repeat in the lower right corner of the
cake.
5 Fill in one patch with raw sugar to create a sand trap. Fill the other patch with blue icing
gel to create a water feature.
6 Put the flaked coconut into the glass jar or plastic container with a few drops of green
food coloring gel. Put the lid on tightly and shake to color the coconut. Press the col-
ored coconut around the figure eight–shaped green and around the sand trap and water
feature. Press coconut onto the sides of the cake, too.

or a woman. In this section, I share ideas for cakes that are fun and festive for
any birthday or party honoree.

Chapter 14: Cakes for Grown-Ups
Rock Star Cake
I’ve found that feeling like a rock star knows no gender bounds. It makes no difference
whether the celebrant dreams of fronting a band or even knows how to play a guitar.
Simply toasting and treating him or her like a rock star is what matters.
With regards to this cake’s decorations, everyone always has fun trying to figure out
what all the pieces of the electric guitar actually are. And don’t skimp on the candy
rocks — cake eaters love their double meaning. The cake itself — a confetti variation 
on the Most Excellent White Cake recipe — is appropriately celebratory as well.
Tools: 12-x-18-inch cake pan, #7 icing tip, #11 icing tip, toothpicks
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 11⁄4 hours plus 30 minutes for freezing and 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings

Making the Confetti Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour the cake pan, and set aside.
2 Prepare the white cake batters as described in Chapter 6, but for each recipe, fold in 1⁄2
cup multicolored nonpareils as the last step.
3 Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in
the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
Decorating the cake
1 After the cake has cooled, level it (see Chapter 7). Then, cut it according to the direc-
tions in Figure 14-3 to create the pieces that will form the guitar. Freeze the pieces for 30
minutes.
2 Put the pieces together using frosting to connect the joints (the neck to the body).
Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to the entire guitar, and refrigerate it for 1
hour.
3 Use a toothpick to sketch flames licking across the body of the guitar.
4 Divide and tint the frosting as follows: 1 cup red, 2 cups purple, and 1⁄2 cup yellow.
5 Spread the red frosting inside the flames sketched in Step 3. Frost the rest of the body
of the guitar, including the sides, with purple frosting.
6 Outfit a pastry bag with a #11 tip and yellow frosting. Outline the flames by piping
yellow where the purple and red frostings meet, and add jagged accent strokes to the
red flames. Also, pipe seven horizontal lines along the guitar neck to form the frets.
7 Starting at the base of the neck, place four black chewing gum strips on the guitar body
about 3⁄4 inch apart. These strips form three pickups and the bridge of the guitar.
218
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
3 batches modified Most Excellent White
Cake batter (see Chapter 6)
11⁄2 cups multicolor nonpareils
For the frosting:
3 batches Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
Red food coloring gel
Deep purple food coloring gel
Lemon yellow food coloring gel
2 sticks black chewing gum (such as Black
Black), cut in half lengthwise to create four
thin strips
16 red small, round hard candies
12 yellow small, round hard candies
9 purple gumdrops
6 purple small, round hard candies
6 18-inch lengths black shoestring licorice
4 cups candy rocks
For the cake (recipe follows):

8 Dab frosting on the back of 12 of the red hard candies and 12 of the yellow hard candies,
and gently press six candies onto each piece of gum.
9 Place two purple gumdrops on the bottom right portion of the guitar body to look like
tone controls. Place toothpicks into each of six gumdrops and stick them into the left-
hand side of the head to be the tuning pegs. Place the last gumdrop on the bottom side
of the guitar to be the strap holder.
10 Turn the six 18-inch lengths of shoelace licorice into guitar strings by placing them in
between the hard candies (add a dab of frosting to the end of the licorice to make it
stick to the chewing gum strip at the bottom of the body) and running them up the neck
of the guitar.
11 Place the six purple hard candies at the top of the head to be the tuning knobs of the
pegs. Dab frosting on each candy to stick it on top of a licorice string.
12 Place the remaining four red hard candies in between the two center strings to be the
fret guides.
13 Press the candy rocks into the frosting on the sides of the cake, all the way around the
guitar.
14 Outfit the yellow frosting bag with a #7 tip, and outline the body of the guitar by piping
along the top edge. A version of this cake is shown in Figure 14-4.

Chapter 14: Cakes for Grown-Ups

Following the invitation
Sometimes, the best ideas for a grown-up cake come from the party invitation
itself. Several times, I’ve relied on the invitation to influence a cake’s colors
or design elements. After all, a party invitation is a great window into the
theme, tenor, and scope of the celebration.
You can either mimic the actual design on the invitation or, if that seems
daunting, just use it for inspiration. If you want to use the invitation itself for
the design, enlarge it on a copy machine so that you can faithfully adapt it to
the size of your cake. For a different look, consider re-creating only a portion
of the invitation; for instance, if the invitation has a palm tree on it among
other things, make a stencil out of the palm tree and focus your decorations
on that.
Looking like the honoree
It may sound like a strange idea, but you can use a man’s or woman’s face as
part of your cake design. It’s not that difficult to pipe a pretty generic face 
on a cake, and then you just embellish it to suit your celebrant’s visage or
personality.
Figure 14-4:
Rock on!
220
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

People usually have one or two very defining characteristics that you can
exaggerate for a cake decoration: Long curly black hair can be strands of
shoestring licorice, or bright blue eyes can be made with frosting, a rolled-
out gumdrop, or crushed sour candies.
You can also use a face on a cake to show off an honoree’s personality. For a
birthday cake I was hired to make for a comedic actress, her husband requested
that I let his wife’s sense of humor somehow shine through in the decoration.
I outlined her profile, and then — at the top of her head where her hair would
be — I used Swiss candies shaped like fruits to give her a Carmen Miranda–style
headdress.
Shaping up other cakes
Some adults love animals just as much as most kids do, so why not make a
grown-up cake special by carving it into an animal shape? For example, think
astrological signs: A lion-shaped cake like the one in Chapter 13 would work
for a Leo birthday, and a fish-shaped cake would be ideal for a Pisces. It seems
like butterflies are always in vogue for some ladies. And some people just have
an affinity for certain animals: Let’s face it, cakes in the shape of giraffes, pen-
guins, or favorite dog breeds are fun for the guests of honor and conversation
pieces for everyone else.
Like the other shapes of cakes covered in this chapter, you can embellish
animal-shaped cakes with candies, coconut, gumdrops, and licorice strings.
221
Chapter 14: Cakes for Grown-Ups
A colored copy you can eat?
I tend to favor frostings, icings, and embellish-
ments when decorating a cake, but I have to
admit that one newfangled invention is pretty
handy. Kopykake sheets are basically edible
color copies of your choice of artwork that you
apply to cake surfaces for a quick and easy
decoration solution. You can find them at most
cake supply stores or online. You can either
print an image yourself with a printer outfitted
with edible color inks or have a cake supply
shop do it. (The edible inks don’t work with all
printers, so you’ll need to make sure yours is
compatible or invest in one that is.) If you go
with a sheet like this, I recommend that you
enhance your cake with handcrafted adorn-
ments or it may come off as “manufactured”
rather than decorated!
Visit www.kopykake.com to see firsthand if
this decoration technique is a fit for your occa-
sion and cake.

Showering Brides 
and Moms-to-Be
In This Chapter
 Taking stock of the event
 Playing around with popular decoration techniques
 Mastering cakes for bridal and baby showers
A
s the excitement builds for couples who are getting married or expect-
ing a child, showers usually feature cake in a starring role. For such a
momentous occasion, not just any cake will do. That’s why, in this chapter,
I walk you through some cake decorating techniques for embellishing crowd-
pleasing cakes that bring a “Wow!” factor to bridal and baby showers.
Along with sharing some helpful techniques, I show you how to make some
common themes and treatments extra special and create a memorable con-
fection that ideally anticipates the big event.
Analyzing the Occasion
When faced with designing, baking, and decorating a cake for a shower occa-
sion, take some time to really assess what the event will be like. If you were
ordering a cake from a bakery, you’d most likely have to fill out a question-
naire about what you wanted the cake to look like, so give your personally
decorated cake the same consideration. Answer the following questions as
you begin the process of designing, baking, and decorating a shower cake:
 How many people will be at the party?
 Is it for women only, or is it a coed event?
 What’s the theme?
Recipes in This
Chapter
 Tasteful Registry Cake
 Floral Fantasy
 Cupcake Tower
 Baby Animal Zoo

 Have specific colors been selected for the party?
 Will the cake be a centerpiece on a table? If so, what else will be on the
table, and how much space will the cake have?
 What are the favorite cake flavors of the honoree(s)?
For both bridal and baby showers, the cake is often the centerpiece of a table
setting at some point during the event. Further, cutting the cake is an event
itself, either as a preamble to opening gifts, concurrently with unwrapping
them, or as a sweet finale to the party. For these reasons, you want your cre-
ation to both look and taste amazing.
Whatever the event, I always suggest steering clear of the obvious, such as
bootie shoe or building block–shaped cakes for a baby shower, and taking
advantage of the opportunity to incorporate personality and inject warmth,
spirit, and even a little humor into the event. When done with class and
grace, your cake will stand out from run-of-the-mill alternatives and deeply
impress the shower’s guest of honor.
Bridal showers: Tying in to the main event
In many ways, I like to consider the wedding shower confection a fun, infor-
mal take on all the wedding goings-on. That’s why I think it’s important to
gather information that’s relevant to the actual wedding so that the cake
becomes a colorful, memorable, integral part of that event and not just some
cast-off notion.
Don’t leave anyone out. If both the bride and groom-to-be will be guests of
honor at the party, don’t just concern yourself with the bride’s favorite cake
flavor. Check in with the groom, too. After all, you want both of them to enjoy
the cake.
For a bridal shower, you may be asked to decorate the cake so that it ties in
with design elements of the actual wedding (or you may decide to go this
design route on your own, without being asked). For instance, if the couple is
planning a wedding on the beach, the shower may have a tropical theme that
should carry through to the cake (in both look and taste).
Although you want to make the most beautiful, most memorable cake possi-
ble, make sure that you don’t upstage the confection that the bride and
groom are planning for the big day itself.
When preparing a bridal shower cake, you may want to go a more nontradi-
tional route. Lately, cupcakes have been in vogue for bridal showers. Not only
do they offer a different take on cake in individual servings, but they also let
you provide a number of different flavors. Petit fours are another popular
alternative to traditional cake. Typically, they feature a host of different (but
complementary) designs and icing colors that give off a chic yet playful vibe.

Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

Baby showers: Making parents-to-be 
feel special
Partygoers definitely get excited about couples getting married, but celebrat-
ing the impending arrival of a little boy or girl sends relatives and friends into
a gleeful frenzy. The baby shower cake should welcome a little one into the
world and convey many good wishes.
To that end, definitely take the shower’s theme into account. If the shower
doesn’t necessarily have a theme, consider a theme the new parents may be
using for their nursery: Vintage cowboy, Dick and Jane, princess, alphabet,
world traveler, surfer, mermaid, and seaside are all nursery themes that
I’ve taken as inspiration to fashion shower cakes. Another option is to
reflect the colors of the baby’s new room into your design.
If the parents-to-be have opted not to know the sex of the child before it’s
born, you can rely on a host of gender-neutral, kid-cute options: A zoo or farm
theme, the alphabet, or a playground scene are all appropriate possibilities.
Commanding Popular 
Shower Power Moves
Cutouts, edible flowers, and lace designs are always popular embellishments
for shower cakes. Although the recipes in this chapter don’t utilize all such
techniques, mastering them will undoubtedly benefit your cake decorating
repertoire, for showers and beyond.
Crafting cutouts
Fondant is a common choice for shower cakes because it’s smooth, refined,
and so versatile. I discuss how to make fondant in Chapter 9; in this section,
I explain three methods for decorating a cake with fondant decorations. All
three methods rely on using cookie or fondant cutters to cut fondant into the
shapes of flowers, leaves, animals, or geometric designs, among other possi-
bilities. You can use good-quality, sturdy cookie cutters you currently own to
work with the fondant, or you can also purchase specialty fondant cutter sets
to craft your fondant as well.
Although I talk about fondant cutouts as they apply to shower cakes, these
instructions also apply to virtually any other occasion cake. For instance,
you can cut holly leaves out of green-tinted fondant and arrange them on a
Christmas-themed cake. Or you may want to cut out a fondant bird or chick
to decorate an Easter or springtime treat.

Chapter 15: Showering Brides and Moms-to-Be

Layered fondant
A layered fondant decoration is a fondant “stack” that features fondant cut in
different sizes of the same shape. The three-dimensional effect adds depth to
a cake design.
1. Cut out the same or similar shapes in a gradation of sizes (see
Figure 15-1).
To make the layers really pop, consider dividing and tinting fondant a
number of colors and then cutting the different sizes of shapes out of 
different colors.
2. Stack the shapes on top of each other.
3. Apply them to the cake.
The fill-in
For this colorful fondant decoration, you fill in a larger fondant shape with a
smaller size of the same shape that’s tinted a different color.
1. Cut your desired shape out of fondant.
2. Place a smaller cutter of the same shape inside the bigger fondant
shape, and press.
3. With the smaller cutter, cut out a piece of fondant that’s a different
color from the fondant used in Steps 1 and 2.
4. Place the larger shape on your cake, and fill the empty space with the
smaller shape in the different color (see Figure 15-2).

Cake insets
For cake insets, you add interest to a cake covered in fondant by cutting out
shapes in the fondant covering, and then inserting the shapes back in, but
tinted a different color.
1. Roll out a piece of fondant that you’ll use to cover the entire surface
of your cake. Carefully lay it on the cake.
2. Mark areas that you want to cut out and fill in with a colored shape.
Transfer the fondant from the cake to a flat work surface.
3. Using a cutter of the desired shape, make cuts where you marked the
fondant in Step 2.
4. Lay the fondant on the cake again, and smooth it so that it adheres to
the cake’s surface.
5. Use food coloring gel to tint a separate piece of rolled fondant to be
used for the cutout insets.
6. Cut the inset shapes out of the colored fondant (as many as you need
to fill in on the cake).
7. Press the colored insets into the spaces in the cake’s fondant covering
(see Figure 15-2).

Adorning with flowers
Mostly in the arena of bridal showers, flowers in a variety of forms, textures,
and colors are a preternaturally pretty and perky decoration choice. You can
choose from the following options:
 Frosting flowers: With a little practice and the right icing tips, you can
whip up roses, sunflowers, daisies, and chrysanthemums, to name just a
few. For instructions on crafting frosting roses, check out Chapter 12.
 Gum paste flowers: Gum paste is a particularly good way to recreate
fresh flowers that may be poisonous. Those shaped like roses and lilies of
the valley are consistently popular; you can find a recipe for gum paste as
well as instructions for creating roses and lilies of the valley in Chapter 12.
 Fresh flowers: Flowers and cake are a natural combination, and fresh
flowers are even better! Incorporate some of the bride’s favorites, use
the same flowers planned for the big event, or play around with varieties
and colors. For the ins and outs of decorating with fresh flowers, includ-
ing which varieties are safe to use on cakes, flip to Chapter 12.
For a baby shower, a couple may be planning a garden or rose-themed nursery
for a little girl on the way. In that case, a flower-adorned cake is a perfect choice.
Piping the lacy look
Piping frosting in a lace design (sometimes called Corelli lace) gives a more
formal flair to shower cakes. You achieve the lacy look by creating a pattern
of delicate squiggles across the cake’s surface.
For best results, you need to use a fine, round icing tip, such as #1 or #2.
(You can read about icing tips in Chapter 11.) Follow these steps to give
your cake a lacy look:
1. Outfit a pastry bag with an icing tip and frosting.
Check out Chapter 11 if you need a refresher on how to do this.
2. With a toothpick, mark off the area of the cake that you want to fill
with the lace design.
Ideally, the area should cover the cake’s top surface and overlap onto
the sides, which eliminates the need for a border and adds to the lace’s
realistic look.
228
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

3. Working across the surface of the cake, pipe curving lines that are
close together but not touching (see Figure 15-3).
4. As you pipe, maintain consistent, light pressure on the pastry bag.
Cover as much of the area as possible without lifting the tip so that
your lace looks continuous.
5. Define the lacy area by piping small beads (with a #3 tip, for example)
around the edges of the design.
When working on a lacy look, make sure that you start with an extra-smooth
frosting surface so that the raised pattern truly stands out. The lacing
pops even more if you pipe it in a color that contrasts with your cake’s
base frosting.
Tossing Cheer into a Bridal Shower
The recipes in this section allow for both a coed approach and a cake with

3 batches modified Delicious Yellow Cake
batter (see Chapter 6)
3 cups toffee bits
For the frosting:
3 batches Buttercream Frosting (see Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
Leaf green food coloring gel
Deep pink food coloring gel
Burgundy food coloring gel
4.4-ounce sheet ready-to-use white fondant
4.4-ounce sheet ready-to-use pastel green
fondant
Confectioners’ sugar for dusting
Making the Toffee Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour the miniature loaf pans, and prepare
the 12-x-18-inch pan as follows: grease, line with parchment paper, grease, and flour.
For the cake (recipe follows):
Tasteful Registry Cake
Gifts from wedding registries feature prominently at most bridal showers, and this cake
takes its cue from that longstanding tradition. The cake’s surface is adorned with the
kind of “china” place setting — with the plates made from fondant — that so often
appears on a couple’s registry.
When I’ve made this cake in the past, I’ve incorporated colors and patterns unique or
special to the groom and bride-to-be. This recipe calls for leaf green, pink, and burgundy
frosting and fondant, but you should feel free to use whatever colors appeal to your
honoree(s). However, do try to stick with one bright color, one muted color, and one
accent color. This cake is shown on the fourth page of the color section.
Tools: 3 miniature loaf pans (53⁄4-x-31⁄2-x-2 inches), 12-x-18-inch cake pan, #1 icing tip, 
#2 icing tip, #4 icing tip, #5 icing tip, #100 icing tip, 4 couplers, rotary pastry cutter, 2-inch
round plastic lid (or cookie cutter), 4-inch round plastic lid (or cookie cutter), 6-inch round
plastic lid (or cookie cutter), ruler
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 50 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings

2 Make the cake batters as described in Chapter 6, but in each batch, fold in 1 cup toffee bits
as the last step. Divide the batter among the four cake pans, and put the pans in the oven.
3 Bake the miniature loaf cakes for 25 minutes. Remove them from oven, and let them cool
in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto cooling racks and letting them
cool completely. Bake the larger cake for 25 minutes more than the miniature loaf cakes,
or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then run a knife around the edges, turn it
out onto a rack, and let it cool completely.
Decorating the cake
1 After the cakes have cooled, level them (see Chapter 7). Square off the sides of two
miniloaf cakes so that each forms a 2-x-4-inch rectangle, and cut the third miniloaf into
two 2-x-2-inch squares. Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to all the cakes, and
refrigerate them for 1 hour.
2 Divide and tint the frosting as follows: 2 cups leaf green, 2 cups deep pink, and 2 cups
burgundy.
3 Frost the large cake with the leaf green frosting. Refrigerate that cake while you frost the
others as follows: Frost one rectangular cake and one square cake with pink frosting,
and frost the other two cakes with burgundy frosting. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
4 Roll the sheet of white fondant to a thickness of 1⁄8 inch. Using the lids or cookie cutters,
cut out three circles: one 6-inch (the dinner plate), one 4-inch (the salad plate), and one
2-inch (the bread and butter plate). These fondant rounds are the china in your place
setting design.
5 Remove the large, rectangular cake from the refrigerator, and use a toothpick to lightly
sketch the placement of the china. Place the fondant rounds on the cake, smoothing
them evenly on the cake’s surface.
6 Prepare four pastry bags with couplers (see Chapter 11). Fill one each with leaf green,
pink, burgundy, and white frosting.
7 Outfit the burgundy bag with the #5 tip and the white bag with the #4 tip. Pipe the rim
of a dinner plate with the burgundy frosting on the large fondant round. Inside the bur-
gundy frosting, pipe a circle of white frosting. Repeat with another circle of burgundy
frosting. Repeat this three-circle design on the salad and bread and butter plates.
8 Dust a clean work surface with confectioners’ sugar. Roll the sheet of green fondant to a
thickness of 1⁄8 inch. With a rotary pastry cutter (or a pizza wheel), cut six 1-x-6-inch
strips, two 1-x-10-inch strips, and four 11⁄2-x-6-inch strips. Place a 1-x-6-inch strip across
the width of each rectangular miniloaf cake, and two of these strips across each square
cake (so that they cross in the center) to look like ribbons on each package. Place each
of the two 1-x-10-inch strips lengthwise across the rectangular packages, crossing the
shorter ribbons in the center.
231
Chapter 15: Showering Brides and Moms-to-Be

Floral Fantasy
I tend to reserve roses for wedding cakes, so for this cake design, I’ve picked two different
flowers — hyacinths and chrysanthemums — that are unique, dramatic, and beautiful.
You can certainly vary this design by incorporating any flower you like.
Although this is just a 9-inch double layer cake, the basket weave design and flowers
make the decoration very time-consuming. 
Tools: Two 9-inch round cake pans, #48 icing tip, #67 icing tip, #80 icing tip, #193 icing
tip, 4 couplers, 3 bamboo skewers, wax paper, 6 plastic containers with 33⁄4-inch lids
(or mason jars with comparable lids), double-stick tape, 10-x-10-inch polystyrene square
(or florist foam or a wide-mouthed jar filled halfway with dry beans)
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 21⁄2 hours plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 16 servings
232
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
9 Loop each of the 11⁄2-x-6-inch strips into a figure eight, and bend a square piece of fondant
around the center of each one to form a bow. Place one bow on top of each package
where the ribbons intersect.
10 Spread some white frosting on the bottom of each package to act as glue. Place the pink
rectangular package at the upper right corner of the cake and the burgundy rectangular
package at the upper left corner of the cake. Place the square packages in between
them so that the colors alternate.
11 With a #2 tip and pink frosting, monogram the center of the fondant dinner plate with
the initial of the couple’s last name (after they’re married). Monogram the salad plate
with the initial of the bride’s first name, and monogram the bread and butter plate with
the initial of the groom’s first name.
12 With the #100 tip and white frosting, pipe ruffles around the top and bottom edges of
the large, rectangular base cake.
Tip: If the shower is a coed one, use a #1 tip to put the bride-to-be’s monogram on one of
the rectangular packages and the groom-to-be’s monogram on the other. To make the
monograms stand out, use contrasting frosting (burgundy on the pink package and pink on
the burgundy package).

Making the cakes
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour the pans, and set aside.
2 Prepare the cake batter according to the recipe in Chapter 6. Divide the batter into the
two pans, and bake for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
with moist crumbs attached. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before
inverting them onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
Decorating the cakes
1 After the cakes have cooled, level them (see Chapter 7). Frost the top of one layer, stack
the other layer on top, and apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to the entire cake.
Refrigerate for 1 hour.
2 Divide and tint the frosting as follows: 11⁄2 cups violet, 11⁄2 cups electric blue, 1 cup leaf
green, and 4 cups electric green.
3 Frost the cake electric green, and return it to the refrigerator while you work on the 
decorations.
4 Make the hyacinths: Thread 41⁄2 marshmallows on a bamboo skewer, and frost them with
untinted frosting. Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #193 icing tip, and violet frosting.
Holding the skewer in your left hand if you’re right-handed (swap this if you’re left-
handed), pipe hyacinth blossoms all over the stack of marshmallows. Start at the
bottom edge of marshmallow and pipe out a blossom, pulling up and away gently from
the marshmallow to form a point, and then moving to the next blossom, keeping them
all very close together as you move up and down the stacked marshmallows. When you
finish piping each hyacinth, insert the skewer into the polystyrene, and stick it in the
freezer. Repeat the process with the other two skewers so that you have a total of three
frosting hyacinths.

5 Make the chrysanthemums: Cut a 4-inch square of wax paper, and affix it to the top of a
plastic container with double-stick tape. Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #80 icing tip,
and blue frosting. Pipe a chrysanthemum petal from the center of the lid to the rim of it,
lifting up at the finish so that the end stands up off the paper. Repeat this shape three
times, forming a cross on the lid. Then, starting from the center point, press out more
radiating petals until you’ve filled the spaces in between the first four petals. Add
another layer of petals, placing these in between the petals of the first layer. Repeat
with a third layer of petals, again alternating between the petals of the second layer.
Continue with additional layers until the chrysanthemum is filled. Place the flower in
the freezer to harden. Repeat the process until you have a total of six chrysanthemums
(see Figure 15-4).
6 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #48 icing tip, and electric green frosting. Remove your
two-layer cake from the refrigerator, and, following the steps for the basket weave tech-
nique explained in Chapter 11, pipe a basket weave design around the sides of the cake.
7 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #67 icing tip, and leaf green frosting. Pipe leaves all
around the top edge of the cake. (If you need a refresher on piping leaves, flip back to
Chapter 11.)

8 Remove the hyacinth skewers from the freezer, and stick them into the center of the
cake. Remove the chrysanthemums from the freezer, and gently peel the wax paper off
them. Set them on the cake surrounding around the hyacinths. If the chrysanthemums
appear flat on the cake, dab a little frosting on the back of them, and rest them on the
extra marshmallows.
9 Pipe leaf green leaves and tendrils in between the flowers to complete the floral
arrangement.
10 Refrigerate the cake until you’re ready to serve it. The cake is shown in Figure 15-5.
Vary It!: If making the flowers proves too time consuming, consider using fresh ones
(that aren’t poisonous), or purchasing already-made gum paste flowers online or at a
bakery supply store.

Bringing Up the Baby Shower
This section arms you with two recipes, both of which have been playfully,
classily presented for a touch of whimsy at baby showers. The first one, a
Cupcake Tower, doesn’t require a tremendous time commitment and gives
you room to play around with different decorations. The second recipe, the
Baby Animal Zoo, takes more time to create but results in a charming cake
that always draws “ooohs” and “aaaahs.”

Cupcake Tower
This cupcake tower presents an appropriately grown-up version of cupcakes, which are
often associated with kids but have become more popular in recent years as people
experiment with cake flavors. One great thing about using cupcakes for a special occa-
sion confection is that you don’t have to worry about leveling or crumb-coating.
Everyone enjoys a cupcake with a hearty round top!
I use blue-tinted frosting and blue confetti in this recipe, but you can easily substitute
pink frosting and decorations if a baby girl is expected, or use yellow or green if the
baby’s gender is unknown. This cake is shown on the fourth page of the color section.
Tools: Two 12-well cupcake pans, large star icing tip (such as #863), 2 couplers, cupcake
stand or 3 pedestal cake plates
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Baking time: 20 minutes plus 30 minutes for cooling
Decoration time: 40 minutes
Yield: 24 servings
For the decorations:
For the cupcakes:
For the frosting:
1 batch Key Lime Cupcake batter (recipe follows)
1 batch Buttercream Frosting (see Chapter 8)
Sky blue food coloring gel
White confetti
Light blue confetti
1 Prepare the cupcakes as instructed in the following recipe. Carefully remove them from the
pans, and line them up on a countertop or workspace with plenty of room for you to work.
2 Add sky blue coloring gel to 3 cups of frosting, tinting it to your desired shade of blue.
Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler and the large star tip, and fill the bag with the blue
frosting.
3 On 12 cupcakes, pipe the frosting in a clockwise swirling motion, starting around the
outside edge of each cupcake and working in toward the center so that you create 
a circular cone shape that ends in a sharp point.

4 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler and untinted frosting. Remove the star tip from the
blue frosting bag, clean it, and refit it on the white frosting bag.
5 On the remaining 12 cupcakes, repeat the frosting procedure described in Step 3.
You should end up with 12 blue-frosted cupcakes and 12 white-frosted cupcakes.
6 Sprinkle white confetti on the blue cupcakes and blue confetti on the white cupcakes.
7 Place the cupcakes — alternating blue and white — into the positions on the cupcake
stand, or position them similarly on stacked cake pedestals.
Key Lime Cupcakes
237
Chapter 15: Showering Brides and Moms-to-Be
2 1⁄4 cups granulated white sugar
3 cups sifted cake flour
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
11⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
3⁄4 teaspoon baking soda
4.5-ounce package lime gelatin
7 eggs
13⁄4 cups vegetable oil
11⁄8 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
11⁄2 teaspoons lemon extract
3⁄4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons key lime juice
5 tablespoons sifted confectioners’ sugar
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place 12 cupcake liners in the pans.
2 In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar, cake flour, salt, baking powder, baking
soda, and gelatin. Make a well in the center of these dry ingredients.
3 In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, oil, orange juice, and extracts. Mix lightly, and
then pour the mixture into the well in the dry ingredients.
4 Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl twice to make sure every-
thing gets incorporated.
5 Pour the batter into the cupcake liners. Bake for 15 minutes, or until a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
6 While the cupcakes bake, whisk together the key lime juice and confectioners’ sugar.
7 Remove the cupcakes from the oven. Let them cool in their pans for 15 minutes. Then
prick holes in the tops and drizzle the lime mixture over them to be absorbed into the
cupcakes.
Vary It!: You can also arrange your decorated cupcakes on a succession of different-sized
cardboard rounds. Cover each round with wrapping paper, and then cover that with heavy
cellophane. Stack them using plastic miniature columns available at craft stores, and then
arrange your cupcakes on each level.

If you need to speed up the cookie decorating process in the following recipe,
consider investing in a few #2 and #5 icing tips. They’re inexpensive, and you
make up for any money spent with the time you save in cleaning and reat-
taching the tips for the different colors of frosting you use.

Baby Animal Zoo
This cake, with its cavalcade of animals and humorous message, is always a hit at baby
showers. It shows off the decorating technique of combining cookie cutters with cakes;
for this cake, cookie cutters provide an easy but distinctive way of lining up the animals
that entertain the cake eaters.
This cake also utilizes a technique called flocking, in which you basically use sanding
sugar to give a decoration a glittery presence. Flocking a design directly on a cake is
tough because the sanding sugar can stick to parts of your cake that you didn’t want it
on. That’s why I recommend that you limit flocking to the cookies in this recipe; the
sanding sugar is easier to control on the cookies and is less likely to muck up other
parts of the cake design. The finished cake is shown in Figure 15-6.
Tools: Three 10-x-10-inch cake pans, #2 icing tip, #5 icing tip, #7 icing tip, #16 icing tip, 
4 couplers, 6 animal-shaped cookie cutters (such as a gorilla, lion, giraffe, elephant,
camel, and kangaroo)
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes for the cake plus 2 hours for cooling; 10 minutes for the cookies
plus 1 hour for cooling
Decoration time: 13⁄4 hours plus 1 hour for refrigeration for the cake and overnight 
refrigeration for the iced cookies
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake:
For the frosting:
2 batches Delicious Yellow Cake batter 
2 batches Buttercream Frosting 
(see Chapter 6)
(see Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
1 batch Royal Icing (see Chapter 9)
Neon pink food coloring gel
Neon blue food coloring gel
Neon green food coloring gel
6 cookies (recipe follows)
White sanding sugar
Orange sanding sugar
Pink sanding sugar
Mint green food coloring gel

Decorating the cookies for the cake
1 Bake the cookies according to the recipe that follows. Divide and tint the Royal Icing as
follows: 1⁄2 cup neon pink, 1⁄2 cup neon blue, and 1⁄2 cup neon green. (You should have 1⁄2 cup
untinted icing left over for further embellishments to the cookies.)
2 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #2 icing tip, and green icing. Outline the giraffe and
gorilla cookies in green.
3 Attach a #5 tip to the green icing bag. Squeeze thick lines of icing within the outlines on
the giraffe and gorilla cookies. Use an icing spatula to spread the icing out, giving the
cookies a full, even coat of green icing. Transfer the cookies to a parchment paper-lined
cookie sheet.
4 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #2 icing tip, and pink icing. Outline the lion and kan-
garoo cookies in pink.
5 Attach a #5 tip to the pink icing bag. Squeeze thick lines of icing within the outlines on
the lion and kangaroo cookies. Use an icing spatula to spread the icing out, giving the
cookies a full, even coat of pink icing. Transfer the cookies to the parchment paper-
lined cookie sheet.
6 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #2 icing tip, and blue icing. Outline the elephant and
camel cookies in blue.
7 Attach a #5 tip to the blue icing bag. Squeeze thick lines of icing within the outlines on
the elephant and camel cookies. Use an icing spatula to spread the icing out, giving the
cookies a full, even coat of blue icing. Transfer the cookies to the parchment paper-
lined cookie sheet.
8 Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator overnight to allow the icing to set up. When
you’re ready to finish decorating them, remove them from the refrigerator and arrange
them on sheets of parchment or wax paper.
9 Outfit a pastry bag with a #5 tip and white royal icing. Outline the elephant’s trunk, the
lion’s mane, the camel’s hump, and the kangaroo’s pocket. Also pipe eyes on all the
cookies, and add spots and polka dots as you see fit. You’re free to play around with the
decorations.
10 While the icing is still wet, sprinkle sanding sugar on it, mixing and matching the sugar
colors on the different-colored cookies. Let the cookies dry for 5 minutes, and then
shake off the excess sugar.
Decorating the cake
1 Bake the cakes as instructed in the recipe in Chapter 6. After the cakes have cooled,
level them (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of buttercream to the cakes,
and refrigerate them for 1 hour.
239
Chapter 15: Showering Brides and Moms-to-Be

2 Divide and tint the buttercream frosting as follows: 2 cups mint green, 2 cups a darker
shade of green, and 1 cup neon green.
3 Arrange two of the square cakes side by side to form the bottom layer, and frost them
with the mint green frosting. Place the third cake on top of the cake on the right.
4 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #11 tip, and neon green frosting. Pipe neon green
frosting in the shape of six ovals: three on the upper layer and three on the lower layer.
These are the stands for the zoo animals.
5 In the center of the facing side of the double layer, use a toothpick to sketch an arch-
way. Using an icing spatula, fill in the archway with dark green frosting. Outfit a pastry
bag with a coupler, #11 tip, and dark green frosting, and outline the archway.
6 Refit the dark green frosting bag with a #7 tip, and pipe “It’s Going To Be A . . .” in the
center of the facing side of the double layer. Refit the dark green frosting bag with a #9
tip, and pipe “ZOO!” in an arc above the archway.
7 Using a bamboo skewer, sketch crisscrossing lines of latticework around the sides of
the cake. Using the dark green frosting bag with the #9 tip, pipe the latticework on the
sides of the cake, using your sketched lines as a guide and piping around the wording.
8 Refit the dark green frosting bag with a #16 tip, and pipe a zigzag border around the
base of the top layer and around the base of the entire bottom layer of cake.
9 Stand one decorated cookie in the center of each frosting oval.

Decorative Cookies
241
Chapter 15: Showering Brides and Moms-to-Be
1 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄8 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1⁄2 cup sugar
1 egg
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
2 In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
3 In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add
the egg and vanilla, and mix well. Add the dry ingredients, and mix just until blended.
4 Transfer the dough from the mixing bowl to a sheet of plastic wrap, wrap it up tightly,
and refrigerate it for 20 minutes.
5 On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1⁄8 inch.
6 Cut out the desired shapes, rerolling dough if necessary to get more shapes. To deco-
rate the cake, you only need one of each of six animal shapes, but I recommend that
you make as many extras as you can in case some cookies break.
7 Place the cutouts on the cookie sheet, and bake them for 10 minutes, or just until
they’re golden. Leave them on the cookie sheet to cool completely.
Adapting recipes for other occasions

been typically used for showers, they’re cer-
tainly appropriate for other festive occasions.
Here are a few examples:
 The Floral Fantasy cake is ideal for ladies’
birthdays and Mother’s Day gatherings.
 The Cupcake Tower is so versatile that you
can adapt it for practically any occasion with
minimal tweaking, such as using different
color combinations and adding cupcake
picks, which come in a variety of designs.
 The Baby Animal Zoo cake is a hit at kids’
birthday parties.

W
ow! The wedding cake. For many, the wedding cake really does 
represent the pinnacle of skill, taste, look, style, and aptitude in cake
decorating. Because of its importance, the thought and work associated
with making and decorating a wedding cake tends to send some decorators
screaming from their kitchens.
Because it’s associated with that most revered of special events — the 
wedding — more is expected of the cake. It’s on display at the reception, fea-
tured as the bride and groom take a first bite together, devoured by wedding
guests, and even lasts until the couple’s first anniversary, when they follow
an age-old tradition and partake of the cake’s top layer.
But fear not: You can master the techniques that produce a very impressive,
very classy wedding or anniversary cake. Furthermore, with some surpris-
ingly simple architecture, you can extend your skills to tiered cakes that are
much taller than normal. This chapter covers all that and shares a few simple
tricks to make a couple’s anniversary cake an exceptional part of an affair to
remember.

Considering the Event’s Theme and Colors
You’d be surprised at how many cake decorators (both aspiring and 
professional) pass over an all-too-important aspect of planning a wedding
(or anniversary) cake’s design and flavors: They get stuck on what they envi-
sion for the cake . . . rather than what the couple wants. And believe me, the
couple remembers the cake far longer than the person who made it does.
As you undertake the task of creating a wedding cake, make sure to gather
some important details about the impending nuptials so that you get a
true sense of the look and size of the cake that will fit the couple’s tastes
(regardless of whether it matches your taste).
I always think it’s best to sit down with a couple and plan their personalized
cake with them rather than have them pick a cake from a catalogue or a
gallery of cakes you’ve made in the past. Of course, they may have collected
pictures of cakes from magazines and such, but by planning the cake together,
you take into account the wedding’s particular dynamics. The details of the
wedding should influence the style of the decorations, the size of the cake,
and the overall look of your creation; tying together all these elements makes
the cake truly special and unique for the couple celebrating.
Figuring out the logistics
Get answers to the following questions to inform the cake’s direction:
 How many people will be at the wedding?
 Where is the couple getting married?
 What time of day is the wedding?
 Is the reception being held indoors or outside?
 Where will the wedding cake be set up?
 What’s the feel of the wedding? Exceptionally formal, starkly modern, or
rather casual and in a woodsy location?
Although the special couple should provide you with the overwhelming inspi-
ration, you have plenty of choices and resources to draw from in designing
and decorating a cake that suits them. For example, you may want to consider
the following:
 Decorating the cake with the colors of the bridal bouquet
 Coordinating the cake with the design of the wedding gown, incorporat-
ing details such as lace, buttons, and swags
 Using the wedding locale as inspiration, such as using candy shells if it’s
a beachfront ceremony
244
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

In the case of an anniversary cake, consider the following:
 How many years of marriage are being celebrated? You may want to take
into account certain gifts that are traditionally associated with specific
years, such as tin (10th), crystal (15th), china (20th), silver (25th), and
rubies (40th).
 Are certain colors particularly significant to the couple?
 Is there a symbol that’s especially meaningful to the celebrants that
could be incorporated or serve as a jumping off point for the design?
 Is there a particular place, city, or locale that’s important to them and
may guide you in your endeavor?
In addition to asking these questions, find out how many people are
expected, the location and decorations, and the general tenor of the event
(for instance, a formal dinner, a barbecue, or a humorous roast).
Daring to be different?
Wedding cakes used to be white inside and out, but times have changed!
Now they can be any color and flavor, and decorations are limited only by the
imagination. In fact, my wedding cake was chartreuse (thanks to my wife for
letting me incorporate my favorite color), two tiers were fudge chocolate,
the other two were caramel, and friends who were there still comment on it
(in a good way, of course!).
As for shape, wedding cakes don’t have to be circular. In fact, lately, trends
have pointed to all kinds of shapes: hexagons, squares, octagons, diamonds,
and ovals. They also don’t have to be neatly tiered: Lopsided creations have
become quite the rage, different-shaped cakes grouped together but standing
on their own make for a chic presentation, and even cupcakes beckon a wel-
come, refreshing change in already perfectly portioned individual servings.
Similarly, don’t feel regimented with an anniversary cake either. You have the
leeway to adopt and adapt any number of shapes. And because anniversary par-
ties often eschew the formality of a wedding, you have even more opportunity
to create a unique flavor combination that boasts a fun, unconventional design.
Staying in style
I encourage you to embrace some nontraditional ventures in decorating a
wedding or anniversary cake, but there are a few guidelines of good taste
that all such occasion cakes benefit from.
245
Chapter 16: Lifting a Fork to Weddings and Anniversaries

 Scripted decoration: On a wedding cake, stay away from scripting
words; a monogram may be suitable, but the wedding isn’t the setting
for a witty message or playful lettering. On the other hand, for an
anniversary cake, you may want to script a cheery “Happy Anniversary,”
include the couple’s name, or put their wedding date or number of years
married on the cake.
 Cake covering: Wedding cakes are usually topped with buttercream, fon-
dant, or a combination thereof. These coverings are the most popular
because they create the smoothest finish. Some brides choose fondant
because they want the cake to have a smooth, almost porcelain look.
However, other brides find that fondant looks too manufactured or 
plastic, so they go with buttercream.
Personally, I’m in the buttercream camp. To my eye, it looks more nat-
ural, and to my palette, it always tastes better. I’ve found that some
guests are confused by the taste and texture of fondant and aren’t sure
what to do with it, which means that it often ends up heaped up in the
corner of each cake plate.
 Filling: Great fillings make wedding cakes even more extraordinary and
special. If you usually use frosting as your filling, wedding and anniver-
sary cakes are your opportunity to break out of the box. A tiered cake is
a fantastic way to feature a filling (or fillings) that differs from your cake’s
covering but that both accents and highlights the flavors. Also, because
wedding cakes are often prepared a couple of days in advance, flavored
syrups are a popular way of ensuring that the cake doesn’t dry out.
The additional depth of flavor also amps up a wedding cake’s exclusivity
and originality. For some ideas about fillings syrups, peruse the recipes
and techniques in Chapter 10.
Positioning to stand out
In the case of each and every wedding cake, keep in mind what the wedding
cake will be actually sitting on. Because the cake won’t be served directly off
a table, you want to make sure that you decorate its placement — on a plat-
ter or pedestal — and its surroundings on a table. Of course, this strategy
applies to anniversary cakes as well.
With the placement of a wedding or anniversary cake, you have a perfect
opportunity to tie in to a theme. You may want to decorate the cake board
with a coordinating fabric that has been integral in the party’s design. Or if
your cake includes floral arrangements, you may want to reserve some
stems, buds, or petals to place around the base of the cake. Finally, if the
cake will rest on a platter, you may choose to surround the cake with decora-
tions that relate to the wedding’s look or locale, such as shells for a beach
wedding or chocolate pinecones for a mountain setting.
246
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

For wedding cakes and nostalgic anniversary cakes, take into account the
possibility of a wedding topper. These figurines tend to fall in and out of
vogue, but couples routinely request vintage ones from the 1950s and 1960s.
You can even have a topper made in a couple’s likeness (for a tidy sum and
much advance notice, that is).
Creating a Simple Wedding Cake
With some organization and an understanding that yours doesn’t have to be a
towering, multitiered, 400-pound creation bursting with dozens of hard-to-
find flowers, you’ll be well on your way to making and decorating a wedding
cake that will make any couple proud.
You can often dress up a white or chocolate cake with simple measures that
lend elegance, such as:
 A bounty of fresh flowers
 Cherries (particularly uncommon varieties such as Rainier), strawber-
ries, or raspberries that have been dipped in dark or white chocolate
 Fresh, unblemished fruits, particularly more exotic ones like kiwis and
figs, which bring vibrancy, color, and variety when sliced and arranged
on a cake
 Grosgrain or organza ribbon pinned around the circumference of the cake

Italian Chocolate Wedding Cake
With this recipe, I’ve deconstructed the traditional wedding cake. This cake has three
separate tiers, but they remain unstacked for a presentation that’s out of the ordinary.
To tie the cakes together, try to find three platters of the same metal or material in sizes
that fit the cakes.
Taste-wise, this cake has class, a little unexpected sass (it’s chocolate!), and a sweet fill-
ing. Violet candies are a delicate touch that bring a dash of color to the cake and make
it even more eye-catching. You can even sprinkle fresh violets in between the platters
on your presentation table.
Additionally, you don’t have to worry about torting these cakes (splitting the layers into
halves). You can just focus on baking up nice cakes, whipping up two delicious frost-
ings, and letting everyone enjoy your simple but impressive results. This cake is shown
on the sixth page of the color section.

For the decorations:
248
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
Tools: 14-inch round cake pan, two 9-inch round cake pans, 6-inch round cake pan, 14-inch
cardboard round, 9-inch cardboard round, 6-inch cardboard round, bamboo skewer
Preparation time: 40 minutes
Baking time: 50 minutes
Decoration time: 40 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 50 servings
For the cake:
5 batches Cocoa Chocolate Cake batter (see Chapter 6)
For the frosting:
2 batches Chocolate
Buttercream Frosting
(see Chapter 8)
1 batch Creamy Chocolate
Syrup (recipe follows)
1 batch Pourable Chocolate
Ganache (recipe follows)
1 pound Italian violet candies
2 dozen fresh violets (optional)
Baking the cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the pans, and line them with parchment
paper. Grease them again, and flour them.
2 Prepare the cake batters as described in Chapter 6, divide it among the four pans, and
place all the pans in the oven together. Bake the 6-inch layer for 25 minutes; the 9-inch
layers for 35 minutes; and the 14-inch layer for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
3 As you remove the cakes from the oven, let them cool in their pans for 10 minutes.
Then invert them onto cooling racks, and invert them again onto racks so that they’re
right side up.
4 With a bamboo skewer, poke small holes all over the cakes’ top surfaces. Drizzle the
creamy chocolate syrup all over the cakes, letting it soak in through the holes. Cover
the cakes with plastic wrap, and refrigerate them until you’re ready to decorate them.
Decorating the cake
1 Place each layer on a cardboard round of corresponding size. Spread chocolate butter-
cream on the top of one 9-inch layer, and set the second 9-inch layer on top of it. Frost
each cake with chocolate buttercream, and refrigerate them for 1 hour.
2 Place each layer on a rack that’s sitting on parchment paper or aluminum foil. Pour the
chocolate ganache over each cake, proceeding slowly so that the chocolate completely
covers the top and sides of each cake.

249
Chapter 16: Lifting a Fork to Weddings and Anniversaries
3 Transfer the cakes to their platters. While the ganache is still wet, place the Italian
violet candies around the top rim of each cake. Place another row of violet candies
around the base of each cake.
4 To display the cakes, stagger them on the presentation table so that guests can see
each layer. Scatter fresh violets around the cakes.
Creamy Chocolate Syrup
18 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
11⁄2 cups half-and-half
1 Combine the chocolate chips and half-and-half in a 2-quart glass measuring cup.
Microwave on high for 1 minute.
2 Stir the mixture until it’s smooth and the chocolate is completely melted.
Pourable Chocolate Ganache
24 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
3 cups heavy cream
1 Combine the chocolate chips and cream in a 2-quart glass measuring cup. Microwave
on high for 11⁄2 minutes.
2 Stir the mixture until it’s smooth and the chocolate is completely melted.
Tiering Up for Success
Wedding cakes tend to be stacked, with each layer resting on the one below,
or separated, with tiers supported by columns or pillars. In either case, a few
supplies are necessary to provide support for your vertical creation.
 Dowels: To provide support for each tier, you snip these 1⁄4-inch round
wooden poles to the height of the cake layer and stick them into the
center of the cake. Without them, the cake would collapse! Some cake
decorators substitute straws for dowels, but I prefer the resolute sturdi-
ness of wooden dowels.
 Cardboard rounds: You place your finished tiers on cardboard rounds.
The cardboard gives the tier a solid surface to rest on the dowels below,
and the rounds aid in removing the tiers for cutting and serving.

 Presentation board: This board, usually made of plywood or Masonite,
holds your finished tiered cake. It’s bigger than the cake both to make
for a better presentation and to allow for proper transportation. 
The presentation board often is covered with cake foil lining or a similar
grease-resistant but decorative wrapping. Another option for covering is
spreading royal icing over the board so that, when dried overnight, the
board has a smooth, pearly surface. For more on cake presentation
boards, turn to Chapter 7.
 Separator set: If you intend to separate cake tiers rather than stack
them, you need a separator set that contains separator plates, 
which the tiers rest on, and columns or pillars that snap into each
plate from the tier below.
Inserting dowels into your cake tiers is much less daunting than it sounds. 
To begin, you need cake layers (duh!), dowels (which you can get at a hard-
ware store or craft store), garden pruning shears, a rubber mallet, a pencil, a
bamboo skewer, and the empty cake pans from the cake layers you baked.
I’m picky when it comes to clean utensils, so if you plan to do quite a bit of
cake baking and decorating, I recommend that you keep a set of supplies
devoted exclusively to cake-related tasks. For instance, label a brand-new
pair of pruning shears with “Cake” in a permanent marker so that you don’t
use the same pair to snip dowels and cut roses.
To insert dowels in cake layers, follow these steps:
1. Rest the pan from your second largest tier in the center of your largest
tier, and press gently to make a very light impression in the cake.
2. In the center of the impression made in Step 1, use a bamboo skewer
to mark evenly spaced holes in a circle around the center of the tier
in which you’ll insert dowels.
As a general rule, plan on resting an 8- or 9-inch round layer on five
dowels and a 6-inch layer on four dowels. You have to strike a delicate
balance: You don’t want to pepper your layers with too many dowels,
but you want each layer to have enough support.
3. Insert a dowel in one of the holes, and press it all the way down until
you hit the cardboard round. With a pencil, mark the height of the
tier on the dowel.
4. Remove the dowel from the cake, and use the pruning shears to cut 
it to the appropriate height. Reinsert the dowel into the cake (see
Figure 16-1).
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 with the other dowels for that tier.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 for each additional tier except the top tier,
which doesn’t need multiple dowels because it doesn’t bear any weight.
250
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 

7. Measure one dowel to the height of your entire cake. Sharpen one end
of the dowel to a point with a pencil sharpener. Insert the dowel in
the center of the top tier, and stake it all the way through the center
of the cake.
When you encounter the cardboard round at the base of each tier, use a
rubber mallet to pound gently on the dowel and pierce through the card-
board to the next layer.
Moving Up to a More Elaborate 
Wedding Cake
When taking on a cake that requires tiers and more elaborate decorations, it’s
smart to create a schedule for the baking and decorating required. As a gen-
eral rule, I usually start two days out from the big event. For example, if the
wedding is taking place late Saturday afternoon, this is my schedule:
 On Thursday, I bake the cake in the evening, and refrigerate it.
 On Friday, I frost the tiers, assemble the cake, and decorate it. Then it
goes back into the refrigerator. If you don’t have a refrigerator that
accommodates the entire, assembled cake, skip the assembly stage and
simply decorate and refrigerate the tiers individually. Plan extra time on-
site to assemble the cake and touch up the decorations.
 On Saturday, I concern myself with futzing, checking to make sure that
frosting covers any cardboard rounds and that all aspects of the cake
are presentable; transporting; arranging the presentation; and incorpo-
rating fresh decorations, such as flowers.

Tahiti-in-SoHo Wedding Cake
In a nod to some of my favorite style icons — Kate Spade, Lulu Guinness, Dorothy
Draper, and Elsie de Wolfe — this cake incorporates a color combination that never
goes out of style . . . and is always in good taste. This cake is shown in Figure 16-2.
Don’t skimp on the Tahitian vanilla in this recipe; it’s distinct, rich, and ultrafragrant.
Tahitian vanilla is available at specialty markets, gourmet stores, and on the Web. 
Tools: 14-inch round cake pan, two 9-inch round cake pans, two 6-inch round cake pans,
14-inch cardboard round, 9-inch cardboard round, 6-inch cardboard round, #10 icing tip, 
silicone pastry brush
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Baking time: 50 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 60 minutes plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 24 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
Transporting your work of art safely is extremely important when you’re
dealing with a wedding cake. Although staking the entire cake with a dowel
(refer to the preceding section) is essential, you also can assemble the cake
on-site if transporting an assembled cake seems too risky. If you’re transport-
ing individual tiers, get your hands on appropriately sized skillets — one for
each tier. Place a damp dish towel in the bottom of each skillet (to prevent
sliding), and rest the tier on the towel.

Chapter 16: Lifting a Fork to Weddings and Anniversaries
Making the Tahitian Vanilla Cake and Buttercream Frosting
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the pans, and line them with parchment
paper. Grease them again, and flour them.
2 Prepare the cake batters as described in Chapter 6, but in each batch, substitute 
11⁄2 teaspoons Tahitian vanilla for pure vanilla extract.
3 Divide the batter among the pans, and place them all in the oven together. Bake the 
6-inch layers for 25 minutes, the 9-inch layers for 45 minutes, and the 14-inch layer for
50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs
attached.
4 Remove the cakes from the oven, and let them cool in their pans for 10 minutes.
Then invert them onto cooling racks, and invert them again onto racks so that
they’re right side up.
5 Prepare the buttercream as described in Chapter 8, but in each batch, substitute 
1 teaspoon Tahitian vanilla for the pure vanilla extract.
Assembling and decorating the cake
1 After the cakes have cooled, level them (see Chapter 7), and torte them by slicing them
in half horizontally.
2 Lightly wash and thoroughly dry the strawberries. Slice each one into eight even slices,
and place them on paper towels to dry. Keep the slices as flat and even as possible.
3 Assemble the 14-inch tier: Place one 14-inch layer on the 14-inch cardboard round.
Brush with strawberry syrup, and spread on a layer of frosting. Add a single layer of
sliced strawberries before setting the corresponding 14-inch layer on top.
4 Repeat Step 3 with the four 9-inch layers and the four 6-inch layers.
5 Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to each tier, and refrigerate them for 1 hour.
6 Divide and tint the frosting as follows: 8 cups pale pink, 2 cups light brown, and 2 cups
dark brown.
7 Frost each tier with pink buttercream, taking each tier out of the refrigerator one at a
time and returning it to the refrigerator after it’s frosted.
8 Remove all the tiers from the refrigerator. Center and stack them, following the steps in
the earlier section “Tiering Up for Success”; use five dowels in the 14-inch tier and four
dowels in the 9-inch tier.
9 Outfit a pastry bag with a #10 tip and light brown frosting. Working clockwise, pipe light
brown dots around the top and bottom edges of each tier, leaving space in between for
alternating dark brown dots. (If you plan to use grosgrain ribbon on the cake, don’t pipe
around the base of the 14-inch tier.)
10 Outfit a pastry bag with a #10 tip and dark brown frosting. Pipe dark brown dots in
between the light brown dots.

11 Arrange pink roses artfully between and around the cake layers, resting a few on the
edges of both the 14-inch and 9-inch tiers.
12 Tie several roses with a 12-inch piece of grosgrain ribbon. Place the bouquet on top of
the 6-inch tier to crown the cake.
13 Affix the remaining grosgrain ribbon to the base of the 14-inch tier using a beaded head
pin to secure the ribbon ends. (Make sure that you remove the ribbon and pin before
serving!)

Chapter 16: Lifting a Fork to Weddings and Anniversaries
2 cups sugar
2 cups water
1⁄2 cup strawberry flavoring
syrup (used in coffee drinks)
1 In a medium saucepan, stir together the sugar and water over low heat for 2 minutes.
Raise the heat to medium, and continue stirring until the mixture thickens and the
sugar dissolves.
2 Remove the syrup from the heat, and let it cool to room temperature. Mix in the straw-
berry syrup.
Tip: If you can’t find enough unsprayed roses of a single shade, opt to blend a couple of
varieties together for a nice effect.
Celebrating Another Year 
with Anniversary Cakes
Although you may opt for a formal approach to an anniversary cake 
that celebrates 10, 25, or 50 years, I always enjoy taking a more relaxed
route with anniversary cakes — particularly when kids are part of the 
celebration.
For instance, if the cake will be part of a black-tie affair celebrating the couple,
consider making a tiered cake and covering the layers in white fondant.
With royal icing, you can pipe simple dots all over the cake and pipe the
number of years the couple has been married on the front side of the middle
tier. If the gathering is more intimate, you can take a similar tack by covering
a smaller, single-layer cake with fondant and dots.
For any anniversary occasion, consider taking a cue from the couple’s wed-
ding and wedding cake to settle on the colors, flavor, and style of the cake
that they celebrate with. And consider adding a thoughtful memento or spe-
cial touch to the cake, such as the couple’s original cake topper or a small
arrangement of flowers similar to the ones at their wedding.

Bubble Dot Anniversary Cake
If you’ve never worked with rolled fondant before, this cake is an easy introduction to
the confection. Fondant adds formality to the cake without being stodgy.
I’ve opted for yellow, red, and orange as the cake’s primary decorative colors, but you
should use colors that you know are special for the couple. In addition, if blending
colors into fondant doesn’t appeal to you, check out the range of already-made colored
fondant available in craft and baking stores as well as online. This cake is shown on the
fifth page of the color section.
Tools: 9-x-13-inch cake pan, #1 icing tip, #2 icing tip, coupler, round fondant or cookie 
cutters in the following sizes: 3-inch, 2-inch, 13⁄4-inch, 1-inch, and 3⁄4-inch
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 45 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 11⁄2 hours plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 24 servings
For the cake:
For the frosting:
1 batch Buttercream Frosting (see Chapter 8)
1 batch Royal Icing (see Chapter 9)
For the decorations:
3 4.4-ounce sheets ready-to-use white fondant
Orange food coloring gel
Red food coloring gel
Lemon yellow food coloring gel
Confectioners’ sugar
Assembling and decorating the cake
1 Level the cake (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of buttercream frosting
to the cake, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
2 Frost the cake with buttercream, and return it to the refrigerator to chill while you pre-
pare the decorations.
3 Dab orange coloring gel into one sheet of fondant with a toothpick, and knead it to mix
the color in evenly; add more gel to get the desired color. (You may want to wear plastic
gloves to keep your hands dye-free!) When you’ve turned a sheet into a colored ball,
place it in a sealed plastic bag to keep from drying out. Repeat the process with the red
and yellow coloring gels and the other two sheets of fondant.
1 batch Honey Cake batter (recipe follows)

257
Chapter 16: Lifting a Fork to Weddings and Anniversaries
4 Sprinkle confectioners’ sugar on your work surface, and roll out the orange fondant ball
to a thickness of 1⁄8 inch. Cut one 3-inch circle, two 13⁄4-inch circles, two 1-inch circles,
and two 3⁄4-inch circles. Set them aside.
5 Roll out the red fondant to a thickness of 1⁄8 inch, and cut two 2-inch circles, one 13⁄4-inch
circle, two 1-inch circles, and three 3⁄4-inch circles. Repeat with the yellow fondant.
6 Remove the cake from the refrigerator, and place the large orange fondant circle in the
center of it. Arrange the remaining circles (orange, red, and yellow) all over the cake.
Bend them over the edges and stick them to the sides of the cake as well, if you like. 
7 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, a #2 tip and royal icing. Pipe the anniversary date or
years married in script on the large orange circle in the center of the cake. Refit the bag
with the #1 tip. On the smaller circles, pipe family names, important dates, and mean-
ingful locations.
Honey Cake
43⁄4 cups sifted cake flour
41⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
11⁄2 cups vegetable oil
11⁄4 cups honey
13⁄4 cups granulated white sugar
3⁄4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
5 eggs
11⁄2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 rounded teaspoons instant espresso
powder
3⁄4 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour the cake pan.
2 Dissolve the espresso powder in 12 ounces of boiling water. Let it cool to room 
temperature.
3 In a large bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 
cinnamon. Make a well in the center of this mixture.
4 In a separate large bowl, combine the oil, honey, sugars, eggs, vanilla, espresso, and
orange juice. Mix lightly, and then pour the mixture into the well in the dry ingredients.
5 In a mixer outfitted with the whisk attachment, mix the ingredients on low speed, just
until blended (about 2 minutes). Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for 45 minutes,
or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
6 Let the cake cool in its pan for 20 minutes before running a knife around the edges and
inverting it onto a cooling rack to cool completely.

For anniversaries, I’m also fond of a double ring cake, in which you shape two
10-inch double-layer cakes into interlocking rings (see Figure 16-3). After out-
lining the rings, you can pipe on dates, years, names, or initials.

f you’re looking for a reason to get your cre-
ative juices flowing and whip up a creative, deli-
cious, and visually appealing cake, look no further
than your calendar. With the seasons, holidays,
and various other special occasions, each year
abounds with opportunities for creative cakes.
This chapter mixes some decorating elements that
I cover in other chapters with a few new techniques and ingredients to put
you on track to creating some spectacular celebratory cakes.
Bringing Seasonal Treats 
to Your Decorating
Candy corn, conversation hearts, or shamrock mints, anyone? Almost every
holiday has its own unique confections that you can incorporate into your
cake decorating plan. Not only are such treats appropriate for your occasion,
but they also make decorating a snap!

Graduation Cake

As each holiday or season rolls around, be on the lookout for treats and
sweets that could be the perfect accompaniment — or even play a starring
role — in your special cake.
Seasonal confections are just that — seasonal. For instance, cinnamon chips,
which are particularly good for fall and harvest themes, may only be avail-
able in your grocery store for a few months in the fall, so stock up when you
can. Similarly, brightly colored marshmallow confections in the shapes of
chicks and bunnies are only available around Easter, and some chocolate 
candies come in seasonal colors that you can find only at certain times of
the year. So if a product has a good shelf life and you’ve deemed it a favorite,
stock up! You can always use it in the appropriate season, or it may be just
what you need for another cake’s design at another time of the year.
Saluting Spring and Summer
The spring and summer seasons bring great opportunities for decorating
cake. For these spring and summer cakes, you get to work with a range of
seasonal colors while trying out a variety of piping techniques and — in one
cake — marzipan molding. A garden patch adorned with sweet crops, lemony
cupcakes, and a razzmatazz red, white, and blue confection all promise to
make your cake (and you!) a hit at warm weather gatherings and celebrations.

Garden Path Cake
After winter passes and spring fever hits, this cake is guaranteed to wow guests with 
its whimsical marzipan vegetables (which I cover in Chapter 12) set against a dirt back-
ground of finely ground chocolate wafers.
I’ve made this cake for many birthday celebrations, but the carrot cake flavor and over-
all design is versatile and works with a variety of occasions; it’s an ideal theme for Easter
or home-themed bridal showers. A version of this cake is shown in Figure 17-1.
Tools: 12-x-18-inch cake pan, bamboo skewer, 6 drinking straws, #6 icing tip, #7 icing tip,
#67 icing tip
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Baking time: 50 minutes plus 30 minutes for cooling
Decoration time: 3 hours plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake:
2 batches The Best Carrot Cake Ever batter
(see Chapter 6)

For the decorations:
261
Chapter 17: Savoring Holidays and Special Occasions
For the frosting:
3 batches Cream Cheese Frosting (see
Chapter 8)
10 marzipan tomatoes
10 marzipan pumpkins
6 marzipan carrots
8 marzipan eggplants
10 marzipan lettuce heads
4 marzipan watermelons
24 chocolate wafer cookies, finely ground
1 cup candy rocks
Leaf green food coloring gel
Preparing the cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the cake pan, and line it with parchment
paper. Then grease and flour the parchment.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6, and pour it in the pan.
3 Bake the cake for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with
moist crumbs attached. Remove the cake from the oven, and let it cool in the pan for
10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a cooling rack.
Decorating the cake
1 Prepare the marzipan vegetables as instructed in Chapter 12.
2 After the cake has cooled completely, level it (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat
(thin layer) of cream cheese frosting to the cake, and refrigerate it for 1 hour. 
Frost the cake all over, and refrigerate again for 1 hour.
3 Using a bamboo skewer, etch a 4-inch wide pathway that winds the length of the cake.
4 Position drinking straws end-to-end along each side of the pathway to serve as a 
temporary barrier between the chocolate dirt and the path.
5 Use a large soup spoon to carefully pour the dirt into the garden area on either side of
the pathway. Press the chocolate down lightly with the back of the spoon.
6 Lift off the straws, and place the candy rocks along each side of the pathway to mark it.
7 Lay out your garden of marzipan vegetables on each side of the path. (I like to group
the crops together — a bunch of tomatoes in one spot, a bunch of eggplants in another
spot, and so on.)
8 Mix 2 cups of cream cheese frosting with leaf green food coloring gel. Outfit a pastry
bag with a coupler, a #7 tip, and the green frosting.
9 Pipe your desired message on the path.

10 Outfit the green frosting bag with a #67 tip, and make leaves around the border of the
cake. Switch to a #6 tip, and finish off the leaves with tendrils. (Check out Chapter 11 for
help piping leaves and tendrils.)
11 Place candy rocks along the base of the cake.

1 batch Most Excellent White Cake batter
(see Chapter 6)
2 batches Buttercream Frosting (see Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
1⁄2 cup seedless strawberry jam
1 batch Blueberry Compote (recipe follows)
11⁄2 cups flaked sweetened coconut
3 cups fresh strawberries (washed, hulled,
and dried)
11⁄2 cups gummi stars in red, white, and blue
Star decoration
Preparing the cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour the pan.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6.
3 Bake the cake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with
moist crumbs attached. Remove the cake from the oven, and let it cool in the pan for
10 minutes.
4 Run a knife around the edges of the cake, and then invert it onto a cooling rack to cool
completely.
Decorating the cake
1 Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to the cake, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
Then frost the cake all over with buttercream, and refrigerate it while you prepare the
decorations.
2 In a small saucepan, heat the strawberry jam over low heat.
3 Following the cake’s star shape, use a bamboo skewer to sketch a star about 11⁄2 inches
in from the outside edge of the cake. Sketch a second star about 3 inches in from your
first sketch.
4 Carefully spoon blueberry compote into the smallest star in the center of the cake.
Spread coconut around the blueberry star, staying within the lines of your star sketch.
Place the strawberries, hulled side down, along the edge of the top of the cake, all the
way around the star’s perimeter.
5 Brush the strawberries with melted strawberry jam.
6 Outfit a pastry bag with a #30 tip and buttercream frosting. Pipe stars in an outline 
the blueberry compote star, the coconut star, and the strawberry star. Also pipe stars
around the base of the cake.

7 Push the gummi stars on the sides of the cake, all the way around. If the stars don’t stick
well because the frosting’s too cold, dab the undersides of them with more frosting
before placing them.
8 Insert the star decoration into the center of the blueberry compote star.

Having Fun in the Fall
Before you leap headlong into the year-end holidays, savor the feeling of
fall with a few festive cakes. Halloween and Thanksgiving are ripe with cake
decorating possibilities, and each offers up an array of goodies to help bring
on the fun.

Chapter 17: Savoring Holidays and Special Occasions
Haunted Mansion
The recipe for this spooky showstopper calls for fudgy chocolate cake layers, but you
can also make it out of honey cake (see Chapter 16 for a recipe), which imparts a sweet
fall scent. And although you have to stack up a few cakes for this creation, you don’t
have to worry about using dowels because you have enough support from underneath.
The skeleton pops and cupcake picks in the decorations list are easy to find around
Halloween time. And you also may find additional candies or novelties that you’d like
to include in the windows and on the lawn of this haunted place. This cake is shown on
the second-to-last page of the color section.
Tools: Two 91⁄8-x-51⁄4-inch loaf pans, two 10-inch square cake pans, #4 icing tip, #7 icing tip,
#10 icing tip, #67 icing tip, food processor, meat tenderizer mallet
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Baking time: 30 minutes plus 30 minutes for cooling
Decoration time: 11⁄4 hours plus 2 hours for refrigeration
Yield: 12 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
2 batches modified Cocoa Chocolate Cake
batter (see Chapter 6)
6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
For the frosting:
1 batch Stiff Decorator Frosting (see Chapter 8)
2 batches modified Stiff Decorator Frosting
(see Chapter 8 and instructions that follow)
2 tablespoons cocoa powder

Preparing the fudgy chocolate cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the cake pans, and line them with parchment
paper. Then grease and flour the parchment.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6, but for each batch, melt 3 ounces of
chopped semisweet chocolate in 2⁄3 cup boiling water. Stir the mixture until smooth and
slightly cool. Mix the chocolate into the cake batter after the eggs but before the flour.
3 Bake the cake loaves for 30 minutes and the squares for 40 minutes. Cool all the cakes
in the pans for 10 minutes, and then run a knife around the edges of each cake. Invert
the cakes onto cooling racks, and then invert them again so that they’re right side up.
4 Prepare two batches of Stiff Decorator Frosting as described in Chapter 8, but in each
batch, whisk 1 tablespoon cocoa powder into the confectioners’ sugar.
5 After the cakes have completely cooled, cut one loaf cake in half vertically. Set one half
aside, and cut the other half into quarters, keeping one quarter, and discarding the others.
(The remaining quarter piece is one eighth-loaf.)
6 Level the cakes (two squares, one loaf, one half-loaf, and one eighth-loaf). Apply a crumb
coat (thin layer) of chocolate decorator frosting to each cake, and refrigerate them for 1
hour. Frost the cakes again, and refrigerate them while you prepare the decorations.
Decorating the cake
1 Prepare a cake board that’s approximately 18-x-24 inches in size. Use plywood or fiber-
board that’s wrapped with cake foil or Halloween wrapping paper covered with clear
heavy cellophane wrap.
2 Stack the cakes toward the back of the board as follows: Set the two square cakes one
on top of the other to form the bottom floor of the house. Center the loaf cake on top
of the bottom floor; set the half-loaf on top of that floor; and set the one-eighth piece on
top of the half-loaf to form a witch’s perch.
3 Lay lengths of licorice around the top and base of each level, except for the witch’s
perch.
268
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
For the decorations:
1 pound black licorice
4 2-x-4-inch squares of chocolate (from a 7.5-
ounce chocolate bar)
Black food coloring gel
Red red food coloring gel
36 red and purple square-shaped sour hard
candies, broken into jagged pieces with a
meat tenderizer
14.4-ounce box chocolate graham crackers,
finely ground in a food processor
4 skeleton pops
2 ghost cupcake picks
2 pumpkin cupcake picks
1 plastic glow-in-the-dark skull-and-
crossbones ring
1 witch cupcake pick

4 Using chocolate frosting as glue, affix chocolate bar squares to the center of the bottom
layer to make the mansion’s door.
5 Mix 2 cups of chocolate decorator frosting with black food coloring gel. Outfit a pastry
bag with a coupler, a #7 tip, and black frosting.
6 With black frosting, pipe a square window on either side of the mansion door. Pipe four
square windows on the second story of the house, three square windows on the third
story, and an oval-shaped window on the witch’s perch. Also pipe a doorknob and an
awning on the door.
7 Mix 1 cup of white decorator frosting with red food coloring gel. Outfit a pastry bag with
a coupler, a #4 tip, and red frosting. Along the top edge of the first three floors (not the
witch’s perch), pipe a string of pointed red drips to look like seeping blood.
8 With an icing spatula, spread 2 cups of untinted chocolate frosting in front of the house.
9 Outfit the black frosting bag with a #10 tip, and, over the chocolate frosting yard, out-
line a crooked walkway leading to the front door. Fill in the walkway with crushed hard
candies.
10 Spread the chocolate graham cracker crumbs on either side of the walkway. With the
black frosting bag, pipe frosting onto the candy tops of the skeleton pops. Scatter the
skeleton pops to resemble trees in the mansion’s yard, sticking them into the frosting
in the front yard, and mound chocolate crumbs at the base of each pop. Refit the black
frosting bag with a #67 tip, and pipe drooping black leaves on the skeletons’ hands.
11 Stick the ghost picks and pumpkin picks on the second and third floors of the mansion,
and push the skull-and-crossbones ring into the oval-shaped window on the witch’s perch.
Insert the witch pick into the very top of the house.

2 batches Brown Sugar Cake batter (recipe
follows)
For the frosting:
2 batches Buttercream Frosting (see Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
Black food coloring gel
Leaf green food coloring gel
Sunset orange food coloring gel
Banana, unpeeled
Preparing the cake
1 Prepare the Brown Sugar Cake batter according to the recipe that follows. However,
with two pans in the oven, rotate the pans midway through the baking time.
2 Let the cakes cool in the pans for at least 10 minutes, and then run a knife around the
edges. Invert the cakes onto cooling racks, and then invert them again so that they’re
right side up.
3 After the cakes are completely cool, apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of buttercream
frosting, and refrigerate them for 1 hour.
Decorating the cake
1 Divide and tint the buttercream frosting as follows: 1 cup black, 1⁄2 cup leaf green, and
the remainder orange.
2 Turn one cake upside down, and frost it with orange buttercream. Put the other cake on
top of it, right side up, and frost the entire cake orange. With the last coat of frosting,
frost the cake with a downward motion to create the striations found on a real pumpkin.
3 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, a #10 tip, and black frosting. On the side of the pump-
kin, pipe two triangles for the eyes, one triangle for the nose, and a series of smaller tri-
angles for the mouth.
4 Cut the banana in half, and cover it with green frosting. Insert it stem side up into the
hole at the top of the pumpkin.
Brown Sugar Cake
This is one of my most favorite and most requested cakes. Its caramel flavor also pairs
well with milk chocolate frosting (see Chapter 8 for a recipe).
3 3⁄4 cups sifted cake flour
11⁄2 teaspoons baking soda
2 1⁄4 cups vegetable oil
2 1⁄4 cups dark brown sugar
3 eggs
11⁄2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
11⁄2 cups buttermilk

1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a Bundt pan with baking spray that contains
flour, and set it aside.
2 In a medium bowl, combine the cake flour and baking soda. Stir them together with a
balloon whisk.
3 In a large mixing bowl, combine the oil and sugar, and beat the mixture until blended.
4 Add the eggs to the oil and sugar mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add the vanilla, and beat to blend.
5 Add the flour in four additions, alternating with the buttermilk. (Begin and end with the
flour.) Mix each flour addition just until blended.
6 Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 50 minutes, or until a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached.
7 Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a cooling rack to
cool completely.

Cornucopia Cake
If you’re eager to incorporate cake into your Thanksgiving buffet — or if you just want
to lay off the pumpkin pie for a change — this not-too-sweet confection won’t disappoint.
Taking some time with the piped lace design makes it look as if the cornucopia is sitting
on a tablecloth. This cake is shown in Figure 17-4.
Tools: Two 9-inch round cake pans, #2 icing tip, #6 icing tip, #47 icing tip, 6-inch diameter
plastic lid
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Baking time: 40 minutes plus 30 minutes for cooling
Decoration time: 1 hour plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 12 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
1 batch modified Delicious Yellow Cake batter
(see Chapter 6)
3 teaspoons instant espresso powder
1⁄2 cup half-and-half
1⁄2 cup coffee liqueur
For the frosting:
1 batch Stiff Decorator Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
1 batch Milk Chocolate Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)

Preparing the Coffee-Flavored Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the cake pans, and line them with parchment
paper. Then grease and flour the parchment.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6, but stir 3 teaspoons instant espresso
powder into the sifted flour, and substitute 1⁄2 cup half-and-half and 1⁄2 cup coffee liqueur
for the milk.
3 Bake for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist
crumbs attached. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, and then run a knife
around the edges. Invert the cakes onto cooling racks.
4 After the cakes are completely cool, torte both cakes so that you have four layers. Frost
one layer with milk chocolate frosting, and set the corresponding layer on top. Add a layer
of frosting, followed by the third layer, another layer of frosting, and the final layer of
cake. Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of frosting to the entire cake, and refrigerate it for
1 hour.
Decorating the cake
1 Divide and tint the stiff decorator frosting as follows: 2 cups egg yellow and 2 cups har-
vest brown.
2 Frost the cake with yellow frosting.
3 In the center of the cake, use a toothpick to sketch an oval. Lay the ice cream cone on
its side in the center of the oval.
4 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, a #47 tip, and brown frosting. Pipe a basket weave
design on the ice cream cone cornucopia.
5 Arrange the Swiss fruits so that they appear to tumble out of the cornucopia.
6 Outfit the brown frosting bag with a #6 tip, and pipe an oval border around the cone, 
following your previous sketch.
7 Place the 6-inch plastic lid along the sides of the cake and press gently to create an
impression of downward arcs. With the #6 tip and brown frosting, pipe little beads
along the arcs. Also pipe a row of beads all around the base of the cake.
8 Outfit the brown frosting bag with a #1 tip, and in between the oval and the downward
arcs, pipe a lacy design with a pattern of curves and lines.

Christmas Tree Cake
This cake for a holiday crowd always draws raves . . . particularly after it’s cut and 
partygoers get a peek at the color inside.
You can play around with your own color scheme for this cake. I like a multicolored
approach because it reminds me of vintage Christmas trees decorated with glass 
ornaments of several different colors.

I like to keep the borders and edges free of any decoration so that the eye is drawn
directly to the tree that appears to be standing amidst beautiful, fluffy snow. This cake
is shown on the last page of the color section.

coconut into the batter before pouring it into the pan.
3 Bake for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist
crumbs attached. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before you run a knife
around the edges. Invert the cakes onto racks to finish cooling.
4 After the cakes are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat
(thin layer) of buttercream frosting to the cakes, place one atop the other, and refriger-
ate them for 1 hour.
Decorating the cake
1 Frost the stacked cake with buttercream. Use a bamboo skewer to sketch a free-form
lake in the center of this cake. With a fork, carefully hollow out the lake, digging out the
cake to a depth of 1 inch (only dig out the top layer of cake).

2 Prepare the gelatin as follows (don’t use the directions on the box!): With a large bowl
of ice water standing by, pour the gelatin into a large glass measuring cup, and stir in 2
cups of boiling water. Set the measuring cup in the bowl of ice water, and continue stir-
ring the gelatin for about 8 minutes, just until it thickens very slightly. Pour the gelatin
into the lake on the surface of the cake. Refrigerate at least 2 hours for the gelatin to set.
3 Tint 2 cups of stiff decorator frosting leaf green. Outfit a pastry bag with a #864 tip and
green frosting.
4 Rest the ice cream cones upside down on a piece of wax paper. Moving vertically up
and down the cones, pipe boughs on all the cone trees with the green frosting. Start
at the base of each cone, and draw the frosting away from the cone to a point before
moving onto the next bough. Place the trees on the cake around the lake.
5 Position marshmallows around the scene to resemble snowy drifts. Skewer the bottoms
of the penguins and gummi bears with toothpicks, and insert them into the cake. 
Celebrating Other Occasions
Not that you need a reason to bake and decorate a cake, but if you’re looking
for a reason, truth be told, you can celebrate any day of the year with cake.

Groundhog Day, Arbor Day, Secretary’s Day, next Tuesday . . . the possibilities
are endless, and you’re only limited by your imagination.
For this section, I’ve picked a traditional holiday and a pair of life events to
make even sweeter with beautiful cakes.

Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
Heart-O’-Mine Cake
This heart-shaped cake was initially designed for a celebrity’s Valentine’s Day celebra-
tion-for-two. However, where hearts are concerned, any day’s the right one to express
love.
Candy hearts are part of the decoration for this cake, but you also can make all the dec-
orations with frosting if you have the time. This cake is shown on the last page of the
color section.
Tools: Two 8-inch heart-shaped cake pans, three #7 icing tips
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Baking time: 35 minutes plus 1 hour for cooling
Decoration time: 11⁄4 hours plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 12 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
1 batch modified Most Excellent White Cake
batter (see Chapter 6)
4 ounces white chocolate, chopped
For the frosting:
3 batches Buttercream Frosting (see 
Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
Fuchsia food coloring gel
Bright red food coloring gel
Purple food coloring gel
Fuchsia, red, and purple candy hearts
Preparing the White Chocolate Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and grease and flour the pans.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6, but melt 4 ounces of white chocolate
into 1⁄2 cup of boiling water, cool the mixture, and beat it into the batter after the egg
whites and before the flour.
3 Bake the cakes for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
with moist crumbs attached. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before 
running a knife around the edges. Invert the cakes onto cooling racks.

4 After the cakes are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7). Frost the top of one
cake, stack the other cake on top, and apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of buttercream
frosting to the entire cake. Refrigerate it for 1 hour.
Decorating the cake
1 Frost the cake with buttercream, and return it to the refrigerator to chill while you pre-
pare the tinted frosting.
2 Divide and tint the remaining frosting as follows: 11⁄2 cups fuchsia, 11⁄2 cups red, and 11⁄2
cups purple. Outfit three pastry bags — one for each color — with a #7 tip and frosting.
3 Outline the outer edge of the top of the cake with red frosting. Position fuchsia, red, and
purple candy hearts all along the top of the cake, sitting just inside the red outline.
4 Pipe stripes along the sides of the cake by alternating the frosting colors.
5 Put a conversation heart in the very center of the cake. Outline the heart in red frosting,
then in purple frosting, and finally in fuchsia frosting.
Vary It!: Instead of placing heart-shaped candies around the cake’s top border, you can
pipe hearts in different colors. To do that, use a #10 icing tip and pipe two facing upside-
down teardrops. In lieu of the conversation heart in the center of the cake, you can pipe a
message to a special someone. Just keep the script on the small and subtle side.

Housewarming Cake
This cake evokes a homey scene and scent, and you can adjust the colors to match the
palette of the home being celebrated. Edible glitter and pearls make for a very realistic
sparkly chandelier. A version of the finished cake is shown in Figure 17-6.
Tools: 12-x-18-inch cake pan, bamboo skewer, ruler, #2 icing tip, #4 icing tip, #5 icing tip,
#11 icing tip
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Baking time: 50 minutes plus 2 hours for cooling
Decoration time: 1 hour plus 1 hour for refrigeration
Yield: 32 servings
For the cake (recipe follows):
3 batches modified Delicious Yellow Cake
batter (see Chapter 6)
11⁄2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
11⁄2 teaspoons cinnamon extract

Preparing the Cinnamon Cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the pan, line it with parchment paper, and
then grease and flour the paper.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6, but in each batch, add 1⁄2 teaspoon
ground cinnamon to the cake flour, and substitute 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon extract for the
vanilla.
3 Bake for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist
crumbs attached. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before running a knife
around the edge and inverting it onto a cooling rack.
4 After the cake is completely cool, level it (see Chapter 7). Apply a crumb coat (thin
layer) of cream cheese frosting, and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
Decorating the cake
1 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #2 tip, and royal icing. On a sheet of wax paper, pipe
eight teardrops at least 1 inch apart. While the icing is still wet, shake gold shimmer
dust over the teardrops to cover them completely. Place the wax paper on a plate or
tray, and set it in the freezer.
2 Divide and tint the cream cheese frosting as follows: 2 cups ivory, 2 cups nut brown,
and 3⁄4 cup black.
3 Frost the cake with ivory frosting.
4 Use a ruler to measure 2 inches in from the sides of the cake, and sketch a frame with
a bamboo skewer. Sketch a 41⁄2-x-11⁄2-inch rectangle in the center of the frame; this is the
sofa back. Underneath the sofa back, sketch the sofa’s seat: a trapezoid that’s 11⁄2 inches
tall on each side, 61⁄2 inches across the top, and 8 inches across the bottom.
5 Above the sofa back, sketch a 5-inch tall chandelier with swag lights that branch out 3
inches at the top, 41⁄2 inches in the middle, and 6 inches at the base.
6 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #11 tip, and brown frosting. Pipe along the inside edge
of the frame, but leave a 11⁄2-x-4-inch rectangle in the center of the bottom of the frame.
280
Part IV: Sweetening Life’s Special Occasions 
For the frosting:
3 batches Cream Cheese Frosting (see
Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
1 batch Royal Icing (see Chapter 9)
Gold shimmer dust
Ivory food coloring gel
Nut brown food coloring gel
Black food coloring gel
3 2-x-2-inch gourmet marshmallow cubes
12-inch yellow marshmallow stick
12-inch pink marshmallow stick
1-ounce bag edible yellow pearls
1-ounce bag edible pink pearls

7 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #11 tip, and black frosting. Outline the frame, giving
it mitered corners. Refit the frosting bag with a #4 tip, and outline the center rectangle
on the bottom of the frame. In the rectangle, script the homeowner’s last name, such as
“The Waltons.”
8 Cut three 11⁄2-x-11⁄2-inch squares out of the gourmet marshmallow cubes, and place them
side-by-side to form the sofa’s rectangular back cushion. Snip the marshmallow sticks
to form the sofa’s trapezoid seat: one 3⁄4-x-61⁄2 inches and the other 3⁄4-x-8-inches. Stick
them all in place.
9 Outfit the black frosting bag with a #5 tip, and pipe an outline around the sofa. Add
pointed legs to the bottom.
10 Pipe the chandelier structure, making sure to include eight light holders. Place strands
of edible pearls on the frosting to give a beaded appearance.
11 Remove the royal icing teardrops from the freezer. Using an icing spatula, gently lift them
one at a time from the wax paper and slide them onto the chandelier’s light holders.

Chapter 8)
1 batch Buttercream Frosting (see Chapter 8)
For the decorations:
1 cupcake
Royal blue food coloring gel
Lemon yellow food coloring gel
Dark brown food coloring gel
1 pouch fruit streamers in the appropriate
school colors
4-x-4-inch chocolate bar square
Preparing the cake
1 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour the pans.
2 Prepare the cake batter as described in Chapter 6, and pour it into the prepared pans
and the cupcake holder.
3 Bake the cupcake for 20 minutes and the two cakes for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick
inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached. Let the cakes cool in the
pans for 10 minutes before running a knife around the edges. Invert all three cakes onto
a cooling rack.
4 After the cakes are completely cool, level them (see Chapter 7). Frost the top of one
layer, and stack the other layer on top of it. Apply a crumb coat (thin layer) of chocolate
buttercream to both the layered cake and the cupcake, and refrigerate them for 1 hour.

Decorating the cake
1 Frost the cake with chocolate buttercream, and set it back in the refrigerator.
2 Divide and tint the plain buttercream as follows: 11⁄2 cups royal blue, 11⁄2 cups lemon
yellow, and 2 cups dark brown.
3 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #18 tip, and yellow frosting. Pipe a shell border
around the top edge of the cake.
4 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #18 tip, and blue frosting. Pipe a shell border in blue
around the base of the cake. Return the cake to the refrigerator.
5 Frost the cupcake with dark brown frosting, and set it upside down in the top center of
the layered cake.
6 Outfit a pastry bag with a coupler, #10 tip, and brown frosting. Separate the fruit stream-
ers into individual, spaghetti-like strands. Measure and cut six 6-inch blue ones and six
6-inch yellow ones. Place the fruit strands on top of the chocolate square (which is the
mortarboard), adhering them with a dab of brown frosting. With the #10 tip, pipe a
circle of frosting to be the button on the top of the chocolate mortarboard.
7 Dab some frosting on the underside of the chocolate mortarboard, and place it on top
of the cupcake. Refit the dark brown frosting bag with a #6 tip, and pipe “Congratulations”
on the cake by the cap.

T
ake pride in a job well-done. This part guides you in
wrapping up the cake process by preparing your cake
for the big reveal and getting your cake to its destination
in perfect shape. I also share ways to create and decorate
cakes in a snap for last-minute functions. At this point,
you also may be so excited about your cake decorating
skills that you’re thinking about starting a cake decorating
business, but don’t make a move until you’ve read the
details dished out here.

Prepping for Showtime
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the finished product with a critical eye
 Remembering everything you need for an event
 Planning an inspired cake staging
 Getting the cake to its final destination
 Making the most of uneaten cake
W
ith an amazing cake completed and ready for its time in the spotlight
of a special occasion, you may think that you’ve reached the finish
line of the cake decorating process. However, a few more tasks remain to be
done, starting with scrutinizing the final product in order to ensure that it’s
the best it can be. As part of your final preparations, put the cake through the
paces (not literally of course) by checking and double-checking its appearance,
stability, and structure, and collect everything you need to make any touch-ups
and serve the cake in style.
This chapter covers those tasks as well as the concerns associated with
transporting your creation — a proposition that may make you nervous. I
provide recommendations on the best tools and procedures for getting your
cake to where it needs to be — safely and completely intact. You also get some
suggestions of what to do with leftover cake.
Giving Your Cake the Once-Over
I know you want your cake to make the best impression possible and fete an
honoree or celebrate an occasion in the most polished, festive way. To that
end, first congratulate yourself on your accomplishment, and then spend a
few moments inspecting your freshly decorated cake from all sides.
Not only does scrutinizing your cake’s look and decorations benefit the upcom-
ing event, but it also helps you with future cake decorating endeavors. Viewing
your cake with a critical eye and answering the questions that follow help you

identify your cake design’s strengths and weaknesses, which you can take into
account when creating the same cake or a different one in the future.
1. Examine the cake’s silhouette.
• Does it seem lopsided or uneven?
• Does the frosting completely cover the cake?
• Are the borders and edges tight and clean, or could they use some
perfecting?
2. Examine the cake’s decorations.
• Do the decorations fit on the cake well, and are they proportionate
to the cake?
• Is there too much crowding of decorations or too much design
going on?
• Is there too much or not enough blank space?
• Does every part of the decoration look like it belongs on the cake?
• Is any scripting legible? Are you certain that words and names are
spelled correctly?
3. Examine its positioning.
• How does the cake board look? Is it clean?
• Does the cake board enhance or detract from the cake?
• Is the cake board sturdy enough to transport the cake?
4. Examine the overall design.
• Does the overall look fit in with the event?
• How does this decorated cake match up with your initial concept?
• How does it compare to the sketch you made in the planning
stages?
• What changes did you have to make? Why?
• Did the colors come out like you expected?
If you have a digital camera, take and save pictures of each cake you com-
plete. It’s amazing what a camera can pick up that you don’t see when you
stare right at your cake. With the ease, speed, and advantages of a digital
camera — including the ability to instantly enlarge shots on a computer
screen — you can inspect your cake from all angles, spotting both glaring
blotches and tiny imperfections. A digital photo also gives you a visual to
refer back to if and when you decide to create a particular cake again.

Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

A Cake Decorator’s Checklist 
for the Big Day
It sounds so elementary, but a checklist that includes all the accoutrements
and accessories you need to arrange, present, and serve the cake really can
save the day. Experience has taught me that, without a list such as this, you’d
be surprised at what you can forget, particularly if you have to take the cake
to another location. (Believe it or not, I’ve heard a few humorous anecdotes
from other cake decorators that involved forgetting the cake itself!)
Include the following items on your checklist:
 The cake
 The cake board
 Materials for fast fixes (see the list later in this section)
 Candles, if appropriate for the celebration
 Accessories for the presentation table or area (see the section “Playing
around with props” later in this chapter)
 Serving implements, such as a cake knife and server or lifter
 A reference diagram for cutting (check out Chapter 22 for slicing ideas)
 A tall ceramic vessel in which to clean the serving knife between cuts
(see Chapter 22 for details)
 Plates and forks
 Decorations or edible embellishments, such as whipped cream, that will
be added at serving time
And, make sure you also know the answers to the following:
 Does the cake need to be refrigerated until the last possible minute
before serving because of its filling or frosting?
 Do you know the cake’s final location before it’s served?
 Have you established and figured out how the cake will be cut?
Suppose you take your cake out of the refrigerator or arrive at another site
with it and notice some imperfections: smushed frosting, crooked decorations,
or a crushed border. If you set aside a few extras as you prepare for the occa-
sion, you’ll be in good stead to make quick repairs. Nothing holds up a cele-
bration longer than someone having to make a trip to the store. The items in
the following list are particularly necessary to secure beforehand if you’re
serving the cake at an event outside your home.
289
Chapter 18: Prepping for Showtime

More than likely, many of these items are part of your handy cake decorating
kit (refer to Chapter 2). (If you’re serving the cake away from home, put together
a portable version of your kit that contains these items.)
 Small and large icing spatulas: These are instrumental for smoothing
out any ridges, crinkles, or similar imperfections in frosting.
 Frosting left from your decorating (and softened if necessary): Because
you never know what may happen before the cake is actually served, it’s
always a good idea to set aside a small amount of each of the colored
frostings you used on your cake. You may need to call on one or all to
repipe decorations, fix lettering, or repair a border.
 Pastry bags, couplers, and tips appropriate for your cake’s decorations:
With these tools on-hand, you can quickly outfit a pastry bag with the
correct frosting you need for a particular repair.
 Parchment paper: Usually, if your cake has been refrigerated, it holds 
up fine until serving time. But if there’s a delay or transporting the cake
takes longer than expected, the frosting may soften and become uneven.
In these situations, you can press strips of parchment paper on the frosted
surface to smooth it out.
 Office supplies, such as scissors, a tape measure, and low-tack tape:
You may need scissors to snip the pointed end of your pastry bag, a tape
measure to figure out a new placement for the cake and cake board at
the last minute, and low-tack tape to hold your cake board in place on
the table. And wouldn’t you know it? It’s when you’ve forgotten one of
these that you’ll undoubtedly need it, so plan on collecting them and
having them with you ahead of time.
Livening Up the Cake Presentation
In Chapter 7, I talk about dressing up the cake board that your beautiful cake
rests on. You may have opted to drape it in fondant or cover it with fabric or
a theme-appropriate collage under cellophane. In any case, you undoubtedly
have an eye-catching display that fits your cake and the celebration perfectly.
However, too often the thoughtful, attractive presentation only goes as far as
the cake board: The cake’s final setting, where people gather and the cake is
portioned out, is often overlooked in terms of decoration. When you have an
awesome confection that you’ve spent time designing, baking, and decorating,
don’t let all your hard work go unnoticed or be diminished by a setting that
doesn’t suit the cake. In the end, a poor setting doesn’t just take away from
the cake; it also detracts from the celebrant’s experience and the celebration
itself.
290
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

Mapping out the space
Before the event kicks off, find the best place to set up the cake. Remember
that you don’t have to just plop it down on the table where you usually eat
supper if the event is at your house. You’re likely to have several other viable
options at your home and a host of other locales. Most obviously, you can
consider a brightly festooned table outdoors if the time of year is right. But
don’t resist the urge to get creative as long as you have a sturdy platform for
your cake. For instance, you can build a miniature staircase out of bricks or
stones, or carve a miniature stage out of plywood that features your cake in
the starring role. I’ve served cakes atop a sand castle and a large dollhouse,
on a small replica of a football field, peeking out from rows of flower arrange-
ments, and even from a clean, new wheelbarrow (at a garden party).
As you consider different locations, use the following questions to narrow
down your choices:
 Does space accommodate the width and length of the cake board and
the height of the cake?
 Do you have enough space for the cake cutting implements and to cut
the cake?
 Is the setting such that you should plan on showing the cake and then
taking it to another area to cut it into servings?
 Will there be a beverage station set up near the cake? If so, is there
ample room for both the cake and the beverages?
 Will the look of your cake be hampered by cords hanging from a nearby
electrical outlet?
Playing around with props
When you choose an exact setting in which to display your cake, consider ways
to dress up that area. Start by covering the cake table with a theme- and color-
appropriate tablecloth. Then consider adding props that fit in with the theme.
You don’t want to junk up the space, but some tasteful additions really can
enhance the presentation. Consider using
 Fresh flowers in vases, pots, or even tin pails
 Tea lights or votive candles
 Uplighting, using light canisters masked by a plant or placed behind and
below the table
 Candelabras
 Garland threaded with twinkle lights
291
Chapter 18: Prepping for Showtime

 Wide, wire-rimmed grosgrain ribbon
 Tulle (even if it’s not a wedding)
 Vintage toys (for a children’s party or baby shower)
 Sports memorabilia
 Spooky candies and marshmallow ghosts and pumpkins (for a
Halloween celebration)
 Foliage, such as harvest leaves or holly
 Seashells, coral, and starfish
As you brainstorm and then decide on exactly what and how many props fit
in with your look and spark up your cake’s presentation, draw up a simple
diagram to determine their final look and placement. If you aren’t available to
stage the presentation yourself, you can give your diagram to someone else
with instructions to follow for the desired look.
Transporting Your Creation
With the aid of some handy items, most cakes, such as a two-layer or quarter-
sheet, are a snap to transport. Still, you need to position them properly in the
right packaging so that they don’t arrive collapsed or with all the frosting
shifted to and oozing down one side.
Taking measurements for fit
One of the biggest (and silliest!) mistakes that cake decorators make is over-
or underestimating the vehicle space needed for a cake. You don’t want to find
yourself standing outside an open car door ready to place your cake inside
but stumped by the realization that the space is actually too small, the cake
is too tall, or there’s way too much room for the cake to shift and slide around.
Make things easier on yourself by collecting the following information:
 The width and length of your cake board
 The height of your cake
 The measurements of the available space in your car
Compare the measurements of the board and cake with the car space mea-
surements to ensure that everything will fit. If necessary, arrange for a larger
or smaller vehicle in which to transport your creation.
292
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

Before you have your cake in hand, clear the appropriate space for the cake
inside the car, and gather up the right transportation materials, which I cover
in the next two sections.
Using standard gear and procedure
Usually, unless you’re dealing with a tiered wedding cake (see the next section)
or similar cakes that involve separate tiers, I find that it’s easiest to transport
a cake that’s already on its board, such as a layer or sheet cake. For those,
follow these steps:
1. Procure a sturdy cardboard box that’s slightly larger than the cake
board and slightly taller than the cake.
If you can’t find a heavy cardboard box and your cake is small, it may fit
in a large baking pan lined with dish towels.
2. Place clean dish towels in the bottom of the box, and rest the cake
board on top of the towels.
3. Position the box in the allocated space in your car, making sure that 
it sits level, with no room to slide along a seat, on the floor, or in the
trunk.
To keep the cake box from moving, you may need to brace it with other
boxes or large items.
As an additional measure of safekeeping, get a plastic cover like the ones that
come on cakes from the grocery store bakery and place it over the cake before
you set it in the box. If necessary, tape the cover to the underside of your cake
board so that the cover doesn’t accidentally slide into one side of the cake.
You can get plastic covers at cake decorating stores, but in a pinch, friendly
employees at grocery store bakery counters may also let you purchase them.
If you’re assembling a tiered cake on-site, you can carry the cake board 
separately and store the layers (which should be on their cardboard bases)
in cake boxes, covered plastic carrying totes, or cast iron skillets lined with
clean dish towels.
Stabilizing more complicated cakes
When you have a multitiered or extra-large cake that you’ve created for a spe-
cial occasion, you need to take extra precautions, procedures, and packaging
into account to get it to its final location.
293
Chapter 18: Prepping for Showtime

Following are the safest procedures for transporting certain kinds of towering
or tiered cakes:
 For assembled, tiered cakes, tap a long, slender dowel down through
the center of the cake to hold the tiers in place (refer to Chapter 16 for
instructions).
Traveling with any tiered cake that’s already assembled is a risky propo-
sition because it could topple over during the drive if it’s not properly
secured. If you go this route, definitely have another person on board to
be the cake monitor while you drive, or vice versa. Trying to drive while
keeping your eye on a cake is even riskier than getting a cake to a site in
good shape.
Whether or not this dowel method is the best for your cake depends
on the size of the cake and the length of the journey to the site. For
instance, if you have three tiers that are 12-inches and smaller and your
drive is ten minutes, getting your cake safely to its site is a better bet
than transporting five 14-inch tiers on a 45-minute drive. Use common
sense, and if you’re into attempting this method, start small. Don’t put
yourself under undue pressure. Particularly with larger cakes that have
to be tiered, you’re better off assembling the tiers on-site.
 For tiered cakes with pillars between the layers, transport the layers
separately (refer to the preceding section) and assemble the cake on-site.
In this case, each layer should be on a separator plate that you situate on
the pillars as you build the cake at the location.
 For large sheet cakes with extra-fancy decorations or lots of embellish-
ments, invest in a large, hard plastic box with a cover. Get one that’s just
the right size to snugly fit a large cake board and has a nonskid bottom.
In all cases, if you have a large embellishment for the top of the cake, don’t
put it on until you’re at the site. Otherwise, it may fall off or over, messing up
your frosting or — worse — taking a tier or layer with it.
For special transporting items such as large boxes, plastic covers, and long
dowels, cake decorating supply companies sell a bounty of goods (many of
which are devoted to tiered cakes) that ease cake transportation. In addition,
check out craft stores and catering stores, which I turn to time and time again.
Caterers constantly deal with traveling to other sites to serve their fare, so
any store that appeals to them is bound to have these types of products that
can help you, too. And if you can find a wholesaler that specializes in restaurant
supplies but is open to the public, you’ll be amazed at some of the products
that are suitable for cake transportation. (Chapter 21 contains the ten best
places to find and buy cake supplies.)
294
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

What to Do with Leftover Cake
There’s a good chance your cake will be so fabulous and so delicious that not
a crumb will be left, but on that rare occasion that you have a few pieces left
over, don’t just toss them in the trash can. Share the remaining cake with others
right away, or preserve it for future enjoyment.
Give parting gifts
If you can bear to part with pieces of your beautiful cake, plan ahead and 
purchase disposable plastic containers or precut squares of aluminum foil
in which to package and send pieces away with departing guests.
If the event is upscale or glamorous, experiment with other (perhaps more
creative) packaging. For example, to the thrill of delighted departing guests,
I’ve doled out leftover squares of cake in vellum take-out boxes bedecked
with organza and laminated tags; cupcakes in cellophane bags tied with
striped grosgrain ribbon; and slices of cake in striped miniature hatboxes.
Refrigerate for good taste
Depending on the kind of cake you serve, you can probably keep it in the
refrigerator for two to three days after the event. Most cake-frosting combina-
tions, like white cake and buttercream frosting and chocolate cake iced with
ganache, handle refrigeration well. But if your cake’s frosting or filling is made
with whipped cream, the cake isn’t likely to last beyond the big night because
the cream breaks down and leaves you with a soggy mess.
For optimal results, refrigerated cake needs to be stored properly. Don’t just
relegate it to the refrigerator resting on paper party plates. Either place pieces
in plastic or glass containers with sealed tops or wrap them well in cellophane.
In my opinion, you should always refrigerate leftover cake. Even if it’s in a
tightly covered container, never leave it simply sitting on the counter after
the event. Although it’s considered safe to keep some cakes at room tempera-
ture in a sealed container, I prefer refrigeration to absolutely ensure safety.
(And, truth be told taste-wise, I’d rather have cold cake than what’s been left
out at room temperature.)
With one exception, I don’t recommend freezing leftover decorated cake pieces
unless you’re really intent on having someone who wasn’t at the event try
your cake. A frozen cake just doesn’t have the same taste or appeal of a
freshly prepared one. If it’s going to sit in your freezer for a couple of days
after the event before it gets eaten, I say toss it.

Chapter 18: Prepping for Showtime

The exception: I realize that the tradition of keeping the top tier of your wedding
cake and enjoying it on your first anniversary is cherished and time-honored. To
freeze that tier, wrap it in two layers of cellophane and then in aluminum foil. If
possible, tuck it away in a freezer that isn’t opened on a regular basis.
Rework it for another occasion
In some situations, you may intentionally make more cake than you need for
one event because you have a second event soon after. If you’re intentionally
planning to serve what’s left of one designed cake at an occasion the next day,
don’t just present it in an unattractive pan or on a plate with plastic wrap laid
over it.
Instead, figure out a way to rechristen it to be appropriate for the new event.
Showcase the cake in a completely new light, such as being precut: Display
the pieces individually by laying them out in a festive pattern or design on
a freshly prepared cake board or by presenting them on dessert plates.
How you serve the cake the second time around may be the least of your
problems. Your cake may have some wild design that looks messy in individual
pieces served at an event with no relation to the one the cake was baked and
decorated for. In that case, consider embellishing the cake slices or pieces or
the plates you present them on in order to tailor them more for this event.
Whatever you do, don’t overwork the pieces. In other words, don’t refrost
them or keep adding embellishments just to hide the initial decoration. If
refashioning one cake for two occasions seems impossible, don’t force it;
take advantage of a great reason to bake another cake!

t’s 10 p.m. and your son comes clean that he
promised you’d provide a homemade cake for
his teacher’s birthday tomorrow. Or perhaps it’s
midday and you just found out that your spouse is
desperately trying to impress a client who’s dropping by after dinner tonight.
Let’s face it: You don’t always have the luxury of time in turning out a beautiful,
delicious cake. If the thought of assembling a lot of ingredients and rolling up
your sleeves drains your energy at the end of a long day, know that turning
out an elegant or impressive cake doesn’t have to be a demanding, exact
endeavor.
For a quick assist, you can rely on several conveniences, starting with cake
mixes, to help you make an ordinary cake special in a jiffy. Further, a vast 
collection of swift decorative techniques and handy embellishments can
transform plain cake layers into a centerpiece dessert. In this chapter, you
discover several possibilities and some unexpected tips for baking and deco-
rating a cake in the throes of a time crunch.
Keeping a Well-Stocked Pantry
With the demands of your daily life, whipping up a pretty cake in a pinch 
may seem overwhelming. But just a handful of easily found products
make the process a snap . . . and fun. To make any cake decorating endeavor
easier — and especially last-minute ones — keep some items on hand in your
pantry at all times.

The essentials
At a minimum, your pantry should include:
 Cake mixes in different flavors, such as white, yellow, and chocolate
 Instant pudding mixes in different flavors, such as vanilla, chocolate,
lemon, and pistachio
 Chocolate chips
 White and dark chocolate bars
 Candied citrus fruits
 Nuts, such as walnuts and pecans
 Extracts, such as vanilla, lemon, and rum
 Confectioners’ sugar
 Cocoa powder
Decorating odds and ends
Your imagination may surprise you when it comes to turning simple candies
or on-hand pantry items into fun or classy decorations. Even when your time
is limited, keep design in mind. Simple items may fill in a word that you’ve
sketched out on a cake; some may form blossoms of a flower; others easily
could be part of a geometric pattern, swirl, or polka dots; some would look
lovely pressed into the sides of a cake.
Although you may feel like you’re pressed for time, it’s always wise to sketch
out an idea on paper before you commit your design to cake. A little planning
saves you frustration (and more time) in the long run.
The following items can really transform a cake in very little time. Notice that
many of these decorations are impressive and impactive without being com-
plicated or expensive. Take stock of other items available in your grocery
store (or in your cupboard right now) to tailor the list for your own tastes
and needs.
 Candy canes
 Cinnamon sticks
 Chocolate sprinkles
 Chopped chocolate
 Crushed peppermint candy
298
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

 Edible glitter
 Edible pearls
 Grated lemon peel
 Grated orange peel
 Gumdrops
 Halved or chopped pecans
 Maraschino cherries in different colors, such as red, blue, and yellow
 Metallic candy balls (also known as dragees)
 Multicolored sprinkles
 Nonpareils
 Pastel mints
 Peppermint patties
 Pillow mints
 Sanding sugars
 Slivered almonds
 Toasted or tinted flaked coconut
None of these pantry items are meant to be dumped on a cake to add color,
texture, or interest. You never want a decoration — no matter how simple
or quick — to look like it was just an afterthought to frosting a cake.
Quick Fixes with Mixes
Although almost everyone prefers the taste of a cake made from scratch, cake
mixes are an alluring convenience. Usually you just have to add eggs, oil or
butter, and water, and — presto! — you have cake batter. Plus, they come in 
a variety of flavors, so you can offer many different kinds of cake fairly easily
for events like dessert buffets or bake sales.
I like to reserve baking with cake mixes for occasions that pop up unexpectedly.
I don’t ever like to serve store-bought baked goods, so when I’m in a jam at
home, I turn to a cake mix for help.
Although cake mixes offer a shortcut, baking rules still apply. Read recipes
from start to finish before beginning. Use eggs that are at room temperature.
Follow mixing and cooking times, and check for doneness. Using a cake mix
isn’t a license for laxity . . . but it undeniably shaves minutes off mixing and
clean-up.

Lori’s Chocolatey-Chippity Cake
Although not made from scratch, this cake is one of my most requested creations. It
made its premiere in 1999 when I had to come up with several small cakes for a film 
festival’s dessert buffet following an evening’s worth of screenings. (My wife’s film was
featured, thus the name of the cake!)

Barbara and Vera’s Rum Cake
Sometimes a single ingredient instantly makes a dessert seem more adult. As such, this
rum cake should be reserved for grown-up functions. The mother and daughter who
shared this recipe with me face a constant dilemma: Whenever they bring another dessert
to a party, people always complain that they were looking forward to this rum cake!
Tools: 10-inch Bundt pan, #22 icing tip, bamboo skewer
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Baking time: 1 hour
Yield: 12 servings
1 cup chopped pecans
18.25-ounce box yellow cake mix
3.4-ounce box vanilla instant pudding mix
4 eggs
1⁄2 cup water
1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
1⁄2 cup dark rum
1 batch Rum Glaze (recipe follows)
1 cup whipping cream
12 pecan halves
1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray the Bundt pan with cooking spray that contains
flour. Sprinkle the chopped pecans in the bottom of the pan, and set the pan aside.
2 In a large bowl, combine the cake and pudding mixes, eggs, water, oil, and rum. Beat on
low speed just until blended, and then beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping
the bowl twice during mixing to incorporate everything.
3 Bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake
cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving platter.
4 Pierce the top of the cake all over with a bamboo skewer, and drizzle rum glaze over the
top and sides of the cake.
5 Just prior to serving, in a medium bowl, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Outfit a
pastry bag with a #22 tip and whipped cream. Pipe 12 stars around the top of the cake,
and press a pecan half into the center of each star.
Rum Glaze
1⁄4 cup unsalted butter
1⁄4 cup water
1 cup granulated white sugar
1⁄2 cup dark rum
1 In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Stir in the water and sugar, and bring the mixture
to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
2 Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the rum.

When You Have Only Minutes
Don’t think that an absence of time equals a cake that looks like it was hastily
assembled. It’s possible to make a cake look festive and ultra-appealing in
just a matter of minutes.
Making it special, quickly
With your endeavors geared toward a speedy — but beautiful — finish, put
your own spin on an array of both delectable and stunning decorations that
can add depth and style to your cake.
Getting fresh
In your time-saving take on cake decorating, don’t forget the fresh approach
that lends class, sophistication, and good taste to cakes. Part of the beauty
using fresh items is that they’re easy to find and don’t require a lot of arrang-
ing or dressing up. Fresh decoration options include:
 Fresh flowers: Unsprayed varieties such as roses and daisies are great,
colorful choices.
 Fresh fruits: Whole strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackber-
ries dress up a cake and add flavor. If you have time to make frosting, you
can tint it green and pipe leaves and vines in between the fruits.
 Fresh herbs: Consider this original, earthy option for lending beauty 
and fragrance to your cake. Some unusual varieties that enhance a
cake’s aroma and presence include chocolate basil, lavender, lemon 
verbena, and mint.
Saucy encounters
Sometimes decorating a cake means decorating the plate the cake will be
served on. Sauces and purees in a variety of colors, flavors, and textures —
many that can be purchased from the grocery store or gourmet shop —can
enliven your presentation, particularly when they’re used in tandem with
each other.
For instance, if you’re serving white cake, place raspberry puree and mango
puree in squeeze bottles. Make a pool of raspberry puree on the plate, and
then decorate it with dots of mango puree. Or you can decorate the plates
with puree hearts. To do that, just squeeze out a generous dot of raspberry
puree, and draw a line through it with a toothpick to pull the puree into a
heart shape.
You also can make stars out of sauce or puree by drawing lines out of a dot at
several points. Another option is to create scrumptious swirls: Using squeeze
305
Chapter 19: Quick Cakes and Last-Minute Decorating Techniques

bottles, draw a whirling circle with one sauce, and then draw another circle
inside that one with a different sauce.
Decorating a cake plate with sauce or puree works well if you aren’t satisfied
with how your final cake turned out. Just slice it up and serve it on decorated
plates.
Chocolaty endeavors
Chocolate provides a tasty, quickly mastered embellishment for cakes. The
following sections walk you through a few variations.
Chocolate curls
All you need to make these chocolate curls is a block of chocolate, a veg-
etable peeler, and a microwave. Follow these simple steps:
1. Microwave the chocolate for just a few seconds to soften it slightly.
2. Drag the peeler down the side of the chocolate.
The longer the piece of chocolate, the longer the curls will be.
3. Place the curls on the cake using tongs or a bamboo skewer (so that
the heat of your fingertips doesn’t melt or smudge the chocolate), and
refrigerate the cake until you’re ready to serve it.
Chocolate shavings
Nothing could be easier than chocolate shavings. Simply run a chocolate
block against a fine grater, and let the chocolate shavings fall onto the sur-
face of your cake.
Chocolate shapes
With a simply crafted pastry bag, you can pipe fun chocolate shapes that
harden quickly. Follow these steps:
1. Place a sheet of wax paper on a cookie sheet.
2. Place 1⁄2 cup semisweet chocolate chips in a resealable plastic food
storage bag. Microwave the bag on high for 30 seconds.
3. Knead the bag to mix the chocolate, and then microwave it on high
for 10 or 20 seconds, until the chocolate is completely smooth.
4. Snip off a corner of the bag, and pipe the chocolate out through the
hole. Pipe hearts, stars, initials, numbers, or any desired shape onto
the wax paper.
5. Let the shapes sit on the wax paper until the chocolate sets (but don’t
refrigerate them). After the chocolate has hardened, gently lift the
shapes from the wax paper, and place them on your cake.
306
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

Chocolate leaves
Not only are these chocolate leaves quick and easy to make, but they’re also
a strikingly realistic addition to any cake. To make them, follow these steps:
1. Gather up clean, nontoxic, unsprayed leaves. Make sure that they’re
completely dry.
2. In a small bowl, combine 1⁄2 cup semisweet chocolate chips with 1 tea-
spoon vegetable shortening. Microwave on high for about 45 seconds,
until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth when stirred.
3. Use a soft pastry brush to brush melted chocolate onto the back of a
leaf. Leave a bit of the bottom of the leaf free of chocolate.
4. Repeat with the other leaves, setting them on a wax paper-lined
cookie sheet as you finish them. Refrigerate until the chocolate is
firm, about 10 minutes.
5. Remove the leaves from the refrigerator, and gently peel the choco-
late away from the leaves. Arrange the chocolate leaves on your cake
as desired.
Salvaging a broken cake
If it so happens that your cake falls, collapses, or crumbles when you turn it
out of the pan, don’t panic. With a fondue pot and a few other ingredients,
you can serve up your not-so-pretty cake in a very tasty and fun way.
307
Chapter 19: Quick Cakes and Last-Minute Decorating Techniques
Cake Fondue
One of my favorite cake celebrations revolves around this recipe, in which you cube a
cake, melt a chocolate mixture in a fondue pot, and put out accompaniments for guests
to decorate their own dipped cubes.
Tools: Fondue pot
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 12 servings
1⁄4 cup milk
1 cup butterscotch chips
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 prepared cake (9-inch round or 9-x-13-inch
rectangle) cut into 11⁄2-inch cubes
Flaked coconut, crushed candies, sanding
sugars, sprinkles, chopped nuts, and other
accompaniments

1 Combine the milk, butterscotch chips, and chocolate chips in the fondue pot. Warm
over low heat, stirring until melted.
2 Add the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla, and stir until thoroughly combined.
3 Set out the cake cubes, and place the various accompaniments in individual bowls.
Instruct guests to dip the cake cubes individually into the fondue pot and immediately
press them into a chosen accompaniment.
Fast designs
Although picking up a pastry bag and piping flowers, words, and other
embellishments is the most common form of cake decorating, it’s not always
the swiftest time-wise. Therefore, I’ve come up with a wide range of sweet
designs that you can create in a flash.
Flying high balloons
Press round candies, such as pastel mint wafers, onto a frosted cake, and
then attach balloon strings made of cherry or strawberry licorice.
Patchwork cake
Use a toothpick to section off the top of the cake into squares or diamonds.
Then fill in the shapes with crushed candies (see Figure 19-1). This design
looks best on square or rectangular cakes.
Swiss dot cake
Cover the entire cake (top and sides) with white chocolate, dark chocolate,
milk chocolate, or butterscotch chips, or a mixture of these.
Carnival cake
With a bamboo skewer, divide a round cake into eight sections. On every other
section, press multicolored nonpareils into the frosting (see Figure 19-2).
A toast to Mondrian cake
One of my kids has recently become fascinated with the 1970s sitcom The
Partridge Family and the multicolored, Mondrian-inspired painting that covered
the group’s tour bus. To recreate this look on a cake, divide a round, rectan-
gular, or square cake with thick licorice strips or thin licorice shoelaces. Fill
the resulting geometric shapes with different colored crushed candies, cook-
ies, or colored sugar (see Figure 19-3).

Frosting flowers
If you decide to take the frosting plunge with a limited time frame, your cre-
ations can be more representative than life-like. For instance, five dots that
form a circle with a different color in the center easily looks like a flower,
even if it’s not a multipetaled gum paste rose. Play around with frosting
colors to make different flower varieties.
Candy creations
Carefully sprinkled colored candies turn into festive swirls in a flash. You 
can also use candies to form the petals of a flower or spell out a name.

Decorating Business
In This Chapter

I
nterested in taking your cakes to the next level? This chapter gives you
the lowdown and steps involved in turning the art of cake decorating into
a moneymaking enterprise.
Everyone has a reason to celebrate, which means that, in the world of cakes,
you have untold opportunities for entrepreneurial adventures that are reward-
ing both creatively and financially. That’s the side of planning, organizing, and
executing a cake decorating business that’s a snap. However, just because 
it’s creatively stimulating and results in delicious, eye-appealing confections
doesn’t mean that it’s not a business. You have to carefully consider and
review all the necessities involved with getting a business up and running and
keeping it successful. For example, you have to balance your books, make
sure you meet your city’s or county’s health department rules and regula-
tions, keep your equipment in working condition and your staples stocked,
source out new ideas, keep existing customers happy, and attract new cus-
tomers. Whew! And that’s just for starters.
But if you embark on this entrepreneurial adventure, you can rest assured
that, with the right combination of know-how and chutzpah, all your efforts
can truly pay off, making all those necessities niceties. With a successful
cake decorating business, you reap profits, are in charge of your own time,
and continually broaden your creative spectrum, bringing lip-smacking
smiles to hundreds (and maybe even thousands!).

Setting Up Your Own Business
You love cake decorating, and you can’t believe how much it stimulates you
creatively. And you know that there’s money to be made . . . I mean, what’s
with all the bakeries around, right? Plus, people have been talking about
your cakes; they’ve complimented you at events featuring your cakes and
even asked if you’ve thought about providing cakes for other occasions.
Heck, someone even thought you were a professional cake decorator and
asked for a price list!
If you’re giving some serious thought to the idea of a cake decorating business
(or if you’re already booked to make a cake for an upcoming affair), take a step
back to take stock of your particular situation. Although baking and decorat-
ing cakes provides an amazing amount of fun, enjoyment, and satisfaction,
setting up a business to make money doing it requires commitment, the right
equipment, a modicum of financial savvy, and time.
Deciding if you have what it takes
In order to make it as a professional cake decorator, you have to have know-
how, skills, drive, specialties, and even equipment. I discuss all these elements
in this chapter. But the first step in creating a cake decorating business is reflec-
tion and assessment . . . of yourself. Think about the aspects of cake decorating
you truly enjoy, and spend some time answering the following questions. You
may even want to share your answers and discuss these topics with trusted
friends, family, or colleagues.
 Do you particularly enjoy the baking, the art involved in designing, the
joy on a cake celebrant’s face, or all of these aspects of cake decorating?
 What has prompted you to consider cake decorating as a commercial
venture rather than simply an artistic one or a hobby?
 Do you have the time to build and maintain the business (including han-
dling contracts and billing as well as marketing and possibly a Web site)
as well as undertake the cake decorating?
 Do you already have the skill set necessary to turn out a succession of
different, special cakes? If not, do you have a single specialty you can
concentrate on?
 If you plan to rely on a specialty, will it be enough to carry your business?
 Do you know the best way to go about expanding your repertoire and
skills?
 Do you have the resources to purchase (or rent) necessary equipment?
 Do you have resources you can call on to guide you in accounting, insur-
ance, legalities, and marketing?

Doing your research
Don’t just dive into a cake decorating start-up business because someone 
at a party where your cake was served placed an order for another cake of
yours. Rather, do your homework by conducting research on several fronts.
 Figure out your market, the people who will regularly buy your cakes
and enthusiastically refer you to others for their celebration cake needs.
The people who may be willing to pay for your particular cakes may be
the parents of children in your child’s class who you know will probably
be hosting at least one birthday party this year. Fellow members of a
civic club, bowling league, or church group could be ambassadors for
your business, giving you leads on people who have upcoming events
that call for a cake. Outside of social circles, consider restaurants and
hotels in your area; local eateries may be interested in featuring a unique
cake as a specialty dessert menu item.
 Analyze the specialties and the unique selling proposition you can
offer your customers.
Make a list of all the bakeries and stores you can think of who sell specialty
cakes, and for each retailer, list the characteristics that make your cake
superior (think appearance, ingredients, and taste) to their offerings.
(See the section “Determining your specialties” later in this chapter for
more on figuring out what sets your cakes apart.)
 Get a rough estimate of how much you can charge by researching costs
of cakes in your area and costs involved in making and decorating your
cakes.
It’s perfectly fine to charge more than a grocery or warehouse store
because your cake will almost certainly cater to your celebrant’s style,
be more tailor-made for the event and the celebrant’s tastes, and not be
a mass-produced creation. In the beginning, you should also pay close
attention to how much it costs for you to make and decorate your cakes.
Figure out
• The cost of the ingredients and materials you need
• An estimate of all the time involved, including working with the
customer, making and decorating the cake, collecting necessary
ingredients, and transporting it to the event site
• The cost of rentals you may need for equipment, ovens, and
kitchen space
The price of a cake shouldn’t be simply a total of the cost of ingredients.
When you know what confections you’ll make and what specialties you’ll
focus on for the bulk of your business, decide how much those things
cost so that you can make a profit on each and every cake you make and
decorate.

Chapter 20: Starting a Cake Decorating Business

Determining your specialties
Even if your town has a bakery on every corner, there still may be room for
your cake creations because you can offer a product that’s superior on many
fronts. You just have to determine what categories your product will be a
leader in.
To figure out what specialties your cakes will focus on, think about what has
pulled you into considering a cake decorating business and what you think
makes your cakes special. Use your answers to these ten questions to identify
ways to distinguish your cakes from the local competition:
 Do you have a cake flavor that everyone loves but few have heard of?
 Do you use imported ingredients?
 Are your cakes made completely from scratch?
 Are your designs singularly unique? For instance, are your cakes particu-
larly stunning or humorous or colorful in their design?
 Do you have signature frosting colors that no one can mimic?
 Do you use decorations that are particularly hard to find?
 Do you use only fresh flowers in your decorations?
 Do all your cakes include amazing marzipan creations or beautiful gum
paste flowers?
 Do greetings on the cakes feature clever and memorable wordplay?
 Do your cakes come in interesting sizes or shapes (such as ovals and
hexagons) or only one size (such as cupcakes)?
In organizing your business from the start, you must examine and define your
cakes’ incomparable qualities to come up with what marketing experts call a
unique selling proposition, or USP. Your USP is what you know makes your cakes
so different, so special, and so alluring that customers will flock to your busi-
ness over others.
For instance, the combination of delicious, unusual cake flavors with whimsi-
cal designs was my USP. My red velvet cake was often the talk of a party — so
much so that people often came up to me to ask if they could order one. When
I started making red velvet cakes in Southern California, they were (and, often,
still are) quite a novelty even though they’re a staple of my Southern heritage.
My other unusual cakes included the Bubblin’ Brown Sugar Cake (with a subtle
caramel flavor) and the Best Carrot Cake Ever (refer to Chapter 6 for the recipe).
The cakes were out of the ordinary and delicious, and people always knew that
the designs would take the cake to the next level, either with artwork and
words that were very specific to the celebrant, vivid colors, or a humorous
rendering for the event.

Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

Regarding the upsides
When you’re considering starting a cake decorating business, you can’t
ignore the risks; being cautious isn’t cowardly, it’s smart. But the world 
of cake decorating isn’t totally treacherous — there are many upsides to
encourage you. For example, there’s no limit to the profits you can reap,
and you’ll be absolutely amazed at how flexible your schedule becomes. In
fact, if you have access to the right equipment and workspace, you literally
can bake and decorate any time of the day or night. Some of my best work
has been done at 3 a.m.!
As I mention throughout this book, cake decorating allows you to be creative,
experiment, and flex your artistic muscles. Your cakes are your canvases, your
frostings are your paints, and embellishments are your assorted, colorful accou-
trements. And being responsible for the sheer delight of partygoers as they
dive into a cake they absolutely love is tantalizingly priceless (and the fact
that you get paid in addition to the warm fuzzy feeling is even better!).
My many cautious words in this chapter aren’t intended to scare you away
from a cake decorating business but rather to make sure that you take neces-
sary steps to avert costly mistakes and time-consuming surprises if you con-
tinue on toward your goal of starting a cake decorating business.
Finding a Location for Your Business
One of the greatest difficulties for an aspiring cake decorator who wants to
turn a passion into a business is finding a kitchen suitable for cake decorating
endeavors.
Working out of your home
When some people decide to launch a cake decorating business, they auto-
matically think to just start it at home. That’s not a bad idea, but it’s not quite
as easy as it sounds; you have to consider some legalities and the equipment
involved.
Tackling pesky legal issues
Many people operate cake decorating businesses out of their homes, but you
must make sure that doing so is permissible in your city. If it is, you may have
to outfit your kitchen specially, expand it, or build another one to ensure safe
food handling and proper sanitation that meets government regulations. For
example, you may need to have three-compartment sinks, a private trash col-
lection service, a separate entrance just for your kitchen, and an arsenal of
315
Chapter 20: Starting a Cake Decorating Business

required equipment such as National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)–approved
food storage containers and cutting boards.
Research the regulations in your area pertaining to working in a kitchen that
meets county health standards for food preparation and distribution. Check
with your county’s health department to get started on what you need to do
and have to pass inspection in your area.
Gathering equipment
Some Web sites claim that you can start a cake decorating business with little
more than an oven and a microwave. Those two appliances are essential, but
they really aren’t all you need. To work out of your home kitchen, you’re likely
to need the following equipment (depending on how big your business gets):
 A mixer that can accommodate large batters and extra mixing bowls for
the mixer
 A convection oven
 Ample refrigeration for tall cakes or multiple cakes
 A supply source for boxes, carrying cases, and the like
 A supply source for unusual tips, standard decorating fare, and pans in
different shapes
 A dependable and accommodating vehicle for safely transporting your
works of art
For more info on kitchen equipment and layout, see Chapter 3.
Scouting for commercial kitchen space
Perhaps the rules and regulations involved in working out of your home 
are daunting; your existing kitchen is far too small to host a business; your
kitchen isn’t up to code and making the necessary changes and additions is
cost-prohibitive; or your kitchen is the hub for a busy family and subjecting
your cakes to the constant activity of daily life is a scary proposition.
Whatever your situation, you may have to find a kitchen outside your home
in which to work. An increasingly popular option is the commercial kitchen.
Commercial kitchens are facilities where food professionals can rent space 
by the day, hour, or week. Many are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Because the kitchens are licensed by health departments, you don’t have to
worry about bringing anything up to code.
Commercial kitchens generally feature restaurant-quality equipment (convec-
tion ovens, stand mixers, and the like) as well as ample refrigeration and
316
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

counter space and sometimes even storage space. Depending on the size of
the facility and the number of separate kitchens available, the commercial
facility may be organized such that different spaces are devoted to different
kinds of culinary pursuits; in other words, a pastry chef wouldn’t work in the
same area and with the same equipment as a chef who specializes in garlic-
infused Italian cuisine.
For a commercial kitchen to approve your use of the facility, you probably
need to have a business license and liability insurance. In addition, the 
facility may require you to be certified in safe food handling, which entails
attending a class and paying a minimal fee. Be sure to inquire about any
requirements the facility may have.
Find a commercial kitchen to rent in your area by checking listings in your
local phone books, and also ask around at bakeries, catering supply houses,
and cooking stores in your area. In addition, visit www.chefskitchens.com,
a site for a commercial kitchen located in Los Angeles. Even if you don’t plan
to work in the L.A. area, the description, application process, rental costs,
rules, and other information available on the site may be invaluable to you in
trying to find a commercial kitchen suitable for your needs.
In addition to commercial kitchens, a social caterer, bakery, or restaurant 
in your area may be willing to rent space to you for baking and decorating
cakes, particularly if you’re willing to do your work during the location’s 
off-hours. Some cake decorators rent out a kitchen in a church or school
because of their restaurant-quality equipment.
Not-for-profit facilities may not be viable options for you to operate out 
of because you’re running a for-profit business and therefore could end up 
with a problematic business and health-department licensing situation. And
despite its impressive equipment, a not-for-profit facility may not be health
department–licensed. Just because a space has restaurant-quality equipment
doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a licensed kitchen.
Getting Down to Basics
Just because cake decorating is extremely creative doesn’t give you an
exemption from using business savvy in setting up shop and attracting and
keeping happy customers. Baking cakes, mixing frosting, and coming up with
fanciful designs is fun, but you still have to take care of an array of practical
demands required to make money on any business venture. Having a kitchen
for an office doesn’t mean you don’t have to handle a variety of traditional
office duties.
317
Chapter 20: Starting a Cake Decorating Business

Running a cake-centric office
Review the following list of business necessities. Granted, at the outset, you may
not need every last one (such as a fax line or Web site), but most aren’t very
expensive, and some — from a legal standpoint — are absolutely required.
 Office stationery, such as business cards, letterhead for invoicing, order
forms, and contracts
 A dedicated phone line and e-mail address to communicate with cus-
tomers, and a fax line to receive order forms
 A Web site to showcase your work and communicate with potential and
existing clients (jump to the section “Designing a Web site for your
designs” later in this chapter for more)
 A city or state business license, which is different than a food preparation
license (see the next section)
 A federal ID number for tax purposes and to obtain a resale number, which
allows you access to restaurant supply stores, wholesale florists, and the
like for wholesale prices on equipment, tools, and embellishments
 Business insurance, because sometimes bad things happen and it’s nice
to be covered when they do
 Access to professionals such as a lawyer and accountant, preferably
with experience in the culinary industry
For more information on starting, running, and managing a business, check
out Business Plans Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
Finding out about licensing
I mention legal issues earlier in this chapter, but this recommendation bears
repeating: Find out the rules in your area regarding food preparation and
retail sales for your decorated cakes as well as zoning restrictions for where
you can do your work. Start by contacting your county’s health department.
Cake decorating isn’t as common as, say, catering, so your first contacts may
not know how to categorize your business or answer your questions immedi-
ately. But be patient and persistent. If you get transferred around, let each
person know what you’re asking for — the county’s rules and regulations for
operating a cake decorating business — and take down the name and phone
extension of each person you speak with. You’ll undoubtedly think of ques-
tions after you hang up, so try to get a single contact that you can return to
for follow-up information.
318
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

Armed with the necessary information, you can do what’s required to operate
as a fully functional and law-abiding cake decorating business.
Drawing up contracts
Don’t be content just to take orders over the phone and assume that verbal
agreements suffice when you and a customer come to terms on the cake for
an event. The colors involved, the wording on the cake, the kind of filling, the
number of layers, the price . . . it’s just too much to leave to chance, so create
a contract in which all the details are recorded for both parties to review and
sign off on.
Contracts for decorated cakes usually don’t have to be fancy affairs. 
For instance, the contract may be a dated document with the following 
information:
 A description of the cake, including its dimensions, flavors, and design
details
 The date of the event for cake delivery
 The charges associated with the cake
 A place for both you and the customer to sign indicating your under-
standing of the cake and services to be provided
An exception to using this simple contract is in the case of a wedding cake.
Because of the cake’s bigger size, more intricate designs, and typically higher
costs, the contract should contain more detail about the cake you’re providing.
For instance, if someone other than yourself will serve the cake on-site, you
can’t guarantee the actual number of servings (the cake cutter may divvy up
the cake in fat wedges far larger than what you would have done or anticipated);
therefore, the contract should only have an estimate of the number of serv-
ings. However, in the contract, you can guarantee the size of the layers and
provide a suggested diagram for how the cake should be cut.
Contact a reputable lawyer to review your contract and let you know if it
includes all the right information or needs to be tweaked.
Attracting a Clientele and
Marketing Your Cakes
As you launch and grow your business, you constantly must be thinking
about ways to attract new customers while you keep your name fresh with
your existing ones.
319
Chapter 20: Starting a Cake Decorating Business

Spreading the word
People are passionate about good cakes that they’ve enjoyed. So when you’re
looking to launch your cake decorating business, begin your marketing
efforts by contacting your cake fans. Let them know that you’re launching a
cake decorating business and would love to have them — and their friends,
colleagues, family, and business associates — as customers.
Before you contact the first person, finalize a price list and put together a
portfolio of your creations. That may mean making several cakes just for the
purpose of taking pictures of them, but people want to see your work . . .
even if you’ve been highly referred.
Outside of your social circle, think about professional ties you already have
to companies with a vested interest in cakes. For instance, do you know any
professionals involved with events, such as wedding or party planners, cor-
porate event organizers, special event planners, restaurant managers whose
venues frequently host parties, and even florists and photographers? Aligning
yourself with individuals in these fields can bring you loads of referrals and
lasting connections with many people who have the potential to come back
to you repeatedly to order cakes.
Do you plan to specialize in children’s birthday cakes? Wedding cakes? Cakes
for dinner party dessert buffets? Your target audience dictates the media you
should focus on with your advertising. For example, if you specialize in kids’
cakes, your initial advertising should be low-cost but high-visibility placements,
such as in community parenting magazines, local weekly newspapers, and
even church bulletins.
Brainstorming cool marketing methods
Before you start your business — and certainly as it expands — identify and
monitor your target audience and niche demographics. They dictate where
you should plunk down your marketing dollars to reach those most likely to
buy your beautifully decorated cakes.
Marketing encompasses a variety of tools, including advertising and publicity,
but it also refers to nontraditional methods. To spread the word outside typi-
cal marketing streams, keep in mind that virtually any occasion you provide a
cake for is an opportunity to market your work beyond the event at hand. For
instance, consider placing your cakes in a specially designed cake box that’s
distinctly yours and displays your contact information. And provide your client
at an event with business cards to be passed out to anyone at the party who
inquires about ordering a cake from you.
320
Part V: Thinking Outside the Cake Box 

An interesting way of marketing your product to increase your exposure is 
to donate cakes to community events, fundraisers, end-of-season parties
for sports teams, PTA committee meetings, church functions, and so forth.
Don’t go broke giving away free cakes. Ascertain which events will have the
highest exposure to your target audience, and plan your donations accordingly
for maximum benefit.
If you’ve been hired to make a truly unique cake for a high-profile event, take
advantage of the occasion’s attention by issuing a press release in your city’s
newspaper about your cake with a picture of it. Or if the cake is particularly
eye-catching, send the release to local news stations, especially if you know
that they’re covering the event. With a little advance notice, TV crews may
make sure to get footage of your cake at the event.
Designing a Web site for your designs
In recent years, creating and maintaining a Web site for a business has become
more of a necessity than an option.
It’s true that Web sites can require substantial financial investments to create,
launch, and maintain. However, you also can set up a fairly simple but nice-
looking site for a modest sum. Your site can be a billboard, meaning that it
just contains your company name, logo, and contact information. Or you 
can make it highly interactive, complete with online order forms, a gallery
of cake photos, price lists, frequently asked questions, and even a shopping
cart component for visitors to purchase cake decorating supplies. Also con-
sider a feature that allows visitors to enter their e-mail addresses to receive
communication via e-mail newsletters.
Suppose you’ve just started a cake decorating business called The Coolest
Cakes Ever, and you specialize in cakes that highlight extreme sports (such
as skateboarding, surfing, and mountain climbing) for boys, girls, and sports
aficionados. You procure a domain name for your business: www.thecoolest
cakesever.com. On your Web site, you have a brief description of your cake
decorating business, your phone number and e-mail address, and a selection
of photos that spotlight some of your best work. Existing and potential cus-
tomers can visit your site to get a feel for your specialty cakes and how your
business operates.
For creating marketing materials that best suit your business and tackling 
a host of marketing initiatives such as designing a Web Site and launching 
publicity and advertising campaigns, check out my book Streetwise Business
Communication: Deliver Your Message with Clarity and Efficiency (Adams Media,
2007).
321
Chapter 20: Starting a Cake Decorating Business

The cakes on your site are your calling card. Invest in sharp photography 
for images that appear on your Web site. Depending on your expertise in the
photography arena and your own photography equipment, you may need to
hire a professional photographer with a high-resolution digital camera to give
your cakes the detailed attention they deserve. 
People often think that, with a fully functioning and interactive Web site, they
never have to talk to a customer again. What a mistake that is! Your Web site
should welcome customers, not shut a door on them. Letting them take some
information down from the Web site and communicate with you by e-mail to
confirm some details is acceptable, but remember that, in phone and face-
to-face conversations with your customers, you learn about any upcoming
events for which they may need more cakes, find out about referrals, and get
ideas and feedback for growing your business and keeping customers satisfied.

cheery, classic styling with a sense of humor, and, in so doing, they’ve 
unwittingly provided me with cake decorating inspiration.
For even more inspirational fodder, Kate Spade has even ventured into elegant
china (perfect for serving cake slices) and stationery with cake illustrations.

Chapter 22
Ten Ways to Cut a Cake
In This Chapter
 Formulating a plan of attack
 Divvying up cakes of all shapes and sizes
N
eedless to say, there’s more than one way to cut a cake. Even if the best
way to slice and dice seems absolutely obvious, you may find that the
servings don’t come out all the same. Or in the case of a double- or triple-tiered
cake or a three-dimensional cake, you may find yourself totally stumped when
trying to figure out the best way to yield the most even, nicest-looking pieces.
In this chapter, I explain that, no matter if the cake is round, square, rectangu-
lar, hexagonal, or petal-shaped, a cake doesn’t have to be parceled out in
uneven pieces that leave the cake remains a mishmash of crumbs. Trust me:
If you can bake it, you can cut it!
Coming Up with a Game 
Plan before You Cut
A well-cut cake starts with a game plan. Don’t just come at your cake with a
sharp knife and hope for the best. Instead, draw a diagram of the cake and
map out how you’ll divide up the whole cake (or refer to this chapter).
Use a ruler to divide your cake diagram into sections that flow into subsequent
pieces. If you feel like getting really technical, draw your diagram to scale and
use a calculator to size up pretty and even pieces of cake that aren’t squished,
marred, or irregular.
When you’re ready to start cutting, arm yourself with a sharp knife and a cake
server. The pair doesn’t have to be the sterling silver set Aunt Betty gave you
when you got married. A simple set will get the job done just as well. The knife

should be slightly serrated with a blade that’s between 7 and 8 inches long.
The cake server allows you to lift each piece of cut cake and neatly transfer it
to the dessert dish.
In addition, have a clean dishtowel and a tall round vessel of hot water close
by as you cut. To keep the slices tidy, you’ll occasionally need to dip the knife
into the hot water and then wipe it off between cuts, particularly if the cake
you’re cutting is sticky or very moist. The water vessel can be a tall, wide
glass, but I prefer to use a colored, earthenware vase that’s food-safe and
used only for food prep such as this (that is, it never holds flowers). If you
use a clear glass, you end up with an unattractive glass of murky water stand-
ing by your beautifully presented cake.
Round Cakes
With a cake up to 9 inches in diameter, you slice the cake in half and then into
quarters. Cut each quarter into equal wedges, depending on how big you want
the pieces to be (see Figure 22-1). For cakes that are 12 or 14 inches in diame-
ter, see the section “Round Wedding Tiers” later in this chapter.
Square Cakes
For a 10-inch square cake, slice it in half vertically and then in half horizontally.
Divide each of the four resulting quadrants into even pieces according to the
number of pieces you need or the desired serving size (see Figure 22-2). If the
square is 12 or 14 inches, use a ruler to divide the cake into three even vertical
columns and then three columns horizontally. Divide up each quadrant depend-
ing on how big you want the pieces to be.

Sheet Cakes, Straight Cut
Cut the cake in half vertically and then in half horizontally. From there,
depending on the size of the cake and the size of the pieces you’d like to
serve, gently mark off each quadrant first vertically, and then horizontally,
with hash marks to guide your slices (see Figure 22-3).
Sheet Cakes, Diagonal Cut
To mix things up a bit, cut the entire length of the sheet cake diagonally
through the center, creating two triangles. On each side of the center 
diagonal line, mark off a succession of evenly spaced diagonal lines. Then
make one horizontal cut through the center of the cake, bisecting the diagonal,
and follow that with evenly spaced straight horizontal cuts on each side (see
Figure 22-4).

Oval Cakes
With an oval cake, your best bet is to get slices out of your mind and instead
concentrate on squares. Divide the cake into four quadrants (each with a
rounded arc on the outside). Slice each quadrant with evenly spaced vertical
cuts, and then divide those cuts into squares (see Figure 22-5).
Hexagonal Cakes
For a 9-inch or larger hexagonal tier, begin by etching out a smaller hexagon
in the center of the cake. From there, you can carve out pieces in different
shapes, as shown in Figure 22-6.

Petal-Shaped Cakes
Although the shape is different, you can follow the same guidelines for cutting
a petal-shaped cake as you would for a round cake (see the section “Round
Cakes” earlier in the chapter and check out Figure 22-7).
Heart-Shaped Cakes
I find the heart-shaped cake the hardest to slice up because it’s basically
impossible to produce a majority of same-sized pieces unless the cake is 12
inches or larger at its widest point. With a heart of any size, divide the large
central area into quasiquadrants that you can cut evenly into squares (see
Figure 22-8). You’ll still have odd-shaped pieces around the edges, but fortu-
nately, the heart reminds everyone that love conquers all . . . even when it
comes to cake cutting.

Round Wedding Tiers
Round wedding tiers tend to throw people for a loop. They look at the cake
and know they don’t want to just hand out extra-big slices, but how do you
make sense of such a large round? It’s easy. Separate the layers first, remov-
ing any dowels or separators in the process. Then use your knife to cut a
large circle inside one layer’s circumference; cut more evenly spaced circles,
working your way toward the center of the cake so that it essentially looks
like a bull’s-eye. Cut individual pieces from the outer ring, working your way
around the circumference of the cake. The pieces should look like wedges
with squared-off ends (see Figure 22-9). After you’ve served up the outer ring
of cake, move on to the next ring, and so on.
Square Wedding Tiers
After making sure that you’ve removed any set pieces necessary to the archi-
tecture of your cake, cut square-shaped wedding cake tiers by following the
same process as you use for round wedding tiers, except that you use a square

as your guide. Start by slicing an inner square, and then another square inside
of that, and another, if necessary. Then cut the first rim into even squares,
working your way around the outside edge of the cake. Repeat the process on
the inside squares (see Figure 22-10).

Ten Easy Baking and 
Frosting Alternatives
In This Chapter
 Piping simple patterns with frosting
 Adding tasty toppings
 Playing with shapes and accessories
I
f you’ve committed to decorating a cake and find yourself suddenly short
on time or completely overwhelmed by the prospects, don’t just head out
to your grocery store’s bakery department. Take a more personal but just as
easy approach with the baking and frosting alternatives covered in this chapter.
You may even be surprised by some of these quick methods that professionals
routinely call on. 
The resources and techniques covered in this chapter work for both formal
and informal presentations, for shaving time off your preparation, and for
fashioning decorations. I even include a couple of solutions if you don’t want
to whip up frosting.
Finding Elegance in Simplicity
Never underestimate the sheer beauty of a cake itself. I’m not recommending
that you smooth some frosting all over the cake and call it a day, but a few
fast-and-furious decorating moves can make for an absolutely beautiful cake.
For example:
 Pipe a simple bead border (with a #5 tip) all around the top edge and
base of the cake.
 Pipe big puffs of swirled star frosting (with a #21 tip) all over the top of
the cake.

 Frost the cake using a #789 tip. You can either leave the striations that
the tip creates or smooth them out with an icing spatula. (This tip 
doesn’t fit with a coupler; you simply drop it into a pastry bag.)
Playing with Cupcakes
Cupcakes have recently found favor with a whole new legion of fans, but
they’ve always presented an endless stream of decorating opportunities.
First off, because they’re small, they bake faster than cake layers. And even
though they’re little, you can put them together to make something big and
visually impressive. For instance, you can put them together to form a bigger
design that’s pulled apart as guests take their pieces. I’ve used cupcakes as
roses in a big rose bush with greenery interspersed among the cakes, and 
I’ve also used them as balloons joined together by fanciful string against a
painted sky backdrop on a table. Another design idea is to form a tortoise
shell out of several cupcakes and make one cupcake the turtle’s head.
You also don’t necessarily need to painstakingly frost each cupcake. Dip and
swirl them in thin icing for quick coverage. The roses in my cake bush were
made using rose cakelet molds, and the thin icing actually helped delineate
each rose’s unfurling petals; a thick frosting would have hidden those details.
Rolling Out Allover Patterns
This method of design requires some skill but moves very quickly. First pick
a repetitive pattern that you’re partial to, such as swirls, gingham, dots, open
paisleys, plaids, herringbone, lace, squiggly lines, or geometrics like circles,
squares, or diamonds. Outfit your pastry bag with a small tip (such as a #2,
but you can go up to a #7), and cover every square inch of your cake with the
pattern. If you’re new to this type of work, go for a pattern that’s more forgiving
and less rigid, like lace or swirls.
Melting Away Frosting Worries
Don’t have the energy (or ingredients) to frost your cake? Serve a cake in its
(attractive) baking pan and, immediately upon removing it from the oven, top
it with miniature marshmallows and coconut. As an example, for a 9-x-13-inch
cake, you need 4 cups of mini marshmallows and 1⁄2 cup coconut to cover.
Or you can cover a warm cake with any one of a variety of chips available in
stores, such as chocolate, butterscotch, or mint. Use 2 cups for a 9-x-13-inch
cake. Melt them in a microwave on high for one minute, and stir until smooth.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Smooth the mixture onto the cake with an offset spatula, create a pattern
of swirls, or, once spread, use a decorating comb to make ridges. Just work
quickly. Similarly, you could make a chocolate glaze (see Chapter 9 for the
recipe) and pour it on the cake.
A s’mores-like topping is popular, too — especially for late-evening dessert
buffets. Sprinkle equal parts chocolate chips, marshmallows, and chopped
nuts on a warm cake, and place it under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, until
the chocolate is slightly warm and the marshmallows are toasted.
Pinning on Ribbons
Although certainly a favorite for cakes at weddings and showers, ribbon adds
chic elegance to cakes for all occasions. If you find a ribbon with colors or a
pattern particularly appropriate for a gathering or an honoree, place it around
the bottom of the frosted cake for a classic touch. Fasten it with a beaded pin
(that you remove before cutting and serving the cake, of course!). Use ribbon
that’s thick and sturdy (such as grosgrain) and that has a strong color or
design so that it isn’t too sheer to be seen and doesn’t absorb the frosting.
Freezing Layers for Future Use
This idea requires you to plan ahead, but trust me, you’ll be glad you did.
When baking a cake, bake extra layers and freeze them for up to 1 month.
After they’re cooled, wrap them tightly in cellophane and then again in alu-
minum foil. To thaw, let the wrapped layers sit at room temperature for a
couple of hours. Then just frost, decorate, and enjoy!
Applying Sprays and Shimmer Dusts
One of the newer developments in cake decorating is sprayable, edible color
that makes a white cake vibrant with just the push of a button. Sprays are
available in many colors and can even be used with stencils.Generally, you’ll
just take the can of spray, point it, and press the nozzle to spray around your
cake. However, cans have different widths of applications, so practice on a
paper towel first to get an idea of the coat it makes and the area it covers. In
addition, depending on the size of your cake (or how much you’re covering),
you’ll probably want to cover the area underneath the cake with paper
towels or newspaper to keep areas other than the cake color-free.
Another option for quick but striking decoration is shimmer dust. The dusts
come in an array of colors (metallics, pastels, and rich hues) and can turn a
339
Chapter 23: Ten Easy Baking and Frosting Alternatives

bland base into a sparkling, lustrous affair. You can mix the dust with a few
teaspoons of lemon extract, and apply the mixture with a small craft paint-
brush to the cake’s surface. Or, if your cake’s frosting is particularly sticky
(such as cream cheese frosting), you can simply sprinkle the colorful dust
on the cake’s surface.
Getting More Out of Cookie Cutters
Put all those cookie cutters in the back of your pantry to work. Use them as
outlines for stenciling, or cut shapes in colored marzipan or fondant. Apply a
bit of frosting to the underside of the marzipan or fondant shapes, and press
them onto the cake.
Using Intricate Molds
Molded pans turn out cakes that attract oohs and aahs. With attention rightly
diverted to the striking shape of the cake, there’s less pressure on you to dec-
orate every inch of it. Besides, the intricate designs of many molds would be
obliterated by gobs of thick frosting. Often, a light dusting of confectioners’
sugar or cocoa powder or a drizzle of powdered sugar icing is all you need
for a finishing touch.
Gathering Bouquets
When someone says “bouquet,” you may immediately conjure up an image of
flowers. That works fine, but bouquets can take on other forms, too. Although
one of my favorite ways to dress up a cake in a flash is to gather nonpoisonous
blooms and arrange them on a cake, other bouquets look great on cakes as
well. For example, with a handful of lollipop sticks (available at craft stores)
and a little time, you can turn cookies, candies, chocolates, and even photos
into a lovely grouping to top your cake. If you like baking cookies, insert sticks
into your parceled-out cookie batter before you bake them. With candy molds,
you can make quick work with melted chocolate chips to create 3-D chocolates
mounted on a stick. For the photos, use double-stick tape on the backs of a
pair of them. Press the lollipop stick onto the back of one, and then press the
other photo’s back on the other side.

Ten (or So) Troubleshooting
Techniques
In This Chapter
 Planning ahead to prevent problems
 Saving the (cake) day when disaster looms
W
hen you take your cake out of the oven, you may be faced with an array
of dilemmas. Or when you start to decorate, you may encounter a
plethora of problems.
Even in the throes of a cake crisis, remember that you’ll learn from the mistake.
I realize that’s not much consolation when your cake’s supposed to be at a
major event and you don’t have time to make another one, but the real tragedy
would be repeating the mistake with future cakes.
The suggestions in this chapter are intended to help you either avoid or work
around cake-related problems. If you take heed of these handy guidelines, you’ll
be forearmed to prevent many mistakes from happening. Still, because the
occasional snafu is bound to occur, you also get some hints and tips for after-
the-fall to bring your decorated cake up-to-snuff.
Ruthlessly Organize
The best way to ward off any problems is to be organized. Before you begin
mixing to bake or frost, read through all your recipes thoroughly. Then create
a game plan for decorating. Often, cake decorators bake the cake the day before
so that the layers firm up overnight in the refrigerator and so that they have
the whole next day to focus on decorating. Consider taking that approach,
and even think about making a to-do list that you check off as you proceed
with baking, frosting, filling, and decorating. The list can include cues to keep

track of time, such as turning the oven light on to periodically check on the
cake as it bakes and checking for doneness 5 to 10 minutes before the timer
goes off.
Beware Melting Cakes
If you’re planning on serving your cake outdoors, be mindful that buttercream
doesn’t hold up well in warm temperatures (such as hotter than 78 degrees),
so fondant is a better choice. If it’s hot outdoors and you’re bringing in a 
buttercream-covered cake, hold off on showing off the cake until it’s time to
slice and serve. If it’s a hot month but the cake event is being held inside,
make sure that the celebration place is cool (and that no one’s waiting until
everyone arrives to turn on the air conditioning) before you bring in the cake
and set up its presentation.
Know Where the Cake Will “Land”
If you’re planning to bake and decorate a large sheet cake or one that’s tiered
or constructed, make sure that you know where that cake will be refrigerated
for its crumb coat and where it will be served. Don’t leave your decorated
cake’s transport or final home to chance; that’s just inviting disaster. If neces-
sary, get out a ruler or measuring tape to make sure that the final product will
fit on the cake board, cardboard circles, or whatever else you may be lining
up for both decorating on and serving from.
Consider the Great Cover-Up
Some days your cake layers may just turn so lopsided that leveling them
could turn a once-high cake into a too-short version of itself. Or you may 
try all the tips and tricks possible for a smooth frosting finish but still be
left with a lumpy or streaked exterior. Your best bet in these circumstances
is to divert the eye. For instance, if you’re planning on sparse decorations
that expose much of your base cake, enhance your design with more embell-
ishments, such as frosting garlands, vines, and flowers or candies such as jelly
beans or dragees that fit in with your overall scheme. If your cake’s surface is
a message, pipe a wide band of stars or rosettes around it.
I’m not suggesting that you go on a decorating binge or start piping willy-nilly.
Instead, when you’re looking at a cake that just isn’t up to your standards, turn
to your original drawing and explore ways to best fill in your design such that
the lumps, bumps, and slants underneath aren’t so noticeable.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens

Handle Sticky Cake Pans with Care
If you try to remove your cake from the pan and it just won’t budge, don’t
knock the pan on the counter or try prying the cake out by hand. Instead,
return the cake to the oven for a few minutes to let the pan heat up again.
Run a clean dishtowel under cool water (or dip it into a bowl of icy water),
and spread it out on the countertop. Remove the hot pan from the oven and
place it (right side up) on top of the wet dishtowel. The coolness from the
dishtowel may help loosen the cake’s hold on the bottom of the pan.
Serve Off-Site
If your cake just doesn’t turn out as you’d hoped, salvage what you can and
redirect your decorating efforts so that cake eaters concentrate on their own
individual pieces rather than the overall cake. To do so, decorate what you
can, but keep in mind that no one but you will see the whole cake. Then, away
from everyone, slice and serve the cake on individual plates instead of present-
ing it as an entire creation. You can garnish the plates with melted chocolate,
raspberry coulis, cut fruit, or piped frosting.
Prevent a Fondant Faux Pas
Because fondant dries out quickly, make sure to keep what you’re not working
with well-wrapped or tightly covered. If the fondant tears when you place it
on the cake, you have two options: Smooth more nice, pliable fondant on it to
fill in the ripped holes, or put a little bit of shortening on your fingertips and
roll your fingers over the tear.
Many people think that a little water can fix any fondant problem, but that’s
far from the truth. Fondant is made mostly of sugar, so it will dissolve if you
use water to smooth over cracks or tears.
Don’t Skip the Crumb Coat
For the most professional results, always crumb coat your cake after it’s baked
and cooled. Without a thin layer of frosting to start, you’re sure to end up with
flecks of crumbs in your frosting, resulting in an unattractive and unprofessional
appearance. So don’t skimp on this step! And remember, as long as you cover
the cake completely, the crumb coat doesn’t have to be pretty — that’s what
the second coat of frosting is for. With a crumb coat underneath, the final
343
Chapter 24: Ten (or So) Troubleshooting Techniques

coat of frosting will be much easier to tame for smoothing and decorating . . .
and much sweeter to look at.
Take Care to Prevent Cracks
Usually a cake starts to crack when it’s being transported, like from a cardboard
round to its presentation tray or board, and disaster can ensue when those
cracks become deep fissures. When transporting a cake, take care to support
its center, not its sides. Holding the edges of any shape of cake causes the
center of the cake to dip down or bow up from cracks.
Shore Up Runny Frosting
If you mix up frosting that’s far too runny to coat your cake properly, don’t
just keep mixing in more confectioners’ sugar, hoping that it will start to
thicken up. Instead, divide the frosting in half (or thirds or fourths, depend-
ing on how much frosting you have and how runny it is). When the volume
is more manageable, you have a greater chance at correcting the consistency.
Add confectioners’ sugar gradually to one batch, taking note of how much
you mix in at a time so that you can do the same with the other batches.
Offer Cake Sundaes
Everyone loves cake, so even if you have a disastrous-looking baking effort
on your hands, you don’t have to trash it. As long as the cake tastes good,
you can serve up cake sundaes.
To make cake sundaes, chop up the cake as neatly and evenly as possible,
and make it the starring foundation for an ice cream sundae bar complete
with ice creams, toppings, and whipped cream. And, of course, make sure
that frosting is one of the sundae bar offerings! In fact, if you were planning
to decorate the cake with tinted frostings, set those out in individual pastry
bags with decorative tips and let the guests have their way with them. The
cake experience may not be what you had in mind, but it will be memorable!
