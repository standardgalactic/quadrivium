Preface to the 
Fifth Edition
Pocket Book of Integrals and Mathematical Formulas, 
Fifth Edition, a revision of a very successful pocket 
book, provides a handy reference source for stu­
dents, engineers, scientists, and others seeking 
essential mathematical formulas, concepts, and 
definitions. Topics range from precalculus to vec­
tor analysis and from Fourier series to statistics. 
The previous editions added material on busi­
ness and financial mathematics that has been 
well received since it provided information on 
progressions, especially geometric progressions, 
which form the basis for many formulas related 
to annuities, growth of funds, and interest pay­
ments. That material has been retained. The 
fourth edition also retained topics in statistics, 
nonlinear regression, and an expanded discus­
sion in the differential equations section by add­
ing a treatment of Runge Kutta methods and a 
new application to drug kinetics. This edition 
includes several classic calculus applications. 
These gems of calculus illustrate its power and 
practical use. Readers of the previous editions 
have enjoyed special topics that included the 
derivation leading to the geostationary satellite 
orbit, a timely topic, as well as an interesting set 

xiv
Preface to the Fifth Edition
of topics in number theory whose inclusion was 
motivated by the recent proof of Fermat’s last 
theorem. An interesting Fermat offshoot, namely, 
“near misses,” is included, thereby extending the 
range of interest of this popular book. The table of 
integrals, which contains the most useful forms, 
has been reformatted and has been rechecked for 
accuracy. Although we strive to keep the book 
size small, we have enlarged the type slightly 
without sacrificing special topics. These include 
Fourier series, Laplace and Z-transforms, vector 
analysis, complex numbers, orthogonal polyno­
mials and infinite series. Many other handbooks 
go too far in their attempts, essentially trying to 
mimic larger comprehensive texts. The result is 
a reference less detailed than the full texts and 
too big to be conveniently portable so that users 
would not carry them. Through a careful selec­
tion of topics and detail, Pocket Book of Integrals 
and Mathematical Formulas truly meets the needs 
of students and professionals in being a conve­
nient, compact, and usable resource that also 
provides worked examples where most neces­
sary. The book is portable, comprehensive, and 
easy to use.

Preface to the 
Fourth Edition
As in the previous works, this new edition pre­
serves the content, size, and convenience of this 
portable reference source for students and work­
ers who use mathematics, while introducing 
much new material. New in this fourth edition is 
an expanded chapter on series that now includes 
many fascinating properties of the natural num­
bers that follow from number theory, a field that 
has attracted much new interest since the recent 
proof of Fermat’s last theorem. While the proofs 
of many of these theorems are deep, and in some 
cases still lacking, all the number theory topics 
included here are easy to describe and form a 
bridge between arithmetic and higher math­
ematics. The fourth edition also includes new 
applications such as the geostationary satellite 
orbit, drug kinetics (as an application of differen­
tial equations), and an expanded statistics section 
that now discusses the normal approximation of 
the binomial distribution as well as a treatment 
of nonlinear regression. The widespread use of 
computers now makes the latter topic amenable 
to all students, and thus all users of the Pocket 
Book of Integrals can benefit from the concise 
summary of this topic. The chapter on financial 

xvi
Preface to the Fourth Edition
mathematics, introduced in the third edition, has 
proved successful and is retained without change 
in this edition, whereas the Table of Integrals has 
been reformatted for easier usage. This change 
in format also allowed the inclusion of all the 
new topics without the necessity of increasing 
the physical size of the book, thereby keeping its 
wide appeal as a true, handy pocket book that 
students and professionals will find useful in 
their mathematical pursuits.

xvii
Preface to the 
Third Edition
This new edition has been enlarged to contain all 
the material in the second edition, an expanded 
chapter on statistics that now includes sample 
size estimations for means and proportions, and 
a totally new chapter on financial mathemat­
ics. In adding this new chapter we have also 
included a number of tables that aid in perform­
ing the calculations on annuities, true interest, 
amortization schedules, compound interest, sys­
tematic withdrawals from interest accounts, etc. 
The treatment and style of this material reflect 
the rest of the book, i.e., clear explanations of 
concepts, relevant formulas, and worked exam­
ples. The new financial material includes analy­
ses not readily found in other sources, such as 
the effect of lump sum payments on amortiza­
tion schedules and a novel “in-out formula” that 
calculates current regular deposits to savings in 
order to allow the start of systematic withdraw­
als of a specified amount at a later date. While 

xviii
Preface to the Third Edition
many engineers, mathematicians, and scientists 
have found much use for this handy pocket book, 
this new edition extends its usage to them and to 
the many business persons and individuals who 
make financial calculations.

Preface to the 
Second Edition
This second edition has been enlarged by the 
addition of several new topics while preserving 
its convenient pocket size. New in this edition 
are the following topics: z-transforms, orthogo­
nal polynomials, Bessel functions, probability 
and Bayes’ rule, a summary of the most common 
probability distributions (binomial, Poisson, 
normal, t, Chi square, and F), the error function, 
and several topics in multivariable calculus that 
include surface area and volume, the ideal gas 
laws, and a table of centroids of common plane 
shapes. A list of physical constants has also been 
added to this edition.
I am grateful for many valuable suggestions 
from users of the first edition, especially Lt. Col. 
W. E. Skeith and his colleagues at the U.S. Air 
Force Academy.

xxi
Preface to the 
First Edition
The material of this book has been compiled so 
that it may serve the needs of students and teach­
ers as well as professional workers who use math­
ematics. The contents and size make it especially 
convenient and portable. The widespread avail­
ability and low price of scientific calculators have 
greatly reduced the need for many numerical 
tables (e.g., logarithms, trigonometric functions, 
powers, etc.) that make most handbooks bulky. 
However, most calculators do not give inte­
grals, derivatives, series, and other mathemati­
cal formulas and figures that are often needed. 
Accordingly, this book contains that information 
in addition to a comprehensive table of integrals. 
A section on statistics and the accompanying 
tables, also not readily provided by calculators, 
have also been included.
The size of the book is comparable to that of 
many calculators, and it is really very much a 
companion to the calculator and the computer 
as a source of information for writing one’s own 
programs. To facilitate such use, the author and 
the publisher have worked together to make the 
format attractive and clear. Yet, an important 
requirement in a book of this kind is accuracy. 

xxii
Preface to the First Edition
Toward that end we have checked each item 
against at least two independent sources.
Students and professionals alike will find this 
book a valuable supplement to standard text­
books, a source for review, and a handy reference 
for many years.

1.10  Complex Numbers
A complex number is an ordered pair of real 
numbers (a, b).
Equality: (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d
Addition: (a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)
Multiplication: (a, b)(c, d) = (ac − bd, ad + bc)
The first element of (a, b) is called the real part; the 
second, the imaginary part. An alternate notation 
for (a, b) is a + bi, where i2 = (−1, 0), and i(0, 1) or 
0 + 1i is written for this complex number as a con­
venience. With this understanding, i behaves as a 
number, i.e., (2 − 3i)(4 + i) = 8 − 12i + 2i − 3i2 = 11 − 10i. 
The conjugate of a + bi is a − bi, and the product 
of a complex number and its conjugate is a2 + b2.

integer or an odd integer, respectively. Inversions 
are counted relative to each integer j in the per­
mutation by counting the number of integers that 
follow j and are less than j. These are summed to 
give the total number of inversions. For example, 
the permutation 4132 has four inversions: three 
relative to 4 and one relative to 3. This permuta­
tion is therefore even.

2.2  Evaluation by Cofactors
Each element aij has a determinant of order (n − 1) 
called a minor (Mij) obtained by suppressing all ele­
ments in row i and column j. For example, the minor 
of element a22 in the 3 × 3 determinant above is

as ±Mij, where the sign is determined from i and j:
	
A

ij

+
(

.

The value of the n × n determinant equals the 
sum of products of elements of any row (or col­
umn) and their respective cofactors. Thus, for the

number is row i and column j. The order of the 
matrix is m × n (“m by n”). When m = n, the matrix 
is square and is said to be of order n. For a square 
matrix of order n the elements a11, a22, … , ann con­
stitute the main diagonal.
2.5  Operations
Addition: Matrices A and B of the same order 
may be added by adding corresponding ele­
ments, i.e., A + B = [(aij + bij)].
Scalar multiplication: If A = [aij] and c is a con­
stant (scalar), then cA = [caij], that is, every ele­
ment of A is multiplied by c. In particular, (−1)
A = −A = [−aij] and A + (−A) = 0, a matrix with all 
elements equal to zero.
Multiplication of matrices: Matrices A and B 
may be multiplied only when they are conform­
able, which means that the number of columns 
of A equals the number of rows of B. Thus, if A 
is m × k and B is k × n, then the product C = AB 
exists as an m × n matrix with elements cij equal 
to the sum of products of elements in row i of 
A and corresponding elements of column j of B:

When a scalar matrix multiplies a conformable 
second matrix A, the product is aA, that is, the 
same as multiplying A by a scalar a. A scalar 
matrix with diagonal elements 1 is called the 
identity, or unit matrix, and is denoted I. Thus, 
for any nth-order matrix A, the identity matrix of 
order n has the property

Given a square matrix A of order n, if there 
exists a matrix B such that AB = BA = I, then B 
is called the inverse of A. The inverse is denoted 
A−1. A necessary and sufficient condition that 
the square matrix A have an inverse is det A ≠ 0. 

25
Determinants, Matrices, and Linear Equations
Such a matrix is called nonsingular; its inverse is 
unique and is given by
	
A
adj A
A
−=
1
det
Thus, to form the inverse of the nonsingular 
matrix, A, form the adjoint of A and divide each 
element of the adjoint by det A. For example,

Analytic Geometry
4.1  Rectangular Coordinates
The points in a plane may be placed in one-to-
one correspondence with pairs of real numbers. 
A common method is to use perpendicular lines 
that are horizontal and vertical and intersect at a 
point called the origin. These two lines constitute 
the coordinate axes; the horizontal line is the 
x-axis and the vertical line is the y-axis. The posi­
tive direction of the x-axis is to the right, whereas 
the positive direction of the y-axis is up. If P is a 
point in the plane, one may draw lines through it 
that are perpendicular to the x- and y-axes (such 
as the broken lines of Figure  4.1). The lines 
intersect the x-axis at a point with coordinate 
x1 and the y-axis at a point with ­coordinate y1. 
We call x1 the x-coordinate, or abscissa, and y1 is 
termed the y-coordinate, or ordinate, of the point P. 

38
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
Thus, point P is associated with the pair of real 
numbers (x1, y1) and is denoted P(x1, y1). The 
coordinate axes divide the plane into quadrants 
I, II, III, and IV.

4.6  Parabola
A parabola is the set of all points (x, y) in the plane 
that are equidistant from a given line called the 
directrix and a given point called the focus. The 
parabola is symmetric about a line that contains 
the focus and is perpendicular to the directrix. 
The line of symmetry intersects the parabola at 
its vertex (Figure 4.4). The eccentricity e = 1.
The distance between the focus and the ver­
tex, or vertex and directrix, is denoted by p (> 0)

4.7  Ellipse
An ellipse is the set of all points in the plane such 
that the sum of their distances from two fixed 
points, called foci, is a given constant 2a. The dis­
tance between the foci is denoted 2c; the length 
of the major axis is 2a, whereas the length of the 
minor axis is 2b (Figure 4.8), and

The eccentricity of an ellipse, e, is <1. An ellipse 
with center at point (h, k) and major axis parallel 
to the x-axis (Figure 4.9) is given by the equation

4.9  Change of Axes
A change in the position of the coordinate axes 
will generally change the coordinates of the 
points in the plane. The equation of a particular 
curve will also generally change.

4.13  Exponential Function (Half-Life)
The function given by y = ex is the well-known 
exponential function (e = base of natural loga­
rithms; see Figures 4.24 and 4.25). In many 
applications, e.g., radioactive decay, pharmaco­
kinetics, growth models, etc., one encounters 
this function with time (t) as the independent 
variable, i.e., y = Aekt, for constants A and k. For 
positive k, the function increases and doubles 
in time ln(2)/k. When k is negative, the function 
decreases and is often characterized by the half-
life, which is the time to decrease to A/2. Half-life 
is therefore –ln(2)/k.

The integral cannot be represented in terms of a

There is a close relation between this function 
and the area under the standard normal curve 
(Table A.1). For evaluation, it is convenient to 
use z instead of x; then erf z may be evaluated 
from the area F(z) given in Table A.1 by use of the 
relation

5.4  Fermat’s Little Theorem
This theorem provides a condition that a prime 
number must satisfy.
Theorem
If p is a prime, then for any integer a, (aP − a) is 
divisible by p.
Examples
28 − 2 = 254 is not divisible by 8; thus, 8 cannot 
be prime.
37 − 3 = 2184 is divisible by 7, because 7 is prime.
5.5  Fermat’s Last Theorem
If n is an integer greater than 2, then an + bn = cn 
has no solutions in nonzero integers a, b, and c. For 
example, there are no integers a, b, and c such 
that a3 + b3 = c3. This author has generated “near

misses,” i.e., a3 + b3 = c3 ± 1, as shown below, and 
shown further that if (a + b) is odd, c is even, 
whereas if (a + b) is even, then c is odd.

5.7  An Interesting Prime

obtained by deleting the right-most digit; each of 
the following is a prime number:
7393913, 739391, 73939, 7393, 739, 73, 7
5.8  Goldbach Conjecture
Every even number greater than or equal to 4 can 
be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
Examples
6 = 3 + 3
12 = 5 + 7
18 = 5 + 13
20 = 3 + 17 = 7 + 13
5.9  Twin Primes
Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2, 
e.g., {3, 5}, {5, 7}, {11, 13}, {17, 19}, {29, 31}, …, {137, 139}, 
etc. It is believed, but not proved, that there are 
infinitely many twin primes.

5.10  Collatz Conjecture
Consider a sequence that begins with any posi­
tive integer and applies the following rule for 
successive terms: if it is odd, multiply by 3 
and add 1; if it is even, divide it by 2. All such 
sequences terminate with 4, 2, 1. (This conjecture 
is still unproven.)
Example
Start with 23 to give 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 
20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

6.2  Slope of a Curve
The tangent line at a point P(x, y) of the curve y = 
f(x) has a slope f′(x) provided that f′(x) exists at P.

line at P. The tangent line at P(x1, y1) is given by

6.5  Relative Maxima and Minima
The function f has a relative maximum at x = a if 
f(a) ≥ f(a + c) for all values of c (positive or negative) 
that are sufficiently near zero. The function f has 
a relative minimum at x = b if f(b) ≤ f(b + c) for all 
values of c that are sufficiently close to zero. If the 
function f is defined on the closed interval x1 ≤ x ≤ x2, 
and has a relative maximum or minimum at x = a, 
where x1 < a < x2, and if the derivative f′(x) exists 
at x = a, then f′(a) = 0. It is noteworthy that a rela­
tive maximum or minimum may occur at a point 

82
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
where the derivative does not exist. Further, the 
derivative may vanish at a point that is neither a 
maximum nor a minimum for the function. Values 
of x for which f′(x) = 0 are called critical values. To 
determine whether a critical value of x, say, xc, is a 
relative maximum or minimum for the function at 
xc, one may use the second derivative test:
	
1.	If f″(xc) is positive, f(xc) is a minimum.
	
2.	If f″(xc) is negative, f(xc) is a maximum.
	
3.	If f″(xc) is zero, no conclusion may be 
made.
The sign of the derivatives as x advances through 
xc may also be used as a test. If f′(x) changes from 
positive to zero to negative, then a maximum 
occurs at xc, whereas a change in f′(x) from nega­
tive to zero to positive indicates a minimum. If f′(x) 
does not change sign as x advances through xc, then 
the point is neither a maximum nor a minimum.
6.6  Points of Inflection of a Curve
The sign of the second derivative of f indicates 
whether the graph of y = f(x) is concave upward 
or concave downward:

A point of the curve at which the direction of 
concavity changes is called a point of inflection 

83
Differential Calculus
(Figure 6.1). Such a point may occur where f″(x) = 0 
or where f″(x) becomes infinite. More precisely, if 
the function y = f(x) and its first derivative y′ = 
f′(x) are continuous in the interval a ≤ x ≤ b, and if 
y″ = f″(x) exists in a < x < b, then the graph of y = 
f(x) for a < x < b is concave upward if f″(x) is posi­
tive and concave downward if f″(x) is negative.
6.7  Taylor’s Formula

that contains a and x, and if its first (n + 1) deriva­

6.10  Functions of Two Variables
For the function of two variables, denoted z = f(x, y), 
if y is held constant, say, at y = y1, then the result­
ing function is a function of x only. Similarly, x 
may be held constant at x1, to give the resulting 
function of y.
•	 The Gas Laws
A familiar example is afforded by the ideal 
gas law that relates the pressure p, the vol­
ume V, and the absolute temperature T of 
an ideal gas:
	
pV
nRT
=
where n is the number of moles and R is the 
gas constant per mole, 8.31 (J · °K−1⋅mole−1). 
By rearrangement, any one of the three vari­
ables may be expressed as a function of the 
other two. Further, either one of these two 
may be held constant. If T is held constant, 
then we get the form known as Boyle’s law:

where we have denoted nRT by the constant k 
and, of course, V > 0. If the pressure remains con­
stant, we have Charles’ law:

where the constant b denotes nR/p. Similarly, vol­

where now the constant, denoted a, is nR/V.
6.11  Partial Derivatives
The physical example afforded by the ideal gas 
law permits clear interpretations of processes 
in which one of the variables is held constant. 
More generally, we may consider a function z = 
f(x, y) defined over some region of the x-y-plane 
in which we hold one of the two coordinates, say, 
y, constant. If the resulting function of x is differ­
entiable at a point (x, y), we denote this derivative 
by one of the following notations:

6.12  Application of Derivatives
6.12.1  Related Rate Problems
Two time-varying quantities that are related will 
have rates of change that are also related. The 
chain rule (p. 235) is applied.
Example
Liquid enters a conical container at a constant 
rate of dV/dt = 2 cu ft/min. As the container fills, 
the rate of change of liquid height y varies with 
the height even though the volume input is con­
stant. Our aim is to obtain that rate of change of 
height. At all times, of course, the liquid radius 

90
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
x and height y are in the proportion of the cone’s 
dimensions, that is, y/x = h/r.
Right cone
r
l
h
r - Radius
x
y
h - Height
l - Slant height
If the cone’s dimensions are r = 5 ft and h = 
20 ft, then the liquid height y corresponds to liq­
uid radius x in such a way that y/x = h/r; thus x = 
ry/h. The volume of the cone’s content is therefore 
V = (1/3) × πx2y = (1/3) π (ry/h)2 y, or V = (1/3) πr2y3/h2. 
Since r2/h2 = 1/16, we have V = (1/48) πy3. The 
application of the chain rule yields dV/dt = (1/16) 
πy2 dy/dt, an expression that connects the rates 
dV/dt (= 2) and dy/dt for all times t > 0. For exam­
ple, at an instant at which y = 5 ft, we have
2 = (π/16) 52 dy/dt  so that dy/dt = 32/(25π) ft./min.
Example
A person standing on a wharf 24 feet above the 
water is pulling in a rope attached to a boat at the 
rate of 5 feet/second. How fast is the boat moving

6.12.2  Rectilinear Motion
Objects that move along a straight line may be 
described by an equation of motion. For example, 
if the movement is horizontal, an equation of the 
form x = f(t) would give the position (x) at any 
time t.
Example
x = ¼ t4 + t3 – 2t + 1. Velocity and acceleration follow 
from differentiation.
The velocity v = dx/dt = t3 + 3t2 – 2
and the acceleration a = dv/dt = 3t2 + 6t.
Substituting a specific value of t gives the 
velocity and acceleration values at that instant.
Example 
A particle undergoes oscillatory motion along a 
horizontal plane with position given by the equa­
tion x
A
wt
B 
wt
=

type of straight line motion called simple 
harmonic motion. It is oscillatory with period

The last expression shows that the acceleration is 
proportional to x, the displacement. This is a situ­
ation that can be viewed as a spring attached to 
the particle that is stretched and set in motion on 
a smooth surface. The force, and thus the accel­
eration, is proportional to the displacement x.

face of the earth attains a height y that is given 
by the time-varying equation y

Example
A rectangular plot of 1500 square feet is to be 
fenced on three sides as shown, and we wish to 
determine the dimensions that minimize the 
amount of fencing. This is a problem in which 
we are given a rectangular area and we seek the 
minimum of the perimeter. The area A = xy = 
1500 and the fence length P = 2x + y. Thus, P = 
2x + 1500/x, and this will be a minimum when 
dP/dx =  0. Therefore, dP/dx = 2 – 1500/x2 = 0, 
which gives x2 = 750 so that x = 750  = 5 30  
and y = 1500/x = 10 30 .

Example:  Falling Bodies
Bodies that fall in the earth’s gravitational field 
are subject to a constant acceleration (g ) and, if 
air resistance is negligible, the body gains veloc­
ity during the fall. If, however, there is apprecia­
ble air resistance, then the situation is different. 
Suppose that the air exerts a force proportional 
to the velocity, that is, a force = kv and opposite 
to the velocity vector. The equation governing 
the motion is then

Integral Calculus
Example:  Work 
The definite integral is used to calculate the work 
in situations in which the force or distance through 
which the force acts varies. An illustrative prob­
lem is that of a cylindrical tank, radius = 10 feet 
and height = 20 feet, that contains water. To calcu­
late the work in pumping this out, we consider a 
slab of thickness dy at height y. The density of water 
(62.4 lbs/ft3) is denoted here by w, and therefore the 
weight of this circular slab is wπ(10)2dy and, for a 
small dy, should be moved a vertical distance = 
(20 – y). Thus, the integral below is evaluated

Example:  Liquid Pressure
The pressure at any point of a resting liquid is 
the same and is proportional to the depth below 
the surface of the liquid. If ω is the weight den­
sity and h is the depth, then the pressure p = ω h.  
A flat surface submerged (as shown below) will 
experience a force F given by

where l  is the surface width (in this case 6) at 
depth h.  In the following diagram, a face rep­
resenting one end of a rectangular tank is 6 ft 
wide, 4 feet deep, and is submerged one foot 
below the water surface.  Thus, the integration 
limits are 1 to 5.

If the liquid is water, then ω = 62.5 pounds per

Such a trigonometric series is called the Fourier 
series corresponding to f(t), and the coefficients 
are termed Fourier coefficients of f(t). If the func­
tion is piecewise continuous in the interval 

137
Special Functions
−≤
≤
π
π
t
, and has left- and right-hand deriva­
tives at each point in that interval, then the series 
is convergent with sum f(t) except at points ti at 
which f(t) is discontinuous. At such points of dis­
continuity, the sum of the series is the arithmetic 
mean of the right- and left-hand limits of f(t) at ti. 
The integrals in the formulas for the Fourier coef­
ficients can have limits of integration that span a 
length of 2π, for example, 0 to 2π (because of the 
periodicity of the integrands).

•	 Application of Linear-Order 1 Differential 
Equations: Drug Kinetics
A substance (e.g., a drug) placed in one 
compartment is eliminated from that 
compartment at a rate proportional to the 
quantity it contains, and this elimination 
moves it to a second compartment (such 
as blood) that originally does not contain 
the substance. The second compartment 
also eliminates the substance to an exter­
nal sink and does so at a rate proportional 
to the quantity it contains. If D denotes 
the initial amount in the first compart­
ment, and the elimination rate constants 
from each compartment are denoted k1 
and k2, respectively, then the quantities 
in compartment 1 (denoted X) and com­
partment 2 (denoted Y) at any time t are

10.3  Runge Kutta Method (of Order 4)
The solution of differential equations may be 
approximated by numerical methods as described 
here for the differential equation dy/dx = f(x, y), 
with y = y0 at x = x0. Step size h is chosen and the 
solution is approximated over the interval [x0, xn], 
where xn = nh. The approximation follows from 
the recursion formula
	
yn+1 = yn + (1/6) (K1 + 2K2 + 2K3 + K4)
where
K1 = hf(xn, yn)
K2 = hf(xn + h/2, yn + K1/2)
K3 = hf(xn + h/2, yn + K2/2)
K4 = hf(xn + h, yn + K3)

any normally distributed random variable X

The standard normal probability curve is

The total area under the standard normal curve

probability of X between a given X1 and X2 is the 
area under the standard normal curve between 
the corresponding Z1 and Z2 (Table A.1).
•	 Normal Approximation to the Binomial 
Distribution
The standard normal curve is often used 
instead of the binomial distribution in 
experiments with discrete outcomes. For 
example, to determine the probability of 
obtaining 60 to 70 heads in a toss of 100 coins, 
we take X = 59.5 to X = 70.5 and compute 
corresponding values of Z from mean np =

 Thus, Z = (59.5 −

Table A.1, the area between Z = 0 and Z = 4.1 
is 0.5000, and between Z = 0 and Z = 1.9

is 0.4713; hence, the desired probability is 
0.0287. The binomial distribution requires a

Note that the normal curve is symmetric, 
whereas the histogram of the binomial dis­
tribution is symmetric only if p = q = 1/2. 
Accordingly, when p (hence q) differs appre­
ciably from 1/2, the difference between 
probabilities computed by each increases. 
It is ­usually recommended that the normal 
approximation not be used if p (or q) is so 
small that np (or nq) is less than 5.

is an approximation to the binomial probability 
for r successes in n trials when m = np is small 
(<5) and the normal curve is not recommended to 
approximate binomial probabilities (Table A.2). 
The variance σ2 in the Poisson distribution is np, 
the same value as the mean.

Example
A school’s expulsion rate is 5 students per 
1,000. If class size is 400, what is the probabil­
ity that 3 or more will be expelled? Since p = 
0.005 and n = 400, m = np = 2 and r = 3. From 
Table A.2 we obtain for m = 2 and r (= x) = 3 the 
probability p = 0.323.
11.14  Empirical Distributions
A distribution that is skewed to the right (posi­
tive skewness) has a median to the right of the 
mode and a mean to the right of the median. One 
that is negatively skewed has a median to the left 
of the mode and a mean to the left of the median.

Conclusions about a population parameter such

a way that the interval includes the unknown µ 
with ­probability (1 − α). A value Zα is obtained 
from the table for the normal distribution. For 
example, Zα = 1.96 for α = 0.05. Sample values

Two groups may have different sample means 
and it is desired to know if the apparent dif­

deviation in the items of the samples. The null 
hypothesis (H0) is that both samples belong to the 
same population, i.e., the differences are ran­
dom. The alternate hypothesis (H1) is that these 
are two different populations. Test procedures 
are designed so one may accept or reject the 
null hypothesis. The decision to accept is made 
with probability α of error. The value of α is usu­
ally 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001. If the null hypothesis is 
rejected, though correct, the error is called an 
error of the first kind. The error of acceptance of 
the null hypothesis, when false, is an error of the 
second kind.
11.17  t-Distribution
In many situations, µ and σ are unknown and 
must be estimated from X and s in a sample 
of small size n, so use of the normal distribu­
tion is not recommended. In such situations the 
Student’s t-distribution is used and is given by 
the probability density function

t- and Normal Distributions

of samples are taken, the distribution of the dif­

and sY are used as estimates of σX and σY, respec­
tively. The difference is significant if the value of 
Z indicates a small probability, say, <0.05 (or |Z| > 
1.96; Table A.1).
For small samples where the standard devia­
tion of the population is unknown and estimated

of the standard normal curve.

The computed t is compared to the tabular value 
(Table A.3) for degrees of freedom f = n1 + n2 − 2 at 
the appropriate confidence level (such as α = 0.05 
or 0.01). When the computed t exceeds in magni­
tude the value from the table, the null hypothesis is 
rejected and the difference is said to be significant. 
In cases that involve pairing of the variates, such as 
heart rate before and after exercise, the difference D 
= X − Y is analyzed. The mean (sample) difference D 
is computed and the null hypothesis is tested from

Since the tabular value at the 5% level for f = 2 
is 5.99, the result is significant for a relationship 
between gender and brand preference.
X2 is frequently used to determine whether 
a population satisfies a normal distribution. 
A large sample of the population is taken and 
divided into C classes, in each of which the 
observed frequency is noted and the expected 
frequency calculated. The latter­ is calculated 
from the assumption of a normal distribution. 
The class intervals should contain an expected 
frequency of 5 or more. Thus, for the interval

11.21  Nonlinear Regression Analysis
Given a data set (xi, yi), i = 1, …, N, it is desired to 
fit these to a nonlinear equation.
The basis of nonlinear curve fitting is as fol­
lows. A function Y of x contains, say, two param­
eters denoted here by α and β, that is, Y = f(x, α, β). 

177
Statistics
We seek here a representation in which α and β 
are estimated by a and b. These estimates are ini­
tially a0 and b0. A Taylor series representation is 
made about these initial estimates a0 and b0:

For this choice of a0 for α and b0 for β, each value 
xi gives the left-hand side of the above equation, 
Yi − f(a0, b0, zi), denoted here by ˆY. The partial 
derivative ∂
∂
f
a
/
 uses the a0 and b0 values and also 
has a value for each xi value, denoted here by X1i. 
Similarly, the partial derivative ∂
∂
f/ β has a value 
at this xi, which we denote by X2i. Thus, we get 
a set of values of a dependent variable ˆY = cX1 + 
dX2 that is ­linearly related to the independent 
variables X1 and X2. A multiple linear regression 
(described below) yields the two regression coef­
ficients c and d.
There are N data points (xi, yi). Using estimates 
(a0, b0) of parameters, the data are transformed 
into three different sets, denoted by ˆY, X1, and 
X2, defined as follows:
	
ˆ

where the partial derivatives are evaluated with 
a0, b0 at each xi value.

178
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
Thus, the original data set gives rise to three 
data ­columns of length N:
ˆY 
X1 
X2 
…
…
…
…
…
…
The values of ˆY, X1, and X2 in the table are entered 
into a linear multiple regression procedure to 
yield
	
ˆY = cX1 + dX2
The coefficients c and d are determined (with 
standard errors) from equations given below; 
these allow improved estimates of parameters 
a and b by taking a new set of estimates a1 = c + a0 
and b1 = d + b0.
The new set of estimates, a1 and b1, are then 
used to calculate ˆY, X1, and X2, and the process is 
repeated to yield new parameters, a2 and b2 (with 
standard errors). A stopping criterion is applied, 
e.g., if the difference between two iterates is less 
than some specified value. This last set is retained 
and the last set’s standard errors are retained as 
the standard errors of the final estimate.
•	 Multiple Regression (Equations)
In the discussion on nonlinear curve fitting 
above, we saw the need for iterative use of the 
two-parameter linear regression given by
	
ˆY

dX
=

2.

179
Statistics
At every step of the iterative process a set of X1, 
X2 and corresponding ˆY values is calculated, and 
at that step we wish to calculate the coefficients 
c and d. The procedure for doing this is a special 
case of the general multiple regression algorithm 
based on Y = b0 + b1 X1 + b2 X2 + … + bN XN, which 
estimates all the coefficients. In our application 
(two-parameter nonlinear analysis) there is no 
b0 term and N = 2. The data array is that shown 
above. Our model equation is given by

become sufficiently small. At that point in the 
process the standard errors are those given above 
at this last turn of the cycle.

12.1  Simple Interest
An item or service costs an amount C and is to be 
paid off over time in equal installment payments. 
The difference between the cost C and the total 
amount paid in installments is the interest I. The 
interest rate r is the amount of interest divided 
by the cost and the time of the loan T (usually 
expressed in years):
	
r = I/CT
Example
An item purchased and costing $4,000 is to be 
paid off in 18 equal monthly payments of $249.
The total amount paid is 18 × $249 = $4,482, so 
that I = $482. The time of the loan is 1.5 years; 
hence, the rate is r = 482/(4000 × 1.5) = 0.0803 or 
8.03%.

190
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
Note: While the above computation is correct, 
the computed rate, 8.03%, is misleading. This 
would be the true rate only if the $4,482 were 
repaid in one payment at the end of 18 months. 
But since you are reducing the unpaid ­balance 
with each payment, you are paying a rate higher 
than 8.03%. True interest rates are figured on the 
unpaid balance. The monthly payment based on 
the true rate is discussed below.
12.2  True Interest Formula 
(Loan Payments)
The interest rate is usually expressed per year; 
thus, the monthly rate r is 1/12th of the annual 
interest rate. The monthly payment P is computed 
from the amount borrowed, A, and the number of 
monthly payments, n, according to the formula

A mortgage of $80,000 (A) is to be paid over 
20 years (240 months) at a rate of 9% per year. 
The monthly payment is computed from the 
above formula with n = 240  months and r = 
0.09/12 = 0.0075 per month.
It is necessary to calculate (1 + 0.0075)240 for 
use in the formula. This is accomplished with 

191

the calculator key [yx]; that is, enter 1.0075, press

First compute (1 + 0.006667)60 (by entering

Table A.6 gives the monthly payment for each

Example
Use Table A.6 to get the monthly payment for 
the previous example.
Note that the table entry for 8% and 5 years is 
$20.28 per thousand. Since the loan is $20,000, 
you must multiply $20.28 by 20, which gives 
$405.60. (This differs by a few cents from the 
above due to rounding in the tables.)

12.3  Loan Payment Schedules
Once the monthly loan payment is determined, 
it usually remains constant throughout the dura­
tion of the loan. The amount that goes to inter­
est and principal changes with each payment as 
illustrated below.
Example
Show the payment schedule for a loan of 
$10,000 at the annual interest rate of 12%, which 
is to be paid in equal monthly payments over 
5 months.
The monthly payment P is computed using the 
monthly interest rate r = 0.12/12 = 0.01 and the 
formula in Section 12.2:

Thus, monthly payments are $2,060.40. The first 
month’s interest is 1% of $10,000, or $100. Since the 
monthly payment is constant, the following table

12.4  Loan Balance Calculation
The balance after some number of payments, 
illustrated in Section 12.3 above, may be calcu­
lated directly from a formula that is given below. 
In this calculation it is assumed that the monthly 
payments in amount P are made every month. 
The amount of these payments was determined 
from the original amount of the loan, denoted A, 
the number of months of the loan (e.g., 120 months 
for a 10-year loan), and the monthly interest rate 
r as given in Section 12.3. We now wish to deter­
mine what the balance is after a specific number 
of payments, denoted by k, have been made. The 
balance is given by

A 15-year loan of $100,000 at 7% annual interest

$899. This monthly payment was determined from 
the formula in Section 12.3. It is desired to know 
what the balance is after 5 years (60 payments).
The calculation requires the use of r at the 
monthly rate; thus, r = 0.07/12 = 0.0058333, and

12.5  Accelerated Loan Payment
The monthly payment P on a loan depends on 
the amount borrowed, A, the monthly interest 
rate, r, and the number of payments, n (the length 
of the loan). If the monthly payment is increased 
to a new amount, P′, then the number of monthly 
payments will be reduced to some lesser number, 
n′, which is calculated as follows:

Example
A mortgage of $50,000 for 30 years (360 months) 
at an annual rate of 8% requires monthly pay­
ments of $7.34 per thousand; thus, 50 thousand 
requires a monthly payment of 50 × $7.34 = $367 
(see Table A.6). If the ­borrower decides to pay 
more than the required monthly payment, say 
$450, how long would it take to pay off the loan?
The monthly interest rate is 0.08/12 and is 
used in the calculations of term 1 and term 2:

12.6  Lump Sum Payment
A way to reduce the length of a loan is to make 
a lump payment that immediately reduces the 
amount owed to some lower amount, which we 
denote by Bal. The original monthly payment 
remains at the amount P, which was previously 
determined from the original terms of the loan, 
but now the number of future payments M will 
be fewer because of the reduction in the amount 
owed. This number M is calculated from quanti­
ties X and Y, defined as follows:

was $77,400.43 and the monthly payment is 
$899.00 and scheduled to remain at that amount

12.7  Compound Interest
An amount of money (A) deposited in an interest-
bearing account will earn interest that is added 
to the deposited amount at specified time inter­
vals. Rates are usually quoted on an annual basis, 
as a percent. The interest is added at some fixed 
time interval or interest period such as a year, 
a month, or a day. The annual rate is divided by 
this interval for the purpose of calculation; e.g., 
if the annual rate is 9% and the interest period 
is 1 month, then the periodic rate r is 0.09/12 = 
0.0075; if the period is 3 months (quarter of a year), 
then r = 0.09/4 = 0.0225. After n time intervals 

198
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
(compounding periods) the money grows to an 
amount S given by
	
S = A(1 + r)n
where
A is the original amount
n is the number of interest periods
r is the rate per period
Example
$500 is deposited with an annual interest rate of 
10% compounded quarterly. What is the amount 
after 2 years?
A = $500
r = 0.10/4 = 0.025 (the periodic rate = 12-month 
rate/4)
n = 2/(1/4) = 8 (no. of interest periods)
and
	
S = 500 × (1.025)8
	
S = 500 × 1.2184 = $609.20
If this annual rate were compounded monthly, 
then r = 0.10/12 = 0.008333 and n = 2/(1/12) = 24, 
so that S becomes

•	 Effective Rate of Interest
When annual interest of, say, 8% is com­
pounded at an interval such as four times 

199
Financial Mathematics
per year (quarterly), the effective yield is 
calculated by using the annual rate divided 
by 4, thus 2% or 0.02, and the number of 
compounding periods, in this case 4. Thus,
	
(1.02)4 = 1.0824
and the effective annual rate is 0.0824, or 
8.24%. In contrast, 8% is the nominal rate. 
Table A.7 shows the growth of $1 for differ­
ent effective annual interest rates and num­
bers of years.
12.8  Time to Double (Your Money)

a Specified Amount
•	 Payments at the Beginning of the Year

annual interest rate is r. The payment P,

on a certain date and on that same date each 
year, so that after n years (and n payments) 
the desired amount S is available.

To make this schedule more clear, say that

so on for 10 payments, the last being made at 
the beginning of the 10th year. At the end of 
this 10th year (and no further payments) we 
have the amount S. The payment amounts P 
are computed from the above formula.
Example
It is desired to accumulate $20,000 for ­college 
expenses needed 10  years hence in a sav­
ings account that pays the constant rate of 6% 
annually.
	
S = 20000, r = 0.06, and n = 10.

In a common application the withdraw­

annual rate divided by 12 (with monthly 
compounding). In this application the 
­withdrawal is made at the end of the month. 
(Note: Balance decreases only if P > Ar.)

An account earning interest at 10% per year and 
compounded monthly contains $25,000, and 
monthly withdrawals of $300 are made at the 
end of each month. How much remains after 6 
withdrawals? After 12 withdrawals?
Since the rate is 10% and withdrawals are 
monthly, we use the rate r = 0.10/12 = 0.008333,

For an annual interest rate of 6%, withdrawals of

Note: If the withdrawals are monthly, then the

12.13  Periodic Withdrawals That 
Maintain the Principal
The amount of monthly withdrawals that will 
neither increase nor decrease the principal, called 
the critical amount, is given by
	
P = rA
where A is the principal and r is the interest rate.

so that $208.32 may be withdrawn monthly 
while maintaining the original $25,000.
Figure 12.2 shows the change in principal 
($20,000) following a number of withdrawals for 
several different monthly amounts in an account 
earning 12% per year and compounded monthly 
(r = 0.01). It is noteworthy that withdrawing less 
than $200 per month (critical amount) does not 
decrease, but actually increases the principal.
12.14  Time to Deplete an Interest-
Bearing Account with 
Periodic Withdrawals
If withdrawals at regular time intervals are in 
amounts greater than the critical amount (see 
Section 12.13), the balance decreases. The number

Example
An account with principal $10,000 is earning

withdrawals of $200 are made.
To determine the number of withdrawals to 
depletion we use the monthly interest rate, r = 
0.1/12 = 0.008333, with P = 200 and A = $10,000.

Suppose an amount A has accumulated in a sav­

The amount in savings is $100,000 and regular

Thus, P = 6000/(1 − 0.31180) = $8,718.40.
Payments of $8,718.40 per year at the end of 
each year for 20  years are possible from this

$100,000. Of course, if 10 times this, or $1,000,000, 
were on hand, then 10 times this, or $87,184 
would be paid for 20 years.

Suppose that there is $100,000 in an account earn­

Since the original amount is $100,000, this 
annual withdrawal amount is 13.799% of the 
original. It is convenient to have a table of the 
percent that may be withdrawn for a specified 
number of years at various interest rates, and 
this is given in Table A.11. 
Example
Find the percent of a portfolio that may be with­
drawn at the beginning of each year for 15 years 
if the annual average rate of interest is 12%.
From Table A.11, in the 12% column, the 
entry at 15 years is 13.109%. Thus, a portfolio of 
$100,000 allows annual withdrawals of $13,109.

12.17  Present Value of 
Regular Payments
Suppose you are to receive yearly payments of 
a certain amount over a number of years. This 
occurs, for example, when one wins a state lot­
tery. The current value of this stream of pay­
ments depends on the number of years (n), the 
interest rate (r) that money earns (assumed con­
stant), and the amount (P) of the yearly payment.

Example
Monthly payments of $500 are made into a 
retirement plan that has an average annual 
interest rate of 12% with monthly compounding. 
How much does this grow to in 25 years?
Because payments are made monthly, the rate 
r and the value of n must be based on monthly 
payments. Thus, the rate r is (0.12/12 = 0.01), and 
n = 25 × 12 = 300 months. Thus, the value of S is

12.19  The In-Out Formula
We wish to determine the amount of money 
(A) to be saved each month for a specified num­

$1,000 monthly for another specified time (N) 
may begin. It is assumed that the interest rate 
(r) remains constant throughout the saving and 
collecting periods and that compounding occurs 
monthly. Thus, the interest rate, r, is the annual 
interest rate divided by 12, and N and M are in 
months. The monthly amount, A, which must be 
saved is given by the formula

results of this calculation by reading down to

15 years and across to 10 years, as well as a num­
ber of different combinations of savings years 
and collection years. Tables A.14 to A.17 apply to 
annual interest rates of 4, 6, 8, and 10%. The use 
of these tables is illustrated in the next example.
Example
For an annual interest rate of 4%, how much 
should be saved monthly for 25 years in order 
to collect $1,000 monthly for the next 20 years?
From Table A.14, reading down to 25 years and 
across to 20 years, the table shows $320.97. Thus, 
$320.97 must be saved for each $1,000 monthly 
collected for 20 years. If, say, $3,000 per month is 
to be collected, we multiply $320.97 by 3 to give 
$962.91 as the amount to be saved each month 
for 25 years.
12.20  Stocks and Stock Quotations
The stocks of various corporations require famil­
iarity with the terms used and the underlying 
calculations. Besides the high, low, and closing price, 
and the change from the previous trading day, 
the stock quotations, as listed in newspapers, 
contain additional terms that are calculated.
Yield: The dividend or other cash distribution 
that is paid on the security and usually expressed 
as a percentage of the closing price. The dollar 

220
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
amount of the distribution divided by the clos­
ing price, when multiplied by 100, gives the yield. 
Thus, a dividend of $3.50 for a stock selling for 
$40.75 has a yield of

rounded
Price-earnings ratio (P/E): The closing price 
divided by the earnings per share (for the most 
recent four quarters); for example, if annual earn­
ings = $2.25 for the above stock, priced at $40.75, 
then P/E = 40.75/2.25 = 18.1.
Volume: The volume traded, usually on a daily basis, 
is quoted in units of 100. For example, a volume fig­
ure of 190 means 190 × 100 = 19,000 shares traded.
A listing might look as follows:

which means that this stock attained daily highs 
and lows of 42¼ and 40

at ½ above the previous day’s closing price of 40¼.
12.21  Bonds
Bonds are issued by many corporations (and 
govern­ments), usually with a par value or face 
value of $1,000, and mature at a specified time 

221
Financial Mathematics
that is part of the quotation information found 
in newspapers. The corporation (or government) 
thus promises to pay the face value of $1,000 
at maturity and also pays interest to the bond 
holder. The quotation also includes this annual 
interest expressed in percent. Although the 
face value of the bond may be $1,000, the price 
that purchases it is based on units of $100; for 
example, the quoted purchase price, such as $95, 
means that the bond costs 10 times this, or $950, 
whereas a purchase listing of $110 would mean 
that it costs $1,100. Thus, XYZ corporation bonds 
that pay interest at 8.5% and mature in 1998 
would be listed as
XYZ
8½
98
If the purchase price is $110, then the cost (with­
out commission) is 10 × $110 = $1,100 but pays 
interest of 8.5% of the face value of $1,000, or $85. 
This is the amount paid annually regardless of 
the purchase price. Thus, the effective yield is 
computed from this earned interest and the pur­
chase price:
	
100 × (85/1100) = 7.7%
The listing, as published in newspapers, might 
look as follows:
Bond
Current Yield
Close
Net Change
XYZ 8½ 98
7.7
110
+½

222
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
The last column, “Net Change,” means that the 
closing price on the previous trading day was 109½. 
The quotation might also include the sales volume 
(usually in units of $1,000) as well as the high and 
low prices of the bond during the trading day.
•	 Bond Value
The value of a bond is determined from 
the number of years to maturity and the 
amount of the annual coupon payments 
paid each year until the bond matures. 
The face value (par value) of most bonds is 
$1,000.00. The current value uses the cur­
rent interest rate, e.g., 7%, to compute the 
current value of $1,000 at 7% for the num­
ber of years to maturity, such as 30. This is 
given by 1000/(1 + 0.07)30 = $131.37. This is 
the first part of the computation. The next 
part uses the amount of the coupon pay­
ment, e.g., $70 per year for 30 years. This is 
calculated from the product of $70 and the fac­
tor [1 − 1/(1.07)30]/0.07. This factor is 12.4090 
and when multiplied by $70 gives $868.63. 
This is the second part of the calculation. 
When these parts are added, $131.37  + 
$863.63, the sum is $1,000. Accordingly, this 
bond is presently worth $1,000, i.e., a bond 
with face value of $1,000 that pays $70 per 
year for 30 years should have a current sell­
ing price of $1,000 (assuming safety) based 
on the current interest rate of 7%.
The two parts of the calculation are based 
on the formulas below, in which r is the 

223

annual interest rate and N is the number of 
years:

The previously illustrated 30-year bond pays 
$70 per year, but the current interest rate is now 
only 6%. For this calculation we need (1.06)30, 
which is 5.7435. Thus, Z = $1,000/5.7435 and T = 
(70/0.06) × (1 − 1/5.7435) = $963.54. Adding the 
two parts, $174.11 + $963.54, gives $1,137.65. Note: 
The bond value has increased as a result of this 
interest drop.
12.22  Tax-Free Yield
Certain securities such as municipal bonds may 
be purchased tax-free. The relationship between 
the tax-free yield (F) and the tax-equivalent 
yield (T) depends on one’s tax rate (R) according 
to the formula
	
F = T(1 − R)

224
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
Example
If one is in the 28% tax bracket, i.e., R = 0.28, then 
the tax-free equivalent of a corporate bond pay­
ing 6.5% is
	
F = 0.065 × (1 − 0.28) = 0.0468, or 4.68%
(The tax rate is taken to be the total of the ­federal 
and effective state rates.)
12.23  Stock Options (Puts and Calls)
Various stock exchanges permit the purchase of 
stock options such as “puts” and “calls.” Each of 
these has an exercise price and an expiration date. 
The call option is the right to buy shares at the 
exercise price at any time on or before the expira­
tion date. The put option is the right to sell shares 
at the exercise price. Thus, if the stock of XYZ 
corporation is currently trading at 52½ ($52.50) 
and the exercise price is $50 with an expiration 
date 3 weeks hence, the call provides a guaran­
tee of $2.50 if sold now (less commissions). Thus, 
the call has a value of at least that amount and 
would sell for even more since the stock price 
might increase even further. The price of the call 
might thus be $3.25. In contrast, the put, if exer­
cised now, would lose $2.50, a negative value. But 
because the exercise date is still weeks away, the 

225
Financial Mathematics
put still has worth since the stock price could fall 
below $50 (the exercise price), giving the option 
some value, such as 38 (37½ cents). As the time of 
expiration gets nearer, this value would dwin­
dle to zero. The listing of these options (in early 
March 1997) would appear as follows:
XYZ 
C 
521⁄2 
Date
Strike
Call
Put
March 97
50
3¼
38
(C is a code for the exchange.)
If the expiration is a month later, April 1997, the 
call and put prices would be greater, say 4 and 
1 18, respectively, because of the time to expiration 
(the third Friday of the month).
12.24  Market Averages
The simple average of a set of n numbers, also 
called the arithmetic mean, is computed by sum­
ming the numbers and dividing by n. The clos­
ing prices of groups of stocks, such as the stocks 
of 30 large companies that comprise the well-
known Dow Jones Industrials, provide an average. 
Because corporations often split shares, thereby 
changing their price per share, and because some 
of the corporations on the list of 30 may change 

226
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
over time, the simple formula for getting these 
averages is modified. For example, in the sum­
mer of 1997 the total of the 30 prices was divided 
by 0.26908277 to get the average (or average 
change). For example, if each gained 1 point, the 
sum 30 divided by 0.26908277 is $111.49, a gain in 
the average. Thus, even over several years, with 
stock splits (and even some different corpora­
tions), a change in the average is a useful indica­
tor of performance.
Other popular averages such as Standard & 
Poor’s and the New York Stock Exchange are 
comprised of different groups of stocks in seg­
ments such as transportation, utilities, etc., as 
well as broad, composite averages. Each group 
has its own divisor.
12.25  Mutual and Quotations
Mutual funds are usually listed in newspapers 
with values of the net asset value (NAV) of a 
share, the buy price of a share, and the change 
in net asset value from the previous day’s clos­
ing price. The net asset value is computed as the 
total of securities and cash in the fund divided 
by the number of shares. When the buy price is 
greater than the NAV, the difference is known as 
the load or cost (commission) of buying the fund. 

227
Financial Mathematics
The percent as commission is computed as 100 × 
load/NAV.
Example
The XYZ fund is listed as follows:
Fund 
NAV 
Buy 
Change 
XYZ
18.40
19.52
−0.03
The load is 100 × (19.52 − 18.40)/(18.40) = 6.087%.
The listing also indicates that on the previous 
trading day the NAV was $18.43. If the fund is 
sold without a load, the symbol “NL” (no load) 
appears in the buy column. Total return may 
be computed from the difference between your 
cost (buy price) and the NAV when you sell and 
will also include dividend and distributions 
that the fund may pay.
Example
The fund above, which was purchased at $19.52 
per share, attains a net asset value of $22 eight 
months later. It also declares a dividend (D) of 
25 cents and a capital gain distribution (CG) of 
40 cents during that time. These are added to 
the difference between the net asset value and 
the buy price, and this quantity is divided by the 

228
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
buy price to give the proportional return (PR); 
percent return is 100 × PR:

.
Thus, the percent return is 16.03%. Because this 
was attained in only 8 months, it is equivalent to 
a 12-month return obtained by multiplying by 
128, or 1.5. Thus, the annual percent return is 1.5 × 
16.03%, or 24.04%.
12.26  Dollar Cost Averaging
The share price of a stock or mutual fund var­
ies so that regular investment of a fixed amount 
of money will buy more shares when the price is 
low and fewer shares when the price is high. The 
table below illustrates the results of investing $100 
each month for 9 months in a stock whose price 
is initially $15.00 and which fluctuates over the 
9-month period but returns to $15.00 per share. 
The same $100 divided by the share price gives 
the number of shares purchased each month. The 
total number of shares accumulated is 62.742 and 
has a price of $15 at the end of 9 months so that 
the total is worth $941.13. This is a gain of $41.13, 

229

even though the share price is the same at the 
beginning and end of the time period.

12.27  Moving Average
Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other instru­
ments whose prices change are sometimes plot­
ted along with their moving average over some 
specified time interval. For example, suppose the 
closing prices of a mutual fund for a sequence of 
days were as shown below:
14.00, 14.25, 14.35, 15.02, 14.76, 14.81, 14.92, 14.99, 
15.32, 15.45, 15.32, 15.05, …, 17.45

230
Integrals and Mathematical Formulas
Illustrated here is the 10-day moving average. 
The average of the first 10 prices is the sum (14.00 + 
14.25 + ⋯ + 15.45) divided by 10, which is 14.79. The 
next average is obtained from day 2 to day 11, that 
is, drop 14.00, which is day 1’s price, and average by 
summing to day 11 (14.25 + 14.35 + ⋯ + 15.32) and 
dividing by 10, which gives 14.92. These numbers, 
computed on days 10, 11, etc., are the 10-day mov­
ing average values. They are plotted, along with 
the daily prices, in the graph in Figure 12.3.
While the daily prices fluctuate considerably, 
the moving average has much lower fluctuation, 
as seen by the smoother curve. The usefulness 
of a ­moving average is that it indicates the main 
trend in prices. Whereas this example uses the 
10-day moving average, other time intervals 
may be used, such as 30-day, 200-day, etc. Some 
mutual funds use a 39-week moving average.
