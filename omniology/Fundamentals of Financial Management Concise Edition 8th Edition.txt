When the first edition of Fundamentals was published 36 years ago, we wanted to
provide an introductory text that students would find interesting and easy to
understand. Fundamentals immediately became the leading undergraduate finance
text, and it has maintained that position ever since. However, over the years as
Fundamentals got larger and larger, we heard more and more often that it was
difficult to cover the entire book in a single term. These concerns led us to create
Fundamentals of Financial Management Concise 18 years ago. When designing Con-
cise, we had in mind those instructors who wanted to retain Fundamentals’ depth
and level but eliminate some less essential topics. As is the case with Fundamentals,
our continuing goal is to produce a book and ancillary package that sets a new
standard for finance textbooks.
Finance is an exciting and continually changing field. Since the last edition,
many important changes have occurred within the global financial environment.
In the midst of this changing environment, it is certainly an interesting time to be a
finance student. In this latest edition, we highlight and analyze the events leading
to these changes from a financial perspective. While the financial environment is
ever-changing, the tried-and-true principles that the book has emphasized over
the past three decades are now more important than ever.
STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK
Our target audience is a student taking his or her first, and perhaps only, finance
course. Some of these students will decide to major in finance and go on to take
courses in investments, money and capital markets, and advanced corporate
finance. Others will choose marketing, management, or some other nonfinance
business major. Still others will major in areas other than business and take
finance plus a few other business courses to gain information that will help them
in law, real estate, or other fields.
Our challenge has been to provide a book that serves all of these audiences
well. We concluded that we should focus on the core principles of finance,
including the basic topics of time value of money, risk analysis, and valuation.
Moreover, we concluded that we should address these topics from two points of
view: (1) that of an investor who is seeking to make intelligent investment choices
and (2) that of a business manager trying to maximize the value of his or her firm’s
stock. Both investors and managers need to understand the same set of principles,
so the core topics are important to students regardless of what they choose to do
after they finish the course.
In planning the book’s structure, we first listed the core topics in finance that
are important to virtually everyone. Included were an overview of financial
markets, methods used to estimate the cash flows that determine asset values,
the time value of money, the determinants of interest rates, the basics of risk
analysis, and the basics of bond and stock valuation procedures. We cover these
core topics in the first nine chapters. Next, because most students in the course
will probably work for a business firm, we want to show them how the core ideas
are implemented in practice. Therefore, we go on to discuss cost of capital, capital
budgeting, capital structure, dividend policy, working capital management, finan-
cial forecasting, and international operations.
Nonfinance majors sometimes wonder why they need to learn finance. As we
structured the book, it quickly becomes obvious to everyone why they need to
understand time value, risk, markets, and valuation. Virtually all students
enrolled in the basic course expect at some point to have money to invest, and
they quickly realize that the knowledge gained from Chapters 1 through 9 will

help them make better investment decisions. Moreover, students who plan to go
into the business world soon realize that their own success requires that their firms
be successful, and the topics covered in Chapters 10 through 17 will be helpful
here. For example, good capital budgeting decisions require accurate forecasts
from people in sales, marketing, production, and human resources, and non-
financial people need to understand how their actions affect the firm’s profits
and future performance.
ORGANIZATION OF THE CHAPTERS: A VALUATION FOCUS
As we discuss in Chapter 1, in an enterprise system such as that of the United
States, the primary goal of financial management is to maximize their firms’
values. At the same time, we stress that managers should not do “whatever it
takes” to increase the firm’s stock price. Managers have a responsibility to behave
ethically, and when striving to maximize value, they must abide by constraints
such as not polluting the environment, not engaging in unfair labor practices, not
breaking the antitrust laws, and the like. In Chapter 1, we discuss the concept of
valuation, explain how it depends on future cash flows and risk, and show why
value maximization is good for society in general. This valuation theme runs
throughout the text.
Stock and bond values are determined in the financial markets, so an under-
standing of those markets is essential to anyone involved with finance. Therefore,
Chapter 2 covers the major types of financial markets, the rates of return that
investors have historically earned on different types of securities, and the risks
inherent in these securities. This information is important for anyone working in
finance, and it is also important for anyone who has or hopes to own any financial
assets. In this chapter, we also highlight how this environment has changed in the
aftermath of the financial crisis.
Asset values depend in a fundamental way on earnings and cash flows as
reported in the accounting statements. Therefore, we review those statements in
Chapter 3 and then, in Chapter 4, show how accounting data can be analyzed and
used to measure how well a company has operated in the past and how well it is
likely to perform in the future.
Chapter 5 covers the time value of money (TVM), perhaps the most funda-
mental concept in finance. The basic valuation model, which ties together cash
flows, risk, and interest rates, is based on TVM concepts, and these concepts are
used throughout the remainder of the book. Therefore, students should allocate
plenty of time to studying Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 deals with interest rates, a key determinant of asset values. We
discuss how interest rates are affected by risk, inflation, liquidity, the supply of
and demand for capital in the economy, and the actions of the Federal Reserve.
The discussion of interest rates leads directly to the topics of bonds in Chapter 7
and stocks in Chapters 8 and 9, where we show how these securities (and all other
financial assets) are valued using the basic TVM model.
The background material provided in Chapters 1 through 9 is essential to both
investors and corporate managers. These are “Finance” topics, not “Business” or
“Corporate Finance” topics as those terms are commonly used. Thus, Chapters 1
through 9 concentrate on the concepts and models used to establish values,
whereas Chapters 10 through 17 focus on specific actions managers can take to
maximize their firms’ values.
Because most business students don’t plan to specialize in finance, they might
think the “business finance” chapters are not particularly relevant to them. This is
most decidedly not true, and in the later chapters we show that all really impor-
tant business decisions involve every one of a firm’s departments—marketing,

accounting, production, and so on. Thus, while a topic such as capital budgeting
can be thought of as a financial issue, marketing people provide inputs on likely
unit sales and sales prices, manufacturing people provide inputs on costs, and so
on. Moreover, capital budgeting decisions influence the size of the firm, its
products, its profits, and its stock price, and those factors affect all of the firm’s
employees, from the CEO to the mail room staff.
INNOVATIONS FOR THE EIGHTH EDITION
A great deal has happened in the financial markets and corporate America since
the 7th edition was published. In this 8th edition, we have made several important
changes to reflect this dynamic environment. Below, we provide a brief summary
of the more significant changes.
1.
Today’s students are tomorrow’s business and government leaders, and it is
essential that they understand the key principles of finance, the important role
that financial markets have on our economy, and the need to behave in an
ethical fashion. With those concerns in mind, we changed the organization of
Chapter 1 to emphasize the firm’s main goal of creating value for shareholders
and expanded the discussion of agency conflicts. We also reiterate that
maximizing shareholder value does not mean “increase the stock price at all
cost,” and we discuss some recent events where companies have had to pay
the price for actions that harmed society.
2.
Since the last edition, a number of important events have significantly
influenced the financial markets and finance in general. Over the last few
years, we have witnessed continued weakness in the economy following the
global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the European debt crisis, the escalating
increase in the U.S. government’s debt, the resulting downgrading of U.S.
debt, U.S. budget woes, and sequestration. At the same time, the Federal
Reserve’s aggressive policy of quantitative easing has pushed interest rates to
the lowest levels in years, which is partially responsible for the dramatic run-
up in the U.S. stock market between August 2011 and August 2013.
Throughout the 8th edition, we discuss these events and their implications for
financial markets and corporate managers, and we use these examples to
illustrate the importance of the key concepts covered in Concise for investors,
businesses, and even government officials.
3.
Instructors and students continually impress upon us the importance of
having interesting and relevant real-world examples. Throughout the 8th
edition we have added several new examples where recent events help
illustrate the key concepts covered in the text. We have also expanded and
updated the many tables where we present real-world data, and we have
updated the Thomson One examples. Finally, as is always the case, we have
also made significant changes to many of the opening vignettes that precede
each chapter.
4.
Behavioral finance theory continues to have an important influence on the
academic literature and it has in many ways reshaped the way that many of
us think about financial markets and corporate finance. As a reflection of its
growing importance, in Chapter 2 we moved the discussion of behavioral
finance and its impact on the efficient markets hypothesis from a separate box
into its own section. In addition, we continue to highlight the importance of
securitization, the role of derivatives, and the increasing importance of hedge
funds, mutual funds, and private equity firms.
5.
We updated the tax discussion in Chapter 3 to reflect 2013 tax rates and tax
law changes. Impacts of these changes are discussed throughout the text
especially in the capital structure and dividend chapters.

6.
In Chapter 3, we also added a box about how excess cash holdings affect the
calculation of net operating working capital.
7.
In Chapter 4, we revised the definition of the debt ratio. We calculate it as
interest-bearing debt divided by the sum of interest-bearing debt and equity.
This revision is more consistent with our discussions in the capital budgeting,
capital structure, and forecasting chapters.
8.
We have added more “Quick Questions” that are designed to keep students
actively involved and focused as they read the text. Here, in a separate box,
we pose a question and then show students how to answer it. These “Quick
Questions” go through examples to make the finance concepts more concrete,
and in that sense they mimic what effective instructors often do in a classroom
setting. Additional “Quick Questions” have been included in Chapters 3, 4, 6,
8, 13, and 17.
9.
In Chapter 13, we changed the Bigbee illustration (that works through the
calculations to determine the optimal capital structure) to reflect lower interest
rates.
When revising the text, we always rely heavily on a team of reviewers who offer
suggestions for making the text more readable and relevant to students. We give
special thanks to these reviewers later in the preface; their comments and recom-
mendations certainly helped us improve this 8th edition.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The book reflects the efforts of a great many people, both those who worked on
Concise and our related books in the past and those who worked specifically on
this 8th edition. First, we would like to thank Dana Aberwald Clark, who worked
closely with us at every stage of the revision—her assistance was absolutely
invaluable. Second, Susan Whitman provided great typing and logistical support.
Our colleagues John Banko, Roy Crum, Jim Keys, Andy Naranjo, M. Nima-
lendran, Jay Ritter, Mike Ryngaert, Craig Tapley, and Carolyn Takeda Brown
have given us many useful suggestions over the years regarding the ancillaries
and many parts of the book, including the integrated cases. We also benefited
from the work of Mike Ehrhardt and Phillip Daves of the University of Tennessee,
who worked with us on companion books.
We would also like to thank the following professors, whose reviews and

ERRORS IN THE TEXTBOOK
At this point, most authors make a statement such as this: “We appreciate all the
help we received from the people listed above; but any remaining errors are, of
course, our own responsibility.” And generally there are more than enough
remaining errors! Having experienced difficulties with errors ourselves, both as
students and instructors, we resolved to avoid this problem in Concise. As a result
of our detection procedures, we are convinced that few errors remain, but pri-
marily because we want to detect any errors that may have slipped by so that we
can correct them in subsequent printings, we decided to offer a reward of $10 per
error to the first person who reports it to us. For purpose of this reward, errors
are defined as misspelled words, nonrounding numerical errors, incorrect state-
ments, and any other error that inhibits comprehension. Typesetting problems
such as irregular spacing and differences of opinion regarding grammatical or
punctuation conventions do not qualify for this reward. Given the ever-changing
nature of the World Wide Web, changes in web addresses also do not qualify as
errors, although we would like to learn about them. Finally, any qualifying error
that has follow-through effects is counted as two errors only. Please report any
errors to Joel Houston through e-mail at concise@joelhouston.com or by regular
mail at the address below.
CONCLUSION
Finance is, in a real sense, the cornerstone of the enterprise system—good financial
management is vitally important to the economic health of all firms and hence to
the nation and the world. Because of its importance, finance should be widely and
thoroughly understood, but this is easier said than done. The field is complex, and
it undergoes constant change due to shifts in economic conditions. All of this
makes finance stimulating and exciting, but challenging and sometimes perplex-
ing. We sincerely hope that this 8th Edition of Concise will meet its own challenge
by contributing to a better understanding of our financial system.

Striking the Right Balance
In 1776, Adam Smith described how an “invisible
hand” guides companies as they strive for profits,
and that hand leads them to decisions that benefit
society. Smith’s insights led him to conclude that
profit maximization is the right goal for a business
and that the free enterprise system is best for
society. But the world has changed since 1776.
Firms today are much larger, they operate globally,
they have thousands of employees, and they are
owned by millions of stockholders. This makes us
wonder if the “invisible hand” still provides reliable
guidance: Should companies still try to maximize
profits, or should they take a broader view and
more balanced actions designed to benefit custo-
mers, employees, suppliers, and society as a whole?
Many academics and finance professionals
today subscribe to the following modified ver-
sion of Adam Smith’s theory:
• A firm’s principal goal should be to maximize
the wealth of its stockholders, which means
maximizing the value of its stock.
• Free enterprise is still the best economic
system for society as a whole. Under the free
enterprise
framework,
companies
develop
products and services that people want and
that benefit society.
• However, some constraints are needed—firms
should not be allowed to pollute the air and
water,
to
engage
in
unfair
employment
practices,
or
to
create
monopolies
that
exploit consumers.
These constraints take a number of different
forms. The first set of constraints is the costs that
are assessed on companies if they take actions
that harm society. Another set of constraints arises
through the political process, where society
imposes a wide range of regulations that are
designed to keep companies from engaging in
practices that are harmful to society. Properly
imposed, these costs fairly transfer value to suffer-
ing parties and help create incentives that help
prevent similar events from occurring in the future.

The recent financial crisis dramatically illustrates these
points. We witnessed many Wall Street firms engaging in ex-
tremely risky activities that pushed the financial system to the
brink of collapse in 2007 and 2008. Saving the financial system
required a bailout of the banks and other financial companies,
and that bailout imposed huge costs on taxpayers and helped
push the economy into a deep recession. Apart from the huge
costs imposed on society, the financial firms also paid a heavy
price—a number of leading financial institutions saw a huge
drop in their stock price, some failed and went out of business,
and many Wall Street executives lost their jobs.
Arguably, these costs are not enough to prevent another
financial crisis from occurring. Many maintain that the events
surrounding the financial crisis illustrate that markets don’t
always work the way they should, and that there is a need for
stronger regulation of the financial sector. For example, in his
recent books, Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz makes a strong
case for enhanced regulation. At the same time, others with a
different political persuasion continue to express concerns
about the costs of excessive regulation.
Beyond the financial crisis, there is a broader question of
whether laws and regulations are enough to compel firms to
act in society’s interest. An increasing number of companies
continue to recognize the need to maximize shareholder value,
but they also see their mission as more than just making
money for shareholders. Google’s well-known corporate motto
is “Don’t Be Evil.” Consistent with this mission, the company has
its own in-house foundation that has made large investments
in a wide range of philanthropic ventures worldwide.
Looking at another industry, Whole Foods Markets’ CEO
John Mackey is an ardent defender of capitalism, and the
company clearly states on its website, “We are stewards of
our shareholders’ investments and we take that responsibility
very seriously. We are committed to increasing long term
shareholder value.” At the same time, Mackey has created a
business model for Whole Foods that he refers to as “con-
scious capitalism.” This model incorporates a broad set of core
values. These values include:
• Selling the highest quality natural and organic products
available
• Satisfying and delighting our customers
• Supporting team member excellence and happiness
• Creating wealth through profits and growth
• Caring about our communities and our environment
• Creating ongoing win-win partnerships with our suppliers
• Promoting the health of our stakeholders through healthy
eating education.
Mackey makes a strong case that these core values work
together and that the company’s shareholders benefit from
efforts to improve the welfare of its customers, employees,
and surrounding communities. Realistically, however, there
will still be cases where companies face conflicts between
their various constituencies—for example, a company may
enhance shareholder value by laying off some workers, or a
change in policy may improve the environment but reduce
shareholder value. In these instances, managers have to bal-
ance these competing interests and different managers will
clearly make different choices. At the end of the day, all
companies struggle to find the right balance. Enlightened
managers recognize that there is more to life than money,
but it often takes money to do good things.

This chapter will give you an idea of what financial management is all about. We
begin the chapter by describing how finance is related to the overall business environ-
ment, by pointing out that finance prepares students for jobs in different fields of
business, and by discussing the different forms of business organization. For corpora-
tions, management’s goal should be to maximize shareholder wealth, which means
maximizing the value of the stock. When we say “maximizing the value of the stock,”

we mean the “true, long-run value,” which may be different from the current stock
price. In the chapter we discuss how firms must provide the right incentives for
managers to focus on long-run value maximization. Good managers understand
the importance of ethics, and they recognize that maximizing long-run value is
consistent with being socially responsible.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Explain the role of finance and the different types of jobs in finance.
•
Identify the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of business
organization.
•
Explain the links between stock price, intrinsic value, and executive
compensation.
•
Identify the potential conflicts that arise within the firm between stockholders
and managers and between stockholders and bondholders, and discuss the
techniques that firms can use to mitigate these potential conflicts.
•
Discuss the importance of business ethics and the consequences of unethical
behavior.
1-1 WHAT IS FINANCE?
Finance is defined by Webster's Dictionary as “the system that includes the circula-
tion of money, the granting of credit, the making of investments, and the provision
of banking facilities.” Finance has many facets, which makes it difficult to provide
one concise definition. The discussion in this section will give you an idea of what
finance professionals do and what you might do if you enter the finance field after
you graduate.
1-1A AREAS OF FINANCE
Finance as taught in universities is generally divided into three areas: (1) financial
management, (2) capital markets, and (3) investments.
Financial management, also called corporate finance, focuses on decisions relat-
ing to how much and what types of assets to acquire, how to raise the capital
needed to purchase assets, and how to run the firm so as to maximize its value.
The same principles apply to both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations; and
as the title suggests, much of this book is concerned with financial management.
Capital markets relate to the markets where interest rates, along with stock and
bond prices, are determined. Also studied here are the financial institutions that
supply capital to businesses. Banks, investment banks, stockbrokers, mutual
funds, insurance companies, and the like bring together “savers” who have money
to invest and businesses, individuals, and other entities that need capital for
various purposes. Governmental organizations such as the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem, which regulates banks and controls the supply of money, and the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates the trading of stocks and bonds
in public markets, are also studied as part of capital markets.
Investments relate to decisions concerning stocks and bonds and include a
number of activities: (1) Security analysis deals with finding the proper values of
individual securities (i.e., stocks and bonds). (2) Portfolio theory deals with the best
way to structure portfolios, or “baskets,” of stocks and bonds. Rational investors
want to hold diversified portfolios in order to limit risks, so choosing a properly
balanced portfolio is an important issue for any investor. (3) Market analysis deals
with the issue of whether stock and bond markets at any given time are “too
high,” “too low,” or “about right.” Included in market analysis is behavioral finance,
where investor psychology is examined in an effort to determine if stock prices

have been bid up to unreasonable heights in a speculative bubble or driven down to
unreasonable lows in a fit of irrational pessimism.
Although we separate these three areas, they are closely interconnected.
Banking is studied under capital markets, but a bank lending officer evaluating
a business’ loan request must understand corporate finance to make a sound
decision. Similarly, a corporate treasurer negotiating with a banker must under-
stand banking if the treasurer is to borrow on “reasonable” terms. Moreover, a
security analyst trying to determine a stock’s true value must understand corpo-
rate finance and capital markets to do his or her job. In addition, financial
decisions of all types depend on the level of interest rates; so all people in
corporate finance, investments, and banking must know something about interest
rates and the way they are determined. Because of these interdependencies, we
cover all three areas in this book.
1-1B FINANCE WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION
Most businesses and not-for-profit organizations have an organization chart similar
to the one shown in Figure 1.1. The board of directors is the top governing body, and
the chairperson of the board is generally the highest-ranking individual. The CEO
comes next, but note that the chairperson of the board often also serves as the CEO.
Below the CEO comes the chief operating officer (COO), who is often also designated
as a firm’s president. The COO directs the firm’s operations, which include market-
ing, manufacturing, sales, and other operating departments. The chief financial
officer (CFO), who is generally a senior vice president and the third-ranking officer,
is in charge of accounting, finance, credit policy, decisions regarding asset acquisi-
tions, and investor relations, which involves communications with stockholders and
the press.
If the firm is publicly owned, the CEO and the CFO must both certify to the
SEC that reports released to stockholders, and especially the annual report, are
accurate. If inaccuracies later emerge, the CEO and the CFO could be fined or even
jailed. This requirement was instituted in 2002 as a part of the Sarbanes–Oxley
Act. The Act was passed by Congress in the wake of a series of corporate scandals
involving now-defunct companies such as Enron and WorldCom, where inves-
tors, workers, and suppliers lost billions of dollars due to false information
released by those companies.
The duties of the CFO have
broadened over the years.

new responsibilities.

1-1C FINANCE VERSUS ECONOMICS AND ACCOUNTING
Finance, as we know it today, grew out of economics and accounting. Economists
developed the notion that an asset’s value is based on the future cash flows the
asset will provide, and accountants provided information regarding the likely size
of those cash flows. People who work in finance need knowledge of both econom-
ics and accounting. Figure 1.1 illustrates that in the modern corporation, the
accounting department typically falls under the control of the CFO. This further
illustrates the link among finance, economics, and accounting.
1-2 JOBS IN FINANCE
Finance prepares students for jobs in banking, investments, insurance, corpora-
tions, and government. Accounting students need to know marketing, manage-
ment, and human resources; they also need to understand finance, for it affects
decisions in all those areas. For example, marketing people propose advertising
programs, but those programs are examined by finance people to judge the effects
of the advertising on the firm’s profitability. So to be effective in marketing, one
needs to have a basic knowledge of finance. The same holds for management—
indeed, most important management decisions are evaluated in terms of their
effects on the firm’s value.
It is also worth noting that finance is important to individuals regardless of
their jobs. Some years ago most employees received pensions from their employ-
ers upon retirement, so managing one’s personal investments was not critically
important. That’s no longer true. Most firms today provide “defined contribution”
pension plans, where each year the company puts a specified amount of money
into an account that belongs to the employee. The employee must decide how
those funds are to be invested—how much should be divided among stocks,
bonds, or money funds—and how much risk they’re willing to take with their
stock and bond investments. These decisions have a major effect on people’s lives,
and the concepts covered in this book can improve decision-making skills.
1-3 FORMS OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
The basics of financial management are the same for all businesses, large or small,
regardless of how they are organized. Still, a firm’s legal structure affects its
operations and thus should be recognized. There are four main forms of business
organizations: (1) proprietorships, (2) partnerships, (3) corporations, and (4) lim-
ited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs). In terms

of numbers, most businesses are proprietorships. However, based on the dollar
value of sales, more than 80% of all business is done by corporations.1 Because
corporations conduct the most business and because most successful businesses
eventually convert to corporations, we focus on them in this book. Still, it is
important to understand the legal differences between types of firms.
A proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one individual.
Going into business as a sole proprietor is easy—a person begins business opera-
tions. Proprietorships have three important advantages: (1) They are easy and
inexpensive to form, (2) they are subject to few government regulations, and
(3) they are subject to lower income taxes than are corporations. However, pro-
prietorships also have three important limitations: (1) Proprietors have unlimited
personal liability for the business’ debts, so they can lose more than the amount of
money they invested in the company. You might invest $10,000 to start a business
but be sued for $1 million if, during company time, one of your employees runs
over someone with a car. (2) The life of the business is limited to the life of the
individual who created it; and to bring in new equity, investors require a change
in the structure of the business. (3) Because of the first two points, proprietorships
have difficulty obtaining large sums of capital; hence, proprietorships are used
primarily for small businesses. However, businesses are frequently started as
proprietorships and then converted to corporations when their growth results in
the disadvantages outweighing the advantages.
A partnership is a legal arrangement between two or more people who decide
to do business together. Partnerships are similar to proprietorships in that they
can be established relatively easily and inexpensively. Moreover, the firm’s
income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the partners and is taxed on an
individual basis. This allows the firm to avoid the corporate income tax. However,
all of the partners are generally subject to unlimited personal liability, which
means that if a partnership goes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet his
or her pro rata share of the firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be
responsible for making good on the unsatisfied claims. Thus, the actions of a
Texas partner can bring ruin to a millionaire New York partner who had nothing
to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the company. Unlimited liability
makes it difficult for partnerships to raise large amounts of capital.2
A corporation is a legal entity created by a state, and it is separate and distinct
from its owners and managers. It is this separation that limits stockholders’ losses
to the amount they invested in the firm—the corporation can lose all of its money,
but its owners can lose only the funds that they invested in the company.
Corporations also have unlimited lives, and it is easier to transfer shares of stock
in a corporation than one’s interest in an unincorporated business. These factors
make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large
businesses. Thus, companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft generally
begin as proprietorships or partnerships, but at some point they find it advanta-
geous to become a corporation.
1Refer to U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012 (www.census.gov/
compendia/statab), Table 744: Number of Tax Returns, Receipts, and Net Income by Type of
Business: 1990 to 2008, p. 491.
2Originally, there were just straightforward partnerships; but over the years, lawyers have created a
number of variations. We leave the variations to courses on business law, but we note that the
variations are generally designed to limit the liabilities of some of the partners. For example, a
limited partnership has a general partner, who has unlimited liability, and one or more limited
partners, whose liability is limited to the amount of their investment. This sounds great from the
standpoint of limited liability; but the limited partners must cede sole control to the general partner,
which means that they have almost no say in the way the firm is managed. With a corporation, the
owners (stockholders) have limited liability, but they also have the right to vote and thus change
management if they think that a change is in order. Note too that LLCs and LLPs, discussed later in
this section, are increasingly used in lieu of partnerships.

A major drawback to corporations is taxes. Most corporations’ earnings are
subject to double taxation—the corporation’s earnings are taxed; and then when
its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividends, those earnings are taxed again as
personal income to the stockholders. However, as an aid to small businesses,
Congress created S corporations, which are taxed as if they were proprietorships
or partnerships; thus, they are exempt from the corporate income tax. To qualify
for S corporation status, a firm can have no more than 100 stockholders, which
limits their use to relatively small, privately owned firms. Larger corporations are
known as C corporations. The vast majority of small corporations elect S status and
retain that status until they decide to sell stock to the public, at which time they
become C corporations.
A limited liability company (LLC) is a popular type of organization that is a
hybrid between a partnership and a corporation. A limited liability partnership
(LLP) is similar to an LLC. LLPs are used for professional firms in the fields of
accounting, law, and architecture, while LLCs are used by other businesses.
Similar to corporations, LLCs and LLPs provide limited liability protection, but
they are taxed as partnerships. Further, unlike limited partnerships, where the
general partner has full control of the business, the investors in an LLC or LLP
have votes in proportion to their ownership interest. LLCs and LLPs have been
gaining in popularity in recent years, but large companies still find it advanta-
geous to be C corporations because of the advantages in raising capital to support
growth. LLCs/LLPs were dreamed up by lawyers, and they are often structured
in very complicated ways and their legal protections often vary by state. So, it is
necessary to hire a good lawyer when establishing one.
When deciding on its form of organization, a firm must trade off the advan-
tages of incorporation against a possibly higher tax burden. However, for the
following reasons, the value of any business other than a relatively small one will
probably be maximized if it is organized as a corporation:
1.
Limited liability reduces the risks borne by investors; and other things held
constant, the lower the firm’s risk, the higher its value.
2.
A firm’s value is dependent on its growth opportunities, which are dependent
on its ability to attract capital. Because corporations can attract capital more
easily than other types of businesses, they are better able to take advantage of
growth opportunities.
3.
The value of an asset also depends on its liquidity, which means the time and
effort it takes to sell the asset for cash at a fair market value. Because the stock
of a corporation is easier to transfer to a potential buyer than is an interest in a
proprietorship or partnership, and because more investors are willing to
invest in stocks than in partnerships (with their potential unlimited liability), a
corporate investment is relatively liquid. This too enhances the value of a
corporation.

1-4 THE MAIN FINANCIAL GOAL: CREATING VALUE FOR INVESTORS
In public corporations, managers and employees work on behalf of the share-
holders who own the business, and therefore they have an obligation to pursue
policies that promote stockholder value. While many companies focus on max-
imizing a broad range of financial objectives such as growth, earnings per share,
and market share, these goals should not take precedence over the main financial
goal, which is to create value for investors. Keep in mind that a company’s
stockholders are not just an abstract group—they represent individuals and orga-
nizations who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash into the company, and
who are looking for a return on their investment in order to meet their long-term
financial goals which might be saving for retirement, a new home, or a child’s
education.
If a manager is to maximize stockholder wealth, he or she must know how
that wealth is determined. Throughout this book, we shall see that the value of
any asset is the present value of the stream of cash flows that the asset provides to
its owners over time. We discuss stock valuation in depth in Chapter 9, where we
see that stock prices are based on cash flows expected in future years, not just in
the current year. Thus, stock price maximization requires us to take a long-run
view of operations. At the same time, managerial actions that affect a company’s
value may not immediately be reflected in the company’s stock price.
1-4A DETERMINANTS OF VALUE
Figure 1.2 illustrates the situation. The top box indicates that managerial actions,
combined with the economy, taxes, and political conditions, influence the level
and riskiness of the company’s future cash flows which ultimately determine the
company’s stock price. As you might expect, investors like higher expected cash
flows, but they dislike risk; so the larger the expected cash flows and the lower the
perceived risk, the higher the stock’s price.

The second row of boxes differentiates what we call “true” expected cash
flows and “true” risk from “perceived” cash flows and “perceived” risk. By
“true,” we mean the cash flows and risk that investors would expect if they had
all of the information that existed about a company. “Perceived” means what
investors expect, given the limited information they have. To illustrate, in early
2001, investors had information that caused them to think Enron was highly
profitable and would enjoy high and rising future profits. They also thought that
actual results would be close to the expected levels and hence, that Enron’s risk
was low. However, true estimates of Enron’s profits, which were known by its
executives but not the investing public, were much lower; and Enron’s true
situation was extremely risky.
The third row of boxes shows that each stock has an intrinsic value, which is
an estimate of the stock’s “true” value as calculated by a competent analyst who
has the best available data, and a market price, which is the actual market price
based on perceived but possibly incorrect information as seen by the marginal
investor.3 Not all investors agree, so it is the “marginal” investor who determines
the actual price.
When a stock’s actual market price is equal to its intrinsic value, the stock is in
equilibrium, which is shown in the bottom box in Figure 1.2. When equilibrium
exists, there is no pressure for a change in the stock’s price. Market prices can—
and do—differ from intrinsic values; but eventually, as the future unfolds, the two
values tend to converge.
1-4B INTRINSIC VALUE
Actual stock prices are easy to determine—they can be found on the Internet and
are published in newspapers every day. However, intrinsic values are estimates;
and different analysts with different data and different views about the future
form different estimates of a stock’s intrinsic value. Indeed, estimating intrinsic
values is what security analysis is all about and is what distinguishes successful from
unsuccessful investors. Investing would be easy, profitable, and essentially riskless
if we knew all stocks’ intrinsic values; but, of course, we don’t. We can estimate
intrinsic values, but we can’t be sure that we are right. A firm’s managers have the
best information about the firm’s future prospects, so managers’ estimates of
intrinsic values are generally better than those of outside investors. However,
even managers can be wrong.
Figure 1.3 graphs a hypothetical company’s actual price and intrinsic value as
estimated by its management over time.4 The intrinsic value rises because the firm
retains and reinvests earnings each year, which tends to increase profits. The value
jumped dramatically in 2008, when a research and development (R&D) break-
through raised management’s estimate of future profits before investors had this
information. The actual stock price tended to move up and down with the
estimated intrinsic value; but investor optimism and pessimism, along with
3Investors at the margin are the ones who actually set stock prices. Some stockholders think that a
stock at its current price is a good deal, and they would buy more if they had more money. Others
think that the stock is priced too high, so they would not buy it unless the price dropped sharply. Still
others think that the current stock price is about where it should be; so they would buy more if the
price fell slightly, sell it if the price rose slightly, and maintain their current holdings unless something
were to change. These are the marginal investors, and it is their view that determines the current stock
price. We discuss this point in more depth in Chapter 9, where we discuss the stock market in detail.
4We emphasize that the intrinsic value is an estimate and that different analysts have different
estimates for a company at any given time. Managers should also estimate their firm’s intrinsic
value and then take actions to maximize that value. They should try to help outside security
analysts improve their intrinsic value estimates by providing accurate information about the
company’s financial position and operations, but without releasing information that would help its
competitors.
Intrinsic Value
An estimate of a stock’s
“true” value based on
accurate risk and return
data. The intrinsic value
can be estimated but not
measured precisely.

The stock value based on
perceived but possibly
incorrect information as
seen by the marginal
investor.

An investor whose views
determine the actual stock

imperfect knowledge about the true intrinsic value, led to deviations between the
actual prices and intrinsic values.
Intrinsic value is a long-run concept. Management’s goal should be to take actions
designed to maximize the firm’s intrinsic value, not its current market price. Note,
though, that maximizing the intrinsic value will maximize the average price over
the long run, but not necessarily the current price at each point in time. For
example, management might make an investment that lowers profits for the
current year but raises expected future profits. If investors are not aware of the
true situation, the stock price will be held down by the low current profit even
though the intrinsic value was actually raised. Management should provide
information that helps investors make better estimates of the firm’s intrinsic value,
which will keep the stock price closer to its equilibrium level. However, there are
times when management cannot divulge the true situation because doing so
would provide information that helps its competitors.5
1-4C CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING A SHORT-RUN FOCUS
Ideally, managers adhere to this long-run focus, but there are numerous examples
in recent years where the focus for many companies shifted to the short run.
Perhaps most notably, prior to the recent financial crisis, many Wall Street execu-
tives received huge bonuses for engaging in risky transactions that generated
short-term profits. Subsequently, the value of these transactions collapsed causing
many of these Wall Street firms to seek a massive government bailout.

5As we discuss in Chapter 2, many academics believe that stock prices embody all publicly available
information—hence, that stock prices are typically reasonably close to their intrinsic values and thus at
or close to equilibrium. However, almost no one doubts that managers have better information than
the public at large, that at times stock prices and equilibrium values diverge, and thus that stocks can
be temporarily undervalued or overvalued (as we suggest in Figure 1.3).

Apart from the recent problems on Wall Street, there have been other exam-
ples where managers have focused on short-run profits to the detriment of long-
term value. Many academics and practitioners stress the important role that
executive compensation plays in encouraging managers to focus on the proper
objectives. For example, if a manager’s bonus is tied solely to this year’s earnings,
it would not be a surprise to discover that the manager took steps to pump up
current earnings—even if those steps were detrimental to the firm’s long-run
value. With these concerns in mind, a growing number of companies have used
stock and stock options as a key part of executive pay. The intent of structuring
compensation in this way is for managers to think more like stockholders and to
continually work to increase shareholder value.
Despite the best of intentions, stock-based compensation does not always
work as planned. To give managers an incentive to focus on stock prices, stock-
holders (acting through boards of directors) awarded executives stock options that
could be exercised on a specified future date. An executive could exercise the
option on that date, receive stock, immediately sell it, and earn a profit. The profit
was based on the stock price on the option exercise date, which led some man-
agers to try to maximize the stock price on that specific date, not over the long run.
That, in turn, led to some horrible abuses. Projects that looked good from a long-
run perspective were turned down because they would penalize profits in the
short run and thus lower the stock price on the option exercise day. Even worse,
some managers deliberately overstated profits, temporarily boosted the stock
price, exercised their options, sold the inflated stock, and left outside stockholders
“holding the bag” when the true situation was revealed. Enron and WorldCom
are examples of companies whose managers did this, but there have been many
others.
1-5 STOCKHOLDER–MANAGER CONFLICTS6
It has long been recognized that managers’ personal goals may compete with
shareholder wealth maximization. In particular, managers might be more inter-
ested in maximizing their own wealth than their stockholders’ wealth; therefore,
managers might pay themselves excessive salaries.

the heading of “agency theory” in finance literature. The classic work on agency theory is Michael C.

Ownership Structure,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 3, no. 4 (October 1976), pp. 305–360.

Effective executive compensation plans motivate managers to act in their
stockholders’ best interests. Useful motivational tools include (1) reasonable com-
pensation packages, (2) firing of managers who don’t perform well, and (3) the
threat of hostile takeovers.
1-5A COMPENSATION PACKAGES
Compensation packages should be sufficient to attract and retain able managers, but
they should not go beyond what is needed. Compensation policies need to be
consistent over time. Also, compensation should be structured so that managers
are rewarded on the basis of the stock’s performance over the long run, not the
stock’s price on an option exercise date. This means that options (or direct stock
awards) should be phased in over a number of years so that managers have an
incentive to keep the stock price high over time. When the intrinsic value can be
measured in an objective and verifiable manner, performance pay can be based on
changes in intrinsic value. However, because intrinsic value is not observable,
compensation must be based on the stock’s market price—but the price used
should be an average over time rather than on a specific date.
1-5B DIRECT STOCKHOLDER INTERVENTION
Years ago most stock was owned by individuals. Today, however, the majority
of stock is owned by institutional investors such as insurance companies, pen-
sion funds, hedge funds, and mutual funds; and private equity groups are ready
and able to step in and take over underperforming firms. These institutional
money managers have the clout to exercise considerable influence over firms’
operations. First, they can speak with managers and make suggestions about
how the business should be run. In effect, institutional investors such as Cal-
PERS (California Public Employees’ Retirement System, with $231 billion of
assets) and TIAA-CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College
Retirement Equity Fund, a retirement plan originally set up for professors at
private colleges that now has more than $453 billion of assets) act as lobbyists for
the body of stockholders. When such large stockholders speak, companies listen.
Second, any shareholder who has owned $2,000 of a company’s stock for one
year can sponsor a proposal that may be voted on at the annual stockholders’
meeting, even if management opposes the proposal.7 Although shareholder-
sponsored proposals are nonbinding, the results of such votes are heard by top
management.
There has been an ongoing debate regarding how much influence share-
holders should have through the proxy process. As a result of the passage of the
Dodd–Frank Act, the SEC was given authority to make rules regarding share-
holder access to company proxy materials. On August 25, 2010, the SEC adopted
changes to federal proxy rules to give shareholders the right to nominate directors
to a company’s board. Rule 14a-11 under the 1934 SEC Act will require public
companies to permit any shareholder owning at least 3% of a public company’s
voting stock for at least three years to include director nominations in the com-
pany’s proxy materials.
Until recently, the probability of a large firm’s management being ousted by
its stockholders was so remote that it posed little threat. Most firms’ shares were
so widely distributed and the CEO had so much control over the voting mech-
anism that it was virtually impossible for dissident stockholders to get the votes
7Under current guidelines, shareholder proposals are restricted to governance issues and shareholders
are not allowed to vote directly on items that are considered to be “operating issues.” However, the
SEC recently adopted rules (resulting from the passage of the Dodd–Frank Act) mandating an advisory
vote on CEO compensation at least once every three years.

needed to overthrow a management team. However, that situation has changed.
In recent years, the top executives of Citigroup, AT&T, Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch,
Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, General Motors, Peugeot, IBM, and Xerox, to name
a few, were forced out due to poor corporate performance.
ARE CEOS OVERPAID?
In a 2012 survey of 300 large U.S. corporations, the Hay Group
found that the median CEO received $10.1 million in total
compensation (which includes salaries, bonuses, and long-term
incentives such as stock options.). Compared to 2011, total CEO
compensation increased 3.6%, while the average worker’s pay
raise was only 2.3%. The survey also found a somewhat stron-
ger link between CEO pay and the firm’s performance (as
measured by profits and stock returns).
Over the past three years, total compensation has increased
only slightly after accounting for inflation. Moreover, the struc-
ture of the average CEO compensation package has remained
somewhat similar –the typical CEO has received a salary of $1.1
million, an annual bonus around $2 million, and stock options
initially worth $7 million. Arguably, media scrutiny and investor
concerns about excessive compensation have led some com-
panies to limit the compensation paid to their top executives. A
further concern are the recent “Say on Pay” provisions in the
2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which give shareholders an ability to vote
on whether they approve of the CEO’s compensation package.
While these votes are nonbinding, they have put pressure on
firms who want to avoid the negative publicity surrounding a
shareholder vote to reject the pay plan.
While the increase in average CEO pay was fairly modest
in 2012, many top CEOs still received extraordinarily high
levels of total compensation. The top five highest paid CEOs
were: Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($94.6 million), CBS’s Leslie Moon-
ves ($58.8 million), Walt Disney Co.’s Robert Iger ($36.3
million), Nike’s Mark Parker ($33.9 million), and Viacom’s
Philippe Dauman ($33.1 million). At the same time, many
CEOs who have received stock options in previous years
have seen the value of these options increase dramatically
because of the recent run-up in the stock market.
The modest increase in CEO pay the past three years
follows declines in median compensation in 2008 and
2009. Looking at a longer time frame, average compensation
levels are significantly higher than they were a decade ago.
(Average CEO compensation in 2002 was approximately $3.7
million.) The large shifts in CEO compensation over time can
often be attributed to the increased importance of stock
options. Relatedly, over the past few years, a small number
of CEOs have attracted attention by announcing that they
are only going to accept a $1 cash salary. A recent study
finds that shareholders of these firms don’t do particularly
well, but the CEOs’ total compensation doesn’t suffer since
they instead receive offsetting compensation in the form of
stock and stock options. The study concludes that the pri-
mary reason that these managers announce their $1 salary is
to “employ camouflage in compensation schemes to avoid
public outrage over excessive private benefits.”8 On the plus
side, stock options provide CEOs with a powerful incentive
to raise their companies’ stock prices. Indeed, most obser-
vers believe there is a strong causal relationship between
CEO compensation procedures and stock price performance.
Other critics argue that although performance incentives are
entirely appropriate as a method of compensation, the overall
level of CEO compensation is just too high. The critics ask such
questions as these: Would these CEOs have been unwilling to
take their jobs if they had been offered only half as many stock
options? Would they have put forth less effort, and would their
firms’ stock prices have not increased as much? It is hard to say.
Other critics lament that the exercise of stock options has
dramatically increased the compensation of not only truly excel-
lent CEOs, but it has also dramatically increased the compensa-
tion of some pretty average CEOs, who were lucky enough to
have had the job during a stock market boom that raised the
stock prices of even poor-performing companies. In addition,
huge CEO salaries are widening the gap between top execu-
tives and middle management salaries leading to employee
discontent and declining employee morale and loyalty.
As the current survey indicates, the shift to better align
CEO pay with corporate performance is modest and could
reverse in the future. Stock returns and corporate financial
results are only two factors impacting CEO pay. Other factors
that influence CEO pay are the size of the firm (larger
companies pay their CEOs more) and the type of industry
(energy companies pay their CEOs more). Only time will tell
if the modest results shown in the 2012 survey continue in
future years.

1-5C MANAGERS’ RESPONSE
If a firm’s stock is undervalued, corporate raiders will see it as a bargain and will
attempt to capture the firm in a hostile takeover. If the raid is successful, the
target’s executives will almost certainly be fired. This situation gives managers a
strong incentive to take actions to maximize their stock’s price. In the words of one
executive, “If you want to keep your job, never let your stock become a bargain.”
Note that the price managers should be trying to maximize is not the price on
a specific day. Rather, it is the average price over the long run, which will be
maximized if management focuses on the stock’s intrinsic value. However, man-
agers must communicate effectively with stockholders (without divulging infor-
mation that would aid their competitors) to keep the actual price close to the
intrinsic value. It’s bad for stockholders and managers when the intrinsic value is
high but the actual price is low. In that situation, a raider may swoop in, buy the
company at a bargain price, and fire the managers. To repeat our earlier message:
Managers should try to maximize their stock’s intrinsic value and then
communicate effectively with stockholders. That will cause the intrinsic
value to be high and the actual stock price to remain close to the intrinsic
value over time.
Because the intrinsic value cannot be observed, it is impossible to know
whether it is really being maximized. Still, as we will discuss in Chapter 9, there
are procedures for estimating a stock’s intrinsic value. Managers can use these
valuation models to analyze alternative courses of action and thus see how these
actions are likely to impact the firm’s value. This type of value-based management
is not precise, but it is the best way to run a business.
1-6 STOCKHOLDER–DEBTHOLDER CONFLICTS
Conflicts can also arise between stockholders and debtholders. Debtholders, which
include the company’s bankers and its bondholders, generally receive fixed pay-
ments regardless of how well the company does, while stockholders do better when
the company does better. This situation leads to conflicts between these two groups,
to the extent that stockholders are typically more willing to take on risky projects.9
To illustrate this problem, consider the example in Table 1.1, where a com-
pany has raised $2,000 in capital, $1,000 from bondholders and $1,000 from
stockholders. To keep things simple, we assume that the bonds have a one-year
maturity and pay an 8% annual interest rate. The company’s current plan is to
invest its $2,000 in Project L, a relatively low-risk project that is expected to be
worth $2,400 one year from now if the market is good and $2,000 if the market is
bad. There is a 50% chance that the market will be good and a 50% chance the

their stock’s long-run price?
Should managers focus directly on the stock’s actual market price or its intrinsic
value, or are both important? Explain.
9We are assuming here that managers make decisions on behalf of stockholders, so saying that there
are conflicts between stockholders and debtholders is the same as saying there are conflicts between
managers and debtholders.

market will be bad. In either case, there will be enough cash to pay the bond-
holders their money back plus the 8% annual interest rate that they were pro-
mised. The stockholders will receive whatever is left over after the bondholders
have been paid. As expected, because they are paid last, the stockholders are
bearing more risk (their payoff depends on the market), but they are also earning a
higher expected return.
Now assume that the company discovers another project (Project H) that has
considerably more risk. Project H has the same expected cash flow as Project L,
but it will produce cash flows of $4,400 if the market is good but $0 if the market is
bad. Clearly, the bondholders would not be interested in Project H, because they
wouldn’t receive any additional benefits if the market is good and they would lose
everything if the market is bad. Notice, however, that Project H provides a higher
rate of return for stockholders than Project L, because they capture all of the extra
benefits if the market turns out to be good. While Project H is clearly riskier, in
some circumstances managers acting on behalf of the stockholders may decide
that the higher expected return is enough to justify the additional risk, and they
would proceed with Project H, despite the strong objections of the bondholders.
Notice, however, that astute bondholders understand that managers and
stockholders may have an incentive to shift to riskier projects. Recognizing this
incentive, they will view the bonds as being riskier and will demand a higher rate
of return, and in some cases the perceived risk may be so great that they will not
invest in the company, unless the managers can credibly convince bondholders
that the company will not pursue excessively risky projects.
Another type of stockholder–debtholder conflict arises over the use of addi-
tional debt. As we see later in this book, the more debt a firm uses to finance a
given amount of assets, the riskier the firm becomes. For example, if a firm has
$100 million of assets and finances them with $5 million of bonds and $95 million
of common stock, things have to go terribly bad before the bondholders suffer a
loss. On the other hand, if the firm uses $95 million of bonds and $5 million of

stock, the bondholders suffer a loss even if the value of the assets declines only
slightly.
Bondholders attempt to protect themselves by including covenants in the
bond agreements that limit firms’ use of additional debt and constrain managers’
actions in other ways. We address these issues later in this book, but they are quite
important and everyone should be aware of them.
1-7 BALANCING SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
Throughout this book, we focus primarily on publicly owned companies; hence,
we operate on the assumption that management’s primary goal is shareholder
wealth maximization. At the same time, the managers know that this does not
mean maximize shareholder value “at all costs.” Managers have an obligation to
behave ethically, and they must follow the laws and other society-imposed con-
straints that we discussed in the opening vignette to this chapter.
To understand how corporate managers balance the interests of society and
shareholders, it is helpful to first look at those issues from the perspective of a sole
proprietor. Consider Larry Jackson, the owner of a local sporting goods store.
Jackson is in business to make money, but he likes to take time off to play golf on
Fridays. He also has a few employees who are no longer very productive, but he
keeps them on the payroll out of friendship and loyalty. Jackson is running the
business in a way that is consistent with his own personal goals. He knows that he
could make more money if he didn’t play golf or if he replaced some of his
employees. But he is comfortable with his choices; and because it is his business,
he is free to make those choices.
By contrast, Linda Smith is CEO of a large corporation. Smith manages the
company; however most of the stock is owned by shareholders who purchased it
because they were looking for an investment that would help them retire, send
their children to college, pay for a long-anticipated trip, and so forth. The share-
holders elected a board of directors, which then selected Smith to run the
company. Smith and the firm’s other managers are working on behalf of the
shareholders, and they were hired to pursue policies that enhance shareholder
value.
Most managers understand that maximizing shareholder value does not mean
that they are free to ignore the larger interests of society. Consider, for example,
what would happen if Linda Smith narrowly focused on creating shareholder
value, but in the process, her company was unresponsive to its employees and
customers, hostile to its local community, and indifferent to the effects its actions
had on the environment. In all likelihood, society would impose a wide range of
costs on the company. It may find it hard to attract top-notch employees, its
products may be boycotted, it may face additional lawsuits and regulations, and
it may be confronted with negative publicity. These costs would ultimately lead
to a reduction in shareholder value. So clearly when taking steps to maximize

shareholder value, enlightened managers need to also keep in mind these society-
imposed constraints.10
From a broader perspective, firms have a number of different departments,
including marketing, accounting, production, human resources, and finance.
The finance department’s principal task is to evaluate proposed decisions and
judge how they will affect the stock price and thus shareholder wealth. For
example, suppose the production manager wants to replace some old equip-
ment with new automated machinery that will reduce labor costs. The finance
staff will evaluate that proposal and determine whether the savings seem to be
worth the cost. Similarly, if marketing wants to spend $10 million advertising
during the Super Bowl, the financial staff will evaluate the proposal, look at the
probable increase in sales, and reach a conclusion as to whether the money
spent will lead to a higher stock price. Most significant decisions are evaluated
in terms of their financial consequences, but astute managers recognize that
they also need to take into account how these decisions affect society at large.
INVESTING IN SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FUNDS
The same societal pressures that have encouraged consu-
mers to buy products of companies that they believe to be
socially responsible have also led some investors to search
for ways to limit their investments to firms they deem to be
socially responsible. Indeed, today there are a large number
of mutual funds that only invest in companies that meet
specified social goals. Each of these socially responsible
funds applies different criteria, but typically they consider a
company’s environmental record, its commitment to social
causes, and its employee relations. Many of these funds also
avoid investments in companies that are involved with
alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and nuclear power. Investment
performance varies among funds from year to year. The
accompanying chart compares the past performance of a
representative socially responsible fund, the Domini Social
Equity Fund, with that of the S&P 500 during the past 20+
years. While the general shape of each is similar, in the past
decade the S&P 500 has outperformed this fund.

1-8 BUSINESS ETHICS
As a result of the financial scandals occurring during the past decade, there has
been a strong push to improve business ethics. This is occurring on many fronts—
actions begun by former New York attorney general and former governor Elliot
Spitzer and others who sued companies for improper acts; Congress’ passing of
the Sarbanes–Oxley bill to impose sanctions on executives who sign financial
statements later found to be false; Congress’ passing of the Dodd–Frank Act to
implement an aggressive overhaul of the U.S. financial regulatory system aimed at
preventing reckless actions that would cause another financial crisis; and business
schools trying to inform students about proper versus improper business actions.
As noted earlier, companies benefit from having good reputations and are
penalized by having bad ones; the same is true for individuals. Reputations reflect
the extent to which firms and people are ethical. Ethics is defined in Webster’s
Dictionary as “standards of conduct or moral behavior.” Business ethics can be
thought of as a company’s attitude and conduct toward its employees, customers,
community, and stockholders. A firm’s commitment to business ethics can be
measured by the tendency of its employees, from the top down, to adhere to
laws, regulations, and moral standards relating to product safety and quality, fair
employment practices, fair marketing and selling practices, the use of confidential
information for personal gain, community involvement, and the use of illegal
payments to obtain business.
1-8A WHAT COMPANIES ARE DOING
Most firms today have strong written codes of ethical behavior; companies also
conduct training programs to ensure that employees understand proper behavior
in different situations. When conflicts arise involving profits and ethics, ethical
considerations sometimes are so obviously important that they dominate. In other
cases, however, the right choice is not clear. For example, suppose that Norfolk
Southern’s managers know that its coal trains are polluting the air; but the amount
of pollution is within legal limits, and further reduction would be costly. Are the
managers ethically bound to reduce pollution? Similarly, several years ago
Merck’s research indicated that its Vioxx pain medicine might be causing heart
attacks. However, the evidence was not overly strong, and the product was clearly
helping some patients. Over time, additional tests produced stronger evidence
that Vioxx did pose a health risk. What should Merck have done, and when
should Merck have done it? If the company released negative but perhaps incor-
rect information, this announcement would have hurt sales and possibly pre-
vented some patients benefitting from the product. If the company delayed the
release of this additional information, more patients might have suffered irrever-
sible harm. At what point should Merck have made the potential problem known
to the public? There are no obvious answers to questions such as these; but
companies must deal with them, and a failure to handle them properly can lead
to severe consequences.

1-8B CONSEQUENCES OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR
Over the past few years, ethical lapses have led to a number of bankruptcies.
The collapses of Enron and WorldCom as well as the accounting firm Arthur
Andersen dramatically illustrate how unethical behavior can lead to a firm’s
rapid decline. In all three cases, top executives came under fire because of
misleading accounting practices that led to overstated profits. Enron and World-
Com executives were busily selling their stock at the same time they were
recommending the stock to employees and outside investors. These executives
reaped millions before the stock declined, while lower-level employees and
outside investors were left “holding the bag.” Some of these executives are
now in jail, and Enron’s CEO had a fatal heart attack while awaiting sentencing
after being found guilty of conspiracy and fraud. Moreover, Merrill Lynch and
Citigroup, which were accused of facilitating these frauds, were fined hundreds
of millions of dollars.
In other cases, companies avoid bankruptcy but face a damaging blow to
their reputation. Safety concerns tarnished Toyota’s once-sterling reputation for
reliability. Ethical questions were raised regarding when the company’s senior
management became aware of the problems, and whether they were forthcom-
ing in sharing these concerns with the public. In April 2010, the SEC brought
forth a civil fraud suit against Goldman Sachs. The SEC contended that Goldman
Sachs misled its investors when it created and marketed securities that were
backed by subprime mortgages. In July 2010, Goldman Sachs ultimately reached
a settlement where it agreed to pay $550 million. While just one example, many
believe that too many Wall Street executives in recent years have been willing to
compromise their ethics. In May 2011, Raj Rajararnam, the founder of the hedge
fund Galleon Group LLC, was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy in
one of the government’s largest insider trading cases. Mr. Rajararnam traded on
information (worth approximately $63.8 million) from insiders at technology
companies and others in the hedge fund industry. On October 13, 2011, he was
sentenced to 11 years in prison. Even more recently, regulators have accused
a number of high-profile institutions of actively manipulating the London
Interbank Offer Rate (the LIBOR rate) to make additional profits on their trades.
These accusations are particularly important because the LIBOR rate is used
to set the terms in many financial contracts. These investigations are ongoing,
but already regulators have fined Barclays Bank and UBS for their parts in
this scandal.
The perception of widespread improper actions has caused many investors to
lose faith in American business and to turn away from the stock market, which
makes it difficult for firms to raise the capital they need to grow, create jobs, and
stimulate the economy. So, unethical actions can have adverse consequences far
beyond the companies that perpetrate them.
All this raises a question: Are companies unethical, or is it just a few of their
employees? That was a central issue that came up in the case of Arthur Andersen,
the accounting firm that audited Enron, WorldCom, and several other companies
that committed accounting fraud. Evidence showed that relatively few of Ander-
sen’s accountants helped perpetrate the frauds. Its top managers argued that
while a few rogue employees did bad things, most of the firm’s 85,000 employees,
and the firm itself, were innocent. The U.S. Justice Department disagreed, con-
cluding that the firm was guilty because it fostered a climate where unethical
behavior was permitted and that Andersen used an incentive system that made
such behavior profitable to both the perpetrators and the firm. As a result,
Andersen was put out of business, its partners lost millions of dollars, and its
85,000 employees lost their jobs. In most other cases, individuals rather than firms
were tried; and while the firms survived, they suffered damage to their reputa-
tions, which greatly lowered their future profit potential and value.

1-8C HOW SHOULD EMPLOYEES DEAL WITH
UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR?
Far too often the desire for stock options, bonuses, and promotions drives
managers to take unethical actions such as fudging the books to make profits
in the manager’s division look good, holding back information about bad prod-
ucts that would depress sales, and failing to take costly but needed measures to
protect the environment. Generally, these acts don’t rise to the level of an Enron
or a WorldCom, but they are still bad. If questionable things are going on, who
should take action and what should that action be? Obviously, in situations such
as Enron and WorldCom, where fraud was being perpetrated at or close to the
top, senior managers knew about the illegal activities. In other cases, the problem
is caused by a mid-level manager trying to boost his or her unit’s profits and thus
his or her bonus. In all cases, though, at least some lower-level employees are
aware of what’s happening; they may even be ordered to take fraudulent actions.
Should the lower-level employees obey their boss’s orders; refuse to obey those
orders; or report the situation to a higher authority, such as the company’s board
of directors, the company’s auditors, or a federal prosecutor?
In the WorldCom and Enron cases, it was clear to a number of employees that
unethical and illegal acts were being committed; but in cases such as Merck’s Vioxx
product, the situation was less clear. Because early evidence that Vioxx led to heart
attacks was weak and evidence of its pain reduction was strong, it was probably not
appropriate to sound an alarm early on. However, as evidence accumulated, at
some point the public needed to be given a strong warning or the product should
have been taken off the market. But judgment comes into play when deciding on
what action to take and when to take it. If a lower-level employee thinks that a
product should be pulled but the boss disagrees, what should the employee do? If
an employee decides to report the problem, trouble may ensue regardless of the
merits of the case. If the alarm is false, the company will have been harmed and
nothing will have been gained. In that case, the employee will probably be fired.
Even if the employee is right, his or her career may still be ruined because many
companies (or at least bosses) don’t like “disloyal, troublemaking” employees.
Such situations arise fairly often ranging from accounting fraud to product
liability and environmental cases. Employees jeopardize their jobs if they come
forward over their bosses’ objections. However, if they don’t speak up, they may
suffer emotional problems and contribute to the downfall of their companies and
the accompanying loss of jobs and savings. Moreover, if employees obey orders
regarding actions they know are illegal, they may end up going to jail. Indeed, in
most of the scandals that have gone to trial, the lower-level people who physically
entered the bad data received longer jail sentences than the bosses who presum-
ably gave the directives. So employees can be “stuck between a rock and a
hard place,” that is, doing what they should do and possibly losing their jobs
versus going along with the boss and possibly ending up in jail. This discussion
shows why ethics is such an important consideration in business and in business
schools—and why we are concerned with it in this book.

This chapter provides a broad overview of financial management. Management’s
primary goal should be to maximize the long-run value of the stock, which means the
intrinsic value as measured by the stock’s price over time. To maximize value, firms
must develop products that consumers want, produce the products efficiently, sell
them at competitive prices, and observe laws relating to corporate behavior. If
firms are successful at maximizing the stock’s value, they will also be contributing
to social welfare and citizens’ well-being.
Businesses can be organized as proprietorships, partnerships, corporations,
limited liability companies (LLCs), or limited liability partnerships (LLPs). The vast
majority of all business is done by corporations, and the most successful firms
become corporations, which explains the focus on corporations in this book.
The primary tasks of the CFO are (1) to make sure the accounting system provides
“good” numbers for internal decision making and for investors, (2) to ensure that the
firm is financed in the proper manner, (3) to evaluate the operating units to make sure
they are performing in an optimal manner, and (4) to evaluate all proposed capital
expenditures to make sure they will increase the firm’s value. In the remainder of this
book, we discuss exactly how financial managers carry out these tasks.

QUESTIONS
1-1
What is a firm’s intrinsic value? Its current stock price? Is the stock’s “true” long-run value
more closely related to its intrinsic value or to its current price?
1-2
When is a stock said to be in equilibrium? Why might a stock at any point in time not be in
equilibrium?
1-3
Suppose three honest individuals gave you their estimates of Stock X’s intrinsic value. One
person is your current roommate, the second person is a professional security analyst with
an excellent reputation on Wall Street, and the third person is Company X’s CFO. If the
three estimates differed, in which one would you have the most confidence? Why?

1-4
Is it better for a firm’s actual stock price in the market to be under, over, or equal to its intrinsic
value? Would your answer be the same from the standpoints of stockholders in general and a
CEO who is about to exercise a million dollars in options and then retire? Explain.
1-5
If a company’s board of directors wants management to maximize shareholder wealth, should the
CEO’s compensation be set as a fixed dollar amount, or should the compensation depend on how
well the firm performs? If it is to be based on performance, how should performance be measured?
Would it be easier to measure performance by the growth rate in reported profits or the growth rate
in the stock’s intrinsic value? Which would be the better performance measure? Why?
1-6
What are the various forms of business organization? What are the advantages and disadvantages
of each?
1-7
Should stockholder wealth maximization be thought of as a long-term or a short-term goal? For
example, if one action increases a firm’s stock price from a current level of $20 to $25 in 6 months
and then to $30 in 5 years but another action keeps the stock at $20 for several years but then
increases it to $40 in 5 years, which action would be better? Think of some specific corporate
actions that have these general tendencies.
1-8
What are some actions that stockholders can take to ensure that management’s and stockholders’
interests are aligned?
1-9
The president of Southern Semiconductor Corporation (SSC) made this statement in the com-
pany’s annual report: “SSC’s primary goal is to increase the value of our common stockholders’
equity.” Later in the report, the following announcements were made:
a.
The company contributed $1.5 million to the symphony orchestra in Birmingham, Alabama,
its headquarters city.
b.
The company is spending $500 million to open a new plant and expand operations in
China. No profits will be produced by the Chinese operation for 4 years, so earnings will be
depressed during this period versus what they would have been had the decision been
made not to expand in China.
c.
The company holds about half of its assets in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds, and it keeps
these funds available for use in emergencies. In the future, though, SSC plans to shift its
emergency funds from Treasury bonds to common stocks.
Discuss how SSC’s stockholders might view each of these actions and how the actions might affect
the stock price.
1-10
Investors generally can make one vote for each share of stock they hold. TIAA-CREF is the largest
institutional shareholder in the United States; therefore, it holds many shares and has more votes
than any other organization. Traditionally, this fund has acted as a passive investor, just going
along with management. However, in 1993, it mailed a notice to all 1,500 companies whose stocks
it held that henceforth, it planned to actively intervene if, in its opinion, management was not
performing well. Its goal was to improve corporate performance to boost the prices of the stocks it
held. It also wanted to encourage corporate boards to appoint a majority of independent (outside)
directors; and it stated that it would vote against any directors of firms that “don’t have an
effective, independent board that can challenge the CEO.”
In the past, TIAA-CREF responded to poor performance by “voting with its feet,” which
means selling stocks that were not doing well. However, by 1993, that position had become
difficult to maintain for two reasons. First, the fund invested a large part of its assets in “index
funds,” which hold stocks in accordance with their percentage value in the broad stock market.
Furthermore, TIAA-CREF owns such large blocks of stocks in many companies that if it tried to
sell out, doing so would severely depress the prices of those stocks. Thus, TIAA-CREF is locked in
to a large extent, which led to its decision to become a more active investor.
a.
Is TIAA-CREF an ordinary shareholder? Explain.
b.
Due to its asset size, TIAA-CREF owns many shares in a number of companies. The
fund’s management plans to vote those shares. However, TIAA-CREF is owned by many
thousands of investors. Should the fund’s managers vote its shares; or should it pass those
votes, on a pro rata basis, back to its own shareholders? Explain.
1-11
Edmund Enterprises recently made a large investment to upgrade its technology. While these
improvements won’t have much effect on performance in the short run, they are expected to
reduce future costs significantly. What effect will this investment have on Edmund Enterprises’
earnings per share this year? What effect might this investment have on the company’s intrinsic
value and stock price?

Suppose you were a member of Company X’s board of directors and chairperson of the com-
pany’s compensation committee. What factors should your committee consider when setting the
CEO’s compensation? Should the compensation consist of a dollar salary, stock options that
depend on the firm’s performance, or a mix of the two? If “performance” is to be considered,
how should it be measured? Think of both theoretical and practical (that is, measurement)
considerations. If you were also a vice president of Company X, might your actions be different
than if you were the CEO of some other company?
1-13
Suppose you are a director of an energy company that has three divisions—natural gas, oil, and
retail (gas stations). These divisions operate independently from one another, but all division
managers report to the firm’s CEO. If you were on the compensation committee as discussed
in Question 1-12 and your committee was asked to set the compensation for the three
division managers, would you use the same criteria as that used for the firm’s CEO? Explain
your reasoning.

Bedrock Company has $70 million in debt and $30 million in equity. The debt matures in one year
and has a 10% interest rate, so the company is promising to pay back $77 million to its debtholders
one year from now.
The company is considering two possible investments, each of which will require an upfront
cost of $100 million. Each investment will last for one year and the payoff from each investment
depends on the strength of the overall economy. There is a 50% chance that the economy will be
weak and a 50% chance it will be strong.
Here are the expected payoffs (all dollars are in millions) from the two investments:
Note that the two projects have the same expected payoff, but Project H has higher risk. The
debtholders always get paid first and the stockholders receive any money that is available after
the debtholders have been paid.
Assume that if the company doesn’t have enough funds to pay off its debtholders one year
from now, then Bedrock will declare bankruptcy. If bankruptcy is declared, the debtholders will
receive all available funds and the stockholders will receive nothing.
a.
Assume that the company selects Investment L. What is the expected payoff to the firm’s
debtholders? What is the expected payoff to the firm’s stockholders?
b.
Assume that the company selects Investment H. What is the expected payoff to the firm’s
debtholders? What is the expected payoff to the firm’s stockholders?
c.
Would the debtholders prefer that the company’s managers select Project L or Project H?
Briefly explain your reason.
d.
Explain why the company’s managers acting on behalf of the stockholders might select
Project H even though it has greater risk.
e.
What actions can debtholders take to protect their interests?
Payoff in One Year If the
Economy Is Weak

Economy Is Strong

Rebuilding the Financial System after the Crisis
History shows that a strong financial system is a
necessary ingredient for a growing and prosper-
ous economy. Companies raising capital to
finance capital expenditures and investors saving
to accumulate funds for future use require well-
functioning financial markets and institutions.
Over the past few decades, changing tech-
nology and improving communications have
increased
cross-border
transactions
and
ex-
panded the scope and efficiency of the global
financial system. Companies routinely raise funds
throughout the world to finance projects all
around the globe. Likewise, with the click of a
mouse an individual investor in Pittsburgh can
deposit funds in a European bank or purchase a
mutual fund that invests in Chinese securities.
These innovations helped spur global eco-
nomic growth by providing capital to an
increasing number of individuals throughout
the world. Along the way, the financial industry
attracted a lot of talented people who created,
marketed, and traded a large number of new
financial products. However, despite their bene-
fits many of these same factors led to excesses
which culminated in the recent financial crisis.
While the early stage of the crisis occurred in
2007, it became front and center in 2008. Losses
from its investments in securities backed by sub-
prime mortgages led to the collapse of Bear
Stearns in March 2008. A continued free fall in
the housing market destroyed the value of
many leading financial institutions and created
a panic among many other firms that were
connected to these institutions. By the end of
2008, a number of leading financial institutions
including Lehman Brothers, AIG, Merrill Lynch,
Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Fannie Mae, and
Freddie Mac either failed, reorganized, or were
forced to sell to other institutions at fire sale
prices (often with government assistance).
At the height of the crisis, many were wor-
ried that the entire financial system could

collapse, and in response regulators took emergency steps.
Most notably through its Troubled Asset Relief Program
(TARP), the U.S. government allocated a staggering $700
billion to purchase or insure the troubled assets of many of
the surviving institutions. During this time period, the once
well-functioning financial system suddenly became “frozen”
as investors and financial institutions were unwilling or unable
to provide funds to individual and corporate borrowers—
even those with the highest credit rating. Waiting for the
panic to subside, many of these investors put all of their
money in cash and Treasury securities.
In the aftermath of the crisis, the financial sector is slowly
recovering, but its effects continue. In many ways, the finan-
cial crisis dramatically illustrates that financial managers and
investors don’t operate in a vacuum—they make decisions
within a large and complex financial environment. This envi-
ronment includes financial markets and institutions, tax and
regulatory policies, and the state of the economy. The envi-
ronment both determines the available financial alternatives
and affects the outcome of various decisions. Thus, it is crucial
that investors and financial managers have a good under-
standing of the environment in which they operate.
In Chapter 1, we saw that a firm’s primary goal is to maximize its stock price. Stock
prices are determined in the financial markets; so if financial managers are to make
good decisions, they must understand how these markets operate. In addition,
individuals make personal investment decisions; so they too need to know some-
thing about financial markets and the institutions that operate in those markets.
Therefore, in this chapter, we describe the markets where capital is raised, secu-
rities are traded, and stock prices are established and the institutions that operate
in these markets. We will also discuss the concept of market efficiency, and
demonstrate how efficient markets help promote the effective allocation of capital.
In recent years, the dramatic price swings in the financial markets that have
become increasingly common have led many to question whether markets are
always efficient. In response, there has been increased interest in behavioral
finance theory. This theory focuses on how psychological factors influence indivi-
dual decisions (sometimes in perverse ways), and the resulting impact these
decisions have on financial markets.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Identify the different types of financial markets and financial institutions, and
explain how these markets and institutions enhance capital allocation.
•
Explain how the stock market operates, and list the distinctions between the
different types of stock markets.
•
Explain how the stock market has performed in recent years.
•
Discuss the importance of market efficiency, and explain why some markets
are more efficient than others.
•
Develop a simple understanding of behavioral finance.
2-1 THE CAPITAL ALLOCATION PROCESS
Businesses, individuals, and governments often need to raise capital. For example,
Carolina Power & Light Energy (CP&L) forecasts an increase in the demand for
electricity in North and South Carolina, so it will build a new power plant to meet
those needs. Because CP&L’s bank account does not contain the $1 billion

necessary to pay for the plant, the company must raise this capital in the financial
markets. Similarly, the proprietor of a San Francisco hardware store, wants to
expand into appliances. Where will he get the money to buy the initial inventory of
TV sets, washers, and freezers? Or suppose the Johnson family wants to buy a home
that costs $200,000, but they have only $50,000 in savings. Where will they obtain
the additional $150,000? The city of New York needs $200 million to build a new
sewer plant. Where can it obtain this money? Finally, the federal government needs
more money than it receives from taxes. Where will the extra money come from?
On the other hand, some individuals and firms have incomes that exceed their
current expenditures, in which case they have funds available to invest. For
example, Carol Hawk has an income of $36,000, but her expenses are only
$30,000. That leaves her with $6,000 to invest. Similarly, Microsoft has accumu-
lated roughly $68.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. What can Microsoft
do with this money until it is needed in the business?
People and organizations with surplus funds are saving today in order to
accumulate funds for some future use. Members of a household might save to pay
for their children’s education and the parents’ retirement, while a business might
save to fund future investments. Those with surplus funds expect to earn a return
on their investments, while people and organizations that need capital understand
that they must pay interest to those who provide that capital.
In a well-functioning economy, capital flows efficiently from those with sur-
plus capital to those who need it. This transfer can take place in the three ways
described in Figure 2.1.
1.
Direct transfers of money and securities, as shown in the top section, occur
when a business sells its stocks or bonds directly to savers, without going
through any type of financial institution. The business delivers its securities to
savers, who, in turn, give the firm the money it needs. This procedure is used
mainly by small firms, and relatively little capital is raised by direct transfers.
2.
As shown in the middle section, transfers may also go through an investment
bank (iBank) such as Morgan Stanley, which underwrites the issue. An
underwriter facilitates the issuance of securities. The company sells its stocks

or bonds to the investment bank, which then sells these same securities to
savers. The businesses’ securities and the savers’ money merely “pass
through” the investment bank. However, because the investment bank buys
and holds the securities for a period of time, it is taking a risk—it may not be
able to resell the securities to savers for as much as it paid. Because new
securities are involved and the corporation receives the sale proceeds, this
transaction is called a primary market transaction.
3.
Transfers can also be made through a financial intermediary such as a bank, an
insurance company, or a mutual fund. Here the intermediary obtains funds
from savers in exchange for its securities. The intermediary uses this money to
buy and hold businesses’ securities, while the savers hold the intermediary’s
securities. For example, a saver deposits dollars in a bank, receiving a
certificate of deposit; then the bank lends the money to a business in the
form of a mortgage loan. Thus, intermediaries literally create new forms of
capital—in this case, certificates of deposit, which are safer and more liquid
than mortgages and thus better for most savers to hold. The existence of
intermediaries greatly increases the efficiency of money and capital markets.
Often the entity needing capital is a business (and specifically a corporation);
but it is easy to visualize the demander of capital being a home purchaser, a small
business, or a government unit. For example, if your uncle lends you money to
fund a new business, a direct transfer of funds will occur. Alternatively, if you
borrow money to purchase a home, you will probably raise the funds through a
financial intermediary such as your local commercial bank or mortgage banker.
That banker could sell your mortgage to an investment bank, which then might
use it as collateral for a bond that is purchased by a pension fund.
In a global context, economic development is highly correlated with the level
and efficiency of financial markets and institutions.1 It is difficult, if not impossible,
for an economy to reach its full potential if it doesn’t have access to a well-
functioning financial system. In a well-developed economy like that of the United
States, an extensive set of markets and institutions has evolved over time to facilitate
the efficient allocation of capital. To raise capital efficiently, managers must under-
stand how these markets and institutions work; and individuals need to know how
the markets and institutions work to earn high rates of returns on their savings.
2-2 FINANCIAL MARKETS
People and organizations wanting to borrow money are brought together with those
who have surplus funds in the financial markets. Note that markets is plural; there are
many different financial markets in a developed economy such as that of the United
States. We describe some of these markets and some trends in their development.

Name three ways capital is transferred between savers and borrowers.
Why are efficient capital markets necessary for economic growth?

2-2A TYPES OF MARKETS
Different financial markets serve different types of customers or different parts of
the country. Financial markets also vary depending on the maturity of the secu-
rities being traded and the types of assets used to back the securities. For these
reasons, it is useful to classify markets along the following dimensions:
1.
Physical asset markets versus financial asset markets. Physical asset markets (also
called “tangible” or “real” asset markets) are for products such as wheat,
autos, real estate, computers, and machinery. Financial asset markets, on the
other hand, deal with stocks, bonds, notes, and mortgages. Financial markets
also deal with derivative securities whose values are derived from changes in the
prices of other assets. A share of Ford stock is a “pure financial asset,” while
an option to buy Ford shares is a derivative security whose value depends on
the price of Ford stock.
2.
Spot markets versus futures markets. Spot markets are markets in which assets
are bought or sold for “on-the-spot” delivery (literally, within a few days).
Futures markets are markets in which participants agree today to buy or sell
an asset at some future date. For example, a farmer may enter into a futures
contract in which he agrees today to sell 5,000 bushels of soybeans 6 months
from now at a price of $13.75 a bushel. To continue that example, a food
processor that needs soybeans in the future may enter into a futures contract
in which it agrees to buy soybeans 6 months from now. Such a transaction can
reduce, or hedge, the risks faced by both the farmer and the food processor.
3.
Money markets versus capital markets. Money markets are the markets for short-
term, highly liquid debt securities. The New York, London, and Tokyo money
markets are among the world’s largest. Capital markets are the markets for
intermediate- or long-term debt and corporate stocks. The New York Stock
Exchange, where the stocks of the largest U.S. corporations are traded, is a
prime example of a capital market. There is no hard-and-fast rule, but in a
description of debt markets, short-term generally means less than 1 year,
intermediate-term means 1 to 10 years, and long-term means more than 10 years.
4.
Primary markets versus secondary markets. Primary markets are the markets in
which corporations raise new capital. If GE were to sell a new issue of
common stock to raise capital, a primary market transaction would take
place. The corporation selling the newly created stock, GE, receives the
proceeds from the sale in a primary market transaction. Secondary markets
are markets in which existing, already outstanding securities are traded
among investors. Thus, if Jane Doe decided to buy 1,000 shares of GE stock,
the purchase would occur in the secondary market. The New York Stock
Exchange is a secondary market because it deals in outstanding, as opposed
to newly issued, stocks and bonds. Secondary markets also exist for
mortgages, other types of loans, and other financial assets. The corporation
whose securities are being traded is not involved in a secondary market
transaction and thus does not receive funds from such a sale.
5.
Private markets versus public markets. Private markets, where transactions are
negotiated directly between two parties, are differentiated from public
markets, where standardized contracts are traded on organized exchanges.
Bank loans and private debt placements with insurance companies are
examples of private market transactions. Because these transactions are
private, they may be structured in any manner to which the two parties
agree. By contrast, securities that are traded in public markets (for example,
common stock and corporate bonds) are held by a large number of
individuals. These securities must have fairly standardized contractual

features because public investors do not generally have the time and expertise
to negotiate unique, nonstandardized contracts. Broad ownership and
standardization result in publicly traded securities being more liquid than
tailor-made, uniquely negotiated securities.
Other classifications could be made, but this breakdown shows that there are
many types of financial markets. Also note that the distinctions among markets
are often blurred and unimportant except as a general point of reference. For
example, it makes little difference if a firm borrows for 11, 12, or 13 months, that
is, whether the transaction is a “money” or “capital” market transaction. You
should be aware of the important differences among types of markets, but don’t
be overly concerned about trying to distinguish them at the boundaries.
A healthy economy is dependent on efficient funds transfers from people who
are net savers to firms and individuals who need capital. Without efficient trans-
fers, the economy could not function: Carolina Power & Light Energy could not
raise capital, so Raleigh’s citizens would have no electricity; the Johnson family
would not have adequate housing; Carol Hawk would have no place to invest her
savings; and so forth. Obviously, the level of employment and productivity (i.e.,
the standard of living) would be much lower. Therefore, it is essential that
financial markets function efficiently—not only quickly, but also inexpensively.
Table 2.1 is a listing of the most important instruments traded in the various
financial markets. The instruments are arranged in ascending order of typical
length of maturity. As we go through this book, we will look in more detail at
many of the instruments listed in Table 2.1. For example, we will see that there are
many varieties of corporate bonds, ranging from “plain vanilla” bonds to bonds
that can be converted to common stocks to bonds whose interest payments vary
depending on the inflation rate. Still, the table provides an overview of the
characteristics and costs of the instruments traded in the major financial markets.
2-2B RECENT TRENDS
Financial markets have experienced many changes in recent years. Technological
advances in computers and telecommunications, along with the globalization of
banking and commerce, have led to deregulation, which has increased competi-
tion throughout the world. As a result, there are more efficient, internationally
linked markets, which are far more complex than what existed a few years ago.
While these developments have been largely positive, they have also created
problems for policy makers. With these concerns in mind, Congress and regula-
tors have moved to reregulate parts of the financial sector following the recent
financial crisis.
Globalization has exposed the need for greater cooperation among regulators
at the international level, but the task is not easy. Factors that complicate coordi-
nation include (1) the different structures in nations’ banking and securities
industries; (2) the trend toward financial services conglomerates, which obscures
developments in various market segments; and (3) the reluctance of individual
countries to give up control over their national monetary policies. Still, regulators
are unanimous about the need to close the gaps in the supervision of worldwide
markets.
Another important trend in recent years has been the increased use of deri-
vatives. A derivative is any security whose value is derived from the price of some
other “underlying” asset. An option to buy IBM stock is a derivative, as is a
contract to buy Japanese yen 6 months from now. The value of the IBM option
depends on the price of IBM’s stock and the value of the Japanese yen “future”
depends on the exchange rate between yen and dollars. The market for derivatives
has grown faster than any other market in recent years, providing investors with
new opportunities, but also exposing them to new risks.

To illustrate the growing importance of derivatives, consider the case of credit
default swaps.2 Credit default swaps are contracts that offer protection against the
default of a particular security. Suppose a bank wants to protect itself against the
default of one of its borrowers. The bank could enter into a credit default swap
where it agrees to make regular payments to another financial institution. In
return, that financial institution agrees to insure the bank against losses that
would occur if the borrower defaulted.
Derivatives can be used to reduce risks or to speculate. Suppose a wheat
processor’s costs rise and its net income falls when the price of wheat rises. The
processor could reduce its risk by purchasing derivatives—wheat futures—whose
value increases when the price of wheat rises. This is a hedging operation, and its
purpose is to reduce risk exposure. Speculation, on the other hand, is done in the
hope of high returns; but it raises risk exposure. For example, several years ago
Procter & Gamble disclosed that it lost $150 million on derivative investments.
More recently, losses on mortgage-related derivatives helped contribute to the
credit collapse in 2008.
If a bank or any other company reports that it invests in derivatives, how
can one tell if the derivatives are held as a hedge against something like an
increase in the price of wheat or as a speculative bet that wheat prices will
rise? The answer is that it is very difficult to tell how derivatives are affecting
the firm’s risk profile. In the case of financial institutions, things are even
more complicated—the derivatives are generally based on changes in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, or stock prices; and a large international bank
might have tens of thousands of separate derivative contracts. The size and
complexity of these transactions concern regulators, academics, and members
of Congress. Former Fed Chairperson Alan Greenspan noted that in theory,
derivatives should allow companies to better manage risk, but that it is not
clear whether recent innovations have “increased or decreased the inherent
stability of the financial system.”
2-3 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Direct funds transfers are common among individuals and small businesses
and in economies where financial markets and institutions are less devel-
oped. But large businesses in developed economies generally find it more
efficient to enlist the services of a financial institution when it comes time to
raise capital.

In the United States and other developed nations, a set of highly efficient
financial intermediaries has evolved. Their original roles were generally quite
specific, and regulation prevented them from diversifying. However, in recent
years regulations against diversification have been largely removed; and today
the differences between institutions have become blurred. Still, there remains a
degree of institutional identity. Therefore, it is useful to understand the major
categories of financial institutions. Keep in mind, though, that one company
can own a number of subsidiaries that engage in the different functions
described next.
1.
Investment banks traditionally help companies raise capital. They (1) help
corporations design securities with features that are currently attractive to
investors, (2) buy these securities from the corporation, and (3) resell
them to savers. Because the investment bank generally guarantees that
the firm will raise the needed capital, the investment bankers are also
called underwriters.The recent credit crisis has had a dramatic effect on
the investment banking industry. Bear Stearns collapsed and was later
acquired
by
J.P.
Morgan,
Lehman
Brothers
went
bankrupt,
and
Merrill Lynch was forced to sell out to Bank of America. The two
“surviving” major investment banks (Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs) received
Federal Reserve approval to become commercial bank
holding companies.
2.
Commercial banks, such as Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and
JPMorgan Chase, are the traditional “department stores of finance” because
they serve a variety of savers and borrowers. Historically, commercial banks
were the major institutions that handled checking accounts and through
which the Federal Reserve System expanded or contracted the money
supply. Today, however, several other institutions also provide checking
services and significantly influence the money supply. Note, too, that the
larger
banks
are
generally
part
of
financial
services
corporations
as
described next.3
3.
Financial services corporations are large conglomerates that combine many
different financial institutions within a single corporation. Most financial
services corporations started in one area but have now diversified to cover
most of the financial spectrum. For example, Citigroup owns Citibank
(a commercial bank), an investment bank, a securities brokerage organization,
insurance companies, and leasing companies.
4.
Credit unions are cooperative associations whose members are supposed to
have a common bond, such as being employees of the same firm. Members’
savings are loaned only to other members, generally for auto purchases, home
improvement loans, and home mortgages. Credit unions are often the
cheapest source of funds available to individual borrowers.
5.
Pension funds are retirement plans funded by corporations or government
agencies
for
their
workers
and
administered
primarily
by
the
trust
departments of commercial banks or by life insurance companies. Pension
funds invest primarily in bonds, stocks, mortgages, and real estate.
6.
Life insurance companies take savings in the form of annual premiums; invest
these funds in stocks, bonds, real estate, and mortgages; and make payments
3Two other institutions that were important a few years ago were savings and loan associations
and mutual savings banks. Most of these organizations have now been merged into commercial
banks.
Investment Bank
An organization that
underwrites and
distributes new
investment securities and
helps businesses obtain
financing.
Commercial Bank
The traditional
department store of
finance serving a variety
of savers and borrowers.
Financial Services
Corporations
A firm that offers a wide
range of financial services,
including investment
banking, brokerage
operations, insurance,
and commercial banking.

to the beneficiaries of the insured parties. In recent years, life insurance
companies have also offered a variety of tax-deferred savings plans designed
to provide benefits to participants when they retire.
7.
Mutual funds are corporations that accept money from savers and then use
these funds to buy stocks, long-term bonds, or short-term debt instruments
issued by businesses or government units. These organizations pool funds and
thus reduce risks by diversification. They also achieve economies of scale in
analyzing securities, managing portfolios, and buying and selling securities.
Different funds are designed to meet the objectives of different types of savers.
Hence, there are bond funds for those who prefer safety, stock funds for savers
who are willing to accept significant risks in the hope of higher returns, and
money market funds that are used as interest-bearing checking accounts.
Another important distinction exists between actively managed funds and
indexed funds. Actively managed funds try to outperform the overall markets,
whereas indexed funds are designed to simply replicate the performance of a
specific market index. For example, the portfolio manager of an actively
managed stock fund uses his or her expertise to select what he or she thinks
will be the best-performing stocks over a given time period. By contrast, an index
fund that tracks the S&P 500 index will simply hold the basket of stocks that
comprise the S&P 500. Both types of funds provide investors with valuable
diversification, but actively managed funds typically have much higher fees—
in large part, because of the extra costs involved in trying to select stocks that will
(hopefully) outperform the market. In any given year, the very best actively
managed funds will outperform the market index, but many will do worse than
the overall market—even before taking into account their higher fees.
Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to predict which actively managed funds
will beat the market in a particular year. For this reason, many academics and
practitioners have encouraged investors to rely more heavily on indexed funds.4
There are literally thousands of different mutual funds with dozens of dif-
ferent goals and purposes. Excellent information on the objectives and past
performances of the various funds are provided in publications such as Value
Line Investment Survey and Morningstar Mutual Funds, which are available in
most libraries and on the Internet.
8.
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are similar to regular mutual funds and are
often operated by mutual fund companies. ETFs buy a portfolio of stocks of a
certain type—for example, the S&P 500 or media companies or Chinese
companies—and then sell their own shares to the public. ETF shares are
generally traded in the public markets, so an investor who wants to invest
in the Chinese market, for example, can buy shares in an ETF that holds stocks
in that particular market.
9.
Hedge funds are also similar to mutual funds because they accept money from
savers and use the funds to buy various securities, but there are some
important differences. While mutual funds (and ETFs) are registered and
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), hedge funds
are largely unregulated. This difference in regulation stems from the fact that
mutual funds typically target small investors, whereas hedge funds typically
have large minimum investments (often exceeding $1 million) and are
marketed primarily to institutions and individuals with high net worths.
Hedge funds received their name because they traditionally were used when
an individual was trying to hedge risks. For example, a hedge fund manager
4Refer to Mark Hulbert, “The Index Funds Win Again,” The New York Times (www.nytimes.com),
February 21, 2009; and Rick Ferri, “Index Fund Portfolios Reign Superior,” Forbes (www.forbes.com),
August 20, 2012.
Mutual Funds
Organizations that pool
investor funds to purchase
financial instruments and
thus reduce risks through
diversification.
Money Market Funds
Mutual funds that invest
in short-term, low-risk
securities and allow
investors to write checks
against their accounts.

who believes that interest rate differentials between corporate and Treasury
bonds are too large might simultaneously buy a portfolio of corporate bonds
and sell a portfolio of Treasury bonds. In this case, the portfolio would be
“hedged” against overall movements in interest rates, but it would perform
especially well if the spread between these securities became smaller.
However, some hedge funds take on risks that are considerably higher
than that of an average individual stock or mutual fund. For example, in
1998, Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a high-profile hedge fund
(whose managers included several well-respected practitioners as well as
two Nobel Prize–winning professors who were experts in investment
theory), made some incorrect assumptions and “blew up.”5 LTCM had
many billions of dollars under management, and it owed large amounts of
money to a number of banks. To avert a worldwide crisis, the Federal
Reserve orchestrated a buyout of the firm with a group of New York banks.
Table 2.2 lists the 10 largest hedge funds as of January 2, 2013. As
evidence of their growing importance, each of these funds controls more
than $20 billion in assets. As hedge funds have become more popular, many
of them have begun to lower their minimum investment requirements.
Perhaps not surprisingly, their rapid growth and shift toward smaller
investors have also led to a call for more regulation.
10.
Private equity companies are organizations that operate much like hedge funds;
but rather than purchasing some of the stock of a firm, private equity players
buy and then manage entire firms. Most of the money used to buy the target
companies is borrowed. While private equity activity slowed around the
financial crisis, over the past decade a number of high-profile companies
(including Harrah’s Entertainment, Albertson’s, Neiman Marcus, and Clear
Channel) have been acquired by private equity firms. More recently in 2013,
two major deals were announced. Berkshire Hathaway (and its chairman
Warren Buffett) partnered with the private equity firm 3G Capital to acquire
H.J. Heinz Co. on June 7, 2013 for $28 billion. Around the same time, Dell
Computer announced plans to go private with the assistance of the private
equity firm, Silver Lake Partners. Some have criticized this deal for not offering
enough payment to the existing shareholders, and there is a possibility that
another private equity firm or outside investor will make a competing offer.6
Other leading private equity firms include The Carlyle Group, Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, and The Blackstone Group.
With the exception of hedge funds and private equity companies, financial
institutions are regulated to ensure the safety of these institutions and to protect
investors. Historically, many of these regulations—which have included a prohi-
bition on nationwide branch banking, restrictions on the types of assets the
institutions could purchase, ceilings on the interest rates they could pay, and
limitations on the types of services they could provide—tended to impede the
free flow of capital and thus hurt the efficiency of the capital markets. Recognizing
this fact, policy makers took several steps during the 1980s and 1990s to dereg-
ulate financial services companies. For example, the restriction barring nationwide
branching by banks was eliminated in 1999.
5See Franklin Edwards, “Hedge Funds and the Collapse of Long-Term Capital Management,” Journal
of Economic Perspectives, vol. 13, no. 2 (Spring 1999), pp. 189–210, for a thoughtful review of the
implications of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management.
6In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn (a well known activist investor) announced
separate plans to acquire Dell. Blackstone has since dropped out, and Michael Dell and Silver Lake
have offered shareholders a total deal worth $24.75 billion. The shareholder vote is scheduled for
September 12, 2013. For additional information, refer to David Benoit, Kirsten Grind, and Sharon
Terlep, “Dell Reaches New Deal With Founder,” The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com), August 2,
2013.

Many believed that excessive deregulation and insufficient supervision of the
financial sector was partially responsible for the recent financial crisis. With these
concerns in mind, Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Act. The legislation’s main
goals are to create a new agency for consumer protection, work to increase the
transparency of derivative transactions, and force financial institutions to take
steps to limit excessive risk-taking and to hold more capital.

What’s the difference between a commercial bank and an investment bank?
List the major types of financial institutions and briefly describe the primary
function of each.
What are some important differences between mutual funds, Exchange Traded
Funds, and hedge funds? How are they similar?
SECURITIZATION HAS DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMED THE BANKING INDUSTRY
At one time, commercial banking was a simpler business
than it is today. A typical bank received money from its
depositors and used it to make loans. In the vast majority
of cases, the banker held the loan on its books until it
matured. Because they originated the loan and continued
to hold it on their books, the banks generally knew the risks
involved. However, because banks often had limited fund-
ing, there was a cap on the number of loans they could hold
on their books. And because most of the loans were made
to individuals and businesses in their local market, banks
were less able to spread their risk.
To address these concerns, financial engineers came up
with the idea of securitizing loans. This is a process whereby
an agent (such as an investment bank) creates an entity that
buys a large number of loans from a wide range of banks
and then issues securities that are backed by the loan pay-
ments. Securitization began in the 1970s when government-
backed entities purchased pools of home mortgages and
then issued securities backed by the cash flows from the
diversified portfolio of mortgages. In many respects, secu-
ritization was a tremendous innovation. Banks no longer had
to hold their mortgages, so they could quickly convert the
originated loan to cash, enabling them to redeploy their
capital to make other loans. At the same time, the newly
created securities gave investors an opportunity to invest in
a diversified portfolio of home mortgages. In addition, these
securities traded on the open market so that investors were
able to easily buy and sell them as their circumstances and
views of the mortgage markets changed over time.
Over the last few decades, this process has accelerated.
Bankers have securitized different types of loans into all
types of different securities. One notable example is collater-
alized debt obligations (CDOs), where an entity issues several
classes of securities backed by a portfolio of loans. For
example, an investment bank purchases $100 million of
mortgage loans from banks and mortgage brokers through-
out the country. The investment bank uses the collateral to
create $100 million in new securities, which are divided into
three classes (often referred to as tranches). The Class A
bonds have the first claim on the cash flows from the
mortgages. Because they have the first claim, they are
the least risky and are rated AAA by the rating agencies.
The Class B bonds get paid after the Class A bonds are paid,
but they too will generally have a high rating. Finally, the
Class C bonds get paid. Because they are last in line, they will
have the highest risk, but they will also sell for the lowest
price. If the underlying mortgages perform well, the C bonds
will realize the highest returns, but they will suffer the most
if the underlying mortgages don’t perform well.
CDOs backed by pools of higher risk (subprime) mort-
gages played a major role in the recent financial crisis.
During the housing boom, financial institutions and mort-
gage brokers originated a large number of new mortgages,
and investment bankers hungry for fees were more than
happy to create new CDOs backed by these subprime mort-
gages. The securities created through these CDOs were sold
primarily to other commercial and investment banks and to
other financial institutions, such as hedge funds, mutual
funds, and pension funds. Buoyed by the mistaken belief
that housing prices would never fall, many viewed these
securities as solid investments, and they received additional
comfort from the fact that they were highly rated.
When the housing market collapsed, the value of these
securities plummeted, destroying the balance sheets of
many financial institutions. Making matters worse, it became
very hard to value these securities because they were
backed by such a large, diverse pool of mortgages. Not sure
what they had on their books, many institutions tried to sell
these securities at the same time, and the “rush to the exit”
further depressed prices causing the cycle to deepen.
Following the crisis, many have looked to reform the
securitization business, and others have criticized the rating
agencies for routinely assigning high credit ratings to what
in hindsight were extremely risky securities. At the same
time, an article in Barron’s highlights the important role
that securitization plays in the capital markets and raises
concerns that the economy won’t thrive again until the
securitization business recovers.

2-4 THE STOCK MARKET
As noted earlier, outstanding, previously issued securities are traded in the
secondary markets. By far, the most active secondary market—and the most
important one to financial managers—is the stock market, where the prices of firms’
stocks are established. Because the primary goal of financial managers is to
maximize their firms’ stock prices, knowledge of the stock market is important
to anyone involved in managing a business.
There are a number of different stock markets. The two leaders are NYSE
Euronext and NASDAQ. NYSE Euronext was formed through the 2007 merger of
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Euronext, which at the time was the
largest European exchange. Stocks are traded using a variety of market proce-
dures, but there are two basic types: (1) physical location exchanges, which include
the NYSE and several regional stock exchanges, and (2) electronic dealer-based
markets, which include the NASDAQ, the less formal over-the-counter market,
and the recently developed electronic communications networks (ECNs).
(See the box entitled, “The NYSE and NASDAQ Go Global.”) Because the
physical location exchanges are easier to describe and understand, we discuss
them first.
2-4A PHYSICAL LOCATION STOCK EXCHANGES
Physical location exchanges are tangible entities. Each of the larger exchanges
occupies its own building, allows a limited number of people to trade on its floor,
and has an elected governing body—its board of governors. Members of the
NYSE formerly had “seats” on the exchange, although everybody stood. Today
the seats have been exchanged for trading licenses, which are auctioned to mem-
ber organizations and cost about $50,000 per year. Most of the larger investment
banks operate brokerage departments. They purchase seats on the exchanges and
The NYSE and NASDAQ Go Global
Advances in computers and telecommunications that spurred
consolidation in the financial services industry have also pro-
moted online trading systems that bypass the traditional
exchanges. These systems, which are known as electronic com-
munications networks (ECNs), use electronic technology to bring
buyers and sellers together. The rise of ECNs accelerated the
move toward 24-hour trading. U.S. investors who wanted to trade
after the U.S. markets closed could utilize an ECN, thus bypassing
the NYSE and NASDAQ.
Recognizing the new threat, the NYSE and NASDAQ took
action. First, both exchanges went public, which enabled
them to use their stock as “currency” that could be used to
buy ECNs and other exchanges across the globe. For example,
NASDAQ acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, several
ECNs, and 25% of the London Stock Exchange; and it
is actively seeking to merge with other exchanges around
the world. The NYSE took similar actions, including a merger
with the largest European exchange, Euronext, to form NYSE
Euronext and then acquiring the American Stock Exchange
(AMEX).
Interestingly enough, on December 20, 2012, Intercontinental
Exchange (ICE) announced plans to purchase NYSE Euronext for
approximately $8.2 billion. In addition, it appears that Euronext
may be spun off if the deal is completed. Of course, the sale will
need to be approved by regulators. However, if it does go
through, it will merge ICE’s futures, over-the-counter, and deriva-
tives trading with the NYSE’s stock trading.
These actions illustrate the growing importance of global trad-
ing, especially electronic trading. Indeed, many pundits have
concluded that the floor traders who buy and sell stocks on the
NYSE and other physical exchanges will soon become a thing of
the past. That may or may not be true, but it is clear that stock
trading will continue to undergo dramatic changes in the upcom-
ing years. To find a wealth of up-to-date information on the NYSE
and NASDAQ, go to Google (or another search engine) and do
NYSE history and NASDAQ history searches.

designate one or more of their officers as members. The exchanges are open on all
normal working days, with the members meeting in a large room equipped with
telephones and other electronic equipment that enable each member to commu-
nicate with his or her firm’s offices throughout the country.
Like other markets, security exchanges facilitate communication between
buyers and sellers. For example, Goldman Sachs (the seventh-largest brokerage
firm) might receive an order from a customer who wants to buy shares of GE stock.
Simultaneously, Morgan Stanley (the sixth-largest brokerage firm) might receive an
order from a customer wanting to sell shares of GE. Each broker communicates
electronically with the firm’s representative on the NYSE. Other brokers throughout
the country are also communicating with their own exchange members. The
exchange members with sell orders offer the shares for sale, and they are bid for
by the members with buy orders. Thus, the exchanges operate as auction markets.7
2-4B OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) AND THE NASDAQ
STOCK MARKETS
While the stocks of most large companies trade on the NYSE, a larger number of
stocks trade off the exchange in what was traditionally referred to as the over-the-
counter (OTC) market. An explanation of the term over-the-counter will help
clarify how this term arose. As noted earlier, the exchanges operate as auction
markets—buy and sell orders come in more or less simultaneously, and exchange
members match these orders. When a stock is traded infrequently, perhaps
because the firm is new or small, few buy and sell orders come in and matching
them within a reasonable amount of time is difficult. To avoid this problem, some
brokerage firms maintain an inventory of such stocks and stand prepared to make
a market for them. These “dealers” buy when individual investors want to sell,
and they sell part of their inventory when investors want to buy. At one time, the
inventory of securities was kept in a safe; and the stocks, when bought and sold,
were literally passed over the counter.
Today these markets are often referred to as dealer markets. A dealer market
includes all facilities that are needed to conduct security transactions, but the
transactions are not made on the physical location exchanges. The dealer market
system consists of (1) the relatively few dealers who hold inventories of these
securities and who are said to “make a market” in these securities; (2) the thou-
sands of brokers who act as agents in bringing the dealers together with investors;
and (3) the computers, terminals, and electronic networks that provide a commu-
nication link between dealers and brokers. The dealers who make a market in a
7The NYSE is actually a modified auction market wherein people (through their brokers) bid for stocks.
Originally—in 1792—brokers would literally shout, “I have 100 shares of Erie for sale; how much am I
offered?” and then sell to the highest bidder. If a broker had a buy order, he or she would shout, “I
want to buy 100 shares of Erie; who’ll sell at the best price?” The same general situation still exists,
although the exchanges now have members known as specialists who facilitate the trading process by
keeping an inventory of shares of the stocks in which they specialize. If a buy order comes in at a time
when no sell order arrives, the specialist will sell some inventory. Similarly, if a sell order comes in, the
specialist will buy and add to inventory. The specialist sets a bid price (the price the specialist will pay
for the stock) and an ask price (the price at which shares will be sold out of inventory). The bid and ask
prices are set at levels designed to keep the inventory in balance. If many buy orders start coming in
because of favorable developments or many sell orders come in because of unfavorable events, the
specialist will raise or lower prices to keep supply and demand in balance. Bid prices are somewhat
lower than ask prices, with the difference, or spread, representing the specialist’s profit margin.
Special facilities are available to help institutional investors such as mutual or pension funds sell
large blocks of stock without depressing their prices. In essence, brokerage houses that cater to
institutional clients will purchase blocks (defined as 10,000 or more shares) and then resell the stock
to other institutions or individuals. Also, when a firm has a major announcement that is likely to cause
its stock price to change sharply, it will ask the exchange to halt trading in its stock until the
announcement has been made and the resulting information has been digested by investors.

particular stock quote the price at which they will pay for the stock (the bid price)
and the price at which they will sell shares (the ask price). Each dealer’s prices, which
are adjusted as supply and demand conditions change, can be seen on computer
screens across the world. The bid–ask spread, which is the difference between bid and
ask prices, represents the dealer’s markup, or profit. The dealer’s risk increases
when the stock is more volatile or when the stock trades infrequently. Generally, we
would expect volatile, infrequently traded stocks to have wider spreads in order to
compensate the dealers for assuming the risk of holding them in inventory.
Brokers and dealers who participate in the OTC market are members of a self-
regulatory body known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),
which licenses brokers and oversees trading practices. The computerized network
used by FINRA is known as NASDAQ, which originally stood for “National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations.”
NASDAQ started as a quotation system, but it has grown to become an
organized securities market with its own listing requirements. Over the past
decade, the competition between the NYSE and NASDAQ has become increas-
ingly fierce. As noted earlier, the NASDAQ has invested in the London Stock
Exchange and other market makers, while the NYSE merged with Euronext and,
pending regulatory approval, it may soon be purchased by Intercontinental
Exchange—further adding to the competition. Because most of the larger compa-
nies trade on the NYSE, the market capitalization of NYSE-traded stocks is much
higher than for stocks traded on NASDAQ.
Interestingly, many high-tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Intel
have remained on NASDAQ even though they meet the listing requirements of
the NYSE. At the same time, however, other high-tech companies have left
NASDAQ for the NYSE. Despite these defections, NASDAQ’s growth over the
past decade has been impressive. In the years ahead, competition between
NASDAQ and NYSE Euronext will no doubt remain fierce.
2-5 THE MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK
Some companies are so small that their common stocks are not actively traded;
they are owned by relatively few people, usually the companies’ managers. These
firms are said to be privately owned, or closely held, corporations; and their stock
is called closely held stock. In contrast, the stocks of most large companies are
owned by thousands of investors, most of whom are not active in management.
These companies are called publicly owned corporations, and their stock is called
publicly held stock.
2-5A TYPES OF STOCK MARKET TRANSACTIONS
We can classify stock market transactions into three distinct categories:

Outstanding shares of established publicly owned companies that are traded: the
secondary market. Allied Food Products, the company we study in Chapters 3

and 4, has 50 million shares of stock outstanding. If the owner of 100 shares
sells his or her stock, the trade is said to have occurred in the secondary market.
Thus, the market for outstanding shares, or used shares, is the secondary
market. The company receives no new money when sales occur in this market.
2.
Additional shares sold by established publicly owned companies: the primary market.
If Allied Food decides to sell (or issue) an additional 1 million shares to raise
new equity capital, this transaction is said to occur in the primary market.8
3.
Initial public offerings made by privately held firms: the IPO market. Whenever
stock in a closely held corporation is offered to the public for the first time, the
company is said to be going public. The market for stock that is just being
offered to the public is called the initial public offering (IPO) market.9 In the
summer of 2004, Google sold shares to the public for the first time at $85 per
share. By mid-February, 2013, the stock was selling for more than $800. In
2006, McDonald’s owned Chipotle Mexican Grill. McDonald’s then sold its
shares to the public for about $47.50 to raise capital to support its core
business; and by mid-February 2013, Chipotle’s stock price was more than
$300. In some more recent examples, General Motors (GM) went public as part
of its reorganization following its government bailout, and in May 2011, the
professional-networking site LinkedIn Corp. created excitement when shares
of its IPO more than doubled during its first day of trading.
The number of new IPOs rises and falls with the stock market. When the
market is strong, many companies go public to bring in new capital and to give
their founders an opportunity to cash out some of their shares. Table 2.4 lists the
largest, the best performing, and the worst performing IPOs of 2012 and shows
how they performed from their offering dates through year-end 2012. As the table
shows, not all IPOs are as well received as Google, Chipotle, and LinkedIn. The
most striking example is Facebook, which had the largest and highest-profile IPO
of 2012. Amid much fanfare, the company went public on May 18, 2012 at a price
of $38 per share. In the two weeks after the IPO, the stock had fallen to below $28,
and just a few months later in September, the price reached a low of $17.55. By
year-end 2012, the stock rebounded to $26.62, which was still 30% below the initial
offering price. So, while Facebook raised a lot of money through its IPO, its initial
investors did not quickly realize the big return that many were looking to capture.
Moreover, even if you are able to identify a “hot” issue, it is often difficult to
purchase shares in the initial offering. These deals are often oversubscribed, which
means that the demand for shares at the offering price exceeds the number of
shares issued. In such instances, investment bankers favor large institutional
investors (who are their best customers); and small investors find it hard, if not
impossible, to get in on the ground floor. They can buy the stock in the after-
market; but evidence suggests that when an investor does not get in on the ground
floor, over the long run IPOs often underperform the overall market.10
Google’s highly publicized IPO attracted attention because of its size (Google
raised $1.67 billion in stock) and because of the way the sale was conducted.
Rather than having the offer price set by its investment bankers, Google

8Allied has 60 million shares authorized but only 50 million outstanding; thus, it has 10 million
authorized but unissued shares. If it had no authorized but unissued shares, management could
increase the authorized shares by obtaining stockholders’ approval, which would generally be
granted without any arguments.
9A number of years ago Coors, the beer company, offered some of its shares to the public. These shares
were designated Class B, and they were nonvoting. The Coors family retained the founders’ shares,
called Class A stock, which carried full voting privileges. This illustrates how the managers of a
company can use different classes of shares to maintain control.

conducted a Dutch auction, where individual investors placed bids for shares
directly. In a Dutch auction, the actual transaction price is set at the highest price
(the clearing price) that causes all of the offered shares to be sold. Investors who
set their bids at or above the clearing price received all of the shares they
subscribed to at the offer price, which turned out to be $85. While Google’s IPO
was in many ways precedent setting, few companies going public since then have
been willing or able to use the Dutch auction method to allocate their IPO shares.
It is important to recognize that firms can go public without raising any
additional capital. For example, the Ford Motor Company was once owned
exclusively by the Ford family. When Henry Ford died, he left a substantial part
of his stock to the Ford Foundation. When the Foundation later sold some of the
stock to the general public, the Ford Motor Company went public, even though
the company itself raised no capital in the transaction.

generally are) large differences between expected and realized prices and returns.

expected return as estimated by investors at the margin is always positive; other-
wise, investors would not buy the stock. However, as Figure 2.2 shows, in some
years, actual returns are negative.
2-6A STOCK MARKET REPORTING
Up until a few years ago, the best source of stock quotations was the business
section of daily newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal. One problem with
newspapers, however, is that they report yesterday’s prices. Now it is possible to
obtain quotes throughout the day from a wide variety of Internet sources. One of
the best is Yahoo!’s finance.yahoo.com; Figure 2.3 shows a detailed quote for
Facebook, Inc. (FB) stock for February 19, 2013. As the heading shows, Facebook
is traded on the NASDAQGS (GS stands for Global Select Market) under the
symbol FB. The information right below the company name and ticker symbol
shows the real-time quote at 3:03 p.m. EST of $29.03, which is up $0.71 (or 2.51%)
from the previous day’s close. Facebook stock closed on Friday, February 15, 2013,
at $28.32 per share and it opened for trading on Tuesday, February 19, 2013, at
$28.19 per share.11 So far during the day on February 19, 2013, Facebook’s stock
had traded from a low of $28.12 to a high of $29.08 and the price range during the
past 52 weeks was between $17.55 and $45.00. Recall from our earlier discussion
that Facebook went public on Friday, May 18, 2012, at a price of $38 per share, so
the stock had not yet traded for a full year.
The next three lines give the bid (buy) and ask (sell) price range for the stock—
the difference between the two represents the dealer’s spread or profit. (In this
example, a buyer had offered to purchase 4,000 shares at a bid price of $29.03, and
a seller was offering to sell 4,500 shares at an ask price of $29.04.) The 1-year target
estimate represents the median 1-year target price as forecasted by analysts cover-
ing the stock. On February 18, 33,729,430 shares of stock had traded hands. FB’s
average daily trading volume (based on the past 3 months) was 68,521,900

shares, so trading on this day was about half the average daily trading volume.
The total value of all of FB’s stock, called its market cap, was $69.17 billion.
The last three lines report other market information for FB. The beta for the
company is shown as 1.702. The firm’s next earnings announcement is not given.
FB’s P/E ratio (price per share divided by the most recent 12 months’ earnings) is
1,935.93, and its earnings per share for the most recent 12 months was $0.02. (The
high P/E ratio is a direct result of the firm’s low earnings per share number.)
Facebook doesn’t pay a dividend so the dividend and yield information is shown
as NA (not applicable).

2-6B STOCK MARKET RETURNS
In Chapters 8 and 9, we discuss in detail how a stock’s rate of return is calculated,
what the connection is between risk and returns, and what techniques analysts use
to value stocks. However, it is useful at this point to give you an idea of
how stocks have performed in recent years. Figure 2.2 shows how the returns
on large U.S. stocks have varied over the past years, and the box titled “Measuring
the Market” provides information on the major U.S. stock market indices and their
performances since the mid-1990s.
The market trend has been strongly up since 1968, but by no means does it go up
every year. Indeed, as we can see from Figure 2.2, the overall market was down in 10
of the last 45 years, including the three consecutive years of 2000–2002. The stock
prices of individual companies have likewise gone up and down.12Of course, even in
bad years, some individual companies do well; so “the name of the game” in security
analysis is to pick the winners. Financial managers attempt to do this, but they don’t
always succeed. In subsequent chapters, we will examine the decisions managers
make to increase the odds that their firms will perform well in the marketplace.
2-7 STOCK MARKET EFFICIENCY
To begin this section, consider the following definitions:
•
Market price: The current price of a stock. For example, the Internet showed that
on one day, Facebook’s stock traded at $29.03. The market price had varied
from $28.12 to $29.08 during that same day as buy and sell orders came in.
S E L F T E S T
Would you expect a portfolio that consisted of the NYSE stocks to be more or
less risky than a portfolio of NASDAQ stocks?
If we constructed a chart like Figure 2.2 for a typical S&P 500 stock, do you think
it would show more or less volatility? Explain.
12If we constructed a graph like Figure 2.2 for individual stocks rather than for the index, far greater
variability would be shown. Also, if we constructed a graph like Figure 2.2 for bonds, it would have
similar ups and downs, but the bars would be far smaller, indicating that gains and losses on bonds are
generally much smaller than those on stocks. Above-average bond returns occur in years when interest
rates decline, losses occur when interest rates rise sharply, but interest payments tend to stabilize
bonds’ total returns. We discuss bonds in detail in Chapter 7.

MEASURING THE MARKET
Stock market indexes are designed to show the performance
of the stock market. However, there are many stock indexes,
and it is difficult to determine which index best reflects
market actions. Some are designed to represent the entire
stock market, some track the returns of certain industry
sectors, and others track the returns of small-cap, mid-cap,
or large-cap stocks. In addition, there are indexes for differ-
ent countries. We discuss here the three leading U.S. indexes.
These indexes are used as a benchmark for comparing indi-
vidual stocks with the overall market, for measuring the
trend in stock prices over time, and for determining how
various economic factors affect the market.
Dow Jones Industrial Average
Unveiled in 1896 by Charles H. Dow, the Dow Jones Indus-
trial Average (DJIA) began with just 10 stocks, was expanded
in 1916 to 20 stocks, and then was increased to 30 stocks in
1928, when the editors of The Wall Street Journal began
adjusting the index for stock splits and making periodic
substitutions. Today the DJIA still includes 30 companies.
They represent about a fifth of the market value of all U.S.
stocks, and all are leading companies in their industries and
widely held by individual and institutional investors. Visit
djaverages.com to get more information about the DJIA.
You can find out how it is calculated, the companies that
make up the DJIA, and more history about the DJIA. In
addition, a DJIA time line shows various historical events.
S&P 500 Index
Created in 1926, the S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the
standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stock market perfor-
mance. The stocks in the S&P 500 are selected by the Stan-
dard & Poor’s Index Committee, and they are the leading
companies in the leading industries. It is weighted by each
stock’s market value, so the largest companies have the
greatest influence. The S&P 500 is one of the most com-
monly used benchmarks for the U.S. stock market, and
approximately $376 billion is held in index funds designed
to mirror the same performance of the index.
NASDAQ Composite Index
The NASDAQ Composite Index measures the performance of
all stocks listed on the NASDAQ. Currently, it includes
approximately 2,800 companies; and because many compa-
nies in the technology sector are traded on the computer-
based NASDAQ exchange, this index is generally regarded as
an economic indicator of the high-tech industry. Microsoft,
Apple, Google, Cisco Systems, and Oracle are the five largest
NASDAQ companies, and they make up a high percentage of
the index’s value-weighted market capitalization. For this
reason, substantial movements in the same direction by
these five companies can move the entire index.
Recent Performance
The accompanying figure plots the value that an investor
would now have if he or she had invested $1 in each of the
three indexes on January 1, 1995, through January 1, 2013.
The returns on the three indexes are compared with an
investment strategy that invests only in 1-year Treasury bills
(T-bills). Each of these indexes performed quite well through
1999. However, for a couple of years, each index stumbled
before beginning to rebound again in 2003 through mid-
2008. Each index fell from mid-2008 until early 2009, when
they began to rebound again. During the last 18 years, the
average annualized returns of these indexes ranged from
6.7% for the S&P 500 to 8.2% for the NASDAQ. (The Dow’s
annualized return during this same period was 7.2%.)
NASDAQ experienced a huge bubble in 1999, reflecting overly
optimistic valuations of technology companies. However, in
2000, the bubble burst and technology stock valuations spi-
raled downward, causing the NASDAQ Index to revert back to
a level comparable to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial
Average Index. Since that time, the three indexes have closely
tracked one another (see the line graph, below).

•
Intrinsic value: The price at which the stock would sell if all investors had all
knowable information about a stock. This concept was discussed in Chapter 1,
where we saw that a stock’s intrinsic value is based on its expected future cash
flows and its risk. Moreover, the market price tends to fluctuate around the
intrinsic value; and the intrinsic value changes over time as the company
succeeds or fails with new projects, competitors enter or exit the market, and
so forth. We can guess (or estimate) Facebook’s intrinsic value, but different
analysts will reach somewhat different conclusions.
•
Equilibrium price: The price that balances buy and sell orders at any given time.
When a stock is in equilibrium, the price remains relatively stable until new
information becomes available and causes the price to change.
•
Efficient market: A market in which prices are close to intrinsic values and
stocks seem to be in equilibrium.
When markets are efficient, investors can buy and sell stocks and be confident
that they are getting good prices. When markets are inefficient, investors may be
afraid to invest and may put their money “under the pillow,” which will lead to a
poor allocation of capital and economic stagnation. From an economic standpoint,
market efficiency is good.
Academics and financial professionals have studied the issue of market effi-
ciency extensively.13 As generally happens, some people think that markets are
highly efficient, some think that markets are highly inefficient, and others think
that the issue is too complex for a simple answer.
Those who believe that markets are efficient note that there are 100,000 or so
full-time, highly trained professional analysts and traders operating in the market.
Many have PhDs in physics, chemistry, and other technical fields in addition to
advanced degrees in finance. Moreover, there are fewer than 3,000 major stocks; so
if each analyst followed 30 stocks (which is about right, as analysts tend to focus on
a specific industry), on average, 1,000 analysts would be following each stock.
Further, these analysts work for organizations such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
Chase, and Deutsche Bank or for Warren Buffett and other billionaire investors who
have billions of dollars available to take advantage of bargains. Also, the SEC has
disclosure rules which, combined with electronic information networks, means that
new information about a stock is received by all analysts at about the same time,
causing almost instantaneous revaluations. All of these factors help markets to be
efficient and cause stock prices to move toward their intrinsic values.
However, other people point to data that suggest that markets are not very
efficient. For example, on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Index fell nearly 1,000 points
only to rebound rapidly by the end of the day.14 In 2000, Internet stocks rose to
phenomenally high prices, and then fell to zero or close to it the following year. No
truly important news was announced that could have caused either of these
changes; and if the market was efficient, it’s hard to see how such drastic changes
could have occurred. Another situation that causes people to question market
efficiency is the apparent ability of some analysts to consistently outperform the
market over long periods. Warren Buffett comes to mind, but there are others. If
markets are truly efficient, then each stock’s price should be close to its intrinsic
value. That would make it hard for any analyst to consistently pick stocks that
outperform the market.
13The general name for these studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, or EMH. It was, and still is, a
hypothesis that needs to be proved or disproved empirically. In the literature, researchers identified
three levels of efficiency: weak form, which contends that information on past stock price movements
cannot be used to predict future stock prices; semi-strong form, which contends that all publicly
available information is immediately incorporated into stock prices (i.e., that one cannot analyze
published reports and then beat the market); and strong form, which contends that even company
insiders, with inside information, cannot earn abnormally high returns.
14Regulators are investigating the causes of this dramatic decline, and are particularly focusing on the
role played by computerized trading. Refer to Tom Lauricella, Scott Patterson, and Carolyn Cui,
“Computer Trading Is Eyed,” The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com), May 8, 2010.

The diagram below sums up where most observers seem to be today. There
is an “efficiency continuum,” with the market for some companies’ stocks being
highly efficient and the market for other stocks being highly inefficient. The key
factor is the size of the company—the larger the firm, the more analysts tend
to follow it and thus the faster new information is likely to be reflected in the
stock’s price. Also, different companies communicate better with analysts
and investors; and the better the communications, the more efficient the market
for the stock.
As an investor, would you prefer to purchase a stock whose price was
determined in an efficient or an inefficient market? If you thought you knew
something that others didn’t know, you might prefer inefficient markets. But if
you thought that those physics PhDs with unlimited buying power and access to
company CEOs might know more than you, you would probably prefer efficient
markets, where the price you paid was likely to be the “right” price. From an
economic standpoint, it is good to have efficient markets in which everyone is
willing to participate. So the SEC and other regulatory agencies should do every-
thing they can to encourage market efficiency.
Thus far we have been discussing the market for individual stocks. But the
notion of efficiency applies to the pricing of all assets. For example, the dramatic
rise and subsequent collapse of housing prices in many U.S. markets, suggests that
there was a lot of inefficiency in these markets. It is also important to realize that
the level of market efficiency also varies over time. In one respect, we might expect
that lower transactions costs and the increasing number of analysts would cause
markets to become increasingly efficient over time. However, the recent housing
bubble and the previous bubble for Internet stocks provides some contrary evi-
dence. Indeed, these recent events have caused many experts to look for alter-
native reasons for this apparent irrational behavior. A lot of their research looks
for psychologically based explanations, which we discuss in the next section.
2-7A BEHAVIORAL FINANCE THEORY
The efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) remains one of the cornerstones of modern
finance theory. It implies that, on average, asset prices are about equal to their
intrinsic values. The logic behind the EMH is straightforward. If a stock’s price is
“too low,” rational traders will quickly take advantage of this opportunity and
buy the stock, pushing prices up to the proper level. Likewise, if prices are “too
high,” rational traders will sell the stock, pushing the price down to its equili-
brium level. Proponents of the EMH argue that these forces keep prices from being
systematically wrong.
While the logic behind the EMH is compelling, many events in the real world
seem inconsistent with the hypothesis, which has spurred a growing field called
behavioral finance. Rather than assuming that investors are rational, behavioral
finance theorists borrow insights from psychology to better understand how
irrational behavior can be sustained over time. Pioneers in this field include

psychologists Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and Richard Thaler. Their work
has encouraged a growing number of scholars to work in this promising area of
research.15
Professor Thaler and his colleague Nicholas Barberis argue that behavioral
finance’s criticism of the EMH rests on two key points. First, it is often difficult or
risky for traders to take advantage of mispriced assets. For example, even if you
know that a stock’s price is too low because investors have overreacted to recent
bad news, a trader with limited capital may be reluctant to purchase the stock for
fear that the same forces that pushed the price down may work to keep it
artificially low for a long time. Similarly, during the recent stock market bubble,
many traders who believed (correctly) that stock prices were too high lost a great
deal of money selling stocks short in the early stages of the bubble, because prices
went even higher before they eventually collapsed. Thus, mispricings may persist.
The second point deals with why mispricings can occur in the first place. Here
insights from psychology come into play. For example, Kahneman and Tversky
suggested that individuals view potential losses and gains differently. If you ask
average individuals whether they would rather have $500 with certainty or flip a
fair coin and receive $1,000 if a head comes up and nothing if a tail comes up, most
would prefer the certain $500, which suggests an aversion to risk. However, if you
ask people whether they would rather pay $500 with certainty or flip a coin and
pay $1,000 if it’s a head and nothing if it’s a tail, most would indicate that they
prefer to flip the coin. Other studies suggest that people’s willingness to take a
gamble depends on recent performance. Gamblers who are ahead tend to take on
more risk, whereas those who are behind tend to become more conservative.
These experiments suggest that investors and managers behave differently in
down markets than they do in up markets, which might explain why those who
made money early in the stock market bubble continued to invest their money in
the market even as prices went ever higher. Other evidence suggests that indivi-
duals tend to overestimate their true abilities. For example, a large majority of
people (upward of 90% in some studies) believe that they have above-average
driving ability and above-average ability to get along with others. Barberis and
Thaler point out that:
Overconfidence may in part stem from two other biases, self-attribution bias and hindsight
bias. Self-attribution bias refers to people’s tendency to ascribe any success they have in
some activity to their own talents, while blaming failure on bad luck rather than on their
ineptitude. Doing this repeatedly will lead people to the pleasing, but erroneous, conclu-
sion that they are very talented. For example, investors might become overconfident after
several quarters of investing success [Gervais and Odean (2001)]. Hindsight bias is the
tendency of people to believe, after an event has occurred, that they predicted it before it
happened. If people think they predicted the past better than they actually did, they may
also believe that they can predict the future better than they actually can.16

Behavioral finance has been studied in both the corporate finance and invest-
ments areas. Ulrike Malmendier of Stanford and Geoffrey Tate of Wharton found
that overconfidence leads managers to overestimate their ability and thus the
profitability of their projects.17 This may explain why so many corporate projects
fail to live up to their stated expectations.
2-7B CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MARKET EFFICIENCY
As noted previously, if the stock market is efficient, it is a waste of time for most
people to seek bargains by analyzing published data on stocks. That follows
because if stock prices already reflect all publicly available information, they will
be fairly priced; and a person can beat the market only with luck or inside
information. So rather than spending time and money trying to find undervalued
stocks, it would be better to buy an index fund designed to match the overall
market as reflected in an index such as the S&P 500. However, if we worked for an
institution with billions of dollars, we would try to find undervalued stocks or
companies because even a small undervaluation would amount to a great deal of
money when investing millions rather than thousands. Also, markets are more
efficient for individual stocks than for entire companies; so for investors with
enough capital, it does make sense to seek out badly managed companies that
can be acquired and improved. Note, though, that a number of private equity
players are doing exactly that; so the market for entire companies may soon be as
efficient as that for individual stocks.
However, even if markets are efficient and all stocks and companies are fairly
priced, an investor should still be careful when selecting stocks for his or her
portfolio. Most importantly, the portfolio should be diversified, with a mix of
stocks from various industries along with some bonds and other fixed-income
securities. We will discuss diversification in greater detail in Chapter 8, but it is an
important consideration for most individual investors.
In this chapter, we provided a brief overview of how capital is allocated and discussed
the financial markets, instruments, and institutions used in the allocation process. We
discussed physical location exchanges and electronic markets for common stocks,
stock market reporting, and stock indexes. We demonstrated that security prices are

volatile—investors expect to make money, which they generally do over time; but
losses can be large in any given year. Finally, we discussed the efficiency of the stock
market and developments in behavioral finance. After reading this chapter, you
should have a general understanding of the financial environment in which busi-
nesses and individuals operate, realize that actual returns are often different from
expected returns, and be able to read stock market quotations from business news-
papers or various Internet sites. You should also recognize that the theory of financial
markets is a “work in progress,” and much work remains to be done.

Financial Markets and Institutions Assume that you recently graduated with a degree in finance and have just
reported to work as an investment adviser at the brokerage firm of Smyth Barry & Co. Your first assignment is to
explain the nature of the U.S. financial markets to Michelle Varga, a professional tennis player who recently came to
the United States from Mexico. Varga is a highly ranked tennis player who expects to invest substantial amounts of
money through Smyth Barry. She is very bright; therefore, she would like to understand in general terms what will
happen to her money. Your boss has developed the following questions that you must use to explain the U.S.
financial system to Varga.
a.
What are the three primary ways in which capital is transferred between savers and borrowers? Describe each one.
b.
What is a market? Differentiate between the following types of markets: physical asset markets versus financial
asset markets, spot markets versus futures markets, money markets versus capital markets, primary markets
versus secondary markets, and public markets versus private markets.
c.
Why are financial markets essential for a healthy economy and economic growth?

Explain.
e.
Briefly describe each of the following financial institutions: investment banks, commercial banks, financial
services corporations, pension funds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, hedge funds, and private equity
companies.
f.
What are the two leading stock markets? Describe the two basic types of stock markets.
g.

j.
After your consultation with Michelle, she wants to discuss these two possible stock purchases:
1. While in the waiting room of your office, she overheard an analyst on a financial TV network say that a
particular medical research company just received FDA approval for one of its products. On the basis of this
“hot” information, Michelle wants to buy many shares of that company’s stock. Assuming the stock market is
highly efficient, what advice would you give her?
2. She has read a number of newspaper articles about a huge IPO being carried out by a leading technology
company. She wants to purchase as many shares in the IPO as possible and would even be willing to buy the
shares in the open market immediately after the issue. What advice do you have for her?
k.
How does behavioral finance explain the real world inconsistencies of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH)?

Unlocking the Valuable Information in Financial Statements
In Chapter 1, we said that managers should
make decisions that enhance long-term share-
holder value, and they should be less concerned
about short-term accounting measures such as
earnings per share. With that important point in
mind, you might reasonably wonder why are
we now going to talk about accounting and
financial statements. The simple answer is finan-
cial statements convey a lot of useful informa-
tion that helps corporate managers assess
the
company’s
strengths
and
weaknesses
and gauge the expected impact of various pro-
posals. Good managers must have a solid
understanding of the key financial statements.
Outsiders also rely heavily on financial state-
ments when deciding whether they want to
buy the company’s stock, lend money to the
company, or enter into a long-term business
relationship with the company.
At first glance, financial statements can be
overwhelming—but if we know what we are
looking for, we can quickly learn a great deal
about a company after a quick review of its
financial statements. Looking at the balance
sheet we can see how large a company is,
the types of assets it holds, and how it finances
those assets. Looking at the income statement,
we can see if the company’s sales increased or
declined and whether the company made a
profit. Glancing at the statement of cash flows,
we can see if the company made any new
investments, if it raised funds through finan-
cing, repurchased debt or equity, or paid
dividends.
For example, in early 2013, Starbucks released
its first quarter financial statements. The news
was good. The company earned $432.2 million
in the first quarter of its fiscal year—a year earlier

it had earned $382.1 million, and three years earlier it had
earned only $64.3 million. Starbucks also announced a strong
increase in same-store sales, and its income statement showed
that operating costs grew less than revenues. Reviewing the
company’s annual report for 2012, at the end of its fiscal year
(September 30, 2012), Starbucks showed total assets of $8.2
billion and total liabilities of $3.1 billion on its balance sheet.
Finally, looking at the statement of cash flows, we see that the
company used most of the cash generated from its operations
to make new investments, to pay dividends, and to repurchase
common stock. The net effect was that Starbucks’ cash position
increased only modestly from $1.15 billion to $1.19 billion
during the year.
While we can learn a lot from a quick tour of the financial
statements, a good financial analyst does not just accept
these numbers at face value. The analyst digs deeper to see
what’s really driving the numbers and uses his or her intuition
and knowledge of the industry to help assess the company’s
future direction. Keep in mind that just because a company
reports great numbers doesn’t mean that you should buy the
stock. In the case of Starbucks, its stock price did rise after it
announced its better-than-expected financial numbers for the
first quarter. However, as is always the case, analysts have
mixed feelings about the stock’s future direction. It’s these
types of disagreements that make finance interesting, and as
always, time will tell whether the optimists (the bulls) or the
pessimists (the bears) are correct.
A manager’s primary goal is to maximize the value of his or her firm’s stock, and value is
based on the firm’s future cash flows. But how do managers decide which actions are
most likely to increase those flows, and how do investors estimate future cash flows? The
answers to both questions lie in a study of financial statements that publicly traded firms
must provide to investors. Here investors include both institutions (banks, insurance
companies, pension funds, and the like) and individuals like you.
Much of the material in this chapter deals with concepts you covered in a basic
accounting course. However, the information is important enough to warrant a review.
Also, in accounting, you probably focused on how accounting statements are made; the
focus here is on how investors and managers interpret and use them. Accounting is the
basic language of business, so everyone engaged in business needs a good working
knowledge of it. It is used to “keep score”; and if investors and managers do not know
the score, they won’t know whether their actions are appropriate. If you took midterm
exams but were not told your scores, you would have a difficult time knowing whether
you needed to improve. The same idea holds in business. If a firm’s managers—whether
they work in marketing, human resources, production, or finance—do not understand
financial statements, they will not be able to judge the effects of their actions, which will
make it hard for the firm to survive, much less to have a maximum value.
When you finish this chapter you should be able to:
•
List each of the key financial statements and identify the kinds of information they
provide to corporate managers and investors.
•
Estimate a firm’s free cash flow and explain why free cash flow has such an important
effect on firm value.
•
Discuss the major features of the federal income tax system.

3-1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REPORTS
The annual report is the most important report that corporations issue to stock-
holders, and it contains two types of information.1 First, there is a verbal section,
often presented as a letter from the chairperson, which describes the firm’s
operating results during the past year and discusses new developments that will
affect future operations. Second, the report provides these four basic financial
statements:
1.
The balance sheet, which shows what assets the company owns and who has
claims on those assets as of a given date—for example, December 31, 2014.
2.
The income statement, which shows the firm’s sales and costs (and thus profits)
during some past period—for example, 2014.
3.
The statement of cash flows, which shows how much cash the firm began the
year with, how much cash it ended up with, and what it did to increase or
decrease its cash.
4.
The statement of stockholders’ equity, which shows the amount of equity the
stockholders had at the start of the year, the items that increased or decreased
equity, and the equity at the end of the year.
These statements are related to one another; and taken together, they provide an
accounting picture of the firm’s operations and financial position.
The quantitative and verbal materials are equally important. The firm’s finan-
cial statements report what has actually happened to its assets, earnings, and divi-
dends over the past few years, whereas management’s verbal statements attempt
to explain why things turned out the way they did and what might happen in the
future.
For discussion purposes, we use data for Allied Food Products, a processor
and distributor of a wide variety of food products, to illustrate the basic
financial statements. Allied was formed in 1983, when several regional firms
merged; it has grown steadily while earning a reputation as one of the best firms
in its industry. Allied’s earnings dropped from $121 8 million in 2013 to $117 5
million in 2014. Management reported that the drop resulted from losses asso-
ciated with a drought as well as increased costs due to a three-month strike.
However, management then went on to describe a more optimistic picture for
the future, stating that full operations had been resumed, that several unprofi-
table businesses had been eliminated, and that 2015 profits were expected to rise
sharply. Of course, an increase in profitability may not occur; and analysts
should compare management’s past statements with subsequent results. In
any event, the information contained in the annual report can be used to help forecast
future earnings and dividends. Therefore, investors are very interested in this
report.
We should note that Allied’s financial statements are relatively simple and
straightforward; we also omitted some details often shown in the statements.
Allied finances with only debt and common stock—it has no preferred stock,
convertibles, or complex derivative securities. Also, the firm has made no acquisi-
tions that resulted in goodwill that must be carried on the balance sheet. Finally,
all of its assets are used in its basic business operations; hence, no non-operating
assets must be pulled out when we evaluate its operating performance. We
deliberately chose such a company because this is an introductory text; as such,
1Firms also provide quarterly reports, but these are much less comprehensive than the annual report.
In addition, larger firms file even more detailed statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), giving breakdowns for each major division or subsidiary. These reports, called
10-K reports, are made available to stockholders upon request to a company’s corporate secretary. In
this chapter, we focus on annual data—balance sheets at the ends of years and income statements for
entire years rather than for shorter time periods.

we want to explain the basics of financial analysis, not wander into arcane
accounting matters that are best left to accounting and security analysis courses.
We do point out some of the pitfalls that can be encountered when trying to
interpret accounting statements, but we leave it to advanced courses to cover the
intricacies of accounting.

Global Accounting Standards: Will It Ever Happen?
For the past decade, global accounting standards seemed all but
certain. In 2005, the EU required the adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and in 2007, the SEC elimi-
nated the requirement for companies reporting under IFRS to
reconcile their financial statements to U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP). To date, 100 countries have
adopted IFRS. The most recent countries to adopt IFRS are Russia
and Canada—even China is considering adopting IFRS. However,
on July 13, 2012, the SEC staff issued a report that failed to
recommend IFRS for U.S. adoption. Even though the ultimate
decision will be up to the SEC commission, this report will play
an important role in its decision.
The effort to internationalize accounting standards began in
1973 with the formation of the International Accounting Stan-
dards Committee. However, in 1998, it became apparent that a
full-time rule-making body with global representation was neces-
sary; so the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was
established. The IASB was charged with the responsibility for
creating a set of IFRS. The “convergence” process began in earn-
est in September 2002 with the “Norwalk Agreement,” in which
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and IASB
undertook a short-term project to remove individual differences
between the FASB’s U.S. GAAP and IFRS and agreed to coordinate
their activities. The process was meant to narrow gaps between
the two standards with the intention of making the transition for
companies simpler and less expensive.
Obviously, the globalization of accounting standards is a huge
endeavor—one that involves compromises between the IASB
and FASB. However, in recent years the momentum behind this
goal has diminished. Despite the best of intentions, progress
towards consolidation was slowed by the 2007–2008 financial
crisis and the resulting global recession. In addition, the leasing
and financial instruments impairment projects progressed slowly
and the chairs of both the FASB and IASB left their positions. It
has become apparent that the cost to companies both large and
small for switching from GAAP to IFRS will be significant. Finally,
the SEC has been given the task of implementing the Dodd–
Frank financial reform law—limiting its ability to focus on adopt-
ing global accounting standards.
The United States is an important economy, and without its
participation it will be difficult to truly have global accounting
standards. While this report is a setback, many CFOs and account-
ing professionals still expect the SEC to come out with an Amer-
ican version of IFRS to coexist with GAAP. However, it appears
that any decision by the SEC will come after the November 2012
U.S. presidential election and even after January 1, 2013—maybe
later. Global accounting standards are probably inevitable—it’s
just a question of time.

3-2 THE BALANCE SHEET
The balance sheet is a “snapshot” of a firm’s position at a specific point in time.
Figure 3.1 shows the layout of a typical balance sheet. The left side of the
statement shows the assets that the company owns, while the right side shows
the firm’s liabilities and stockholders’ equity, which are claims against the firm’s
assets. As Figure 3.1 shows, assets are divided into two major categories: current
assets and fixed, or long-term, assets. Current assets consist of assets that should
be converted to cash within one year; and they include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, and inventory.2 Long-term assets are assets expected to be
used for more than one year; they include plant and equipment in addition to
intellectual property such as patents and copyrights. Plant and equipment is
generally reported net of accumulated depreciation. Allied’s long-term assets
consist entirely of net plant and equipment, and we often refer to them as “net
fixed assets.”

an illustration.
2Allied and most other companies hold some currency in addition to a bank checking account. They
may also hold short-term interest-bearing securities that can be sold and thus converted to cash
immediately with a simple telephone call. These securities are called “cash equivalents,” and they
are generally included with checking account balances for financial reporting purposes. If a company
owns stocks or other marketable securities that it regards as short-term investments, these items will be
shown separately on the balance sheet. Allied does not hold any marketable securities other than cash
equivalents.

The claims against assets are of two basic types—liabilities (or money the
company owes to others) and stockholders’ equity. Current liabilities consist of
claims that must be paid off within one year, including accounts payable, accruals
(total of accrued wages and accrued taxes), and notes payable to banks and other
short-term lenders that are due within one year. Long-term debt includes bonds
that mature in more than a year.
Stockholders’ equity can be thought of in two ways. First, it is the amount
that stockholders paid to the company when they bought shares the company sold
to raise capital, in addition to all of the earnings the company has retained over
the years:3
Stockholders’ equity
Paid-in capital
Retained earnings
The retained earnings are not just the earnings retained in the latest year—they
are the cumulative total of all of the earnings the company has earned during its
life.
Stockholders’ equity can also be thought of as a residual:
Stockholders’ equity
Total assets
Total liabilities
If Allied had invested surplus funds in bonds backed by subprime mortgages and
the bonds’ value fell below their purchase price, the true value of the firm’s assets
would have declined. The amount of its liabilities would not have changed—the
firm would still owe the amount it had promised to pay its creditors. Therefore, the
reported value of the common equity must decline. The accountants would make a
series of entries, and the result would be a reduction in retained earnings—and thus
in common equity. In the end, assets would equal liabilities and equity and the
balance sheet would balance. This example shows why common stock is more risky
than bonds—any mistake that management makes has a big impact on the stock-
holders. Of course, gains from good decisions also go to the stockholders; so with
risk come possible rewards.
Assets on the balance sheet are listed by the length of time before they will be
converted to cash (inventories and accounts receivable) or used by the firm (fixed
assets). Similarly, claims are listed in the order in which they must be paid:
Accounts payable must generally be paid within a few days, accruals must also
be paid promptly, notes payable to banks must be paid within one year, and so
forth, down to the stockholders’ equity accounts, which represent ownership and
need never be “paid off.”
3-2A ALLIED’S BALANCE SHEET
Table 3.1 shows Allied’s year-end balance sheets for 2014 and 2013. From the 2014
statement, we see that Allied had $2 billion of assets—half current and half
long term. These assets were financed with $310 million of current liabilities,
$750 million of long-term debt, and $940 million of common equity. Comparing
the balance sheets for 2014 and 2013, we see that Allied’s assets grew by $320 million
and its liabilities and equity necessarily grew by that same amount. Assets must, of
course, equal liabilities and equity; otherwise, the balance sheet does not balance.
Several additional points about the balance sheet should be noted:
1.
Cash versus other assets. Although assets are reported in dollar terms, only the
cash and equivalents account represents actual spendable money. Accounts
receivable represent credit sales that have not yet been collected. Inventories
show the cost of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. Net fixed
3On Allied’s balance sheet, we simply show a common stock line representing the “paid-in” capital of
stockholders when they purchased common shares of stock.
Stockholders’ Equity
It represents the amount
that stockholders paid the
company when shares
were purchased and the
amount of earnings the
company has retained
since its origination.
Retained Earnings
They represent the
cumulative total of all
earnings kept by the
company during its life.

assets represent the cost of the buildings and equipment used in operations
minus the depreciation that has been taken on these assets. At the end of 2014,
Allied has $10 million of cash; hence, it could write checks totaling that
amount. The noncash assets should generate cash over time, but they do not
represent cash in hand. And the cash they would bring in if they were sold
today could be higher or lower than the values reported on the balance sheet.
2.
Working capital. Current assets are often called working capital because these
assets “turn over”; that is, they are used and then replaced throughout the
year. When Allied buys inventory items on credit, its suppliers, in effect, lend
it the money used to finance the inventory items. Allied could have borrowed

Notes:
1. Inventories can be valued by several different methods, and the method chosen can affect both
the balance sheet value and the cost of goods sold, and thus net income, as reported on the
income statement. Similarly, companies can use different depreciation methods. The methods
used must be reported in the notes to the financial statements, and security analysts can make
adjustments when they compare companies if they think the differences are material.
2. Book value per share: Total common equity/Shares outstanding = $940/50 = $18.80.
3. A relatively few firms use preferred stock, which we discuss in Chapter 9. Preferred stock can
take several different forms, but it is generally like debt because it pays a fixed amount each
year. However, it is like common stock because a failure to pay the preferred dividend does not
expose the firm to bankruptcy. If a firm does use preferred stock, it is shown on the balance
sheet between total debt and common stock. There is no set rule on how preferred stock should
be treated when financial ratios are calculated—it could be considered as debt or as equity.
Bondholders often think of it as equity, while stockholders think of it as debt because it is a fixed
charge. In truth, preferred stock is a hybrid, somewhere between debt and common equity.

from its bank or sold stock to obtain the money, but it received the funds from
its suppliers. These loans are shown as accounts payable, and they typically
are “free” in the sense that they do not bear interest. Similarly, Allied pays its
workers every two weeks and pays taxes quarterly; so Allied’s labor force and
tax authorities provide it with loans equal to its accrued wages and taxes. In
addition to these “free” sources of short-term credit, Allied borrows from its
bank on a short-term basis. These bank loans are shown as notes payable.
While accounts payable and accruals do not bear interest, Allied pays interest
on funds obtained from the bank. The total of accounts payable, accruals, and
notes payable represent current liabilities on its balance sheet. If we subtract
current liabilities from current assets, the difference is called net working
capital.

Current liabilities include accounts payable, accruals, and notes payable to
the bank. Financial analysts often make an important distinction between the
“free” liabilities (accruals and accounts payable) and interest-bearing notes
payable (which incur interest expense that is included as a financing cost on
the firm’s income statement). With this distinction in mind, analysts often
focus on net operating working capital (NOWC) which differs from net
working capital because interest-bearing notes payable are subtracted from
current liabilities.

Other sources of funds. Most companies (including Allied) finance their assets
with a combination of short-term debt, long-term debt, and common equity.
Some companies also use “hybrid” securities such as preferred stock,
convertible bonds, and long-term leases. Preferred stock is a hybrid between
common stock and debt, while convertible bonds are debt securities that give
the bondholder an option to exchange their bonds for shares of common stock.
In the event of bankruptcy, debt is paid off first, and then preferred stock.
Common stock is last, receiving a payment only when something remains
after the debt and preferred stock are paid off.5
5.
Depreciation. Most companies prepare two sets of financial statements—one is
based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules and is used to calculate taxes;
the other is based on GAAP and is used for reporting to investors. Firms often
use accelerated depreciation for tax purposes but straight-line depreciation for
stockholder reporting. Allied uses accelerated depreciation for both.6

Market values versus book values. Companies generally use GAAP to determine
the values reported on their balance sheets. In most cases, these accounting
numbers (or “book values”) are different from what the assets would sell for if
they were offered for sale (or “market values”). For example, Allied purchased
its headquarters in Chicago in 1990. Under GAAP, the company must report
Q U E S T I O N :
Refer to Allied’s balance sheets shown in Table 3.1. What was Allied’s total debt on December
31, 2013?
A N S W E R :
Total debt2013 = Short-term debt2013 + Long-term debt2013
Total debt2013 = $60 + $580 = $640 million
4Companies also include the portion of their long-term bonds that is currently due as part of short-term
debt.
5Other forms of financing are discussed in Chapter 20, “Hybrid Financing: Preferred Stock, Warrants,
and Convertibles,” of Brigham and Daves, Intermediate Financial Management, 11th edition, (Mason, OH:
South-Western/Cengage Learning, 2013).
6Depreciation over an asset’s life is equal to the asset’s cost, but accelerated depreciation results in
higher initial depreciation charges—and thus lower taxable income—than straight line. Due to the time
value of money, it is better to delay taxes; so most companies use accelerated depreciation for tax
purposes. Either accelerated or straight line can be used for stockholder reporting. Allied is a relatively
conservative company; hence, it uses accelerated depreciation for stockholder reporting. Had Allied
elected to use straight line for stockholder reporting, its 2014 depreciation expense would have been
$25 million lower, the $1 billion shown for “net plant” on its balance sheet would have been
$25 million higher, and its reported income would also have been higher.
Depreciation is also important in capital budgeting, where we make decisions regarding new
investments in fixed assets. We will have more to say about depreciation in Chapter 12, when we
discuss capital budgeting.

the value of this asset at its historical cost (what it originally paid for the
building in 1990) less accumulated depreciation. Given that Chicago real
estate prices have increased over the last 23 years (even considering the
impact of the recent recession on real estate values), the market value of the
building is higher than its book value. Other assets’ market values also differ
from their book values.
We can also see from Table 3.1 that the book value of Allied’s common
equity at the end of 2014 was $940 million. Because 50 million shares were
outstanding, the book value per share was $940 50
$18 80. However, the
market value of the common stock was $23 06. As is true for most companies
in 2014, shareholders are willing to pay more than book value for Allied’s
stock. This occurs in part because the values of assets have increased due to
inflation and in part because shareholders expect earnings to grow. Allied, like
most other companies, has learned how to make investments that will increase
future profits.
Apple provides an example of the effect of growth on the stock price. When Apple first
introduced new products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, its balance sheet didn’t
budge; but investors recognized that these were great products that would lead to
higher future profits. So Apple’s stock quickly rose above its book value—at its peak
in September 2012, the company’s stock price was $705 07 versus a $125 86 book
value. More recently, the assessments of the company’s future prospects have
dimmed somewhat, and we have seen the ratio of its market-to-book ratio narrow.
On February 20, 2013, Apple’s stock price closed at $448 85, while its book value for
the most recent quarter was $135 62.
If a company has problems, its stock price can fall below its book value.
For example, SkyWest, a regional airline struggling during the slow econ-
omy and hurt by rising fuel costs, saw its stock price fall to around $11 at a
time when its book value per share exceeded $26.
7.
Time dimension. The balance sheet is a snapshot of the firm’s financial position
at a point in time—for example, on December 31, 2014. Thus, we see that on
December 31, 2013, Allied had $80 million of cash; but that balance fell to $10
million by year-end 2014. The balance sheet changes every day as inventories
rise and fall, as bank loans are increased or decreased, and so forth. A
company such as Allied, whose business is seasonal, experiences especially
CASH HOLDINGS AND NET OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL: A CLOSER LOOK
To help keep things simple, our definition of net operating
working capital (NOWC) assumes that all of the firm’s current
assets (including cash) are used for normal operating pur-
poses. While this assumption may be reasonable, there are
clear instances where firms hold more cash than they need
to run their day-to-day operations. For example, at Decem-
ber 31, 2012, Microsoft had more than $68 billion in cash
and short-term investments!
In practice, if a financial analyst believes that some of the
firm’s cash is being held for nonoperating purposes, he or
she would subtract these excess cash holdings from the
firm’s current assets when calculating net operating working
capital, as follows:
NOWC
Current assets
“Excess” cash
Current liabilities
Notes payable
To illustrate, if we make the extreme assumption that all of
Allied’s $10 million in cash is held for nonoperating pur-
poses, then this $10 million in excess cash would be sub-
tracted from its current assets, and its NOWC would be
calculated as $790 million instead of the $800 million calcu-
lated earlier. While the difference for Allied is fairly small,
assumptions about the level of excess cash become much
more important when analyzing companies with very large
cash holdings. However, unless otherwise noted, throughout
this text we will assume that a firm’s cash balance is used
solely for operating purposes.

THE BALANCE SHEET OF AN “AVERAGE” AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD
Balance sheets are not unique to corporations. Every entity—
including state and local governments, nonprofit agencies,
and individual households—has a balance sheet.
We can learn a lot about a household’s financial well-
being by looking at its balance sheet. While obviously every
household is different, economists can use available data
to estimate the balance sheet of an average American
household.
For example, in 2009, James Kwak posted his calculations of
the average household balance sheet on his popular website
The Baseline Scenario (baselinescenario.com), which provides
interesting commentary on a variety of current economic and
financial issues. The underlying data for his calculations came
from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances.
Here is a summary of Kwak’s calculations for 2004, 2007,
and 2009:

Note: See Kwak’s posting on The Baseline Scenario for more details about the methods that he used in his calculations.
While his calculations were only meant to give a broad
picture of recent trends, they produce some interesting
findings:
•
The largest asset of the average household is its primary
residence.
•
The average American household does not have a large
amount of savings in place for retirement.
•
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, average household debt
levels have not increased dramatically in recent years.
•
Average household net worth increased slightly from
2004 to 2007, but declined sharply from 2007 to 2009.
The decline in net worth was due to two reasons: The
sharp decline in the housing market reduced the value
of the average home and the sharp decline in the stock
market reduced the value of the average amount of
retirement savings.
While not broken down on a per-household level,
updated information on aggregate household finances is
on the Federal Reserve website. For example, numbers
released in December 2012 indicate that aggregate house-
hold balance sheets have strengthened somewhat since
2009. These improvements reflect that many households
have made progress in reducing their debt level. Household
levels of net worth have also improved because of the large
run-up in the stock market during this time period.7

Christmas but low inventories (and high accounts receivable) just after
Christmas. We will examine the effects of these changes in Chapter 4, when
we compare companies’ financial statements and evaluate their performance.
3-3 THE INCOME STATEMENT
Table 3.2 shows Allied’s 2013 and 2014 income statements. Net sales are shown
at the top of the statement; then operating costs, interest, and taxes are sub-
tracted to obtain the net income available to common shareholders. We also
show earnings and dividends per share, in addition to some other data, at the
bottom of Table 3.2. Earnings per share (EPS) is often called “the bottom line,”
denoting that of all items on the income statement, EPS is the one that is most
important to stockholders. Allied earned $2 35 per share in 2014, down from
$2 44 in 2013. In spite of the decline in earnings, the firm still increased the
dividend from $1 06 to $1 15.
A typical stockholder focuses on the reported EPS, but professional security
analysts and managers differentiate between operating and non-operating income.
Operating income is derived from the firm’s regular core business—in Allied’s
case, from producing and selling food products. Moreover, it is calculated before
deducting interest expenses and taxes, which are considered to be non-operating
costs. Operating income is also called EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes.
Here is its equation:
Operating income or EBIT
Sales revenues
Operating costs
$3,000 0
$2,716 2
$283 8 million
3.2
This figure must, of course, match the one reported on the income statement.
Different firms have different amounts of debt, different tax carry-backs and
carry-forwards, and different amounts of non-operating assets such as marketable
securities. These differences can cause two companies with identical operations to
report significantly different net incomes. For example, suppose two companies
have identical sales, operating costs, and assets. However, one company uses
some debt and the other uses only common equity. Despite their identical operat-
ing performances, the company with no debt (and therefore no interest expense)
would report a higher net income because no interest was deducted from its

operating income. Consequently, if you want to compare two companies’ operat-
ing performances, it is best to focus on their operating income.8
From Allied’s income statement, we see that its operating income increased
from $263 0 million in 2013 to $283 8 million in 2014, or by $20 8 million. How-
ever, its 2014 net income declined. This decline occurred because it increased its
debt in 2014, and the $28 million increase in interest lowered its net income.
Taking a closer look at the income statement, we see that depreciation and
amortization are important components of operating costs. Recall from accounting

8Operating income is important for several reasons. Managers are generally compensated based on the
performance of the units they manage. A division manager can control his or her division’s
performance but not the firm’s capital structure policy or other corporate decisions. Second, if one
firm is considering acquiring another, it will be interested in the value of the target firm’s operations;
that value is determined by the target firm’s operating income. Third, operating income is normally
more stable than total income, as total income can be heavily influenced by write-offs of bonds backed
by subprime mortgages and the like. Therefore, analysts focus on operating income when they estimate
firms’ long-run stock values.
aAllied has 50 million shares of common stock outstanding. Note that EPS is based on net income available
to common stockholders. Calculations of EPS, DPS, and BVPS for 2014 are as follows:

When a firm has options or convertibles outstanding or it recently issued new common stock, a more
comprehensive EPS, “diluted EPS,” is calculated. Its calculation is a bit more complicated, but you may refer
to any financial accounting text for a discussion.

that depreciation is an annual charge against income that reflects the estimated
dollar cost of the capital equipment and other tangible assets that were depleted in
the production process. Amortization amounts to the same thing except that it
represents the decline in value of intangible assets such as patents, copyrights,
trademarks, and goodwill. Because depreciation and amortization are so similar,
they are generally lumped together for purposes of financial analysis on the
income statement and for other purposes. They both write off, or allocate, the
costs of assets over their useful lives.
Even though depreciation and amortization are reported as costs on the
income statements, they are not cash expenses—cash was spent in the past, when
the assets being written off were acquired, but no cash is paid out to cover
depreciation and amortization. Therefore, managers, security analysts, and bank
loan officers who are concerned with the amount of cash a company is generating
often calculate EBITDA, an acronym for earnings before interest, taxes, deprecia-
tion, and amortization. Allied has no amortization charges, so Allied’s deprecia-
tion and amortization expense consists entirely of depreciation. In 2014, Allied’s
EBITDA was $383 8 million.
While the balance sheet represents a snapshot in time, the income statement
reports on operations over a period of time. For example, during 2014, Allied had
sales of $3 billion and its net income was $117 5 million. Income statements are
prepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The quarterly and annual statements
are reported to investors, while the monthly statements are used internally by
managers for planning and control purposes.
Finally, note that the income statement is tied to the balance sheet through the
retained earnings account on the balance sheet. Net income as reported on the
income statement less dividends paid is the retained earnings for the year (e.g.,
2014). Those retained earnings are added to the cumulative retained earnings from
prior years to obtain the year-end 2014 balance for retained earnings. The retained
earnings for the year are also reported in the statement of stockholders’ equity. All
four of the statements provided in the annual report are interrelated.
3-4 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
Net income as reported on the income statement is not cash; and in finance, “cash
is king.” Management’s goal is to maximize the price of the firm’s stock; and the
value of any asset, including a share of stock, is based on the cash flows the asset is
expected to produce. Therefore, managers strive to maximize the cash flows
available to investors. The statement of cash flows as shown in Table 3.3 is the
accounting report that shows how much cash the firm is generating. The state-
ment is divided into four sections, and we explain it on a line-by-line basis.9
S E L F T E S T
Why is earnings per share called “the bottom line”? What is EBIT, or operating
income?
What is EBITDA?
Which is more like a snapshot of the firm’s operations—the balance sheet or the
income statement? Explain your answer.
9Allied's statement of cash flows is relatively simple because it is a relatively uncomplicated company.
Many cash flow statements are more complex; but if you understand Table 3.3, you should be able to
follow more complex statements.
Depreciation
The charge to reflect the
cost of assets depleted in
the production process.
Depreciation is not a cash
outlay.
Amortization
A noncash charge similar
to depreciation except
that it represents a decline
in value of intangible
assets.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and
amortization.
Statement of Cash Flows
A report that shows how
items that affect the
balance sheet and income
statement affect the firm’s
cash flows.

Here is a line-by-line explanation of the statement shown in Table 3.3:
a.
Operating activities. This section deals with items that occur as part of normal
ongoing operations.
b.
Net income. The first operating activity is net income, which is the first source
of cash. If all sales were for cash, if all costs required immediate cash
payments, and if the firm were in a static situation, net income would equal
cash from operations. However, these conditions don’t hold, so net income is
not equal to cash from operations. Adjustments shown in the remainder of the
statement must be made.
c.
Depreciation and amortization. The first adjustment relates to depreciation and
amortization. Allied’s accountants subtracted depreciation (it has no
amortization expense), which is a noncash charge, when they calculated net
income. Therefore, depreciation must be added back to net income when cash
flow is determined.
d.
Increase in inventories. To make or buy inventory items, the firm must use cash.
It may receive some of this cash as loans from its suppliers and workers
(payables and accruals); but ultimately, any increase in inventories requires
cash. Allied increased its inventories by $200 million in 2014. That amount is
shown in parentheses on Line d because it is negative (i.e., a use of cash). If
Allied had reduced its inventories, it would have generated positive cash.
e.
Increase in accounts receivable. If Allied chooses to sell on credit when it makes a
sale, it will not immediately get the cash that it would have received had it not

extended credit. To stay in business, it must replace the inventory that it sold
on credit; but it won’t yet have received cash from the credit sale. So if the
firm’s accounts receivable increase, this will amount to a use of cash. Allied’s
receivables rose by $60 million in 2014, and that use of cash is shown as a
negative number on Line e. If Allied had reduced its receivables, this would be
shown as a positive cash flow. (Once cash is received for the sale, the
accompanying accounts receivable will be eliminated.)
f.
Increase in accounts payable. Accounts payable represent a loan from suppliers.
Allied bought goods on credit, and its payables increased by $30 million this
year. That is treated as a $30 million increase in cash on Line f. If Allied had
reduced its payables, that would have required, or used, cash. Note that as
Allied grows, it will purchase more inventories. That will give rise to
additional payables, which will reduce the amount of new outside funds
required to finance inventory growth.
g.
Increase in accrued wages and taxes. The same logic applies to accruals as to
accounts payable. Allied’s accruals increased by $10 million this year, which
means that in 2014, it borrowed an additional $10 million from its workers and
tax authorities. So this represents a $10 million cash inflow.
h.
Net cash provided by operating activities. All of the previous items are part of
normal operations—they arise as a result of doing business. When we sum
them, we obtain the net cash flow from operations. Allied had positive flows
from net income, depreciation, and increases in payables and accruals; but it
used cash to increase inventories and to carry receivables. The net result was
that operations led to a $2 5 million net cash outflow.
i.
Long-term investing activities. All activities involving long-term assets are
covered in this section. Allied had only one long-term investment activity—the
acquisition of some fixed assets, as shown on Line j. If Allied had sold some
fixed assets, its accountants would have reported it in this section as a positive
amount (i.e., as a cash inflow).
j.
Additions to property, plant, and equipment. Allied spent $230 million on fixed
assets during the current year. This is an outflow; therefore, it is shown in
parentheses. If Allied had sold some of its fixed assets, this would have been a
cash inflow.10
k.
Net cash used in investing activities. Because Allied had only one investment
activity, the total on this line is the same as that on the previous line.
l.
Financing activities. Allied’s financing activities are shown in this section.
m.
Increase in notes payable. Allied borrowed an additional $50 million from its
bank this year, which was a cash inflow. When Allied repays the loan, this will
be an outflow.
n.
Increase in bonds (long-term debt). Allied borrowed an additional $170 million
from long-term investors this year, issuing bonds in exchange for cash. This is
shown as an inflow. When the bonds are repaid by the firm some years hence,
this will be an outflow.
o.
Payment of dividends to stockholders. Dividends are paid in cash, and the
$57 5 million that Allied paid to stockholders is shown as a negative amount.
p.
Net cash provided by financing activities. The sum of the three financing entries,
which is a positive $162 5 million, is shown here. These funds were used to
help pay for the $230 million of new plant and equipment and to help cover
the deficit resulting from operations.
10The number on Line j is “gross” investment, or total expenditures. It is also equal to the change in net
plant and equipment (from the balance sheet) plus depreciation as shown on Line c: Gross
investment = Net investment + Depreciation = $130 + $100 = $230.

Cash and equivalents at the end of the year. Allied ended the year with $10 million
of cash, the $80 million it started with minus the $70 million net decrease that
occurred during the year. Clearly, Allied’s cash position is weaker than it was
at the beginning of the year.
Allied’s statement of cash flows should be of concern to its managers and
investors. The company was able to cover the small operating deficit and the large
investment in fixed assets by borrowing and reducing its beginning balances of
cash and equivalents. However, the firm can’t continue to do this indefinitely. In
the long run, Section I needs to show positive operating cash flows. In addition,
we would expect Section II to show expenditures on fixed assets that are about
equal to (1) its depreciation charges (to replace worn out fixed assets) along with
(2) some additional expenditures to provide for growth. Section III would nor-
mally show some net borrowing in addition to a “reasonable” amount of divi-
dends.11 Finally, Section IV should show a reasonably stable year-to-year cash
balance. These conditions don’t hold for Allied, so some actions should be taken to
correct the situation. We will consider corrective actions in Chapter 4, when we
analyze the firm’s financial statements.
MASSAGING THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT
Profits as reported on the income statement can be “mas-
saged” by changes in depreciation methods, inventory valua-
tion procedures, and so on, but “cash is cash,” so manage-
ment can’t mess with the cash flow statement, right? Nope—
wrong. A 2005 article in The Wall Street Journal (“Little Cam-
pus Lab Shakes Big Firms”) described how Ford, General
Motors, and several other companies overstated their oper-
ating cash flows, the most important section of the cash flow
statement. Indeed, GM reported more than twice as much
cash from operations as it really generated, $7.6 billion versus
a true $3.5 billion. When GM sold cars to a dealer on credit, it
created an account receivable, which should be shown in the
“Operating Activities” section as a use of cash. However, GM
classified these receivables as loans to dealers and reported
them as a financing activity. That decision more than
doubled its reported cash flow from operations. It didn’t
affect the end-of-year cash balance, but it made operations
look stronger than they really were.
If Allied Foods, in Table 3.3, had done this, the $60
million increase in receivables, which is correctly shown
as a use of cash, would have been shifted to the “Finan-
cing Activities” section, causing Allied’s cash provided by
operations to rise from −$2.5 million to +$57.5 million.
That would have made Allied look better to investors
and credit analysts, but it would have been just smoke
and mirrors.
GM’s treatment was first reported by Charles Mulford, a
professor at Georgia Tech. The SEC then sent GM a letter
requiring it to change its procedures. The company
issued a statement saying it thought that it was acting
in accordance with GAAP but that it would reclassify its
accounts in the future. GM’s action was not in the league
of WorldCom’s or Enron’s fraudulent accounting prac-
tices, but it does show that companies sometimes do
things to make their statements look better than they
really are.

of variation between companies depending on each company’s needs for retained earnings to support
growth. We cover dividends in detail in Chapter 14.

3-5 STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Changes in stockholders’ equity during the accounting period are reported in
the statement of stockholders’ equity. Table 3.4 shows that Allied earned
$117 5 million during 2014, paid out $57 5 million in common dividends, and
plowed $60 million back into the business. Thus, the balance sheet item “Retained
earnings” increased from $750 million at year-end 2013 to $810 million at year-end
2014.12
Note that “retained earnings” represents a claim against assets, not assets per
se. Stockholders allow management to retain earnings and reinvest them in the
business, use retained earnings for additions to plant and equipment, add to
inventories, and the like. Companies do not just pile up cash in a bank account.
Thus, retained earnings as reported on the balance sheet do not represent cash and are not
“available” for dividends or anything else.13

What is the statement of cash flows, and what are some questions it answers?
Identify and briefly explain the four sections shown in the statement of cash
flows.
If during the year a company has high cash flows from its operations, does this
mean that cash on its balance sheet will be higher at the end of the year than it
was at the beginning of the year? Explain.

Treasury Stock. Also, additional rows would have contained information on such things as new issues
of stock, treasury stock acquired or reissued, stock options exercised, and unrealized foreign exchange
gains or losses.
13Cash (as of the balance sheet date) is found in the cash account, an asset account. A positive number
in the retained earnings account indicates only that the firm has in the past earned income and has not
paid it all out as dividends. Even though a company reports record earnings and shows an increase in
retained earnings, it still may be short of cash if it is using its available cash to purchase current and
fixed assets to support growth. The same situation holds for individuals. You might own a new BMW
(no loan), many clothes, and an expensive stereo (hence, have a high net worth); but if you had only
$0.23 in your pocket plus $5.00 in your checking account, you would still be short of cash.

3-6 USES AND LIMITATIONS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As we mentioned in the opening vignette to this chapter, financial statements
provide a great deal of useful information. You can inspect the statements and
answer a number of important questions such as these: How large is the com-
pany? Is it growing? Is it making or losing money? Is it generating cash through its
operations or are operations actually losing cash?
At the same time, investors need to be cautious when they review financial
statements. While companies are required to follow GAAP, managers still have a
lot of discretion in deciding how and when to report certain transactions. (For an
example, see the box in Section 3-4, “Massaging the Cash Flow Statement,” on
GM’s treatment of receivables.)
Consequently, two firms in exactly the same situation may report financial
statements that convey different impressions about their financial strength. Some
variations may stem from legitimate differences of opinion about the correct way
to record transactions. In other cases, managers may choose to report numbers in a
manner that helps them present either higher or more stable earnings over time.
As long as they follow GAAP, such actions are legal, but these differences make it
difficult for investors to compare companies and gauge their true performances. In
particular, watch out if senior managers receive bonuses or other compensation
based on earnings in the short run—they may try to boost short-term reported
income to boost their bonuses.
Unfortunately, there have also been cases where managers disregarded GAAP
and reported fraudulent statements. One blatant example of cheating involved
WorldCom, which reported asset values that exceeded their true value by about
$11 billion. This led to an understatement of costs and a corresponding over-
statement of profits. Enron is another high-profile example. It overstated the value
of certain assets, reported those artificial value increases as profits, and transferred
the assets to subsidiary companies to hide the true facts. Enron’s and WorldCom’s
investors eventually learned what was happening, the companies were forced into
bankruptcy, many of their top executives went to jail, the accounting firm that
audited their books was forced out of business, and investors lost billions of
dollars.
After the Enron and WorldCom fiascos, Congress in 2002 passed the Sar-
banes–Oxley Act (SOX), which required companies to improve their internal
auditing standards and required the CEO and CFO to certify that the financial
statements were properly prepared. The SOX bill also created a new watchdog
organization to help make sure that the outside accounting firms were doing
their jobs.
More recently, a serious debate has arisen regarding the appropriate account-
ing for complicated investments held by financial institutions. In the recent finan-
cial crisis, many of these investments (particularly those related to subprime
mortgages) turned out to be worth a lot less than their stated book value.

Currently, regulators and other policy makers are struggling to come up with the
best way to account for and regulate many of these “toxic assets.”14
Finally, keep in mind that even if investors receive accurate accounting data, it
is cash flows, not accounting income, that matters most. Similarly, as we shall see
in Chapters 11 and 12, when managers make capital budgeting decisions on which
projects to accept, their focus should be on cash flow.
3-7 FREE CASH FLOW
Thus far, we have focused on financial statements as they are prepared by
accountants. However, accounting statements are designed primarily for use by
creditors and tax collectors, not for managers and stock analysts. Therefore,
corporate decision makers and security analysts often modify accounting data to
meet their needs. The most important modification is the concept of free cash
flow (FCF), defined as “the amount of cash that could be withdrawn without
harming a firm’s ability to operate and to produce future cash flows.” Here is the
equation used to calculate free cash flow:
FCF
EBIT 1
T
Depreciation
and amortization
Capital
expenditures
Net operating
working capital
3.3
The first term represents the amount of cash that the firm generates from its
current operations. EBIT (1 −T) is often referred to as NOPAT, or net operating
profit after taxes. Depreciation and amortization are added back because these are
noncash expenses that reduce EBIT but do not reduce the amount of cash the
company has available to pay its investors. The second bracketed term indicates
the amount of cash that the company is investing in its fixed assets (capital
expenditures) and operating working capital in order to sustain ongoing opera-
tions. A positive level of FCF indicates that the firm is generating more than
enough cash to finance current investments in fixed assets and working capital.
By contrast, negative free cash flow means that the company does not have
sufficient internal funds to finance investments in fixed assets and working capi-
tal, and that it will have to raise new money in the capital markets in order to pay
for these investments.
Consider the case of Home Depot. The first bracketed term in Equation 3.3 represents the
amount of cash that Home Depot is generating from its existing stores. The second
bracketed term represents the amount of cash that the company is spending this period
to construct new stores. When Home Depot opens a new store it needs cash to purchase
the land and construct the building—these are capital expenditures and they lead to a
S E L F T E S T
Can investors be confident that if the financial statements of different
companies are accurate and are prepared in accordance with GAAP, that the
data reported by one company will be comparable to the data provided by
another?
Why might different companies account for similar transactions in different
ways?
Net Operating Profit After
Taxes (NOPAT)
The profit a company
would generate if it had
no debt and held only
operating assets.

measurement should be applied where its use is already required. It does not extend the use of fair
value accounting.

The amount of cash that
could be withdrawn

ability to operate and to
produce future cash flows.

corresponding increase in the firm’s fixed assets on the balance sheet. However, when it
opens a new store the company also needs to increase its net operating working capital. In
particular, the company needs to stock the store with new inventory. Part of this inventory
may be financed through accounts payable—for example, a supplier might ship Home
Depot some flashlights today and allow Home Depot to pay for them later. In this case,
there would be no increase in net operating working capital because the increase in current
assets exactly equals the increase in current liabilities. Other portions of their inventory
may not have an offsetting accounts payable, so there will be an increase in net operating
working capital, and the company must come up with the cash today in order to pay for
this increase. Putting everything together, the company as a whole is generating positive
free cash flow if the money generated from operating existing stores exceeds the money
required to build new stores.
Looking at Allied’s key financial statements, we can collect the pieces that we
need to calculate its free cash flow. First, we can obtain Allied’s EBIT and
depreciation and amortization expense from the income statement. Looking at
Table 3.2, we see that Allied’s 2014 operating income (EBIT) was $283 8 million.
Because Allied’s tax rate is 40%, it follows that its NOPAT
EBIT 1
T
$283 8 1
0 4
$170 3 million. We also see that Allied’s depreciation and amor-
tization expense in 2014 was $100 million.
Allied’s capital expenditures (the cash used to purchase new fixed assets)
can be found under the investment activities on the Statement of Cash Flows.
Looking at Table 3.3, we see that Allied’s capital expenditures in 2014 totaled
$230 million.15 Finally, we need to calculate the change in net operating working
capital ΔNOWC . Recall that NOWC is current assets minus non-interest-bearing
current liabilities (where non-interest-bearing current liabilities are calculated as
current liabilities minus notes payable). We showed earlier that Allied’s NOWC
for 2014 was:
NOWC2014
$1,000
$310
$110
$800 million
Likewise, its NOWC for 2013 can be calculated as:
NOWC2013
$810
$220
$60
$650 million
Thus, Allied’s change in net operating working capital (ΔNOWC) = $150 million
$800 million
$650 million . Putting everything together, we can now calculate
Allied’s 2014 free cash flow:
FCF
EBIT 1
T
Depreciation
and amortization
Capital
expenditures
Net operating
working capital
FCF2014
$170 3
$100
$230
$150
$109 7 million
Allied’s FCF is negative, which is not good. Note, though, that the negative FCF is
largely attributable to the $230 million expenditure for a new processing plant.
This plant is large enough to meet production for several years, so another new
plant will not be needed until 2018. Therefore, Allied’s FCF for 2015 and the next
few years should increase, which means that Allied’s financial situation is not as
bad as the negative FCF might suggest.
Most rapidly growing companies have negative FCFs—the fixed assets and
working capital needed to support a firm’s rapid growth generally exceed cash
15Alternatively, we can calculate Allied's capital expenditures by looking at changes in net fixed assets
on the balance sheet between 2013 and 2014 and then adding back depreciation and amortization for
2014. In this example, Allied’s net fixed assets increased $130 million (from $870 million in 2013 to $1
billion in 2014), and its depreciation and amortization totaled $100 million in 2014. Consequently, gross
capital expenditures were $130 million + $100 million = $230 million.

Q U E S T I O N :
A company has EBIT of $30 million, depreciation of $5 million, and a 40% tax rate. It needs
to spend $10 million on new fixed assets and $15 million to increase its current assets. It
expects its accounts payable to increase by $2 million, its accruals to increase by $3 million,
and its notes payable to increase by $8 million. The firm’s current liabilities consist of only
accounts payable, accruals, and notes payable. What is its free cash flow?

FREE CASH FLOW IS IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESSES BOTH SMALL AND LARGE
Free cash flow is important to large companies like Allied
Foods. Security analysts use FCF to help estimate the value
of the stock, and Allied’s managers use it to assess the value
of proposed capital budgeting projects and potential mer-
ger candidates. Note, though, that the concept is also rele-
vant for small businesses.
Assume that your aunt and uncle own a small pizza shop
and that their accountant prepares their financial statements.
The income statement shows their accounting profit for each
year. While they are certainly interested in this number, what
they probably care more about is how much money they can
take out of the business each year to maintain their standard
of living. Let’s assume that the shop’s net income for 2014
was $75,000. However, your aunt and uncle had to spend
$50,000 to refurbish the kitchen and restrooms.
So while the business is generating a great deal of “profit,”
your aunt and uncle can’t take much money out because
they have to put money back into the pizza shop. Stated
another way, their free cash flow is much less than their net
income. The required investments could be so large that
they even exceed the money made from selling pizza. In this
case, your aunt and uncle’s free cash flow would be nega-
tive. If so, this means they must find funds from other
sources just to maintain their pizza business.
As astute business owners, your aunt and uncle recognize
that their restaurant investments, such as updating the
kitchen and restrooms, are nonrecurring; and if nothing else
happens unexpectedly, your aunt and uncle should be able to
take more cash out of the business in future years, when their
free cash flow increases. But some businesses never seem to
produce cash for their owners—they consistently generate
positive net income, but this net income is swamped by the
amount of cash that has to be plowed back into the business.
Thus, when it comes to valuing the pizza shop (or any busi-
ness small or large), what really matters is the amount of free
cash flow that the business generates over time.
Looking ahead, your aunt and uncle face competition
from national chains that are moving into the area. To meet
the competition, your aunt and uncle will have to modernize
the dining room. This will again drain cash from the business
and reduce its free cash flow, although the hope is that it
will enable them to increase sales and free cash flow in the
years ahead. As we will see in Chapters 11 and 12 which
cover capital budgeting, evaluating projects require us to
estimate whether the future increases in free cash flow are
sufficient to more than offset the initial project cost. There-
fore, the free cash flow calculation is critical to a firm’s
capital budgeting analysis.

Many analysts regard FCF as being the single most important number that
can be developed from accounting statements, even more important than net
income. After all, FCF shows how much cash the firm can distribute to its
investors. We will discuss FCF again in Chapter 9, which covers stock valuation,
and in Chapters 11 and 12, which cover capital budgeting.
3-8 MVA AND EVA
Items reported on the financial statements reflect historical, in-the-past, values, not
current market values, and there are often substantial differences between the two.
Changes in interest rates and inflation affect the market value of the company’s
assets and liabilities but often have no effect on the corresponding book values
shown in the financial statements. Perhaps, more importantly, the market’s assess-
ment of value takes into account its ongoing assessment of current operations as
well as future opportunities. For example, it cost Microsoft very little to develop
its first operating system, but that system turned out to be worth many billions
that were not shown on its balance sheet. For a given level of debt, these increases
in asset value also lead to a corresponding increase in the market value of equity.
To illustrate, consider the following situation. A firm was started with
$1 million of assets at book value (historical cost), $500,000 of which was provided
by bondholders, and $500,000 by stockholders (50,000 shares purchased at
$10 per share). However, this firm became very successful; the market value of
the firm’s equity is now worth $19 5 million, and its current stock price is
$19,500,000 50,000
$390 per share. Clearly the firm’s managers have done a
marvelous job for the stockholders.
The accounting statements do not reflect market values, so they are not
sufficient for purposes of evaluating managers’ performance. To help fill this void,
financial analysts have developed two additional performance measures, the first
of which is MVA, or Market Value Added.16 MVA is simply the difference
between the market value of a firm’s equity and the book value as shown
on the balance sheet, with market value found by multiplying the stock price
by the number of shares outstanding. For our hypothetical firm, MVA is
$19 5 million
$0 5 million
$19 million.
For Allied, which has 50 million shares outstanding and a stock price of
$23 06, the market value of the equity is $1,153 million versus a book value as
shown on the balance sheet in Table 3.1 of $940 million. Therefore, Allied’s MVA
is $1,153
$940
$213 million. This $213 million represents the difference
between the money Allied’s stockholders have invested in the corporation since
S E L F T E S T
What is free cash flow (FCF)?
Why is FCF an important determinant of a firm’s value?
Market Value Added (MVA)
The excess of the market
value of equity over its
book value.
16The concepts of EVA and MVA were developed by Joel Stern and Bennett Stewart, co-founders of the
consulting firm Stern Stewart & Company. Stern Stewart copyrighted the terms “MVA” and “EVA,” so
other consulting firms have given other names to these values. Still, MVA and EVA are the terms most
commonly used in practice. For more on MVA and EVA, see G. Bennett Stewart, The Quest for Value
(New York: HarperCollins, 1991, 1999).

its founding—including retained earnings—versus the cash they could receive if
they sold the business. The higher its MVA, the better the job management is
doing for the firm’s shareholders. Boards of directors often look at MVA when
deciding on the compensation a firm’s managers deserve. Note though, that just
as all ships rise in a rising tide, most firms’ stock prices rise in a rising stock
market, so a positive MVA may not be entirely attributable to management
performance.
A related concept, Economic Value Added (EVA), sometimes called “economic
profit,” is closely related to MVA and is found as follows:17
EVA
Net operating profit
after taxes
NOPAT
Annual dollar
cost of
capital
EBIT 1
T
Total
invested
capital
After-tax
percentage
cost of capital
3.4
Companies create value (and realize positive EVA) if the benefits of their invest-
ments exceed the cost of raising the necessary capital. Total invested capital repre-
sents the amount of money that the company has raised from debt, equity, and any
other sources of capital (such as preferred stock). The annual dollar cost of capital is
total invested capital multiplied by the after-tax percentage cost of this capital. So,
for example, if the company has raised $1 million in capital, and the current cost of
capital is 10%, the annual dollar cost of capital would be $100,000. The funds raised
from this capital are invested in a variety of net fixed assets and net operating
working capital. In any given year, NOPAT is the amount of money that these
investments have generated for the company’s investors after paying for operating
costs and taxes—in this regard it represents the benefits of capital investments.
EVA is an estimate of a business’ true economic profit for a given year, and it
often differs sharply from accounting net income. The main reason for this differ-
ence is that while accounting income takes into account the cost of debt (the
company’s interest expense), it does not deduct for the cost of equity capital. By
contrast, EVA takes into account the total dollar cost of all capital which includes
both the cost of debt and equity capital.
If EVA is positive, then after-tax operating income exceeds the cost of the capital
needed to produce that income, and management’s actions are adding value for
stockholders. Positive EVA on an annual basis will help ensure that MVA is also
positive. Note that whereas MVA applies to the entire firm, EVA can be determined
for divisions as well as for the company as a whole, so it is useful as a guide to
“reasonable” compensation for divisional as well as top corporate managers.
S E L F T E S T
Define the terms Market Value Added (MVA) and Economic Value Added (EVA).
How does EVA differ from accounting net income?
17Another top consulting company, McKinsey & Company, uses the term “economic profit.” Their
definition of economic profit is:
Total invested capital
Return on invested capital
Cost of capital
Because the return on invested capital is [EBIT(1 – T)]/Total invested capital, you can show with a little
bit of algebra that EVA and economic profit are identical.

Excess of NOPAT over
capital costs.

3-9 INCOME TAXES
Individuals and corporations pay out a significant portion of their income as taxes,
so taxes are important in both personal and corporate decisions. We summarize
the key aspects of the U.S. tax system for individuals in this section and for
corporations in the next section, using 2013 data. The details of our tax laws
change fairly often—annually for items that are indexed for inflation—but the
basic nature of the tax system is likely to remain intact.
3-9A INDIVIDUAL TAXES
Individuals pay taxes on wages and salaries, on investment income (dividends,
interest, and profits from the sale of securities), and on the profits of proprietor-
ships and partnerships. The tax rates are progressive—that is, the higher one’s
income, the larger the percentage paid in taxes. Table 3.5 provides the 2013 tax
rates that taxpayers will pay for tax returns due April 15, 2014.
Taxable income is defined as “gross income less a set of exemptions and
deductions.” When filing a tax return in 2014 for the tax year 2013, taxpayers
received an exemption of $3,900 for each dependent, including the taxpayer,
which reduces taxable income. However, this exemption is indexed to rise with
inflation, and the exemption is phased out (taken away) for high-income tax-
payers. Also, certain expenses, including mortgage interest paid, state and local
income taxes paid, and charitable contributions, can be deducted and thus be used
to reduce taxable income; but again, high-income taxpayers lose most of these
deductions.
The marginal tax rate is defined as “the tax rate on the last dollar of income.”
Marginal rates begin at 10% and rise to 39 6%. Note, though, that when considera-
tion is given to the phase-out of exemptions and deductions, to Social Security and
Medicare taxes, and to state taxes, the marginal tax rate may actually exceed 50%.
Average tax rates can be calculated from the data in Table 3.5. For example, if
a single individual had taxable income of $37,000, his or her tax bill would
be $4,991 25
$37,000
$36,250 0 25
$4,991 25
$187 50
$5,178 75.
Her
average tax rate would be $5,178 75 $37,000
14
versus a marginal rate of
25%. If she received a raise of $1,000, bringing her income to $38,000, she would
have to pay $250 of it as taxes; so her after-tax raise would be $750.
Note too that interest income received by individuals from corporate securities is
added to other income and thus is taxed at federal rates going up to 39 6%, plus
state taxes.18 Capital gains and losses, on the other hand, are treated differently. Assets
such as stocks, bonds, and real estate are defined as capital assets. When you buy a
capital asset and later sell it for more than you paid, you earn a profit that is called a
capital gain; when you suffer a loss, it is called a capital loss. If you held the asset
for a year or less, you will have a short-term gain or loss, while if you held it for more
than a year, you will have a long-term gain or loss. Thus, if you buy 100 shares of
Disney stock for $51 per share and sell them for $61 per share, you have a capital
gain of 100 × $10, or $1,000. However, if you sell the stock for $41 per share, you
will have a $1,000 capital loss. Depending on how long you hold the stock, you will
have a short-term or long-term gain or loss.19 If you sell the stock for exactly $51 per
share, you make neither a gain nor a loss; so no tax is due.

Capital Gain or Loss
The profit (loss) from the
sale of a capital asset for
more (less) than its
purchase price.
18Under U.S. tax laws, interest on most state and local government bonds, called municipals or
“munis,” is not subject to federal income taxes. This has a significant effect on the values of munis
and on their rates of return. We discuss rates and returns in Chapter 8.
19lf you have a net capital loss (your capital losses exceed your capital gains) for the year, you can
deduct up to $3,000 of this loss against your other income (for example, salary, interest, and
dividends).
Progressive
A tax system where the
tax rate is higher on
higher incomes. The
personal income tax in the
United States, which
ranges from 0% on the
lowest incomes to 39.6%
on the highest incomes, is
progressive.
Marginal Tax Rate
The tax rate applicable to
the last unit of a person’s
income.
Average Tax Rate
Taxes paid divided by
taxable income.

A short-term capital gain is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.
However, long-term capital gains are taxed differently. For most taxpayers, the
rate on long-term capital gains is only 15%. Thus, if in 2013, you were in the 35%
tax bracket, any short-term capital gains you earned would be taxed just like
ordinary income; but your long-term capital gains would only be taxed at 15%.
However, beginning in 2013, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains
was increased to 20% for single taxpayers with incomes over $400,000 and mar-
ried taxpayers with incomes over $450,000. But even for individuals at these top
tax brackets, the tax rate on long-term capital gains still remains considerably
lower than the tax rate on ordinary income.
Beginning in 2013, the maximum tax rate on qualified dividends increased to
20% for single taxpayers with incomes over $400,000 and married taxpayers with

Notes:
1. These are the 2013 tax rates that will be paid on tax returns due April 15, 2014. The income
ranges at which each tax rate takes effect are indexed with inflation, so they change each year.
2. The average tax rates are always below the marginal rates, but in 2013 the average at the top
of the brackets approaches 39.6% as taxable income rises without limit.
3. In 2013, a personal exemption of $3,900 per person or dependent could be deducted from
gross income to determine taxable income. Thus, a husband and wife with two children
would have a 2013 exemption of 4 × $3,900 = $15,600. The exemption increases with
inflation, but if gross income exceeds certain limits, the exemption is phased out, and this
has the effect of raising the effective tax rate on incomes over the specified limit. In addition,
taxpayers can claim itemized deductions for charitable contributions and certain other items,
but these deductions are also phased out for high-income taxpayers. In addition, there are
Social Security and Medicare taxes. These additional situations and payroll taxes push the
2013 effective tax rate up well above 39.6%.

incomes over $450,000.20 However, for most taxpayers the top tax rate on qualified
dividends is 15%. Because corporations pay dividends out of earnings that have
already been taxed, there is double taxation of corporate income—income is first taxed
at the corporate rate; and when what is left is paid out as dividends, it is taxed
again. This double taxation motivated Congress to tax dividends at a lower rate
than the rate on ordinary income.
Tax rates on dividends and capital gains have varied over time, but they have
generally been lower than rates on ordinary income. Congress wants the economy
to grow. For growth, we need investment in productive assets; and low capital
gains and dividend tax rates encourage investment. Individuals with money to
invest understand the tax advantages associated with making equity investments
in newly formed companies versus buying bonds, so new ventures have an easier
time attracting capital under the tax system. All in all, lower capital gains and
dividend tax rates stimulate capital formation and investment.
One other tax feature should be addressed—the Alternative Minimum
Tax (AMT). The AMT was created in 1969 because Congress learned that
155 millionaires with high incomes paid no taxes because they had so many
tax shelters from items such as depreciation on real estate and municipal bond
interest. Under the AMT law, people must calculate their tax under the “regular”
system and then under the AMT system, where many deductions are added
back to income and then taxed at a special AMT rate. For many years, the AMT
was not indexed for inflation; and literally millions of taxpayers found them-
selves subject to this very complex tax.21
The new tax legislation also increased health care taxes for single taxpayers
earning more than $200,000 and married taxpayers earning more than $250,000.
These taxpayers will incur an additional 0.9% Medicare tax and a 3.8% investment
income tax on certain types of investment income.
3-9B CORPORATE TAXES
The corporate tax structure, shown in Table 3.6, is relatively simple. To illustrate, if
a firm had $65,000 of taxable income, its tax bill would be $11,250.

. Note that corporate
income above $18,333,333 has an average and marginal tax rate of 35%.
Interest and Dividends Received by a Corporation
Corporations earn most of their income from operations, but they may also own
securities—bonds and stocks—and receive interest and dividend income. Interest
income received by a corporation is taxed as ordinary income at regular corporate
tax rates. However, dividends are taxed more favorably: 70% of dividends received is
excluded from taxable income, while the remaining 30% is taxed at the ordinary tax rate.22
20For a dividend to be “qualified,” the investor must have owned the stock for more than 60 days
during a 121-day period that begins 60 days prior to the ex-dividend date. We discuss dividends in
Chapter 14; however, for now understand that the ex-dividend date is the date when the right to the
current dividend leaves the stock.
21Beginning in 2013, the AMT exemption amounts are indexed to inflation.
In 2013, the AMT
exemption amounts are $51,900 for single taxpayers, $80,800 for those married and filing jointly, and
$40,400 for those married and filing separately. The corporate AMT exemption is $40,000 and is phased
out with alternative minimum taxable income between $150,000 and $310,000.
22The exclusion depends on the percentage of the paying company’s stock the receiving company
owns. If it owns 100% (hence, the payer is a subsidiary), all of the dividend will be excluded. If it owns
less than 20%, which is the case if the stock held is just an investment, 70% will be excluded. Also, state
tax rules vary; but in our example, we assume that Allied also has a state tax exclusion.

of its

its after-tax (A-T) dividend income would be $8,800.
A-T income
B-T income 1
T
$10,000 1

The rationale behind this exclusion is that when a corporation receives divi-
dends and then pays out its own after-tax income as dividends to its stockholders,
the dividends received are subjected to triple taxation: (1) The original corporation
is taxed, (2) the second corporation is taxed on the dividends it receives, and
(3) the individuals who receive the final dividends are taxed again. This explains
the 70% intercorporate dividend exclusion.
Suppose a firm has excess cash that it does not need for operations, and it
plans to invest this cash in marketable securities. The tax factor favors stocks,
which pay dividends, rather than bonds, which pay interest. For example, sup-
pose Allied had $100,000 to invest, and it could buy bonds that paid 8% interest,
or $8,000 per year, or stock that paid 7% in dividends, or $7,000. Allied is in the
40% federal-plus-state tax bracket. Therefore, if Allied bought bonds and received
interest, its tax on the $8,000 of interest would be 0 4 $8,000
$3,200 and its
after-tax income would be $4,800. If it bought stock, its tax would be
$7,000 0 12
$840 and its after-tax income would be $6,160. Other factors might
lead Allied to invest in bonds, but when the investor is a corporation the tax factor favors
stock investments.
Interest and Dividends Paid by a Corporation
A firm like Allied can finance its operations with either debt or stock. If a firm uses
debt, it must pay interest, whereas if it uses stock, it is expected to pay dividends.
Interest paid can be deducted from operating income to obtain taxable income, but dividends
paid cannot be deducted. Therefore, Allied would need $1 of pretax income to pay
$1 of interest; but because it is in the 40% federal-plus-state tax bracket, it must
earn $1 67 of pretax income to pay $1 of dividends:
Pretax income needed
to pay $1 of dividends

Working backward, if Allied has $1 67 in pretax income, it must pay $0 67 in

Table 3.7 shows the situation for a firm with $10 million of assets, sales of
$5 million, and $1 5 million of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). As
shown in Column 1, if the firm were financed entirely by bonds and if it made
interest payments of $1 5 million, its taxable income would be zero, taxes
would be zero, and its investors would receive the entire $1 5 million. (The
term investors includes both stockholders and bondholders.) However, as shown
in Column 2, if the firm had no debt and was therefore financed entirely by
stock, all of the $1 5 million of EBIT would be taxable income to the corporation,
the tax would be $1,500,000 0 40
$600,000, and investors would receive only
$0 9 million versus $1 5 million under debt financing. Therefore, the rate of
return to investors on their $10 million investment is much higher when debt
is used.
Of course, it is generally not possible to finance exclusively with debt;
and the risk of doing so would offset the benefits of the higher expected
income. Still, the fact that interest is a deductible expense has a profound effect
on the way businesses are financed—the corporate tax system favors debt financing
over equity financing. This point is discussed in more detail in Chapters 10
and 13.23
Corporate Capital Gains
Before 1987, corporate long-term capital gains were taxed at lower rates than
corporate ordinary income; so the situation was similar for corporations and
individuals. Currently, though, corporations’ capital gains are taxed at the same
rates as their operating income.
Corporate Loss Carry-Back and Carry-Forward
Ordinary corporate operating losses can be carried back (carry-back) to each of
the preceding 2 years and carried forward (carry-forward) for the next 20 years
and used to offset taxable income in those years. For example, an operating loss
in 2014 could be carried back and used to reduce taxable income in 2012 and
2013; it also could be carried forward, if necessary, and used in 2015, 2016, up
until 2034. The loss is applied to the earliest year first, then to the next earliest
year, and so forth, until losses have been used up or the 20-year carry-forward
limit has been reached.

23A company could, in theory, refrain from paying dividends to help prevent its stockholders from
having to pay taxes on dividends received. The IRS has a rule against the improper accumulation of
retained earnings. However, in our experience, it is easy for firms to justify retaining earnings; and we
have never seen a firm have a problem with the improper accumulation rule.

To illustrate, suppose Company X had $2 million of pretax profits (taxable
income) in 2012 and 2013 and then in 2014, it lost $12 million. Its federal-plus-
state tax rate is 40%. As shown in Table 3.8, Company X would use the carry-
back feature to recompute its taxes for 2012, using $2 million of the 2014
operating losses to reduce the 2012 pretax profit to zero. This would permit it
to recover the taxes paid in 2012. Therefore, in 2014, it would receive a refund
of its 2012 taxes because of the loss experienced in 2014. Because $10 million
of the unrecovered losses would still be available, X would repeat this proce-
dure for 2013. Thus, in 2014, the company would pay zero taxes for 2014 and
would receive a refund for taxes paid in 2012 and 2013. It would still have $8
million of unrecovered losses to carry forward, subject to the 20-year limit.
This $8 million could be used until the entire $12 million loss had been used to
offset taxable income. The purpose of permitting this loss treatment is to avoid
penalizing corporations whose incomes fluctuate substantially from year to
year.
Consolidated Corporate Tax Returns
If a corporation owns 80% or more of another corporation’s stock, it can aggregate
income and file one consolidated tax return. This allows the losses of one company
to be used to offset the profits of another. (Similarly, one division’s losses can be
used to offset another division’s profits.) No business wants to incur losses; but tax
offsets make it more feasible for large, multidivisional corporations to undertake
risky new ventures or ventures that will suffer losses during a developmental
period.
Taxation of Small Businesses: S Corporations
As we noted in Chapter 1, the Tax Code allows small businesses that meet certain
conditions to be set up as corporations and thus receive the benefits of the
corporate form of organization—especially limited liability—yet still be taxed as
proprietorships or partnerships rather than as corporations. These corporations
are called S corporations. (Regular corporations are called C corporations.) If a
corporation elects to set up as an S corporation, all of its income is reported as
personal income by its stockholders, on a pro rata basis, and thus is taxed at the
stockholders’ individual rates. Because the income is taxed only once, this is an
important benefit to the owners of small corporations in which all or most of the

income earned each year will be distributed as dividends. The situation is similar
for LLCs.
Depreciation
Depreciation plays an important role in income tax calculations—the larger the
depreciation, the lower the taxable income, the lower the tax bill, and thus the
higher the operating cash flow. Congress specifies the life over which assets can be
depreciated for tax purposes and the depreciation methods that can be used. We
will discuss in detail how depreciation is calculated and how it affects income and
cash flows when we study capital budgeting.
The primary purposes of this chapter were to describe the basic financial state-
ments, to present background information on cash flows, to differentiate between
cash flow and accounting income, and to provide an overview of the federal
income tax system. In the next chapter, we build on this information to analyze a
firm’s financial statements and to determine its financial health.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
You have just been hired as a financial analyst for Basel
Industries. Unfortunately, company headquarters (where all of the firm’s records are kept)
has been destroyed by fire. So, your first job will be to recreate the firm’s cash flow
statement for the year just ended. The firm had $100,000 in the bank at the end of the prior
year and its working capital accounts except cash remained constant during the year. It
earned $5 million in net income during the year but paid $750,000 in dividends to common
shareholders. Throughout the year, the firm purchased $5 5 million of machinery that was
needed for a new project. You have just spoken to the firm’s accountants and learned that
annual depreciation expense for the year is $450,000; however, the purchase price for the
machinery represents additions to property, plant, and equipment before depreciation.
Finally, you have determined that the only financing done by the firm was to issue long-
term debt of $1 million at a 6% interest rate. What was the firm’s end-of-year cash balance?
Recreate the firm’s cash flow statement to arrive at your answer.

D’LEON INC., PART I
3-18
Financial Statements and Taxes
Donna Jamison, a 2009 graduate of the University of Florida with 4 years of
banking experience, was recently brought in as assistant to the chairperson of the board of D’Leon Inc., a small food
producer that operates in north Florida and whose specialty is high-quality pecan and other nut products sold in the
snack foods market. D’Leon’s president, Al Watkins, decided in 2013 to undertake a major expansion and to “go
national” in competition with Frito-Lay, Eagle, and other major snack foods companies. Watkins believed that
D’Leon’s products were of higher quality than the competition’s; that this quality differential would enable it to
charge a premium price; and that the end result would be greatly increased sales, profits, and stock price.
The company doubled its plant capacity, opened new sales offices outside its home territory, and launched an
expensive advertising campaign. D’Leon’s results were not satisfactory, to put it mildly. Its board of directors, which
consisted of its president, vice president, and major stockholders (all of whom were local businesspeople), was most
upset when directors learned how the expansion was going. Unhappy suppliers were being paid late; and the bank
was complaining about the deteriorating situation, threatening to cut off credit. As a result, Watkins was informed
that changes would have to be made—and quickly; otherwise, he would be fired. Also, at the board’s insistence,
Donna Jamison was brought in and given the job of assistant to Fred Campo, a retired banker who was D’Leon’s
chairperson and largest stockholder. Campo agreed to give up a few of his golfing days and help nurse the company
back to health, with Jamison’s help.
Jamison began by gathering the financial statements and other data given in Tables IC 3.1, IC 3.2, IC 3.3, and
IC 3.4. Assume that you are Jamison’s assistant. You must help her answer the following questions for Campo.
(Note: We will continue with this case in Chapter 4, and you will feel more comfortable with the analysis there.
But answering these questions will help prepare you for Chapter 4. Provide clear explanations.)
a.
What effect did the expansion have on sales, after-tax operating income, net operating working capital (NOWC),
and net income?
b.
What effect did the company’s expansion have on its free cash flow?
c.
D’Leon purchases materials on 30-day terms, meaning that it is supposed to pay for purchases within 30 days of
receipt. Judging from its 2014 balance sheet, do you think that D’Leon pays suppliers on time? Explain, including
what problems might occur if suppliers are not paid in a timely manner.
d.
D’Leon spends money for labor, materials, and fixed assets (depreciation) to make products—and spends still
more money to sell those products. Then the firm makes sales that result in receivables, which eventually result
in cash inflows. Does it appear that D’Leon’s sales price exceeds its costs per unit sold? How does this affect the
cash balance?
e.
Suppose D’Leon’s sales manager told the sales staff to start offering 60-day credit terms rather than the 30-day
terms now being offered. D’Leon’s competitors react by offering similar terms, so sales remain constant. What
effect would this have on the cash account? How would the cash account be affected if sales doubled as a result
of the credit policy change?
f.
Can you imagine a situation in which the sales price exceeds the cost of producing and selling a unit of output,
yet a dramatic increase in sales volume causes the cash balance to decline? Explain.
g.
Did D’Leon finance its expansion program with internally generated funds (additions to retained earnings plus
depreciation) or with external capital? How does the choice of financing affect the company’s financial strength?
h.
Refer to Tables IC 3.2 and IC 3.4. Suppose D’Leon broke even in 2014 in the sense that sales revenues equaled
total operating costs plus interest charges. Would the asset expansion have caused the company to experience a
cash shortage that required it to raise external capital? Explain.
i.
If D’Leon starts depreciating fixed assets over 7 years rather than 10 years, would that affect (1) the physical
stock of assets, (2) the balance sheet account for fixed assets, (3) the company’s reported net income, and (4) the
company’s cash position? Assume that the same depreciation method is used for stockholder reporting and for
tax calculations and that the accounting change has no effect on assets’ physical lives.
j.
Explain how earnings per share, dividends per share, and book value per share are calculated and what they
mean. Why does the market price per share not equal the book value per share?
k.
Explain briefly the tax treatment of (1) interest and dividends paid, (2) interest earned and dividends received,
(3) capital gains, and (4) tax loss carry-backs and carry-forwards. How might each of these items affect D’Leon’s
taxes?

EXPLORING STARBUCKS’ FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Over the past decade, Starbucks coffee shops have become an increasingly familiar part of the urban
landscape. In 2013, the company operated more than 17,600 coffee shops in all 50 states, in the District of
Columbia, and in international markets, and it had approximately 160,000 employees.
Thomson ONE can access a wealth of financial information for companies such as Starbucks. To find
some background information, begin by entering the company’s ticker symbol, SBUX, and then selecting
“GO.” On the opening screen, you will see a great deal of useful information, including a summary of what
Starbucks does, a chart of its recent stock price, EPS estimates, recent news stories, and a list of key
financial data and ratios.
In researching a company’s operating performance, a good place to start is the recent stock price
performance. At the top of the Stock Price Chart, click on the section labeled “Interactive Chart.” From
this point, you can obtain a chart of the company’s stock price performance relative to the overall market
(as measured by the S&P 500) between 2003 and 2013. To obtain a 10-year chart, go to “Time Frame,”
under “Period:” click on the down arrow, and select “10 years.” Then click on “Draw”; a 10-year price
chart should appear. As you can see, Starbucks has had its ups and downs. But the company’s overall
performance has been quite strong, and it has beaten the overall market handily.
You can also find Starbucks’ recent financial statements. Click on “Financials” to find the company’s
annual balance sheets for the past 5 years. Selecting Thomson Financials provides balance sheets, income
statements, and statements of cash flows for various time periods. Clicking on the Microsoft Excel icon
downloads these statements directly to a spreadsheet.
Discussion Questions
1.
Looking at the most recent year available, what is the amount of total assets on Starbucks’ balance sheet? What
percentage is fixed assets, such as plant and equipment? What percentage is current assets? How much has the
company grown over the years that are shown?
2.
Does Starbucks have very much long-term debt? What are the chief ways in which Starbucks has financed assets?
3.
Looking at the statement of cash flows, what factors can explain the change in the company’s cash position over the
last couple of years?
4.
Looking at the income statement, what are the company’s most recent sales and net income? Over the past several
years, what has been the sales growth rate? What has been the growth rate in net income?
5.
Over the past few years, has there been a strong correlation between stock price performance and reported
earnings? Explain. [Hint: Change the Stock Price Chart so that it corresponds to a 5-year period—just as the
financial statements show 5 years of data.]

Can You Make Money Analyzing Stocks?
For many years, a debate has raged over this
question. Some argue that the stock market is
highly efficient and that all available information
regarding a stock is already reflected in its price.
The “efficient market advocates” point out that
there are thousands of smart, well-trained ana-
lysts working for institutions with billions of dol-
lars. These analysts have access to the latest
information, and they spring into action—buying
or selling—as soon as a firm releases any infor-
mation that has a bearing on its future profits.
The “efficient markets advocates” also point out
that few mutual funds, which hire good people
and pay them well, actually beat the averages. If
these experts earn only average returns, how can
the rest of us expect to beat the market?
Others disagree, arguing that analysis can
pay off. They point out that some fund man-
agers perform better than average year after
year. Also, they note that some “activist” inves-
tors analyze firms carefully, identify those with
weaknesses that appear to be correctable, and
then persuade their managers to take actions to
improve the firms’ performances.
Arguably, the world’s best-known investor
is Warren Buffett. Through his company Berk-
shire Hathaway, Buffett has made significant
investments in a number of well-known com-
panies including Coca-Cola, American Express,
IBM, and Wells Fargo. Buffett is well known for
taking a long-run view of things. His value-
investing approach, which borrows heavily from
the ideas espoused decades ago by Benjamin
Graham, looks for stocks trading at prices that
are significantly lower than their estimated
intrinsic value. Value investors rely heavily on
the type of analysis described in this chapter
to assess a company’s strengths and weak-
nesses and to derive the key inputs for their
estimates of intrinsic value.

Always looking for new opportunities, in June 2013
Berkshire Hathaway partnered with private equity firm 3G
Capital and acquired H.J. Heinz Company for $28 billion.
Heinz is the type of company that Buffett likes. It is an
established business with well-known brands that has gen-
erated solid margins and steady earnings growth. On the
other hand, the deal didn’t come cheap. In the year before
the announced deal, Heinz’ stock had already been doing
quite well—it had risen nearly 18% from a price of $51.70
per share in February 2012 to roughly $61 per share before
the deal was first announced in February 2013. On top of
that strong price, Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital offered
Heinz’ shareholders an additional 20% premium for their
shares. All of this suggests that, in his analysis, Buffett saw
even greater room for improvement.
So, while many people regard financial statements as
“just accounting,” they really are much more. As you will see
in this chapter, these statements provide a wealth of informa-
tion that can be used for a wide variety of purposes by
managers, investors, lenders, customers, suppliers, and regu-
lators. An analysis of its statements can highlight a company’s
strengths and shortcomings, and this information can be used
by management to improve the company’s performance and
by others to predict future results.
The primary goal of financial management is to maximize shareholders’ wealth, not
accounting measures such as net income or earnings per share (EPS). However,
accounting data influence stock prices, and this data can be used to see why a
company is performing the way it is and where it is heading. Chapter 3 described
the key financial statements and showed how they change as a firm’s operations
change. Now, in Chapter 4, we show how the statements are used by managers to
improve the firm’s stock price; by lenders to evaluate the likelihood that borrowers
will be able to pay off loans; and by security analysts to forecast earnings, divi-
dends, and stock prices.
If management is to maximize a firm’s value, it must take advantage of the
firm’s strengths and correct its weaknesses. Financial analysis involves (1) compar-
ing the firm’s performance to that of other firms in the same industry and (2) eval-
uating trends in the firm’s financial position over time. These studies help man-
agers identify deficiencies and take corrective actions. In this chapter, we focus on
how managers and investors evaluate a firm’s financial position. Then, in later
chapters, we examine the types of actions managers can take to improve future
performance and thus increase the firm’s stock price.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Explain what ratio analysis is.
•
List the five groups of ratios and identify, calculate, and interpret the key ratios
in each group.
•
Discuss each ratio’s relationship to the balance sheet and income statement.
•
Discuss why ROE is the key ratio under management’s control and how the
other ratios impact ROE, and explain how to use the DuPont equation for
improving ROE.
•
Compare a firm’s ratios with those of other firms (benchmarking) and analyze a
given firm’s ratios over time (trend analysis).
•
Discuss the tendency of ratios to fluctuate over time (which may or may not be
problematic), explain how they can be influenced by accounting practices as
well as other factors, and explain why they must be used with care.

4-1 RATIO ANALYSIS
Ratios help us evaluate financial statements. For example, at the end of 2014,
Allied Food Products had $860 million of interest-bearing debt and interest
charges of $88 million while Midwest Products had $52 million of interest-bearing
debt and interest charges of $4 million. Which company is stronger? The burden of
these debts and the companies’ ability to repay them can best be evaluated by
comparing each firm’s total debt to its total capital and comparing interest expense
to the income and cash available to pay that interest. Ratios are used to make such
comparisons. We calculate Allied’s ratios for 2014 using data from the balance
sheets and income statements given in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. We also evaluate the
ratios relative to food industry averages, using data in millions of dollars.1 As you
will see, we can calculate many different ratios, with different ones used to
examine different aspects of the firm’s operations. You will get to know some
ratios by name, but it’s better to understand what they are designed to do than to
memorize names and equations.
We divide the ratios into five categories:
1.
Liquidity ratios, which give an idea of the firm’s ability to pay off debts that are
maturing within a year.
2.
Asset management ratios, which give an idea of how efficiently the firm is using
its assets.
3.
Debt management ratios, which give an idea of how the firm has financed its
assets as well as the firm’s ability to repay its long-term debt.
4.
Profitability ratios, which give an idea of how profitably the firm is operating
and utilizing its assets.
5.
Market value ratios, which give an idea of what investors think about the firm
and its future prospects.
Satisfactory liquidity ratios are necessary if the firm is to continue operating.
Good asset management ratios are necessary for the firm to keep its costs low and
thus its net income high. Debt management ratios indicate how risky the firm is
and how much of its operating income must be paid to bondholders rather than
stockholders. Profitability ratios combine the asset and debt management cate-
gories and show their effects on ROE. Finally, market value ratios tell us what
investors think about the company and its prospects.
All of the ratios are important, but different ones are more important for some
companies than for others. For example, if a firm borrowed too much in the past
and its debt now threatens to drive it into bankruptcy, the debt ratios are key.
Similarly, if a firm expanded too rapidly and now finds itself with excess inven-
tory and manufacturing capacity, the asset management ratios take center stage.
The ROE is always important; but a high ROE depends on maintaining liquidity,
on efficient asset management, and on the proper use of debt. Managers are, of
course, vitally concerned with the stock price; but managers have little direct
1Financial statement data for most publicly traded firms can be obtained from the Internet. Free sites
that provide this information include Google Finance (google.com/finance) and Yahoo! Finance
(finance.yahoo.com). These sites provide financial statements, which can be copied to an Excel file
and used to create your own ratios; but the websites also provide calculated ratios.
In addition to the ratios discussed in this chapter, financial analysts often employ a tool known as
common size analysis. To form a common size balance sheet, simply divide each asset, liability, and equity
item by total assets and then express the results as percentages. To develop a common size income
statement, divide each income statement item by sales. The resultant percentage statements can be
compared with statements of larger or smaller firms or with those of the same firm over time. One
would normally obtain the basic statements from a source such as Google Finance and copy them to
Excel, so constructing common size statements is quite easy. Note too that industry average data are
generally given as percentages, which make them easy to compare with a firm’s own common size
statements. We provide Allied Food Products’ common size statements in Web Appendix 4A.

control over the stock market’s performance while they do have control over their
firm’s ROE. So ROE tends to be the main focal point.
4-2 LIQUIDITY RATIOS
The liquidity ratios help answer this question: Will the firm be able to pay off its
debts as they come due and thus remain a viable organization? If the answer is no,
liquidity must be addressed.
A liquid asset is one that trades in an active market and thus can be quickly
converted to cash at the going market price. As shown in Table 3.1 in Chapter 3,
Allied has $310 million of current liabilities that must be paid off within the
coming year. Will it have trouble meeting that obligation? A full liquidity analysis
requires the use of a cash budget, which we discuss in Chapter 15; however, by
relating cash and other current assets to current liabilities, ratio analysis provides a
quick and easy-to-use measure of liquidity. Two of the most commonly used
liquidity ratios are discussed below.
4-2A CURRENT RATIO
The primary liquidity ratio is the current ratio, which is calculated by dividing
current assets by current liabilities:
Current ratio
Current assets
Current liabilities
$1,000
$310
3 2
Industry average
4 2
Current assets include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inven-
tories. Allied’s current liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued wages and
taxes, and short-term notes payable to its bank, all of which are due within one year.
If a company is having financial difficulty, it typically begins to pay its
accounts payable more slowly and to borrow more from its bank, both of which
increase current liabilities. If current liabilities are rising faster than current assets,
the current ratio will fall; and this is a sign of possible trouble. Allied’s current
ratio is 3 2, which is well below the industry average of 4 2. Therefore, its liquidity
position is somewhat weak but by no means desperate.2
Although industry average figures are discussed later in some detail, note that
an industry average is not a magic number that all firms should strive to maintain;
in fact, some very well-managed firms may be above the average while other good
firms are below it. However, if a firm’s ratios are far removed from the averages
for its industry, an analyst should be concerned about why this variance occurs.
Thus, a deviation from the industry average should signal the analyst (or manage-
ment) to check further. Note too that a high current ratio generally indicates a very
strong, safe liquidity position; it might also indicate that the firm has too much old
inventory that will have to be written off and too many old accounts receivable
that may turn into bad debts. Or the high current ratio might indicate that the firm
has too much cash, receivables, and inventory relative to its sales, in which case
these assets are not being managed efficiently. So it is always necessary to
thoroughly examine the full set of ratios before forming a judgment as to how
well the firm is performing.
2Because current assets should be convertible to cash within a year, it is likely that they could be
liquidated at close to their stated value. With a current ratio of 3 2, Allied could liquidate current assets
at only 31% of book value and still pay off current creditors in full: 1 3 2
0 31, or 31%. Note also that
0 31 $1,000
$310, the current liabilities balance.
Liquid Asset
An asset that can be
converted to cash quickly
without having to reduce
the asset’s price very
much.
Liquidity Ratios
Ratios that show the
relationship of a firm’s
cash and other current
assets to its current
liabilities.
Current Ratio
This ratio is calculated by
dividing current assets by
current liabilities. It
indicates the extent to
which current liabilities
are covered by those
assets expected to be
converted to cash in the
near future.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ON THE INTERNET
A wide range of valuable financial information is available
on the Internet. With just a couple of clicks, an investor can
find the key financial statements for most publicly traded
companies.
Suppose you are thinking of buying some Disney stock,
and you want to analyze its recent performance. Here’s a
partial (but by no means complete) list of sites you can
access to get started:
•
One source is Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com). Here
you will find updated market information along with
links to a variety of research sites. Enter a stock’s ticker
symbol, click “Get Quotes,” and you will see the stock’s
current price along with recent news about the com-
pany. Click “Key Statistics” to find a report on the
company’s key financial ratios. Links to the company’s
financials (income statement, balance sheet, and state-
ment of cash flows) can also be found. Yahoo! Finance
also has a list of insider transactions that tell you whe-
ther a company’s CEO and other key insiders are buying
or selling the company’s stock. In addition, the site has
a message board where investors share opinions about
the company and a link is provided to the company’s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Note also that, in most cases, a more complete
listing of SEC filings can be found at the SEC website
(sec.gov).
•
Two other websites with similar information are Google
Finance (google.com/finance) and MSN Money (money.
msn.com). After entering a stock’s ticker symbol, you will
see the current stock price and a list of recent news
stories. At either of these sites, you will find links to a
company’s financial statements and key ratios, as well as
other information including analyst ratings, historical
charts, earnings estimates, and a summary of insider
transactions. Google Finance, MSN Money, and Yahoo!
Finance allow you to export the financial statements and
historical prices to an Excel spreadsheet.
•
Other sources for up-to-date market information are
CNNMoney.com
(money.cnn.com),
Zacks
Investment
Research (zacks.com), and MarketWatch (marketwatch.
com), part of The Wall Street Journal Digital Network.
On these sites, you also can obtain stock quotes, finan-
cial statements, links to Wall Street research and SEC
filings, company profiles, and charts of a firm’s stock
price over time.
•
If you’re looking for data on bond yields, key money
rates, and currency rates, Bloomberg (bloomberg.com) is
an excellent source for this type of information.
•
Another good place to look is Reuters (reuters.com).
Here you can find links to analysts’ research reports
along with the key financial statements.
•
A valuable subscriber website from Value Line Investment
Survey (valueline.com) provides industry-specific and
detailed company income statement data, capital struc-
ture data, returns data, EPS, book value per share, cash
flow per share, and other investment data.
•
If you’re interested in obtaining baseline values on indi-
vidual stocks, you will find ValuePro (valuepro.net)
helpful. It identifies key financial numbers used to obtain
a stock’s value and allows the user to make changes and
see their impact on the stock’s value.
•
After accumulating all of this information, you may want
to look at a site that provides opinions regarding the
direction of the overall market and a particular stock.
Two popular sites are The Motley Fool (fool.com) and
The Street (thestreet.com).
•
A popular source is The Wall Street Journal website
(online.wsj.com). It is a great resource, but you have to
subscribe to access the full range of materials.
When analyzing ratios using different sources, it is impor-
tant that you understand how each source calculates a
particular ratio. Differences among sources could be attribu-
table to timing differences (using an average number versus
a trailing 12-month number) or to different definitions. It is
quite possible that, if you were to examine the same ratio for
a particular company, you might see different values for the
same ratio depending on the source chosen. For example,
Yahoo! Finance defines the inventory turnover ratio as the
ratio of annual sales to average inventory, while MSN Money
defines it as the cost of sales over the latest 12 months
divided by the average inventory from the same period.
You can often click on “Help” within the particular website
and search for the site’s specific finance glossary to deter-
mine how ratios are defined. Keep this in mind when
conducting ratio analysis.
This list is just a small subset of the information available
online. Sites come and go and change their content over
time. In addition, new and interesting sites are constantly
being added to the Internet.

4-2B QUICK, OR ACID TEST, RATIO
The second liquidity ratio is the quick, or acid test, ratio, which is calculated by
deducting inventories from current assets and then dividing the remainder by
current liabilities:
Quick, or acid test, ratio
Current assets
Inventories
Current liabilities
$385
$310
1 2
Industry average
2 2
Inventories are typically the least liquid of a firm’s current assets; and if sales slow
down, they might not be converted to cash as quickly as expected.3 Also, inven-
tories are the assets on which losses are most likely to occur in the event of
liquidation. Therefore, the quick ratio, which measures the firm’s ability to pay
off short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventories, is important.
The industry average quick ratio is 2 2, so Allied’s 1 2 ratio is relatively low.
Still, if the accounts receivable can be collected, the company can pay off its
current liabilities even if it has trouble disposing of its inventories.
4-3 ASSET MANAGEMENT RATIOS
The second group of ratios, the asset management ratios, measure how effectively
the firm is managing its assets. These ratios answer this question: Does the amount of
each type of asset seem reasonable, too high, or too low in view of current and
projected sales? These ratios are important because when Allied and other compa-
nies acquire assets, they must obtain capital from banks or other sources and capital
is expensive. Therefore, if Allied has too many assets, its cost of capital will be too
high, which will depress its profits. On the other hand, if its assets are too low,

What are the characteristics of a liquid asset? Give examples of some liquid
assets.
What question are the two liquidity ratios designed to answer?
Which is the least liquid of the firm’s current assets?
A company has current liabilities of $500 million, and its current ratio is 2 0. What
is the total of its current assets? ($1,000 million) If this firm’s quick ratio is 1 6,
how much inventory does it have? ($200 million) (Hint: To answer this problem
and some of the other problems in this chapter, write out the equation for the
ratio in the question, insert the given data, and solve for the missing value.)

Quick (Acid Test) Ratio
This ratio is calculated by
deducting inventories
from current assets and
then dividing the
remainder by current
liabilities.
3Some companies also report “Other current assets” on their balance sheet. Our definition of the quick
ratio would implicitly assume that these other current assets could be easily converted to cash. As an
alternative measure, some analysts define the quick ratio as:
Cash and equivalents
Accounts receivable
Current liabilities
This alternative measure assumes that the other current assets cannot be easily converted to cash. In
the case of Allied, since it has no other current assets, the two measures would yield the same number.

measure how effectively a

profitable sales will be lost. So Allied must strike a balance between too many and
too few assets, and the asset management ratios will help it strike this proper balance.
4-3A INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO
“Turnover ratios” divide sales by some asset: Sales/Various assets. As the name
implies, these ratios show how many times the particular asset is “turned over”
during the year. Here is the inventory turnover ratio:

As a rough approximation, each item of Allied’s inventory is sold and
restocked, or “turned over,” 4 9 times per year. Turnover is a term that originated
many years ago with the old Yankee peddler who would load up his wagon with
pots and pans, and then go off on his route to peddle his wares. The merchandise
was called working capital because it was what he actually sold, or “turned over,”
to produce his profits, whereas his “turnover” was the number of trips he took
each year. Annual sales divided by inventory equaled turnover, or trips per year.
If he made 10 trips per year, stocked 100 pots and pans, and made a gross profit of
$5 per item, his annual gross profit was 100 $5 10
$5,000. If he went faster
and made 20 trips per year, his gross profit doubled, other things held constant. So
his turnover directly affected his profits.
Allied’s inventory turnover of 4 9 is much lower than the industry average
of 10 9. This suggests that it is holding too much inventory. Excess inventory is, of
course, unproductive and represents an investment with a low or zero rate
of return. Allied’s low inventory turnover ratio also makes us question its current
ratio. With such a low turnover, the firm may be holding obsolete goods that are
not worth their stated value.4
Note that sales occur over the entire year, whereas the inventory figure is for
one point in time. For this reason, it might be better to use an average inventory
measure.5 If the business is highly seasonal or if there has been a strong upward or
downward sales trend during the year, it is especially useful to make an adjustment.
Allied’s sales are not growing especially fast though; and to maintain comparability
with industry averages, we used year-end rather than average inventories.
4-3B DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING
Accounts receivable are evaluated by the days sales outstanding (DSO) ratio,
also called the average collection period (ACP).6 It is calculated by dividing
accounts receivable by the average daily sales to find how many days’ sales are
tied up in receivables. Thus, the DSO represents the average length of time the
4Our measure of inventory turnover is frequently used by established compilers of financial ratio
statistics such as Value Line (valueline.com) and Dun & Bradstreet (dnb.com). However, you should
recognize that other sources calculate inventory using cost of goods sold in place of sales in the
formula’s numerator. The rationale for this alternative measure is that sales are stated at market
prices; so if inventories are carried at cost, as they generally are, the calculated turnover overstates
the true turnover ratio. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to use cost of goods sold in place of
sales in the formula’s numerator. When evaluating and comparing financial ratios from various
sources, it is important to understand how those sources are specifically calculating financial ratios.
5Preferably, the average inventory value should be calculated by summing the monthly figures during
the year and dividing by 12. If monthly data are not available, the beginning and ending figures can be
added and then divided by 2. Both methods adjust for growth but not for seasonal effects.
6We could use the receivables turnover to evaluate receivables. Allied’s receivables turnover is
$3,000 $375

firm must wait after making a sale before receiving cash. Allied has 46 days’ sales
outstanding, well above the 36-day industry average:

46 days
Industry average
36 days
The DSO can be compared with the industry average, but it is also evaluated
by comparing it with Allied’s credit terms. Allied’s credit policy calls for payment
within 30 days. So the fact that 46 days’ sales are outstanding, not 30 days’,
indicates that Allied’s customers, on average, are not paying their bills on time.
This deprives the company of funds that could be used to reduce bank loans or
some other type of costly capital. Moreover, the high average DSO indicates that if
some customers are paying on time, quite a few must be paying very late. Late-
paying customers often default, so their receivables may end up as bad debts that
can never be collected.7 Note too that the trend in the DSO over the past few years
has been rising, but the credit policy has not been changed. This reinforces our
belief that Allied’s credit manager should take steps to collect receivables faster.
4-3C FIXED ASSETS TURNOVER RATIO
The fixed assets turnover ratio, which is the ratio of sales to net fixed assets,
measures how effectively the firm uses its plant and equipment:
Fixed assets turnover ratio
Sales
Net fixed assets
$3,000
$1,000
3 0
Industry average
2 8
Allied’s ratio of 3 0 times is slightly above the 2 8 industry average, indicating that it
is using its fixed assets at least as intensively as other firms in the industry. There-
fore, Allied seems to have about the right amount of fixed assets relative to its sales.
Potential problems may arise when interpreting the fixed assets turnover
ratio. Recall that fixed assets are shown on the balance sheet at their historical
costs less depreciation. Inflation has caused the value of many assets that were
purchased in the past to be seriously understated. Therefore, if we compare an old
firm whose fixed assets have been depreciated with a new company with similar
operations that acquired its fixed assets only recently, the old firm will probably
have the higher fixed assets turnover ratio. However, this would be more reflec-
tive of the age of the assets than of inefficiency on the part of the new firm. The
accounting profession is trying to develop procedures for making financial state-
ments reflect current values rather than historical values, which would help us
make better comparisons. However, at the moment, the problem still exists; so
financial analysts must recognize this problem and deal with it judgmentally. In
Allied’s case, the issue is not serious because all firms in the industry have been
expanding at about the same rate; hence, the balance sheets of the comparison
firms are reasonably comparable.8
7For example, if further analysis along the lines suggested in Part 6 of this text (Working Capital
Management) indicates that 85% of the customers pay in 30 days, for the DSO to average 46 days, the
remaining 15% must be paying, on average, in 136 67 days. Paying that late suggests financial
difficulties. A DSO of 46 days would alert a good analyst of the need to dig deeper.

effects of inflation on financial statements. ASC 255 references FAS 89, Financial Reporting and

4-3D TOTAL ASSETS TURNOVER RATIO
The final asset management ratio, the total assets turnover ratio, measures the
turnover of all of the firm’s assets; and it is calculated by dividing sales by total
assets:
Total assets turnover ratio
Sales
Total assets
$3,000
$2,000
1 5
Industry average
1 8
Allied’s ratio is somewhat below the industry average, indicating that it is not
generating enough sales given its total assets. We just saw that Allied’s fixed
assets turnover is in line with the industry average; so the problem is with its
current assets, inventories and accounts receivable, whose ratios were below the
industry standards. Inventories should be reduced and receivables collected faster,
which would improve operations.
4-4 DEBT MANAGEMENT RATIOS
The use of debt will increase, or “leverage up,” a firm’s ROE if the firm earns more
on its assets than the interest rate it pays on debt. However, debt exposes the firm
to more risk than if it financed only with equity. In this section we discuss debt
management ratios.
Table 4.1 illustrates the potential benefits and risks associated with debt.9
Here we analyze two companies that are identical except for how they are
financed. Firm U (for Unleveraged) has no debt; thus, it uses 100% common equity.
Firm L (for Leveraged) obtained 50% of its capital as debt at an interest rate of 10%.
Both firms have $100 of assets, and their sales are expected to range from a high of
$150 down to $75 depending on business conditions. Some of their operating costs
(e.g., rent and the president’s salary) are fixed and will be the same regardless of
S E L F T E S T
Write the equations for four ratios that are used to measure how effectively a firm
manages its assets.
If one firm is growing rapidly and another is not, how might this distort a
comparison of their inventory turnover ratios?
If you wanted to evaluate a firm’s DSO, with what could you compare it?
How might different ages distort comparisons of different firms’ fixed assets
turnover ratios?

of accounts receivable. What is its inventory turnover ratio? (5×) What is its DSO?

Chapter 13. The relationship between various debt management ratios and bond ratings is discussed in
Chapter 7 and illustrated in Table 7.4.

10The financial statements do not show the breakdown between fixed and variable operating costs, but
companies can and do make this breakdown for internal purposes. Of course, the distinction is not
always clear because a fixed cost in the very short run can become a variable cost over a longer time
horizon. It’s interesting to note that companies are moving toward making more of their costs variable,
using such techniques as increasing bonuses rather than base salaries, switching to profit-sharing plans
rather than fixed pension plans, and outsourcing various operations.

each state of the economy. However, things differ below operating income. Firm U
has no debt, it pays no interest, its taxable income is the same as its operating
income, it pays a 40% state and federal tax rate, and its net income ranges from
$27 under good conditions down to $0 under bad conditions. When U’s net
income is divided by its common equity, its ROEs range from 27% to 0% depend-
ing on the state of the economy.
Firm L has the same EBIT as U under each state of the economy, but L uses
$50 of debt with a 10% interest rate; so it has $5 of interest charges regardless of
the economy. This $5 is deducted from EBIT to arrive at taxable income; taxes are
taken out; and the result is net income, which ranges from $24 to −$5 depending
on conditions.11 At first, it looks as though Firm U is better off under all condi-
tions, but this is not correct—we need to consider how much the two firms’
stockholders have invested. Firm L’s stockholders have put up only $50; so when
that investment is divided into net income, we see that their ROE under good
conditions is a whopping 48% (versus 27% for U) and is 12% (versus 9% for U)
under expected conditions. However, L’s ROE falls to −10% under bad conditions,
which means that Firm L would go bankrupt if those conditions persisted for
several years.
Thus, firms with relatively high debt ratios typically have higher expected
returns when the economy is normal but lower returns and possibly bankruptcy if
the economy goes into a recession. Therefore, decisions about the use of debt require
firms to balance higher expected returns against increased risk. Determining the
optimal amount of debt is a complicated process, and we defer a discussion of that
subject until Chapter 13. For now, we simply look at two procedures that analysts
use to examine the firm’s debt: (1) They check the balance sheet to determine the
proportion of total funds represented by debt; and (2) they review the income
statement to see the extent to which interest is covered by operating profits.
4-4A TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL
The ratio of total debt to total capital measures the percentage of the firm’s capital
provided by debtholders:
Total debt
Total capital
Total debt
Total debt
Equity
$110
$750
$1,800
$860
$1,800
47 8%
Industry average
36 4%
Recall from Chapter 3 that total debt includes all short-term and long-term interest-
bearing debt, but it does not include operating items such as accounts payable and
accruals. Allied has total debt of $860 million, which consists of $110 million in
short-term notes payable and $750 million in long-term bonds. Its total capital is
$1 80 billion: $860 million of debt plus $940 million in total equity. To keep things
simple, unless we say otherwise, we will generally refer to the total debt to total
capital ratio as the company’s debt ratio.12 Creditors prefer low debt ratios because
the lower the ratio, the greater the cushion against creditors’ losses in the event of
11As we discussed in the last chapter, firms can carry losses back or forward for several years.
Therefore, if firm L had profits and thus paid taxes in 2013, it could carry back the 2014 loss under
bad conditions and receive a credit (a check from the government). In Table 4.1, we disregard the carry-
back/carry-forward provision.
12Two other debt ratios are often used in financial analysis:
1.
Some analysts like to look at a broader debt ratio which includes all total liabilities (including
accounts payables and accruals) divided by total assets. For Allied, the total liabilities-to-assets
ratio is 53% ($1,060 million divided by $2,000 million), while the industry average is 40%.
2.
Another measure, the debt-to-equity ratio equals total debt divided by total equity. Allied’s debt-
to-equity ratio is 860 million 940 million
91 5%.
Total Debt to Total Capital
The ratio of total debt to
total capital.

liquidation. Stockholders, on the other hand, may want more leverage because it
can magnify expected earnings, as we saw in Table 4.1.
Allied’s debt ratio is 47 8%, which means that its creditors have supplied
roughly half of its total funds. As we will discuss in Chapter 13, a number of
factors affect a company’s optimal debt ratio. Nevertheless, the fact that Allied’s
debt ratio exceeds the industry average by a large amount raises a red flag, and
this will make it relatively costly for Allied to borrow additional funds without
first raising more equity. Creditors will be reluctant to lend the firm more money,
and management would probably be subjecting the firm to too high a risk of
bankruptcy if it sought to borrow a substantial amount of additional funds.
4-4B TIMES-INTEREST-EARNED RATIO
The times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio is determined by dividing earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT in Table 3.2) by the interest charges:
Times-interest-earned TIE ratio
EBIT
interest charges
$283 8
$88
3 2
Industry average
6 0
The TIE ratio measures the extent to which operating income can decline before
the firm is unable to meet its annual interest costs. Failure to pay interest will bring
legal action by the firm’s creditors and probably result in bankruptcy. Note that
earnings before interest and taxes, rather than net income, are used in the numera-
tor. Because interest is paid with pretax dollars, the firm’s ability to pay current
interest is not affected by taxes.
Allied’s interest is covered 3 2 times. The industry average is 6 times, so Allied
is covering its interest charges by a much lower margin of safety than the average
firm in the industry. Thus, the TIE ratio reinforces our conclusion from the debt
ratio, namely, that Allied would face difficulties if it attempted to borrow addi-
tional money.13

How does the use of financial leverage affect stockholders’ control position?
How does the U.S. tax structure influence a firm’s willingness to finance with
debt?

4-5 PROFITABILITY RATIOS
Accounting statements reflect events that happened in the past, but they also
provide clues about what’s really important—that is, what’s likely to happen in
the future. The liquidity, asset management, and debt ratios covered thus far tell
us something about the firm’s policies and operations. Now we turn to the prof-
itability ratios, which reflect the net result of all of the firm’s financing policies
and operating decisions.
4-5A OPERATING MARGIN
The operating margin, calculated by dividing operating income (EBIT) by sales,
gives the operating profit per dollar of sales:
Operating margin
EBIT
Sales
$283 8
$3,000
9 5%
Industry average
10 0%
Allied’s 9 5% operating margin is below the industry average of 10 0%. This
subpar result indicates that Allied’s operating costs are too high. This is consistent
with the low inventory turnover and high days’ sales outstanding ratios that we
calculated earlier.
4-5B PROFIT MARGIN
The profit margin, also sometimes called the net profit margin, is calculated by
dividing net income by sales:
Profit margin
Net income
Sales
$117 5
$3,000
3 9%
Industry average
5 0%
Allied’s 3 9% profit margin is below the industry average of 5 0%, and this
subpar result occurred for two reasons. First, Allied’s operating margin was
below the industry average because of the firm’s high operating costs. Second,
the profit margin is negatively impacted by Allied’s heavy use of debt. To see
this second point, recognize that net income is after interest. Suppose two firms
have identical operations in the sense that their sales, operating costs, and
operating income are identical. However, one firm uses more debt; hence, it
has higher interest charges. Those interest charges pull down its net income; and
because sales are identical, the result is a relatively low profit margin for the firm
with more debt. We see then that Allied’s operating inefficiency and its high debt
ratio combine to lower its profit margin below the food processing industry
average. It also follows that when two companies have the same operating
margin but different debt ratios, we can expect the company with a higher debt
ratio to have a lower profit margin.
Note too that while a high return on sales is good, we must also be
concerned with turnover. If a firm sets a very high price on its products, it
may earn a high return on each sale but fail to make many sales. It might
generate a high profit margin, but realize low sales, and hence experience a
low net income. We will see shortly how, through the use of the DuPont
equation, profit margins, the use of debt, and turnover ratios interact to affect
overall stockholder returns.

4-5C RETURN ON TOTAL ASSETS
Net income divided by total assets gives us the return on total assets (ROA):
Return on total assets ROA
Net income
Total assets
$117 5
$2,000
5 9%
Industry average
9 0%
Allied’s 5 9% return is well below the 9 0% industry average. This is not good—it
is obviously better to have a higher than a lower return on assets. Note, though,
that a low ROA can result from a conscious decision to use a great deal of debt, in
which case high interest expenses will cause net income to be relatively low. That
is part of the reason for Allied’s low ROA. Never forget—you must look at a
number of ratios, see what each suggests, and then look at the overall situation
before you judge the performance of a company and consider what actions it
should undertake to improve.
4-5D RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY
Another important accounting ratio is the return on common equity (ROE), which
is found as follows:
Return on common equity ROE
Net income
Common equity
$117 5
$940
12 5%
Industry average
15 0%
Stockholders expect to earn a return on their money, and this ratio tells how well
they are doing in an accounting sense. Allied’s 12 5% return is below the 15 0%
industry average, but not as far below as the return on total assets. This somewhat
better ROE results from the company’s greater use of debt, a point discussed
earlier in the chapter.
4-5E RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL
The return on invested capital (ROIC) measures the total return that the company
has provided for its investors.
Return on invested capital ROIC
EBIT 1
T
Total invested capital
EBIT 1
T
Debt
Equity
$170 3
$1,800
9 5%
Industry average
10 8%
ROIC differs from ROA in two ways. First its return is based on total invested
capital rather than total assets. Second, in the numerator it uses after-tax
operating income (NOPAT) rather than net income. The key difference is
that net income subtracts the company’s after-tax interest expense and there-
fore represents the total amount of income available to shareholders, while
NOPAT is the amount of funds available to pay both stockholders and debt-
holders.
Return on Total Assets
(ROA)
The ratio of net income to
total assets.
Return on Common Equity
(ROE)
The ratio of net income to
common equity; measures
the rate of return on
common stockholders’
investment.
Return on Invested Capital
(ROIC)
The ratio of after-tax
operating income to total
invested capital; it
measures the total return
that the company has
provided for its investors.

4-5F BASIC EARNING POWER (BEP) RATIO
The basic earning power (BEP) ratio is calculated by dividing operating income
(EBIT) by total assets:
Basic eaming power BEP
EBIT
Total assets
$283 8
$2,000
14 2%
Industry average
18 0%
This ratio shows the raw earning power of the firm’s assets before the
influence of taxes and debt, and it is useful when comparing firms with
different debt and tax situations. Because of its low turnover ratios and poor
profit margin on sales, Allied has a lower BEP ratio than the average food
processing company.

4-6 MARKET VALUE RATIOS
ROE reflects the effects of all of the other ratios, and it is the single best accounting
measure of performance. Investors like a high ROE, and high ROEs are correlated
with high stock prices. However, other things come into play. For example,
financial leverage generally increases the ROE but also increases the firm’s risk;
so if a high ROE is achieved by using a great deal of debt, the stock price might
end up lower than if the firm had been using less debt and had a lower ROE. We
use the final set of ratios—the market value ratios, which relate the stock price to
earnings and book value price—to help address this situation. If the liquidity,
asset management, debt management, and profitability ratios all look good and if
investors think these ratios will continue to look good in the future, the market
value ratios will be high, the stock price will be as high as can be expected, and
management will be judged as having done a good job.
The market value ratios are used in three primary ways: (1) by investors when
they are deciding to buy or sell a stock, (2) by investment bankers when they are
setting the share price for a new stock issue (an IPO), and (3) by firms when they
are deciding how much to offer for another firm in a potential merger.
4-6A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio shows how much investors are willing to pay per
dollar of reported profits. Allied’s stock sells for $23 06; so with an EPS of $2 35, its
P/E ratio is 9 8 :
Price Earnings P E ratio
Price per share
Earnings per share
$23 06

Industry average

As we will see in Chapter 9, P/E ratios are relatively high for firms with strong
growth prospects and little risk but low for slowly growing and risky firms.
Allied’s P/E ratio is below its industry average; so this suggests that the company
is regarded as being relatively risky, as having poor growth prospects, or both.14
P/E ratios vary considerably over time and across firms.15 In February 2013, the
S&P 500’s P/E ratio was 27 4 . At this same point in time, US Airways Group had a

Identify six profitability ratios and write their equations.
Why does the use of debt lower the profit margin and the ROA?
Using more debt lowers profits and thus the ROA. Why doesn’t debt have the
same negative effect on the ROE?
A company has a 10% ROA. Assume that a company’s total assets equals total
invested capital, and that the company has no debt, so its total invested capital
equals total equity. What is the company’s ROE and ROIC? (10%, 10%)
14Security analysts also look at the Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow ratio. In addition, analysts consider the PEG, or
P/E to growth, ratio where the P/E is divided by the firm’s forecasted growth rate. Allied’s growth rate as
forecasted by a number of security analysts for the next 5 years is 7 0%, so its PEG

1 4 . The
lower the ratio, the better; and most firms have ratios in the range of 1 0
to 2 0 . We note, though, that P/
E ratios jump around from year to year because earnings and forecasted growth rates fluctuate. Like other
ratios, PEG ratios are interesting, but must be interpreted with care and judgment.
15On his website (www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm), Professor Robert Shiller reports the annual
P/E ratio of the overall stock market dating back to 1871. His calculations show that the historical
average P/E ratio for the market has been 16 4 , and it has ranged from 4 8
to 44 2 .

4-6B MARKET/BOOK RATIO
The ratio of a stock’s market price to its book value gives another indication of how
investors regard the company. Companies that are well regarded by investors—
which means low risk and high growth—have high M/B ratios. For Allied, we first
find its book value per share:
Book value per share
Common equity
Shares outstanding
$940

$18 80
We then divide the market price per share by the book value per share to get
the market/book (M/B) ratio, which for Allied is 1 2 :

Investors are willing to pay less for a dollar of Allied’s book value than for one of an
average food processing company. This is consistent with our other findings. M/B
ratios typically exceed 1 0, which means that investors are willing to pay more for
stocks than the accounting book values of the stocks. This situation occurs primarily
because asset values, as reported by accountants on corporate balance sheets, do not
reflect either inflation or goodwill. Assets purchased years ago at pre-inflation prices
are carried at their original costs even though inflation might have caused their
actual values to rise substantially; and successful companies’ values rise above their
historical costs, whereas unsuccessful ones have low M/B ratios.16 This point is
demonstrated by Google and Bank of America: In February 2013, Google’s M/B
ratio was 3 68
while Bank of America’s was only 0 57 . Google’s stockholders
now have $3 68 in market value per $1 00 of equity, whereas Bank of America’s
stockholders have only $0 57 for each dollar they invested.

4-7 TYING THE RATIOS TOGETHER: THE DUPONT
EQUATION
We have discussed many ratios, so it would be useful to see how they work
together to determine the ROE. For this, we use the DuPont equation, a formula
developed by the chemical giant’s financial staff in the 1920s. It is shown here for
Allied and the food processing industry.

•
The first term, the profit margin, tells us how much the firm earns on its sales.
This ratio depends primarily on costs and sales prices—if a firm can command
a premium price and hold down its costs, its profit margin will be high, which
will help its ROE.
•
The second term is the total assets turnover. It is a “multiplier” that tells us
how many times the profit margin is earned each year—Allied earned 3 92%
on each dollar of sales, and its assets were turned over 1 5 times each year; so
its return on assets was 3 92
1 5
5 9
. Note, though, that this entire
5 9% belongs to the common stockholders—the bondholders earned a return
in the form of interest, and that interest was deducted before we calculated net
income to stockholders. So the whole 5 9% return on assets belongs to the
stockholders. Therefore, the return on assets must be adjusted upward to
obtain the return on equity.
•
That brings us to the third term, the equity multiplier, which is the adjustment
factor. Allied’s assets are 2 13 times its equity, so we must multiply the 5 9%
return on assets by the 2 13
equity multiplier to arrive at its ROE of 12 5%.17
Note that ROE as calculated using the DuPont equation is identical to Allied’s
ROE, 12 5%, which we calculated earlier. What’s the point of going through all of
the steps required to implement the DuPont equation to find ROE? The answer is
that the DuPont equation helps us see why Allied’s ROE is only 12 5% versus
15 0% for the industry. First, its profit margin is below average, which indicates
that its costs are not being controlled as well as they should be and that it cannot
charge premium prices. In addition, because it uses more debt than most compa-
nies, its high interest charges also reduce its profit margin. Second, its total assets
turnover is below the industry average, which indicates that it has more assets
than it needs. Finally, because its equity multiplier is relatively high, its heavy use
of debt offsets to some extent its low profit margin and turnover. However, the
high debt ratio exposes Allied to above-average bankruptcy risk; so it might want
17The equity multiplier relates to the firm’s use of debt. The industry equity multiplier can be obtained
by using the industry ROE and ROA. The equity multiplier = Total assets divided by common equity.
ROE = Net income/Common equity and ROA = Net income/Total assets. So, ROE ÷ ROA = Equity
multiplier as shown below:

MICROSOFT EXCEL: A TRULY ESSENTIAL TOOL
Microsoft Excel is an essential tool for anyone dealing with
business issues—not just finance and accounting profes-
sionals but also lawyers, marketers, auto sales managers,
government employees, and many others. Indeed, anyone
who works with numbers will be more efficient and produc-
tive if they know the basics of Excel, so it’s a necessity for
anyone who hopes to hold a managerial position.
As you go through this book, you will see that Excel is
used in four main ways:
1.
As a financial calculator. Excel can add, subtract, multi-
ply, and divide, and it can retain results from one opera-
tion for use in subsequent operations. For example, we
created the financial statements in Chapter 3 with Excel,
and we use it to analyze those statements in the current
chapter. We could have done this with a calculator or
pencil and paper, but it was a lot easier with Excel. As
we will see throughout the text, Excel also has a large
number of built-in financial functions that can be used
to simply calculate the answers to a wide range of
financial problems. For example, using Excel, it is
straightforward to calculate the return on an invest-
ment, the price of a bond, or the value of a project.
2.
To modify the work when things change. Suppose your
boss asked you to create the statements in Chapter 3,
but when you finished she said, “Thanks, but the
accounting department just informed us that inven-
tories in 2014 were overstated by $100 million, which
means that total assets were also overstated. To make
the balance sheet balance, we must reduce retained
earnings, common equity, and total claims against
assets. Please make those adjustments and give me a
revised set of statements before the board meeting
tomorrow morning.”
If you were working with a calculator, you’d be look-
ing at an all-nighter, but with Excel you could make just
one change—reduce 2014 inventories by $100 million—
and Excel would instantly revise the statements. If
your company had two people working on problems
like this, who would get promoted and who would get
a pink slip?
3.
Sensitivity analysis. We use ratios to analyze financial
statements and assess how well a company is managed,
and if weaknesses are detected management can make
changes to improve the situation. For example, Allied’s
return on equity (ROE), a key determinant of its stock
price, is below the industry average. ROE depends on a
number of factors, including the level of inventories,
and using Excel one can see how ROE would change if
inventories were increased or decreased. Then, manage-
ment can investigate alternative inventory policies to
see how they would impact profits and the ROE. In
theory, one could do this analysis with a calculator,
but this would be inefficient, and in a competitive world
efficiency is essential to survival.
4.
Risk assessments. Sensitivity analysis can be used to
assess the risk inherent in different policies. For exam-
ple, forecasted returns on equity are generally higher if a
firm increases its debt, but the more debt the firm
carries, the worse the effects of an economic downturn.
We can use Excel to quantify the effects of changing
economic conditions with different amounts of debt,
and thus the probability that the firm will go bankrupt
in a recession. Many firms learned about this during the
2008–2009 recession, so the survivors are now more
interested than ever in risk models.
This listing gives you an idea of what Excel can do and
why it is important in business today. We illustrate it
throughout the book, and you should make an effort to
understand how to use it. The Excel chapter models can
be found on the text’s website, www.cengagebrain.com.
You will find an understanding of Excel very helpful when
you begin interviewing for a job.18
© Cengage Learning 2015
18It is often impractical for professors to test students on their ability to integrate Excel into financial
management, so some students conclude that knowing more about Excel won’t help them on tests and
thus they ignore it. That’s unfortunate, and we can only say that there’s more to school than grades
alone, and in the long run knowing something about Excel is one of the most valuable tools you can
learn in school.
19The ROE reduction would actually be somewhat less because if debt were lowered, interest payments
would also decline, which would raise Allied’s profit margin. Allied’s analysts determined that the net
effect of a reduction in debt would still be a significant reduction in ROE.

study the effects of raising sales prices or of introducing new products with higher
margins. Its cost accountants can study various expense items and, working with
engineers, purchasing agents, and other operating personnel, seek ways to cut
costs. The credit manager can investigate ways to speed up collections, which
would reduce accounts receivable and therefore improve the quality of the total
assets turnover ratio. And the financial staff can analyze the effects of alternative
debt policies, showing how changes in leverage would affect both the expected
ROE and the risk of bankruptcy.
As a result of this analysis, Ellen Jackson, Allied’s chief executive officer
(CEO), undertook a series of moves that are expected to cut operating costs by
more than 20%. Jackson and Allied’s other executives have a strong incentive to
improve the firm’s financial performance—their compensation depends on how
well the company operates.
4-8 POTENTIAL MISUSES OF ROE
While ROE is an important measure of performance, we know that managers
should strive to maximize shareholder wealth. If a firm takes steps that improve
its ROE, does that mean that shareholder wealth will also be increased? The
answer is, “not necessarily.” Indeed, three problems are likely to arise if a firm
relies too heavily on ROE to measure performance.
First, ROE does not consider risk. Shareholders care about ROE, but they also
care about risk. To illustrate, consider two divisions within the same firm. Division
S has stable cash flows and a predictable 15% ROE. Division R has a 16% expected
ROE, but its cash flows are quite risky; so the expected ROE may not materialize.
If managers were compensated solely on the basis of ROE and if the expected
ROEs were actually achieved during the coming year, Division R’s manager
would receive a higher bonus than S’s even though S might actually be creating
more value for shareholders as a result of its lower risk. Similarly, financial
leverage can increase expected ROE, but more leverage means higher risk; so
raising ROE through the use of leverage may not be good.
Second, ROE does not consider the amount of invested capital. To illustrate,
consider a company that is choosing between two mutually exclusive projects.
Project A calls for investing $50,000 at an expected ROE of 50%, while Project B calls
for investing $1,000,000 at a 45% ROE. The projects are equally risky, and the
company’s cost of capital is 10%. Project A has the higher ROE, but it is much smaller.
Project B should be chosen because it would add more to shareholder wealth.
Third, a focus on ROE can cause managers to turn down profitable projects.
For example, suppose you manage a division of a large firm and the firm deter-
mines bonuses solely on the basis of ROE. You project that your division’s ROE for
the year will be an impressive 45%. Now you have an opportunity to invest in a
large, low-risk project with an estimated ROE of 35%, which is well above the
firm’s 10% cost of capital. Even though this project is extremely profitable, you
might still be reluctant to undertake it because it would reduce your division’s
average ROE and therefore your year-end bonus.

These three examples suggest that a project’s ROE must be combined with its
size and risk to determine its effect on shareholder value as we illustrate in the
diagram below:
ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED (EVA) VERSUS NET INCOME
As we mentioned in Chapter 3, Economic Value Added (EVA)
is a measure of how much management has added to
shareholders’ wealth during the year. To better understand
the idea behind EVA, let’s look at Allied’s 2014 numbers (in
millions). Allied’s total invested capital consists of $110 of
notes payable, $750 of long-term debt, and $940 of com-
mon equity, totaling $1,800. Debt represents 47 78% of this
total, and common equity is 52 22% of this total. Later in the
text we will discuss how to calculate the cost of Allied’s
capital; but for now, to simplify things, we estimate its
capital cost at 10%. Thus, the firm’s total dollar cost of capital
(which includes both debt and common equity) per year is
0.10($1,800)
$180.
Now let’s look at Allied’s income statement. Its operating
income, EBIT, is $283 8; and its interest expense is $88 0.
Therefore, its taxable income is $283 8
$88 0
$195 8.
Taxes equal 40% of taxable income, or 0 4 $195 8
$78 3;
so the firm’s net income is $117 5. Its return on equity, ROE, is
$117 5 $940
12 5%
Given this data, we can now calculate Allied’s EVA. The
basic formula for EVA (as discussed in Chapter 3) is as
follows:
EVA
EBIT 1
T
Total
invested capital
After-tax
cost of capital
$283 8 1 −0 40 −$1,800 0 10
$170 3 – $180
−$9 7
This negative EVA indicates that Allied’s shareholders
actually earned $9 7 million less than they could have
earned elsewhere by investing in other stocks with the same
risk as Allied. To see where this −$9 7 comes from, let’s trace
what happened to the money:
•
The firm generated $283 8 of operating income.
•
$78 3 went to the government to pay taxes, leaving
$205 5 available for investors—stockholders and bond-
holders.
•
$88 0 went to the bondholders in the form of interest
payments, thus leaving $117 5 for the stockholders.
•
However, Allied’s shareholders must also earn a return
on the equity capital they have invested in the firm
because they could have invested in other companies of
comparable risk. We call this the cost of Allied’s equity.
•
Once Allied’s shareholders are “paid” their return, the
firm comes up $9 7 million short—that’s the economic
value management added, and it is negative. In a sense,
Allied’s management created negative wealth because it
provided shareholders with a lower return than they
could have earned on alternative investments with the
same risk as Allied’s stock.
•
In practice, it is often necessary to make several adjust-
ments to arrive at a “better” measure of EVA. The
adjustments deal with nonoperating assets, leased
assets, depreciation, and other accounting details that
we leave for discussion in advanced finance courses.
The Connection between ROE and EVA
EVA is different from traditional accounting profit because
EVA reflects the cost of equity as well as the cost of debt.
Indeed, using the previous example, we could also express
EVA as net income minus the dollar cost of equity:
EVA
Net income
Equity
Cost of equity
This expression above could be rewritten as follows:
EVA
Equity Net income Equity
Cost of equity
which can be rewritten as:
EVA
Equity ROE
Cost of equity
This last expression implies that EVA depends on three
factors: rate of return, as reflected in ROE; risk, which affects
the cost of equity; and size, which is measured by the equity
employed. Recall that earlier in this chapter, we said that
shareholder value depends on risk, return, and capital
invested. This final equation illustrates that point.

4-9 USING FINANCIAL RATIOS TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE
While financial ratios help us evaluate financial statements, it is often hard to
evaluate a company by just looking at the ratios. For example, if you see that a
company has a current ratio of 1 2, it is hard to know if that is good or bad, unless you
put the ratio in its proper perspective. Allied’s management could look at industry
averages, it could compare itself to specific companies or “benchmarks,” and it can
analyze the trends in each ratio. We look at all three approaches in this section.
4-9A COMPARISON TO INDUSTRY AVERAGE
As we have done for Allied, one way to assess performance, is to compare the
company’s key ratios to the industry averages. Table 4.2 provides a summary of
the ratios we have discussed in this chapter. This table is useful as a quick
reference, and the calculated ratios and accompanying comments give a good
sense of Allied’s strengths and weaknesses relative to the average food processing
company. To give you a further sense of some “real-world” ratios, Table 4.3
provides a list of ratios for a number of different industries in February 2013.
4-9B BENCHMARKING
Ratio analysis involves comparisons with industry average figures, but Allied and
many other firms also compare themselves with a subset of top competitors in
their industry. This is called benchmarking, and the companies used for the
comparison are called benchmark companies. Allied’s management benchmarks
against Campbell Soup, a leading manufacturer of canned soups; Dean Foods, a
processor of canned and frozen vegetables; Fresh Del Monte Produce, a processor
of fruits and vegetables; Flowers Foods, a producer of bakery and snack-food
goods; Hershey Foods, a producer of chocolates and nonchocolate confectionary
products; and Kellogg Company, a manufacturer of ready-to-eat cereals and
convenience foods. Ratios are calculated for each company, then listed in descend-
ing order as shown below for the profit margin (the firms’ latest 12 months’ results
reported by MSN Money (money.msn.com) as of February 25, 2013):

The benchmarking setup makes it easy for Allied’s management to see exactly
where it stands relative to the competition. As the data show, Allied is near the
bottom of its benchmark group relative to its profit margin, so it has lots of room
for improvement. Other ratios are analyzed similarly.
Comparative ratios are available from a number of sources, including both
Yahoo! Finance and MSN Money. Useful ratios are also compiled by Value Line,
Dun and Bradstreet (D&B), and the Risk Management Association, which is the
national association of bank loan officers. Also, financial statement data for thou-
sands of publicly owned corporations are available on other Internet sites, and as
brokerage houses, banks, and other financial institutions have access to these data,

Each of the data-supplying organizations uses a somewhat different set of
ratios designed for its own purposes. For example, D&B deals mainly with small
firms, many of which are proprietorships, and it sells its services primarily to
banks and other lenders. Therefore, D&B is concerned largely with the creditor’s
viewpoint, and its ratios emphasize current assets and liabilities, not market value
ratios. So, when you select a comparative data source, you should be sure that
your emphasis is similar to that of the agency whose ratios you plan to use.
Additionally, there are often definitional differences in the ratios presented by
different sources, so before using a source, be sure to verify the exact definitions of
the ratios to ensure consistency with your own work.
4-9C TREND ANALYSIS
As a final comparison, Allied compares its ratios to its own past levels. It is
important to analyze trends in ratios as well as their absolute levels, for trends
give clues as to whether a firm’s financial condition is likely to improve or to
deteriorate. To do a trend analysis, simply plot a ratio over time, as shown in
Figure 4.1. This graph shows that Allied’s ROE has been declining since 2011 even

though the industry average has been relatively stable. All the other ratios could
be analyzed similarly, and such an analysis can be quite useful in gaining insights
as to why the ROE behaved as it did.
4-10 USES AND LIMITATIONS OF RATIOS
As noted earlier, ratio analysis is used by three main groups: (1) managers, who use
ratios to help analyze, control, and thus improve their firms’ operations; (2) credit
analysts, including bank loan officers and bond rating analysts, who analyze ratios
to help judge a company’s ability to repay its debts; and (3) stock analysts, who are
interested in a company’s efficiency, risk, and growth prospects. In later chapters,
we will look more closely at the basic factors that underlie each ratio. Note,
though, that while ratio analysis can provide useful information concerning a
company’s operations and financial condition, it does have limitations. Some
potential problems are listed here:
1.
Many firms have divisions that operate in different industries; and for such
companies, it is difficult to develop a meaningful set of industry averages.
Therefore, ratio analysis is more useful for narrowly focused firms than for
multidivisional ones.

2.
Most firms want to be better than average, so merely attaining average
performance is not necessarily good. As a target for high-level performance,
it is best to focus on the industry leaders’ ratios. Benchmarking helps in this
regard.
3.
Inflation has distorted many firms’ balance sheets—book values are often
different from market values. Market values would be more appropriate for
most purposes, but we cannot generally get market value figures because
assets such as used machinery are not traded in the marketplace. Further,
inflation affects asset values, depreciation charges, inventory costs, and thus
profits. Therefore, a ratio analysis for one firm over time or a comparative
analysis of firms of different ages must be interpreted with care and
judgment.
4.
Seasonal factors can also distort a ratio analysis. For example, the inventory
turnover ratio for a food processor will be radically different if the balance
sheet figure used for inventory is the one just before versus just after the
close of the canning season. This problem can be mitigated by using
monthly averages for inventory (and receivables) when calculating turnover
ratios.
5.
Firms can employ “window dressing” techniques to improve their financial
statements. To illustrate, people tend to think that larger hedge funds got large
because their high returns attracted many investors. However, we learned in
2007 that some funds simply borrowed and invested money to increase their
apparent size. One fund, Wharton Asset Management, reported $2 billion
“under management,” but it had actually attracted less than $100 million of
investors’ capital.
6.
Different accounting practices can distort comparisons. As noted earlier,
inventory valuation and depreciation methods can affect financial statements
and thus distort comparisons among firms. Also, if one firm leases much of its
productive equipment, its fixed assets turnover may be artificially high
because leased assets often do not appear on the balance sheet. At the same
time, the liability associated with the lease may not appear as debt, keeping
the debt ratio low even though failure to make lease payments can bankrupt
the firm. Therefore, leasing can artificially improve both turnover and the debt
ratios. The accounting profession has taken steps to reduce this problem, but it
still can cause distortions.
7.
It is difficult to generalize about whether a particular ratio is “good” or “bad.”
For example, a high current ratio may indicate a strong liquidity position,
which is good, but it can also indicate excessive cash, which is bad because
excess cash in the bank is a nonearning asset. Similarly, a high fixed assets
turnover ratio may indicate that the firm uses its assets efficiently, but it could
also indicate that the firm is short of cash and cannot afford to make needed
fixed asset investments.
8.
Firms often have some ratios that look “good” and others that look “bad,”
making it difficult to tell whether the company is, on balance, strong or weak.
To deal with this problem, banks and other lending organizations often use
statistical procedures to analyze the net effects of a set of ratios and to classify
firms according to their probability of getting into financial trouble.20
We see then that ratio analysis is useful, but analysts should be aware of the
problems just listed and make adjustments as necessary. Ratio analysis conducted

in a mechanical, unthinking manner is dangerous; but used intelligently and with
good judgment, it can provide useful insights into firms’ operations. Your judg-
ment in interpreting ratios is bound to be weak at this point, but it will improve as
you go through the remainder of the book.
4-11 LOOKING BEYOND THE NUMBERS
Working through this chapter should increase your ability to understand and
interpret financial statements. This is critically important for anyone making
business decisions or forecasting stock prices. However, sound financial analysis
involves more than just numbers—good analysis requires that certain qualitative
LOOKING FOR WARNING SIGNS WITHIN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial scandals have spurred a renewed interest in financial
accounting, and analysts now scour companies’ financial state-
ments to see if trouble is lurking. This renewed interest has led
to a list of red flags to consider when reviewing a company’s
financial statements. For example, after conferring with New
York University Accounting Professor Baruch Lev, Fortune
magazine’s Shawn Tully identified the following warning signs:
•
Year after year a company reports restructuring charges
and/or
write-downs.
This
practice
raises
concerns
because companies can use write-downs to mask oper-
ating expenses, which results in overstated earnings.
•
A company’s earnings have been propped up through a
series of acquisitions. Acquisitions can increase earnings
if the acquiring company has a higher P/E ratio than the
acquired firm, but such “growth” cannot be sustained
over the long run.
•
A company depreciates its assets more slowly than the
industry average. Lower depreciation boosts current
earnings, but again this cannot be sustained because
eventually depreciation must be recognized.
•
A company routinely has high earnings but low cash
flow. As Tully points out, this warning sign would have
exposed Enron’s problems. In the second quarter of 2001
(a few months before its problems began to unfold),
Enron reported earnings of $423 million versus a cash
flow of minus $527 million.
Along similar lines, after consulting with various profes-
sionals, Ellen Simon of the Newark Star Ledger came up with
her list of red flags:
•
You wouldn’t buy the stock at today’s price.
•
You don’t really understand the company’s financial
statements.
•
The company is in a business that lends itself to “creative
accounting.”
•
The company keeps taking nonrecurring charges.
•
Accounts receivable and inventory are increasing faster
than sales revenues.
•
The company’s insiders are selling their stock.
•
The company is making aggressive acquisitions, espe-
cially in unrelated fields.
There is some overlap between these two lists. Also, none of
these items automatically means there is something wrong
with the company—instead, the items should be viewed as
warning signs that cause you to take a closer look at the
company’s performance before making an investment.

factors also be considered. These factors, as summarized by the American Asso-
ciation of Individual Investors (AAII), include the following:
1.
Are the company’s revenues tied to one key customer? If so, the company’s
performance may decline dramatically if that customer goes elsewhere. On
the other hand, if the customer has no alternative to the company’s products,
this might actually stabilize sales.
2.
To what extent are the company’s revenues tied to one key product? Firms
that focus on a single product are often efficient, but a lack of diversification
also increases risk because having revenues from several products stabilizes
profits and cash flows in a volatile world.
3.
To what extent does the company rely on a single supplier? Depending on a
single supplier may lead to an unanticipated shortage and a hit to sales and
profits.
4.
What percentage of the company’s business is generated overseas? Companies
with a large percentage of overseas business are often able to realize higher
growth and larger profit margins. However, overseas operations may expose
the firm to political risks and exchange rate problems.
5.
How much competition does the firm face? Increases in competition tend to
lower prices and profit margins; so when forecasting future performance, it is
important to assess the likely actions of current competitors and the entry of
new ones.
6.
Is it necessary for the company to continually invest in research and
development? If so, its future prospects will depend critically on the success of
new products in the pipeline. For example, investors in a pharmaceutical
company want to know whether the company has a strong pipeline of
potential blockbuster drugs and whether those products are doing well in the
required tests.
7.
Are changes in laws and regulations likely to have important implications for
the firm? For example, when the future of electric utilities is forecasted, it is
crucial to factor in the effects of proposed regulations affecting the use of coal,
nuclear, and gas-fired plants.
As a good illustration of the need to look beyond the numbers, consider the
recent rise of Netflix. While Netflix’s financial statements have improved over
time, the rapid improvement in the company’s stock price is more due to the
market’s expectations regarding its future prospects. Many investors believe
that households will increasingly access movies directly through streaming
video, and that Netflix is well positioned to take advantage of this changing
technology. At the same time, the above factors suggest that Netflix’s success is
far from guaranteed. Indeed, many suggest that confronted with this technology
the company will face a new set of digital/on-demand competitors from cable
companies and from other sources, such as Apple’s iTunes. It will be interesting
for both consumers and Netflix’s shareholders to see how this plays out in the
years ahead.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

In the last chapter, we discussed the key financial statements; and in this one, we
described how ratios are used to analyze the statements to identify weaknesses
that need to be strengthened to maximize the stock price. Ratios are grouped into
five categories:
•
Liquidity
•
Asset management
•
Debt management
•
Profitability
•
Market value
The firm’s ratios are compared with averages for its industry and with the leading
firms in the industry (benchmarking), and these comparisons are used to help
formulate policies that will lead to improved future performance. Similarly, the
firm’s own ratios can be analyzed over time to see if its financial situation is getting
better or worse (trend analysis).
The single most important ratio over which management has control is the
ROE—the other ratios are also important, but mainly because they affect the ROE.
One tool used to show how ROE is determined is the DuPont equation: ROE = Profit
margin × Total assets turnover × Equity multiplier. If the firm’s ROE is below the
industry average and that of the benchmark companies, a DuPont analysis can help
identify problem areas that should be strengthened. In later chapters, we consider
specific actions that can be taken to improve ROE and thus a firm’s stock price. One
closing note: Although ratio analysis is useful, it must be applied with care and
good judgment. Actions taken to improve one ratio can have negative effects on
other ratios. For example, it might be possible to improve the ROE by using more
debt, but the risk of the additional debt may lead to a decrease in the P/E ratio and
thus in the firm’s stock price. Quantitative analysis such as ratio analysis can be
useful, but thinking through the results is even more important.

TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL
Last year K. Billingsworth & Co. had earnings
per share of $4 and dividends per share of $2. Total retained earnings increased by
$12 million during the year, while book value per share at year-end was $40. Billings-
worth has no preferred stock, and no new common stock was issued during the year.
If its year-end total debt was $120 million, what was the company’s year-end total debt
to total capital ratio?

aThis calculation is based on a 365-day year.
Kaiser has no preferred stock—only common equity, current liabilities, and long-term debt.
a.
Find Kaiser’s (1) accounts receivable, (2) current assets, (3) total assets, (4) ROA,
(5) common equity, (6) quick ratio, and (7) long-term debt.
b.
In Part a, you should have found that Kaiser’s accounts receivable (A/R) = $111.1
million. If Kaiser could reduce its DSO from 40.55 days to 30.4 days while holding
other things constant, how much cash would it generate? If this cash were used to buy
back common stock (at book value), thus reducing common equity, how would this
affect (1) the ROE, (2) the ROA, and (3) the total debt/total capital ratio?
QUESTIONS
4-1
Financial ratio analysis is conducted by three main groups of analysts: credit analysts, stock
analysts, and managers. What is the primary emphasis of each group, and how would that
emphasis affect the ratios on which they focus?
4-2
Why would the inventory turnover ratio be more important for someone analyzing a
grocery store chain than an insurance company?
4-3
Over the past year, M.D. Ryngaert & Co. had an increase in its current ratio and a decline in
its total assets turnover ratio. However, the company’s sales, cash and equivalents, DSO,
and fixed assets turnover ratio remained constant. What balance sheet accounts must have
changed to produce the indicated changes?
4-4
Profit margins and turnover ratios vary from one industry to another. What differences
would you expect to find between the turnover ratios, profit margins, and DuPont equa-
tions for a grocery chain and a steel company?
4-5
How does inflation distort ratio analysis comparisons for one company over time (trend
analysis) and for different companies that are being compared? Are only balance sheet
items or both balance sheet and income statement items affected?
4-6
If a firm’s ROE is low and management wants to improve it, explain how using more debt
might help.
4-7
Give some examples that illustrate how (a) seasonal factors and (b) different growth rates
might distort a comparative ratio analysis. How might these problems be alleviated?
4-8
Why is it sometimes misleading to compare a company’s financial ratios with those of other
firms that operate in the same industry?

The new owner thinks that inventories are excessive and can be lowered to the point where
the current ratio is equal to the industry average, 2.5×, without affecting sales or net
income. If inventories are sold and not replaced (thus reducing the current ratio to 2.5×),
if the funds generated are used to reduce common equity (stock can be repurchased at book
value), and if no other changes occur, by how much will the ROE change? What will be the
firm’s new quick ratio?
4-16
RETURN ON EQUITY
Central City Construction (CCC) needs $1 million of assets to get
started, and it expects to have a basic earning power ratio of 20%. CCC will own no
securities, so all of its income will be operating income. If it so chooses, CCC can finance
up to 50% of its assets with debt, which will have an 8% interest rate. If it chooses to use
debt, the firm will finance using only debt and common equity, so no preferred stock will
be used. Assuming a 40% tax rate on all taxable income, what is the difference between
CCC’s expected ROE if it finances these assets with 50% debt versus its expected ROE if it
finances these assets entirely with common stock?
4-17
CONCEPTUAL: RETURN ON EQUITY
Which of the following statements is most correct?
(Hint: Work Problem 4-16 before answering 4-17 and consider the solution setup for 4-16 as
you think about 4-17.)
a.
If a firm’s expected basic earning power (BEP) is constant for all of its assets and
exceeds the interest rate on its debt, adding assets and financing them with debt will
raise the firm’s expected return on common equity (ROE).
b.
The higher a firm’s tax rate, the lower its BEP ratio, other things held constant.
c.
The higher the interest rate on a firm’s debt, the lower its BEP ratio, other things held
constant.
d.
The higher a firm’s debt ratio, the lower its BEP ratio, other things held constant.
e.
Statement a is false; but statements b, c, and d are true.

TIE RATIO
AEI Incorporated has $5 billion in assets, and its tax rate is 40%. Its basic
earning power (BEP) ratio is 10%, and its return on assets (ROA) is 5%. What is AEI’s times-
interest-earned (TIE) ratio?
4-19
CURRENT RATIO
The Petry Company has $1,312,500 in current assets and $525,000 in
current liabilities. Its initial inventory level is $375,000, and it will raise funds as additional
notes payable and use them to increase inventory. How much can its short-term debt (notes
payable) increase without pushing its current ratio below 2.0?
4-20
DSO AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Harrelson Inc. currently has $750,000 in accounts
receivable, and its days sales outstanding (DSO) is 55 days. It wants to reduce its DSO to
35 days by pressuring more of its customers to pay their bills on time. If this policy is
adopted, the company’s average sales will fall by 15%. What will be the level of accounts
receivable following the change? Assume a 365-day year.
4-21
P/E AND STOCK PRICE
Fontaine Inc. recently reported net income of $2 million. It has
500,000 shares of common stock, which currently trades at $40 a share. Fontaine con-
tinues to expand and anticipates that 1 year from now, its net income will be $3.25
million. Over the next year, it also anticipates issuing an additional 150,000 shares of
stock so that 1 year from now it will have 650,000 shares of common stock. Assuming
Fontaine’s price/earnings ratio remains at its current level, what will be its stock price 1
year from now?

D’LEON INC., PART II
4-26
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TAXES
Part I of this case, presented in Chapter 3, discussed the situation of D’Leon
Inc., a regional snack foods producer, after an expansion program. D’Leon had increased plant capacity and
undertaken a major marketing campaign in an attempt to “go national.” Thus far, sales have not been up to the
forecasted level, costs have been higher than were projected, and a large loss occurred in 2014 rather than the
expected profit. As a result, its managers, directors, and investors are concerned about the firm’s survival.
Donna Jamison was brought in as assistant to Fred Campo, D’Leon’s chairman, who had the task of getting the
company back into a sound financial position. D’Leon’s 2013 and 2014 balance sheets and income statements,
together with projections for 2015, are given in Tables IC 4.1 and IC 4.2. In addition, Table IC 4.3 gives the company’s
2013 and 2014 financial ratios, together with industry average data. The 2015 projected financial statement data
represent Jamison’s and Campo’s best guess for 2015 results, assuming that some new financing is arranged to get
the company “over the hump.”

Jamison examined monthly data for 2014 (not given in the case), and she detected an improving pattern
during the year. Monthly sales were rising, costs were falling, and large losses in the early months had turned to
a small profit by December. Thus, the annual data look somewhat worse than final monthly data. Also, it
appears to be taking longer for the advertising program to get the message out, for the new sales offices to
generate sales, and for the new manufacturing facilities to operate efficiently. In other words, the lags between
spending money and deriving benefits were longer than D’Leon’s managers had anticipated. For these reasons,
Jamison and Campo see hope for the company—provided it can survive in the short run.
Jamison must prepare an analysis of where the company is now, what it must do to regain its financial
health, and what actions should be taken. Your assignment is to help her answer the following questions.
Provide clear explanations, not yes or no answers.
a. Why are ratios useful? What are the five major categories of ratios?
b. Calculate D’Leon’s 2015 current and quick ratios based on the projected balance sheet and income statement
data. What can you say about the company’s liquidity positions in 2013, in 2014, and as projected for 2015?
We often think of ratios as being useful (1) to managers to help run the business, (2) to bankers for credit
analysis, and (3) to stockholders for stock valuation. Would these different types of analysts have an equal
interest in the company’s liquidity ratios? Explain your answer.
c. Calculate the 2015 inventory turnover, days sales outstanding (DSO), fixed assets turnover, and total assets
turnover. How does D’Leon’s utilization of assets stack up against other firms in the industry?
d. Calculate the 2015 debt-to-capital and times-interest-earned ratios. How does D’Leon compare with the
industry with respect to financial leverage? What can you conclude from these ratios?
e. Calculate the 2015 operating margin, profit margin, basic earning power (BEP), return on assets (ROA),
return on equity (ROE), and return on invested capital (ROIC). What can you say about these ratios?
f. Calculate the 2015 price/earnings ratio and market/book ratio. Do these ratios indicate that investors are
expected to have a high or low opinion of the company?
g. Use the DuPont equation to provide a summary and overview of D’Leon’s financial condition as projected
for 2015. What are the firm’s major strengths and weaknesses?
h. Use the following simplified 2015 balance sheet to show, in general terms, how an improvement in the DSO
would tend to affect the stock price. For example, if the company could improve its collection procedures
and thereby lower its DSO from 45.6 days to the 32-day industry average without affecting sales, how
would that change “ripple through” the financial statements (shown in thousands below) and influence the
stock price?

i. Does it appear that inventories could be adjusted? If so, how should that adjustment affect D’Leon’s
profitability and stock price?
j. In 2014, the company paid its suppliers much later than the due dates; also, it was not maintaining financial
ratios at levels called for in its bank loan agreements. Therefore, suppliers could cut the company off, and its
bank could refuse to renew the loan when it comes due in 90 days. On the basis of data provided, would
you, as a credit manager, continue to sell to D’Leon on credit? (You could demand cash on delivery—that is,
sell on terms of COD—but that might cause D’Leon to stop buying from your company.) Similarly, if you
were the bank loan officer, would you recommend renewing the loan or demanding its repayment? Would
your actions be influenced if, in early 2015, D’Leon showed you its 2015 projections along with proof that it
was going to raise more than $1.2 million of new equity?
k. In hindsight, what should D’Leon have done in 2013?
l. What are some potential problems and limitations of financial ratio analysis?
m. What are some qualitative factors that analysts should consider when evaluating a company’s likely future
financial performance?

CONDUCTING A FINANCIAL RATIO ANALYSIS ON HEWLETT PACKARD CO.
In Chapter 3, we looked at Starbucks’ financial statements. Now we use Thomson ONE to analyze Hewlett
Packard Co. Enter Hewlett Packard’s ticker symbol (HPQ) and select “GO.” Select “Financials” and
“Thomson Financials” to find Hewlett Packard’s key financial statements for the past several years. Click
on “Worldscope” under “Financial Ratios.” From here you can select annual ratios, annual average ratios,
annual balance sheet ratios, annual income statement ratios, or annual cash flow ratios.
Under annual ratios, there is an in-depth summary of Hewlett Packard’s various ratios over the past 5
years. This information enables you to evaluate Hewlett Packard’s performance over time for each of the
ratio categories mentioned in the text (liquidity, asset management, debt management, profitability, and
market-based ratios).
The text mentions that financial statement analysis has two major components: a trend analysis, where
we evaluate changes in the key ratios over time, and a peer analysis, where we compare financial ratios
with firms that are in the same industry and/or line of business. We have already used Thomson ONE to
conduct a trend analysis—next, we use this tool to conduct a peer analysis. Click on “Comparables” to find
some summary financial information for Hewlett Packard and a few of its peers. By clicking on the Peer

Will You Be Able to Retire?
Your reaction to that question is probably, “First
things first! I’m worried about getting a job, not
about retiring!” However, understanding the retire-
ment situation can help you land a job because
(1) this is an important issue today, (2) employers
like to hire people who know what’s happening in
the real world, and (3) professors often test on the
time value of money with problems related to
saving for future purposes (including retirement).
A recent study by the Employee Benefit
Research Institute suggests that many U.S. work-
ers are not doing enough to prepare for retire-
ment. The survey found that 57% of workers had
less than $25,000 in savings and investments (not
including the value of their homes). Equally con-
cerning, 28% of those surveyed said they had “no
confidence” that they would be able to retire
comfortably. This is the highest percentage
recorded
since the
survey
was
established
23 years ago.1 Unfortunately, there is no easy
solution. In order to reach their retirement goals,
many current workers will need to work longer,
spend less and save more, and hopefully earn
higher returns on their current savings.
Historically, many Americans have relied on
Social Security as an important source of their
retirement
income.
However,
given
current
demographics, it is likely that this important pro-
gram will need to be restructured down the road
in order to maintain its viability. While the aver-
age personal savings rate in the United States
had edged up in recent years, it still stands at a
fairly low level of 4%.2 In addition, the ratio of U.S.
workers to retirees has steadily declined over the

past half century. In 1955, there were 8.6 workers supporting
each retiree, but by 1975, that number had declined to
3.2 workers for every one retiree. From 1975 through 2009,
the ratio remained between 3.0 and 3.4 workers for every
retiree. Current projections show this ratio significantly declining
in the years ahead—the forecast is for 2.0 workers per retiree in
2035 and 1.9 workers per retiree in 2085.3 With so few people
paying into the Social Security system and so many drawing
funds out, Social Security is going to be in serious trouble. In
fact, for the first time since its inception, in 2010 (and 7 years
ahead of schedule), Social Security was in the red—paying out
more in benefits than it received in tax revenues. Considering
these facts, many people may have trouble maintaining a
reasonable standard of living after they retire, and many of
today’s college students will have to support their parents.
This is an important issue for millions of Americans, but
many don’t know how to deal with it. Most Americans have
been ignoring what is most certainly going to be a huge
personal and social problem. However, if you study this chap-
ter carefully, you can use the tools and techniques presented
here to avoid the trap that has caught, and is likely to catch,
so many people.
Time value analysis has many applications, including planning for retirement, valuing
stocks and bonds, setting up loan payment schedules, and making corporate decisions
regarding investing in new plants and equipment. In fact, of all financial concepts, time
value of money is the single most important concept. Indeed, time value analysis is used
throughout the book; so it is vital that you understand this chapter before continuing.
You need to understand basic time value concepts, but conceptual knowledge will
do you little good if you can’t do the required calculations. Therefore, this chapter is
heavy on calculations. Most students studying finance have a financial or scientific
calculator; some also own or have access to a computer. One of these tools is necessary
to work many finance problems in a reasonable length of time. However, when
students begin reading this chapter, many of them don’t know how to use the time
value functions on their calculator or computer. If you are in that situation, you will find
yourself simultaneously studying concepts and trying to learn to use your calculator,
and you will need more time to cover this chapter than you might expect.4
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
• Explain how the time value of money works and discuss why it is such an
important concept in finance.
• Calculate the present value and future value of lump sums.
• Identify the different types of annuities, calculate the present value and future
value of both an ordinary annuity and an annuity due, and calculate the relevant
annuity payments.
Excellent retirement
calculators are available
at money.msn.com/
retirement, ssa.gov, and
choosetosave.org/
calculators. These calculators
allow you to input
hypothetical retirement
savings information; the
program then shows if current
retirement savings will be
sufficient to meet retirement
needs.

Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, Table IV.B2.
4Calculator manuals tend to be long and complicated, partly because they cover a number of topics that
aren’t required in the basic finance course. We provide tutorials for the most commonly used
calculators on the textbook website and you can access these by going to www.cengagebrain.com
and searching ISBN 9781285065137. The tutorials are keyed to this chapter, and they show exactly how
to do the required calculations. If you don’t know how to use your calculator, go to the textbook’s
website, find the relevant tutorial, and work through it as you study the chapter.

• Calculate the present value and future value of an uneven cash flow stream.
You will use this knowledge in later chapters that show how to value common
stocks and corporate projects.
• Explain the difference between nominal, periodic, and effective interest rates.
An understanding of these concepts is necessary when comparing rates of
returns on alternative investments.
• Discuss the basics of loan amortization and develop a loan amortization
schedule that you might use when considering an auto loan or home mortgage
loan.
5-1 TIME LINES
The first step in time value analysis is to set up a time line, which will help you
visualize what’s happening in a particular problem. As an illustration, consider
the following diagram, where PV represents $100 that is on hand today and FV is
the value that will be in the account on a future date:
0
2
1
3
5%
Periods
Cash
PV = $100
FV = ?
The intervals from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 are time periods such as years or
months. Time 0 is today, and it is the beginning of Period 1; Time 1 is one period
from today, and it is both the end of Period 1 and the beginning of Period 2; and
so forth. Although the periods are often years, periods can also be quarters or
months or even days. Note that each tick mark corresponds to both the end of one
period and the beginning of the next one. Thus, if the periods are years, the tick
mark at Time 2 represents the end of Year 2 and the beginning of Year 3.
Cash flows are shown directly below the tick marks, and the relevant interest
rate is shown just above the time line. Unknown cash flows, which you are trying
to find, are indicated by question marks. Here the interest rate is 5%; a single cash
outflow, $100, is invested at Time 0; and the Time 3 value is an unknown inflow.
In this example, cash flows occur only at Times 0 and 3, with no flows at Times 1
or 2. Note that in our example, the interest rate is constant for all 3 years. That
condition is generally true; but if it were not, we would show different interest
rates for the different periods.
Time lines are essential when you are first learning time value concepts, but
even experts use them to analyze complex finance problems; and we use them
throughout the book. We begin each problem by setting up a time line to illustrate
the situation, after which we provide an equation that must be solved to find the
answer. Then we explain how to use a regular calculator, a financial calculator,
and a spreadsheet to find the answer.
S E L F T E S T
Do time lines deal only with years, or can other time periods be used?

5-2 FUTURE VALUES
A dollar in hand today is worth more than a dollar to be received in the future
because if you had it now, you could invest it, earn interest, and own more than a
dollar in the future. The process of going to future value (FV) from present value
(PV) is called compounding. For an illustration, refer back to our 3-year time line
and assume that you plan to deposit $100 in a bank that pays a guaranteed
5% interest each year. How much would you have at the end of Year 3? We first
define some terms, and then we set up a time line to show how the future value is
calculated.
PV = Present value, or beginning amount. In our example, PV = $100.
FVN = Future value, or ending amount, of your account after N periods.
Whereas PV is the value now, or the present value, FVN is the value
N periods into the future, after the interest earned has been added to
the account.
CFt = Cash flow. Cash flows can be positive or negative. The cash flow for
a particular period is often given as a subscript, CFt, where t is the
period. Thus, CF0 = PV = the cash flow at Time 0, whereas CF3 is the
cash flow at the end of Period 3.
I = Interest rate earned per year. Sometimes a lowercase i is used. Interest
earned is based on the balance at the beginning of each year, and
we assume that it is paid at the end of the year. Here I = 5% or,
expressed as a decimal, 0.05. Throughout this chapter, we designate
the interest rate as I because that symbol (or I/YR, for interest rate
per year) is used on most financial calculators. Note, though, that in
later chapters, we use the symbol r to denote rates because r (for
rate of return) is used more often in the finance literature. Note, too,
that in this chapter we generally assume that interest payments are
guaranteed by the U.S. government; hence, they are certain. In later
chapters, we will consider risky investments, where the interest rate
earned might differ from its expected level.
INT = Dollars of interest earned during the year = Beginning amount × I.
In our example, INT = $100(0.05) = $5.
N = Number of periods involved in the analysis. In our example, N = 3.
Sometimes the number of periods is designated with a lowercase n,
so both N and n indicate the number of periods involved.
We can use four different procedures to solve time value problems.5 These
methods are described in the following sections.
5-2A STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH
The time line used to find the FV of $100 compounded for 3 years at 5%, along
with some calculations, is shown. Multiply the initial amount and each succeeding
amount by 1
I
1 05 :
5A fifth procedure, using tables that show “interest factors,” was used before financial calculators and
computers became available. Now, though, calculators and spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft
Excel are programmed to calculate the specific factor needed for a given problem and then to use it to
find the FV. This is more efficient than using the tables. Moreover, calculators and spreadsheets can
handle fractional periods and fractional interest rates, such as the FV of $100 after 3.75 years when the
interest rate is 5.375%, whereas tables provide numbers only for whole periods and rates. For these
reasons, tables are not used in business today; hence, we do not discuss them in the text.
Future Value (FV)
The amount to which a
cash flow or series of cash
flows will grow over a
given period of time when
compounded at a given
interest rate.
Present Value (PV)
The value today of a
future cash flow or series
of cash flows.
Compounding
The arithmetic process of
determining the final
value of a cash flow or
series of cash flows when
compound interest is
applied.

You start with $100 in the account—this is shown at t

•
You earn $100 0 05
$5 of interest during the first year, so the amount at the
end of Year 1 or t
1 is $100
$5
$105.
•
You begin the second year with $105, earn 0 05 $105
$5 25 on the now
larger beginning-of-period amount, and end the year with $110 25. Interest
during Year 2 is $5 25; and it is higher than the first year’s interest, $5 00,
because you earned $5 0 05
$0 25 interest on the first year’s interest. This is
called compounding, and interest earned on interest is called compound
interest.
•
This process continues; and because the beginning balance is higher each
successive year, the interest earned each year increases.
•
The total interest earned, $15 76, is reflected in the final balance, $115 76.
The step-by-step approach is useful because it shows exactly what is happening.
However, this approach is time-consuming, especially when a number of years are
involved; so streamlined procedures have been developed.
5-2B FORMULA APPROACH
In the step-by-step approach, we multiply the amount at the beginning of each
period by 1
I
1 05 . If N
3, we multiply by 1
I three different times,
which is the same as multiplying the beginning amount by 1
I
3. This concept
can be extended, and the result is this key equation:
FVN
PV 1
I
N
5.1
We can apply Equation 5.1 to find the FV in our example:
FV3
$100 1 05 3
$115 76
Equation 5.1 can be used with any calculator that has an exponential function,
making it easy to find FVs no matter how many years are involved.
SIMPLE VERSUS COMPOUND INTEREST
Interest earned on the interest earned in prior periods, as
was true in our example and is always true when we apply
Equation 5.1, is called compound interest. If interest is not
earned on interest, we have simple interest. The formula
for FV with simple interest is FV = PV + PV(I)(N); so in our
example, FV would have been $100 + $100(0.05)(3) =
$100 + $15 = $115 based on simple interest. Most financial
contracts are based on compound interest; but in legal
proceedings, the law often specifies that simple interest
must be used. For example, Maris Distributing, a company
founded by home-run king Roger Maris, won a lawsuit
against Anheuser-Busch (A-B) because A-B had breached a
contract and taken away Maris’s franchise to sell Budweiser
beer. The judge awarded Maris $50 million plus interest at
10% from 1997 (when A-B breached the contract) until the
payment was actually made. The interest award was based
on simple interest, which as of 2005 (when a settlement was
reached between A-B and the Maris family) had raised the
total from $50 million to $50 million + 0.10($50 million)
(8 years) = $90 million. (No doubt the sheer size of this
award and the impact of the interest, even simple interest,
influenced A-B to settle.) If the law had allowed compound
interest, the award would have totaled ($50 million)(1.10)8 =
$107.18 million, or $17.18 million more. This legal procedure
dates back to the days before calculators and computers.
The law moves slowly!
Simple Interest
Occurs when interest is
not earned on interest.
Compound Interest
Occurs when interest is
earned on prior periods’
interest.

5-2C FINANCIAL CALCULATORS
Financial calculators are extremely helpful in working time value problems. Their
manuals explain calculators in detail; and on the textbook’s website, we provide
summaries of the features needed to work the problems in this book for several
popular calculators. Also see the box entitled “Hints on Using Financial Calcula-
tors,” on page 145, for suggestions that will help you avoid common mistakes. If
you are not yet familiar with your calculator, we recommend that you work
through the tutorial as you study this chapter.
First, note that financial calculators have five keys that correspond to the five
variables in the basic time value equations. We show the inputs for our text
example above the respective keys and the output, the FV, below its key. Because
there are no periodic payments, we enter 0 for PMT. We describe the keys in more
detail after this calculation.

 115.76
Where:
N = Number of periods. Some calculators use n rather than N.
I/YR = Interest rate per period. Some calculators use i or I rather than I YR.
PV = Present value. In our example, we begin by making a deposit, which is
an outflow (the cash leaves our wallet and is deposited at one of many
financial institutions); so the PV should be entered with a negative sign.
On most calculators, you must enter the 100, then press the
−key to
switch from
100 to
100. If you enter −100 directly, 100 will be
subtracted from the last number in the calculator, giving you an incor-
rect answer.
PMT = Payment. This key is used when we have a series of equal, or constant,
payments. Because there are no such payments in our illustrative
problem, we enter PMT
0. We will use the PMT key when we
discuss annuities later in this chapter.
FV = Future value. In this example, the FV is positive because we entered
the PV as a negative number. If we had entered the 100 as a positive
number, the FV would have been negative.
As noted in our example, you enter the known values N, I YR, PV, and PMT
and then press the FV key to get the answer, 115 76. Again, note that if you enter the
PV as 100 without a minus sign, the FV will be shown on the calculator display as a
negative number. The calculator assumes that either the PV or the FV is negative.
This should not be confusing if you think about what you are doing. When PMT is
zero, it doesn’t matter what sign you enter for PV as your calculator will auto-
matically assign the opposite sign to FV. We will discuss this point in greater detail
later in the chapter when we cover annuities.
5-2D SPREADSHEETS6
Students generally use calculators for homework and exam problems; but in
business, people generally use spreadsheets for problems that involve the time
value of money TVM . Spreadsheets show in detail what is happening, and they

help reduce both conceptual and data-entry errors. The spreadsheet discussion
can be skipped without loss of continuity; but if you understand the basics of
Excel and have access to a computer, we recommend that you read through this
section. Even if you aren’t familiar with spreadsheets, the discussion will still give
you an idea of how they operate.
We used Excel to create Table 5.1, which is part of the spreadsheet model that
corresponds to this chapter. Table 5.1 summarizes the four methods of finding the
FV and shows the spreadsheet formulas toward the bottom. Note that spread-
sheets can be used to do calculations; but they can also be used like a word
processor to create exhibits like Table 5.1, which includes text, drawings, and
calculations. The letters across the top designate columns, the numbers to the left
designate rows, and the rows and columns jointly designate cells. Thus, C14 is the
cell in which we specify the
$100 investment, C15 shows the interest rate, and
C16 shows the number of periods. We then created a time line on Rows 17 to 19;
and on Row 21, we have Excel go through the step-by-step calculations, multi-
plying the beginning-of-year values by 1
I to find the compounded value at
the end of each period. Cell G21 shows the final result. Then on Row 23, we
illustrate the formula approach, using Excel to solve Equation 5.1, and find the FV,
$115 76. Next, on Rows 25 to 27, we show a picture of the calculator solution.
Finally, on Rows 30 and 31, we use Excel’s built-in FV function to find the answers
given in Cells G30 and G31. The G30 answer is based on fixed inputs, while the
G31 answer is based on cell references, which makes it easy to change inputs and
see the effects on the output.
For example, if you wanted to quickly see how the future value changes if
the interest rate was 7% instead of 5%, all you need to do is change Cell C15 to
7%. Looking at Cell G30, you will immediately see that the future value is now
$122 50.
Students can download the Excel
chapter models from the student
companion site on the text’s website.
Once downloaded onto your
computer, retrieve the Excel chapter
model and follow along as you read

If you are using Excel, there are a few things to keep in mind:
•
When calculating time value of money problems in Excel, interest rates are
entered as percentages or decimals (e.g., 05 or 5%). However, when using the
time value of money function on most financial calculators you generally
enter the interest rate as a whole number (e.g., 5).
•
When calculating time value of money problems in Excel, the abbreviation for
the number of periods is nper, whereas for most financial calculators the
abbreviation is simply N. Throughout the text, we will use these terms
interchangeably.
•
When calculating time value of money problems in Excel, you will often
be prompted to enter Type. Type refers to whether the payments come at
the end of the year (in which case Type
0, or you can just omit it), or at
the beginning of the year (in which case Type
1). Most financial
calculators have a BEGIN/END mode function that you toggle on or off to
indicate whether the payments come at the beginning or at the end of the
period.
Table 5.1 demonstrates that all four methods get the same result, but they use
different calculating procedures. It also shows that with Excel, all inputs are
shown in one place, which makes checking data entries relatively easy. Finally,
it shows that Excel can be used to create exhibits, which are quite important in the
real world. In business, it’s often as important to explain what you are doing as it
is to “get the right answer” because if decision makers don’t understand your
analysis, they may reject your recommendations.
HINTS ON USING FINANCIAL CALCULATORS
When using a financial calculator, make sure it is set up as indicated here. Refer to your
calculator manual or to our calculator tutorial on the text’s website for information on setting
up your calculator.
•
One payment per period. Many calculators “come out of the box” assuming that 12
payments are made per year; that is, monthly payments. However, in this book, we
generally deal with problems in which only one payment is made each year. Therefore,
you should set your calculator at one payment per year and leave it there. See our tutorial or
your calculator manual if you need assistance.
•
End mode. With most contracts, payments are made at the end of each period. However,
some contracts call for payments at the beginning of each period. You can switch
between “End Mode” and “Begin Mode” depending on the problem you are solving.
Because most of the problems in this book call for end-of-period payments, you should
return your calculator to End Mode after you work a problem where payments are made at
the beginning of periods.
•
Negative sign for outflows. Outflows must be entered as negative numbers. This generally
means typing the outflow as a positive number and then pressing the +/−key to convert
from + to −before hitting the enter key.
•
Decimal places. With most calculators, you can specify from 0 to 11 decimal places. When
working with dollars, we generally specify two decimal places. When dealing with
interest rates, we generally specify two places after the decimal when the rate is
expressed as a percentage (e.g., 5.25%), but we specify four decimal places when the
rate is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.0525).
•
Interest rates. For arithmetic operations with a nonfinancial calculator, 0.0525 must be
used; but with a financial calculator and its TVM keys, you must enter 5.25, not 0.0525,
because financial calculators assume that rates are stated as percentages.

5-2E GRAPHIC VIEW OF THE COMPOUNDING PROCESS
Figure 5.1 shows how a $1 investment grows over time at different interest rates.
We made the curves by solving Equation 5.1 with different values for N and I. The
interest rate is a growth rate: If a sum is deposited and earns 5% interest per year,
Q U E S T I O N :
At the beginning of your freshman year, your favorite aunt and uncle deposit $10,000 into a
four-year bank certificate of deposit (CD) that pays 5% annual interest. You will receive the
money in the account (including the accumulated interest) if you graduate with honors in
four years. How much will there be in the account after four years?

Here we find that the future value equals $12,155.06.

the funds on deposit will grow by 5% per year. Note also that time value concepts
can be applied to anything that grows—sales, population, earnings per share, or
future salary.
5-3 PRESENT VALUES
Finding a present value is the reverse of finding a future value. Indeed, we simply
solve Equation 5.1, the formula for the future value, for the PV to produce the
basic present value Equation, 5.2:
Future value
FVN
PV 1
I N
5.1
Present value

5.2
We illustrate PVs with the following example. A broker offers to sell you a
Treasury bond that will pay $115 76 three years from now. Banks are currently
offering a guaranteed 5% interest on 3-year certificates of deposit (CDs); and if you
don’t buy the bond, you will buy a CD. The 5% rate paid on the CDs is defined as
your opportunity cost, or the rate of return you could earn on an alternative
investment of similar risk. Given these conditions, what’s the most you should
pay for the bond? We answer this question using the four methods discussed in
the last section—step-by-step, formula, calculator, and spreadsheet. Table 5.2
summarizes the results.
First, recall from the future value example in the last section that if you
invested $100 at 5%, it would grow to $115 76 in 3 years. You would also have
$115 76 after 3 years if you bought the T-bond. Therefore, the most you should
pay for the bond is $100—this is its “fair price.” If you could buy the bond for less
than $100, you should buy it rather than invest in the CD. Conversely, if its price
was more than $100, you should buy the CD. If the bond’s price was exactly $100,
you should be indifferent between the T-bond and the CD.
S E L F T E S T
Explain why this statement is true: A dollar in hand today is worth more than a
dollar to be received next year.
What is compounding? What’s the difference between simple interest and
compound interest? What would the future value of $100 be after 5 years at
10% compound interest? At 10% simple interest? ($161.05; $150.00)
Suppose you currently have $2,000 and plan to purchase a 3-year certificate of
deposit (CD) that pays 4% interest compounded annually. How much will you
have when the CD matures? How would your answer change if the interest rate
were 5% or 6% or 20%? ($2,249.73; $2,315.25; $2,382.03; $3,456.00. Hint:
With a calculator, enter N = 3, I/YR = 4, PV = −2000, and PMT = 0; then press
FV to get 2,249.73. Enter I/YR = 5 to override the 4% and press FV again to
get the second answer. In general, you can change one input at a time to
see how the output changes.)
A company’s sales in 2014 were $100 million. If sales grow at 8%, what will they
be 10 years later, in 2024? ($215.89 million)
How much would $1, growing at 5% per year, be worth after 100 years? What
would the FV be if the growth rate was 10%? ($131.50; $13,780.61)

The $100 is defined as the present value, or PV, of $115 76 due in 3 years when
the appropriate interest rate is 5%. In general, the present value of a cash flow due N
years in the future is the amount which, if it were on hand today, would grow to equal the
given future amount. Because $100 would grow to $115 76 in 3 years at a 5% interest
rate, $100 is the present value of $115 76 due in 3 years at a 5% rate. Finding
present values is called discounting; and as noted above, it is the reverse of
compounding—if you know the PV, you can compound to find the FV, while if
you know the FV, you can discount to find the PV.
The top section of Table 5.2 calculates the PV using the step-by-step approach.
When we found the future value in the previous section, we worked from left to
right, multiplying the initial amount and each subsequent amount by 1
I . To
find present values, we work backward, or from right to left, dividing the future
value and each subsequent amount by
1
I . This procedure shows exactly
what’s happening, which can be quite useful when you are working complex
problems. However, it’s inefficient, especially when you are dealing with a large
number of years.
With the formula approach, we use Equation 5.2, simply dividing the future
value by 1
I
N. This is more efficient than the step-by-step approach, and it
gives the same result. Equation 5.2 is built into financial calculators; and as shown
in Table 5.2, we can find the PV by entering values for N I YR PMT, and FV and
then pressing the PV key. Finally, Excel’s PV function,
=PV(0.05,3,0,–115.76)
PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
can be used. It is essentially the same as the calculator and solves Equation 5.2.
The fundamental goal of financial management is to maximize the firm’s
value, and the value of a business (or any asset, including stocks and bonds) is
the present value of its expected future cash flows. Because present value lies at the
heart of the valuation process, we will have much more to say about it in the
remainder of this chapter and throughout the book.

5-3A GRAPHIC VIEW OF THE DISCOUNTING PROCESS
Figure 5.2 shows that the present value of a sum to be received in the future
decreases and approaches zero as the payment date is extended further into the
future and that the present value falls faster at higher interest rates. At relatively
high rates, funds due in the future are worth very little today; and even at
relatively low rates, present values of sums due in the very distant future are
quite small. For example, at a 20% discount rate, $1 million due in 100 years
would be worth only $0 0121 today. This is because $0 0121 would grow to
$1 million in 100 years when compounded at 20%.

What is discounting, and how is it related to compounding? How is the future
value equation (5.1) related to the present value equation (5.2)?
How does the present value of a future payment change as the time to receipt is
lengthened? As the interest rate increases?
Suppose a U.S. government bond promises to pay $2,249.73 three years from
now. If the going interest rate on three-year government bonds is 4%, how
much is the bond worth today? How would your answer change if the bond
matured in 5 years rather than 3? What if the interest rate on the 5-year bond
was 6% rather than 4%? ($2,000; $1,849.11; $1,681.13)
How much would $1,000,000 due in 100 years be worth today if the discount
rate was 5%? If the discount rate was 20%? ($7,604.49; $0.0121)

5-4 FINDING THE INTEREST RATE, I
Thus far we have used Equations 5.1 and 5.2 to find future and present values.
Those equations have four variables; and if we know three of the variables, we can
solve for the fourth. Thus, if we know PV, I, and N, we can solve Equation 5.1 for
FV, while if we know FV I, and N, we can solve Equation 5.2 to find PV. That’s
what we did in the preceding two sections.
Now suppose we know PV FV, and N and want to find I. For example,
suppose we know that a given bond has a cost of $100 and that it will return
$150 after 10 years. Thus, we know PV FV, and N and we want to find the rate of
return we will earn if we buy the bond. Here’s the situation:
FV
PV 1
I
N
$150
$100 1
I
10
$150 $100
1
I
10
1 5
1
I
10
Unfortunately, we can’t factor I out to produce as simple a formula as we
could for FV and PV. We can solve for I, but it requires a bit more algebra.7
However, financial calculators and spreadsheets can find interest rates almost
instantly. Here’s the calculator setup:
FV
PV
I/YR
N
PMT

–100
10
 4.14
Enter N
10, PV
–100, PMT
0 because there are no payments until the
security matures, and FV
150. Then when you press the I YR key, the calculator
gives the answer, 4 14%. You would get this same answer using the RATE
function in Excel:
=RATE(10,0,–100,150)
RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
Here we find that the interest rate is equal to 4 14%.8
S E L F T E S T
The U.S. Treasury offers to sell you a bond for $585.43. No payments will be
made until the bond matures 10 years from now, at which time it will be
redeemed for $1,000. What interest rate would you earn if you bought this
bond for $585.43? What rate would you earn if you could buy the bond for
$550? For $600? (5.5%; 6.16%; 5.24%)
Microsoft earned $0.94 per share in 2002. Ten years later in 2012 it earned $2.72.
What was the growth rate in Microsoft’s earnings per share (EPS) over the
10-year period? If EPS in 2012 had been $2.25 rather than $2.72, what would
the growth rate have been? (11.21%; 9.12%)
7Raise the left side of the equation, the 1.5, to the power 1/N = 1/10 = 0.1, getting 1.0414. That number
is 1 plus the interest rate, so the interest rate is 0.0414 = 4.14%.
8The RATE function prompts you to make a “guess.” In many cases, you can leave this blank, but if
Excel is unable to find a solution to the problem, you should enter a reasonable “guess,” which will
help the program converge to the correct solution.

5-5 FINDING THE NUMBER OF YEARS, N
We sometimes need to know how long it will take to accumulate a certain sum of
money, given our beginning funds and the rate we will earn on those funds. For
example, suppose we believe that we could retire comfortably if we had $1
million. We want to find how long it will take us to acquire $1 million, assuming
we now have $500,000 invested at 4 5%. We cannot use a simple formula—the
situation is like that with interest rates. We can set up a formula that uses
logarithms, but calculators and spreadsheets find N very quickly. Here’s the
calculator setup:
FV
PV
I/YR
N
PMT
0
1000000
–500000
4.5
15.7473
Enter I YR
4 5, PV
–500000, PMT
0, and FV
1000000. Then when you
press the N key, you get the answer, 15 7473 years. If you plug N
15 7473 into
the FV formula, you can prove that this is indeed the correct number of years:
FV
PV 1
I
N
$500,000 1 045
15 7473
$1,000,000
You can also use Excel’s NPER function:
=NPER(0.045,0,–500000,1000000)
NPER(rate, pmt, pv, [fv], [type])
Here we find that it will take 15 7473 years for $500,000 to double at a 4 5%
interest rate.
5-6 ANNUITIES
Thus far we have dealt with single payments, or “lump sums.” However, many
assets provide a series of cash inflows over time; and many obligations, such as
auto, student, and mortgage loans, require a series of payments. When the pay-
ments are equal and are made at fixed intervals, the series is an annuity. For
example, $100 paid at the end of each of the next 3 years is a 3-year annuity. If the
payments occur at the end of each year, the annuity is an ordinary (or deferred)
annuity. If the payments are made at the beginning of each year, the annuity is an
annuity due. Ordinary annuities are more common in finance; so when we use the
term annuity in this book, assume that the payments occur at the ends of the
periods unless otherwise noted.
S E L F T E S T
How long would it take $1,000 to double if it was invested in a bank that paid
6% per year? How long would it take if the rate was 10%? (11.9 years;
7.27 years)
Microsoft’s 2012 earnings per share were $2.72, and its growth rate during the
prior 10 years was 11.21% per year. If that growth rate was maintained, how long
would it take for Microsoft’s EPS to double? (6.52 years)
Annuity
A series of equal payments
at fixed intervals for a
specified number of
periods.
Ordinary (Deferred) Annuity
An annuity whose
payments occur at the
end of each period.
Annuity Due
An annuity whose
payments occur at the
beginning of each period.

As we demonstrate in the following sections, we can find an annuity’s future
and present values, the interest rate built into annuity contracts, and the length of
time it takes to reach a financial goal using an annuity. Keep in mind that
annuities must have constant payments and a fixed number of periods. If these
conditions don’t hold, then the payments do not constitute an annuity.
5-7 FUTURE VALUE OF AN ORDINARY ANNUITY
The future value of an annuity can be found using the step-by-step approach or
using a formula, a financial calculator, or a spreadsheet. As an illustration, con-
sider the ordinary annuity diagrammed earlier, where you deposit $100 at the end
of each year for 3 years and earn 5% per year. How much will you have at the end
of the third year? The answer, $315 25, is defined as the future value of the
annuity, FVAN; it is shown in Table 5.3.
As shown in the step-by-step section of the table, we compound each payment
out to Time 3, then sum those compounded values to find the annuity’s
FV FVA3
$315 25. The first payment earns interest for two periods, the second
payment earns interest for one period, and the third payment earns no interest at
all because it is made at the end of the annuity’s life. This approach is straightfor-
ward; but if the annuity extends out for many years, the approach is cumbersome
and time-consuming.
As you can see from the time line diagram, with the step-by-step approach,
we apply the following equation, with N

Because this is an ordinary annuity, with payments coming at the end of each
year, we must set the calculator appropriately. As noted earlier, calculators
“come out of the box” set to assume that payments occur at the end of each
period, that is, to deal with ordinary annuities. However, there is a key that
enables us to switch between ordinary annuities and annuities due. For ordinary
annuities the designation is “End Mode” or something similar, while for annu-
ities due the designation is “Begin” or “Begin Mode” or “Due” or something
similar. If you make a mistake and set your calculator on Begin Mode when
working with an ordinary annuity, each payment will earn interest for one
extra year. That will cause the compounded amounts, and thus the FVA, to be
too large.
The last approach in Table 5.3 shows the spreadsheet solution using Excel’s
built-in function. We can put in fixed values for N, I, PV, and PMT or set up an
Input Section, where we assign values to those variables, and then input values
into the function as cell references. Using cell references makes it easy to change
the inputs to see the effects of changes on the output.
Q U E S T I O N :
Your grandfather urged you to begin a habit of saving money early in your life. He
suggested that you put $5 a day into an envelope. If you follow his advice, at the end of
the year you will have $1,825 365
$5 . Your grandfather further suggested that you take
that money at the end of the year and invest it in an online brokerage mutual fund account
that has an annual expected return of 8%.
You are 18 years old. If you start following your grandfather’s advice today, and continue
saving in this way the rest of your life, how much do you expect to have in the brokerage
account when you are 65 years old?
A N S W E R :
This problem is asking you to calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity. More
specifically, you are making 47 payments of $1,825, where the annual interest rate is 8%.
To quickly find the answer, enter the following inputs into a financial calculator: N
47;
I YR
8; PV
0; and PMT
–1825. Then solve for the FV of the ordinary annuity by
pressing the FV key, FV
$826,542.78.
In addition, we can use Excel’s FV function:
=FV(0.08,47,–1825,0)
FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])
Here we find that the future value is $826,542.78.
You can see your grandfather is right—it definitely pays to start saving early!

5-8 FUTURE VALUE OF AN ANNUITY DUE
Because each payment occurs one period earlier with an annuity due, all of the
payments earn interest for one additional period. Therefore, the FV of an annuity
due will be greater than that of a similar ordinary annuity. If you went through
the step-by-step procedure, you would see that our illustrative annuity due has an
FV of $331 01 versus $315 25 for the ordinary annuity.
With the formula approach, we first use Equation 5.3; but because each
payment occurs one period earlier, we multiply the Equation 5.3 result by 1
1 :
FVAdue
FVAordinary 1
I
5.4
Thus, for the annuity due, FVAdue
$315 25 1 05
$331 01, which is the same
result when the period-by-period approach is used. With a calculator, we input
the variables just as we did with the ordinary annuity; but now we set the
calculator to Begin Mode to get the answer, $331 01.
S E L F T E S T
Why does an annuity due always have a higher future value than an ordinary
annuity?
If you calculated the value of an ordinary annuity, how could you find the value
of the corresponding annuity due?
Assume that you plan to buy a condo 5 years from now and you need to save for
a down payment. You plan to save $2,500 per year (with the first deposit made
immediately), and you will deposit the funds in a bank account that pays 4%
interest. How much will you have after 5 years? How much will you have if you
make the deposits at the end of each year? ($14,082.44; $13,540.81)
S E L F T E S T
For an ordinary annuity with five annual payments of $100 and a 10% interest
rate, how many years will the first payment earn interest? What will this pay-
ment’s value be at the end? Answer this same question for the fifth payment.
(4 years, $146.41; 0 years, $100)
Assume that you plan to buy a condo 5 years from now, and you estimate
that you can save $2,500 per year. You plan to deposit the money in a bank that
pays 4% interest, and you will make the first deposit at the end of the year.
How much will you have after 5 years? How will your answer change if the
interest rate is increased to 6% or lowered to 3%? ($13,540.81; $14,092.73;
$13,272.84)

5-9 PRESENT VALUE OF AN ORDINARY ANNUITY
The present value of an annuity, PVAN, can be found using the step-by-step,
formula, calculator, or spreadsheet method. Look back at Table 5.3. To find the FV
of the annuity, we compounded the deposits. To find the PV, we discount them,
dividing each payment by 1
I
t. The step-by-step procedure is diagrammed as
follows:

$272.32 = Present value of the annuity (PVAN)
Equation 5.5 expresses the step-by-step procedure in a formula. The bracketed
form of the equation can be used with a scientific calculator, and it is helpful if the
annuity extends out for a number of years:

Calculators are programmed to solve Equation 5.5; so we merely input the
variables and press the PV key, making sure the calculator is set to End Mode. The
calculator setup follows for both an ordinary annuity and an annuity due. Note
that the PV of the annuity due is larger because each payment is discounted back
one less year. Note too that you can find the PV of the ordinary annuity and then
multiply by

Q U E S T I O N :
You just won the Florida lottery. To receive your winnings, you must select one of the two
following choices:
1. You can receive $1,000,000 a year at the end of each of the next 30 years; OR
2. You can receive a one-time payment of $15,000,000 today.
Assume that the current interest rate is 6%. Which option is most valuable?
A N S W E R :
The most valuable option is the one with the largest present value. You know that the
second option has a present value of $15,000,000, so we need to determine whether the
present value of the $1,000,000 30-year ordinary annuity exceeds $15,000,000.
Using the formula approach, we see that the present value of the annuity is:
PVAN

FV

–1000000

13,764,831.15
Finally, we can use Excel’s PV function:
=PV(0.06,30,–1000000,0)
PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
Here we find that the present value is $13,764,831.15.
Because the present value of the 30-year annuity is less than $15,000,000, you should
choose to receive your winnings as a one-time upfront payment.

5-10 FINDING ANNUITY PAYMENTS, PERIODS,
AND INTEREST RATES
We can find payments, periods, and interest rates for annuities. Here five vari-
ables come into play: N, I, PMT, FV, and PV. If we know any four, we can find
the fifth.
5-10A FINDING ANNUITY PAYMENTS, PMT
Suppose we need to accumulate $10,000 and have it available 5 years from now.
Suppose further that we can earn a return of 6% on our savings, which are
currently zero. Thus, we know that FV
10,000, PV
0, N
5, and I YR
6.
We can enter these values in a financial calculator and press the PMT key to find
how large our deposits must be. The answer will, of course, depend on whether
we make deposits at the end of each year (ordinary annuity) or at the beginning
(annuity due). Here are the results for each type of annuity:
Ordinary Annuity:
FV
PV
I/YR

–1,773.96
We can also use Excel’s PMT function:
=PMT(0.06,5,0,10000
PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])
Because the deposits are made at the end of the year, we can leave “type” blank.
Here we find that an annual deposit of $1 773 96 is needed to reach your goal.
S E L F T E S T
Why does an annuity due have a higher present value than a similar ordinary
annuity?
If you know the present value of an ordinary annuity, how can you find the PV of
the corresponding annuity due?
What is the PVA of an ordinary annuity with 10 payments of $100 if the
appropriate interest rate is 10%? What would the PVA be if the interest rate
was 4%? What if the interest rate was 0%? How would the PVA values differ if we
were dealing with annuities due? ($614.46; $811.09; $1,000.00; $675.90;
$843.53; $1,000.00)
Assume that you are offered an annuity that pays $100 at the end of each year
for 10 years. You could earn 8% on your money in other investments with
equal risk. What is the most you should pay for the annuity? If the payments
began immediately, how much would the annuity be worth? ($671.01;
$724.69)

Because the deposits are now made at the beginning of the year, enter 1 for type.
Here we find that an annual deposit of $1,673 55 is needed to reach your goal.
Thus, you must save $1,773 96 per year if you make deposits at the end of each
year, but only $1,673 55 if the deposits begin immediately. Note that the required
annual deposit for the annuity due is calculated as the ordinary annuity payment
divided by 1

5-10B FINDING THE NUMBER OF PERIODS, N
Suppose you decide to make end-of-year deposits, but you can save only $1,200
per year. Again assuming that you would earn 6%, how long would it take to
reach your $10,000 goal? Here is the calculator setup:

With these smaller deposits, it would take 6 96 years to reach your $10,000 goal. If
you began the deposits immediately, you would have an annuity due and N
would be a bit smaller, 6 63 years.
You can also use Excel’s NPER function to arrive at both of these answers. If
we assume end-of-year payments Excel’s NPER function looks like this:
=NPER(0.06,–1200,0,10000)
NPER(rate, pmt, pv, [fv], [type])
Here we find that it will take 6 96 years to reach your goal.
If we assume beginning-of-year payments Excel’s NPER function looks like this:
=NPER(0.06,–1200,0,10000,1)
NPER(rate, pmt, pv, [fv], [type])
Here we find that it will take only 6 63 years to reach your goal.
5-10C FINDING THE INTEREST RATE, I
Now suppose you can save only $1,200 annually, but you still need the $10,000 in
5 years. What rate of return would enable you to achieve your goal? Here is the

Excel’s RATE function will arrive at the same answer:
=RATE(5,–1200,0,10000)
RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
Here we find that the interest rate is 25 78%.
You must earn a whopping 25 78% to reach your goal. About the only way
to earn such a high return would be to invest in speculative stocks or head to the
casinos in Las Vegas. Of course, investing in speculative stocks and gambling
aren’t like making deposits in a bank with a guaranteed rate of return, so there’s
a good chance you’d end up with nothing. You might consider changing your
plans—save more, lower your $10,000 target, or extend your time horizon. It
might be appropriate to seek a somewhat higher return, but trying to earn
25 78% in a 6% market would require taking on more risk than would be
prudent.
It’s easy to find rates of return using a financial calculator or a spreadsheet.
However, to find rates of return without one of these tools, you would have to go
through a trial-and-error process, which would be very time-consuming if many
years were involved.
5-11 PERPETUITIES
A perpetuity is simply an annuity with an extended life. Because the payments go
on forever, you can’t apply the step-by-step approach. However, it’s easy to find
the PV of a perpetuity with a formula found by solving Equation 5.5 with N set at
infinity:10
S E L F T E S T
Suppose you inherited $100,000 and invested it at 7% per year. What is the most
you could withdraw at the end of each of the next 10 years and have a zero
balance at Year 10? How would your answer change if you made withdrawals at
the beginning of each year? ($14,237.75; $13,306.31)
If you had $100,000 that was invested at 7% and you wanted to withdraw
$10,000 at the end of each year, how long would your funds last? How long
would they last if you earned 0%? How long would they last if you earned the
7% but limited your withdrawals to $7,000 per year? (17.8 years; 10 years;
forever)
Your uncle named you beneficiary of his life insurance policy. The insurance

your mother’s friend earn on his investment? If you think a “fair” return would be
6%, how much should you ask for the annuity? (13.70%; $78,016.92)

5-12 UNEVEN CASH FLOWS
The definition of an annuity includes the words constant payment—in other words,
annuities involve payments that are equal in every period. Although many finan-
cial decisions involve constant payments, many others involve uneven, or non-
constant, cash flows. For example, the dividends on common stocks typically
increase over time, and investments in capital equipment almost always generate
uneven cash flows. Throughout the book, we reserve the term payment (PMT) for
annuities with their equal payments in each period and use the term cash flow
(CFt) to denote uneven cash flows, where t designates the period in which the cash
flow occurs.
There are two important classes of uneven cash flows: (1) a stream that
consists of a series of annuity payments plus an additional final lump sum and
(2) all other uneven streams. Bonds represent the best example of the first type,
while stocks and capital investments illustrate the second type. Here are numerical
examples of the two types of flows:

payments on the annuity began immediately? ($20,000, $21,000. Hint: Just add
the $1,000 to be received immediately to the value of the annuity.)

cash flow that’s not part
of an annuity.

A series of cash flows
where the amount varies
from one period to the

We can find the PV of either stream by using Equation 5.7 and following the step-
by-step procedure, where we discount each cash flow and then sum them to find
the PV of the stream:

If we did this, we would find the PV of Stream 1 to be $927 90 and the PV of
Stream 2 to be $1 016 35.
The step-by-step procedure is straightforward; but if we have a large number
of cash flows, it is time-consuming. However, financial calculators speed up the
process considerably. First, consider Stream 1; notice that we have a 5-year, 12%
ordinary annuity plus a final payment of $1 000. We could find the PV of the
annuity, and then find the PV of the final payment and sum them to obtain the PV
of the stream. Financial calculators do this in one simple step—use the five TVM
keys, enter the data as shown below, and press the PV key to obtain the answer,
$927 90.

The solution procedure is different for the second uneven stream. Here we
must use the step-by-step approach as shown in Figure 5.3. Even calculators and
spreadsheets solve the problem using the step-by-step procedure, but they do it
quickly and efficiently. First, you enter all of the cash flows and the interest rate;
then the calculator or computer discounts each cash flow to find its present value
and sums these PVs to produce the PV of the stream. You must enter the cash
flows in the calculator’s “cash flow register,” enter the interest rate, and then press
the NPV key to find the PV of the stream. NPV stands for “net present value.” We
cover the calculator mechanics in the calculator tutorial, and we discuss the
process in more detail in Chapters 9 and 11, where we use the NPV calculation
to analyze stocks and proposed capital budgeting projects. If you don’t know how
to do the calculation with your calculator, it would be worthwhile to review the
tutorial or your calculator manual, learn the steps, and make sure you can do this
calculation. Because you will have to learn to do it eventually, now is a good time
to begin.

5-13 FUTURE VALUE OF AN UNEVEN CASH FLOW STREAM
We find the future value of uneven cash flow streams by compounding rather
than discounting. Consider Cash Flow Stream 2 in the preceding section. We
discounted those cash flows to find the PV, but we would compound them to
find the FV. Figure 5.4 illustrates the procedure for finding the FV of the stream
using the step-by-step approach.
The values of all financial assets—stocks, bonds, and business capital invest-
ments—are found as the present values of their expected future cash flows. There-
fore, we need to calculate present values very often, far more often than future
values. As a result, all financial calculators provide automated functions for
finding PVs, but they generally do not provide automated FV functions. On the
relatively few occasions when we need to find the FV of an uneven cash flow
stream, we generally use the step-by-step procedure shown in Figure 5.4. That
approach works for all cash flow streams, even those for which some cash flows
are zero or negative.
S E L F T E S T
How could you use Equation 5.2 to find the PV of an uneven stream of cash
flows?
What’s the present value of a 5-year ordinary annuity of $100 plus an additional
$500 at the end of Year 5 if the interest rate is 6%? What is the PV if the $100
payments occur in Years 1 through 10 and the $500 comes at the end of Year
10? ($794.87; $1,015.21)
What’s the present value of the following uneven cash flow stream: $0 at Time 0,
$100 in Year 1 (or at Time 1), $200 in Year 2, $0 in Year 3, and $400 in Year 4 if
the interest rate is 8%? ($558.07)
Would a typical common stock provide cash flows more like an annuity or more
like an uneven cash flow stream? Explain.

5-14 SOLVING FOR I WITH UNEVEN CASH FLOWS11
Before financial calculators and spreadsheets existed, it was extremely difficult to
find I when the cash flows were uneven. With spreadsheets and financial calcu-
lators, however, it’s relatively easy to find I. If you have an annuity plus a final
lump sum, you can input values for N, PV, PMT, and FV into the calculator’s TVM
registers and then press the I YR key. Here is the setup for Stream 1 from Section
5-12, assuming we must pay $927 90 to buy the asset. The rate of return on the
$927 90 investment is 12%.

Finding the interest rate for an uneven cash flow stream such as Stream 2 is a
bit more complicated. First, note that there is no simple procedure—finding the
rate requires a trial-and-error process, which means that a financial calculator or a
spreadsheet is needed. With a calculator, we enter the CFs into the cash flow
register and then press the IRR key to get the answer. IRR stands for “internal rate
of return,” and it is the rate of return the investment provides. The investment is
the cash flow at Time 0, and it must be entered as a negative value. As an
illustration, consider the cash flows given here, where CF0
−$1,000 is the cost
of the asset.

When we enter those cash flows into the calculator’s cash flow register and

get the same answer using Excel’s IRR function. This process is covered in the
calculator tutorial; it is also discussed in Chapter 11, where we study capital
budgeting.
S E L F T E S T
Why are we more likely to need to calculate the PV of cash flow streams than the
FV of streams?
What is the future value of this cash flow stream: $100 at the end of 1 year, $150
due after 2 years, and $300 due after 3 years if the appropriate interest rate is
15%? ($604.75)
11This section is relatively technical. It can be deferred at this point, but the calculations will be required
in Chapter 11.

5-15 SEMIANNUAL AND OTHER COMPOUNDING PERIODS
In all of our examples thus far, we assumed that interest was compounded once a
year, or annually. This is called annual compounding. Suppose, however, that
you deposit $100 in a bank that pays a 5% annual interest rate but credits interest
each 6 months. So in the second 6-month period, you earn interest on your original
$100 plus interest on the interest earned during the first 6 months. This is called
semiannual compounding. Note that banks generally pay interest more than once
a year; virtually all bonds pay interest semiannually; and most mortgages, student
loans, and auto loans require monthly payments. Therefore, it is important to
understand how to deal with nonannual compounding.
For an illustration of semiannual compounding, assume that we deposit $100
in an account that pays 5% and leave it there for 10 years. First, consider again
what the future value would be under annual compounding:
FVN
PV 1
I N
$100 1 05 10
$162 89
We would, of course, get the same answer using a financial calculator or a
spreadsheet.
How would things change in this example if interest was paid semiannually
rather than annually? First, whenever payments occur more than once a year, you
must make two conversions: (1) Convert the stated interest rate into a “periodic
rate” and (2) convert the number of years into “number of periods.” The conver-
sions are done as follows, where I is the stated annual rate, M is the number of
compounding periods per year, and N is the number of years:
Periodic rate IPER
Stated annual rate
Number of payments per year
I M
5.8
With a stated annual rate of 5%, compounded semiannually, the periodic rate
is 2 5%:
Periodic rate

The number of compounding periods is found with Equation 5.9:

With 10 years and semiannual compounding, there are 20 periods:

An investment costs $465 and is expected to produce cash flows of $100 at the
end of each of the next 4 years, then an extra lump sum payment of $200 at
the end of the fourth year. What is the expected rate of return on this
investment? (9.05%)
An investment costs $465 and is expected to produce cash flows of $100 at the
end of Year 1, $200 at the end of Year 2, and $300 at the end of Year 3. What is
the expected rate of return on this investment ? (11.71%)

Under semiannual compounding, our $100 investment will earn 2 5% every 6
months for 20 semiannual periods, not 5% per year for 10 years. The periodic rate
and number of periods, not the annual rate and number of years, must be shown
on time lines and entered into the calculator or spreadsheet whenever you are
working with nonannual compounding.12
With this background, we can find the value of $100 after 10 years if it is held
in an account that pays a stated annual rate of 5 0% but with semiannual com-
pounding. Here’s the time line and the future value:

number of periods:

The future value under semiannual compounding, $163 86, exceeds the FV under
annual compounding, $162 89, because interest starts accruing sooner; thus, you
earn more interest on interest.
How would things change in our example if interest was compounded quar-
terly or monthly or daily? With quarterly compounding, there would be
NM
10 4
40 periods and the periodic rate would be I M
5% 4
1 25%
per quarter. Using those values, we would find FV
$164 36. If we used monthly
compounding, we would have 10 12
120 periods, the monthly rate would
be 5% 12
0 416667%, and the FV would rise to $164 70. If we went to daily
compounding, we would have 10 365
3,650 periods, the daily rate would
be 5% 365
0 0136986% per day, and the FV would be $164 87 (based on a
365-day year).
The same logic applies when we find present values under semiannual com-
pounding. Again, we use Equation 5.8 to convert the stated annual rate to the
periodic (semiannual) rate and Equation 5.9 to find the number of semiannual
periods. We then use the periodic rate and number of periods in the calculations.
For example, we can find the PV of $100 due after 10 years when the stated annual
rate is 5%, with semiannual compounding:
Periodic rate
5% 2
2 5% per period
Number of periods
10 2
20 periods

$100

$61 03
12With some financial calculators, you can enter the annual (nominal) rate and the number of
compounding periods per year rather than make the conversions we recommend. We prefer the
conversions because they must be used on time lines and because it is easy to forget to reset your
calculator after you change its settings, which may lead to an error on your next problem.

If we increased the number of compounding periods from 2 (semiannual) to

5-16 COMPARING INTEREST RATES
Different compounding periods are used for different types of investments. For
example, bank accounts generally pay interest daily; most bonds pay interest
semiannually; stocks pay dividends quarterly; and mortgages, auto loans, and
other instruments require monthly payments.13 If we are to compare investments
or loans with different compounding periods properly, we need to put them on a
common basis. Here are some terms you need to understand:
•
The nominal interest rate (INOM), also called the annual percentage rate (APR)
(or quoted or stated rate), is the rate that credit card companies, student loan
officers, auto dealers, and other lenders tell you they are charging on loans.
Note that if two banks offer loans with a stated rate of 8% but one requires
monthly payments and the other quarterly payments, they are not charging
the same “true” rate. The one that requires monthly payments is charging
more than the one with quarterly payments because it will receive your
money sooner. So to compare loans across lenders, or interest rates earned
on different securities, you should calculate effective annual rates as
described here.14
S E L F T E S T
Would you rather invest in an account that pays 7% with annual compounding
or 7% with monthly compounding? Would you rather borrow at 7% and make
annual or monthly payments? Why?
What’s the future value of $100 after 3 years if the appropriate interest rate is 8%
compounded annually? Compounded monthly? ($125.97; $127.02)
What’s the present value of $100 due in three years if the appropriate interest
rate is 8% compounded annually? Compounded monthly? ($79.38; $78.73)
Annual Percentage Rate
(APR)
The periodic rate times the
number of periods per
year.
Nominal (Quoted, Or
Stated) Interest Rate, INOM
The contracted interest
rate.
13Some banks even pay interest compounded continuously. Continuous compounding is discussed in
Web Appendix 5A.
14Note, though, that if you are comparing two bonds that both pay interest semiannually, it’s OK
to compare their nominal rates. Similarly, you can compare the nominal rates on two money funds
that pay interest daily. But don’t compare the nominal rate on a semiannual bond with the nominal
rate on a money fund that compounds daily because that will make the money fund look worse than it
really is.

•
The effective annual rate, abbreviated EFF%, is also called the equivalent
annual rate (EAR). This is the rate that would produce the same future value
under annual compounding as would more frequent compounding at a given
nominal rate.
•
If a loan or an investment uses annual compounding, its nominal rate is also
its effective rate. However, if compounding occurs more than once a year, the
EFF% is higher than INOM.
•
To illustrate, a nominal rate of 10% with semiannual compounding is
equivalent to a rate of 10 25% with annual compounding because both rates
will cause $100 to grow to the same amount after 1 year. The top line in the
following diagram shows that $100 will grow to $110 25 at a nominal rate of
10 25%. The lower line shows the situation if the nominal rate is 10% but
semiannual compounding is used.

We can also use the EFFECT function in Excel to solve for the effective rate:
=EFFECT (0.1,2)
EFFECT(nominal_rate, npery)
Here we find that the effective rate is 10 25%. NPERY refers to the number of
payments per year. Likewise, if you know the effective rate and want to solve for
the nominal rate, you can use the NOMINAL function in Excel.15 Thus, if one
investment promises to pay 10% with semiannual compounding and an equally
risky investment promises 10 25% with annual compounding, we would be indif-
ferent between the two.
Effective (Equivalent)
Annual Rate (EFF% or EAR)
The annual rate of interest
actually being earned, as
opposed to the quoted
rate.
15Most financial calculators are programmed to find the EFF% or, given the EFF%, to find the nominal
rate. This is called interest rate conversion. You enter the nominal rate and the number of compounding
periods per year and then press the EFF% key to find the effective annual rate. However, we generally
use Equation 5.10 because it’s as easy to use as the interest conversion feature and the equation
reminds us of what we are really doing. If you use the interest rate conversion feature on your
calculator, don’t forget to reset your calculator settings. Interest rate conversion is discussed in the
calculator tutorials.

Q U E S T I O N :
You just received your first credit card and decided to purchase a new Apple iPad. You
charged the iPad’s $500 purchase price on your new credit card. Assume that the nominal
interest rate on the credit card is 18% and that interest is compounded monthly.
The minimum payment on the credit card is only $10 a month. If you pay the minimum and
make no other charges, how long will it take you to fully pay off the credit card?
A N S W E R :
Here we are given that the nominal interest rate is 18%. It follows that the monthly periodic
rate is 1 5% 18% 12 . Using a financial calculator, we can solve for the number of months
that it takes to pay off the credit card.

Here we find that it will take 93 11 months to pay off the credit card.
Note that it would take you almost 8 years to pay off your iPad purchase. Now, you see
why you can quickly get into financial trouble if you don’t manage your credit cards
wisely!
S E L F T E S T
Define the terms annual percentage rate (APR), effective annual rate (EFF%), and
nominal interest rate (INOM).
A bank pays 5% with daily compounding on its savings accounts. Should it
advertise the nominal or effective rate if it is seeking to attract new
deposits?
By law, credit card issuers must print their annual percentage rate on their
monthly statements. A common APR is 18% with interest paid monthly. What
is the EFF% on such a loan? [EFF% = (1 + 0.18/12)12 −1 = 0.1956 = 19.56%]
Some years ago banks didn’t have to reveal the rates they charged on credit
cards. Then Congress passed the Truth in Lending Act that required banks to
publish their APRs. Is the APR really the “most truthful” rate, or would the EFF%
be “more truthful”? Explain.

5-17 FRACTIONAL TIME PERIODS
Thus far we have assumed that payments occur at the beginning or the end of
periods but not within periods. However, we often encounter situations that
require compounding or discounting over fractional periods. For example, sup-
pose you deposited $100 in a bank that pays a nominal rate of 10% but adds
interest daily, based on a 365-day year. How much would you have after 9
months? The answer is $107 79, found as follows:16
Periodic rate
IPER
0 10 365
0 000273973 per day
Number of days
9 12 365
0 75 365
273 75 rounded to 274
Ending amount
$100 1 000273973
274
$107 79
Now suppose you borrow $100 from a bank whose nominal rate is 10% per
year simple interest, which means that interest is not earned on interest. If the loan
is outstanding for 274 days, how much interest would you have to pay? Here we
would calculate a daily interest rate, IPER, as just shown, but multiply it by 274
rather than use the 274 as an exponent:
Interest owed
$100 0 000273973 274
$7 51
You would owe the bank a total of $107 51 after 274 days. This is the procedure
that most banks use to calculate interest on loans, except that they require bor-
rowers to pay the interest on a monthly basis rather than after 274 days.
S E L F T E S T
Suppose a company borrowed $1 million at a rate of 9%, simple interest,
with interest paid at the end of each month. The bank uses a 360-day
year. How much interest would the firm have to pay in a 30-day month? What
would the interest be if the bank used a 365-day year? [(0.09/360)
(30) ($1,000,000) = $7,500 interest for the month. For the 365-day year,
(0.09/365)(30)($1,000,000) = $7,397.26 of interest. The use of a 360-day
year raises the interest cost by $102.74, which is why banks like to use it on
loans.]
Suppose you deposited $1,000 in a credit union account that pays 7% with daily
compounding and a 365-day year. What is the EFF%, and how much could you
withdraw after seven months, assuming this is seven-twelfths of a year? [EFF% =
(1 + 0.07/365)365 −1 = 0.07250098 = 7.250098%. Thus, your account would
grow from $1,000 to $1,000(1.07250098)0.583333 = $1,041.67, and you could
withdraw that amount.]
16Bank loan contracts specifically state whether they are based on a 360- or a 365-day year. If a 360-day
year is used, the daily rate is higher, which means that the effective rate is also higher. Here we
assumed a 365-day year. Also note that in real-world calculations, banks’ computers have built-in
calendars so they can calculate the exact number of days, taking account of 30-day, 31-day, and 28- or
29-day months.

5-18 AMORTIZED LOANS17
An important application of compound interest involves loans that are paid off in
installments over time. Included are automobile loans, home mortgage loans,
student loans, and many business loans. A loan that is to be repaid in equal
amounts on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis is called an amortized loan.18
Table 5.4 illustrates the amortization process. A homeowner borrows $100,000
on a mortgage loan, and the loan is to be repaid in five equal payments at the end
of each of the next 5 years.19 The lender charges 6% on the balance at the
beginning of each year. Our first task is to determine the payment the homeowner
must make each year. Here’s a picture of the situation:

Therefore, the borrower must pay the lender $23,739 64 per year for the next
5 years.
Each payment will consist of two parts—interest and repayment of principal.
This breakdown is shown on an amortization schedule such as the one in Table 5.4.
The interest component is relatively high in the first year, but it declines as the loan
balance decreases. For tax purposes, the borrower would deduct the interest com-
ponent while the lender would report the same amount as taxable income.
S E L F T E S T
Suppose you borrowed $30,000 on a student loan at a rate of 8% and must repay
it in three equal installments at the end of each of the next 3 years. How large
would your payments be, how much of the first payment would represent interest,
how much would be principal, and what would your ending balance be after the
first year? (PMT = $11,641.01; Interest = $2,400; Principal = $9,241.01; Balance
at end of Year 1 = $20,758.99)
Amortization Schedule
A table showing precisely
how a loan will be repaid.
It gives the required
payment on each
payment date and a
breakdown of the
payment, showing how
much is interest and how
much is repayment of
principal.
17Amortized loans are important, but this section can be omitted without loss of continuity.
18The word amortized comes from the Latin mors, meaning “death”; so an amortized loan is one that is
“killed off” over time.
19Most mortgage loans call for monthly payments over 10 to 30 years, but we use a shorter period to
reduce the calculations.
20You could also factor out the PMT term; find the value of the remaining summation term (4.212364);
and divide it into the $100,000 to find the payment, $23,739.64.
Amortized Loan
A loan that is repaid in
equal payments over its
life.

In this chapter, we worked with single payments, ordinary annuities, annuities
due, perpetuities, and uneven cash flow streams. One fundamental equation,
Equation 5.1, is used to calculate the future value of a given amount. The equation
can be transformed to Equation 5.2 and then used to find the present value of a
given future amount. We used time lines to show when cash flows occur; and we
saw that time value problems can be solved in a step-by-step manner when we
work with individual cash flows, with formulas that streamline the approach, with
financial calculators, and with spreadsheets.
As we noted at the outset, TVM is the single most important concept in finance
and the procedures developed in Chapter 5 are used throughout this book. Time
value analysis is used to find the values of stocks, bonds, and capital budgeting
projects. It is also used to analyze personal finance problems, such as the retire-
ment issue set forth in the opening vignette. You will become more familiar with
time value analysis as you go through the book, but we strongly recommend that
you get a good handle on Chapter 5 before you continue.

Notes:
aInterest in each period is calculated by multiplying the loan balance at the beginning of the
year by the interest rate. Therefore, interest in Year 1 is $100,000.00(0.06) = $6,000; in Year 2, it is
$4,935.62; and so forth.
bRepayment of principal is equal to the payment of $23,739.64 minus the interest charge for
the year.

QUESTIONS
5-1
What is an opportunity cost? How is this concept used in TVM analysis, and where is it
shown on a time line? Is a single number used in all situations? Explain.
5-2
Explain whether the following statement is true or false: $100 a year for 10 years is an
annuity; but $100 in Year 1, $200 in Year 2, and $400 in Years 3 through 10 does not
constitute an annuity. However, the second series contains an annuity.
5-3
If a firm’s earnings per share grew from $1 to $2 over a 10-year period, the total growth
would be 100%, but the annual growth rate would be less than 10%. True or false? Explain.
(Hint: If you aren’t sure, plug in some numbers and check it out.)
5-4
Would you rather have a savings account that pays 5% interest compounded semiannually
or one that pays 5% interest compounded daily? Explain.
5-5
To find the present value of an uneven series of cash flows, you must find the PVs of the
individual cash flows and then sum them. Annuity procedures can never be of use, even
when some of the cash flows constitute an annuity, because the entire series is not an
annuity. True or false? Explain.
5-6
The present value of a perpetuity is equal to the payment on the annuity, PMT, divided by
the interest rate, I
PV
PMT I. What is the future value of a perpetuity of PMT dollars per
year? (Hint: The answer is infinity, but explain why.)
5-7
Banks and other lenders are required to disclose a rate called the APR. What is this rate?
Why did Congress require that it be disclosed? Is it the same as the effective annual rate? If
you were comparing the costs of loans from different lenders, could you use their APRs to
determine the loan with the lowest effective interest rate? Explain.
5-8
What is a loan amortization schedule, and what are some ways these schedules are used?

PV AND LOAN ELIGIBILITY
You have saved $4,000 for a down payment on a new car. The
largest monthly payment you can afford is $350. The loan will have a 12% APR based on

Could your choice of banks be influenced by the fact that you might want to withdraw
your funds during the year as opposed to at the end of the year? Assume that your
funds must be left on deposit during an entire compounding period in order to receive
any interest.

NOMINAL INTEREST RATE AND EXTENDING CREDIT
As a jewelry store manager, you
want to offer credit, with interest on outstanding balances paid monthly. To carry receiv-
ables, you must borrow funds from your bank at a nominal 6%, monthly compounding. To
offset your overhead, you want to charge your customers an EAR (or EFF
) that is 2%
more than the bank is charging you. What APR rate should you charge your customers?
5-29
BUILDING CREDIT COST INTO PRICES
Your firm sells for cash only, but it is thinking of
offering credit, allowing customers 90 days to pay. Customers understand the time value of
money, so they would all wait and pay on the 90th day. To carry these receivables, you
would have to borrow funds from your bank at a nominal 12%, daily compounding based
on a 360-day year. You want to increase your base prices by exactly enough to offset your
bank interest cost. To the closest whole percentage point, by how much should you raise
your product prices?

REACHING A FINANCIAL GOAL
Erika and Kitty, who are twins, just received $30,000 each for
their 25th birthday. They both have aspirations to become millionaires. Each plans to make a
$5,000 annualcontribution to her“early retirement fund” on herbirthday, beginninga yearfrom
today. Erika opened an account with the Safety First Bond Fund, a mutual fund that invests in
high-quality bonds whose investors have earned 6% per year in the past. Kitty invested in the
New Issue Bio-Tech Fund, which invests in small, newly issued bio-tech stocks and whose
investors have earned an average of 20% per year in the fund’s relatively short history.
a.
If the two women’s funds earn the same returns in the future as in the past, how old
will each be when she becomes a millionaire?
b.
How large would Erika’s annual contributions have to be for her to become a
millionaire at the same age as Kitty, assuming their expected returns are realized?

AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT
You want to buy a house that
costs $100,000. You have $10,000 for a down payment, but your credit is such that mort-
gage companies will not lend you the required $90,000. However, the realtor persuades the
seller to take a $90,000 mortgage (called a seller take-back mortgage) at a rate of 7%,
provided the loan is paid off in full in 3 years. You expect to inherit $100,000 in 3 years;
but right now all you have is $10,000, and you can afford to make payments of no more
than $7,500 per year given your salary. (The loan would call for monthly payments, but
assume end-of-year annual payments to simplify things.)
a.
If the loan was amortized over 3 years, how large would each annual payment be?
Could you afford those payments?

If the loan was amortized over 30 years, what would each payment be? Could you
afford those payments?

NONANNUAL COMPOUNDING
a.
You plan to make five deposits of $1,000 each, one every 6 months, with the first payment
being made in 6 months. You will then make no more deposits. If the bank pays 4% nominal
interest, compounded semiannually, how much will be in your account after 3 years?
b.
One year from today you must make a payment of $10,000. To prepare for this payment,
you plan to make two equal quarterly deposits (at the end of Quarters 1 and 2) in a bank
that pays 4% nominal interest compounded quarterly. How large must each of the two
payments be?

PV AND A LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT
It is now December 31, 2013 t
0 , and a jury just found
in favor of a woman who sued the city for injuries sustained in a January 2012 accident. She
requested recovery of lost wages plus $100,000 for pain and suffering plus $20,000 for legal
expenses. Her doctor testified that she has been unable to work since the accident and that she
will not be able to work in the future. She is now 62, and the jury decided that she would have
worked for another 3 years. She was scheduled to have earned $34,000 in 2012. (To simplify
this problem, assume that the entire annual salary amount would have been received on
December 31, 2012.) Her employer testified that she probably would have received raises of
3% per year. The actual payment for the jury award will be made on December 31, 2014. The
judge stipulated that all dollar amounts are to be adjusted to a present value basis on
December 31, 2014, using a 7% annual interest rate and using compound, not simple, interest.
Furthermore, he stipulated that the pain and suffering and legal expenses should be based on a
December 31, 2013, date. How large a check must the city write on December 31, 2014?

REQUIRED ANNUITY PAYMENTS
A father is now planning a savings program to put his
daughter through college. She is 13, plans to enroll at the university in 5 years, and should
graduate 4 years later. Currently, the annual cost (for everything—food, clothing, tuition, books,
transportation, and so forth) is $15,000, but these costs are expected to increase by 5% annually.
The college requires total payment at the start of the year. She now has $7,500 in a college
savings account that pays 6% annually. Her father will make six equal annual deposits into her
account; the first deposit today and the sixth on the day she starts college. How large must each
of the six payments be? [Hint: Calculate the cost (inflated at 5%) for each year of college and find
the total present value of those costs, discounted at 6%, as of the day she enters college. Then
find the compounded value of her initial $7,500 on that same day. The difference between the
PV of costs and the amount that would be in the savings account must be made up by the
father’s deposits, so find the six equal payments that will compound to the required amount.]

Interest Rates Remain Low as the Economy Recovers from
Recession and Financial Crisis
The U.S. economy performed well from the early
1990s through 2007. Economic growth was
positive, unemployment was fairly low, and
inflation remained under control. One reason
for the economy’s good performance was the
low level of interest rates over most of that
period, with the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds
generally at or below 5%, a level last seen in the
1960s, and rates on most other bonds corre-
spondingly
low.
These
low
interest
rates
reduced the cost of capital for businesses, which
encouraged corporate investment. They also
stimulated consumer spending and helped pro-
duce a massive growth in the housing market.
Indeed, some critics argue that by keeping inter-
est rates too low for too long, the Federal
Reserve and other policymakers contributed to
an unsustainable boom in housing prices.
When the housing market collapsed, many
homeowners struggled to pay their mortgages
and the financial institutions holding these
mortgages suffered huge losses. In this environ-
ment financial institutions no longer felt com-
fortable lending to other financial institutions,
turning a bad situation into a full-blown finan-
cial crisis. Struggling to survive, many banks
stopped providing credit to individuals and
businesses, and this helped push the economy
into a deep recession. To keep the economy
afloat, the Federal Reserve maintained extremely
low interest rates. Five years after the crisis, it
appears that policymakers have successfully
kept the economy from completely collapsing,
but the economy is still weak and unemploy-
ment remains stubbornly high.
In response to the economy’s continued
sluggishness, the Federal Reserve has re-doubled
its efforts to strengthen the economy with its
policy of “quantitative easing.” Through this pol-
icy, the Fed has systematically purchased large

amounts of longer-term financial assets from leading financial
institutions. The Fed pays for these assets by injecting new
funds into the economy, which helps put downward pressure
on interest rates. In December 2012, the Federal Reserve
announced that it would maintain this policy until the unem-
ployment rate fell below 6.5% or the inflation rate rose above
2.5%. As a result of their actions, the 10-year Treasury rate was
pushed below 2%, and shorter-term Treasury rates were close
to zero.
Six months later, as the economy began to show signs
of life, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its policy. However,
the Federal Reserve also suggested that in the months
ahead it might “taper” its aggressive bond-buying program.
In response, the 10-year Treasury rate rose above 2.5%.
While the Federal Reserve has a tremendous influence on
interest rates, other factors have helped keep interest
rates low. Most notably, inflation remains low, and foreign
investors have maintained a strong willingness to purchase
U.S. securities. Looking ahead, there is a concern that some of
these forces may start working in reverse. While the Federal
Reserve has kept interest rates low for the time being, there
are fears that we will pay the price later in the form of higher
inflation. At the same time, a rapidly growing federal budget
deficit is also pushing upward pressure on interest rates. To
the extent that deficits and inflation fears combine with a
weakening dollar, foreign investors may sell U.S. bonds, which
would put even more upward pressure on rates.
Because corporations and individuals are greatly affected
by interest rates, this chapter takes a closer look at the major
factors that determine those rates. As we will see, there is no
single interest rate—various factors determine the rate that
each borrower pays—and in some cases, rates on different
types of debt move in different directions. With these issues in
mind, we will also consider the various factors influencing the
spreads between long- and short-term interest rates and
between Treasury and corporate bonds.

Companies raise capital in two main forms: debt and equity. In a free economy, capital,
like other items, is allocated through a market system, where funds are transferred and
prices are established. The interest rate is the price that lenders receive and borrowers
pay for debt capital. Similarly, equity investors expect to receive dividends and capital
gains, the sum of which represents the cost of equity. We take up the cost of equity in a
later chapter, but our focus in this chapter is on the cost of debt. We begin by examining
the factors that affect the supply of and demand for capital, which, in turn, affects the
cost of money. We will see that there is no single interest rate—interest rates on different
types of debt vary depending on the borrower’s risk, the use of the funds borrowed, the
type of collateral used to back the loan, and the length of time the money is needed. In
this chapter, we concentrate mainly on how these various factors affect the cost of debt
for individuals; but in later chapters, we delve into the cost of debt for a business and its
role in investment decisions. As you will see in Chapters 7 and 9, the cost of debt is a key
determinant of bond and stock prices; it is also an important component of the cost of
corporate capital, which we cover in Chapter 10.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
List the various factors that influence the cost of money.
•
Discuss how market interest rates are affected by borrowers’ need for capital,
expected inflation, different securities’ risks, and securities’ liquidity.
•
Explain what the yield curve is, what determines its shape, and how you can use the
yield curve to help forecast future interest rates.

6-1 THE COST OF MONEY
The four most fundamental factors affecting the cost of money are (1) production
opportunities, (2) time preferences for consumption, (3) risk, and (4) inflation. To
see how these factors operate, visualize an isolated island community where people
live on fish. They have a stock of fishing gear that permits them to survive reason-
ably well, but they would like to have more fish. Now suppose one of the island’s
inhabitants, Mr. Crusoe, had a bright idea for a new type of fishnet that would
enable him to double his daily catch. However, it would take him a year to perfect
the design, build the net, and learn to use it efficiently. Mr. Crusoe would probably
starve before he could put his new net into operation. Therefore, he might suggest
to Ms. Robinson, Mr. Friday, and several others that if they would give him one fish
each day for a year, he would return two fish a day the next year. If someone
accepted the offer, the fish that Ms. Robinson and the others gave to Mr. Crusoe
would constitute savings, these savings would be invested in the fishnet, and the
extra fish the net produced would constitute a return on the investment.
Obviously, the more productive Mr. Crusoe thought the new fishnet would be,
the more he could afford to offer potential investors for their savings. In this
example, we assume that Mr. Crusoe thought he would be able to pay (and thus
he offered) a 100% rate of return—he offered to give back two fish for every one he
received. He might have tried to attract savings for less—for example, he might have
offered only 1 5 fish per day next year for every one he received this year, which
would represent a 50% rate of return to Ms. Robinson and the other potential savers.
How attractive Mr. Crusoe’s offer appeared to a potential saver would
depend in large part on the saver’s time preference for consumption. For example,
Ms. Robinson might be thinking of retirement, and she might be willing to trade
fish today for fish in the future on a one-for-one basis. On the other hand, Mr.
Friday might have a wife and several young children and need his current fish; so
he might be unwilling to “lend” a fish today for anything less than three fish next
year. Mr. Friday would be said to have a high time preference for current
consumption, and Ms. Robinson, a low time preference. Note also that if the entire
population was living right at the subsistence level, time preferences for current
consumption would necessarily be high, aggregate savings would be low, interest
rates would be high, and capital formation would be difficult.
The risk inherent in the fishnet project (and thus in Mr. Crusoe’s ability to
repay the loan) also affects the return that investors require: The higher the
perceived risk, the higher the required rate of return. Also, in a more complex
society, there are many businesses like Mr. Crusoe’s, many goods other than fish,
and many savers like Ms. Robinson and Mr. Friday. Therefore, people use money
as a medium of exchange rather than barter with fish. When money is used, its
value in the future, which is affected by inflation, comes into play: The higher the
expected rate of inflation, the larger the required dollar return. We discuss this
point in detail later in the chapter.
Thus, we see that the interest rate paid to savers depends (1) on the rate of return that
producers expect to earn on invested capital, (2) on savers’ time preferences for current
versus future consumption, (3) on the riskiness of the loan, and (4) on the expected future
rate of inflation. Producers’ expected returns on their business investments set an
upper limit to how much they can pay for savings, while consumers’ time
preferences for consumption establish how much consumption they are willing
to defer and, hence, how much they will save at different interest rates.1 Higher
risk and higher inflation also lead to higher interest rates.
1The term producers in this example is too narrow. A better word might be borrowers, which would
include corporations, home purchasers, people borrowing to go to college, and even people borrowing
to buy autos or to pay for vacations. Also, the wealth of a society and its demographics influence its
people's ability to save and thus their time preferences for current versus future consumption.

6-2 INTEREST RATE LEVELS
Borrowers bid for the available supply of debt capital using interest rates: The
firms with the most profitable investment opportunities are willing and able to
pay the most for capital, so they tend to attract it away from inefficient firms and
firms whose products are not in demand. At the same time, government policy
can also influence the allocation of capital and the level of interest rates. For
example, the federal government has agencies that help designated individuals
or groups obtain credit on favorable terms. Among those eligible for this kind of
assistance are small businesses, certain minorities, and firms willing to build
plants in areas with high unemployment. Still, most capital in the United States
is allocated through the price system, where the interest rate is the price.
Figure 6.1 shows how supply and demand interact to determine interest rates
in two capital markets. Markets L and H represent two of the many capital
markets in existence. The supply curve in each market is upward-sloping, which
indicates that investors are willing to supply more capital the higher the interest
rate they receive on their capital. Likewise, the downward-sloping demand curve
indicates that borrowers will borrow more if interest rates are lower. The interest
rate in each market is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect.
The going interest rate, designated as r, is initially 5% for the low-risk securities in
Market L. Borrowers whose credit is strong enough to participate in this market
can obtain funds at a cost of 5%, and investors who want to put their money to

work without much risk can obtain a 5% return. Riskier borrowers must obtain
higher-cost funds in Market H, where investors who are more willing to take risks
expect to earn a 7% return but also realize that they might receive much less. In
this scenario, investors are willing to accept the higher risk in Market H in
exchange for a risk premium of 7% −5%
2%.
Now let’s assume that because of changing market forces, investors perceive
that Market H has become relatively more risky. This changing perception will
induce many investors to shift toward safer investments—referred to as a “flight to
quality.” As investors move their money from Market H to Market L, the supply of
funds is increased in Market L from S1 to S2; and the increased availability of capital
will push down interest rates in this market from 5% to 4%. At the same time, as
investors move their money out of Market H, there will be a decreased supply of
funds in that market; and tighter credit in that market will force interest rates up
from 7% to 8%. In this new environment, money is transferred from Market H to
Market L and the risk premium rises from 2% to 8% −4%
4%.
There are many capital markets in the United States, and Figure 6.1 highlights
the fact that they are interconnected. U.S. firms also invest and raise capital
throughout the world, and foreigners both borrow and lend in the United States.
There are markets for home loans; farm loans; business loans; federal, state, and
local government loans; and consumer loans. Within each category, there are
regional markets as well as different types of sub-markets. For example, in real
estate, there are separate markets for first and second mortgages and for loans on
single-family homes, apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, and vacant
land. And, of course, there are separate markets for prime and subprime mortgage
loans. Within the business sector, there are dozens of types of debt securities and
there are several different markets for common stocks.
There is a price for each type of capital, and these prices change over time as
supply and demand conditions change. Figure 6.2 shows how long- and short-
term interest rates to business borrowers have varied since the early 1970s. Notice
that short-term interest rates are especially volatile, rising rapidly during booms
and falling equally rapidly during recessions. (The shaded areas of the chart
indicate recessions.) In particular, note the dramatic drop in short-term interest
rates during the recent recession. When the economy is expanding, firms need
capital; and this demand pushes rates up. Inflationary pressures are strongest
during business booms, also exerting upward pressure on rates. Conditions are
reversed during recessions: Slack business reduces the demand for credit, inflation
falls, and the Federal Reserve increases the supply of funds to help stimulate the
economy. The result is a decline in interest rates.
These tendencies do not hold exactly, as demonstrated by the period after
1984. Oil prices fell dramatically in 1985 and 1986, reducing inflationary pressures
on other prices and easing fears of serious long-term inflation. Earlier these fears
had pushed interest rates to record levels. The economy from 1984 to 1987 was
strong, but the declining fears of inflation more than offset the normal tendency
for interest rates to rise during good economic times; the net result was lower
interest rates.2
The relationship between inflation and long-term interest rates is highlighted
in Figure 6.3, which plots inflation over time along with long-term interest rates.
In the early 1960s, inflation averaged 1% per year and interest rates on high-
quality long-term bonds averaged 4%. Then the Vietnam War heated up, leading
to an increase in inflation; and interest rates began an upward climb. When the
war ended in the early 1970s, inflation dipped a bit; but then the 1973 Arab oil
2Short-term rates are responsive to current economic conditions, whereas long-term rates primarily
reflect long-run expectations for inflation. As a result, short-term rates are sometimes above and
sometimes below long-term rates. The relationship between long-term and short-term rates is called
the term structure of interest rates, and it is discussed later in this chapter.

embargo led to rising oil prices, much higher inflation rates, and sharply higher
interest rates.
Inflation peaked at about 13% in 1980. But interest rates continued to increase
into 1981 and 1982, and they remained quite high until 1985 because people feared
another increase in inflation. Thus, the “inflationary psychology” created during
the 1970s persisted until the mid-1980s. People gradually realized that the Federal
Reserve was serious about keeping inflation down, that global competition was
keeping U.S. auto producers and other corporations from raising prices as they
had in the past, and that constraints on corporate price increases were diminishing
labor unions’ ability to push through cost-increasing wage hikes. As these realiza-
tions set in, interest rates declined.
The current interest rate minus the current inflation rate (which is also the gap
between the inflation bars and the interest rate curve in Figure 6.3) is defined as
the “current real rate of interest.” It is called a “real rate” because it shows how
much investors really earned after the effects of inflation are removed. The real
rate was extremely high during the mid-1980s, but it has generally been in the
range of 1% to 4% since 1987.3
In recent years, inflation has been quite low, averaging about 2% a year, and it
was even negative in 2009, as prices fell in the midst of the deep recession.
However, long-term interest rates have been volatile because investors are not

6-3 THE DETERMINANTS OF MARKET INTEREST RATES
In general, the quoted (or nominal) interest rate on a debt security, r, is composed
of a real risk-free rate, r*, plus several premiums that reflect inflation, the security’s
risk, its liquidity (or marketability), and the years to its maturity. This relationship
can be expressed as follows:
Quoted interest rate
r
r
IP
DRP
LP
MRP
6.1
Where:
r = the quoted, or nominal, rate of interest on a given security.4
r* = the real risk-free rate of interest, r* is pronounced “r-star,” and it is
the rate that would exist on a riskless security in a world where no
inflation was expected.
rRF = r* + IP. It is the quoted rate on a risk-free security such as a U.S.
Treasury bill, which is very liquid and is free of most types of risk.
Note that the premium for expected inflation, IP, is included in rRF.
IP = inflation premium. IP is equal to the average expected rate of infla-
tion over the life of the security. The expected future inflation rate is
not necessarily equal to the current inflation rate, so IP is not neces-
sarily equal to current inflation as shown in Figure 6.3.
DRP = default risk premium. This premium reflects the possibility that the
issuer will not pay the promised interest or principal at the stated
time. DRP is zero for U.S. Treasury securities, but it rises as the
riskiness of the issuer increases.
LP = liquidity (or marketability) premium. This is a premium charged by
lenders to reflect the fact that some securities cannot be converted to
cash on short notice at a “reasonable” price. LP is very low for
Treasury securities and for securities issued by large, strong firms;
but it is relatively high on securities issued by small, privately
held firms.
MRP = maturity risk premium. As we will explain later, longer-term bonds,
even Treasury bonds, are exposed to a significant risk of price
declines due to increases in inflation and interest rates; and a matu-
rity risk premium is charged by lenders to reflect this risk.
Because rRF
r
IP, we can rewrite Equation 6.1 as follows:
Nominal, or quoted, rate
r
rRF
DRP
LP
MRP
We discuss the components whose sum makes up the quoted, or nominal, rate on
a given security in the following sections.
6-3A THE REAL RISK-FREE RATE OF INTEREST, r*
The real risk-free rate of interest, r*, is the interest rate that would exist on a
riskless security if no inflation were expected. It may be thought of as the rate of
interest on short-term U.S. Treasury securities in an inflation-free world. The real
4The term nominal as it is used here means the stated rate as opposed to the real rate, where the real rate
is adjusted to remove inflation's effects. If you had bought a 30-year Treasury bond in February 2013,
the quoted, or nominal, rate would have been about 3.2%; but if inflation averages 2.0% over the next
30 years, the real rate would turn out to be about 3.2% −2.0% = 1.2%. Also note that in later chapters,
when we discuss both debt and equity, we use the subscripts d and s to designate returns on debt and
stock, that is, rd and rs.
Real Risk-Free Rate of
interest, r*
The rate of interest that
would exist on default-free
U.S. Treasury securities if
no inflation were
expected.

risk-free rate is not static—it changes over time depending on economic condi-
tions, especially on (1) the rate of return that corporations and other borrowers
expect to earn on productive assets and (2) people’s time preferences for current
versus future consumption. Borrowers’ expected returns on real assets set an
upper limit on how much borrowers can afford to pay for funds, while savers’
time preferences for consumption establish how much consumption savers will
defer—hence, the amount of money they will lend at different interest rates. It is
difficult to measure the real risk-free rate precisely, but most experts think that r*
has typically fluctuated in the range of 1% to 3% in recent years.5 The best
estimate of r* is the rate of return on indexed Treasury bonds, which are discussed
later in the chapter.
6-3B THE NOMINAL, OR QUOTED, RISK-FREE RATE OF
INTEREST, rRF
r
IP
The nominal, or quoted, risk-free rate, rRF, is the real risk-free rate plus a
premium for expected inflation: rRF
r
IP. To be strictly correct, the risk-free
rate should be the interest rate on a totally risk-free security—one that has no
default risk, no maturity risk, no liquidity risk, no risk of loss if inflation increases,
and no risk of any other type. However, as the recent downgrade of U.S.
Treasuries illustrates, there is no such security, hence, there is no observable truly
risk-free rate. However, one security is free of most risks—a Treasury Inflation
Protected Security (TIPS), whose value increases with inflation. Short-term TIPS
are free of default, maturity, and liquidity risks and of risk due to changes in
the general level of interest rates. However, they are not free of changes in the
real rate.6
If the term risk-free rate is used without the modifiers real or nominal, people
generally mean the quoted (or nominal) rate; and we follow that convention in this
book. Therefore, when we use the term risk-free rate, rRF, we mean the nominal
risk-free rate, which includes an inflation premium equal to the average expected
inflation rate over the remaining life of the security. In general, we use the T-bill
rate to approximate the short-term risk-free rate and the T-bond rate to approx-
imate the long-term risk-free rate. So whenever you see the term risk-free rate,
assume that we are referring to the quoted U.S. T-bill rate or to the quoted T-bond
rate. Our definition of the risk-free rate assumes that, despite the recent down-
grade, Treasury securities have no meaningful default risk. And for convenience,
we will assume in our subsequent problems and examples that Treasury securities
have no default risk.
Nominal, (Quoted)
Risk-Free Rate, rRF
The rate of interest on a
security that is free of all
risk; rRF is proxied by the
T-bill rate or the T-bond
rate; rRF includes an
inflation premium.
5The real rate of interest as discussed here is different from the current real rate as discussed in
connection with Figure 6.3. The current real rate is the current interest rate minus the current (or
latest past) inflation rate, while the real rate (without the word current) is the current interest rate minus
the expected future inflation rate over the life of the security. For example, suppose the current quoted
rate for a one-year Treasury bill is 2.0%, inflation during the latest year was 1.0%, and inflation
expected for the coming year is 1.5%. The current real rate would be 2.0% −1.0% = 1.0%, but the
expected real rate would be 2.0% −1.5% = 0.5%. The rate on a 10-year bond would be related to
the average expected inflation rate over the next 10 years, and so on. In the press, the term real rate
generally means the current real rate; but in economics and finance (hence, in this book unless
otherwise noted), the real rate means the one based on expected inflation rates.
6Indexed Treasury securities are the closest thing we have to a riskless security, but even they are not
totally riskless because r* can change and cause a decline in the prices of these securities. For example,
between its issue date in April 1998 and December 2000, the price of the TIPS that matures on April 15,
2028, declined because during this time period the real rate on long-term securities increased.
Conversely, between December 2000 and February 2013, the real rate on this security has decreased.
As a result, the bond’s price during this time increased almost 48%.

6-3C INFLATION PREMIUM (IP)
Inflation has a major impact on interest rates because it erodes the real value of
what you receive from the investment. To illustrate, suppose you have saved
$10,000 to purchase a car. Rather than buying a car today, you could invest the
money with the hope of buying a better car one year from now. If you decide to
invest in a one-year Treasury bill that pays a 1% interest rate, you will have a little
bit more money ($10,100—your original money plus $100 in interest) at the end of
the year. Now suppose that the overall inflation rate increased by 3% that year. In
this case, a similar version of the $10,000 car that you would have purchased at the
beginning of the year would cost 3% more $10,300 at the end of the year. Notice,
in this case, the additional interest that you earn on the Treasury bill is not enough
to compensate for the expected increase in the price of the car. In real terms you are
worse off because the nominal interest rate is less than the expected inflation rate.
Investors are well aware of all this; so when they lend money, they build an
inflation premium (IP) equal to the average expected inflation rate over the life of
the security into the rate they charge. As discussed previously, the actual interest
rate on a short-term default-free U.S. Treasury bill, rT-bill, would be the real risk-
free rate, r*, plus the inflation premium (IP):
rT-bill
rRF
r
IP
Therefore, if the real risk-free rate was r
1 7% and if inflation was expected to
be 1 5% (and hence IP
1 5% during the next year, the quoted rate of interest on
one-year T-bills would be 1 7%
1 5%
3 2%.
It is important to note that the inflation rate built into interest rates is the
inflation rate expected in the future, not the rate experienced in the past. Thus, the
latest reported figures might show an annual inflation rate of 3% over the past
12 months, but that is for the past year. If people, on average, expect a 4% inflation
rate in the future, 4% would be built into the current interest rate. Note also that
the inflation rate reflected in the quoted interest rate on any security is the average
inflation rate expected over the security’s life. Thus, the inflation rate built into
a 1-year bond is the expected inflation rate for the next year, but the inflation rate
built into a 30-year bond is the average inflation rate expected over the next
30 years.7
Expectations for future inflation are closely, but not perfectly, correlated with
past inflation rates. Therefore, if the inflation rate reported for last month increased,
people would tend to raise their expectations for future inflation; and this change in
expectations would increase current rates. Also, consumer prices change with a lag
following changes at the producer level. Thus, if the price of oil increases this month,
gasoline prices are likely to increase in the coming months. This lagged situation
between final product and producer goods prices exists throughout the economy.
Note that Japan and Switzerland have, over the past several years, had lower
inflation rates than the United States; hence, their interest rates have generally
been lower than those of the United States. The United Kingdom, Australia, and
most South American countries have experienced higher inflation, so their rates
have been higher than those of the United States. For example, in February 2013,
Brazil’s inflation rate was around 6%, while the Central Bank’s benchmark interest

Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Japan, and Great Britain.
7To be theoretically precise, we should use a geometric average. Also, because millions of investors are active
in the market, it is impossible to determine exactly the consensus-expected inflation rate. Survey data are
available, however, that give us a reasonably good idea of what investors expect over the next few years. For
example, in 1980, the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center reported that people expected
inflation during the next year to be 11.9% and that the average rate of inflation expected over the next 5 to
10 years was 10.5%. Those expectations led to record-high interest rates. However, the economy cooled
thereafter; and as Figure 6.3 showed, actual inflation dropped sharply. This led to a gradual reduction in the
expected future inflation rate; and as inflationary expectations dropped, so did quoted market interest rates.

expected inflation that
investors add to the real
risk-free rate of return.

rate was above 7%. On the other hand, the U.S. inflation rate was much lower
(around 2% and the Fed’s targeted interest rate was 0 25%.
6-3D DEFAULT RISK PREMIUM (DRP)
The risk that a borrower will default, which means the borrower will not make
scheduled interest or principal payments, also affects the market interest rate on a
bond: The greater the bond’s risk of default, the higher the market rate. Once again,
we are assuming that Treasury securities have no default risk; hence, they carry the
lowest interest rates on taxable securities in the United States. For corporate bonds,
bond ratings are often used to measure default risk. The higher the bond’s rating, the
lower its default risk and, consequently, the lower its interest rate.8 The difference
between the quoted interest rate on a T-bond and that on a corporate bond with similar
maturity, liquidity, and other features is the default risk premium (DRP). The average
default risk premiums vary over time, and tend to get larger when the economy is
weaker and borrowers are more likely to have a hard time paying off their debts.
6-3E LIQUIDITY PREMIUM (LP)
A “liquid” asset can be converted to cash quickly at a “fair market value.” Real
assets are generally less liquid than financial assets, but different financial assets
vary in their liquidity. Because they prefer assets that are more liquid, investors
include a liquidity premium (LP) in the rates charged on different debt securities.
Although it is difficult to measure liquidity premiums accurately, we can get some
sense of an asset’s liquidity by looking at its trading volume. Assets with higher
trading volume are generally easier to sell, and are therefore more liquid. The
average liquidity premiums also vary over time. During the recent financial crisis,
the liquidity premiums on many assets soared. The market for many assets that
were once highly liquid suddenly dried up as everyone rushed to sell them at
the same time. The liquidity of real assets also varies over time. For example, at the
height of the housing boom, many homes in “hot” real estate markets were often
sold the first day they were listed. After the bubble burst, homes in these same
markets often sat unsold for months.
6-3F INTEREST RATE RISK AND THE MATURITY RISK
PREMIUM (MRP)
Despite a few recent concerns about the Treasury’s long-run ability to service its
growing debt, we generally assume that U.S. Treasury securities are free of default
risk in the sense that one can be virtually certain that the federal government will
pay interest on its bonds and pay them off when they mature. Therefore, we
assume that the default risk premium on Treasury securities is zero. Further,
active markets exist for Treasury securities, so we assume that their liquidity
premium is also zero.9 Thus, as a first approximation, the rate of interest on a
Treasury security should be the risk-free rate, rRF, which is the real risk-free rate
plus an inflation premium, rRF
r
IP. However, the prices of long-term bonds
decline whenever interest rates rise; and because interest rates can and do occa-
sionally rise, all long-term bonds, even Treasury bonds, have an element of
risk called interest rate risk. As a general rule, the bonds of any organization

8Bond ratings and bonds’ riskiness in general are discussed in detail in Chapter 7. For now, merely note
that bonds rated AAA are judged to have less default risk than bonds rated AA, while AA bonds are
less risky than A bonds, and so forth. Ratings are designated AAA or Aaa, AA or Aa, and so forth,
depending on the rating agency. In this book, the designations are used interchangeably.
9While it is a reasonable approximation to assume that the liquidity premium is zero for Treasury
securities, in reality some Treasury securities are more liquid than others. In particular, bonds tend to
be less liquid if it has been a long time since the bonds were originally issued.

AN ALMOST RISKLESS TREASURY BOND
Investors who purchase bonds must constantly worry about
inflation. If inflation turns out to be greater than expected,
bonds will provide a lower-than-expected real return. To
protect themselves against expected increases in inflation,
investors build an inflation risk premium into their required
rate of return. This raises borrowers’ costs.
To provide investors with an inflation-protected bond and
to reduce the cost of debt to the government, the U.S.
Treasury issues Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS),
which are bonds that are indexed to inflation. For example,
in 2009, the Treasury issued 10-year TIPS with a 21/8% cou-
pon. These bonds pay an interest rate of 21/8% plus an
additional amount that is just sufficient to offset inflation.
At the end of each 6-month period, the principal (originally
set at par or $1,000) is adjusted by the inflation rate. To
understand how TIPS work, consider that during the first
6-month interest period, inflation (as measured by the CPI)
declined by 0.55% (1/15/09 CPI = 214.69971 and 7/15/09
CPI = 213.51819). The inflation-adjusted principal was then
calculated as $1,000(1 −0.0055) = $1,000 × 0.9945 =
$994.50. So on July 15, 2009, each bond paid interest of
(0.02125/2) × $994.50 = $10.57. Note that the interest rate is
divided by 2 because interest on Treasury (and most other)
bonds is paid twice a year. This same adjustment process
will continue each year until the bonds mature on January
15, 2019, at which time they will pay the adjusted maturity
value. On January 15, 2013, the change in the CPI from when
the bonds were originally issued was 7.509%. The inflation-
adjusted principal was calculated as $1,000 × 1.07509 =
$1,075.09. So on January 15, 2013, each bond paid interest
of (0.02125/2) × $1,075.09 = $11.42. Thus, the cash income
provided by the bonds rises and falls by exactly enough to
cover inflation or a decline in inflation, producing a real
inflation-adjusted rate of 21/8% for those who hold the bond
from its original issue date until its maturity. Further,
because the principal also rises and falls by the inflation rate
or its decline, it too is protected from inflation.
Both the annual interest received and the increase in
principal are taxed each year as interest income, even
though cash from the appreciation will not be received until
the bond matures. Therefore, these bonds are not good for
accounts subject to current income taxes; but they are excel-
lent for individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)
plans, which are not taxed until funds are withdrawn.
The Treasury regularly conducts auctions to issue indexed
bonds. The 21/8% coupon rate was based on the relative
supply and demand for the issue, and it will remain fixed
over the life of the bond. However, after the bonds are issued,
they continue to trade in the open market; and their price will
vary as investors’ perceptions of the real rate of interest
changes. Indeed, as we can see in the following graph, the
real rate of interest on this bond has varied quite a bit since it
was issued; and as the real rate changes, so does the price of
the bond. Real rates fell in early 2009, but rose from April to
July of that same year. After July 2009, real rates fell again,
then rose in the latter half of 2010 and early 2011, and fell
again during 2012. However midway through 2013, real rates
have begun to rise. Thus, despite their protection against
inflation, indexed bonds are not completely riskless. The real
rate can change; and if r* rises, the prices of indexed bonds
will decline. This confirms again that there is no such thing as
a free lunch or a riskless security.

have more interest rate risk the longer the maturity of the bond.10 Therefore,
a maturity risk premium (MRP), which is higher the greater the years to maturity,
is included in the required interest rate.
The effect of maturity risk premiums is to raise interest rates on long-term
bonds relative to those on short-term bonds. This premium, like the others, is
difficult to measure; but (1) it varies somewhat over time, rising when interest
rates are more volatile and uncertain, and then falling when interest rates are more
stable and (2) in recent years, the maturity risk premium on 20-year T-bonds has
generally been in the range of one to two percentage points.11
We should also note that although long-term bonds are heavily exposed to
interest rate risk, short-term bills are heavily exposed to reinvestment rate risk.
When short-term bills mature and the principal must be reinvested, or “rolled
over,” a decline in interest rates would necessitate reinvestment at a lower rate,
which would result in a decline in interest income. To illustrate, suppose you had
$100,000 invested in T-bills and you lived on the income. In 1981, short-term
Treasury rates were about 15%, so your income would have been about $15,000.
However, your income would have declined to about $9,000 by 1983 and to just
$70 by February 2013. Had you invested your money in long-term T-bonds, your
income (but not the value of the principal) would have been stable.12 Thus,
although “investing short” preserves one’s principal, the interest income provided
by short-term T-bills is less stable than that on long-term bonds.
Q U E S T I O N :
An analyst evaluating securities has obtained the following information. The real rate of
interest is 2% and is expected to remain constant for the next 3 years. Inflation is expected
to be 3% next year, 3 5% the following year, and 4% the third year. The maturity risk
premium is estimated to be 0 1
t
1 %, where t = number of years to maturity. The
liquidity premium on relevant 3-year securities is 0 25% and the default risk premium on
relevant 3-year securities is 0 6%.
a. What is the yield on a 1-year T-bill?
b. What is the yield on a 3-year T-bond?
c. What is the yield on a 3-year corporate bond?
10For example, if someone had bought a 20-year Treasury bond for $1,000 in October 1998, when the
long-term interest rate was 5.3%, and sold it in May 2002, when long-term T-bond rates were about
5.8%, the value of the bond would have declined to about $942. That would represent a loss of 5.8%;
and it demonstrates that long-term bonds, even U.S. Treasury bonds, are not riskless. However, had
the investor purchased short-term T-bills in 1998 and subsequently reinvested the principal each time
the bills matured, he or she would still have had the original $1,000. This point is discussed in detail in
Chapter 7.
11The MRP for long-term bonds has averaged 1.5% over the last 87 years. See Ibbotson Stocks, Bonds,
Bills, and Inflation: 2013 Valuation Yearbook (Chicago: Morningstar Inc., 2013).
12Most long-term bonds also have some reinvestment rate risk. If a person is saving and investing for
some future purpose (say, to buy a house or to retire), to actually earn the quoted rate on a long-term
bond, each interest payment must be reinvested at the quoted rate. However, if interest rates fall, the
interest payments would be reinvested at a lower rate; so the realized return would be less than the
quoted rate. Note, though, that reinvestment rate risk is lower on long-term bonds than on short-term
bonds because only the interest payments (rather than interest plus principal) on a long-term bond are
exposed to reinvestment rate risk. Noncallable zero coupon bonds, which are discussed in Chapter 7,
are completely free of reinvestment rate risk during their lifetime.

6-4 THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
The term structure of interest rates describes the relationship between long- and
short-term rates. The term structure is important to corporate treasurers deciding
whether to borrow by issuing long- or short-term debt and to investors who are
deciding whether to buy long- or short-term bonds. Therefore, both borrowers
and lenders should understand (1) how long- and short-term rates relate to each
other and (2) what causes shifts in their relative levels.
Interest rates for bonds with different maturities can be found in a variety of
publications, including The Wall Street Journal and the Federal Reserve Bulletin, and

on a number of websites, including those of Bloomberg, Yahoo!, CNN Financial,
and the Federal Reserve Board. Using interest rate data from these sources, we can
determine the term structure at any given point in time. For example, the table
section of Figure 6.4 presents interest rates for different maturities on three
different dates. The set of data for a given date, when plotted on a graph such
as Figure 6.4, is called the yield curve for that date.
As the figure shows, the yield curve changes in position and in slope over time. In
March 1980, all rates were quite high because high inflation was expected. However,
the rate of inflation was expected to decline; so short-term rates were higher than
long-term rates, and the yield curve was thus downward sloping. By February 2000,
inflation had indeed declined; thus, all rates were lower, and the yield curve had
become humped—intermediate-term rates were higher than either short- or long-term
rates. By February 2013, all rates had fallen below the 2000 levels; and because short-
term rates had dropped below long-term rates, the yield curve was upward sloping.
Figure 6.4 shows yield curves for U.S. Treasury securities; but we could have
constructed curves for bonds issued by GE, IBM, Delta Air Lines, or any other
company that borrows money over a range of maturities. Had we constructed
such corporate yield curves and plotted them on Figure 6.4, they would have been
above those for Treasury securities because corporate yields include default risk

premiums and somewhat higher liquidity premiums. Even so, the corporate yield
curves would have had the same general shape as the Treasury curves. Also, the
riskier the corporation, the higher its yield curve. For example, in February 2013,
Verizon Communications’ bonds with a 10-year maturity were rated A by S&P
and yielded 2 92%, while Royal Bank of Scotland had 10-year bonds outstanding
that were rated BBB−and had a yield of 5 45%. At the same point in time, 10-year
Treasury securities had an interest rate of 2 0%.
Historically, long-term rates are generally above short-term rates because of
the maturity risk premium; so all yield curves usually slope upward. For this
reason, people often call an upward-sloping yield curve a “normal” yield curve
and a yield curve that slopes downward an inverted or “abnormal” yield curve.
Thus, in Figure 6.4, the yield curve for March 1980 was inverted, while the one for
February 2013 was normal. However, the February 2000 curve is humped—a
humped yield curve—which means that interest rates on intermediate-term
maturities were higher than rates on both short- and long-term maturities. We
will explain in detail why an upward slope is the normal situation. Briefly,
however, the reason is that short-term securities have less interest rate risk than
longer-term securities; hence, they have smaller MRPs. So short-term rates are
normally lower than long-term rates.
6-5 WHAT DETERMINES THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE?
Because maturity risk premiums are positive, if other things were held constant,
long-term bonds would always have higher interest rates than short-term bonds.
However, market interest rates also depend on expected inflation, default risk,
and liquidity, each of which can vary with maturity.
Expected inflation has an especially important effect on the yield curve’s
shape, especially the curve for U.S. Treasury securities. Treasuries have essentially
no default or liquidity risk, so the yield on a Treasury bond that matures in t years
can be expressed as follows:
T-bond yield
rt
IPt
MRPt
6.2
While the real risk-free rate, r*, varies somewhat over time because of changes in
the
economy
and
demographics,
these changes
are random
rather
than
predictable. Therefore, the best forecast for the future value of r* is its current
value. However, the inflation premium, IP, varies significantly over time and in a
somewhat predictable manner. Recall that the inflation premium is the average
level of expected inflation over the life of the bond. Thus, if the market expects
inflation to increase in the future (say, from 3% to 4% to 5% over the next 3 years),
the inflation premium will be higher on a 3-year bond than on a 1-year bond. On
the other hand, if the market expects inflation to decline in the future, long-term
bonds will have a smaller inflation premium than will short-term bonds. Finally,
since investors consider long-term bonds to be riskier than short-term bonds

Distinguish among the shapes of a “normal” yield curve, an “abnormal” curve,
and a “humped” curve.
If the interest rates on 1-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year bonds are 4%, 5%, 6%, and 7%,
respectively, how would you describe the yield curve? If the rates were reversed,
how would you describe it?

because of interest rate risk, the maturity risk premium always increases with
maturity.
Figure 6.5 shows two illustrative yield curves—one where inflation is
expected to increase over time and another where inflation is expected to
decrease. Note that these hypothetical interest rates are similar to historical
rates, but they are much higher than current interest rates. Panel a shows the
Treasury yield curve when inflation is expected to increase. Here long-term
bonds have higher yields for two reasons: (1) Inflation is expected to be higher
in the future, and (2) there is a positive maturity risk premium. Panel b shows
the yield curve when inflation is expected to decline. Such a downward-sloping
yield curve often foreshadows an economic downturn because weaker economic
conditions generally lead to declining inflation, which, in turn, results in lower
long-term rates.13
Now let’s consider the yield curve for corporate bonds. Recall that corporate
bonds include a default risk premium (DRP) and a liquidity premium (LP).

13Note that yield curves tend to rise or fall relatively sharply over the first 5 to 10 years and then flatten
out. One reason this occurs is that when forecasting future interest rates, people often predict relatively
high or low inflation for the next few years, after which they assume an average long-run inflation rate.
Consequently, the short end of the yield curve tends to have more curvature and the long end of the
yield curve tends to be more stable.

THE LINKS BETWEEN EXPECTED INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES: A CLOSER LOOK
Throughout the text, we use the following equation to
describe the link between expected inflation and the nom-
inal risk-free rate of interest, rRF:
rRF
r
IP
Recall that r* is the real risk-free interest rate and IP is the
corresponding inflation premium. This equation suggests
that there is a simple link between expected inflation and
nominal interest rates.
It turns out, however, that this link is a bit more complex.
To fully understand this relationship, first recognize that
individuals get utility through the consumption of real
goods and services such as bread, water, haircuts, pizza,
and textbooks. When we save money, we are giving up
the opportunity to consume these goods today in return
for being able to consume more of them in the future. Our
gain from waiting is measured by the real rate of interest, r*.
To illustrate this point, consider the following example.
Assume that a loaf of bread costs $1 today. Also assume that
the real rate of interest is 3% and that inflation is expected
to be 5% over the next year. The 3% real rate indicates that
the average consumer is willing to trade 100 loaves of bread
today for 103 loaves next year. If a “bread bank” were
available, consumers who wanted to defer consumption
until next year could deposit 100 loaves today and withdraw
103 loaves next year. In practice, most of us do not directly
trade real goods such as bread—instead, we purchase these
goods with money because in a well-functioning economy,
it is more efficient to exchange money than goods. How-
ever, when we lend money over time, we worry that bor-
rowers might pay us back with dollars that aren’t worth as
much due to inflation. To compensate for this risk, lenders
build in a premium for expected inflation.
With these concerns in mind, let’s compare the dollar cost
of 100 loaves of bread today to the cost of 103 loaves next
year. Given the current price, 100 loaves of bread today
would cost $100. Because expected inflation is 5%, this
means that a loaf of bread is expected to cost $1.05 next
year. Consequently, 103 loaves of bread are expected to cost
$108.15 next year (103 × $1.05). So if consumers were to
deposit $100 in a bank today, they would need to earn
8.15% to realize a real return of 3%.
Putting this all together, we see that the 1-year nominal
interest rate can be calculated as follows:
rRF
1
r
1
IP
1
1 03 1 05
1
0 0815
8 15%
Note that this expression can be rewritten as follows:
rRF
r
IP
r
IP
That equation is identical to our original expression for the
nominal risk-free rate except that it includes a “cross-term,”
r* × IP. When real interest rates and expected inflation are
relatively low, the cross-term turns out to be quite small and
thus is often ignored. Because it is normally insignificant we
disregard the cross-term in the text unless stated otherwise.
(When working problems, we will tell you when to include
the cross-term; otherwise, ignore this term when solving
problems.)
One last point—you should recognize that while it may
be reasonable to ignore the cross-term when interest rates
are low (as they are in the United States today), it is a
mistake to do so when investing in a market where interest
rates and inflation are quite high, as is often the case in
many emerging markets. In these markets, the cross-term
can be significant and thus should not be disregarded.

can be attributed to default risk.14 Corporate bonds’ default and liquidity risks are
affected by their maturities. For example, the default risk on Coca-Cola’s short-
term debt is very small because there is almost no chance that Coca-Cola will go
bankrupt over the next few years. However, Coke has some bonds that have a
maturity of almost 100 years; and while the odds of Coke defaulting on those
bonds might not be very high, there is still a higher probability of default risk on
Coke’s long-term bonds than on its short-term bonds.
Longer-term corporate bonds also tend to be less liquid than shorter-term
bonds. Because short-term debt has less default risk, someone can buy a short-
term bond without doing as much credit checking as would be necessary for
a long-term bond. Thus, people can move in and out of short-term corporate debt
relatively rapidly. As a result, a corporation’s short-term bonds are typically more
liquid and thus have lower liquidity premiums than its long-term bonds.
Figure 6.6 shows yield curves for two hypothetical corporate bonds—an
AA-rated bond with minimal default risk and a BBB-rated bond with more
default risk—along with the yield curve for Treasury securities taken from Panel
a of Figure 6.5. Here we assume that inflation is expected to increase, so the

Treasury yield curve is upward-sloping. Because of their additional default and
liquidity risk, corporate bonds yield more than Treasury bonds with the same
maturity and BBB-rated bonds yield more than AA-rated bonds. Finally, note
that the yield spread between corporate and Treasury bonds is larger the longer
the maturity. This occurs because longer-term corporate bonds have more
default and liquidity risk than shorter-term bonds, and both of these premiums
are absent in Treasury bonds.
6-6 USING THE YIELD CURVE TO ESTIMATE FUTURE
INTEREST RATES15
In the last section, we saw that the slope of the yield curve depends primarily on
two factors: (1) expectations about future inflation and (2) effects of maturity on
bonds’ risk. We also saw how to calculate the yield curve, given inflation and
maturity-related risks. Note, though, that people can reverse the process: They
can look at the yield curve and use information embedded in it to estimate the
market’s expectations regarding future inflation, risk, and short-term interest
rates. For example, suppose a company is in the midst of a 5-year expansion
program and the treasurer knows that she will need to borrow short-term funds
a year from now. She knows the current cost of 1-year money, read from the
yield curve, but she wants to know the cost of 1-year money next year. That
information can be “backed out” by analyzing the current yield curve, as will be
discussed.
The estimation process is straightforward provided we (1) focus on Treasury
bonds and (2) assume that Treasury bonds contain no maturity risk premiums.16
This position has been called the pure expectations theory of the term structure of
S E L F T E S T
How do maturity risk premiums affect the yield curve?
If the inflation rate is expected to increase, would this increase or decrease the
slope of the yield curve?
If the inflation rate is expected to remain constant at the current level in the
future, would the yield curve slope up, slope down, or be horizontal? Consider all
factors that affect the yield curve, not just inflation.
Explain why corporate bonds’ default and liquidity premiums are likely to
increase with their maturity.
Explain why corporate bonds always yield more than Treasury bonds and why
BBB-rated bonds always yield more than AA-rated bonds.
15This section is relatively technical, but instructors can omit it without loss of continuity.
16Although most evidence suggests that there is a positive maturity risk premium, some academics and
practitioners contend that this second assumption is reasonable, at least as an approximation. They
argue that the market is dominated by large bond traders who buy and sell securities of different
maturities each day, that these traders focus only on short-term returns, and that they are
not concerned with maturity risk. According to this view, a bond trader is just as willing to buy a
20-year bond to pick up a short-term profit as he or she is to buy a 3-month security. Proponents of this
view argue that the shape of the Treasury yield curve is therefore determined only by market
expectations about future interest rates. Later in this section we show what happens when we
include the effects of maturity risk premiums.

the shape of the yield
curve depends on
investors’ expectations

interest rates, often simply referred to as the “expectations theory.” The expecta-
tions theory assumes that bond traders establish bond prices and interest rates
strictly on the basis of expectations for future interest rates and that they are
indifferent to maturity because they do not view long-term bonds as being riskier
than short-term bonds. If this were true, the maturity risk premium (MRP) would
be zero and long-term interest rates would simply be a weighted average of
current and expected future short-term interest rates.
To illustrate the pure expectations theory, assume that a 1-year Treasury bond
currently yields 5 00% while a 2-year bond yields 5 50%. Investors who want to
invest for a 2-year horizon have two primary options:
Option 1: Buy a two-year security and hold it for 2 years.
Option 2: Buy a 1-year security; hold it for 1 year; and then at the end of the year,
reinvest the proceeds in another 1-year security.
If they select Option 1, for every dollar they invest today, they will have accumu-
lated $1 113025 by the end of Year 2:
Funds at end of Year 2
$1
1 055 2
$1 113025
If they select Option 2, they should end up with the same amount; but this equation
is used to find the ending amount:

$1
1 05

X
Here X is the expected interest rate on a 1-year Treasury security 1 year from now.
If the expectations theory is correct, each option must provide the same
amount of cash at the end of 2 years, which implies the following:
1 05 1
X
1 055 2
We can rearrange this equation and then solve for X:

X
1 055
2 1 05
1 055
2 1 05

0 0600238
6 00238%
Therefore, X, the 1-year rate 1 year from today, must be 6 00238%; otherwise, one
option will be better than the other and the market will not be in equilibrium.
However, if the market is not in equilibrium, buying and selling will quickly bring
about equilibrium. For example, suppose investors expect the 1-year Treasury rate
to be 6 00238% a year from now but a 2-year bond now yields 5 25%, not the
5 50% rate required for equilibrium. Bond traders could earn a profit by adopting
the following strategy:
1.
Borrow money for 2 years at the 2-year rate, 5 25% per year.
2.
Invest the money in a series of 1-year securities, expecting to earn 5 00% this
year and 6 00238% next year, for an overall expected return over the 2 years of
1 05

5 50%.
Borrowing at 5 25% and investing to earn 5 50% is a good deal, so bond traders
would rush to borrow money (demand funds) in the 2-year market and invest (or
supply funds) in the 1-year market.
Recall from Figure 6.1 that a decline in the supply of funds raises interest
rates, while an increase in the supply lowers rates. Likewise, an increase in the
demand for funds raises rates, while a decline in demand lowers rates. Therefore,
bond traders would push up the 2-year yield and simultaneously lower the yield

on 1-year bonds. This buying and selling would cease when the 2-year rate
becomes a weighted average of expected future 1-year rates.17
Let’s suppose that the yield curve looks as follows:
1-year T-bond: 5 00%
2-year T-bond: 5 50%
4-year T-bond: 6 25%
An investor would like to purchase a 1-year T-bond today and then to invest in a
3-year T-bond one year from now. What yield would this investor expect to earn
on the 3-year T-bond one year from now? You have enough information from the
yield curve above to determine the expected yield on the 3-year T-bond one year
from today. Here’s the equation setup:

6 67%
The investor would expect to earn one year from today a yield of 6 67% for three
years on the 3-year T-bond. Note that the investor would expect to earn the same
yield investing in a 4-year T-bond today as he would investing in a 1-year T-bond
today and then investing in a 3-year T-bond one year from now.
The preceding analysis was based on the assumption that the maturity risk
premium is zero. However, most evidence suggests that a positive maturity
risk premium exists. For example, assume once again that 1- and 2-year matu-
rities yield 5 00% and 5 50%, respectively; so we have a rising yield curve.
However, now assume that the maturity risk premium on the 2-year bond
is 0 20% versus zero for the 1-year bond. This premium means that in equili-
brium, the expected annual return on a 2-year bond (5 50%) must be 0 20%
higher than the expected return on a series of two 1-year bonds (5 00% and X%).
Therefore, the expected return on the series must be 5 50%

Now recall that the annual expected return from the series of two 1-year bonds
can be expressed as follows, where X is the 1-year rate next year:

5 60086%
Under these conditions, equilibrium requires that market participants expect the
1-year rate next year to be 5 60086%.
Note that the rate read from the yield curve rises by 0 50% when the years to
maturity increase from one to two: 5 50%
5 00%
0 50%. Of this 0 50% increase,
0 20% is attributable to the MRP and the remaining 0 30% is due to the increase in
expected 1-year rates next year.
To eliminate the exponent,
each side of the equation is
raised to the 1/3 power.
17In our calculations, we used the geometric average of the current and expected 1-year rates: [ 1.05 ×
1.0600238]1/2 −1 = 0.055 or 5.50%. The arithmetic average of the two rates is (5% + 6.00238%)/2 =
5.50119%. The geometric average is theoretically correct, but the difference is only 0.00119%. With
interest rates at the levels they have been in the United States and most other nations in recent years,
the geometric and arithmetic averages are so close that many people use the arithmetic average,
especially given the other assumptions that underlie the estimation of future 1-year rates.

Putting all of this together, we see that one can use the yield curve to estimate
what the market expects the short-term rate to be next year. However, this requires
an estimate of the maturity risk premium; and if our estimated MRP is incorrect,
then so will our yield-curve-based interest rate forecast. Thus, while the yield curve
can be used to obtain insights into what the market thinks future interest rates will
be, the calculations above (although they appear to be precise) will only approx-
imate these expectations unless the pure expectations theory holds or we know with
certainty the exact maturity risk premium. Because neither of these conditions
holds, it is difficult to know for sure what the market is forecasting.
Note too that even if we could determine the market’s consensus forecast for
future rates, the market is not always right. So a forecast of next year’s rate based
on the yield curve could be wrong. Therefore, obtaining an accurate forecast of
rates for next year—or even for next month—is extremely difficult.
6-7 MACROECONOMIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE INTEREST
RATE LEVELS
We described how key components such as expected inflation, default risk, matu-
rity risk, and liquidity concerns influence the level of interest rates over time and
across different markets. On a day-to-day basis, a variety of macro-economic factors
may influence one or more of these components; hence, macroeconomic factors
have an important effect on both the general level of interest rates and the shape of
the yield curve. The primary factors are (1) Federal Reserve policy; (2) the federal
budget deficit or surplus; (3) international factors, including the foreign trade
balance and interest rates in other countries; and (4) the level of business activity.
6-7A FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY
As you probably learned in your economics courses, (1) the money supply has a
significant effect on the level of economic activity, inflation, and interest rates, and
(2) in the United States, the Federal Reserve Board controls the money supply.
If the Fed wants to stimulate the economy, it increases the money supply. The
Fed buys and sells short-term securities, so the initial effect of a monetary
easing would be to cause short-term rates to decline. However, a larger money
supply might lead to an increase in expected future inflation, which would cause
S E L F T E S T
What key assumption underlies the pure expectations theory?
Assuming that the pure expectations theory is correct, how are expected short-
term rates used to calculate expected long-term rates?
According to the pure expectations theory, what would happen if long-term
rates were not an average of expected short-term rates?
Most evidence suggests that a positive maturity risk premium exists. How would
this affect your calculations when determining interest rates?
Assume that the interest rate on a 1-year T-bond is currently 7% and the rate on
a 2-year bond is 9%. If the maturity risk premium is zero, what is a reasonable
forecast of the rate on a 1-year bond next year? What would the forecast be if
the maturity risk premium on the 2-year bond was 0.5% versus zero for the
1-year bond? (11.04%; 10.02%)

long-term rates to rise even as short-term rates fell. The reverse holds if the Fed
tightens the money supply. The Fed’s job is to promote economic growth while
keeping inflation at bay. This is a delicate balancing act.
As you can see from Figure 6.2, interest rates in recent years have been
relatively low, with short-term rates especially low during the last 4 years shown
(January 2009 through February 2013). Economists anticipate that rates will
remain low for the foreseeable future; however, some worry that the Fed might
be increasing the risk of inflation down the road.
During the last several years, the Fed has been trying to increase business
investment to generate growth in our economy. In addition to lower interest rates,
the Fed through its program of “Quantitative Easing” has pumped trillions of
dollars into the economy by purchasing mortgage-backed securities and long-term
Treasury securities and through special lending programs. As we write this, the Fed
is still purchasing mortgage-backed securities. The Fed’s third quantitative easing
program was announced in September 2012—and it is open ended. The Fed has
stated that it will purchase $40 billion dollars of mortgage-backed securities per
month until there is substantial improvement in the labor market. 2012 was the best
year for the housing industry since the 2008 financial crisis due to record lows in
mortgage rates. Job growth has been steady, although the unemployment rate is at
7 9%. However, there is concern that once the Fed stops purchasing mortgage-
backed securities mortgage rates will rise. If the Fed anticipates inflation returning,
it could be forced to raise rates or to reduce the money supply.
Actions that lower short-term rates won’t necessarily lower long-term rates.
Lower rates could cause foreigners to sell their holdings of U.S. bonds. These
investors would be paid with dollars, which they would then sell to buy their own
currencies. The sale of dollars and the purchase of other currencies would lower
the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, which would make U.S. goods
less expensive, which would help manufacturers and thus lower the trade deficit.
Note also that during periods when the Fed is actively intervening in the markets,
the yield curve may be temporarily distorted. Short-term rates may be driven
below the long-run equilibrium level if the Fed is easing credit and above the
equilibrium rate if the Fed is tightening credit. Long-term rates are not affected as
much by Fed intervention.
6-7B FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICITS OR SURPLUSES
If the federal government spends more than it takes in as taxes, it runs a deficit; and
that deficit must be covered by additional borrowing (selling more Treasury bonds)
or by printing money. If the government borrows, this increases the demand for
funds and thus pushes up interest rates. If the government prints money, investors
recognize that with “more money chasing a given amount of goods,” the result will
be increased inflation, which will also increase interest rates. So the larger the
federal deficit, other things held constant, the higher the level of interest rates.
Over the past several decades, the federal government has generally run large
budget deficits. There were some surpluses in the late 1990s; but the September 11,
2001, terrorist attacks, the subsequent recession, and the Iraq war all boosted
government spending and caused the deficits to return.
6-7C INTERNATIONAL FACTORS
Businesses and individuals in the United States buy from and sell to people and
firms all around the globe. If they buy more than they sell (that is, if there are more
imports than exports), they are said to be running a foreign trade deficit. When
trade deficits occur, they must be financed, and this generally means borrowing
from nations with export surpluses. Thus, if the United States imported
$200 billion of goods but exported only $100 billion, it would run a trade deficit
of $100 billion while other countries would have a $100 billion trade surplus.

when a country imports
more than it exports.

The United States would probably borrow the $100 billion from the surplus
nations.18 At any rate, the larger the trade deficit, the higher the tendency to
borrow. Note that foreigners will hold U.S. debt if and only if the rates on U.S.
securities are competitive with rates in other countries. This causes U.S. interest
rates to be highly dependent on rates in other parts of the world.
All this interdependency limits the ability of the Federal Reserve to use mone-
tary policy to control economic activity in the United States. For example, if the Fed
attempts to lower U.S. interest rates and this causes rates to fall below rates abroad,
foreigners will begin selling U.S. bonds. Those sales will depress bond prices, which
will push up rates in the United States. Thus, the large U.S. trade deficit (and
foreigners’ holdings of U.S. debt that resulted from many years of deficits) hinders
the Fed’s ability to combat a recession by lowering interest rates.
For about 25 years following World War II, the United States ran large trade
surpluses and the rest of the world owed it many billions of dollars. However, the
situation changed, and the United States has been running trade deficits since the
mid-1970s. (The U.S. annual 2012 international trade deficit for goods and services
was $540 4 billion.) The cumulative effect of these deficits has been to change the
United States from being the largest creditor nation to being the largest debtor nation
of all time. As a result, interest rates are very much influenced by interest rates in
other countries—higher or lower rates abroad lead to higher or lower U.S. rates.
Because of all of this, U.S. corporate treasurers and everyone else who is affected by
interest rates should keep up with developments in the world economy.
6-7D BUSINESS ACTIVITY
You can examine Figure 6.2 to see how business conditions influence interest rates.
Here are the key points revealed by the graph:
1.
Because inflation increased from 1972 to 1981, the general tendency during
that period was toward higher interest rates. However, since the 1981 peak,
the trend has generally been downward.
2.
The shaded areas in the graph represent recessions, during which (a) the
demand for money and the rate of inflation tended to fall and (b) the Federal
Reserve tended to increase the money supply in an effort to stimulate the
economy. As a result, there is a tendency for interest rates to decline during
recessions. For example, the economy began to slow down in 2000, and the
country entered a mild recession in 2001. In response, the Federal Reserve cut
interest rates. In 2004, the economy began to rebound; so the Fed began to
raise rates. However, the subprime debacle hit in 2007; so the Fed began
lowering rates in September 2007. By February 2008, the Fed’s target rate had
fallen from 5 25% to 3 00%. In February 2013, the Federal Reserve target rate
ranged from 0% to 0 25%.
3.
During recessions, short-term rates decline more sharply than long-term rates.
This occurs for two reasons: (a) The Fed operates mainly in the short-term
sector, so its intervention has the strongest effect there, (b) Long-term rates
reflect the average expected inflation rate over the next 20 to 30 years; and this
expectation generally does not change much, even when the current inflation
rate is low because of a recession or high because of a boom. So short-term rates
are more volatile than long-term rates. Taking another look at Figure 6.2, we see
that short-term rates did decline recently by much more than long-term rates.
18The deficit could also be financed by selling assets, including gold, corporate stocks, entire
companies, and real estate. The United States has financed its massive trade deficits by all of these
means in recent years. Although the primary method has been by borrowing from foreigners, in recent
years, there has been a sharp increase in foreign purchases of U.S. assets, especially oil exporters’
purchases of U.S. businesses.

6-8 INTEREST RATES AND BUSINESS DECISIONS
As you might expect, companies look carefully at the level of interest rates and the
shape of the yield curve when making important business decisions. For example,
assume that Leading Edge Co. is considering building a new plant with a 30-year
life that will cost $1 million and it plans to raise the $1 million by borrowing rather
than by issuing new stock. At the time of its decision in April 2013, the company
faces an upward sloping yield curve. If it borrows on a short-term basis from a
bank—say for 1 year—its annual interest cost would be only 1 0%, or $10,000. On
the other hand, if it issued long-term bonds, then its annual cost would be 4 0%, or
$40,000. Therefore, at first glance, it would seem that Leading Edge should use
short-term debt.
However, this could prove to be a horrible mistake. If it used short-term debt,
it will have to renew its loan every year; and the rate charged on each new loan
will reflect the then-current short-term rate. Interest rates could dramatically
increase in which case the company’s interest payments would soar over time.
Those high interest payments would cut into and perhaps eliminate its profits.
Even more concerning, if at some point in time, the company’s lenders refused to
renew the loan and demanded its repayment, as they would have every right to
do, Leading Edge might have to sell assets at a loss, which could result in bank-
ruptcy. On the other hand, if the company used long-term financing in 2013, its
interest costs would remain constant at $40,000 per year; so it would not be
directly hurt if interest rates in the economy increased over time.
Does all of this suggest that firms should avoid short-term debt? Not at all. If
inflation falls over the next few years, so will interest rates. If Leading Edge had
borrowed on a long-term basis in April 2013, it would be at a disadvantage if it
was locked into 4 0% debt while its competitors (who used short-term debt in
2013) had a borrowing cost of only 1 0%.
Financing decisions would be easy if we could make accurate forecasts
of future interest rates. Unfortunately, predicting interest rates with consistent
accuracy is nearly impossible. However, although it is difficult to predict future
interest rate levels, it is easy to predict that interest rates will fluctuate—they
always have, and they always will. That being the case, sound financial policy
calls for using a mix of long- and short-term debt as well as equity to position
the firm so that it can survive in any interest rate environment. Further, the
optimal financial policy depends in an important way on the nature of the
firm’s assets—the easier it is to sell assets to generate cash, the more feasible
it is to use more short-term debt. This makes it logical for a firm to finance
current assets such as inventories and receivables with short-term debt and to
finance fixed assets such as buildings and equipment with long-term debt. We
will return to this issue later in the book when we discuss capital structure and
financing policy.
Changes in interest rates also have implications for savers. For example, if
you had a 401(k) plan—and someday most of you will—you would probably

want to invest some of your money in a bond mutual fund. You could choose a
fund that had an average maturity of 25 years, 20 years, or on down to only a
few months (a money market fund). How would your choice affect your invest-
ment results and hence your retirement income? First, your decision would affect
your annual interest income. For example, if the yield curve was upward-
sloping, as it normally is, you would earn more interest if you chose a fund that
held long-term bonds. Note, though, that if you chose a long-term fund and
interest rates then rose, the market value of your fund would decline. For
example, as we will see in Chapter 7, if you had $100,000 in a fund whose
average bond had a maturity of 25 years and a coupon rate of 6% and if interest
rates then rose from 6% to 10%, the market value of your fund would decline
from $100,000 to about $63,500. On the other hand, if rates declined, your fund
would increase in value. If you invested in a short-term fund, its value would be
more stable, but it would probably provide less interest per year. In any event,
your choice of maturity would have a major effect on your investment perfor-
mance and, therefore, on your future income.
In this chapter, we discussed the way interest rates are determined, the term
structure of interest rates, and some of the ways interest rates affect business
decisions. We saw that the interest rate on a given bond, r, is based on this
equation:
r
r
IP
DRP
LP
MRP
Here r* is the real risk-free rate, IP is the premium for expected inflation, DRP is
the premium for potential default risk, LP is the premium for lack of liquidity, and
MRP is the premium to compensate for the risk inherent in bonds with long
maturities. Both r* and the various premiums can and do change over time
depending on economic conditions, Federal Reserve actions, and the like. Because
changes in these factors are difficult to predict, it is hard to forecast the future
direction of interest rates.
The yield curve, which relates bonds’ interest rates to their maturities, usually
has an upward slope; but it can slope up or down, and both its slope and level
change over time. The main determinants of the slope of the curve are expecta-
tions for future inflation and the MRP. We can analyze yield curve data to estimate
what market participants think future interest rates are likely to be. We will use the
insights gained from this chapter in later chapters when we analyze the values of
bonds and stocks and when we examine various corporate investment and finan-
cing decisions.

loan industry, (2) virtually forced the industry to make long-term fixed-interest-rate mort-
gages, and (3) forced the savings and loans to obtain most of their capital as deposits that
were withdrawable on demand.

Would the savings and loans have higher profits in a world with a “normal” or an
inverted yield curve? Explain your answer.
b.
Would the savings and loan industry be better off if the individual institutions sold
their mortgages to federal agencies and then collected servicing fees or if the
institutions held the mortgages that they originated?

REAL RISK-FREE RATE
You read in The Wall Street Journal that 30-day T-bills are currently
yielding 5 5%. Your brother-in-law, a broker at Safe and Sound Securities, has given you
the following estimates of current interest rate premiums:
•
Inflation premium= 3 25%

•
Default risk premium = 2 15%
On the basis of these data, what is the real risk-free rate of return?

INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES
In late 1980, the U.S. Commerce Department released
new data showing inflation was 15%. At the time, the prime rate of interest was 21%, a
record high. However, many investors expected the new Reagan administration to be more
effective in controlling inflation than the Carter administration had been. Moreover, many
observers believed that the extremely high interest rates and generally tight credit, which
resulted from the Federal Reserve System’s attempts to curb the inflation rate, would lead
to a recession, which, in turn, would lead to a decline in inflation and interest rates. Assume
that, at the beginning of 1981, the expected inflation rate for 1981 was 13%; for 1982, 9%; for
1983, 7%; and for 1984 and thereafter, 6%.

a. What effect would each of the following events likely have on the level of nominal
interest rates?
1. Households dramatically increase their savings rate.
2. Corporations increase their demand for funds following an increase in investment
opportunities.
3. The government runs a larger-than-expected budget deficit.
4. There is an increase in expected inflation.

INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION
Maria Juarez is a professional tennis player, and your firm manages her
money. She has asked you to give her information about what determines the level of various interest rates.
Your boss has prepared some questions for you to consider.
a. What are the four most fundamental factors that affect the cost of money, or the general level of interest rates,
in the economy?
b. What is the real risk-free rate of interest (r*) and the nominal risk-free rate (rRF)? How are these two rates
measured?
c. Define the terms inflation premium (IP), default risk premium (DRP), liquidity premium (LP), and maturity risk
premium (MRP). Which of these premiums is included in determining the interest rate on (1) short-term U.S.
Treasury securities, (2) long-term U.S. Treasury securities, (3) short-term corporate securities, and (4) long-
term corporate securities? Explain how the premiums would vary over time and among the different
securities listed.
d. What is the term structure of interest rates? What is a yield curve?
e. Suppose most investors expect the inflation rate to be 5% next year, 6% the following year, and 8% thereafter.
The real risk-free rate is 3%. The maturity risk premium is zero for bonds that mature in 1 year or less and
0 1% for 2-year bonds; then the MRP increases by 0 1% per year thereafter for 20 years, after which it is
stable. What is the interest rate on 1-, 10-, and 20-year Treasury bonds? Draw a yield curve with these data.
What factors can explain why this constructed yield curve is upward-sloping?
f. At any given time, how would the yield curve facing a AAA-rated company compare with the yield curve
for U.S. Treasury securities? At any given time, how would the yield curve facing a BB-rated company
compare with the yield curve for U.S. Treasury securities? Draw a graph to illustrate your answer.
g. What is the pure expectations theory? What does the pure expectations theory imply about the term
structure of interest rates?
h. Suppose you observe the following term structure for Treasury securities:
Maturity
Yield
1 year
6.0%
2 years
6.2
3 years
6.4
4 years
6.5
5 years
6.5
Assume that the pure expectations theory of the term structure is correct. (This implies that you can use the
yield curve provided to “back out” the market’s expectations about future interest rates.) What does the
market expect will be the interest rate on 1-year securities 1 year from now? What does the market expect
will be the interest rate on 3-year securities 2 years from now? Calculate these yields using geometric
averages.
i. Describe how macroeconomic factors affect the level of interest rates. How do these factors explain why
interest rates have been lower in recent years?

Sizing Up Risk in the Bond Market
Many people view Treasury securities as a
lackluster but ultrasafe investment. From a
default standpoint, Treasuries are indeed our
safest investments; but their prices can still
decline in any given year if interest rates increase.
This is especially true for long-term Treasury
bonds, which lost nearly 15% in 2009. However,
bonds can also perform well—Treasury bonds
earned a return of nearly 26% in 2008, and they
out-gained stocks in 7 of the 13 years between
2000 and 2012.
Not all bonds are alike, and they don’t
always move in the same direction. For example,
corporate bonds are often callable and issuers
can default on them, whereas Treasury bonds
are not exposed to these risks. To compensate
investors for these additional risks, corporate
bonds typically have higher yields. When the
economy is strong, corporate bonds generally
produce higher returns than Treasuries because
their promised returns are higher, and most
make their promised payments because few go
into default. However, when the economy weak-
ens, concerns about defaults rise, which leads to
declines in corporate bond prices. Furthermore,
at any point in time, there are widespread differ-
ences among corporate bonds. For example, in
February 2013, bonds issued by American Home
Products Corporation with an AA credit rating
maturing in 2023 were trading at a yield to
maturity of 3.01%. At the same point in time,
bonds issued by Brunswick Corporation with a
BB−credit rating maturing in 2023 were trading
at a yield to maturity of 6.47%.
A 2009 article in The Wall Street Journal
highlighted the concerns that bond investors
face in today’s environment. The article offers
what it refers to as “five key pointers”:

1.
Watch Out for Defaults. Investors should be wary of low-
rated corporate bonds on the edge of default. The
article cautions investors about increased default risk in
the municipal market as state and local governments
struggle to balance their budgets.
2.
Limit Your Rate Risk. Rates are likely to increase over time
as the economy hopefully continues to recover. As we see
in this chapter, increasing interest rates reduce the value of
bonds, and this effect is particularly important for investors
of long-term bonds. For this reason, The Wall Street Journal
writer suggests that some bond investors may want to
gradually shift away from longer-maturity bonds.
3.
Consider a Passive Strategy. This advice is directed
specifically to investors in bond mutual funds. Rather
than investing in actively managed funds where the
portfolio manager is constantly moving in and out of
different bonds, the author suggests that investors
invest in index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
that track a broad index of bonds.
4.
Have an Inflation Hedge. Many analysts worry that down
the road, higher government spending and a relaxed
monetary policy will ultimately lead to higher levels of
inflation. As we will see in this chapter, one way to
hedge against rising inflation is to invest in Treasury
securities that are indexed to inflation.
5.
Don’t Try to Time the Market. As we have seen in recent
years, bond prices can move quickly and dramatically,
which makes it difficult to effectively bet on where the
market is heading next. Rather than trying to time the next
move in the market, the article urges investors to adopt a
more steady long-term strategy when it comes to bonds.
While these pointers are relevant in today’s market, in
many ways the advice is timeless. In the face of similar risks in
2001, a BusinessWeek Online article gave investors the follow-
ing similar advice, which is still applicable today:
Take the same diversified approach to bonds as you do with
stocks. Blend in U.S. government, corporate—both high-
quality and high-yield—and perhaps even some foreign
government debt. If you’re investing taxable dollars, consider
tax-exempt municipal bonds. And it doesn’t hurt to layer in
some inflation-indexed bonds.

In previous chapters, we noted that companies raise capital in two main forms:
debt and equity. In this chapter, we examine the characteristics of bonds and
discuss the various factors that influence bond prices. In Chapter 9, we will turn
our attention to stocks and their valuation.
If you skim through The Wall Street Journal, you will see references to a wide
variety of bonds. This variety may seem confusing; but in actuality, only a few
characteristics distinguish the various types of bonds.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Identify the different features of corporate and government bonds.
•
Discuss how bond prices are determined in the market, what the relationship is
between interest rates and bond prices, and how a bond’s price changes over
time as it approaches maturity.
•
Calculate a bond’s yield to maturity and yield to call if it is callable, and
determine the “true” yield.
•
Explain the different types of risk that bond investors and issuers face, and discuss
how a bond’s terms and collateral can be changed to affect its interest rate.

7-1 WHO ISSUES BONDS?
A bond is a long-term contract under which a borrower agrees to make payments
of interest and principal on specific dates to the holders of the bond. Bonds are
issued by corporations and government agencies that are looking for long-term
debt capital. For example, on January 3, 2014, Allied Food Products borrowed
$170 million by issuing $170 million of bonds. For convenience, we assume that
Allied sold 170,000 individual bonds for $1,000 each. Actually, it could have sold
one $170 million bond, 17 bonds each with a $10 million face value, or any other
combination that totaled $170 million. In any event, Allied received the
$170 million; and in exchange, it promised to make annual interest payments
and to repay the $170 million on a specified maturity date.
Until the 1970s, most bonds were beautifully engraved pieces of paper and
their key terms, including their face values, were spelled out on the bonds. Today,
though, virtually all bonds are represented by electronic data stored in secure
computers, much like the “money” in a bank checking account.
Bonds are grouped in several ways. One grouping is based on the issuer: the
U.S. Treasury, corporations, state and local governments, and foreigners. Each
bond differs with respect to risk and consequently its expected return.
Treasury bonds, generally called Treasuries and sometimes referred to as
government bonds, are issued by the federal government.1 It is reasonable to
assume that the U.S. government will make good on its promised payments, so
Treasuries have no default risk. However, these bonds’ prices do decline when
interest rates rise; so they are not completely riskless.
Corporate bonds are issued by business firms. Unlike Treasuries, corporates
are exposed to default risk—if the issuing company gets into trouble, it may be
unable to make the promised interest and principal payments and bondholders
may suffer losses. Corporate bonds have different levels of default risk depending
on the issuing company’s characteristics and the terms of the specific bond.
Default risk is often referred to as “credit risk”; and as we saw in Chapter 6, the
larger this risk, the higher the interest rate investors demand.
Municipal bonds, or munis, is the term given to bonds issued by state and
local governments. Like corporates, munis are exposed to some default risk; but
they have one major advantage over all other bonds: As we discussed in Chapter
3, the interest earned on most munis is exempt from federal taxes and from state
taxes if the holder is a resident of the issuing state. Consequently, the market
interest rate on a muni is considerably lower than on a corporate bond of equiva-
lent risk.
Foreign bonds are issued by a foreign government or a foreign corporation.
All foreign corporate bonds are exposed to default risk, as are some foreign
government bonds. Indeed in recent months, concerns have risen about possible
defaults in many countries including Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. An
additional risk exists when the bonds are denominated in a currency other than
that of the investor’s home currency. Consider, for example, a U.S. investor who
purchases a corporate bond denominated in Japanese yen. At some point, the
investor will want to close out his investment and convert the yen back to U.S.
dollars. If the Japanese yen unexpectedly falls relative to the dollar, the investor
will have fewer dollars than he originally expected to receive. Consequently, the
investor could still lose money even if the bond does not default.
1The U.S. Treasury actually calls its debt “bills,” “notes,” or “bonds.” T-bills generally have maturities
of 1 year or less at the time of issue, notes generally have original maturities of 2 to 7 years, and bonds
originally mature in 8 to 30 years. There are technical differences between bills, notes, and bonds; but
they are not important for our purposes. So we generally call all Treasury securities “bonds.” Note too
that a 30-year T-bond at the time of issue becomes a 29-year bond the next year, and it is a 1-year bond
after 29 years.

7-2 KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF BONDS
Although all bonds have some common characteristics, different types of bonds
can have different contractual features. For example, most corporate bonds have
provisions that allow the issuer to pay them off early (“call” features), but the
specific call provisions vary widely among different bonds. Similarly, some bonds
are backed by specific assets that must be turned over to the bondholders if the
issuer defaults, while other bonds have no such collateral backup. Differences in
contractual provisions (and in the fundamental underlying financial strength of
the companies backing the bonds) lead to differences in bonds’ risks, prices, and
expected returns. To understand bonds, it is essential that you understand the
following terms.
7-2A PAR VALUE
The par value is the stated face value of the bond; for illustrative purposes, we
generally assume a par value of $1,000, although any multiple of $1,000 (e.g.,
$10,000 or $10 million) can be used. The par value generally represents the amount
of money the firm borrows and promises to repay on the maturity date.
7-2B COUPON INTEREST RATE
Allied Food Products’ bonds require the company to pay a fixed number of
dollars of interest each year. This payment, generally referred to as the coupon
payment, is set at the time the bond is issued and remains in force during the
bond’s life.2 Typically, at the time a bond is issued, its coupon payment is set at
a level that will induce investors to buy the bond at or near its par value. Most of
the examples and problems throughout this text will focus on bonds with fixed
coupon rates.
When this annual coupon payment is divided by the par value, the result is
the coupon interest rate. For example, Allied’s bonds have a $1,000 par value, and
they pay $100 in interest each year. The bond’s coupon payment is $100, so its
coupon interest rate is $100 $1,000
10%. In this regard, the $100 is the annual
income that an investor receives when he or she invests in the bond.

2Back when bonds were engraved pieces of paper rather than electronic information stored on a
computer, each bond had a number of small (1/2- by 2-inch) dated coupons attached to them. On
each interest payment date, the owner would “clip the coupon” for that date, send it to the company’s
paying agent, and receive a check for the interest. A 30-year semiannual bond would start with
60 coupons, whereas a 5-year annual payment bond would start with only 5 coupons. Today no
physical coupons are involved, and interest checks are mailed or deposited automatically to the bonds’
registered owners on the payment date. Even so, people continue to use the terms coupon and coupon
interest rate when discussing bonds. You can think of the coupon interest rate as the promised rate.

Allied’s bonds are fixed-rate bonds because the coupon rate is fixed for the
life of the bond. In some cases, however, a bond’s coupon payment is allowed
to vary over time. These floating-rate bonds work as follows: The coupon rate is
set for an initial period, often 6 months, after which it is adjusted every 6 months
based on some open market rate. For example, the bond’s rate may be adjusted so
as to equal the 10-year Treasury bond rate plus a “spread” of 1 5 percentage
points. Other provisions can be included in corporate bonds. For example, some
can be converted at the holders’ option into fixed-rate debt, and some floaters
have upper limits (caps) and lower limits (floors) on how high or low the rate
can go.
Some bonds pay no coupons at all but are offered at a discount below their
par values and hence provide capital appreciation rather than interest income.
These securities are called zero coupon bonds (zeros). Other bonds pay some
coupon interest, but not enough to induce investors to buy them at par. In
general, any bond originally offered at a price significantly below its par value
is called an original issue discount (OID) bond. Some of the details associated
with issuing or investing in zero coupon bonds are discussed more fully in Web
Appendix 7A.
7-2C MATURITY DATE
Bonds generally have a specified maturity date on which the par value must be
repaid. Allied’s bonds, which were issued on January 3, 2014, will mature on
January 2, 2029; thus, they had a 15-year maturity at the time they were issued.
Most bonds have original maturities (the maturity at the time the bond is issued)
ranging from 10 to 40 years, but any maturity is legally permissible.3 Of course,
the effective maturity of a bond declines each year after it has been issued. Thus,
Allied’s bonds had a 15-year original maturity. But in 2015, a year later, they will
have a 14-year maturity; a year after that, they will have a 13-year maturity;
and so on.
7-2D CALL PROVISIONS
Many corporate and municipal bonds contain a call provision that gives the issuer
the right to call the bonds for redemption. The call provision generally states that
the issuer must pay the bondholders an amount greater than the par value if they
are called. The additional sum, which is termed a call premium, is often equal to
one year’s interest. For example, the call premium on a 10-year bond with a 10%
annual coupon and a par value of $1,000 might be $100, which means that the
issuer would have to pay investors $1,100 (the par value plus the call premium) if
it wanted to call the bonds. In most cases, the provisions in the bond contract are
set so that the call premium declines over time as the bonds approach maturity.
Also, while some bonds are immediately callable, in most cases, bonds are often
not callable until several years after issue, generally 5 to 10 years. This is known as
a deferred call, and such bonds are said to have call protection.
Companies are not likely to call bonds unless interest rates have declined
significantly since the bonds were issued. Suppose a company sold bonds when
interest rates were relatively high. Provided the issue is callable, the company
could sell a new issue of low-yielding securities if and when interest rates drop,
use the proceeds of the new issue to retire the high-rate issue, and thus reduce
its interest expense. This process is called a refunding operation. Thus, the call

3In July 1993, The Walt Disney Company, attempting to lock in a low interest rate, stretched the
meaning of “long-term bond” by issuing the first 100-year bonds sold by any borrower in modern
times. Soon after, Coca-Cola became the second company to sell 100-year bonds. Other companies
that have issued 100-year bonds include Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, BellSouth
Telecommunications, Wisconsin Electric Power Company, and IBM.

privilege is valuable to the firm but detrimental to long-term investors, who will
need to reinvest the funds they receive at the new and lower rates. Accordingly,
the interest rate on a new issue of callable bonds will exceed that on the
company’s new noncallable bonds. For example, on February 28, 2014, Pacific
Timber Company sold a bond issue yielding 6% that was callable immediately.
On the same day, Northwest Milling Company sold an issue with similar risk
and maturity that yielded only 5 5%; but its bonds were noncallable for 10
years. Investors were willing to accept a 0 5% lower coupon interest rate on
Northwest’s bonds for the assurance that the 5 5% interest rate would be earned
for at least 10 years. Pacific, on the other hand, had to incur a 0 5% higher
annual interest rate for the option of calling the bonds in the event of a decline
in rates.
Note that the refunding operation is similar to a homeowner refinancing his or
her home mortgage after a decline in interest rates. Consider, for example, a
homeowner with an outstanding mortgage at 7%. If mortgage rates fall to 4%,
the homeowner will probably find it beneficial to refinance the mortgage. There
may be some fees involved in the refinancing, but the lower rate may be more
than enough to offset those fees. The analysis required is essentially the same for
homeowners and corporations.
7-2E SINKING FUNDS
Some bonds include a sinking fund provision that facilitates the orderly retire-
ment of the bond issue. Years ago firms were required to deposit money with a
trustee, which invested the funds and then used the accumulated sum to retire the
bonds when they matured. Today, though, sinking fund provisions require the
issuer to buy back a specified percentage of the issue each year. A failure to meet
the sinking fund requirement constitutes a default, which may throw the company
into bankruptcy. Therefore, a sinking fund is a mandatory payment.
Suppose a company issued $100 million of 20-year bonds and it is required to
call 5% of the issue, or $5 million of bonds, each year. In most cases, the issuer can
handle the sinking fund requirement in either of two ways:
1.
It can call in for redemption, at par value, the required $5 million of bonds.
The bonds are numbered serially, and those called for redemption would be
determined by a lottery administered by the trustee.
2.
The company can buy the required number of bonds on the open market.
The firm will choose the least-cost method. If interest rates have fallen since
the bond was issued, the bond will sell for more than its par value. In this case, the
firm will use the call option. However, if interest rates have risen, the bonds will
sell at a price below par; so the firm can and will buy $5 million par value of bonds
in the open market for less than $5 million. Note that a call for sinking fund
purposes is generally different from a refunding call because most sinking fund
calls require no call premium. However, only a small percentage of the issue is
normally callable in a given year.
Although sinking funds are designed to protect investors by ensuring that the
bonds are retired in an orderly fashion, these funds work to the detriment of
bondholders if the bond’s coupon rate is higher than the current market rate. For
example, suppose the bond has a 10% coupon but similar bonds now yield only
7 5%. A sinking fund call at par would require a long-term investor to give up a
bond that pays $100 of interest and then to reinvest in a bond that pays only
$75 per year. This is an obvious disadvantage to those bondholders whose bonds
are called. On balance, however, bonds that have a sinking fund are regarded as

being safer than those without such a provision; so at the time they are issued,
sinking fund bonds have lower coupon rates than otherwise similar bonds
without sinking funds.
7-2F OTHER FEATURES
Several other types of bonds are used sufficiently often to warrant mention.4 First,
convertible bonds are bonds that are exchangeable into shares of common stock
at a fixed price at the option of the bondholder. Convertibles offer investors the
chance for capital gains if the stock price increases, but that feature enables the
issuing company to set a lower coupon rate than on nonconvertible debt with
similar credit risk. Bonds issued with warrants are similar to convertibles; but
instead of giving the investor an option to exchange the bonds for stock, warrants
give the holder an option to buy stock for a stated price, thereby providing a
capital gain if the stock’s price rises. Because of this factor, bonds issued with
warrants, like convertibles, carry lower coupon rates than otherwise similar non-
convertible bonds.
Whereas callable bonds give the issuer the right to retire the debt prior to
maturity, putable bonds allow investors to require the company to pay in
advance. If interest rates rise, investors will put the bonds back to the company
and reinvest in higher coupon bonds. Yet another type of bond is the income
bond, which pays interest only if the issuer has earned enough money to pay the
interest. Thus, income bonds cannot bankrupt a company; but from an investor’s
standpoint, they are riskier than “regular” bonds. Yet another bond is the
indexed, or purchasing power, bond. The interest rate is based on an inflation
index such as the consumer price index (CPI); so the interest paid rises auto-
matically when the inflation rate rises, thus protecting bondholders against
inflation. As we mentioned in Chapter 6, the U.S. Treasury is the main issuer
of indexed bonds. Recall that these Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)
generally pay a real return varying from 1% to 3%, plus the rate of inflation
during the past year.

7-3 BOND VALUATION
The value of any financial asset—a stock, a bond, a lease, or even a physical asset
such as an apartment building or a piece of machinery—is the present value of the
cash flows the asset is expected to produce. The cash flows for a standard coupon-
bearing bond, like those of Allied Foods, consist of interest payments during the
bond’s 15-year life plus the amount borrowed (generally the par value) when the
bond matures. In the case of a floating-rate bond, the interest payments vary over
time. For zero coupon bonds, there are no interest payments, so the only cash flow
is the face amount when the bond matures. For a “regular” bond with a fixed
coupon, like Allied’s, here is the situation:
3

Bond’s value
rd%
N
INT

INT
Where:
rd = the market rate of interest on the bond, 10%. This is the discount rate
used to calculate the present value of the cash flows, which is also the
bond’s price. In Chapter 6, we discussed in detail the various factors
that determine market interest rates. Note that rd is not the coupon
interest rate. However, rd is equal to the coupon rate at times, espe-
cially the day the bond is issued; and when the two rates are equal, as
in this case, the bond sells at par.
N = the number of years before the bond matures = 15. N declines over
time after the bond has been issued; so a bond that had a maturity of
15 years when it was issued (original maturity = 15) will have N
14
after 1 year, N
13 after 2 years, and so forth. At this point, we
assume that the bond pays interest once a year, or annually; so N is
measured in years. Later on we will analyze semiannual payment
bonds, which pay interest every 6 months.
INT = dollars of interest paid each year = Coupon rate × Par value =
0 10 $1,000
$100.
In calculator terminology,
INT
PMT
100.
If the bond had been a semiannual payment bond, the payment would
have been $50 every 6 months. The payment would have been zero if
Allied had issued zero coupon bonds, and it would have varied over
time if the bond had been a “floater.”
M = the par, or maturity, value of the bond
$1,000. This amount must be
paid at maturity. Back in the 1970s and before, when paper bonds with
paper coupons were used, most bonds had a $1,000 value. Now with
computer-entry bonds, the par amount purchased can vary; but in the
text we use $1,000 for simplicity.

variables except the bond’s value (and price, assuming an equilibrium exists), VB:

The cash flows consist of an annuity of N years plus a lump sum payment at the
end of Year N, and this fact is reflected in Equation 7.1.
We could simply discount each cash flow back to the present and sum those
PVs to find the bond’s value; see Figure 7.1 for an example. However, this proce-
dure is not very efficient, especially when the bond has many years to maturity.
Therefore, we use a financial calculator to solve the problem. Here is the setup:

I YR

100, and M
FV
1000; then
press the PV key to find the bond’s value, $1,000.5 Because the PV is an outflow to
the investor, it is shown with a negative sign. The calculator is programmed to
solve Equation 7.1. It finds the PV of an annuity of $100 per year for 15 years
discounted at 10%; then it finds the PV of the $1,000 maturity payment; then it
adds those two PVs to find the bond’s value. In this Allied example, the bond is
selling at a price equal to its par value.
Whenever the bond’s market, or going, rate, rd, is equal to its coupon rate, a
fixed-rate bond will sell at its par value. Normally, the coupon rate is set at the
going rate in the market the day a bond is issued, causing it to sell at par initially.
The coupon rate remains fixed after the bond is issued, but interest rates in the
market move up and down. Looking at Equation 7.1, we see that an increase in the
market interest rate rd causes the price of an outstanding bond to fall, whereas a
decrease in the rate causes the bond’s price to rise. For example, if the market
interest rate on Allied’s bond increased to 15% immediately after it was issued, we
would recalculate the price with the new market interest rate as follows:
FV
PV
I/YR
N
PMT
1000
100

5Spreadsheets can also be used to solve for the bond’s value. The PV of this bond can be calculated
using Excel’s PV function:
= PV(0.1,15,100,1000)
PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
This gives the bond’s value as $1,000. Note that type is left blank because cash flows occur at year-end.

The bond’s price would fall to $707 63, well below par, as a result of the increase
in interest rates. Whenever the going rate of interest rises above the coupon rate, a
fixed-rate bond’s price will fall below its par value; this type of bond is called a
discount bond.
On the other hand, bond prices rise when market interest rates fall. For
example, if the market interest rate on Allied’s bond decreased to 5% immediately
after it was issued, we would once again recalculate its price as follows:
FV
PV
I/YR
N
PMT
1000
100

15
= –1,518.98
In this case, the price rises to $1,518 98. In general, whenever the going interest
rate falls below the coupon rate, a fixed-rate bond’s price will rise above its par
value; this type of bond is called a premium bond.
To summarize, here is the situation:
rd = coupon rate, fixed-rate bond sells at par; hence, it is a par bond.
rd > coupon rate, fixed-rate bond sells below par; hence, it is a discount bond.
rd < coupon rate, fixed-rate bond sells above par; hence, it is a premium bond.

7-4 BOND YIELDS
If you examine the bond market table of The Wall Street Journal or a price sheet put
out by a bond dealer, you will typically see information regarding each bond’s
maturity date, price, and coupon interest rate. You will also see a reported yield.
Unlike the coupon interest rate, which is fixed, the bond’s yield varies from day to
day depending on current market conditions.
To be most useful, the bond’s yield should give us an estimate of the rate of
return we would earn if we purchased the bond today and held it over its
remaining life. If the bond is not callable, its remaining life is its years to maturity.
If it is callable, its remaining life is the years to maturity if it is not called or the
years to the call if it is called. In the following sections, we explain how to calculate
those two possible yields and which one is likely to be earned by an investor.
Q U E S T I O N :
A friend of yours just invested in an outstanding bond with a 5% annual coupon and a
remaining maturity of 10 years. The bond has a par value of $1,000 and the market interest
rate is currently 7%. How much did your friend pay for the bond? Is it a par, premium, or
discount bond?
A N S W E R :
Using a financial calculator, we can determine that your friend paid $859.53 for the bond.
FV
PV
I/YR
N
PMT

Using Excel’s PV function we solve for the bond’s value as follows:
= PV(0.07,10,50,1000)
PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
Here we find that the bond’s value is equal to $859.53.
Because the bond’s coupon rate (5%) is less than the current market interest rate (7%),
the bond is a discount bond—reflecting that interest rates have increased since this bond
was originally issued.

A bond that matures in 8 years has a par value of $1,000 and an annual coupon
payment of $70; its market interest rate is 9%. What is its price? ($889.30)

rate of 10%; the market interest rate is 8%. What is its price? ($1,150.72)

7-4A YIELD TO MATURITY
Suppose you were offered a 14-year, 10% annual coupon, $1,000 par value bond at
a price of $1,494 93. What rate of interest would you earn on your investment if
you bought the bond, held it to maturity, and received the promised interest and
maturity payments? This rate is called the bond’s yield to maturity (YTM), and it
is the interest rate generally discussed by investors when they talk about rates of
return and the rate reported by The Wall Street Journal and other publications. To
find the YTM, all you need to do is solve Equation 7.1 for rd as follows:

Q U E S T I O N :
You have just purchased an outstanding 15-year bond with a par value of $1,000 for
$1,145 68. Its annual coupon payment is $75. What is the bond’s yield to maturity?

Using a financial calculator, we can determine that the bond’s YTM is 6%.

= RATE(14,100,–1494.93,1000)
RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
This gives the YTM as 5%. Note that we didn’t need to specify a value for type (because the cash flows
occur at the end of the year) or guess.
Yield to Maturity (YTM)
The rate of return earned
on a bond if it is held to
maturity.

The yield to maturity can also be viewed as the bond’s promised rate of return,
which is the return that investors will receive if all of the promised payments are
made. However, the yield to maturity equals the expected rate of return only when
(1) the probability of default is zero and (2) the bond cannot be called. If there is
some default risk or the bond may be called, there is some chance that the
promised payments to maturity will not be received, in which case the calculated
yield to maturity will exceed the expected return.
Note also that a bond’s calculated yield to maturity changes whenever interest
rates in the economy change, which is almost daily. An investor who purchases a
bond and holds it until it matures will receive the YTM that existed on the
purchase date, but the bond’s calculated YTM will change frequently between
the purchase date and the maturity date.
7-4B YIELD TO CALL
If you purchase a bond that is callable and the company calls it, you do not have
the option of holding it to maturity. Therefore, the yield to maturity would not be
earned. For example, if Allied’s 10% coupon bonds were callable and if interest
rates fell from 10% to 5%, the company could call in the 10% bonds, replace them
with 5% bonds, and save $100
$50
$50 interest per bond per year. This would
be beneficial to the company but not to its bondholders.
If current interest rates are well below an outstanding bond’s coupon rate, a
callable bond is likely to be called; and investors will estimate its most likely rate
of return as the yield to call (YTC) rather than the yield to maturity. To calculate
the YTC, we modify Equation 7.1, using years to call as N and the call price rather
than the maturity value as the ending payment. Here’s the modified equation:
Price of bond
N
t
1
INT
1
rd
t
Call price
1
rd
N
7.2
Here N is the number of years until the company can call the bond; call price is the
price the company must pay in order to call the bond (it is often set equal to the
par value plus one year’s interest); and rd is the YTC.
To illustrate, suppose Allied’s bonds had a deferred call provision that per-
mitted the company, if it desired, to call them 10 years after their issue date at a
price of $1,100. Suppose further that interest rates had fallen and that 1 year after
issuance, the going interest rate had declined, causing their price to rise to
$1,494 93. Here is the time line and the setup for finding the bonds’ YTC with a
financial calculator:

Using Excel’s RATE function we solve for the bond’s YTM as follows:
= RATE(15,75,–1145.68,1000)
RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv], [type], [guess])
Here we find the bond’s YTM is equal to 6%.
Because the bond’s coupon rate $75 $1,000
7 5%
is greater than its YTM (6%), the
bond is a premium bond—indicating that interest rates have declined since the bond was
originally issued.

The YTC is 4 21%—this is the return you would earn if you bought an Allied bond
at a price of $1,494 93 and it was called 9 years from today. (It could not be called
until 10 years after issuance. One year has gone by, so there are 9 years left until
the first call date.)
A company is more likely to call its bonds if they are able to replace their
current high-coupon debt with cheaper financing. Broadly speaking, a bond is
more likely to be called if its price is above par—because a price above par means
that the going market interest rate (the yield to maturity) is less than the coupon
rate. So, do you think Allied will call its 10% bonds when they become callable?
Allied’s action will depend on what the going interest rate is when they become
callable. If the going rate remains at rd
5%, Allied could save 10%
5%
5%, or $50 per bond per year; so it would call the 10% bonds and replace them
with a new 5% issue. There would be some cost to the company to refund the
bonds; but because the interest savings would most likely be worth the cost, Allied
would probably refund them. Therefore, you should expect to earn the
YTC
4 21% rather than the YTM
5% if you purchased the bond under the
indicated conditions.
Q U E S T I O N :
You have just purchased an outstanding 15-year bond with a par value of $1,000 for
$1,145 68. Its annual coupon payment is $75. We calculated the YTM of this bond (6%) in
the Quick Question box on page 228. Now, assume that this bond is callable in 7 years at a
price of $1,075. What is the bond’s YTC? If the yield curve remains flat at its current level
during this time period, would you expect to earn the YTM or YTC?
A N S W E R :
Using a financial calculator, we can determine that the bond’s YTC is 5 81%.

Here we find the bond’s YTC is equal to 5 81%.
This bond sells at a premium so interest rates have declined since the bond was originally
issued. If the yield curve remained flat at this current level during the next 7 years, you
would expect the firm to call the bond and issue bonds at the lower 6% interest rate,
assuming the cost of doing so was lower than the $75

7-5 CHANGES IN BOND VALUES OVER TIME
When a coupon bond is issued, the coupon is generally set at a level that causes
the bond’s market price to equal its par value. If a lower coupon were set,
investors would not be willing to pay $1,000 for the bond; but if a higher coupon
were set, investors would clamor for it and bid its price up over $1,000. Invest-
ment bankers can judge quite precisely the coupon rate that will cause a bond to
sell at its $1,000 par value.
A bond that has just been issued is known as a new issue. Once it has been
issued, it is an outstanding bond, also called a seasoned issue. Newly issued bonds
generally sell at prices very close to par, but the prices of outstanding bonds can
vary widely from par. Except for floating-rate bonds, coupon payments are con-
stant; so when economic conditions change, a bond with a $100 coupon that sold
at its $1,000 par value when it was issued will sell for more or less than $1,000
thereafter.
Among its outstanding bonds, Allied currently has three equally risky issues
that will mature in 15 years:
•
Allied’s just-issued 15-year bonds have a 10% annual coupon. They were
issued at par, which means that the market interest rate on their issue date
was also 10%. Because the coupon rate equals the market interest rate, these
bonds are trading at par, or $1,000.
•
Five years ago Allied issued 20-year bonds with a 7% annual coupon. These
bonds currently have 15 years remaining until maturity. They were originally
issued at par, which means that 5 years ago the market interest rate was 7%.
Currently, this bond’s coupon rate is less than the 10% market rate, so they sell
S E L F T E S T
Explain the difference between yield to maturity (YTM) and yield to call (YTC).
Halley Enterprises’ bonds currently sell for $975. They have a 7-year maturity, an
annual coupon of $90, and a par value of $1,000. What is their yield to maturity?
(9.51%)
The Henderson Company’s bonds currently sell for $1,275. They pay a $120
annual coupon, have a 20-year maturity, and a par value of $1,000, but they can
be called in 5 years at $1,120. What are their YTM and their YTC, and if the
yield curve remained flat which rate would investors expect to earn? (8.99%;
7.31%; YTC)
7Brokerage houses occasionally report a bond’s current yield, defined as the annual interest payment
divided by the current price. For example, if Allied’s 10% coupon bonds were selling for $985, the
current yield would be $100/$985 = 10.15%. Unlike the YTM or YTC, the current yield does not
represent the actual return that investors should expect because it does not account for the capital
gain or loss that will be realized if the bond is held until it matures or is called. The current yield was
popular before calculators and computers came along because it was easy to calculate. However, it can
be misleading, and now it’s easy enough to calculate the YTM and YTC.

at a discount. Using a financial calculator or spreadsheet, we can quickly find
that they have a price of $771 82. (Set N
15, I YR
10, PMT
70, and
FV
1000 and solve for the PV to calculate the price.)
•
Ten years ago Allied issued 25-year bonds with a 13% annual coupon. These
bonds currently have 15 years remaining until maturity. They were originally
issued at par, which means that 10 years ago the market interest rate must
have been 13%. Because their coupon rate is greater than the current market
rate, they sell at a premium. Using a financial calculator or spreadsheet, we
can find that their price is $1,228 18. (Set N
15, I YR
10, PMT
130, and
FV
1000 and solve for the PV to determine the price.)
Each of these three bonds has a 15-year maturity; each has the same credit risk;
and thus each has the same market interest rate, 10%. However, the bonds have
different prices because of their different coupon rates.
Now let’s consider what would happen to the prices of these three bonds
over the 15 years until they mature, assuming that market interest rates remain
constant at 10% and Allied does not default on its payments. Table 7.1 demon-
strates how the prices of each of these bonds will change over time if market
interest rates remain at 10%. One year from now each bond will have a maturity
of 14 years—that is, N
14. With a financial calculator, override N
15 with
N
14 and press the PV key; that gives you the value of each bond 1 year from
now. Continuing, set N
13, N
12, and so forth, to see how the prices change
over time.
Table 7.1 also shows the current yield (which is the coupon interest
divided by the bond’s price), the capital gains yield, and the total return over
time. For any given year, the capital gains yield is calculated as the bond’s
annual change in price divided by the beginning-of-year price. For example, if
a bond was selling for $1,000 at the beginning of the year and $1,035 at the
end of the year, its capital gains yield for the year would be $35 $1,000
3 5%.
(If the bond was selling at a premium, its price would decline over time. Then
the capital gains yield would be negative, but it would be offset by a high
current yield.) A bond’s total return is equal to the current yield plus the
capital gains yield. In the absence of default risk and assuming market equili-
brium, the total return is also equal to YTM and the market interest rate,
which in our example is 10%.
Figure 7.2 plots the three bonds’ predicted prices as calculated in Table 7.1.
Notice that the bonds have very different price paths over time but that at
maturity, all three will sell at their par value of $1,000. Here are some points
about the prices of the bonds over time:
•
The price of the 10% coupon bond trading at par will remain at $1,000 if the
market interest rate remains at 10%. Therefore, its current yield will remain at
10% and its capital gains yield will be zero each year.
•
The 7% bond trades at a discount; but at maturity, it must sell at par because
that is the amount the company will pay its bondholders. Therefore, its price
must rise over time.
•
The 13% coupon bond trades at a premium. However, its price must be equal
to its par value at maturity; so the price must decline over time.
While the prices of the 7% and 13% coupon bonds move in opposite directions
over time, each bond provides investors with the same total return, 10%, which is
also the total return on the 10% coupon par value bond. The discount bond has a
low coupon rate (and therefore a low current yield), but it provides a capital gain

7-6 BONDS WITH SEMIANNUAL COUPONS
Although some bonds pay interest annually, the vast majority actually make
payments semiannually. To evaluate semiannual bonds, we must modify the
valuation model (Equation 7.1) as follows:

What is meant by the terms new issue and seasoned issue?
Last year a firm issued 20-year, 8% annual coupon bonds at a par value of
$1,000.
a. Suppose that one year later the going market interest rate drops to 6%. What
is the new price of the bonds assuming they now have 19 years to maturity?
($1,223.16)
b. Suppose that one year after issue, the going market interest rate is 10%
(rather than 6%). What would the price have been? ($832.70)
Why do the prices of fixed-rate bonds fall if expectations for inflation rise?
8In this example (and throughout the text), we ignore the tax effects associated with purchasing
different types of bonds. For coupon bonds, under the current Tax Code (June 2013), coupon
payments are taxed as ordinary income, whereas long-term capital gains are taxed at the long-term
capital gains tax rate. As we mentioned in Chapter 3, for most investors, the long-term capital gains tax
rate is lower than the personal tax rate. Moreover, while coupon payments are taxed each year, capital
gains taxes are deferred until the bond is sold or matures. Consequently, all else equal, investors end
up paying lower taxes on discount bonds because a greater percentage of their total return comes in the
form of capital gains. For details on the tax treatment of zero coupon bonds, see Web Appendix 7A.

1.
Divide the annual coupon interest payment by 2 to determine the dollars of
interest paid each six months.
2.
Multiply the years to maturity, N, by 2 to determine the number of
semiannual periods.
3.
Divide the nominal (quoted) interest rate, rd, by 2 to determine the periodic
(semiannual) interest rate.
On a time line, there would be twice as many payments, but each would be
half as large as with an annual payment bond. Making the indicated changes
results in the following equation for finding a semiannual bond’s value:

To illustrate, assume that Allied Food’s 15-year bonds as discussed in Section 7-3 pay
$50 of interest each 6 months rather than $100 at the end of each year. Thus, each
interest payment is only half as large but there are twice as many of them. We
would describe the coupon rate as “10% with semiannual payments.”9
When the going (nominal) rate is rd
5% with semiannual compounding, the
value of a 15-year, 10% semiannual coupon bond that pays $50 interest every
6 months is found as follows:
FV

Enter N

to obtain the bond’s value, $1,523 26. The value with semiannual interest pay-
ments is slightly larger than $1,518 98, the value when interest is paid annually as
we calculated in Section 7-3. This higher value occurs because each interest
payment is received somewhat faster under semiannual compounding.
Alternatively, when we know the price of a semiannual bond, we can
easily back out the bond’s nominal yield to maturity. In the previous example,
if you were told that a 15-year bond with a 10% semiannual coupon was
selling for $1,523 26, you could solve for the bond’s periodic interest rate as
follows:
FV

9In this situation, the coupon rate of “10% paid semiannually” is the rate that bond dealers, corporate
treasurers, and investors generally discuss. Of course, if this bond were issued at par, its effective annual
rate would be higher than 10%.

7-7 ASSESSING A BOND’S RISKINESS
In this section, we identify and explain the two key factors that impact a bond’s
riskiness. Once those factors are identified, we differentiate between them and
discuss how you can minimize these risks.
Q U E S T I O N :
You have just purchased an outstanding noncallable, 15-year bond with a par value of
$1,000. Assume that this bond pays interest of 7 5%, with semiannual compounding. If the
going (nominal) annual rate is 6%, what price did you pay for this bond? How does the
price compare to the price of the annual coupon bond?
A N S W E R :
Using a financial calculator, we can determine that the bond’s price is $1,147.00.

Using Excel’s PV function we solve for the semiannual bond’s price as follows:
= PV(0.03,30,37.5,1000)
PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
Here we find that the bond’s value is equal to $1,147 00.
In the Quick Question box on page 228 we calculated the YTM on this annual bond
whose price was $1,145 68. Notice that the semiannual bond’s price is $1,147 00
$1,145 68
$1 32 greater due to the interest payments being received semiannually
rather than on an annual basis.
S E L F T E S T
Describe how the annual payment bond valuation formula is changed to
evaluate semiannual coupon bonds and write the revised formula.
Hartwell Corporation’s bonds have a 20-year maturity, an 8% semiannual
coupon, and a face value of $1,000. The going nominal annual interest rate
(rd) is 7%. What is the bond’s price? ($1,106.78)
10We can use a similar process to calculate the nominal yield to call for a semiannual bond. The only
difference would be that N should represent the number of semiannual periods until the bond is
callable and FV should be the bond’s call price rather than its par value.

7-7A PRICE RISK
As we saw in Chapter 6, interest rates fluctuate over time and when they rise, the
value of outstanding bonds decline. This risk of a decline in bond values due to
an increase in interest rates is called price risk (or interest rate risk). To illustrate,
refer back to Allied’s bonds; assume once more that they have a 10% annual
coupon; and assume that you bought one of these bonds at its par value, $1,000.
Shortly after your purchase, the going interest rate rises from 10% to 15%.11
As we saw in Section 7-3, this interest rate increase would cause the bond’s
price to fall from $1,000 to $707 63, so you would have a loss of $292 37 on the
bond.12
Because interest rates can and do rise, rising rates cause losses to
bondholders; people or firms who invest in bonds are exposed to risk from
increasing interest rates.
Price risk is higher on bonds that have long maturities than on bonds that will
mature in the near future.13 This follows because the longer the maturity, the
longer before the bond will be paid off and the bondholder can replace it with
another bond with a higher coupon. This point can be demonstrated by showing
how the value of a 1-year bond with a 10% annual coupon fluctuates with changes
in rd and then comparing those changes with changes on a 15-year bond. The
1-year bond’s values at different interest rates are shown below.

Price (Interest Rate) Risk
The risk of a decline in a
bond’s price due to an
increase in interest rates.
11An immediate increase in rates from 10% to 15% would be quite unusual, and it would occur only if
something quite bad were revealed about the company or happened in the economy. Smaller but still
significant rate increases that adversely affect bondholders do occur fairly often.
12You would have an accounting (and tax) loss only if you sold the bond; if you held it to maturity, you
would not have such a loss. However, even if you did not sell, you would still have suffered a real
economic loss in an opportunity cost sense because you would have lost the opportunity to invest at
15% and would be stuck with a 10% bond in a 15% market. In an economic sense, “paper losses” are
just as bad as realized accounting losses.
13Actually, a bond’s maturity and coupon rate both affect price risk. Low coupons mean that most of
the bond’s return will come from repayment of principal, whereas on a high-coupon bond with the
same maturity, more of the cash flows will come in during the early years due to the relatively large
coupon payments.

and press PV to find the bond’s value at a 10% rate; it drops to $1,000. Then enter

15 and press the PV key to find the last bond value, $956 52.
The effects of increasing rates on the 15-year bond value as found earlier in
Section 7-3 can be compared with the just-calculated effects for the 1-year bond. This
comparison is shown in Figure 7.3, where we show bond prices at several rates and
then plot those prices on the graph. Compared to the 1-year bond, the 15-year bond
is far more sensitive to changes in rates. At a 10% interest rate, both the 15-year and
1-year bonds are valued at $1,000. When rates rise to 15%, the 15-year bond falls to
$707 63, but the 1-year bond falls only to $956 52. The price decline for the 1-year
bond is only 4 35%, while that for the 15-year bond is 29 24%.
For bonds with similar coupons, this differential interest rate sensitivity always holds
true—the longer a bond’s maturity, the more its price changes in response to a given
change in interest rates. Thus, even if the risk of default on two bonds is exactly the
same, the one with the longer maturity is typically exposed to more risk from a
rise in interest rates.14
The logical explanation for this difference in price risk is simple. Suppose you
bought a 15-year bond that yielded 10%, or $100 a year. Now suppose interest
rates on comparable-risk bonds rose to 15%. You would be stuck receiving only
$100 of interest for the next 15 years. On the other hand, had you bought a 1-year
bond, you would have earned a low return for only 1 year. At the end of the year,
you would have received your $1,000 back; then you could have reinvested it and
earned 15%, or $150 per year, for the next 14 years.
7-7B REINVESTMENT RISK
As we saw in the preceding section, an increase in interest rates hurts bondholders
because it leads to a decline in the current value of a bond portfolio. But can a
decrease in interest rates also hurt bondholders? The answer is yes because if
interest rates fall, long-term investors will suffer a reduction in income. For
example, consider a retiree who has a bond portfolio and lives off the income it
produces. The bonds in the portfolio, on average, have coupon rates of 10%. Now
suppose interest rates decline to 5%. Many of the bonds will mature or be called;
as this occurs, the bondholder will have to replace 10% bonds with 5% bonds.
Thus, the retiree will suffer a reduction of income.15
The risk of an income decline due to a drop in interest rates is called
reinvestment risk, and its importance has been demonstrated to all bondholders
in recent years as a result of the sharp drop in rates since the mid-1980s. Reinvest-
ment risk is obviously high on callable bonds. It is also high on short-term bonds
because the shorter the bond’s maturity, the fewer the years before the relatively
high old-coupon bonds will be replaced with the new low-coupon issues. Thus,
retirees whose primary holdings are short-term bonds or other debt securities will
be hurt badly by a decline in rates, but holders of noncallable long-term bonds will
continue to enjoy the old high rates.
14lf a 10-year bond were plotted on the graph in Figure 7.3, its curve would lie between those of the
15-year and the 1-year bonds. The curve of a 1-month bond would be almost horizontal, indicating that
its price would change very little in response to an interest rate change; but a 100-year bond would
have a very steep slope, and the slope of a perpetuity would be even steeper. Also, a zero coupon
bond’s price is quite sensitive to interest rate changes; and the longer its maturity, the greater its price
sensitivity. Therefore, a 30-year zero coupon bond would have a huge amount of price risk.
15Charles Schwab makes this point in a recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, where he argues
that continued low interest rates have had a devastating effect on many senior citizens who live off of
the interest generated from their investments. For additional information, refer to Charles Schwab,
“Low Interest Rates Are Squeezing Seniors,” The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com), March 30, 2010.

7-7C COMPARING PRICE RISK AND REINVESTMENT RISK
Note that price risk relates to the current market value of the bond portfolio, while
reinvestment risk relates to the income the portfolio produces. If you hold long-
term bonds, you will face significant price risk because the value of your portfolio
will decline if interest rates rise, but you will not face much reinvestment risk
because your income will be stable. On the other hand, if you hold short-term
bonds, you will not be exposed to much price risk, but you will be exposed to
significant reinvestment risk. Table 7.2 summarizes how a bond’s maturity and
coupon rate affect its price risk and reinvestment risk. For example, a long-term
zero coupon bond will have a very high level of price risk and relatively little
reinvestment risk. In contrast, a short-term bond with a high coupon rate will have
low price risk, but considerable reinvestment risk.
Which type of risk is “more relevant” to a given investor depends on how
long the investor plans to hold the bonds—this is often referred to as his or her
investment horizon. To illustrate, consider an investor who has a relatively short

1-year investment horizon—say, the investor plans to go to graduate school a year
from now and needs money for tuition and expenses. Reinvestment risk is of
minimal concern to this investor because there is little time to reinvest. The
investor could eliminate price risk by buying a 1-year Treasury security because
he would be assured of receiving the face value of the bond 1 year from now (the
investment horizon). However, if this investor were to buy a long-term Treasury
security, he would bear a considerable amount of price risk because, as we have
seen, long-term bond prices decline when interest rates rise. Consequently, inves-
tors with shorter investment horizons should view long-term bonds as being more
risky than short-term bonds.
By contrast, the reinvestment risk inherent in short-term bonds is especially
relevant to investors with longer investment horizons. Consider a retiree who is
living on income from her portfolio. If this investor buys 1-year bonds, she will
have to “roll them over” every year; and if rates fall, her income in subsequent
years will likewise decline. A younger couple saving for their retirement or their
children’s college costs, for example, would be affected similarly because if they
buy short-term bonds, they too will have to roll over their portfolio at possibly
much lower rates. Because of the uncertainty today about the rates that will be
earned on these reinvested cash flows, long-term investors should be especially
concerned about the reinvestment risk inherent in short-term bonds.
To account for the effects related to both a bond’s maturity and coupon,
many analysts focus on a measure called duration. A bond’s duration is the
weighted average of the time it takes to receive each of the bond’s cash flows. It
follows that a zero coupon bond whose only cash flow is paid at maturity has a
duration equal to its maturity. On the other hand, a coupon bond will have a
duration that is less than its maturity. You can use Excel’s DURATION function
to calculate a bond’s duration. We discuss duration in greater detail in Web
Appendix 7B.
One way to manage both price and reinvestment risk is to buy a zero coupon
Treasury bond with a duration equal to the investor’s investment horizon. A very
simple way to do this is to buy a zero coupon bond with a maturity that matches
the investment horizon. For example, assume your investment horizon is 10 years.
If you buy a 10-year zero, you will receive a guaranteed payment in 10 years equal
to the bond’s face value.16 Moreover, as there are no coupons to reinvest, there is
no reinvestment risk. This explains why investors with specific goals often invest
in zero coupon bonds.17

16Note that in this example, the 10-year zero technically has a considerable amount of price risk
because its current price is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. However, the year-to-year
movements in price should not be of great concern to an investor with a 10-year investment horizon
because the investor knows that, regardless of what happens to interest rates, the bond’s price will still
be $1,000 when it matures.
17Two words of caution about zeros are in order. First, as we show in Web Appendix 7A, investors in
zeros must pay taxes each year on their accrued gain in value even though the bonds don’t pay any
cash until they mature. Second, buying a zero coupon bond with a maturity equal to your investment
horizon enables you to lock in a nominal cash payoff, but the real value of that payment still depends
on what happens to inflation during your investment horizon.

Recall from Chapter 6 that maturity risk premiums are generally positive.18
Moreover, a positive maturity risk premium implies that investors, on average,
regard longer-term bonds as being riskier than shorter-term bonds. That, in turn,
suggests that the average investor is more concerned with price risk. Still, it is
appropriate for each investor to consider his or her own situation, to recognize the
risks inherent in bonds with different maturities, and to construct a portfolio that
deals best with the investor’s most relevant risk.
7-8 DEFAULT RISK
Potential default is another important risk that bondholders face. If the issuer
defaults, investors will receive less than the promised return. Recall from Chapter 6
that the quoted interest rate includes a default risk premium—the higher the
probability of default, the higher the premium and thus the yield to maturity.
Default risk on Treasuries is zero, but this risk is substantial for lower-grade
corporate and municipal bonds.
To illustrate, suppose two bonds have the same promised cash flows—their
coupon rates, maturities, liquidity, and inflation exposures are identical; but one
has more default risk than the other. Investors will naturally pay more for the one
with less chance of default. As a result, bonds with higher default risk have higher
market rates: rd
r
IP
DRP
LP
MRP. If a bond’s default risk changes, rd
and thus the price will be affected. Thus, if the default risk on Allied’s bonds
increases, their price will fall and the yield to maturity YTM
rd will increase.
7-8A VARIOUS TYPES OF CORPORATE BONDS
Default risk is influenced by the financial strength of the issuer and the terms of
the bond contract, including whether collateral has been pledged to secure the
bond. The characteristics of some key types of bonds are described in this section.
Mortgage Bonds
Under a mortgage bond, the corporation pledges specific assets as security for the
bond. To illustrate, in 2014, Billingham Corporation needed $10 million to build a
regional distribution center. Bonds in the amount of $4 million, secured by a first
mortgage on the property, were issued. (The remaining $6 million was financed
with equity capital.) If Billingham defaults on the bonds, the bondholders can
foreclose on the property and sell it to satisfy their claims.
S E L F T E S T
Differentiate between price risk and reinvestment risk.
To which type of risk are holders of long-term bonds more exposed? Short-term
bondholders?
What type of security can be used to minimize both price risk and reinvestment
risk for an investor with a fixed investment horizon? Does this security protect
the real payoff? Explain.
18The fact that maturity risk premiums are positive suggests that most investors have relatively short
investment horizons, or at least worry about short-term changes in their net worth. See Ibbotson Stocks,
Bonds, Bills, and Inflation: 2013 Valuation Yearbook (Chicago: Morningstar, Inc., 2013), which finds that
the maturity risk premium for long-term bonds has averaged 1.5% over the past 87 years.
Mortgage Bond
A bond backed by fixed
assets. First mortgage
bonds are senior in
priority to claims of
second mortgage bonds.

If Billingham had chosen to, it could have issued second mortgage bonds
secured by the same $10 million of assets. In the event of liquidation, the holders
of the second mortgage bonds would have a claim against the property, but only
after the first mortgage bondholders had been paid in full. Thus, second mort-
gages are sometimes called junior mortgages because they are junior in priority to
the claims of senior mortgages, or first mortgage bonds.
All mortgage bonds are subject to an indenture, which is a legal document
that spells out in detail the rights of the bondholders and the corporation. The
indentures of many major corporations were written 20, 30, 40, or more years ago.
These indentures are generally “open-ended,” meaning that new bonds can be
issued from time to time under the same indenture. However, the amount of new
bonds that can be issued is usually limited to a specified percentage of the firm’s
total “bondable property,” which generally includes all land, plant, and equip-
ment. And, of course, the coupon interest rate on newly issued bonds changes
over time, along with the market rate on the older bonds.
Debentures
A debenture is an unsecured bond; and as such, it provides no specific collateral
as security for the obligation. Therefore, debenture holders are general creditors
whose claims are protected by property not otherwise pledged. In practice, the use
of debentures depends on the nature of the firm’s assets and on its general credit
strength. Extremely strong companies such as General Electric and Exxon Mobil
can use debentures because they do not need to put up property as security for
their debt. Debentures are also issued by weak companies that have already
pledged most of their assets as collateral for mortgage loans. In this case, the
debentures are quite risky and that risk will be reflected in their interest rates.
Subordinated Debentures
The term subordinate means “below” or “inferior to”; and in the event of bank-
ruptcy, subordinated debt has a claim on assets only after senior debt has been
paid in full. Subordinated debentures may be subordinated to designated notes
payable (usually bank loans) or to all other debt. In the event of liquidation or
reorganization, holders of subordinated debentures receive nothing until all senior
debt, as named in the debentures’ indenture, has been paid. Precisely how sub-
ordination works and how it strengthens the position of senior debtholders are
explained in detail in Web Appendix 7C.
7-8B BOND RATINGS
Since the early 1900s, bonds have been assigned quality ratings that reflect their
probability of going into default. The three major rating agencies are Moody’s
Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P), and Fitch
Investors Service. Moody’s and S&P’s rating designations are shown in Table 7.3.19
The triple- and double-A bonds are extremely safe. Single-A and triple-B bonds
are also strong enough to be called investment-grade bonds, and they are the
lowest-rated bonds that many banks and other institutional investors are per-
mitted by law to hold. Double-B and lower bonds are speculative, or junk, bonds;
and they have a significant probability of going into default.
Bond Rating Criteria
The framework used by rating agencies examines both qualitative and quantita-
tive factors. Quantitative factors relate to financial risk—examining a firm’s finan-
cial ratios such as those discussed in Chapter 4. Published ratios are, of course,
19In the discussion to follow, reference to the S&P rating is intended to imply the Moody’s and Fitch’s
ratings as well. Thus, triple-B bonds mean both BBB and Baa bonds; double-B bonds mean both BB and
Ba bonds; and so forth.
Indenture
A formal agreement
between the issuer and
the bondholders.
Debenture
A long-term bond that is
not secured by a
mortgage on specific
property.
Subordinated Debentures
Bonds having a claim on
assets only after the senior
debt has been paid in full
in the event of liquidation.
Investment-Grade Bonds
Bonds rated triple-B or
higher; many banks and
other institutional
investors are permitted by
law to hold only
investment-grade bonds.
Junk Bonds
High-risk, high-yield
bonds.

historical—they show the firm’s condition in the past, whereas bond investors are
more interested in the firm’s condition in the future. Qualitative factors considered
include an analysis of a firm’s business risk, such as its competitiveness within its
industry and the quality of its management. Determinants of bond ratings include
the following:
1.
Financial Ratios. All of the ratios are potentially important, but those related to
financial risk are key. The rating agencies’ analysts perform a financial
analysis along the lines discussed in Chapter 4 and forecast future ratios along
the lines described in Chapter 16.
2.
Qualitative Factors: Bond Contract Terms. Every bond is covered by a contract,
often called an indenture, between the issuer and the bondholders. The
indenture spells out all the terms related to the bond. Included in the
indenture are the maturity, the coupon interest rate, a statement of whether
the bond is secured by a mortgage on specific assets, any sinking fund
provisions, and a statement of whether the bond is guaranteed by some other
party with a high credit ranking. Other provisions might include restrictive
covenants such as requirements that the firm not let its debt ratio exceed a
stated level and that it keep its times-interest-earned ratio at or above a given
level. Some bond indentures are hundreds of pages long, while others are
quite short and cover just the terms of the loan.
3.
Miscellaneous Qualitative Factors. Included here are issues like the sensitivity of
the firm’s earnings to the strength of the economy, the way it is affected by
inflation, a statement of whether it is having or likely to have labor problems,
the extent of its international operations (including the stability of the
countries in which it operates), potential environmental problems, and
potential antitrust problems. Today the most important factor is exposure to
subprime loans, including the difficulty to determine the extent of this
exposure as a result of the complexity of the assets backed by such loans.
We see that bond ratings are determined by a great many factors, some
quantitative and some qualitative (or subjective). Also, the rating process is
dynamic—at times, one factor is of primary importance; at other times, some
other factor is key. Table 7.4 provides some of the criteria a rating agency
examines when rating a company’s bonds. Not surprisingly, companies with
lower business risk, lower debt ratios, higher cash flow to debt, and lower debt
to EBITDA typically have higher bond ratings.
Importance of Bond Ratings
Bond ratings are important to both firms and investors. First, because a bond’s
rating is an indicator of its default risk, the rating has a direct, measurable
influence on the bond’s interest rate and the firm’s cost of debt. Second, most
bonds are purchased by institutional investors rather than individuals and many

institutions are restricted to investment-grade securities. Thus, if a firm’s bonds
fall below BBB, it will have a difficult time selling new bonds because many
potential purchasers will not be allowed to buy them.
As a result of their higher risk and more restricted market, lower-grade bonds
have higher required rates of return, rd, than high-grade bonds. Figure 7.4 illus-
trates this point. In each of the years shown on the graph, U.S. government bonds

the highest yields. The figure also shows that the gaps between yields on the three
types of bonds vary over time, indicating that the cost differentials, or yield
spreads, fluctuate from year to year. Most recently there was a dramatic increase
in the yield spreads between corporate and Treasury securities in the aftermath of
the recent financial crisis. In the years since the crisis, these spreads have narrowed
as investors have slowly become once again more willing to hold riskier securities.
This point is highlighted in Figure 7.5, which gives the yields on the three types of
bonds and the yield spreads for AAA and BBB bonds over Treasuries in January
2009 and January 2013.20 Note first from Figure 7.5 that the risk-free rate, or
vertical axis intercept, was lower in January 2013 than it was in January 2009,
primarily reflecting the decline in both rates and expected inflation over the past

20A yield spread is related to but not identical to risk premiums on corporate bonds. The true risk
premium reflects only the difference in expected (and required) returns between two securities that
results from differences in their risk. However, yield spreads reflect (1) a true risk premium; (2) a
liquidity premium, which reflects the fact that U.S. Treasury bonds are more readily marketable than
most corporate bonds; (3) a call premium because most Treasury bonds are not callable whereas
corporate bonds are; and (4) an expected loss differential, which reflects the probability of loss on
the corporate bonds. As an example of the last point, suppose the yield to maturity on a BBB bond was
6.0% versus 4.8% on government bonds but there was a 5% probability of total default loss on the
corporate bond. In this case, the expected return on the BBB bond would be 0.95(6.0%) + 0.05(0%) = 5.7%
and the yield spread would be 0.9%, not the full 1.2 percentage points difference in “promised” yields
to maturity.

few years. Second, the slope of the line has decreased. In the crisis period of 2009,
investors were both pessimistic and risk-averse; so spreads were quite high. As
noted above, these spreads have subsequently fallen as economic conditions have
slowly improved.
Changes in Ratings
Changes in a firm’s bond rating affect its ability to borrow funds and its cost of
that capital. Rating agencies review outstanding bonds on a periodic basis, occa-
sionally upgrading or downgrading a bond as a result of its issuer’s changed
circumstances. For example, on January 17, 2013, S&P raised the corporate credit
rating from BB+ to BBB−of Fidelity National Information Services Inc., a global
banking and payment technologies provider. S&P’s decision to upgrade the firm’s
credit rating was due to the company’s consistent strong operating results and its
reduced debt levels. On February 28, 2013, S&P lowered the corporate credit
rating from B−to CCC+ of J.C. Penney, a clothing and household goods retailer.
S&P’s decision to downgrade the firm’s credit rating was due to the company’s
weak fourth-quarter results, poor operating margins, and a weak liquidity posi-
tion. The company has shifted its marketing strategy from steady promotions to
everyday low pricing; however, this strategy hurt sales.
Over the long run, rating agencies have done a reasonably good job of
measuring the average credit risk of bonds and of changing ratings whenever
there is a significant change in credit quality. However, it is important to under-
stand that ratings do not adjust immediately to changes in credit quality; and in
some cases, there can be a considerable lag between a change in credit quality and
a change in rating. For example, Enron’s bonds still carried an investment-grade
rating on a Friday in December 2001, but the company declared bankruptcy
2 days later, on Sunday. More recently, the rating agencies have come under
considerable fire for significantly underestimating the risks of many of the securities

that were backed by subprime mortgages. Many worry that rating agencies don’t
have the proper incentives to measure risk because they are paid by the issuing
firms. In response to these concerns, many have called for Congress and the SEC to
reform the rating agencies.21
7-8C BANKRUPTCY AND REORGANIZATION
When a business becomes insolvent, it doesn’t have enough cash to meet its interest
and principal payments. A decision must then be made whether to dissolve the firm
through liquidation or to permit it to reorganize and thus continue to operate. These
issues are addressed in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy statutes,
and the final decision is made by a federal bankruptcy court judge.
The decision to force a firm to liquidate versus permitting it to reorganize
depends on whether the value of the reorganized business is likely to be greater
than the value of its assets if they were sold off piecemeal. In a reorganization,
the firm’s creditors negotiate with management on the terms of a potential
reorganization. The reorganization plan may call for restructuring the debt, in
which case the interest rate may be reduced, the term to maturity lengthened, or
some of the debt may be exchanged for equity. The point of the restructuring is
to reduce the financial charges to a level that is supportable by the firm’s
projected cash flows. Of course, the common stockholders also have to “take a
haircut”—they generally see their position diluted as a result of additional

shares being given to debtholders in exchange for accepting a reduced amount of
debt principal and interest. A trustee may be appointed by the court to oversee
the reorganization, but the existing management generally is allowed to retain
control.
Liquidation occurs if the company is deemed to be worth more “dead” than
“alive.” If the bankruptcy court orders a liquidation, assets are auctioned off and
the cash obtained is distributed as specified in Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act.
Web Appendix 7C provides an illustration of how a firm’s assets are distributed
after liquidation. For now, you should know that (1) the federal bankruptcy
statutes govern reorganization and liquidation, (2) bankruptcies occur frequently,
(3) a priority of the specified claims must be followed when the assets of a
liquidated firm are distributed, (4) bondholders’ treatment depends on the terms
of the bond, and (5) stockholders generally receive little in reorganizations and
nothing in liquidations because the assets are usually worth less than the amount
of debt outstanding.
7-9 BOND MARKETS
Corporate bonds are traded primarily in the over-the-counter market. Most
bonds are owned by and traded among large financial institutions (for example,
life insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds, all
of which deal in very large blocks of securities), and it is relatively easy for over-
the-counter bond dealers to arrange the transfer of large blocks of bonds among
the relatively few holders of the bonds. It would be more difficult to conduct
similar operations in the stock market among the literally millions of large
and small stockholders, so a higher percentage of stock trades occur on the
exchanges.
A number of leading business publications and websites routinely report key
developments in the Treasury, corporate, and municipal bond markets. For
example, The Wall Street Journal provides a list of bonds whose yield spreads
(relative to Treasury securities) widened and narrowed the most in the previous
day. Table 7.5 reprints a portion of this data for a given day in March 2013. The
table also reports the company’s previous day’s stock performance, which
enables an investor to easily see how recent news has affected both the com-
pany’s stock price and the interest rate on its debt. As part of its reported data,
The Wall Street Journal also includes interesting data regarding a number of bond
indices and a snapshot of government bond rates in different countries. Other
helpful sources include the bond sections of Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and
Morningstar.com.

This chapter described the different types of bonds governments and corporations
issue, explained how bond prices are established, and discussed how investors
estimate rates of return on bonds. It also discussed various types of risks that
investors face when they purchase bonds.
ACCRUED INTEREST AND THE PRICING OF COUPON BONDS
In this chapter, we have demonstrated the various factors that
influence bond prices. But in practice, how much you are
willing to pay for a bond also depends on when the next
coupon payment is due. Clearly, all else equal, you would be
willing to pay more for a bond the day before a coupon is
paid, than you would the day after it has been paid. So, if you
purchase a bond between coupon payments, you also have
to pay what is called accrued interest. Accrued interest repre-
sents the amount of interest that has accumulated between
coupon payments, and it can be calculated as follows:
Accrued
interest
Coupon
payment
Number of days since
the last coupon payment
Number of days in
the coupon period
Let’s consider, for example, a corporate bond that was
issued on February 22, 2013. The bond has an 8% semi-
annual coupon and a par value of $1,000—which means six
months later on August 22, 2013, the bond will pay its first
$40 coupon, and on February 22, 2014, it will pay its second
$40 coupon. If you buy the bond on May 11, 2013 (79 days
since the bond’s last coupon payment on February 22), you
will have to pay the seller $17 56 in accrued interest:22
Accrued interest
$40
79 180
$17 56
In most cases, bonds are quoted net of accrued
interest—in what is often referred to as a clean price.
The actual invoice price you pay (often referred to as the
dirty price) is the clean price plus accrued interest. In
the case of the above bond, let’s assume that the bond’s
nominal yield to maturity is the same as it was when the
bond was issued (8%), which means that excluding
accrued interest the bond continues to trade at par. It
follows that:
Clean price quoted price
$1,000
Accrued interest
$17 56
Dirtyprice invoiceprice
Cleanprice
Accrued interest
$1,017 56
You can also use the Accrued Interest function in Excel
(ACCRINT) to easily calculate a bond’s accrued interest.23 As
a final point, in the examples we use in the text, when we
refer to a bond’s price we are referring to the bond’s quoted
or clean price. But you should keep in mind that if you buy
or sell a bond, the actual price paid or received is the dirty
price which includes accrued interest.
S E L F T E S T
Why do most bond trades occur in the over-the-counter market?
How is accrued interest calculated?
What is meant by the terms clean price and dirty price?
22If you look up accrued interest in Yahoo! Finance’s glossary you will see more details regarding the
payment of accrued interest. Most notably, it points out that accrued interest is calculated slightly
differently for corporate and Treasury bonds:
Interest on most bonds and fixed-income securities is paid twice a year. On corporate and
municipal bonds, interest is calculated on 30-day months and a 360-day year. For
government bonds, interest is calculated on actual days and a 365-day year.

When an investor purchases a company’s bonds, the investor is providing the
company with capital. Moreover, when a firm issues bonds, the return that investors
require on the bonds represents the cost of debt capital to the firm. This point is
extended in Chapter 10, where the ideas developed in this chapter are used to help
determine a company’s overall cost of capital, which is a basic component of the
capital budgeting process.
In recent years, many companies have used zero coupon bonds to raise billions
of dollars, while bankruptcy is an important consideration for companies that issue
debt and for investors. These two related issues are discussed in detail in Web
Appendixes 7A and 7C. Duration, a measurement involving a weighted average of
the bond’s cash flows, is discussed in Web Appendix 7B. These appendixes can be
accessed through the textbook’s website.

BOND VALUATION
The Pennington Corporation issued a new series of bonds on January 1,
1990. The bonds were sold at par ($1,000); had a 12% coupon; and mature in 30 years, on
December 31, 2019. Coupon payments are made semiannually (on June 30 and December 31).
a. What was the YTM on January 1, 1990?
b. What was the price of the bonds on January 1, 1995, 5 years later, assuming that interest
rates had fallen to 10%?
c. Find the current yield, capital gains yield, and total return on January 1, 1995, given the
price as determined in Part b.
d. On July 1, 2013, 6½ years before maturity, Pennington’s bonds sold for $916 42. What
were the YTM, the current yield, the capital gains yield, and the total return at that
time?
e. Now assume that you plan to purchase an outstanding Pennington bond on March 1,
2013, when the going rate of interest given its risk was 15 5%. How large a check must
you write to complete the transaction? (This is a difficult question.)

SINKING FUND
The Vancouver Development Company (VDC) is planning to sell a
$100 million, 10-year, 12%, semiannual payment bond issue. Provisions for a sinking fund
to retire the issue over its life will be included in the indenture. Sinking fund payments will
be made at the end of each year, and each payment must be sufficient to retire 10% of the
original amount of the issue. The last sinking fund payment will retire the last of the bonds.
The bonds to be retired each period can be purchased on the open market or obtained by
calling up to 5% of the original issue at par, at VDC’s option.
a. How large must each sinking fund payment be if the company (1) uses the option to call
bonds at par or (2) decides to buy bonds on the open market? For Part (2), you
can only answer in words.
b. What will happen to debt service requirements per year associated with this issue over
its 10-year life?
c. Now consider an alternative plan where VDC sets up its sinking fund so that equal
annual amounts are paid into a sinking fund trust held by a bank, with the proceeds
being used to buy government bonds that are expected to pay 7% annual interest. The
payments, plus accumulated interest, must total $100 million at the end of 10 years,
when the proceeds will be used to retire the issue. How large must the annual sinking
fund payments be? Is this amount known with certainty, or might it be higher or lower?
d. What are the annual cash requirements for covering bond service costs under the
trusteeship arrangement described in Part c? (Note: Interest must be paid on Vancou-
ver’s outstanding bonds but not on bonds that have been retired.) Assume level interest
rates for purposes of answering this question.
e. What would have to happen to interest rates to cause the company to buy bonds on the
open market rather than call them under the plan where some bonds are retired each year?
QUESTIONS
7-1
A sinking fund can be set up in one of two ways:
•
The corporation makes annual payments to the trustee, who invests the proceeds in
securities (frequently government bonds) and uses the accumulated total to retire the
bond issue at maturity.
•
The trustee uses the annual payments to retire a portion of the issue each year, calling a
given percentage of the issue by a lottery and paying a specified price per bond or
buying bonds on the open market, whichever is cheaper.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of each procedure from the viewpoint of the
firm and the bondholders?

The values of outstanding bonds change whenever the going rate of interest changes. In
general, short-term interest rates are more volatile than long-term interest rates. Therefore,
short-term bond prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are long-term bond
prices. Is that statement true or false? Explain. (Hint: Make up a “reasonable” example
based on a 1-year and a 20-year bond to help answer the question.)
7-4
If interest rates rise after a bond issue, what will happen to the bond’s price and YTM? Does
the time to maturity affect the extent to which interest rate changes affect the bond’s price?
(Again, an example might help you answer this question.)
7-5
Discuss the following statement: A bond’s yield to maturity is the bond’s promised rate of
return, which equals its expected rate of return.
7-6
If you buy a callable bond and interest rates decline, will the value of your bond rise by as
much as it would have risen if the bond had not been callable? Explain.

YIELD TO MATURITY AND YIELD TO CALL
Kaufman Enterprises has bonds outstanding
with a $1,000 face value and 10 years left until maturity. They have an 11% annual coupon
payment, and their current price is $1,175. The bonds may be called in 5 years at 109% of

What is the yield to maturity?
b.
What is the yield to call if they are called in 5 years?
c.
Which yield might investors expect to earn on these bonds? Why?
d.
The bond’s indenture indicates that the call provision gives the firm the right to call
the bonds at the end of each year beginning in Year 5. In Year 5, the bonds may be
called at 109% of face value; but in each of the next 4 years, the call percentage will
decline by 1%. Thus, in Year 6, they may be called at 108% of face value; in Year 7, they
may be called at 107% of face value; and so forth. If the yield curve is horizontal
and interest rates remain at their current level, when is the latest that investors might
expect the firm to call the bonds?

Managing Risk in Difficult Times
Over the past few decades, the U.S. stock
market has seen more than its share of ups
and downs. To give you a quick sense of the
market’s recent performance, consider that in
April 1993, the S&P 500 index had a value
around 440. In the following seven years, the
market roared to a high of 1,516. Slightly more
than two years later—following the 2001 terror-
ist attacks and the resulting recession—the
index had lost nearly half of its value. Five
bumpy years later, in September 2007, the
market finally recovered back to where it was
trading near its old highs above 1,500. But
then the housing market collapsed and the
financial crisis began, and by March 2009, the
S&P 500 plunged to a level below 700. A little
more than four years later, in March 2013,
the market once again rebounded to a new
all-time high.
In many cases, the returns on individual
stocks have been even more volatile than the
S&P 500 index. For example, in a recent three
and a half year period, Apple Inc.’s stock rose
more than 450%—from a price below $120 per
share in March 2009 to more than $700 per
share in September 2012. But following this
incredible run-up, the stock’s price subse-
quently plummeted to $420 per share six
months later.
As we see in this chapter, one way to
reduce the risk of investing is to hold a diversi-
fied portfolio of stocks. One approach is to
invest in mutual funds or exchange traded
funds (ETFs) that track the overall market. An
even broader diversification strategy is to invest
in a wide range of global assets including
stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate.
While many U.S. investors are reluctant to invest

in foreign stocks and bonds, many foreign markets have
performed well, and their performance has not been perfectly
correlated with U.S. markets. Therefore, global diversification
offers U.S. investors an opportunity to increase returns and at
the same time reduce risk. To be sure, however, these other
investments can also be quite risky at times.
While many investors are trained to expect some risk, the
huge and dramatic swings we have seen in recent years have
been unnerving to many. Consequently, there has been
increased interest in understanding these extreme price
swings. In his bestselling book, The Black Swan, Professor
Nassim Taleb defines a Black Swan event as:
…a highly improbable event with three principal charac-
teristics. It is unpredictable, it carries a massive impact, and
after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it
appear less random, and more predictable than it was.
Over the past decade, we have had a series of what could be
characterized as Black Swan events—for example, the rise of
Google, the terrorist attacks in 2001, the financial crisis, and
the tsunami disaster in Japan. Arguably, these events have
contributed largely to the high levels of volatility in the overall
stock market.
While diversification is important, the events of the past
decade show all too well that even fully diversified investors
can suffer large losses in short periods of time. As a result,
many have become more conservative with their money and
are holding larger amounts of cash and other safe assets in
their portfolio. Many are convinced that these investors won’t
return to the market unless they are reasonably assured that
the expected returns are enough to justify the risks of stocks
and other more speculative investments.
In this chapter, we explore these ideas in more detail, and
specifically consider the different types of risk that investors
face, the benefits of diversification, and the fundamental
trade-off between risk and return. After studying the concepts
in this chapter, you should be able to avoid some of the
investing pitfalls that a number of investors have faced
recently in their quest for wealth.
Source: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable (New York: Random House, 2007).
We start this chapter from the basic premise that investors like returns and dislike
risk; hence, they will invest in risky assets only if those assets offer higher expected
returns. We define what risk means as it relates to investments, examine proce-
dures that are used to measure risk, and discuss the relationship between risk and
return. Investors should understand these concepts, as should corporate managers
as they develop the plans that will shape their firms’ futures.
Risk can be measured in different ways, and different conclusions about an
asset’s riskiness can be reached depending on the measure used. Risk analysis can
be confusing, but it will help if you keep the following points in mind:
1.
All business assets are expected to produce cash flows, and the riskiness of an
asset is based on the riskiness of its cash flows. The riskier the cash flows, the
riskier the asset.
2.
Assets can be categorized as financial assets, especially stocks and bonds, and
as real assets, such as trucks, machines, and whole businesses. In theory, risk
analysis for all types of assets is similar, and the same fundamental concepts
apply to all assets. However, in practice, differences in the types of available
data lead to different procedures for stocks, bonds, and real assets. Our focus
in this chapter is on financial assets, especially stocks. We considered bonds in
Chapter 7; and we take up real assets in the capital budgeting chapters,
especially Chapter 12.

A stock’s risk can be considered in two ways: (a) on a stand-alone, or single-
stock, basis, or (b) in a portfolio context, where a number of stocks are
combined and their consolidated cash flows are analyzed.1 There is an
important difference between stand-alone and portfolio risk, and a stock that
has a great deal of risk held by itself may be much less risky when held as
part of a larger portfolio.
4.
In a portfolio context, a stock’s risk can be divided into two components:
(a) diversifiable risk, which can be diversified away and is thus of little concern
to diversified investors, and (b) market risk, which reflects the risk of a general
stock market decline and cannot be eliminated by diversification (hence, does
concern investors). Only market risk is relevant to rational investors because
diversifiable risk can and will be eliminated.
5.
A stock with high market risk must offer a relatively high expected rate of
return to attract investors. Investors in general are averse to risk, so they will
not buy risky assets unless they are compensated with high expected returns.
6.
If investors, on average, think a stock’s expected return is too low to
compensate for its risk, they will start selling it, driving down its price and
boosting its expected return. Conversely, if the expected return on a stock is
more than enough to compensate for the risk, people will start buying it,
raising its price and thus lowering its expected return. The stock will be in
equilibrium, with neither buying nor selling pressure, when its expected
return is exactly sufficient to compensate for its risk.
7.
Stand-alone risk, the topic of Section 8-2, is important in stock analysis primarily
as a lead-in to portfolio risk analysis. However, stand-alone risk is extremely
important when analyzing real assets such as capital budgeting projects.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Explain the difference between stand-alone risk and risk in a portfolio
context.
•
Describe how risk aversion affects a stock’s required rate of return.
•
Discuss the difference between diversifiable risk and market risk, and explain
how each type of risk affects well-diversified investors.
•
Describe what the CAPM is and illustrate how it can be used to estimate a
stock’s required rate of return.
•
Discuss how changes in the general stock and bond markets could lead to
changes in the required rate of return on a firm’s stock.
•
Discuss how changes in a firm’s operations might lead to changes in the
required rate of return on the firm’s stock.
8-1 THE RISK-RETURN TRADE-OFF
As we mention above, we start from a very simple premise that investors like returns
and they dislike risk. This premise suggests that there is a fundamental trade-off
between risk and return: to entice investors to take on more risk, you have to provide
them with higher expected returns. This trade-off is illustrated in Figure 8.1.
The slope of the risk-return line in Panel A of Figure 8.1 indicates how much
additional return an individual investor requires in order to take on a higher
level of risk. A steeper line suggests that an investor is very averse to taking on
1A portfolio is a collection of investment securities. If you owned stock in General Motors, Exxon Mobil,
and IBM, you would be holding a three-stock portfolio. Because diversification lowers risk without
sacrificing much, if any, expected return, most stocks are held in portfolios.

risk, whereas a flatter line would suggest that the investor is more comfortable
bearing risk. Not surprisingly, investors who are less comfortable bearing risk
tend to gravitate toward lower-risk investments, while investors with a greater-
risk appetite tend to put more of their money into higher-risk, higher-return
investments. The average investor’s willingness to take on risk also varies over
time. For example, prior to the recent financial crisis, an increasing number of
investors were putting their money into riskier investments that included high-
growth stocks, junk bonds, and emerging market funds. In the aftermath of the
crisis, there was a tremendous “flight to quality” where investors rapidly moved
away from riskier investments and instead flocked toward safer investments
such as Treasury securities and money market funds. At any point in time, an
investor’s goal should be to earn returns that are more than sufficient to com-
pensate for the perceived risk of the investment—in other words, getting above
the risk-return trade-off line illustrated in Panel A of Figure 8.1.
The trade-off between risk and return is also an important concept for com-
panies trying to create value for their shareholders. Panel B of Figure 8.1 suggests
that if a company is investing in riskier projects, it must offer its investors
(both bondholders and stockholders) higher expected returns. As we showed in
Chapter 7, higher-risk companies must pay higher yields on their bonds to
compensate bondholders for the additional default risk. Likewise, as we will see
in this chapter, riskier companies trying to increase their stock price must generate
higher returns to compensate their stockholders for the additional risk. It is
important to understand that the returns that companies have to pay their inves-
tors represent the companies’ costs of obtaining capital. Thus from a company’s
perspective, the risk-return line in Panel B of Figure 8.1 represents its cost
of obtaining capital, and the slope of the risk-return line reflects the average

investor’s current willingness to take on risk. As we will see in Chapters 10
through 12, companies create value by investing in projects where the returns
on the investments exceed their costs of capital. Once again, this translates into
operating above the risk-return trade-off line.
Throughout the rest of this chapter, we discuss these simple ideas in greater
detail. We begin by discussing the concept of risk. Later we discuss returns, and
we provide a model for estimating the trade-off between risk and return.
8-2 STAND-ALONE RISK
Risk is defined by Webster's Dictionary as “a hazard; a peril; exposure to loss or
injury.” Thus, risk refers to the chance that some unfavorable event will occur. If
you engage in skydiving, you are taking a chance with your life—skydiving is
risky. If you bet on the horses, you are risking your money.
As we saw in previous chapters, individuals and firms invest funds today with
the expectation of receiving additional funds in the future. Bonds offer relatively
low returns, but with relatively little risk—at least if you stick to Treasury and high-
grade corporate bonds. Stocks offer the chance of higher returns, but stocks are
generally riskier than bonds. If you invest in speculative stocks (or, really, any
stock), you are taking a significant risk in the hope of making an appreciable return.
An asset’s risk can be analyzed in two ways: (1) on a stand-alone basis, where
the asset is considered by itself, and (2) on a portfolio basis, where the asset is held
as one of a number of assets in a portfolio. Thus, an asset’s stand-alone risk is the
risk an investor would face if he or she held only this one asset. Most financial
assets, and stocks in particular, are held in portfolios; but it is necessary to
understand stand-alone risk to understand risk in a portfolio context.
To illustrate stand-alone risk, suppose an investor buys $100,000 of short-term
Treasury bills with an expected return of 5%. In this case, the investment’s return,
5%, can be estimated quite precisely; and the investment is defined as being essen-
tially risk-free. This same investor could also invest the $100,000 in the stock of a
company just being organized to prospect for oil in the mid-Atlantic. Returns on the
stock would be much harder to predict. In the worst case, the company would go
bankrupt and the investor would lose all of his or her money, in which case the
return would be −100%. In the best-case scenario, the company would discover
huge amounts of oil and the investor would receive a 1,000% return. When evaluat-
ing this investment, the investor might analyze the situation and conclude that the
expected rate of return, in a statistical sense, is 20%; but the actual rate of return could
range from, say,
1,000% to −100%. Because there is a significant danger of earning
much less than the expected return, such a stock would be relatively risky.
No investment should be undertaken unless the expected rate of return is high enough to
compensate for the perceived risk. In our example, it is clear that few if any investors
would be willing to buy the oil exploration stock if its expected return didn’t exceed
that of the T-bill. This is an extreme example. Generally, things are much less

obvious, and we need to measure risk in order to decide whether a potential
investment should be undertaken. Therefore, we need to define risk more precisely.
As you will see, the risk of an asset is different when the asset is held by itself
versus when it is held as a part of a group, or portfolio, of assets. We look at stand-
alone risk in this section, and then at portfolio risk in later sections. It’s necessary
to know something about stand-alone risk in order to understand portfolio risk.
Also, stand-alone risk is important to the owners of small businesses and in our
examination of physical assets in the capital budgeting chapters. For stocks and
most financial assets, though, it is portfolio risk that is most important. Still, you
need to understand the key elements of both types of risk.
8-2A STATISTICAL MEASURES OF STAND-ALONE RISK
This is not a statistics book, and we won’t spend a great deal of time on statistics.
However, you do need an intuitive understanding of the relatively simple statis-
tics presented in this section. All of the calculations can be done easily with a
calculator or with Excel; and while we show pictures of the Excel setup, Excel is
not needed for the calculations.
Here are the five key items that are covered:
•
Probability distributions
•
Expected rates of return, r^ (“r hat”)
•
Historical, or past realized, rates of return, r (“r bar”)
•
Standard deviation,
(sigma)
•
Coefficient of variation (CV)
Table 8.1 gives the probability distributions for Martin Products, which makes
engines for long-haul trucks (18-wheelers), and for U.S. Water, which supplies an
essential product and thus has very stable sales and profits. Three possible states of the
economy are shown in Column 1; and the probabilities of these outcomes, expressed
as decimals rather than percentages, are given in Column 2 and then repeated
in Column 5. There is a 30% chance of a strong economy and thus strong demand,
a 40% probability of normal demand, and a 30% probability of weak demand.
Columns 3 and 6 show the returns for the two companies under each state of
the economy. Returns are relatively high when demand is strong and low when
demand is weak. Notice, though, that Martin’s rate of return could vary far more
widely than U.S. Water’s. Indeed, there is a fairly high probability that Martin’s
stock will suffer a 60% loss, while at worst, U.S. Water should have a 5% return.2

Columns 4 and 7 show the products of the probabilities times the returns
under the different demand levels. When we sum these products, we obtain the
expected rate of return, r (“r-hat”), for each stock. Both stocks have an expected
return of 10%.3
We can graph the data in Table 8.1 as shown in Figure 8.2. The height of each
bar indicates the probability that a given outcome will occur. The range of possible
returns for Martin is from −60% to
80%, and the expected return is 10%. The
expected return for U.S. Water is also 10%, but its possible range (and thus
maximum loss) is much narrower.
In Figure 8.2, we assumed that only three economic states could occur: strong,
normal, and weak. Actually, the economy can range from a deep depression to a
fantastic boom; and there are an unlimited number of possibilities in between.
Suppose we had the time and patience to assign a probability to each possible
level of demand (with the sum of the probabilities still equaling 1 0) and to assign
a rate of return to each stock for each level of demand. We would have a table
similar to Table 8.1 except that it would have many more demand levels. This
table could be used to calculate expected rates of return as shown previously, and

the probabilities and outcomes could be represented by continuous curves such as
those shown in Figure 8.3. Here we changed the assumptions so that there is
essentially no chance that Martin’s return will be less than −60% or more than 80%
or that U.S. Water’s return will be less than 5% or more than 15%. However,
virtually any return within these limits is possible.
The tighter (or more peaked) the probability distributions, the more likely the
actual outcome will be close to the expected value and, consequently, the less
likely the actual return will end up far below the expected return. Thus, the tighter
the probability distribution, the lower the risk. As shown in Figure 8.3, because
U.S. Water has a relatively tight distribution, its actual return is likely to be closer
to its 10% expected return than is true for Martin; so U.S. Water is less risky.4
8-2B MEASURING STAND-ALONE RISK: THE STANDARD
DEVIATION 5
It is useful to measure risk for comparative purposes, but risk can be defined and
measured in several ways. A common definition that is satisfactory for our
purpose is based on probability distributions such as those shown in Figure 8.3:
The tighter the probability distribution of expected future returns, the smaller the risk of a

Note: The assumptions regarding the probabilities of various outcomes have been changed from those in Figure 8.2. There the probability of obtaining
exactly 10% was 40%; here it is much smaller because there are many possible outcomes instead of just three. With continuous distributions, it is more
appropriate to ask what the probability is of obtaining at least some specified rate of return than to ask what the probability is of obtaining exactly that
rate. This topic is covered in detail in statistics courses.
4In this example, we implicitly assume that the state of the economy is the only factor that affects
returns. In reality, many factors, including labor, materials, and development costs, influence returns.
This is discussed at greater length in the chapters on capital budgeting.
5This section is relatively technical, but it can be omitted without loss of continuity.

given investment. According to this definition, U.S. Water is less risky than Martin
Products because there is a smaller chance that the actual return of U.S. Water will
end up far below its expected return.
We can use the standard deviation ( , pronounced “sigma”) to quantify the
tightness of the probability distribution.6 The smaller the standard deviation,
the tighter the probability distribution and, accordingly, the lower the risk. We
calculate Martin’s
in Table 8.2. We picked up Columns 1, 2, and 3 from Table 8.1.
Then in Column 4, we find the deviation of the return in each demand state
from the expected return: Actual return −Expected 10% return. The deviations
are squared and shown in Column 5. Each squared deviation is then multiplied
by the relevant probability and shown in Column 6. The sum of the products in
Column 6 is the variance of the distribution. Finally, we find the square root of the
variance—this is the standard deviation, and it is shown at the bottom of Column 6
both as a fraction and a percentage.7
The standard deviation,
, is a measure of how far the actual return is likely to
deviate from the expected return. Martin’s standard deviation is 54 22%, so its actual
return is likely to be quite different from the expected 10%.8 U.S. Water’s standard
deviation is 3 87%, so its actual return should be much closer to the expected return
of 10%. The average publicly traded firm’s
has been in the range of 20% to 30% in
recent years; so Martin is more risky than most stocks, while U.S. Water is less risky.

6There are actually two types of standard deviations, one for complete distributions and one for
situations that involve only a sample. Different formulas and notations are used. Also, the standard
deviation should be modified if the distribution is not normal, or bell-shaped. Because our purpose is
simply to get the general idea across, we leave the refinements to advanced finance and statistics
courses.

Table 8.3.10 Because past results are often repeated in the future, the histor-
ical
is often used as an estimate of future risk.11 A key question that arises
when historical data is used to forecast the future is how far back in time we
should go. Unfortunately, there is no simple answer. Using a longer histor-
ical time series has the benefit of giving more information, but some of that
information may be misleading if you believe that the level of risk in the
future is likely to be very different from the level of risk in the past.
All financial calculators (and Excel) have easy-to-use functions for finding
based on historical data.12 Simply enter the rates of return and press the key
marked S (or Sx) to obtain the standard deviation. However, neither calculators
nor Excel have a built-in formula for finding
where probabilistic data are
involved. In those cases, you must go through the process outlined in Table 8.2.
8-2D MEASURING STAND-ALONE RISK: THE COEFFICIENT
OF VARIATION
If a choice has to be made between two investments that have the same expected
returns but different standard deviations, most people would choose the one with
the lower standard deviation and, therefore, the lower risk. Similarly, given a
choice between two investments with the same risk (standard deviation) but
different expected returns, investors would generally prefer the investment
with the higher expected return. To most people, this is common sense—return

Based on Historical Data
© Cengage Learning 2015
10The 4 years of historical data are considered to be a “sample” of the full (but unknown) set of data,
and the procedure used to find the standard deviation is different from the one used for probabilistic
data. Here is the equation for sample data, and it is the basis for Table 8.3:

Here r−t (“r bar t”) denotes the past realized rate of return in Period t, and r−Avg is the average annual
return earned over the last N years.
11The average return for the past period (10.3% in our example) may also be used as an estimate of
future returns, but this is problematic because the average historical return varies widely depending on
the period examined. In our example, if we went from 2011 to 2013, we would get a different average
from the 10.3%. The average historical return stabilizes with more years of data, but that brings into
question whether data from many years ago are still relevant today.

historical standard deviations.

is “good” and risk is “bad”; consequently, investors want as much return and
as little risk as possible. But how do we choose between two investments if one
has the higher expected return but the other has the lower standard deviation? To
help answer that question, we use another measure of risk, the coefficient of
variation (CV), which is the standard deviation divided by the expected return:
Coefficient of variation
CV
r
8.3
The coefficient of variation shows the risk per unit of return, and it provides a more
meaningful risk measure when the expected returns on two alternatives are not the
same. Because U.S. Water and Martin Products have the same expected return,
the coefficient of variation is not necessary in this case. In this example, the firm
with the larger standard deviation, Martin, must also have the larger coefficient of
variation. In fact, the coefficient of variation for Martin is 54 22 10
5 42 and
the coefficient of variation for U.S. Water is 3 87 10
0 39. Thus, Martin is about
14 times riskier than U.S. Water on the basis of this criterion.
8-2E RISK AVERSION AND REQUIRED RETURNS
Suppose you inherited $1 million, which you plan to invest and then retire on
the income. You can buy a 5% U.S. Treasury bill, and you will be sure of
earning $50,000 of interest. Alternatively, you can buy stock in R&D Enter-
prises. If R&D’s research programs are successful, your stock will increase to
$2 1 million. However, if the research is a failure, the value of your stock will
be zero and you will be penniless. You regard R&D’s chances of success or
failure as 50 50, so the expected value of the stock a year from now is
0 5 $0
0 5 $2,100,000
$1,050,000. Subtracting the $1 million cost leaves
an expected $50,000 profit and a 5% rate of return, the same as for the T-bill:
Expected rate of return
Expected ending value −Cost
Cost
$1,050,000 −$1,000,000
$1,000,000
$50,000
$1,000,000
5%
Given the choice of the sure $50,000 profit (and 5% rate of return) and the
risky expected $50,000 profit and 5% return, which one would you choose? If you
choose the less risky investment, you are risk-averse. Most investors are risk-averse, and
certainly the average investor is with regard to his or her “serious money.” Because this is
a well-documented fact, we assume risk aversion in our discussions throughout the
remainder of the book.
What are the implications of risk aversion for security prices and rates of
return? The answer is that, other things held constant, the higher a security’s risk, the
higher its required return; and if this situation does not hold, prices will change to bring
about the required condition. To illustrate this point, look back at Figure 8.3 and
consider again the U.S. Water and Martin Products stocks. Suppose each stock
sells for $100 per share and each has an expected rate of return of 10%. Investors
are averse to risk; so under those conditions, there would be a general preference
for U.S. Water. People with money to invest would bid for U.S. Water, and
Martin’s stockholders would want to sell and use the money to buy U.S. Water.
Buying pressure would quickly drive U.S. Water’s stock price up, and selling
pressure would simultaneously cause Martin’s price to fall.
These price changes, in turn, would change the expected returns of the two
securities. Suppose, for example, that U.S. Water’s stock price was bid up from
$100 to $125 and Martin’s stock price declined from $100 to $77. These price
changes would cause U.S. Water’s expected return to fall to 8% and Martin’s

5%, would be a risk
premium (RP), which represents the additional compensation investors require
for bearing Martin’s higher risk.
This example demonstrates a very important principle: In a market dominated
by risk-averse investors, riskier securities compared to less risky securities must have
higher expected returns as estimated by the marginal investor. If this situation does not
exist, buying and selling will occur until it does exist. Later in the chapter we will
consider the question of how much higher the returns on risky securities must be,
after we see how diversification affects the way risk should be measured.
THE HISTORICAL TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RISK AND RETURN
The table accompanying this box summarizes the histor-
ical trade-off between risk and return for different classes
of investments from 1926 through 2012. As the table
shows, those assets that produced the highest average
returns also had the highest standard deviations and the
widest ranges of returns. For example, small-company
stocks had the highest average annual return, 16 5%,
but the standard deviation of their returns, 32 3%, was
also the highest. By contrast, U.S. Treasury bills had the
lowest standard deviation, 3 1%, but they also had the
lowest average return, 3 6%. While there is no guarantee
that history will repeat itself, the returns and standard
deviations observed in the past are often used as a start-
ing point for estimating future returns.

What does investment risk mean?
Set up an illustrative probability distribution table for an investment with probabil-
ities for different conditions, returns under those conditions, and the expected return.
Which of the two stocks graphed in Figure 8.3 is less risky? Why?
Explain why you agree or disagree with this statement: Most investors are risk-averse.
How does risk aversion affect rates of return?
An investment has a 50% chance of producing a 20% return, a 25% chance of
producing an 8% return, and a 25% chance of producing a −12% return. What is its
expected return? (9%)
13We assume that each stock is expected to pay shareholders $10 a year in perpetuity. The price of
this perpetuity can be found by dividing the annual cash flow by the stock’s return. Thus, if the
stock’s expected return is 10%, the price must be $10/0.10 = $100. Likewise, an 8% expected return
would be consistent with a $125 stock price ($10/0.08 = $125) and a 13% return with a $77 stock price
($10/0.13 = $77).

8-3 RISK IN A PORTFOLIO CONTEXT: THE CAPM
In this section, we discuss the risk of stocks when they are held in portfolios rather
than as stand-alone assets. Our discussion is based on an extremely important
theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, that was developed in the
1960s.14 We do not attempt to cover the CAPM in detail—rather, we simply use its
intuition to explain how risk should be considered in a world where stocks and
other assets are held in portfolios. If you go on to take a course in investments, you
will cover the CAPM in detail.
Thus far in the chapter we have considered the riskiness of assets when they
are held in isolation. This is generally appropriate for small businesses, many real
estate investments, and capital budgeting projects. However, the risk of a stock
held in a portfolio is typically lower than the stock’s risk when it is held alone.
Because investors dislike risk and because risk can be reduced by holding portfo-
lios, most stocks are held in portfolios. Banks, pension funds, insurance compa-
nies, mutual funds, and other financial institutions are required by law to hold
diversified portfolios. Most individual investors—at least those whose security
holdings constitute a significant part of their total wealth—also hold portfolios.
Therefore, the fact that one particular stock’s price increases or decreases is not
important—what is important is the return on the portfolio and the portfolio’s risk.
Logically, then, the risk and return of an individual stock should be analyzed in terms of
how the security affects the risk and return of the portfolio in which it is held.
To illustrate, Pay Up Inc. is a collection agency that operates nationwide
through 37 offices. The company is not well known, its stock is not very liquid,
and its earnings have experienced sharp fluctuations in the past. This suggests that
Pay Up is risky and that its required rate of return, r, should be relatively high.
However, Pay Up’s required return in 2014 (and all other years) was quite low in
comparison to most other companies. This indicates that investors think Pay Up is
a low-risk company in spite of its uncertain profits. This counterintuitive finding has
to do with diversification and its effect on risk. Pay Up’s earnings rise during reces-
sions, whereas most other companies’ earnings decline when the economy
slumps. Thus, Pay Up’s stock is like insurance—it pays off when other invest-
ments go bad—so adding Pay Up to a portfolio of “regular” stocks stabilizes the
portfolio’s returns and makes it less risky.
8-3A EXPECTED PORTFOLIO RETURNS, rp
The expected return on a portfolio, rp, is the weighted average of the expected
returns of the individual assets in the portfolio, with the weights being the
percentage of the total portfolio invested in each asset:
rp
w1r1
w2r2
wNrN

Here ri is the expected return on the ith stock; the wi’s are the stocks’ weights, or
the percentage of the total value of the portfolio invested in each stock; and N is
the number of stocks in the portfolio.
Table 8.4 can be used to implement the equation. Here we assume that an
analyst estimated returns on the four stocks shown in Column 1 for the coming
year, as shown in Column 2. Suppose further that you had $100,000 and you
planned to invest $25,000, or 25% of the total, in each stock. You could multiply

14The CAPM was originated by Professor William F. Sharpe in his article “Capital Asset Prices:
A Theory of Market Equilibrium Under Conditions of Risk,” Journal of Finance, vol. 19, no. 3 (1964),
pp. 425–442. Literally thousands of articles exploring various aspects of the CAPM have been
published subsequently, and it is very widely used in investment analysis.

each stock’s percentage weight as shown in Column 4 by its expected return;
obtain the product terms in Column 5; and then sum Column 5 to calculate the
expected portfolio return, 8 20%.
If you added a fifth stock with a higher expected return, the portfolio’s
expected return would increase, and vice versa if you added a stock with a lower
expected return. The key point to remember is that the expected return on a portfolio is a
weighted average of expected returns on the stocks in the portfolio.
Several additional points should be made:
1.
The expected returns in Column 2 would be based on a study of some type,
but they would still be essentially subjective and judgmental because different
analysts could look at the same data and reach different conclusions.
Therefore, this type of analysis must be viewed with a critical eye.
Nevertheless, it is useful, indeed necessary, if one is to make intelligent
investment decisions.
2.
If we added companies such as Delta Airlines and GM, which are generally
considered to be relatively risky, their expected returns as estimated by the
marginal investor would be relatively high; otherwise, investors would sell
them, drive down their prices, and force the expected returns above the
returns on safer stocks.
3.
After the fact and a year later, the actual realized rates of return, ri, on the
individual stocks—the ri, or “r-bar,” values—would almost certainly be
different from the initial expected values. That would cause the portfolio’s
actual return, rp, to differ from the expected return, rp
8 20%. For example,
Microsoft’s price might double and thus provide a return of
100%, whereas
IBM might have a terrible year, fall sharply, and have a return of −75%. Note,
though, that those two events would be offsetting; so the portfolio’s return still
might be close to its expected return even though the returns on the individual
stocks were far from their expected values.
8-3B PORTFOLIO RISK
Although the expected return on a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the
expected returns on its individual stocks, the portfolio’s risk,
p, is not the
weighted average of the individual stocks’ standard deviations. The portfolio’s
risk is generally smaller than the average of the stocks’
s because diversification
lowers the portfolio’s risk.
To illustrate this point, consider the situation in Figure 8.4. The bottom section
gives data on Stocks W and M individually and data on a portfolio with 50% in
each stock. The left graph plots the data in a time series format, and it shows that
the returns on the individual stocks vary widely from year to year. Therefore, the
individual stocks are risky. However, the portfolio’s returns are constant at 15%,

indicating that it is not risky at all. The probability distribution graphs to the right
show the same thing—the two stocks would be quite risky if they were held in
isolation; but when they are combined to form Portfolio WM, they have no risk
whatsoever.
If you invested all of your money in Stock W, you would have an expected
return of 15%, but you would face a great deal of risk. The same thing would hold
if you invested entirely in Stock M. However, if you invested 50% in each stock,
you would have the same expected return of 15%, but with no risk whatsoever.
Being rational and averse to risk, you and all other rational investors would
choose to hold the portfolio, not the stocks individually.
Stocks W and M can be combined to form a riskless portfolio because
their returns move countercyclically to each other—when W’s fall, M’s rise, and
vice versa. The tendency of two variables to move together is called correlation,
and the correlation coefficient,
(pronounced “rho”), measures this tendency.15

In statistical terms, we say that the returns on Stocks W and M are perfectly
negatively correlated, with
1 0. The opposite of perfect negative correlation
is perfect positive correlation, with
1 0. If returns are not related to one another
at all, they are said to be independent and
0.
The returns on two perfectly positively correlated stocks with the same
expected return would move up and down together, and a portfolio consisting of
these stocks would be exactly as risky as the individual stocks. If we drew a graph
like Figure 8.4, we would see just one line because the two stocks and the portfolio
would have the same return at each point in time. Thus, diversification is completely
useless for reducing risk if the stocks in the portfolio are perfectly positively correlated.
We see then that when stocks are perfectly negatively correlated
1 0 ,
all risk can be diversified away; but when stocks are perfectly positively correlated
1 0 , diversification does no good. In reality, most stocks are positively
correlated but not perfectly so. Past studies have estimated that on average, the
correlation coefficient between the returns of two randomly selected stocks is
about 0.30.16 Under this condition, combining stocks into portfolios reduces risk but
does not completely eliminate it.17 Figure 8.5 illustrates this point using two stocks

16A study by Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok (1999) estimated that the average correlation coefficient
between two randomly selected stocks was 0.28, while the average correlation coefficient between two
large-company stocks was 0.33. The time period of their sample was 1968 to 1998. See Louis K. C. Chan,
Jason Karceski, and Josef Lakonishok, “On Portfolio Optimization: Forecasting Covariance and Choosing
the Risk Model,” The Review of Financial Studies, vol. 12, no. 5 (Winter 1999), pp. 937–974.

not many stocks with

whose correlation coefficient is
0 35. The portfolio’s average return is 15%,
which is the same as the average return for the two stocks; but its standard
deviation is 18 62%, which is below the stocks’ standard deviations and their
average
. Again, a rational, risk-averse investor would be better off holding the
portfolio rather than just one of the individual stocks.
In our examples, we considered portfolios with only two stocks. What would
happen if we increased the number of stocks in the portfolio? As a rule, on average,
portfolio risk declines as the number of stocks in a portfolio increases.
If we added enough partially correlated stocks, could we completely eliminate
risk? In general, the answer is no. For an illustration, see Figure 8.6 which shows
that a portfolio’s risk declines as stocks are added. Here are some points to keep in
mind about the figure:
1.
The portfolio’s risk declines as stocks are added, but at a decreasing rate; and
once 40 to 50 stocks are in the portfolio, additional stocks do little to reduce risk.
2.
The portfolio’s total risk can be divided into two parts, diversifiable risk and
market risk. Diversifiable risk is the risk that is eliminated by adding stocks.
Market risk is the risk that remains even if the portfolio holds every stock in
the market.

Diversifiable risk is caused by such random, unsystematic events as lawsuits,
strikes, successful and unsuccessful marketing and R&D programs, the
winning or losing of a major contract, and other events that are unique
to the particular firm. Because these events are random, their effects on
a portfolio can be eliminated by diversification—bad events for one firm
will be offset by good events for another. Market risk, on the other hand,
stems from factors that systematically affect most firms: war, inflation,
recessions, high interest rates, and other macro factors. Because most
stocks are affected by macro factors, market risk cannot be eliminated by
diversification.

If we carefully selected the stocks included in the portfolio rather than
adding them randomly, the graph would change. In particular, if we chose
ADDING MORE STOCKS DOESN’T ALWAYS REDUCE THE
RISK OF YOUR PORTFOLIO
While Figure 8.6 illustrates the importance of diversification,
it is important to realize that in some cases adding more
stocks to your portfolio does not always reduce risk. In fact,
in some cases, it can even increase risk. To understand why
this is so, assume that the first stock you randomly select for
your portfolio is a very safe utility firm, but the second stock
you randomly select for your portfolio is a very risky bio-
technology firm. In this case, your two-stock portfolio is
likely to have more risk, even though you are realizing some
benefits from diversification.
A recent article in The Wall Street Journal sheds more light
on this issue. The article discusses some recent research by
Professor Don Chance of Louisiana State University. Profes-
sor Chance conducted a classroom study where he asked
students to first select a stock for their portfolio, and then to
keep adding stocks until they had a portfolio of 30 stocks.
Here’s a summary of his findings:
Prof. Chance wanted to prove to his students that
diversification works. On average, for the group as a
whole, diversifying from one stock to 20 cut the riski-
ness of portfolios by roughly 40%, just as the research
predicted. “It was like a magic trick,” says Prof. Chance.
“The classes produced the exact same graph that’s in
their textbook.”
But then Prof. Chance went back and analyzed the
results student by student, and found that diversification
failed remarkably often. As they broadened their holdings
from a single stock to a basket of 30, many of the stu-
dents raised their risk instead of lowering it. One in nine
times, they ended up with 30-stock portfolios that were
riskier than the single company they had started with. For
23%, the final 30-stock basket fluctuated more than it had
with only five stocks in it.
The lesson: For any given investor, the averages
mightn’t apply. “We send this message out that you
don’t need that many stocks to diversify,” says Prof.
Chance, “but that’s just not true.” What accounts for
these odd results?
Leave it to a professor called Chance to show that
even a random process produces seemingly unlikely
outliers. Thirteen percent of the time, a 20-stock port-
folio generated by computer will be riskier than a one-
stock portfolio.
Also note that if instead of randomly adding stocks to
your portfolio, you keep adding the same types of stocks (for
example, all technology stocks or all financial stocks) to your
portfolio then the benefits of diversification will be consid-
erably less dramatic. Keep in mind, however, the larger
point. On average, you will have a hard time reducing risk
if you only hold a small number of stocks in your portfolio.
With this point in mind, many analysts recommend that
individual investors invest in index funds that provide exten-
sive diversification with low transactions costs. Echoing this
argument, The Wall Street Journal article concludes by offer-
ing the following observation and recommendation:
According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer
Finances, 84% of households that own shares directly
have no more than nine stocks; 36% hold shares in only
a single company.
That’s way too few. But 30 or 40 isn’t enough either. If
you want to pick stocks directly, put 90% to 95% of your
money in a total stock-market index fund, which will give
you a stake in thousands of companies at low cost. Put
the rest in three to five stocks, at most, that you can
follow closely and hold patiently. Beyond a handful, more
companies may well leave you less diversified.
You should note that Figure 8.6 shows what happens on
average if you randomly add more stocks to your portfolio.
But while the picture shows what happens on average, there
is certainly no guarantee that every time you add stocks to
your portfolio that the portfolio’s risk will decline.

stocks with low correlations with one another and with low stand-alone
risk, the portfolio’s risk would decline faster than if random stocks were
added. The reverse would hold if we added stocks with high correlations and
high
s.
5.
Most investors are rational in the sense that they dislike risk, other things held
constant. That being the case, why would an investor ever hold one (or a few)
stocks? Why not hold a market portfolio consisting of all stocks? There are
several reasons. First, high administrative costs and commissions would more
than offset the benefits for individual investors. Second, index funds can be
used by investors for diversification, and many individuals can and do get
broad diversification through these funds. Third, some people think they can
pick stocks that will “beat the market”; so they buy them rather than the broad
market. And fourth, some people can, through superior analysis, beat the
market; so they find and buy undervalued stocks and sell overvalued ones
and, in the process, cause most stocks to be properly valued, with their
expected returns consistent with their risks.
6.
One key question remains: How should the risk of an individual stock be
measured? The standard deviation of expected returns,
, is not appropriate
because it includes risk that can be eliminated by holding the stock in a
portfolio. How then should we measure a stock’s risk in a world where most
people hold portfolios? That’s the subject of the next section.
8-3C RISK IN A PORTFOLIO CONTEXT: THE BETA COEFFICIENT
When a stock is held by itself, its risk can be measured by the standard deviation
of its expected returns. However,
is not appropriate when the stock is held in a
portfolio, as stocks generally are. So how do we measure a stock’s relevant risk in
a portfolio context?
First, note that all risk except that related to broad market movements can and
will be diversified away by most investors—rational investors will hold enough
stocks to move down the risk curve in Figure 8.6 to the point where only market
risk remains in their portfolios.
The risk that remains once a stock is in a diversified portfolio is its contribution to the
portfolio’s market risk, and that risk can be measured by the extent to which the stock
moves up or down with the market.
The tendency of a stock to move with the market is measured by its beta
coefficient, b. Ideally, when estimating a stock’s beta, we would like to have a
crystal ball that tells us how the stock is going to move relative to the overall
stock market in the future. But because we can’t look into the future, we often
use historical data and assume that the stock’s historical beta will give us
a reasonable estimate of how the stock will move relative to the market in
the future.
To illustrate the use of historical data, consider Figure 8.7, which shows
the historical returns on three stocks and a market index. In Year 1, “the
market,” as defined by a portfolio containing all stocks, had a total return
(dividend yield plus capital gains yield) of 10%, as did the three individual
stocks. In Year 2, the market went up sharply and its return was 20%. Stocks
H (for high) soared to 30%; A (for average) returned 20%, the same as the
market; and L (for low) returned 15%. In Year 3, the market dropped sharply;
its return was
10%. The three stocks’ returns also fell—H’s return was
30%,
A’s was
10%, and L broke even with a 0% return. In Years 4 and 5, the
market returned 0% and 5%, respectively, and the three stocks’ returns were as
shown in the figure.

A plot of the data shows that the three stocks moved up or down with the
market but that H was twice as volatile as the market, A was exactly as volatile
as the market, and L had only half the market’s volatility. It is apparent that
the steeper the line, the greater the stock’s volatility and thus the larger its loss in a
down market. The slopes of the lines are the stocks’ beta coefficients. We see in the
figure that the slope coefficient for H is 2 0; for A, it is 1 0; and for L, it is 0 5.18
Thus, beta measures a given stock’s volatility relative to the market, and an
average stock’s beta, bA
1 0.
Stock A is defined as an average-risk stock because it has a beta of b
1 0
and thus moves up and down in step with the general market. Thus, an
average stock will, in general, move up by 10% when the market moves up
by 10% and fall by 10% when the market falls by 10%. A large portfolio of
such b
1 0 stocks would (1) have all of its diversifiable risk removed but
(2) would still move up and down with the broad market averages and thus
have a degree of risk.
Stock H, which has b
2 0, is twice as volatile as an average stock, which
means that it is twice as risky. The value of a portfolio consisting of b
2 0 stocks
could double—or halve—in a short time; and if you held such a portfolio, you
could quickly go from being a millionaire to being a pauper. Stock L, on the other
hand, with b
0 5, is only half as volatile as the average stock, and a portfolio of
such stocks would rise and fall only half as rapidly as the market. Thus, its risk
would be half that of an average-risk portfolio with b
1 0.
Betas for literally thousands of companies are calculated and published by
Value Line, Yahoo!, Google, and numerous other organizations; and the beta
coefficients of some well-known companies are shown in Table 8.5. Most
stocks have betas in the range of 0 50 to 1 50; and the average beta for all
stocks is 1 0, which indicates that the average stock moves in sync with the
market.19

If a stock whose beta is greater than 1 0 (say 1 5) is added to a bp
1 0
portfolio, the portfolio’s beta and consequently its risk will increase. Conver-
sely, if a stock whose beta is less than 1 0 is added to a bp
1 0 portfolio, the
portfolio’s beta and risk will decline. Thus, because a stock’s beta reflects its
contribution to the riskiness of a portfolio, beta is the theoretically correct measure
of the stock’s riskiness.
We can summarize our discussion up to this point as follows:
1.
A stock’s risk has two components, diversifiable risk and market risk.
2.
Diversifiable risk can be eliminated; and most investors do eliminate it,
either by holding very large portfolios or by buying shares in a mutual
fund. We are left, then, with market risk, which is caused by general
movements in the stock market and reflects the fact that most stocks are
systematically affected by events such as wars, recessions, and inflation.
Market risk is the only risk that should matter to a rational, diversified
investor.
3.
Investors must be compensated for bearing risk—the greater the risk of a
stock, the higher its required return. However, compensation is required only
for risk that cannot be eliminated by diversification. If risk premiums existed
on a stock due to its diversifiable risk, that stock would be a bargain to well-
diversified investors. They would start buying it and bid up its price, and the
stock’s final (equilibrium) price would be consistent with an expected return
that reflected only its market risk.
To illustrate this point, suppose half of Stock B’s risk is market risk (it
occurs because the stock moves up and down with the market), while the
other half is diversifiable. You are thinking of buying Stock B and holding
it in a one-stock portfolio, so you would be exposed to all of its risk.
As compensation for bearing so much risk, you want a risk premium of 8%
over the 6% T-bond rate; so your required return is rB
6%
8%
14%.
But other investors, including your professor, are well diversified. They are
also looking at Stock B; but they would hold it in diversified portfolios,
eliminate its diversifiable risk, and thus be exposed to only half as much
risk as you are. Therefore, their required risk premium would be half as
large as yours, and their required rate of return would be
rB
6%
4%
10%.
If the stock was priced to yield the 14% you require, those diversified
investors, including your professor, would buy it, push its price up and its
yield down, and prevent you from purchasing the stock at a price low enough
to provide the 14% return. In the end, you would have to accept a 10% return
or keep your money in the bank.
4.
The market risk of a stock is measured by its beta coefficient, which is an index
of the stock’s relative volatility. Here are some benchmark betas:
b
0 5: Stock is only half as volatile, or risky, as an average stock.
b
1 0: Stock is of average risk.
b
2 0: Stock is twice as risky as an average stock.
5.
A portfolio consisting of low-beta stocks will also have a low beta because the
beta of a portfolio is a weighted average of its individual securities’ betas,
found using this equation:
bp
w1b1
w2b2
wNbN
N
i

Here bp is the beta of the portfolio, and it shows how volatile the portfolio
is relative to the market; wi is the fraction of the portfolio invested in the

ith stock; and bi is the beta coefficient of the ith stock. To illustrate, if an
investor holds a $100,000 portfolio consisting of $33,333 33 invested in each
of three stocks and if each of the stocks has a beta of 0 70, the portfolio’s
beta will be bp
0 70:
bp
0 333 0 70
0 333 0 70
0 333 0 70
0 70
Such a portfolio would be less risky than the market, so it should
experience relatively narrow price swings and have relatively small
rate-of-return fluctuations. In terms of Figure 8.7, the slope of its regression
line would be 0 70, which is less than that for a portfolio of average
stocks.
Now suppose one of the existing stocks is sold and replaced by a stock with
bi
2 00. This action will increase the portfolio’s beta from bp1
0 70 to
bp2
1 13:
bp2
0 333 0 70
0 333 0 70
0 333 2 00
1 13
Had a stock with bi
0 20 been added, the portfolio’s beta would have
declined from 0 70 to 0 53. Adding a low-beta stock would therefore reduce
the portfolio’s riskiness. Consequently, changing the stocks in a portfolio can
change the riskiness of that portfolio.
6.
Because a stock’s beta coefficient determines how the stock affects the
riskiness of a diversified portfolio, beta is, in theory, the most relevant
measure of a stock’s risk.
Q U E S T I O N :
Portfolio P consists of two stocks: 50% is invested in Stock A and 50% is invested in Stock B.
Stock A has a standard deviation of 25% and a beta of 1 2, while Stock B has a standard
deviation of 35% and a beta of 0 80. The correlation between these stocks is 0 4.
a. What is the standard deviation of Portfolio P?
1.
Less than 30%
2.
30%
3.
More than 30%
b. What is the beta of Portfolio P?
c. Which stock is riskier to a diversified investor?
A N S W E R :
a. No calculation is needed to answer this question. Remember that the standard
deviation of a portfolio of two stocks is less than the weighted average of the individual
stocks’ standard deviations, as long as the correlation between the stocks is less than 1 0.
So, in this case because the correlation is 0 4, we know that the standard deviation of
Portfolio P is less than 30%.
b. bp
0 5 1 2
0 5 0 8
bp
1 0.
The beta of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average of the individual stocks’ betas.
c. The relevant measure of risk to a diversified investor is beta. It follows that a diversified
investor would view the higher beta stock (Stock A) as being more risky.

The Benefits of Diversifying Overseas
The increasing availability of international securities is mak-
ing it possible to achieve a better risk-return trade-off than
could be obtained by investing only in U.S. securities. So
investing overseas might result in a portfolio with less risk
but a higher expected return. This result occurs because of
low correlations between the returns on U.S. and interna-
tional securities, along with potentially high returns on over-
seas stocks.
Figure 8.6, presented earlier, demonstrated that an investor
can reduce the risk of his or her portfolio by holding a
number of stocks. The figure below suggests that investors
may be able to reduce risk even further by holding a portfo-
lio of stocks from all around the world, given the fact that
the returns on domestic and international stocks are not
perfectly correlated.
Even though foreign stocks represent roughly 60% of the
worldwide equity market and despite the apparent benefits
from investing overseas, the typical U.S. investor still puts
less than 10% of his or her money in foreign stocks. One
possible explanation for this reluctance to invest overseas is
that investors prefer domestic stocks because of lower trans-
actions costs. However, this explanation is questionable
because recent studies reveal that investors buy and sell
overseas
stocks
more
frequently
than
they
trade
their
domestic stocks.
Other explanations for the domestic bias include the additional
risks from investing overseas (for example, exchange rate risk)
and the fact that the typical U.S. investor is uninformed about
international investments and/or thinks that international invest-
ments are extremely risky. It has been argued that world capital
markets have become more integrated, causing the correlation
of returns between different countries to increase, which reduces
the benefits from international diversification. In addition, U.S.
corporations are investing more internationally, providing U.S.
investors with international diversification even if they purchase
only U.S. stocks.
Given the benefits of global diversification, many analysts
recommend that U.S. investors hold a large percentage of foreign
assets in their portfolio. For example, Mohamed El-Erian, a noted
investor who is CEO of the investment management firm PIMCO
and who appears regularly on CNBC, recently recommended that
for long-term investors, U.S. stocks should be only 15% of their
portfolio. While different analysts have different views and El-
Erian’s recommendations may seem extreme to some, our guess
is that in the future U.S. investors will shift more of their assets to
overseas investments.

8-4 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RISK AND RATES OF RETURN
The preceding section demonstrated that under the CAPM theory, beta is the most
appropriate measure of a stock’s relevant risk. The next issue is this: For a given
level of risk as measured by beta, what rate of return is required to compensate
investors for bearing that risk? To begin, let us define the following terms:
ri = expected rate of return on the ith stock.
ri = required rate of return on the ith stock. Note that if ri is less than ri, the
typical investor will not purchase this stock or will sell it if he or she owns
it. If ri is greater than ri, the investor will purchase the stock because it
looks like a bargain. Investors will be indifferent if ri
ri. Buying and
selling by investors tends to force the expected return to equal the
required return, although the two can differ from time to time before
the adjustment is completed.
ri= realized, after-the-fact return. A person obviously does not know ri at
the time he or she is considering the purchase of a stock.
rRF = risk-free rate of return. In this context, rRF is generally measured by
the return on U.S. Treasury securities. Some analysts recommend
that short-term T-bills be used; others recommend long-term
T-bonds. We generally use T-bonds because their maturity is closer
to the average investor’s holding period for stocks.
bi = beta coefficient of the ith stock. The beta of an average stock is bA
1 0.
rM = required rate of return on a portfolio consisting of all stocks, which is
called the market portfolio. rM is also the required rate of return on an
average bA
1 0 stock.
RPM = rM
rF
= risk premium on “the market” and the premium on an
average stock. This is the additional return over the risk-free rate
required to compensate an average investor for assuming an average
amount of risk. Average risk means a stock where bi
bA
1 0.
RPi = rM
rRF bi
RPM bi
risk premium on the ith stock. A stock’s risk
premium will be less than, equal to, or greater than the premium on
an average stock, RPM, depending on whether its beta is less than,
equal to, or greater than 1.0. If bi

1 0, then RPi

Explain the following statement: An asset held as part of a portfolio is generally less
risky than the same asset held in isolation.
What is meant by perfect positive correlation, perfect negative correlation, and zero
correlation?
In general, can the riskiness of a portfolio be reduced to zero by increasing the
number of stocks in the portfolio? Explain.
What is an average-risk stock? What is the beta of such a stock?
Why is it argued that beta is the best measure of a stock’s risk?
An investor has a two-stock portfolio with $25,000 invested in Stock X and
$50,000 invested in Stock Y. X’s beta is 1.50, and Y’s beta is 0.60. What is the
beta of the investor’s portfolio? (0.90)

The market risk premium, RPM, shows the premium that investors require
for bearing the risk of an average stock. The size of this premium depends on how
risky investors think the stock market is and on their degree of risk aversion. Let
us assume that at the current time, Treasury bonds yield rRF
6% and an average
share of stock has a required rate of return of rM
11%. Therefore, the market risk
premium is 5%, calculated as follows:
RPM
rM – rRF
11% – 6%
5%
It should be noted that the risk premium of an average stock, rM
rRF, is hard
to measure because it is impossible to obtain a precise estimate of the expected
future return of the market, rM.20 Given the difficulty of estimating future market
returns, analysts often look to historical data to estimate the market risk premium.
Historical data suggest that the market risk premium varies somewhat from year
to year due to changes in investors’ risk aversion but that it has generally ranged
from 4% to 8%.
While historical estimates might be a good starting point for estimating the
market risk premium, those estimates would be misleading if investors’ attitudes
toward risk changed considerably over time. (See “Estimating the Market Risk
Premium” box on page 283.) Indeed, many analysts have argued that the market
risk premium has fallen in recent years. If this claim is correct, the market risk
premium is considerably lower than one based on historical data.
The risk premium on individual stocks varies in a systematic manner from the
market risk premium. For example, if one stock is twice as risky as another stock
as measured by their beta coefficients, its risk premium should be twice as high.
Therefore, if we know the market risk premium, RPM, and the stock’s beta, bi, we
can find its risk premium as the product (RPM)bi. For example, if beta for Stock
L
0 5 and RPM
5%, RPL will be 2 5%:
Risk premium for Stock L
RPL
RPM bL
5% 0 5
2 5%
8.6
As the discussion in Chapter 6 implied, the required return for any stock can
be found as follows:
Required return on a stock
Risk-free return
Premium for the stock’s risk
Here the risk-free return includes a premium for expected inflation; and if we
assume that the stocks under consideration have similar maturities and liquidity,
the required return on Stock L can be found using the Security Market Line
(SML) equation:
Required return

F. Brigham and Phillip R. Daves, Intermediate Financial Management, 11th edition Mason, OH: (South-
Western/Cengage Learning, 2013). That chapter also discusses the assumptions embodied in the
CAPM framework. Some of those assumptions are unrealistic; and because of this, the theory does
not hold exactly.

ESTIMATING THE MARKET RISK PREMIUM
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is more than a
theory describing the trade-off between risk and return—it
is also widely used in practice. As we will see later, investors
use the CAPM to determine the discount rate for valuing
stocks and corporate managers use it to estimate the cost
of equity capital.
The market risk premium is a key component of the
CAPM, and it should be the difference between the expected
future return on the overall stock market and the expected
future return on a riskless investment. However, we cannot
obtain investors’ expectations; instead, academicians and
practitioners often use a historical risk premium as a proxy
for the expected risk premium. The historical premium is
found by taking the difference between the actual return on
the overall stock market and the risk-free rate during a
number of different years and then averaging the annual
results. Morningstar (through its recent purchase of Ibbotson
Associates) may provide the most comprehensive estimates
of historical risk premiums. It reports that the annual pre-
miums have averaged 6 7% over the past 87 years.
There are three potential problems with historical risk
premiums. First, what is the proper number of years over
which to compute the average? Morningstar goes back to
1926, when good data first became available; but that is an
arbitrary choice, and the starting and ending points make a
major difference in the calculated premium.
Second, historical premiums are likely to be misleading at
times when the market risk premium is changing. To illustrate,
the stock market was very strong from 1995 through 1999, in
part because investors were becoming less risk-averse, which
means that they applied a lower risk premium when they valued
stocks. The strong market resulted in stock returns of about
30% per year; and when bond yields were subtracted from the
high stock returns, the calculated risk premiums averaged
22 3% a year. When those high numbers were added to data
from prior years, they caused the long-run historical risk pre-
mium as reported by Morningstar to increase. Thus, a declin-
ing “true” risk premium led to very high stock returns, which, in
turn, led to an increase in the calculated historical risk pre-
mium. That’s a worrisome result, to say the least.
The third concern is that historical estimates may be biased
upward because they include only the returns of firms that
have survived—they do not reflect the losses incurred on
investments in failed firms. Stephen Brown, William Goetz-
mann, and Stephen Ross discussed the implications of this
“survivorship bias” in a 1995 Journal of Finance article. Putting
these ideas into practice, Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, and David
Wessels recently suggested that survivorship bias increases
historical returns by 1% to 2% a year. Therefore, they suggest
that practitioners subtract 1% to 2% from the historical esti-
mates to obtain the risk premium for use in the CAPM.
A 2012 survey of more than 7,000 academics, analysts,
and practitioners in 82 countries provides further insights
into the techniques they use to estimate the market risk
premium. For the United States, the academics on average
estimated that the market risk premium was 5 6%, which
was somewhat higher than the estimates reported by
analysts and practitioners (5 0% and 5 5% respectively).
Similar estimates were reported in many of the other lead-
ing developed countries.

different from the one shown in Figure 8.7, where we calculated betas.
In the earlier graph, the returns on individual stocks were plotted on
the vertical axis and returns on the market index were shown on the
horizontal axis. The betas found in Figure 8.7 were then plotted as points
on the horizontal axis of Figure 8.8.

Riskless securities have bi
0; so the return on the riskless asset, rRF

shown as the vertical axis intercept in Figure 8.8.
3.
The slope of the SML in Figure 8.8 can be found using the rise-over-run
procedure. When beta goes from 0 to 1 0, the required return goes from 6% to
11%, or 5%; so the slope is 5% 1 0
5%. Thus, a 1-unit increase in beta causes
a 5% increase in the required rate of return.

The slope of the SML reflects the degree of risk aversion in the economy—the
greater the average investor’s risk aversion, (a) the steeper the slope of the
line and (b) the greater the risk premium for all stocks—hence, the higher
the required rate of return on all stocks.
Both the SML and a company’s position on it change over time due to changes in
interest rates, investors’ risk aversion, and individual companies’ betas. Such
changes are discussed in the following sections.
8-4A THE IMPACT OF EXPECTED INFLATION
As we discussed in Chapter 6, interest amounts to “rent” on borrowed money, or
the price of money. Thus, rRF is the price of money to a riskless borrower. We also
saw that the risk-free rate as measured by the rate on U.S. Treasury securities is
called the nominal, or quoted, rate; and it consists of two elements: (1) a real inflation-
free rate of return, r , and (2) an inflation premium, IP, equal to the anticipated rate of
inflation.21 Thus, rRF
r
IP. The real rate on long-term Treasury bonds has
historically ranged from 2% to 4%, with a mean of about 3%. Therefore, if no
inflation were expected, long-term Treasury bonds would yield about 3%. How-
ever, as the expected rate of inflation increases, a premium must be added to the
real risk-free rate of return to compensate investors for the loss of purchasing
power that results from inflation. Therefore, the 6% rRF shown in Figure 8.8 might
be thought of as consisting of a 3% real risk-free rate of return plus a 3% inflation
premium: rRF
r
IP
3%

If the expected inflation rate rose by 2%, to 3%

5%, rRF would rise to
8%. Such a change is shown in Figure 8.9. Notice that the increase in rRF leads

to an equal increase in the rates of return on all risky assets because the
same inflation premium is built into required rates of return on both riskless
and risky assets.22 Therefore, the rate of return on our illustrative average stock,
rA, increases from 11% to 13%. Other risky securities’ returns also rise by two
percentage points.
8-4B CHANGES IN RISK AVERSION
The slope of the SML reflects the extent to which investors are averse to risk—the
steeper the slope of the line, the more the average investor requires as compensa-
tion for bearing risk. Suppose investors were indifferent to risk; that is, they were
not at all risk-averse. If rRF was 6%, risky assets would also have a required return
of 6% because if there were no risk aversion, there would be no risk premium. In
that case, the SML would plot as a horizontal line. However, because investors are
risk-averse, there is a risk premium; and the greater the risk aversion, the steeper
the slope of the SML.
Figure 8.10 illustrates an increase in risk aversion. The market risk premium
rises from 5% to 7 5%, causing rM to rise from rM1
11% to rM2
13 5%. The
returns on other risky assets also rise, and the effect of this shift in risk aversion is

22Recall that the inflation premium for any asset is the average expected rate of inflation over the
asset’s life. Thus, in this analysis, we must assume that all securities plotted on the SML graph have the
same life or that the expected rate of future inflation is constant.
It should also be noted that r in a CAPM analysis can be proxied by either a long-term rate (the
T-bond rate) or a short-term rate (the T-bill rate). Traditionally, the T-bill rate was used; but in recent
years, there has been a movement toward use of the T-bond rate because there is a closer relationship
between T-bond yields and stocks’ returns than between T-bill yields and stocks’ returns. See Ibbotson
Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation: 2013 Valuation Yearbook (Chicago: Morningstar, Inc., 2013), p. 44, for a
discussion.

more pronounced on riskier securities. For example, the required return on Stock
L with b
0 5 increases by only 1 25 percentage points, from 8 5% to 9 75%,
whereas the required return on a stock with a beta of 1 5 increases by
3 75 percentage points, from 13 5% to 17 25%.
8-4C CHANGES IN A STOCK’S BETA COEFFICIENT
As we see later in the book, a firm can influence its market risk (hence, its beta)
through changes in the composition of its assets and through changes in the
amount of debt it uses. A company’s beta can also change as a result of external
factors such as increased competition in its industry and expiration of basic
patents. When such changes occur, the firm’s required rate of return also changes;
and as we see in Chapter 9, this change will affect its stock price. For example,
consider Allied Food Products, with a beta of 1 48. Now suppose some action
occurred that caused Allied’s beta to increase from 1 48 to 2 0. If the conditions
depicted in Figure 8.8 held, Allied’s required rate of return would increase from
13 4% to 16%:

is 4%. Stock A has a beta

a. What is the required rate of return on each stock?
b. Assume that investors become less willing to take on risk (that is, they become more
risk averse) so the market risk premium rises from 4% to 6%. Assume that the risk-free
rate remains constant. What effect will this have on the required rates of return on the
two stocks?

Thus, the required rate of return on Stock A increases from 7 8% to 10 2%, while the

return has increased more than Stock B’s required return because Stock A has a higher
beta. Shifts in the risk premium have a more pronounced effect on riskier stocks (i.e., those
stocks with higher betas).

8-5 SOME CONCERNS ABOUT BETA AND THE CAPM
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is more than just an abstract
theory described in textbooks—it has great intuitive appeal and is widely
used by analysts, investors, and corporations. However, a number of recent
studies have raised concerns about its validity. For example, a study by
Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dart-
mouth found no historical relationship between stocks’ returns and their
market betas, confirming a position long held by some professors and stock
market analysts.24
As an alternative to the traditional CAPM, researchers and practitioners
are developing models with more explanatory variables than just beta. These
multivariable models represent an attractive generalization of the traditional
S E L F T E S T
Differentiate between a stock’s expected rate of return (r); required rate of return (r);
and realized, after-the-fact historical return (r). Which would have to be larger to
induce you to buy the stock, r or r? At a given point in time, would r, r, and r
typically be the same or different? Explain.
What are the differences between the relative volatility graph (Figure 8.7), where
“betas are made,” and the SML graph (Figure 8.8), where “betas are used”?
Explain how both graphs are constructed and what information they convey.
What would happen to the SML graph in Figure 8.8 if expected inflation
increased or decreased?
What happens to the SML graph when risk aversion increases or decreases?
What would the SML look like if investors were indifferent to risk, that is, if they
had zero risk aversion?
How can a firm influence the size of its beta?
A stock has a beta of 1.2. Assume that the risk-free rate is 4.5% and the market
risk premium is 5%. What is the stock’s required rate of return? (10.5%)
Kenneth French’s website,
mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/
pages/faculty/ken.french/
index.html, is an excellent
resource for information
regarding factors related to
stock returns.
23The concepts covered in this chapter are obviously important to investors, but they are also
important for managers in two key ways. First, as we see in the next chapter, the risk of a stock
affects the required rate of return on equity capital, and that feeds directly into the important subject of
capital budgeting. Second, and also related to capital budgeting, the “true” risk of individual projects is
impacted by their correlation with the firm’s other projects and with other assets that the firm’s
stockholders might hold. We discuss these topics in later chapters.
24See Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, “The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns,” Journal
of Finance, vol. 47, no. 2 (June 1992), pp. 427–465; and Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French,
“Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 33,
no. 1 (February 1993), pp. 3–56. They found that stock returns are related to firm size and market/book
ratios. Small firms and firms with low market/book ratios had higher returns; however, they found no
relationship between returns and beta.

CAPM model’s insight that market risk—risk that cannot be diversified
away—underlies the pricing of assets. In the multivariable models, risk is
assumed to be caused by a number of different factors, whereas the CAPM
gauges risk only relative to returns on the market portfolio. These multi-
variable models represent a potentially important step forward in finance
theory; however, they also have some deficiencies when applied in practice.
As a result, the basic CAPM is still the most widely used method for estimat-
ing required rates of return on stocks.
8-6 SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CORPORATE
MANAGERS AND INVESTORS
The connection between risk and return is an important concept, and it has
numerous implications for both corporate managers and investors. As we will
see in later chapters, corporate managers spend a great deal of time assessing
the risk and returns on individual projects. Indeed, given their concerns about
the risk of individual projects, it might be fair to ask why we spend so much
time discussing the riskiness of stocks. Why not begin by looking at the
riskiness of such business assets as plant and equipment? The reason is that
for management whose primary goal is stock price maximization, the overriding
consideration is the riskiness of the firm’s stock, and the relevant risk of any physical
asset must be measured in terms of its effect on the stock’s risk as seen by investors.
For example, suppose Goodyear, the tire company, is considering a major
investment in a new product, recapped tires. Sales of recaps (hence, earnings
on the new operation) are highly uncertain; so on a stand-alone basis, the new
venture appears to be quite risky. However, suppose returns in the recap
business are negatively correlated with Goodyear’s other operations—when
times are good and people have plenty of money, they buy new cars with
new tires; but when times are bad, they tend to keep their old cars and buy
recaps for them. Therefore, returns would be high on regular operations and
low on the recap division during good times, but the opposite would be true
during recessions. The result might be a pattern like that shown earlier in
Figure 8.4 for Stocks W and M. Thus, what appears to be a risky investment
when viewed on a stand-alone basis might not be very risky when viewed
within the context of the company as a whole.
This analysis can be extended to the corporation’s stockholders. Because
Goodyear’s stock is owned by diversified stockholders, the real issue each time
management makes an investment decision is this: How will this investment affect
the risk of our stockholders? Again, the stand-alone risk of an individual project
may look quite high; however, viewed in the context of the project’s effect on
stockholder risk, it may not be very large. We address this issue again in Chapter
12, where we examine the effects of capital budgeting on companies’ beta coeffi-
cients and thus on stockholders’ risks.

Have there been any studies that question the validity of the CAPM? Explain.

While these concepts are obviously important for individual investors, they
are also important for corporate managers. We summarize some key ideas that all
investors should consider:
1.
There is a trade-off between risk and return. The average investor likes higher
returns but dislikes risk. It follows that higher-risk investments need to offer
investors higher expected returns. Put another way—if you are seeking higher
returns, you must be willing to assume higher risks.
2.
Diversification is crucial. By diversifying wisely, investors can
dramatically reduce risk without reducing their expected returns. Don’t
put all of your money in one or two stocks or in one or two industries.
A huge mistake that many people make is to invest a high percentage
of their funds in their employer’s stock. If the company goes bankrupt,
they not only lose their job but also their invested capital. While no
stock is completely riskless, you can smooth out the bumps by holding
a well-diversified portfolio.
3.
Real returns are what matters. All investors should understand the
difference between nominal and real returns. When assessing performance,
the real return (what remains after inflation) is what matters. It follows that
as expected inflation increases, investors need to receive higher nominal
returns.
4.
The risk of an investment often depends on how long you plan to hold the
investment. Common stocks, for example, can be extremely risky for short-
term investors. However, over the long haul, the bumps tend to even out;
thus, stocks are less risky when held as part of a long-term portfolio.
Indeed, in his best-selling book Stocks for the Long Run, Jeremy Siegel of the
University of Pennsylvania concludes that “[t]he safest long-term
investment for the preservation of purchasing power has clearly been
stocks, not bonds.”
5.
While the past gives us insights into the risk and returns on various
investments, there is no guarantee that the future will repeat the past. Stocks
that have performed well in recent years might tumble, while stocks that
have struggled may rebound. The same thing may hold true for the stock
market as a whole. Even Jeremy Siegel, who has preached that stocks have
historically been good long-term investments, also has argued that there is
no assurance that returns in the future will be as strong as they have been
in the past. More importantly, when purchasing a stock, you always need
to ask, “Is this stock fairly valued, or is it currently priced too high?”
We discuss this issue more completely in the next chapter.
S E L F T E S T
Explain the following statement: The stand-alone risk of an individual corporate
project may be quite high; but viewed in the context of its effect on stockholders’
risk, the project’s true risk may not be very large.
How does the correlation between returns on a project and returns on the firm’s
other assets affect the project’s risk?
What are some important concepts for individual investors to consider when
evaluating the risk and returns of various investments?

In this chapter, we described the relationship between risk and return. We
discussed how to calculate risk and return for individual assets and for portfo-
lios. In particular, we differentiated between stand-alone risk and risk in a
portfolio context and we explained the benefits of diversification. We also
discussed the CAPM, which describes how risk should be measured and how
risk affects rates of return. In the chapters that follow, we give you the tools
needed to estimate the required rates of return on a firm’s common stock and
explain how that return and the yield on its bonds are used to develop the
firm’s cost of capital. As you will see, the cost of capital is a key element in the
capital budgeting process.

b.
If the risk-free rate is 6% and the market risk premium is 5%, what is the holding
company’s required rate of return?
c.
ECRI is considering a change in its strategic focus; it will reduce its reliance on the
electric utility subsidiary, so the percentage of its capital in this subsidiary will be
reduced to 50%. At the same time, it will increase its reliance on the international/
special projects division, so the percentage of its capital in that subsidiary will rise to
15%. What will the company’s required rate of return be after these changes?

Now suppose that rRF (1) increases to 10% or (2) decreases to 8%. The slope of
the SML remains constant. How would this affect rM and ri?
c.
Now assume that rRF remains at 9% but rM (1) increases to 16% or (2) falls to 13%.
The slope of the SML does not remain constant. How would these changes affect ri?

b.
What is the beta of Fund Q?
c.
What is the required return of Fund Q?

Would you expect the standard deviation of Fund Q to be less than 15%, equal to 15%,
or greater than 15%? Explain.

PORTFOLIO BETA
Suppose you held a diversified portfolio consisting of a $7,500 invest-
ment in each of 20 different common stocks. The portfolio’s beta is 1 12. Now suppose
you decided to sell one of the stocks in your portfolio with a beta of 1 0 for $7,500 and use
the proceeds to buy another stock with a beta of 1 75. What would your portfolio’s new
beta be?
8-15
CAPM AND REQUIRED RETURN
HR Industries (HRI) has a beta of 1 8, while LR Industries’
(LRI) beta is 0 6. The risk-free rate is 6%, and the required rate of return on an average stock
is 13%. The expected rate of inflation built into rRF falls by 1 5 percentage points, the real
risk-free rate remains constant, the required return on the market falls to 10 5%, and all
betas remain constant. After all of these changes, what will be the difference in the required
returns for HRI and LRI?
8-16
CAPM AND PORTFOLIO RETURN
You have been managing a $5 million portfolio that has
a beta of 1 25 and a required rate of return of 12%. The current risk-free rate is 5 25%.
Assume that you receive another $500,000. If you invest the money in a stock with a beta of
0 75, what will be the required return on your $5 5 million portfolio?
8-17
PORTFOLIO BETA
A mutual fund manager has a $20 million portfolio with a beta of 1 5.
The risk-free rate is 4 5%, and the market risk premium is 5 5%. The manager expects to
receive an additional $5 million, which she plans to invest in a number of stocks. After
investing the additional funds, she wants the fund’s required return to be 13%. What
should be the average beta of the new stocks added to the portfolio?
8-18
EXPECTED RETURNS
Suppose you won the lottery and had two options: (1) receiving
$0 5 million or (2) taking a gamble in which at the flip of a coin you receive $1 million if a
head comes up but receive zero if a tail comes up.
a.
What is the expected value of the gamble?
b.
Would you take the sure $0 5 million or the gamble?
c.
If you chose the sure $0 5 million, would that indicate that you are a risk averter or a
risk seeker?
d.
Suppose the payoff was actually $0 5 million—that was the only choice. You now face
the choice of investing it in a U.S. Treasury bond that will return $537,500 at the end of
a year or a common stock that has a 50 50 chance of being worthless or worth
$1,150,000 at the end of the year.
1.
The expected profit on the T-bond investment is $37,500. What is the expected
dollar profit on the stock investment?
2.
The expected rate of return on the T-bond investment is 7 5%. What is the
expected rate of return on the stock investment?
3.
Would you invest in the bond or the stock? Why?
4.
Exactly how large would the expected profit (or the expected rate of return)
have to be on the stock investment to make you invest in the stock, given the
7 5% return on the bond?
5.
How might your decision be affected if, rather than buying one stock for
$0 5 million, you could construct a portfolio consisting of 100 stocks with
$5,000 invested in each? Each of these stocks has the same return characteristics
as the one stock—that is, a 50 50 chance of being worth zero or $11,500 at
year-end. Would the correlation between returns on these stocks matter?
Explain.

a.
Use the data to calculate annual rates of return for Bartman, Reynolds, and the
Winslow 5000 Index. Then calculate each entity’s average return over the 5-year
period. (Hint: Remember, returns are calculated by subtracting the beginning price
from the ending price to get the capital gain or loss, adding the dividend to the capital
gain or loss, and dividing the result by the beginning price. Assume that dividends are
already included in the index. Also, you cannot calculate the rate of return for 2008
because you do not have 2007 data.)
b.
Calculate the standard deviations of the returns for Bartman, Reynolds, and the
Winslow 5000. (Hint: Use the sample standard deviation formula, Equation 8.2a in this
chapter, which corresponds to the STDEV function in Excel.)
c.
Calculate the coefficients of variation for Bartman, Reynolds, and the Winslow 5000.
d.
Construct a scatter diagram that shows Bartman’s and Reynolds’ returns on the
vertical axis and the Winslow 5000 Index’s returns on the horizontal axis.
e.
Estimate Bartman’s and Reynolds’ betas by running regressions of their returns against
the index’s returns. (Hint: Refer to Web Appendix 8A.) Are these betas consistent with
your graph?
f.
Assume that the risk-free rate on long-term Treasury bonds is 6 04%. Assume also that
the average annual return on the Winslow 5000 is not a good estimate of the market’s
required return—it is too high. So use 11% as the expected return on the market. Use
the SML equation to calculate the two companies’ required returns.
g.
If you formed a portfolio that consisted of 50% Bartman and 50% Reynolds, what
would the portfolio’s beta and required return be?
h.
Suppose an investor wants to include Bartman Industries’ stock in his portfolio.
Stocks A, B, and C are currently in the portfolio; and their betas are 0 769, 0 985, and
1 423, respectively. Calculate the new portfolio’s required return if it consists of 25%
of Bartman, 15% of Stock A, 40% of Stock B, and 20% of Stock C.

RISK AND RETURN
Assume that you recently graduated with a major in finance. You just landed a job
as a financial planner with Merrill Finch Inc., a large financial services corporation. Your first assignment
is to invest $100,000 for a client. Because the funds are to be invested in a business at the end of 1 year,
you have been instructed to plan for a 1-year holding period. Further, your boss has restricted you to the
investment alternatives in the following table, shown with their probabilities and associated outcomes.
(For now, disregard the items at the bottom of the data; you will fill in the blanks later.)

Note:
aThe estimated returns of U.S. Rubber do not always move in the same direction as the overall economy. For
example, when the economy is below average, consumers purchase fewer tires than they would if the
economy was stronger. However, if the economy is in a flat-out recession, a large number of consumers
who were planning to purchase a new car may choose to wait and instead purchase new tires for the car they
currently own. Under these circumstances, we would expect U.S. Rubber’s stock price to be higher if there is a
recession than if the economy was just below average.
Merrill Finch’s economic forecasting staff has developed probability estimates for the state of the
economy; and its security analysts developed a sophisticated computer program to estimate the rate of
return on each alternative under each state of the economy. High Tech Inc. is an electronics firm,
Collections Inc. collects past-due debts, and U.S. Rubber manufactures tires and various other rubber
and plastics products. Merrill Finch also maintains a “market portfolio” that owns a market-weighted
fraction of all publicly traded stocks; you can invest in that portfolio and thus obtain average stock
market results. Given the situation described, answer the following questions:
a.
1. Why is the T-bill’s return independent of the state of the economy? Do T-bills promise a
completely risk-free return? Explain.
2. Why are High Tech’s returns expected to move with the economy, whereas Collections’ are
expected to move counter to the economy?
b.
Calculate the expected rate of return on each alternative and fill in the blanks on the row for r in the
previous table.
c.
You should recognize that basing a decision solely on expected returns is appropriate only for risk-
neutral individuals. Because your client, like most people, is risk-averse, the riskiness of each
alternative is an important aspect of the decision. One possible measure of risk is the standard
deviation of returns.
1. Calculate this value for each alternative and fill in the blank on the row for
in the table.

Suppose you suddenly remembered that the coefficient of variation (CV) is generally regarded as being
a better measure of stand-alone risk than the standard deviation when the alternatives being considered

e.
Suppose you created a two-stock portfolio by investing $50,000 in High Tech and $50,000 in Collections.
1. Calculate the expected return rp , the standard deviation

2. How does the riskiness of this two-stock portfolio compare with the riskiness of the individual
stocks if they were held in isolation?
f.
Suppose an investor starts with a portfolio consisting of one randomly selected stock.
1. What would happen to the riskiness and to the expected return of the portfolio as more randomly
selected stocks were added to the portfolio?
2. What is the implication for investors? Draw a graph of the two portfolios to illustrate your answer.
g.
1. Should the effects of a portfolio impact the way investors think about the riskiness of individual stocks?
2. If you decided to hold a one-stock portfolio (and consequently were exposed to more risk than
diversified investors), could you expect to be compensated for all of your risk; that is, could you
earn a risk premium on the part of your risk that you could have eliminated by diversifying?

2. Do the expected returns appear to be related to each alternative’s market risk?
3. Is it possible to choose among the alternatives on the basis of the information developed thus far?
Use the data given at the start of the problem to construct a graph that shows how the T-bill’s,
High Tech’s, and the market’s beta coefficients are calculated. Then discuss what betas measure
and how they are used in risk analysis.
i.
The yield curve is currently flat; that is, long-term Treasury bonds also have a 5 5% yield.
Consequently, Merrill Finch assumes that the risk-free rate is 5 5%.
1. Write out the Security Market Line (SML) equation, use it to calculate the required rate of return
on each alternative, and graph the relationship between the expected and required rates of return.
2. How do the expected rates of return compare with the required rates of return?
3. Does the fact that Collections has an expected return that is less than the T-bill rate make any
sense? Explain.
4. What would be the market risk and the required return of a 50 50 portfolio of High Tech and
Collections? Of High Tech and U.S. Rubber?
j.
1. Suppose investors raised their inflation expectations by 3 percentage points over current estimates
as reflected in the 5 5% risk-free rate. What effect would higher inflation have on the SML and on
the returns required on high- and low-risk securities?
2. Suppose instead that investors’ risk aversion increased enough to cause the market risk premium
to increase by 3 percentage points. (Inflation remains constant.) What effect would this have on
the SML and on returns of high- and low-risk securities?

USING PAST INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE REQUIRED RETURNS
Chapter 8 discussed the basic trade-off between risk and return. In the Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM) discussion, beta was identified as the correct measure of risk for diversified shareholders. Recall
that beta measures the extent to which the returns of a given stock move with the stock market. When
using the CAPM to estimate required returns, we would like to know how the stock will move with the
market in the future; but because we don’t have a crystal ball, we generally use historical data to estimate
this relationship with beta.
As mentioned in Web Appendix 8A, beta can be estimated by regressing the individual stock’s returns
against the returns of the overall market. As an alternative to running our own regressions, we can rely on
reported betas from a variety of sources. These published sources make it easy for us to readily obtain beta
estimates for most large publicly traded corporations. However, a word of caution is in order. Beta
estimates can often be quite sensitive to the time period in which the data are estimated, the market index
used, and the frequency of the data used. Therefore, it is not uncommon to find a wide range of beta
estimates among the various published sources. Indeed, Thomson One reports multiple beta estimates.
These multiple estimates reflect the fact that Thomson One puts together data from a variety of sources.
Discussion Questions
1.
Begin by looking at the historical performance of the overall stock market. If you want to see, for example, the
performance of the S&P 500, select “INDICES” (near bottom left of your screen), enter S&PCOMP, and click “GO.”
Click on “OVERVIEW.” You will see a quick summary of the market’s performance over the past 1, 3, and
12 months. How has the market performed over the past year?
2.
Now click on “PRICES” on the left-hand side of the screen. From the next screen you should see the interactive
price chart with the S&P 500 index’s performance during the past year. You can also change the time frame
graphed and view the data from which the chart is drawn.
3.
Now let’s take a closer look at the stocks of four companies: Colgate Palmolive (Ticker = CL), Campbell Soup
(CPB), Motorola Solutions (MSI), and Tiffany & Co (TIF). Before looking at the data, which of these companies
would you expect to have a relatively high beta (greater than 1 0) and which of these companies would you expect
to have a relatively low beta (less than 1 0)?
4.
Select one of the four stocks listed in Question 3 by selecting “COMPANY ANALYSIS,” entering the company’s
ticker symbol in the blank companies box, and clicking “GO.” On the company overview page, you should see a
chart that summarizes how the stock has done relative to the S&P 500 over the past 6 months. Has the stock
outperformed or underperformed the overall market during this time period?
5.
If you scroll down the company overview page, you should see an estimate of the company’s beta. What is the
company’s beta? What was the source of the estimated beta?
6.
Click on “PRICES” on the left-hand side of the screen. What is the company’s current dividend yield? What has
been its total return to investors over the past 6 months? Over the past year? Over the past 3 years? (Remember that
total return includes the dividend yield plus any capital gains or losses.)
7.
Assume that the risk-free rate is 4% and the market risk premium is 5%. What is the required return on the
company’s stock?
8.
Repeat the same exercise for each of the three remaining companies. Do the reported betas confirm your earlier
intuition? In general, do you find that the higher-beta stocks tend to do better in up markets and worse in down
markets? Explain.

Searching for the Right Stock
Over the long run, returns in the U.S. stock market
have been quite strong, averaging approximately
12% per year. However, these returns are far from
certain, and there is considerable variation in the
market’s performance from year to year. Indeed,
as the chart below indicates, the S&P 500 index
has been on a real roller coaster ride since early
2000, where there have been a series of sharp
peaks and valleys. Most notably, we see the dra-
matic collapse of the market in 2008 and early
2009. Since then, the S&P 500 has dramatically
rebounded from a value of 811 in April 2009 to
1697.60 in September 2013.
As we discussed in Chapter 8, the returns of
individual stocks are even more volatile than the
returns of the overall market. For example, in 2012,
Lumber Liquidators’ stock price rose 199.2%,
Regeneron Pharmaceutical’s stock price jumped
208.6%, and, most impressively, 3D Systems’ stock
price soared 270.5%. On the down side, Lone Pine
Resources’ stock price declined 82.5%, Dynegy’s
stock price dropped 89.3%, and Houston American
Energy’s stock price plummeted 98.2%. This wide
range in individual stocks’ performance shows, first,
that diversification is important and, second, that
when it comes to picking stocks, it is not enough
to simply pick a good company—the stock must
also be “fairly” priced.
To determine whether a stock is fairly
priced, you first need to estimate the stock’s
true value, or “intrinsic value,” a concept first
discussed in Chapter 1. With this objective in
mind, in this chapter we describe some models
that analysts have used to estimate intrinsic
values. As you will see, while it is difficult to
predict stock prices, we are not completely in
the dark. Indeed, after studying this chapter, you
should have a reasonably good understanding
of the factors that influence stock prices; and
with that knowledge—plus a little luck—you
should be able to successfully navigate the mar-
ket’s often-treacherous ups and downs.

In Chapter 7, we examined bonds and their valuation. We now turn to stocks, both
common and preferred. Because the cash flows provided by bonds are set by
contract, it is generally easy to predict their cash flows. Preferred stock dividends
are also set by contract, which makes them similar to bonds; and they are valued in
much the same way. However, common stock dividends are not contractual—they
depend on the firm’s earnings, which in turn depend on many random factors,
making their valuation more difficult. Two fairly straightforward models are used to
estimate stocks’ intrinsic (or “true”) values: (1) the discounted dividend model and
(2) the corporate valuation model. A stock should, of course, be bought if its price
is less than its estimated intrinsic value and sold if its price exceeds its intrinsic
value.
By the time you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Discuss the legal rights of stockholders.

9-1 LEGAL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS
A corporation’s common stockholders are the owners of the corporation; and as
such, they have certain rights and privileges, as discussed in this section.
9-1A CONTROL OF THE FIRM
A firm’s common stockholders have the right to elect its directors, who, in turn,
elect the officers who manage the business. In a small firm, usually the major
stockholder is also the president and chair of the board of directors. In large,
publicly owned firms, the managers typically have some stock, but their personal
holdings are generally insufficient to give them voting control. Thus, the manage-
ments of most publicly owned firms can be removed by the stockholders if the
management team is not effective.
State and federal laws stipulate how stockholder control is to be exercised. First,
corporations must hold elections of directors periodically, usually once a year, with
the vote taken at the annual meeting. Each share of stock has one vote; thus, the
owner of 1,000 shares has 1,000 votes for each director.1 Stockholders can appear at
the annual meeting and vote in person, but typically they transfer their right to vote
to another person by means of a proxy. Management always solicits stockholders’
proxies and usually receives them. However, if earnings are poor and stockholders
are dissatisfied, an outside group may solicit the proxies in an effort to overthrow
management and take control of the business. This is known as a proxy fight.
The question of control has become a central issue in finance in recent years.
The frequency of proxy fights has increased, as have attempts by one corporation
to take over another by purchasing a majority of the outstanding stock. These
actions are called takeovers. Some well-known examples of takeover battles in
past years include KKR’s acquisition of RJR Nabisco, Chevron’s acquisition of
Gulf Oil, and the QVC/Viacom fight to take over Paramount. More recently, in
November 2009, Kraft Foods made a hostile takeover bid of $16 7 billion for
Cadbury, the British chocolate and gum manufacturer. On January 19, 2010,
Cadbury’s management accepted Kraft’s revised $21 8 billion buyout offer and
agreed to recommend the offer to its shareholders.
Managers without more than 50% of their firms’ stock are very concerned
about proxy fights and takeovers, and many of them have attempted to obtain
stockholder approval for changes in their corporate charters that would make
takeovers more difficult. For example, a number of companies have persuaded
their stockholders to agree (1) to elect only one-third of the directors each year
(rather than electing all directors each year), (2) to require 75% of the stockholders
(rather than 50%) to approve a merger, and (3) to vote in a “poison pill” provision
that would allow the stockholders of a firm that is taken over by another firm to
buy shares in the second firm at a reduced price. The poison pill makes the
acquisition unattractive and thus helps ward off hostile takeover attempts. Man-
agers seeking such changes generally cite a fear that the firm will be picked up at a
bargain price, but it often appears that the managers’ concern about their own
positions is the primary consideration.
Managers’ moves to make takeovers more difficult have been countered
by stockholders, especially large institutional stockholders, who do not like bar-
riers erected to protect incompetent managers. To illustrate, the California
Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), which is one of the largest
institutional investors, has led proxy fights with several corporations whose

1In the situation described, a 1,000-share stockholder could cast 1,000 votes for each of three directors if
there were three contested seats on the board. An alternative procedure that may be prescribed in the
corporate charter calls for cumulative voting. There the 1,000-share stockholder would get 3,000 votes if
there were three vacancies, and he or she could cast all of them for one director. Cumulative voting
helps small groups obtain representation on the board.

financial performances were poor in CalPERS’ judgment. CalPERS wants compa-
nies to increase outside (nonmanagement) directors’ ability to force managers to
be more responsive to stockholder complaints.
Managers’ pay is another contentious issue. It has been asserted, with con-
siderable support, that CEOs tend to pick other CEOs to serve on their boards,
with “you-scratch-my-back-and-I’ll-scratch-yours” behavior resulting in excessive
compensation packages to top managers. Boards have tried to conceal the facts by
making it extremely difficult for stockholders to know top managers’ salaries and
bonuses. CalPERS and other institutional investors have weighed in on this issue,
and most firms today have been forced to make their compensation packages
more transparent. Similarly, the Dodd–Frank bill imposed a Say-on-Pay provision,
which provides shareholders the ability to vote on executive compensation. While
this provision is non-binding, it imposes some pressure on managers who don’t
want to see shareholders voting to disapprove of their pay package.
For many years, SEC rules prohibited large investors such as CalPERS from
getting together to force corporate managers to institute policy changes. However,
the SEC began changing its rules in 1993, and now large investors can work
together to force management changes. These rulings have helped keep managers
focused on stockholder concerns, which means the maximization of stock prices.
9-1B THE PREEMPTIVE RIGHT
Common stockholders often have the right, called the preemptive right, to pur-
chase on a pro rata basis any additional shares sold by the firm. In some states, the
preemptive right is automatically included in every corporate charter; in other
states, it must be specifically inserted into the charter.
The purpose of the preemptive right is twofold. First, it prevents the manage-
ment of a corporation from issuing a large number of additional shares and
purchasing those shares itself. Management could use this tactic to seize control
of the corporation and frustrate the will of the current stockholders. The second,
and far more important, reason for the preemptive right is to protect stockholders
from a dilution of value. For example, suppose 1,000 shares of common stock,
each with a price of $100, were outstanding, making the total market value of the
firm $100,000. If an additional 1,000 shares were sold at $50 a share, or for $50,000,
this would raise the firm’s total market value to $150,000. When the new total
market value is divided by the 2,000 total shares now outstanding, a value of $75 a
share is obtained. The old stockholders would thus lose $25 per share, and the
new stockholders would have an instant profit of $25 per share. Thus, selling
common stock at a price below the market value would dilute a firm’s price and
transfer wealth from its present stockholders to those who were allowed to
purchase the new shares. The preemptive right prevents this.
9-2 TYPES OF COMMON STOCK
Although most firms have only one type of common stock, in some instances,
classified stock is used to meet special needs. Generally, when special classifica-
tions are used, one type is designated Class A, another Class B, and so forth. Small,

new companies seeking funds from outside sources frequently use different types
of common stock. For example, when Google went public, it sold Class A stock to
the public while its Class B stock was retained by the company’s insiders. The key
difference is that the Class B stock has 10 votes per share while the Class A stock
has 1 vote per share. Google’s Class B shares are predominantly held by the
company’s two founders and its current CEO. The use of classified stock thus
enables the company’s founders to maintain control over the company without
having to own a majority of the common stock. For this reason, Class B stock of
this type is sometimes called founders’ shares. Because dual-class share structures
of this type give special voting privileges to key insiders, these structures are
sometimes criticized because they may enable insiders to make decisions that are
counter to the interests of the majority of stockholders.
Note that “Class A,” “Class B,” and so forth, have no standard meanings.
Most firms have no classified shares; but a firm that does could designate its Class
B shares as founders’ shares and its Class A shares as those sold to the public,
while another could reverse those designations. Still other firms could use stock
classifications for entirely different purposes. For example, when General Motors
acquired Hughes Aircraft for $5 billion, it paid in part with a new Class H
common, GMH, which had limited voting rights and whose dividends were tied
to Hughes’s performance as a GM subsidiary. The reasons for the new stock were
that (1) GM wanted to limit voting privileges on the new classified stock because
of management’s concern about a possible takeover and (2) Hughes’s employees
wanted to be rewarded more directly on Hughes’s own performance than would
have been possible through regular GM stock. These Class H shares disappeared
in 2003 when GM decided to sell off the Hughes unit.
9-3 STOCK PRICE VERSUS INTRINSIC VALUE
We saw in Chapter 1 that a manager should seek to maximize the value of his or
her firm’s stock. In that chapter, we also emphasized the difference between stock
price and intrinsic value. The stock price is simply the current market price, and it
is easily observed for publicly traded companies. By contrast, intrinsic value,
which represents the “true” value of the company’s stock, cannot be directly
observed and must instead be estimated. Figure 9.1 illustrates once again the
connection between stock price and intrinsic value.
As the figure suggests, market equilibrium occurs when the stock’s price
equals its intrinsic value. If the stock market is reasonably efficient, gaps between
the stock price and intrinsic value should not be very large and they should not
persist for very long. However, in some cases, an individual company’s stock price
may be much higher or lower than its intrinsic value. During several years leading
up to the credit crunch of 2007–2008, most of the large investment banks were
reporting record profits and selling at record prices. However, much of those
earnings were illusory because they did not reflect the huge risks that existed
in the mortgage-backed securities that these firms were purchasing. So with
hindsight, we now know that the market prices of most financial firms’ stocks

exceeded their intrinsic values just prior to 2007. Then when the market realized
what was happening, those stock prices crashed. Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and
others lost more than 60% of their value in a few short months; and Bear Stearns,
the fifth-largest investment bank, saw its stock price drop from $171 in 2007 to
$2 just before its ultimate collapse in mid-March 2008. It clearly pays to question
market prices at times!
9-3A WHY DO INVESTORS AND COMPANIES CARE
ABOUT INTRINSIC VALUE?
The remainder of this chapter focuses primarily on different approaches for
estimating a stock’s intrinsic value. Before these approaches are described, it is
worth asking why it is important for investors and companies to understand how
to calculate intrinsic value.
When investing in common stocks, one’s goal is to purchase stocks that are
undervalued (i.e., the price is below the stock’s intrinsic value) and avoid stocks
that are overvalued. Consequently, Wall Street analysts, institutional investors
who control mutual funds and pension funds, and many individual investors
are interested in finding reliable models that help predict a stock’s intrinsic value.
Investors obviously care about intrinsic value, but managers also need to
understand how intrinsic value is estimated. First, managers need to know how
alternative actions are likely to affect stock prices; and the models of intrinsic
value that we cover help demonstrate the connection between managerial deci-
sions and firm value. Second, managers should consider whether their stock is
significantly undervalued or overvalued before making certain decisions. For
example, firms should consider carefully the decision to issue new shares if they
believe their stock is undervalued; and an estimate of their stock’s intrinsic value
is the key to such decisions.
Two basic models are used to estimate intrinsic values: the discounted dividend
model and the corporate valuation model. The dividend model focuses on dividends,
while the corporate model goes beyond dividends and focuses on sales, costs, and

free cash flows. In the following sections, we describe these approaches in more
detail.
9-4 THE DISCOUNTED DIVIDEND MODEL
The value of a share of common stock depends on the cash flows it is expected to
provide, and those flows consist of two elements: (1) the dividends the investor
receives each year while he or she holds the stock and (2) the price received when
the stock is sold. The final price includes the original price paid plus an expected
capital gain. Keep in mind that there are many different investors in the market
and thus many different sets of expectations. Therefore, investors will have dif-
ferent opinions about a stock’s true intrinsic value and thus its proper price. The
analysis as performed by the marginal investor, whose actions actually determine
the equilibrium stock price, is critical; but every investor, marginal or not, implic-
itly goes through the same type of analysis.
The following terms are used in our analysis:2
Dt = the dividend a stockholder expects to receive at the end
of each Year t. D0 is the last dividend the company
paid. Because it has already been paid, a buyer of the
stock will not receive D0. The first dividend a new
buyer will receive is D1, which is paid at the end of
Year 1. D2 is the dividend expected at the end of Year
2; D3, at the end of Year 3; and so forth. D0 is known
with certainty; but D1, D2, and all other future divi-
dends are expected values; and different investors can
have different expectations.3 Our primary concern is
with Dt as forecasted by the marginal investor.
P0 = actual market price of the stock today. P0 is known
with certainty, but predicted future prices are subject
to uncertainty.
P

t = both the expected price and the expected intrinsic
value of the stock at the end of each Year t (pro-
nounced “P hat t”) as seen by the investor doing the

2Many terms are described here, and students sometimes get concerned about having to memorize all
of them. We tell our students that we will provide formula sheets for use on exams, so they don't have
to try to memorize everything. With their minds thus eased, they end up learning what the terms are
rather than memorizing them.
3Stocks generally pay dividends quarterly, so theoretically we should evaluate them on a quarterly
basis. However, most analysts actually work with annual data because forecasted stock data are not
precise enough to warrant the use of a quarterly model. For additional information on the quarterly
model, see Charles M. Linke and J. Kenton Zumwalt, “Estimation Biases in Discounted Cash Flow

1984), pp. 15–21.

whose actions reflect the
beliefs of those people
who are currently trading

investor who determines a

the dividend stream and the riskiness of that stream.
There are many investors in the market, so there can
be many estimates for P

investor, P0 must equal P
^
0. Otherwise, a disequili-
brium would exist, and buying and selling in the
market would soon result in P0 equaling P
^
0 as seen
by the marginal investor.
g = expected growth rate in dividends as predicted by
an investor. If dividends are expected to grow at a
constant rate, g should also equal the expected
growth rate in earnings and the stock’s price. Differ-
ent investors use different g’s to evaluate a firm’s
stock; but the market price, P0, is based on g as
estimated by the marginal investor.
rs = required, or minimum acceptable, rate of return on
the stock considering its riskiness and the returns
available on other investments. Different investors
typically have different opinions, but the key is
again the marginal investor. The determinants of rs
include factors discussed in Chapter 8, including the
real rate of return, expected inflation, and risk.
^rs = expected rate of return (pronounced “r hat s”) that
an investor believes the stock will provide in the
future. The expected return can be above or below
the required return; but a rational investor will buy
the stock if r^
s exceeds rs, sell the stock if ^rs is less than
rs, and simply hold the stock if these returns are
equal. Again, the key is the marginal investor,
whose views determine the actual stock price.
rs = actual, or realized, after-the-fact rate of return, pro-
nounced “r bar s." You can expect to obtain a return
of rs = 10% if you buy a stock today; but if the
market declines, you may end up with an actual
realized return that is much lower, perhaps even
negative.
D1 P0 = dividend yield expected during the coming year. If
Company X’s stock is expected to pay a dividend of
D1
$1 during the next 12 months and if X’s current
price is P0
$20, the expected dividend yield will be
$1 $20

5%. Different investors could have
different expectations for D1; but again, the marginal
investor is the key.

P0 = expected capital gains yield on the stock during the

it is expected to rise to $21 00 by the end of the

All active investors hope to achieve better-than-average returns—they hope to
identify stocks whose intrinsic values exceed their current prices and whose expected
returns (expected by this investor) exceed their required rates of return. Note,
though, that about half of all investors are likely to be disappointed. A good under-
standing of the points made in this chapter can help you avoid being disappointed.
9-4A EXPECTED DIVIDENDS AS THE BASIS FOR STOCK VALUES
In our discussion of bonds, we used Equation 7.1 to find the value of a bond; the
equation is the present value of interest payments over the bond’s life plus the
present value of its maturity (or par) value:
VB
INT
1
rd

INT
1
rd
2
INT
1

N
M

rd

Stock prices are likewise determined as the present value of a stream of cash
flows, and the basic stock valuation equation is similar to the one for bonds. What
are the cash flows that a corporation will provide to its stockholders? To answer
that question, think of yourself as an investor who purchases the stock of a
company that is expected to exist indefinitely (for example, GE). You intend to
hold it (in your family) forever. In this case, all you (and your heirs) will receive is
a stream of dividends; and the value of the stock today can be calculated as the
present value of an infinite stream of dividends:

9.1
What about the more typical case, where you expect to hold the stock for a
finite period and then sell it—what will be the value of P
^
0 in this case? Unless the
company is likely to be liquidated or sold and thus disappears, the value of the stock
is again determined by Equation 9.1. To see this, recognize that for any individual
investor, the expected cash flows consist of expected dividends plus the expected
sale price of the stock. However, the sale price to the current investor depends on
the dividends some future investor expects, and that investor’s expected sale price
is also dependent on some future dividends, and so forth. Therefore, for all
present and future investors in total, expected cash flows must be based on
expected future dividends. Put another way, unless a firm is liquidated or sold
to another concern, the cash flows it provides to its stockholders will consist only
of a stream of dividends. Therefore, the value of a share of stock must be
established as the present value of the stock’s expected dividend stream.4
4The general validity of Equation 9.1 can also be confirmed by asking yourself the following question:
Suppose I buy a stock and expect to hold it for 1 year. I will receive dividends during the year plus the
value ^P1 when I sell it at the end of the year. But what will determine the value of ^P1? The answer is
that it will be determined as the present value of the dividends expected during Year 2 plus the stock
price at the end of that year, which, in turn, will be determined as the present value of another set of
future dividends and an even more distant stock price. This process can be continued ad infinitum, and
the ultimate result is Equation 9.1.
We should note that investors periodically lose sight of the long-run nature of stocks as investments
and forget that in order to sell a stock at a profit, one must find a buyer who will pay the higher price.
If you analyze a stock's value in accordance with Equation 9.1, conclude that the stock's market price
exceeds a reasonable value, and buy the stock anyway, you would be following the “bigger fool” theory
of investment—you think you may be a fool to buy the stock at its excessive price; but you also believe
that when you get ready to sell it, you can find someone who is an even bigger fool. The bigger fool
theory was widely followed in the summer of 2000, just before the stock market crashed.

9-5 CONSTANT GROWTH STOCKS
Equation 9.1 is a generalized stock valuation model in the sense that the time
pattern of Dt can be anything: Dt can be rising, falling, or fluctuating randomly; or
it can be zero for several years. Equation 9.1 can be applied in any of these
situations; and with a computer spreadsheet, we can easily use the equation to
find a stock’s intrinsic value—provided we have an estimate of the future divi-
dends. However, it is not easy to obtain accurate estimates of future dividends.
Still, for many companies it is reasonable to predict that dividends will grow
at a constant rate. In this case, Equation 9.1 may be rewritten as follows:
P

The last term of Equation 9.2 is the constant growth model, or Gordon model,
named after Myron J. Gordon, who did much to develop and popularize it.5
The term rs in Equation 9.2 is the required rate of return, which is a riskless rate
plus a risk premium. However, we know that if the stock is in equilibrium, the
required rate of return must equal the expected rate of return, which is the
expected dividend yield plus an expected capital gains yield. So we can solve
Equation 9.2 for rs, but now using the hat to indicate that we are dealing with an
expected rate of return:6

5The last term in Equation 9.2 is derived in the Web Extension of Chapter 5 of Eugene F. Brigham and
Phillip R. Daves, Intermediate Financial Management, 11th edition (Mason, OH: South-Western/Cengage
Learning, 2013). In essence, Equation 9.2 is the sum of a geometric progression, and the final result is
the solution value of the progression.
6The rs value in Equation 9.2 is a required rate of return; but when we transform Equation 9.2 to obtain
Equation 9.3, we are finding an expected rate of return. Obviously, the transformation requires that rs = ^rs.
This equality must hold if the stock is in equilibrium, as most normally are.

9-5A ILLUSTRATION OF A CONSTANT GROWTH STOCK
Table 9.1 presents an analysis of Allied Food Products’ stock as performed by a
security analyst after a meeting for analysts and other investors presided over by
Allied’s CFO. The table looks complicated, but it is really quite straightforward.7
Part I, in the upper left corner, provides some basic data. The last dividend, which
was just paid, was $1 15; the stock’s last closing price was $23 06; and it is in
equilibrium. Based on an analysis of Allied’s history and likely future, the analyst
forecasts that earnings and dividends will grow at a constant rate of 8 3% per year
and that the stock’s price will grow at this same rate. Moreover, the analyst believes
that the most appropriate required rate of return is 13 7%. Different analysts might
use different inputs; but we assume for now that because this analyst is widely
followed, her results represent those of the marginal investor.

Look at Part IV, where we show the predicted stream of dividends and stock
prices along with annual values for the dividend yield, the capital gains yield,
and the expected total return. Notice that the total return shown in Column 6 is
equal to the required rate of return shown in Part I. This indicates that the stock
analyst thinks that the stock is fairly priced; hence, it is in equilibrium. She
forecasted data for 10 years, but she could have forecasted out to infinity.
Part II shows the formulas used to calculate the data in Part IV, and Part III
gives examples of the calculations. For example, D1, the first dividend a purchaser
would receive, is forecasted to be D1
$1 15 1 083
$1 25, and the other
forecasted dividends in Column 2 were calculated similarly. The estimated intrin-
sic values shown in Column 3 are based on Equation 9.2, the constant growth
model: P0

$1 25

ing), P

$24 98, and so forth.
Column 4 shows the dividend yield, which for 2015 is D1 P0
5 40%; and
this number is constant thereafter. The capital gain expected during 2015 is
P
^

P0
$24 98
$23 06
$1 92, which when divided by P0 gives the expected
capital gains yield, $1 92 $23 06
8 3%, again corrected for rounding. The total
return is found as the dividend yield plus the capital gains yield, 13 7%; and it is
both constant and equal to the required rate of return given in Part I.
Finally, look at Column 7 in the table. Here we find the present value of
each of the dividends shown in Column 2, discounted at the required rate of
return. For example, the PV of D1
$1 25
1 137 1
$1 10, the PV of D2
$1 35
1 137 2
$1 04, and so forth. If you extended the table out to about 170
years (with Excel, this is easy), then summed the PVs of the dividends, you would
obtain the same value as that found using Equation 9.2, $23 06.8 Figure 9.2 shows
graphically what’s happening. We extended the table out 20 years and then
plotted dividends from Column 2 in the upper step function curve and the PV
of those dividends in the lower curve. The sum of the PVs is an estimate of the
stock’s forecasted intrinsic value.
Note that in Table 9.1, the forecasted intrinsic value is equal to the current
stock price and the expected total return is equal to the required rate of return. In
this situation, the analyst would call the stock a “Hold” and would recommend
that investors not buy or sell it. However, if the analyst were somewhat more
optimistic and thought the growth rate would be 10 0% rather than 8 3%, the
forecasted intrinsic value would be (by Equation 9.2) $34 19 and the analyst
would call it a “Buy.” At g
6%, the intrinsic value would be $15 83 and the
stock would be a “Sell.” Changes in the required rate of return would produce
similar changes in the forecasted intrinsic value and thus the equilibrium current
price.
9-5B DIVIDENDS VERSUS GROWTH
The discounted dividend model as expressed in Equation 9.2 shows that, other
things held constant, a higher value for D1 increases a stock’s price. However,
Equation 9.2 shows that a higher growth rate also increases the stock’s price. But
now recognize the following:
•
Dividends are paid out of earnings.
•
Therefore, growth in dividends requires growth in earnings.
8The dividends get quite large, but the discount rate exceeds the growth rate; so the PVs of the
dividends become quite small. In theory, you would have to go out to infinity to find the exact price
of a constant growth stock, but the difference between the Equation 9.2 value and the sum of the PVs
can’t be seen out to 2 decimal places if you extend the analysis to 170 periods.

•
Earnings growth in the long run occurs primarily because firms retain
earnings and reinvest them in the business.
•
Therefore, the higher the percentage of earnings retained, the higher the
growth rate.
To illustrate this, suppose you inherit a business that has $1,000,000 of assets
and no debt, thus $1,000,000 of equity. The expected return on equity (ROE) equals
10 0%, so its expected earnings for the coming year are
0 10 $1,000,000
$100,000. You could take out the entire $100,000 of earnings in dividends, or you
could reinvest some or all of the $100,000 in the business. If you pay out all the
earnings, you will have $100,000 of dividend income this year, but dividends will
not grow because assets, and therefore earnings, will not grow.
However, suppose you decide to have the firm pay out 40% and retain 60%.
Now your dividend income in Year 1 will be $40,000; but assets will rise by
$60,000, and earnings and dividends will likewise increase:
Next year’s earnings

$100,000

This demonstrates that in the long run, growth in dividends depends primarily on
the firm’s payout ratio and its ROE.
In our example, we assumed that other things remain constant. This is often
but not always a logical assumption. For example, suppose the firm develops a
successful new product, hires a better CEO, or makes some other change that
increased the ROE. Any of these actions could cause the ROE to increase and thus
the growth rate to increase. Also note that the earnings of new firms are often low
or even negative for several years, and then begin to rise rapidly; finally, growth
levels off as the firm approaches maturity. Such a firm might pay no dividends for
its first few years, then pay a low initial dividend but let it increase rapidly, and
finally make regular payments that grow at a constant rate once earnings have
stabilized. In any such situation, the nonconstant model as discussed in a later
section must be used.
9-5C WHICH IS BETTER: CURRENT DIVIDENDS OR GROWTH?
We saw in the preceding section that a firm can pay a higher current dividend by
increasing its payout ratio, but that will lower its dividend growth rate. So the
firm can provide a relatively high current dividend or a high growth rate but not
both. This being the case, which would stockholders prefer? The answer is not
clear. As we will see in Chapter 14, some stockholders prefer current dividends
while others prefer a lower payout ratio and future growth. Empirical studies
have been unable to determine which strategy is optimal for maximizing a firm’s
stock price. So dividend policy is an issue that management must decide on the
basis of its judgment, not a mathematical formula. Logically, shareholders
should prefer for the company to retain more earnings (hence pay less current
dividends) if the firm has exceptionally good investment opportunities; how-
ever, shareholders should prefer a high payout if investment opportunities are
poor. In spite of this, taxes and other factors complicate the situation. We will
discuss all this in detail in Chapter 14; but for now, just assume that the firm’s
management has decided on a payout policy and uses that policy to determine
the actual dividend.
9-5D REQUIRED CONDITIONS FOR THE CONSTANT
GROWTH MODEL
Several conditions are necessary for Equation 9.2 to be used. First, the required
rate of return, rs, must be greater than the long-run growth rate, g. If the equation is
used in situations where g is greater than rs, the results will be wrong, meaningless, and
misleading. For example, if the forecasted growth rate in our example was 15% and
thus exceeded the 13 7% required rate of return, stock price as calculated by
Equation 9.2 would be a negative $101 73. That would be nonsense—stocks can’t
have negative prices. Moreover, in Table 9.1, the PV of each future dividend
would exceed that of the prior year. If this situation was graphed in Figure 9.2,
the step-function curve for the PV of dividends would be increasing, not decreas-
ing; so the sum would be infinitely high, which would indicate an infinitely high
stock price. Obviously, stock prices cannot be either infinite or negative, so
Equation 9.2 cannot be used unless rs
g.
Second, the constant growth model as expressed in Equation 9.2 is not appro-
priate unless a company’s growth rate is expected to remain constant in the future.
This condition almost never holds for new start-up firms, but it does exist for
many mature companies. Indeed, mature firms such as Allied and GE are gen-
erally expected to grow at about the same rate as nominal gross domestic product

(that is, real GDP plus inflation). On this basis, one might expect the dividends of
an average, or “normal,” company to grow at a rate of 5% to 8% a year.
Note too that Equation 9.2 is sufficiently general to handle the case of a zero
growth stock, where the dividend is expected to remain constant over time. If
g
0, Equation 9.2 reduces to Equation 9.5:

^

D
rs
9.5
This is the same equation as the one we developed in Chapter 5 for a perpetuity,
and it is simply the current dividend divided by the required rate of return.
Finally, as we discuss later in the chapter, most firms, even rapidly growing
start-ups and others that pay no dividends at present, can be expected to pay
dividends at some point in the future, at which time the constant growth model
will be appropriate. For such firms, Equation 9.2 is used as one part of a more
complicated valuation equation that we discuss next.
9-6 VALUING NONCONSTANT GROWTH STOCKS
For many companies, it is not appropriate to assume that dividends will grow at a
constant rate. Indeed, most firms go through life cycles where they experience
different growth rates during different parts of the cycle. In their early years, most
firms grow much faster than the economy as a whole; then they match the
economy’s growth; and finally they grow at a slower rate than the economy.9
Automobile manufacturers in the 1920s, computer software firms such as Micro-
soft in the 1990s, and Google in the 2000s are examples of firms in the early part of
their cycle. These firms are defined as supernormal, or nonconstant growth,
S E L F T E S T
Write out and explain the valuation formula for a constant growth stock.
Describe how the formula for a zero growth stock can be derived from the
formula for a normal constant growth stock.
Firm A is expected to pay a dividend of $1.00 at the end of the year. The
required rate of return is rs = 11%. Other things held constant, what would the
stock’s price be if the growth rate was 5%? What if g was 0%? ($16.67, $9.09)
Firm B has a 12% ROE. Other things held constant, what would its expected
growth rate be if it paid out 25% of its earnings as dividends? 75%? (9%, 3%)
If Firm B had a 75% payout ratio but then lowered it to 25%, causing its growth
rate to rise from 3% to 9%, would that action necessarily increase the price of its
stock? Why or why not?
Supernormal (Nonconstant)
Growth
The part of the firm’s life
cycle in which it grows
much faster than the
economy as a whole.
9The concept of life cycles could be broadened to product cycle, which would include both small start-
up companies and large companies such as Microsoft and Procter & Gamble, which periodically
introduce new products that give sales and earnings a boost. We should also mention business cycles,
which alternately depress and boost sales and profits. The growth rate just after a major new product
has been introduced (or just after a firm emerges from the depths of a recession) is likely to be much
higher than the “expected long-run average growth rate,” which is the proper number for use in the
discounted dividend model.
Zero Growth Stock
A common stock whose
future dividends are not
expected to grow at all;
that is, g = 0.

firms. Figure 9.3 illustrates nonconstant growth and compares it with normal
growth, zero growth, and negative (or declining) growth.10
In the figure, the dividends of the supernormal growth firm are expected to
grow at a 30% rate for three years, after which the growth rate is expected to fall to
8%, the assumed average for the economy. The value of this firm’s stock, like any
other asset, is the present value of its expected future dividends as determined by
Equation 9.1. When Dt is growing at a constant rate, we can simplify Equation 9.1
to Equation 9.2, P

g . In the supernormal case, however, the expected
growth rate is not a constant. In our example, there are two distinctly different
rates.
Because Equation 9.2 requires a constant growth rate, we obviously cannot use
it to value stocks that are not growing at a constant rate. However, assuming that
a company currently enjoying supernormal growth will eventually slow down
and become a constant growth stock, we can combine Equations 9.1 and 9.2 to
construct a new formula, Equation 9.6, for valuing the stock.
First, we assume that the dividend will grow at a nonconstant rate (generally
a relatively high rate) for N periods, after which it will grow at a constant rate, g.
N is often called the horizon, or terminal, date. Second, we can use the constant
growth formula, Equation 9.2, to determine what the stock’s horizon, or continu-
ing, value will be N periods from today:

10A negative growth rate indicates a declining company. A mining company whose profits are falling
because of a declining ore body is an example. Someone purchasing stock in such a company would
expect its earnings (and consequently its dividends and stock price) to decline each year, which
would lead to capital losses rather than capital gains. Obviously, a declining company's stock price
is relatively low, and its dividend yield must be high enough to offset the expected capital loss and still
produce a competitive total return. Students sometimes argue that they would never be willing to buy
a stock whose price was expected to decline. However, if the present value of the expected dividends
exceeds the stock price, the stock is still a good investment that would provide a good return.

count the cash flows.
N = years of nonconstant growth = 3.
gs = rate of growth in both earnings and dividends during the nonconstant
growth period = 30%. This rate is shown directly on the time line. (Note:
The growth rate during the nonconstant growth period could vary from
year to year. Also, there could be several different nonconstant growth
periods—for example, 30% for three years, 20% for the next three years,
and a constant 8% thereafter).
gn = rate of normal, constant growth after the nonconstant period = 8 0%.
This rate is also shown on the time line, after Year 3, when it is in effect.
D0 = last dividend the company paid = $1 15.
The valuation process diagrammed in Figure 9.4 is explained in the steps set
forth below the time line. The value of the nonconstant growth stock is calculated
as $39 21.

keep things simple. When evaluating stocks, most analysts use a longer horizon
(for example, 10 years) to estimate intrinsic values. This requires a few more

9-7 ENTERPRISE-BASED APPROACH TO VALUATION11
Thus far we have discussed the discounted dividend model for valuing a firm’s
common stock. This procedure is widely used, but it is based on the assumption
that the analyst can forecast future dividends reasonably well. This is often true
for mature companies that have a history of steadily growing dividends. How-
ever, dividends are dependent on earnings; so a reliable dividend forecast must be
based on an underlying forecast of the firm’s future sales, costs, and capital
EVALUATING STOCKS THAT DON’T PAY DIVIDENDS
The discounted dividend model assumes that the firm is
currently paying a dividend. However, many firms, even highly
profitable ones, including Google and Dell, have never paid a
dividend. If a firm is expected to begin paying dividends in the
future, we can modify the equations presented in the chapter
and use them to determine the value of the stock.
A new business often expects to have low sales during its
first few years of operation as it develops its product. Then if
the product catches on, sales will grow rapidly for several
years. Sales growth brings with it the need for additional
assets—a firm cannot increase sales without also increasing
its assets, and asset growth requires an increase in liability
and/or equity accounts. Small firms can generally obtain
some bank credit, but they must maintain a reasonable bal-
ance between debt and equity. Thus, additional bank borrow-
ings require increases in equity, and getting the equity capital
needed to support growth can be difficult for small firms.
They have limited access to the capital markets; and even
when they can sell common stock, their owners are reluctant
to do so for fear of losing voting control. Therefore, the best
source of equity for most small businesses is retained earn-
ings; for this reason most small firms pay no dividends during
their rapid growth years. Eventually, though, successful small
firms do pay dividends, and those dividends generally grow
rapidly at first but slow down to a sustainable constant rate
once the firm reaches maturity.
If a firm currently pays no dividends but is expected to
pay future dividends, the value of its stock can be found as
follows:
1.
Estimate at what point dividends will be paid, the
amount of the first dividend, the growth rate during
the supernormal growth period, the length of the
supernormal period, the long-run (constant) growth
rate, and the rate of return required by investors.
2.
Use the constant growth model to determine the stock
price after the firm reaches a stable growth situation.
3.
Set out on a time line the cash flows (dividends during
the supernormal growth period and the stock price once
the constant growth state is reached); then find the
present value of these cash flows. That present value
represents the value of the stock today.
To illustrate this process, consider the situation for Marvel-
Lure Inc., a company that was set up in 2013 to produce and
market a new high-tech fishing lure. Marvel-Lure’s sales are
currently growing at a rate of 200% per year. The company
expects to experience a high but declining rate of growth in
sales and earnings during the next 10 years, after which
analysts estimate that it will grow at a steady 10% per year.
The firm’s management has announced that it will pay no
dividends for 5 years but that if earnings materialize as
forecasted, it will pay a dividend of $0 20 per share at the
end of Year 6, $0 30 in Year 7, $0 40 in Year 8, $0 45 in Year
9, and $0 50 in Year 10. After Year 10, current plans are to
increase dividends by 10% per year.
Marvel-Lure’s investment bankers estimate that investors
require a 15% return on similar stocks. Therefore, we find the
value of a share of Marvel-Lure’s stock as follows:
P
^

$0
1 15 1

The last term finds the expected stock price in Year 10 and
then finds the present value of that price. Thus, we see that
the discounted dividend model can be applied to firms that
currently pay no dividends, provided we can estimate future
dividends with a fair degree of confidence. However, in
many cases, we can have more confidence in the forecasts
of free cash flows; and in these situations, it is better to use
the corporate valuation model.
11The corporate valuation model presented in this section is widely used by analysts, and it is in many
respects superior to the discounted dividend model. However, it is rather involved as it requires the
estimation of future sales, costs, and cash flows before the discounting process is begun. Therefore, in
the introductory course, some instructors may prefer to omit Section 9-7 and skip to Section 9-8.

requirements. This recognition has led to an alternative stock valuation approach,
the corporate valuation model.
Rather than starting with a forecast of dividends, the corporate valuation
model focuses on the firm’s future free cash flows. We discussed free cash flow
(FCF) in Chapter 3, where we developed the following equation:
FCF
EBIT 1
T
Depreciation
and amortization
Capital
expenditures
Net operating
working capital
EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, and free cash flow represents the cash
generated from current operations less the cash that must be spent on investments
in fixed assets and working capital to support future growth.
Consider the case of Home Depot (HD). The first term in brackets in the
preceding equation represents the amount of cash that HD is generating from its
existing stores. The second term represents the amount of cash the company plans
to spend this period to construct new stores. To open a new store, HD must spend
cash to purchase the land and construct the building—these are the capital
expenditures, and they lead to a corresponding increase in the firm’s fixed assets
as shown on the balance sheet. But HD also needs to increase its working capital,
especially inventory. Putting everything together, HD generates positive free cash
flow for its investors if and only if the money from its existing stores exceeds the
money required to build and equip its new stores.
9-7A THE CORPORATE VALUATION MODEL
In Chapter 3, we explained that a firm’s value is determined by its ability to
generate cash flow both now and in the future. Therefore, its market value can be
expressed as follows:
Market value
of company
VCompany
PV of expected future free cash flows
FCF1
1
WACC 1
FCF2
1
WACC 2
FCF∞
1
WACC ∞
9.7
Here FCFt is the free cash flow in Year t; and the discount rate, the WACC, is the
weighted average cost of all the firm’s capital. When thinking about the WACC,
note these two points:
1.
The firm finances with debt, preferred stock, and common equity. The WACC
is the weighted average of these three types of capital, and we discuss it in
detail in Chapter 10.
2.
Free cash flow is the cash generated before any payments are made to any
investors; so it must be used to compensate common stockholders, preferred
stockholders, and bondholders. Moreover, each type of investor has a required
rate of return; and the weighted average of those returns is the WACC, which
is used to discount the free cash flows.
Free cash flows are generally forecasted for 5 to 10 years, after which it is assumed
that the final explicitly forecasted FCF will grow at some long-run constant rate.
Once the company reaches its horizon date, when cash flows begin to grow at a
constant rate, we can use the following formula to calculate the market value of
the company as of that date:

Corporate Valuation Model
A valuation model used as
an alternative to the
discounted dividend
model to determine a
firm’s value, especially one
with no history of
dividends, or the value of
a division of a larger firm.
The corporate model first
calculates the firm’s free
cash flows, then finds their
present values to
determine the firm’s value.

•
Based on Allied’s history and Buskirk’s knowledge of the firm’s business plan,
she estimated sales, costs, and cash flows on an annual basis for 5 years.
Growth will vary during those years, but she assumes that things will stabilize
and growth will be constant after the fifth year. She would have made explicit
forecasts for more years if she thought it would take longer to reach a steady-
state, constant growth situation.
•
For each of the first five years, Buskirk paid particular attention to the key
variables that influence free cash flow. Specifically, she focused on EBIT,
required capital expenditures, and the anticipated changes in net operating
working capital (NOWC).
•
Buskirk next calculated the expected free cash flows (FCFs) for each of the 5
nonconstant growth years, and she found the PV of those cash flows
discounted at the WACC.
•
After Year 5, she assumed that FCF growth would be constant; hence, the
constant growth model could be used to find Allied’s total market value at
Year 5. This “horizon, or continuing, value” is the sum of the PVs of the FCFs
from Year 6 on out into the future, discounted back to Year 5 at the WACC. It
follows that: Horizon Valuet
5
FCF6
WACC–gFCF , where gFCF represents
the long-run growth rate of the free cash flow.
•
Next, she discounted the Year 5 horizon value back to the present to find its
PV at Year 0.
•
She then summed all the PVs, the annual cash flows during the nonconstant
period plus the PV of the horizon value, to find the firm’s estimated total
market value.
•
Then she subtracted the current market value of the debt and preferred stock
to find the value of Allied’s common equity.
Finally, she divided the equity value by the number of shares outstanding, and
the result was her estimate of Allied’s intrinsic value per share. This value was
quite close to the stock’s market price, so she concluded that Allied’s stock is
priced at its equilibrium level. Consequently, she issued a “Hold” recommenda-
tion on the stock. If the estimated intrinsic value had been significantly below the
market price, she would have issued a “Sell” recommendation; if the estimated
intrinsic value had been well above the market price, she would have called the
stock a “Buy.”
9-7B COMPARING THE CORPORATE VALUATION
AND DISCOUNTED DIVIDEND MODELS
Analysts use both the discounted dividend model and the corporate valuation
model when valuing mature, dividend-paying firms; and they generally use the
corporate model when valuing divisions and firms that do not pay dividends. In
principle, we should find the same intrinsic value using either model, but differ-
ences are often observed. When a conflict exists, the assumptions embedded in the
corporate model can be reexamined; and once the analyst is convinced they are
reasonable, the results of that model are used. In our Allied example, the estimates
were extremely close—the discounted dividend model predicted a price of $23 06
per share versus $23 38 using the corporate model; both are essentially equal to
Allied’s actual $23 06 price.
In practice, intrinsic value estimates based on the two models normally
deviate from one another and from actual stock prices, leading different analysts
to reach different conclusions about the attractiveness of a given stock. The better
the analyst, the more often his or her valuations turn out to be correct; but no one
can make perfect predictions because too many things can change randomly and

unpredictably in the future. Given all this, does it matter whether you use the
corporate model or the dividend model to value stocks? We would argue that it
does. If we had to value, for example, 100 mature companies whose dividends
were expected to grow steadily in the future, we would probably use the dis-
counted dividend model. Here we would estimate only the growth rate in
OTHER APPROACHES TO VALUING COMMON STOCKS
While the dividend growth and the corporate valuation
models presented in this chapter are the most widely used
methods for valuing common stocks, they are by no means
the only approaches. Analysts often use a number of differ-
ent techniques to value stocks. Two of these alternative
approaches are described here.
The P/E Multiple Approach
Investors have long looked for simple rules of thumb to
determine whether a stock is fairly valued. One such
approach is to look at the stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E)
ratio. Recall from Chapter 4 that a company’s P/E ratio shows
how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of
reported earnings. As a starting point, you might conclude
that stocks with low P/E ratios are undervalued because
their price is “low” given current earnings, while stocks with
high P/E ratios are overvalued.
Unfortunately, however, valuing stocks is not that simple.
We should not expect all companies to have the same P/E
ratio. P/E ratios are affected by risk—investors discount the
earnings of riskier stocks at a higher rate. Thus, all else equal,
riskier stocks should have lower P/E ratios. In addition, when
you buy a stock, you have a claim not only on current
earnings but also on all future earnings. All else equal,
companies with stronger growth opportunities will generate
larger future earnings and thus should trade at higher P/E
ratios. Therefore, Chipotle Mexican Grill is not necessarily
overvalued just because its P/E ratio is 39 2 at a time when
the median firm in its industry has a P/E of 23 5. Investors
believe that Chipotle’s growth potential is well above aver-
age. Whether the stock’s future prospects justify its P/E ratio
remains to be seen; but in and of itself, a high P/E ratio does
not mean that a stock is overvalued.
Nevertheless, P/E ratios can provide a useful starting point
in stock valuation. If a stock’s P/E ratio is well above its
industry average and if the stock’s growth potential and risk
are similar to other firms in the industry, the stock’s price
may be too high. Likewise, if a company’s P/E ratio falls well
below its historical average, the stock may be undervalued—
particularly if the company’s growth prospects and risk are
unchanged and if the overall P/E for the market has remained
constant or increased.
One obvious drawback of the P/E approach is that it
depends on reported accounting earnings. For this reason,
some analysts choose to rely on other multiples to value
stocks. For example, some analysts look at a company’s price-
to-cash-flow ratio, while others look at the price-to-sales ratio.
The EVA Approach
In recent years, analysts have looked for more rigorous alter-
natives to the discounted dividend model. More than a quar-
ter of all stocks listed on the NYSE pay no dividends. This
proportion is even higher on NASDAQ. While the discounted
dividend model can still be used for these stocks (see “Eval-
uating Stocks That Don’t Pay Dividends”), this approach
requires that analysts forecast when the stock will begin
paying dividends, what the dividend will be once it is estab-
lished, and what the future dividend growth rate will be. In
many cases, these forecasts contain considerable errors.
An alternative approach is based on the concept of Eco-
nomic Value Added (EVA), which we discussed in Chapter 3
and in the Chapter 4 box “Economic Value Added (EVA)
versus Net Income,” that can be written as follows:
EVA
Equity capital ROE
Cost of equity capital
This equation suggests that companies can increase their
EVA by investing in projects that provide shareholders with
returns that are above their cost of equity capital, which is
the return they could expect to earn on alternative invest-
ments with the same level of risk. When you purchase stock
in a company, you receive more than just the book value of
equity—you also receive a claim on all future value that is
created by the firm’s managers (the present value of all
future EVAs). It follows that a company’s market value of
equity can be written as follows:
Market value of equity
Book value
PV of all future EVAs
We can find the “fundamental” value of the stock, P0, by
simply dividing the preceding expression by the number of
shares outstanding.
As is the case with the discounted dividend model, we
can simplify the expression by assuming that at some point
in time, annual EVA becomes a perpetuity, or grows at some
constant rate over time. Presented here is a simplified version
of what is often referred to as the Edwards-Bell-Ohlson (EBO)
model. For a more complete description of this technique and
an excellent summary of how it can be used in practice, read
the article “Measuring Wealth,” by Charles M. C. Lee, in CA
Magazine, April 1996, pp. 32–37.

dividends, not the entire set of pro forma financial statements; hence, it would be
more feasible to use the dividend model.
However, if we were studying just one company or a few companies, espe-
cially companies still in the high-growth stage of their life cycles, we would want
to project future financial statements before estimating future dividends. Because
we would already have projected future financial statements, we would go ahead
and apply the corporate model. Intel, which pays a dividend of $0 90 versus
earnings of about $2 01, is an example of a company where either model could
be used; but we believe the corporate model is better.
Now suppose you were trying to estimate the value of a company such as
eBay that, to date (2013), has never paid a dividend or a new firm that is about to
go public. In either situation, you would be better off using the corporate valua-
tion model. Actually, even if a company is paying steady dividends, much can be
learned from the corporate model; so analysts today use it for all types of valua-
tions. The process of projecting future financial statements can reveal a great deal
about a company’s operations and financing needs. Also, such an analysis can
provide insights into actions that might be taken to increase the company’s value;
and for this reason, it is integral to the planning and forecasting process, as we
discuss in a later chapter.
9-8 PREFERRED STOCK12
Preferred stock is a hybrid—it is similar to a bond in some respects and to common
stock in others. This hybrid nature becomes apparent when we try to classify
preferred stock in relation to bonds and common stock. Like bonds, preferred
stock has a par value and a fixed dividend that must be paid before dividends can
be paid on the common stock. However, the directors can omit (or “pass”) the
preferred dividend without throwing the company into bankruptcy. So although
preferred stock calls for a fixed payment like bonds, skipping the payment will not
lead to bankruptcy.
As noted earlier, a preferred stock entitles its owners to regular, fixed divi-
dend payments. If the payments last forever, the issue is a perpetuity whose value,
Vp, is found as follows:

Why might someone use the corporate valuation model for companies that
have a history of paying dividends?
What steps are taken to find a stock price using the corporate model?
Why might the calculated intrinsic value differ from the stock’s current market
price? Which would be “correct,” and what does “correct” mean?

Management, 11th edition (Mason, OH: South-Western/Cengage Learning, 2013).

Vp is the value of the preferred stock, Dp is the preferred dividend, and rp is
the required rate of return on the preferred. Allied Food has no preferred out-
standing, but discussions about such an issue suggested that its preferred should
pay a dividend of $10 per year. If its required return was 10 3%, the preferred’s
value would be $97 09, found as follows:
Vp
$10 00
0 103
$97 09
In equilibrium, the expected return, ^rs, must be equal to the required return,
rp. Thus, if we know the preferred’s current price and dividend, we can solve for
the expected rate of return as follows:
^rp
Dp
Vp
9.9a
Some preferreds have a stated maturity, often 50 years. Assume that our
illustrative preferred matured in 50 years, paid a $10 annual dividend, and had
a required return of 8%. We could then find its price as follows: Enter N
50,
I YR

If rp rose to 10%, change I YR to 10, in which case Vp
PV
$100. If you know
the price of a share of preferred stock, you can solve for I YR to find the expected
rate of return, ^rp.
Corporate decisions should be analyzed in terms of how alternative courses of
action are likely to affect a firm’s value. However, it is necessary to know how stock
prices are established before attempting to measure how a given decision will
affect a specific firm’s value. This chapter discussed the rights and privileges of
common stockholders, showed how stock values are determined, and explained
how investors estimate stocks’ intrinsic values and expected rates of return.
Two types of stock valuation models were discussed: the discounted dividend
model and the corporate valuation model. The discounted dividend model is useful
for mature, stable companies. It is easier to use, but the corporate valuation model
is more flexible and better for use with companies that do not pay dividends or
whose dividends would be especially hard to predict.
We also discussed preferred stock, which is a hybrid security that has some
characteristics of a common stock and some of a bond. Preferreds are valued using
models similar to those for perpetual and “regular” bonds.

STOCK GROWTH RATES AND VALUATION
You are considering buying the stocks of two
companies that operate in the same industry. They have very similar characteristics except
for their dividend payout policies. Both companies are expected to earn $3 per share this
year; but Company D (for “dividend”) is expected to pay out all of its earnings as
dividends, while Company G (for “growth”) is expected to pay out only one-third of its
earnings, or $1 per share. D’s stock price is $25. G and D are equally risky. Which of the
following statements is most likely to be true?
a. Company G will have a faster growth rate than Company D. Therefore, G’s stock price
should be greater than $25.
b. Although G’s growth rate should exceed D’s, D’s current dividend exceeds that of G,
which should cause D’s price to exceed G’s.
c. A long-term investor in Stock D will get his or her money back faster because D pays
out more of its earnings as dividends. Thus, in a sense, D is like a short-term bond and
G is like a long-term bond. Therefore, if economic shifts cause rd and rs to increase, and
if the expected dividend streams from D and G remain constant, both Stocks D and G
will decline, but D’s price should decline further.
d. D’s expected and required rate of return is ^rs

NONCONSTANT GROWTH
Assume that it is now January 1, 2015. Wayne-Martin Electric
Inc. (WME) has developed a solar panel capable of generating 200% more electricity than
any other solar panel currently on the market. As a result, WME is expected to experience a
15% annual growth rate for the next 5 years. Other firms will have developed comparable
technology at the end of 5 years, and WME’s growth rate will slow to 5% per year
indefinitely. Stockholders require a return of 12% on WME’s stock. The most recent annual
dividend D0 , which was paid yesterday, was $1 75 per share.

price can be found by using the constant growth equation. Notice that to find
the December 31, 2019, price, you must use the dividend expected in 2020, which is
5% greater than the 2019 dividend.

have on the price of WME’s stock?
f.
Suppose your boss also tells you that she regards WME as being quite risky and that
she believes the required rate of return should be 14%, not 12%. Without doing any

run growth rate is 4%.

STOCK VALUATION
Robert Balik and Carol Kiefer are senior vice presidents of the Mutual of Chicago
Insurance Company. They are co-directors of the company’s pension fund management division, with
Balik having responsibility for fixed-income securities (primarily bonds) and Kiefer being responsible for
equity investments. A major new client, the California League of Cities, has requested that Mutual of
Chicago present an investment seminar to the mayors of the represented cities; and Balik and Kiefer, who
will make the actual presentation, have asked you to help them.
To illustrate the common stock valuation process, Balik and Kiefer have asked you to analyze the
Bon Temps Company, an employment agency that supplies word-processor operators and computer
programmers to businesses with temporarily heavy workloads. You are to answer the following
questions:
a. Describe briefly the legal rights and privileges of common stockholders.
b. 1. Write a formula that can be used to value any stock, regardless of its dividend pattern.
2. What is a constant growth stock? How are constant growth stocks valued?
3. What are the implications if a company forecasts a constant g that exceeds its rs? Will many stocks
have expected g
rs in the short run (that is, for the next few years)? In the long run (that is,
forever)?
c. Assume that Bon Temps has a beta coefficient of 1 2, that the risk-free rate (the yield on T-bonds) is
7%, and that the required rate of return on the market is 12%. What is Bon Temps’s required rate of
return?
d. Assume that Bon Temps is a constant growth company whose last dividend (D0, which was paid
yesterday) was $2 00 and whose dividend is expected to grow indefinitely at a 6% rate.
1. What is the firm’s expected dividend stream over the next 3 years?
2. What is its current stock price?
3. What is the stock’s expected value 1 year from now?
4. What are the expected dividend yield, capital gains yield, and total return during the first year?
e. Now assume that the stock is currently selling at $30 29. What is its expected rate of return?
f. What would the stock price be if its dividends were expected to have zero growth?
g. Now assume that Bon Temps is expected to experience nonconstant growth of 30% for the next
3 years, then return to its long-run constant growth rate of 6%. What is the stock’s value under these
conditions? What are its expected dividend and capital gains yields in Year 1? Year 4?
h. Suppose Bon Temps is expected to experience zero growth during the first 3 years and then resume
its steady-state growth of 6% in the fourth year. What would be its value then? What would be its
expected dividend and capital gains yields in Year 1? In Year 4?
i. Finally, assume that Bon Temps’s earnings and dividends are expected to decline at a constant rate
of 6% per year, that is, g
−6%. Why would anyone be willing to buy such a stock, and at what
price should it sell? What would be its dividend and capital gains yields in each year?
j. Suppose Bon Temps embarked on an aggressive expansion that requires additional capital. Manage-
ment decided to finance the expansion by borrowing $40 million and by halting dividend payments
to increase retained earnings. Its WACC is now 10%, and the projected free cash flows for the next
3 years are −$5 million, $10 million, and $20 million. After Year 3, free cash flow is projected to grow
at a constant 6%. What is Bon Temps’s total value? If it has 10 million shares of stock and $40 million
of debt and preferred stock combined, what is the price per share?
k. Suppose Bon Temps decided to issue preferred stock that would pay an annual dividend of $5 00
and that the issue price was $50 00 per share. What would be the stock’s expected return? Would the
expected rate of return be the same if the preferred was a perpetual issue or if it had a 20-year
maturity?

ESTIMATING EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION’S INTRINSIC STOCK VALUE
In this chapter, we described the various factors that influence stock prices and the approaches that
analysts use to estimate a stock’s intrinsic value. By comparing these intrinsic value estimates to the current
price, an investor can assess whether it makes sense to buy or sell a particular stock. Stocks trading at a
price far below their estimated intrinsic values may be good candidates for purchase, whereas stocks
trading at prices far in excess of their intrinsic value may be good stocks to avoid or sell. While estimating a
stock’s intrinsic value is a complex exercise that requires reliable data and good judgment, we can use the
data available in Thomson ONE to arrive at a quick “back-of-the-envelope” calculation of intrinsic value.
Discussion Questions
1.
For purposes of this exercise, let’s take a closer look at the stock of Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). Looking at
the COMPANY ANALYSIS OVERVIEW, we can see the company’s current stock price and its performance
relative to the overall market in recent months. What is Exxon Mobil’s current stock price? How has the stock
performed relative to the market over the past few months?
2.
Click on “NEWS & EVENTS” on the left-hand side of your screen to see the company’s recent news stories. Have
there been any recent events impacting the company’s stock price, or have things been relatively quiet?
3.
To provide a starting point for gauging a company’s relative valuation, analysts often look at a company’s price-
to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Return to the COMPANY OVERVIEW page. Here you can see XOM’s forward P/E ratio,
which uses XOM’s next 12-month estimate of earnings in the calculation. To see its current P/E ratio, click on
“FINANCIALS” (on the left-hand side of your screen), scroll down to “WORLDSCOPE” (under Financial Ratios
on the left-hand side of your screen), and click on “ANNUAL INCOME STATEMENT RATIOS." The firm’s
current P/E ratio is shown at the top right of your screen. What is the firm’s current P/E ratio?
4.
To put XOM’s P/E ratio in perspective, it is useful to see how this ratio has varied over time. Scroll down to the
Stock Performance section of this screen. The first two lines of this section show the firm’s P/E ratio using the
end-of-year closing price and the 5-year average over time. Is XOM’s current P/E ratio well above or well below
its latest 5-year average? Explain why the current P/E deviates from its historical trend. On the basis of this
information, does XOM’s current P/E suggest that the stock is undervalued or overvalued? Explain.
5.
To put the firm’s current P/E ratio in perspective, it is useful to compare this ratio with that of other companies in
the same industry. To see how XOM’s P/E ratio stacks up to its peers, click on “COMPARABLES” (left-hand side
of your screen). Scroll down and select “KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS." At the bottom of the table, you should see
information on the P/E ratio of each comparable company in the section titled “Market Value Ratios." For the
most part, is XOM’s P/E ratio above or below that of its peers? In Chapter 4, we discussed the various factors that
may influence P/E ratios. Can any of these factors explain why XOM’s P/E ratio differs from its peers? Explain. If
you want to compare XOM to a different set of firms, click on “CLICK TO SELECT NEW PEER SET." (This
appears toward the top of the screen.)
6.
In the text, we discussed using the discounted dividend model to estimate a stock’s intrinsic value. To keep things
as simple as possible, let’s assume at first that XOM’s dividend is expected to grow at a constant rate of 5%
annually over time. So, g
5%. If so, the intrinsic value equals D1
rs−g , where D1 is the expected annual
dividend 1 year from now, rs is the stock’s required rate of return, and g is the dividend’s constant growth rate.
Go back to the COMPANY OVERVIEW page. Select “FINANCIALS”; and under “FINANCIAL RATIOS,”
select “WORLDSCOPE” and “ANNUAL INCOME STATEMENT RATIOS.” On your screen at the bottom of the
Per Share Data section, you should see the firm’s annual dividend over the past several years. Multiply the prior
year’s dividend by 1
g to arrive at an estimate of D1.

7.
The required return on equity, rs, is the final input needed to estimate intrinsic value. For our purposes, you can
assume a number (say, 9% or 10%) or you can use the CAPM to calculate an estimate of the cost of equity using
the data available in Thomson ONE. (For more details, look at the Thomson ONE exercise for Chapter 8.) Having
decided on your best estimates for D1, rs, and g, you can calculate XOM’s intrinsic value. Be careful to make sure
that the long-run growth rate is less than the required rate of return. How does this estimate compare with the
current stock price? Does your preliminary analysis suggest that XOM is undervalued or overvalued? Explain.
8.
It is often useful to perform a sensitivity analysis, where you show how your estimate of intrinsic value varies
according to different estimates of D1, rs, and g. To do so, recalculate your intrinsic value estimate for a range of
different estimates for each of these key inputs. One convenient way to do this is to set up a simple data table in
Excel. Refer to the Excel tutorial accessed through the student companion website for instructions on data tables.
On the basis of this analysis, what inputs justify the current stock price?
9.
Until now, we have assumed that XOM’s dividend will grow at a long-run constant rate of 5% annually. To
gauge whether this is a reasonable assumption, it’s helpful to look at XOM’s dividend history. Go back to the
“Worldscope, Annual Income Statement Ratios” screen. At the bottom of the Per Share Data section, you should
see the firm’s annual dividend over the past several years. On the basis of this information, what has been the
average annual dividend growth rate?
Another way to obtain estimates of dividend growth rates is to look at analysts’ forecasts for future dividends,
which can be found under “ESTIMATES” (on the left-hand side of your screen). Near the top of that screen, you
should see an area marked “Consensus Estimates." Use the scroll bar to change from EPS estimates to DPS
estimates. What is the median year-end dividend forecast? Also notice that the last line of this area shows the
long-term growth rate (LTG). What is the median forecast of the company’s long-term growth rate? On the basis
of the dividend history you uncovered in Question 6 and your assessment of XOM’s future dividend payout
policies, do you think it is reasonable to assume that the constant growth model is a good proxy for intrinsic
value? If not, how would you use the available data in Thomson ONE to estimate intrinsic value using the
nonconstant growth model?
10.
Finally, you can also use the information in Thomson ONE to value the entire corporation. This approach requires
that you estimate XOM’s annual free cash flows. Once you estimate the value of the entire corporation, you
subtract the value of debt and preferred stock to arrive at an estimate of the company’s equity value. By dividing
this value by the number of shares of common stock outstanding, you calculate an alternative estimate of the
stock’s intrinsic value. While this approach may take additional time and involves more judgment concerning
forecasts of future free cash flows, you can use the financial statements and growth forecasts in Thomson ONE as
useful starting points.
Go to Worldscope’s Cash Flow Ratios Report (which you find by clicking on “FINANCIALS” under “FINAN-
CIAL RATIOS” click on “WORLDSCOPE” and “ANNUAL CASH FLOW RATIOS”). There you will find
historical annual free cash flow per share values. While these numbers are useful as a starting point to arrive at
an estimate for the next year, Worldscope’s definition of free cash flow subtracts out dividends per share.
Therefore, to make it comparable to the measure in this text, you must add back dividends. To see Worldscope’s
definition of free cash flow (or any term), go to the top of your screen and click on “GLOSSARY." A dialog box
will appear on the screen. Here, you can select the appropriate database (Worldscope is shown here now), and
then either enter the term or scroll down to find the term for which you are looking for the definition.

Stock Market Equilibrium
Recall that rx, the required return on Stock X, can be found using the Security
Market Line (SML) equation from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as
discussed in Chapter 8:
rX
rRF
rM −rRF bX
rRF
RPM bX
If the risk-free rate is 6%, the market risk premium is 5%, and Stock X has a beta of
2, the marginal investor will require a return of 16% on the stock:
rX
6%
5% 2 0
16%
This 16% required return is shown as the point on the SML in Figure 9A.1
associated with beta = 2 0. A marginal investor will purchase Stock X if its
expected return is more than 16%, will sell it if the expected return is less than
16%, and will be indifferent (will hold it but not buy or sell it) if the expected
return is exactly 16%.
9A-1 AN ILLUSTRATION
Now suppose the investor’s portfolio contains Stock X; he or she analyzes its
prospects and concludes that its earnings, dividends, and price can be expected to
grow at a constant rate of 5% per year. The last dividend was D0
$2 8571, so the
next expected dividend is as follows:
D1
$2 8571 1 05
$3 00
The investor observes that the stock price, P0, is $30. Should he or she buy more of
Stock X, sell the stock, or maintain the present position?
The investor can calculate Stock X’s expected rate of return as follows:

This value is plotted on Figure 9A.1 as Point X, which is below the SML. Because
the expected rate of return is less than the required return, he or she (and many
other investors) would want to sell the stock. However, few people would want
to buy at the $30 price; so the present owners would be unable to find buyers
unless they cut the stock price. Thus, the price would decline, and the decline
would continue until the price hit $27 27. At that point, the stock would be in
equilibrium, defined as the price at which the expected rate of return, 16%, is
equal to the required rate of return:

Had the stock initially sold for less than $27 27 (say, $25), events would have
been reversed. Investors would have wanted to purchase the stock because its
expected rate of return would have exceeded its required rate of return, buy
orders would have come in, and the stock’s price would have been driven up to
$27 27.
To summarize, in equilibrium, two related conditions must hold:
1.
A stock’s expected rate of return as seen by the marginal investor must equal
its required rate of return: ^ri
ri.
2.
The actual market price of the stock must equal its intrinsic value as estimated
by the marginal investor: P0

Of course, some individual investors may believe that ^ri

they would invest most of their funds in the stock), while other investors might
have an opposite view and sell all of their shares. However, investors at the margin

9A-2 CHANGES IN EQUILIBRIUM STOCK PRICES
Stock prices are not constant—they undergo violent changes at times. For exam-
ple, during the week of October 6, 2008, through October 10, 2008, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell more than 1,874 points representing an 18% decline. On
October 27, 1997, the Dow Jones Industrials fell 554 points, a 7 18% drop in value.
Even worse, on October 19, 1987, the Dow lost 508 points, causing an average
stock to lose 23% of its value on that one day, and some individual stocks lost
more than 70%. More recently, on August 8, 2011, the Dow lost 634 points,
representing a 5 55% drop in value.
To see what could cause such changes to occur, assume that Stock X is in
equilibrium, selling at a price of $27 27 per share. If all expectations were met
exactly, during the next year the price would gradually rise to $28 63, or by 5%.
However, suppose conditions changed as indicated in the second column of the
following table:

Evidence suggests that stocks, especially those of large companies, adjust
rapidly when their fundamental positions change. Such stocks are followed close-
ly by a number of security analysts; so as soon as things change, so does the stock
price. Consequently, equilibrium ordinarily exists for any given stock, and
required and expected returns are generally close to equal. Stock prices certainly
change, sometimes violently and rapidly; but this simply reflects changing condi-
tions and expectations. There are, of course, times when a stock will continue to
react for several months to unfolding favorable or unfavorable developments.
However, this does not signify a long adjustment period, it simply indicates that
as more new information about the situation becomes available, the market
adjusts to it.

RATES OF RETURN AND EQUILIBRIUM
Stock C’s beta coefficient is bC
0 4, while Stock
D’s is bD
0 5. (Stock D’s beta is negative, indicating that its return rises when returns on
most other stocks fall. There are very few negative beta stocks, although collection agency
stocks are sometimes cited as an example.)
1A price change of this magnitude is by no means rare. The prices of many stocks double or halve
during a year. For example, in 2012, Lumber Liquidators’ stock price increased by 199.2%. On the other
hand, Houston American Energy’s stock price declined by 98.2%.
2It should be obvious by now that actual realized rates of return are not necessarily equal to expected
and required returns. Thus, an investor might have expected to receive a return of 15% if he or she had
purchased Lumber Liquidators’ or Houston American Energy’s stock in 2012; but after the fact, the
realized return on Lumber Liquidators was far above 15%, whereas the return on Houston American
Energy was far below 15%.

EQUILIBRIUM STOCK PRICE
The risk-free rate of return, rRF, is 6%; the required rate of
return on the market, rM, is 10%; and Upton Company’s stock has a beta coefficient of 1 5.
a. If the dividend expected during the coming year, D1, is $2 25 and if g
a constant 5%,
at what price should Upton’s stock sell?
b. Now suppose the Federal Reserve Board increases the money supply, causing the risk-
free rate to drop to 5% and rM to fall to 9%. What would happen to Upton’s price?
c. In addition to the change in Part b, suppose investors’ risk aversion declines and this,
combined with the decline in rRF, causes rM to fall to 8%. Now what is Upton’s price?
d. Suppose Upton has a change in management. The new group institutes policies that
increase the expected constant growth rate from 5% to 6%. Also, the new management
smoothes out fluctuations in sales and profits, causing beta to decline from 1 5 to 1 3.
Assume that rRF and rM are equal to the values in Part c. After all these changes, what is
its new equilibrium price? (Note: D1 is now $2 27.)
9A-3
BETA COEFFICIENTS
Suppose Chance Chemical Company’s management conducted a
study and concluded that if it expands its consumer products division (which is less risky
than its primary business, industrial chemicals), its beta will decline from 1 2 to 0 9.
However, consumer products have a somewhat lower profit margin, and this would cause
its constant growth rate in earnings and dividends to fall from 6% to 4%. The following also
apply: rM
9%, rRF
6%, and D0

a. Should management expand the consumer products division? Explain.
b. Assume all the facts given except the change in the beta coefficient. How low would the
beta have to fall to cause the expansion to be a good one? (Hint: Set P

Creating Value at Disney
Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is one of the world’s most
successful companies. Despite a tough eco-
nomic environment over the past few years,
Disney’s managers have worked hard to create
value for shareholders by investing in assets
that earn more than the cost of the capital used
to acquire them. For example, if a project earns
20% but the capital invested in it costs only
10%, taking on the project will increase the
firm’s value and thus its stock price.
Capital is obtained in three primary forms:
debt, preferred stock, and common equity, with
equity acquired by retaining earnings and
issuing new stock. The investors who provide
capital to Disney expect to earn at least their
required rate of return on that capital, and the
required return represents the firm’s cost of
capital.1 A variety of factors influence the cost
of capital. Some—including interest rates, state
and federal tax policies, and general economic
conditions—are outside the firm’s control. How-
ever, the firm’s decisions regarding how it raises
capital and how it invests those funds also have
a profound effect on its cost of capital.
Estimating the cost of capital for a com-
pany such as Disney is conceptually straight-
forward. Disney’s capital comes from debt
plus common equity, so its cost of capital

1Recall from earlier chapters that expected and required returns as seen by the marginal investor must be equal;
otherwise, the security will not be in equilibrium. Therefore, buying and selling will force this equality to hold,
except for short periods immediately following the release of new information. Because expected and required
returns are normally equal, we use the two terms interchangeably.

depends largely on the level of interest rates in the econ-
omy and the marginal stockholder’s required rate of return
on equity. However, Disney operates many different divi-
sions throughout the world; so the corporation is similar to
a portfolio that contains a number of different stocks, each
with a different risk. Recall that portfolio risk is a weighted
average of the relevant risks of the different stocks in the
portfolio.
Similarly, each of Disney’s divisions has its own level of
risk, and hence, its own cost of capital. Therefore, Disney’s
overall cost of capital is a weighted average of its divisions’
costs. For example, Disney’s Media Networks’ segment (which
includes ABC and ESPN) probably has a different cost of
capital than its Parks and Resorts unit (which includes Disney
World Resort, Disneyland, and the Disney Cruise Line); and
even projects within divisions have different costs because
some projects are riskier than others. Moreover, its overseas
projects may have different risks and thus different costs of
capital than similar domestic projects. As we will see in this
chapter, the cost of capital is an essential element in a firm’s
capital budgeting process. This process is the primary deter-
minant of the firm’s long-run stock price.
In the last four chapters, we explained how risk influences prices and required
rates of return on bonds and stocks. A firm’s primary objective is to maximize
its shareholders’ value. The principal way value is increased is by investing in
projects that earn more than their cost of capital. In the next two chapters,
we will see that a project’s future cash flows can be forecasted and that those
cash flows can be discounted to find their present value. Then if the PV of the
future cash flows exceeds the project’s cost, the firm’s value will increase if
the project is accepted. However, we need a discount rate to find the PV of
these future cash flows, and that discount rate is the firm’s cost of capital.
Finding the cost of the capital required to take on new projects is the primary
focus of this chapter.2
Most formulas used in this chapter were developed earlier, when we exam-
ined the required rates of return on bonds and stocks in Chapters 7 and 9.
Indeed, the rates of return that investors require on bonds and stocks represent
the costs of those securities to the firm. As we shall see, companies estimate the
required returns on their securities, calculate a weighted average of the costs of
their different types of capital, and use this average cost for capital budgeting
purposes.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
• Explain why the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used in capital
budgeting.
• Estimate the costs of different capital components—debt, preferred stock,
retained earnings, and common stock.
• Combine the different component costs to determine the firm’s WACC.
These concepts are necessary to understand the firm’s capital budgeting
process.
2If projects differ in risk, risk-adjusted costs of capital should be used, not one single corporate cost of
capital. We discuss this point later in Section 10-9.

10-1 AN OVERVIEW OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF
CAPITAL (WACC)
Table 10.1 shows Allied Food Products’ balance sheet as presented in Chapter 3,
with three additions: (1) the actual capital supplied by investors (banks, bond-
holders, and stockholders) calculated using the accounting-based book values;
(2) the market values of the investor-supplied capital; and (3) the target capital
structure that Allied plans to use in the future.
When calculating the WACC, our concern is with capital that must be pro-
vided by investors—interest-bearing debt, preferred stock, and common equity.
Accounts payable and accruals, which arise spontaneously when capital budget-
ing projects are undertaken, are not included as part of investor-supplied
capital because they do not come directly from investors. Looking at Column 1
of Table 10.1, we see that using the accounting-based book values, Allied’s capital
consists of 47 8% debt and 52 2% equity.
While these accounting-based measures are important, Allied’s investors
are more concerned about the current market value of the company’s debt and
equity, which are shown in Column 2 of Table 10.1. To keep things relatively
simple, we assume that the market value of Allied’s debt is equal to its book value
(i.e., we assume that its average outstanding debt is trading at its par value).3 The

Notes:
1. The market value calculations assume that the company’s debt is trading at par, so the market value of debt equals the book value of debt.
2. The market value of equity is the share price of common stock multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. At 12/31/14, the firm has 50 million
shares outstanding and its stock sold for $23.06 per share.
3In practice, the market value of debt may be somewhat higher or lower than its book value,
depending on whether the outstanding bonds are trading at a premium or at a discount. Again, to
keep things simple, for our purposes we will generally assume that the market value of debt equals the
book value of debt when calculating the WACC.

market value of equity is the number of shares of stock outstanding multiplied by
the current stock price. Recall from Chapter 3, that Allied has 50 million shares of
common stock outstanding, and the company’s stock currently trades at $23 06
per share, which means that the market value of its equity is $1 153 billion.
Because the market value of its equity exceeds the book value of its equity, we
see that Allied’s market-based capital structure has a higher percentage of equity
57 3% than the capital structure that was calculated using its accounting-based
book values 52 2% .
While these market-based numbers are a useful starting point, what ulti-
mately matters is the target capital structure which refers to how Allied plans to
raise capital to fund its future projects. In Chapter 13, we explore in more detail
how companies determine their target capital structure. As we will see, there is
an optimal capital structure—one where the percentages of debt, preferred stock,
and common equity maximize the firm’s value. As shown in Column 3 of Table
10.1, Allied Food has concluded that its target capital structure should include
45% debt, 2% preferred stock, and 53% common equity; and in the future it plans
to raise capital in those proportions. Therefore, we use those target weights
when we calculate Allied’s weighted average cost of capital. It follows that
Allied’s overall cost of capital is a weighted average of the costs of the various
types of capital it uses, where the weights correspond to the company’s target
capital structure.
10-2 BASIC DEFINITIONS
The investor-supplied items—debt, preferred stock, and common equity—are
called capital components. Increases in assets must be financed by increases in
these capital components. The cost of each component is called its component cost;
for example, Allied can borrow money at 10%, so its component cost of debt is
10%.4 These costs are then combined to form a weighted average cost of capital,
which is used in the firm’s capital budgeting analysis. Throughout this chapter,
we concentrate on the three major capital components. The following symbols
identify the cost and weight of each:
rd
interest rate on the firm’s new debt = before-tax component cost
of debt. It can be found in several ways, including calculating
the yield to maturity on the firm’s currently outstanding bonds.
S E L F T E S T
When calculating WACC, what capital is excluded and why?
When calculating a company’s WACC, should book value, market value, or target
weights be used? Explain.
Why might the weights of capital be different depending on whether book
values, market values, or target values are used?
4We will see shortly that there is a before-tax and an after-tax cost of debt; for now, it is sufficient to
know that 10% is the before-tax component cost of debt. Also, for simplicity, we assume that long- and
short-term debt have the same cost; hence, we deal with just one type of debt.
Target Capital Structure
The mix of debt, preferred
stock, and common equity
the firm plans to raise to
fund its future projects.

average cost of capital. As we shall see, the after-tax cost of debt is
lower than its before-tax cost because interest is tax deductible.

component cost of preferred stock, found as the yield investors
expect to earn on the preferred stock. Preferred dividends are
not tax deductible; hence, the before- and after-tax costs of

rs
component cost of common equity raised by retaining
earnings, or internal equity. It is the rs developed in Chapters 8
and 9 and defined there as the rate of return that investors
require on a firm’s common stock. Most firms, once they have
become well established, obtain all of their new equity as
retained earnings; hence, rs is their cost of all new equity.
re
component cost of external equity, or common equity raised by
issuing new stock. As we will see, re is equal to rs plus a factor
that reflects the cost of issuing new stock. Note, though, that
established firms such as Allied Food rarely issue new stock;
hence, re is rarely a relevant consideration except for very
young, rapidly growing firms.

target weights of debt, preferred stock, and common equity
(which includes retained earnings, internal equity, and new

actual current weights.5
WACC = the firm’s weighted average, or overall, cost of capital.
The target proportions of debt

wp , and common
equity wc , along with the costs of those components, are used to calculate the
firm’s weighted average cost of capital, WACC. We assume at this point that all
new common equity is raised as retained earnings, as is true for most companies;
hence, the cost of common equity is rs.

Note that only debt has a tax adjustment factor, 1

section, this is because interest on debt is tax deductible but preferred dividends
and the returns on common stock (dividends and capital gains) are not.
These definitions and concepts are discussed in the remainder of the chapter,
using Allied Food for illustrative purposes. Later in Chapter 13, we extend the
discussion to show how the optimal mix of securities minimizes the firm’s cost of
capital and maximizes its value.
Weighted Average Cost of
Capital (WACC)
A weighted average of the
component costs of debt,
preferred stock, and
common equity.
5We should also note that the weights could be based on the book values of the capital components or
on their market values. The market value of the equity is found by multiplying the stock’s price by the
number of shares outstanding. Market-value weights are theoretically superior; but accountants show
assets on a book-value basis; bond rating agencies and security analysts generally focus on book
values, and market-value weights are quite unstable because stock prices fluctuate widely. If a firm’s
book and market values differ widely, the firm may set its target weights as a blend of book and market
weights. We discuss this at greater length in Chapter 13; but for now, just take the target weights
provided in this chapter as management determined.

10-3 COST OF DEBT, rd 1
T
The interest rate a firm must pay on its new debt is defined as its before-tax cost of
debt, rd. Firms can estimate rd by asking their bankers what it will cost to borrow
or by finding the yield to maturity on their currently outstanding debt (as we
illustrated in Chapter 7). However, the after-tax cost of debt, should be used to
calculate the weighted average cost of capital. This is the interest rate on new debt,
rd, less the tax savings that result because interest is tax deductible:6

In effect, the government pays part of the cost of debt because interest is tax
deductible. Therefore, if Allied can borrow at an interest rate of 10% and its
marginal federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%, its after-tax cost of debt will be 6%.7

We use the after-tax cost of debt in calculating the WACC because we are inter-
ested in maximizing the value of the firm’s stock, and the stock price depends on
after-tax cash flows. Because we are concerned with after-tax cash flows and
because cash flows and rates of return should be calculated on a comparable basis,
we adjust the interest rate downward due to debt’s preferential tax treatment.8
It is important to emphasize that the cost of debt is the interest rate on new
debt, not outstanding debt. We are interested in the cost of new debt because our

6If Allied borrowed $100,000 at 10%, it would have to write a check for $10,000 to pay annual interest
charges. However, that $10,000 would be a tax deduction, which at a 40% tax rate would save $4,000
annually in taxes. The tax rate is zero for a firm with losses. Therefore, for a company that does not pay
taxes, the cost of debt is not reduced. In Equation 10.2, if the tax rate is zero, the after-tax cost of debt is
not reduced and is simply equal to the before-tax cost of debt.
7Note that in 2013, the federal tax rate for most large corporations is 35%. However, most corporations
are also subject to state income taxes; so for illustrative purposes, we assume that the effective federal-
plus-state tax rate on marginal income is 40%.
8Strictly speaking, the after-tax cost of debt should reflect the expected cost of debt. While Allied’s bonds
have a promised return of 10%, there is some chance of default, so its bondholders’ expected return
(and consequently Allied’s cost) is a bit less than 10%. For a relatively strong company such as Allied,
this difference is quite small. As we discuss later in the chapter, Allied must also incur flotation costs
when it issues debt, but like the difference between the promised and the expected rates of return,
flotation costs for debt are generally small. Finally, note that these two factors tend to offset one
another—not including the possibility of default leads to an overstatement of the cost of debt, but not
including flotation costs leads to an understatement. For all these reasons, rd is generally a good
approximation of the before-tax cost of debt capital and rd(1 −T) of the after-tax cost.

primary concern with the cost of capital is its use in capital budgeting decisions.
For example, would a new machine earn a return greater than the cost of the
capital needed to acquire the machine? The rate at which the firm has borrowed in
the past is irrelevant when answering this question because we need to know the
cost of new capital. For these reasons, the yield to maturity on outstanding debt (which
reflects current market conditions) is a better measure of the cost of debt than the coupon
rate. Note that if the yield curve is upward- or downward-sloping, the cost of long-
and short-term debt will differ. In these cases, the yield to maturity on the
company’s long-term debt is generally used to calculate the cost of debt because,
more often than not, the capital is being raised to fund long-term projects.9
However, as we see in Chapter 15, some companies regularly use a mix of short-
term and long-term debt to finance their projects. When calculating their costs of
debt, these companies may choose to calculate an average of their debt costs based
on the proportion of long- and short-term debt that they plan to use.
10-4 COST OF PREFERRED STOCK, rp
The component cost of preferred stock, rp, used to calculate the weighted average
cost of capital is the preferred dividend, Dp, divided by the current price of the
preferred stock, Pp.

Allied does not have any preferred stock outstanding, but the company plans to
issue some in the future and therefore has included it in its target capital structure.
Allied would sell this stock to a few large hedge funds, the stock would have a
$10 00 dividend per share, and it would be priced at $97 50 a share. Therefore,
Allied’s cost of preferred stock would be 10 3%:10

Why is the after-tax cost of debt rather than the before-tax cost used to calculate
the WACC?
Why is the relevant cost of debt the interest rate on new debt, not that on
already outstanding, or old, debt?
How can the yield to maturity on a firm’s outstanding debt be used to estimate
its before-tax cost of debt?
A company has outstanding 20-year noncallable bonds with a face value of
$1,000, an 11% annual coupon, and a market price of $1,294.54. If the company
was to issue new debt, what would be a reasonable estimate of the interest rate
on that debt? If the company’s tax rate is 40%, what is its after-tax cost of debt?
(8.0%; 4.8%)
9To get a true measure of the cost of debt, you should use the yield to maturity on outstanding debt
that is noncallable and not convertible to common stock.
10This preferred stock would be sold directly to a group of hedge funds, so no flotation costs would be
incurred. If significant flotation costs were involved, the cost of the preferred should be adjusted
upward, as we explain in a later section.

As we can see from Equation 10.3, calculating the cost of preferred stock is easy.
This is particularly true for traditional “plain vanilla” preferred that pays a fixed
dividend in perpetuity. However, in Chapter 9, we noted that some preferred issues
have a specified maturity date and we described how to calculate the expected
return on these issues. Also, preferred stock may include an option to convert to
common stock, which adds another layer of complexity. We leave these more
complicated situations for advanced classes. Finally, note that no tax adjustments
are made when calculating rp because preferred dividends, unlike interest on debt,
are not tax deductible; so no tax savings are associated with preferred stock.
10-5 THE COST OF RETAINED EARNINGS, rs
The costs of debt and preferred stock are based on the returns that investors
require on these securities. Similarly, the cost of common equity is based on the
rate of return that investors require on the company’s common stock. Note,
though, that new common equity is raised in two ways: (1) by retaining some
of the current year’s earnings and (2) by issuing new common stock.11 We use the
symbol rs to designate the cost of retained earnings and re to designate the cost of
new common stock, or external equity. Equity raised by issuing stock has a higher
cost than equity from retained earnings due to the flotation costs required to sell
new common stock. Therefore, once firms get beyond the start-up stage, they
normally obtain all of their new equity by retaining earnings.
Some have argued that retained earnings should be “free” because they
represent money that is “left over” after dividends are paid. While it is true that
no direct costs are associated with retained earnings, this capital still has a cost,
an opportunity cost. The firm’s after-tax earnings belong to its stockholders.
Bondholders are compensated by interest payments; preferred stockholders, by
preferred dividends. But the net earnings remaining after paying interest and
preferred dividends belong to the common stockholders, and these earnings serve
to compensate them for the use of their capital. The managers, who work for the
stockholders, can either pay out earnings in the form of dividends or retain
earnings for reinvestment in the business. When managers make this decision,
they should recognize that there is an opportunity cost involved—stockholders
S E L F T E S T
Is a tax adjustment made to the cost of preferred stock? Why or why not?
A company’s preferred stock currently trades at $80 per share and pays a $6 annual
dividend per share. Ignoring flotation costs, what is the firm’s cost of preferred
stock? (7.50%)

11The term retained earnings can be interpreted to mean the balance sheet account retained earnings,
consisting of all the earnings retained in the business throughout its history or the income statement
item addition to retained earnings. The income statement item is relevant in this chapter. For our purpose,
retained earnings refers to that part of the current year’s earnings not paid as dividends (hence, available
for reinvestment in the business this year). If this is not clear, look back at Allied’s balance sheet shown
in Table 3.1 and note that at the end of 2013, Allied had $750 million of retained earnings; but that
figure rose to $810 million by the end of 2014. Then look at the 2014 income statement, where you will
see that Allied retained $60 million of its 2014 income. This $60 million was the new equity from
retained earnings that was used, along with some additional debt, to fund the 2014 capital budgeting
projects. Also, you can see from the 2013 and 2014 balance sheets that Allied had $130 million of
common stock at the end of both years. This indicates that it did not issue (sell) any new common stock
to raise capital during 2014.

could have received the earnings as dividends and invested this money in other
stocks, in bonds, in real estate, or in anything else. Therefore, the firm needs to earn at
least as much on any earnings retained as the stockholders could earn on alternative
investments of comparable risk.
What rate of return can stockholders expect to earn on equivalent-risk invest-
ments? First, recall from Chapter 9 that stocks are normally in equilibrium, with
expected and required rates of return equal: ^rs
rs. Thus, Allied’s stockholders
expect to be able to earn rs on their money. Therefore, if the firm cannot invest
retained earnings to earn at least rs, it should pay those funds to its stockholders and let
them invest directly in stocks or other assets that will provide that return.
Whereas debt and preferred stocks are contractual obligations whose costs are
clearly stated within the contracts, stocks have no comparable stated cost rate.
That makes it difficult to measure rs. However, we can employ the techniques
developed in Chapters 8 and 9 to produce reasonably good estimates of the cost of
equity from retained earnings. To begin, recall that if a stock is in equilibrium, its
required rate of return, rs, must be equal to its expected rate of return, rs. Further,
its required return is equal to a risk-free rate, rRF, plus a risk premium, RP, whereas
the expected return on the stock is its expected dividend yield, D1 P0, plus its
expected growth rate, g. Thus, we can write the following equation and estimate rs
using the left term, the right term, or both terms:
Required rate of return
Expected rate of return
rs
rRF
RP
D1 P0
g
^rs
10.4
The left term is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, and the right term is based on the discounted dividend model
as developed in Chapter 9. We discuss these two procedures, in addition to one
based on the firm’s own cost of debt, in the following sections.
10-5A THE CAPM APPROACH
The most widely used method for estimating the cost of common equity is the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as developed in Chapter 8.12 Here are the
steps used to find rs:
Step 1: Estimate the risk-free rate, rRF. We generally use the 10-year Treasury
bond rate as the measure of the risk-free rate, but some analysts use the
short-term Treasury bill rate.
Step 2: Estimate the stock’s beta coefficient, bi, and use it as an index of the
stock’s risk. The i signifies the ith company’s beta.
Step 3: Estimate the market risk premium. Recall that the market risk premium
is the difference between the return that investors require on an average
stock and the risk-free rate.13
12A recent survey by John Graham and Campbell Harvey indicates that the CAPM approach is most
often used to estimate the cost of equity. More than 70% of the surveyed firms used the CAPM
approach. In some cases, they used beta from the CAPM as one determinant of rs, but they also
added other factors thought to improve the estimate. For more details, see John R. Graham and
Campbell R. Harvey, “The Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance: Evidence from the Field,”
Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 60, nos. 2 and 3 (May–June 2001), pp. 187–243, for the survey, and
Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, “Common Risk Factors in the Return on Stocks and Bonds,”
Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 33, no. 1 (1993), pp. 3–56.
13It is important to be consistent in the use of a long-term versus a short-term rate for rRF and for the
market risk premium. The market risk premium (RPM = rM −rRF) depends on the measure used for
the risk-free rate. The yield curve is normally upward-sloping, so the 10-year Treasury bond rate
normally exceeds the short-term Treasury bill rate. In this case, it follows that one will obtain a lower
estimate of the market risk premium if the higher longer-term bond rate is used as the risk-free rate. At
any rate, the rRF used to find the market risk premium should be the same as the rRF used as the first
term in the CAPM equation.

Step 4: Substitute the preceding values in the CAPM equation to estimate the
required rate of return on the stock in question:
rs
rRF
RPM bi
rRF
rM
rRF bi
10.5
Thus, the CAPM estimate of rs is equal to the risk-free rate, rRF, plus a risk premium
that is equal to the risk premium on an average stock, rM −rRF , scaled up or down
to reflect the particular stock’s risk as measured by its beta coefficient, bi.
Assume that in today’s market, rRF
5 6%, the market risk premium is
RPM
5 0%, and Allied’s beta is 1 48. Using the CAPM approach, Allied’s cost
of equity is estimated to be 13 0%:
rs
5 6%
5 0% 1 48
13 0%
Although the CAPM appears to produce an accurate, precise estimate of rs,
several potential problems exist. First, as we saw in Chapter 8, if a firm’s stock-
holders are not well diversified, they may be concerned with stand-alone risk rather
than just market risk. In that case, the firm’s true investment risk would not be
measured by its beta and the CAPM estimate would understate the correct value
of rs. Further, even if the CAPM theory is valid, it is hard to obtain accurate
estimates of the required inputs because (1) there is controversy about whether
to use long-term or short-term Treasury yields for rRF, (2) it is hard to estimate
the beta that investors expect the company to have in the future, and (3) it is
difficult to estimate the proper market risk premium. As we indicated earlier, the
CAPM approach is used most often; but because of the just-noted problems,
analysts also estimate the cost of equity using the other approaches discussed in
the following sections.
10-5B BOND-YIELD-PLUS-RISK-PREMIUM APPROACH
In situations where reliable inputs for the CAPM approach are not available,
as would be true for a closely held company, analysts often use a somewhat
subjective procedure to estimate the cost of equity. Empirical studies suggest
that the risk premium on a firm’s stock over its own bonds generally ranges from
3 to 5 percentage points.14 Based on this evidence, one might simply add a
judgmental risk premium of 3% to 5% to the interest rate on the firm’s own
long-term debt to estimate its cost of equity. Firms with risky, low-rated, and
consequently high-interest-rate debt also have risky, high-cost equity; and the
procedure of basing the cost of equity on the firm’s own readily observable debt
cost utilizes this logic. For example, given that Allied’s bonds yield 10%, its cost of
equity might be estimated as follows:
rs
Bond yield
Risk premium
10 0%
4 0%
14 0%
The bonds of a riskier company might have a higher yield, 12%, in which case the
estimated cost of equity would be 16%:
rs
12 0%
4 0%
16 0%
14Ibbotson Associates, a well-known research firm, has calculated the historical returns on common
stocks and on corporate bonds and used the differential as an estimate of the historical risk premium of
stocks over corporate bonds. Historical risk premiums vary from year to year, but a range of 3% to 5%
is common. Also, analysts have calculated the CAPM-required return on equity for publicly traded
firms in a given industry, averaged them, subtracted those firms’ average bond yield, and used the
differential as an expected risk premium. Again, these risk premium estimates are often generally in the
3% to 5% range.

Because the 4% risk premium is an estimate based on judgment, the esti-
mated value of rs is also judgmental. Therefore, one might use a range of 3% to
5% for the risk premium and obtain a range of 13% to 15% for Allied. While this
method does not produce a precise cost of equity, it should “get us in the right
ballpark.”
10-5C DIVIDEND-YIELD-PLUS-GROWTH-RATE, OR DISCOUNTED
CASH FLOW (DCF), APPROACH
In Chapter 9, we saw that both the price and the expected rate of return on a share
of common stock depend, ultimately, on the stock’s expected cash flows. For
companies that are expected to remain in business indefinitely, the cash flows
are the dividends; on the other hand, if investors expect the firm to be acquired
by some other company or to be liquidated, the cash flows will be dividends for
some number of years plus a price at the horizon date when the firm is expected
to be acquired or liquidated. Like most firms, Allied is expected to continue
indefinitely, in which case the following equation applies:

10.6
Here P0 is the current stock price, Dt is the dividend expected to be paid at the end
of Year t, and rs is the required rate of return. If dividends are expected to grow at
a constant rate, as we saw in Chapter 9, Equation 10.6 reduces to this important
formula:15
P0
D1
rs
g
10.7
We can solve for rs to obtain the required rate of return on common equity,
which for the marginal investor is also equal to the expected rate of return:
rs
^rs
D1
P0
Expected g
10.8
Thus, investors expect to receive a dividend yield, D1/P0, plus a capital gain, g, for
a total expected return of ^rs; and in equilibrium, this expected return is also equal
to the required return, rs. This method of estimating the cost of equity is called the
discounted cash flow, or DCF, method. Henceforth, we will assume that equilibrium
exists, which permits us to use the terms rs and ^rs interchangeably.
It is easy to calculate the dividend yield; but because stock prices fluctuate, the
yield varies from day to day, which leads to fluctuations in the DCF cost of equity.
Also, it is difficult to determine the proper growth rate. If past growth rates in
earnings and dividends have been relatively stable and if investors expect a
continuation of past trends, g may be based on the firm’s historic growth rate.
However, if the company’s past growth has been abnormally high or low due to a unique
situation or because of general economic fluctuations, investors will not project historical
growth rates into the future. In this case, which applies to Allied, g must be obtained
in some other manner.
Security analysts regularly forecast growth rates for earnings and dividends,
looking at such factors as projected sales, profit margins, and competition.
For example, Value Line Investment Survey, which is available in most libraries,
15If the growth rate is not expected to be constant, the DCF procedure can still be used to estimate rs;
but in this case, it is necessary to calculate an average growth rate using the procedures described in
this chapter’s Excel model.

provides growth rate forecasts for 1,700 companies; Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse,
Morgan Stanley, and other organizations make similar forecasts. Averages of
these forecasts are available on Yahoo! Finance and other websites. Therefore,
someone estimating a firm’s cost of equity can obtain analysts’ forecasts and use
them as a proxy for the growth expectations of investors in general. Then they can
combine this g with the current dividend yield to estimate ^rs:
^rs
D1
P0
Growth rate as projected by security analysts
Again, note that this estimate of ^rs is based on the assumption that g is expected to
remain constant in the future. Otherwise, we must use an average of expected
future rates.16
To illustrate the DCF approach, Allied’s stock sells for $23 06, its next
expected dividend is $1 25, and analysts expect its growth rate to be 8 3%. Thus,
Allied’s expected and required rates of return (hence, its cost of retained earnings)
are estimated to be 13 7%:
^rs
rs
$1 25
$23 06
8 3%
5 4%
8 3%
13 7%
Based on the DCF method, 13 7% is the minimum rate of return that should be
earned on retained earnings to justify plowing earnings back into the business
rather than paying them out to shareholders as dividends. Put another way,
because investors are thought to have an opportunity to earn 13 7% if earnings
are paid out as dividends, the opportunity cost of equity from retained earnings
is 13 7%.
10-5D AVERAGING THE ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATES
In our examples, Allied’s estimated cost of equity was 13 0% by the CAPM, 14 0%
by the bond-yield-plus-risk premium method, and 13 7% by the DCF method.
Which method should the firm use? If management has confidence in one method,
it would probably use that method’s estimate alone. Otherwise, it might use some
weighted average of the three methods.
As consultants, we have estimated companies’ costs of capital on numerous
occasions. We generally take into account all three methods, but we rely most
heavily on the method that seems best under the circumstances. Judgment is
important and comes into play here, as is true for most decisions in finance. Also,
we recognize that our final estimate will almost certainly be incorrect to some
extent.17 Therefore, we always provide a range and state that in our judgment, the
16Analysts’ growth rate forecasts are usually for 5 years into the future, and the rates provided
represent the average growth rate over that 5-year horizon. Studies have shown that analysts’
forecasts represent the best source of growth rate data for DCF cost of capital estimates. See Robert
Harris, “Using Analysts’ Growth Rate Forecasts to Estimate Shareholder Required Rates of Return,”
Financial Management (Spring 1986), pp. 58–67.
Two organizations—IBES and Zacks—collect the forecasts of leading analysts for most larger
companies, average these forecasts, and publish the averages. The IBES and Zacks data are available
through online computer data services.
17Investment bankers are generally regarded as experts on concepts such as the cost of capital, and they
are paid big salaries for their analyses. But those investment bankers aren’t always accurate. To
illustrate, the stock price of the fifth-largest investment bank, Bear Stearns, closed on Friday, March
14, 2008, at $30. Its employees owned 33% of the stock. On Sunday, in a special meeting, its board of
directors agreed to sell the company to JPMorgan for $2 per share. Bear Stearns was eventually sold to
JPMorgan for $10 per share in 2008, and it has since discontinued the use of the Bear Stearns name. As
you can see, even investment bankers don’t always get it right, so don’t expect precision unless you are
given a set of numbers and told to do some relatively simple calculations.

cost of equity is within that range. For Allied, we used a range of 13% to 14%; the
company then used 13 5% as the estimate of its cost of retained earnings when it
calculated its WACC:
Final estimate of rs used to calculate Allied’s WACC: 13 5%
10-6 COST OF NEW COMMON STOCK, re
Companies generally use an investment banker when they issue new common
stock and sometimes when they issue preferred stock or bonds. In return for a fee,
investment bankers help the company structure the terms, set a price for the issue,
and sell the issue to investors. The bankers’ fees are called flotation costs, and
the total cost of the capital raised is the investors’ required return plus the
flotation cost.
For most firms at most times, equity flotation costs are not an issue because
most equity comes from retained earnings. Therefore, in our discussion to this
point, we have ignored flotation costs. However, flotation costs can often be
substantial. So if a firm does plan to issue new stock, these costs should not be
ignored. When firms use investment bankers to raise capital, two approaches can
be used to account for flotation costs.18 We describe them in the next two sections.
10-6A ADD FLOTATION COSTS TO A PROJECT’S COST
In the next chapter, we show that capital budgeting projects typically involve an
initial cash outlay followed by a series of cash inflows. One approach to handling
flotation costs, found as the sum of the flotation costs for the debt, preferred, and
common stock used to finance the project, is to add this sum to the initial
investment cost. Because the investment cost is increased, the project’s expected
rate of return is reduced. For example, consider a 1-year project with an initial cost
(not including flotation costs) of $100 million. After 1 year, the project is expected
to produce an inflow of $115 million. Therefore, its expected rate of return is
$115 $100

10-6B INCREASE THE COST OF CAPITAL
The second approach involves adjusting the cost of capital rather than increasing
the project’s investment cost. If the firm plans to continue using the capital in the
future, as is generally true for equity, this second approach theoretically will be
better. The adjustment process is based on the following logic. If there are flotation
costs, the issuing firm receives only a portion of the capital provided by investors,
with the remainder going to the underwriter. To provide investors with their
required rate of return on the capital they contributed, each dollar the firm
actually receives must “work harder”; that is, each dollar must earn a higher rate
of return than the investors’ required rate of return. For example, suppose inves-
tors require a 13 7% return on their investment, but flotation costs represent 10%
of the funds raised. Therefore, the firm actually keeps and invests only 90% of the
amount that investors supplied. In that case, the firm must earn about 14 3% on
the available funds in order to provide investors with a 13 7% return on their
investment. This higher rate of return is the flotation-adjusted cost of equity.
The DCF approach can be used to estimate the effects of flotation costs. Here
is the equation for the cost of new common stock, re:

Here F is the percentage flotation cost required to sell the new stock, so P0 1
F
is the net price per share received by the company.
Assuming that Allied has a flotation cost of 10%, its cost of new common
equity, re, would be calculated as follows:

$20 75

This is 0 6% higher than the previously estimated 13 7% DCF cost of equity, so the
flotation cost adjustment is 0 6%:

The 0 6% flotation cost adjustment can be added to the previously estimated

approaches), resulting in a cost of equity from new common stock, or external
equity, of 14 1%:

If Allied earns 14 1% on funds obtained from selling new stock, the investors who
purchased that stock will end up earning 13 5%, their required rate of return, on
the money they invested. If Allied earns more than 14 1%, its stock price should
rise; but the price should fall if Allied earns less than 14 1%.19

the dollars of flotation costs are deducted from the price of the security, PP for preferred stock and
$1,000 for bonds issued at par. Then for preferred, the cost is found using Equation 10.9 with g = 0. For
bonds, we find the YTM based on the net proceeds received, $1,000 −Flotation costs. (For example, the
net proceeds would be $970 if flotation costs are 3% of the issue price.)

10-6C WHEN MUST EXTERNAL EQUITY BE USED?
Because of flotation costs, dollars raised by selling new stock must “work
harder” than dollars raised by retaining earnings. Moreover, because no
flotation costs are involved, retained earnings cost less than new stock. There-
fore, firms should utilize retained earnings to the greatest extent possible.
However, if a firm has more good investment opportunities than can be
financed with retained earnings plus the debt and preferred stock supported
by those retained earnings, it may need to issue new common stock. The total
amount of capital that can be raised before new stock must be issued is
defined as the retained earnings breakpoint, and it can be calculated as
follows:
Retained earnings
breakpoint
Addition to retained earnings for the year
Equity fraction
10.10
Allied’s addition to retained earnings in 2015 is expected to be $66 million (as
we will see later in Chapter 16); and its target capital structure consists of 45%
debt, 2% preferred, and 53% equity. Therefore, its retained earnings breakpoint for
2015 is as follows:
Retained earnings breakpoint
$66 0 53
$124 5 million
To prove that this is correct, note that a capital budget of $124 5 million could be
financed as 0 45
124 5
56 million of debt, 0 02
124 5
2 5 million of pre-
ferred stock, and 0 53
124 5
66 million of equity raised from retained earn-
ings. Up to a total of $124 5 million of new capital raised for the capital budget will
not exhaust the addition to retained earnings, so equity would have a cost of
rs
13 5%. However, if the capital budget exceeded $124 5 million the addition to
retained earnings would be exhausted, and Allied would have to obtain equity by
issuing new common stock at a cost of re
14 1%.20

What are the two approaches that can be used to adjust for flotation costs?

opportunities? Explain.

to finance its capital budget using a target capital structure of 46% debt,
3% preferred, and 51% common equity. How large could its capital budget be
before it must issue new common stock? ($196.08 million)
20This breakpoint is only suggested—it is not written in stone. For example, rather than issuing new
common stock, the company could use more debt (hence, increase its debt ratio) or it could increase its
addition to retained earnings by reducing its dividend payout ratio. Both actions would change the
retained earnings breakpoint. Also, breakpoints could occur due to increases in the costs of debt and
preferred. Indeed, a number of changes could occur; and the end result would be a large number of
potential breakpoints.

10-7 COMPOSITE, OR WEIGHTED AVERAGE, COST OF CAPITAL, WACC
Allied’s target capital structure calls for 45% debt, 2% preferred stock, and 53%
common equity. Earlier we saw that its before-tax cost of debt is 10 0%, its after-
tax cost of debt is rd 1
T
10% 0 6
6 0%, its cost of preferred stock is 10 3%,
its cost of common equity from retained earnings is 13 5%, and its marginal tax
rate is 40%. Equation 10.1, presented earlier, can be used to calculate its WACC
when all of the new common equity comes from retained earnings:
WACC

wprp
wcrs
0 45 10% 0 6
0 02 10 3%
0 53 13 5%
10 1% if equity comes from retained earnings
Under these conditions, every dollar of new capital that Allied raises would consist
of 45 cents of debt with an after-tax cost of 6%, 2 cents of preferred stock with a cost of
10 3%, and 53 cents of common equity from additions to retained earnings with a
cost of 13 5%. The average cost of each whole dollar, or the WACC, would be 10 1%.
This estimate of Allied’s WACC assumes that common equity comes exclu-
sively from retained earnings. If, instead, Allied had to issue new common stock,
its WACC would be slightly higher because of the additional flotation costs.

In Web Appendix 10A, we discuss in more detail the connection between the
firm’s WACC and the costs of issuing new common stock.
10-8 FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE WACC
The cost of capital is affected by a number of factors. Some are beyond the firm’s
control, but others can be influenced by its financing and investment decisions.
10-8A FACTORS THE FIRM CANNOT CONTROL
The three most important factors that the firm cannot directly control are interest
rates in the economy, the general level of stock prices, and tax rates. If interest rates
in the economy rise, the cost of debt increases because the firm must pay
bondholders more when it borrows. Similarly, if stock prices in general decline,

million and each having an expected rate of return of 8.25%. Firm A’s retained
earnings breakpoint is $196.08 million. The firm’s WACC using retained earnings
is 8.2% but increases to 8.5% if new equity must be issued. The company invests
in projects where the expected return exceeds the cost of capital. How much
capital should Firm A raise and invest? Why? ($196.08 million; the 11th project
would have a higher WACC than its expected rate of return.)

pulling the firm’s stock price down, its cost of equity will rise. Also, because tax
rates are used in the calculation of the component cost of debt, they have an
important effect on the firm’s cost of capital. Taxes also affect the cost of capital in
other less apparent ways. For example, when tax rates on dividends and capital
gains were lowered relative to rates on interest income, stocks became relatively
more attractive than debt; consequently, the cost of equity and WACC declined.
10-8B FACTORS THE FIRM CAN CONTROL
A firm can directly affect its cost of capital in three primary ways: (1) by changing
its capital structure, (2) by changing its dividend payout ratio, and (3) by altering its
capital budgeting decision rules to accept projects with more or less risk than projects
previously undertaken.
SOME REAL-WORLD ESTIMATES OF THE WACC
In the table below, we have summarized quick estimates
(done in May 2013) of the WACC for some leading companies.
Our calculations were based on the following assumptions:
1.
We did not have access to the company’s internal target
capital structure forecasts, so we used the current
market-value weights for debt and equity as the capital
structure weights. For simplicity, we assumed that the
market value of the company’s debt equaled the book
value of debt (as estimated by Value Line Investment
Survey). The market value of equity is the company’s
stock
price
multiplied
by
the
number
of
shares
outstanding. The market equity weight and the market
debt weight are the percentage of capital (on a market
basis) coming from equity and debt respectively. Note
that the firms in this table do not use preferred stock, so
we can eliminate the preferred stock term in the WACC
equation.
2.
The yield to maturity of the company’s debt was
compiled
from
the
Financial
Industry
Regulatory
Authority (FINRA), which is the largest independent
securities
regulator
in
the
United
States.
Where
available, we selected an outstanding bond issue with
a maturity of 10 years or more. The income tax rate was
obtained from Value Line Investment Survey. The after-tax
cost of debt is the yield to maturity multiplied by one
minus the company’s tax rate.
3.
The risk-free rate approximates the yield to maturity on
10-year government debt. We assumed a market risk
premium of 6 0%, and we used the CAPM to estimate
the cost of equity. The stock’s betas were obtained from
Value Line Investment Survey.
4.
The WACC was calculated as follows:
WACC
Market debt weight
After-tax cost of debt
Market equity weight
CAPM cost of equity
As expected, companies in more stable businesses (Camp-
bell Soup, Walmart, and Coca-Cola) have the lowest WACC
estimates, whereas companies in riskier industries (Boeing,
Disney, Apple, and Marriott) have higher WACC estimates.
While these quick estimates can give you a broad sense of
the WACC for each of these companies, you should recog-
nize that these calculations are very sensitive to changes in
the underlying assumptions. For example, if we assume a
higher or lower market risk premium, or use a different
source to estimate betas, we can often arrive at significantly
different estimates for these WACCs.

Capital structure impacts a firm’s cost of capital. So far we have assumed that
Allied has a given target capital structure, and we used the target weights to
calculate its WACC. However, if the firm changes its target capital structure, the
weights used to calculate the WACC will change. Other things held constant, an
increase in the target debt ratio tends to lower the WACC (and vice versa if the
debt ratio is lowered) because the after-tax cost of debt is lower than the cost of
equity. However, other things are not likely to remain constant. An increase in the
use of debt will increase the riskiness of both the debt and the equity, and these
increases in component costs might more than offset the effects of the changes in
the weights and raise the WACC. In Chapter 13, we will discuss how a firm can
try to balance these effects to reach its optimal capital structure.
Dividend policy affects the amount of retained earnings available to the firm
and thus the need to sell new stock and incur flotation costs. This suggests that the
higher the dividend payout ratio, the smaller the addition to retained earnings, the
higher the cost of equity, and therefore the higher the firm’s WACC will be.
However, investors may prefer dividends to retained earnings, in which case
reducing dividends might lead to an increase in both rs and re. As we will see in
Chapter 14, the optimal dividend policy is a complicated issue, but one that can
have an important effect on the cost of capital.
The firm’s capital budgeting decisions can also affect its cost of capital. When
we estimate the firm’s cost of capital, we use as the starting point the required
rates of return on its outstanding stock and bonds. These cost rates reflect the
riskiness of the firm’s existing assets. Therefore, we have been implicitly assuming
that new capital will be invested in assets that have the same risk as existing
assets. This assumption is generally correct, as most firms do invest in assets
similar to ones they currently operate. However, if the firm decides to invest in
an entirely new and risky line of business, its component costs of debt and equity
(and thus its WACC) will increase.
10-9 ADJUSTING THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR RISK
As you will see in Chapters 11 and 12, the cost of capital is a key element in
the capital budgeting process. Projects should be accepted if and only if
their estimated returns exceed their costs of capital. Thus, the cost of capital is a
“hurdle rate”—a project’s expected rate of return must “jump the hurdle” for it to
be accepted. Moreover, investors require higher returns on riskier investments.
Consequently, companies that are raising capital to take on risky projects will
have higher costs of capital than companies that are investing in safer projects.
Figure 10.1 illustrates the trade-off between risk and the cost of capital. Firm L
is in a low-risk business and has a WACC of 8%. Firm A is an average-risk
business with a WACC of 10%, while Firm H’s business is exposed to greater risk
and consequently has a WACC of 12%. Thus, Firm L will accept a typical project if

its expected return is above 8%. Firm A’s hurdle rate is 10%, while the correspond-
ing hurdle rate for Firm H is 12%.
It’s important to remember that the costs of capital for Firms L, A, and H in
Figure 10.1 represent the overall, or composite, WACCs for the three firms and
thus apply only to “typical” projects for each firm. However, different projects
often have different risks, even for a given firm. Therefore, each project’s hurdle rate
should reflect the risk of the project, not the risk associated with the firm’s average project
as reflected in its composite WACC. Empirical studies do indicate that firms consider
the risks of individual projects, but the studies also indicate that most firms regard
most projects as having about the same risk as the firm’s average existing assets.
Therefore, the WACC is used to evaluate most projects; but if a project has an
especially high or low risk, the WACC will be adjusted up or down to account for
the risk differential.
For example, assume that Firm A (the average-risk firm with a composite
WACC of 10%) has two divisions, L and H. Division L has relatively little risk; and
if it were operated as a separate firm, its WACC would be 7%. Division H has higher
risk, and its divisional cost of capital is 13%. Because the two divisions are of equal
size, Firm A’s composite WACC is calculated as 0 50 7%
0 50 13%
10%. How-
ever, it would be a mistake to use this 10% WACC for either division. To see
this point, assume that Division L is considering a relatively low-risk project
with an expected return of 9%, while Division H is considering a higher-risk
project with an expected return of 11%. As shown in Figure 10.2, Division L’s
project should be accepted because its return is above its risk-based cost of
capital, whereas Division H’s project should be rejected. If the 10% corporate
WACC was used by each division, the decision would be reversed: Division H
would incorrectly accept its project, and Division L would incorrectly reject its
project. In general, failing to adjust for differences in risk would lead the firm to
accept too many risky projects and reject too many safe ones. Over time, the firm
would become riskier, its WACC would increase, and its shareholder value
would suffer. We return to these issues in Chapter 12, when we consider
different approaches for measuring project risk.

10-10 SOME OTHER PROBLEMS WITH COST OF CAPITAL
ESTIMATES
A number of issues related to the cost of capital have not been mentioned or were
glossed over in this chapter. These topics are covered in advanced finance courses,
but they deserve mention now to alert you to potential dangers and to provide a
preview of some matters covered in advanced courses.
1.
Depreciation-generated funds.21 The largest single source of capital for many
firms is depreciation, yet we have not discussed how the cost of this capital is
determined. In brief, depreciation cash flows can either be reinvested or
returned to investors (stockholders and creditors). The cost of depreciation-
generated funds is thus an opportunity cost; and it is approximately equal to
the WACC from retained earnings, preferred stock, and debt. Therefore, we
can ignore it in our estimate of the WACC.

2.
Privately owned firms. Our discussion of the cost of equity focused on
publicly owned corporations, and we have concentrated on the rate of
return required by public stockholders. However, there is a serious
question about how to measure the cost of equity for a firm whose stock
is not traded. Tax issues are also especially important in these cases.
As a general rule, the same principles of cost of capital estimation apply
to both privately held and publicly owned firms, but the problems of
obtaining input data are somewhat different.
3.
Measurement problems. We cannot overemphasize the practical difficulties
encountered when estimating the cost of equity. It is very difficult to
obtain good input data for the CAPM, for g in the formula ^rs
D1 P0
g,
and for the risk premium in the formula rs = Bond yield + Risk premium.
As a result, we can never be sure of the accuracy of our estimated cost of
capital.
4.
Costs of capital for projects of differing risk. We touched briefly on the fact that
different projects can differ in risk and, thus, in their required rates of return.
However, it is difficult to measure a project’s risk (hence, to adjust the cost of
capital for capital budgeting projects with different risks).
5.
Capital structure weights. In this chapter, we took as given the target capital
structure and used it to calculate the WACC. As we shall see in Chapter 13,
establishing the target capital structure is a major task in itself.
Although this list of problems appears formidable, the state of the art in cost
of capital estimation is not in bad shape. The procedures outlined in this
chapter can be used to obtain costs of capital estimates that are sufficiently
accurate for practical purposes, so the problems listed previously merely
indicate the desirability of refinements. The refinements are not unimportant,
but the problems noted do not invalidate the usefulness of the procedures
outlined in this chapter.
We began this chapter by discussing the concept of the weighted average cost of
capital. We then discussed the three major capital components (debt, preferred
stock, and common equity) and the procedures used to estimate each component’s
cost. Next, we calculated the WACC, which is a key element in capital budgeting. A
key issue here is the weights that should be used to find the WACC. In general,
companies consider a number of factors and then establish a target capital struc-

its affect on the WACC in more detail in Chapter 13.
The cost of capital is a key element in capital budgeting decisions, our focus in
the following chapters. Indeed, capital budgeting as it should be done is impos-
sible without a good estimate of the cost of capital; so you need to have a good
understanding of cost of capital concepts before you continue to the next chapter,
where we discuss capital budgeting basics.

Skye’s earnings per share last year were $3 20. The common stock sells for $55 00, last year’s
dividend (D0) was $2 10, and a flotation cost of 10% would be required to sell new common stock.
Security analysts are projecting that the common dividend will grow at an annual rate of 9%.
Skye’s preferred stock pays a dividend of $3 30 per share, and its preferred stock sells for $30 00
per share. The firm’s before-tax cost of debt is 10%, and its marginal tax rate is 35%. The firm’s
currently outstanding 10% annual coupon rate long-term debt sells at par value. The market risk
premium is 5%, the risk-free rate is 6%, and Skye’s beta is 1 516. The firm’s total debt, which is the
sum of the company’s short-term debt and long-term debt, equals $1 2 million.
a. Calculate the cost of each capital component, that is, the after-tax cost of debt, the cost of
preferred stock, the cost of equity from retained earnings, and the cost of newly issued
common stock. Use the DCF method to find the cost of common equity.
b. Now calculate the cost of common equity from retained earnings using the CAPM method.

COST OF CAPITAL
Coleman Technologies is considering a major expansion program that has been
proposed by the company’s information technology group. Before proceeding with the expansion, the
company must estimate its cost of capital. Suppose you are an assistant to Jerry Lehman, the financial
vice president. Your first task is to estimate Coleman’s cost of capital. Lehman has provided you with the
following data, which he believes may be relevant to your task.
•
The firm’s tax rate is 40%.
•
The current price of Coleman’s 12% coupon, semiannual payment, noncallable bonds with 15 years
remaining to maturity is $1,153 72. Coleman does not use short-term interest-bearing debt on a
permanent basis. New bonds would be privately placed with no flotation cost.
•
The current price of the firm’s 10%, $100 00 par value, quarterly dividend, perpetual preferred stock
is $111 10.
•
Coleman’s common stock is currently selling for $50 00 per share. Its last dividend D0 was $4 19,
and dividends are expected to grow at a constant annual rate of 5% in the foreseeable future.
Coleman’s beta is 1 2, the yield on T-bonds is 7%, and the market risk premium is estimated to be
6%. For the bond-yield-plus-risk-premium approach, the firm uses a risk premium of 4%.
•
Coleman’s target capital structure is 30% debt, 10% preferred stock, and 60% common equity.
To structure the task somewhat, Lehman has asked you to answer the following questions.
a. 1. What sources of capital should be included when you estimate Coleman’s WACC?
2. Should the component costs be figured on a before-tax or an after-tax basis?
3. Should the costs be historical (embedded) costs or new (marginal) costs?
b. What is the market interest rate on Coleman’s debt and its component cost of debt?
c. 1. What is the firm’s cost of preferred stock?

common stock, considering the flotation cost?
j. What is Coleman’s overall, or weighted average, cost of capital (WACC)? Ignore flotation costs.
k. What factors influence Coleman’s composite WACC?
l. Should the company use the composite WACC as the hurdle rate for each of its projects? Explain.

CALCULATING 3M’S COST OF CAPITAL
In this chapter, we described how to estimate a company’s WACC, which is the weighted average of its
costs of debt, preferred stock, and common equity. Most of the data we need to do this can be found in
Thomson ONE. Here we walk through the steps used to calculate Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing’s
(MMM) WACC.
Discussion Questions
1.
As a first step, we need to estimate what percentage of MMM’s capital comes from debt, preferred stock, and
common equity. If we click on “FINANCIALS,” we can see from the balance sheet the amount of MMM’s short-
term debt, long-term debt, and common equity. (As of year-end 2012, MMM had no preferred stock.) Alternatively,
under “Financial Ratios,” you can click on “WORLDSCOPE” and “ANNUAL BALANCE SHEET RATIOS.” Here
you will find a recent measure of total debt as a percentage of total capital. Here, total debt includes all interest-
bearing debt and is the sum of short-term debt and long-term debt.
a.
Recall that the weights used in the WACC are based on the company’s target capital structure. If we assume
that the company wants to maintain the same mix of capital that it currently has on its balance sheet, what
weights should you use to estimate the WACC for MMM?
b.
From the COMPANY OVERVIEW screen, you can find MMM’s market capitalization, which is the market
value of its common equity. Using the sum of its short-term debt and long-term debt from the balance sheet
(we assume that the market value of its debt equals its book value) and its market capitalization, recalculate
the firm’s debt and common equity weights to be used in the WACC equation. These weights are
approximations of market-value weights. Be sure not to include accruals in the debt calculation.

2.
Once again we can use the CAPM to estimate MMM’s cost of equity. Thomson ONE provides various estimates of
beta—select the measure that you think is best and combine this with your estimates of the risk-free rate and the
market risk premium to obtain an estimate of its cost of equity. (See the Thomson ONE exercise in Chapter 8 for
more details.) What is your estimate for MMM’s cost of equity? Why might it not make much sense to use the DCF
approach to estimate MMM’s cost of equity?
3.
Next, we need to calculate MMM’s cost of debt. Unfortunately, Thomson ONE doesn’t provide a direct measure of
the cost of debt. However, we can use different approaches to estimate it. One approach is to take the company’s
interest expense and divide it by total debt (which is the sum of short-term debt and long-term debt). This
approach only works if the historical cost of debt equals the yield to maturity in today’s market (that is, if
MMM’s outstanding bonds are trading at close to par). This approach may produce misleading estimates in
years in which MMM issues a significant amount of new debt. For example, if a company issues a great deal of
debt at the end of the year, the full amount of debt will appear on the year-end balance sheet, yet we still may not
see a sharp increase in interest expense on the annual income statement because the debt was outstanding for only
a small portion of the entire year. When this situation occurs, the estimated cost of debt will likely understate the
true cost of debt. Another approach is to try to find this number in the notes to the company’s annual report by
accessing the company’s home page and its Investor Relations section. Alternatively, you can go to other external
sources, such as bondsonline.com, for corporate bond spreads, which can be used to find estimates of the cost of
debt. Remember that you need the after-tax cost of debt to calculate a firm’s WACC, so you will need MMM’s tax
rate (which has averaged about 30% in recent years). What is your estimate of MMM’s after-tax cost of debt?

Competition in the Aircraft Industry: Airbus vs. Boeing
For the last several years, Boeing has been
involved in a titanic struggle with European con-
sortium Airbus (a unit of the European Aeronau-
tic Defence & Space Co., EADS) for dominance in
the commercial aircraft industry.1 Recently, the
battle has centered on what a correspondent for
Airchive.com has characterized as the “War of the
Wide Bodies.” Boeing’s entry in this battle is its
787 Dreamliner. To compete with the Dreamliner,
Airbus is expected to soon unveil the A350 XWB
(where XWB stands for extra-wide body).
As you might expect, these projects require
billions of dollars of capital to develop, and
along the way, the companies make many
detailed calculations when forecasting crucial
factors such as development costs, operating
costs, and anticipated demand. Typically in
these types of projects, Boeing and Airbus pro-
ject negative cash flows for the first 5 or 6 years,
and then positive cash flows for the following
20 years. Given their forecasted cash flows, both
managements decided that taking on the proj-
ects would increase each company’s intrinsic
value. But given the inherent risks in this busi-
ness and the fact that the planes will compete
with one another, both Boeing’s and Airbus’s
financial analysts recognized that their forecasts
were subject to considerable errors.

create an organization large enough to compete with Boeing.

unusual for their planes to be over budget and behind
schedule. In a recent high-profile example, Boeing was
forced to temporarily ground its Dreamliner planes because
in two instances a key battery produced by one of its
suppliers had caught on fire. To its credit, the company
was able to quickly provide a fix to the problem, and it has
maintained strong orders along the way. At the same time,
Boeing and Airbus are facing new competition from other
companies, such as Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of
Brazil who have focused on smaller more energy-efficient
jets that are increasingly in demand. This shift in the com-
petitive environment has forced Boeing and Airbus to
rethink the types of projects they want to invest in during
the next decade.
Projects such as the Dreamliner and A350 XWB receive a
great deal of attention; but Boeing, Airbus, and other compa-
nies make a great many routine investment decisions every
year, ranging from buying new trucks or machinery to pur-
chasing computers and software to optimize inventory man-
agement. While each project has its own unique character-
istics, the same techniques described in this chapter are used
to analyze projects of all types and sizes.

In the last chapter, we discussed the cost of capital. Now we turn to investment decisions
involving fixed assets, or capital budgeting. Here capital refers to long-term assets used in
production, while a budget is a plan that outlines projected expenditures during some
future period. Thus, the capital budget is a summary of planned investments in long-term
assets, and capital budgeting is the whole process of analyzing projects and deciding
which ones to include in the capital budget. Boeing, Airbus, and other companies use
the techniques in this chapter when deciding to accept or reject proposed capital
expenditures.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Discuss capital budgeting.
•
Calculate and use the major capital budgeting decision criteria, which are NPV, IRR,
MIRR, and payback.
•
Explain why NPV is the best criterion and how it overcomes problems inherent in the
other methods.
With an understanding of the theory of capital budgeting developed in this chapter,
which uses simplified examples, you will be ready for the next chapter, where we discuss
how cash flows are estimated, how risk is measured, and how capital budgeting decisions
are made.
11-1 AN OVERVIEW OF CAPITAL BUDGETING
The same concepts used in security valuation are also used in capital budgeting, but
there are two major differences. First, stocks and bonds exist in the security markets, and
investors select from the available set; firms, however, create capital budgeting projects.

Second, for most securities, investors have no influence on the cash flows pro-
duced by their investments, whereas corporations have a major influence on
projects’ results. Still, in both security valuation and capital budgeting, we forecast
a set of cash flows, find the present value of those flows, and make the investment
only if the PV of the inflows exceeds the investment’s cost.
A firm’s growth, and even its ability to remain competitive and to survive,
depends on a constant flow of ideas relating to new products, to improvements in
existing products, and to ways of operating more efficiently. Accordingly, well-
managed firms go to great lengths to develop good capital budgeting proposals.
For example, the executive vice president of one successful corporation said that
his company takes the following steps to generate projects:
Our R&D department constantly searches for new products and ways to improve
existing products. In addition, our Executive Committee, which consists of senior
executives in marketing, production, and finance, identifies the products and markets
in which our company should compete, and the Committee sets long-run targets for
each division. These targets, which are spelled out in the corporation’s strategic
business plan, provide a general guide to the operating executives who must meet
them. The operating executives then seek new products, set expansion plans for existing
products, and look for ways to reduce production and distribution costs. Because
bonuses and promotions are based on each unit’s ability to meet or exceed its targets,
these economic incentives encourage our operating executives to seek out profitable
investment opportunities.
While our senior executives are judged and rewarded on the basis of how well their
units perform, people further down the line are given bonuses and stock options for
suggestions that lead to profitable investments. Additionally, a percentage of our corporate
profit is set aside for distribution to nonexecutive employees, and we have an Employees’
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide further incentives. Our objective is to encourage
employees at all levels to keep an eye out for good ideas, especially those that lead to capital
investments.
Analyzing capital expenditure proposals is not costless—benefits can be
gained, but analysis does have a cost. For certain types of projects, an extremely
detailed analysis may be warranted, while for other projects, simpler procedures
are adequate. Accordingly, firms generally categorize projects and then analyze
them in each category somewhat differently:
1.
Replacement: needed to continue current operations. One category consists of
expenditures to replace worn-out or damaged equipment required in the
production of profitable products. The only questions here are should the
operation be continued and if so, should the firm continue to use the same
production processes? If the answers are yes, the project will be approved
without going through an elaborate decision process.
2.
Replacement: cost reduction. This category includes expenditures to replace
serviceable but obsolete equipment and thereby to lower costs. These
decisions are discretionary, and a fairly detailed analysis is generally required.
3.
Expansion of existing products or markets. These are expenditures to increase
output of existing products or to expand retail outlets or distribution facilities
in markets now being served. Expansion decisions are more complex because
they require an explicit forecast of growth in demand, so a more detailed
analysis is required. The go/no-go decision is generally made at a higher level
within the firm.
4.
Expansion into new products or markets. These investments relate to new
products or geographic areas, and they involve strategic decisions that could
change the fundamental nature of the business. Invariably, a detailed analysis

is required, and the final decision is generally made at the top level of
management.
5.
Safety and/or environmental projects. Expenditures necessary to comply with
government orders, labor agreements, or insurance policy terms fall into this
category. How these projects are handled depends on their size, with small
ones being treated much like the Category 1 projects.
6.
Other projects. This catch-all includes items such as office buildings, parking
lots, and executive aircraft. How they are handled varies among companies.
7.
Mergers. In a merger, one firm buys another one. Buying a whole firm is
different from buying an asset such as a machine or investing in a new
airplane, but the same principles are involved. The concepts of capital
budgeting underlie merger analysis.
In general, relatively simple calculations, and only a few supporting documents,
are required for replacement decisions, especially maintenance investments in
profitable plants. More detailed analyses are required for cost-reduction projects,
for expansion of existing product lines, and especially for investments in new
products or areas. Also, within each category, projects are grouped by their dollar
costs: Larger investments require increasingly detailed analysis and approval at
higher levels. Thus, a plant manager might be authorized to approve maintenance
expenditures up to $10,000 using a relatively unsophisticated analysis, but the full
board of directors might have to approve decisions that involve amounts greater
than $1 million or expansions into new products or markets.
If a firm has capable and imaginative executives and employees and if its
incentive system is working properly, many ideas for capital investment will be
advanced. Some ideas will be good ones, but others will not. Therefore, proce-
dures must be established for screening projects. Companies use, and we discuss,
the following criteria for deciding to accept or reject projects:2
1.
Net Present Value (NPV)
2.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
3.
Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)
4.
Regular Payback
5.
Discounted Payback
The NPV is the best method, primarily because it addresses directly the central
goal of financial management—maximizing shareholder wealth. However, all of
the methods provide useful information, and all are used in practice at least to
some extent.

11-2 NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV)
We saw in Chapter 3 that there is a difference between cash flows and accounting
income, and we noted that investors are particularly concerned with free cash flow.
Recall that free cash flow represents the net amount of cash that is available for all
investors after taking into account the necessary investments in fixed assets
(capital expenditures) and net operating working capital.
In Chapter 9, we demonstrated that the value of the firm is equal to the
present value of the free cash flows the firm produces for its investors over time.
Similarly, the value of a project is equal to its net present value (NPV), which is
simply the present value of the project’s free cash flows discounted at the cost of
capital. The net present value (NPV) tells us how much a project contributes to
shareholder wealth—the larger the NPV, the more value the project adds; and
added value means a higher stock price.3 Thus, NPV is the best selection criterion.
The most difficult aspect of capital budgeting is estimating the relevant cash
flows. For simplicity, the cash flows are treated as a given in this chapter, which
allows us to focus on the rules for making capital budgeting decisions. However,
in Chapter 12, we discuss cash flow estimation in detail.
We use the data for Projects S and L shown in Table 11.1 to illustrate the
calculation. The S stands for Short; the L, for Long. Project S is a short-term project
in the sense that more of its cash inflows come early, while L has more total cash
inflows but they come in later in its life. The projects are equally risky, and they
both have a 10% cost of capital. Furthermore, the cash flows have been adjusted to
reflect depreciation, taxes, and salvage values. The investment outlays shown as
CF0 include fixed assets and any necessary investments in working capital, and
cash flows come in at the end of the year. Finally, we show the table with an
“Excel look,” which simply means adding row and column headings to a “reg-
ular” table. All of the calculations can be done easily with a financial calculator;
but because some students may want to work with Excel, we show how problems
would be set up in Excel. Do keep in mind, though, that Excel is not necessary.
We find the NPVs as follows:
1.
The present value of each cash flow is calculated and discounted at the
project’s risk-adjusted cost of capital, r
10% in our example.
2.
The sum of the discounted cash flows is defined as the project’s NPV.
The equation for the NPV, set up with input data for Project S, is as follows:
NPV

Here CFt is the expected cash flow at Time t, r is the project’s risk-adjusted cost of
capital (or WACC), and N is its life. Projects generally require an initial investment—
for example, developing the product, buying the equipment needed to manufac-
ture it, building a factory, and stocking inventory. The initial investment is a

stock price. However, given the lag between project acceptance and visible effects on earnings, this is
rarely done for routine projects. However, for major projects, this procedure is useful.

negative cash flow. For Projects S and L, only CF0 is negative; but for large projects
such as Boeing’s Dreamliner or Airbus’s A350 XWB, outflows occur for several
years before cash inflows ever begin.
Figure 11.1 shows the cash flow time line for Project S; the PV of each cash
flow; and the sum of the PVs, which is by definition the NPV. The cost, at t
0, is
$1,000. The first positive cash flow is $500; and with a regular calculator, you
could find its PV as $500
1 10 1
$454 55. You could also find the PV of the $500
with a financial calculator. Other PVs could be found similarly, and the end result
would be the numbers in the left column of the diagram. When we sum those
numbers, the result is $78 82, which is NPVS. Note that the initial cost, the −$1,000,
is not discounted because it occurs at Time 0. The NPV for Project L, $100 40,
could be found similarly.
The step-by-step procedure shown in Figure 11.1 is useful for illustrating how
the NPV is calculated; but in practice (and on exams), it is far more efficient to use a
financial calculator or Excel. Different calculators are set up somewhat differently;
but as we discussed in Chapter 5, they all have a “cash flow register” that can be
used to evaluate uneven cash flows such as those for Projects S and L. Equation 11.1
is programmed into these calculators, and all you must do is enter the cash flows
(with the correct signs) along with r

If you are familiar with Excel, you can use Excel’s NPV function to find the
NPVs for S and L:5

The calculations used to obtain these values are provided in the chapter’s Excel
model, as shown in Figure 11.1. If you want to know something about Excel, you
should review the model because this is the way most people in practice find NPVs.
Before using these NPVs in the decision process, we need to know whether
Projects S and L are independent or mutually exclusive. Independent projects are
projects whose cash flows are not affected by one another. If Walmart was
considering a new store in Boise and another in Atlanta, the projects would be
independent; and if both had positive NPVs, Walmart should accept both.
Mutually exclusive projects, on the other hand, are projects where if one project
is accepted, the other must be rejected. A conveyor belt system to move goods in
a warehouse and a fleet of forklifts used for the same purpose would be mutually
exclusive—accepting one implies rejecting the other.

(shown in Figure 11.1) does not include the initial outlay at Time 0. Excel’s NPV function assumes
that the first cell reference in the cash flow range given refers to the cash flow at Time 1. Thus, the
initial outlay must be subtracted from the value obtained using Excel’s NPV function to calculate
the project’s NPV.

What should be the decision if Projects S and L are independent? In this case,
both should be accepted because both have positive NPVs and thus add value to
the firm. However, if they are mutually exclusive, Project L should be chosen
because it has the higher positive NPV and thus adds more value than S. Here is a
summary of the NPV decision rules:
•
Independent projects. If NPV exceeds zero, accept the project.
•
Mutually exclusive projects. Accept the project with the highest positive NPV. If
no project has a positive NPV, reject them all.
Because projects must be either independent or mutually exclusive, one or the
other of these rules applies to every project.
11-3 INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)
In Chapter 7, we discussed the yield to maturity on a bond and we explained that
if you hold it to maturity, you will earn the YTM on your investment. The YTM is
found as the discount rate that forces the PV of the cash inflows to equal the price
of the bond. This same concept is involved in capital budgeting when we calculate
a project’s internal rate of return (IRR):
A project’s IRR is the discount rate that forces the PV of its inflows to equal its cost. This
is equivalent to forcing the NPV to equal zero. The IRR is an estimate of the project’s rate
of return, and it is comparable to the YTM on a bond.
To calculate the IRR, we begin with Equation 11.1 for the NPV, replace r in the
denominator with the term IRR, and set the NPV equal to zero. This transforms
Equation 11.1 into Equation 11.2, the one used to find the IRR. The rate that forces
NPV to equal zero is the IRR.6

Figure 11.2 illustrates the process of finding the IRR for Project S. Three
procedures can be used:
1.
Trial and Error. We could use a trial-and-error procedure—try a discount rate;
see if the equation solves to zero; and if it doesn’t, try a different rate. We
could then continue until we found the rate that forces the NPV to zero; that
rate would be the IRR. For Project S, the IRR is 14 489%. Note, though, that the
S E L F T E S T
Why is the NPV the primary capital budgeting decision criterion?
Differentiate between independent and mutually exclusive projects.
6For a large, complex project like Boeing’s Dreamliner, costs are incurred for several years before
cash inflows begin. That means that we have a number of negative cash flows before the positive cash
flows start.

trial-and-error procedure is so time-consuming that before computers and
financial calculators were available, the IRR was rarely used. It’s useful to
think about the trial-and-error procedure, but it’s far better to use a calculator
or Excel to do the actual calculations.

Q U E S T I O N S :
a. What are the projects’ IRRs?
b. Which project(s) would the IRR method select if the firm had a 10% cost of capital and
the projects were (1) independent or (2) mutually exclusive?
7See the calculator tutorials on the text’s website, www.cengagebrain.com. Note that once the cash
flows have been entered in the cash flow register, you can find the NPV and the IRR. To find the NPV,
enter the interest rate (I/YR) and then press the NPV key. Then with no further entries, press the IRR
key to find the IRR. Thus, once you set up the calculator to find the NPV, it is easy to find the IRR. This
is one reason most firms calculate both the NPV and the IRR. If you calculate one, it is easy to calculate
the other; and both provide information that decision makers find useful. The same is true with Excel.

Why is the discount rate that causes a project’s NPV to equal zero so special?
The reason is that the IRR is an estimate of the project’s rate of return. If this return
exceeds the cost of the funds used to finance the project, the difference will be an
additional return (in a sense a “bonus”) that goes to the firm’s stockholders and
causes the stock price to rise. Project S has an estimated return of 14 489% versus a
10% cost of capital, so it provides an additional return of 4 489% above its cost of
capital. On the other hand, if the IRR is less than the cost of capital, stockholders
must make up the shortfall, which will hurt the stock price.
Note again that the IRR formula, Equation 11.2, is simply the NPV formula,
Equation 11.1, solved for the particular discount rate that forces the NPV to equal
zero. Thus, the same basic equation is used for both methods. The only difference
is that with the NPV method the discount rate is given and we find the NPV;
while with the IRR method the NPV is set equal to zero and we find the interest
rate that produces this equality.
As we noted earlier, projects should be accepted or rejected depending on
whether their NPVs are positive. However, the IRR is sometimes used (improp-
erly we believe) to rank projects and make capital budgeting decisions. When this
is done, here are the decision rules:
•
Independent projects. If IRR exceeds the project’s WACC, accept the project. If
IRR is less than the project’s WACC, reject it.
•
Mutually exclusive projects. Accept the project with the highest IRR, provided
that IRR is greater than WACC. Reject all projects if the best IRR does not
exceed WACC.
The IRR is logically appealing—it is useful to know the rates of return on pro-
posed investments. However, as we demonstrate in Section 11-7, NPV and IRR
can produce conflicting conclusions when a choice is being made between
mutually exclusive projects; and when conflicts occur, the NPV is generally better.

11-4 MULTIPLE INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN8
A problem with the IRR is that under certain conditions, a project may have more
than one IRR. First, note that a project is said to have normal cash flows if it has
one or more cash outflows (costs) followed by a series of cash inflows. If, however,
a cash outflow occurs sometime after the inflows have commenced, meaning that
the signs of the cash flows change more than once, the project is said to have
nonnormal cash flows. Examples follow:
Normal:
or
Nonnormal:
or
An example of a project with nonnormal cash flows would be a strip coal mine
where the company spends money to purchase the property and prepare the site
for mining, has positive inflows for several years, and then the company spends
more money to return the land to its original condition. In such a case, the project
might have two IRRs, that is, multiple IRRs.9
To illustrate multiple IRRs, suppose a firm is considering a potential strip
mine (Project M) that has a cost of $1 6 million and will produce a cash flow of
WHY NPV IS BETTER THAN IRR
Buffett University recently hosted a seminar on business
methods for managers. A finance professor covered capital
budgeting, explaining how to calculate the NPV and stat-
ing that it should be used to screen potential projects. In
the Q&A session, Ed Wilson, the treasurer of an electronics
firm, said that his firm used the IRR primarily because the
CFO and the directors understood the selection of projects
based on their rates of return but didn’t understand the
NPV. Ed had tried to explain why the NPV was better, but
he simply confused everyone; so the company stuck with
the IRR. Now a meeting on the firm’s capital budget is
approaching, and Ed asked the professor for a simple way
to explain why the NPV is better.
The professor recommended the following extreme
example. A firm with adequate access to capital and a
10%
WACC is
choosing between
two equally risky,
mutually exclusive projects. Project Large calls for invest-
ing $100,000 and then receiving $50,000 per year for 10
years, while Project Small calls for investing $1 and
receiving $0 60 per year for 10 years. Here is each proj-
ect’s NPV and IRR:
Project Large (L)
Project Small (S)
CF0
$100,000
CF0
$1 00
CF1
10
$50,000
CF1
10
$0 60
I YR
10
I YR
10
NPV
$207,228 36
NPV
$2 69
IRR
49 1%
IRR
59 4%
The IRR says choose S, but the NPV says take L. Intuitively, it’s
obvious that the firm would be better off choosing the large
project in spite of its lower IRR. With a cost of capital of only
10%, a 49% rate of return on a $100,000 investment is more
profitable than a 59% return on a $1 investment.
When Ed gave this example in his firm’s executive meeting
on the capital budget, the CFO argued that this example was
extreme and unrealistic, and that no one would choose S in
spite of its higher IRR. Ed agreed, but he asked the CFO where
the line should be drawn between realistic and unrealistic
examples. When Ed received no answer, he went on to say that
(1) it’s hard to draw this line and (2) the NPV is always better
because it tells us how much value each project will add to the
firm, and value is what the firm should maximize. The president
was listening, and he declared Ed the winner. The company
switched from using IRR to NPV, and Ed is now the CFO.

9Equation 11.2 is a polynomial of degree n; so it has n different roots, or solutions. All except one of the
roots is an imaginary number when investments have normal cash flows (one or more cash outflows
followed by cash inflows). So in the normal case, only one value of IRR appears. However, the
possibility of multiple real roots (hence multiple IRRs) arises when negative cash flows occur after
the project has been placed in operation.

$10 million at the end of Year 1. Then at the end of Year 2, the firm must spend
$10 million to restore the land to its original condition. Therefore, the project’s

one to use. This relationship is depicted graphically in Figure 11.3.11 The graph is
constructed by plotting the project’s NPV at different discount rates.
Note that no dilemma regarding Project M would arise if the NPV method was
used; we would simply find the NPV and use it to evaluate the project. We would
see that if Project M’s cost of capital was 10%, its NPV would be −$0 7736 million,
and the project should be rejected. However, if r was between 25% and 400%, NPV
would be positive, but those numbers would not be realistic or useful for anything.

10lf you attempt to find Project M’s IRR with an HP calculator, you will get an error message, while TI
calculators give only the IRR that’s closest to zero. When you encounter either situation, you can find
the approximate IRRs by calculating NPVs using several different values for r = I/YR, plotting NPV
on the vertical axis with the corresponding discount rate on the horizontal axis of a graph, and seeing
about where NPV = 0. The intersection with the X-axis provides a rough idea of the IRRs’ values. With
some calculators and with Excel, you can find both IRRs by entering guesses, as explained in the
calculator and Excel tutorials on the text’s website, www.cengagebrain.com.

11-5 REINVESTMENT RATE ASSUMPTIONS12
The NPV calculation is based on the assumption that cash inflows can be rein-
vested at the project’s risk-adjusted WACC, whereas the IRR calculation is based
on the assumption that cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR. To see why this is
so, consider the following diagram, which was first used in Chapter 5 to illustrate
the future value of $100 when the interest rate was 5%.
Going from PV to FV: PV = $100.00
0

5%
5%

$105.00
$110.25
$115.76 = FV
Observe that the FV calculation assumes that the interest earned during each year
can be reinvested to earn the same 5% in each succeeding year.
Now recall that when we found the PV, we reversed the process, discounting
rather than compounding at the 5% rate. This diagram was used to demonstrate
this point:
Going from FV to PV: PV = $100.00
0
2
1
5%
5%

3
$105.00
$110.25
$115.76 = FV
This led to the following conclusion: When we calculate a present value, we are
implicitly assuming that cash flows can be reinvested at a specified interest rate, 5% in
our example. This applies to Projects S and L: When we calculated their NPVs, we
discounted at the WACC, 10%, which means that we were assuming that their
cash flows could be reinvested at 10%.
Now consider the IRR. In Section 11-3 we presented a cash flow diagram set
up to show the PVs of the cash flows when discounted at the IRR. We saw that for
Project S the sum of the PVs is equal to the cost at a discount rate of 14 489%; so by
definition, 14 489% is the IRR for Project S. Now we can ask this question: What
reinvestment rate is built into the IRR?
S E L F T E S T
What condition regarding cash flows would cause more than one IRR to exist?
Project MM has the following cash flows:

–$3,350
Calculate MM’s NPV at discount rates of 0%, 10%, 12 2258%, 25%, 122 1470%,
and 150%. What are MM’s IRRs? If the cost of capital is 10%, should the project
be accepted or rejected? (NPVs range from −$350 to +$164 and then back
down to −$94; the IRRs are 12 23% and 122 15%. At a 10% WACC, the
project’s NPV is negative so reject the project.)
12This section gives a theoretical explanation of the key difference between NPV and IRR. However, it
is relatively technical; so if time is a constraint, professors may decide to have students skip it and just
read the box titled, “Why NPV Is Better than IRR,” which appears in Section 11-3.

Because discounting at a given rate assumes that cash flows can be reinvested at that same
rate, the IRR assumes that cash flows are reinvested at the IRR.
The NPV assumes reinvestment at the WACC, while the IRR assumes rein-
vestment at the IRR. Which assumption is more reasonable? For most firms,
assuming reinvestment at the WACC is more reasonable for the following reasons:
•
If a firm has reasonably good access to the capital markets, it can raise all the
capital it needs at the going rate, which in our example is 10%.
•
Because the firm can obtain capital at 10%, if it has investment opportunities
with positive NPVs, it should take them on and it can finance them at a
10% cost.
•
If the firm uses internally generated cash flows from past projects rather than
external capital, this will save it the 10% cost of capital. Thus, 10% is the
opportunity cost of the cash flows, and that is the effective return on reinvested
funds.
To illustrate, suppose a project’s IRR is 50%, the firm’s WACC is 10%, and the firm
has adequate access to the capital markets. Thus, the firm can raise the capital it
needs at the 10% rate. Unless the firm is a monopoly, the 50% return would attract
competition, which would make it difficult to find new projects with similar high
returns, which is what the IRR assumes. Moreover, even if the firm does find such
projects, it could take them on with external capital that costs 10%. The logical
conclusion is that the original project’s cash flows will save the 10% cost of the
external capital, and that is the effective return on those flows.
If a firm does not have good access to external capital and if it has many
potential projects with high IRRs, it might be reasonable to assume that a project’s
cash flows could be reinvested at a rate close to its IRR. However, that situation
rarely exists: Firms with good investment opportunities generally do have good
access to debt and equity markets.
Our conclusion is that the assumption built into the IRR—that cash flows can be
reinvested at the IRR—is flawed, whereas the assumption built into the NPV—that
cash flows can be reinvested at the WACC—is generally correct. Moreover, if the
true reinvestment rate is less than the IRR, the true rate of return on the investment
must be less than the calculated IRR; thus, the IRR is misleading as a measure of a
project’s profitability. This point is discussed further in the next section.
11-6 MODIFIED INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (MIRR)13
It is logical for managers to want to know the expected rate of return on invest-
ments, and this is what the IRR is supposed to tell them. However, the IRR is
based on the assumption that projects’ cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR.
S E L F T E S T
Why is it true that a reinvestment rate is implicitly assumed whenever we find
the present value of a future cash flow? Would it be possible to find the PV of a
FV without specifying an implicit reinvestment rate?
What reinvestment rate is built into the NPV calculation? The IRR calculation?
For a firm that has adequate access to capital markets, is it more reasonable to
assume reinvestment at the WACC or the IRR? Explain.

This assumption is generally incorrect, and this causes the IRR to overstate the project’s
true return.14 Given this fundamental flaw, is there a percentage evaluator that is
better than the regular IRR? The answer is yes—we can modify the IRR to make it
a better measure of profitability.
This new measure, the modified IRR (MIRR), is illustrated for Project S in
Figure 11.4. It is similar to the regular IRR except that it is based on the assumption
that cash flows are reinvested at the WACC (or some other explicit rate if that is a
more reasonable assumption). Refer to Figure 11.4 as you read about its construction.
1.
Project S has just one outflow, a negative $1,000 at t
0. Because it occurs at
Time 0, it is not discounted and its PV is −$1,000. If the project had additional
outflows, we would find the PV at t
0 for each one and sum them to arrive
at the PV of total costs for use in the MIRR calculation.
2.
Next, we find the future value of each inflow compounded at the WACC out to
the “terminal year,” which is the year the last inflow is received. We assume
that cash flows are reinvested at the WACC. For Project S, the first cash flow,
$500, is compounded at WACC
10% for 3 years and it grows to $665 50. The
second inflow, $400, grows to $484 00; the third inflow grows to $330 00. The
last inflow is received at the end, so it is not compounded at all. The sum of
the future values, $1,579 50, is called the “terminal value,” or TV.
3.
We now have the cost at t
0, −$1,000, and the TV at Year 4, $1,579 50. There
is some discount rate that will cause the PV of the terminal value to equal the
cost. That interest rate is defined as the MIRR. In a calculator, enter N
4,
PV
−1000, PMT
0, and FV
1579 50. Then when you press the I YR key,
you get the MIRR, 12 11%.
4.
The MIRR can be found in a number of ways. Figure 11.4 illustrates how the
MIRR is calculated: We compound each cash inflow, sum them to determine
the TV, and then find the rate that causes the PV of the TV to equal the cost.
That rate is 12 11%. However, some of the better calculators have a built-in
MIRR function that streamlines the process. In Excel, you can use either the
RATE or MIRR function to calculate the MIRR as shown in Figure 11.4.15
We explain how to use the calculator function in the calculator tutorials, and
we explain how to find MIRR with Excel in the chapter Excel model.16
14The IRR overstates the expected return for accepted projects because cash flows cannot generally be
reinvested at the IRR. Therefore, the average IRR for accepted projects is greater than the true expected
rate of return. This imparts an upward bias on corporate projections based on IRRs.
15Excel’s MIRR function allows you to enter a different reinvestment rate from the WACC for the cash
inflows. However, we assume reinvestment at the WACC, so the WACC is entered twice in the Excel
MIRR function, shown in Figure 11.4.

COFt is the cash outflow at time t, and CIFt is the cash inflow at time t. The left term is the PV of the
investment outlays when discounted at the cost of capital; the numerator of the second term is the
compounded value of the inflows, assuming the inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital. The MIRR
is the discount rate that forces the PV of the TV to equal the PV of the costs.
Also note that there are alternative definitions for the MIRR. One difference relates to whether
negative cash flows, after the positive cash flows begin, should be compounded and treated as part of
the TV or discounted and treated as a cost. A related issue is whether negative and positive flows in a
given year should be netted or treated separately. For a complete discussion, see William R. McDaniel,
Daniel E. McCarty, and Kenneth A. Jessell, “Discounted Cash Flow with Explicit Reinvestment Rates:
Tutorial and Extension,” The Financial Review, vol. 23, no. 3 (August 1988), pp. 369–385; and David M.

The MIRR has two significant advantages over the regular IRR. First, whereas
the regular IRR assumes that the cash flows from each project are reinvested at the
IRR, the MIRR assumes that cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital (or some
other explicit rate). Because reinvestment at the IRR is generally not correct, the
MIRR is generally a better indicator of a project’s true profitability. Second, the MIRR
eliminates the multiple IRR problem—there can never be more than one MIRR, and it
can be compared with the cost of capital when deciding to accept or reject projects.

Our conclusion is that the MIRR is better than the regular IRR; however, this
question remains: Is MIRR as good as the NPV? Here are our conclusions:
•
For independent projects, the NPV, IRR, and MIRR always reach the same
accept/reject conclusion; so the three criteria are equally good when
evaluating independent projects.

•
However, if projects are mutually exclusive and they differ in size, conflicts
can arise. In such cases, the NPV is best because it selects the project that
maximizes value.17
•
Our overall conclusions are that (1) the MIRR is superior to the regular IRR
as an indicator of a project’s “true” rate of return but that (2) NPV is better
than IRR and MIRR when choosing among competing projects.
11-7 NPV PROFILES
Figure 11.5 presents the net present value profile for Project S. To make the profile,
we find the project’s NPV at a number of different discount rates and then plot
those values to create a graph. Note that at a zero cost of capital, the NPV is simply
the net total of the undiscounted cash flows, $1,300
$1,000
$300. This value is
plotted as the vertical axis intercept. Also recall that the IRR is the discount rate that
causes the NPV to equal zero, so the discount rate at which the profile line crosses
the horizontal axis is the project’s IRR. When we connect the data points, we have
the NPV profile.18
Now consider Figure 11.6, which shows two NPV profiles—one for Project S
and one for L—and note the following points:
•
The IRRs are fixed, and S has the higher IRR regardless of the cost of capital.
•
However, the NPVs vary depending on the actual cost of capital.
•
The two NPV profile lines cross at a cost of capital of 11 975%, which is called
the crossover rate. The crossover rate can be found by calculating the IRR of
the differences in the projects’ cash flows, as demonstrated below:

rate, but S has the higher NPV if the cost of capital is greater than that rate.

Cengage Learning, 2013), pp. 466–468.
18Notice that the NPV profile is curved—it is not a straight line. NPV approaches CF0, which is the
−$1,000 project cost, as the discount rate increases toward infinity. At an infinitely high cost of capital,
all the PVs of the inflows would be zero; so NPV at r = ∞must be CF0. We should also note that under
certain conditions, the NPV profiles can cross the horizontal axis several times or never cross it. This
point was discussed in Section 11-4.

Notice that Project L has the steeper slope, indicating that a given increase in
the cost of capital causes a larger decline in NPVL than in NPVS. To see why this is
so, recall that L’s cash flows come in later than those of S. Therefore, L is a long-
term project and S is a short-term project. Next, recall the equation for the NPV:

Thus, a doubling of the discount rate results in only a 4 5% decline in the PV
of a Year 1 cash flow, but the same discount rate increase causes the PV of a Year
20 cash flow to fall by more than 60%. Therefore, if a project has most of its cash flows
coming in the later years, its NPV will decline sharply if the cost of capital increases; but a
project whose cash flows come earlier will not be severely penalized by high capital costs.
Most of Project L’s cash flows come in its later years; so if the cost of capital is
high, L is hurt much worse than Project S. Therefore, Project L’s NPV profile has
the steeper slope.
Sometimes the NPV and IRR methods produce conflicting results. We can use
NPV profiles to see when conflicts can and cannot arise.
If an independent project with normal cash flows is being evaluated, the
NPV and IRR criteria always lead to the same accept/reject decision: If NPV
says accept, IRR also says accept, and vice versa. To see why this is so, look at
Figure 11.5 and notice that (1) the IRR says accept if the project’s cost of capital is
less than (or to the left of) the IRR and (2) if the cost of capital is less than the IRR,
the NPV will be positive. Thus, at any cost of capital less than 14 489%, Project S
will be recommended by both the NPV and IRR criteria; but both methods reject
the project if the cost of capital is greater than 14 489%. A similar graph could
be used for Project L or any other normal project, and we would always reach
the same conclusion: For normal, independent projects, if the IRR says accept, so will
the NPV.

Assume that Projects S and L are mutually exclusive rather than independent.
Therefore, we can choose either S or L, or we can reject both; but we can’t accept
both. Now look at Figure 11.6 and note these points:
•
As long as the cost of capital is greater than the crossover rate, 11 975%, both
methods agree that Project S is better: NPVS
NPVL and IRRS
IRRL.
Therefore, if r is greater than the crossover rate, no conflict occurs.
•
However, if the cost of capital is less than the crossover rate, a conflict arises:
NPV ranks L higher, but IRR ranks S higher.
Two basic conditions cause NPV profiles to cross and thus lead to conflicts:19
1.
Timing differences. If most of the cash flows from one project come in early
while most of those from the other project come in later, as occurred with
Projects S and L, the NPV profiles may cross and result in a conflict.
2.
Project size (or scale) differences. If the amount invested in one project is larger
than the other, this too can lead to profiles crossing and a resulting conflict.
When size or timing differences occur, the firm will have different amounts of
funds to invest in the various years depending on which of the two mutually
exclusive projects it chooses. If it chooses S, it will have more funds to invest in
Year 1 because S has a higher inflow that year. Similarly, if one project costs more
than the other, the firm will have more money to invest at t
0 if it selects the
smaller project.
Given this situation, the rate of return at which differential cash flows can be
reinvested is a critical issue. We saw earlier that the NPV assumes reinvestment at
the cost of capital and that this is generally the best assumption. Therefore, when
conflicts exist between mutually exclusive projects, use the NPV method.
11-8 PAYBACK PERIOD
NPV is the most commonly used method for capital budgeting today; but histori-
cally, the first selection criterion used was the payback period, defined as the
number of years required to recover the funds invested in a project from its cash
flows. Equation 11.3 is used for the calculation, and the process is diagrammed in
Figure 11.7. We start with the project’s cost, a negative value, and then add the
cash inflow for each year until the cumulative cash flow turns positive. The
payback year is the year prior to full recovery plus a fraction equal to the shortfall
at the end of that year divided by the cash flow during the full recovery year:20
S E L F T E S T
Describe in words how an NPV profile is constructed. How are the intercepts of
the X- and Y-axes determined?
What is the crossover rate, and how does its value relative to the cost of capital
determine whether a conflict exists between NPV and IRR?
What two characteristics can lead to conflicts between the NPV and the IRR
when evaluating mutually exclusive projects?
19Of course, mutually exclusive projects can differ with respect to both scale and timing. Also, if
mutually exclusive projects have different lives (as opposed to different cash flow patterns over a
common life), this introduces further complications; and for meaningful comparisons, some mutually
exclusive projects must be evaluated over a common life. This point is discussed later in Chapter 12
and in Web Appendix 12E on the text’s website, www.cengagebrain.com.
20Equation 11.3 assumes that cash flows come in uniformly during the full recovery year.

The shorter the payback, the better the project. Therefore, if the firm requires a
payback of three years or less, S would be accepted, but L would be rejected. If the
projects were mutually exclusive, S would be ranked over L because of its shorter
payback.
The payback has three flaws: (1) All dollars received in different years are
given the same weight (i.e., the time value of money is ignored). (2) Cash flows
beyond the payback year are given no consideration regardless of how large they
might be. (3) Unlike the NPV, which tells us how much wealth a project adds, and
the IRR, which tells us how much a project yields over the cost of capital, the
payback merely tells us when we will recover our investment. There is no neces-
sary relationship between a given payback and investor wealth maximization, so
we do not know what an acceptable payback is. The firm might use 2 years, 3
years, or any other number as the minimum acceptable payback; but the choice is
arbitrary.
To counter the first criticism, analysts developed the discounted payback.
Here cash flows are discounted at the WACC; then those discounted cash flows
are used to find the payback. In Figure 11.8, we calculate the discounted paybacks
for S and L assuming that both have a 10% cost of capital. Each inflow is divided
by 1
r t
1 10 t, where t is the year in which the cash flow occurs and r is the
project’s cost of capital; and those PVs are used to find the payback. Project S’s
discounted payback is 2 95, while L’s is 3 78.
Note that the payback is a “break-even” calculation in the sense that if cash
flows come in at the expected rate, the project will break even. However, because
the regular payback doesn’t consider the cost of capital, it doesn’t specify the true
break-even year. The discounted payback does consider capital costs; but it still
disregards cash flows beyond the payback year, which is a serious flaw. Further, if
mutually exclusive projects vary in size, both payback methods can conflict with
the NPV, which might lead to a poor choice. Finally, there is no way of telling how
low the paybacks must be to justify project acceptance.
Although the payback methods have faults as ranking criteria, they do pro-
vide information about liquidity and risk. The shorter the payback, other things
held constant, the greater the project’s liquidity. This factor is often important for

expected in the distant future are generally riskier than near-term cash flows, so
the payback is used as one risk indicator.
11-9 CONCLUSIONS ON CAPITAL BUDGETING METHODS
We have discussed five capital budgeting decision criteria—NPV, IRR, MIRR,
payback, and discounted payback. We compared these methods with one another
and highlighted their strengths and weaknesses. In the process, we may have
created the impression that “sophisticated” firms should use only one method, the
NPV. However, virtually all capital budgeting decisions are analyzed by compu-
ter, so it is easy to calculate all five decision criteria. In making the accept/reject
decision, large, sophisticated firms such as Boeing and Airbus generally calculate
and consider all five measures because each provides a somewhat different piece
of information about the decision.
NPV is the single best criterion because it provides a direct measure of value
the project adds to shareholder wealth. IRR and MIRR measure profitability

What information does the payback convey that is absent from the other capital
budgeting decision methods?
What three flaws does the regular payback have? Does the discounted payback
correct all of these flaws? Explain.
Project P has a cost of $1,000 and cash flows of $300 per year for three years
plus another $1,000 in Year 4. The project’s cost of capital is 15%. What are
Project P’s regular and discounted paybacks? (3.10, 3.55) If the company
requires a payback of three years or less, would the project be accepted? Would
this be a good accept/reject decision considering the NPV and/or the IRR?

expressed as a percentage rate of return, which is useful to decision makers.
Further, IRR and MIRR contain information concerning a project’s “safety mar-
gin.” To illustrate, consider a firm whose WACC is 10% that must choose between
these two mutually exclusive projects: SS (for small), which costs $10,000 and is
expected to return $16,500 at the end of one year, and LL (for large), which costs
$100,000 and has an expected payoff of $115,550 after one year. SS has a huge IRR,
65%, while LL’s IRR is a more modest 15 6%. The NPV paints a somewhat
different picture—at the 10% cost of capital, SS’s NPV is $5,000 while LL’s is
$5,045. By the NPV rule, we would choose LL. However, SS’s IRR indicates that it
has a much larger margin for error: Even if its cash flow was 39% below the
$16,500 forecast, the firm would still recover its $10,000 investment. On the other
hand, if LL’s inflows fell by only 13.5% from its forecasted $115 550, the firm
would not recover its investment. Further, if neither project generated any cash
flows, the firm would lose only $10,000 on SS but $100,000 if it accepted LL.
The modified IRR has all the virtues of the IRR, but it incorporates a better
reinvestment rate assumption and avoids the multiple rate of return problem. So if
decision makers want to know projects’ rates of return, the MIRR is a better
indicator than the regular IRR.
Payback and discounted payback provide indications of a project’s liquidity
and risk. A long payback means that investment dollars will be locked up for a
long time; hence, the project is relatively illiquid. In addition, a long payback
means that cash flows must be forecasted far out into the future, and that probably
makes the project riskier than one with a shorter payback. A good analogy for this
is bond valuation. An investor should never compare the yields to maturity on
two bonds without also considering their terms to maturity because a bond’s risk
is significantly influenced by the number of years remaining until its maturity. The
same holds true for capital projects.
In summary, the different measures provide different types of information.
Because it is easy to calculate all of them, all should be considered when capital
budgeting decisions are being made. For most decisions, the greatest weight
should be given to the NPV, but it would be foolish to ignore the information
provided by the other criteria.
11-10 DECISION CRITERIA USED IN PRACTICE
Surveys designed to find out which of the criteria managers actually use have
been taken over the years. Surveys prior to 1999 asked companies to indicate
which method they gave the most weight, while the most recent survey, in 1999,
asked what method(s) managers actually calculated and used. A summary of all
these surveys is shown in Table 11.2, and it reveals some interesting trends.
First, the NPV criterion was not used significantly before 1980; but by 1999, it
was close to the top in usage. Moreover, informal discussions with companies
suggest that if a survey were to be taken in 2013, NPV would be at the top of this

list. Second, the IRR method is widely used, but its recent growth is less dramatic
than that of NPV. Third, payback was the most important criterion years ago, but
its use as the primary criterion had fallen drastically by 1980. Companies still use
payback because it is easy to calculate and it does provide some information, but it
is rarely used today as the primary criterion. Fourth, “other methods,” primarily
the accounting rate of return and the profitability index, have been fading due to
the increased use of IRR and especially NPV.
These trends are consistent with our evaluation of the various methods. NPV
is the best single criterion, but all of the methods provide useful information and
all are easy to calculate; thus, all are used, along with judgment and common
sense. We will have more to say about all this in the next chapter.
In this chapter, we described five techniques—NPV, IRR, MIRR, payback, and dis-

NPV is the best single measure as it tells us how much value each project con-
tributes to shareholder wealth. Therefore, NPV is the method that should be given
the greatest weight in capital budgeting decisions. However, the other approaches
provide useful information; and in this age of computers, it is easy to calculate all of

them. Therefore, managers generally look at all five criteria when deciding to
accept or reject projects and when choosing among mutually exclusive projects.
In this chapter, we took the cash flows given and used them to illustrate the
different capital budgeting methods. As you will see in the next chapter, estimating
cash flows is a major task. Still, the framework established in this chapter is
critically important for sound capital budgeting analyses; and at this point, you
should:
•
Understand capital budgeting.
•
Know how to calculate and use the major capital budgeting decision criteria,
which are NPV, IRR, MIRR, and payback.
•
Understand why NPV is the best criterion and how it overcomes problems
inherent in the other methods.
•
Recognize that while NPV is the best method, the other methods do provide
information that decision makers find useful.

QUESTIONS
11-1
How are project classifications used in the capital budgeting process?
11-2
What are three potential flaws with the regular payback method? Does the discounted
payback method correct all three flaws? Explain.
11-3
Why is the NPV of a relatively long-term project (one for which a high percentage of its
cash flows occurs in the distant future) more sensitive to changes in the WACC than that of
a short-term project?
11-4
What is a mutually exclusive project? How should managers rank mutually exclusive projects?
11-5
If two mutually exclusive projects were being compared, would a high cost of capital favor
the longer-term or the shorter-term project? Why? If the cost of capital declined, would that
lead firms to invest more in longer-term projects or shorter-term projects? Would a decline
(or an increase) in the WACC cause changes in the IRR ranking of mutually exclusive
projects? Explain.
11-6
Discuss the following statement: If a firm has only independent projects, a constant WACC,
and projects with normal cash flows, the NPV and IRR methods will always lead to identical
capital budgeting decisions. What does this imply about the choice between IRR and NPV? If
each of the assumptions were changed (one by one), how would your answer change?
11-7
Why might it be rational for a small firm that does not have access to the capital markets to
use the payback method rather than the NPV method?
11-8
Project X is very risky and has an NPV of $3 million. Project Y is very safe and has an NPV
of $2 5 million. They are mutually exclusive, and project risk has been properly considered
in the NPV analyses. Which project should be chosen? Explain.
11-9
What reinvestment rate assumptions are built into the NPV, IRR, and MIRR methods? Give
an explanation for your answer.
11-10
A firm has a $100 million capital budget. It is considering two projects, each costing $100
million. Project A has an IRR of 20% and an NPV of $9 million; it will be terminated after 1 year
at a profit of $20 million, resulting in an immediate increase in EPS. Project B, which cannot be
postponed, has an IRR of 30% and an NPV of $50 million. However, the firm’s short-run EPS
will be reduced if it accepts Project B because no revenues will be generated for several years.
a.
Should the short-run effects on EPS influence the choice between the two projects?
b.
How might situations like this influence a firm’s decision to use payback?

CAPITAL BUDGETING CRITERIA: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
A mining company is con-
sidering a new project. Because the mine has received a permit, the project would be legal;
but it would cause significant harm to a nearby river. The firm could spend an additional
$10 million at Year 0 to mitigate the environmental problem, but it would not be required to
do so. Developing the mine (without mitigation) would cost $60 million, and the expected
cash inflows would be $20 million per year for 5 years. If the firm does invest in mitigation,
the annual inflows would be $21 million. The risk-adjusted WACC is 12%.
a.
Calculate the NPV and IRR with and without mitigation.
b.
How should the environmental effects be dealt with when this project is evaluated?
c.
Should this project be undertaken? If so, should the firm do the mitigation?

CAPITAL BUDGETING CRITERIA: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
An electric utility is consider-
ing a new power plant in northern Arizona. Power from the plant would be sold in the
Phoenix area, where it is badly needed. Because the firm has received a permit, the plant
would be legal; but it would cause some air pollution. The company could spend an additional
$40 million at Year 0 to mitigate the environmental problem, but it would not be required to do
so. The plant without mitigation would cost $240 million, and the expected cash inflows
would be $80 million per year for 5 years. If the firm does invest in mitigation, the annual
inflows would be $84 million. Unemployment in the area where the plant would be built is
high, and the plant would provide about 350 good jobs. The risk-adjusted WACC is 17%.

Kim Inc. must install a
new air conditioning unit in its main plant. Kim must install one or the other of the units;
otherwise, the highly profitable plant would have to shut down. Two units are available,
HCC and LCC (for high and low capital costs, respectively). HCC has a high capital cost but
relatively low operating costs, while LCC has a low capital cost but higher operating costs
because it uses more electricity. The costs of the units are shown here. Kim’s WACC is 7%.

NPV PROFILES: TIMING DIFFERENCES
An oil-drilling company must choose between two
mutually exclusive extraction projects, and each costs $12 million. Under Plan A, all the oil
would be extracted in 1 year, producing a cash flow at t
1 of $14 4 million. Under Plan B,
cash flows would be $2 1 million per year for 20 years. The firm’s WACC is 12%.
a.
Construct NPV profiles for Plans A and B, identify each project’s IRR, and show the
approximate crossover rate.
b.
Is it logical to assume that the firm would take on all available independent, average-
risk projects with returns greater than 12%? If all available projects with returns greater
than 12% have been undertaken, does this mean that cash flows from past investments
have an opportunity cost of only 12% because all the company can do with these cash
flows is to replace money that has a cost of 12%? Does this imply that the WACC is the
correct reinvestment rate assumption for a project’s cash flows? Why or why not?
11-16
NPV PROFILES: SCALE DIFFERENCES
A company is considering two mutually exclusive
expansion plans. Plan A requires a $40 million expenditure on a large-scale integrated plant
that would provide expected cash flows of $6.4 million per year for 20 years. Plan B
requires a $12 million expenditure to build a somewhat less efficient, more labor-intensive
plant with expected cash flows of $2 72 million per year for 20 years. The firm’s WACC
is 10%.
a.
Calculate each project’s NPV and IRR.
b.
Graph the NPV profiles for Plan A and Plan B and approximate the crossover rate.
c.
Calculate the crossover rate where the two projects’ NPVs are equal.

Why is NPV better than IRR for making capital budgeting decisions that add to
shareholder value?

NPV AND IRR
A store has 5 years remaining on its lease in a mall. Rent is $2,000 per month,
60 payments remain, and the next payment is due in 1 month. The mall’s owner plans to sell
the property in a year and wants rent at that time to be high so that the property will appear
more valuable. Therefore, the store has been offered a “great deal” (owner’s words) on a
new 5-year lease. The new lease calls for no rent for 9 months, then payments of $2,600 per
month for the next 51 months. The lease cannot be broken, and the store’s WACC is 12% (or
1% per month).
a.
Should the new lease be accepted? (Hint: Make sure you use 1% per month.)
b.
If the store owner decided to bargain with the mall’s owner over the new lease
payment, what new lease payment would make the store owner indifferent between
the new and old leases? (Hint: Find FV of the old lease’s original cost at t
9; then treat
this as the PV of a 51-period annuity whose payments represent the rent during
months 10 to 60.)
c.
The store owner is not sure of the 12% WACC—it could be higher or lower. At what
nominal WACC would the store owner be indifferent between the two leases? (Hint:
Calculate the differences between the two payment streams; then find its IRR.)

Should the project be accepted if WACC
10%? if WACC
20%? Explain your
reasoning.
c.
Think of some other capital budgeting situations in which negative cash flows during

BASICS OF CAPITAL BUDGETING
You recently went to work for Allied Components Company, a
supplier of auto repair parts used in the after-market with products from Daimler AG, Ford, Toyota,
and other automakers. Your boss, the chief financial officer (CFO), has just handed you the estimated
cash flows for two proposed projects. Project L involves adding a new item to the firm’s ignition system
line; it would take some time to build up the market for this product, so the cash inflows would increase
over time. Project S involves an add-on to an existing line, and its cash flows would decrease over time.
Both projects have 3-year lives because Allied is planning to introduce entirely new models after 3 years.

Depreciation, salvage values, net operating working capital requirements, and tax effects are all
included in these cash flows. The CFO also made subjective risk assessments of each project, and he
concluded that both projects have risk characteristics that are similar to the firm’s average project.
Allied’s WACC is 10%. You must determine whether one or both of the projects should be accepted.
a. What is capital budgeting? Are there any similarities between a firm’s capital budgeting decisions
and an individual’s investment decisions?
b. What is the difference between independent and mutually exclusive projects? Between projects with
normal and nonnormal cash flows?
c. 1. Define the term net present value (NPV). What is each project’s NPV?
2. What is the rationale behind the NPV method? According to NPV, which project(s) should be
accepted if they are independent? Mutually exclusive?
3. Would the NPVs change if the WACC changed? Explain.
d. 1. Define the term internal rate of return (IRR). What is each project’s IRR?
2. How is the IRR on a project related to the YTM on a bond?

if they are independent? Mutually exclusive?
4. Would the projects’ IRRs change if the WACC changed?
e. 1. Draw NPV profiles for Projects L and S. At what discount rate do the profiles cross?
2. Look at your NPV profile graph without referring to the actual NPVs and IRRs. Which project(s)
should be accepted if they are independent? Mutually exclusive? Explain. Are your answers
correct at any WACC less than 23 6%?

2. What are the MIRR’s advantages and disadvantages as compared to the NPV?
h. 1. What is the payback period? Find the paybacks for Projects L and S.
2. What is the rationale for the payback method? According to the payback criterion, which project(s)
should be accepted if the firm’s maximum acceptable payback is 2 years, if Projects L and S are
independent? If Projects L and S are mutually exclusive?
3. What is the difference between the regular and discounted payback methods?
4. What are the two main disadvantages of discounted payback? Is the payback method useful in
capital budgeting decisions? Explain.
i. As a separate project (Project P), the firm is considering sponsoring a pavilion at the upcoming
World’s Fair. The pavilion would cost $800,000, and it is expected to result in $5 million of
incremental cash inflows during its 1 year of operation. However, it would then take another year,
and $5 million of costs, to demolish the site and return it to its original condition. Thus, Project P’s

Home Depot Carefully Evaluates New Investments
Home Depot (HD) has grown phenomenally
over the past two decades. At the beginning
of 1990, HD had 118 stores with annual sales of
$2.8 billion. By early 2013, it had 2,256 stores and
annual sales of $75 billion. Stockholders have
benefited mightily from this growth as the
stock’s price has increased from a split-adjusted
$1.87 in 1990 to $73 in May 2013.
However, during this time period, the news
has not always been good. As you might
expect, the company struggled in 2008 and
2009 in the midst of the financial crisis and a
declining housing market. Discussing its strug-
gles in its 2009 Annual Report, the company’s
management made the following observations:
In fiscal 2008, the Company reduced its
square footage growth plans to improve free
cash flow, provide stronger returns for the
Company, and invest in its existing stores to
continue improving the customer experience.
As a result of this store rationalization plan,
the Company determined that it would no
longer pursue the opening of approximately
50 U.S. stores that had been in its new store
pipeline. The Company expects to dispose
of or sublet these pipeline locations over
varying periods. The Company also closed
15 underperforming U.S. stores in the second
quarter of fiscal 2008, and the Company
expects to dispose of or sublet those locations
over varying periods.
In the years since this annual report was
released, the company slowly continues to open
new stores in areas it thinks the stores will
thrive. For example in 2012, it opened three
new stores in the United States (one of which
was a relocation), it opened nine stores in

Mexico, and it closed seven stores in China. So it is clear that
Home Depot is being very careful when it comes to evaluat-
ing new investments. This caution is understandable: It costs
several million dollars to purchase land, construct a new store,
and stock it with inventory. Therefore, it is critical that the
company perform a financial analysis to determine whether a
potential store’s expected cash flows will cover its costs.
Home Depot uses information from its existing stores to
forecast the new stores’ expected cash flows. Thus far, its
forecasts have been outstanding, but there are always risks.
First, a store’s sales might be less than projected, especially if
the economy weakens. Second, some of HD’s customers
might bypass the store altogether and buy directly from
manufacturers through the Internet. Third, its new stores
could “cannibalize,” or take sales away from, its existing stores.
Rational expansion decisions require detailed assess-
ments of the forecasted cash flows, along with a measure of
the risk that forecasted sales might not be realized. That
information can then be used to determine the risk-adjusted
NPV associated with each potential project. In this chapter, we
describe techniques for estimating projects’ cash flows, as
well as projects’ risks. Companies such as Home Depot use
these techniques on a regular basis when making capital
budgeting decisions.
The basic principles of capital budgeting were covered in Chapter 11. Given a project’s
expected cash flows, it is easy to calculate the primary decision criterion—the NPV—as
well as the supplemental criteria, IRR, MIRR, payback, and discounted payback. However,
in the real world, cash flow values are not just handed to you—rather, they must be
estimated based on information from various sources. Moreover, uncertainty surrounds
the forecasted cash flows, and some projects are more uncertain and thus riskier than
others. In this chapter, we review examples that illustrate how project cash flows are
estimated, discuss techniques for measuring and then dealing with risk, and discuss how
projects are evaluated once they begin operation.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Identify “relevant” cash flows that should and should not be included in a capital
budgeting analysis.
•
Estimate a project’s relevant cash flows and put them into a time line format that can
be used to calculate a project’s NPV, IRR, and other capital budgeting metrics.
•
Explain how risk is measured, and use this measure to adjust the firm’s WACC to
account for differential project riskiness.
•
Discuss how some projects can be altered after they have been accepted, and how
these alterations can change a project’s cash flows and thus its realized NPV.
•
Describe the post-audit, which is an important part of the capital budgeting process,
and discuss its relevance in capital budgeting decisions.
12-1 CONCEPTUAL ISSUES IN CASH FLOW ESTIMATION
Before the cash flow estimation process is illustrated, we need to discuss several
important conceptual issues. A failure to handle these issues properly can lead
to calculating incorrect project NPVs, which will lead to bad capital budgeting
decisions.

12-1A FREE CASH FLOW VERSUS ACCOUNTING INCOME
In the last chapter, we showed that a project’s NPV is equal to the present value of
its discounted free cash flows. Recall from Chapters 3 and 9 that free cash flow is
defined as:
FCF
EBIT 1−T
Depreciation
and amortization
−
Capital
expenditures
Net operating
working capital
A typical project will require the firm to spend money up-front at t
0 to
make the necessary investments in fixed assets and net operating working capital.
In some cases, the firm may also need to make continued investments throughout
the life of the project, particularly for a growing project where the company needs
to steadily add fixed assets and inventory over time. For simplicity, unless other-
wise stated, we will assume that investments in fixed assets and net operating
working capital will occur only at t
0.
After the initial investments are made, the project will hopefully produce
positive cash flows over its operating life. The first bracketed term in the free cash
flow equation EBIT 1 −T
Depreciation and amortization represents the proj-
ect’s operating cash flows. In most cases, these cash flows will vary over the life of
the project.
Once the project is completed, the company sells the project’s fixed assets and
inventory and receives cash.1 In some respects, we can think of the sale of fixed
assets at the end of the project as a negative capital expenditure—instead of using
cash to purchase fixed assets, the company is selling the assets to generate cash.
The price that the company receives for a fixed asset at the end of the project is
often referred to as its salvage value. The company will also have to pay taxes if the
asset’s salvage value exceeds its book value. More specifically:
Taxes paid on salvaged assets
Tax rate
Salvage value
Book value
Here the book value equals the initial price for the asset minus the asset’s total
accumulated depreciation. While depreciation is not a cash expense, it does affect
the company’s taxes. For this reason, what matters is the depreciation rate that the
firm’s accountants use for tax purposes. In many cases, these depreciation rates
and salvage values may be considerably different from the values used in GAAP
accounting to report accounting income in the firm’s financial statements.
Note, that the equation above indicates that the taxes paid would be negative
(i.e., the firm would receive a tax credit) if the company sold the asset for less than
its book value.
As we mentioned above, a project will generally require an initial increase in
NOWC. Assume that Home Depot is considering a project to open a new store.
The company estimates that it will need $5 million in new inventory to stock the
store, $3 million of that inventory will be financed through new accounts payable,
and the remaining $2 million will be paid in cash. If all other working capital
components remain constant, the project will increase the company’s current
operating assets by $5 million and increase the company’s current operating
liabilities by $3 million. The resulting change in NOWC is the $2 million in cash
that is necessary to open the store. If the amount of inventory and accounts
payable remain constant over time, there will be no additional changes in NOWC
over the life of the project. Once the project is completed (the store is closed), the
final $5 million in inventory will be sold and the company will pay off its
remaining $3 million in accounts payable. The firm will receive the remaining
1In many cases, these fixed assets and inventory are “sold” within the company for use in other
projects. In these instances, the company would establish the price that the old project would charge
the new project. These “transfer prices” are important, and well-run companies work hard to make
sure that they are fairly set to insure that assets are efficiently transferred within the company.

$2 million in cash, which corresponds to the investment made for the change in
NOWC that was required when the project began.
12-1B TIMING OF CASH FLOWS
In theory, capital budgeting analyses should deal with cash flows exactly when
they occur; hence, daily cash flows theoretically would be better than annual
flows. However, it would be costly to estimate and analyze daily cash flows,
and they would probably be no more accurate than annual estimates because we
simply cannot accurately forecast at a daily level out 10 years or so into the future.
Therefore, we generally assume that all cash flows occur at the end of the year.
Note, however, for projects with highly predictable cash flows, it might be useful
to assume that cash flows occur at midyear (or even quarterly or monthly); but for
most purposes, we assume end-of-year flows.
12-1C INCREMENTAL CASH FLOWS
Incremental cash flows are flows that will occur if and only if some specific event
occurs. In capital budgeting, the event is the firm’s acceptance of a project and the
project’s incremental cash flows are ones that occur as a result of this decision.
Cash flows such as investments in buildings, equipment, and working capital
needed for the project are obviously incremental, as are sales revenues and
operating costs associated with the project. However, some items are not so
obvious, as we explain later in this section.
12-1D REPLACEMENT PROJECTS
Two types of projects can be distinguished: expansion projects, where the firm
makes an investment, such as a new Home Depot store, and replacement projects,
where the firm replaces existing assets, generally to reduce costs. For example,
suppose Home Depot is considering replacing some of its delivery trucks. The
benefit would be lower fuel and maintenance expenses, and the shiny new trucks
also might improve the company’s image and reduce pollution. Replacement
analysis is complicated by the fact that almost all of the cash flows are incremen-
tal, found by subtracting the new cost numbers from the old numbers. Thus, the
fuel bill for a more efficient new truck might be $10,000 per year versus $15,000 for
the old truck. The $5,000 savings is the incremental cash flow that would be used
in the replacement analysis. Similarly, we would need to find the difference in
depreciation and other factors that affect cash flows. Once we have found the
incremental cash flows, we use them in a “regular” NPV analysis to decide
whether to replace the asset or to continue using it.
12-1E SUNK COSTS
A sunk cost is an outlay that was incurred in the past and cannot be recovered in
the future regardless of whether the project under consideration is accepted.
In capital budgeting, we are concerned with future incremental cash flows—we
want to know if the new investment will produce enough incremental cash flow
to justify the incremental investment. Because sunk costs were incurred in the past and
cannot be recovered regardless of whether the project is accepted or rejected, they are not
relevant in the capital budgeting analysis.
To illustrate this concept, suppose Home Depot spent $2 million to investigate
a potential new store and obtain the permits required to build it. That $2 million
would be a sunk cost—the money is gone, and it won’t come back regardless of
whether or not the new store is built.
Not handling sunk costs properly can lead to incorrect decisions. For example,
suppose Home Depot completed the analysis and found that it must spend an
additional $17 million, on top of the $2 million site study, to open the store.
Sunk Cost
A cash outlay that has
already been incurred and
that cannot be recovered
regardless of whether the
project is accepted or
rejected.
Incremental Cash Flow
A cash flow that will occur
if and only if the firm
takes on a project.

Suppose it then used as the required investment $19 million and calculated the
new store’s projected NPV as negative $1 million. This would indicate that HD
should reject the new store. However, that would be a bad decision. The real issue is
whether the incremental $17 million would result in incremental cash inflows
sufficient to produce a positive NPV. If the $2 million sunk cost is disregarded,
as it should be, the new store’s true NPV will be a positive $1 million. Therefore,
the failure to deal properly with the sunk cost would lead to turning down a
project that would add $1 million to stockholders’ value.
12-1F OPPORTUNITY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS
THE FIRM OWNS
Another issue relates to opportunity costs associated with assets the firm
already owns. For example, suppose Home Depot owns land with a market
value of $2 million and that land will be used for the new store if HD decides
to build it. If HD decides to go forward with the project, only another
$15 million will be required, not the typical $17 million because HD would
not need to buy the required land. Does this mean that HD should use
$15 million as the cost of the new store? The answer is no. If the new store
is not built, HD could sell the land and receive a cash flow of $2 million. This
$2 million is an opportunity cost—something that HD would not receive if the
land was used for the new store. Therefore, the $2 million must be charged to
the new project, and a failure to do so would artificially and incorrectly
increase the new project’s NPV.
Consider further the following example. Assume that a firm owns a building
and equipment with a market (resale) value of $10 million. The property is not
being used, and the firm is considering using it for a new project. The only required
additional investment would be $100,000 for working capital, and the new project
would produce a cash inflow of $50,000 forever. If the firm has a WACC of 10% and
evaluates the project using only the $100,000 of working capital as the required
investment, it would find an NPV of $50,000 0 10
$500,000. Does this mean that
the project is a good one? The answer is no. The firm can sell the property for
$10 million, which is a much larger amount than $500,000.
12-1G EXTERNALITIES
Another potential problem involves externalities, which are defined as the effects
of a project on other parts of the firm or the environment. The three types of
externalities—negative within-firm externalities, positive within-firm externalities,
and environmental externalities—are explained next.
Negative Within-Firm Externalities
As noted earlier, when retailers, such as Home Depot, open new stores that
are too close to their existing stores, this takes customers away from their
existing stores. In this case, even though the new store has positive cash
flows, its existence reduces some of the firm’s current cash flows. This type
of externality is called cannibalization because the new business eats into
the company’s existing business. Manufacturers also can experience canni-
balization. Thus, if Cengage Learning, the publisher of this book, decides
to publish another introductory finance text, that new book will presumably
reduce sales of this one. Those lost cash flows should be taken into account,
and that means charging them as a cost when analyzing the proposed
new book.
Dealing properly with negative externalities can be tricky. If Cengage decides
not to publish the new book because of its cannibalization effects, might another
publisher publish it, causing our book to lose sales regardless of what Cengage
Opportunity Costs
The best return that could
be earned on assets the
firm already owns if those
assets are not used for the
new project.
Cannibalization
The situation when a new
project reduces cash flows
that the firm would
otherwise have had.
Externality
An effect on the firm or
the environment that is
not reflected in the
project’s cash flows.

does? Logically, Cengage must examine the total situation, which is more than a
simple mechanical analysis. Experience and knowledge of the industry is required
to make good decisions.
One of the best examples of a company’s misstep from dealing incorrectly
with cannibalization effects was IBM’s response when transistors made per-
sonal computers possible in the 1970s. IBM’s mainframe computers were the
biggest game in town, and they generated huge profits. But IBM also had
the technology for PCs, entered the PC market, and for a time was the
leading PC company. However, top management decided to rein back
the PC division because managers were afraid it would hurt the more profit-
able mainframe business. That decision opened the door for Microsoft,
Intel, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and others; and IBM went from being the most
profitable firm in the world to one whose very survival was threatened.
To its credit, IBM has been able to successfully shift its emphasis to where
it now focuses on a broad range of technology and business services.
Nevertheless, this experience highlights the fact that while it is essential to
understand the theory of finance, it is equally important to understand the
business environment, including how competitors are likely to react to a
firm’s actions. A great deal of judgment goes into making good financial
decisions.
Positive Within-Firm Externalities
Cannibalization occurs when new products compete with old ones. However,
a new project also can be complementary to an old one, in which case cash
flows in the old operation will be increased when the new one is introduced.
For example, Apple’s iPod was a profitable product; but when Apple made an
investment in another project, its iTunes music store, that investment boosted
sales of the iPod. So if an analysis of the proposed music store indicated
a negative NPV, the analysis would not have been complete unless the incre-
mental cash flows that would occur in the iPod division were credited to the
music store. That might well change the project’s NPV from negative to
positive.
Environmental Externalities
The most common type of negative externality is a project’s impact on the
environment. Government rules and regulations constrain what companies can
do, but firms have some flexibility in dealing with the environment. For example,
suppose a manufacturer is studying a proposed new plant. The company could
meet the environmental regulations at a cost of $1 million, but the plant would still
emit fumes that might cause ill feelings in its neighborhood. Those ill feelings
would not show up in the cash flow analysis, but they still should be considered.
Perhaps a relatively small additional expenditure would reduce the emissions
substantially, make the plant look good relative to other plants in the area, and
provide goodwill that in the future would help the firm’s sales and negotiations
with governmental agencies.
Of course, everyone’s profits depend on the earth remaining healthy, so
companies have an incentive to do things to protect the environment even
though those actions are not required. However, if one firm decides to take
actions that are good for the environment but costly, its products must reflect
those higher costs. If its competitors decide to get by with less costly but less
environmentally friendly processes, they can price their products lower and
make more money. Of course, more environmentally friendly companies can
advertise their environmental efforts, and this might—or might not—offset their
higher costs. All of this illustrates why government regulations are necessary,
both nationally and internationally. Finance, politics, and the environment are
all interconnected.

12-2 ANALYSIS OF AN EXPANSION PROJECT
In Chapter 11, we analyzed two projects, S and L. We were given the cash flows and
used them to illustrate how the NPV, IRR, MIRR, and payback are calculated. In the
real world, a project’s cash flows are rarely just given to you; instead the finance staff
will need to assemble the relevant information. Frequently, this information comes
from a variety of sources within the company. For example, the marketing depart-
ment may provide sales projections, the company’s engineers may estimate costs,
and the accounting staff may provide information about taxes and depreciation.
To illustrate, let’s assume that Allied is considering a new expansion project,
which is Project S that we introduced in Chapter 11. Project S is a new health-food
product that Allied is considering introducing to the market. Along the way,
Allied’s finance staff has received a lot of information, the highlights of which
are summarized below.
•
Project S will require Allied to purchase $900,000 of equipment in 2015 t
0 .
•
Inventory will increase by $175,000 and accounts payable will rise by $75,000.
All other working capital components will stay the same, so the change in net
operating working capital (NOWC) is $100,000 at t
0.
•
The project will last for four years. The company forecasts the following sales:
2,685,000 units in 2016; 2,600,000 units in 2017; 2,525,000 units in 2018; and
2,450,000 units in 2019. Each unit will sell for $2.
•
The fixed cost of producing the product is $2 million each year, and the variable
cost of producing each unit will rise from $1 018 in 2016 to $1 221 in 2019.
•
The company will use accelerated depreciation, however the CFO is also
interested in seeing how the project’s value would change if it instead used
straight-line depreciation.
•
When the project is completed in 2019 t
4 , the company expects that it will
be able to salvage the equipment for $50,000 and that it will fully recover the
NOWC of $100,000.
•
The estimated tax rate is 40%.
•
Based on the perceived risk, the project’s WACC is estimated to be 10%.
To keep things straight, the finance staff has organized all of the key data in
a spreadsheet, which is shown in Table 12.1. Note that unit sales and dollars
(except for unit sales price and variable cost per unit) are in thousands; we omitted
three zeros to streamline the presentation.
Table 12.1 divides the project’s cash flows into three components:
1.
The initial investments that are required at t
0. These include capital
expenditures and changes in net operating working capital ΔNOWC .
2.
The operating cash flows the company receives over the life of the project.
3.
The terminal cash flows that are realized when the project is completed. These
cash flows include the after-tax salvage value of the equipment and the
recovery of the NOWC.
S E L F T E S T
Why should companies use a project’s free cash flows rather than accounting
income when determining a project’s NPV?
Explain the following terms: incremental cash flow, sunk cost, opportunity cost,
externality, and cannibalization.
Provide an example of a “good” externality, that is, one that increases a project’s
true NPV.

Notes:
1.
Accelerated depreciation rates are set by Congress. We show the approximate rates for a 4-year asset in 2013. Companies also have the option of
using straight-line depreciation. Under IRS rules, salvage value is not deducted when establishing the depreciable basis. However, if a salvage
payment is received, it is called a recapture of depreciation and is taxed at the 40% rate.
2.
If the firm owned assets that would be used for the project but would be sold if the project is not accepted, the after-tax value of those assets
would be shown as an “opportunity cost” in the “Investment Outlays” section.
3.
If this project would reduce sales and cash flows from one of the firm’s other divisions, then the after-tax cannibalization effect, or “externality,”
would be deducted from the operating cash flows shown on Row 29.
4.
If the firm had previously incurred costs associated with this project, but those costs could not be recovered regardless of whether this project is
accepted, then they are “sunk costs” and should not enter the analysis.

The column headers in the table, A through I, and the row headers, 12 through 48,
designate cells, which contain the project data. For example, the equipment needed for
Project S will cost $900, and that number is shown in Cell E14 as a negative number.
The equipment is expected to have a salvage value of $50 at the end of the project’s
4-year life; this is shown in Cell I31.2 The new project will require $100 of net
operating working capital; this is shown in Cell E15 as a negative number because it
is a cost, and then it is shown as a positive number in Cell I34 because it is recovered at
the end of Year 4. The total investment at Time 0 is $1,000, which is shown in Cell E35.
Unit sales of Project S are shown on Row 17; they are expected to decline
somewhat over the project’s 4-year life. The sales price, a constant $2, is shown on
Row 18. The projected variable cost per unit is given on Row 19; it generally
increases over time due to expected increases in materials and labor. Sales revenues,
which are calculated as units multiplied by price, are given on Row 20. Variable
costs, equal to units multiplied by VC/unit, are given on Row 21; and fixed costs
excluding depreciation, which are a constant $2,000, are shown on Row 22.
Depreciation is found as the annual rate allowed by the IRS times the depreci-
able basis. As noted in Chapter 3, Congress sets the depreciation rates that can be
used for tax purposes and these are the tax rates used in the capital budgeting
analysis. Congress permits firms to depreciate assets by the straight-line method
or by an accelerated method. As we will see, profitable firms are better off using
accelerated depreciation. We discuss depreciation more fully in Appendix 12A;
but to simplify things for this chapter, we assume that the applicable accelerated
rates for a project with a 4-year life are as given on Row 38 of the depreciation
section of the table and that straight-line rates are as given on Row 41. Thus, we
assume that if the firm uses accelerated depreciation, it will write off 33% of the
basis during Year 1, another 45% in Year 2, and so forth. These are the rates used
to obtain the cash flows shown in the table.
The depreciable basis is the cost of the equipment including any shipping or
installation costs, or $900 as shown in Cells E14, C38, and C41. The total deprecia-
tion over the 4 years equals the cost of the equipment.
If for some reason the firm decided to use straight-line depreciation, it could
write off a constant $225 per year. Its total cash flows over the entire 4 years would
be the same as under accelerated depreciation; but under straight line, those cash
flows would come in a bit slower than under accelerated depreciation because the
firm would have higher tax payments in the early years and lower tax payments
in later years.
We calculate the annual cash flows for Project S over the 4 years in Columns F,
G, H, and I, with operating cash flows shown on Row 29. On Rows 31–34, we
include the terminal cash flows in Year 4 to arrive at the project’s free cash flows
on Row 35. These numbers are identical to the cash flows used in Chapter 11 for
Project S. Because the numbers are the same, the NPV, IRR, MIRR, and payback
shown in Cells C45 through C48 are identical to those we calculated in Chapter 11.
The Excel model used to create Table 12.1 is part of the chapter Excel model
available on the text’s website, www.cengagebrain.com. We recommend that
anyone with a computer and some familiarity with Excel access the model and
work through it to see how the table was generated. Anyone doing real-world
capital budgeting today would use such a model; and our model provides a good
template, or starting point, if and when you need to analyze an actual project.
12-2A EFFECT OF DIFFERENT DEPRECIATION RATES
If we replaced the accelerated depreciation numbers in Table 12.1 with the con-
stant $225 values that would exist under the straight line method, the result would
be a free cash flow time line on Row 35 that has the same total flows. However, in
2The equipment will be fully depreciated after 4 years. Therefore, the $50 estimated salvage value will
exceed the book value, which will be zero. This $50 gain is classified as a recapture of depreciation, and
it is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.

the early years, the cash flows resulting from straight-line depreciation would be
lower than those now in the table; and the later years’ cash flows would show
higher numbers. Because of the time value of money, dollars received earlier have
a higher present value than dollars received later. Therefore, Project S’s NPV is
higher if the firm uses accelerated depreciation. The exact effect is shown in the
Project Evaluation section of Table 12.1—the NPV is $78 82 under accelerated
depreciation and $64 44, or 18% less, with straight line.
Now suppose Congress wants to encourage companies to increase their
capital expenditures to boost economic growth and employment. What change
in depreciation would have the desired effect? The answer is to make accelerated
depreciation even more accelerated. For example, if the firm could write off this
4-year equipment at rates of 50%, 35%, 10%, and 5%, its early tax payments would
be lower, early cash flows would be higher, and the project’s NPV would be
higher than that shown in Table 12.1.
12-2B CANNIBALIZATION
Project S does not involve any cannibalization effects. Suppose, however, that
Project S would reduce the after-tax cash flows of another division by $50 per year.
No other firm would take on this project if our firm turns it down. In this case,
we would add a row at about Row 28 and deduct $50 for each year. If this were
done, Project S would now have a negative NPV; hence, it would be rejected.
On the other hand, if Project S would cause additional flows in some other division
(a positive externality), those after-tax inflows should be attributed to Project S.
12-2C OPPORTUNITY COSTS
Now suppose the $900 initial cost shown in Table 12.1 was based on the assump-
tion that the project would save money by using some equipment the company
now owns and that equipment would be sold for $100, after taxes, if the project is
rejected. The $100 is an opportunity cost, and it should be reflected in our
calculations. We would add $100 to the project’s cost. The result would be an
NPV of $78 82 −$100
−$21 18, so the project would now be rejected.
12-2D SUNK COSTS
Now suppose the firm had spent $150 on a marketing study to estimate potential
sales. This $150 could not be recovered regardless of whether the project is
accepted or rejected. Should the $150 be charged to Project S when determining
its NPV for capital budgeting purposes? The answer is no. We are interested only
in incremental costs. The $150 is not an incremental cost; it is a sunk cost. Therefore,
it should not enter into the analysis.
One additional point should be made about sunk costs. If the $150 expendi-
ture was actually made, in the final analysis, Project S would turn out to be a loser:
Its NPV would be $78 82 −$150
−$71 18. If we could somehow back up
and reconsider the project before the $150 had been spent, we would see that the
project should be rejected. However, we can’t back up—at this point, we can
either abandon the project or spend $1,000 and go forward with it. If we go
forward, we will receive an incremental NPV of $78 82, which would reduce the loss
from −$150 to −$71 18.
12-2E OTHER CHANGES TO THE INPUTS
Variables other than depreciation also could be varied, and these changes would
alter the calculated cash flows and thus NPV and IRR. For example, we could
increase or decrease the projected unit sales, the sales price, the variable and/or
the fixed costs, the initial investment cost, the working capital requirements, the
salvage value, and even the tax rate if we thought Congress was likely to raise or

lower taxes. Such changes could be made easily in an Excel model, making it
possible to see the resulting changes in NPV and IRR immediately. This is called
sensitivity analysis, and we discuss it in Section 12-5 when we take up procedures
for measuring projects’ risks.
12-3 REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS3
In the last section, we assumed that Project S was an entirely new project. So all of
its cash flows were incremental—they occurred only if the firm accepted the
project. This is true for expansion projects; but for replacement projects, we must
find cash flow differentials between the new and old projects and these differentials
are the incremental cash flows that we analyze.
We evaluate a replacement decision in Table 12.2, which is set up much like
Table 12.1, but with data on both a new, highly efficient machine (which will be
depreciated on an accelerated basis) and the old machine (which is depreciated on
a straight-line basis). Here we find the firm’s cash flows when it continues using
the old machine and the cash flows when it decides to purchase a new machine.
Finally, we subtract the old flows from the new to arrive at the incremental cash
flows. We used Excel in our analysis; but again, we could have used a calculator or
pencil and paper. Here are the key inputs used in the analysis. No additional
operating working capital is needed.

The key here is to find the incremental cash flows. As noted previously, we
find the cash flows from the operation with the old machine, then find the cash
flows with the new machine, then find the differences in the cash flows. This
is what we do in Parts I, II, and III of Table 12.2. Because there will be an
additional expenditure to purchase the new machine, that cost is shown in Cell
E24. However, we can sell the old machine for $400, so that is shown as an inflow
in Cell E25. The cash outlay at Time 0 is $1,600, as shown in Cell E35.
The cash flows based on the old machine are shown on Row 22, and those for
the new one are on Row 35. Then on Row 37, we show the differences in the cash
flows with and without replacement—these are the incremental cash flows used to
find the replacement NPV. When we evaluate the incremental cash flows, we see
that the replacement has an NPV of $80 28, so the old machine should be replaced.4
In some instances, replacements add capacity as well as lower operating
costs. When this is the case, sales revenues in Part II would be increased; and
if that led to an increase in net operating working capital, that number would
be shown as a Time 0 expenditure along with its recovery at the end of the
project’s life. These changes would, of course, be reflected in the differential
cash flows on Row 37.
12-4 RISK ANALYSIS IN CAPITAL BUDGETING5
Projects differ in risk, and risk should be reflected in capital budgeting
decisions. However, it is difficult to measure risk, especially for new proj-
ects where no history exists. For this reason, managers deal with risk in
many different ways, ranging from almost totally subjective adjustments to
highly sophisticated analyses that involve computer simulation and com-
plex statistics.
Three separate and distinct types of risk are involved:
1.
Stand-alone risk, which is a project’s risk assuming (a) that it is the only asset
the firm has and (b) that the firm is the only stock in each investor’s portfolio.
Stand-alone risk is measured by the variability of the project’s expected
returns. Diversification is totally ignored.
2.
Corporate, or within-firm, risk, which is a project’s risk to the corporation
as opposed to its investors. Within-firm risk takes account of the fact that the
S E L F T E S T
What role do incremental cash flows play in a replacement analysis?
If you were analyzing a replacement project and you suddenly learned that the
old equipment could be sold for $1,000 rather than $100, would this new
information make the replacement look better or worse?
In Table 12.2, we assumed that output would not change if the old machine was
replaced. Suppose output would actually double. How would this change be
dealt with in the framework of Table 12.2?
Stand-Alone Risk
The risk an asset would
have if it were a firm’s
only asset and if investors
owned only one stock. It is
measured by the
variability of the asset’s
expected returns.
Corporate (Within-Firm)
Risk
Risk considering the firm’s
diversification but not
stockholder diversification.
It is measured by a
project’s effect on
uncertainty about the
firm’s expected future
returns.
4We could have found the incremental cash flows by calculating the differences in the only factors that
change, the net cost of the new machine, operating cost savings reduced for the taxes, and the
differences in depreciation, which save some taxes. This procedure is shown in Part IV of the table.
The two procedures produce the same incremental cash flows and NPV, as they must.
5Some professors may choose to cover some of the risk sections (12-4 through 12-6) and skip others.
We offer a range of choices, and we tried to make the exposition clear enough that interested and
self-motivated students can read these sections on their own even if the sections are not assigned.

project is only one asset in the firm’s portfolio of assets; hence, some of its risk
will be eliminated by diversification within the firm. This type of risk is
measured by the project’s impact on uncertainty about the firm’s future returns.
3.
Market, or beta, risk, which is the riskiness of the project as seen by a well-
diversified stockholder who recognizes (a) that the project is only one of the
firm’s assets and (b) that the firm’s stock is but one part of his or her stock
portfolio. The project’s market risk is measured by its effect on the firm’s beta
coefficient.
Taking on a project with a great deal of stand-alone or corporate risk will
not necessarily affect the firm’s beta. However, if the project has high stand-
alone risk and if its returns are highly correlated with returns on the firm’s
other assets and with returns on most other stocks in the economy, the
project will have a high degree of all three types of risk. Market risk is
theoretically the most relevant of the three because it is the one reflected in
stock prices. Unfortunately, market risk is also the most difficult to estimate,
primarily because new projects don’t have “market prices” that can be related
to stock market returns. Therefore, most decision makers do a quantitative
analysis of stand-alone risk and then consider the other two risk measures in
a qualitative manner.
Projects are generally classified into several categories. Then with the firm’s
overall WACC as a starting point, a risk-adjusted cost of capital is assigned to
each category. For example, a firm might establish three risk classes, assign the
corporate WACC to average-risk projects, add a 5% risk premium for higher-risk
projects, and subtract 2% for low-risk projects. Under this setup, if the company’s
overall WACC was 10%, 10% would be used to evaluate average-risk projects,
15% for high-risk projects, and 8% for low-risk projects. While this approach is
probably better than not making any risk adjustments, these adjustments are
highly subjective and difficult to justify. Unfortunately, there’s no perfect way to
specify how high or low the adjustments should be.6
12-5 MEASURING STAND-ALONE RISK
A project’s stand-alone risk reflects uncertainty about its cash flows. The required
investment, unit sales, sales prices, and operating costs shown in Table 12.1 for
Project S are subject to uncertainty. First-year sales were projected at 2,685 units
(actually, 2,685,000, but we shortened it to 2,685 to streamline the analysis) to
be sold at a price of $2 per unit. However, unit sales would almost certainly be
somewhat higher or lower than 2,685, and the price would probably turn out to

be different from the projected $2 per unit. Similarly, the other variables would
probably differ from their indicated values. Indeed, all the inputs are expected values,
and actual values can vary from expected values.
Three techniques are used to assess stand-alone risk: (1) sensitivity analysis,
(2) scenario analysis, and (3) Monte Carlo simulation. We discuss them in the
following sections.
12-5A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Intuitively, we know that a change in a key input variable such as units sold or
sales price will cause the NPV to change. Sensitivity analysis measures the percen-
tage change in NPV that results from a given percentage change in an input, other
variables held at their expected values. This is by far the most commonly used type of
risk analysis, and it is used by most firms. It begins with a base-case situation,
where the project’s NPV is found using the base-case value for each input variable.
Here’s a list of the key inputs for Project S:
•
Equipment cost
•
Change in net operating working capital
•
Unit sales
•
Sales price
•
Variable cost per unit
•
Fixed operating costs
•
Tax rate
•
WACC
The data we used back in Table 12.1 were the most likely, or base-case, values;
and the resulting NPV, $78 82, is the base-case NPV. It’s easy to imagine
changes in the inputs, and those changes would result in different NPVs.
When senior managers review capital budgeting studies, they are interested in
the base-case NPV, but they always go on to ask the financial analyst a series of
“what if” questions: What if unit sales turn out to be 25% below the base-case
level? What if market conditions force us to price the product at $1 80, not $2?
What if variable costs are higher than we forecasted? Sensitivity analysis is
designed to provide answers to such questions. Each variable is increased or
decreased from its expected value, holding other variables constant at their base-
case levels. Then the NPV is calculated using the changed input. Finally, the
resulting set of NPVs is plotted to show how sensitive NPV is to changes in each
variable.
Figure 12.1 shows Project S’s sensitivity graph for six key variables. The
table below the graph gives the NPVs based on different values of the
inputs, and those NPVs were then plotted to make the graph. Figure 12.1
shows that as unit sales and price increase, the project’s NPV increases,
whereas the opposite is true for the other four input variables. An increase
in variable costs, fixed costs, equipment costs, and WACC lowers the proj-
ect’s NPV. The ranges shown at the bottom of the table and the slopes of the
lines in the graph indicate how sensitive NPV is to changes in each input.
When the data are plotted in Figure 12.1, the slopes of the lines in the graph
indicate how sensitive NPV is to each input: The larger the range, the steeper
the variable’s slope and the more sensitive the NPV is to changes in this variable.
We see that NPV is very sensitive to changes in the sales price, fairly
sensitive to changes in variable costs, a bit less sensitive to units sold and
fixed costs, but not very sensitive to changes in the equipment cost or the
WACC.
If we were comparing two projects, the one with the steeper sensitivity lines
would be riskier, other things held constant, because relatively small changes in

the input variables would produce large changes in the NPV. Thus, sensitivity
analysis provides useful insights into a project’s risk.7
12-5B SCENARIO ANALYSIS
In sensitivity analysis, we change one variable at a time. However, it is useful to
know what would happen to the project’s NPV if all of the inputs turned out to be
better or worse than expected. Also, we can assign probabilities to the good, bad,

Sensitivity Graph for Project S

Notes:
1.
When all of the inputs are set at their base-case levels, their deviations from base are all zero, and the NPV is $78.82. So, the vertical axis intercept is
at $78.82.
2.
If the sales price is set 25% above its expected $2 price and all other variables are set at their expected values, then the NPV would be +$2,526.86. If
the price is set 25% below its expected $2 price, then the NPV would be −$2,369.22. All the other NPVs shown in the table were found similarly.
Excel Data Tables were used to streamline the calculations.
3.
Note that the best- and worst-case NPVs are different from those in the next section, which shows scenario analysis. In scenario analysis, all the
variables are 25% above or below their expected levels, so the best- and worst-case NPVs are much higher or lower than those in the sensitivity
analysis, where only one variable is set at its best or worst level.
7Sensitivity analysis is tedious using a regular calculator but easy using a spreadsheet. We used the
chapter’s Excel model to calculate the NPVs and to draw the graph in Figure 12.1. To conduct such an
analysis by hand would be quite time-consuming, and if the basic data were changed even slightly—
say the cost of the equipment was increased slightly—all of the calculations would have to be redone.
With a spreadsheet, by simply typing over the old input with the new one, the analysis is changed
instantaneously.

and most likely (or base-case) scenarios, then find the expected value and the
standard deviation of the NPV. Scenario analysis allows for these extensions—it
allows us to change more than one variable at a time, and it incorporates the
probabilities of changes in the key variables.
In a scenario analysis, we begin with the base-case scenario, which uses the
most likely set of input values. We then ask marketing, engineering, and other
operating managers to specify a worst-case scenario (low unit sales, low sales
price, high variable costs, and so forth) and a best-case scenario. Often the best
and worst cases are defined as having a 25% probability of conditions being that
good or bad, with a 50% probability for the base-case conditions. Obviously,
conditions can take on more than three values, but such a scenario setup is useful
to help understand the project’s riskiness.
The best-case, base-case, and worst-case values for Project S are shown in
Figure 12.2, along with plots of the data. If the project is highly successful, the
combination of a high sales price, low production costs, and high unit sales will
result in a very high NPV, $7,450 38. However, if things turn out badly, the NPV
will be a negative $4,782 40. The graphs show the wide range of possibilities,
suggesting that this is a risky project. If the bad conditions materialize, the
company will not go bankrupt—this is just one project for a large company. Still,
losing $4,782 40 (or $4,782,400 as we are working in thousands of dollars) would
hurt the company’s stock price.
If we multiply each scenario’s probability by the NPV under that scenario
and then sum the products, we will have the project’s expected NPV, $706 40
as shown in Figure 12.2. Note that the expected NPV differs from the base-case
NPV. This is not an error—mathematically, they are not equal. We also
calculate the standard deviation of the expected NPV; it is $4,370 24. When
we divide the standard deviation by the expected NPV, we calculate the
coefficient of variation, 6 19, which is a measure of stand-alone risk. The firm’s
average-risk project has a coefficient of variation of about 2 0, so the CV of
6 19 indicates that this project is much riskier than most of the firm’s other
projects.
Our firm’s WACC is 10%, so that rate should be used to find the NPV of
an average-risk project. Project S is riskier than average, so a higher discount
rate should be used to find its NPV. There is no way to determine the
“correct” discount rate—this is a judgment call. However, some firms increase
the corporate WACC when they evaluate projects deemed to be relatively
risky and reduce it for low-risk projects. When the NPV was recalculated
using a 12 5% WACC, the base-case NPV fell from $78 82 to $33 62; so the
project still had a positive NPV when its expected cash flows were discounted
at the risk-adjusted WACC.
Note that the base-case results are the same in our sensitivity and scenario
analyses; but in the scenario analysis, the worst case is much worse than in the
sensitivity analysis and the best case is much better. In scenario analysis, all of
the variables are set at their best or worst values, while in sensitivity analysis,
only one variable is adjusted and all the others are left at their base-case
values.
12-5C MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
Monte Carlo simulation, so named because this type of analysis grew out of
work on the mathematics of casino gambling, is a sophisticated version
of scenario analysis. Here the project is analyzed under a large number of
scenarios, or “runs.” In the first run, the computer randomly picks a value for
each variable—units sold, sales price, variable costs per unit, and so forth.
Those values are then used to calculate an NPV, and that NPV is stored in the
computer’s memory. Next, a second set of input values is selected at random

and a second NPV is calculated. This process is repeated perhaps 1,000 times,
generating 1,000 NPVs. The mean of the 1,000 NPVs is determined and used
as a measure of the project’s expected profitability, and the standard deviation
(or perhaps the coefficient of variation) of the NPVs is used as a measure
of risk.
Monte Carlo simulation is technically more complex than scenario analysis,
but simulation software makes the process manageable. Simulation is useful; but
because of its complexity, a detailed discussion is best left for advanced finance
courses.8

8To use Monte Carlo simulation, one needs probability distributions for the inputs and correlation
coefficients between each pair of inputs. It is often difficult to obtain “reasonable” values for the
correlations, especially for new projects where no historical data are available. This limits the use of
simulation analysis.

Capital Budgeting Practices in the Asian/Pacific Region
A 1999 survey of executives in Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore asked several questions
about companies’ capital budgeting practices. The study yielded
the results summarized here.
Techniques for Evaluating Corporate Projects
Consistent with U.S. companies, most companies in this region
evaluate projects using IRR, NPV, and payback. IRR usage ranged
from 96% (in Australia) to 86% (in Hong Kong). NPV usage ranged
from 96% (in Australia) to 81% (in the Philippines). Payback usage
ranged from 100% (in Hong Kong and the Philippines) to 81% (in
Indonesia).
Techniques for Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital
Recall from Chapter 10 that three basic approaches can be used
to estimate the cost of equity: CAPM, dividend yield plus growth
rate (DCF), and cost of debt plus a risk premium. The use of these
methods varied considerably from country to country (see Table A).
The CAPM is used most often by U.S. firms. This is also true for
Australian firms, but not for the other Asian/Pacific firms, which
instead more often use the DCF and risk premium approaches.
Techniques for Assessing Risk
Firms in the Asian/Pacific region rely heavily on scenario and

12-6 WITHIN-FIRM AND BETA RISK9
Sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation as described in
the preceding section dealt with stand-alone risk. They provide useful information
about a project’s risk; but if the project is negatively correlated with the firm’s
other projects, it might stabilize the firm’s total earnings and thus be relatively
safe. Similarly, if a project is negatively correlated with returns on most stocks, it
might reduce the firm’s beta and thus be correctly evaluated with a relatively low
WACC. So in theory, we should be more concerned with within-firm and beta risk
than with stand-alone risk.
Although managers recognize the importance of within-firm and beta risk,
they generally end up dealing with these risks subjectively, or judgmentally,
rather than quantitatively. The problem is that to measure diversification’s
effects on risk, we need the correlation coefficient between a project’s returns and
returns on the firm’s other assets, which requires historical data that obviously
do not exist for new projects. Experienced managers generally have a “feel”
for how a project’s returns will relate to returns on the firm’s other assets.
Generally, positive correlation is expected; and if the correlation is high, stand-
alone risk will be a good proxy for within-firm risk. Similarly, managers can
make judgmental estimates about whether a project’s returns will be high
when the economy and the stock market are strong (hence, what the project’s
beta should be). But for the most part, those estimates are subjective, not based
on actual data.
However, projects occasionally involve an entirely new product line, such as a
steel company going into iron ore mining. In such cases, the firm may be able to
obtain betas for “pure-play” companies in the new area. For example, this steel
company might get the average beta for a group of mining companies such as Rio
Tinto and BHP Billiton, assume that its mining subsidiary has similar character-
istics, and use the average beta of the “comparables” to calculate a WACC for the
mining subsidiary. While the pure-play approach makes sense for some projects,
its use is rare. Just think about it. How would you find a pure-play proxy for a
new inventory control system, machine tool, truck, or most other projects? The
answer is, you couldn’t.
Our conclusions regarding risk analysis are as follows:
•
It is very difficult, if not impossible, to quantitatively measure projects’
within-firm and beta risks.
•
Most projects’ returns are positively correlated with returns on the firm’s
other assets and with returns on the stock market. This being the case, because
stand-alone risk is correlated with within-firm and market risk, not much is
lost by focusing just on stand-alone risk.
•
Experienced managers make many judgmental assessments, including those
related to risk; and they work them into the capital budgeting process.
Introductory students like neat, precise answers; and they want to make
decisions on the basis of calculated NPVs. Experienced managers consider
quantitative NPVs, but they also bring subjective judgment into the decision
process.
•
If a firm does not use the types of analyses covered in this book, it will
have trouble. On the other hand, if a firm tries to quantify everything
and let a computer make its decisions, it too will have trouble. Good
managers understand and use the theory of finance, but they apply it
with judgment.

12-7 REAL OPTIONS10
Traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis—where cash flows are esti-
mated and then discounted to obtain the expected NPV—has been the corner-
stone of capital budgeting since the 1950s. However, in recent years it has been
shown that DCF techniques do not always lead to proper capital budgeting
decisions.
DCF techniques were originally developed to value securities such as stocks
and bonds. These are passive investments—once the investment has been made,
most investors can take no actions that influence the cash flows they produce.11
However, capital budgeting projects are not passive investments—managers can
often take positive actions after the investment has been made that alter the cash
flow stream. Opportunities for such actions are called real options—“real” to
distinguish them from financial options like an option to purchase shares of
Boeing stock, and “options” because they offer the right but not the obligation
to take the future action to increase cash flows. Real options are valuable, but this
value is not captured by conventional NPV analysis. Therefore, a project’s real
options must be considered separately.
12-7A TYPES OF REAL OPTIONS
There are several types of real options, including (1) abandonment, where the
project can be shut down if its cash flows are low; (2) timing, where a project
can be delayed until more information about demand and/or costs can be
obtained; (3) expansion, where the project can be expanded if demand turns out
to be stronger than expected; (4) output flexibility, where the output can be changed
if market conditions change; and (5) input flexibility, where the inputs used in
the production process (say, coal versus natural gas for generating electricity)
can be changed if input prices and/or availability change. We illustrate abandon-
ment options here in the text and we cover other types of options in Web
Appendix 12F.
12-7B ABANDONMENT OPTIONS
In capital budgeting we generally assume that a project will be operated for its full
physical life. However, this is not always the best course of action. If the firm has
the option to abandon a project during its operating life, this can lower its risk,
increase its expected profitability, and raise its calculated NPV.
S E L F T E S T
Is it easier to measure the stand-alone, within-firm, or beta risk for projects such as a
new delivery truck or a Home Depot warehouse?
If a firm cannot measure a potential project’s risk with precision, should it
abandon the project? Explain your answer.
Abandonment Option
The option to shut down a
project if operating cash
flows turn out to be lower
than expected. This option
can both raise expected
profitability and lower
project risk.
10This section is relatively technical, but it can be omitted without a loss of continuity if there is
insufficient time to cover it.

then influence the firms’ operations and cash flows. However, the average stockholder does not have this
influence.

Table 12.3 gives a picture of the decision tree for Project S. In the scenario
analysis in Section 12-5 we examined Project S under the Best Case, Base Case,
and Worst Case assumptions. In the worst-case situation, the project has nega-
tive cash flows for its full 4-year life. However, if the company can abandon the
project after Year 1, when it sees that it is not a success, then its expected
NPV can be improved. The earlier analysis is reproduced in the top section of
Table 12.3, labeled “No Abandonment.” In Column C, which is Time 0, we see
that the firm must invest between $750 and $1,250. Columns D through G show
the annual cash flows under each scenario, and in Column H we show the
WACCs for each scenario. Then, in Column I, we show the NPV under each
scenario when the cash flows are discounted at their respective WACCs. The
sum of the products obtained by multiplying each probability times each branch
NPV is the expected NPV, which is $706 40. The standard deviation and the
coefficient of variation are also calculated to provide an idea of the project’s risk.
This project has a positive expected NPV; hence, by the NPV criterion it should
be accepted.
Now suppose the company could make a second decision, at t
1, to aban-
don (or shut down) the project if things go badly during Year 1. To see what
would happen then, we add another branch to the tree, as shown in the Worst #2
row in Table 12.3 under the “Can Abandon” situation. Here we assume that the
company abandons the project at the end of Year 1, when information about the
actual production costs and demand conditions become available. If things were

going well, the project would be continued. However, if things were going badly,
the firm would close the operation and not suffer the indicated losses during the
next 3 years.12
Given the “Can Abandon” option, the firm would clearly prefer to abandon
the project than to continue it under the worst-case scenario. Therefore, we assign
a zero probability to continuing after a bad start. Therefore, the 25% probability
associated with the worst case is used for “Worst #2” and a 0% probability is
assigned to “Worst #1.”
The option to abandon raises the expected NPV from $706 40 to $1,350 09, and
it also lowers the standard deviation. Those changes combine to lower the coeffi-
cient of variation from 6 19 to 2 70. The coefficient of variation is still above the
company’s average CV of 2 0, which indicates that the project is still more risky
than most, even after the abandonment option has been considered. Therefore, the
12 50% WACC is still appropriate for discounting this project’s free cash flows.
Also, note that the difference between the expected NPVs with and without
abandonment represents the option value to abandon this project. As shown in
the lower part of Table 12.3, this option is worth $643 68. If the NPV of the “No
Abandonment” situation had been negative, then the value of the option would
simply have been the NPV of the “Can Abandon” situation.
With this project, the ability to abandon it makes the NPV look better, but it
does not reverse the accept/reject decision. However, it often turns out that if we
fail to consider abandonment, the bad case is so bad that the expected NPV is
negative, but when abandonment is considered, the expected NPV becomes
positive. Clearly, abandonment must be considered to obtain valid assessments
for different projects, and the opportunity to abandon a project is an important
way to limit downside losses.
Note too that it might be necessary for the firm to arrange things so that it has
the possibility of abandonment when it is making the initial decision about a
project. This might require contractual arrangements with suppliers, customers,
and its union, and there might be some costs to obtaining these advance permis-
sions. Any such costs could be compared with the value of the option as we
calculated it, and this could enter into the initial decision.
12-8 THE OPTIMAL CAPITAL BUDGET
Thus far, we have described various factors that managers consider when they
evaluate individual projects. For planning purposes, managers must also fore-
cast the total capital budget, because the amount of capital raised affects

the WACC and thus influences projects’ NPVs. We use Data Devices Inc.
(DDI), a manufacturer and distributor of storage devices, to illustrate how this
process works.
Step 1. The treasurer obtains an estimate of the firm’s overall composite
WACC. As we discussed in Chapter 10, this composite WACC is
based on market conditions, the firm’s capital structure, and the riski-
ness of its assets. DDI’s projects are roughly similar from year to year
in terms of their risks.
Step 2. The corporate WACC is scaled up or down for each of the firm’s
divisions to reflect the division’s risk. DDI, for example, assigns a
factor of 0 9 to its stable, low-risk replacement battery division, but
a factor of 1 1 to its large disk drives, which it sells to computer
manufacturers and whose business is extremely competitive. There-
fore, if the corporate cost of capital is determined to be 10 50%, the cost
of capital for the battery division is 0 9 10 50%
9 45%, while that for
the disk-drive division is 1 1 10 50%
11 55%.
Step 3. Financial managers within each of the firm’s divisions estimate the
relevant cash flows and risks of each of their potential projects. The
estimated cash flows should explicitly consider any embedded real
options. Then, within each division, projects are classified into one of
three groups—high risk, average risk, and low risk—and the same 0 9
and 1 1 factors are used to adjust the divisional cost of capital esti-
mates. (A factor of 1 0 would be used for an average-risk project.) For
example, a low-risk project in the battery division would be assigned a
cost of capital of 0 9 9 45%
8 51%, while a high-risk project in the
disk-drive division would have a cost of 1 1 11 55%
12 71%.
Step 4. Each project’s NPV is then determined, using its risk-adjusted cost of
capital. The optimal capital budget consists of all independent projects
with positive NPVs plus those mutually exclusive projects with the
highest positive NPVs.
In estimating its optimal capital budget, we assumed that DDI can obtain
financing for all of its profitable projects. This assumption is reasonable for large,
mature firms with good track records. However, smaller firms, new firms, and
firms with dubious track records, may have difficulties raising capital, even for
projects that the firm concludes would have highly positive NPVs. In such cir-
cumstances, the size of the capital budget may be constrained, a situation called
capital rationing. If capital is limited, it should be used in the most efficient way
possible. Procedures have been developed for allocating capital so as to maximize
the aggregate NPV subject to the constraint that the capital rationing ceiling is not
exceeded. However, these procedures are extremely complicated, so they are best
left for advanced finance courses.
The procedures discussed in this section cannot be implemented with preci-
sion. However, they do force the firm to think carefully about each division’s
relative risk, about the risk of each project within the divisions, and about the
relationship between the total amount of capital raised and the cost of that capital.
Further, the process forces the firm to adjust its capital budget to reflect capital
market conditions. If the costs of debt and equity rise, this fact will be reflected in
the cost of capital used to evaluate projects, and projects that would be marginally
acceptable when capital costs were low would (correctly) be ruled unacceptable
when capital costs become high.

12-9 THE POST-AUDIT
A final aspect of the capital budgeting process is the post-audit, which involves
(1) comparing actual results with those predicted by the project’s sponsors and
(2) explaining why any differences occurred. For example, many firms require
that the operating divisions send a monthly report for the first six months
after a project goes into operation and a quarterly report thereafter, until the
project’s results meet expectations. From then on, reports on the operation
are reviewed on a regular basis like those of other operations. The post-audit
has two main purposes:
1.
Improve forecasts. When decision makers are forced to compare their
projections with actual outcomes, there is a tendency for estimates to improve.
Conscious or unconscious biases are observed and eliminated; new
forecasting methods are sought as the need for them becomes apparent; and
people simply tend to do everything better, including forecasting, if they
know that their actions are being monitored.
2.
Improve operations. Businesses are run by people, and people can perform at
higher or lower levels of efficiency. When a divisional team has made a
forecast about an investment, the team members are, in a sense, putting their
reputations on the line. Accordingly, if costs are above and sales below
predicted levels, then executives in production, marketing, and other areas
will strive to improve operations and to bring results into line with forecasts.
In a discussion related to this point, one executive made this statement: “You
academicians only worry about making good decisions. In business, we also
worry about making decisions good.”
The post-audit is not a simple process. First, we must recognize that each
element of the cash flow forecast is subject to uncertainty, so a percentage of all
projects undertaken by any reasonably aggressive firm will necessarily go awry.
This fact must be considered when appraising the performances of the operating
executives who sponsor projects. Second, projects sometimes fail to meet expecta-
tions for reasons beyond the control of their sponsors and for reasons that no one
could be expected to anticipate. Third, it is often difficult to separate the operating
results of one investment from those of a larger system. Although some projects
stand alone and permit ready identification of costs and revenues, the cost savings
that result from assets like new computers may be very hard to measure. Fourth, it
is often hard to hand out blame or praise because the executives who were
responsible for launching a given investment have moved on by the time the
results are known.

Because of these difficulties, some firms tend to play down the importance of
the post-audit. However, observations of both businesses and governmental units
suggest that the best-run and most successful organizations put a lot of emphasis
on post-audits. Accordingly, we regard the post-audit as an important element in
a good capital budgeting system.
This chapter focused on estimating the free cash flows that are used in a capital
budgeting analysis, appraising the riskiness of those flows, finding NPVs when risk
is present, and calculating the NPVs of mutually exclusive projects having unequal
lives. Here is a summary of our primary conclusions:
•
Some cash flows are relevant (hence, should be included in a capital budgeting
analysis), while others should not be included. The key question is this: Is
the cash flow incremental in the sense that it will occur if and only if the
project is accepted?
•
Sunk costs are not incremental costs—they are not affected by accepting or
rejecting the project. Cannibalization and other externalities, on the other
hand, are incremental—they will occur if and only if the project is
accepted.
•
The cash flows used to analyze a project are different from a project’s
net income. One important factor is that depreciation is deducted when
accountants calculate net income, but because it is a noncash charge,
it must be added back to find cash flows.
•
Many projects require additional net operating working capital. An increase
in net operating working capital is an additional outlay when the project is
started but is an inflow at the end of the project’s life, when the capital is
recovered (i.e., the investment in operating working capital is reduced when
the project is completed).
•
We considered two types of projects, expansion and replacement. For a
replacement project, we find the difference in the free cash flows when the
firm continues to use the old asset versus the new asset. If the NPV of the
differential flows is positive, the replacement should be made.
•
The forecasted free cash flows (and hence NPV and other outputs) are only
estimates—they may turn out to be incorrect, and this means risk.
•
There are three types of risk: stand-alone, within-firm, and market (or beta) risk.
In theory, market risk is most relevant; but because it cannot be measured for

most projects, stand-alone risk is the one on which we generally focus.
However, firms subjectively consider within-firm and market risk, which
they definitely should not ignore. Note, though, that because the three types
of risk are generally positively correlated, stand-alone risk is often a good
proxy for the other risks.
•
Stand-alone risk can be analyzed using sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis,
and/or Monte Carlo simulation.
•
Once a decision has been made about a project’s relative risk, we determine
a risk-adjusted WACC for evaluating it.
•
Real options enable firms to take actions to alter the originally forecasted cash
flows after a project is in operation. These options can increase NPVs and
reduce risk.
•
The post-audit, which compares the project’s actual performance to its
expected results, is an important part of the capital budgeting process.

PROJECT AND RISK ANALYSIS
As a financial analyst, you must evaluate a proposed
project to produce printer cartridges. The equipment would cost $55,000, plus $10,000 for
installation. Annual sales would be 4,000 units at a price of $50 per cartridge, and the
project’s life would be 3 years. Current assets would increase by $5,000 and payables by
$3,000. At the end of 3 years the equipment could be sold for $10,000. Depreciation would
be based on the MACRS 3-year class, so the applicable rates would be 33%, 45%, 15%, and
7%. Variable costs would be 70% of sales revenues, fixed costs excluding depreciation
would be $30,000 per year, the marginal tax rate is 40%, and the corporate WACC is 11%.
a. What is the required investment, that is, the Year 0 project cash flow?
b. What are the annual depreciation charges?
c. What are the project’s annual cash flows?
d. If the project is of average risk, what is its NPV? Should it be accepted?
e. Management is uncertain about the exact unit sales. What would the project’s NPV be if
unit sales turned out to be 20% below forecast but other inputs were as forecasted?
Would this change the decision? Explain.

Other variables are unchanged. What are the expected NPV, its standard deviation, and

sales and VC% to the values specified for each scenario, get the scenario cash flows, and
then find each scenario’s NPV. Then you must calculate the project’s expected NPV,
standard deviation
, and coefficient of variation (CV). This is not difficult, but it
would require a lot of calculations. You might want to look at the answer in Appendix
A at the back of the text, but make sure you understand how it was calculated.]

project when project risk has been properly considered? What are the revised values for
the NPV, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation? Would you recommend that

Define (a) sensitivity analysis, (b) scenario analysis, and (c) simulation analysis. If GE were
considering two projects (one for $500 million to develop a satellite communications system
and the other for $30,000 for a new truck), on which would the company be more likely to
use a simulation analysis?
12-10
If you were the CFO of a company that had to decide on hundreds of potential projects
every year, would you want to use sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis as described in
the chapter, or would the amount of arithmetic required take too much time and thus not
be cost-effective? What involvement would nonfinancial people such as those in marketing,
accounting, and production have in the analysis?

REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
The Chang Company is considering the purchase of a new
machine to replace an obsolete one. The machine being used for the operation has a book
value and a market value of zero. However, the machine is in good working order and will
last at least another 10 years. The proposed replacement machine will perform the opera-
tion so much more efficiently that Chang’s engineers estimate that it will produce after-tax
cash flows (labor savings and depreciation) of $9,000 per year. The new machine will cost
$40,000 delivered and installed, and its economic life is estimated to be 10 years. It has zero
salvage value. The firm’s WACC is 10%, and its marginal tax rate is 35%. Should Chang
buy the new machine?

OPTIMAL CAPITAL BUDGET
Marble Construction estimates that its WACC is 10% if equity
comes from retained earnings. However, if the company issues new stock to raise new
equity, it estimates that its WACC will rise to 10 8%. The company believes that it will
exhaust its retained earnings at $2,500,000 of capital due to the number of highly profitable
projects available to the firm and its limited earnings. The company is considering the

DEPRECIATION METHODS
Kristin is evaluating a capital budgeting project that should
last for 4 years. The project requires $800,000 of equipment. She is unsure what depreciation
method to use in her analysis, straight-line or the 3-year MACRS accelerated method.
Under straight-line depreciation, the cost of the equipment would be depreciated
evenly over its 4-year life (ignore the half-year convention for the straight-line method).
The applicable MACRS depreciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7% as discussed in
Appendix 12A. The company’s WACC is 10%, and its tax rate is 40%.

NEW PROJECT ANALYSIS
You must evaluate the purchase of a proposed spectrometer for
the R&D department. The base price is $140,000, and it would cost another $30,000 to
modify the equipment for special use by the firm. The equipment falls into the MACRS
3-year class and would be sold after 3 years for $60,000. The applicable depreciation rates
are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7% as discussed in Appendix 12A. The equipment would require
an $8,000 increase in net operating working capital (spare parts inventory). The project
would have no effect on revenues, but it should save the firm $50,000 per year in before-tax
labor costs. The firm’s marginal federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%.
a.
What is the initial investment outlay for the spectrometer, that is, what is the Year 0
project cash flow?
b.
What are the project’s annual cash flows in Years 1, 2, and 3?
c.
If the WACC is 12%, should the spectrometer be purchased? Explain.

NEW PROJECT ANALYSIS
You must evaluate a proposal to buy a new milling machine.
The base price is $108,000, and shipping and installation costs would add another $12,500.
The machine falls into the MACRS 3-year class, and it would be sold after 3 years for
$65,000. The applicable depreciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7% as discussed in
Appendix 12A. The machine would require a $5,500 increase in net operating working
capital (increased inventory less increased accounts payable). There would be no effect
on revenues, but pretax labor costs would decline by $44,000 per year. The marginal tax
rate is 35%, and the WACC is 12%. Also, the firm spent $5,000 last year investigating the
feasibility of using the machine.
a.
How should the $5,000 spent last year be handled?
b.
What is the initial investment outlay for the machine for capital budgeting purposes,
that is, what is the Year 0 project cash flow?

and it can be sold for $2,500 at this time. Thus, the annual depreciation expense is
$2,100 6
$350 per year. If the old machine is not replaced, it can be sold for $500 at the
end of its useful life.
Dauten is offered a replacement machine which has a cost of $8,000, an estimated useful
life of 6 years, and an estimated salvage value of $800. This machine falls into the MACRS
5-year class so the applicable depreciation rates are 20%, 32%, 19%, 12%, 11%, and 6%. The
replacement machine would permit an output expansion, so sales would rise by $1,000 per
year; even so, the new machine’s much greater efficiency would cause operating expenses
to decline by $1,500 per year. The new machine would require that inventories be increased
by $2,000, but accounts payable would simultaneously increase by $500. Dauten’s marginal
federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%, and its WACC is 15%. Should it replace the old machine?

REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
Mississippi River Shipyards is considering the replacement of
an 8-year-old riveting machine with a new one that will increase earnings before deprecia-
tion from $27,000 to $54,000 per year. The new machine will cost $82,500, and it will have
an estimated life of 8 years and no salvage value. The new machine will be depreciated over
its 5-year MACRS recovery period; so the applicable depreciation rates are 20%, 32%, 19%,
12%, 11%, and 6%. The applicable corporate tax rate is 40%, and the firm’s WACC is 12%.
The old machine has been fully depreciated and has no salvage value. Should the old
riveting machine be replaced by the new one? Explain your answer.

the decision? If Project B’s cash flows were negatively correlated with gross domestic
product (GDP), while A’s flows were positively correlated, would that influence your
risk assessment?

SCENARIO ANALYSIS
Your firm, Agrico Products, is considering a tractor that would have
a cost of $36,000, would increase pretax operating cash flows before taking account of
depreciation by $12,000 per year, and would be depreciated on a straight-line basis to zero
over 5 years at the rate of $7,200 per year beginning the first year. (Thus, annual cash flows
would be $12,000 before taxes plus the tax savings that result from $7,200 of depreciation.)
The managers disagree about whether the tractor would last 5 years. The controller insists
that she knows of tractors that have lasted only 4 years. The treasurer agrees with the
controller, but he argues that most tractors do give 5 years of service. The service manager
then states that some last for as long as 8 years.
Given this discussion, the CFO asks you to prepare a scenario analysis to determine the
importance of the tractor’s life on the NPV. Use a 40% marginal federal-plus-state tax rate, a
zero salvage value, and a 10% WACC. Assuming each of the indicated lives has the same
probability of occurring probability
1 3 , what is the tractor’s expected NPV? (Hint: Use
the 5-year straight-line depreciation for all analyses and ignore the MACRS half-year
convention for this problem.)

NEW PROJECT ANALYSIS
Holmes Manufacturing is considering a new machine that costs
$250,000 and would reduce pretax manufacturing costs by $90,000 annually. Holmes
would use the 3-year MACRS method to depreciate the machine, and management thinks
the machine would have a value of $23,000 at the end of its 5-year operating life. The
applicable depreciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7% as discussed in Appendix 12A.
Net operating working capital would increase by $25,000 initially, but it would be recov-
ered at the end of the project’s 5-year life. Holmes’s marginal tax rate is 40%, and a 10%
WACC is appropriate for the project.
a.
Calculate the project’s NPV, IRR, MIRR, and payback.

Assume management is unsure about the $90,000 cost savings—this figure could
deviate by as much as plus or minus 20%. What would the NPV be under each of
these situations?

REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
The Erley Equipment Company purchased a machine 5 years
ago at a cost of $90,000. The machine had an expected life of 10 years at the time of
purchase, and it is being depreciated by the straight-line method by $9,000 per year. If
the machine is not replaced, it can be sold for $10,000 at the end of its useful life.
A new machine can be purchased for $150,000, including installation costs. During its 5-
year life, it will reduce cash operating expenses by $50,000 per year. Sales are not expected
to change. At the end of its useful life, the machine is estimated to be worthless. MACRS
depreciation will be used, and the machine will be depreciated over its 3-year class life
rather than its 5-year economic life; so the applicable depreciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%,
and 7%.
The old machine can be sold today for $55,000. The firm’s tax rate is 35%. The appropriate
WACC is 16%.
a.
If the new machine is purchased, what is the amount of the initial cash flow at Year 0?
b.
What are the incremental cash flows that will occur at the end of Years 1 through 5?

REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
The Bigbee Bottling Company is contemplating the replace-
ment of one of its bottling machines with a newer and more efficient one. The old machine
has a book value of $600,000 and a remaining useful life of 5 years. The firm does not expect
to realize any return from scrapping the old machine in 5 years, but it can sell it now to
another firm in the industry for $265,000. The old machine is being depreciated by $120,000
per year, using the straight-line method.
The new machine has a purchase price of $1,175,000, an estimated useful life and
MACRS class life of 5 years, and an estimated salvage value of $145,000. The applicable
depreciation rates are 20%, 32%, 19%, 12%, 11%, and 6%. It is expected to economize on
electric power usage, labor, and repair costs, as well as to reduce the number of defective
bottles. In total, an annual savings of $255,000 will be realized if the new machine is
installed. The company’s marginal tax rate is 35% and it has a 12% WACC.
a.
What initial cash outlay is required for the new machine?
b.
Calculate the annual depreciation allowances for both machines and compute the
change in the annual depreciation expense if the replacement is made.

COMPREHENSIVE/SPREADSHEET PROBLEM

NEW PROJECT ANALYSIS
You must analyze a potential new product—a caulking com-
pound that Cory Materials’ R&D people developed for use in the residential construction
industry. Cory’s marketing manager thinks the company can sell 115,000 tubes per year at a
price of $3 25 each for 3 years, after which the product will be obsolete. The required
equipment would cost $150,000, plus another $25,000 for shipping and installation. Current
assets (receivables and inventories) would increase by $35,000, while current liabilities
(accounts payable and accruals) would rise by $15,000. Variable cost per unit is $1 95, fixed
costs (exclusive of depreciation) would be $70,000 per year, and fixed assets would be
depreciated under MACRS with a 3-year life. (Refer to Appendix 12A for MACRS depre-
ciation rates.) When production ceases after 3 years, the equipment should have a market
value of $15,000. Cory’s tax rate is 40%, and it uses a 10% WACC for average-risk projects.
a. Find the required Year 0 investment and the project’s annual cash flows. Then calculate
the project’s NPV, IRR, MIRR, and payback. Assume at this point that the project is of
average risk.
b. Suppose you now learn that R&D costs for the new product were $30,000 and that those
costs were incurred and expensed for tax purposes last year. How would this affect
your estimate of NPV and the other profitability measures?
c. If the new project would reduce cash flows from Cory’s other projects and if the new
project would be housed in an empty building that Cory owns and could sell, how would
those factors affect the project’s NPV?
d. Are this project’s cash flows likely to be positively or negatively correlated with returns
on Cory’s other projects and with the economy, and should this matter in your analysis?
Explain.
e. Spreadsheet assignment: at instructor’s option
Construct a spreadsheet that calcu-
lates the cash flows, NPV, IRR, payback, and MIRR.
f. The CEO expressed concern that some of the base-case inputs for the caulking com-
pound might be too optimistic or too pessimistic, and he wants to know how the NPV
would be affected if these six variables were 20% above or 20% below the base-case
levels: unit sales, sales price, variable cost, fixed costs, WACC, and equipment cost.
Hold other things constant when you consider each variable and construct a sensitivity
graph to illustrate your results.
g. Do a scenario analysis based on the assumption that there is a 25% probability that each
of the six variables itemized in Part f will turn out to have their best-case values as
calculated in Part f, a 50% probability that all will have their base-case values, and a
25% probability that all will have their worst-case values. The other variables remain at
base-case levels. Calculate the expected NPV, the standard deviation of NPV, and the
coefficient of variation.
h. Does Cory’s management use the risk-adjusted discount rate to adjust for project risk?
Explain.

CAPITAL BUDGETING AND CASH FLOW ESTIMATION
Allied Food Products is considering expanding
into the fruit juice business with a new fresh lemon juice product. Assume that you were recently hired
as assistant to the director of capital budgeting and you must evaluate the new project.
The lemon juice would be produced in an unused building adjacent to Allied’s Fort Myers plant;
Allied owns the building, which is fully depreciated. The required equipment would cost $200,000, plus
an additional $40,000 for shipping and installation. In addition, inventories would rise by $25,000, while

accounts payable would increase by $5,000. All of these costs would be incurred at t
0. By a special
ruling, the machinery could be depreciated under the MACRS system as 3-year property. The applicable
depreciation rates are 33%, 45%, 15%, and 7%.
The project is expected to operate for 4 years, at which time it will be terminated. The cash inflows are
assumed to begin 1 year after the project is undertaken, or at t
1, and to continue out to t
4. At the
end of the project’s life t
4 , the equipment is expected to have a salvage value of $25,000.
Unit sales are expected to total 100,000 units per year, and the expected sales price is $2 00 per unit.
Cash operating costs for the project (total operating costs less depreciation) are expected to total 60%
of dollar sales. Allied’s tax rate is 40%, and its WACC is 10%. Tentatively, the lemon juice project is
assumed to be of equal risk to Allied’s other assets.
You have been asked to evaluate the project and to make a recommendation as to whether it should
be accepted or rejected. To guide you in your analysis, your boss gave you the following set of tasks/
questions:
a. Allied has a standard form that is used in the capital budgeting process. (See Table IC 12.1.) Part of
the table has been completed, but you must replace the blanks with the missing numbers. Complete
the table using the following steps:
1. Fill in the blanks under Year 0 for the initial investment outlays: CAPEX and ΔNOWC.
2. Complete the table for unit sales, sales price, total revenues, and operating costs excluding
depreciation.
3. Complete the depreciation data.
4. Complete the table down to after-tax operating income and then down to the project’s operating
cash flows, EBIT 1 – T
DEP.
5. Fill in the blanks under Year 4 for the terminal cash flows and complete the project free cash flow
line. Discuss the recovery of net operating working capital. What would have happened if the
machinery were sold for less than its book value?
b. 1. Allied uses debt in its capital structure, so some of the money used to finance the project will be
debt. Given this fact, should the projected cash flows be revised to show projected interest
charges? Explain.
2. Suppose you learned that Allied had spent $50,000 to renovate the building last year, expensing
these costs. Should this cost be reflected in the analysis? Explain.
3. Suppose you learned that Allied could lease its building to another party and earn $25,000 per
year. Should that fact be reflected in the analysis? If so, how?
4. Assume that the lemon juice project would take profitable sales away from Allied’s fresh orange

2. How would you perform a sensitivity analysis on the unit sales, salvage value, and WACC for the
project? Assume that each of these variables deviates from its base-case, or expected, value by
plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30%. Explain how you would calculate the NPV, IRR, MIRR, and
payback for each case; but don’t do the analysis unless your instructor asks you to.
3. What is the primary weakness of sensitivity analysis? What are its primary advantages?
Calculate the answers to the remaining questions only if your instructor asks you to. Also note that it will

g. Assume that inflation is expected to average 5% over the next 4 years and that this expectation
is reflected in the WACC. Moreover, inflation is expected to increase revenues and variable costs
by this same 5%. Does it appear that inflation has been dealt with properly in the initial analysis
to this point? If not, what should be done and how would the required adjustment affect the
decision?
h. The expected cash flows, considering inflation (in thousands of dollars), are given in Table IC 12.2.
Allied’s WACC is 10%. Assume that you are confident about the estimates of all the variables
that affect the cash flows except unit sales. If product acceptance is poor, sales would be only
75,000 units a year, while a strong consumer response would produce sales of 125,000 units.
In either case, cash costs would still amount to 60% of revenues. You believe that there is a

Tax Depreciation
Depreciation is covered in detail in accounting courses, so here we provide only
some basic information that is needed for capital budgeting. First, note that
accountants generally calculate each asset’s depreciation in two ways—they gen-
erally use straight line to figure the depreciation used for reporting profits to
investors, but they use depreciation rates provided by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and called MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System)
rates when they calculate depreciation for tax purposes. In capital budgeting, we
are concerned with tax depreciation, so the relevant rates are the MACRS rates.
Under MACRS, each type of fixed asset is assigned to a “class” and is then
depreciated over the asset’s class life. Table 12A.1 provides class lives for different
types of assets as they existed in 2013. Next, as we show in Table 12A.2, MACRS
specifies annual depreciation rates for assets in each class life. Real properties
(buildings) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 27 5 or 39 years, but all
other assets are depreciated over shorter periods and on an accelerated basis, with
high depreciation charges in the early years and less depreciation in the later
years. The IRS tables are based on the half-year convention, where it is assumed
that the asset is placed in service halfway through the first year and is taken out of
service halfway through the year after its class life.
In the following example, we calculate depreciation on equipment that would
be classified as a 5-year asset with a cost of $8 million. In developing the tables, the
IRS assumes that the machinery would be used for only six months of the year in
which it is acquired, for 12 months in each of the next four years, and then for six
months of the sixth year. Here are the depreciation charges, in thousands, that
could be deducted for tax purposes based on MACRS:

The total of the annual depreciation charges equals the $8 million cost of the asset,
but it would be taken over six years and thus would affect cash flows over those
six years.

Notes:
1. We developed these recovery allowance percentages based on the 200% declining balance
method prescribed by MACRS, with a switch to straight-line depreciation at some point in
the asset’s life. For example, consider the 5-year recovery allowance percentages. The
straight-line percentage would be 20% per year, so the 200% declining balance multiplier
is 2 0 20%
40%
0 4. However, because the half-year convention applies, the MACRS
percentage for Year 1 is 20%. For Year 2, there is 80% of the depreciable basis remaining to
be depreciated, so the recovery allowance percentage is 0 40 80%
32%. In Year 3,
20%
32%
52% of the depreciation has been taken, leaving 48%, so the percentage is
0 4 48%
19%. In Year 4, the percentage is 0 4 29%
12%. After 4 years, straight-line
depreciation exceeds the declining balance depreciation, so a switch is made to straight-line
(this is permitted under the law). However, the half-year convention must also be applied at
the end of the class life, and the remaining 17% of depreciation must be taken (amortized)
over 1 5 years. Thus, the percentage in Year 5 is 17% 1 5
11%, and in Year 6,
17%
11%
6%. Although the tax tables carry the allowance percentages out to two
decimal places, we have rounded to the nearest whole number for ease of illustration.
2. Residential rental property (apartments) is depreciated over a 27 5-year life, whereas com-
mercial and industrial structures are depreciated over 39 years. In both cases, straight-line
depreciation must be used. The depreciation allowance for the first year is based, pro rata, on
the month the asset was placed in service, with the remainder of the first year’s depreciation
being taken in the 28th or 40th year.

Debt: Rocket Booster or Anchor? Caterpillar Inc.
If it is to grow, a firm needs capital, and capital
comes primarily in the form of debt or equity.
Debt financing has two important advantages:
(1) Interest paid is tax deductible, whereas divi-
dends are not deductible, and this lowers debt’s
relative cost to equity. (2) The return on debt is
fixed, so stockholders do not have to share the
firm’s profits if the company turns out to be
extremely successful.
However, debt also has disadvantages:
(1) Using more debt increases the firm’s risk,
and that raises the costs of both its debt
and equity. (2) If the company falls on hard
times and its operating income is not sufficient
to
cover
interest
charges,
then
the
firm
may go bankrupt. Good times may be just
around the corner, but too much debt can
bankrupt the company before it reaches that
corner.
Because of the additional risk from using
debt, companies with volatile earnings and
operating cash flows tend to limit its use. On
the other hand, companies with low business
risk and stable operating cash flows can benefit
from taking on more debt. Firms realize that
when bad times hit, interest must be paid so
they must become “leaner” to strengthen their
financial position and keep their credit rating
from declining. In 2009, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT),
the world’s largest producer of earthmoving
equipment, found itself in this precise situation.
At year-end 2008, Caterpillar’s book value
capital structure (debt over capital) consisted
of 89% debt and 11% equity. An 89% debt
ratio is quite high, and Caterpillar’s manage-
ment was well aware that excessive debt can
push an otherwise well-regarded company
into bankruptcy. Indeed, the country was in

the middle of a recession that spilled over into global
markets. Because Caterpillar’s foreign sales made up 67%
of its revenues, the company was hit hard. As a result, the
firm’s sales fell in 2009.
Accordingly, Caterpillar’s management began to get its
“financial house in order” by lowering its working capital,
reducing overhead costs, and paying down its investor-
supplied debt. In fact, from the first quarter of 2009
through the end of 2012, Caterpillar steadily reduced its
reliance on debt financing. As a result of these actions, its
debt-to-capital ratio had declined to 76%, despite a slug-
gish economy. For many companies, a 76% debt ratio
would still be too high.
However, if we examine Caterpillar’s capital structure in
more detail, it soon becomes apparent that there is more
here than meets the eye. At year-end, on a book-value basis,
Caterpillar had about $54.5 billion of investor-supplied debt
versus equity of $17.5 billion, but its market capitalization
(stock price times the number of shares outstanding) was
approximately $58.7 billion. From a market-value perspective,
Caterpillar’s debt-to-capital ratio was only $54.5/($54.5 +
$58.7) ≈48%, which was considerably lower than 76% calcu-
lated on a book-value basis. This helps explain why the
company continued to have an A bond rating.
Indeed, in early 2013 there were some indications that
the company was beginning to reverse its course. Cater-
pillar announced plans to reinstitute its stock buy-back
program. By reducing its outstanding equity, this plan
would once again push up the company’s debt ratio on
a book-value basis.
Caterpillar and other companies can finance with either
debt or equity. Is one better than the other? If so, should firms
finance either with all debt or all equity? Or, if the best
solution is some mix of debt and equity, what is the optimal
mix? As you read this chapter, think about these questions
and consider how you would answer them.
When we calculated the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in Chapter 10, we
assumed that the firm had a specific target capital structure. However, target capital
structures often change over time, such changes affect the risk and cost of each type of
capital, and all this can change the WACC. Moreover, a change in the WACC will affect
capital budgeting decisions and, ultimately, the stock price.
Many factors influence capital structure decisions; and, as we will see, determining
the optimal capital structure is not an exact science. Therefore, even firms in the same
industry often have dramatically different capital structures. In this chapter, we consider
the effects of debt on risk and on the optimal capital structure.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
• Explain why there may be differences in a firm’s capital structure when measured on a
book-value basis, a market-value basis, or a target basis.
• Distinguish between business risk and financial risk, and explain the effects that debt
financing has on the firm’s expected return and risk.
• Discuss the analytical framework used when determining the optimal capital
structure.
• Discuss capital structure theory, and use it to explain why firms in different industries
tend to have different capital structures.

13-1 BOOK, MARKET, OR “TARGET” WEIGHTS?
The term capital refers to investor-supplied funds—debt, preferred stock, com-
mon stock, and retained earnings.1 Accounts payable and accruals are not
included in our definition of capital because they are not provided by inves-
tors—they come from suppliers, workers, and taxing authorities as a result of
normal operations, not as investments by investors. A firm’s capital structure
is typically defined as the percentage of each type of investor-supplied capital,
with the total being 100%. The optimal capital structure is the mix of debt,
preferred stock, and common equity that maximizes the stock’s intrinsic value.
As we will see, the capital structure that maximizes the intrinsic value also
minimizes the WACC.
13-1A MEASURING THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE
To begin, we must answer this question: How should the capital structure be
measured? Should we work with book values as provided by accountants and
shown on the balance sheet; with the market values of the debt, preferred stock,
and common equity; or with some other set of numbers? To see what’s involved,
consider Table 13.1, which compares the book and market values for Caterpillar
(CAT) from a recent financial statement.2

Note: At the time of this analysis, CAT had 655 million shares outstanding, its book value per share was $26.76, and its market price was $89.61 per
share. We do not know its management-determined target capital structure. The 50% debt ratio is just our estimate of what a reasonable target might be.
The procedure illustrated in Section 13-3 shows how CAT might go about establishing its target capital structure.
1Capital is frequently defined to include only long-term debt, that is, debt due in more than a year.
However, many companies use short-term loans from banks on a permanent basis, and for this reason
we include short-term debt that is provided by investors in our definition of “capital.”
2CAT’s actual balance sheet is broken down into so many elements that it is several pages long. For
convenience, we compress it into the categories shown in Table 13.1. The data used in the table are
from its December 31, 2012, balance sheet.

1.
In this case, as is generally true, the market value of the debt was fairly close to
its book value; so, for simplicity, we show the same dollars of debt in both the
book and market columns.
2.
However at the time of this analysis, the common stock sold for $89 61 per
share versus its $26 76 book value. There were 655 million shares outstanding,
so the market value of the equity was $58 7 billion, calculated as
$89 61 655,000,000
$58 7 billion, versus a $17 5 billion book value.
3.
For capital structure purposes, no distinction is made between common equity
raised by issuing stock versus retaining earnings. Stockholders provided both
components, either by purchasing newly issued shares or by allowing
management to retain earnings rather than to distribute them as dividends.
4.
Caterpillar does not use preferred stock, but if it did, the market value of
preferred would be calculated in the same way as we calculated the market
value of its common equity.
5.
According to most financial theorists, it is better to use market values than book
values. However, most financial analysts report data on a book-value basis, and
bond rating agencies report book values and seem to give them at least as much
weight as market values. Also, stock prices are quite volatile; so, if we use
market values, then the weights used to calculate the WACC will also be
volatile. For all these reasons, some analysts argue for the use of book values.
6.
In a perfect world, a firm would identify its optimal capital structure based on
market values, raise capital so as to maintain that structure, and use the
optimal percentages to calculate its WACC. However, the world is not perfect.
It is impossible to identify a precisely optimal structure, and given the
volatility inherent in financial markets, it would be impossible to remain on
target over time even if the optimal structure could be identified. As a result,
most firms focus on a target debt ratio range as opposed to a single number.3
7.
Generally, a firm’s CFO considers the capital structures of the firms against
which it benchmarks and performs an analysis similar to what we do in the

Assume that Caterpillar’s management concluded that the firm’s optimal capital
structure has 50% debt and set its target debt range at 45% to 55%. The equity
range is thus (1 −% Debt), or between 45% and 55% equity. Now, for simplicity,
assume that the average interest rate on both short-term and long-term debt is
5%, the cost of equity is 11%, and its corporate tax rate is approximately 30%.
Using weights from Table 13.1, the following calculations show that the choice of
capital structure makes a significant difference in the WACC estimates:

3A study by Graham and Harvey surveyed corporate managers and asked whether their firms established
a target capital structure. Eighty-one percent of the respondents indicated that their firms did have target
capital structures. Ten percent said that they had strict target debt ratios, 34% indicated that they had a
somewhat tight range for their target debt ratios, and 37% indicated that they had flexible targets. See John
R. Graham and Campbell R. Harvey, “The Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance: Evidence from the
Field,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 60, nos. 2 & 3 (May–June 2001), pp. 187–243.

Using the 50% midpoint target debt ratio, our estimate of CAT’s WACC for an
average-risk project would be 7 25%, or approximately 7 3%.
If the actual debt ratio were significantly below the target range, the firm
would probably raise capital by issuing debt, whereas if the debt ratio were
above the target range, equity would probably be used. Note also that the target
range is likely to change over time as conditions change. As discussed in the
opening vignette, Caterpillar has initiated a stock buy-back program so it appears
that the company’s target debt ratio is somewhere in the higher part of the
45%–55% range.
13-1B CAPITAL STRUCTURE CHANGES OVER TIME
Firms’ actual capital structures change over time, and for two quite different
reasons:
•
Deliberate actions: If a firm is not currently at its target, it may deliberately raise
new money in a manner that moves the actual structure toward the target.
•
Market actions: The firm could incur high profits or losses that lead to
significant changes in book value equity as shown on its balance sheet and to
a decline in its stock price. Similarly, while the book value of its debt would
probably not change, interest rate changes due to changes in the general level
of rates and/or changes in the firm’s default risk could cause significant
changes in its debt’s market value. Such changes in the market value of the
debt and/or equity could result in large changes in its measured capital
structure.
Still, at any given moment, most firms have a specific target range in mind.4 If the
actual debt ratio has surpassed the target, a firm can sell a large stock issue and
use the proceeds to retire debt. Or, if the stock price has increased and pushed the
debt ratio below the target, it can issue bonds and use the proceeds to repurchase
stock. And, of course, a firm can gradually move toward its target through its
annual financings to support its capital budget.5
S E L F T E S T
Define the terms “book-value capital structure,” “market-value capital structure,”
and “target capital structure,” and explain why they differ from one another.
Would the market-value debt ratio tend to be higher than the book-value debt
ratio during a stock market boom or a recession? Explain.
Why would the WACC based on market values tend to be higher than the one
based on book values if the stock price exceeded its book value?
Which would you expect to be more stable over time, a firm’s book-value or
market-value capital structure? Explain.
4Even if the firm concluded that its debt ratio was below the lower limit—then it could finance its
entire capital budget for the year with debt—it should still use a WACC based on the target capital
structure when evaluating projects for inclusion in the firm’s capital budget.
5Firms face costs when they adjust their capital structure, and this is particularly the case if the firm has
to pay an investment banker to help it raise new debt or equity. Consequently, if the benefits of moving
toward their target capital structure (a lower WACC) are less than the costs of adjusting their capital
structure, firms may decide not to immediately adjust their capital structure to its target level. If you
are interested in more details about capital structure adjustments, see the following article which looks
at the connection between transactions costs and the speed at which firms adjust to their target capital
structure: Michael W. Faulkender, Mark J. Flannery, Kristine Watson Hankins, and Jason M. Smith,

13-2 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RISK
In Chapter 8, we examined risk from the viewpoint of an individual investor and
we distinguished between risk on a stand-alone basis, where an asset’s cash flows
are analyzed by themselves, and risk in a portfolio context, where cash flows from a
number of assets are combined and consolidated cash flows are analyzed. In a
portfolio context, we saw that an asset’s risk can be divided into two components:
diversifiable risk, which can be diversified away and hence is of little concern to
most investors, and market risk, which is measured by the beta coefficient and
reflects broad market movements that cannot be eliminated by diversification and
therefore is of concern to investors. Then in Chapter 12, we examined risk from the
viewpoint of the corporation and we considered how capital budgeting decisions
affect the firm’s riskiness.
Now we introduce two new dimensions of risk:
1.
Business risk, which is the riskiness of the firm’s assets if no debt is used.
2.
Financial risk, which is the additional risk placed on the common stockholders
as a result of using debt.
13-2A BUSINESS RISK
Business risk is the single most important determinant of capital structure, and it
represents the amount of risk that is inherent in the firm’s operations even if it
uses no debt financing. A commonly used measure of business risk is the standard
deviation of the firm’s return on invested capital, or ROIC. Recall from Chapter 4
that ROIC is defined as follows:6
ROIC
EBIT 1
T
Total invested capital
ROIC measures the after-tax return that the company provides for all of its
investors. Because ROIC does not vary with changes in capital structure, the
standard deviation of ROIC
ROIC
measures the underlying risk of the firm
before considering the effects of debt financing, thereby providing a good measure
of business risk.7
We use Bigbee Electronics, a debt-free (unlevered) firm, to illustrate business
risk. The top graph in Figure 13.1 shows the trend in Bigbee’s return on invested
capital, or ROIC, from 2005 through 2013. Graphs like this show security analysts
and managers how much ROIC has varied in the past and thus might vary in the
future. The lower graph shows the probability distribution of Bigbee’s ROIC,
based on the 2005–2013 data given in the top section.
Bigbee’s ROIC fluctuations were caused by many factors—booms and reces-
sions in the economy, successful new products introduced by Bigbee and its
competitors, labor strikes, a fire in Bigbee’s main plant, and so on. Similar events
will doubtless occur in the future, and when they do, the realized ROIC will be
higher or lower than the expected 9 0%. Further, there is always the possibility
that a long-term disaster will strike, permanently depressing the company’s earn-
ing power. For example, a competitor might introduce a new product that makes
Bigbee’s products totally obsolete and puts the company out of business—much
like what happened to buggy manufacturers when automobiles were invented.
6Also note that EBIT(1 −T) is the after-tax income the firm would have if it used no debt. Similarly,
ROIC is the ROE the firm would have if it were debt-free.
7At the outset, we assume that changes in capital structure have no effect on the firm’s operating
performance. Later in the chapter, we discuss some circumstances when the level of debt financing
may affect the company’s operating performance (EBIT); in these circumstances, ROIC would vary
with different debt levels.
Business Risk
The riskiness inherent in
the firm’s operations if it
uses no debt.

The more uncertainty there is about future EBIT and thus ROIC, the greater
the company’s business risk. Bigbee uses no debt, so its stockholders currently face
only business risk. However, if it issues debt, its stockholders would face the
existing business risk plus some additional financial risk. Business risk varies from
industry to industry and also among firms in a given industry. Further, a firm’s
business risk can change over time. For example, the electric utilities were for
many years regarded as having little business risk, but over the past few decades,
utilities have faced increased competition and greater uncertainty regarding
potential environmental regulations, both of which have somewhat increased
the industry’s risk. Today, food processors like Kraft and Pillsbury illustrate
companies with low business risk, while cyclical manufacturers such as steel
companies, as well as new start-up companies, have high business risk.8

Note: Because Bigbee has no debt, its ROIC is equal to its ROE, hence we could replace the term ROIC with ROE. Note, though, that as soon as debt is
issued, ROE and ROIC will differ.
8We have avoided any discussion of market versus company-specific risk in this section. We note now
(1) that any action that increases business risk in the sense of stand-alone risk will generally increase a
firm’s beta coefficient and (2) that a part of business risk as we define it will generally be company-
specific and hence subject to elimination as a result of diversification by the firm’s stockholders.

13-2B FACTORS THAT AFFECT BUSINESS RISK
Business risk depends on a number of factors, including the following:
1.
Competition. If a firm has a monopoly on a necessary product, it will have little
risk from competition and thus have stable sales and sales prices. However,
monopolistic firms’ prices are often regulated, and they may not be able to
raise prices enough to cover rising costs. Still, other things held constant,
less competition lowers business risk.
2.
Demand variability. The more stable the demand for a firm’s products, other
things held constant, the lower its business risk.
3.
Sales price variability. Firms whose products are sold in volatile markets are
exposed to more business risk than firms whose output prices are stable, other
things held constant.
4.
Input cost variability. Firms whose input costs are uncertain have higher
business risk.
5.
Product obsolescence. Firms in high-tech industries like pharmaceuticals and
computers depend on a constant stream of new products. The faster its
products become obsolete, the greater a firm’s business risk.
6.
Foreign risk exposure. Firms that generate a high percentage of their earnings
overseas are subject to earnings declines due to exchange rate fluctuations.
They are also exposed to political risk.
7.
Regulatory risk and legal exposure. Firms that operate in highly regulated
industries such as financial services and utilities are subject to changes in the
regulatory environment which may have a profound effect on the company’s
current and future profitability. Other companies face significant legal
exposure that could damage the company if they are forced to pay large
settlements. For example, in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico, BP still faces huge cleanup costs and future legal costs
for lost wages, damages to area tourism, and possible legal violations.
Tobacco companies and pharmaceutical companies have also incurred huge
legal costs after being sued for damages created by their products.
8.
The extent to which costs are fixed: operating leverage. If a high percentage of its
costs are fixed and thus do not decline when demand falls, this increases the
firm’s business risk. This factor is called operating leverage, and it is discussed
in the next section.
Each of these factors is determined partly by industry characteristics and partly by
managerial decisions. For example, Bigbee could reduce input cost volatility by
negotiating long-term labor and supply contracts, but it might have to pay more
than the current spot price to obtain such contracts.9
13-2C OPERATING LEVERAGE
As noted earlier, business risk depends in part on the extent to which a firm builds
fixed costs into its operations—if fixed costs are high, even a small decline in sales
can lead to a large decline in ROIC. So other things held constant, the higher a
firm’s fixed costs, the greater its business risk. Higher fixed costs are generally
associated with more highly automated, capital-intensive firms and industries.
However, businesses that employ highly skilled workers who must be retained
and paid even during recessions also have relatively high fixed costs, as do firms
9Hedging, which involves actions that lock in future costs or prices, can also be used to reduce business
risk. For example, a jewelry company like Tiffany might buy gold futures to freeze the price it must
pay for gold, while a gold mining firm like Newmont Mining might sell gold futures to lock in the price
it will earn on the gold it produces.

with high product development costs, because the amortization of development
costs is a fixed cost.
When a high percentage of total costs are fixed, the firm is said to have a high
degree of operating leverage. In physics, leverage implies the use of a lever to
raise a heavy object with a small force. In politics, if people have leverage, their
smallest word or action can accomplish a great deal. In business terminology, a high
degree of operating leverage, other factors held constant, implies that a relatively small
change in sales results in a large change in ROIC.
Figure 13.2 illustrates the concept of operating leverage by comparing the
results that Bigbee could expect if it used different degrees of operating
leverage. Plan A calls for a relatively small amount of fixed costs, $25,000.
Here the firm would not have much automated equipment; so its depreciation,
maintenance, property taxes, and so forth, would be low. However, the total
operating costs line has a relatively steep slope, indicating that variable costs
per unit are higher than they would be if the firm used more operating
leverage. Plan B calls for a higher level of fixed costs, $70,000. Here the firm
uses automated equipment (with which one operator can turn out a few or
many units at the same labor cost) to a much larger extent. The break-even
point is higher under Plan B—breakeven occurs at 70,000 units under Plan B
versus only 50,000 units under Plan A.
We can calculate the break-even quantity by recognizing that operating
breakeven occurs when earnings before interest and taxes EBIT

Here P is average sales price per unit of output, Q is units of output, V is variable
cost per unit, and F is fixed operating costs. If we solve for the break-even
quantity, QBE we get this expression:
QBE

Thus, for Plan A,

How does operating leverage affect business risk? Other things held constant, the
higher a firm’s operating leverage, the higher its business risk. This point is demon-
strated in Figure 13.3, where we develop probability distributions for ROIC under
Plans A and B.
The top section of Figure 13.3 graphs the probability distribution of sales that
was presented in tabular form in Figure 13.2. The sales probability distribution
depends on how demand for the product varies, not on whether the product is
manufactured by Plan A or by Plan B. Therefore, the same sales probability
distribution applies to both production plans. This distribution has expected
sales of $200,000; it ranges from zero to about $400,000, with a standard deviation
of
Sales
$98 793.
10This definition of breakeven does not include any fixed financial costs. If there were fixed financial
costs, the firm would suffer an accounting loss at the operating break-even point. We introduce
financial costs shortly.

We use the sales probability distribution, together with the operating costs at
each sales level, to develop graphs of the ROIC probability distributions under
Plans A and B. These are shown in the lower section of Figure 13.3. Plan B has a
higher expected ROIC, but this plan also entails a much higher probability of
losses. Plan B, the one with more fixed costs and a higher degree of operating
leverage, is clearly riskier. In general, holding other factors constant, the higher the
degree of operating leverage, the greater the firm’s business risk. In the discussion that
follows, we assume that Bigbee has decided to go ahead with Plan B because its

management believes that the higher expected return is sufficient to compensate
for the higher risk.
To what extent can firms control their operating leverage? To a large extent,
operating leverage is determined by technology. Electric utilities, telephone compa-
nies, airlines, steel mills, and chemical companies must have large investments in
fixed assets; and this results in high fixed costs and operating leverage. Similarly,
pharmaceutical, auto, computer, and other companies must spend heavily to develop
new products; and product-development costs increase operating leverage. Grocery
stores and service businesses such as accounting and consulting firms, on the other
hand, generally have significantly lower fixed costs and, therefore, lower operating
leverage. Still, although industry factors do exert a major influence, all firms have
some control over their operating leverage. For example, an electric utility can
expand its generating capacity by building either gas-fired or nuclear plants. Nuclear
plants would require larger investments and would have higher fixed costs, but their
variable operating costs would be relatively low. Gas-fired plants, on the other hand,
would require smaller investments and would have lower fixed costs; but the vari-
able costs (for gas) would be high. So, by its capital budgeting decisions, a utility (or
any other company) can influence its operating leverage and hence its business risk.

The concept of operating leverage was originally developed for use in capital
budgeting. Mutually exclusive projects that involve alternative production meth-
ods for a given product often have different degrees of operating leverage and
thus different break-even points and different degrees of risk. Bigbee Electronics
and many other companies regularly undertake a type of break-even analysis (the
sensitivity analysis discussed in Chapter 12) for each proposed project as a part of
their regular capital budgeting process. Still, once a corporation’s operating lever-
age has been established, this factor exerts a major influence on its capital struc-
ture decision.
13-2D FINANCIAL RISK
Financial risk is the additional risk placed on the common stockholders as a result
of the decision to finance with debt. Conceptually, stockholders face a certain
amount of risk that is inherent in the firm’s operations—this is its business risk,
defined as the uncertainty inherent in projections of future operating income. If a
firm uses debt (financial leverage), this concentrates the business risk on common
stockholders. To illustrate, suppose 10 people decide to form a corporation to own
and operate a large apartment complex. There is a certain amount of business risk
in the operation. If the firm is capitalized only with common equity and if each
person buys 10% of the stock, each investor will share equally in the business risk.
However, suppose the firm is capitalized with 50% debt and 50% equity, with 5 of
the investors putting up their capital as debt and the other 5 putting up their money
as equity. The debtholders will receive a fixed payment, and it will come before the
stockholders receive anything. Also, if the firm goes bankrupt, the debtholders
must be paid off before the stockholders receive anything. In this case, the 5
investors who put up the equity will have to bear all of the business risk; so the
common stock will be twice as risky as it would have been had the firm been
financed only with equity. Thus, the use of debt, or financial leverage, concentrates the
firm’s business risk on the stockholders. (In Web Appendix 13A, we describe in more
detail the interaction between operating leverage and financial leverage.)
To illustrate the business risk concentration, we can extend the Bigbee
Electronics example. To date, the company has never used debt, but the
treasurer is now considering a possible change in its capital structure. As we
mentioned earlier, changes in debt will not affect ROIC, but it will affect the
proportion of risk borne by the firm’s stockholders. More specifically, changes
in the use of debt would cause changes in earnings per share (EPS) as well as
changes in risk—both would affect the stock price. To understand the relation-
ship between financial leverage and EPS, first consider Table 13.2, which
shows how Bigbee’s cost of debt would vary if it used different amounts of

debt to finance a fixed amount of capital. The higher the percentage of debt in
the capital structure, the riskier the debt and, for that reason, the higher the
interest rate lenders would charge.
For now, assume that only two financing choices are being considered—
remain at 100% equity or shift to 50% debt and 50% equity. We also assume that
with no debt, Bigbee has 10,000 shares of common stock outstanding and if it
decides to change its capital structure, common stock would be repurchased at the
$20 current stock price. Now consider Table 13.3, which shows how the financing
choice would affect Bigbee’s profitability and risk.
First, focus on Section I, which assumes that Bigbee uses no debt. Because debt
is zero, interest is also zero; hence net income is equal to EBIT 1
T . ROIC is
calculated as EBIT 1
T divided by invested capital. Bigbee’s invested capital,
which is $200,000, equals equity because it has no debt. Net income is then
divided by the $200,000 of equity to calculate ROE. Note that Bigbee will receive
a tax credit if net income is negative (when demand is terrible or poor). Here we
assume that Bigbee’s losses can be carried back to offset income earned in the prior
year, thus resulting in a tax credit. The ROE at each sales level is then multiplied
by the probability of that sales level to calculate the 9% expected ROE. Note that
this 9% is the same as that found in Figure 13.2 for Plan B. Finally, because there is
no debt, the percentages calculated in the ROIC column are identical to those in
the ROE column.
Section I of the table also calculates Bigbee’s earnings per share (EPS) for
each scenario under the assumption that the company continues to use no
debt. Net income is divided by the 10,000 common shares outstanding to
obtain EPS. If demand is terrible, the EPS will be −$4 20; but if demand is
wonderful, the EPS will rise to $7 80. The EPS at each sales level is then
multiplied by the probability of that level to calculate the expected EPS, which
is $1 80 if Bigbee uses no debt. We also calculate the standard deviation of EPS
and the coefficient of variation as indicators of the firm’s risk at a zero debt
ratio:
EPS
$2 96 and CVEPS
1 65.
Now look at Section II, the situation if Bigbee decides to use 50% debt
with an interest rate of 7 2%. Neither sales nor operating costs will be
affected—the EBIT, the EBIT 1
T , and the ROIC columns are the same,
whether Bigbee has zero debt or 50% debt. However, the company now has
$100,000 of debt with a cost of 7 2%; thus, its interest expense is $7,200. This
interest must be paid regardless of the state of the economy—if it is not paid,
the company will be forced into bankruptcy and stockholders will be wiped
out. Therefore, we show a $7,200 cost in Column 6 as a fixed number for all
sales levels. Column 7 shows the resulting net income. When net income is
divided by the equity investment—which now is only $100,000 because
$100,000 of the $200,000 invested capital was financed with debt—we find
the ROE under each demand state. If demand is terrible and sales are zero, a
very large loss will be incurred and the ROE will be −46 32%. However, if
demand is wonderful, ROE will be 73 68%. The expected ROE is the
probability-weighted average, which is 13 68% if the company uses 50% debt.
Note that when debt is added to the firm’s capital structure, ROE and ROIC
are no longer equal.
Typically, using debt increases the expected rate of return for an investment.
However, debt also increases risk to the common stockholders. This situation
holds with our example—financial leverage raises the expected ROE from 9% to
13 68%, but it also increases the risk of the investment as measured by the
coefficient of variation of ROE, which rises from 1 65 to 2 17. Figure 13.4 graphs
the data in Table 13.3. It demonstrates that using financial leverage increases
the expected ROE but that it also flattens out the probability distribution,
increases the probability of a large loss, and thus increases the risk borne by
stockholders.

Assumptions:
1. In terms of its operating leverage, Bigbee has chosen Plan B. The probability distribution and EBIT are obtained from Figure 13.2.
2. Sales and operating costs (and thus EBIT) are not affected by the financing decision. Therefore, EBIT, EBIT(1−T), and ROIC under both
financing plans are identical and are taken from Figure 13.2.
3. All losses can be carried back to offset income in the prior year.
aThe EPS figures can also be obtained using the following formula in which the numerator amounts to an income statement at a given sales
level displayed horizontally:

Variable costs

For example, with zero debt and sales = $200,000, EPS is $1.80:

With 50% debt and sales = $200,000, EPS is $2.74:

Refer to the tabular data given in Figure 13.2 to arrive at sales, fixed costs, and variable costs that are used in the preceding equations.
Note: Because the demand for the product has a normal distribution, the probability distribution is symmetrical. Consequently, the expected
values equal the values under normal demand. This would not occur under an asymmetrical probability distribution.

We can also calculate Bigbee’s EPS if it uses 50% debt. With Debt
$0, 10,000
shares would be outstanding; but if half the equity was replaced by debt
Debt
$
,
, only 5,000 shares would be outstanding. We can determine
the EPS that would result at each of the possible demand levels under the different
capital structures.11 With no debt, EPS would be −$4 20 if demand was terrible,
$1 80 if demand was normal, and $7 80 if demand was wonderful. With 50% debt,
EPS would be −$9 26 if demand was terrible, $2 74 if demand was normal, and
$14 74 if demand was wonderful. Expected EPS would be $1 80 with no debt but
$2 74 with 50% financial leverage. Although expected EPS would be much higher
if financial leverage was employed, the risk of low, or even negative, EPS would
also be higher if debt was used.
Another view of the relationships among expected EPS, risk, and financial
leverage is presented in Figure 13.5. The tabular data in the lower section
were calculated in the manner set forth in Table 13.3, and the graphs plot
these data. Here we see that expected EPS rises until the firm is financed with
50% debt. Interest charges rise, but this effect is more than offset by the
declining number of shares outstanding as debt is substituted for equity.
However, EPS peaks at a debt ratio of 50%, beyond which interest rates rise
so rapidly that EPS falls in spite of the falling number of shares outstanding.12
The right graph in Figure 13.5 shows that risk, as measured by the coefficient
of variation of EPS, rises continuously and at an increasing rate as debt is
substituted for equity.
These examples make it clear that using leverage has both positive and
negative effects: Higher leverage increases expected EPS (in this example,
until the Debt/Capital ratio equals 50%), but it also increases risk. When
determining its optimal capital structure, Bigbee needs to balance these posi-
tive and negative effects of leverage. This issue is discussed in the following
sections.

11We assume in this example that the firm could change its capital structure by repurchasing common
stock at its book value of $100,000/5,000 shares = $20 per share. However, the firm may have to pay a
higher price to repurchase its stock on the open market. If Bigbee had to pay $22 per share, it
could repurchase only $100,000/$22 = 4,545 shares; and in this case, expected EPS would be only
$13,680/(10,000 −4,545) = $13,680/5,455 = $2.51 rather than $2.74.
12In this context and in the remainder of this chapter, the debt ratio we are referring to is the

13-3 DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
As we saw in Figure 13.5, Bigbee’s expected EPS is maximized at a Debt/Capital
ratio of 50%. Does that mean that Bigbee’s optimal capital structure calls for
50% debt? The answer is a resounding “No!” The optimal capital structure is the
one that maximizes the price of the firm’s stock, and this generally calls for a Debt/Capital
ratio that is lower than the one that maximizes expected EPS.
We know that stock prices are positively related to expected earnings but
negatively related to higher risk. Therefore, to the extent that higher debt levels
raise expected EPS, financial leverage works to increase the stock price. However,
higher debt levels also increase the firm’s risk, which raises the cost of equity and
works to reduce the stock price. So even though increasing the Debt/Capital ratio
from 40% to 50% raises EPS, in our example, the higher EPS is more than offset by
the corresponding increase in risk.
13-3A WACC AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE CHANGES
Managers should set as the target capital structure the debt–equity mix that
maximizes the firm’s stock price. However, it is difficult to estimate how a given
change in the capital structure will affect the stock price. As it turns out, the capital
structure that maximizes the stock price also minimizes the WACC; and at times,
it is easier to predict how a capital structure change will affect the WACC than the
stock price. Therefore, many managers use the estimated relationship between
capital structure and the WACC to guide their capital structure decisions.
Recall from Chapter 10 that when a firm uses no preferred stock, the WACC is
found as follows:
WACC
wd rd
1
T
wc rs
In this expression, wd and wc represent the percentage of debt and equity in the firm’s
capital structure, respectively, and they must sum to 1 0. Note that in Table 13.4 an
increase in the Debt/Capital ratio increases the costs of both debt and equity. [The
cost of debt, rd, is taken from Table 13.2 but multiplied by 1
T to put it on an after-
tax basis.] Bondholders recognize that if a firm has a higher Debt/Capital ratio, this
increases the risk of financial distress, which leads to higher interest rates.
In practice, financial managers use financial statement forecasting models to
determine how changes in the debt-to-capital ratio will affect the current ratio,
times-interest-earned ratio, and EBITDA coverage ratio.13 They then discuss their
projected ratios with bankers and bond rating agencies, which ask probing ques-
tions and may make their own adjustments to the firm’s forecasts. The bankers
and rating agencies compare the firm’s ratios with those of other firms in its
industry and arrive at a “what if” rating and corresponding interest rate. More-
over, if the company plans to issue bonds to the public, the SEC requires that it
inform investors what the coverages will be after the new bonds have been sold.
Recognizing all this, sophisticated financial managers use their forecasted ratios to
predict how bankers and other lenders will judge their firms’ risks and thus their
costs of debt. Experienced financial managers and investment bankers can judge
quite accurately the effects of capital structure on the cost of debt.
13-3B THE HAMADA EQUATION
Increasing the debt ratio increases the risk that bondholders face and thus the cost
of debt. More debt also raises the risk borne by stockholders, which raises the cost
of equity, rs. It is harder to quantify leverage’s effects on the cost of equity, but a
theoretical formula can help measure the effect.
13We discuss financial statement forecasts in Chapter 16.

To begin, recall from Chapter 8 that a stock’s beta is the relevant measure of
risk for a diversified investor. Moreover, beta increases with financial leverage.
Robert Hamada formulated the following equation to quantify this effect.14
bL
bU 1
1 – T D E
13.2
Here bL is the firm’s current beta, which we now assume is based on the existence
of some financial leverage, and bU is the firm’s beta if the firm were debt-free, or
unlevered.15 If the firm were debt-free, its beta would depend entirely on its
business risk and thus would be a measure of the firm’s “basic business risk.”

bBigbee pays all of its earnings out as dividends, so EPS = DPS.
cThe firm’s unlevered beta, bU, is 1.0. The remaining betas were calculated using the Hamada equation, given the unlevered beta, tax
rate, and D/E ratio as inputs.
dWe assume that rRF = 3% and RPM = 6%. Therefore, at Debt/Capital = 0, rs = 3% + (6%)1.0 = 9%. Other values of rs are calculated
similarly.
eBecause all earnings are paid out as dividends, no retained earnings will be reinvested in the business and growth in EPS and DPS will
be zero. Hence, the zero growth stock price model developed in Chapter 9 can be used to estimate the price of Bigbee’s stock. For

15Note that Equation 13.2 is the original equation that Hamada put forward, and it was based on a set
of assumptions. The most notable were (a) that the beta of the company’s debt is zero, (b) that the level
of debt is constant, and (c) that the values of the company’s interest tax shields are discounted at the
before-tax cost of debt. Other researchers have derived alternative equations that are based on different
assumptions. For example, one commonly used alternative assumes that the company’s debt ratio
remains constant and that the interest tax shields are discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. In this
case, the resulting equation is as follows:

D/E is the measure of financial leverage as used in the Hamada equation, and T is
the corporate tax rate.16
Now recall the CAPM version of the cost of equity:
rs
rRF
RPM bi
Note that beta is the only variable in the equity cost equation that is under
management’s control. The other two variables, rRF and RPM are determined by
market forces that are beyond the firm’s control; but bL is determined by the firm’s
operating decisions, which as we saw earlier, affect its basic business risk, and by
its capital structure decisions as reflected in its debt (or D/E) ratio.
We can solve Equation 13.2 to find the unlevered beta, bU, obtaining
Equation 13.2a:
bU
bL
1
1 – T D E
13.2a
Because the current (levered) beta is known, as are the tax rate and the
debt/equity ratio, we can insert values for these known variables and find the
unlevered beta. The unlevered beta can then be used in Equation 13.2 with different
debt levels to find the levered betas that would exist at those different debt levels. The
resulting betas can be used to find the cost of equity at different debt levels.
We can illustrate this with Bigbee Electronics. First, assume that the risk-free
rate of return, rRF, is 3% and that the market risk premium, RPM, is 6%. Next, we
need the unlevered beta, bU. Because Bigbee has no debt, its D E
0. Therefore,
its current 1 0 beta is also its unlevered beta; hence, bU
1 0. With bU, rRF, and
RPM specified, we can use Equation 13.2 to estimate Bigbee’s betas at different
degrees of financial leverage and its resulting cost of equity at each debt ratio.
Bigbee’s betas at different debt/equity ratios are shown in Column 5 of
Table 13.4. The current cost of equity is 9% as shown on the first line of Column 6:
rs
rRF
Risk premium
3%
6% 1 0
3%
6%
9%
From this equation, we see that 3% is the risk-free rate and 6% is the firm’s risk
premium. Because Bigbee currently uses no debt, it has no financial risk. There-
fore, the 6% risk premium is attributable entirely to business risk.
If Bigbee changes its capital structure by adding debt, this would increase the
risk stockholders would have to bear. That, in turn, would result in a higher risk
premium. Conceptually, a firm’s cost of equity consists of the following components:
rs
rRF
Premium for business risk
Premium for financial risk
Figure 13.6, which is based on data shown in Column 6 of Table 13.4, graphs Bigbee’s
costs of equity at different debt ratios. As the figure shows, rs consists of the 3% risk-
free rate, a constant 6% premium for business risk, and a premium for financial risk
that starts at zero but rises at an increasing rate as the firm’s debt ratio increases.
Unlevered Beta, bU
The firm’s beta coefficient

16Note that wd is equal to the percentage of debt in the firm’s capital structure, and it is equal to
Debt/Capital = D/(D + E). So it follows that

For example, if the firm has $40 of debt and $60 of equity, wd = D/(D + E) = $40/($40 + $60) = 0.4.
Therefore,

Note also that Hamada’s equation assumes that debt and equity are reported at market values rather
than accounting book values. This point is discussed at length in Chapter 15 of Eugene F. Brigham and

Learning, 2013), where feedbacks among capital structure, stock prices, and capital costs are examined.

Q U E S T I O N :
Barnes Co. currently has a capital structure that consists of 40% debt and 60% common equity.
The company has a 40% tax rate. Currently the levered beta (bL) on the company’s stock is 1 4.
a. What is the company’s unlevered beta (bU)?
b. What would be the company’s levered beta (bL) if Barnes changed its capital structure
to 20% debt and 80% common equity?
A N S W E R :
a. The company’s unlevered beta is calculated as follows:
bU
bL

T D E
bU
1 4 1
0 6 0 4 0 6
bU

Notice that bU
bL. bU is the firm’s beta if it had no debt. Beta is a measure of risk, so
with no debt one would anticipate bU
bL.
b. Using the unlevered beta calculated in Part a, the company’s new levered beta under
the changed capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity is calculated as follows:
bL
bU 1

bL

Again, notice that the new bL

debt level. The risk is lower, and this is reflected in the new lower levered beta.

13-3C THE OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Column 9 of Table 13.4 also shows Bigbee’s WACCs at different capital structures.
Currently, it has no debt; so its debt ratio is zero and its WACC is rs
9%. As
Bigbee begins to substitute lower-cost debt for higher-cost equity, its WACC
declines. However, as the debt ratio rises, the costs of both debt and equity rise,
at first slowly but then at a faster and faster rate. Eventually, the increasing costs
of the two components offset the fact that more low-cost debt is being used.
Indeed, at 40% debt, the WACC hits a minimum of 8 23%; after that, it rises with
further increases in the debt ratio.
Another way of looking at this is to note that even though the component cost
of equity is higher than that of debt, using only lower-cost debt would not
maximize value because of the feedback effects of debt on the costs of debt and
equity. For example, if Bigbee used more than 40% debt (say, 50%), it would have
more of the less expensive capital component in its capital structure; but this
benefit would be more than offset by the fact that the additional debt increases
the costs of debt and equity.
Finally, and very importantly, recall that the capital structure that minimizes
the WACC is also the capital structure that maximizes the firm’s stock price. Bigbee
distributes all of its earnings as dividends, so it reinvests no earnings in the
business, which leads to an expected growth rate in earnings and dividends of
zero. Thus, in Bigbee’s case, we can use the zero growth stock price model devel-
oped in Chapter 9 to estimate the stock price at each different capital structure.
These estimates are shown in Column 7 of Table 13.4. Here we see that the stock
price first rises with financial leverage, hits a peak of $22 25 at a debt ratio of 40%,
and then begins to decline. Thus, Bigbee’s optimal capital structure occurs at a debt ratio
of 40%, and that debt ratio both maximizes its stock price and minimizes its WACC.17
The EPS, cost of capital, and stock price data shown in Table 13.4 are plotted
in Figure 13.7. As the graph shows, the debt ratio that maximizes Bigbee’s
expected EPS is 50%. However, the expected stock price is maximized, and the
WACC is minimized at a 40% debt ratio. Thus, Bigbee’s optimal capital structure
calls for 40% debt and 60% equity. Management should set its target capital
structure at these ratios; and if the existing ratios are off target, it should move
toward that target when new securities are issued.
S E L F T E S T
What happens to the component costs of debt and equity when the debt ratio
is increased? Why does this occur?
Using the Hamada equation, explain the effects of financial leverage on beta.
What is the equation for calculating a firm’s unlevered beta?
Use the Hamada equation to calculate the unlevered beta for Firm X with the following
data: bL = 1.25, T = 40%, Debt/Capital = 0.42, and Equity/Capital = 0.58. (bU = 0.8714)
What would be the cost of equity for Firm X at Equity/Capital ratios of 1.0
(no debt) and 0.58 assuming that rRF = 5% and RPM = 4%? (8.49%, 10%)
Using a graph and illustrative data, discuss the premiums for financial risk and
business risk at different debt levels. Do these premiums vary depending on the
debt level? Explain.
Is expected EPS generally maximized at the optimal capital structure? Explain.
17We could also estimate the stock price if some earnings were retained and the expected growth rate
were positive. However, this would complicate the analysis, and it is another reason we generally
analyze the optimal capital structure decision using the WACC rather than the stock price.

13-4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORY
Business risk is an important determinant of the optimal capital structure. More-
over, firms in different industries have different business risks. So we would
expect capital structures to vary considerably across industries, and this is the
case. For example, biotechnology companies generally have very different capital
structures than food processors. In addition, capital structures vary among firms
within a given industry, which is a bit harder to explain. What factors can explain
these differences? In an attempt to answer that question, academics and practi-
tioners have developed a number of theories.

Modern capital structure theory began in 1958 when Professors Franco Mo-
digliani and Merton Miller (hereafter, MM) published what has been called the
most influential finance article ever written.18 MM proved, under a restrictive set
of assumptions, that a firm’s value should be unaffected by its capital structure.
Put another way, MM’s results suggest that it does not matter how a firm finances
its operations—hence, that capital structure is irrelevant. However, the assump-
tions upon which MM’s study was based are not realistic, so their results are
questionable. Here is a partial listing of their assumptions:
1.
There are no brokerage costs.
2.
There are no taxes.
3.
There are no bankruptcy costs.
4.
Investors can borrow at the same rate as corporations.
5.
All investors have the same information as management about the firm’s
future investment opportunities.
6.
EBIT is not affected by the use of debt.
Despite the fact that some of these assumptions are unrealistic, MM’s irrele-
vance result is extremely important. By indicating the conditions under which
capital structure is irrelevant, MM provided clues about what is required to make
capital structure relevant and, therefore, to affect a firm’s value. MM’s work
marked the beginning of modern capital structure research, and subsequent
research has focused on relaxing the MM assumptions to develop a more robust
and realistic theory. Research in this area is quite extensive, but the highlights are
summarized in the following sections.
13-4A THE EFFECT OF TAXES19
MM’s original 1958 paper was criticized harshly, and they published a follow-up
in 1963 that relaxed the assumption of no corporate taxes.20 They recognized that
the Tax Code allows corporations to deduct interest payments as an expense, but
YOGI BERRA ON THE MM PROPOSITION
When a waitress asked Yogi Berra (Baseball Hall of Fame
catcher for the New York Yankees) whether he wanted his
pizza cut into four pieces or eight, Yogi replied: “Better make
it four. I don’t think I can eat eight.”
Yogi’s quip helps convey Modigliani and Miller’s basic
insight. The firm’s choice of leverage divides future cash
flows in a way that’s like slicing a pizza. MM recognized that
if a company’s future investments are fixed, it’s like fixing the
size of the pizza: No information costs means that everyone
sees the same pizza; no taxes means that the IRS gets none
of the pie; and no “contracting” costs means that nothing
sticks to the knife.
So just as the substance of Yogi’s meal is unaffected by
whether the pizza is sliced into four pieces or eight, the
economic substance of the firm is unaffected by whether
the liability side of the balance sheet is sliced to include
more or less debt under the MM assumptions. Note, though,
that whereas the IRS may get none of Yogi’s pizza, it is very
likely to get some of the firm’s income. Yogi’s assumptions
are more realistic than MM’s.

dividend payments to stockholders are not deductible. This differential treatment
encourages corporations to use debt in their capital structures. Indeed, MM
demonstrated that if all their other assumptions hold, this differential treatment
leads to an optimal capital structure of 100% debt.
MM’s 1963 work was modified several years later by Merton Miller (this time
without Modigliani), when he brought in the effects of personal taxes.21 Miller
noted that bonds pay interest, which is taxed as personal income at rates going up
to 35% (39 6% in 2013), while income from stocks comes partly from dividends
and partly from capital gains. Further, long-term capital gains are taxed at a
maximum rate of 15% (20% in 2013 for high-income taxpayers), and this tax can
be deferred until the stock is sold and the gain realized. If a stock is held until the
owner dies, no capital gains tax must be paid. So on balance, returns on common
stocks are taxed at lower effective rates than returns on debt.22
Because of the tax situation, Miller argued that investors are willing to accept
relatively low before-tax returns on stocks as compared to the before-tax returns
on bonds. For example, an investor in the 39 6% tax bracket might require
a
10%
pretax
return
on
Bigbee’s
bonds,
which
would
result
in
a
10% 1
T
10% 0 604
6 04% after-tax return. Bigbee’s stock is riskier than
its bonds, so the investor would require a higher after-tax return (say, 8%) on the
stock. Because the stock’s returns (either dividends or capital gains) would be
taxed at 20%, a pretax return of 8%
1
T
8 0% 0 80
10 0% would provide
the required 8 0% after-tax return. In this example, the interest rate on the bonds
would be 10%, the same as the required return on the stock, rs. Thus, the more
favorable treatment of income on the stock would cause investors to accept the
same before-tax returns on the stock and on the bond.23
As Miller pointed out,
(1) the deductibility of interest favors the use of debt
financing, but (2) the more favorable tax treatment of income from stocks lowers the
required rates of return on stocks and thus favors the use of equity. It is difficult to
specify the net effect of these two factors. However, most observers believe that
interest deductibility has a stronger effect and hence that our tax system favors
the corporate use of debt. Still, that effect is certainly reduced by the lower taxes
on stock income. Indeed, Duke University professor John Graham estimated
the overall tax benefits of debt financing.24 He concluded that the tax benefits
associated with debt financing represent about 7% of the average firm’s value;
so if a leverage-free firm decided to use an average amount of debt, its value
would rise by 7%.
13-4B THE EFFECT OF POTENTIAL BANKRUPTCY
MM’s irrelevance results also depend on the assumption that firms don’t go
bankrupt and hence that bankruptcy costs are irrelevant. However, in practice,
bankruptcy exists, and it can be quite costly. Firms in bankruptcy have high legal
and accounting expenses, and they have a hard time retaining customers, suppli-
ers, and employees. Moreover, bankruptcy often forces a firm to liquidate assets
for less than they would be worth if the firm continued to operate. Assets such as
21Merton H. Miller, “Debt and Taxes,” Journal of Finance, vol. 32, no. 2 (May 1977), pp. 261–275.
22When Miller wrote his article, dividends were taxed at a maximum rate of 70% and capital gains at a
much lower rate. Today (2013) dividends and capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for
high-income taxpayers, but interest is taxed at a maximum rate of 39.6%. [Capital gains can be caught
by the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), in which case they are taxed at either 26% or 28% depending
on one’s income bracket.] These tax law changes would not affect Miller’s final conclusion.
23The situation here is similar to that involving tax-exempt municipal bonds versus taxable bonds.

plant and equipment are often illiquid because they are configured to a company’s
individual needs and because they are difficult to disassemble and move.
Note too that the threat of bankruptcy, not just bankruptcy per se, brings about
these problems. If they become concerned about the firm’s future, key employees
start “jumping ship,” suppliers start refusing to grant credit, customers begin
seeking more stable suppliers, and lenders start demanding higher interest rates
and imposing stricter loan covenants.
Bankruptcy-related problems are likely to increase the more debt a firm has in
its capital structure. Therefore, bankruptcy costs discourage firms from pushing
their use of debt to excessive levels. Note too that bankruptcy-related costs have
two components: (1) the probability of their occurrence and (2) the costs that will
be incurred if financial distress arises. A firm whose earnings are relatively
volatile, all else equal, faces a greater chance of bankruptcy and thus should use
less debt than a more stable firm. This is consistent with our earlier point that
firms with high operating leverage (and thus greater business risk) should limit
their use of financial leverage. Likewise, firms whose assets are illiquid and would
have to be sold at “fire sale” prices should limit their use of debt financing.
13-4C TRADE-OFF THEORY
The preceding arguments led to the development of what is called “the trade-off
theory of leverage.” This theory states that firms trade off the tax benefits of
debt financing against problems caused by potential bankruptcy. A summary
of the trade-off theory is expressed graphically in Figure 13.8. Here are some
observations about the figure:
1.
The fact that interest paid is a deductible expense makes debt less expensive
than common or preferred stock. In effect, the government pays part of the
cost of debt—or to put it another way, debt provides tax shelter benefits. As
a result, using more debt reduces taxes and thus allows more of the firm’s
operating income (EBIT) to flow through to investors. This factor, on which

MM focused, tends to raise the stock’s price. Indeed, under the assumptions
of MM’s original paper, the stock price would be maximized at 100% debt.
The line labeled “MM Result Incorporating the Effects of Corporate Taxation”
in Figure 13.8 expresses the relationship between stock prices and debt under
their assumptions.
2.
In the real world, firms have target debt ratios that call for less than 100% debt
to limit the adverse effects of potential bankruptcy.
3.
There is some threshold level of debt, labeled D1 in Figure 13.8, below which
the probability of bankruptcy is so low as to be immaterial. Beyond D1,
however, bankruptcy-related costs become increasingly important and they
begin to offset the tax benefits of debt. In the range from D1 to D2, bankruptcy-
related costs reduce but do not completely offset the tax benefits of debt;
so the firm’s stock price continues to rise (but at a decreasing rate) as its debt
ratio increases. However, beyond D2, bankruptcy-related costs exceed the
tax benefits; so from this point on, increasing the debt ratio lowers the stock
price. Therefore, D2 is the optimal capital structure, the one where the stock
price is maximized. Of course, D1 and D2 vary from firm to firm depending
on business risk and bankruptcy costs, and they can change for a given firm
over time.
4.
While theoretical and empirical work supports the general shape of the curves
in Figures 13.7 and 13.8, these graphs must be taken as approximations, not as
precisely defined functions. The numbers in Figure 13.7 are rounded to two
decimal places, but that is merely for illustrative purposes—the numbers are
not nearly that accurate because the graph is based on estimates.
5.
Another disturbing aspect of capital structure theory expressed in Figure 13.8
is the fact that many large, successful firms such as Intel and Microsoft use far
less debt than the theory suggests. This point led to the development of
signaling theory, which is discussed in the next section.
13-4D SIGNALING THEORY
MM assumed that everyone—investors and managers alike—has the same infor-
mation about a firm’s prospects. This is called symmetric information. However,
in fact, managers often have better information than outside investors. This is
called asymmetric information, and it has an important effect on the optimal
capital structure. To see why, consider two situations, one where the company’s
managers know that its prospects are extremely favorable (Firm F) and one where
the managers know that the future looks unfavorable (Firm U).
Now suppose Firm F’s R&D labs have just discovered a nonpatentable
cure for the common cold. They want to keep the new product a secret as long
as possible to delay competitors’ entry into the market. New plants must be
built to make the new product, so capital must be raised. But how should
Firm F raise the needed capital? If it sells stock, when profits from the new
product start flowing in, the price of the stock will rise sharply and purchasers
of the new stock will make a bonanza. The current stockholders (including the
managers) also will do well, but not as well as they would have done if
the company had not sold stock before the price increased. In that case, they
would not have had to share the benefits of the new product with the new
stockholders. Therefore, we would expect a firm with very favorable prospects to
avoid selling stock, and instead raise any required new capital by using new debt,
even if this moved its debt ratio beyond the target level.25
25It would be illegal for Firm F’s managers to personally purchase more shares on the basis of their
inside knowledge of the new product. They could be sent to jail if they did.

Now consider Firm U. Suppose its managers have information that new
orders are off sharply because a competitor has installed new technology that
improved the quality of its products. Firm U must upgrade its own facilities at a
high cost just to maintain current sales. As a result, its return on investment will
fall (but not by as much as if it took no action, which would lead to a 100% loss
through bankruptcy). How should Firm U raise the needed capital? Here the
situation is just the reverse of that facing Firm F—Firm U will want to sell stock
so that some of the adverse consequences will be borne by new investors. There-
fore, a firm with unfavorable prospects would want to finance with stock, which would
mean bringing in new investors to share the losses.26
The conclusion from all this is that firms with extremely bright prospects
prefer not to finance through new stock offerings, whereas firms with poor
prospects do like to finance with outside equity. How should you, as an
investor, react to this conclusion? You ought to say, “If I see that a company
plans to issue new stock, I should worry because I know that management
would not want to issue stock if future prospects looked good. However,
management would want to issue stock if things looked bad. Therefore,
I should lower my estimate of the firm’s value, other things held constant,
if it plans to issue new stock.”
If you gave that answer, your views are consistent with those of sophisticated
portfolio managers. In a nutshell, the announcement of a stock offering is generally
taken as a signal that the firm’s prospects as seen by its management are not bright. This,
in turn, suggests that when a firm announces a new stock offering, more often
than not, the price of its stock will decline.27 Empirical studies have shown that
this situation does exist.28
What are the implications of all this for capital structure decisions? Issuing
stock emits a negative signal and thus tends to depress the stock price; so even if
the company’s prospects are bright, a firm should, in normal times, maintain a
reserve borrowing capacity that can be used in the event that some especially
good investment opportunity comes along. This means that firms should, in normal
times, use more equity and less debt than is suggested by the tax benefit/bankruptcy cost
trade-off model illustrated in Figure 13.8.
13-4E USING DEBT FINANCING TO CONSTRAIN MANAGERS
In Chapter 1, we stated that conflicts of interest may arise if managers and share-
holders have different objectives. Such conflicts are particularly likely when the
firm has more cash than is needed to support its core operations. Managers often
use excess cash to finance their pet projects or for perquisites such as plush offices,
corporate jets, and skyboxes at sports arenas, all of which may do little to benefit
stock prices.29 By contrast, managers with more limited free cash flow are less able
to make wasteful expenditures.
Firms can reduce excess cash flow in a variety of ways. One way is to
funnel some of it back to shareholders through higher dividends or stock
repurchases. Another alternative is to tilt the target capital structure toward
more debt in the hope that higher debt service requirements will force man-
agers to become more disciplined. If debt is not serviced as required, the

firm will be forced into bankruptcy, in which case its managers would lose
their jobs. Therefore, a manager is less likely to buy an expensive corporate jet
if the firm has large debt service requirements.
A leveraged buyout (LBO) is a good way to reduce excess cash flow. In an
LBO, debt is used to finance the purchase of a high percentage of the com-
pany’s shares. Indeed, the projected savings from reducing frivolous waste
has motivated quite a few leveraged buyouts. As noted, high debt payments
after the LBO force managers to conserve cash by eliminating unnecessary
expenditures.
Of course, increasing debt and reducing free cash flow has its downside: It
increases the risk of bankruptcy. A former professor (who is currently the Federal
Reserve chairman) has argued that adding debt to a firm’s capital structure is like
putting a dagger into the steering wheel of a car.30 The dagger—which points
toward your chest—motivates you to drive more carefully; but you may get
stabbed if someone runs into you, even if you are being careful. The analogy
applies to corporations in the following sense: Higher debt forces managers to
be more careful with shareholders’ money; but even well-run firms can face
bankruptcy (get stabbed) if some event beyond their control, such as a war, an
earthquake, a strike, or a recession, occurs. To complete the analogy, the capital
structure decision comes down to deciding how big a dagger stockholders should
use to keep managers in line.
If you find the discussion of capital structure theory imprecise and somewhat
confusing, you’re not alone. In truth, not even the chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board knows how to identify a firm’s precise optimal capital structure or how to
measure the effects of capital structure changes on stock prices and the cost of
capital. In practice, capital structure decisions must be made using a combination
of judgment and numerical analysis. Still, an understanding of the theoretical
issues presented here can help you make better judgments about capital structure
issues.
13-4F PECKING ORDER HYPOTHESIS
Yet another factor that may influence capital structures is the idea that managers
have a preferred pecking order when it comes to raising capital and that this
pecking order affects capital structure decisions.31 We know that firms often
finance in the following order: Their first source of funds is accounts payable
and accruals. Retained earnings generated during the current year would be the
next source. Then, if the amount of retained earnings is not sufficient to cover
capital requirements, firms issue debt. Finally, and only as a last resort, they issue
new common stock.
Why might it be logical for a firm to follow this pecking order? First, no
flotation costs are incurred to raise capital as spontaneous credit or retained
earnings, and costs are relatively low when issuing new debt. However, flotation
costs for new stock issues are quite high, and the existence of asymmetric
information/signaling effects makes it even more undesirable to finance with
new common stock. So, the pecking order theory is logical, and it can influence a
firm’s capital structure, although there is still some debate about its relative
importance.32

13-4G WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY
If a company’s stock is selling for a price different than its intrinsic value, the
company’s managers can adjust the firm’s capital structure to take advantage
of this mispricing. When a company’s stock is overvalued (trading for more
than its intrinsic value), its managers can take the opportunity to issue new
equity at a time when its market value is relatively high. Likewise, managers
may choose to repurchase stock when the firm’s stock is undervalued. A study
by Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler documents that many companies take
advantage of these “windows of opportunity,” and they argue that these
attempts to time the market have had a profound effect on these companies’
capital structures.33
13-5 CHECKLIST FOR CAPITAL STRUCTURE DECISIONS
In addition to the types of analyses discussed previously, firms generally consider
the following factors when making capital structure decisions:
1.
Sales stability. A firm whose sales are relatively stable can safely take on more
debt and incur higher fixed charges than a company with unstable sales.
Utility companies, because of their stable demand, historically have been able
to use more financial leverage than can industrial firms.
2.
Asset structure. Many companies also take their desired cash holdings into
account when setting their target capital structure. Holding other factors
constant, a company is able to take on more debt if it has more cash on
the balance sheet. For this reason, some analysts also evaluate an alternative
measure, net debt, which subtracts cash and equivalent securities from
the company’s total debt:
Net debt
Short-term debt
Long-term debt
Cash and equivalents
Looking at Table 13.1, we see that Caterpillar has $49 billion in net debt
($54 5 billion in total debt minus $5 5 billion in cash and equivalents).
Holding other factors constant, firms that have more cash or other assets

that are suitable as security for loans tend to use debt relatively heavily.
General-purpose assets that can be used by many businesses make good
collateral, whereas special-purpose assets do not. Thus, real estate
companies are usually highly leveraged, whereas companies involved in
technological research are not.34
3.
Operating leverage. Other things the same, a firm with less operating leverage is
better able to employ financial leverage because it will have less business risk.
4.
Growth rate. Other things the same, faster-growing firms must rely more
heavily on external capital. Further, the flotation cost involved in selling
common stock exceeds that incurred when selling debt, which encourages
rapidly growing firms to rely more heavily on debt. At the same time,
however, those firms often face higher uncertainty, which tends to reduce
their willingness to use debt.
5.
Profitability. It is often observed that firms with very high rates of return on
investment use relatively little debt. Although there is no theoretical
justification for this fact, one practical explanation is that very profitable firms
such as Intel, Microsoft, and Google do not need to do much debt financing.
Their high rates of return enable them to do most of their financing with
internally generated funds.
6.
Taxes. Interest is a deductible expense, and deductions are most valuable to
firms with high tax rates. Therefore, the higher a firm’s tax rate, the greater the
advantage of debt.
7.
Control. The effect of debt versus stock on a management’s control position can
influence capital structure. If management currently has voting control (more
than 50% of the stock) but is not in a position to buy any more stock, it may
choose debt for new financings. On the other hand, management may decide to
use equity if the firm’s financial situation is so weak that the use of debt might
subject it to serious risk of default. The reason? If the firm goes into default,
managers will probably lose their jobs. However, if too little debt is used,
management runs the risk of a takeover. Thus, control considerations can lead
to the use of debt or equity because the type of capital that best protects
management varies from situation to situation. In any event, if management is
at all insecure, it will consider the control situation.
8.
Management attitudes. No one can prove that one capital structure will lead
to higher stock prices than another. Management, then, can exercise its own
judgment about the proper capital structure. Some managers tend to be
relatively conservative and thus use less debt than an average firm in the
industry, whereas aggressive managers use a relatively high percentage of
debt in their quest for higher profits.
9.
Lender and rating agency attitudes. Regardless of a manager’s analysis of the
proper leverage factors for his or her firm, the attitudes of lenders and rating
agencies frequently influence financial structure decisions. Corporations often
discuss their capital structures with lenders and rating agencies and give
much weight to their advice. For example, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s
34Two capital structure issues that we do not address in this chapter relate to how long-term leases and
convertible securities impact the financing mix. Leases are de facto a substitute for debt, so it would be
appropriate to determine the present value of the firm’s future lease payments and treat them as debt.
Thus, if we were examining two firms with debt ratios of 50%, but one leases many of its assets and
does not reflect those transactions on its balance sheet, then it is really more leveraged than the other
firm. Convertibles are bonds (or preferred stocks) that can be converted into common stock at the
option of the holder. Before conversion, these securities technically increase the firm’s financial
leverage, but immediately after conversion leverage declines. For a precise examination of a firm’s
leverage, it would be useful to estimate the likely timing of conversion and take it into account.
However, such an analysis goes beyond the scope of an introductory text.

recently told one large utility that its bonds would be downgraded if it issued
more bonds. This influenced its decision, and its next financing was with
common equity.
10.
Market conditions. Conditions in the stock and bond markets undergo long-
and short-run changes that can have an important bearing on a firm’s optimal
capital structure. For example, during a recent credit crunch, the junk bond
market dried up and there simply was no market at a “reasonable” interest
rate for any new long-term bonds rated below BBB. Therefore, low-rated
companies in need of capital were forced to go to the stock market or to the
short-term debt market, regardless of their target capital structures. When
conditions eased, however, these companies sold long-term bonds to get
their capital structures back on target.
11.
The firm’s internal condition. A firm’s own internal condition can also have
a bearing on its target capital structure. For example, suppose a firm just
successfully completed an R&D program and forecasts higher earnings in the
immediate future. However, the new earnings are not yet anticipated by
investors and are not reflected in the stock price. This company would not
want to issue stock—it would prefer to finance with debt until the higher
earnings materialize and are reflected in the stock price. Then it could sell
an issue of common stock, use the proceeds to retire the debt, and return
to its target capital structure. This point was discussed earlier in connection
with asymmetric information and signaling.
12.
Financial flexibility. An astute corporate treasurer made this statement to the
authors:
Our company can earn a lot more money from good capital budgeting and operating
decisions than from good financing decisions. Indeed, we are not sure exactly how
financing decisions affect our stock price, but we know for sure that having to turn
down promising ventures because funds are not available will reduce our long-run
profitability. For this reason, my primary goal as treasurer is to always be in a position
to raise the capital needed to support operations.
We also know that when times are good, we can raise capital with either stocks or
bonds, but when times are bad, suppliers of capital are much more willing to make funds
available if we give them a stronger position, and this means debt. Further, when we sell
a new issue of stock, this sends a negative “signal” to investors, so stock sales by a
mature company such as ours are not desirable.
Combining these thoughts gives rise to the goal of maintaining financial
flexibility, which from an operational viewpoint means maintaining adequate
“reserve borrowing capacity.” Determining the “adequate” reserve is based on
judgment; but it clearly depends on the firm’s forecasted need for funds, predicted
capital market conditions, management’s confidence in its forecasts, and the
consequences of a capital shortage.

13-6 VARIATIONS IN CAPITAL STRUCTURES
As might be expected, wide variations in the use of financial leverage occur across
industries and among the individual firms in each industry. Table 13.5 illustrates
differences for selected companies in different industries; the ranking is in ascend-
ing order of the company’s long-term debt ratio.35
Petroleum, aerospace, biotechnology, and steel companies use relatively little
debt because their industries tend to be cyclical, oriented toward research, or
subject to huge product liability suits. On the other hand, grocery stores, utility
companies, and airlines use debt relatively heavily because their fixed assets make
good security for mortgage bonds and their relatively stable sales make it safe to
carry more than average debt.
The times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio gives an indication of how vulnerable the
company is to financial distress. This ratio depends on three factors: (1) the
percentage of debt, (2) the interest rate on the debt, and (3) the company’s profit-
ability. Generally, low-leveraged companies such as Exxon Mobil and Eli Lilly
have high coverage ratios, whereas companies like ConAgra, Kroger, and U.S.
Airways, which have financed heavily with debt, have lower coverage ratios.
Wide variations in capital structures also exist among firms in given industries.
This can be seen from Table 13.5. For example, although the average ratio of long-
term debt to total capital in 2013 for the petroleum industry was 22 48%, Exxon
Mobil had a ratio of 7 41%. Thus, factors unique to individual firms, including
managerial attitudes, play an important role in setting target capital structures.

When we studied the cost of capital in Chapter 10, we took the firm’s capital
structure as given and calculated the cost of capital based on that structure. Then
in Chapters 11 and 12, we described capital budgeting techniques, which use
the cost of capital as input. Capital budgeting decisions determine the types of
projects that a firm accepts, which affect the nature of the firm’s assets and its
business risk. In this chapter, we reverse the process, taking the firm’s assets
and business risk as given and then seeking to determine the best way to finance
those assets. More specifically, in this chapter, we examined the effects of financial
leverage on earnings per share, stock prices, and the cost of capital and we
discussed various capital structure theories.
The different theories lead to different conclusions about the optimal capital
structure, and no one has been able to prove that one theory is better than the
others. Therefore, we cannot estimate a firm’s optimal capital structure with much
precision. Accordingly, financial executives generally treat the optimal capital
structure as a range—for example, 40% to 50% debt—rather than as a precise
point, such as 45% debt. The concepts discussed in this chapter are used as a
guide, and they help managers understand the factors to consider when they are
setting the target capital structures of their firms.

OPERATING LEVERAGE AND BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
Olinde Electronics Inc. produces
stereo components that sell at P = $100 per unit. Olinde’s fixed costs are $200,000,
variable costs are $50 per unit, 5,000 components are produced and sold each year,
EBIT is currently $50,000, and Olinde’s assets (all equity-financed) are $500,000. Olinde
can change its production process by adding $400,000 to assets and $50,000 to fixed
operating costs. This change would (1) reduce variable costs per unit by $10 and
(2) increase output by 2,000 units, but (3) the sales price on all units would have to
be lowered to $95 to permit sales of the additional output. Olinde has tax loss carry-
forwards that cause its tax rate to be zero, it uses no debt, and its average cost of capital is 10%.
a. Should Olinde make the change? Why or why not?
b. Would Olinde’s break-even point increase or decrease if it made the change?
c. Suppose Olinde was unable to raise additional equity financing and had to borrow the
$400,000 at an interest rate of 10% to make the investment. Use the DuPont equation to
find the expected ROA of the investment. Should Olinde make the change if debt
financing must be used? Explain.

OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Carlisle Industries is trying to determine its optimal
capital structure, which now consists of only common equity. The firm will add debt to
its capital structure if it minimizes its WACC, but the firm has no plans to use
preferred stock in its capital structure. In addition, the firm’s size will remain the same,
so funds obtained from debt issued will be used to repurchase stock. The percentage of
shares repurchased will be equal to the percentage of debt added to the firm’s capital
structure. (In other words, if the firm’s debt-to-capital ratio increases from 0 to 25%,
then 25% of the shares outstanding will be repurchased.)
Its treasury staff has consulted with investment bankers. On the basis of those discussions,
the staff has created the following table showing the firm’s debt cost at different debt
levels:

When the Bell System was broken up, the old AT&T was split into a new AT&T and
seven regional telephone companies. The specific reason for forcing the breakup was to
increase the degree of competition in the telephone industry. AT&T had a monopoly on
local service, long distance, and the manufacture of all equipment used by telephone
companies; and the breakup was expected to open most of those markets to competi-
tion. In the court order that set the terms of the breakup, the capital structures of the
surviving companies were specified and much attention was given to the increased
competition telephone companies could expect in the future. Do you think the optimal
capital structure after the breakup was the same as the pre-breakup optimal capital
structure? Explain your position.

separately? How would these decisions affect one another? How could the leverage
concept be used to help management analyze the situation?

FINANCIAL LEVERAGE EFFECTS
Firms HL and LL are identical except for their financial
leverage ratios and the interest rates they pay on debt. Each has $20 million in invested
capital, has $4 million of EBIT, and is in the 40% federal-plus-state tax bracket. Firm HL,
however, has a debt-to-capital ratio of 50% and pays 12% interest on its debt, whereas LL
has a 30% debt-to-capital ratio and pays only 10% interest on its debt. Neither firm uses
preferred stock in its capital structure.
a.
Calculate the return on invested capital (ROIC) for each firm.
b.
Calculate the return on equity (ROE) for each firm.
c.
Observing that HL has a higher ROE, LL’s treasurer is thinking of raising the debt-to-
capital ratio from 30% to 60% even though that would increase LL’s interest rate on all
debt to 15%. Calculate the new ROE for LL.

HAMADA EQUATION
Cyclone Software Co. is trying to establish its optimal capital
structure. Its current capital structure consists of 25% debt and 75% equity; however, the
CEO believes that the firm should use more debt. The risk-free rate, rRF, is 5%; the market
risk premium, RPM, is 6%; and the firm’s tax rate is 40%. Currently, Cyclone’s cost of equity
is 14%, which is determined by the CAPM. What would be Cyclone’s estimated cost of
equity if it changed its capital structure to 50% debt and 50% equity?

RECAPITALIZATION
Tapley Inc. currently has total capital equal to $5 million, has zero debt,
is in the 40% federal-plus-state tax bracket, has a net income of $1 million, and distributes
40% of its earnings as dividends. Net income is expected to grow at a constant rate of
5% per year, 200,000 shares of stock are outstanding, and the current WACC is 13 40%.
The company is considering a recapitalization where it will issue $1 million in debt and
use the proceeds to repurchase stock. Investment bankers have estimated that if the
company goes through with the recapitalization, its before-tax cost of debt will be 11%
and its cost of equity will rise to 14 5%.
a.
What is the stock’s current price per share (before the recapitalization)?
b.
Assuming that the company maintains the same payout ratio, what will be its stock
price following the recapitalization? Assume that shares are repurchased at the price
calculated in Part a.

RECAPITALIZATION
Currently, Bloom Flowers Inc. has a capital structure consisting of
20% debt and 80% equity. Bloom’s debt currently has an 8% yield to maturity. The risk-free
rate (rRF) is 5%, and the market risk premium (rM −rRF) is 6%. Using the CAPM, Bloom
estimates that its cost of equity is currently 12 5%. The company has a 40% tax rate.

BREAKEVEN AND LEVERAGE
Wingler Communications Corporation (WCC) produces
premium stereo headphones that sell for $28 80 per set, and this year’s sales are expected
to be 450,000 units. Variable production costs for the expected sales under present
production methods are estimated at $10,200,000, and fixed production (operating) costs at
present are $1,560,000. WCC has $4,800,000 of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 8%. There
are 240,000 shares of common stock outstanding, and there is no preferred stock. The dividend
payout ratio is 70%, and WCC is in the 40% federal-plus-state tax bracket.
The company is considering investing $7,200,000 in new equipment. Sales would not increase,
but variable costs per unit would decline by 20%. Also, fixed operating costs would
increase from $1,560,000 to $1,800,000. WCC could raise the required capital by borrowing
$7,200,000 at 10% or by selling 240,000 additional shares of common stock at $30 per share.
a.
What would be WCC’s EPS (1) under the old production process, (2) under the new
process if it uses debt, and (3) under the new process if it uses common stock?
b.
At what unit sales level would WCC have the same EPS assuming it undertakes the
investment and finances it with debt or with stock? {Hint: V = variable cost per unit

Part b, setting the EPS equation equal to zero.)
d.
On the basis of the analysis in Parts a through c and given that operating leverage is
lower under the new setup, which plan is the riskiest, which has the highest expected
EPS, and which would you recommend? Assume that there is a fairly high probability
of sales falling as low as 250,000 units. Determine EPSDebt and EPSStock at that sales
level to help assess the riskiness of the two financing plans.

FINANCING ALTERNATIVES
The Severn Company plans to raise a net amount of $270
million to finance new equipment in early 2015. Two alternatives are being considered:
Common stock may be sold to net $60 per share, or bonds yielding 12% may be issued. The
balance sheet and income statement of the Severn Company prior to financing are as follows:

WACC AND OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Elliott Athletics is trying to determine its
optimal capital structure, which now consists of only debt and common equity. The firm
does not currently use preferred stock in its capital structure, and it does not plan to do so
in the future. Its treasury staff has consulted with investment bankers. On the basis of those
discussions, the staff has created the following table showing the firm’s debt cost at
different debt levels:

a. What is the firm’s optimal capital structure, and what would be its WACC at the
optimal capital structure?
b. If Elliott’s managers anticipate that the company’s business risk will increase in the
future, what effect would this likely have on the firm’s target capital structure?
c. If Congress were to dramatically increase the corporate tax rate, what effect would this
likely have on Elliott’s target capital structure?
d. Plot a graph of the after-tax cost of debt, the cost of equity, and the WACC versus
(1) the debt/capital ratio and (2) the debt/equity ratio.

CAMPUS DELI INC.

OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Assume that you have just been hired as business manager of Campus
Deli (CD), which is located adjacent to the campus. Sales were $1,100,000 last year, variable costs were
60% of sales, and fixed costs were $40,000. Therefore, EBIT totaled $400,000. Because the university’s
enrollment is capped, EBIT is expected to be constant over time. Because no expansion capital is
required, CD distributes all earnings as dividends. Invested capital is $2 million, and 80,000 shares are
outstanding. The management group owns about 50% of the stock, which is traded in the over-the-
counter market.
CD currently has no debt—it is an all-equity firm—and its 80,000 shares outstanding sell at a price of
$25 per share, which is also the book value. The firm’s federal-plus-state tax rate is 40%. On the basis of
statements made in your finance text, you believe that CD’s shareholders would be better off if some debt
financing were used. When you suggested this to your new boss, she encouraged you to pursue the idea
but to provide support for the suggestion.
In today’s market, the risk-free rate, rRF, is 6% and the market risk premium, RPM, is 6%. CD’s
unlevered beta, bU is 1 0. CD currently has no debt, so its cost of equity (and WACC) is 12%. If the firm
was recapitalized, debt would be issued and the borrowed funds would be used to repurchase stock.
Stockholders, in turn, would use funds provided by the repurchase to buy equities in other fast-food
companies similar to CD. You plan to complete your report by asking and then answering the following
questions.
a. 1. What is business risk? What factors influence a firm’s business risk?
2. What is operating leverage, and how does it affect a firm’s business risk?
3. What is the firm’s return on invested capital (ROIC)?
b. 1. What do the terms financial leverage and financial risk mean?
2. How does financial risk differ from business risk?
c. To develop an example that can be presented to CD’s management as an illustration, consider two
hypothetical firms: Firm U with zero debt financing and Firm L with $
,
of 12% debt. Both firms
have $20,000 in invested capital and a 40% federal-plus-state tax rate, and they have the following
EBIT probability distribution for next year:
Probability

1. Complete the partial income statements and the firms’ ratios in Table IC 13.1.
2. Be prepared to discuss each entry in the table and to explain how this example illustrates the
effect of financial leverage on expected rate of return and risk.
d. After speaking with a local investment banker, you obtain the following estimates of the cost of debt
at different debt levels (in thousands of dollars):

3. Assume that shares could be repurchased at the current market price of $25 per share. Calculate
CD’s expected EPS and TIE at debt levels of $0, $250,000, $500,000, $750,000, and $1,000,000. How
many shares would remain after recapitalization under each scenario?
4. Using the Hamada equation, what is the cost of equity if CD recapitalizes with $250,000 of debt?
$500,000? $750,000? $1,000,000?
5. Considering only the levels of debt discussed, what is the capital structure that minimizes CD’s

this would affect the analysis. How would the analysis be affected if the firm had less business risk
than originally estimated?

EXPLORING THE CAPITAL STRUCTURES FOR FOUR RESTAURANT COMPANIES
This chapter provides an overview of the effects of leverage and describes the process that firms use to
determine their optimal capital structure. The chapter also indicates that capital structures tend to vary
across industries and across countries. If you are interested in exploring these differences in more detail,
Thomson ONE provides information about the capital structures of each of the companies it follows. The
following discussion questions demonstrate how we can use this information to evaluate the capital
structures for four restaurant companies: Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG),
Ruby Tuesday (RT), and O’Charley’s Inc. (CHUX).
Discussion Questions
1.
To get an overall picture of each company’s capital structure, it is helpful to look at a chart that summarizes the
company’s capital structure over the past decade. To obtain this chart, choose a company to start with and select
FINANCIALS. Next, select MORE>THOMSON REPORTS & CHARTS>CAPITAL STRUCTURE. This should
generate a chart that plots the company’s total long-term debt, total common equity, and total current liabilities
over the past decade. What, if any, are the major trends that emerge when you’re looking at these charts? Do
these companies tend to have relatively high or relatively low levels of debt? Do these companies have significant
levels of current liabilities? Have their capital structures changed over time?
2.
To get more details about the companies’ capital structures over the past 5 years, select FINANCIALS>FINANCIAL
RATIOS>THOMSON RATIOS. From here, you can select ANNUAL RATIOS and/or 5 YEAR AVERAGE RATIOS
REPORT. In each case, you can scroll down and look for “Leverage Ratios.” Here you will find a variety of leverage
ratios for the past 5 years. (Notice that these two pages offer different information. The ANNUAL RATIOS
page offers year-end leverage ratios, while the 5 YEAR AVERAGE RATIOS REPORT offers the average ratio
over the previous 5 years for each calendar date. In other words, the 5 YEAR AVERAGE RATIOS REPORT

smoothes the changes in capital structure over the reporting period.) Do these ratios suggest that the company has
significantly changed its capital structure over the past 5 years? If so, what factors could possibly explain this shift?
(Financial statements might be useful to detect any shifts that may have led to the company’s changing capital
structure. You may also consult the company’s annual report to see if there is any discussion and/or explanation for
these changes. Both the historical financial statements and annual report information can be found via Thomson

Repeat this procedure for the other three companies. Do you find similar capital structures for each of the four
companies? Do you find that the capital structures have moved in the same direction over the past 5 years, or
have the different companies changed their capital structures in different ways over the past 5 years?

The financial ratios investigated thus far are based on book values of debt and equity. Determine whether using
the market value of equity (market capitalization is found on the OVERVIEW page) makes a significant difference
in the most recent year’s “LT Debt Pct Common Equity,” “Total Debt Pct Common Equity,” and “LT Debt Pct
Total Capital.” (Note: “LT Debt” is defined by Thomson ONE as the “Long Term Debt” listed on the balance
sheet, while “Total Debt” is defined as “Long Term Debt” plus “ST Debt & Current Portion Due LT Debt.”) Are
there big differences between the capital structures measured on a book or market basis? Explain your answer.

Apple Shifts Gears and Begins to Unload Part of Its Vast Cash Hoard
Profitable companies regularly face three impor-
tant questions: (1) How much of our free cash
flow should we pass on to shareholders?
(2) Should we provide this cash to stockholders
by raising the dividend or by repurchasing
stock? (3) Should we maintain a stable, consis-
tent payment policy; or should we let the pay-
ments vary as conditions change?
In this chapter, we discuss many of the
issues that affect firms’ cash distribution policies.
As we will see, mature companies with stable
cash flows and limited growth opportunities
tend to return a significant amount of their cash
to shareholders either by paying dividends or by
repurchasing
common
stock.
By
contrast,
rapidly growing companies with good invest-
ment opportunities are prone to invest most of
their available cash in new projects rather than
paying dividends or repurchasing stock. Apple
Inc., which has been regarded over the past
decade as the epitome of a growth company,
illustrates this tendency. Its sales grew from
$6.2 billion in 2003 to $156.5 billion in 2012,
which translates to an annual growth rate of
more than 40%. Much of this growth came from
large, long-term investments in new products
and technology; given the firm’s emphasis
on growth, it had long been reluctant to pay
dividends.
Demonstrating this viewpoint at a share-
holders’ meeting in early 2010, Apple’s legend-
ary co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs strongly
reaffirmed that the company had no intentions
to start paying a dividend, even though Apple
had more than $50 billion in cash and short-
term securities on its balance sheet. According
to The Wall Street Journal, Jobs said “that he
preferred ‘to leave the powder dry’ for future

acquisitions, though none were in the offing. He added that
the cash ‘will come in handy’.”
However, after Steve Jobs died in late 2011, the company
faced increased pressure to return some of its cash to share-
holders. Since then, the company’s cash holdings have con-
tinued to balloon, while at the same time there are growing
concerns that Apple’s growth engine may be slowing down.
Reflecting these concerns, the company’s stock fell sharply
from $700 in October 2012 to below $400 per share just six
months later in April 2013.
Well aware of the new environment, the company’s
new CEO Tim Cook shifted gears; in early 2012, Apple estab-
lished a dividend and also announced a plan to repurchase
shares of its common stock. However, despite these efforts
to return cash to its shareholders, the cash kept pouring in,
and by early 2013 the company still had a staggering
$137 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet.
In response, the company took even more dramatic steps.
In April 2013, it announced a 15% increase in its quarterly
dividend and plans to raise its share repurchases from
$10 billion to $60 billion. So while Apple continues to gen-
erate a great deal of cash, its aggressive use of dividends and
share repurchases to return cash to shareholders recently
represents an important shift in policy.
When managers decide how and when to distribute cash
to shareholders, they face a fundamental question: Could we
earn more on the available cash if we kept it in the firm and
used it to invest in new projects, or would shareholders earn
more if they received the cash and invested it in alternative
investments with the same risk? If the company could earn
more, it would make sense to retain the cash. However, if
investors could earn more, the company would increase
shareholder value by paying out more dividends and/or by
repurchasing more shares.

Successful companies earn income. That income can be reinvested in operating
assets, used to retire debt, or distributed to stockholders. If the decision is made to
distribute income to stockholders, three key issues arise: (1) How much should be
distributed? (2) Should the distribution be in the form of dividends, or should the
cash be passed on to shareholders by buying back stock? (3) How stable should
the distribution be? That is, should the funds paid out from year to year be stable
and dependable, which stockholders like; or should they be varied depending on
the firms’ cash flows and investment requirements, which managers tend to like?
Those three issues are the primary focus of this chapter. By the time you
complete it, you should be able to:
•
Explain why some investors like the firm to pay more dividends while other
investors prefer reinvestment and the resulting capital gains.
•
Discuss the various trade-offs that companies face when trying to establish
their optimal dividend policy.
•
Differentiate between stock splits and stock dividends.
•
List the advantages and disadvantages of stock repurchases vis-à-vis dividends
from both investors’ and companies’ perspectives.

14-1 DIVIDENDS VERSUS CAPITAL GAINS: WHAT
DO INVESTORS PREFER?
When deciding how much cash to distribute, financial managers must keep in
mind that the firm’s objective is to maximize shareholder value. Consequently, the
target payout ratio—defined as the percentage of net income to be paid out as
cash dividends—should be based in large part on investors’ preferences for
dividends versus capital gains: Do investors prefer to receive dividends; or would
they rather have the firm plow the cash back into the business, which presumably
will produce capital gains? This preference can be considered in terms of the
constant growth stock valuation model.
^P0
D1
rs
g
If the company increases the payout ratio, this will raise D1, which, taken alone,
will cause the stock price to rise. However, if D1 is raised, less money will be
available for reinvestment, which will cause the expected growth rate to decline;
and that will tend to lower the stock’s price. Therefore, any change in the payout
policy will have two opposing effects. As a result, the optimal dividend policy
must strike the balance between current dividends and future growth that max-
imizes the stock price. In the following sections, we discuss the major theories that
have been advanced to explain how investors regard current dividends versus
future growth.
14-1A DIVIDEND IRRELEVANCE THEORY
Professors Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (MM) advanced the dividend
irrelevance theory, which stated that dividend policy has no effect on either the
price of a firm’s stock or its cost of capital.1 MM developed their theory under a
stringent set of assumptions; and under those assumptions, they proved that a
firm’s value is determined only by its basic earning power and its business risk. In
other words, the value of the firm depends only on the income produced by its
assets, not on how that income is split between dividends and retained earnings.
Note, though, that MM assumed, among other things, that no taxes are paid on
dividends, that stocks can be bought and sold with no transactions costs, and that
everyone—investors and managers alike—has the same information regarding
firms’ future earnings.
Given their assumptions, MM argued that each shareholder can construct his
or her own dividend policy. For example, if a firm does not pay dividends, a
shareholder who wants a 5% dividend can “create” it by selling 5% of his or her
stock. Conversely, if a company pays a higher dividend than an investor wants,
the investor can use the unwanted dividends to buy additional shares of the
company’s stock. Note, though, that in the real world, individual investors who
want additional dividends would have to incur transactions costs to sell shares,
and investors who do not want dividends would have to pay taxes on the
unwanted dividends and then incur transactions costs to purchase shares with
the after-tax dividends. Because taxes and transactions costs do exist, dividend
policy may well be relevant and investors may prefer policies that help them
reduce taxes and transactions costs.

In defense of their theory, MM noted that many stocks are owned by institu-
tional investors who pay no taxes and who can buy and sell stocks with very low
transactions costs. For such investors, dividend policy might well be irrelevant;
and if these investors dominate the market and represent the “marginal investor,”
MM’s theory could be valid in spite of its unrealistic assumptions. Note too that
for tax-paying investors, the taxes and transactions costs depend on what the
individual investor’s income is and how long he or she plans to hold the stock. As
a result, when it comes to investors’ preferences for dividends, one size does not
fit all. Next, we discuss why some investors prefer dividends whereas others
prefer capital gains.
14-1B REASONS SOME INVESTORS PREFER DIVIDENDS
The principal conclusion of MM’s dividend irrelevance theory is that dividend
policy does not affect either stock prices or the required rate of return on equity, rs.
Early critics of MM’s theory suggested that investors preferred a sure dividend
today to an uncertain future capital gain. In particular, Myron Gordon and John
Lintner argued that rs declines as the dividend payout is increased because
investors are less certain of receiving the capital gains that should result from
retaining earnings than they are of receiving dividend payments.2
MM disagreed. They argued that rs is independent of dividend policy, which
implies that investors are indifferent between dividends and capital gains, that is,
between D1 P0 and g. MM called the Gordon-Lintner argument the bird-in-the-
hand fallacy because in MM’s view, most investors plan to reinvest their divi-
dends in the stock of the same or similar firms and, in any event, the riskiness of
the firm’s cash flows to investors in the long run is determined by the riskiness of
operating cash flows, not by dividend payout policy.
Keep in mind, however, that MM’s theory relied on the assumption that there
are no taxes or transactions costs, which means that investors who prefer divi-
dends could simply create their own dividend policy by selling a percentage of
their stock each year. In reality, most investors face transactions costs when they
sell stock; so investors who are looking for a steady stream of income would
logically prefer that companies pay regular dividends. For example, retirees who
have accumulated wealth over time and now want annual income from their
investments probably prefer dividend-paying stocks.
14-1C REASONS SOME INVESTORS PREFER CAPITAL GAINS
While dividends reduce transactions costs for investors who are looking for steady
income from their investments, dividends increase transactions costs for other
investors who are less interested in income and more interested in saving money
for the long-term future. These long-term investors want to reinvest their divi-
dends, and that creates transactions costs. Given this concern, a number of
companies have established dividend reinvestment plans that help investors
automatically reinvest their dividends. (We discuss dividend reinvestment plans
in Section 14-4.)
In addition (and perhaps more importantly), the Tax Code encourages many
individual investors to prefer capital gains to dividends. One key advantage is
that taxes must be paid on dividends the year they are received; whereas taxes on

capital gains are not paid until the stock is sold. Due to time value effects, a dollar
of taxes paid in the future has a lower effective cost than a dollar of taxes paid
today.3 Apart from this advantage, the tax rate on dividends has often been higher
than the tax rate on capital gains. For example, prior to 2003, dividends were taxed
at the ordinary income tax rate, which went up to 38 6% versus a rate of 20% on
long-term capital gains. These differential rates were eliminated in 2003, when the
maximum tax rate on dividends and long-term capital gains was set at 15%.4
However, in early 2013, Congress increased the maximum tax rate on dividends
and long-term capital gains to 20% for high-income taxpayers.5
14-2 OTHER DIVIDEND POLICY ISSUES
Before we discuss how dividend policy is set in practice, we need to examine two
other issues that affect dividend policy: (1) the information content, or signaling,
hypothesis and (2) the clientele effect.
14-2A INFORMATION CONTENT, OR SIGNALING, HYPOTHESIS
An increase in the dividend is often accompanied by an increase in the stock price,
while a dividend cut generally leads to a stock price decline. This observation was
used to refute MM’s irrelevance theory—their opponents argued that stock price
actions after changes in dividend payouts demonstrate that investors prefer
dividends to capital gains. However, MM argued differently. They noted that
corporations are reluctant to cut dividends and hence that corporations do not raise
dividends unless they anticipate higher earnings in the future to support the
higher dividends. Thus, MM argued that a higher-than-expected dividend increase
S E L F T E S T
Explain briefly the ideas behind the dividend irrelevance theory.
What did Modigliani and Miller assume about taxes and brokerage costs when
they developed their dividend irrelevance theory?
Why did MM refer to the Gordon-Lintner dividend argument as the bird-in-the-
hand fallacy?
Why do some investors prefer high-dividend-paying stocks?
Why might other investors prefer low-dividend-paying stocks?
3Moreover, if a stock is held by someone until he or she dies, there is no capital gains tax at all—the
beneficiaries who receive the stock can use the stock’s value on the date of death as their cost basis,
which permits them to escape the capital gains tax completely.
4However, long-term capital gains are classified as income subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax
(AMT), and the AMT rate in 2013 was 26% or 28% depending on your income bracket. The AMT was
supposed to hit only the very wealthy, but prior to 2013 it was not indexed for inflation. So by 2012,
many not-so-wealthy individuals were being hit. However, Congress fixed this problem with new tax
legislation and beginning in 2013 the AMT exemption amounts are indexed to inflation.
5Effective January 1, 2013, long-term capital gains and dividend tax rates increased to 20% for single
taxpayers earning more than $400,000 and for married persons filing jointly earning more than
$450,000. Short-term capital gains on assets held for one year or less are taxed as ordinary income.
Effective January 1, 2013, the top tax rate on ordinary income was 39.6% for single taxpayers earning
more than $400,000 and married persons filing jointly earning more than $450,000.

is a signal to investors that management forecasts good future earnings.6 Conversely,
a dividend reduction, or a smaller-than-expected increase, is a signal that manage-
ment forecasts poor future earnings. If the MM position is correct, stock price changes
after dividend increases or decreases do not demonstrate a preference for dividends
over retained earnings. Rather, such price changes simply indicate that dividend
announcements have information (signaling) content, about future earnings.
Managers often have better information about future prospects for dividends
than public stockholders, so there is clearly some information content in dividend
announcements. However, it is difficult to tell whether the stock price changes
that follow dividend increases or decreases reflect only signaling effects (as MM
argue) or both signaling and dividend preference. Still, a firm should consider
signaling effects when it is contemplating a change in dividend policy. For
example, if a firm has good long-term prospects but also has a need for cash to
fund current investments, it might be tempted to cut the dividend to increase
funds available for investment. However, this action might cause the stock price to
decline because the dividend reduction is taken as a signal that future earnings are
likely to decline, when just the reverse is actually true. So managers should
consider signaling effects when they set dividend policy.
14-2B CLIENTELE EFFECT
As we indicated earlier, different groups, or clienteles, of stockholders prefer
different dividend payout policies. For example, retired individuals, pension
funds, and university endowment funds generally prefer cash income; so they
often want the firm to distribute a high percentage of its earnings. Such investors
are frequently in low or even zero tax brackets, so taxes are of little concern. On
the other hand, stockholders in their peak earning years might prefer reinvestment
because they have less need for current investment income and simply reinvest
dividends received after incurring income taxes and brokerage costs.
If a firm retains and reinvests income rather than paying dividends, those
stockholders who need current income will be disadvantaged. The value of their
stock might increase, but they will be forced to go to the trouble and expense of
selling some of their shares to obtain cash. Also, some institutional investors (or
trustees for individuals) might be legally precluded from selling stock and then
“spending capital.” On the other hand, stockholders who are saving rather than
spending dividends favor the low-dividend policy: The less the firm pays out in
dividends, the less these stockholders have to pay in current taxes and the less
trouble and expense they must go through to reinvest their after-tax dividends.
Therefore, investors who want current investment income should own shares in
high-dividend-payout firms, while investors with no need for current investment
income should own shares in low-dividend-payout firms. For example, investors
seeking high cash income might invest in Duke Energy, an electric utility that paid
a dividend of $3 06 for a dividend payout of 95% in mid-2013, while investors
favoring growth could invest in Adobe Systems, a computer software company
that had no dividend payout.
All of this suggests that a clientele effect exists, which means that firms have
different clienteles and that the clienteles have different preferences; hence, a
6Stephen Ross has suggested that managers can use capital structure as well as dividends to give
signals concerning a firm’s future prospects. For example, a firm with good earnings prospects can
carry more debt than a similar firm with poor earnings prospects. This theory, called incentive signaling,
rests on the premise that signals with cash-based variables (either debt interest or dividends) cannot be
mimicked by unsuccessful firms because those firms do not have the future cash-generating power to
maintain the announced interest or dividend payment. Thus, investors are more likely to believe a
glowing verbal report when it is accompanied by a dividend increase or a debt-financed expansion
program. See Stephen A. Ross, “The Determination of Financial Structure: The Incentive-Signaling
Approach,” The Bell Journal of Economics, vol. 8, no. 1 (Spring 1977), pp. 23–40.

change in dividend policy might upset the majority clientele and have a negative
effect on the stock’s price.7 This suggests that a company should follow a stable,
dependable dividend policy so as to avoid upsetting its clientele.
Borrowing from the ideas of behavioral finance, some recent research suggests
that investors’ preferences for dividends vary over time. Malcolm Baker and
Jeffrey Wurgler have proposed a catering theory for dividends where investors
sometimes have strong preferences for safety and high-dividend-paying stocks,
whereas at other times they are more aggressive and seek low-dividend-paying
stocks with greater potential for capital gains. Baker and Wurgler argue that
corporate managers accommodate the shifting preferences of investors, and are
more likely to initiate dividends when dividend-paying stocks are in favor with
investors, and are more likely to omit dividends when investors demonstrate a
greater preference for capital gains.8
14-3 ESTABLISHING THE DIVIDEND POLICY IN PRACTICE
Investors may or may not prefer dividends to capital gains; however, because of
the clientele effect, they almost certainly prefer predictable dividends. Given this
situation, how should firms set their basic dividend policies? In particular, how
should a company establish the specific percentage of earnings it will distribute,
the form of that distribution, and the stability of its distributions over time? In this
section, we describe how most firms answer those questions.
14-3A SETTING THE TARGET PAYOUT RATIO: THE RESIDUAL
DIVIDEND MODEL9
When a firm is deciding how much cash to distribute to stockholders, it should
consider two points: (1) The overriding objective is to maximize shareholder
value; and (2) the firm’s cash flows really belong to its shareholders, so manage-
ment should not retain income unless they can reinvest those earnings at higher
rates of return than shareholders can earn themselves. On the other hand, recall
from Chapter 10 that internal equity (retained earnings) is less expensive than
external equity (new common stock); so if good investments are available, it is
better to finance them with retained earnings than with new stock.
S E L F T E S T
Define (1) information content and (2) the clientele effect, and explain how they
affect dividend policy.
What is “catering theory,” and how does it impact a firm’s dividend policy?
7For example, see R. Richardson Pettit, “Taxes, Transactions Costs and the Clientele Effect of
Dividends,” The Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 5, no. 3 (December 1977), pp. 419–436.
8See Malcolm Baker and Jeffrey Wurgler, “A Catering Theory of Dividends,” The Journal of Finance, vol.
59, no. 3 (June 2004), pp. 1125–1165.
9The term payout ratio can be interpreted two ways: (1) in the conventional way, as the percentage of
net income paid out as cash dividends or (2) as the percentage of net income distributed to stockholders
through dividends and share repurchases. In this section, we assume that no repurchases occur.
Increasingly, though, firms are using the residual model to determine “distributions to shareholders”
and then making a separate decision as to the form of those distributions. Further, over time, an
increasing percentage of the total distribution has been in the form of share repurchases.

When a dividend policy is established, one size does not fit all. Some firms
produce a large amount of cash but have limited investment opportunities—this is
true for firms in profitable but mature industries where few growth opportunities
exist. Such firms typically distribute a large percentage of their cash to shareholders,
thereby attracting investor clienteles who prefer high dividends. Other firms have
many good investment opportunities but currently generate little or no excess cash.
Such firms generally distribute few or no cash dividends but enjoy rising earnings
and stock prices, thereby attracting investors who prefer capital gains.
The past few decades have seen increasing numbers of young, high-growth
firms trading on the stock exchanges. A study by Eugene Fama and Kenneth
French showed that the proportion of firms paying dividends has fallen sharply
over time. In 1978, 66 5% of firms on the major stock exchanges paid dividends. By
1999, that proportion had fallen to 20 8%. Fama and French’s analysis suggested
that part of this decline was due to the changing composition of firms on the
exchanges. However, their analysis also indicated that all firms, new and old, have
become less likely to pay dividends.10
As a result of the 2003 tax changes, which lowered the tax rate on dividends,
many companies initiated dividends or increased their payouts. For example, in
2002, only 113 companies raised or initiated dividends; however, in 2003 that
number doubled to 229. Previously, those companies would have been more inclined
to repurchase shares. As of June 2013, 413 companies in the S&P 500 paid dividends.
As Table 14.1 suggests, dividend payouts and dividend yields for large cor-
porations vary considerably. Generally, firms in stable, cash-producing industries
such as utilities, food, and tobacco pay relatively high dividends, whereas compa-
nies in rapidly growing industries such as computer software and biotechnology
tend to pay lower dividends. Average dividends also differ significantly across
countries. Higher payout ratios in some countries can be partially explained by
lower tax rates on earnings distributed as cash dividends relative to applicable rates
on reinvested income. This biases the dividend policy toward higher payouts.
For a given firm, the optimal payout ratio is a function of four factors:
(1) management’s opinion about its investors’ preferences for dividends versus

capital gains, (2) the firm’s investment opportunities, (3) the firm’s target capital
structure, and (4) the availability and cost of external capital. These factors are
combined in what we call the residual dividend model. First, under this model,
we assume that investors are indifferent between dividends and capital gains.
Then the firm follows these four steps to establish its target payout ratio: (1) It
determines the optimal capital budget; (2) given its target capital structure, it
determines the amount of equity needed to finance that budget; (3) it uses retained
earnings to meet equity requirements to the extent possible; and (4) it pays
dividends only if more earnings are available than are needed to support the
optimal capital budget. The word residual implies “leftover,” and the residual
policy implies that dividends are paid out of “leftover” earnings.
If a firm rigidly follows the residual dividend policy, dividends paid in any
given year can be expressed in the following equation:
Dividends
Net income
Retained earnings required to help
finance new investments
Net income
Target equity ratio Total capital budget
For example, suppose the company has $100 million of earnings, it has a target
equity ratio of 60%, and it plans to spend $50 million on capital projects. In that
case, it would need $50 0 6
$30 million of common equity plus $20 million of
new debt to finance the capital budget. That would leave $100
$30
$70 million
available for dividends, which would result in a 70% payout ratio.
Note that the amount of equity needed to finance the capital budget might
exceed net income. In the preceding example, if the capital budget was
$100 Equity percentage
$100 0 6
$166 67 million, no dividends would be
paid. If the capital budget exceeded $166 67, the company would have to issue
new common stock in order to maintain its target capital structure.
Most firms have a target capital structure that calls for at least some debt, so
new financing is done partly with debt and partly with equity. As long as a firm
finances with the optimal mix of debt and equity and uses only internally gener-
ated equity (retained earnings), the marginal cost of each new dollar of capital will
be minimized. So internally generated equity is available for financing a certain
amount of new investment; but beyond that amount, the firm must turn to more
expensive new common stock. At the point where new stock must be sold, the cost
of equity (and consequently the marginal cost of capital) rises.
To illustrate these points, consider the case of Texas and Western (T&W)
Transport Company. T&W’s overall composite cost of capital is 10%. However,
this cost assumes that all new equity comes from retained earnings. If the com-
pany must issue new stock, its cost of capital will be higher. T&W has $60 million
of net income and a target capital structure with 60% equity and 40% debt.
Provided it does not pay any cash dividends, T&W could make net investments
(investments in addition to asset replacements from depreciation) of $100 million,
consisting of $60 million from retained earnings plus $40 million of new debt
supported by the retained earnings, at a 10% marginal cost of capital. If the capital
budget exceeded $100 million, the required equity component would exceed net
income, which is, of course, the maximum possible amount of retained earnings.
In this case, T&W would have to issue new common stock, thereby pushing its
cost of capital above 10%.11
11If T&W does not retain all of its earnings, its cost of capital will rise above 10% before its capital
budget reaches $100 million. For example, if T&W chose to retain $36 million, its cost of capital would
increase once the capital budget exceeded $36/0.6 = $60 million. To understand this point, note that a
capital budget of $60 million would require $36 million of equity. If the capital budget rose above
$60 million, the company’s required equity capital would exceed its retained earnings, thereby
requiring it to issue new common stock.
Residual Dividend Model
A model in which the
dividend paid is set equal
to net income minus the
amount of retained
earnings necessary to
finance the firm’s optimal
capital budget.

At the beginning of its planning period, T&W’s financial staff considers all
proposed projects for the upcoming period. All independent projects are
accepted if their estimated IRRs exceed their risk-adjusted costs of capital. In
choosing among mutually exclusive projects, the project with the highest posi-
tive NPV is accepted. The capital budget represents the amount of capital that is
required to finance all accepted projects. If T&W follows a strict residual divi-
dend policy, we can see from Table 14.2 that the estimated capital budget will
have a profound effect on its dividend payout ratio. If investment opportunities
are poor, the capital budget will be only $40 million. To maintain the target
capital structure, 0 6 $40
$24 million must be equity, with the remaining
$16 million as debt. If T&W followed a strict residual policy, it would pay out
$60
$24
$36 million as dividends; hence, its payout ratio would be
$36 $60
0 6
60%.
If the company’s investment opportunities were average, its capital budget
would be $70 million. This would require $42 million of equity; so dividends
would be $60
$42
$18 million, for a payout of $18 $60
30%. Finally, if
investment opportunities were good, the capital budget would be $150 million
and 0 6 $150
$90 million of equity would be required. Therefore, all of the
net income would be retained, dividends would be zero, and the company
would have to issue some new common stock to maintain the target capital
structure.
We see then that under the residual model, dividends and the payout ratio
would vary with investment opportunities. Dividend variations would also occur
if earnings fluctuated. Because investment opportunities and earnings vary from
year to year, strict adherence to the residual dividend policy would result in
unstable dividends. One year the firm might pay zero dividends because it needed
the money to finance good investment opportunities, but the next year it might
pay high dividends because investment opportunities were poor and it didn’t
need to retain as much. Similarly, fluctuating earnings would also lead to variable
dividends, even if investment opportunities were stable. Therefore, following the
residual dividend policy would almost certainly lead to fluctuating, unstable dividends.
This would not be bad if investors were not bothered by fluctuating dividends;
but because investors prefer stable, dependable dividends, it would not be opti-
mal to strictly follow the residual model each year. One possible strategy that
firms could use to balance these concerns is to:

2.
Use the forecasted information to find the average dividends that would be
paid using the residual model (and the corresponding payout ratio) during the
planning period.
3.
Set a target payout policy based on the projected data.
Thus, firms should use the residual policy to help set their long-run target payout ratios,
but not as a guide to the payout in any one year.
Most large companies use the residual dividend model in a conceptual sense
and then implement it with a computerized financial forecasting model. Informa-
tion on projected capital expenditures and working capital requirements is entered
into the model, along with sales forecasts, profit margins, depreciation, and the
other elements required to forecast cash flows. The target capital structure is also
specified; the model then generates the amount of debt and equity that will be
required to meet the capital budgeting requirements while maintaining the target
capital structure.
Dividend payments are introduced; and the higher the payout ratio, the
greater the required external equity. Most companies use the model to find a
dividend payout over the forecast period (generally 5 years) that will provide
sufficient equity to support the capital budget without having to sell new common
stock or taking the capital structure ratios outside the optimal range. This chap-
ter’s Excel model includes an illustration of this process. In addition, Web
Appendix 14A discusses this approach in more detail. The end result might be a
memo such as the following from the CFO to the chairperson of the board:
We forecasted the total market demand for our products, what our share of the market is
likely to be, and our required investments in capital assets and working capital. Using this
information, we developed projected balance sheets and income statements for the period
2015–2019.
Our 2014 dividends totaled $50 million, or $2.00 per share. On the basis of projected
earnings, cash flows, and capital requirements, we can increase the dividend by 6% per
year. This would be consistent with a payout ratio of 42%, on average, over the forecast
period. Any faster dividend growth rate would require us to sell common stock, cut the
capital budget, or raise the debt ratio. Any slower growth rate would lead to increases in
the common equity ratio. Therefore, I recommend that the Board increase the dividend for
2015 by 6%, to $2 12, and that it plan for similar increases in the future.
Events over the next 5 years will undoubtedly lead to differences between
our forecasts and actual results. If and when such events occur, we should reexamine
our position. However, I am confident that we can meet random cash shortfalls by
increasing our borrowings—we have unused debt capacity that gives us flexibility in this
regard.
We ran the corporate model under several scenarios. If the economy totally collapses,
our earnings will not cover the dividend. However, in all likely scenarios our cash flows
would cover the recommended dividend. I know the Board does not want to push the
dividend up to a level where we would have to cut it under poor economic conditions. Our
model runs indicate, though, that the $2 12 dividend could be maintained under any
reasonable set of forecasts. Only if we increased the dividend to more than $3.00 would we
be seriously exposed to the danger of having to reduce it.
I might also note that most analysts’ reports are forecasting that our dividends will
grow in the 5% to 6% range. Thus, if we go to $2 12, we will be at the high end of the
forecast range, which should give our stock a boost. With takeover rumors so widespread,
getting the stock price up a bit would make us all breathe a little easier.
Finally, we considered distributing cash to shareholders through a stock repurchase
program. Here we would reduce the dividend payout ratio and use the funds generated to
buy our stock on the open market. Such a program has several advantages, but it would
also have drawbacks. I do not recommend that we institute a stock repurchase program at
this time. However, if our free cash flows exceed our forecasts, I would recommend that we
use these surpluses to buy back stock. Also, I plan to continue looking into a regular
repurchase program, and I may recommend such a program in the future.

This company has very stable operations, so it can plan its dividends with a
fairly high degree of confidence. Other companies, especially those in cyclical
industries, have difficulty maintaining a dividend in bad times that would be
too low in good times. Such companies often set a very low “regular” dividend
and then supplement it with an “extra” dividend when times are good, which is
Dividend Yields Around the World
Average dividend yields have varied over time, and they vary
considerably in different countries around the world. The accom-
panying graph, obtained from a study by Elroy Dimson, Paul
Marsh, and Mike Staunton of the London Business School, shows
how the average dividend yield for 16 different countries has
changed over the past century. In both 1900 and 1950, dividend
yields varied from nation to nation, but the average around the
world was about 5%. However, by 2004, the yield in most coun-
tries had declined significantly and the average had fallen to
about 3%. For the United States, the average dividend yield
was 4.3% in 1900, 7.2% in 1950, and 1.7% in 2004. Thus, U.S.
stocks went from having one of the highest yields in 1900 to the
second lowest in 2004. Since then, the average dividend yield for
U.S. stocks has increased somewhat. In June 2013, the dividend
yield on the S&P 500 stood just above 2%, a level that is still
below the average yield found in many other countries.

known as a low-regular-dividend-plus-extras dividend policy. The company
announces a low regular dividend that it is confident it can maintain “come hell
or high water,” one that stockholders could count on under all conditions. Then
when times are good and profits and cash flows are high, the company pays a
clearly designated extra dividend. Because investors recognize that the extras
might not be maintained in the future, they don’t interpret them as a signal that
the companies’ earnings are permanently higher nor do they take the elimination
of the extra as a negative signal.
Alternately, companies may temporarily suspend paying dividends because of
a short-run need for cash, but the hope is that they will be able to restore the
dividend when its situation returns to normal. For example, during the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill crisis, BP bowed to political pressure and suspended a series of
dividend payments for the first three quarters of 2010, using the cash to pay for part
of its clean-up operations. BP resumed paying dividends in the fourth quarter of
2010 (although at a smaller amount than it had been paying prior to the oil spill).
14-3B EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, AND DIVIDENDS
We normally think of earnings as being the primary determinant of dividends, but
cash flows are actually more important. This is demonstrated in Figure 14.1, which
plots data for Chevron Corporation from 1985 through 2012. Panel A shows that
Chevron’s dividends per share (DPS) rose slowly but steadily from 1985 to 2012.
Earnings per share (EPS) also grew slowly; but they were more volatile, rising and
falling with the price of oil. The earnings payout ratio (defined as DPS EPS)
averaged 63% over the entire 28 years, but it exceeded 100% on several occasions.
Cash flow per share (CFPS) tracked EPS very closely—the two were correlated
at 0 99. However, CFPS was always higher than EPS, and it always exceeded the
dividend by a substantial margin. Moreover, cash dividends are paid in cash; so
even when earnings were insufficient to cover the dividend, cash flows took up
the slack and enabled the company to maintain a stable dividend policy.
Now look at Panel B. Here we see that the earnings payout is extremely
volatile, but the cash flow payout (defined as DPS CFPS) is relatively stable and
always below 100%. Those stable (and high) cash flows indicate that Chevron’s
dividend is relatively safe, and investors can count on receiving it going forward.
Indeed, given the very high cash flows per share, continued substantial dividend
increases (or large share repurchases) are likely—provided something bad doesn’t
happen in the oil market.
Chevron is typical of most large, strong companies. Its dividend is dependable,
and it grows at a steady rate. Earnings are relatively volatile; but cash flows are
more stable, and those stable cash flows are responsible for the steady dividends.
When earnings change dramatically, either up or down, dividends are likely to
follow with a lag while management determines whether the earnings change is
likely to continue. Thus, the dip in Chevron’s earnings in 2001 and 2002 turned out
to be temporary, so the dividend was maintained and even increased during those
years. The huge earnings and cash flow gains after 2002 continued into 2008.
However, earnings and cash flows declined in 2009 during the economic slowdown
but have returned to even higher levels during 2010 through 2012. Chevron’s DPS is
still well below its CFPS and EPS, which suggests that dividends, repurchases, and
profitable new investments will continue on into the future. But Chevron does deal
with oil; and with that commodity, strange things can happen!
14-3C PAYMENT PROCEDURES
Companies normally pay dividends quarterly; and if conditions permit, the dividend
is increased once each year. For example, Katz Corporation paid $0 50 per quarter in
2014, an annual rate of $2 00. In common financial parlance, we say that Katz’s 2014
regular quarterly dividend was $0 50 and its annual dividend was $2 00. In late 2014,

Katz’s board of directors met, reviewed projections for 2015, and decided to keep the
2015 dividend at $2 00. The directors announced the $2 00 rate, so stockholders can
count on receiving it unless unanticipated operating problems arise.

declared the regular quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, payable to
holders of record at the close of business on December 4, payment to be made
on January 2, 2015.” For accounting purposes, the declared dividend becomes
an actual liability on the declaration date. If a balance sheet was constructed,
the amount ($0 50
Number of shares outstanding) would appear as a
current liability and retained earnings would be reduced by a like amount.
2.
Holder-of-record date. At the close of business on the holder-of-record date,
December 4, the company closes its stock transfer books and makes up a list of
shareholders as of that date. If Katz Corporation is notified of the sale before
the close of business on December 4, the new owner will receive the dividend.
However, if notification is received on or after December 5, the previous
owner will receive the dividend check.
3.
Ex-dividend date. Suppose Jean Buyer buys 100 shares of stock from John Seller
on December 1. Will the company be notified of the transfer in time to list
Buyer as the new owner and thus pay the dividend to her? To avoid conflict,
the securities industry has set up a convention under which the right to the
dividend remains with the stock until 2 business days prior to the holder-of-
record date; on the second business day before that date, the right to
the dividend no longer goes with the shares. The date when the right to the
dividend leaves the stock is called the ex-dividend date. In this case, the
ex-dividend date is 2 business days prior to December 4, or December 2:
Dividend goes with stock if it is bought on or before this date
December 1
Ex-dividend date: Buyer does not receive the dividend
December 2
Buyer does not receive the dividend
December 3
Holder-of-record date; not normally of concern to stockholder
December 4
Therefore, if Buyer is to receive the dividend, Buyer must buy the stock on or
before December 1. If Buyer buys it on December 2 or later, Seller will receive
the dividend because he or she will be the official holder of record.
Katz’s dividend amounts to $0 50, so the ex-dividend date is important.
Barring fluctuations in the stock market, we would normally expect the price
of a stock to drop by approximately the amount of the dividend on the
ex-dividend date. Thus, if Katz closed at $30 50 on December 1, it would
probably open at about $30 on December 2.12
4.
Payment date. The company actually mails the checks to the holders of record
on January 2, the payment date.
12Tax effects cause the price decline, on average, to be less than the full amount of the dividend. If you
bought Katz’s stock on December 1, you would receive the dividend, but you would almost
immediately pay 15% (20% if you were a high-income bracket taxpayer) of it in taxes. Thus, you
would want to wait until December 2 to buy the stock if you thought you could get it for $0.50 less per
share. Your reaction (and that of others) would influence stock prices around dividend payment dates.
Here is what would happen:
1.
Other things held constant, a stock’s price should rise during the quarter, with the daily price
increase (for Katz) equal to $0.50/90 = $0.005556. Therefore, if the price started at $30 just after its
last ex-dividend date, it would rise to $30.50 on December 1.
2.
In the absence of taxes, the stock’s price would fall to $30 on December 2 and then start up as the
next dividend accrual period began. Thus, over time, if everything else was held constant, the
stock’s price would follow a sawtooth pattern if it was plotted on a graph.
3.
Because of taxes, the stock’s price would neither rise by the full amount of the dividend nor fall by
the full dividend amount when it goes ex-dividend.
4.
The amount of the rise and subsequent fall would be the Dividend (1 −T), where generally T = 15%,
the tax rate on individual dividends (unless you are a high-income bracket taxpayer then T = 20%).

14-4 DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS
During the 1970s, most large companies instituted dividend reinvestment plans
(DRIPs), under which stockholders can automatically reinvest their dividends in
the stock of the paying corporation.13 Today most large companies offer DRIPs,
but participation rates vary considerably. There are two types of DRIPs: (1) plans
that involve only old, already-outstanding stock and (2) plans that involve newly
issued stock. In either case, the stockholder must pay taxes on the amount of the
dividends even though stock rather than cash is received.
Under both types of DRIPs, stockholders choose between continuing to
receive dividend checks versus having the company use the dividends to buy
more stock in the corporation for the investor. Under an “old stock” plan, the
company gives the money that stockholders who elect to use the DRIP would
have received to a bank, which acts as a trustee. The bank then uses the money to
purchase the corporation’s stock on the open market and allocates the shares
purchased to the participating stockholders’ accounts on a pro rata basis. The
transaction costs of buying shares (brokerage costs) are low because of volume
purchases, so these plans benefit small stockholders who do not need current cash
dividends.
A “new stock” DRIP invests the dividends in newly issued stock; hence, these
plans raise new capital for the firm. AT&T, Xerox, and many other companies
have used new stock plans to raise substantial amounts of equity. No fees are
charged to stockholders, and some companies have offered stock at discounts of
1% to 10% below the actual market price. The companies offer discounts because
they would have incurred flotation costs if the new stock had been raised through
investment banks.
One interesting aspect of DRIPs is that they are forcing corporations to
reexamine their basic dividend policies. A high participation rate in a DRIP
suggests that stockholders might be better served if the firm simply reduced cash
dividends, which would save stockholders some personal income taxes. Quite a
few firms have surveyed their stockholders to learn more about their preferences
and to find out how they would react to a change in dividend policy. A more
rational approach to basic dividend policy decisions may emerge from this

research. Companies switch from old stock to new stock DRIPs depending on
their need for equity capital.
Many companies offering DRIPs have expanded their programs by moving to
“open enrollment,” whereby anyone can purchase the firm’s stock directly and
thus bypass brokers’ commissions. Exxon Mobil not only allows investors to buy
their initial shares at no fee but also lets them pick up additional shares through
automatic bank account withdrawals. Several plans, including Exxon Mobil’s,
offer dividend reinvestment for individual retirement accounts; and some allow
participants to invest weekly or monthly rather than on the quarterly dividend
schedule. With all of these plans (and many others), stockholders can invest more
than the dividends they are forgoing—they simply send a check to the company

In earlier sections, we described the theories of investor preference for dividends
and the potential effects of dividend policy on the value of a firm. We also
discussed the residual dividend model for setting a firm’s long-run target payout
ratio. In this section, we discuss several other factors that affect the dividend
decision. These factors may be grouped into four broad categories: (1) constraints
on dividend payments, (2) investment opportunities, (3) availability and cost of
alternative sources of capital, and (4) effects of dividend policy on rs. We discuss
these factors next.
14-5A CONSTRAINTS
1.
Bond indentures. Debt contracts often limit dividend payments to earnings
generated after the loan was granted. Also, debt contracts often stipulate that
no dividends can be paid unless the current ratio, times-interest-earned ratio,
and other safety ratios exceed stated minimums.
2.
Preferred stock restrictions. Typically, common dividends cannot be paid if the
company has omitted its preferred dividend. The preferred arrearages must be
satisfied before common dividends can be resumed.
3.
Impairment of capital rule. Dividend payments cannot exceed the balance sheet
item “retained earnings.” This legal restriction, known as the impairment of
capital rule, is designed to protect creditors. Without the rule, a company that
is in trouble might distribute most of its assets to stockholders and leave its
debtholders out in the cold. (Liquidating dividends can be paid out of capital;
but they must be indicated as such, and they must not reduce capital below
the limits stated in debt contracts.)
4.
Availability of cash. Cash dividends can be paid only with cash. Thus, a
shortage of cash in the bank can restrict dividend payments. However, the
ability to borrow can offset this factor.

5.
Penalty tax on improperly accumulated earnings. To prevent wealthy
individuals from using corporations to avoid personal taxes, the Tax Code
provides for a special surtax on improperly accumulated income. Thus, if
the IRS can demonstrate that a firm’s dividend payout ratio is deliberately
being held down to help its stockholders avoid personal taxes, the firm is
subject to heavy penalties. This factor is relevant primarily to privately
owned firms.
14-5B INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
1.
Number of profitable investment opportunities. As we saw in our discussion of the
residual dividend model, if a firm has a large number of profitable investment
opportunities, this will tend to produce a low target payout ratio and vice
versa if the firm has few good investment opportunities.
2.
Possibility of accelerating or delaying projects. The ability to accelerate or
postpone projects permits a firm to adhere more closely to a stable dividend
policy.
14-5C ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF CAPITAL
1.
Cost of selling new stock. If a firm needs to finance a given level of investment,
it can obtain equity by retaining earnings or by issuing new common stock.
If flotation costs (including any negative signaling effects of a stock offering)
are high, re will be well above rs, making it better to set a low payout ratio
and to finance through retention rather than through the sale of new common
stock. On the other hand, a high dividend payout ratio is more feasible for
a firm whose flotation costs are low. Flotation costs differ among firms—for
example, the flotation percentage is especially high for small firms, so they
tend to set low payout ratios.
2.
Ability to substitute debt for equity. A firm can finance a given level of
investment with debt or equity. As noted, low stock flotation costs permit a
more flexible dividend policy because equity can be raised by retaining
earnings or by selling new stock. A similar situation holds for debt policy:
If the firm can adjust its debt ratio without raising its WACC sharply, it can
pay the expected dividend, even if earnings fluctuate, by additional
borrowing.
3.
Control. If management is concerned about maintaining control, it may be
reluctant to sell new stock; hence, the company may retain more earnings than
it otherwise would. However, if stockholders want higher dividends and a
proxy fight looms, the dividend might be increased.
14-5D EFFECTS OF DIVIDEND POLICY ON rs
The effects of dividend policy on rs may be considered in terms of four factors:
(1) stockholders’ desire for current versus future income, (2) the perceived riski-
ness of dividends versus capital gains, (3) the tax advantage of capital gains, and
(4) the information (signaling) content of dividends. We discussed each of those
factors earlier, so we only note here that the importance of each factor varies from
firm to firm depending on the makeup of its current and possible future stock-
holders.
It should be apparent that dividend policy decisions are based more on
informed judgment than on quantitative analysis. Even so, to make rational
dividend decisions, financial managers must take into account all the points
discussed in the preceding sections.

14-6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND STOCK SPLITS
Stock dividends were originally used in lieu of regular cash dividends by firms
that were short of cash. Today, though, the primary purpose of stock dividends is
to increase the number of shares outstanding and thus to lower the stock’s price in
the market. Stock splits have a similar purpose.
Stock dividends and splits can be explained best through an example. We use
Porter Electronic Controls Inc., a $700 million electronic components manufac-
turer, for this purpose. Since its inception, Porter’s markets have been expanding
and the company has enjoyed growth in sales and earnings. Some of its earnings
have been paid out in dividends; but some also were retained each year, causing
its earnings per share and the stock price to grow. The company began its life with
only a few thousand shares outstanding; and, after some years of growth, each of
Porter’s shares had a very high EPS and DPS. When a “normal” P E ratio was
applied, the resulting market price was so high that few people could afford to
buy a “round lot” of 100 shares. This limited demand for the stock and thus kept
the firm’s total market value below what it would have been if more shares at a
lower price had been outstanding. To correct this situation, Porter “split its stock,”
as described in the next section.
14-6A STOCK SPLITS
Although there is little empirical evidence to support the contention, there is
nevertheless a widespread belief in financial circles that an optimal price range
exists for stocks. Optimal means that if the price is within this range, the
price/earnings ratio (and hence the firm’s value) will be maximized. Many
observers, including Porter’s management, believe that the best range for most
stocks is from $20 to $80 per share. Accordingly, if the price of Porter’s stock rose
to $80, management would probably declare a two-for-one stock split, thus
doubling the number of shares outstanding, halving the earnings and dividends
per share, and thereby lowering the stock price. Each stockholder would have
more shares, but each share would be worth less. In Yogi Berra’s terms (refer to
the feature box “Yogi Berra on the MM Proposition” in Chapter 13), a stock split
just divides the corporate value pie into more slices. If the post-split price was
$40, Porter’s stockholders would be exactly as well off as they were before the
split. However, if the stock price stabilized above $40, stockholders would be
better off. Stock splits can be split in varying proportions—for example, the stock
can be split two-for-one, three-for-one, one-and-a-half-for-one, or any other way.14

14Reverse splits, which reduce the shares outstanding, also can be used. For example, a company whose
stock sells for $5 might employ a one-for-five reverse split, exchanging one new share for five old ones
and raising the value of the shares to about $25, which is within the optimal price range. LTV
Corporation did this after several years of losses had driven its stock price below the optimal range.

An action taken by a firm
to increase the number of
shares outstanding, such
as doubling the number of
shares outstanding by
giving each stockholder
two new shares for each
one formerly held.

14-6B STOCK DIVIDENDS
Stock dividends are similar to stock splits because they “divide the pie into smaller
slices” without affecting the fundamental position of the current stockholders. On a
5% stock dividend, the holder of 100 shares would receive an additional 5 shares
(without cost); on a 20% stock dividend, the same holder would receive 20 new
shares; and so forth. Again, the total number of shares is increased; so, holding all
other things constant, earnings, dividends, and price per share all decline.
If a firm wants to reduce its stock price, should it use a stock split or a stock
dividend? Stock splits are generally used after a sharp price run-up to produce a
large price reduction. Stock dividends used on a regular annual basis keep the
stock price more or less constrained. For example, if a firm’s earnings and divi-
dends were growing at about 10% per year, its stock price would tend to increase
at about that same rate and it would soon be outside the desired trading range. A
10% annual stock dividend would maintain the stock price within the optimal
trading range. Note, however, that because small stock dividends create book-
keeping problems and unnecessary expenses, firms use stock splits far more often
than stock dividends.15
14-6C EFFECT ON STOCK PRICES
If a company splits its stock or declares a stock dividend, will this increase the
market value of its stock? Several empirical studies have addressed this question.
Here is a summary of their findings.16
1.
On average, the price of a company’s stock rises shortly after it announces a
stock split or dividend.
2.
One reason that stock splits and stock dividends may lead to higher prices is
that investors often take stock splits and dividends as signals of higher future
earnings. Because only companies whose managements believe that things
look good tend to split their stocks, the announcement of a stock split is taken
as a signal that earnings and cash dividends are likely to rise. Thus, the price
increases associated with stock splits and dividends may be the result of a
favorable signal for earnings and dividends.
3.
If a company announces a stock split or dividend, its price will tend to rise.
However, if during the next few months it does not announce an increase in
earnings and dividends, the stock price generally will drop back to the earlier
level. This supports the signaling effect discussed earlier.
4.
By creating more shares and lowering the stock price, stock splits may also
increase the stock’s liquidity. This tends to increase the firm’s value.
15Accountants treat stock splits and stock dividends somewhat differently. For example, in a two-for-
one stock split, the number of shares outstanding is doubled and the par value is halved, and that is
about all there is to it. With a stock dividend, a bookkeeping entry is made transferring “retained
earnings” to “common stock.” For example, if a firm had 1,000,000 shares outstanding, if the stock
price was $10, and if it wanted to pay a 10% stock dividend, (1) each stockholder would be given 1 new
share of stock for each 10 shares held and (2) the accounting entries would involve showing 100,000
more shares outstanding and transferring 100,000($10) = $1,000,000 from “retained earnings” to
“common stock.” The retained earnings transfer limits the size of stock dividends, but that is not
important because companies can split their stock any way they choose.

5.
There is evidence that stock splits change the mix of shareholders. The
proportion of trades made by individual investors tends to increase after a
stock split, whereas the proportion of trades made by institutional investors
tends to fall. We are not sure how this affects the stock’s value.
What do we conclude from these findings? From a pure economic standpoint, stock
dividends and splits are just additional pieces of paper. However, they provide
management with a relatively low-cost way of signaling that the firm’s prospects
look good. Further, we should note that few large, publicly owned stocks sell at
prices above several hundred dollars; therefore, we simply do not know what the
effect would be if, for example, Chevron, Microsoft, Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, and
other highly successful firms had never split their stocks and consequently sold at
prices in the thousands or even millions of dollars per share.
A recent Bloomberg Businessweek article notes that stock splits have become a
lot less popular in recent years. The article suggests that one possible reason for
this shift is that individual investors have increasingly moved from buying shares
of individual companies and have instead navigated towards mutual funds.
Consequently, institutional investors (such as mutual funds) have become rela-
tively more important. These institutional investors are less concerned about
whether a stock’s price is above or below a particular range, and they are less
likely to value stock splits.17
Finally, it is worth pointing out that Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of
Berkshire Hathaway, had long resisted the use of stock splits but he shifted gears
in early 2010. After Berkshire Hathaway acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe,
the company announced a 50-for-one split for its Class B shares. Prior to the
announcement, the stock traded around $3,500 per share. After the split, the stock
traded around $70 per share.
14-7 STOCK REPURCHASES
Several years ago, a Fortune article entitled “Beating the Market by Buying Back
Stock” reported that during a one-year period, more than 600 major corporations
repurchased significant amounts of their own stock. It also gave illustrations of
some specific companies’ repurchase programs and the effects of these programs

Suppose you have 100 common shares of Tillman Industries. The EPS is $4.00,

two-for-one split. Immediately after the split, how many shares will you have,
what will be the adjusted EPS and DPS, and what would you expect the stock
price to be? (200 shares; $2.00; $1.00; probably a little over $30)

on stock prices. The article’s conclusion was that “buybacks have made a mint for
shareholders who stay with the companies carrying them out.”
More recently, as we noted in the opening vignette, Apple Inc. has established
a quarterly dividend and has repurchased shares of its common stock. Apple’s
recent actions are part of a larger trend in which many leading companies have
repurchased stock. How do stock repurchase programs work, and why have they
become so prevalent over the past several years? We discuss these questions in the
remainder of this section.
There are three principal types of stock repurchases: (1) situations where the
firm has cash available for distribution to its stockholders, and it distributes this
cash by repurchasing shares rather than by paying cash dividends, (2) situations
where the firm concludes that its capital structure is too heavily weighted with
equity, and it sells debt and uses the proceeds to buy back its stock, and (3) situa-
tions where the firm has issued options to employees, and it uses open market
repurchases to obtain stock for use when the options are exercised.
Stock that has been repurchased by a firm is called treasury stock. If some of the
outstanding stock is repurchased, fewer shares will remain outstanding. Assuming
that the repurchase does not adversely affect the firm’s future earnings, the earnings
per share on the remaining shares will increase, resulting in a higher market price
per share. As a result, capital gains will have been substituted for dividends.
14-7A THE EFFECTS OF STOCK REPURCHASES
Many companies have been repurchasing their stock in recent years. As men-
tioned in the opening vignette, in 2013, Apple announced plans for a $60 billion
stock repurchase that would take place over a number of years. The Wall Street
Journal recently reported that between 2006 and early 2013, DirecTV has repur-
chased 57% of its shares, which is the highest proportion of shares repurchased
among the stocks in the S&P 500 over this time period.18 In the past, other large
repurchases have been made by Procter & Gamble, Dell, Home Depot, Texas
Instruments, IBM, Coca-Cola, Teledyne, Atlantic Richfield, Goodyear, and Xerox.
In fact, share repurchases in 2012 totaled $384 3 billion for S&P 500 companies.
The effects of a repurchase can be illustrated with data on American Devel-
opment Corporation (ADC). The company expects to earn $4 4 million in 2014,
and it plans to use 50% of this amount (or $2 2 million) to repurchase shares of its
common stock. There are 1.1 million shares outstanding, and the market price is
$20 a share. ADC believes that it can use the $2 2 million to repurchase 110,000 of
its shares at the current price of $20 per share.19
The effect of the repurchase on the EPS and market price per share of the
remaining stock can be analyzed as follows:
18Refer to Vipal Monga, “DirecTV Tops in Buying Back Stock Since 2006,” The Wall Street Journal
(online.wsj.com), May 9, 2013.
19Stock repurchases are generally made in one of three ways: (1) A publicly owned firm can simply buy
its own stock through a broker on the open market. (2) It can make a tender offer, under which it permits
stockholders to send in (that is, “tender”) their shares to the firm in exchange for a specified price per
share. In this case, the firm generally indicates that it will buy up to a specified number of shares within
a particular time period (usually about 2 weeks); if more shares are tendered than the company wants
to purchase, purchases are made on a pro rata basis. (3) The firm can purchase a block of shares from
one large holder on a negotiated basis. If a negotiated purchase is employed, care must be taken to
ensure that this one stockholder does not receive preferential treatment over other stockholders, or that
any preference given can be justified by “sound business reasons.” A number of years ago Texaco’s
management was sued by stockholders who were unhappy over the company’s repurchase of about
$600 million of stock from the Bass Brothers at a substantial premium over the market price. The suit
charged that Texaco’s management, afraid the Bass Brothers would attempt a takeover, used the
buyback to “get them off its back.” Such payments have been dubbed greenmail.

It should be noted from this example that we assumed that the shares were repur-
chased at the current stock price of $20 per share. In this example, the company’s EPS
increased, but there was a corresponding drop in its P E ratio. One reason the P E
ratio may drop is that the repurchase works to increase the company’s debt ratio
(as there are now fewer shares of stock outstanding). Because of the higher debt ratio,
shareholders may consider the stock to be riskier. As a result, the future earnings are
discounted at a higher rate, which reduces the P E ratio.
In reality, companies often have to pay a premium in order to get shareholders
to sell their shares back to the company. If instead, ADC had to pay $22 per share to
repurchase the stock, it would only be able to repurchase 100,000 shares. In this
case, the EPS would be somewhat lower ($4 40
$4 4 million 1 million shares),
and the P E ratio would again be 5 0 . (This assumes that the market price of the
stock remains at $22 following the repurchase.)
For a variety of reasons, the stock’s price might change as a result of the
repurchase operation, rising if investors viewed it favorably and falling if they
viewed it unfavorably. Some of these factors are considered next.
14-7B ADVANTAGES OF REPURCHASES
The advantages of repurchases are as follows:
1.
A repurchase announcement may be viewed as a positive signal by investors
because repurchases are often motivated by managements’ belief that their
firms’ shares are undervalued.
2.
The stockholders have a choice when the firm distributes cash by
repurchasing stock—they can sell or not sell. With a cash dividend, on the
other hand, stockholders must accept a dividend payment and pay the tax.
Thus, those stockholders who need cash can sell back some of their shares,
while those who do not want additional cash can simply retain their stock.
From a tax standpoint, a repurchase permits both types of stockholders to get
what they want.
3.
A repurchase can remove a large block of stock that is “overhanging” the
market and keeping the price per share down.
4.
Dividends are “sticky” in the short run because managements are reluctant to
raise the dividend if the increase cannot be maintained in the future—
managements dislike cutting cash dividends because of the negative signal a
cut gives. Therefore, if excess cash flows are expected to be temporary,
managements may prefer to make distributions as share repurchases rather
than to declare increased cash dividends that cannot be maintained.
5.
Companies can use the residual dividend model to set a target cash
distribution level, then divide the distribution into a dividend component and a
repurchase component. The dividend payout ratio will be relatively low; but the
dividend itself will be relatively secure, and it will grow as a result of the
declining number of shares outstanding. This gives the company more
flexibility in adjusting the total distribution than if the entire distribution were
in the form of cash dividends because repurchases can be varied from year to
year without sending adverse signals. This procedure has much to
recommend it, and it is an important reason for the dramatic increase in the

volume of share repurchases. IBM, NextEra Energy (formerly FPL Group),
Walmart, and most other large companies use repurchases in this manner.
6.
Repurchases can be used to produce large-scale changes in capital structure. For
example, a number of years ago Consolidated Edison decided that its debt ratio
was so low that it was not minimizing its WACC. It then borrowed $400 million
and used the funds to repurchase shares of its common stock. This resulted in
an immediate shift from a nonoptimal to an optimal capital structure.
7.
Companies that use stock options as an important component of employee
compensation can repurchase shares and then reissue those shares when
employees exercise their options. This avoids having to issue new shares,
which dilutes earnings per share. Microsoft and other high-tech companies
have used this procedure in recent years.
14-7C DISADVANTAGES OF REPURCHASES
Disadvantages of repurchases include the following:
1.
Stockholders may not be indifferent between dividends and capital gains, and
the stock price might benefit more from cash dividends than from repurchases.
Cash dividends are generally dependable, but repurchases are not.
2.
The selling stockholders may not be fully aware of all the implications of a
repurchase, or they may not have all the pertinent information about the
corporation’s present and future activities. This is especially true in situations
where management has good reason to believe that the stock price is well
below its intrinsic value. However, firms generally announce repurchase
programs before embarking on them to avoid potential stockholder suits.
3.
The corporation may pay too high a price for the repurchased stock, to the
disadvantage of remaining stockholders. If its shares are not actively traded
and if the firm seeks to acquire a relatively large number of shares of its stock,
the price may be bid above its intrinsic value and then fall after the firm ceases
its repurchase operations.
14-7D CONCLUSIONS ON STOCK REPURCHASES
When all the pros and cons on stock repurchases have been totaled, where do we
stand? Our conclusions may be summarized as follows:
1.
Because of the deferred tax on capital gains, repurchases have a tax advantage
over dividends as a way to distribute income to stockholders. This advantage
is reinforced by the fact that repurchases provide cash to stockholders who
want cash but also allow those who do not need current cash to delay its
receipt. On the other hand, dividends are more dependable and are thus better
suited for those who need a steady source of income.
2.
Because of signaling effects, companies should not pay fluctuating dividends—
that would lower investors’ confidence in the company and adversely affect its
cost of equity and its stock price. However, cash flows vary over time, as do
investment opportunities; so the “proper” dividend in the residual dividend
model sense varies. To get around this problem, a company can set its dividend
at a level low enough to keep dividend payments from constraining operations
and then use repurchases on a more or less regular basis to distribute excess
cash. Such a procedure would provide regular, dependable dividends in
addition to supplemental cash flows to those stockholders who want it.
3.
Repurchases are also useful when a firm wants to make a large, rapid shift in
its capital structure, to distribute cash from a one-time event such as the sale of
a division, or to obtain shares for use in an employee stock option plan.

In earlier editions of this book, we argued that companies ought to be doing more
repurchasing and distributing less cash as dividends. Increases in the size and
frequency of repurchases in recent years suggest that companies have finally
reached this same conclusion.
Once a company becomes profitable, it must decide what to do with the cash it
generates. It may choose to retain cash and use it to purchase additional operating
assets, to repay outstanding debt, or to acquire other companies. Alternatively, it may
choose to return cash to shareholders. Keep in mind that every dollar that manage-
ment chooses to retain is a dollar that shareholders could have received and invested
elsewhere. Therefore, managers should retain earnings if and only if they can invest
the money within the firm, and earn more than stockholders can earn outside the firm.
Consequently, high-growth companies with many good projects tend to retain a high
percentage of their earnings, whereas mature companies with a great deal of cash but
limited investment opportunities tend to have generous cash distribution policies.

ALTERNATIVE DIVIDEND POLICIES
Components Manufacturing Corporation (CMC) has
an all-common-equity capital structure. It has 200,000 shares of $2 par value common stock
outstanding. When CMC’s founder, who was also its research director and most successful
inventor, retired unexpectedly to the South Pacific in late 2014, CMC was left suddenly and
permanently with materially lower growth expectations and relatively few attractive new
investment opportunities. Unfortunately, there was no way to replace the founder’s con-
tributions to the firm. Previously, CMC found it necessary to reinvest most of its earnings to
finance growth, which averaged 12% per year. Future growth at a 6% rate is considered
realistic, but that level would call for an increase in the dividend payout. Further, it now
appears that new investment projects, with at least the 14% rate of return required by
CMC’s stockholders (rs
14%), would total only $800,000 for 2015, compared to a pro-
jected net income of $2,000,000. If the existing 20% dividend payout was continued,
retained earnings would be $1 6 million in 2015; but as noted, only $800,000 of investments
would yield the 14% cost of capital.
The one encouraging point is that the high earnings from existing assets are expected
to continue, and net income of $2 million is still expected for 2015. Given the dramatically
changed circumstances, CMC’s management is reviewing the firm’s dividend policy.
a. Assuming that the acceptable 2015 investment projects would be financed entirely by
earnings retained during the year, and assuming that CMC uses the residual dividend
model, calculate DPS in 2015.
b. What payout ratio does your answer to Part a imply for 2015?
c. If a 60% payout ratio is maintained for the foreseeable future, what is your estimate
of the present market price for the common stock? How does this compare with the
market price that should have prevailed under the assumptions existing just before
the news about the founder’s retirement? If the two values of P0 are different, comment
on why they are different.
d. What would happen to the stock price if the old 20% payout was continued? Assume
that if this payout is maintained, the average rate of return on the retained earnings will
fall to 7 5% and the new growth rate will be as follows:
g
1 0
Payout ratio ROE
1 0
0 2 7 5%
0 8 7 5%
6 0%
QUESTIONS
14-1
Discuss the pros and cons of having the directors formally announce a firm’s future
dividend policy.
14-2
The cost of retained earnings is less than the cost of new outside equity capital. Conse-
quently, it is totally irrational for a firm to sell a new issue of stock and to pay cash
dividends during the same year. Discuss the meaning of those statements.
14-3
Would it ever be rational for a firm to borrow money in order to pay cash dividends? Explain.
14-4
Modigliani and Miller (MM) on the one hand and Gordon and Lintner (GL) on the other
hand have expressed strong views regarding the effect of dividend policy on a firm’s cost of
capital and value.
a.
In essence, what are MM’s and GL’s views regarding the effect of dividend policy on
the cost of capital and stock prices?
b.
How could MM use the information content, or signaling, hypothesis to counter their
opponents’ arguments? If you were debating MM, how would you counter them?
c.
How could MM use the clientele effect concept to counter their opponents’ arguments?
If you were debating MM, how would you counter them?

14-5
How would each of the following changes tend to affect aggregate (that is, the average for
all corporations) payout ratios, other things held constant? Explain your answers.
a.
An increase in the personal income tax rate
b.
A liberalization of depreciation for federal income tax purposes—that is, faster tax
write-offs
c.
An increase in interest rates
d.
An increase in corporate profits
e.
A decline in investment opportunities
f.
Permission for corporations to deduct dividends for tax purposes as they now deduct
interest expense
g.
A change in the Tax Code so that realized and unrealized long-term capital gains in
any year are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income
14-6
One position expressed in the financial literature is that firms set their dividends as a
residual after using income to support new investment.
a.
Explain what a residual dividend policy implies, illustrating your answer with a table
showing how different investment opportunities can lead to different dividend payout
ratios.
b.
Think back to Chapter 13 where we considered the relationship between capital structure
and the cost of capital. If the WACC-versus-debt-ratio plot was shaped like a sharp V,
would this have a different implication for the importance of setting dividends according
to the residual policy than if the plot was shaped like a shallow bowl (a flattened U)?
14-7
Executive salaries have been shown to be more closely correlated to the size of the firm than
to its profitability. If a firm’s board of directors is controlled by management rather than
outside directors, this might result in the firm’s retaining more earnings than can be justified
from the stockholders’ point of view. Discuss those statements, being sure (1) to discuss the
interrelationships among cost of capital, investment opportunities, and new investment and
(2) to explain the implied relationship between dividend policy and stock prices.
14-8
What is the difference between a stock dividend and a stock split? As a stockholder, would
you prefer to see your company declare a 100% stock dividend or a two-for-one split?
Assume that either action is feasible.
14-9
Most firms like to have their stock selling at a high P E ratio, and they also like to have
extensive public ownership (many different shareholders). Explain how stock dividends or
stock splits may help achieve those goals.
14-10
Indicate whether the following statements are true or false. If the statement is false,
explain why.
a.
If a firm repurchases its stock in the open market, the shareholders who tender the
stock are subject to capital gains taxes.
b.
If you own 100 shares in a company’s stock and the company’s stock splits 2-for-l, you
will own 200 shares in the company following the split.
c.
Some dividend reinvestment plans increase the amount of equity capital available to
the firm.
d.
The Tax Code encourages companies to pay a large percentage of their net income in
the form of dividends.
e.
If your company has established a clientele of investors who prefer large dividends, the
company is unlikely to adopt a residual dividend policy.
f.
If a firm follows a residual dividend policy, holding all else constant, its dividend
payout will tend to rise whenever the firm’s investment opportunities improve.
14-11
What is meant by catering theory, and how might it impact a firm’s dividend policy?

Axel Telecommunications has a target capital structure that
consists of 70% debt and 30% equity. The company anticipates that its capital budget for the
upcoming year will be $3,000,000. If Axel reports net income of $2,000,000 and it follows a
residual dividend payout policy, what will be its dividend payout ratio?

EXTERNAL EQUITY FINANCING
Northern Pacific Heating and Cooling Inc. has a 6-month
backlog of orders for its patented solar heating system. To meet this demand, management
plans to expand production capacity by 40% with a $10 million investment in plant and
machinery. The firm wants to maintain a 40% debt level in its capital structure. It also
wants to maintain its past dividend policy of distributing 45% of last year’s net income. In
2014, net income was $5 million. How much external equity must Northern Pacific seek at
the beginning of 2015 to expand capacity as desired? Assume that the firm uses only debt
and common equity in its capital structure.
14-6
RESIDUAL DIVIDEND MODEL
Welch Company is considering three independent projects,
each of which requires a $5 million investment. The estimated internal rate of return (IRR)
and cost of capital for these projects are presented here:
Project H (high risk):
Cost of capital = 16%
IRR = 20%
Project M (medium risk):
Cost of capital = 12%
IRR = 10%
Project L (low risk):
Cost of capital = 8%
IRR = 9%
Note that the projects’ costs of capital vary because the projects have different levels of risk.
The company’s optimal capital structure calls for 50% debt and 50% common equity, and it
expects to have net income of $7,287,500. If Welch establishes its dividends from the
residual dividend model, what will be its payout ratio?

trades at $48 per share.
a.
The company had a 40% dividend payout ratio in 2013. If Bowles wants to maintain
this payout ratio in 2014, what will be its per-share dividend in 2014?
b.
If the company maintains this 40% payout ratio, what will be the current dividend
yield on the company’s stock?

The company reported net income of $1 5 million in 2013. Assume that the number of
shares outstanding has remained constant. What was the company’s per-share
dividend in 2013?
d.
As an alternative to maintaining the same dividend payout ratio, Bowles is considering
maintaining the same per-share dividend in 2014 that it paid in 2013. If it chooses this
policy, what will be the company’s dividend payout ratio in 2014?
e.
Assume that the company is interested in dramatically expanding its operations and
that this expansion will require significant amounts of capital. The company would like
to avoid transactions costs involved in issuing new equity. Given this scenario, would
it make more sense for the company to maintain a constant dividend payout ratio or to
maintain the same per-share dividend? Explain.

ALTERNATIVE DIVIDEND POLICIES
Rubenstein Bros. Clothing is expecting to pay an
annual dividend per share of $0 75 out of annual earnings per share of $2 25. Currently,
Rubenstein Bros.’ stock is selling for $12 50 per share. Adhering to the company’s target
capital structure, the firm has $10 million in total invested capital, of which 40% is funded
by debt. Assume that the firm’s book value of equity equals its market value. In past years,
the firm has earned a return on equity (ROE) of 18%, which is expected to continue this year
and into the foreseeable future.
a.
Based on this information, what long-run growth rate can the firm be expected to
maintain? (Hint: g
Retention rate
ROE.)
b.
What is the stock’s required return?
c.
If the firm changed its dividend policy and paid an annual dividend of $1 50 per share,
financial analysts would predict that the change in policy will have no effect on the
firm’s stock price or ROE. Therefore, what must be the firm’s new expected long-run
growth rate and required return?
d.
Suppose instead that the firm has decided to proceed with its original plan of
disbursing $0 75 per share to shareholders, but the firm intends to do so in the form of
a stock dividend rather than a cash dividend. The firm will allot new shares based on
the current stock price of $12 50. In other words, for every $12 50 in dividends due
to shareholders, a share of stock will be issued. How large will the stock dividend
be relative to the firm’s current market capitalization? (Hint: Remember that

ALTERNATIVE DIVIDEND POLICIES
In 2013, Keenan Company paid dividends totaling
$3,600,000 on net income of $10.8 million. Note that 2013 was a normal year and that for the
past 10 years, earnings have grown at a constant rate of 10%. However, in 2014, earnings are
expected to jump to $14 4 million and the firm expects to have profitable investment oppor-
tunities of $8 4 million. It is predicted that Keenan will not be able to maintain the 2014 level of
earnings growth because the high 2014 earnings level is attributable to an exceptionally
profitable new product line introduced that year. After 2014, the company will return to its
previous 10% growth rate. Keenan’s target capital structure is 40% debt and 60% equity.
a.
Calculate Keenan’s total dividends for 2014 assuming that it follows each of the
following policies:
1. Its 2014 dividend payment is set to force dividends to grow at the long-run growth
rate in earnings.
2. It continues the 2013 dividend payout ratio.
3. It uses a pure residual dividend policy (40% of the $8 4 million investment is
financed with debt and 60% with common equity).
4. It employs a regular-dividend-plus-extras policy, with the regular dividend being
based on the long-run growth rate and the extra dividend being set according to the
residual dividend policy.
b.
Which of the preceding policies would you recommend? Restrict your choices to the
ones listed but justify your answer.
c.
Assume that investors expect Keenan to pay total dividends of $9,000,000 in 2014
and to have the dividend grow at 10% after 2014. The stock’s total market value is

RESIDUAL DIVIDEND MODEL
Buena Terra Corporation is reviewing its capital budget for
the upcoming year. It has paid a $3 00 dividend per share (DPS) for the past several years,
and its shareholders expect the dividend to remain constant for the next several years. The
company’s target capital structure is 60% equity and 40% debt, it has 1,000,000 shares of
common equity outstanding, and its net income is $8 million. The company forecasts that it
will require $10 million to fund all of its profitable (that is, positive NPV) projects for the
upcoming year.

a. If Buena Terra follows the residual dividend model, how much retained earnings will it
need to fund its capital budget?
b. If Buena Terra follows the residual dividend model, what will be the company’s
dividend per share and payout ratio for the upcoming year?
c. If Buena Terra maintains its current $3 00 DPS for next year, how much retained
earnings will be available for the firm’s capital budget?
d. Can the company maintain its current capital structure, the $3 00 DPS, and a $10 million
capital budget without having to raise new common stock?
e. Suppose that Buena Terra’s management is firmly opposed to cutting the dividend; that
is, it wants to maintain the $3 00 dividend for the next year. Also, assume that the
company was committed to funding all profitable projects and was willing to issue more
debt (along with the available retained earnings) to help finance the company’s capital
budget. Assume that the resulting change in capital structure has a minimal effect on the
company’s composite cost of capital so that the capital budget remains at $10 million.
What portion of this year’s capital budget would have to be financed with debt?
f. Suppose once again that Buena Terra’s management wants to maintain the $3 00 DPS.
In addition, the company wants to maintain its target capital structure (60% equity and
40% debt) and its $10 million capital budget. What is the minimum dollar amount of
new common stock that the company would have to issue to meet each of its objectives?
g. Now consider the case where Buena Terra’s management wants to maintain the $3 00
DPS and its target capital structure, but it wants to avoid issuing new common stock.
The company is willing to cut its capital budget to meet its other objectives. Assuming
that the company’s projects are divisible, what will be the company’s capital budget for
the next year?
h. What actions can a firm that follows the residual dividend model take when its
forecasted retained earnings are less than the retained earnings required to fund its
capital budget?
SOUTHEASTERN STEEL COMPANY
14-11
DIVIDEND POLICY
Southeastern Steel Company (SSC) was formed 5 years ago to exploit a new
continuous casting process. SSC’s founders, Donald Brown and Margo Valencia, had been employed
in the research department of a major integrated-steel company; but when that company decided against
using the new process (which Brown and Valencia had developed), they decided to strike out on their
own. One advantage of the new process was that it required relatively little capital compared to the
typical steel company, so Brown and Valencia have been able to avoid issuing new stock and thus own
all of the shares. However, SSC has now reached the stage in which outside equity capital is necessary if
the firm is to achieve its growth targets yet still maintain its target capital structure of 60% equity and
40% debt. Therefore, Brown and Valencia have decided to take the company public. Until now, Brown
and Valencia have paid themselves reasonable salaries but routinely reinvested all after-tax earnings in
the firm; so the firm’s dividend policy has not been an issue. However, before talking with potential
outside investors, they must decide on a dividend policy.
Assume that you were recently hired by Arthur Adamson & Company (AA), a national consulting
firm, which has been asked to help SSC prepare for its public offering. Martha Millon, the senior AA
consultant in your group, has asked you to make a presentation to Brown and Valencia in which you
review the theory of dividend policy and discuss the following questions:
a. 1. What is meant by the term dividend policy?
2. Explain briefly the dividend irrelevance theory that was put forward by Modigliani and Miller.
What were the key assumptions underlying their theory?
3. Why do some investors prefer high-dividend-paying stocks, while other investors prefer stocks
that pay low or nonexistent dividends?

APPLE’S DIVIDEND POLICY
In this chapter’s opening vignette, we discussed Apple’s decision to establish a dividend payout policy in
2012. Let’s find out what has happened to Apple’s (AAPL) dividend policy since the time of this
announcement. We can address this issue by relying on data provided in Thomson ONE.
Discussion Questions

To get information about Apple’s dividend policy, enter its ticker quote (AAPL) and select OVERVIEW > FULL
REPORTS > THOMSON FULL REPORTS > FULL COMPANY REPORT. On the next screen, click on STOCK &
EARNINGS DATA and scroll down to the “Annual Historical Data” section. What has happened to Apple’s dividend
per share, dividend yield, and dividend payout over the past 5 years? Provide an explanation for what took place.

Compare this information with other firms in the same industry. To see how Apple stacks up against its peers, select
COMPARABLES
OVERVIEWS
PER SHARE DATA to get Apple’s peers’ last annual dividends. Accessing
COMPARABLES>OVERVIEWS>ABSOLUTE RANKINGS will give their dividend yields. You can also get this
information from the VALUATION COMPARISON in the OVERVIEWS section. Has Apple behaved differently from
its peers, or have there been industry-wide shifts?
3.
Refer back to the FULL COMPANY REPORT used in Question 1. Manually plot earnings per share, dividends
per share, and cash flow per share over time. In the text, we point out that dividends are often more stable than
earnings, that cash flows track earnings very closely, and that cash flow per share exceeds dividends per share by
a safe margin. Do you see a similar pattern for Apple? Explain.

Explain the significance of those dates. Go back to OVERVIEW and access the “Interactive Price Chart.” Can you
observe price shifts around these dates? Explain what price shifts you might expect to see.
5.
Investors are more concerned with future dividends than historical dividends, so go to ESTIMATES and scroll
down to the “Consensus Estimates” on the screen. Click on the “Available Measures” menu to toggle between
earnings per share and dividends per share. How do analysts expect Apple’s payout policy to behave in the
future?
6.
Go back to OVERVIEW > FULL REPORTS > THOMSON FULL REPORTS > STOCK SECTION. Scroll
down to the “Annual Historical Data” section. Has Apple been repurchasing stock, or has it been issuing new
stock? What has happened to its year-end market capitalization over this 5-year period?

Successful Firms Efficiently Manage Their Working Capital
Working capital management involves finding
the optimal levels for cash, marketable securi-
ties, accounts receivable, and inventory, and
then financing that working capital at the least
cost. Effective working capital management can
generate considerable amounts of cash.
As any small business person can tell you,
one way to generate cash is to have your cus-
tomers pay you more quickly than you pay your
suppliers. Recognizing this point on a much
larger scale, Dell and Amazon have created
strong competitive advantages through their
effective use of working capital management.
When customers order computers from Dell’s
website or order books online from Amazon
they must provide a credit card number. Dell
and Amazon then receive next-day cash, even
before the product is shipped and before they
have paid their suppliers.
Another key component of working capital
management is efficient inventory usage. Over
the years, Dell has created a state-of-the-art
model for inventory management. Other com-
panies, such as Best Buy, the large consumer
electronics retailer, pay particular attention to
inventories. To maintain sales, its stores must
be well stocked with the goods customers are
seeking at the time they are shopping. This
involves determining what new products are
hot, finding where they can be obtained at the
lowest cost, and delivering them to stores in a
timely manner. Dramatic improvements in com-
munications and computer technology have
transformed the way Best Buy manages its
inventories. It now collects real-time data from
each store on how each product is selling, and
its computers place orders automatically to
keep the shelves full. Moreover, if sales of an

item are slipping, prices are lowered to reduce stocks of that
item before the situation deteriorates to the point that drastic
price cuts are necessary.
Working capital management has become particularly
difficult in the declining economic environment following
the recent financial crisis. Some companies have been stuck
with unused inventory, while others are reluctant to purchase
additional inventory until they see clear evidence that con-
sumer spending has rebounded. Still other companies have
found it more difficult to obtain short-term loans from financial
institutions, so they have increasingly relied on trade credit
from their suppliers as a substitute form of financing. At the
same time, many suppliers are faced with a dilemma—in order
to generate new sales they find it necessary to provide their
customers with generous payment terms—but in doing so,
they worry that in a weak economy many of these customers
may not be able to pay them back in a timely fashion.
As you can see, effective working capital management is
a continual balancing act that has an important influence on
the company’s value. After studying this chapter, you should
understand how working capital should be managed so as to
maximize profits and stock prices.
About 50% of the typical industrial or retail firm’s assets are held as working capital,
and many students’ first jobs focus on working capital management. This is particularly
true in smaller businesses, where the majority of new jobs are being created.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Explain how different amounts of current assets and current liabilities affect firms’
profitability and thus their stock prices.
•
Explain how companies decide on the proper amount of each current asset—cash,
marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory.
•
Discuss how the cash conversion cycle is determined, how the cash budget is
constructed, and how each is used in working capital management.
•
Discuss how companies set their credit policies, and explain the effect of credit policy
on sales and profits.
•
Describe how the costs of trade credit, bank loans, and commercial paper are
determined, and how that information impacts decisions for financing working
capital.
•
Explain how companies use security to lower their costs of short-term credit.
15-1 BACKGROUND ON WORKING CAPITAL
The term working capital originated with the old Yankee peddler who would load up his
wagon and go off to peddle his wares. The merchandise was called “working capital”
because it was what he actually sold, or “turned over,” to produce his profits. The
wagon and horse were his fixed assets. He generally owned the horse and wagon
(so they were financed with “equity” capital), but he bought his merchandise on credit
(that is, by borrowing from his supplier) or with money borrowed from a bank. Those
loans were called working capital loans, and they had to be repaid after each trip to
demonstrate that the peddler was solvent and worthy of a new loan. Banks that
followed this procedure were said to be employing “sound banking practices.” The
more trips the peddler took per year, the faster his working capital turned over and
the greater his profits.

This concept can be applied to modern businesses, as we demonstrate in this
chapter. We begin with a review of three basic definitions that were first covered
in Chapter 3:
1.
Working capital. Current assets are often called working capital because these
assets “turn over” (i.e., are used and then replaced during the year).1
2.
Net working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Recall
from Chapter 3 that Allied Food Products has $690 million in net working
capital:
Net working capital
Current assets −Current liabilities
$1,000 −$310
$690 million
3.
Net operating working capital (NOWC) represents the working capital that
is used for operating purposes. As we saw in Chapters 9 and 12, NOWC is an
important component of the firm’s free cash flow. NOWC differs from net
working capital because interest-bearing notes payable are deducted from
current liabilities in the calculation of NOWC. The reason for this distinction is
that most analysts view interest-bearing notes payable as a financing cost
(similar to long-term debt) that is not part of the company’s operating free
cash flows. In contrast, the other current liabilities (accounts payable and
accruals) are treated as part of the company’s operations, and therefore are
included as part of free cash flow.2 Once again, here is the 2014 net operating
working capital for Allied Food Products, the firm we discussed in Chapter 3:

15-2 CURRENT ASSETS INVESTMENT POLICIES
In this section, we discuss how the amount of current assets held affects
profitability. To begin, Figure 15.1 shows three alternative policies regarding
the size of current asset holdings. The top line has the steepest slope, which
indicates that the firm holds a great deal of cash, marketable securities,
receivables, and inventories relative to its sales. When receivables are high,

How did the term working capital originate?
Differentiate between working capital and net working capital.
Differentiate between net working capital and net operating working capital.
1Any current assets not used in normal operations, such as excess cash held to pay for a plant under
construction, are deducted and thus not included in working capital. Allied Food Products uses all of
its current assets in operations.
2As we mentioned in Chapter 3, our definition of net operating working capital assumes that all of the
company’s current assets are used for normal operating purposes. In practice, if a financial analyst
believes that some of the current assets are held for nonoperating purposes, they would be subtracted
from the company’s current assets when calculating net operating working capital. The most common
case occurs when a company holds large amounts of “excess cash” on its balance sheet. To help
simplify things, throughout this text we assume that all cash on the balance sheet is held for operating
purposes unless stated otherwise.

the firm has a liberal credit policy, which results in a high level of accounts
receivable. This is a relaxed investment policy. On the other hand, when a
firm has a restricted (or tight or “lean-and-mean”) investment policy, holdings
of current assets are minimized. A moderate investment policy lies between
the two extremes.
We can use the DuPont equation to demonstrate how working capital man-
agement affects ROE:
ROE
Profit margin
Total assets turnover
Equity multiplier
Net income
Sales
Sales
Assets
Assets
Equity
A restricted (lean-and-mean) policy indicates a low level of assets (hence, a high
total assets turnover ratio), which results in a high ROE, other things held con-
stant. However, this policy also exposes the firm to risks because shortages can
lead to work stoppages, unhappy customers, and serious long-run problems. The
relaxed policy minimizes such operating problems; but it results in a low turnover,
which in turn lowers ROE. The moderate policy falls between the two extremes.
The optimal strategy is the one that maximizes the firm’s long-run earnings and
the stock’s intrinsic value.
Note that changing technologies can lead to changes in the optimal policy. For
example, when a new technology makes it possible for a manufacturer to produce
a given product in 5 rather than 10 days, work-in-progress inventories can be cut
in half. Similarly, retailers typically have inventory management systems in which
bar codes on all merchandise are read at the cash register. This information is
transmitted electronically to a computer that records the remaining stock of each
item, and the computer automatically places an order with the supplier’s com-
puter when the stock falls to a specified level. This process lowers the “safety
stocks” that would otherwise be necessary to avoid running out of stock, which
lowers inventories to profit-maximizing levels.

15-3 CURRENT ASSETS FINANCING POLICIES
Investments in current assets must be financed; and the primary sources of funds
include bank loans, credit from suppliers (accounts payable), accrued liabilities,
long-term debt, and common equity. Each source has advantages and disadvan-
tages, so each firm must decide which sources are best for its situation.
To begin, note that most businesses experience seasonal and/or cyclical
fluctuations. For example, construction firms tend to peak in the summer, retailers
peak around Christmas, and the manufacturers who supply construction compa-
nies and retailers follow related patterns. Similarly, the sales of virtually all
businesses increase when the economy is strong; hence, they build up current
assets at those times but let inventories and receivables fall when the economy
weakens. Note, though, that current assets rarely drop to zero—companies main-
tain some permanent current assets, which are the current assets needed at the
low point of the business cycle. Then as sales increase during an upswing, current
assets are increased, and these extra current assets are defined as temporary
current assets as opposed to permanent current assets. The manner in which
these two types of current assets are financed is called the firm’s current assets
financing policy.
15-3A MATURITY MATCHING, OR “SELF-LIQUIDATING,”
APPROACH
The maturity matching, or “self-liquidating,” approach calls for matching asset
and liability maturities as shown in Panel a of Figure 15.2. All of the fixed assets
plus the permanent current assets are financed with long-term capital, but tem-
porary current assets are financed with short-term debt. Inventory expected to be
sold in 30 days would be financed with a 30-day bank loan, a machine expected to
last for 5 years would be financed with a 5-year loan, a 20-year building would be
financed with a 20-year mortgage bond, and so forth. Actually, two factors
prevent an exact maturity matching: (1) There is uncertainty about the lives of
assets. For example, a firm might finance inventories with a 30-day bank loan,
expecting to sell the inventories and use the cash to retire the loan. But if sales are
slow, the cash would not be forthcoming and the firm might not be able to pay off
the loan when it matures. (2) Some common equity must be used, and common
equity has no maturity. Still, when a firm attempts to match asset and liability
maturities, this is defined as a moderate current assets financing policy.
15-3B AGGRESSIVE APPROACH
Panel b of Figure 15.2 illustrates the situation for a more aggressive firm that
finances some of its permanent assets with short-term debt. Note that we used the
term relatively in the title of Panel b because there can be different degrees of
aggressiveness. For example, the dashed line in Panel b could have been drawn
below the line designating fixed assets, indicating that all of the current assets—
both permanent and temporary—and part of the fixed assets were financed with

short-term credit. This policy would be a highly aggressive, extremely nonconser-
vative position; and the firm would be subject to dangers from loan renewal as
well as problems with rising interest rates. However, short-term interest rates are
generally lower than long-term rates, and some firms are willing to sacrifice some
safety for the chance of higher profits.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The reason for adopting the aggressive policy is to take advantage of the fact
that the yield curve is generally upward-sloping; hence, short-term rates are
generally lower than long-term rates. However, a strategy of financing long-term
assets with short-term debt is really quite risky. To illustrate, suppose a company
borrows $1 million on a 1-year basis and uses the funds to purchase machinery
that will reduce labor costs by $200,000 per year for 10 years.3 Cash flows from
the equipment would not be sufficient to pay off the loan at the end of only 1 year,
so the loan would have to be renewed. If the company encountered temporary
financial problems, the lender might refuse to renew the loan, which could lead
to bankruptcy. Had the firm matched maturities and financed the plant with a
10-year loan, the required loan payments would have been better matched with
the cash flows and the loan renewal problem would not have arisen.
15-3C CONSERVATIVE APPROACH
Panel c of the figure shows the dashed line above the line designating permanent
current assets, indicating that long-term capital is used to finance all the perma-
nent assets and to meet some of the seasonal needs. In this situation, the firm uses
a small amount of short-term credit to meet its peak requirements, but it also
meets part of its seasonal needs by “storing liquidity” in the form of marketable
securities. The humps above the dashed line represent short-term financings,
while the troughs below the dashed line represent short-term security holdings.
This is a very safe, conservative financing policy.
15-3D CHOOSING BETWEEN THE APPROACHES
Because the yield curve is normally upward-sloping, the cost of short-term debt is
generally lower than that of long-term debt. However, short-term debt is riskier to the
borrowing firm for two reasons:
(1) If a firm borrows on a long-term basis, its
interest costs will be relatively stable over time. But if it uses short-term credit, its
interest expense can fluctuate widely, perhaps reaching such high levels that
profits are extinguished. (2) If a firm borrows heavily on a short-term basis, a
temporary recession may adversely affect its financial ratios and render it unable
to repay this debt. Recognizing this point, if the borrower’s financial position is
weak, the lender may not renew the loan, which could force the borrower into
bankruptcy. Many companies faced this adverse effect first hand when their short-
term sources of lending disappeared in the midst of the recent financial crisis.
Note too that short-term loans can generally be negotiated much faster than long-
term loans. Lenders need to make a more thorough financial examination before
extending long-term credit, and the loan agreement must be spelled out in detail
because a great deal can happen during the life of a 10- to 20-year loan.
Finally, short-term debt may offer greater flexibility. If the firm thinks that interest
rates are abnormally high, it may prefer short-term credit to gain flexibility in
changing the debt contract. Also, if its needs for funds are seasonal or cyclical, it
may not want to commit itself to long-term debt. While provisions for repaying
long-term debt can be built into the contract, prepayment penalties are also
generally built into long-term debt contracts to permit the lender to recover its
setup costs. Finally, long-term loan agreements generally contain provisions, or
covenants, that constrain the firm’s future actions in order to protect the lender,
whereas short-term credit agreements generally have fewer restrictions.
The relative benefits of short-term debt and long-term debt are likely to vary
over time. For example, in the credit crunch following the recent financial crisis,
3We are oversimplifying here. Few lenders would explicitly lend money for 1 year to finance a 10-year
asset. What would actually happen is that the firm would borrow on a 1-year basis for “general
corporate purposes” and then use the money to purchase the 10-year machinery.

many companies found it difficult to roll over their short-term loans coming due.
We suspect that many of these companies had wished that they had instead
adopted a much more conservative approach toward managing their working
capital. However, prior to the crisis, overly conservative firms relying on long-
term debt often found themselves at a competitive disadvantage because short-
term debt was consistently cheaper than long-term debt, and the rollover risk was
minimal because credit was readily available.
All things considered, it is not possible to state that long-term or short-term
financing is better than the other. The firm’s specific conditions will affect the
choice, as will the preferences of managers. Optimistic and/or aggressive man-
agers will probably lean more toward short-term credit to gain an interest cost
advantage, while more conservative managers will lean toward long-term finan-
cing to avoid potential loan renewal problems. The factors discussed here should
be considered, but the final decision will reflect managers’ personal preferences
and judgments.
15-4 THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
All firms follow a “working capital cycle” in which they purchase or produce
inventory, hold it for a time, and then sell it and receive cash. This process
is similar to the Yankee peddler’s trips, and it is known as the cash conversion
cycle (CCC).
15-4A CALCULATING THE TARGETED CCC
Assume that Great Fashions Inc. (GFI) is a start-up business that buys ladies’ golf
outfits from a manufacturer in China and sells them through pro shops at high-
end golf clubs in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The company’s business
plan calls for it to purchase $100,000 of merchandise at the start of each month
and have the merchandise sold within 60 days. The company will have 40 days to
pay its suppliers, and it will give its customers 60 days to pay for their purchases.
GFI expects to just break even during its first few years; so its monthly sales will
be $100,000, the same as its purchases. Any funds required to support operations
will be obtained from the bank, and those loans must be repaid as soon as cash is
available. This information can be used to calculate GFI’s cash conversion cycle,
which nets out the three time periods described below:4
1.

merchandise.5

2.
Average collection period (ACP). This is the length of time customers are
given to pay for goods following a sale. The ACP is also called the days’ sales
outstanding (DSO). GFI’s business plan calls for an ACP of 60 days, which is
consistent with its 60-day credit terms.
3.
Payables deferral period. This is the length of time GFI’s suppliers give GFI to
pay for its purchases (40 days in our example).
On Day 1, GFI buys merchandise and expects to sell the goods and thus convert
them to accounts receivable in 60 days. It should take another 60 days to collect
the receivables, making a total of 120 days between receiving merchandise and
collecting cash. However, GFI is able to defer its own payments for only 40 days.
We combine these three periods to find the planned cash conversion cycle, shown
here as an equation and in Figure 15.3 as an illustration.

Although GFI must pay $100,000 to its suppliers after 40 days, it will not
receive any cash until 60
60
120 days into the cycle. Therefore, it will have to
borrow the $100,000 cost of the merchandise from its bank on Day 40, and it will
not be able to repay the loan until it collects from customers on Day 120. Thus, for
120 −40
80 days—which is the cash conversion cycle (CCC)—it will owe the
bank $100,000 and will pay interest on this debt. The shorter the cash conversion
cycle, the better because that will lower interest charges. Note that if GFI could sell
goods faster, collect receivables faster, or defer its payables longer without hurting
sales or increasing operating costs, its CCC would decline, its interest expense
would be reduced, and its profits and stock price would be improved.
15-4B CALCULATING THE CCC FROM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preceding section illustrates the CCC in theory; but in practice, we would
calculate the CCC based on the firm’s financial statements. Moreover, the actual
CCC would almost certainly differ from the theoretically forecasted value because
of real-world complexities such as shipping delays, sales slowdowns, and custo-
mer delays in making payments. Moreover, a firm such as GFI would start a new
cycle before the earlier one ended, and this too would muddy the waters.
To see how the CCC is calculated in practice, assume that GFI has been
in business for several years and is now in a stable position—placing orders,

We begin with the inventory conversion period:
Inventory conversion period
Inventory
Cost of goods sold per day
$250,000
$1,013,889 365

15.2
Thus, it takes GFI an average of 90 days to sell its merchandise, not the 60 days
called for in its business plan. Note also that inventory is carried at cost; so the
denominator of the equation is the cost of goods sold, not sales.
SOME REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
The table below summarizes some recent estimates of the
cash conversion cycle (CCC) for 17 companies in seven
industries. As you would expect, the CCC tends to be
higher in retailing industries that require more inventory.
On the plus side, many retail companies benefit from a low
DSO because most of their customers pay with cash or
credit cards that are quickly collected. Large differences in
CCC can also arise within a given industry. For example, in
the computers and peripherals industry, IBM, which relies
heavily on consulting and business services, has a much
higher CCC than do Dell and Apple, which have stream-
lined inventory systems and a lot of direct sales to cus-
tomers. Indeed, Dell and Apple both have a negative CCC,
which means that instead of using cash, working capital
provides cash to the firm.
Likewise, taking a look at the three firms in the clothing
retail business, we see that Abercrombie & Fitch has an
abnormally high CCC because of its relatively large inventory
holdings. This is no doubt a concern to the company’s
management.

Note that it takes GFI 90 days after a sale to receive cash, not the 60 days called for
in its business plan. Because receivables are recorded at the sales price, we use
sales rather than cost of goods sold in the denominator.
The payables deferral period is found as follows, again using cost of goods
sold in the denominator because payables are recorded at cost:

GFI is supposed to pay its suppliers after 40 days; but it is a slow payer, delaying
payment on average until Day 54.
We can combine the three periods to calculate GFI’s actual cash conversion cycle:
Cash conversion cycle CCC
90 days
90 days −54 days
126 days
GFI’s actual 126-day CCC is quite different from the planned 80 days. It takes
longer than planned to sell merchandise, customers don’t pay as quickly as they
should, and GFI pays its suppliers slower than it should. The end result is a CCC
of 126 days versus the planned 80 days.
While the planned 80-day CCC is “reasonable,” the actual 126 days is too
high. The CFO should push salespeople to speed up sales and the credit manager
to accelerate collections. Also, the purchasing department should try to get longer
payment terms. If GFI could take those steps without hurting its sales and
operating costs, the firm would improve its profits and stock price.
Two professors, Hyun-Han Shin and Luc Soenen, studied more than 2,900
companies over a 20-year period. They found that shortening the cash conversion
cycle resulted in higher profits and better stock price performances.6 Their study
demonstrates that good working capital management is important to a firm’s
financial position and performance.

15-5 THE CASH BUDGET
Firms need to forecast their cash flows. If they are likely to need additional cash,
they should line up funds well in advance. On the other hand, if they are likely to
generate surplus cash, they should plan for its productive use. The primary
forecasting tool is the cash budget, illustrated in Table 15.1, which is a printout
from the chapter’s Excel model.
Cash budgets can be of any length, but firms typically develop a monthly cash
budget like Table 15.1 for the coming year and a daily cash budget at the start of
each month. The monthly budget is good for annual planning, while the daily
budget gives a more precise picture of the actual cash flows and is good for
scheduling actual payments on a day-by-day basis.
The monthly cash budget begins with a sales forecast for each month and
a projection of when actual collections will occur. Then there is a forecast of
materials purchases, followed by forecasted payments for materials, labor, leases,
new equipment, taxes, and other expenses. When the forecasted payments are
subtracted from the forecasted collections, the result is the expected net cash gain
or loss for each month. This gain or loss is added to or subtracted from the

beginning cash balance, and the result is the amount of cash the firm would have
on hand at the end of the month if it neither borrowed nor invested.
We use Allied Foods to illustrate cash budgets. To shorten the example, we
deal only with the last half of 2015. Allied sells mainly to grocery chains, and its
projected 2015 sales are $3,300 million. As Table 15.1 shows, sales increase during
the summer, peak in September, and then decline during the fall. All sales are on
terms of 2 10, net 30, meaning that a 2% discount is allowed if payment is made
within 10 days. But if the discount is not taken, the full amount is due in 30 days.

Allied Food Products 2015 Cash Budget (Dollars in Millions)
Notes:
1.
Although the budget period is July through December, sales and purchases data for May and June are needed to determine collections and
payments during July and August.
2.
Firms can both borrow and pay off commercial loans on a daily basis. So the $21 million loan shown for July would likely be borrowed gradually
on a daily basis as needed; and during October, the $115 million loan that existed at the beginning of the month would be reduced daily to the
$71 million ending balance, which, in turn, would be completely paid off sometime during November.

However, like most companies, Allied finds that some customers pay late. Experi-
ence shows that 20% of customers pay during the month of the sale—these are the
discount customers. Another 70% pay during the month immediately following
the sale; and 10% are late, paying in the second month after the sale.7
The costs to Allied for foodstuffs, spices, preservatives, and packaging mate-
rials average 70% of sales revenues. Purchases are generally made 1 month before
the firm expects to sell the finished products, but Allied’s suppliers allow it to
delay payments for 30 days. July sales are forecasted at $300 million; so purchases
during June should amount to $210 million, and this amount must be paid in July.
Wages and lease payments are also built into the cash budget, as are Allied’s
estimated tax payments—$30 million due September 15 and $20 million due
December 15. Also, a $100 million payment for a new plant must be made in
October, and miscellaneous other required payments are shown in the budget.
Allied’s target cash balance is $10 million, and it plans to borrow to meet this
target or to invest surplus funds if it generates more cash than is needed.
We use the information at the top of Table 15.1 to forecast monthly cash
surpluses or shortfalls from July through December, along with the amount Allied
will need to borrow or will have available to invest so as to keep the end-of-month
cash balance at the target level. Inputs used in the forecast—which are assump-
tions that may not be correct—are given in Rows 6 through 15. These values are
used in the calculations shown here. Row 20 gives the sales forecast for the
period May through December. May and June sales are needed to determine
collections for July and August. Rows 22 through 25 relate to collections. Row
22 shows that 20% of the sales during any given month are collected during
that month. However, customers who pay the first month take the discount;
so collections for that month are reduced by 2%. For example, collections for July
are calculated as 20% of the $300 million sales for that month minus the 2% discount,
or 0 2 $300 −0 2 $300 0 02
$58 8 million, rounded to $59 million. Row 23
shows the collections for the previous month’s sales. For example, in July, 70% of
the $250 million June sales, or $175 million, should be collected. Row 24 shows
collections from sales 2 months earlier. Thus, in July, collections for May sales should
be 0 10 $200
$20 million. The collections during each month are summed and
shown on Row 25. Thus, the July collections include 20% of July sales (minus the
discount) and 70% of June sales plus 10% of May sales, or $254 million in total.
Raw material costs, which are 70% of next month’s sales, are shown on
Row 26. July sales are forecasted at $300 million, so June purchases are
0 7 $300
$210 million. The $210 million must be paid in July, so that amount
is shown on Row 28. Continuing, forecasted sales for August are $400 million; so
Allied must purchase 0 7 $400
$280 million of materials in July, and that
amount must be paid in August. Other required payments—labor costs, lease
payments, taxes, construction costs, and miscellaneous expenses—are shown on
Rows 29 through 33; and the total of all payments is shown on Row 34.
Next, on Row 36, we show the net cash flow (NCF) for each month, calculated
as total collections on Row 25 minus total payments on Row 34. The NCF for July
is −$11 million; and cash flows remain negative due to the fall harvest and
processing until October, when positive cash flows begin.
The monthly cash flows are then used to calculate the cumulative net cash flows
as shown on Row 37. Here we add the NCF for each month to the cumulative NCF
from the prior month. Because there was no prior cumulative NCF at the beginning of
July, the cumulative NCF for July is simply the NCF for that month, −$11 million. For
August, we add the NCF for that month, −$37 million, to the prior cumulative NCF,
7A negligible percentage of sales results in bad debts. The low bad debt losses result from Allied’s
careful screening of customers and its generally tight credit policies. However, the cash budget model
can show the effects of bad debts, so Allied’s CFO could show top management how cash flows would
be affected if the firm relaxed its credit policy to stimulate sales.

the −$11 million at the end of July, to get the −$48 million cumulative NCF at the end
of August. There is another negative cash flow during September, so the cumulative
NCF rises to a peak of −$105 million. However, in October, the NCF is positive; so the
cumulative figure declines to −$61 million, and it changes from a negative amount to a
positive amount in November and remains positive in December.
Allied’s target cash balance is $10 million—it wants to maintain that balance
at all times. It plans to borrow $10 million at the start of the analysis, and we show
that amount on Row 39. Because there is a projected cash loss of $11 million
during July and because Allied borrowed $10 million at the start of the month, at
the end of July, its loan outstanding will total $21 million as shown on Row 40.8
It will incur additional cash shortfalls in August and September; and the required
loan will continue to increase, peaking at $115 million at the end of September.
However, positive cash flows begin in October; and they will be used to reduce
the loan, which will be completely paid off by the end of November, at which
time the company will have funds to invest. Indeed, by the end of December,
Allied should have no loans outstanding and $77 million available for investment.
For the six-month period shown, Row 41 shows the maximum required loan,
$115 million; and Row 42 shows the maximum projected surplus, $77 million.
Allied’s treasurer will need to arrange a line of credit so that the firm can borrow
up to $115 million, increasing the loan over time as funds are needed and repaying
it later when cash flows become positive. The treasurer would show the cash
budget to the bankers when negotiating for the line of credit. Lenders would want
to know how much Allied expects to need, when the funds will be needed, and
when the loan will be repaid. The lenders—and Allied’s top executives—would
question the treasurer about the budget. They would want to know how the
forecasts would be affected if sales were higher or lower than those projected,
how changes would affect the forecasts when customers pay, and the like. The
questioning would focus on these two questions: How accurate is the forecast likely to
be? What would be the effects of significant errors?
Note that if cash inflows and outflows do not occur uniformly during each
month, the actual funds needed might be quite different from the indicated
amounts. The data in Table 15.1 show the situation on the last day of each month,
and we see that the maximum projected loan is $115 million. However, if all
payments had to be made on the 1st of the month but most collections came on the
30th, Allied would have to make $265 million of payments in July before it
received the $254 million from collections. In that case, the firm would need to
borrow about $275 million, not the $21 million shown in Table 15.1. A daily cash
budget would reveal that situation.
Table 15.1 was prepared using Excel, which makes it easy to change the
assumptions. Therefore, we could examine the cash flow effects of changes in
sales, the target cash balance, customers’ payments, and so forth. Also, the effects
of changes in credit policy and inventory management could be examined
through the cash budget.
S E L F T E S T
How could the cash budget be used when the terms of a bank loan are negotiated?
Suppose a firm’s cash flows do not occur uniformly throughout the month.
What effect would this have on the accuracy of the forecasted borrowing
requirements based on a monthly cash budget? How could the firm deal with
this problem?
8If Allied had begun with a positive cash balance, that amount would have been deducted from the initial
loan needed. Note too that our cash budget is simplified because it does not show interest expense for the
loan or interest income on investments. Those items could be added easily to the cash budget.

15-6 CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
When most people use the term cash, they mean currency (paper money and
coins) in addition to bank demand deposits. However, when corporate trea-
surers use the term, they often mean currency and demand deposits in addition
to very safe, highly liquid, marketable securities that can be sold quickly at a
predictable price, and thus be converted to bank deposits.9 Therefore, “cash” as
reported on balance sheets generally includes short-term securities, which are
also called “cash equivalents.”
Note that a firm’s marketable security holdings can be divided into two
categories: (1) Operating short-term securities, which are held primarily to provide
liquidity and are bought and sold as needed to provide funds for operations, and
(2) other short-term securities, which are holdings in excess of the amount needed to
support normal operations. Highly profitable firms such as Microsoft often hold
far more securities than are needed for liquidity purposes. Those securities will
eventually be liquidated; and the cash will be used for such things as paying a
large one-time dividend, repurchasing stock, retiring debt, acquiring other firms,
or financing major expansions. This breakdown is not reported on the balance
sheet, but financial managers know how much of their securities will be needed
for operating versus other purposes. In our discussion of net working capital, the
focus is on securities held to provide operating liquidity.
15-6A CURRENCY
Fast-food operators, casinos, hotels, movie theaters, and a few other businesses
hold substantial amounts of currency; but the importance of currency has
decreased over time due to the rise of credit cards, debit cards, and other payment
mechanisms. Companies such as McDonald’s need to hold enough currency to
support operations; but if they held more, this would raise capital costs and tempt
robbers. Each firm decides its own optimal level; but even for retailers, currency
generally represents a small part of total cash holdings.10
15-6B DEMAND DEPOSITS
Demand (or checking) deposits are far more important than currency for most
businesses. These deposits are used for transactions—paying for labor and raw
materials, purchasing fixed assets, paying taxes, servicing debt, paying divi-
dends, and so forth. However, commercial demand deposits typically earn no
interest; so firms try to minimize their holdings while still ensuring that they
are able to pay suppliers promptly, take trade discounts, and take advantage
of bargain purchases. The following techniques are used to optimize demand
deposit holdings:
1.
Hold marketable securities rather than demand deposits to provide liquidity. When
the firm holds marketable securities, the need for demand deposits is reduced.
For example, if a large bill requiring immediate payment comes in
unexpectedly, the treasurer can simply call a securities dealer, sell some
securities, and have funds deposited in the firm’s checking account that same
day. Securities pay interest whereas demand deposits do not, so holding
securities in lieu of demand deposits increases profits.
9The reason corporate treasurers think of cash as they do is that, from their perspective, there is little
difference between demand deposits and liquid marketable securities. They can call a dealer, sell
securities, and have the proceeds deposited in the firm’s bank account in an hour or so. Also, many
types of short-term securities are available. Treasury bills are an obvious example; but as we discussed
in Chapter 2, there are many other safe, liquid, short-term, marketable securities.
10In the “olden days,” currency was also held as a store of value, for use during emergencies, for use in
making bargain purchases, and the like. That is true today only in undeveloped parts of the world.

2.
Borrow on short notice. Firms can establish lines of credit under which they can
borrow with just a telephone call if and when they need extra cash. Note,
though, that they may have to pay fees for those commitments; and the cost of
those fees must be considered when deciding to use borrowing capacity rather
than securities to provide liquidity.
3.
Forecast payments and receipts better. The better the firm can forecast its cash
inflows and outflows, the smaller its needs for funds to meet unexpected
requirements. Therefore, improving inflow/outflow forecasts lessens the need
to hold liquid assets and thus reduces the required amount of working capital.
The cash budget is the key tool used to improve cash forecasts.
4.
Speed up payments. Firms can take actions to obtain their cash receipts faster.
For example, they can use lockboxes, which are post office boxes operated
by banks. Suppose a New York firm sells to customers all across the
country. If it sends out bills and has customers make payments to its
New York headquarters, time will be lost in waiting on the mail, in
opening envelopes, in depositing checks in the bank, and in waiting for the
bank to clear the checks to make sure they are good. To speed up this
process, the firm can direct customers to send payments to a post office
box in the customer’s local area, then have a bank empty the box several
times each day and start the collection process. If a firm’s receipts average
$1 million per day and if the use of lockboxes can reduce the delay in
obtaining usable cash from 5 days to 1 day, the firm will reduce funds
in transit from $5 million to $1 million and thus receive an effective cash
infusion of $4 million. This is a one-time benefit, but the firm will be
earning a continuing return on the $4 million.11
5.
Use credit cards, debit cards, wire transfers, and direct deposits. If a firm switches
from selling on credit to accepting credit or debit cards, it will receive next-day
cash and thus the same cash flow benefits as described earlier. Similarly,
requiring customers to pay via wire deposits speeds up collections, increases
free cash flows, and reduces required cash holdings.
6.
Synchronize cash flows. If a firm can synchronize its cash inflows and outflows,
the firm will reduce its need for cash balances. For example, utilities, oil
companies, department stores, and the like generally use “billing cycles”
under which different customers are billed on different days, causing cash to
flow in evenly during the month. These firms can then set up their own
payment schedules to match their inflows. This reduces average cash balances,
just as your personal average monthly balance can be reduced when your
income comes in at the same time as your required payments.
Banks have experts who help firms optimize their cash management procedures.
The banks charge a fee for this service, but the benefits of a good cash manage-
ment system are well worth the cost.
15-6C MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities held for operations are managed in conjunction with
demand deposits—the management of one requires coordination with the other.
Firms also purchase marketable securities as cash builds up from operations
11We should mention the term float, as it often comes up in connection with cash management. If you
write a check and it takes 5 days for the recipient to receive and deposit the check and for it to be
deducted from your account, you have 5 days of float, or the use of the money for 5 days before you
have to deposit funds in your account. That’s payment float. On the other hand, if someone sends you a
check and it takes 4 days for you to receive and deposit it and for the bank to clear the funds, that’s
4 days of collection float. Your net float would be 1 day. Positive net float is good, but negative net float
is bad from the standpoint of minimizing required cash holdings.

and then sell those securities when they need cash. Recently, to maintain flex-
ibility and/or to have funds available to withstand a future economic decline,
many companies have continued to hold large amounts of cash and marketable
securities. The Federal Reserve reported in September 2011 that cash and mar-
ketable securities held by nonfinancial companies totaled more than $2 trillion—
an amount which represented more than 7% of all assets that these companies
reported on their balance sheets.12 In fact, at the end of the first quarter of 2013,
American companies were holding $1 73 trillion of cash.13 Today, many large
companies hold vast amounts of cash and securities—for example, Microsoft,
Apple, and Cisco Systems have all recently held more than $25 billion in cash
and marketable securities.
Given the size and importance of marketable securities holdings, how they
are managed can have a significant effect on profits. A trade-off between risk
and return is involved—the firm wants to earn high returns; but because most
marketable securities are held to provide liquidity, treasurers want to hold
securities that can be sold very quickly at a known price. That means high-
quality, short-term instruments. Long-term Treasury bonds are safe, but they
are not well suited for the marketable securities portfolio because their prices
decline when interest rates rise. Similarly, short-term securities issued by risky
companies are not suitable because their prices decline when the issuers’
problems grow worse. Treasury bills, most commercial paper (discussed in
Section 15-11), bank certificates of deposit, and money market funds are
suitable holdings.
It’s worth noting that so-called safe securities don’t always turn out to be safe.
In 2007, billions of dollars of Aaa-rated commercial paper were actually backed by
subprime mortgages; and when those mortgages started defaulting, this commer-
cial paper caused their holders a great deal of trouble. One issue of commercial
paper was downgraded from Aaa to Ba in just one day, and those people holding
what they thought was safe and highly liquid paper found it to be totally illiquid
and of doubtful value. As you might guess, before it defaulted, the mortgage-
backed commercial paper paid a somewhat higher return, about 3 505% versus
about 3 467% for paper backed by T-bills. Those seeking higher returns generally
have to accept more risk.
A firm’s relationship with its bank—especially its ability to borrow on short
notice—can have a significant effect on its need for both demand deposits and
marketable securities. If a company has a firmly committed line of credit under
which it can obtain funds with a simple telephone call, it won’t need much in the
way of liquid reserves. Indeed, many argue that growing concerns about banks’
willingness to provide credit has caused some companies to increase their hold-
ings of cash and marketable securities.
Finally, larger corporations shop for securities all around the world, buying
wherever risk-adjusted rates are highest. This shopping tends to equalize world-
wide rates—if interest rates in Europe are higher than rates in the United States
for equally risky securities, companies will buy European securities, driving their
prices up and their yields down, until an equilibrium has been established.
We truly live in a global economy.14
12Refer to the following article, Ben Casselman and Justin Lahart, “Companies Shun Investment, Hoard
Cash,” The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com), September 17, 2011.
13Refer to the following article, Alan Pyke, “Austerity’s Vicious Cycle Spurs Record Cash Hoarding by
U.S. Companies” (thinkprogress.org), May 23, 2013.
14Companies can also buy securities that are denominated in different currencies. Thus, if a firm’s
treasurer thinks that the euro is likely to appreciate against the dollar, he or she might purchase
securities denominated in euros; and if things work out as expected, the firm will earn interest and
enjoy an additional gain from the change in exchange rates. Again, these actions help to keep world
financial markets in equilibrium.

15-7 INVENTORIES
Inventories, which can include (1) supplies, (2) raw materials, (3) work in process, and
(4) finished goods are an essential part of virtually all business operations. Optimal
inventory levels depend on sales, so sales must be forecasted before target inventories
can be established. Moreover, because errors in setting inventory levels lead to lost
sales or excessive carrying costs, inventory management is quite important. Therefore,
firms use sophisticated computer systems to monitor their inventory holdings.
Retailers typically use computers to keep track of each inventory item by size,
shape, and color; and bar code information collected at checkout updates inven-
tory records. When inventories shown in the computer decline to a set level, the
computer sends an order to the supplier’s computer, specifying exactly what is
needed. The computer also reports how fast items are moving. If an item is
moving too slowly, the computer will suggest a price cut to lower the inventory
stock before the item becomes obsolete. Manufacturers use similar systems to keep
track of items and to place orders as they are needed.
Although inventory management is important, it is under the operational control
of production managers and marketing people rather than financial managers. Still,
financial managers are involved in several ways. First, it is expensive to install and
maintain the computer systems used to track inventories; and the capital budgeting
analysis discussed earlier in the text must be used to determine which system is best.
Second, if the firm decides to increase its inventory holdings, the financial manager
must raise the capital needed to acquire the additional inventory. And third,
the financial manager is responsible for identifying any area of weakness that affects
the firm’s overall profitability, using ratios and other procedures for comparing the
firm to its benchmark companies. Therefore, the CFO will compare the firm’s
inventory-to-sales ratio with those of its benchmarks to see if things look “reason-
able.” Since inventory management is outside the mainstream of finance, we cover it
in Web Appendix 15A rather than in this chapter.

15-8 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Although some sales are made for cash, today the vast majority of sales are on
credit. Thus, in the typical situation, goods are shipped, inventories are reduced,
and an account receivable is created.15 Eventually, the customer pays, the firm
receives cash, and its receivables decline. The firm’s credit policy is the primary
determinant of accounts receivable, and it is under the administrative control of
the CFO. Moreover, credit policy is a key determinant of sales, so sales and
marketing executives are concerned with this policy. Therefore, we begin our
discussion of accounts receivable by discussing credit policy.
15-8A CREDIT POLICY
Credit policy consists of these four variables:
1.
Credit period is the length of time buyers are given to pay for their purchases.
For example, the credit period might be 30 days. Customers prefer longer
credit periods, so lengthening the period will stimulate sales. However,
a longer credit period lengthens the cash conversion cycle; hence, it ties up
more capital in receivables, which is costly. Also, the longer a receivable is
outstanding, the higher the probability that the customer will default and
that the account will end up as a bad debt.
2.
Discounts are price reductions given for early payment. The discount specifies
what the percentage reduction is and how rapidly payment must be made
to be eligible for the discount. For example, a 2% discount is often given if the
customer pays within 10 days. Offering discounts has two benefits. First,
the discount amounts to a price reduction, which stimulates sales. Second,
discounts encourage customers to pay earlier than they otherwise would,
which shortens the cash conversion cycle. However, discounts also mean
lower prices—and lower revenues unless the quantity sold increases by
enough to offset the price reduction. The benefits and costs of discounts
must be balanced when credit policy is being established.
3.
Credit standards, which refer to the required financial strength of acceptable
credit customers. With regard to credit standards, factors considered for
business customers include ratios such as the customer’s debt and interest
coverage ratios, the customer’s credit history (has the customer paid on time
in the past or tended to be delinquent), and the like. For individual customers,
their credit score as developed by credit rating agencies is the key item.
In both cases, the key question is this: Is the customer likely to be willing
and able to make the required payment on schedule? Note that when
standards are set too low, bad debt losses will be too high; on the other
hand, when standards are set too high, the firm loses sales and thus profits.
So a balance must be struck between the costs and benefits of tighter credit
standards.
4.
Collection policy refers to the procedures used to collect past due accounts,
including the toughness or laxity used in the process. At one extreme, the firm
might write a series of polite letters after a fairly long delay; while at the other
extreme, delinquent accounts may be turned over to a collection agency
relatively quickly. Companies should be somewhat firm, but excessive
15Whenever goods are sold on credit, two accounts are created—an asset item titled account receivable
appears on the books of the selling firm, and a liability item called an account payable appears on the
purchaser’s books. At this point, we are analyzing the transaction from the viewpoint of the seller; so
we are focusing on the variables under the seller’s control—in this case, receivables. In Section 15-9, we
examine the transaction from the purchaser’s viewpoint when we discuss accounts payable as a source
of funds and consider their cost relative to the cost of funds obtained from other sources.
Account Receivable
Funds due from a
customer.
Credit Policy
A set of rules that include
the firm’s credit period,
discounts, credit
standards, and collection
procedures offered.
Credit Period
The length of time
customers have to pay
for purchases.
Discounts
Price reductions given
for early payment.
Credit Standards
The financial strength
customers must exhibit
to qualify for credit.

pressure can lead customers whose business is profitable to take their business
elsewhere. Again, a balance must be struck between the costs and benefits of
different collection policies.
Firms generally publish their credit terms, defined as a statement of their credit
period and discount policy. Thus, Allied Foods might have stated credit terms of
2 10, net 30, which means that it allows a 2% discount if payment is received
within 10 days of the purchase; if the discount is not taken then, the full amount
is due in 30 days. Credit standards and collection policies are relatively subjective,
so they are not generally discussed in the published credit terms.
15-8B SETTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE CREDIT POLICY
Credit policy is important for three main reasons: (1) It has a major effect on sales;
(2) it influences the amount of funds tied up in receivables; and (3) it affects bad
debt losses. Because of the importance of the policy, the firm’s executive commit-
tee (which normally consists of the president in addition to the vice presidents of
finance and marketing) has the final say on setting the credit policy. Once the
policy has been established, the credit manager, who typically works under the
CFO, must implement it and monitor its effects. Managing a credit department
requires fast, accurate, and up-to-date information. Several organizations, includ-
ing Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, use computer-based networks to collect,
store, and distribute credit information. For businesses, Dun & Bradstreet pro-
vides detailed credit reports over the Internet for a fee. The reports include the
following types of information:
1.
A summary balance sheet and income statement
2.
A number of key ratios with trend information
3.
Data obtained from the firm’s suppliers telling whether it pays promptly or
slowly and whether it has recently failed to make any payments
4.
A verbal description of the physical condition of the firm’s operations
5.
A verbal description of the backgrounds of the firm’s owners, including any
previous bankruptcies, lawsuits, or divorce settlement problems
6.
A summary rating ranging from A for the best credit risks down to F for those
firms that are deemed likely to default
Credit scores are numerical scores that are based on a statistical analysis and
provide a summary assessment of the likelihood that a potential customer will
default on a required payment. Computerized analytical systems assist in making
better credit decisions; but in the final analysis, most credit decisions are exercises
in informed judgment.16
We have emphasized the costs of granting credit. However, if it is possible to sell
on credit and to impose a carrying charge on the receivables that are outstanding, credit
sales can actually be more profitable than cash sales. This is especially true for con-
sumer durables (e.g., automobiles and appliances), but it is also true for certain
types of industrial equipment. Thus, the General Electric Capital Corporation
16Credit analysts use procedures ranging from highly sophisticated computerized credit-scoring
systems, which calculate the statistical probability that a given customer will default, to informal
procedures, which involve going through a checklist of factors that should be considered when a
credit application is processed. The credit-scoring systems use various financial ratios, such as the
current ratio and the debt ratio (for businesses), and income, years with the same employer, and the
like (for individuals), to determine the statistical probability of default. Credit is then granted to those
with low default probabilities. The informal procedures often involve examining the “ 5 Cs of Credit”:
character, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions. Character is obvious; capacity is a subjective
estimate of ability to repay; capital means how much net worth the borrower has; collateral means
assets pledged to secure the loan; and conditions refers to business conditions, which affect ability to
repay.

(GECC) unit of GE, which finances household appliances, is highly profitable, as
are other companies’ credit subsidiaries.17 Some companies actually earn more on
credit than cash sales, and their salespeople earn higher commissions when they
make a credit sale.
The carrying charges on outstanding consumer credit are generally about 18%
on a nominal basis: 1 5% per month, so 1 5%
12
18%. This is equivalent to an
effective annual rate of 1 015 12−1 0
19 6%. Having receivables outstanding
that earn more than 18% is highly profitable unless there are too many bad
debt losses.
Legal considerations must also be considered when setting credit policy.
Under the Robinson-Patman Act, it is illegal for a firm to charge prices that
discriminate between customers unless the different prices are cost-justified.
The same holds true for credit—it is illegal to offer more favorable credit terms
to one customer or class of customers than to another unless the differences are
cost-justified.
15-8C MONITORING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The total amount of accounts receivable outstanding at any given time is deter-
mined by the volume of credit sales and the average length of time between sales
and collections. For example, suppose Boston Lumber Company (BLC), a whole-
sale distributor of lumber products, has sales of $1,000 per day (all on credit)
and it requires payment after 10 days. BLC has no bad debts or slow-paying
customers. Under those conditions, it must have the capital to carry $10,000 of
receivables:
Accounts receivable
Sales per day
Length of collection period
$1,000
10 days
$10,000
15.5
If either sales or the collection period changes, so will accounts receivable. For
example, if sales doubled to $2,000/day, receivables would also double; and the
firm would need an additional $10,000 to finance this increase. Similarly, if the
collection period lengthened to 20 days, this too would double the receivables and
require additional capital.
If management is not careful, the collection period will creep up as good
customers take longer to pay and as sales are made to weaker customers who
tend to pay slowly or not at all and thus create bad debts. So it is important to
monitor receivables. One easy-to-use monitoring technique employs the DSO.
Here’s Allied Foods’ DSO as calculated in Chapter 4:
DSO
Days
sales
outstanding
Receivables
Average sales per day
Receivables
Annual sales 365
$375
$3,000 365
$375
$8 2192
45 625 days ≈46 days
Industry average
36 days
Allied has average daily sales (ADS) of $8 2192 million, and those sales are out-
standing for 45 625 days. If we multiply the DSO by the average daily sales, we
determine the capital tied up in receivables:
Receivables
ADS DSO
8 2192 45 625
$375 million
17Companies that do a large volume of sales financing typically set up subsidiary companies called
captive finance companies to do the actual financing. For example, Ford, Sears, and IBM also have captive
finance companies.

Note, though, that if Allied collected its receivables faster and reduced its DSO to
the 36-day industry average, its receivables would decline to $295 89 million, or by
$79 11 million. The DSO can also be compared to the firm’s own credit terms.
Allied sells on terms of net 30, so its DSO should be no greater than 30 days.
Obviously, some customers are paying late, so there is room for improvement in
its collections policy and practices.18
15-9 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE (TRADE CREDIT)
Firms generally make purchases from other firms on credit and record the debt as
an account payable. Accounts payable, or trade credit, is the largest single category
of short-term debt, representing about 40% of the average corporation’s current
liabilities. This credit is a spontaneous source of financing in the sense that it arises
spontaneously from ordinary business transactions. For example, if a firm makes a
purchase of $1,000 on terms of net 30, it must pay for goods 30 days after
the invoice date. This instantly and spontaneously provides $1,000 of credit for
30 days. If the firm purchases $1,000 of goods each day, on average, it will be
receiving 30 times $1,000, or $30,000, of credit from its suppliers. If sales, and
consequently purchases, double, its accounts payable also will double, to $60,000.
So simply by growing, the firm spontaneously generates another $30,000 of
financing. Similarly, if the terms under which it buys are extended from 30 to
40 days, its accounts payable will expand from $30,000 to $40,000. Thus, expand-
ing sales and lengthening the credit period generate additional financing.
Trade credit may be free, or it may be costly. If the seller does not offer
discounts, the credit is free in the sense that there is no cost for using it. However,
if discounts are available, a complication arises. To illustrate, suppose PCC Inc.
buys 20 microchips each day with a list price of $100 per chip on terms of 2 10, net
30. Under those terms, the “true” price of the chips is 0 98 $100
$98 because the
chips can be purchased for only $98 by paying within 10 days. Thus, the $100 list
price has two components:
List price
$98 “true” price
$2 finance charge

What are the four credit policy variables?
Define days sales outstanding (DSO). What can be learned from it, and how is it

18Another technique used to monitor receivables is the Aging Schedule, which shows the dollar amount
and percentage of receivables that have been outstanding for different lengths of time. See Chapter 21,

edition (Mason, OH: South-Western/Cengage Learning, 2013).

If PCC decides to take the discount, it will pay at the end of Day 10 and show
$19,600 of accounts payable:19
Accounts payable Take discounts
10 days 20 chips $98 per chip
$19,600
If it decides to delay payment until the 30th day, its trade credit will be $58,800:
Accounts payable No discounts
30 days 20 chips $98 per chip
$58,800
By not taking discounts, PCC can obtain an additional $39,200 of trade credit, but
this $39,200 is costly credit because the firm must forgo the discounts to receive it.
Therefore, PCC must answer this question: Could we obtain the additional
$39,200 at a lower cost from some other source (e.g., a bank)?
To illustrate the situation, assume that PCC operates 365 days per year and
buys 20 chips per day at a “true” price of $98 per chip. Therefore, its total chip
purchases are 20 $98 365
$715,400 per year. If it does not take discounts, its
chips will cost 20 $100 365
$730,000, or an additional $14,600. This $14,600
is the annual cost of the $39,200 of extra credit. Dividing the $14,600 cost by the
$39,200 additional credit yields the nominal annual cost of the additional trade
credit, 37 24%:
Nominal annual cost of trade credit
$14,600
$39,200
37 24%
If PCC can borrow from its bank or some other source for less than 37 24%, it
should take the discount and use only $19,600 of trade credit.
The same result can be obtained with the following equation:
Nominal annual
cost of
trade credit
Discount %
100 −Discount %
365
Days credit is
outstanding −Discount
period
2
98
365
20
2 04%
18 25
37 24%
15.6
The numerator of the first term, Discount %, is the cost per dollar of credit,
while the denominator, 100 −Discount %, represents the funds made avail-
able by not taking the discount. Thus, the first term, 2 04%, is the cost per
period for the trade credit. The denominator of the second term is the number
of days of extra credit obtained by not taking the discount. So the entire
second term shows how many times per year the cost is incurred, 18 25 times
in this example.20
19A question arises here: Should accounts payable reflect gross purchases or purchases net of
discounts? Generally accepted accounting principles permit either treatment if the difference is not
material; but if the discount is material, the account payable must be recorded net of discounts, or at
the “true” price. Then the cost of not taking discounts is reported as an additional expense called
“discounts lost.” This procedure highlights the often high cost of not taking discounts. In PCC’s case, it
would record payables of 20($98) = $1,960, not $2,000, per day; and if it did not take the discount and
had to pay the full $2,000, it would show the $40 discount lost per day as an expense.
20The nominal annual cost formula does not consider compounding; and in effective annual interest
terms, the cost of trade credit is even higher. The discount is equivalent to interest; and with terms of
2/10, net 30, the firm gains the use of funds for 30 −10 = 20 days. So there are 365/20 = 18.25 “interest
periods” per year. Remember that the first term in Equation 15.6, (Discount %)/(100 −Discount %) =
0.02/0.98 = 0.0204, is the periodic interest rate. That rate is paid 18.25 times each year, so the effective
annual cost of trade credit is 44.6%:
Effective annual rate
1 0204 18 25 −1 0
1 4459 −1 0
44 6%
Thus, the 37.2% nominal cost calculated with Equation 15.6 understates the effective cost.

With this background, we can define two types of trade credit: free and
costly:
1.
Free trade credit is the trade credit that is obtained without a cost, and
it consists of all trade credit that is available without forgoing discounts.
In PCC’s case, when it buys on terms of 2 10, net 30, the first 10 days of
purchases, or $19,600, are free.
2.
Costly trade credit is any trade credit over and above the free trade credit.
For PCC, the additional 20 days, or $39,200, are not free because receiving
the additional credit means forfeiting the discount.
Firms should always use the free component, but they should use the costly component
only if they cannot obtain funds at a lower cost from another source.21
A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT
During tough economic times, many companies find it
harder to obtain loans to finance their working capital, so
they increasingly rely on trade credit. Often times, suppliers
are very willing to provide this trade credit because it helps
maintain a valuable customer relationship.
But as an article in CFO magazine points out, suppliers
frequently face a difficult balancing act when their cus-
tomers are slow to pay them back. On one hand, you don’t
want to push too hard to force payment, for fear that you
may lose the customer. But on the other hand, the longer
the customer takes to pay, the more your cash is tied up,
and the greater the risk that you will never get paid.
The article quotes, among others, Pam Krank who is
president of an outsourcing firm, The Credit Department.
Krank recommends keeping a close eye on your cus-
tomer’s DSO to gauge the timeliness of payments. She
points out that “If your customer doesn’t get paid by its
customer for 80 days, you won’t get paid in 30.” At the
same time, Krank argues that while you have to be vig-
ilant with slow payers, you can’t just walk away from
doing business with them, particularly during tough
times. She asserts, “You can’t just say they’re high risk
so we can’t sell to them.” Echoing Krank’s viewpoint, Jerry
Flum,
the
chief
executive
of
CreditRiskMonitor,
also
argues that you sometimes have to keep doing business
with slow payers, especially if your company is earning
high profit margins from the sales.
Looking at a similar issue, an article in The Wall Street
Journal argues that during the recent slowdown, large
companies and small companies have balanced these
concerns in different ways. During the slowdown, compa-
nies with sales over $5 billion collected their bills slightly
faster (the average bill was collected in 41 9 days in 2008
compared to 41 days in 2009), but they took longer to
pay their bills (55 8 days in 2009 compared to 53 2 days
in 2008). In contrast, the reverse pattern holds for com-
panies with sales less than $500 million. These compa-
nies paid their bills more quickly in 2009 (40 1 days
compared to 42 9 days in 2008), but their customers
were much slower paying them (58 9 days in 2009 com-
pared to 54 4 days in 2008).
Summarizing these trends, the article provides the follow-
ing assessment:
“There’s a power struggle going on as the credit
crunch has moved to Main Street,” says Sung Won
Sohn, a former chief economist at Wells Fargo who
now teaches at California State University, Channel
Islands. “Big firms can force their terms on suppliers
and customers. And if you’re a small business or a
small store in a mall, you have no bargaining power
and have to take what’s given, which is not much
today.”
Sources: Vincent Ryan, “Slow Burn: What Should You Do When Customers Are Slow to Pay?” CFO (cfo.com), April 1, 2010; and Serena Ng and
Cari Tuna, “Big Firms Are Quick to Collect, Slow to Pay,” The Wall Street Journal (online.wsj.com), August 31, 2009.
21Note that the cost of trade credit can be reduced by paying late. If PCC could get away with paying in
60 days rather than the specified 30 days, the effective credit period would become 60 −10 = 50 days,
the number of times the discount would be lost would fall to 365/50 = 7.3, and the nominal cost would
drop from 37.2% to 2.04%
7.3 = 14.9%. This is called stretching accounts payable, and it damages the
firm’s reputation and can cause problems later.
Free Trade Credit
Credit received during the
discount period.
Costly Trade Credit
Credit taken in excess of
free trade credit, whose
cost is equal to the
discount lost.

15-10 BANK LOANS
The key features of bank loans, another important source of short-term financing
for businesses and individuals, are discussed in this section.
15-10A PROMISSORY NOTE
The terms of a bank loan are spelled out in a promissory note. Here are some key
features of most promissory notes:22
1.
Amount. The amount borrowed is indicated.
2.
Maturity. Although banks do make longer-term loans, the bulk of their lending is
on a short-term basis—about two-thirds of all bank loans mature in a year or
less. Long-term loans always have a specific maturity date, while a short-term
loan may or may not have a specified maturity. For example, a loan may
mature in 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, or 1 year; or it may call for payment
Q U E S T I O N :
Diana’s Designs just recently opened as an upscale dress shop in northeast Florida. The
owner is trying to decide whether to take the discount offered from her suppliers,
or whether to pay at the end of the month. Diana’s suppliers are offering her a 3% discount
if she pays within 15 days; otherwise, the balance is due 30 days after purchase. What are
Diana’s nominal and effective annual costs of trade credit?
A N S W E R :

Clearly, the effective cost of trade credit is extremely high. So, if she is able to pay within
the 15-day window, Diana should definitely take the 3% discount offered by her suppliers.
S E L F T E S T
What is trade credit?
What is the difference between free trade credit and costly trade credit? What is
the formula for finding the nominal annual cost of trade credit? Does the
nominal cost of trade credit understate the effective cost? Explain.
22Sometimes, the note will also specify that the firm must maintain a compensating balance equal to 10%
to 20% of the face amount of the loan. This balance generally has the effect of increasing the effective
cost of the loan. Compensating balances are much less common today than they were a few years ago.

terms and conditions of a

“on demand,” in which case the loan can remain outstanding as long as the
borrower wants to continue using the funds and the bank agrees. Bank loans
to businesses are frequently written as 90-day notes, so the loan must be
repaid or renewed at the end of 90 days. It is often expected that the loan will
be renewed; but if the borrower’s financial position deteriorates, the bank
can refuse to renew it. This can lead to bankruptcy. Because banks usually
don’t demand payment unless the borrower’s creditworthiness has
deteriorated, some “short-term loans” remain outstanding for years, with the
interest rate floating with rates in the economy.
3.
Interest rate. The interest rate can be fixed or floating. For larger loans, it is
typically indexed to the bank’s prime rate, to the T-bill rate, or to the London
Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR). The note will also indicate whether the bank
uses a 360- or 365-day year for purposes of calculating interest. The indicated
rate is a nominal rate, and the effective annual rate is generally higher.
4.
Interest only versus amortized. Loans are either interest only, meaning that only
interest is paid during the life of the loan, with all principal repaid when the
loan matures, or amortized, meaning that some of the principal is repaid on
each payment date. Amortized loans are also called installment loans.
5.
Frequency of interest payments. If the note is on an interest-only basis, it will
indicate how frequently interest must be paid. Interest is typically calculated daily
but paid monthly.
6.
Discount interest. Most loans call for interest to be paid only after it has been
earned; but banks also lend on a discount basis, where interest is paid in
advance. On a discount loan, the borrower actually receives less than the face
amount of the loan; and this increases its effective cost. We discuss discount
loans in Web Appendix 15B.
7.
Add-on loans. Auto loans and other consumer installment loans are generally
set up on an “add-on basis,” which means that interest charges over the life of
the loan are calculated and then added to the face amount of the loan. Thus,
the borrower signs a promissory note calling for payment of the funds
received plus all interest that must be paid over the life of the loan. The add-on
feature raises the effective cost of a loan.
8.
Collateral. If a loan is secured by equipment, buildings, accounts receivable, or
inventories, this fact is indicated in the note. Security for loans is discussed in
more detail in Section 15-13.
9.
Restrictive covenants. The note may also specify that the borrower must
maintain certain ratios at or better than specified levels, and it spells out what
happens if the borrower defaults on those covenants. Default provisions often
allow the lender to demand immediate payment of the entire loan balance.
Also, the interest rate on the loan might be increased.
10.
Loan guarantees. If the borrower is a small corporation, the bank will probably
insist that its larger stockholders personally guarantee the loan. Troubled
companies’ owners have been known to divert assets from the company to
relatives or other entities they own, so banks protect themselves by obtaining
personal guarantees.
15-10B LINE OF CREDIT
A line of credit is an agreement between a bank and a borrower indicating the
maximum amount of credit the bank will extend to the borrower. For example, in
December, a bank loan officer might indicate to a financial manager that the bank
regards the firm as being “good for” up to $80,000 during the coming year,
provided the borrower’s financial condition does not deteriorate. If on January
10, the financial manager signs a promissory note for $15,000 for 90 days, this

An arrangement in which
a bank agrees to lend up
to a specified maximum
amount of funds during a

would be called “taking down” $15,000 of the credit line. The $15,000 would
be credited to the firm’s checking account; and before it was repaid, the firm
could borrow an additional $65,000 for a total of $80,000. Such a line of credit
would be informal and nonbinding; but formal and binding lines are available,
as discussed next.
15-10C REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT
A revolving credit agreement is a formal line of credit. To illustrate, in 2014, a
Texas petroleum company negotiated a revolving credit agreement for $100
million with a group of banks. The banks were formally committed for 4 years
to lend the firm up to $100 million if the funds were needed. The company, in
turn, paid an annual commitment fee of one-fourth of 1% on the unused balance
of the commitment to compensate the banks for making the commitment. Thus, if
the firm did not take down any of the $100 million commitment during a year, it
would still be required to pay a $250,000 annual fee, normally in monthly install-
ments of $20,833 33. If it borrowed $50 million on the first day of the agreement,
the unused portion of the line of credit would fall to $50 million and the annual fee
would fall to $125,000. Of course, interest would also have to be paid on the
money the firm actually borrowed. In this case, the interest rate on the “revolver”
was pegged to the LIBOR rate, being set at LIBOR minus 0 1 percentage point; so
the cost of the loan would vary over time as interest rates changed.23
Note that a revolving credit agreement is similar to an informal line of credit,
but with an important difference: The bank has a legal obligation to honor a
revolving credit agreement, and it receives a commitment fee. Neither the legal
obligation nor the fee exists under informal lines of credit.
Research by Victoria Ivashina and David Scharfstein suggests that lines of
credit played an important role in the recent financial crisis. They argued that
many corporate borrowers rushed to take down loans under their lines of
credit, because they feared that if the crisis worsened, the banks would not
be able to honor their loan commitments. In some cases, this rush to obtain
credit took valuable funds away from the banks at a time when they needed it
most. This draining of funds arguably diminished the banks’ ability to provide
new loans.24
15-10D COSTS OF BANK LOANS
The costs of bank loans vary for different types of borrowers at any given point in
time and for all borrowers over time. Interest rates are higher for riskier bor-
rowers, and rates are higher on smaller loans because of the fixed costs involved
in making and servicing loans. If a firm can qualify as a “prime credit” because of
its size and financial strength, it can borrow at the prime rate, which at one time
was the lowest rate banks charged. Rates on other loans are generally scaled up
from the prime rate. But loans to large, strong customers are made at rates tied to
LIBOR; and the costs of such loans are generally well below prime:
Rates on June 10, 2013 : Prime: 3 25%; 3-Month LIBOR: 0 28%
23Each bank sets its own prime rate; but because of competitive forces, most banks’ prime rates are
identical. Further, most banks follow the rate set by the large New York City banks.
In recent years, many banks have been lending to large, strong companies at rates below the
prime rate. As we discuss in Section 15-11, larger firms have ready access to the commercial paper
market; and if banks want to do business with these companies, they must match (or at least come
close to) the commercial paper rate.

The rate to smaller, riskier borrowers is generally stated something like “prime
plus 2 5%”; but for a larger borrower such as the Texas oil company, it is generally
stated something like “LIBOR plus 2 5%.”
Bank rates vary widely over time depending on economic conditions and
Federal Reserve policy. When the economy is weak, loan demand is usually slack,
inflation is low, and the Fed makes plenty of money available to the system. As a
result, rates on all types of loans are relatively low. Conversely, when the econ-
omy is booming, loan demand is typically strong, the Fed restricts the money
supply to fight inflation, and the result is high interest rates. As an indication of
the kinds of fluctuations that can occur, the prime rate during 1980 rose from 11%
to 21% in just 4 months and it rose from 6% to 9% during 1994.
Calculating Banks’ Interest Charges: Regular (or Simple) Interest
Banks calculate interest in several different ways. In this section, we explain the
procedure used for most business loans. (We discuss procedures used for con-
sumer and small business loans in Web Appendix 15B.) For illustrative purposes,
we assume a loan of $10,000 at the prime rate (currently 3 25%) with a 360-day
year. Interest must be paid monthly, and the principal is payable “on demand” if
and when the bank wants to end the loan. Such a loan is called a regular, or
simple, interest loan.
We begin by dividing the nominal interest rate (3 25% in this case) by 360 to
calculate the rate per day. The rate is expressed as a decimal fraction, not as a
percentage:
Simple interest rate per day
Nominal rate
Days in year
0 0325 360
0 00009027778
To find the monthly interest payment, the daily rate is multiplied by the amount
of the loan, and then by the number of days during the payment period. For our
illustrative loan, the daily interest charge would be $0 902777778 and the total for
a 30-day month would be $27 08:
Interest charge for month
Rate per day Amount of loan Days in month
0 00009027778 $10,000 30 days
$27 08
The effective interest rate on a loan depends on how frequently interest must be
paid—the more frequently interest is paid, the higher the effective rate. If interest is
paid once a year, the nominal rate also will be the effective rate. However, if interest
must be paid monthly, the effective rate will be 1
0 0325 12 12 −1
3 2989%.
Calculating Banks’ Interest Charges: Add-On Interest
Banks and other lenders typically use add-on interest for automobiles and other
types of installment loans. The term add-on means that the interest is calculated and
then added to the amount borrowed to determine the loan’s face value. To illustrate,
suppose you borrow $10,000 on an add-on basis at a nominal rate of 6 35% to buy a
car, with the loan to be repaid in 12 monthly installments. At a 6 35% add-on rate,
you would make total interest payments of $10,000 0 0635
$635. However,
because the loan is paid off in monthly installments, you would have the use of
the full $10,000 for only the first month; and the outstanding balance would decline
until, during the last month, only 1 12 of the original loan was still outstanding.
Thus, you would be paying $635 for the use of only about half the loan’s face
amount, as the average usable funds would be only about $5,000. Therefore, we
can calculate the approximate annual rate as 12 7%:

The annual percentage rate (APR) the bank would provide to the borrower would
be 11 52%, and the true effective annual rate would be 12 15%. Both of those rates
are far higher than the nominal 6 35%.25
15-11 COMMERCIAL PAPER
Commercial paper is a promissory note issued by a large, strong firm—most often
a financial institution—that wants to borrow on a short-term basis. Commercial
paper is sold primarily to other business firms, insurance companies, pension
funds, money market mutual funds, and banks in denominations of at least
$100,000. It is generally unsecured; but “asset-backed paper” secured by credit
card debt and other small, short-term loans has also been issued. Also (and with
very bad consequences) in 2007, subsidiaries of financial institutions such as
Citigroup sold a great deal of commercial paper and used it to buy bonds backed
by subprime mortgages. This created a situation where short-term commercial
paper was backed by long-term debt—and very poor quality debt at that. When
the real situation was learned, holders of commercial paper refused to roll it over
when it matured and the financial institutions that had sold it were forced to sell
the mortgages that backed the paper, often at huge losses. That forced Citi and
other institutions to bail out their subsidiaries and to take losses in the tens of
billions of dollars.
A large majority of the commercial paper outstanding has been issued by
financial institutions. Nonfinancial companies also issue a great deal of paper, but
they generally rely more heavily on bank loans for short-term funding. For
example, in May 2013, the Federal Reserve reported that commercial paper issued
by nonfinancial firms totaled slightly more than $200 billion—that same month
the total amount of commercial and industrial loans held by commercial banks
was just over $1 548 trillion.

What is a promissory note, and what terms are normally included in promissory
notes?
What is a line of credit? A revolving credit agreement?
What’s the difference between simple interest and add-on interest as bankers
use these terms?
If a firm borrowed $500,000 at a rate of 10% simple interest with monthly
interest payments and a 365-day year, what would be the required interest
payment for a 30-day month? If interest must be paid monthly, what would be
the effective annual rate? ($4,109.59; 10.47%)
If this loan had been made on a 10% add-on basis payable in 12 end-of-month
installments, what would be the monthly payments? What is the annual percen-
tage rate? The effective annual rate? ($45,833.33; 17.97%; 19.53%)
How does the cost of costly trade credit generally compare with the cost of
short-term bank loans?

25To find the annual percentage rate and the effective rate on an add-on loan, we first find the payment
per month, $10,635/12 = $886.25. With a financial calculator, enter N = 12, PV = 10000, PMT = −886.25,
FV = 0; then press I/YR to obtain 0.960108%. This is a monthly rate; so multiply by 12 to get 11.52%,
which is the APR the bank would report to the borrower. The effective annual rate would be
(1.00960108)12 −1 = 12.15%, quite a bit above the APR.

15-12 ACCRUALS (ACCRUED LIABILITIES)
As we discussed in Chapter 3, firms generally pay employees on a weekly,
biweekly, or monthly basis; so the balance sheet typically shows some accrued
wages. Similarly, the firm’s own estimated income taxes, Social Security and
income taxes withheld from employee payrolls, and sales taxes collected are
generally paid on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. Therefore, the balance
sheet typically shows some accrued wages and taxes, which we refer to as
accruals.
Accruals arise automatically from a firm’s operations; hence, they are spon-
taneous funds. For example, if sales grow by 50%, accrued wages and taxes
should also grow by about 50%. Accruals are “free” in the sense that no interest
is paid on them. However, firms cannot control their accruals because the timing
of wage payments is set by contract or industry custom and tax payments are set
by law. Thus, firms use all the accruals they can, but they have little control over
their levels.
15-13 USE OF SECURITY IN SHORT-TERM FINANCING
Other things held constant, borrowers prefer to use unsecured short-term debt
because the bookkeeping costs associated with secured loans are high. However,
firms may find that they can borrow only if they put up collateral to protect the
lender or that securing the loan enables them to borrow at a lower rate.
Stocks and bonds, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, land, and build-
ings can be used as collateral. However, few firms that need loans hold portfolios
of stocks and bonds. Land, buildings, and equipment are good forms of collateral;
but they are generally used to secure long-term loans rather than short-term
working capital loans. Therefore, most secured short-term business loans use
accounts receivable and inventories as collateral.
To understand the use of security, consider the case of a Chicago hardware
dealer who wanted to modernize and expand his store. He requested a
$200,000 loan. After examining his financial statements, the bank indicated
that it would lend him a maximum of $100,000 on an unsecured basis and

that the interest rate would be 10%. However, the company had about
$300,000 of accounts receivable that could be used as collateral; and with the
receivables as security, the bank agreed to lend the full $200,000 and at the
prime rate of 3 25%. Processing costs for administering the loan were fairly
high; but even so, the secured loan was less expensive than an unsecured loan
would have been.26
When the collateral securing a loan is to be kept on the borrower’s
premises, a form called a UCC-1 (Uniform Commercial Code Form 1) is filed
with the secretary of the state in which the collateral is located, along with
a Security Agreement (also part of the Uniform Commercial Code) that
describes the nature of the agreement. The UCC-1 prevents the borrower from
using the same collateral to secure loans from different lenders, and the
security agreement spells out conditions under which the lender can seize
the collateral.
This chapter discussed the management of current assets, including cash,
marketable securities, inventory, and receivables. Current assets are essential,
but there are costs associated with holding them. So if a company can reduce
its current assets without hurting sales, this will increase its profitability. The
investment in current assets must be financed; and this financing can be in
the form of long-term debt, common equity, and/or short-term credit. Firms
typically use trade credit and accruals; they also may use bank debt or com-
mercial paper.
Although current assets and procedures for financing them can be analyzed as
we did in this chapter, decisions are normally made within the context of the firm’s
overall financial plan. We take up financial planning in the next chapter; hence, we
continue our discussion of working capital there.
S E L F T E S T
From the borrower’s standpoint, what are the advantages and disadvantages
of securing a loan?
What two types of current assets are frequently used as security for short-term
loans?
How could borrowers take advantage of lenders if UCC-1s did not exist?
26The term asset-based financing is often used as a synonym for secured financing. In recent years,
accounts receivable have been used as security for long-term bonds, which has permitted
corporations to borrow from lenders such as pension funds rather than being restricted to banks and
other traditional short-term lenders.

RECEIVABLES INVESTMENT
McDowell Industries sells on terms of 3 10, net 30. Total sales
for the year are $912,500; 40% of the customers pay on the 10th day and take discounts,
while the other 60% pay, on average, 40 days after their purchases.
a.
What is the days’ sales outstanding?
b.
What is the average amount of receivables?
c.
What is the percentage cost of trade credit to customers who take the discount?
d.
What is the percentage cost of trade credit to customers who do not take the discount
and pay in 40 days?
e.
What would happen to McDowell’s accounts receivable if it toughened up on its
collection policy with the result that all nondiscount customers paid on the 30th day?

WORKING CAPITAL INVESTMENT
Prestopino Corporation produces motorcycle batteries.
Prestopino turns out 1 500 batteries a day at a cost of $6 per battery for materials and labor. It
takes the firm 22 days to convert raw materials into a battery. Prestopino allows its customers
40 days in which to pay for the batteries, and the firm generally pays its suppliers in 30 days.
a.
What is the length of Prestopino’s cash conversion cycle?
b.
At a steady state in which Prestopino produces 1,500 batteries a day, what amount of
working capital must it finance?
c.
By what amount could Prestopino reduce its working capital financing needs if it was
able to stretch its payables deferral period to 35 days?
d.
Prestopino’s management is trying to analyze the effect of a proposed new production
process on its working capital investment. The new production process would allow
Prestopino to decrease its inventory conversion period to 20 days and to increase its
daily production to 1,800 batteries. However, the new process would cause the cost of
materials and labor to increase to $7. Assuming the change does not affect the average
collection period (40 days) or the payables deferral period (30 days), what will be the
length of its cash conversion cycle and its working capital financing requirement if the
new production process is implemented?
15-7
CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
Christie Corporation is trying to determine the effect of its
inventory turnover ratio and days sales outstanding (DSO) on its cash conversion cycle.
Christie’s 2014 sales (all on credit) were $150,000; its cost of goods sold is 80% of sales; and
it earned a net profit of 6%, or $9,000. It turned over its inventory 6 times during the year,
and its DSO was 36 5 days. The firm had fixed assets totaling $35,000. Christie’s payables
deferral period is 40 days.
a.
Calculate Christie’s cash conversion cycle.
b.
Assuming Christie holds negligible amounts of cash and marketable securities,
calculate its total assets turnover and ROA.
c.
Suppose Christie’s managers believe that the inventory turnover can be raised to 9 0 times.
What would Christie’s cash conversion cycle, total assets turnover, and ROA have
been if the inventory turnover had been 9 0 for 2014?

CURRENT ASSETS INVESTMENT POLICY
Rentz Corporation is investigating the optimal
level of current assets for the coming year. Management expects sales to increase to approxi-
mately $2 million as a result of an asset expansion presently being undertaken. Fixed assets
total $1 million, and the firm plans to maintain a 60% debt-to-assets ratio. Rentz’s interest rate
is currently 8% on both short-term and longer-term debt (which the firm uses in its perma-
nent structure). Three alternatives regarding the projected current assets level are under

LOCKBOX SYSTEM
Hardin-Gehr Corporation (HGC) began operations 5 years ago as a
small firm serving customers in the Detroit area. However, its reputation and market area
grew quickly. Today HGC has customers all over the United States. Despite its broad customer
base, HGC has maintained its headquarters in Detroit; and it keeps its central billing system
there. On average, it takes 5 days from the time customers mail in payments until HGC can
receive, process, and deposit them. HGC would like to set up a lockbox collection system,
which it estimates would reduce the time lag from customer mailing to deposit by 3 days—
bringing it down to 2 days. HGC receives an average of $1,400,000 in payments per day.

How much free cash would HGC generate if it implemented the lockbox system?
Would this be a one-time cash flow or a recurring one, assuming the company ceases to

General and administrative salaries are approximately $27,000 a month. Lease payments
under long-term leases are $9,000 a month. Depreciation charges are $36,000 a month.
Miscellaneous expenses are $2,700 a month. Income tax payments of $63,000 are due in
September and December. A progress payment of $180,000 on a new design studio must be
paid in October. Cash on hand on July 1 will be $132,000, and a minimum cash balance of
$90,000 should be maintained throughout the cash budget period.

Will this affect the cash budget? That is, will the cash budget you prepared be valid

peak financing requirements? No calculations are required, although if you prefer,
you can use calculations to illustrate the effects.

Bowers’ sales are seasonal; and her company produces on a seasonal basis, just ahead of
sales. Without making any calculations, discuss how the company’s current and debt ratios

SKI EQUIPMENT INC.
15-12
MANAGING CURRENT ASSETS
Dan Barnes, financial manager of Ski Equipment Inc. (SKI), is excited,
but apprehensive. The company’s founder recently sold his 51% controlling block of stock to Kent Koren,
who is a big fan of EVA (Economic Value Added). EVA is found by taking the after-tax operating profit
and subtracting the dollar cost of all the capital the firm uses:
EVA
EBIT 1 −T −Annual dollar cost of capital
EBIT 1 −T −WACC
Capital employed
If EVA is positive, the firm is creating value. On the other hand, if EVA is negative, the firm is not
covering its cost of capital and stockholders’ value is being eroded. Koren rewards managers
handsomely if they create value, but those whose operations produce negative EVAs are soon looking
for work. Koren frequently points out that if a company can generate its current level of sales with
fewer assets, it will need less capital. That would, other things held constant, lower capital costs and
increase EVA.
Shortly after he took control, Koren met with SKI’s senior executives to tell them his plans for the
company. First, he presented some EVA data that convinced everyone that SKI had not been creating
value in recent years. He then stated, in no uncertain terms, that this situation must change. He noted
that SKI’s designs of skis, boots, and clothing are acclaimed throughout the industry but that other
aspects of the company must be seriously amiss. Either costs are too high, prices are too low, or the
company employs too much capital; and he expects SKI’s managers to identify and correct the problem.
Barnes has long believed that SKI’s working capital situation should be studied—the company may
have the optimal amounts of cash, securities, receivables, and inventories; but it may also have too much
or too little of these items. In the past, the production manager resisted Barnes’s efforts to question his
holdings of raw materials inventories, the marketing manager resisted questions about finished goods,
the sales staff resisted questions about credit policy (which affects accounts receivable), and the treasurer
did not want to talk about her cash and securities balances. Koren’s speech made it clear that such
resistance would no longer be tolerated.
Barnes also knows that decisions about working capital cannot be made in a vacuum. For example,
if inventories could be lowered without adversely affecting operations, less capital would be required,
the dollar cost of capital would decline, and EVA would increase. However, lower raw materials
inventories might lead to production slowdowns and higher costs, while lower finished goods inventories

might lead to the loss of profitable sales. So before inventories are changed, it will be necessary to study
operating as well as financial effects. The situation is the same with regard to cash and receivables.
a. Barnes plans to use the ratios in Table IC 15.1 as the starting point for discussions with SKI’s operating
executives. He wants everyone to think about the pros and cons of changing each type of current asset
and the way changes would interact to affect profits and EVA. Based on the data in Table IC 15.1, does
SKI seem to be following a relaxed, moderate, or restricted current assets investment policy?
b. How can we distinguish between a relaxed but rational current assets investment policy and a
situation where a firm has a large amount of current assets due to inefficiency? Does SKI’s current
assets investment policy seem appropriate? Explain.
c. SKI tries to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities. Describe how SKI could adopt a more
aggressive or a more conservative financing policy.
d. Assume that SKI’s payables deferral period is 30 days. Now calculate the firm’s cash conversion
cycle estimating the inventory conversion period as 365/Inventory turnover.
e. What might SKI do to reduce its cash and securities without harming operations?
In an attempt to better understand SKI’s cash position, Barnes developed a cash budget. Data for the
first 2 months of the year are shown in Table IC 15.2. (Note that Barnes’s preliminary cash budget does
not account for interest income or interest expense.) He has the figures for the other months, but they are
not shown in Table IC 15.2.
f. In his preliminary cash budget, Barnes has assumed that all sales are collected and, thus, that SKI has
no bad debts. Is this realistic? If not, how would bad debts be dealt with in a cash budgeting sense?
(Hint: Bad debts affect collections but not purchases.)
g. Barnes’s cash budget for the entire year, although not given here, is based heavily on his forecast for
monthly sales. Sales are expected to be extremely low between May and September but then increase
dramatically in the fall and winter. November is typically the firm’s best month, when SKI ships
equipment to retailers for the holiday season. Interestingly, Barnes’s forecasted cash budget indicates
that the company’s cash holdings will exceed the targeted cash balance every month except October
and November, when shipments will be high but collections will not be coming in until later. Based
on the ratios in Table IC 15.1, does it appear that SKI’s target cash balance is appropriate? In addition
to possibly lowering the target cash balance, what actions might SKI take to better improve its cash
management policies and how might that affect its EVA?
h. Is there any reason to think that SKI may be holding too much inventory? If so, how would that
affect EVA and ROE?
i. If the company reduces its inventory without adversely affecting sales, what effect should this have
on the company’s cash position (1) in the short run and (2) in the long run? Explain in terms of the
cash budget and the balance sheet.
j. Barnes knows that SKI sells on the same credit terms as other firms in the industry. Use the ratios
presented in Table IC 15.1 to explain whether SKI’s customers pay more or less promptly than those
of its competitors. If there are differences, does that suggest that SKI should restrict or relax its credit
policy? What four variables make up a firm’s credit policy, and in what direction should each be
changed by SKI?
k. Does SKI face any risks if it restricts its credit policy? Explain.
l. If the company reduces its DSO without seriously affecting sales, what effect will this have on its
cash position (1) in the short run and (2) in the long run? Answer in terms of the cash budget
and the balance sheet. What effect should this have on EVA in the long run?
m. Assume that SKI buys on terms of 1 10, net 30, but that it can get away with paying on the 40th day if it
chooses not to take discounts. Also assume that it purchases $3 million of components per year, net of
discounts. How much free trade credit can the company get, how much costly trade credit can it get, and
what is the percentage cost of the costly credit? Should SKI take discounts? Why or why not?
n. Suppose SKI decided to raise an additional $100,000 as a 1-year loan from its bank, for which it was
quoted a rate of 8%. What is the effective annual cost rate assuming simple interest and add-on
interest on a 12-month installment loan?

Effective Forecasting Is Even More Important During Volatile Times
In February 2010, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt began
his letter to shareholders with the following
statement:
Time magazine called this era “The Decade
from Hell,” and “when you are going through
hell,” Winston Churchill advised, “keep going.”
The previous few years had been rough for
GE. Its reported net income at year-end 2009
was roughly half of what it was two years earlier,
and its stock had significantly underperformed
the overall market—its share price had gone
from $38 per share in April 2008 to less than
$15 per share in early July 2010. Nevertheless,
Immelt was quick to stress that GE was still
profitable and (hopefully) well positioned for
the future.
Indeed, a year later, in early 2011, Immelt
was happy to report that GE was beginning to
turn things around. During 2010, its earnings
grew 15%, and the company twice increased
its dividend. By July 2011, GE’s stock was trading
around $19 per share—which was still only half
of where it had been three years earlier; how-
ever, it was nevertheless moving in the right
direction.
As GE knows all too well, the economic
environment is always changing, which makes
it difficult to develop reasonable forecasts of the
company’s future performance. Forecasting has
become increasingly challenging given the tre-
mendous volatility in the economy and financial
markets during the past few years. With num-
bers changing faster than you can update your
forecasts, it is tempting to throw your hands up
and say “Why bother?” Expressing this senti-
ment, UPS’s CFO, Kurt Kuehn, recently was
quoted saying:

“Normally, we are very obsessive about building good and
accurate plans,” he says, but as the recession dragged on, “we
realized that trying to build a forecast was almost a waste of
time. We didn’t have enough precedent or trends to do
anything viable.”
Despite this urge to throw in the towel, during volatile
times effective forecasting is more important than ever. Well-
run companies know that you can’t just operate on auto-pilot
and assume that next year will be like last year. Indeed, under
Kuehn’s guidance, UPS has taken this opportunity to adopt a
more expansive and flexible approach in setting its budget.
So far, the results appear to have paid off—the company’s
earnings and stock price have steadily increased over the past
three years.
Likewise, GE has continued to rethink many of its lines of
business and has developed specific metrics to evaluate its
performance.
Immelt summarized some of these changes in his 2012
report:
Last year, we set focused execution goals for GE: double-digit
industrial earnings growth; margin expansion; restarting the
GE Capital dividend to the parent; reducing the size of GE
Capital; and balanced capital allocation. We achieved all of
our goals for the year.
Notwithstanding their strong track record, both UPS and GE
know that you can never rest on your laurels, and effective
financial forecasting is an important component of continued
success.

Yogi Berra, the former player and manager for the New York Yankees, once said,
“You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you're going, because you
might not get there.” That’s certainly true for a company—it needs a plan, one that
starts with the firm’s general goals and details the steps that will be taken to get there.
When you finish this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Discuss the importance of strategic planning and the central role that financial
forecasting plays in the overall planning process.
•
Explain how firms forecast sales.
•
Use the Additional Funds Needed (or AFN) equation and discuss the
relationship between asset growth and the need for funds.
•
Explain how spreadsheets are used in the forecasting process, starting with
historical statements, ending with projected statements, and including a set of
financial ratios based on those projected statements.
•
Discuss how planning is an iterative process.
Financial planners begin with a set of assumptions, see what is likely to happen
based on those assumptions, and then see if modifications can help the firm
achieve better results. Although we focus on forecasting from the corporation’s
standpoint, top security analysts go through the same process. Analysts with
hedge and private equity funds are especially active as forecasters, and they are
particularly interested in the iterative process of forecasting.
16-1 STRATEGIC PLANNING
Management textbooks often list the following as the key elements of a strategic plan:
•
Mission Statement. Many but not all firms articulate a mission statement. For
example, here is Pepsi’s mission statement:1

Our mission is to be the world’s premier consumer products company focused on
convenient foods and beverages. We seek to produce financial rewards to investors as we
provide opportunities for growth and enrichment to our employees, our business partners
and the communities in which we operate. And in everything we do, we strive for honesty,
fairness and integrity.
GE does not have one, but it states that its chairman’s letter in the annual
report serves this purpose. In his letter, Jeffrey Immelt discusses his goals for
GE’s major businesses and for the firm as a whole.
•
Corporate Scope. Corporate scope defines the lines of business the firm plans to
pursue and the geographic areas in which it will operate. Some firms
deliberately limit their scope, on the theory that it is better for top managers to
focus sharply on a narrow range of functions as opposed to spreading the
company over many different types of businesses. Academics have studied
which is the better choice. Some studies suggest that investors generally value
focused firms more highly than diversified ones.2 However, if a firm is
successful in combining a group of diversified businesses so that they help one
another, as GE tries to do, the result may be synergistic effects that raise the
value of the overall enterprise.3 In any event, the stated corporate scope
should be logical and consistent with the firm’s capabilities.
•
Statement of Corporate Objectives. A firm’s statement of corporate objectives is
that part of the corporate plan that sets forth the specific goals that operating
managers are expected to meet. Like most firms, GE has both qualitative and
quantitative objectives. GE has a history of selling business units that do not
meet its objectives and of replacing underperforming managers, but GE also
rewards managers generously when they meet their targets.
•
Corporate Strategies. GE has several broad corporate strategies. One is to be
highly diversified by both products and geographic scope in order to achieve
earnings stability and financial strength. Its management believes that financial
strength will lead to a low cost of capital, which will benefit all its units. Also,
because GE’s management believes that the company should be at the forefront
in addressing environmental issues, it is investing heavily in infrastructure
technologies to purify air and water. Immelt expects to do good by doing good.
•
Operating Plan. Each of GE’s units must develop a detailed operating plan
that is consistent with the corporate strategy to help it achieve the firm’s
objectives. Operating plans can be developed for any time horizon, but most
companies use a 5-year horizon. The plan explains in considerable detail the
people responsible for each particular function, deadlines for specific tasks,
sales and profit targets, and the like.
•
Financial Plan. Financial planning is a multistep process. Allied’s financial
plan involves four steps. First, assumptions are made about the future levels
of sales, costs, interest rates, and so forth, for use in the forecast. Second, a set
2See, for example, Philip G. Berger and Eli Ofek, “Diversification’s Effect on Firm Value,” Journal of
Financial Economics, vol. 37, no. 1 (1995), pp. 39–66; and Larry Lang and René Stulz, “Tobin’s Q,
Corporate Diversification, and Firm Performance,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 102, no. 6 (1994),
pp. 1248–1280.
3The dictionary definition of synergy is a situation where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and
it’s sometimes called the 2 + 2 = 5 effect. GE has a jet engine business and another business that produces
gas turbines for electric power generation. Those businesses are similar enough so that new developments
in one can benefit the other. One has to wonder, though, how GE’s jet engine business benefited the NBC-
Universal (NBCU) entertainment unit. GE’s management argues that its diversification stabilizes its
revenues and profits and that this resulted in a triple-A bond rating and a relatively low cost of capital
for all its businesses. A number of academic studies dispute this conclusion, though, with the academics
arguing that it is easy for stockholders to diversify and better to have top managers focus on one business.
Perhaps with these concerns in mind, in 2010, GE’s management reached the conclusion that some of its
assets were not creating synergistic benefits, and so it sold some of those assets—including giving up a
51% ownership stake in NBCU to Comcast. In fact, by March 19, 2013, Comcast purchased the remaining
49% ownership stake so NBC–Universal is now a subsidiary of Comcast.

of projected financial statements is developed. Third, projected ratios such as
those discussed in Chapter 4 are calculated and analyzed. Fourth, the entire
plan is reexamined, the assumptions are reviewed, and the management team
considers how additional changes in operations might improve results. This
last step requires reconsideration of all the earlier parts of the overall plan,
from the mission statement to the operating plan. Thus, the financial plan ties
the entire planning process together.
Financial planning as described previously is often called value-based management,
meaning that the effects of various decisions on the firm’s financial position and value
are studied by simulating their effects within the firm’s financial model. For example,
if GE was considering a shift in appliance manufacturing from Kentucky to Mexico,
it would simulate the effects through its financial model and then make the move if
it appeared that profits and thus shareholder wealth would be increased.4
16-2 THE SALES FORECAST
Financial plans generally begin with a sales forecast, which starts with a review of sales
during the past 5 years, shown as a graph such as the one in Figure 16.1 for Allied
Foods. These numbers are based on Allied’s financial statements, which were first
presented in Chapter 3. The data below the graph show 5 years of historical sales.
Allied had its ups and downs from 2010 through 2014. In 2012, poor weather in
California’s fruit-producing regions resulted in below-average crops, which caused
2012 sales to fall below the 2011 level. Then a bumper crop in 2013 pushed sales up
by 15%, an unusually high growth rate for a mature food processor. The compound
annual growth rate over the 4-year period was 9 88%.5 Due to planned new
products, increased production, distribution capacity, a new advertising campaign,
and other factors, management expects the growth rate to increase slightly, to 10%,
in 2015. Therefore, sales should rise from $3,000 million to $3,300 million.
Of course, management likes higher sales growth, but not at any cost. For exam-
ple, sales could be increased by cutting prices, spending more on advertising, granting
easier credit, and the like. However, all of those actions would have a cost. Also, sales
growth cannot occur without a concurrent increase in capacity, and that too is costly.
So the sales growth must be balanced against the cost of achieving that growth.
If the sales forecast is off, the consequences can be serious. First, if the market
expands by more than Allied expects, it will not be able to meet demand, its
customers will buy from competitors, and it will lose market share. On the other
hand, if its projections are overly optimistic, Allied could end up with too much
plant, equipment, and inventory, leading to low turnover ratios, high costs for

4Note, however, that there would surely be political ramifications to such a move. These effects would
be studied by use of the model, and the computer-generated results would be an input in the decision.
However, the ultimate decision would be made by GE’s top executives and board, not, in essence, by a
computer.

inputs as follows: N = 4, PV = −2058, PMT = 0, and FV = 3000. Then, solve for I/YR = 9.88%, which is
the growth rate in sales during this period.

depreciation and storage, and write-offs of spoiled inventory. This would result in
low profits and a depressed stock price. Moreover, if Allied financed its expansion
with debt, high interest expenses would compound the firm’s problems.
Finally, note that the sales forecast is the most important input in the firm’s
forecast of financial statements, including the projected EPS, which we cover in
Section 16-4. The importance of the sales forecast is highlighted when we forecast
the financial statements.
16-3 THE AFN EQUATION
We saw in Chapter 3 that in 2014, Allied had assets of $2,000 million and sales
of $3,000 million. Thus, it required $2,000 $3,000
$0 6667 of assets to generate
each dollar of sales. Moreover, the company plans to increase sales by 10%, or
$300 million, in 2015:

Assuming the assets-to-sales ratio remains constant, Allied will need an additional
$200 million of assets to support the $300 million increase in sales:
Required increase in assets
0 6667
Sales
0 6667 $300
$200 million
Note that if growth is low (say, 0%), ΔSales will be zero and there will be no
required increase in assets. On the other hand, if sales grow very rapidly, the
requirement for additional assets will be large. Thus, the increase in assets is
fundamentally dependent on the growth rate in sales.
Naturally, if assets are to grow by $200 million, liabilities and equity must also
grow by the same amount—the balance sheet must balance. But from where will
this capital come? Here are a firm’s primary capital sources:
1.
Spontaneous Increases in Accounts Payable and Accruals. Allied must make
additional purchases to increase its inventories, and it must hire more
workers. Its purchases will automatically lead to additional accounts payable,
which amount to “loans” from its suppliers. Also, hiring more workers will
automatically lead to higher accrued wages, which amount to short-term
“loans” from its workers. Hence, some of the required $200 million will come
spontaneously from suppliers and workers—this is called spontaneously
generated funds. Also, assuming profit margins are maintained, higher sales
will mean higher profits and thus higher taxes and accrued taxes. So
“spontaneous” increases in payables, accrued wages, and accrued taxes will
take care of part of the required $200 million.
2.
Addition to Retained Earnings. Assuming Allied has positive earnings and does
not pay out all of those earnings as dividends, its retained earnings will grow.
The addition to retained earnings depends on the firm’s profit margin and its
retention ratio, which is the proportion of net income that is reinvested in the
firm. This addition to retained earnings will help finance growth.
3.
AFN: Additional Funds Needed. It is possible that spontaneous funds and
additional retained earnings will offset the forecasted increase in assets.
Normally, though, that situation does not occur—normally, there is a shortfall,
called Additional Funds Needed (AFN), which has to be made up by
additional borrowing and/or the sale of new stock. Note, though, that if a
company is growing very slowly and thus not increasing assets very much, its
spontaneous funds plus its addition to retained earnings may be larger than
the required increase in assets. In that case, the AFN is negative, indicating
that a surplus of capital is forecasted.
We can combine these concepts to develop Equation 16.1, the AFN equation. AFN
is the total amount of new interest-bearing debt and preferred and common stock
the firm must issue to support its planned growth.6

6The term additional funds needed was developed to show how much additional capital a firm needs to
support its planned growth. However, as we see later, a firm may be able to grow without any
additional outside capital. In fact, the firm may even generate excess capital that can be used to retire
debt, repurchase stock, and raise the dividend. In this case, the calculated AFN will be negative. Also,
in this chapter we do quite a few calculations and generally round when we show results. This may
lead to minor “rounding differences,” which you should disregard.

especially important for two reasons: (1) The national credit crunch is constraining
the firm’s ability to raise capital, so the amounts needed and available must be
determined. (2) Corporate raiders and private equity firms have targeted a num-
ber of food processors; and when they take over, heads roll in the acquired firm.
Allied’s executives are aware of both factors.
Allied’s CFO plans to proceed in two steps. First, he will use the AFN equation
to give the others an idea of how much new capital the firm will need to support the
targeted 10% growth rate, assuming the various operating ratios remain constant.
Second, he will present the results of a full-scale financial planning model. The
model shows forecasted financial statements in addition to a set of forecasted ratios
like those discussed in Chapter 4, along with an estimate of the 2015 EPS.
The CFO brought copies of Table 16.1, which is based on Equation 16.1, and
data from the financial statements presented in Chapter 3 to the Executive Com-
mittee.7 Part I of the table picks up selected data from the 2014 balance sheet and
income statement. Part II uses the Part I data to calculate inputs for Equation 16.1.
Note that all the calculations in Part II assume that the company’s operating ratios
in 2015 continue at 2014 levels. Part III uses the items calculated in Part II to
calculate the AFN. To increase sales by $300 million, Allied must increase assets
by $200 million. The asset increase will be supported by $20 million from sponta-
neous increases in payables and accruals, and another $66 million will come from
retained earnings. In total, $114 million of new outside funds will be needed; and
since Allied does not use preferred stock, the amount must come from interest-
bearing debt in addition to new common stock.
As noted, the AFN equation assumes that the 2015 ratios will remain constant
at the 2014 levels.8 If economic conditions or managerial decisions cause the ratios
to change, the forecasted AFN will change. Part IV of the table shows how some
specific input changes will change the forecasted AFN. For example, if the target
growth rate was increased from 10% to 15% with other things held constant, the
AFN would increase from $114 million to $201 million. On the other hand, if the
target growth rate was lowered to 5%, the AFN would be only $27 million. Also,
as shown in Part V, if the company grew at a rate of 3 45% while other things were
held constant, AFN would be zero. Thus, 3 45% is called Allied’s sustainable
growth rate. As you can see from the model, the sustainable growth rate can be
easily estimated using the Goal Seek tool in Excel. Finally, note that if the growth
rate slowed and other inputs were changed in the manner specified in Part IV of
the table, Allied would end up with a large negative AFN, indicating that retained
earnings and spontaneous capital were far more than sufficient to finance the now
smaller amount of additional assets needed.
7The CFO also loaded the Excel model on his laptop so he could do on-the-spot sensitivity analyses. For
example, he could change the growth rate and instantly find the new AFN. Similarly, he could change
the dividend payout ratio, the profit margin, and the other variables to see how those changes would
affect the firm’s capital requirements. Still, the analysis in Table 16.1 provided a useful starting point.
8This assumption helps simplify the AFN calculation, but in many instances it is not completely
realistic. For example, in any given year, fixed assets may not grow at the same rate as sales. With
this concern in mind, some analysts use the following alternative AFN equation:
AFN
Sales-driven current assets Sales
Sales
Fixed assets
Sales-driven current liabilities Sales
Sales
Retained earnings
In this alternative equation, sales-driven current assets are items such as accounts receivable and
inventory, both of which are likely to grow at the same rate as sales. Likewise, sales-driven current
liabilities are items such as accounts payable and accruals that are also likely to grow at the same rate
as sales. (These are equivalent to the spontaneous liabilities described in the standard (simplified)
AFN equation.) While slightly more complicated, this alternative equation is more flexible and
arguably provides a more accurate forecasting tool than the simplified AFN equation. However, in
all of our subsequent examples and end-of-chapter problems we will use the simplified AFN equation
(Equation 16.1) that is presented in the text.
If you are looking for more details regarding this alternative AFN equation, see Wallace N. Davidson,
III, Financial Forecasting and Management Decisions (New York: AICPA, 2009).
Sustainable Growth Rate
The maximum achievable
growth rate without the
firm having to raise
external funds. In other
words, it is the growth
rate at which the firm’s
AFN equals zero.

16-3A EXCESS CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS
The AFN equation includes the term A0 S0, which is called the capital intensity
ratio. For Allied, this ratio is calculated as $2,000 $3,000
0 6667. When multiplied
by ΔS
$300 million, this ratio indicated that Allied must increase its assets by
$200 million. However, the CFO thought that in 2014, Allied had more fixed assets
than it really needed; he wanted to demonstrate to the Executive Committee how
excess capacity adjustments might affect the firm’s need for external funds. He
noted that Allied had $1,000 million of current assets and $1,000 million of fixed
assets; so he split A0 S0 into two parts, one for fixed assets and one for current assets:
Current assets: A0 C S0
$1,000 $3,000
0 333
33 3%
Fixed assets: A0 F S0
$1,000 $3,000

any additions to fixed assets were required versus the actual $3,000 million of
sales. In this example, the calculated $3,125 million sales is Allied’s full capacity
sales:
Full capacity sales
Actual sales
Percentage of capacity
at which fixed assets
were operated
$3,000 million 0 96
$3,125 million
This indicates that Allied’s Target fixed assets/Sales ratio should be 32% rather
than the indicated 33.3% calculated previously:
Target fixed assets
Sales
Actual fixed assets
Full capacity sales
$1,000 $3,125
0 32
32%
Under these conditions, sales could increase to $3,125 million with no increase in
fixed assets and a sales increase to $3,300 million would require only $1,056
million of fixed assets, or an additional $56 million of fixed assets:
Required level of fixed assets
Target fixed assets Sales Projected sales
0 32 $3,300
$1,056 million
Earlier estimate of fixed assets
1 1 $1,000
$1,100 million
Difference in fixed assets needed
$44 million
Thus, the existence of excess capacity in its fixed assets would lower Allied’s
required AFN from $114 million to $114 million
$44 million
$70 million.
A similar situation could occur with respect to inventories, cash, or any other
asset. Moreover, the L0 S0 ratio could be increased if the firm negotiated longer
credit terms for its purchases. Similarly, it might be possible for Allied to improve
its profit margin or to lower its dividend payout ratio. Because so many conditions
can change, it is useful to go beyond the AFN equation analysis and construct
Allied’s forecasted financial statements, the topic of the next section. Also, we
want to know how good or bad the firm’s financial ratios will be and what the
impact will be on its EPS. The AFN tells us nothing about those things, but
the forecasted financial statements do.

16-4 FORECASTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS9
The AFN equation provides useful insights into the forecasting process—if you
understand the AFN, you will find it easier to understand forecasted financial
statements. Therefore, Allied’s CFO used the AFN calculations in Table 16.1 as a
warm up for his presentation of the forecasted 2015 financial statements. We
describe how he developed the forecast presented in Table 16.2 in this section.

16-4A PART I. INPUTS
Rows 4 through 9 show the basic inputs, or assumptions, used in the forecast. The
CFO had met previously with the CEO and other top executives. They had
reviewed the ratio analysis developed in Chapter 4 and concluded that improve-
ments must be made in 2015. Otherwise, a private equity buyer or hedge fund
might decide to take over the firm; and if that occurred, the executives would
probably lose their jobs.
Adjustable Inputs
The inputs in Column C show key 2014 ratios that management controls and
that may be adjusted in the future. Column D gives the values the CFO used
for the initial 2015 forecast, and Column E gives industry average numbers.
The first input shown is the growth rate. This number can be changed; but
throughout Table 16.2, a 10% growth rate is assumed. Next, we have the
Operating costs/Sales ratio. Allied’s ratio in 2014 was 90 54%, which is higher
than the industry’s 87% ratio. A reduction toward the industry average would
lead to a substantial improvement in net income, and the CFO used a ratio of
89 5% as a tentative target for 2015. Next, we saw in Chapter 4 that Allied’s
receivables and inventories were too high relative to its sales. If those accounts
can be reduced, the result will be lower bad debts and storage costs and thus
increased profits. Also, the excess capital invested in receivables and inventories
can be released and used to pay off debt and/or to repurchase common stock,
both of which would improve the firm’s ROE and EPS. Again, the CFO set initial
targets between Allied’s 2014 ratios and the industry averages.
In addition, Allied’s equity/assets ratio, at 47%, is significantly less than the
industry average, and the firm’s bankers have complained and indicated that the
cost of debt would decline if this ratio were increased. Security analysts also have
stated that Allied’s stock is riskier than it would be if it had less debt, and that
adversely affects its price/earnings (P/E) ratio. With these concerns in mind, Allied
has established a target equity/assets ratio of 51%, which implies that Allied’s
target total liabilities/assets ratio is 49%.
Similarly, Allied’s dividend payout ratio is higher than the industry average,
and the CEO and several board members think it should be lowered. This would
provide more funds to support growth, which stockholders may want.
Fixed Inputs
Some other inputs required for the forecast are not under management’s direct
control or are not expected to change. These inputs are shown in Column G and
include the tax rate, the interest rate, the shares initially outstanding, the initial
stock price, and the Fixed assets/Sales ratio, which the CFO concluded was fine.
The number of shares outstanding will change in 2015 depending on how much
new equity the firm must raise. The amount of additional interest-bearing debt
is dependent on the increase in spontaneous funds generated, the target total
liabilities/assets ratio, and the increase in assets. Allied’s management decided
to keep the same proportion of notes payable and long-term debt in 2015 as it had
in 2014. Of course, management hopes the stock price will increase as a result of
the firm’s actions and improved financial position, but the CFO wisely decided
not to make a prediction at this point.
16-4B PART II. FORECASTED INCOME STATEMENT
The forecasted 2015 income statement starts with the 2014 income statement, but
forecasts that 2015 sales will grow by 10%. Next, the assumed new operating cost
ratio is multiplied by the new sales level to calculate the forecasted 2015 operating
costs, which are subtracted from sales to obtain the forecasted EBIT. Interest
expenses are calculated in Part V, the Notes section, after the interest-bearing debt

has been determined in the balance sheet developed in Part III.10 Once the interest
expense has been calculated and entered in the income statement, the forecasted
net income is determined. Dividends for 2015 are found by multiplying the target
payout ratio by the 2015 forecasted net income. Dividends are then subtracted
from net income to find the 2015 addition to retained earnings.
16-4C PART III. FORECASTED BALANCE SHEET
The forecasted 2015 balance sheet is developed from the 2014 statement. Cash and
fixed assets are multiplied by 1 10 because they increase at the same rate as sales
growth. Accounts receivable are found by multiplying the assumed 11% Receiva-
bles/Sales ratio (given in Part I) by forecasted 2015 sales, and inventories are found
by multiplying the 19% Inventories/Sales ratio (also given in Part I) by forecasted
2015 sales. We then sum the four asset accounts to find forecasted 2015 total assets.
On the liabilities side, because payables and accruals grow at the same rate as
sales, we multiply the 2014 values by 1 10. Also, 2015 retained earnings are found
by adding the 2015 addition to retained earnings from the income statement to
2014 retained earnings. To complete the balance sheet, we need to find the
amounts for short-term bank loans, bonds, and new common stock. To obtain
those values, we skip down to Part V, the Notes section. Here we multiply the
target total liabilities/assets ratio times the forecasted 2015 total assets to obtain
the forecasted total liabilities amount. We then subtract payables and accruals
from this amount to find the forecast for interest-bearing debt (which includes
bank loans and bonds). Next, we multiply the interest-bearing debt by the 2014
proportions of bank debt and long-term bonds to find the forecasted amounts
for those two items. Similarly, we find the required amount of 2015 total equity
by multiplying
1 −target total liabilities assets ratio
times the 2015 forecasted
assets. We then subtract forecasted retained earnings to find 2015 common stock,
which we insert in the balance sheet. When we sum the liability and equity
accounts, the total matches the forecasted assets, which it must.
16-4D PART IV. RATIOS AND EPS
With the 2015 income statement and balance sheet forecasted, we can calculate the
forecasted 2015 ratios and EPS; those calculations are done in Part IV. The first five
ratios shown are the same ones given in the Part I Inputs section. We calculated
them from the forecasted statement as a check on the accuracy of the model.
An interesting aspect of Part IV is the DuPont calculations. In 2014, Allied’s
profit margin and turnover were quite low, but its equity multiplier was relatively
high. The result was a low but risky 12 5% ROE. The forecast for 2015 shows
improvements in the profit margin and turnover, which boost ROE, and a low-
ering of the equity multiplier, which holds down the ROE but indicates less
financial risk. The result is a much better and less risky 14 9% ROE, which is very
close to the industry average.
The final item in Part IV is the forecasted EPS, which jumps from $2 35 in 2014
to $3 06 in 2015. The CFO calculated the following data for use in his talk but
decided not to include it in the table:
P E ratio
9 8
versus 11 3
for the industry
Current stock price
$23 06
Allied’s estimated 2015 stock price is then calculated by multiplying its forecasted
EPS by the industry average P/E ratio:11
$3 06 11 3
$34 58
Percentage gain $34 58 $23 06
1
49 96%, or approximately 50%
10Here, we are implicitly assuming that the yield curve is flat, so interest rates on long-term and short-
term debt are the same.
11Refer to Table 4.2 in Chapter 4 for Allied’s P/E ratio and the industry average P/E ratio.

16-4E USING THE FORECAST TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS
Allied’s CFO generated Table 16.2 with a straightforward Excel model. The table
could have been worked with a calculator, but it was easier to do the work using
Excel. Moreover and very importantly, once he developed the model, he could
make all kinds of changes to see the forecasted results under alternative scenarios.
It’s easy to change the growth rate and the five key input variables in Part I. It
would be easy to change the financing assumptions, perhaps using more bank
loans and fewer bonds. It also would be easy to show the results of financing only
with debt or only with stock. With any such input changes, the model instantly
provides modified results. Indeed, the CFO had the model on his laptop, took it to
the meeting, and answered a number of “what if” questions. In fact, Excel’s Data
Tab contains “What If” Analysis tools such as Scenario Manager, Goal Seek, and
Data Tables. Throughout the Excel chapter models developed for this text, we
have used Goal Seek and Data Tables.12
Of course, it’s much easier to change inputs in a spreadsheet model than it is
to change actual operations so that the forecasted results are generated. However,
as we said earlier in the chapter, if you don’t know where you’re going, it’s hard to
get there. Allied’s ratio analysis in Chapter 4 pointed out the firm’s weaknesses,
and the model shown in Table 16.2 demonstrates how improvements in the driver
variables will affect the firm’s ROE, its EPS, and (of course) its stock price. Allied’s
managers’ compensation is partly based on the firm’s financial results, including
its ROE and stock price, so they are keenly interested in the model and its results.
The threat of firing is also a strong motivator, and obtaining poor results while
operating good assets makes the firing of management a real possibility.
16-5 USING REGRESSION TO IMPROVE FORECASTS13
In financial statement forecasts, it is often appropriate to assume that most of the
assets increase at the same rate as sales. However, that is often not the case. We
noted in our discussion of the AFN equation that excess capacity might exist, in
which case assets would increase less rapidly than sales. Similarly, economies of
scale might exist, and this too could enable sales to increase less rapidly than
assets. We can use regression techniques to investigate the existence of such
situations and thus improve the financial forecasts.
To illustrate regression analysis, consider Figure 16.2, which shows Allied’s
sales, inventories, and receivables during the last 5 years and scatter diagrams of
inventories and receivables versus sales. Estimated regression equations, found
with a financial calculator or spreadsheet, can be developed. For example, here is
the estimated relationship between inventories and sales (in millions of dollars):
Inventories
$35 7
0 186 Sales
S E L F T E S T
What advantages does the forecasted financial statement method have over
the AFN equation for forecasting financial requirements?
Why should a marketing or management major be interested in financial
forecasting?
Would financial forecasting be relevant for nonfinance majors when they
graduate and enter the workforce? Explain.
12Scenario Manager is a little more complicated to use, so we leave that tool for the more advanced
Excel user.

We can use the regression equation to estimate the 2015 inventory level. Because
2015 sales are projected at $3,300 million, according to the regression, 2015
inventories should be $578 million:
Inventories
$35 7
0 186 $3,300
$578 million
This estimate based on the regression equation is $49 million less than
the $627 million forecast used in the projected financial statements in Part III of
Table 16.2. Note also that although our graph shows a linear relationship between
sales and inventories, we could have used a nonlinear regression model had we
believed that such a relationship was more appropriate. Also, we could have used
a multiple regression equation, which would have brought other factors that affect
inventories into the picture.
16-6 ANALYZING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING RATIOS
When we forecasted the 2015 financial statements, we assumed that the 2015
operating ratios would move closer to the industry averages and we based asset
levels on those assumptions. However, it is often preferable to base forecasted

assets on a regression analysis. Also, it is often useful to examine specific asset
ratios to get a better idea of the effects on the firm’s financial position given
various changes to these ratios. In this section, we explore the effects of modifying
receivable and inventory ratios.
16-6A MODIFYING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
In Table 16.2, Allied’s DSO is projected to be 40 15 days versus an industry
average 36 days. Its sales per day are projected to be $3,300 365
$9 04 million.
If Allied could operate at the industry-average DSO, its receivables would be
reduced by
Receivables at 40 15 day
40 15 $9 04
$363 0 million
Receivables at 36 00 days
36 00 $9 04
$325 5 million
Receivables reduction
Additional 2015 FCF
$ 37 5 million
Thus, receivables could be reduced by another $37 5 million if Allied’s credit
manager could achieve the industry-average DSO. That would mean $37 5 million
of additional free cash flow to the firm in 2015, plus additional FCF going forward
as Allied grows. The CFO could use this example in a discussion with Allied’s
credit manager.
16-6B MODIFYING INVENTORIES
Inventories can be analyzed in a similar manner. First, note that Allied’s forecasted
inventory turnover is 5 26 times versus 10 9 times for the industry. Moreover, in
Table 16.2, Allied’s forecasted 2015 inventory is $627 million versus $3,300 million
of sales. Given this information, we can find Allied’s inventories if Allied is able to
achieve the industry-average inventory turnover:
Currently forecasted inventory turnover
$3,300 5 26
$627 million
Inventory at industry-average turnover
$3,300 10 9
$303 million
Inventory reduction
Additional 2015 FCF
$324 million
Thus, inventories could be reduced by another $324 million if Allied’s inventory
turnover could be increased to the industry average. That would mean another
$324 million of free cash flow in 2015, plus further additions going forward. Again,
the CFO could use this example in a discussion with the inventory manager.
16-6C OTHER “SPECIAL STUDIES”
Once a firm has developed a model to forecast its financial statements, it can do all
types of special “what if” studies. For example, the model that Allied’s CFO used
to make Table 16.2 (which is part of the chapter Excel model) could be used to find
the results shown in the two preceding sections for receivables and inventories.
The model also could be used to estimate the effects of changing the dividend
policy on the statements and on the required AFN. Indeed, the AFN equation
could be modified to obtain a “quick and dirty” estimate of the effects of the
dividend payout on the AFN. As we saw earlier in Section 16-3 in the discussion
of the AFN equation, Allied has a payout ratio of 0 4894; and when that number
was used in the equation, an AFN of $114 million resulted:
AFN
0 6667
S
0 06667
S
0 0392 S1
0 5106
0 6667 $300
0 06667 $300
0 0392 $3,300 0 5106
$200
$20
$66
$114 million
Now suppose Allied anticipated problems raising $114 million to carry out its
business plan. The CFO might then suggest to the directors a reduction of the

payout ratio to 20%. That would result in an AFN of about $77 million (shown in
Part IV of Table 16.1), which is about $37 million less than the original AFN
calculated. Of course, as we saw in the dividend chapter, lowering the dividend
might create problems of its own; but at times, such an action may be necessary to
maximize a firm’s intrinsic value and long-run stock price.
This chapter described techniques for forecasting financial statements, which is a
crucial part of the financial planning process. Both investors and corporations
regularly use forecasting techniques to help value a company’s stock; to estimate
the benefits of potential projects; and to estimate how changes in capital structure,
dividend policy, and working capital policy influence shareholder value.
The type of forecasting described in this chapter is important for several
reasons. First, if the projected operating results are unsatisfactory, management
can “go back to the drawing board,” reformulate its plans, and develop more
reasonable targets for the coming year. Second, the funds required to meet the
sales forecast simply may not be obtainable. If not, it is obviously better to know
this in advance and to scale back projected operations than to suddenly run out of
cash and have operations grind to an abrupt halt. And third, firms often give
guidance to analysts regarding likely future earnings; and as GE’s Jeffrey Immelt
learned, it is beneficial to be able to provide reasonably accurate forecasts.

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH RATE
Weatherford Industries Inc. has the following ratios:
A0 S0
1 6; L0 S0
0 4; profit margin
0 10; and payout ratio
0 45, or 45%. Sales last

equation to determine the maximum growth rate (the sustainable growth rate) Weatherford
can achieve without having to employ nonspontaneous external funds.

ADDITIONAL FUNDS NEEDED
Suppose Weatherford’s financial consultants report (1) that
the inventory turnover ratio is Sales Inventory
3 times versus an industry average of
4 times and (2) that Weatherford can reduce inventories and thus raise its turnover to 4
without affecting sales, the profit margin, or the other asset turnover ratios. Under those
conditions, use the AFN equation to determine the amount of additional funds Weath-
erford will require next year if sales grow by 20%.

Carter Corporation’s sales are expected to increase from $5 million in
2014 to $6 million in 2015, or by 20%. Its assets totaled $3 million at the end of 2014. Carter
is at full capacity, so its assets must grow in proportion to projected sales. At the end of
2014, current liabilities are $1 million, consisting of $250,000 of accounts payable, $500,000
of notes payable, and $250,000 of accrued liabilities. Its profit margin is forecasted to be 5%,

LONG-TERM FINANCING NEEDED
At year-end 2014, total assets for Ambrose Inc. were
$1 2 million and accounts payable were $375,000. Sales, which in 2014 were $2 5 million, are
expected to increase by 25% in 2015. Total assets and accounts payable are proportional to
sales, and that relationship will be maintained; that is, they will grow at the same rate as
sales. Ambrose typically uses no current liabilities other than accounts payable. Common
stock amounted to $425,000 in 2014, and retained earnings were $295,000. Ambrose plans
to sell new common stock in the amount of $75,000. The firm’s profit margin on sales is 6%;
60% of earnings will be retained.

Suppose that in 2015, sales increase by 10% over 2014 sales. The firm currently has 100,000
shares outstanding. It expects to maintain its 2014 dividend payout ratio and believes that
its assets should grow at the same rate as sales. The firm has no excess capacity. However,
the firm would like to reduce its Operating costs/Sales ratio to 87 5% and increase its total
liabilities-to-assets ratio to 30%. (It believes its liabilities-to-assets ratio currently is too low
relative to the industry average.) The firm will raise 30% of the 2015 forecasted interest-
bearing debt as notes payable, and it will issue long-term bonds for the remainder. The firm
forecasts that its before-tax cost of debt (which includes both short-term and long-term
debt) is 12 5%. Assume that any common stock issuances or repurchases can be made at the
firm’s current stock price of $45.
a.
Construct the forecasted financial statements assuming that these changes are made.
What are the firm’s forecasted notes payable and long-term debt balances? What is the
forecasted addition to retained earnings?
b.
If the profit margin remains at 5% and the dividend payout ratio remains at 60%, at
what growth rate in sales will the additional financing requirements be exactly zero? In
other words, what is the firm’s sustainable growth rate? (Hint: Set AFN equal to zero
and solve for g.)

a.
Assume that the company was operating at full capacity in 2014 with regard to all items
except fixed assets; fixed assets in 2014 were being utilized to only 75% of capacity. By
what percentage could 2015 sales increase over 2014 sales without the need for an increase
in fixed assets?
b.
Now suppose 2015 sales increase by 25% over 2014 sales. Assume that Krogh cannot sell any
fixed assets. All assets other than fixed assets will grow at the same rate as sales; however,
after reviewing industry averages, the firm would like to reduce its operating costs/sales ratio
to 82% and increase its total liabilities-to-assets ratio to 42%. The firm will maintain its 60%
dividend payout ratio, and it currently has 1 million shares outstanding. The firm plans to
raise 35% of its 2015 forecasted interest-bearing debt as notes payable, and it will issue bonds
for the remainder. The firm forecasts that its before-tax cost of debt (which includes both
short-term and long-term debt) is 11%. Any stock issuances or repurchases will be made at
the firm’s current stock price of $40. Develop Krogh’s projected financial statements like those
shown in Table 16.2. What are the balances of notes payable, bonds, common stock, and
retained earnings?

FINANCIAL FORECASTING
Sue Wilson, the new financial manager of New World Chemicals (NWC), a
California producer of specialized chemicals for use in fruit orchards, must prepare a formal financial
forecast for 2015. NWC’s 2014 sales were $2 billion, and the marketing department is forecasting a 25%
increase for 2015. Wilson thinks the company was operating at full capacity in 2014, but she is not sure.
The first step in her forecast was to assume that key ratios would remain unchanged and that it would be
“business as usual” at NWC. The 2014 financial statements, the 2015 initial forecast, and a ratio analysis
for 2014 and the 2015 initial forecast are given in Table IC 16.1.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Assume that you were recently hired as Wilson’s assistant and that your first major task is to help her
develop the formal financial forecast. She asks you to begin by answering the following questions.
a. Assume (1) that NWC was operating at full capacity in 2014 with respect to all assets, (2) that all
assets must grow at the same rate as sales, (3) that accounts payable and accrued liabilities also will
grow at the same rate as sales, and (4) that the 2014 profit margin and dividend payout will be
maintained. Under those conditions, what would the AFN equation predict the company’s financial
requirements to be for the coming year?
b. Consultations with several key managers within NWC, including production, inventory, and recei-
vable managers, have yielded some very useful information.
1. NWC’s high DSO is largely due to one significant customer who battled through some hardships
the past 2 years but who appears to be financially healthy again and is generating strong cash
flow. As a result, NWC’s accounts receivable manager expects the firm to lower receivables
enough for a calculated DSO of 34 days without adversely affecting sales.
2. NWC was operating slightly below capacity; but its forecasted growth will require a new facility,
which is expected to increase NWC’s net fixed assets to $700 million.
3. A relatively new inventory management system (installed last year) has taken some time to catch
on and to operate efficiently. NWC’s inventory turnover improved slightly last year, but this year
NWC expects even more improvement as inventories decrease and inventory turnover is
expected to rise to 10 .
Incorporate that information into the 2015 initial forecast results, as these adjustments to the initial
forecast represent the final forecast for 2015. (Hint: Total assets do not change from the
initial forecast.)
c. Calculate NWC’s forecasted ratios based on its final forecast and compare them with the company’s
2014 historical ratios, the 2015 initial forecast ratios, and the industry averages. How does NWC
compare with the average firm in its industry, and is the company’s financial position expected to
improve during the coming year? Explain.
d. Based on the final forecast, calculate NWC’s free cash flow for 2015. How does this FCF differ from
the FCF forecasted by NWC’s initial “business as usual” forecast?
e. Initially, some NWC managers questioned whether the new facility expansion was necessary,
especially as it results in increasing net fixed assets from $500 million to $700 million (a 40%
increase). However, after extensive discussions about NWC needing to position itself for future
growth and being flexible and competitive in today’s marketplace, NWC’s top managers agreed that
the expansion was necessary. Among the issues raised by opponents was that NWC’s fixed assets
were being operated at only 85% of capacity. Assuming that its fixed assets were operating at only
85% of capacity, by how much could sales have increased, both in dollar terms and in percentage
terms, before NWC reached full capacity?
f. How would changes in the following items affect the AFN: (1) the dividend payout ratio, (2) the
profit margin, (3) the capital intensity ratio, and (4) NWC beginning to buy from its suppliers on
terms that permit it to pay after 60 days rather than after 30 days? (Consider each item separately
and hold all other things constant.)

FORECASTING THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF ABERCROMBIE & FITCH
Clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch enjoyed phenomenal success in the late 1990s. Between 1996 and
2000, its sales grew almost fourfold—from $335 million to more than $1 2 billion—and its stock price
soared by more than 500%. However, in 2002, its growth rate had begun to slow down and Abercrombie
had a hard time meeting its quarterly earnings targets. As a result, the stock price in late 2002 was about
half of what it was 3 years earlier. Abercrombie’s struggles resulted from increased competition, a sluggish
economy, and the challenges of staying ahead of the fashion curve. From late 2002 until November 2007,
the company’s stock rebounded strongly; however, its stock price declined during the 2008 economic
downturn. Its stock price rebounded until late October 2011 when it began a downward trend again. Its
stock price has started to rise again (June 2013), but questions remain about the firm’s long-term growth
prospects. However, the company has been actively repurchasing shares indicating that management
believes its shares are undervalued. The company continues to steadily expand stores abroad while closing
underperforming domestic stores.
Given the questions about Abercrombie’s future growth rate, analysts have focused on the company’s
earnings reports. Thomson ONE provides a convenient and detailed summary of the company’s recent
earnings history along with a summary of analysts’ earnings forecasts.
To access this information, begin by entering the company’s ticker symbol, ANF, on Thomson ONE’s
main screen and then selecting “GO.” You will then see an overview of the company’s recent performance.
After reviewing the company overview, you should click on “Estimates.” Click on “View Forecasts” (in the
EPS Estimate Forecasts box in the middle of your screen) to see details of the EPS summary report. On both
of these screens, you will find a wide range of information about the company’s past and projected
earnings.
Discussion Questions
1.
What are the mean and median forecasts for Abercrombie’s earnings per share over the next fiscal year?
2.
Based on analysts’ forecasts, what is the expected long-term growth rate in earnings?
3.
Have analysts made any significant changes to their forecasted earnings for Abercrombie & Fitch in the past few
months? Explain.
4.
Historically, have Abercrombie’s reported earnings generally met, exceeded, or fallen short of analysts’ forecasted
earnings?
5.
How has Abercrombie’s stock performed this year relative to the S&P 500?

U.S. Firms Look Overseas to Enhance Shareholder Value
From the end of World War II until the 1970s,
the United States dominated the world econ-
omy. However, that situation no longer exists.
Raw materials, finished goods, services, and
money flow freely across most national bound-
aries, as do innovative ideas and new technolo-
gies. World-class U.S. companies are making
breakthroughs in foreign labs, obtaining capital
from foreign investors, and putting foreign
employees on the fast track to the top. Dozens
of
top
U.S.
manufacturers,
including
Dow
Chemical, Colgate-Palmolive, IBM, and Hewlett-
Packard, sell more of their products outside the
United States than they do at home. Likewise,
service firms such as Citigroup, McDonald’s, and
AFLAC receive more than half their revenues
from foreign sales.
The trend is even more pronounced in
profits. In recent years, Coca-Cola and many
other companies have made more money in
the Pacific Rim and Western Europe than in
the United States. All told, Coca-Cola now
reports that almost 60% of 2012 net sales came
from business outside the United States. As a
result, economic events around the globe and
changing exchange rates now have a profound
effect on the company’s bottom line. In particu-
lar, profits earned in foreign currencies are
worth more when the U.S. dollar declines.
Successful global companies such as Coca-
Cola must conduct business in different econo-
mies, and they must be sensitive to the many
subtleties of different cultures and political sys-
tems. Accordingly, they find it useful to blend into

the foreign landscape to help win product acceptance and
avoid political problems. At the same time, foreign-based multi-
nationals are arriving on American shores in ever greater num-
bers. Switzerland’s ABB, the Netherlands’s Philips, France’s
Thomson, and Japan’s Fujitsu and Honda are all waging cam-
paigns to be identified as companies that employ Americans,
transfer technology to America, and help the U.S. trade balance.
The emergence of “world companies” raises a host of
questions for governments. For example, should domestic
firms be favored, or does it make no difference what a
company’s nationality is as long as the firm provides domestic
jobs? Should a company make an effort to keep jobs in its
home country, or should it produce where total production
costs are lowest? What nation controls the technology devel-
oped by a multinational corporation, particularly when the
technology can be used in military applications? Must a multi-
national company adhere to rules imposed in its home coun-
try with respect to its operations outside the home country?
And if a U.S. firm such as Xerox produces copiers in Japan and
then ships them to the United States, should they be reflected
in the trade deficit in the same way as Toshiba copiers
imported from Japan? Keep those questions in mind as you
read this chapter. When you finish, you should have a better
appreciation of the problems that governments face and the
difficult but profitable opportunities that managers of multi-
national companies face.
Managers of multinational companies must deal with a wide range of issues that
are not present when a company operates in a single country. In this chapter, we
highlight the key differences between multinational and domestic corporations,
and we discuss the impact these differences have on the financial management of
multinational businesses.
By the time you complete this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Identify the primary reasons companies choose to go “global.”
•
Explain how exchange rates work and interpret different exchange rate
quotations.
•
Discuss the intuition behind interest rate parity and purchasing power parity.
•
Explain the different opportunities and risks that investors face when they
invest overseas.
•
Identify some specific challenges that a multinational corporation faces and
discuss how they influence its capital budgeting, capital structure, and working
capital policies.
17-1 MULTINATIONAL, OR GLOBAL, CORPORATIONS
The term multinational, or global, corporation describes a firm that operates in
an integrated fashion in a number of countries. During the past 20 years, a new
and fundamentally different form of international commercial activity has devel-
oped that has greatly increased worldwide economic and political interdepen-
dence. Rather than merely purchase resources from and sell goods to foreign
nations, multinational firms now make direct investments in fully integrated
operations—from extraction of raw materials through the manufacturing process
and finally to the distribution of products to consumers throughout the world.
Today multinational corporate networks control a large and growing share of the
world’s technological, marketing, and productive resources.

Companies, both U.S. and foreign, go “global” for seven primary reasons:
1.
To seek production efficiency. As competition increases in their domestic
marketplace and as demand increases in other markets, companies often
conclude that they must produce their products overseas. Companies based in
high-cost countries have strong incentives to shift production to lower-cost
regions, assuming an adequate supply of labor with the requisite skills and an
adequate transportation infrastructure. For example, GE has production and
assembly plants in Mexico, South Korea, and Singapore. Even Japanese
manufacturers have started to shift some of their production to lower-cost
countries in the Pacific Rim and the Americas. BMW, in response to high
production costs in Germany, has built assembly plants in the United States,
among other countries. Those examples illustrate how companies strive to
remain competitive by locating manufacturing facilities wherever in the world
they can produce and transporting their products to meet the demand in their
major markets at the lowest total unit landed costs.
2.
To avoid political, trade, and regulatory hurdles. Governments sometimes impose
tariffs, quotas, and other restrictions on imported goods and services. They
often do so to raise revenues, to protect domestic industries, and to pursue
various political and economic policy objectives. To circumvent government
hurdles, firms often develop production facilities abroad. For example, the
primary reason Japanese auto companies moved production to the United
States was to get around U.S. import quotas. Now Honda, Nissan, Toyota,
Mazda, and Mitsubishi are assembling vehicles in the United States. This was
also the situation in the 1970s when India followed a development strategy to
compete domestically with imported products. One reason that prompted
U.S. pharmaceutical maker Smith Kline and the U.K.’s Beecham to merge was
to avoid licensing and regulatory delays in their largest markets, Western
Europe and the United States. GlaxoSmithKline (the result of a 2000 merger
between Glaxo Wellcome and Smith Kline Beecham) now identifies itself as an
inside player in Europe and the United States.2
3.
To broaden markets. After a company’s home market matures, growth
opportunities are often better in foreign markets. According to economic
product life-cycle theory, a firm first produces in its home market, where it can
better develop its product and satisfy local customers. This attracts
competitors; but when the home market is expanding rapidly, new customers
provide the necessary sales growth. However, as the home market matures
and the growth of total demand slows, competition becomes more intense. At
the same time, demand for the product develops abroad, which creates
conditions favoring production in foreign countries to satisfy foreign demand
and to cut production and transportation costs so that the company can
remain competitive. Thus, such homegrown firms as IBM, Coca-Cola, and
McDonald’s are aggressively expanding into overseas markets. In addition,
foreign firms such as Sony and Toshiba now play an important role in the U.S.
consumer electronics market. Also, as products become more complex and
development becomes more expensive, it is necessary to sell more units to
cover overhead costs; so larger markets are critical.
4.
To seek raw materials and new technology. Supplies of many essential raw
materials are geographically dispersed; so companies must go where the
materials are found, no matter how challenging it may be to operate in some
of the locations. For example, major deposits of oil are located on the northern
2There is also some recent evidence that global differences in banking regulations influence the flow of
capital between countries. Refer to Joel Houston, Chen Lin, and Yue Ma, “Regulatory Arbitrage and
International Bank Flows,” Journal of Finance, vol. 67, no. 5 (October 2012), pp. 1845–1895.

coast of Alaska, in Siberia, in the deserts of the Middle East, and in the
Canadian tar sands, all of which present unique challenges. Thus, U.S. oil
companies such as Exxon Mobil need major production facilities around the
world to ensure access to the basic input resources needed to sustain the
companies in the future. Because Exxon Mobil has refineries, distribution
facilities, and oil production fields, this type of investment is referred to as a
vertically integrated investment, whereby the firm undertakes an investment
to secure its supply of inputs at stable prices.
5.
To protect processes and products. Firms often possess special intangible assets
such as brand names, technological and marketing know-how, managerial
expertise, and superior research and development (R&D) capabilities.
Unfortunately, property rights involving intangible assets are often difficult to
protect, particularly in foreign markets. Firms sometimes invest abroad rather
than license local foreign firms in order to protect the secrecy of their
production processes, distribution systems, or the product itself. Once a firm’s
formula or production process is revealed to other local firms, those firms may
more easily develop similar products or processes, which will hurt the original
firm’s sales. For example, to protect its formula, Coca-Cola builds bottling
plants and distribution networks in foreign markets but imports the
concentrate or syrup required to make the product from the United States. In
the 1960s, Coca-Cola faced strong pressure from the Indian government to
reveal its formula in order to continue its operations in India. Rather than
reveal its formula, the company withdrew its operations from India until the
foreign investment climate improved.
6.
To diversify. By establishing worldwide production facilities and markets,
firms can cushion the effect of adverse economic conditions in any single
country. For example, U.S. corporations with significant overseas operations
benefit when there is a decline in the U.S. dollar. In general, geographic
diversification of inputs and outputs works because the economic fluctuations
or political vagaries of different countries are not perfectly correlated.
Therefore, companies investing overseas can benefit from diversification in the
same way that individuals benefit from investing in a broad portfolio of
stocks. However, because individual shareholders can diversify their
investments internationally on their own, it makes less sense for firms to
undertake foreign investments solely for diversification purposes. Note,
though, that in countries that place constraints on foreign stock ownership or
that do not have internationally traded companies, corporate diversification
might make sense because then companies can do something that
shareholders cannot easily duplicate in their individual portfolios.
7.
To retain customers. If a company goes abroad and establishes production or
distribution operations, it will need inputs and services at the new locations. If
it can obtain what it needs from a supplier that also operates in the same set of
countries, managing the relationship will be much easier, and economies of
scale and other synergies will likely be obtained. Therefore, suppliers of inputs
or services can better retain the business of their customers who are “going
global” if they follow their customers abroad. Large U.S. banks, such as
Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, initially expanded abroad to supply banking
services to their long-time customers, although they quickly capitalized on
their global network to develop new customer relationships. The same history
is also true for accounting, law, advertising, and similar service providers.
The past 10 to 20 years has seen an increasing amount of investment in the
United States by foreign corporations and in foreign nations by U.S. corporations.
This trend is shown in Figure 17.1, and it is important because of its implications
for eroding the traditional doctrine of independence and self-reliance that has

been a hallmark of U.S. policy. Just as U.S. corporations with extensive overseas
operations are said to use their economic power to exert substantial economic and
political influence over host governments in many parts of the world, it is feared
that foreign corporations are gaining similar sway over U.S. policy. These devel-
opments suggest an increasing degree of mutual influence and interdependence
among business enterprises and nations, to which the United States is not
immune. Figure 17.1 also demonstrates that the level of foreign investment varies
over the business cycle, and generally declines as the global economy weakens.
We saw this effect most recently when the level of foreign investment inside and
outside of the United States declined sharply during the 2008 recession.
17-2 MULTINATIONAL VERSUS DOMESTIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
In theory, the concepts and procedures discussed in the first 16 chapters are valid for
both domestic and multinational operations. However, some additional factors need
to be considered when firms operate globally. Five of these factors are listed here:

1.
Different currency denominations. Cash flows in various parts of a multinational
corporate system will be denominated in different currencies. Hence,
exchange rates must be included in all financial analyses.
2.
Political risk. Nations are free to place constraints on the transfer or use of
corporate resources, and they can change regulations and tax rules at any
time. They can even expropriate assets within their boundaries. Therefore,
political risks can take on many forms. Of course, political risks are present for
companies operating in a single country. But for multinational firms, political
risks exist in various forms from country to country; and they must be
addressed explicitly in any financial analysis.
3.
Economic and legal ramifications. Each country has its own unique economic
and legal systems, and these differences can cause significant problems
when a corporation tries to coordinate and control its worldwide
operations. For example, differences in tax laws among countries can cause
a given economic transaction to have strikingly different after-tax
consequences depending on where the transaction occurs. Similarly,
differences in legal systems of host nations, such as the Common Law of
Great Britain versus the French Civil Law, complicate matters ranging from
the simple recording of business transactions to the role the judiciary plays
in resolving conflicts. Such differences can restrict multinational
corporations’ flexibility in deploying resources and make procedures that
are required in one part of the company illegal in others. These differences
also make it difficult for executives trained in one country to move easily to
another.
4.
Role of governments. Most financial models developed in the United States
assume the existence of a competitive marketplace in which the participants
determine the terms of trade. The government, through its power to
establish basic ground rules, is involved in the process; but other than taxes,
its role is minimal. Thus, the market provides the primary barometer of
success, and it gives the best clues about what must be done to remain
competitive. This view of the process is reasonably correct for the United
States and Western Europe, but it does not accurately describe the situation
in the rest of the world. Although market imperfections can complicate the
decision process, they can also be valuable to the extent that they can be
overcome by one firm but still serve as barriers to entry by competitors.
Frequently, the terms under which companies compete, the actions that
must be taken or avoided, and the terms of trade on various transactions are
determined not in the marketplace but by direct negotiation between host
governments and multinational enterprises. This is essentially a political
process, and it must be treated as such. Thus, traditional financial models
have to be recast to include political and other noneconomic aspects of the
decision.
5.
Language and cultural differences. The ability to communicate is critical in all
business transactions. In this regard, U.S. citizens are often at a disadvantage
because they generally are fluent only in English. On the other hand,
European and Japanese businesspeople are usually fluent in several
languages, including English. At the same time, even within geographic
regions that are considered relatively homogenous, different countries have
unique cultural heritages that shape values and influence the conduct of
business. Multinational corporations find that matters such as defining the
appropriate goals of the firm, attitudes toward risk, performance
evaluation and compensation systems, interactions with employees, and
the ability to curtail unprofitable operations vary dramatically from one
country to the next.

multinational firms face. However, the prospects for high returns and other factors
make it worthwhile for firms to accept these risks and learn how to manage them.
17-3 THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM
Every nation has a monetary system and a monetary authority. In the United
States, the Federal Reserve is the monetary authority; its task is to limit inflation
while promoting economic stability and growth. If countries are to trade with one
another, some sort of system must be designed to facilitate payments between
nations. The international monetary system is the framework within which
exchange rates are determined; and it ties global currency, money, capital, real
estate, commodity, and real asset markets into a network of institutions and
instruments regulated by intergovernmental agreements and driven by each
country’s unique political and economic objectives.3
17-3A INTERNATIONAL MONETARY TERMINOLOGY
In a discussion of the international monetary system, it is useful to begin by
introducing some important concepts and terminology:
1.
An exchange rate is the price of one country’s currency in terms of another
country’s currency. For example, on Tuesday, June 11, 2013, one U.S. dollar
would buy 0 6392 British pound, 0 7511 euro, or 1 0190 Canadian dollars.
2.
A spot exchange rate is the quoted price for a unit of foreign currency to be
delivered “on the spot” or within a very short period of time. The pound rate
quoted, £0 6392 $, is a spot rate as of the close of business on June 11, 2013.
3.
A forward exchange rate is the quoted price for a unit of foreign currency to be
delivered at a specified date in the future. If today was June 11, 2013, and we
wanted to know how many pounds we could expect to receive for a dollar on
December 11, 2013, we would look at the 6-month forward rate, which was
£0 6398 $ versus the £0.6392/$ spot rate. Thus, the dollar is expected to
appreciate slightly relative to the British pound during the next 6 months. Note
also that the forward exchange contract on June 11 would lock in this exchange
rate but no money would change hands until December 11, 2013. The spot rate
on December 11 might be quite different from £0 6398, in which case we
would have a profit or a loss on the forward purchase.

4.
A fixed exchange rate for a currency is set by the government and is allowed to
fluctuate only slightly (if at all) around the desired rate, which is called the par
value. For example, Belize has fixed the exchange rate for the Belizean dollar at
BZD 2 00 $1, and it has maintained this fixed rate since 1978.
5.
A floating or flexible exchange rate is not regulated by the government, so supply
and demand in the market determine the currency’s value. The U.S. dollar and
the euro are examples of free-floating currencies. If U.S. customers are
importing more goods from Europe than they are exporting to Europe, they
will have to make net purchases of euros and sales of dollars, which will cause
the euro to appreciate relative to the dollar. Note, though, that central banks
do intervene in the market from time to time to nudge exchange rates up or
down even though they basically float.
6.
Devaluation or revaluation of a currency is the technical term referring to the
decrease or increase in the stated par value of a currency whose value is
fixed. This decision is made by the government, usually without warning.
For example, on July 21, 2005, the Chinese government suddenly
announced that it was revaluing the yuan to make it 2 1% stronger against
the U.S. dollar. (The new exchange rate was CNY 8 1097 $.) Even though
it was widely believed that the yuan was significantly undervalued, this
revaluation caught many by surprise because the exchange rate had been
pegged at a fixed rate of CNY 8 2781 $ for nearly a decade. Just as
importantly, on that date, the Chinese government abandoned the strict
peg to the U.S. dollar and instead adopted a more flexible system where
the yuan is now linked to a basket of trade-weighted international
currencies including the dollar. Since then, the yuan has steadily
appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar. On June 11, 2013, the exchange rate
was CNY 6 1350 $; so it cost 24 3% fewer yuan to buy a dollar than it did
on July 21, 2005.
7.
Depreciation or appreciation of a currency refers to a decrease or increase,
respectively, in the foreign exchange value of a floating currency. These
changes are caused by market forces rather than by governments.
17-3B CURRENT MONETARY ARRANGEMENTS
At the most basic level, we can divide currency regimes into two broad groups:
floating rates and fixed rates. Within the two regimes, there are gradations among
subregimes in terms of how rigidly they adhere to the basic positions. Looking
first at the floating-rate category, the two main subgroups are as follows:
1.
Freely floating. Here the exchange rate is determined by the supply and
demand for the currency. Under a freely floating regime, governments may
occasionally intervene in the market to buy or sell their currency to stabilize
fluctuations, but they do not attempt to alter the absolute level of the rate. This
policy exists at one end of the continuum of exchange-rate regimes. For
example, the currencies of Australia, Brazil, and the Philippines, among many
others, are allowed to float with a minimum of intervention.
2.
Managed floating. Here there is significant government intervention to manage
the exchange rate by manipulating the currency’s supply and demand. For
example, the governments of Colombia, Israel, and Poland manage their
respective currency’s float. Governments rarely reveal their target exchange
rate levels when they use a managed-float regime because doing so would
make it too easy for currency speculators to profit.
Most developed countries follow either a freely floating or a managed-float
regime. A few developing countries do so as well, often reluctantly and as a result
of a market that forces them to abandon a fixed-rate regime.
Freely Floating Regime
Occurs when the
exchange rate is
determined by supply and
demand for the currency.
Managed-Float Regime
Occurs when there is
significant government
intervention to control the
exchange rate via
manipulation of the
currency’s supply and
demand.

Types of fixed-exchange-rate regimes include the following:
1.
No local currency. The most extreme position is for the country to have no local
currency of its own, using another country’s currency as its legal tender (such
as the U.S. dollar in Ecuador and in the Turks and Caicos Islands) or
belonging to a group of countries that shares a common currency (such as the
THE DEBT CRISIS HITS EUROPE
In early 2010, just when the markets had slowly begun to
recover from the U.S.-led financial crisis of 2007–2008,
another crisis began to emerge in Europe. This time the
concern was the burgeoning debt levels of some European
governments. The issue came to a head in the spring of
2010, when the Greek government found it increasingly
difficult to fund its deficit. At the same time, similar concerns
were arising in Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy.
In an attempt to keep the Greek crisis from spreading, the
European Union (EU) partnered with the International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF) to put together a $1 trillion bailout plan. The
plan included a fund to help struggling European nations
obtain emergency short-term funding, and it also created a
separate vehicle with the power to purchase the debt of
cash-constrained countries.
While the bailout package temporarily extinguished the
fire, most analysts believed at the time that the crisis was far
from resolved. Sure enough, in July 2011, European leaders
agreed to another Greek bailout. (This bailout totaled 109
billion euros, or roughly $157 billion.) While this deal was
initially well received in the markets, the risk of default
remains. How this all plays out will have profound conse-
quences for European governments, the banking system,
and the future of the EU.
In return for funding, the countries applying for assistance
are generally forced to cut back on their public spending.
While arguably necessary, these austerity measures often cre-
ate a public backlash—indeed, widespread demonstrations
and riots continue in Greece in response to the government’s
announcement of massive budget cuts. Because they have
made investments in many of these sovereign nations’ debt,
European banks also have an important stake in the process.
The charts below from Bloomberg.com provide a quick
snapshot of recent developments. We see that sovereign
debt levels as a percentage of GDP have somewhat stabi-
lized, but they remain at very high levels in some countries.
As expected, these countries with higher debt levels also
tend to have higher government bond yields. Finally, we can
see the dramatic effects that the crisis and the subsequent
austerity moves have had on unemployment rates. Most
notably, unemployment remains extraordinarily high in
Spain, Greece, and Portugal.

impose domestic currency restrictions unless it has enough foreign currency
reserves to cover all requested exchanges. This is called a currency board
arrangement. Argentina had a currency board arrangement before its crisis of
January 2002, when it was forced to devalue the peso and default on its debt.
3.
Fixed-peg arrangement. In a fixed-peg arrangement, the country locks, or
“pegs,” its currency to another currency or basket of currencies at a fixed
exchange rate. This allows the currency to vary only slightly from its desired
rate; and if it moves outside the specified limits (often set at 1% of the target
rate), its central bank intervenes to force the currency back within the limits.
An example is China, where the yuan is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar
but rather to a basket of trade-weighted international currencies. Additional
examples include Bhutan’s ngultrum, which is pegged to the Indian rupee; the
Falkland Islands’ pound, which is pegged to the British pound sterling; and
Barbados’s dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
Other variations have been used, and new ones are developed from time to time.
A majority of the world’s countries employ a system that includes a fixed-
exchange rate along with occasional interventions. So while the most important
currencies (as measured by volume of transactions) are allowed to float and the
international monetary system is often called a floating regime, most currencies
are partially fixed but occasionally are manipulated in some manner.
17-4 FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE QUOTATIONS
Foreign exchange rate quotations can be found in The Wall Street Journal and in other
leading print publications and on websites. Exchange rates are given two different
ways. As shown in Table 17.1, which is an excerpt from the website of The Wall
Street Journal, Column 1 is the “USD equivalent” exchange rate, and Column 2 is the
“Currency per USD” exchange rate. For example, 1 Canadian dollar is worth (or can
be exchanged for) 0.9814 U.S. dollar, or 1 U.S. dollar can buy 1.0190 Canadian
dollars. Note that if the foreign exchange markets are in equilibrium, which is
usually the case for the major traded currencies, the two quotations must be
reciprocals of each other, as shown here for the Canadian dollar.

though, that a German executive is flying to Tokyo on business. The exchange rate
in which he or she is interested is not euros or yen per dollar—rather, the issue is

how many yen can be purchased with a euro. This is called a cross rate, and it can
be calculated from the following data from Column 2 of Table 17.1:
Spot Rate
Euro
€0.7511/$l
Yen
¥96.02/$1
Because the quotations have the same denominator—one U.S. dollar—we can
calculate the cross rate between these (and other) currencies by using the Column
2 quotations. For our German national, the cross rates are found as follows:
Euro Yen exchange rate
Euro $
Yen $
And when we cancel the dollar signs, we are left with the number of euros that
one yen could purchase:
€0 7511
96 02
0 0078
Alternatively, we could find the number of yen that one euro could buy:
Yen Euro exchange rate
Yen $
Euro $
96 02

127 84
Note that those two cross rates are reciprocals of each other.
Financial publications such as The Wall Street Journal and websites such as
Bloomberg, Yahoo!, and online.wsj.com provide tables of key currency cross rates.
Table 17.2 gives the table from The Wall Street Journal website for June 11, 2013.
Notice that there may be slight differences when you calculate cross rates due to
the rounding of individual quotations. Currency traders carry quotations out to 12
decimal places.

17-4B INTERBANK FOREIGN CURRENCY QUOTATIONS
The quotations from The Wall Street Journal given in Tables 17.1 and 17.2 are
sufficient for many purposes. For other purposes, however, additional terminol-
ogy and conventions are useful. There are two ways to state the exchange rate
between two currencies, in either American terms or European. Accordingly, we
need to designate one of the currencies as the “home” currency and the other as
the “foreign” currency. This designation is arbitrary. The home currency price of
one unit of the foreign currency is called a direct quotation. Thus, to a person who
considers the United States to be “home,” American terms represent a direct
quotation. On the other hand, the foreign currency price of one unit of the home
currency is called an indirect quotation. European terms represent indirect quota-
tions to people in the United States. Note that if the perspective changes and the
“home” currency is no longer the U.S. dollar, the designations of direct and
indirect will change. For the remainder of this chapter, unless specifically stated
otherwise, we will assume that the United States is the “home” country and thus
that the U.S. dollar is the home currency.
17-5 TRADING IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Importers, exporters, tourists, and governments buy and sell currencies in the
foreign exchange market. For example, when a U.S. trader imports automobiles
from Japan, payment is probably made in Japanese yen. The importer buys yen
(through its bank) in the foreign exchange market, much as one buys common
stocks on the New York Stock Exchange or pork bellies on the Chicago Mercantile

The exchange rates shown earlier in Tables 17.1 and 17.2 are known as spot rates,
which means the rate paid for delivery of the currency “on the spot” or, in reality,
no more than 2 days after the day of the trade. For most of the world’s major
currencies, it also is possible to buy (or sell) currencies for delivery at some agreed-
upon future date, usually 30, 90, or 180 days from the day the transaction is
negotiated. This rate is known as the forward exchange rate.
For example, suppose a U.S. firm must pay 500 million yen to a Japanese firm
in 30 days and the current spot rate is 96 02 yen per dollar. Unless spot rates
change, the U.S. firm will pay the Japanese firm the equivalent of $5 207 million
(500 million yen divided by 96 02 yen per dollar) in 30 days. But if the spot rate
falls to 95 yen per dollar, for example, the U.S. firm will have to pay the equivalent
of $5 263 million. The treasurer of the U.S. firm can avoid this risk by entering into
a 30-day forward exchange contract. This contract promises delivery of yen to the
U.S. firm in 30 days at a guaranteed price of 96 yen per dollar. No cash changes
hands at the time the treasurer signs the forward contract, although the U.S. firm
might have to put down some collateral as a guarantee against default. Because the
firm can use an interest-bearing instrument for the collateral, though, this require-
ment is not costly. The counterparty to the forward contract must deliver the yen to
the U.S. firm in 30 days, and the U.S. firm is obligated to purchase the 500 million yen
at the previously agreed-upon rate of 96 yen per dollar. Therefore, the treasurer of the
U.S. firm is able to lock in a payment equivalent to $5 208 million no matter what
happens to spot rates. This technique is called “hedging.”

Notes:
1. These are representative quotes as provided by a sample of New York banks. Forward rates for other currencies and for other
lengths of time can often be negotiated.
2. When it takes more units of a foreign currency to buy one dollar in the future, the value of the foreign currency is less in the forward
market than in the spot market, hence the forward rate is at a discount to the spot rate. Likewise, when it takes less units of a
foreign currency to buy one dollar in the future, the value of the foreign currency is more in the forward market than in the spot
market, hence the forward rate is at a premium to the spot rate.

Forward rates for 30-, 90-, and 180-day delivery, along with the current spot
rates for some commonly traded currencies, are given in Table 17.3. If we can
obtain more of the foreign currency for a dollar in the forward market than in the
spot market, the forward currency is less valuable than the spot currency and the
forward currency is said to be selling at a discount. Conversely, if we can obtain
less of the foreign currency for a dollar in the forward market than in the spot
market, the forward currency is more valuable than the spot currency and the
forward currency is said to be selling at a premium. Thus, because a dollar buys
fewer yen and Swiss francs in the forward market than in the spot market, the
forward yen and Swiss francs are selling at a premium. On the other hand, a
dollar would buy more Australian dollars and British pounds in the forward
market than in the spot market, so the forward Australian dollars and British
pounds are selling at a discount.
17-6 INTEREST RATE PARITY
Market forces determine whether a currency sells at a forward premium or
discount, and the general relationship between spot and forward exchange rates
is specified by a concept called “interest rate parity.” Interest rate parity holds
that investors should earn the same return on interest-bearing investments in all
countries after adjusting for risk. It recognizes that when you invest in a country
other than your home country, you are affected by two forces—returns on the
investment itself and changes in the exchange rate. It follows that your overall
return will be higher than the investment’s stated return if the currency in which
your investment is denominated appreciates relative to your home currency.
Likewise, your overall return will be lower if the foreign currency you receive
declines in value.
The relationship between spot and forward exchange rates and interest rates,
which is known as interest rate parity, is expressed in the following equation:
Forward exchange rate
Spot exchange rate
1
rh
1
rf
Both the forward and spot rates are expressed in terms of the amount of home
currency received per unit of foreign currency; and rh and rf are the periodic
interest rates in the home country and the foreign country, respectively. If this
relationship does not hold, currency traders will buy and sell currencies—that is,
engage in arbitrage—until it does hold.
To illustrate interest rate parity, consider the case of a U.S. investor who can
buy default-free 90-day Japanese bonds that promise a 4% nominal return. The 90-
day interest rate, rf, is 4% 4
1% because 90 days is one-fourth of a 360-day year.
Assume also that the spot exchange rate is $0 01041 which means that you can
exchange 0 01041 dollar for 1 yen, or 96 02 yen per dollar. Finally, assume that the

90-day forward exchange rate is $0 01042, which means that you can exchange
1 yen for 0 01042 dollar, or receive 95 97 yen per dollar exchanged, 90 days
from now.
The U.S. investor can receive a 4% annualized return denominated in yen; but
if he or she ultimately wants to consume goods in the United States, those yen
must be converted to dollars. The dollar return on the investment depends, there-
fore, on what happens to exchange rates over the next 3 months. However, the
investor can lock in the dollar return by selling the foreign currency in the forward
market. For example, the investor can do the following simultaneously:
•
Convert $1,000 to 96,020 yen in the spot market.
•
Invest the 96,020 yen in 90-day Japanese bonds that have a 4% annualized
return or a 1% quarterly return and hence will pay 96,020 1 01
96,980 20
yen in 90 days.
•
Agree today to exchange the 96,980 20 yen 90 days from now at the 90-day
forward exchange rate of 95 97 yen per dollar, for a total of $1,010 53.
This investment, therefore, has an expected 90-day return of $10 53 $1,000
1 053%, which translates into a nominal return of 4 1 053%
4 21%. In this case,
4% of the expected 4 21% return is coming from the bond itself and 0 21% arises
because the market believes the yen will strengthen relative to the dollar. Note
that by locking in the forward rate today, the investor has eliminated any
exchange rate risk. And because the Japanese bond is assumed to be default-
free, the investor is assured of earning a 4 21% dollar return.
Interest rate parity implies that an investment in the United States with the
same risk as this Japanese bond should have an annual return of 4 21%. Solving
for rh in the parity equation, we indeed find that the predicted annual interest rate
in the United States is 4 21%.
Interest rate parity shows why a particular currency might be at a forward
premium or discount. Note that a currency is at a forward premium whenever
domestic interest rates are higher than foreign interest rates. Discounts will prevail
if domestic interest rates are lower than foreign interest rates. If these conditions
do not hold, arbitrage will soon force interest rates back to parity. Indeed, a recent
study found that under normal economic conditions, interest rate parity holds
remarkably well. However, significant deviations from parity did exist during
the recent financial crisis, when the lack of liquidity made it more difficult to
arbitrage.5
Q U E S T I O N :
The nominal annual interest rate on 6-month U.S. Treasuries is 0 06% (i.e., the semiannual
return is 0 03%). The spot rate of the British pound is $1 5645 (£0 6392 per U.S. dollar) and
the 6-month forward rate of the British pound is $1 5629 (£0 6398 per U.S. dollar). If interest
rate parity holds, what is the nominal annual interest rate on default-free 6-month British
bonds?

17-7 PURCHASING POWER PARITY
We have discussed exchange rates in some detail, and we have considered the
relationship between spot and forward exchange rates. However, we have not yet
addressed this fundamental question: What determines the spot level of exchange
A N S W E R :
The interest rate parity equation is:
Forward exchange rate
Spot exchange rate

rh
1
rf
Substituting the data given in the problem into the interest parity equation, we have:
$1 5629
$1 5645
1 0003
1
rf
This equation then reduces to the following:
0 998977309

0 998977309
0 998977309rf

If interest rate parity holds, then the nominal annual interest rate on a default-free 6-month
British bond would be 2
0.1324%
0.2648%.
To see the intuition behind this concept, assume that you have $1,000 and will invest in
a default-free 6-month British bond. Here’s what you would do:
•
Convert $1,000 to £639 20 in the spot market.
•
Invest the £639 20 in 6-month British bonds that have a 0 2648% nominal annual return
or a 0 1324% semiannual return. They will pay
639 20 1 001324
640 0463 in
6 months.
•
Agree today to exchange the £640 0463 six months from now at the 6-month forward
exchange rate of £0 6398 per U.S. dollar, for a total of $1,000 38
640 0463
0 6398 .
The investment has an expected 6-month return of $0 38 $1,000
0 03%, which trans-
lates into a nominal annual return of 2 0 03% ≈0 06%. This is the identical rate that
6-month U.S. Treasuries are earning, so interest rate parity holds. (Note that there is a small
rounding error in this calculation.)
S E L F T E S T
What is interest rate parity?
Assume that interest rate parity holds. When a currency trades at a forward
premium, what does that imply about domestic rates relative to foreign interest
rates? When a currency trades at a forward discount?
Assume that 90-day U.S. securities have a 3.5% annualized interest rate, whereas
90-day Canadian securities have a 4% annualized interest rate. In the spot
market, 1 U.S. dollar can be exchanged for 1.4 Canadian dollars. If interest rate
parity holds, what is the 90-day forward exchange rate between U.S. and
Canadian dollars? ($0.7134/C$ or C$1.40173/$)
On the basis of your answer to the previous question, is the Canadian dollar
selling at a premium or discount on the forward rate?

rates in each country? While exchange rates are influenced by a multitude of
factors that are difficult to predict, particularly on a day-to-day basis, over the
long run, market forces work to ensure that similar goods sell for similar prices in
different countries after exchange rates are taken into account. This relationship is
known as “purchasing power parity.”
Purchasing power parity (PPP), sometimes referred to as the law of one price,
implies that the level of exchange rates adjusts so as to cause identical goods to
cost the same amount in different countries. For example, if a pair of tennis shoes
costs $100 in the United States and 50 pounds in the United Kingdom, PPP implies
that the exchange rate will be $2 per pound. Consumers can purchase the shoes in
the United Kingdom for 50 pounds, or they can exchange their 50 pounds for
$100 and purchase the same shoes in the United States at the same effective cost,
assuming no transactions or transportation costs. The equation for purchasing
power parity is shown here:
Ph
Pf
Spot rate
or
Spot rate
Ph
Pf
Where:
Ph
Price of the good in the home country ($100, assuming the United States
is the home country)
Pf
Price of the good in the foreign country (50 pounds)
Note that the spot market exchange rate is expressed as the number of units of
home currency that can be exchanged for one unit of foreign currency ($2 per
pound).
Q U E S T I O N :
A U.S. consumer observes that a golf club costs $200. Currently in the spot market, 1 euro
can be exchanged for $1 3313. If purchasing power parity (PPP) holds, how many euros
should you expect to pay for the same golf club in Europe?
A N S W E R :
From the PPP equation, we know that Ph
Pf
Spot rate . In this example, we know
that the price in the home market is $200 Ph
$200 . The spot rate is $1 3313
(i.e., 1 euro
$1 3313, or $1 equals €0 7511). According to purchasing power parity, it
follows that the price of the golf club in the European market should be €150.2291:
Ph
Pf
Spot rate
$200
Pf 1 3313
Pf
$200
$1 3313
Pf = €150.2291
To further understand this, assume that the U.S. consumer has $200. She could use the
$200 to buy the golf club in the U.S. market, or she could exchange her $200 for €150 2291. If
the golf club cost €150 2291, then parity would hold. If instead the golf club sold for less than
€150 2291, it would make sense to buy the golf club in Europe, whereas if the golf club sold
for more than €150 2291, it would make sense to buy the golf club in the United States.
Purchasing Power

The relationship in which
the same products cost
roughly the same amount
in different countries after
taking into account the

PPP assumes that market forces will eliminate situations in which the same
product sells at a different price overseas. For example, if the tennis shoes cost $90
in the United States, trading companies could purchase them in the United States
for $90, sell them for 50 pounds in the United Kingdom, exchange the 50 pounds
for $100 in the foreign exchange market, and earn a profit of $10 on every pair of
shoes. Ultimately, this trading activity would increase the demand for tennis shoes
HUNGRY FOR A BIG MAC? GO TO HONG KONG!
Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that the same product
will sell for the same price in every country after adjusting for
current exchange rates. One problem when testing to see if
PPP holds is that it assumes that goods consumed in different
countries are of the same quality. For example, if you find that
a product is more expensive in Switzerland than it is in
Canada, one explanation is that PPP fails to hold; however,
another explanation is that the product sold in Switzerland is
of a higher quality and therefore deserves a higher price.
One way to test for PPP is to find goods that have the
same quality worldwide. With this in mind, The Economist
magazine occasionally compares the prices of a well-known
good whose quality is the same in 120 different countries:
the McDonald’s Big Mac hamburger.
The tables shown in Panels A and B on the next page
provide information collected during 2013. The Panel A
table gives the price of a Big Mac in each country’s local
currency and the actual dollar exchange rate when these
data
were
collected.
In
Panel
B,
the
first
numeric
column calculates the price of the Big Mac in terms of the
U.S. dollar—this is obtained by dividing the local price by
the actual exchange rate at that time. For example, a Big
Mac costs 43 0 kroner in Oslo, which is shown in Panel A.
Given an exchange rate of 5 48 kroner per dollar (as shown
in Panel A), this implies that the dollar price of a Big Mac is
43 0 kroner/5 48 kroner per dollar = $7 84, shown in Panel B.
The second numeric column in Panel B backs out the
implied exchange rate that would hold under PPP. This is
obtained by dividing the price of the Big Mac in each local
currency by its U.S. price. For example, as shown in Panel A,
a Big Mac costs 72 88 rubles in Russia and $4 37 in the
United States. If PPP holds, the exchange rate should be
approximately 16 7 rubles per dollar
72 88 rubles $4 37 ,
which is shown in Panel B.
Comparing the implied exchange rate (shown in Panel B)
to the actual exchange rate (shown in Panel A), we see the
extent to which the local currency is under- or overvalued
relative to the dollar. Given that the actual exchange rate at
the time was 30 05 rubles per dollar, this rate implies that
the ruble was 44 5% undervalued, which is shown in the
next-to-last column of Panel B.
The last 2 columns in Panel B indicate the extent to
which each currency is under- or overvalued relative to
the dollar as suggested by the “raw” Big Mac index and
as adjusted by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person. A
“cheap” burger doesn’t necessarily indicate that a currency
is undervalued relative to the dollar. One would expect
average prices in poor countries to be low because labor
costs are lower than in the richer industrialized countries.
Researchers did a regression analysis between Big Mac
prices and GDP per person and found that the difference
between the price predicted (from the regression) for each
country and its actual price gave a better indication of
whether the currency was under- or overvalued relative
to the dollar than the raw “Big Mac” Index. The final column
in Panel B gives the adjusted valuation from the regression
analysis. While the “raw” Big Mac Index suggested that the
Russian ruble is undervalued by 44 5%, the regression
results suggest that the ruble is only undervalued by
17 6%.
The evidence suggests that strict PPP does not hold, but
recent research suggests that the Big Mac test may shed
some insights about where exchange rates are headed. The
average price of a Big Mac in the European Monetary Union
(EMU) is €4 88. This implies that the euro’s PPP is €0 82; so
at its current rate of €0 74, the euro is overvalued by
approximately 12%. When the regression results are
considered, the euro is overvalued by approximately 21%.
The
currencies
of
Norway,
Switzerland,
and
Sweden
(3 European countries that are not part of the EMU) are
also overvalued; however, the currencies of Brazil and
Venezuela are even more overvalued. The currencies of
Hong Kong, India, South Africa, and Taiwan are significantly
undervalued relative to the dollar. Consumers in these
countries will find that domestic goods are less expensive
than foreign imports.
One last benefit of the Big Mac test is that it tells us the
cheapest places to find a Big Mac. If we look at the raw “Big
Mac Index” numbers, the “cheapest” burger is in India,6
while the most expensive burger is in Venezuela. However,
when we adjust for GDP, the most expensive burger is in
Brazil and the cheapest burger is in Hong Kong.

in the United States and thus raise Ph, increase the supply of tennis shoes in the
United Kingdom and thus reduce Pf, and increase the demand for dollars in the
foreign exchange market and thus reduce the spot rate. Each of those actions
works to restore PPP.
Note that PPP assumes that there are no transportation or transactions costs
(or import restrictions) that would limit the ability to ship goods between coun-
tries. In many cases, these assumptions are incorrect, which explains why PPP is
often violated. An additional complication, when empirically testing to see
whether PPP holds, is that products in different countries are rarely identical.
Frequently, there are real or perceived differences in quality, which can lead to
price differences in different countries.
Still, the concepts of interest rate parity and purchasing power parity are
critically important to those engaged in international activities. Companies and
investors must anticipate changes in interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates;
and they often try to hedge the risks of adverse movements in those factors. The
parity relationships are extremely useful when anticipating future conditions.
17-8 INFLATION, INTEREST RATES, AND EXCHANGE RATES
Relative inflation rates, or the rates of inflation in foreign countries compared with
that in the home country, have two key implications for multinational firms:
(1) Relative inflation rates influence future production costs at home and abroad,
and (2) inflation has an important effect on relative interest rates and exchange
rates. Both of those factors influence multinational corporations’ financing deci-
sions and the profitability of foreign investments.
The currencies of countries with higher inflation rates than the U.S. inflation
rate, by definition, depreciate over time against the dollar. Countries in which this
has occurred include Mexico and all the South American nations. On the other
hand, the currencies of Switzerland and Japan, which have had less inflation than
the United States, have appreciated against the dollar. In fact, a foreign currency will,
on average, depreciate or appreciate at a percentage rate approximately equal to the
amount by which its inflation rate is over or under the U.S. inflation rate.
Relative inflation also affects interest rates. Indeed, the interest rate in any
country is largely determined by its inflation rate. So countries with higher infla-
tion rates than the U.S. inflation rate also have higher interest rates, and the
reverse is true for countries with lower inflation rates.
It is tempting for a multinational corporation to borrow in countries with the
lowest interest rates. However, this is not always a good strategy. Suppose, for
example, that interest rates in Switzerland are lower than those in the United
States because of Switzerland’s lower inflation rate. A U.S. multinational firm
could therefore reduce its interest expense by borrowing in Switzerland. However,
because of relative inflation rates, the Swiss franc will probably appreciate in the
future, causing the dollar cost of annual interest and principal payments on Swiss
S E L F T E S T
What is purchasing power parity?
A television set sells for 1,000 U.S. dollars. In the spot market, $1 = 110 Japanese
yen. If purchasing power parity holds, what should be the price (in yen) of the
same television set in Japan? (¥110,000)
Price differences in “similar” products in different countries often exist. What can
explain those differences?

debt to rise over time. Thus, the lower interest rate could be more than offset by losses
from currency appreciation. Similarly, multinational corporations should not neces-
sarily avoid borrowing in a country such as Brazil, where interest rates have been
very high, because future depreciation of the Brazilian real could make such
borrowing relatively inexpensive.
17-9 INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS
One way for U.S. citizens to invest in world markets is to buy the stocks of U.S.
multinational corporations that invest directly in foreign countries. Another way
is to purchase foreign securities—stocks, bonds, or money market instruments
issued by foreign companies. Security investments are known as portfolio
investments, and they are distinguished from direct investments in physical assets
by U.S. corporations.
For a time after World War II, the U.S. capital markets dominated world
markets. Today, however, the value of U.S. securities represents one third the
value of all securities. Given this situation, it is important for both corporate
managers and investors to understand international markets. Moreover, these
markets often offer better opportunities for raising or investing capital than are
available domestically.
17-9A INTERNATIONAL CREDIT MARKETS
There are three major types of international credit markets. The first type is the
market for floating-rate bank loans, called eurocredits, whose rates are tied to
LIBOR, which stands for London Interbank Offer Rate. LIBOR is the interest rate
offered by the largest and strongest banks on large deposits. On June 11, 2013, the
3-month LIBOR rate was 0 27%. Eurocredits tend to be issued for a fixed term
with no early repayment. The oldest example of a eurocredit is a eurodollar
deposit, which is a U.S. dollar deposited in a bank outside the United States.
Today eurocredits exist for most major trading currencies.
The second type of market is the eurobond market. A eurobond is an inter-
national bond underwritten by an international bank and sold to investors in
countries other than the one in whose currency the bond is denominated. Thus,
U.S. dollar-denominated eurobonds are not sold in the United States, pound
eurobonds are not sold in the United Kingdom, and yen eurobonds are not sold
in Japan. These bonds are true international debt instruments and are usually
issued in bearer form, which means that the owner’s identity is not registered and
thus is not known. To receive interest payments the owner must clip a coupon and
present it for payment at one of the designated payor banks. Most eurobonds are
not rated by the rating agencies such as S&P or Moody’s, although a number of
them are starting to be rated. Eurobonds can be issued with either a fixed-rate
coupon or a floating-rate coupon depending on the preferences of the issuer, and
they have medium- or long-term maturities.
S E L F T E S T
What effects do relative inflation rates have on relative interest rates?
What happens over time to the currencies of countries with higher inflation rates
than U.S. inflation rates? To the currencies of countries with lower inflation rates?
Why might a multinational corporation decide to borrow in a country such as
Brazil, where interest rates are high, rather than in a country such as Switzerland,
where interest rates are low?

The third type of market is the foreign bond market. Foreign bonds are issued
in the country in whose currency the bond is denominated, and they are under-
written by investment banks in that country. However, the borrower is head-
quartered in a different country. For instance, a Canadian company might issue a
U.S. dollar-denominated bond in New York to fund its U.S. operations. Foreign
bonds issued in the United States are sometimes called “Yankee bonds.” Similarly,
“bulldogs” are foreign bonds issued in London, and “samurai bonds” are foreign
bonds issued in Tokyo. Foreign bonds can have either a fixed-rate coupon or a
floating-rate coupon, and they have the same maturities as the purely domestic
bonds with which they must compete for funds.
17-9B INTERNATIONAL STOCK MARKETS
New issues of stock are sold in international markets for a variety of reasons. For
example, a Turkish firm might sell an equity issue in the United States because it can
tap a much larger source of capital than in its home country. Also, a U.S. firm might
tap the Turkish market because it wants to create an equity market presence to
accompany its operations in that country. Occasionally, large multinational compa-
nies also issue new stock simultaneously in multiple countries. For example, Alcan
Aluminum, a Canadian company, simultaneously issued new stock in Canada,
Europe, and the United States using different underwriting syndicates in each market.
STOCK MARKET INDEXES AROUND THE WORLD
In Chapter 2, we described the major U.S. stock market
indexes. Similar market indexes also exist for each major
world financial center. The figure below compares four
of these indexes (Japan, Germany, Great Britain, and India)
against the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, the primary stock index is the Hang Seng.
Created by HSI Services Limited, the Hang Seng Index
reflects the performance of the Hong Kong stock market. It
is comprised of 49 domestic stocks (accounting for about
60% of the market’s capitalization), which are divided into
four subindexes: Commerce and Industry, Finance, Utilities,
and Properties.
Germany
The major indicator of the German stock market, the XETRA
DAX, is comprised of 30 German blue chip stocks. These
stocks are listed on the Frankfurt Exchange, and they are
representative of the industrial structure of the German
economy.
United Kingdom
The FT-SE 100 Index (pronounced “footsie”) is the most
widely followed indicator of equity investments in the Uni-
ted Kingdom. It is a value-weighted index comprised of the
100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange,
and its value is calculated every minute during the trading
session.
Japan
In Japan, the principal barometer of stock performance is
the Nikkei 225 Index. The index’s value, which is calculated
every minute throughout daily trading, consists of a collec-
tion of highly liquid equity issues thought to be representa-
tive of the Japanese economy.
Chile
The Santiago Stock Exchange has three main share indexes:
the General Stock Price Index (IGPA), the Selective Stock Price
Index (IPSA), and the INTER-10 Index. The IPSA, which reflects
the price variations of the most active stocks, is comprised of
40 of the most actively traded stocks on the exchange.
India
Of the 22 stock exchanges in India, the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) is the largest, with over 5,100 listed stocks
and approximately two-thirds of the country’s total trading
volume. Established in 1875, the exchange is also the oldest
in Asia. Its yardstick is the BSE Sensex (renamed S&P BSE
Sensex because of its partnership with S&P Dow Jones
Indices), an index of 30 publicly traded Indian stocks that
account for about 40% of the BSE’s market capitalization.
Spain
In Spain, the IBEX 35 is the official index for measuring
equity market performance. This index is comprised of the
35 most actively traded securities on the Madrid Stock
Exchange General Index.
Foreign Bonds
A type of international
bond issued in the
domestic capital market
of the country in whose
currency the bond is
denominated, and
underwritten by
investment banks from
the same country;
however, the borrower is
headquartered in a
different country.

In addition to new issues, outstanding stocks of large multinational compa-
nies are occasionally listed on several international exchanges. For example, IBM
is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange, and the
London Stock Exchange. Some 500 foreign stocks are listed in the United States—
one example is Royal Dutch Petroleum, which is listed on the NYSE. U.S. investors
also can invest in foreign companies through American Depository Receipts
(ADRs), which are certificates representing ownership of foreign stock held in
trust. Many ADRs are now available in the United States, with most of them
traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. However, more and more ADRs are
being listed on the New York Stock Exchange, including the United Kingdom’s
British Airways, Japan’s Honda Motors, and Italy’s Fiat Group.

17-10 INVESTING OVERSEAS
Investors should consider additional risk factors if they invest overseas. First,
there is country risk, which refers to the risk involved in investing in a particular
country. This risk depends on the country’s economic, political, and social envi-
ronment. Some countries provide a safer investment climate and, therefore, less
country risk than others. Examples of country risk include the risk that property
will be expropriated without adequate compensation in addition to risks asso-
ciated with changes in tax rates, regulations, and currency repatriation. Country
risk also includes changes in host-country requirements regarding local produc-
tion and employment as well as the danger of damage due to internal strife,
ranging from crippling strikes to terrorism and civil war.
It is especially important to keep in mind when investing overseas that
securities are often denominated in a currency other than the dollar, which means
that returns on the investment depend on what happens to exchange rates. This is
known as exchange rate risk. For example, if a U.S. investor purchases a Japanese
bond, interest will probably be paid in yen, which must then be converted into
Measuring Country Risk
Various forecasting services measure the level of country risk in
different countries and provide indexes that indicate factors such
as each country’s expected economic performance, access to
world capital markets, political stability, and level of internal
conflict. Country risk analysts use sophisticated models to mea-
sure risk, thus providing corporate managers and investors with a
way to judge both the relative and absolute risk of investing in
different countries. A sample of recent country risk estimates
compiled by Institutional Investor is presented in the accompany-
ing table. The higher a country’s score, the lower its country risk.
The maximum possible score is 100.

The countries with the least country risk all have strong,
market-based economies, ready access to worldwide capital mar-
kets, relatively little social unrest, a stable political climate, rela-
tively low inflation, and a sound currency. Norway’s top ranking
may surprise you, but it is the result of a strong economic
performance and political stability. You may also be surprised
that the United States was ranked 12th. At the lower end of the
range, there are fewer surprises. Each of these countries has
considerable social and political unrest and no market-based
economic system. An investment in any of these countries is
clearly a risky proposition.

Investing in International Stocks
As noted in Chapter 8, the U.S. stock market amounts to one-
third of the world stock market, and as a result many U.S.
investors hold at least some foreign stock. Analysts have long
touted the benefits of investing overseas, arguing that foreign
stocks both improve diversification and provide good growth
opportunities. When investing in international stocks, you need
to recognize that you are investing in both the foreign market
and the foreign currency. Table 17.4 indicates how stocks in each
country performed in 2012. Column 2 indicates how stocks in
each country performed in terms of the U.S. dollar, while Column
3 shows how the country’s stocks performed in terms of its local
currency. For example, in 2012 South African stocks rose by
21.3%, but the South African rand decreased by about 5% versus
the U.S. dollar. Therefore, if a U.S. investor had bought South
African stocks, he or she would have made 21.3% in South
African rand terms, but those South African rands would have
bought 5% fewer U.S. dollars, so the effective return only would
have been 15.4%. Thus, the results of foreign investments
depend both on the foreign market and on what happens to
the exchange rate. Indeed, when you invest overseas, you are
making two bets: (1) that foreign stocks will increase in their local
markets, and (2) that the currencies in which you will be paid will
rise relative to the dollar. For many countries shown in Table 17.4,
both of these factors were favorable in 2012.

dollars before the investor can spend his or her money in the United States. If the
yen weakens relative to the dollar, it will buy fewer dollars and fewer dollars will
be received when funds are repatriated. However, if the yen strengthens, the
effective investment return will increase. It therefore follows that returns on a
foreign investment depend on the in-country performance of the foreign security
and on changes in exchange rates.

17-11 INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL BUDGETING
Up to now, we have discussed the general environment in which multinational
firms operate. In the remainder of the chapter, we discuss how international
factors affect key corporate decisions. We begin with capital budgeting. Although
the same basic principles of capital budgeting apply to both foreign and domestic
operations, there are some key differences. First, cash flow estimation is more
complex for overseas investments. Most multinational firms set up separate sub-
sidiaries for each foreign country in which they operate, and the relevant cash
flows for the parent company are the dividends and royalties paid by the sub-
sidiaries to the parent. Second, these cash flows must be converted into the parent
company’s currency, so they are subject to exchange rate risk. For example, Coca-
Cola’s German subsidiary may make a profit of 100 million euros in 2014, but the
value of this profit to Coca-Cola will depend on the dollar/euro exchange rate:
How many dollars will 100 million euros buy?
Dividends and royalties are normally taxed by both foreign and home-country
governments. Furthermore, a foreign government may restrict the repatriation of
earnings to the parent company. For example, some governments place a ceiling,
often stated as a percentage of the company’s net worth, on the amount of cash
dividends that a subsidiary can pay to its parent. Such restrictions are normally
intended to force multinational firms to reinvest earnings in the foreign country,
although restrictions are sometimes imposed to prevent large currency outflows
that might disrupt the exchange rate.
Whatever the host country’s motivation for blocking repatriation of profits,
the result is that the parent corporation cannot use cash flows blocked in the
foreign country to pay dividends to its shareholders or to invest elsewhere in the
business. Hence, from the perspective of the parent organization, the cash flows that
are relevant for foreign investment analysis are those that the subsidiary is actually
expected to send back to the parent. The present value of those cash flows is found
by applying an appropriate discount rate, and this present value is then compared
with the parent’s required investment to determine the project’s NPV.
In addition to the complexities of the cash flow analysis, the cost of capital may
be different for a foreign project than for an equivalent domestic project because foreign
projects may be more or less risky. Higher risks might arise from (1) exchange rate
risk and (2) political risk. A lower risk might result from the benefits of interna-
tional diversification.
The foreign currency cash flows to be turned over to the parent must be
converted into U.S. dollars by translating them at expected future exchange rates.
An analysis should be conducted to ascertain the effects of exchange rate varia-
tions; and on the basis of this analysis, an exchange rate risk premium should be
added to the domestic cost of capital to reflect this risk. It is sometimes possible to
hedge against exchange rate fluctuations; but this may not be possible, especially
on long-term projects. If hedging is used, the costs of doing so must be subtracted
from the project’s cash flows.

Political risk refers to potential actions by a host government that would
reduce the value of a company’s investment. It includes at one extreme the
expropriation without compensation of the subsidiary’s assets; but it also includes
less drastic actions that reduce the value of the parent firm’s investment in the
foreign subsidiary, including higher taxes, tighter repatriation or currency con-
trols, and restrictions on prices charged. The risk of expropriation is small in
traditionally friendly and stable countries such as the United Kingdom and
Switzerland. However, in Latin America, Africa, the Far East, and Eastern Europe,
the risk may be substantial. Past expropriations include those of ITT and Ana-
conda Copper in Chile; Gulf Oil in Bolivia; Occidental Petroleum in Libya; and the
assets of many companies in Iraq, Iran, and Cuba.
Note that companies can take several steps to reduce the potential loss from
expropriation: (1) finance the subsidiary with local capital, (2) structure operations
so that the subsidiary has value only as a part of the integrated corporate system,
and (3) obtain insurance against economic losses due to expropriation from a
source such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). In the latter
case, insurance premiums would have to be added to the project’s cost.
Several organizations rate the country risk, or the risk associated with investing
in a particular country. (Refer back to the Global Perspectives box titled, “Measur-
ing Country Risk,” for one source.) These ratings are based on the country’s social,
political, and economic environment—its business climate. Note that most of these
studies suggest that the United States does not have the lowest level of country risk.
This is particularly significant because even though people in the United States
often assume that its bonds have no country risk, others do not agree. Foreign
investors are concerned about how changes in U.S. policies (e.g., tax or Federal
Reserve policies) might affect their investments. To the extent that these perceptions
about U.S. country risk influence investors’ willingness to hold U.S. securities, they
will have an effect on U.S. interest rates. Recently, these issues have become
increasingly relevant in the face of growing concerns about current and projected
levels of U.S. government debt. These concerns dramatically came to light in August
2011 when Standard & Poor’s downgraded U.S. government bonds from its long-
held AAA status to AA+. (In June 2013, S&P reaffirmed the AA+ rating.)
17-12 INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL STRUCTURES
Capital structures vary across countries. For example, the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that, on average, Japanese
firms have 85% debt to total assets (in book value terms), German firms have 64%,
and U.S. firms have 55%. One problem, however, when interpreting these

domestic operations.
What are the relevant cash flows for an international investment—the cash flows
produced by the subsidiary in the country in which it operates or the cash flows
in dollars that it sends to its parent company? Explain.
Why might the cost of capital for a foreign project differ from that of an
equivalent domestic project? Could it be lower? Explain.
What adjustments might be made to the domestic cost of capital for a foreign

numbers is that different countries often use different accounting conventions
with regard to (1) reporting assets on a historical-cost versus a replacement-cost
basis, (2) treating leased assets, (3) reporting pension plan liabilities, and (4) capi-
talizing versus expensing R&D costs. These differences make it difficult to com-
pare capital structures.
A 1995 study by Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales of the University of
Chicago attempted to control for different accounting practices. In their study,
Rajan and Zingales used a database that covers fewer firms than the OECD but
one that provides a more complete breakdown of balance sheet data. They con-
cluded that differences in accounting practices can explain much but not all of the
cross-country variations.
Rajan and Zingales’s results are summarized in Table 17.5. There are a
number of different ways to measure capital structure. One way is the average
ratio of total liabilities to total assets—this is similar to the measure used by the
OECD, and it is reported in Column 1. Based on this measure, German and
Japanese firms appear to be more highly leveraged than U.S. firms. However, if
you look at Column 2, where capital structure is measured by interest-bearing
debt to total assets, it appears that German firms use less leverage than U.S. and
Japanese firms. What explains this difference? Rajan and Zingales argue that much
of this difference is explained by the way German firms account for pension
liabilities. German firms generally include all pension liabilities (and their off-
setting assets) on the balance sheet, whereas firms in other countries (including the
United States) generally “net out” pension assets and liabilities on their balance
sheets. To see the importance of this difference, consider a firm with $10 million in
liabilities (not including pension liabilities) and $20 million in assets (not including
pension assets). Assume that the firm has $10 million in pension liabilities that are
fully funded by $10 million in pension assets. Therefore, net pension liabilities are
zero. If this firm was in the United States, it would report a ratio of total liabilities
to total assets equal to 50% ($10 million/$20 million). By contrast, if this firm
operated in Germany, both its pension assets and liabilities would be reported on
the balance sheet. The firm would have $20 million in liabilities and $30 million in
assets—or a 67% ($20 million/$30 million) ratio of total liabilities to total assets.

Total debt is the sum of short-term debt and long-term debt and excludes other
liabilities including pension liabilities. Therefore, the measure of total debt to total
assets provides a more comparable measure of leverage across different countries.
Rajan and Zingales also make a variety of adjustments that attempt to control
for other differences in accounting practices. The effects of these adjustments are
reported in Columns 3 and 4. Overall, the evidence suggests that companies in
Germany and the United Kingdom tend to have less leverage, whereas firms in
Canada appear to have more leverage relative to firms in the United States,
France, Italy, and Japan. This conclusion is supported by data in the final column,
which shows the average times-interest-earned ratio for firms in a number of
different countries. Recall from Chapter 4 that the TIE ratio is the ratio of operat-
ing income (EBIT) to interest expense. This measure indicates how much cash the
firm has available to service its interest expense. In general, firms with more
leverage have a lower times-interest-earned ratio. The data indicate that this ratio
is highest in the United Kingdom and Germany and lowest in Canada.
Over the past two decades, the global economy has become increasingly inte-
grated and more companies generate more of their profits from overseas opera-
tions. In many respects, the concepts developed in the first 16 chapters still apply
to multinational firms. However, multinational companies have more opportunities
but also face different risks than do companies that operate only in their home
market. The chapter discussed many of the key trends affecting the global markets
today, and it described the most important differences between multinational and
domestic financial management.

MULTINATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Yohe Telecommunications is a multinational
corporation that produces and distributes telecommunications technology. Although its
corporate headquarters are located in Maitland, Florida, Yohe usually buys its raw materi-
als in several different foreign countries using several different foreign currencies.
The matter is further complicated because Yohe often sells its products in other foreign
countries. One product in particular, the SY-20 radio transmitter, draws Component X,
Component Y, and Component Z (its principal components) from Switzerland, France, and
the United Kingdom, respectively. Specifically, Component X costs 165 Swiss francs,
Component Y costs 20 euros, and Component Z costs 105 British pounds. The largest
market for the SY-20 is Japan, where the product sells for 42,000 Japanese yen. Naturally,
Yohe is intimately concerned with economic conditions that could adversely affect dollar
exchange rates. You will find Tables 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3 useful for completing this problem.
a. How much in dollars does it cost Yohe to produce the SY-20? What is the dollar sale
price of the SY-20?
b. What is the dollar profit that Yohe makes on the sale of the SY-20? What is the
percentage profit?
c. If the U.S. dollar was to weaken by 10% against all foreign currencies, what would be
the dollar profit for the SY-20?
d. If the U.S. dollar was to weaken by 10% only against the Japanese yen and remained
constant relative to all other foreign currencies, what would be the dollar and percen-
tage profits for the SY-20?
e. Using the 180-day forward exchange information from Table 17.3, calculate the return
on 1-year securities in Switzerland assuming the rate of return on 1-year securities in the
United States is 4 9%.
f. Assuming that purchasing power parity (PPP) holds, what would be the sale price of
the SY-20 if it was sold in the United Kingdom rather than Japan?

MULTINATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Citrus Products Inc. is a medium-sized producer of citrus
juice drinks with groves in Indian River County, Florida. Until now, the company has confined its
operations and sales to the United States; but its CEO, George Gaynor, wants to expand into the Pacific
Rim. The first step is to set up sales subsidiaries in Japan and Australia, then to set up a production plant
in Japan, and finally to distribute the product throughout the Pacific Rim. The firm’s financial manager,
Ruth Schmidt, is enthusiastic about the plan, but she worries about the implications of the foreign
expansion on the firm’s financial management process. She has asked you, the firm’s most recently hired
financial analyst, to develop a 1-hour tutorial package that explains the basics of multinational financial
management. The tutorial will be presented at the next board of directors meeting. To get you started,
Schmidt has given you the following list of questions.
a. What is a multinational corporation? Why do firms expand into other countries?
b. What are the five major factors that distinguish multinational financial management from financial
management as practiced by a purely domestic firm?
c. Consider the following illustrative exchange rates:
U.S. Dollars Required to
Buy One Unit of
Foreign Currency
Japanese yen
0.009
Australian dollar
0.650
1. Are these currency prices direct quotations or indirect quotations?
2. Calculate the indirect quotations for yen and Australian dollars.
3. What is a cross rate? Calculate the two cross rates between yen and Australian dollars.
4. Assume that Citrus Products can produce a liter of orange juice and ship it to Japan for $1 75.
If the firm wants a 50% markup on the product, what should the orange juice sell for in Japan?
5. Now assume that Citrus Products begins producing the same liter of orange juice in Japan. The
product costs 250 yen to produce and ship to Australia, where it can be sold for 6 Australian
dollars. What is the U.S. dollar profit on the sale?
6. What is exchange rate risk?
d. Briefly describe the current international monetary system. What are the different types of exchange
rate systems?
e. What is the difference between spot rates and forward rates? When is the forward rate at a premium
to the spot rate? When is it at a discount?
f. What is interest rate parity? Currently, you can exchange 1 yen for 0 0095 U.S. dollar in the 30-day
forward market, and the risk-free rate on 30-day securities is 4% in both Japan and the United States.
Does interest rate parity hold? If not, which securities offer the highest expected return?
g. What is purchasing power parity (PPP)? If grapefruit juice costs $2 a liter in the United States and
purchasing power parity holds, what should be the price of grapefruit juice in Australia?
h. What effect does relative inflation have on interest rates and exchange rates?
i. 1. Briefly explain the three major types of international credit markets.
2. Briefly explain how ADRs work.
j. What is the effect of multinational operations on capital budgeting decisions?
k. To what extent do average capital structures vary across different countries?

g. Before we can calculate the firm’s EVA, we need to calculate the firm’s
total invested capital. We know that the firm uses no preferred stock

provided in the problem we know:
Accounts payable

We calculated common equity in Part e, so the only value we don’t
know on the balance sheet is long-term debt. However, we have enough
information to calculate it:
Long-term debt
$29,000,000
$17,400,000
$6,000,000
Long-term debt
$5,600,000
Now, we can find the firm’s total invested capital:

Total invested capital
$2,000,000
$5,600,000
$17,400,000

Now, we can calculate the firm’s EVA:

Billingsworth paid $2 in dividends and retained $2 per share. Since total
retained earnings rose by $12 million, there must be 6 million shares
outstanding. With a book value of $40 per share, total common equity
must be $40 6 million
$240 million. Since Billingsworth has $120 mil-
lion of total debt, its total debt to total capital ratio must be 33 3%:

c. This problem can be approached in several ways. Perhaps the simplest
is to ask this question: “If I received $750 on 1/1/15 and deposited it
to earn 8%, would I have the required $1,000 on 1/1/18?” The answer
is no.

!750
FV = ?

$944 78
This indicates that you should let your father make the payments of
$221 92 rather than accept the lump sum of $750 on January 1, 2015.
You could also compare the $750 with the PV of the payments as
shown below:
1/1/14
1/1/15
1/1/16
1/1/17
1/1/18

Using a financial calculator, input N
4, I YR

−221 92,
FV
0, and PV
Solve for PV
$735 03.
This is less than the $750 lump sum offer, so your initial reaction
might be to accept the lump sum of $750. However, this would be a
mistake. The problem is that when you found the $735 03 PV of the
annuity, you were finding the value of the annuity today, on January 1,
2014. You were comparing $735 03 today with the lump sum of $750
one year from now. This is, of course, not correct. What you should
have done was take the $735 03, recognize that this is the PV of an
annuity as of January 1, 2014, multiply $735 03 by 1 08 to get $793 83,
and compare $793 83 with the lump sum of $750. You would then take
your father’s offer to make the payments of $221 92 rather than take the
lump sum on January 1, 2015.

same effective annual rate of 8 24%. The difference in their quoted rates is
due to the difference in compounding frequency.

Therefore, you would have written a check for $875 11 to complete
the transaction. Of this amount, $20 = 1 3 ($60) would represent
accrued interest and $855 11 would represent the bond’s basic
value. This breakdown would affect both your taxes and those
of the seller.

This problem could be solved very easily using a spreadsheet or a
financial calculator with a bond valuation function, such as the
HP-12C or the HP-17BII. This is explained in the calculator
manual under the heading, “Bond Calculations.”

VDC will purchase bonds on the open market if they’re selling at
less than par. So, the sinking fund payment will be less than
$5,000,000 each period.
b. The debt service requirements will decline. As the amount of bonds
outstanding declines, so will the interest requirements (amounts given
in millions of dollars). If the bonds are called at par, the total bond
service payments are calculated as follows:

dividends ($3 versus $1). We cannot say which stock should have the
higher price.

The total expected return for G will have D1 P0 less than 12% and g

total expected return, 12%, because the two stocks are stated to be
equally risky.

To solve for each project’s IRR, find the discount rates that equate each
NPV to zero:
IRRX

Note that all methods rank Project X over Project Y. In addition, both

both projects should be accepted if they are independent.
c. In this case, we would choose the project with the higher NPV at
r

d. To determine the effects of changing the cost of capital, plot the NPV
profiles of each project. The crossover rate occurs between 6% and 7%
(≈6 22%). See the graph on the next page.
If the firm’s cost of capital is less than 6 22%, a conflict exists
because NPVY

would
exist.
Note,
however,
that
when
r

MIRRX
10 64% and MIRRY
10 83%; hence, the modified IRR ranks
the projects correctly, even if r is to the left of the crossover point.
e. The basic cause of the conflict is differing reinvestment rate assumptions
between NPV and IRR. NPV assumes that cash flows can be reinvested
at the cost of capital, while IRR assumes reinvestment at the (generally)
higher IRR. The high reinvestment rate assumption under IRR makes
early cash flows especially valuable, and hence short-term projects look
better than long-term projects under IRR.

Because the ROA exceeds Olinde’s average cost of capital, this
analysis suggests that the firm should go ahead and make the
investment.
b. The change would increase the breakeven point. Still, with a lower sales
price, it might be easier to achieve the higher new breakeven volume.

The return on the new investment still exceeds the average cost of
capital, so the firm should make the investment.

d. Carlisle’s WACC is minimized at a capital structure consisting of 25%
debt and 75% equity. At that capital structure, the firm’s WACC is
8 73%.
e. The capital structure at which the firm’s WACC is minimized is the
optimal capital structure, i.e., the capital structure at which the firm’s
value is maximized. For Carlisle, this capital structure consists of 25%
debt and 75% equity. This is not the same capital structure at which
EPS is maximized, because the additional risk taken on is not
measured in the EPS calculation, but it is measured in the WACC
calculation. (That is, the costs of debt and equity increase at
additional debt levels, and those component costs are used in the
WACC calculation.)
f. As an analyst (on the basis of these data), the recommendation to the
firm
would
be
to
issue
$1,250,000
of
debt
(calculated
as
0 25
$5,000,000) with a 6% coupon rate (this is rd at this debt
level), and use these funds to repurchase 50,000 shares of common
stock.

Although CMC has suffered a severe setback, its existing assets will
continue to provide a good income stream. More of these earnings
should now be passed on to the shareholders, as the slowed internal
growth has reduced the need for funds. However, the net result is a
25% decrease in the value of the shares.
d. If the payout ratio were continued at 20%, even after internal
investment opportunities had declined, the price of the stock would
drop to $2
0 14 −0 06
$25 rather than to $75 00. Thus, an increase
in the dividend payout is consistent with maximizing shareholder
wealth.
Because of the diminishing nature of profitable investment oppor-
tunities, the greater the firm’s level of investment, the lower the aver-
age ROE. Thus, the more money CMC retains and invests, the lower its
average ROE will be. We can determine the average ROE under dif-
ferent conditions as follows:
Old situation (with founder active and a 20% payout):
g
1 0
Payout ratio Average ROE
12%
1 0
0 2 Average ROE
Average ROE
12% 0 8
15%
rs
14%
Note that the average ROE is 15%, whereas the marginal ROE is pre-
sumably equal to 14%.
New situation (with founder retired and a 60% payout as explained in Part c):
g
6%
1 0
0 6 ROE
ROE
6% 0 4
15%
rs
14%
This suggests that a new payout of 60% is appropriate and that the firm
is taking on investments down to the point at which marginal returns
are equal to the cost of capital. Note that if the 20% payout was
maintained, the average ROE would be only 7 5%, which would imply
a marginal ROE far below the 14% cost of capital.

The Vanderheiden Press has a higher ROE when short-term interest
rates are high, whereas Herrenhouse Publishing does better when rates
are lower.
c. Herrenhouse’s position is riskier. First, its profits and return on equity
are much more volatile than Vanderheiden’s. Second, Herrenhouse
must renew its large short-term loan every year, and if the renewal
comes up at a time when money is very tight, when its business is
depressed, or both, then Herrenhouse could be denied credit, which
could put it out of business.

To solve this problem, we will define
S as the change in sales and g as
the growth rate in sales, and then we use the three following equations:

Assets consist of cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories,
and fixed assets. Therefore, we can break the A0 S0 ratio into its com-
ponents—cash/sales, inventories/sales, and so forth. Then,

A0

We know that the inventory turnover ratio is Sales Inventories
3 times, so Inventories Sales
1 3
0 3333. Further, if the inventory
turnover ratio can be increased to 4 times, then the Inventory/Sales ratio
will fall to 1 4
0 25, a difference of 0 3333
0 2500
0 0833. This, in
turn, causes the A0
S0 ratio to fall from A0

1 6 to A0
S0

0 0833
1 5167.
This change has two effects: First, it changes the AFN equation, and
second, it means that Weatherford currently has excessive inventories.
Because it is costly to hold excess inventories, Weatherford will want to
reduce its inventory holdings by not replacing inventories until the excess
amounts have been used. We can account for this by setting up the revised
AFN equation (using the new A0
S0 ratio), estimating the funds that will
be needed next year if no excess inventories are currently on hand, and
then subtracting out the excess inventories that are currently on hand:
Present conditions:
Sales
Inventories
$100
Inventories
3,
so
Inventories
$100 3
$33 3 million at present
New conditions:
Sales
Inventories
$100
Inventories
4
so
New level of inventories
$100 4
$25 million
Therefore,
Excess inventories
$33 3
$25
$8 3 million
