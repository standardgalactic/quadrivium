Preface
In 1995, the first edition of Understanding Smart Sensors stated that, “By the year 
2000, 50% of all engineers will design with sensors, up from 16% who routinely 
used them at the beginning of the decade,” according to Dana Gardner [1]. While 
the statistic of 50% of engineers should certainly encourage those interested in 
designing and developing smart sensors, the 2012 third edition cites considerably 
higher expectations. Peter Hartwell, a senior researcher at Hewlett-Packard Labo­
ratories said, “With a trillion sensors embedded in the environment, all connected 
by computing systems, software and services, it will be possible to hear the heart­
beat of the Earth, impacting human interaction with the globe as profoundly as 
the Internet has revolutionized communication” [2]. Timing of when the trillion 
sensors occurs range from 2017 to early in the following decade. In any case, these 
sensors will consist primarily of digital microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) 
devices that will certainly be considered smart.
MEMS sensors have certainly come of age within the past ten years. Two of the 
leading suppliers, STMicroelectronics [3] and the Bosch Group [4] each announced 
cumulative sales of over two billion units in 2012. MEMS technology is used in 
well over 90% of the pressure sensors made today.
While sensors are used in all markets, the consumer and automotive market 
segments constitute 40% of the sensor sales according to Databeans [5]. Sensor 
revenue is forecasted to increase to $853 million by the end of 2012 for the con­
sumer segment and $203 million for the automotive segment.
According to Yole Développement, “Sensors, especially MEMS sensors, are be­
coming the center of all systems, enabling them to interact with the external world 
and sense what is happening” [6].  
With these high expectations for sensing technology, engineers and students 
should be excited about their potential to contribute and grow professionally—if 
they are involved in the right areas. This book’s intent is to identify many of the 
most interesting and promising smart sensor areas for today and the future. In 
more than a few instances, it is left to the reader to determine the proper choice or 
choices to pursue. 
W. Ko of Case Western Reserve University established a vision for intelligent 
sensors in his paper [7]. Joe Giachino of Ford Motor Company is frequently given 
credit for the term smart sensor based on his 1986 paper [8]. Several others (Mid­
delhoek, Brignell, etc.) will claim part of the credit for pioneering the concept of 
smart sensors with capabilities beyond simple signal conditioning. The communi­
cation of sensory information is finally requiring consensus for the true meaning 
of smart sensor.

Preface
The ultimate capabilities of new smart sensors will undoubtedly go far beyond 
today’s projections. An understanding of what is possible today and what can be 
expected in the near future is necessary to take the first step towards smarter sens­
ing systems. This book provides the reader with knowledge regarding a broad spec­
trum of possibilities based on current industry, university, and national laboratories 
R&D efforts in smart sensors. It discusses many recent developments that will 
impact sensing technology and future products.
In this third edition, every chapter has undergone extensive updating and the 
addition of new material, including several dozen figures and examples of current 
technologies from numerous companies. Yet, some of the original material, which 
provided the fundamentals and established the sensing capabilities currently used 
in production sensors at the time of the release of this third edition, have been re­
tained. Chapters 14 and 15 focus on two of the hottest topics in sensing that are 
critical to the future of smart sensing: sensor fusion and energy harvesting. Other 
chapters identify the role and challenges involved with other twenty-first century 
sensor areas, such as sensor apps, cloud sensing, trusted sensing, and more. The ad­
dition to this edition of an application example at the end of every chapter provides 
insight into the critical role of the technology discussed in that chapter to a specific 
end product. With the blend of historical and the latest content, the third edition of

Smart Sensor Basics
Smart sensors are becoming integral parts of systems performing functions that 
previously could not be performed or were not economically viable. 
—Joe Giachino (1986) [1] 
1.1  Introduction
Today, just about everything in the technology area is a candidate for having a 
“smart” prefix added to it.  The term smart sensor was coined in the mid-1980s 
and, since that time, several products have been referred to as smart sensors. The 
intelligence required by these devices is available from microcontroller (MCU), digi­
tal signal processor (DSP), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or field 
programmable gate array (FPGA) technologies developed by several semiconductor 
manufacturers. Some of these same semiconductor manufacturers are also actively 
working on smarter silicon devices for the input and output sides of the control 
system. In addition, the acceptance of smart sensors in many applications, espe­
cially portable consumer electronics, has attracted many new companies to focus 
on this area. The term microelectromechanical system (MEMS) is used to describe 
the structures created using semiconductor manufacturing processes for sensors and 
actuators. MEMS technology certainly provides many of the newest sensors, but 
other sensing techniques can also take advantage of the intelligence that advanced 
integrated circuits (ICs) enable. To understand what is occurring today when ad­
vanced microelectronic technology is applied to sensors, a brief review of the transi­
tions that have occurred is in order.
Before the availability of microelectronics, the sensors or transducers that were 
used to measure physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, or flow were 
usually directly coupled to a readout device, typically a meter that was read by an 
observer. The transducer converted the physical quantity being measured to a dis­
placement. The observer initiated system corrections to change the reading closer 
to a desired value. The typical blocks of a measurement system are shown in Figure 
1.1 [2].

Smart Sensor Basics
Older home thermostats, tire pressure gages, and factory flow meters dem­
onstrate this design approach. The advent of microprocessor technology initiated 
the requirement for sensors to have an electrical output that could be more read­
ily interfaced in order to provide unattended measurement and control. This also 
required the analog signal level to be amplified and converted to a digital format 
prior to being supplied to the process controller. Today’s MCUs and analog-to-dig­
ital (A/D) converters typically have a 5V power supply that has dictated the supply 
voltage for many amplified and signal conditioned sensors. The reduction in the 
supply voltage from 5V to 3.3V and even lower voltages, and the presence of more 
than one voltage in a system, pose challenges that are not typically associated with 
even the smartest sensors. Separate ICs are available to handle the variety of volt­
ages and resolve the problem, but they add to the system and sensor complexity.
Commonly used definitions for sensor and transducer must be the first in the 
list of many terms that will be defined either in this or the remaining chapters, and 
in the glossary that follows. A transducer is a device that converts energy from one 
domain into another, calibrated to minimize the errors in the conversion process 
[3]. A sensor is a device that provides a useful output to a specified measurand. The 
sensor is a basic element of a transducer, but may also refer to a detection of voltage 
or current in the electrical regime that does not require conversion. Throughout the 
remainder of this book, the terms will be used synonymously, since energy conver­
sion will be part of every device that is discussed. A list of mechanical measure­
ments that require a transducer to provide an electrical output is shown in Table 
1.1. 
The definition of smart sensor (or intelligent transducer) has not been as widely 
accepted and is subject to misuse. However, an Institute of Electrical and Elec­
tronic Engineers (IEEE) committee has consolidated terminology that applies to 
microelectronic sensors. The IEEE 1451.2 specification defines a smart sensor as 
a sensor that “provides functions beyond those necessary for generating a correct 
representation of a sensed or controlled quantity. This function typically simplifies 
the integration of the transducer into applications in a networked environment.” 
[3]. This definition provides a starting point for the minimum content of a smart 
sensor and focuses on industrial measurements. Chapter 13 addresses the IEEE-
approved smart transducer interface module (STIM) for sensors and actuators that 
establishes a standard for transducer-to-microprocessor communication protocols 
in a transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS) format. Companies commonly attri­
bute other capabilities to smart sensors that are not defined by industry standards.

1.2  Mechanical-Electronic Transitions in Sensing

1.2  Mechanical-Electronic Transitions in Sensing
An early indication of the transition from strictly mechanical sensing to electronic 
techniques is demonstrated in the area of temperature and position measurements. 
Thermistors and semiconductor temperature sensors that were lower in cost, smaller 
in size, and easier to interface with other circuit elements replaced thermocouples 
and expansion thermometers. In position measurements, variable reluctance sen­
sors with magnetic pickups have been replaced by the Hall-effect, optical, and mag­
netoresistive (MR) sensing elements. All of these techniques make use of a previous 
problem that detracted from the ideal performance of a transistor or integrated cir­
cuit. The sensitivity of transistors to temperature, light, magnetic fields, stress, and 
other physical variables is exploited in many of the existing semiconductor sensors.
The expanding range of parameters that can be sensed using semiconductor 
technology is part of the increasing interest in smart sensing. Using micromachin­
ing, or chemical etching techniques, mechanical structures have been produced in 
silicon, and these new silicon structures have greatly expanded the number and 
types of measurements that can be made.  For example, a rubber diaphragm con­
nected to a potentiometer has been replaced by a silicon diaphragm and piezoresis­
tive elements for measuring pressure.  This approach has been used in production 
sensors for over three decades.  More recently, the deflection or motion of cantile­
ver beams and other suspended structures manufactured in silicon is measured by 
resistive, capacitive, or other techniques for accelerometers and gyroscopes. Table 
1.2 shows a number of sensing techniques and their status relative to implementa­
tion in silicon sensors. Chapter 2 explains the fundamentals of micromachining 
that allow the fabrication of sensors and other MEMS devices in silicon and other 
materials, as well as  recent manufacturing processes used by companies to add ad­
ditional circuitry (the smarts) at the chip level.

Smart Sensor Basics
Sensor manufacturers have adapted processes used to manufacture advanced 
semiconductor technologies. As a result, sensors are manufactured, either concur­
rently or separately, that take advantage of the performance enhancements of in­
tegrated circuit (IC) technology by providing a significant step forward in sensing 
technology. Chapters 3 and 4 develop the interfacing and integration aspects for 
sensors.
1.3  Nature of Sensors
The output from most sensing elements is low-level, and is subject to several signal 
interference sources, as shown in the generalized model of a transducer (Figure 1.2) 
[4]. Self-generating transducers, such as piezoelectric devices, do not require a sec­
ondary input to produce an output signal. However, transducers based on resistive,

capacitive, and inductive sensing elements require excitation to provide an output. 
In addition to the desired input (e.g., pressure), undesired environmental effects, 
such as temperature, humidity, or vibration, are factors that affect the performance 
and accuracy of the transducer and must be taken into account during the design 
of the transducer. Compensation for these secondary parameters has historically 
been performed by additional circuitry. However, with smart sensing technology, 
the compensation can be integrated on the sensor or accomplished in the microcon­
troller or ASIC along with other functions.
The output of a micromachined piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor and the 
effect of temperature on both the span and offset are demonstrated in Figure 1.3 
[5]. Although the output is quite linear, in this case within 0.1% full scale (FS), the 
output varies due to the effect of temperature on the span of the sensor by about 
0.12 mV/°C. Since this signal level is insufficient to directly interface to a control 
IC, additional amplification and calibration are typically performed in the next 
stage of a transducer.
In a simple control system, the sensor is only one of three items required to 
implement a control strategy. The sensor provides an input to a controller with 
the desired strategy in its memory. The controller drives an output stage to modify 
or maintain the status of a load, such as a light, motor, solenoid, or a display. As 
shown in Figure 1.4, a signal conditioning interface typically exists between the 
sensor(s) and the controller, and between the controller and the output device. 
Smart sensing includes a portion of the controller’s functions in the sensor portion 
of the system. This means that software plays an increasingly important role in 
smart sensors. The power supply requirements for the electronics and the sensor 
represent an additional consideration that is important, as MCU voltages decrease 
and more sensors are used in battery-powered applications. The number of sup­
plies in this figure may not be required for a particular application, but they serve 
Figure 1.3  Effect of temperature on piezoresistive pressure sensor output.

Smart Sensor Basics
as a reminder for considering the available voltage for the sensor and the interface 
versus the rest of the system.
The smart-sensor models developed by several sources [6–8] have as many as 
six distinct elements for analog sensors. As shown in Figure 1.5, in addition to the 
sensing element and its associated amplification and signal conditioning, an A/D 
converter, memory of some type, and logic (control) capability are included in the 
smart sensor. Once the signal is in digital format, it can be communicated by sev­
eral communication protocols. The regulated power supply required for the system 
and its effect on system accuracy also must be taken into account. This is becom­
ing more of an issue, as power management issues are addressed in system design, 
especially battery-powered systems, and different supply voltages proliferate.
Reducing the number of discrete elements in a smart sensor (or in any system) 
is desirable in order to reduce the number of components, form factor, intercon­
nections, assembly cost, and frequently the component cost as well. The choices 
for how this integration occurs are often a function of the original expertise of the 
integrator. For example, as shown in Figure 1.6, a sensor manufacturer that already 
uses semiconductor technology (i.e., bipolar or metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)) 
for the sensing element may expand the capability and increase the value (and intel­
ligence) of the sensing unit it produces by combining the signal conditioning in the 
same package or in a sensor module. Through integration, the signal conditioning 
can also be combined at the same time the sensor is fabricated or manufactured.

1.3  Nature of Sensors

While the process of integration is more complex, the integrated sensor can 
be manufactured with the sensor, signal conditioning, and additional circuitry op­
timized for a particular application. Conversely, an MCU manufacturer using a 
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process typically integrates 
memory, A/D conversion, and additional circuitry to reduce the number of compo­
nents in the system. A variety of combinations are indicated in Figure 1.6. Process­
ing technology is a key factor. However, manufacturers must not only be willing 
to integrate additional system components, they must also achieve a cost-effective 
solution. Combinations of hybrid (package level) and monolithic integration will 
be discussed frequently in the remainder of this book and in much greater detail in 
Chapter 10. Different design philosophies, and the necessity to partition the sensor/
system at different points, can determine whether a smart sensor is purchased or,

alternatively, designed using a sensor signal processor, ASIC, or other components 
necessary to meet the desired performance of the end product.
The integration path can have a significant effect on the ultimate level of com­
ponent reduction. As shown in Figure 1.7 [9], the sensor, computing (CMOS mi­
crocontroller), and output side (power MOS) have increasing levels of monolithic 
integration. The choice of sensor technology, such as bipolar, can have a limiting 
effect on how far the integration can progress. For example, a bipolar sensor can 
increase integration levels by adding signal conditioning and progress to a mono­
lithic Level III sensor. Through package-level integration, a two-chip sensor con­
troller can be achieved by combining the sensor with a CMOS microcontroller. 
However, the highest level of monolithic integration, Level V, will only be realized 
by pursuing CMOS-compatible sensing, power control, and other system technolo­
gies. However, at Level V and earlier levels, package-level integration has proven to 
be an acceptable alternative.
Realizing the full potential of smart sensors requires a new approach to iden­
tify sensor applications. The list of “sensor” terms in Table 1.3 serves as a starting

point for rethinking the possibilities. Many of the terms are associated with a sys­
tem and not the sensor portion of the system.
When sensors are combined with an MCU, DSP, ASIC, or FPGA with the right 
amount and type of memory, the capability to obtain additional performance im­
provements is limited only by the capability of the computing element and the 
imagination of the designer. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 explain and develop some of 
these possibilities. In addition to signal transmission in distributed control systems 
through a variety of protocols described in Chapter 6, the possibilities of portable, 
wireless, and remote sensing are explored in Chapter 8. A broad variety of micro­
mechanical elements and additional system components are investigated in Chapter 
9. Packaging, testing, and reliability are among the challenges and limiting factors 
to higher levels of integration. Chapter 10 reveals the progress that is being made 
in these areas for production sensors. However, packaging, testing, and reliability 
continue to be some of the formidable challenges that must be addressed for smart 
sensors. The combination of the previously discussed system aspects is discussed in 
Chapter 11 with the addition of the system output and sensing systems. 
Chapter 12 presents what could be the milestone that is cited in the future for 
the turning point in the evolution of smart sensors. The availability and acceptance 
of standards can accelerate the development and use of smart sensors. Chapter 13 
provides some examples and explores the implications of standards that impact 
sensing.
Two of the more significant areas for smart sensors that have emerged since the 
second edition of this book are energy harvesting and sensor fusion. Chapter 14 
discusses energy harvesting, or the scavenging of energy from the application, such 
as vibration energy or the environment (e.g., solar energy) that promises to increase 
and change the nature of wireless sensor systems. Sensor fusion, a subset of infor­
mation fusion, combines different sensor capabilities and the extensive computa­
tional capabilities of modern computing techniques to achieve higher performance 
and accuracy levels than an individual sensor or sensing technology can achieve by 
itself. Chapter 15 provides examples of several existing sensor fusion techniques 
and products. Finally, based on the system-level complexity that is already possible 
and continuously evolving, a look into the not-too-distant future of smart sensing 
is shared in Chapter 16. 
1.4  Integration of Micromachining and Microelectronics
Increasing the performance and reliability, and reducing the cost of electronic cir­
cuits through increased integration, are standard expectations for semiconductor 
technology. However, in the area of semiconductor sensors, this integration was 
limited to the Hall effect and optoelectronic devices. The combination of microme­
chanical structures, sensing elements, and signal conditioning is the beginning of a 
new chapter in sensor technology. Combined microelectronics with micromechani­
cal structures have already significantly changed portable consumer products, such 
as smartphones, and promises to change future control systems and enable entirely 
new applications that were previously too costly for commercial purposes. MEMS 
(or simply microsystems technology) is used to describe the structures and func-

10

tions provided by micromachining and the addition of microelectronics to these 
structures.
A sensor with its own dedicated interface circuitry has several advantages. The 
sensor designer can trade off unnecessary performance characteristics for those 
that will provide desirable performance advantages to the sensor-interface combi­
nation. Normally, interface ICs are designed for a broad range of applications and 
these tradeoffs are not possible. This combination allows the sensor user to treat 
the sensor as a black box and to easily design a complex control system.
The integrated sensor takes advantage of integrated temperature sensing to 
more closely track the temperature of the sensing element, and compensates for 
the effects of temperature over the temperature range.  By reducing the number of 
internal connections, the reliability of integrated sensors is inherently better than a 
separate sensor and control circuit, even when the separate components are manu­
factured using a thin-film ceramic substrate. For a four-terminal sensor element, 
a reduction from dozens to an integer number of connections is possible using an 
integrated solution. Because the sensor provides the first information to a control 
system, the reliability of this information is critical to the entire system’s reliability.
Figure 1.8 is useful in analyzing the results of integrating the first two stages 
identified in Figure 1.7 to obtain the sensor portion of a Level IV system. The figure 
shows a cutaway view of InvenSense MPU-9150, a single-chip six-axis gyroscope, 
and accelerometer with onboard digital motion processor (DMP) hardware accel­
eration, along with a three-axis electronic compass (magnetometer) die to deliver 
an integrated nine-axis motion tracking solution in a single package [10].
One of the major advantages of integrated sensing and signal conditioning is 
the addition of calibration through on chip techniques, such as the laser trimming 
of thin-film resistors on the sensor die, and the subsequent ability to obtain part-
for-part replaceability at the component level. The amount of signal conditioning 
can vary. For example, the addition of thin film resistors and laser trimming to the 
sensing element are all that are necessary to produce a calibrated and temperature 
compensated sensor for disposable blood pressure applications.  For lower volume

cromachined structure (center element) mounted over the signal-conditioning circuitry. (Courtesy

11
applications, the requirement for unique transfer function or interface circuitry 
may not be cost effective. In these cases, the basic sensor with external circuitry is 
still the best choice. Eventually, these unique lower volume applications can also 
benefit from the advantages of integration.
Sensing and integrated sensing (sensing plus signal conditioning and/or other 
circuitry) are somewhat analogous to other mixed-signal processes that exist in 
semiconductors, especially for the power and smart power technology used in the 
output side of the control system. Smart-power technologies integrate CMOS as 
well as bipolar circuitry with multiple power metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistor (MOSFET) output devices. The process is more complex than a discrete 
power MOSFET, but the performance achieved by the combination of technolo­
gies provides a specific function, component reduction for increased reliability, and 
space reduction for lower cost assemblies and more than justifies the higher pro­
cessing cost. After a number of years of process and design improvements, smart-
power devices established broad market acceptance, especially for custom designs. 
Similarly, smarter sensors with integrated signal conditioning, logic, and other cir­
cuitry established market acceptance, and sensor designers expanded from a single 
sensor to multiple sensors and different types of sensors in the same semiconductor-
style package. 
Prior to the era of sensor integration, products that combine technology at 
the package level rather than the silicon level, have been the industry norm. A 
hybrid or module solution has the advantage of using proven available technology 
to achieve a more sophisticated product solution. This may be in a printed circuit 
board or ceramic substrate form.  The steps that can be taken toward increased 
monolithic or package-level integration are shown in Figure 1.9.
An example of a Level V, integrated smart sensor is shown in Figure 1.10. 
This concept example shows package-level integration to achieve a complete wire­
less sensing node including a radio frequency IC (RFIC). The accelerometer and 
pressure sensor are mounted on the signal conditioning ASIC. The MCU, with its 
integrated system-specific software, allows six degrees of freedom. The typically 
over-molded package cannot be distinguished externally from a single-chip semi­
conductor product. A commonly cited product for this type of integration is an 
integrated tire pressure monitor used to detect under and over-inflation problems 
in vehicles and warn of a pending tire failure.
1.5  Application Example
One of the more prominent examples of the capabilities that advanced smart sen­
sors bring to end products is the automatic screen orientation of smartphones and 
tablet computers enabled by multiaxis MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes. In 
answer to the Table 1.3 question of “What orientation has the user selected?”, 
several MEMS suppliers have provided accelerometers and gyroscopes for this ap­
plication. Introduced in the Apple iPhone in 2007 [11], accelerometer technology 
allowed the phone to sense when the user changed the orientation of the screen 
from portrait to landscape so that the image could be adjusted appropriately. How­
ever, even a three-axis accelerometer has limitations identifying all user orientations 
and operating modes, so another three-axis gyroscope or magnetometer is used to 

12

overcome the limitations of the accelerometer. Figure 1.11 [12] shows the output of 
the accelerometer alone compared to the combination of accelerometer and gyro­
scope output when the end product changes from landscape to portrait mode. The 
addition of a gyroscope provides six degrees of freedom to overcome the limitation 
of a three-axis accelerometer. The combination removes artifacts that occur with an 
accelerometer-only measurement.
With an accelerometer and other sensors in the system, suppliers, and system 
designers have already extended the capability to provide other features, such as 
indicating inactivity and transitioning to a sleep (low-power) mode to conserve

Semiconductor.)

energy in the battery-powered product.  Market research companies project strong 
growth for these types of combination or inertial combo sensors. For example, Yole 
Développement projects that 40% of the $2.7 billion consumer inertial market will 
be combination sensors by 2016 [13].
1.6  Summary
For many years, it has been possible to build a smart sensor for several measure­
ments with basically two semiconductor components—the sensor and the MCU. 
Several changes have occurred that have allowed many companies to take the nec­
essary steps to the next level. The smart money is being placed on areas that take 
advantage of the number of technologies that are available or in development that 
will continue to fundamentally change the nature of sensing, control systems, and 
aspects of everyday life. The remaining chapters discuss a variety of sensing con­
siderations and state-of-the-art developments that will allow those who understand 
how to apply these developments to create the next generation of products and 
systems.

Micromachining
If we go down far enough, all of our devices can be mass produced so that they are 
absolutely perfect copies of one another. 
—Richard P. Feynman, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” 1960 [1]
2.1  Introduction
Micromachining has caused the reinvestigation of every aspect of physics, chemis­
try, biology, and engineering. Thermodynamics, mechanics, optics, fluidics, acous­
tics, magnetics, electromagnetics, wave, kinetics, and nuclear forces, as well as 
medicine, robotics, displays, and instrumentation, are being investigated in aca­
demic, national, and/or industrial research and development (R&D) labs. Micro­
machining technology has enabled the extension of semiconductor-based sensing 
beyond temperature, magnetic, and optical effects to produce mechanical struc­
tures in silicon and sense mechanical phenomena. Many universities have created 
cross-departments and cross-college programs to explore the future possibilities of 
micromachined MEMS devices.
Micromachining is, in the most common usage, a chemical etching process for 
manufacturing three-dimensional microstructures that is consistent with semicon­
ductor processing techniques. However, micromachining is used for many mechan­
ical structures as well. (See Chapter 9). IC manufacturing processes used to make 
these microstructures include photolithography, thin-film deposition, and chemical 
and plasma etching. Bulk micromachining has been used to manufacture semicon­
ductor pressure sensors since the late 1970s. Additionally, newer techniques such as 
surface micromachining that achieve even smaller structures have been developed. 
The processing techniques for surface micromachining are more compatible with 
the CMOS processes used to manufacture integrated circuits. 
Silicon has many mechanical properties that make it ideal for mechanical struc­
tures. As indicated in Table 2.1, it has a modulus of elasticity (Young’s Modulus) 
comparable to steel, and a higher yield strength than that of steel or aluminum 
[2, 3]. Silicon has essentially perfect elasticity, which results in minimal mechanical 
hysteresis. (It is, however, a brittle material and will crack when stressed beyond its 
elastic limits). Also, silicon’s electrical properties have made it the material of choice 
in most integrated circuits that provide established manufacturing techniques for

many aspects of micromachined sensors. MEMS sensors take advantage of both the 
mechanical and electrical properties of silicon. However, products that fully exploit 
the combination of the mechanical and electrical properties are still in their infancy.
The relative ease of accomplishing both bulk and surface micromachining has 
led to many researchers investigating a variety of applications. Some of the areas 
being investigated will lead to smarter sensors through higher levels of integration. 
A key process associated with MEMS is the bonding of silicon to a silicon or sub­
strate material. The processes used for micromachining, associated processes, and 
the application of this technology to sensors are the items that will be covered in 
this chapter.
2.2  Bulk Micromachining
Bulk micromachining is a technique for making three-dimensional microstructures 
in which a masked silicon wafer is etched in an orientation-dependent etching solu­
tion [4]. Using micromachining technology, several wafers can be fabricated simul­
taneously, and lot-to-lot consistency is maintained by controlling a minimal number 
of parameters. Key parameters in bulk micromachining include crystallographic 
orientation, etchant, etchant concentration, semiconductor starting material, tem­
perature, and time. Photolithography techniques common in IC technology pre­
cisely define patterns for etching both sides of silicon wafers. The crystallographic 
orientation, etchant, and semiconductor starting material are chosen by design, 
leaving etchant concentration, temperature, and time as lot-to-lot control items. 
Silicon ICs are typically fabricated (manufactured) using <100> or <111> 
silicon. In bulk micromachining, an anisotropic (unidirectional) etchant, such as 
ethylene-diamine-pyrocatechol (EDP), hydrazine (N2H4), tetramethylammonium 
hydroxide (TMAH), or potassium hydroxide (KOH) attacks the <100> plane of 
silicon. The <100> plane is etched at a much faster rate than the <111> plane, typi­
cally 35 times faster. N-type silicon is etched at a much faster rate (>50 times faster) 
than p+-type, so n-type material is often used as the starting material. P+-type

material can be epitaxially grown on the wafer or diffused into the wafer to add 
a further control element in defining the dimensions. Agitation maintains uniform 
concentration during anisotropic etching. The characteristic shape (preferential 
etching) of anisotropic etching of <100> silicon is shown in the cross-section of 
Figure 2.1(a), which produces a 54.7° angle for the <100> silicon [5, 6]. The top 
view of etching into the surface of the silicon appears as a pyramid-shaped pit.
Etch rates of 1.0 to 1.5 µm/minute occur in the <100> plane of silicon with etch 
temperatures of 85°C to 115°C for common etchants such as EDP and KOH [7]. 
Isotropic etching, as shown in Figure 2.1(b), has etch rates that are independent of 
the crystallographic orientation. Isotropic etching allows undercut and cantilever 
structures to be produced. However, in bulk silicon it is more difficult to control 
than anisotropic etching and the level of agitation influences the results. Undercut­
ting and suspended structures are achieved with anisotropic etching with mask 
patterns and extended etch times. To expand the applications of micromachin­
ing, other chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), are used for etching the 
<100> and <110> plane. Also, other materials, such as silicon nitride, can be used

for the masking layer, as shown in Figure 2.1(c). Table 2.2 lists the etch rates of 
common materials, and additional etchants are shown in Section 2.5.2 [3]. The 
etch rates for 317 combinations of 16 materials (single-crystal silicon, doped, and 
undoped polysilicon, several types of silicon dioxide, stoichiometric and silicon-
rich silicon nitride, aluminum, tungsten, titanium, Ti/W alloy and two brands of 
photoresist) used in the fabrication of MEMS devices and ICs in 28 wet, plasma, 
and plasmaless-gas-phase etches have been reported in one study [8].
Etch stop techniques enhance the accuracy of wet chemical etching.  The most 
common techniques for etch depth control in bulk micromachining are shown in 
Figure 2.2 [7]. Precisely controlled diffusions (a), or epitaxially grown layers in the 
silicon crystal (b), or field enhanced depletion layers (c) slow down the etching pro­
cess at the interface allowing accurate structures to be obtained. Boron etch stops 
using EDP or TMAH can be used to produce layers as thick as 15–50 µm with oxide 
masking that is capable of protecting other areas of the chip for adding circuitry.
2.3  Wafer Bonding
In addition to micromachining, different types of wafer bonding are needed to pro­
duce more complex sensing structures. The attachment of silicon to a second silicon 
wafer or silicon to glass is an important aspect of semiconductor sensors. In fact, 
a clear dependence on wafer bonding as the enabling technology for high-volume 
MEMS has been identified [9]. Four different approaches to wafer bonding will be 
discussed.
2.3.1  Silicon-on-Silicon Bonding
A frequently used approach for manufacturing semiconductor pressure sensors 
uses a bulk micromachined diaphragm an isotropically etched into a silicon wafer. 
Figure 2.2  Etch-stop techniques in anisotropic etchants: (a) deep boron diffusion, (b) boron buried 
layer, and (c) p-n junction.

2.3  Wafer Bonding 
21
Piezoresistive sensing elements diffused or ion implanted into the thin diaphragm 
are either a 4-element Wheatstone bridge, or a single element positioned to maxi­
mize the sensitivity to shear stress [10]. Two silicon wafers are often used to produce 
the piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor. Figure 2.3 shows a two-layer silicon-on-
silicon pressure sensor [10].  The top wafer is etched until a thin square diaphragm 
approximately 0.001 inch (25.6 µm) in thickness is achieved.  The square area 
and the 54.7° angle of the cavity wall are extremely reproducible.  In addition to 
a sealed reference cavity for absolute pressure measurements, the two-layer silicon 
sensor allows atmospheric, or a reference pressure, to be applied to one side of the 
sensor by an inlet hole that is micromachined in the silicon bottom (constraint) 
wafer.  Several methods are used to attach the top wafer to the bottom, including 
anodic bonding, glass frit seal, and direct wafer (silicon-to-silicon) bonding, or sili­
con fusion bonding. 
The sensor shown in Figure 2.3 uses a glass frit, or paste, to attach the top 
wafer to the bottom wafer. The paste is applied to the bottom (constraint) wafer 
that is then thermocompression bonded to the top wafer containing the bulk mi­
cromachined pressure sensing structure.  The bottom wafer contains the glass and 
provides stress isolation and allows a reference vacuum to be sealed inside the 
combined structure.
To extend the pressure capability to very low-pressure readings (≤ 2 inches or 
5 centimeters of water) and minimize nonlinearity, several different approaches are 
being pursued. These approaches include: silicon bosses used as stress concentra­
tors in circular, square, and dual rectangular diaphragms; convoluted square dia­
phragm; and etch stop techniques to control the diaphragm thickness. Diaphragms 
as thin as 2.5 µm have been used to produce capacitive pressure sensors for 300 
mTorr and lower pressure applications [11]. Micromachining can be enhanced by 
using the electronics capability inherent from semiconductor manufacturing. This 
may provide an additional solution for low-pressure measurements.
2.3.2  Silicon-on-Glass (Anodic) Bonding 
Electrostatic or anodic bonding is a process used to attach a silicon top wafer to a 
glass substrate; it is also used to attach silicon to silicon. Anodic bonding attaches 
a silicon wafer, either with or without an oxidized layer, to a borosilicate (Pyrex®) 
glass heated to about 400°C when 500 volts or more are applied across the struc­
ture [4]. The technique creates a silicon on isolator (SOI) structure.
Figure 2.3  Pressure sensor with silicon-to-silicon bonding.

22 
��������������
Micromachining
The silicon is also bonded to a second silicon wafer using anodic bonding. A 
thin (≈ 4 µm) layer of Pyrex® glass is sputtered on one of the layers, and a much 
lower voltage of approximately 50V is applied [5]. Silicon is used instead of glass 
for the support structure, allowing additional wet etching techniques to be per­
formed later in the process.
2.3.3  Silicon Fusion Bonding
A technique that bonds wafers at the atomic level without polymer adhesives, or a 
glass layer, or an electric field, is known as silicon fusion bonding (SFB) or direct 
wafer bonding (DWB). Before bonding, both wafers are treated in a solution, such 
as boiling nitric acid or sulfuric peroxide [12]. This step covers the surface of both 
wafers with a few monolayers of reactive hydroxyl molecules. Initial contact of the 
wafers holds them together through strong surface tension. Subsequent process­
ing at temperatures from 900°C to 1100°C drives off the hydroxyl molecules. The 
remaining oxygen reacts with the silicon to form silicon dioxide and fuses the two 
surfaces together.
Silicon fusion bonding can be used to reduce the size of a micromachined struc­
ture. As shown in Figure 2.4, the anisotropically etched cavity can be much smaller, 
and yet the diaphragm area is identical to a SFB pressure sensor when compared to 
a conventional pressure sensor.  The bottom wafer with the anisotropically etched 
cavity is silicon fusion bonded to a top wafer. After bonding, the top wafer is etched 
back to form a thin diaphragm. The bottom wafer is ground and then polished to 
open the access to the diaphragm. For absolute pressure sensors, such as the units 
in Figure 2.4(a), a support wafer is attached to the structure containing the dia­
phragm produced by any of the previously described methods.
A comparison of the typical process conditions for silicon-to-silicon, anodic 
bonding, and silicon fusion bonding is shown in Table 2.3 [9].
Both direct silicon fusion bonding and silicon on insulator technologies are 
used in the more recent trench etched resonant pressure sensor (TERPS) shown in 
Figure 2.5. The approach extends MEMS resonating pressure transducer (RPT) de­
sign that has existed since the mid-1990’s to pressure ranges beyond 700 Bar while 
addressing media compatibility issues. Using SFB to assemble single crystal silicon 
wafers instead of adhesives, solders, or glass frits provides low thermal and pres­
sure hysteresis. The use of SOI to control the thickness and mass of the resonating 
structure creates a well-defined resonant frequency. Other design considerations 
provide insensitivity to media viscosity and harsh media isolation.
2.3.4  Wafer Bonding for More Complex Structures and Adding ICs
Wafer bonding is being investigated as a means to integrate other materials and to 
combine micromachined structures with microelectronics. Researchers at the Uni­
versity of California, Berkeley, have used an epoxy bond for attaching a sapphire 
wafer with a Gallium-nitride film to a silicon wafer. The sapphire wafer is bonded 
face-down to the silicon wafer. Short, high intensity pulses from a laser are scanned 
back and forth across the sapphire wafer, which separates the GaN from the sap­
phire. The GaN that remains attached to the silicon wafer does not have irregulari­
ties in the film [14].

2.3  Wafer Bonding 
23
Sandia National Laboratories has grown a GaN film on a nonstandard <111> 
silicon wafer. A hydrogen implant on the <111> wafer causes small bubbles to 
form when the wafer is attached to a traditional (high volume) <100> wafer us­
ing silicon-to-silicon bonding. When the wafer is heated during bonding, the small

Micromachining
bubbles expand, breaking off a thin <111> layer of silicon. The resulting silicon on 
insulator system has GaN that can also integrate CMOS circuits [14].
2.4  Surface Micromachining
The selective etching of multiple layers of deposited thin films, or surface micro­
machining, allows movable microstructures to be fabricated on silicon wafers [15]. 
With surface micromachining (shown in Figure 2.6), layers of structural material, 
typically polysilicon, and a sacrificial material, such as silicon dioxide, are depos­
ited and patterned. The sacrificial material acts as an intermediate spacer layer 
and is etched away to produce a freestanding structure. Surface micromachining 
technology allows smaller and more complex structures with multiple layers to be 
fabricated on a substrate. However, annealing or special deposition process control 
is required to reduce stresses in the layers that can cause warping. In contrast, bulk 
micromachining is typically stress-free. 
Surface micromachining has been used to manufacture an accelerometer for 
automotive air bag applications.  A three-layer differential capacitor is created by 
alternate layers of polysilicon and PSG (phosphosilicate glass) on a 0.015-inch (0.38 
mm) thick 4-inch (100 mm) wafer [16]. A silicon wafer serves as the substrate for 
the mechanical structure. The trampoline-shaped middle layer is suspended by four 
support arms. This movable structure is the seismic mass for the accelerometer. The

upper and lower polysilicon layers are fixed plates for the differential capacitor. 
The PSG is sacrificially etched by an isotropic etch, such as HF (hydrofluoric acid).
 Because of the small spacing (≈ 2 µm) that is possible with surface microma­
chining, new issues arise that affect both the sensor design and the manufacturing 
process. Squeeze-film damping, stiction, and particle control must be addressed in 
Figure 2.6  Surface micromachining (a) process steps and (b) example of an actual three-layer 
structure.

Micromachining
each new design. The next three sections will describe these areas and some ap­
proaches that are currently being used to deal with them.
2.4.1  Squeeze-Film Damping
The movement of structures separated by only a few microns (µm) can be greatly 
affected by the actual spacing and ambient (gas or vacuum) between the struc­
tures. This impacts the device’s performance. This effect is known as squeeze-film 
damping. Squeeze-film damping can be significant in bulk micromachined capaci­
tive structures where closer spacing is needed to achieve higher capacitance values. 
It is inherent in surface micromachining where spacing is only a few microns. For 
a particular structure, the gas that separates the layers has a viscous damping con­
stant that increases with the inverse cube of the spacing [17]. Incorporating holes 
in a surface micromachined structure allows the damping to be tuned for desired 
characteristics. Holes also provide distributed access for the etchant to reduce etch­
ing time and the possibility of over-etching portions of the structure.
2.4.2  Stiction
Stiction (static friction) is a phenomenon that occurs in surface micromachining 
resulting from capillary (van der Waals) forces generated during the wet etching of 
the sacrificial layers [18]. Under certain fabrication conditions, these microstruc­
tures can collapse and permanently adhere to the underlying substrate. The failure 
is catastrophic and must be prevented in order to achieve high process yield and a 
reliable design. Preventing the top structure from contacting the bottom structure 
requires minimizing the forces acting on the device when the liquid is removed, or 
minimizing the attractive forces between the structures if they come into contact 
with each other. Techniques used to prevent stiction depend on the manufacturer, 
the product design, and the process flow [18]. Many other solutions for stiction are 
being developed.
2.4.3  Particulate Control
One of the design problems that must be solved in working with structures sepa­
rated by only a few microns is avoiding contamination. Wafer level packaging is an 
attractive solution because it provides a low-cost, protective, and safe environment 
for moving parts that require additional electrical testing and assembly processes. 
The package protects the device from microscopic particulates, handling, and pro­
vides an ambient atmosphere for adjusting damping. A hermetically sealed accel­
erometer chip that can be overmolded in a low-cost, conventional epoxy package 
provides an example of one approach to avoiding contamination.
The general concept of a sensing die with moving parts that needs protection 
from the environment is shown in Figure 2.7 [16]. The three polysilicon layers are 
sealed inside of a protective cavity that is formed by the silicon substrate, a bulk 
micromachined top (cover) wafer, and a glass layer that entirely surrounds the 
polysilicon structure. The glass is spaced at a distance from the polysilicon struc­
ture in order to avoid the possibility of mechanical interference.   The glass serves 
not only as the bonding media, but also as the mechanical spacer that provides 

2.4  Surface Micromachining 
27
the elbow room needed for the movable structure. A 0.015-inch silicon wafer is 
used as the top or cover wafer. The glass is applied to the top wafer, which is then 
thermocompression bonded to the bottom wafer that contains the micromachined 
accelerometer structures. The top wafer design provides a hermetic environment, 
physical protection, and access to the bond pads. When bonded, a sealed cavity for 
controlled squeeze film damping is achieved.
Other techniques to minimize particle contamination use a metal can or ce­
ramic packaging. In these cases, the final package provides a hermetic environment 
for the structure. Prior to packaging, attention must be given to other processing 
steps that could allow particles to be trapped in the structure.
2.4.4  Combinations of Surface and Bulk Micromachining
The previous example combines surface and bulk micromachining. Another com­
bination of the two techniques has been reported. An airgap capacitive pressure 
sensor that combines bulk and surface micromachining on a  single wafer has been 
demonstrated [19]. The structure in Figure 2.8 used standard IC processing to create 
negative-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) circuits with an additional 
polysilicon layer to produce a capacitor with a 0.6 µm-thick dielectric. Surface mi­
cromachining allowed a smaller gap to be produced. MOS circuitry on the top of

the wafer was not exposed to the pressure media. The inlet for the pressure source 
and the release for the surface micromachined structure were bulk micromachined 
into the silicon substrate using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) etch. A sensitivity of 
0.93 mV/kPa (6.4 mV/psi) was measured for the 100 × 100 µm capacitive structure. 
The 100 fF (femtofarad = 10-15) capacitor had a resolution of 30 attofarads (10-18).
2.5  Other Micromachining Techniques
The micromachining techniques discussed so far have been wet etching techniques 
that are used primarily for piezoresistive and capacitive sensing for measuring pres­
sure and acceleration.  These are the basic processes used in research that have 
progressed into commercial manufacturing. However, other techniques are being 
developed that will overcome the limitations, extend the types of measurements that 
can be made, or enhance the capabilities of the previously discussed approaches. 
These newer techniques include the LIGA process, several methods of dry etching, 
micromilling, and laser micromachining.
2.5.1  The LIGA Process
One micromachining process for achieving high aspect ratio micromachining 
(HARM) is the LIGA (derived from German terms for lithography, electroform­
ing, and molding) process that combines X-ray lithography, electroforming, and 
micromolding techniques [20]. The LIGA process allows high aspect ratio (height/
width) structures to be fabricated. X-ray patterned photoresist molds are chemi­
cally etched in a metal plate. A polyimide layer that is a few microns thick acts as a 
sacrificial layer. A complementary structure is built up by electrodepositing a metal 
layer, such as nickel. After the final etching process, portions of the microstructure 
remain attached to the substrate and are able to move freely.  Temperatures are un­
der 200°C for the entire process. This process has created tiny 100-µm gears (about 
the diameter of a human hair). Up to a dozen metal gears have been driven by a 
low-level magnetic field powered micromotor. The LIGA process greatly expands 
micromachining capabilities, making possible vertical cantilevers, coils, microopti­
cal devices, microconnectors, and actuators [15]. However, the LIGA process is 
difficult to integrate with electronics and has a high capital investment cost when 
compared to bulk and surface micromachining. Table 2.4 compares other aspects 
of these three micromachining processes [21].
A differential pressure sensor with double-sided overload protection has been 
fabricated with a modified LIGA process [22]. As shown in Figure 2.9, this design 
combines isotropic bulk micromachining for the cavity and flow channels, LIGA 
processing for the electroplated nickel structure (which is 100-µm thick and has a 
gap of 0.80 µm), and sacrificial etching for the polysilicon diaphragm. The high 
aspect ratio metallic stop limits motion and suppresses diaphragm stress, as well as 
facilitating the option of a second signal to verify performance.

2.5  Other Micromachining Techniques 
29
2.5.2  Dry Etching Processes
Plasma etching and reactive ion etching can produce structures that are not possible 
from the wet chemical etching processes. Plasma etching uses an etching gas instead 
of a liquid to chemically etch a structure. Plasma-assisted dry etching is a critical 
technology for manufacturing ultra large-scale integrated circuits [23]. Plasma etch­
ing processes are divided into four classes: sputtering, chemical etching, energetic or 
damage-driven ion etching, and sidewall inhibitor ion-assisted anisotropic etching. 
Figure 2.10, illustrates the different mechanical structures that result from these 
techniques.
Manufacturing control of a plasma etching process addresses etch rate control, 
selectivity control, critical dimension control, profile control, and control of sur­
face quality and uniformity. The control of these parameters allows new structural 
elements to be achieved. Plasma etching was used in the surface micromachined 
sensor in Figure 2.8. SF6 was used to etch low-pressure chemical vapor deposition 
(LPCVD) silicon nitride and polysilicon; CF4 was used to etch borophosphosilicate

glass (BPSG); and CH4 was used to etch BPSG and the nitride. Plasma etching was 
also performed on the aluminum metal [23].
Ion beam milling is a dry etching process that uses an ion beam to remove 
material through a sputtering action. It can be used separately or with plasma etch­
ing. When ion beam milling is combined with plasma etching, it is also known as 
reactive ion etching (RIE).
Today, the most popular approach to achieve a high-rate deep reactive ion 
etching (DRIE) in silicon is the Bosch process, which enables the etching of deep 
structures with vertical walls into silicon wafers with extreme precision and at high 
speed [24]. The high-rate plasma etching process uses a fluorine-based (SF6) chem­
istry to etch the silicon [25]. Then, a fluorocarbon plasma (C4F8) provides sidewall 
passivation. The process alternates between these steps to produce deep vertical 
structures. The resulting cross section is an undulating or scalloped well as shown 
in Figure 2.11(a). Figure 2.11(b) shows the structure that results from this process. 
Note the scalloping is so small that it is imperceptible.
2.5.3  Micromilling
Milling at the microlevel can be performed by using tools that are manufactured by 
using another micromachining process as an alternative to conventional milling. A 
focused ion beam (FIB) micromachining process has been used to precisely remove 
material from M42 cobalt high-speed steel with a Rockwell “C” hardness of 65-
70 [28]. Four-fluted, two-fluted, and two-fluted square micromilling tools were

manufactured with FIB micromachining. The micromilling tools were subsequently 
used to cut narrow (4 µm), intricate trenches in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). 
2.5.4  Lasers in Micromachining
In addition to chemical etching, lasers are used to perform critical trimming and 
thin film cutting in semiconductor and sensor processing.  The flexibility of laser 
programming systems allows their usage in marking, thin-film removal, milling, 
and hole drilling [29]. Lasers also provide noncontact, residue-free machining in 
semiconductor products, including sensors. The precise value of the thin-film resis­
tors in interface circuits is accomplished by interactive laser trimming. Interactive 
laser trimming at the die level for micromachined sensors has been used to manu­
facture high volume, interchangeable, calibrated, and compensated pressure sensors 
since the mid-1980s [30].

Micromachining
Lasers have been used to drill through silicon wafers as thick as 0.070 inch 
(1.78 mm) with hole diameters as small as 0.002 inch (50.8 µm) [29].   For exam­
ple, 0.005-inch (127 µm) holes spaced on 0.010-inch (254 µm) centers have been 
drilled into a 0.015-inch (0.381 mm) thick wafer. The hole diameters and close 
spacing are achieved without causing fracturing or material degradation. Lasers 
can also vaporize the material (ablation) using high power density.
Lasers have also been investigated as a means of extending the bulk microma­
chining process [31]. Figure 2.12 shows that either <110> or <100> wafers can be 
processed using a combination of photolithography, laser melting, and anisotropic 
etching. A deeper and wider etch occurs in the area that has been damaged. The 
grooved shape or microchannel obtained by this process has been used to precisely 
position fibers and spheric lenses in hybrid microoptical devices without requiring 
additional bonding or capturing techniques.
2.6  Combining MEMS with IC Fabrication
While many of the processes used to manufacture a MEMS structure are similar to 
processes used to fabricate integrated circuits, there are significant differences that 
make combining ICs and microstructures a nontrivial task. Table 2.5 shows the 
difference between IC and micromachining processes in five different areas [32]. 
One of the main concerns in integrating circuitry with micromachined structures is 
the effect that the etching and the resulting temperatures can have on other semi­
conductor processes and circuit elements. The combined surface and bulk micro­
machining process shown Figure 2.8 also included NMOS circuitry to process the 
signal for the capacitive sensor. Other examples will be discussed to show the dif­
ferent approaches that are being pursued.

2.6  Combining MEMS with IC Fabrication 
33
The process for an integrated sensor is more complex because it involves the 
joining of unique sensor processes with traditional IC processes. Standard com­
mercial complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) foundries, through 
the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation System (MOSIS) service, provide 
the capability to have CMOS circuitry and post-processing electronic data process­
ing (EDP) maskless etching to yield integrated circuitry and mechanical structures 
on the same silicon wafer [33]. The micromachining is performed after the CMOS 
processing has been completed. This allows for mixed electrical and mechanical 
silicon devices to be developed and even produced in small volumes. With this 
approach, sensing devices can be reduced in both size and cost, and have added 
intelligence for end applications. 
Processing temperatures are a major concern for monolithic integrated sensors. 
With bulk micromachining, the same processing temperature constraints apply to 
both the sensor and control electronics. Using surface micromachining techniques, 
the structures are dielectrically isolated, so that leakage is not a problem at elevated 
temperatures.  The maximum operating temperature, is therefore, limited by the 
control electronics.
Approaches for integration at the component level can be totally monolithic or 
multichip modules with separate die for sensor and the smart interface. 
Die size and process complexity are basic drivers of cost for semiconductor 
processes and for sensors. The smaller the die size, the greater number of die that 
will fit on a particular wafer. The simpler the process, the lower the cost for pro­
cessing and the higher the yield. Combined processes must achieve cost reduction, 
performance advantage(s), and/or improved reliability in order to be competitive 
in the marketplace. One production approach to combining CMOS and MEMS 
structures is the Nasiri-Fabrication Process [34]. This process combines MEMS on 
CMOS to reduce the number of MEMS manufacturing steps. As shown in Figure 
2.13, the process starts with a CMOS wafer and uses proprietary wafer bonding to 
add a MEMS structure and cap wafer, which is the MEMS portion of the sensor. A 
bulk silicon cap provides a hermetic seal for reliable operation reduces sensitivity 
to interference from environmental sounds and vibrations.
Depending on the sensor design, some MEMS devices more readily adapt to 
CMOS processing than others. For example, through a patented technique, Baolab 
Microsystems uses the existing metal layers in a CMOS wafer to form the MEMS 
structure for motion sensors using standard mask techniques [35]. As shown in 
Figure 2.14, the movable MEMS structures are masked-defined using the stan­
dard CMOS metal interconnect layers and vias. Using this design methodology, 
the company has created inertial masses, suspension springs, capacitive sensing 
plates, cantilevers, and switching contacts [36]. Next, the MEMS structure is re­
leased by etching away the Inter Metal Dielectric (IMD) through small openings in

the passivation layer using vHF (vapor HF). The final step seals the holes prior to 
packaging the chip. 
Using standard 0.18-µm, 8-inch CMOS wafers with four or more metal layers, 
Baolab has created MEMS devices with minimum feature sizes down to 200 nano­
meters [36]. The CMOS process provides the signal conditioning, analog-digital 
conversion, and digital signal processing circuitry as well. With features an order 
of magnitude smaller than current conventional MEMS devices, the company calls 
its technology Nano Embedded Mechanical Systems (NanoEMS™) MEMS. Addi­
tional benefits of smaller sizes include lower power consumption and faster devices.
2.7  Other Micromachined Materials
The most common IC materials (Si, SiO2, Al, and Si3N4) have played an important 
role in established micromachining technology. However, improving the perfor­
mance of a sensor for a particular application, addressing a higher operating range, 
or sensing a new parameter can require other materials and sensing techniques. 
Table 2.1 provides a comparison of GaAs, SiC, and diamond to silicon. Silicon be­
gins to exhibit plastic deformation at temperatures above 600°C. Higher operating 
temperatures are among the desirable properties that make these alternate materials 
attractive for both ICs and semiconductor sensors. Other semiconductor materials, 
such as indium phosphide (InP), are also being investigated for micromachined sen­
sors. Additionally, several metals, metal oxides, and polymer films are being used 
in micromachined devices. Four examples demonstrate the variety of approaches 
being pursued. 
2.7.1  Diamond as an Alternate Sensor Material 
Selectively deposited diamond film has been used as the thermal element in a flow 
sensor [37]. The bulk micromachined structure with diamond film is shown in 
Figure 2.15. Processing for the boron-doped heater resistors is performed at tem­
peratures above 1000°C. After surface preparation, the diamond film is grown in

the desired regions by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition in a mixture of 
hydrogen and methane gas and at a substrate temperature of 900°C. The aluminum 
pad contact to the resistors is the next step. Lastly, the back of the wafer is aniso­
tropically etched to form the bridge structure for the flow sensor. Besides higher op­
erating temperatures, diamond’s resistance to corrosive and abrasive environments 
makes it attractive as a flow sensor.
2.7.2  Metal Oxides and Piezoelectric Sensing
In addition to semiconductor materials, various metal oxides can be deposited on 
micromachined structures. A pressure sensor with a zinc oxide (ZnO) piezoelectric 
sensing element has been made in an IC-compatible process [38]. Surface microma­
chining is used to create the cavity. As shown in Figure 2.16, a thermal oxide layer 
(Tox) is grown to isolate the sensor from the silicon substrate. The lower polysilicon

Micromachining
electrode is encapsulated in silicon nitride (Si3N4). The spacer oxide layer is sac­
rificially etched. Polysilicon is used to form an electrically conductive structural 
support and cavity for the sensor. The 0.95 µm-thick active ZnO layer is deposited 
by RF sputtering. In addition to forming the active piezoelectric film, the sputter­
ing also seals the sidewalls of the structure with an O2-Ar mixture at 10 milliTorr 
inside the cavity. The sensor exhibits approximately 0.36 mV/µbar sensitivity at 1.4 
kHz and 3.4 dB variation over the range 200 Hz to 40 kHz. The dimensions of the 
sensor range from 50 × 50 µm2 to 250 × 250 µm2.
Surface micromachining techniques have been applied in a GaAs metal-semi­
conductor field effect transistor (MESFET) process to form both sensors and elec­
tronic circuits [39]. The sensors incorporate 1 µm thick sputtered ZnO capacitor 
supported by a 2-µm aluminum membrane formed on the GaAs substrate. The 
piezoelectric pressure sensor is 80 µm ×80 µm. Circuits using 4-µm GaAs MESFETs 
are fabricated in a planar, direct ion-implanted process. The sensors and circuits 
both operate at temperatures up to 200°C.
2.7.3  Films on Microstructures 
The sensitive layers for chemical sensors can be deposited over a bulk microma­
chined structure. As shown in Figure 2.17, one approach to a semiconductor gas 
sensor uses a thin metal oxide semiconductor deposited over an integrated heat­
ing element [40]. The resistivity of the metal oxide depends upon the reducing or 
oxidizing environment being sensed. The sensitive area is thermally insulated from 
the silicon substrate to minimize power consumption. Response time of the device 
is less than 1 second with an operating temperature range of 250°C to 400°C. The 
structure is contained in a 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm × 0.3 mm chip.
Polymer films are also being deposited on both surface and bulk microma­
chined structures. The films act as a membrane in biosensors. Multiple sites can 
have a variety of films sensitive to different levels of a particular substance or to dif­
ferent substances. These sensors call for a very small sample of material to provide 
an analysis making them ideal for usage on small children or any application where 
only a small sample is available.
Sensors based on biological molecules, such as single-strand (SS) DNA, RNA, 
antibodies, and others also use thin-film techniques. MEMS biosensors and nano­
technology-based detection methods are expected to displace existing technologies 
in many areas of clinical diagnosis.

2.7.4  Micromachining Metal Structures
A micromachining processed called electrochemical fabrication (EFAB) has been 
developed that can build a wide range of three-dimensional structures [41]. The 
process relies on the electroplating of metal and an in situ mask patterning tech­
nique. The EFAB process is shown in Figure 2.18.
The first metal is deposited on a substrate using a conformable insulator pat­
terned on an anode (Figure 2.18(a)) to produce the partial layer of Figure 2.18(b). 
A second metal is blanket deposited over the first (Figure 2.18(c)) and then the 
entire structure is mechanically planarized to a precise thickness and flatness (Fig­
ure 2.18(d)). This process can be repeated for multiple layers. The final structure, 
such as Figure 2.18(e), is then etched to produce a 3-D device (Figure 2.18(f)). The 
sacrificial metal is analogous to the sacrificial material in surface micromachining 
except it is full conductive. Therefore, an arbitrary patterning layer, including one 
with overhanging structures, can be electrodeposited over it. The low process tem­
perature makes it a candidate for additional CMOS circuit integration.

2.7.5  Carbon Nanotube MEMS
Ongoing research using carbon nanotubes (CNT) with MEMS may provide ex­
traordinary capability for sensors in the future. Researchers have already demon­
strated a CNT framework-based approach to high aspect ratio MEMS fabrication 
and reported some significant potential advantages over DRIE and LIGA-based 
techniques [42].
In other research, MEMS devices have sensed nanometer-scale motions by 
sensing the change in resistance in carbon nanotubes instead of using capacitive 
sensing [43]. Researchers expect a sensitivity increase of as much as 100 times with 
the addition of CNTs to a standard silicon fabrication process. CNT technology 
combined with other materials could provide smart materials to significantly ad­
vance sensor designs.
2.8  MEMS Foundry Services and Software Tools
With all the variations in MEMS processing that can occur and ongoing research to 
develop more improvements for niche applications, the use of standard CMOS pro­
cessing to take advantage of the extensive semiconductor infrastructure has been 
a significant goal and force in shaping the MEMS industry. The world’s largest 
semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), of­
fers MEMS processing and has developed a 0.11-micron MEMS-on-CMOS process 
[44].
One of the issues in combining CMOS and MEMS processing is the possibil­
ity of contamination caused by process incompatibilities such as the wet etching 
processes for MEMS structures. Figure 2.19 shows the approach that X-FAB uses 
to avoid contamination [45]. The flow is unidirectional and MEMS processing is 
performed in a dedicated MEMS clean room at the end of the flow.
The use of foundries instead of in-house manufacturing has been one of the 
significant changes that have occurred within the last 10 years for MEMS sensors. 
MEMS companies are following the trend of outsourcing production for semicon­
ductor manufacturing that even the largest semiconductor suppliers have embraced 
to reduce the development costs and frequent process changes necessary to keep up 
to state-of-the art technology [46]. The number of fabless MEMS companies has 
increased in the past few years and is expected to grow for the next 5 years.
In addition to silicon foundries that offer MEMS processing, several pure-play 
foundries strictly cater to the needs of MEMS device makers [47]. Some foundries 
offer several MEMS processes. For example, X-FAB that claims the status of the 
first pure-play MEMS foundry in the world has surface and bulk micromachin­
ing processes as well as CMOS technology. Figure 2.20 shows an example of the 
Figure 2.19  X-FAB’s process isolates contamination possibilities of CMOS and MEMS. (After: [45].)

2.8  MEMS Foundry Services and Software Tools

MEMS processing offered by X-FAB [48].  The surface micromachining process is 
used for making inertial sensors with interdigitated structures. 
As an example of MEMS foundry capability, X-FAB, ranked 13th [47], has 
a dedicated 400 m2 MEMS backend clean room and a 1,200m2 CMOS frontend 
clean room. The MEMS foundry provides a capacity of 2,500 MEMS (6-inch) 
wafer starts per month. X-FAB offers volume manufacturing of bulk and surface 
micromachined technologies, with and without CMOS integration.
The largest MEMS foundry service is provided by STMicroelectronics [49], 
which is also a leading supplier of MEMS sensors for consumer applications. For 
example, Figure 2.21 shows the DRIE structure of ST’s gyroscope used in consum­
er products such as smartphones. In contrast to its sensor business, the company’s 
MEMS foundry sales are based on processing MEMS actuators for inkjet printers. 
In addition to MEMs processing, other companies offer design tools to sim­
plify and expedite the design process, and to provide linkage to the processing 
offered by foundries and between MEMS-specific design software and standard 
electronic design automation (EDA) software such as the MathWorks’ MATLAB

and Cadence tools. These tools have been essential to the transition of MEMS tech­
nology from limited designs in low volume to several high-volume designs offered 
by many MEMS device makers. In addition, these tools are critical to the support 
of consumer applications with extremely short design cycles and the need for first 
pass design success. However, other industries benefit from these capabilities as 
well. Two companies, Coventor and Tanner EDA, exemplify the capability of the 
available MEMS software tool providers.
Coventor has a full suite of software tools for designing integrated MEMS+IC 
devices, including its most recently introduced CoventorWare 2012 [50]. The soft­
ware has two main modules:  Designer and Analyzer. Designer creates the 3D ge­
ometry and builds 3D models, and Analyzer simulates, visualizes, and analyzes 
performance [51]. Starting from the initial layout, this software is used for verifi­
cation and optimization of device designs. It provides analysis of MEMS-specific 
multiphysics aspects, including coupled electro-mechanics, gas damping, anchor 
losses, thermo-elastic damping (TED), and manufacturing-induced stress gradients. 
In addition, the software closely links to design environments from Cadence and 
MathWorks. The company’s SEMulator3D can build 3D models of MEMS struc­
tures and CMOS circuits and can visualize the electrical connectivity between them. 
In addition to analog IC and mixed signal software tools, Tanner EDA offers L-
Edit MEMS and L-Edit MEMS Design for MEMS designers. Both tools are based 
on the company’s L-Edit layout editor tool for analog and mixed signal IC design, 
and offer features and functionality for the unique requirements of MEMS designs 
[52]. Figure 2.22 shows the interactivity and capability of the software tools.
Providing the same capabilities and functionality of the L-Edit MEMS package, 
L-Edit MEMS Design adds design rule checking (DRC) capability to find errors 
prior to manufacturing. Other companies’ software tools can work in conjunction 
with Tanners L-Edit. For example, SoftMEMs MEMS Pro is a CAD tool suite for 
PC platform that covers the entire MEMS design process that can sit on top of L-
Edit [53, 54]. 
2.9  Application Example
The electronic waving torch demonstrated by attendees of the opening ceremonies 
for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing provides a dramatic example of the innovative use

2.9  Application Example

of MEMS technology in an advanced sensor [53]. Resembling the shape of a 20- to 
30-cm wand, the torch had a linear array of LEDs [55]. Waving the torch from side 
to side caused the LEDs to switch on and off, displaying Olympic images for major 
sports, the Olympic logo, Chinese greetings, and the five Olympic mascots in mid-
air. The displayed pattern depended on motion. In addition to the accelerometer 
used to detect the motion, an algorithm provided an essential part of the sensing 
technology.  
Unlike accelerometers commonly used in high-volume consumer and automo­
tive applications, the MEMSIC device in the torch is based on a thermopile heating 
the air in a cavity and detecting the motion of the heated gas molecules. Sensing heat 
transfer by natural convection avoids moving parts associated with other acceler­
ometer designs and simplifies the MEMS portion of the wafer fabrication process. 
Using from 95% to 99% CMOS processing, the MEMS sensor is almost indepen­
dent of the foundry allowing MEMSIC to build the sensor in any CMOS foundry 
and secure the lowest production cost. MEMSIC performs the final proprietary 
processing in its facility. Figure 2.23 shows the unique shape of the accelerometer. 
Standard CMOS layers for the sensor include gate polysilicon for the heater, 
and metal and polysilicon for the first layer of the thermopile [53].�����������
 ����������
Taking ad­
vantage of the most recent industry trends, the accelerometer was designed with 
Tanner EDA tools and fabricated in a TSMC foundry. The MEMS with mixed-
signal circuitry design significantly reduces the cost of the sensor and allows it to 
withstand a theoretical shock limit over 50,000g—over 5X that of traditional ac­
celerometers [57].

The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor 
Output
Since silicon technology has been so successful in the development of sophisticated, 
yet inexpensive, VLSI electronic circuits, it seems an obvious extension to employ 
the same materials and the same fabrication principles to lower the costs of the 
sensors and transducers as well.
—Kurt Petersen, “Silicon as a Mechanical Material,” 1982 [1]
3.1  Introduction
Micromachining technology, combined with semiconductor processing, provides 
the ability to sense mechanical, optical, magnetic, chemical, biological, and other 
phenomena. These MEMS sensors are, in most cases, a considerable improve­
ment over the previous mechanical or other counterparts. However, as stand-alone 
components, they are far from the ideal characteristics that are desired for most 
measurements. In this chapter, the output from piezoresistive, capacitive, and piezo­
electric sensors will be analyzed. Brief consideration will be given for other sensing 
techniques and approaches to directly achieve a digital output from the sensor. The 
actual level of these signals and the various parameters used to specify the sensor’s 
performance will be discussed.
3.2  Sensor Output Characteristics
The sensing technique used for a particular measurement can vary considerably de­
pending on the range of the measurand, accuracy required, environmental consider­
ations that impact packaging and reliability of the sensor, dynamic nature of signal, 
and the effect of other inputs on the measurand. The environmental considerations 
include operating temperature, chemical exposure, and media compatibility. The 
measurement systems also apply constraints. Factors such as signal conditioning, 
signal transmission, data display, operating life, servicing/calibration, impedance 
of sensor, impedance of system, supply voltage, frequency response, and filtering 
may make one solution preferable over another. In some cases, the sensor’s design

The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
can make more than one sensing technology acceptable. This depends on the de­
sign and manufacturing capability of the sensor supplier. For example, ceramic 
and semiconductor sensors using capacitive or piezoresistive technology frequently 
compete for a particular application. Also, optoelectronic, Hall-effect, magnetore­
sistive, and even inductive sensors can measure displacement or velocity. However, 
once a technology has been accepted for a particular measurement, displacement by 
an alternate technology is quite difficult.
Determining the proper sensing technology for a particular application begins 
with understanding the fundamental design principles of the sensor and the speci­
fications that the manufacturer guarantees. Semiconductor sensors have defined 
new terms, and they allow alternative design methodology for sensors based on 
the micrometer and nanometer scale in which they operate. Piezoresistive pressure 
sensor examples will be used to explain some key sensor parameters.
3.2.1  Wheatstone Bridge
The change in the resistance of a material when it is mechanically stressed is called 
piezoresistivity. Strain-gauge pressure sensors convert the change in resistance in 
four (sometimes only one or two) arms of a Wheatstone bridge, as shown in Figure 
3.1(a). The output voltage of a four-element Wheatstone bridge, shown in Figure 
3.1(b), is given by
	
∆
= E R
Eo
R
	
(3.1)
where Eo is the output voltage, E is the applied voltage, R is the resistance of all 
bridge arms, and ∆R is the change in resistance due to an applied pressure [2]. Ad­
ditional variable resistive elements are typically added to adjust the zero-offset, cali­
brate sensitivity, and provide temperature compensation. The Wheatstone bridge 
can be operated in a constant voltage or constant current mode. The constant volt­
age mode is more common because it is easier to generate a controlled voltage

3.2  Sensor Output Characteristics

source. However, the constant current mode is also used, and it provides tempera­
ture compensation that is independent of the supply voltage.
Different approaches to piezoresistive strain gauges range from traditional 
bonded and unbonded to integrated silicon pressure sensors. Pressure applied to 
the diaphragm produces a change in the dimension of the diaphragm, an increase 
in the length of the gauge (l), and a change in its resistance (R = rl/A, where R is 
the resistance of the gauge, r is the resistivity of the material, l is the length of the 
resistive element, and A is the cross-sectional area). The change in length per unit 
length is called a strain. The sensitivity of a strain gauge is indicated by gauge factor 
(GF) which is defined by:
	
∆
= ∆
R R
K
l l 	
(3.2)
where K = π • ε is the gauge factor, π is the piezocoefficient, and ε is the modulus 
of elasticity for the material.
The K for metals is 2; for silicon it is approximately 100 to 200, depending on 
the doping level and the design [3]. In contrast to metals, the change in resistance 
is a secondary effect for silicon. The primary effect is the change in conductivity of 
the semiconductor material due to its dependence on mechanical stress.
The GF for a strain gauge is improved considerably (to about 150) by us­
ing a silicon strain gauge. However, besides the conventional resistive Wheatstone 
bridge, silicon processing techniques and the miniature size of piezoresistive ele­
ments in silicon enable the design of a unique piezoresistive sensor. This alternate 
design demonstrates one of the different possibilities that semiconductor technol­
ogy brings to sensing.
3.2.2  Piezoresistivity in Silicon
The analytic description of the piezoresistive effect in cubic silicon can be reduced 
to two equations that demonstrate the first-order effects [4].

where ∆E1 and ∆E2 are electric field flux density, P0 is the unstressed bulk resistiv­
ity of silicon, I is the excitation current density, π is the piezoresistive coefficients, 
X1 and X2 are axial stress tensors, and X6 is a shear stress tensor due to the applied 
force.
The effect described by (3.3) is utilized in a silicon pressure transducer of the 
Wheatstone bridge type. Regardless of whether the sensor designer chooses N-type 
or P-type layers for the diffused sensing element, the piezoresistive coefficients π11 
and π12 of (3.3) will have opposite signs. This implies that—through careful place­
ment, orientation with respect to the proper crystallographic axis, and a sufficient­
ly large aspect ratio for the resistors themselves—it is possible to fabricate resistors

on the same diaphragm that both increase and decrease (respectively) from their 
nominal values with the application of stress.
The effect described by (3.4) is typically neglected as a parasitic in the design 
of a Wheatstone bridge device. A closer look at this equation reveals that the incre­
mental electrical field flux density, ∆E2, due to the applied stress, X6, is monotoni­
cally increasing for increasing X6. In fact, (3.4) predicts an extremely linear output 
because it depends on only one piezoresistive coefficient and one applied stress. 
Furthermore, the incremental electric field can be measured by a single stress-sensi­
tive element. This is the theoretical basis for the design of the transverse voltage or 
shear stress piezoresistive strain gauge.
Figure 3.2 shows the construction of a device that optimizes the piezoresistive 
effect of (3.4). The diaphragm is anisotropically etched from a silicon substrate. 
The piezoresistive element is a single, four-terminal strain gauge that is located at 
the midpoint of the edge of the square diaphragm at an angle of 45°. The orienta­
tion of 45° and location at the center of the edge of the diaphragm maximizes the 
sensitivity to shear stress (X6) and the shear stress being sensed by the transducer 
by maximizing the piezoresistive coefficient, π44.
Excitation current is passed longitudinally through the resistor (pins 1 and 
3) and the pressure that stresses the diaphragm is applied at a right angle to the 
current flow. The stress establishes a transverse electric field in the resistor that is

3.2  Sensor Output Characteristics

sensed as an output voltage at pins 2 and 4, which are taps located at the midpoint 
of the resistor. The single-element shear stress strain gauge can be viewed as the 
mechanical analog of a Hall-effect device.
Using a single element eliminates the need to closely match the four stress and 
temperature sensitive resistors on the Wheatstone bridge designs, while greatly sim­
plifying the additional circuitry necessary to accomplish calibration and tempera­
ture compensation. The offset does not depend on matched resistors, but on how 
well the transverse voltage taps are aligned. This alignment is accomplished in a 
single photolithography step, making it easy to control. The temperature coeffi­
cient of the offset is small (nominally ±15 µvolts/°C) because multiple resistors and 
temperature coefficients do not have to be matched. By using proper doping levels, 
the temperature dependence of full-scale span (the difference between full-scale 
output and offset) can be carefully controlled and, therefore, compensated without 
the requirement of characterizing each device over the temperature range.
3.2.3  Semiconductor Sensor Definitions 
The batch processing techniques used by semiconductor manufacturers are ideally 
suited for making high-volume, low-cost sensors. One limitation of batch-processed 
parts, however, is that certain parameters are not precisely specified, but only be 
listed as typical on the manufacturer’s data sheet. In many cases, meeting fixed 
limits on all parameters can drive costs up and offset the benefits of high-volume 
batch processing [5].
Use of typical specifications is not necessarily a drawback, however. Unifor­
mity within each wafer lot is a specific strength of semiconductor processing. Nev­
ertheless, this factor must be considered to avoid problems in volume production.
The term typical specification generally has several implications in the semi­
conductor industry. Usually, it indicates a parameter that has been characterized 
during the design phase and represents the mean value for the manufacturing pro­
cess. Certain manufacturers also add that a ±3 sigma value is the total spread that 
users can expect on typical specified parameters. This spread cannot be assumed, 
however, because “typical” implies that limits are not normally attached to the 
manufacturer’s quality assurance program. 
In many cases, typical is used to indicate that the measurement process contrib­
utes more to the inaccuracy of the reading than to the actual variation from unit 
to unit. This practice shows why users must evaluate the parameter specified as 
typical. Pressure hysteresis in silicon diaphragms, for example, is essentially nonex­
istent and should not cause great concern if specified as typical. On the other hand, 
the variation over temperature of span and offset compensation could be signifi­
cant and requires further investigation if listed as a typical specification. 
Many parameters on sensor data sheets are specified as ±% of full-scale (out­
put or span). This designation is the key to understanding other specifications. Full-
scale output is the output at rated pressure and includes the zero-offset. Full-scale 
span is the difference between the output with no pressure applied (offset) and the 
output at rated pressure. 
Sensitivity is the span divided by the operating pressure range. The sensitivities 
for devices made by various manufacturers are frequently compared. The pressure 
ranges and the supply voltage must be considered for an accurate comparison. This

�����������������������������������������
The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
procedure often reveals interesting information that may affect a design decision, 
especially if the linearity at a given sensitivity is also taken into account.
The linearity or deviation from a straight-line relationship is expressed as a 
percent of full- scale output (or span) and is also subject to different test methods. 
The least squares best-fit technique is the commonly accepted choice for establish­
ing linearity. However, it requires several measurement points to provide accept­
able results. 
A simpler measurement is the end-point method, which requires only three 
points: zero, mid-scale, and full-scale. This method lends itself to high-volume test­
ing. Because it always yields a value that is about double the magnitude of a least-
squares method, it is frequently more appropriate for error budget calculations. 
Any comparison of competitive data sheet values for linearity should take into 
account the method used to determine this parameter.
The effect of temperature on offset and span (and sensitivity) is one of the most 
critical and frequently most troublesome aspects of using semiconductor pressure 
sensors. Products that have no temperature compensation can be used with little 
effort for a narrow temperature range, such as 25°C±15°C or less, and accuracy 
requirements of a few percent. Some sensors can be temperature compensated to 
1% to 3% accuracy over a 0°C to 85°C temperature range without exercising the 
sensor over temperature. Ease of compensating for temperature is an important 
factor in evaluating a pressure sensor. 
To accurately compare various products, similar units must be used. Full-
scale value, temperature range, and actual limits (specified as ±% F.S., ±mV, or 
±%F.S./°C) can vary from one manufacturer to another. The conversion of these 
units to mV/°C can provide a good comparison. This type of specification can indi­
cate improved performance over reduced temperature spans. However, a user must 
know actual curve shapes within the temperature compensation window in order 
to have confidence in this value.
Three other terms on sensor data sheets are often a source of confusion: static 
accuracy, ratiometricity, and overpressure. Frequently, manufacturers lump to­
gether linearity, pressure hysteresis, and repeatability as static accuracy. Sometimes 
manufacturers indicate that characteristic, simply as the accuracy—a single param­
eter on the data sheet.
Ratiometricity is one of the new terms that semiconductor manufacturers have 
brought to pressure sensing. Although output is given at a specific voltage rating, 
lower or higher voltage supplies can be used (within the maximum rating of the 
device) with constant voltage source sensors. Ratiometricity error is the change in 
the output that results from a change to the supply voltage and is usually expressed 
as a percent of full-scale output. The output in this instance varies as the ratio of 
source voltage to the manufacturer’s rated voltage. A constant voltage is required 
for proper operation, a fact that should not be overlooked when considering the 
total circuit requirements.
The term overpressure takes on a different meaning with semiconductor pres­
sure sensors. Even though the silicon diaphragm is only 0.001-in. (25.4 µm) thick, 
a device rated at 30 psi can withstand 200 to 300 psi without damage. Most 
manufacturers specify overpressure conservatively at two or three times the rated 
pressure.

3.3  Other Sensing Technologies 
53
Obviously, no damage should occur when the sensor operates within the over­
pressure rating. However, readings made above the normal range are another mat­
ter. Normally, linearity starts to degrade and could fall outside the specified rating 
if the sensor is operated above its rated pressure. If linearity were only marginally 
acceptable to begin with, over-range readings could cause trouble. However, this is 
not the case for many applications.
The normal mindset for making pressure readings with a pressure gauge is to 
avoid operating at full scale for best accuracy. Full-scale operation can also pin the 
gauge needle, resulting in miscalibration or damage. However, operating a semi­
conductor sensor at full-scale usually provides better accuracy than a mid-scale 
reading. This is especially true for units measured for end-point linearity, because 
output is accurately measured to specification at full-scale. Slight excursions over 
the pressure rating do not significantly degrade linearity. However, if the output 
saturates above the rated pressure or the digital gauge’s operating range is exceed­
ed, a higher pressure input will not produce a higher output reading.
3.2.4  Static Versus Dynamic Operation 
The protective gels or coatings that protect the active surface from the pressure 
media degrade response time for semiconductor pressure sensors. Also, isolating the 
semiconductor by stainless steel diaphragms and oil-filled chambers can decrease 
response time. However, response time within 1 ms is typically achieved when the 
sensor is exposed to a full-scale pressure excursion.
Measuring systems that operate at 6,000 rpm require sensors to operate at 
frequencies above 100 Hz. Frequently, higher frequency ranges or higher frequency 
signal components are also of interest, as in acceleration and vibration sensors. 
However, lower frequency sensors tend to have lower noise floors. The lower noise 
floor increases the sensor’s dynamic range and may be more important to the ap­
plication than higher frequency capability [6].
3.3  Other Sensing Technologies
Piezoresistive sensing is the most common technique for micromachined pressures 
sensors because its output signal is predictable and easy to condition. Other tech­
niques are frequently used for other sensors, such as accelerometers, and especially 
for smart sensors for a variety of measurements based on the capability of electron­
ics circuitry to handle the signal conditioning. A brief review focusing on the output 
of current semiconductor sensing techniques follows.
3.3.1  Capacitive Sensing 
Capacitive sensors typically have one plate that is fixed and one that moves as a 
result of the applied measurand. The nominal capacitance is C = Ae/d, where A is 
the area of the plate, e is the dielectric constant, and d is the distance between the 
plates. Two common capacitive pressure sensors used in automotive applications 
are based on silicon and ceramic capacitors. A capacitor structure can also be used 
for measuring acceleration. Figure 3.3 shows a MEMS accelerometer based on a 

54 
�����������������������������������������
The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
micromachined sense element wing that is a flat plate of nickel supported above a 
substrate surface by two torsion bars attached to a central pedestal [7].
Silicon technology combined with surface micromachining has also allowed 
the capacitance between interdigitated fingers to measure acceleration and other 
inputs. The value of the nominal capacitance is in the range of 100 fF to 1 pF and 
the variation in capacitance is in femtofarads. Circuitry either integrated on the 
same silicon chip or in the same package (that takes into account the parasitic ca­
pacitance effect of packaging) can use this level of signal to provide a useful output 
for a control system [8].
3.3.2  Piezoelectric Sensing
A piezoelectric sensor produces a change in electrical charge when a force is applied 
across the face of a crystal, ceramic, or piezoelectric film. The inherent ability to 
sense vibration and the necessity for high impedance circuitry are taken into ac­
count in the design of modern piezo-crystal sensors. Transducers are constructed 
with rigid multiple plates and a cultured-quartz sensing element that contains an 
integral accelerometer to minimize vibration sensitivity and suppress resonances.  
Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic is used to construct biomorph transduc­
ers that sense motion, vibration, or acceleration and that can be activated by an 
applied voltage. The biomorph consists of two layers of different PZT formulations 
that are bonded together in rectangular strips or washer shapes. The rectangular 
shape can be mounted as a cantilever. Motion perpendicular to the surface gener­
ates a voltage [9].
Piezo film sensors that produce an output voltage when they are deflected pro­
vide a method for inexpensive measurements. Figure 3.4(a) shows the construction 
of a piezoelectric film sensing element [10]. The polymer film generates a charge 
when it is deformed and also exhibits mechanical motion when a charge is applied 
to it. For a vehicle detector, the sensor is mounted in an aluminum channel that 
is filled with polyurethane and embedded into the pavement. The output of this 
sensor for three different types of vehicles is shown in Figure 3.4(b). In the voltage 
mode, both the weight and the speed of the vehicle passing over it influence the 
voltage. A positive output occurs when the tire compresses the film. The negative 
output results from expansion after the tire has passed over the sensor.

tesy of Silicon Designs, Inc. [7].)

3.3  Other Sensing Technologies 
55
Surface micromachining techniques have been combined with piezoelectric 
thin film materials, such as zinc oxide, to produce a semiconductor piezoelectric 
pressure sensor. One design has a sensitivity of 0.36 mV/µbar at 1.4 kHz [11]. Low-
level acoustic measurements are a potential application for this technology. The 
ability of piezoelectric sensors to operate without a supply voltage for the sensing 
element makes them attractive in many applications.
3.3.3  The Hall-Effect
Hall-effect technology is frequently used for measuring position and rotation, es­
pecially in automotive applications such throttle position and brake pedal posi­
tion sensors. A vertical Hall-effect structure has been designed for the detection of 
magnetic fields oriented parallel to the plane of the chip. Bulk micromachining has 
been used to achieve higher sensitivity than a device without micromachining. The 
micromachined unit had an output of 70 mV for an applied magnetic field of 400 
mTesla that was almost five times the sensitivity of the unetched unit [12]. More 
recently, three axis Hall-effect sensors have been fabricated using MEMS technol­
ogy as well. The widespread use of Hall-effect sensors suggests that increased in­
novation could be accepted in many cost-sensitive applications that require small 
but accurate position and rotation measurements.

eral sensing approaches, including:

••
Calorimetric sensors;

A chemical sensor may contain a physical sensor that measures temperature, 
pressure, flow, light intensity, acceleration, motion, or other parameters [13]. In 
addition, it usually includes chemically a selective membrane, film, or layer. Figure 
3.5 shows the time domain results of a MEMS chemical gas sensor that uses a 
polymer-based array. The polymer material was deposited into bulk-etched wells 
of a silicon substrate [14]. Research continues in many educational institutions to 
develop smaller, cheaper, and even disposable MEMS-based chemical sensors. 
3.3.5  Improving Sensor Characteristics
The low-level output of the sensors described in this section and the design parame­
ters discussed in Section 3.2.3 are among the characteristics that must be considered 
in order to use a semiconductor sensor in a particular application. Table 3.1 shows 
a summary of sensor characteristics and the design area that is commonly used to

ent concentrations of methanol. (Courtesy of University of California, Los Angeles.)

improve these characteristics [15]. Improved sensor performance can result when 
the design of the sensor and the capability of subsequent components that achieve a 
smart sensor are taken into account in the overall design of the smart sensor. Digital 
logic provided by an MCU, DSP, or other digital circuitry plays a vital role in smart 
sensing and in improving the sensor’s performance.
3.4  Digital Output Sensors 
A sensor that directly interfaces to an MCU without requiring A/D conversion 
simplifies system design and reduces the cost of the MCU. Many of today’s sensors 
accomplish this with additional circuitry. However, the industry’s quest is to create 
a sensor or sensor family with an inherent digital output. On-chip or external signal 
conditioning may achieve inherent capability, but they must be considerably lower 
cost and more accurate than units using existing techniques.
3.4.1  Incremental Optical Encoders
Structures that contain a light source and photodetector provide a digital means of 
measuring displacement or velocity when an alternating opaque and translucent 
grid is passed between them. As shown in Figure 3.6, a macro-sized example of 
uniformly spaced apertures on a wheel allows logic circuitry to count the number of 
pulses in a given time frame in order to determine shaft velocity or angular displace­
ment [16]. Linear measurements of displacement and velocity are also possible. 
Basic presence sensing can be accomplished through the use of a single optical 
channel (or emitter-detector pair). Speed and incremental position sensing must use 
two channels. The most commonly used approach is quadrature sensing, where the 
relative positions of the output signals from two optical channels are compared. 
This comparison provides the direction information, and either of the individual

The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
channels gives the transition signal to derive either count or speed information. A 
typical application may use the direction output as the up/down input and either 
channel A or B as the count input for a common up/down counter. The counter in 
an incremental system will increment or decrement as required in order to maintain 
a relative position or count output. 
Quadrature direction sensing requires that the two optical channels create elec­
trical transition signals that are out of phase with each other by 90° nominally. 
When the code wheel is spinning, the two electrical output signals, A and B, will 
be 90° out of phase, because the wheel windows are 90° out of phase with the 
two sensor channels. The interpretation of whether signal A leading B is clockwise 
or counterclockwise is a matter of choice. Figure 3.7 shows the ideal quadrature 
outputs. The two waveforms are in four equal quadrants, exactly 90° out of phase 
with each other. The detector is on when light is present and turns off when the 
web blocks the beam.

3.4.2  Digital Techniques
A study of available digital techniques has been reported [15]. Sensing techniques 
based on a resonant structure, or a periodical geometric structure, are potentially 
the most direct approach to digital sensing. However, other techniques can be used 
as well.
Micromachined silicon can act as a resonant structure if it is designed with a 
membrane or tuning fork. Electric activation is achieved by using a piezoelectric 
film, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) on the micromachined structure. Most resonant 
structures are implemented in pairs. One element is not interfaced to the input and 
acts as a reference. Comparison of the output frequency of the sensing element to 
the reference element reduces the influence of unwanted parameters. This tech­
nique is commonly used in chemical sensors using surface acoustical wave (SAW) 
delay line oscillators.
Other approaches for digital output sensors include electrical oscillator-based 
(EOB) sensors and stochastic analog-to-digital (SAD) converters [15]. An EOB sen­
sor is designed to generate a periodic current or voltage signal when it is subjected 
to a measurand. Current-to-frequency or voltage-to-frequency conversion provides 
a digital signal. The current-to-frequency technique has been demonstrated on a 
piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor. The frequency changed from 200 to 230 kHz 
with a pressure change from 0 to 750 mmHg. 
A different approach for an EOB sensor was used with a capacitive sensor. Two 
equal but opposite current sources applied a square wave to a capacitive silicon 
pressure sensor. The zero pressure frequency was 155 kHz, and the sensitivity was 
25-kHz/450 mmHg for this design.
A ring oscillator has also been used for EOB sensors. An odd number of 
integrated-injected logic (I2L) gates connected in a ring on a piezoresistive pres­
sure sensor provided the ring oscillator. Sensitivities of up to 10.6 kHz/bar were 
obtained with a ring oscillator frequency of 667 kHz.
SAD converters employ the noise in flip-flop circuits to generate a random 
signal and use the flip-flop as a comparator. A piezoresistive sensor element in the 
flip-flop circuit is one way to implement this approach for a sensor. The number of 
ones and zeros is a direct measure of the strain in a pressure sensor and a simple 
counting procedure for an MCU. A flip-flop sensor that can measure stresses as 
small as 8 kPa in a silicon cantilever beam has been reported.
A final digital example is provided by arrays of sensing elements [17]. A pres­
sure switch with four switch points was fabricated using silicon fusion bonding. 
Pressure-switch points of 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1 atmosphere were designed using con­
trolled thinning of the diaphragm. The switches close electrical contacts when their 
desired pressure threshold is exceeded. Table 3.2 shows the truth table for the 
design. The outputs can be directly applied to a logic control.
3.5  Noise/Interference Aspects 
The general model for a transducer (shown previously in Figure 1.2) indicated 
the interference sources that affect the low-level output of the sensor. An actual 
sensor signal, combined with noise and interference from other sources (such as 

60 
�����������������������������������������
The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
temperature, humidity, and/or vibration) can be a major problem when dynamic 
signals are measured. Dynamic measurements pose a greater challenge than static 
signals where filtering can be used to minimize noise [18].
Piezoresistive pressure sensors have two dominant types of noise [19]. Shot 
noise is the result of a nonuniform flow of carriers across a junction and is inde­
pendent of temperature. Shot noise increases in sensors with increased levels of in­
tegration. The second type of noise, flicker noise, or 1/f, results from crystal defects 
and wafer processing. Flicker noise is proportional to the inverse of frequency and 
is more dominant at lower frequencies. Decoupling and filtering can reduce these 
types of noise. Thermal or Johnson noise produced by thermal agitation of elec­
tronics in conductors and semiconductors is usually small in those devices.
3.6  Low Power, Low Voltage Sensors
Portable sensing applications, including portable data loggers and data acquisition 
systems, require sensors to operate at low power levels and low battery supply 
voltages. For low-power pressure measurements, high impedance pressure sensors 
and pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques have been developed to reduce 
power drain. Depending on the type of measurement (static or dynamic) and how 
frequently it must be measured, the sensing system can be in a sleep mode and can 
wake up to make periodic readings that can be transmitted to distant recording 
instruments. This technique is useful in process controls, hazardous material moni­
toring systems, and a variety of data acquisition applications that would previously 
have been more time-consuming, dangerous, prohibitively expensive, or too heavy 
with previous technology. 
Monitoring pressure is one of the more frequent measurements that must be 
made in systems ranging from tire pressure on vehicles to leakage monitoring in 
tanks, blood pressure in portable healthcare monitors, and barometric pressure in 
weather sondes. The combination of higher impedance sensors with new design 
approaches, such as PWM input and other power management techniques, is in­
creasing the applications in this area of portable equipment.
Consumer electronic applications for accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure, vi­
sion, and other sensing technologies have driven the demand for low power sens­
ing to even lower requirements. While the use of sensors provides numerous new 
features to products like smart phones, the added power consumption also detracts 
from the useful life of a battery charge cycle. The need for lower power will drive 
more innovation at both the device and system level.

3.7  Analysis of Sensitivity Improvement 
61
3.6.1  Impedance
Many mechanical transducers have a low impedance. Strain gauges, for example, 
are typically 350 Ω. This impedance has been achieved in semiconductor devices, 
especially where the direct replacement of a mechanical unit is required. In semi­
conductor circuits, low impedance is desired for noise purposes. However, high 
impedance is required to minimize the current draw for portable applications, to 
use existing interface circuits, and to prevent loading on amplification stages [20]. 
For high impedance pressure sensors, input impedance in the range of approxi­
mately 5 kΩ is common. Output impedance for these devices is also approximately 
5 kΩ. The sensor must be designed to achieve the results that the particular system 
requires.
3.7  Analysis of Sensitivity Improvement
Low-pressure measurements (< 0.25kPa (1-in.) or 0.036 psi) provide a good ex­
ample of the problems that can occur and the solutions that have been developed to 
cope with the low-level signal. Low-pressure measurements are limited by existing 
silicon sensor designs. The sensitivity (and maximum stress) of a silicon diaphragm 
is directly related to the area, and is inversely related to the square of the thick­
ness of the diaphragm. Three different approaches have been pursued to improve 
sensitivity.
3.7.1  Thin Diaphragm
One approach for increasing the sensitivity for low-pressure measurements is thin­
ning the diaphragm. Typical thickness for silicon diaphragms ranges from 2 to 
12 µm. However, a thin diaphragm can have unacceptable linearity. A number of 
researchers have investigated a variety of stress concentrators, or bosses, that have 
been designed into the diaphragm structure in order to minimize the nonlinearity. 
The bosses provide a locally stiffer structure and limit the overall deflection of the 
diaphragm. A thinner diaphragm (4 µm), shallow resistor geometries in the submi­
cron area, and advanced silicon micromachining have been used in a piezoresistive 
sensor to achieve a sensitivity of 50-mV/V/psi (7.3 mV/V/kPa) [21].
3.7.2  Increase Diaphragm Area
A second approach to low sensitivity involves increasing the sensitivity by increas­
ing the size of the diaphragm. An area increase of over 2.5 times results in a 0.5-psi 
sensor with 7-mV/V/psi [22]. This larger area does not compromise ruggedness, but 
it does increase the cost of the sensor.
3.7.3  Improve Topology 
Low pressure measurements continue to pose problems for both system and sensor 
designers. A recently developed unique topology brings several benefits to the user 
[23]. While the exact processing of the piezoresistive elements is seldom disclosed, 

62 
�����������������������������������������
The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
for this sensor, the topology is a visual difference clearly seen in Figure 3.8. This 
design focuses the input from a pressure source into the piezoresistors with mini­
mal loss providing a more efficient pressure transducing system. A more efficient 
transducing system yields higher sensitivities for available die surface area. A 60% 
die size reduction with a 50% sensitivity increase is cited compared to previous gen­
eration devices. Instead of the boss structure commonly used today in low-pressure 
MEMS sensors, the new design uses a bossless structure. Avoiding the boss struc­
ture significantly reduces position sensitivity by 90% over the previous generation. 
This offers an improvement in portable or other applications where vibration can 
impact the pressure sensor measurement. The topology also has improved front-to-
back linearity that provides greater differential performance.
3.8  Application Example
Fuel cells have the potential to change the energy source for many applications in 
the 21st century. In direct fuel cells that produce electricity using air and fuels, such 
as aqueous solutions of methanol, ethanol, or formic acid, a problem called mem­
brane crossover has restricted their use [24]. Membrane crossover occurs when the 
fuel-to-water concentration is excessive, allowing fuel to pass through the mem­
brane to the other side of the fuel cell. Both high fuel and water concentration lower

performance, and high fuel concentration can damage the membrane. A rugged 
fuel-to-water concentration sensor can prevent this problem from occurring. 
Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc. (ISSYS) developed a MEMS-based concentra­
tion sensor to meet the requirements of this application. The sensor uses a micro­
tube and a thin film resistor to provide fluid density and temperature output; these 
allow the methanol concentration to be determined. The tube is driven electrostati­
cally and its vibration is sensed using a capacitive technique. The relative size of 
the sensing structures is shown in Figure 3.9, with the density output compared

pare favorably to a fingertip pattern. The sensitivity (b) of the density technique over the measure­
ment range of the direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC) has advantages compared to refractive index 
and ultrasonic alternatives. (Courtesy of Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc.; ISSYS.)

The Nature of Semiconductor Sensor Output
to alternative sensing methods. The density approach has a greater sensitivity to 
changes in concentration than the refractive index, a higher (but nonlinear) sensi­
tivity to concentrations above 40%, and a flat portion and reversed slope at lower 
concentration levels. This indicates that the density measurement using MEMS 
technology provides an improved solution for a fuel cell concentration sensor. 
3.9  Summary
This chapter has shown the distinct advantages that semiconductor sensors have 
over mechanical predecessors and several variations that have been developed. 
However, these sensors require additional effort to obtain their full benefits in sys­
tems. Semiconductor sensors draw from previous mechanical sensors, but the phys­
ics of the micro-scale can provide alternative solutions that are not possible at the 
macro level.

Getting Sensor Information Into the 
Microcontroller
A useful transducer must be trimmed for zero and gain, and compensated for tem­
perature sensitivity. 
—Jim Williams, Linear Technology (1990) [1]
4.1  Introduction
The sensor signal is only the first step towards a sensor that will ultimately provide 
a usable input to a control system. Signal conditioning the output from the sensor is 
as important as choosing the proper sensing technology. Most transducer elements 
require amplification in addition to offset and full-scale output calibration and 
compensation for secondary parameters, such as temperature. Whether this signal 
conditioning is performed as an integral part of the purchased sensor or by the user, 
the accuracy of the measurement will ultimately be determined by the combina­
tion of the sensor’s characteristics and the additional circuitry. The required signal 
conditioning circuitry is a function of the sensor itself, and will vary considerably 
depending on whether the sensor is capacitive, piezoresistive, piezoelectric, or an­
other technology.
Once a high-level analog signal is available, it must be converted to a digital 
format for use in a digital control system. The A/D converter (ADC) can be an in­
tegral part of the digital controller, the sensor itself, or an intermediate standalone 
unit. Different approaches are used for ADCs; the theoretical accuracy, indicated 
by the number of bits or resolution, is strictly an upper limit to actual accuracy that 
can be achieved in the application. 
This chapter addresses signal conditioning and A/D conversion for sensors. Ex­
amples will be shown of available ICs that have been designed to simplify the task 
of signal conditioning a broad range of sensors, as well as sensors with integrated 
signal conditioning. It concludes with an online tool to simplify the design of a 
variety of sensor interface circuits.

4.2  Amplification and Signal Conditioning
The micromachining used to manufacture a diaphragm or beam thickness and a 
sensing technique to nominal targets. Microelectronics provide the precision for 
semiconductor sensors. When accuracy is combined with ease of interface, cost, 
power consumption, printed circuit board space, and power supply voltage, it is 
often among the considerations when selecting a signal conditioning IC. The semi­
conductor technologies used for the modular amplifiers and integrated circuits in 
this section have a major impact on these criteria.
Sensor signal conditioning circuits are based on two fundamental technolo­
gies: bipolar and CMOS. However, these two technologies have a vast number 
of derivatives. The requirements of the application should be used to determine 
which technology or derivative is appropriate. A performance comparison between 
bipolar and CMOS for signal conditioning circuits is shown in Table 4.1 [2]. This 
comparison was performed in the early 1990’s. Process technology improvements 
in continuously and rapidly shrinking CMOS processes have changed some of 
these parameters in favor of CMOS—especially for the more advanced processes. 
At any point in time, the two technologies can be combined to obtain BiCMOS 
and the best features of bipolar and CMOS at the expense of a more complex 
process—going from a 10 mask bipolar process to one requiring 14/15 mask steps. 
The BiCMOS process has lower yields because of the added processing complexity; 
applications must therefore utilize the performance improvements that it provides. 
While a variety of voltage is commonly used for microcontrollers (MCUs), 
digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal controllers (DSCs), and field-pro­
grammable gate arrays (FPGAs), signal conditioned sensors typically deliver a 5V 
or 3.3V analog output. Consequently, a common signal conditioned output is 0.25 
to 4.75V. Other standard industrial outputs for sensors are 1 to 6V, 1 to 5V, and 0 
to 6V. The supply voltage for these units can range from 7 to 30V. Data acquisition 
systems typically use ±15V, ±12V, and ±15V supplies.
Signal conditioners for sensor outputs range from basic low-gain dc amplifiers 
to specialized amplifiers, such as phase-sensitive demodulators [3]. Linear, loga­
rithmic, high-gain, or dc-bridge amplifiers all fall within the following categories:

differential amplifier, ac-coupled amplifier, chopper-stabilized amplifier, carrier 
amplifier, dc-bridge amplifier, and ac-level amplifier. A number of specialized am­
plifiers are also used for sensors; these include log-linear amplifiers, frequency-
to-voltage converters, integrator amplifiers, and differentiator amplifiers. These 
packaged solutions take the low-level output from sensors and add computational 
processes to free the digital controller from performing time-consuming functions. 
Some amplifiers work with either ac or dc excitation, and others are designed spe­
cifically for ac or dc operation.
In any sensor amplifier circuit, circulating currents in the ground path between 
a sensor and the measurement point can generate a common-mode voltage. The 
voltage appears simultaneously and in-phase at both of the differential amplifier’s 
input terminals. This voltage can either produce an error in the measurement or a 
catastrophic failure. The common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) expressed in dB 
is a measure of an amplifier’s ability to avoid this problem. A differential amplifier 
rejects common-mode voltage and amplifies only the difference across its input 
terminals.
4.2.1  Instrumentation Amplifiers
Several ICs have been designed to provide amplification for applications, includ­
ing sensors. Instrumentation amplifiers are used to obtain a differential-to-single 
end conversion and to amplify the low-level signal from a sensor. Ratiometricity, 
or an output that varies linearly with the supply voltage, is an important consider­
ation for sensors and signal conditioning circuitry used to amplify their output. The 
impedance of the sensor, temperature range, and desired measurement accuracy 
are important factors in deciding the type of signal conditioning circuitry that is 
required.
The instrumentation amplifier’s dedicated differential-input gain block differ­
entiates it from a traditional operational amplifier (op amp). Although the signal 
level for the sensor may be only a few millivolts, it may be superimposed on a com­
mon-mode signal of several volts. A high common-mode rejection ratio keeps the 
common-mode voltage fluctuations from causing errors in the output [4].  A simple 
circuit using a standard instrumentation amplifier with a gain of 10,100, a CMRR 
of 100 dB, and a bandwidth of 33 kHz is shown in Figure 4.1 [1]. The pressure 
sensor has passive calibration for zero offset, a full-scale span, and a temperature 
compensation, but no additional amplification. The bridge current in the circuit is 
less than 3.6 mA with a 9V supply, and the output can be directly interfaced to an 
A/D converter of an MCU or DSP.
Another circuit that demonstrates the amplification and calibration for a resis­
tive bridge sensor is shown in Figure 4.2 [5]. The bridge and amplifier connect to 
an external voltage source supplied from VDD and an external reference voltage 
(VREF). The supply voltage can range from 1.8 to 5.5V, with a typical supply cur­
rent of only 800 µA. The amplifier’s gain is set by two external resistors minimiz­
ing gain error and drift-over temperature. The overall gain is set at 201 V/V. The 
design has a CMRR of 115 typical at a minimum gain of 100 and a bandwidth of 
500 kHz.

4.2.2  Sleep-Mode Circuitry for Reducing Power 
Integrated circuits designed to optimize performance are providing new solutions 
for smart sensors. For example, in battery-powered applications, the current drain 
and power consumption must be low in order to obtain optimum battery life. 
Because sensor readings are made periodically in many applications at regularly 
scheduled intervals, operational amplifiers and interface circuits frequently incor­
porate a sleep mode. This circuitry allows an external MCU or other digital control 
circuit to implement a lower current mode that substantially reduces the current 
consumption of the amplifier or interface circuit.
The BiCMOS-processed IC in Figure 4.3 implements a sleep-mode control 
through an active-low SLEEP input [6]. The MAX9621 is a dual, two-wire Hall-
effect sensor interface that has analog and digital outputs. Pulling the IC’s SLEEP 
pin low for more than 40 Fs puts the device into sleep mode for power saving. In 
sleep mode, the two digital outputs (DOUT1 and DOUT2) are high-impedance 
and are pulled high by pull-up resistors. The two analog outputs (AOUT1 and 
AOUT2) are set to zero-output current. In the sleep mode, the IC typically draws 
1 µA (10 µA max) instead of normal operating mode current of 1 mA maximum. 
This reduced current consumption can considerably extend the battery life of por­
table applications.

4.2.3  Rail to Rail Operational Amplifiers 
Battery-powered circuits require system operation at progressively lower voltages. 
This dictates that output signals should be as close as possible to the limits of the 
high and low voltage rails of the power supply. An operational amplifier, such as

Getting Sensor Information Into the Microcontroller
Texas Instrument’s OPA835, that is fabricated using a silicon germanium (SiGe) 
complimentary bipolar process achieves several desirable systems capabilities, in­
cluding a CMMR of 113 dB and rail-to-rail output (RRO) that allows it to operate 
within 0.25V of the supply high and low voltages [7]. It operates with a supply 
voltage from 2.5 to 5.5V, and its performance is specified at 2.7 and 5.0V. With a 
5V supply, the RRO has a typical low output value of 0.15V (0.2V max) and a high 
voltage value of 4.8 typical (4.75V max). With a 2.7V supply, the RRO has a typi­
cal low output value of 0.15V (0.2V max) and a high voltage value of 2.5 typical 
(2.45V max). Both supply voltages operation are over the entire temperature range 
of –40°C to 125°C.
In general, the effect of rail-to-rail operation is shown in Figure 4.4 [8]. For 
the amplifier to contribute no additional error to the ADC, the amplifier’s signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) should be better than the theoretical best-case dynamic range 
of the ADC. Depending on the amount of noise that is present, the combination of 
the drive amplifier and ADC will determine the effective number of bits of resolu­
tion. The A/D dynamic range is the full-scale value (high reference minus the A/D 
low reference). The normal output from the sensor must be inside the A/D dynamic 
range to ensure proper operating headroom.
4.2.4  Switched-Capacitor Amplifier
CMOS is preferred for signal conditioning sensors with capacitive output because 
of the high input impedance of CMOS. Another advantage of CMOS is low power 
supply current requirements. Switched-capacitor techniques using CMOS circuitry 
have been developed to detect changes as small as 0.5 fF. A switched capacitor 
filter is an analog sampled-data circuit. The components of a basic circuit are an 
operational amplifier, a capacitor, and an analog switch, all driven by a clock [9]. 
The filter’s performance is determined by the ratio of the capacitor values and not 
the absolute values. Switching the capacitor makes it behave as a resistor with an

effective resistance proportional to the switching frequency. Figure 4.5 shows a 
switched-capacitor filter that has been developed for a surface micromachined ac­
celerometer with differential capacitive sensing [10]. This type of circuit minimizes 
the effects of parasitic capacitance and has a very high input impedance for minimal 
signal loading.
4.2.5  Barometer Application Circuit
Sensor applications that use only a limited portion of the available output from a 
sensor can provide interesting challenges to sensor manufacturers and circuit de­
signers. Barometric measurements, for example, use only a pressure variation of a 
few inches of mercury. In addition, this variation is superimposed on the altitude 
pressure reading that can vary from 29.92 inches of mercury at sea level to 16.86 
inches of mercury at 15,000 feet. A circuit that interfaces a temperature compen­
sated and calibrated 100-kPa (29.92 inches of mercury) absolute pressure sensor to 
a microcontroller has been designed [11]. The circuit has a gain of 187 and obtains 
0.1-inch Hg resolution when it is interfaced to an 8-bit MCU with an integral ADC.
4.2.6  4- to 20-mA Signal Transmitter
The use of monolithic two-wire transmitters can provide a low cost easy-to-inter­
face signal conditioning solution for 4 to 20 mA current loops to transmit sensor 
readings in many industrial applications. The current loop avoids the problems of 
voltage drop when transmitting an analog signal over a long distance, and the sup­
ply voltage that can range from 9–40V. The circuitry in these devices can also com­
pensate for nonlinearity in a resistance temperature detector (RTD) or resistance 
bridge sensor, and can therefore improve the overall performance of the sensor-sig­
nal conditioning combination.  Furthermore, the availability of additional features, 
such as a precision current source or a 5V-shunt regulator, can simplify the task of 
the circuit designer and allow use of these ICs for several types of sensors.

Getting Sensor Information Into the Microcontroller
Figure 4.6 shows Melexis’ MLX90323 sensor interface IC with a 4- to 20-
mA current loop output [12]. The IC provides microprocessor-controlled signal 
conditioning for bridge or differential configuration sensors. Compensation values 
for gain adjustment, offset control, high order temperature, and nonlinearity are 
stored in electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) and 
are reprogrammable. An additional interface circuit enables programming from a 
PC. With no signal from the sensor, the output of the IC is 4 mA; with a full signal, 
it is 20 mA.
4.2.7  Schmitt Trigger
One final circuit to be considered is the Schmitt trigger. A Schmitt trigger turns the 
pulsed output from a sensor, such as an opto-detector or phototransistor, into a 
pure digital signal. Figure 4.7 shows the opto-input and output of the Schmitt trig­
ger [13]. The lower and upper thresholds in the trigger remove the linear transition 
region between the on and off states. This hysteresis filters electrical noise that can

cause the output to change its state when it is close to the threshold of a digital IC 
input. The output of the Schmitt trigger can be used directly by digital logic circuits.
4.3  Separate Versus Integrated Signal Conditioning
A worldwide effort to integrate various sensors with electronics has been occur­
ring for many years because of the potential advantages. These advantages include 
improved sensitivity, differential amplification for canceling parasitic effects (such 
as temperature and pressure), temperature compensation circuits, multiplexing cir­
cuits, and A/D converting circuits [14], as well as memory to provide on board pro­
grammability. This combination does not inherently offer lower cost or improved 
performance. However, selection of the proper sensor, application (especially high 
volume), and design criteria can provide a sensor that is lower cost and more reli­
able than a thick-film, multichip version and is far more flexible in a variety of 
applications.  
Semiconductor sensors are subject, just as are other semiconductor devices, to 
the paradox that (1) increased integration is inevitable with semiconductor tech­
nology for performance and cost reduction, and (2) that all devices cannot be in­
tegrated and obtain improved performance or cost reduction. Proper system parti­
tioning is required to avoid components that are difficult to integrate, such as high 
value capacitors, and components that can be obtained more cost-effectively by 
other approaches. Combining the sensor and additional circuitry can be beneficial 
in some applications and undesirable in others. 
4.3.1  Integrated Signal Conditioning
With the right process and sensor design, semiconductor sensing technology al­
lows the integration of both the sensing element(s) and signal conditioning circuitry 
into the same monolithic (silicon) structure. A number of factors determine which 
technology a manufacturer will choose when approaching a new design. A unique 
accelerometer demonstrates how an alternate approach to the sensor simplifies the 
monolithic integration of sensor and signal conditioning and processing circuitry.
Instead of using traditional capacitive or piezoresistive technology to measure 
the movement of a micromechanical mass structure, engineers at MEMSIC de­
veloped an accelerometer based on patented thermal technology [15]. The sens­
ing elements measure internal changes in heat transfer caused by acceleration to 
heated gas molecules. Since the proof mass is gas molecules, this design method­
ology avoids the inherent issues of stiction, hysteresis, mechanical ringing, and 
other issues that are often associated with moving micromechanical structures. The 
simplified structure that avoids etching moving mechanical structures allows the 
integration of both the sensing element(s) and applications-specific integrated cir­
cuits (ASICs) into a single silicon chip using a standard 0.18-µm CMOS process. 
Figure 4.8 shows the block diagram of a dual-axis thermal accelerometer and its 
associated signal conditioning circuitry. In addition to frequently integrated blocks, 
such as low-pass filters, factory-adjusted offset and gain, voltage reference, and 
integrated temperature sensors, the ASIC has a heater control and continuous self-
test functions.

4.3.2  External Signal Conditioning 
For those sensors that do not have signal conditioning either monolithically inte­
grated with the sensor or through package-level integration, several semiconduc­
tor manufacturers offer sensor interface circuits for popular sensing technologies. 
These include resistive bridge, capacitive, thermopile (used in infrared sensing), 
two-electrode chemical sensors, and more. Figure 4.9 shows an example of a sen­
sor signal conditioner IC for resistive bridge sensors [16]. Designed for sensing in 
building automation, industrial, office automation, and white goods applications, 
ZMDI’s RBicLite™ ZSC31010 is a low-cost sensor signal conditioner IC. The 
CMOS-processed IC contains both analog and digital circuitry. Analog circuitry in­
cludes temperature reference, VDD regulator, preamp, A/D converter (ADC), input 
multiplex (INMUX), and a power-on rest (POR) oscillator. In addition to a rail-to-
rail ratiometric analog output, the IC has a One-Wire Serial Interface (also called 
the ZACwire™ Interface) for communication. Accepting differential sensor signal 
spans from 1.2 to 36 mV/V, the IC provides digital compensation of sensor offset, 
sensitivity, temperature drift, and nonlinearity.
4.4  Digital Conversion 
Various A/D architectures are available for integration and interfacing with sensors. 
Conversion resolution, conversion accuracy, conversion speed or bandwidth, inher­
ent system noise levels, and power consumption are all ADC trade-offs. In assessing 
converter architecture, it is important to consider all of these aspects. For example, 
Figure 4.8  The integrated signal conditioning aspects of MEMSIC’s MXC622xXc accelerometer 
includes four heaters and heater control for the two thermal sensing elements. (Courtesy of MEMSIC, 
Inc. [15].)

4.4  Digital Conversion

errors due to temperature, supply voltage, linearity, and quantizing may reduce the 
accuracy of an ADC by several bits when all the error sources are considered. Also, 
bit accuracy alone may not be sufficient, especially if the sampling or conversion 
rate is incorrect for the sensor response under consideration [17]. Table 4.2 shows 
the quantizing errors and other parameters for 4- to 16-bit A/D conversion [18]. 
The quantization error (as a percent of full-scale range) is ±1/2 ⋅ 1/(2n – 1) ⋅ 100 
which is also ±1/2 LSB. The resolution is the LSB (least significant bit) percent full-
scale/100. The theoretical root mean square (rms) signal-to-noise ratio for an N-bit 
ADC is calculated with the following equation:
	
Signal-to-noise ratio = 6.02 ⋅ N + 1.76dB	
(4.1)
where N = number of bits.
4.4.1  A/D Converters
Common A/D conversion techniques include: single slope (ramp-integrating), 
dual slope integrating, tracking, successive approximation, folding (flash), and

ing features for bridge sensors. (Courtesy of ZMDI [16].)

Getting Sensor Information Into the Microcontroller
sigma-delta oversampled ADCs. A comparison of six types showing the relative 
conversion rate and relative silicon area required for each is shown in Table 4.3 
[17]. The impact of hardware versus software driven successive approximation 
should be noted.
Most ADCs can be classified into two groups based on the sampling rate; the 
Nyquist rate and oversampling converters. The Nyquist rate requires sampling the 
analog signals, which have maximum frequencies that is slightly less than the Ny­
quist frequency, fN = fs/2, where fs is the sampling frequency. However, input sig­
nals above the Nyquist frequency cannot be properly converted and often create 
signal distortion or aliasing. A low-pass, antialiasing filter attenuates frequencies 
above the Nyquist frequency and keeps the response below the noise floor.
Sigma-delta (S-∆), or delta-sigma, converters are based on digital filtering tech­
niques and can easily be integrated with digital signal processing (DSP) ICs. S-∆ 
converters sample at a frequency that is much higher than the Nyquist frequency. 
Figure 4.10 shows the block diagram of an oversampled, first-order S-∆ ADC [19]. 
The analog input is summed at the input node with the difference of the output 
of the 1-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The resulting signal is provided to 
an integrator and then to a 1-bit quantizer (ADC). A second-order S-∆ consists of 
two integrators, two summers, and the 1-bit quantizer. Second- or third-order S-∆ 
modulators reduce the baseband noise level even further than a first-order S-∆ unit.

The output of the S-D converter is averaged by applying it to the input of a 
digital decimation filter. The digital decimation filter performs three functions: (1) 
it removes out-of-band quantization noise that is equivalent to increasing the ef­
fective resolution of the digital output; (2) it performs decimation, or sample rate 
reduction, bringing the sampling rate down to the Nyquist rate (this minimizes the 
amount of information for subsequent transmission, storage, or signal processing); 
and (3) it provides additional anti-aliasing rejection for the input signal.
4.4.2  Performance of A/D Converters
Frequently, the sensor requires high resolution at moderately fast conversion rates. 
In such cases, signal gain ranging and/or offset zeroing with 8-bit ADCs can be used 
in a cost-effective manner. Input ranging/zeroing allows for an increase in dynamic 
range without compromising the total conversion time or significantly increasing 
the silicon area, and hence cost. As shown in Figure 4.11, 10 bits of signal input can 
be achieved by range amplification and/or offset zeroing prior to an 8-bit ADC. Be­
cause the ranging/zeroing is typically defined by the settling time of the operational 
amplifier, the total conversion time remains small in comparison to a full 10-bit A/D 
conversion. Depending on the application, 8-bit accuracy is not a limitation, since 
many processes normally operate around a rather small portion of the full-scale 
signal. A high degree of accuracy is required in the operating range, especially if the 
sensor is being used as a feedback element. By adjusting the input gain and offset, 
an 8-bit ADC can be placed at the optimum measurement point, but still be able to 
react to sudden excursions outside the normal range [17].
ADC resolution can also be increased with circuit techniques. For example, a 
circuit that uses both ADC and DAC channels of an MCU and a two-stage ampli­
fier that increases the effective resolution of an 8-bit ADC to 12 bits for pressure 
measurements has been designed [20]. Standard components were used for the 
MCU and amplifier circuit. An applied pressure in the midrange of a 200-kPa sen­
sor originally measured with an error of 0.3 kPa was subsequently reduced to 0.1 
kPa using this approach.
Figure 4.11  Increasing the accuracy of an 8-bit ADC.

���������������������������������������������������
Getting Sensor Information Into the Microcontroller
Another consideration in choosing an ADC is specifying the requirements 
within the noise sources of the system. These limitations may be due to a less-than-
optimum printed circuit layout, unstable power sources, nearby high-energy fields, 
and/or use of devices without good signal/noise and power supply CMRR. It is 
important to first assess the noise floor for the system and then to compare this to 
the desired resolution of the signal. If the combined system’s design and noise floor 
conditions create a minimum required signal that must be greater than 5 to 10 mil­
livolts, only 8 to 9 bits of resolution can be determined within a 5V system. Using a 
higher resolution, ADC will not provide any additional data unless the conversion 
speed of the ADC and processor throughput allows multiple sampling with data 
correction. Furthermore, this process must also meet the desired bandwidth, power 
consumption, and system response [21]. Oversampling and averaging is therefore 
desired because it is not possible to separate the noise from the signal using a single 
A/D sample/conversion.
4.4.3  Implications of A/D Accuracy and Errors
An amplified pressure signal supplied to an 8-bit ADC provides an example of the 
combined capability of the amplifier and the ADC. The resulting A/D conversion is 
related to the pressure input by the following equation:

Where VFS - VOffset is the sensor’s full-scale span voltage, 255 is the maximum 
number of counts from the 8-bit converter, and VRH - VRL is 5V, based on using 
the same 5V supply as the MCU. Using the same reference voltage for the ADC 
and the sensor minimizes the number of additional components but does sacrifice 
resolution. For those instances where greater resolution is required, separate lower 
voltage references should be provided for the ADC and/or the sensor.
For a sensor with a 0.25–4.75V output, the maximum number of counts avail­
able at the output register will be:

In general, ADC suppliers may provide several specifications to quantify the 
performance of an ADC. In addition to SNR, total harmonic distortion (THD) and 
total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N), popular specifications include sig­
nal-to-noise-and-distortion [SINAD, or S/(N + D)] and the effective number of bits 
(ENOB) [22]. SINAD is the ratio of the root-mean-square (rms) signal amplitude 
to the mean value of the root-sum-square (rss) of all other spectral components, 
including harmonics, but excluding dc. This value provides a good indication of 
the overall dynamic performance of an ADC because it includes all the compo­
nents that make up noise and distortion. Always lower than the theoretical ADC

4.5  On-Line Tool for Evaluating a Sensor Interface Design
Whether the signal conditioning function is an integrated or separate circuit, the 
complexity of modern ICs and the need for users to get to market quickly causes 
semiconductor suppliers to design and offer evaluation boards and development 
tools to simplify and accelerate the design-ion process. One of the more unique 
approaches is the online WEBENCH® design tool developed by National Semicon­
ductor, now part of Texas Instruments. Four configurable Analog Front End (AFE) 
ICs take advantage of the design tool’s capabilities. Figure 4.12 shows the block 
diagram of the LMP90100 resistive bridge AFE connected to a 5-inch of H2O basic 
pressure sensor [23]. The sensor was selected as the first step in the sensor/AFE de­
sign and evaluation process. Chip and channel configurable blocks are explained by 
simply passing over the desired block and are easily modified by pull-down menus. 
Among the design choices are a fully configurable 16- and 24-bit S-D ADCs. Once 
the selections are made, a performance of the design is presented that includes the 
samples per second rate that can be expected. 
4.6  Application Example 
High temperature signal conditioning circuitry enables higher temperature oper­
ation the application. The typical maximum operating temperature for even the 
highest instrumentation amplifier is typically 175°C. Analog Devices AD8229 uses 
dielectric isolation in its process in order to avoid leakage currents at high tempera­
tures and to achieve a 210°C operation [24]. To demonstrate its high temperature 
capability, the company measured the rotation inside of a rotisserie oven using 
the AD8229 and a thermocouple to indicate the temperature and a 175°C-rated 
ADXL206 dual-axis accelerometer to show rotation [25]. This combination of 
measurements allowed the real-time indication of rotation, temperature, and the 
thermal gradient of the oven. The temperature inside the chamber that exceeded 
180°C was limited by the accelerometer and other circuitry, but not the high tem­
perature amplifier. Figure 4.13 shows the narrow variation of one parameter of the 
high temperature operational amplifier, the typical input offset over temperature.
4.7  Summary
Several circuits and techniques are used to amplify the low-level output that is inher­
ently available from sensor or transducer elements. The circuits that were discussed 
interface the analog output of the sensor to the digital world of the microcontroller

Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
Backed by an increasingly powerful array of solid-state process technologies, inte­
grated sensors are expected to be widely applied to extend microcomputer-based 
control in a variety of areas.
—Kensall D. Wise, 1982 [1] 
5.1  Introduction
Several semiconductor technologies are available to improve the accuracy and qual­
ity of the measurements and to add diagnostics and other intelligence to any type 
of sensor. Foremost among these technologies are MCUs, DSPs, DSCs, ASICs, and 
FPGAs. Dedicated sensor signal processors are usually adaptations of one of these 
approaches. Some of these technologies also have the potential to allow for a fully 
integrated (monolithic) smart sensor. Before taking this step, it is important to un­
derstand the technologies that are available, their contribution to smart sensors, 
and their ability to provide a higher level of intelligence (and value) to sensors.
5.1.1  Other IC Technologies
ASIC technology utilizes computer aided design (CAD) software tools to achieve 
custom circuit designs. ASIC technology consists of programmable logic devices 
(PLDs) for low-circuit density, gate arrays for medium density, and standard cells 
for high-end custom circuits. ASIC devices combine high density and integration 
of full custom designs with relatively low cost and fast design turn-around. A 
custom highly-integrated chip utilizing core microprocessor cells, combined with 
analog, memory, and additional logic functions, can address specific sensing re­
quirements, such as fluid level sensing. Mixed-signal ASICs combine analog with 
digital capability.
Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and field-programmable analog ar­
rays (FPAA), analog versions of FPGAs, are attractive as sensor interfaces because 
they can minimize development time and they can be reconfigured after they have 
been in service. Both the FPGA and FPAA use a front-end circuit design program 
[2]. A circuit design is transferred to the FPGA (or FPAA) by either downloading 
converted serial data directly to the on-chip static random access memory (RAM) 

86

Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
in the FPGA or to the serial EPROM. A digital core incorporated in the FPGA de­
sign gives it the same kind of computing capability as an MCU with the advantages 
of field programmability. FPGAs are especially useful when rapid circuit prototyp­
ing and flexibility are required.
The term system on a chip (SOC or SoC) is frequently used to describe a highly 
integrated circuit, ASIC, MCU, DSP, or DSC that incorporates considerably more 
hardware options than previously available versions. These chips frequently incor­
porate application-specific software that is closely linked to the hardware that is 
on the chip. These chips include a large and increasing amount of the system, and 
reduce they the total chip count. In only the more simple systems are they actually 
the whole system. This is especially true with the sensor portion of the system. The 
added complexity of adding the sensor to the SOC makes a sensor system on a 
chip more difficult but the difficulty is minimized with CMOS compatible MEMS 
processes.
5.1.2  Logic Requirements
The shift of the logic requirements from a centralized computer to nodes in decen­
tralized systems is creating the need for smart sensors. Sensor-driven process control 
systems that eliminate human operators and increase the precision of the process 
will play an important role in the manufacturing of the semiconductors that control 
them. Essential aspects of any sensor system include amplification, A/D conver­
sion, a communications interface, and the computing portion. Amplification and 
A/D conversion were discussed in Chapter 4. The communications interface will be 
covered in Chapter 7. This chapter will use existing MCU, DSP, DSC, and FPGA 
products to demonstrate the remaining elements. 
5.2  MCU Control
Single-chip MCUs combine microprocessor unit (MPU) computing capability, vari­
ous forms of memory, a clock oscillator, and I/O capability on a monolithic struc­
ture as shown in Figure 5.1 [3]. MCUs provide flexibility and quick time-to-market 
for numerous embedded control systems and for smarter sensing solutions. The 
programmability and wide variety of peripheral options available in the microcon­
troller provide design options. These options can offset the cost of the additional 
circuitry by eliminating other components or by providing features that would oth­
erwise require far more components. In addition, high-volume MCUs enable sys­
tems to achieve low cost, high quality, and excellent reliability. 
To provide increasingly higher performance without sacrificing excessive pow­
er consumption, many suppliers offer MCUs with more than one core. The cores 
can either be identical or different.  With their higher capability, multicore MCUs 
typically target more complex system controls. Within the overall control strategy, 
a sensor (or multiple sensors that need their data measured and analyzed with tight 
constraints) can take advantage of multicore MCUs.

5.3  MCUs for Sensor Interface
In addition to the basic features of a microcontroller, a number of custom modules 
are integrated on the same chip in order to increase the utilization of the process, 
reduce printed circuit board space, and increase the functionality for a specific 
application. MCU features that have a significant impact on sensor system perfor­
mance will be discussed in this section. These include analog input capabilities, A/D 
conversion techniques, processing bandwidth, on-board memory, power conserva­
tion, and improved electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and control of radio fre­
quency interference (RFI). The same features, possibly with different specifications, 
perform similarly on 8-bit families of MCUs and higher performance 16-bit and 
32-bit products as well.
5.3.1  Peripherals
Existing MCU technology contains a variety of peripherals or hardware options 
that enhance the capability of the MCU. Peripherals enable the MCU to obtain 
information from sensors and control output devices. Some of the most common 
peripherals are general purpose input/output (I/O) ports, timers, and serial ports.
Timers usually measure time relative to the internal clock on the chip or an 
externally provided clock signal. An on-chip oscillator that operates up to 4.0 MHz 
at 5V or 1 MHz at 3V controls the clock on the chip. A more complex timer can 
generate one or more PWM (pulse width modulated) signals, measure the pulse 
width, and generate additional output pulse trains.
Three basic serial ports are the serial communications interface (SCI), the se­
rial peripheral interface (SPI) and the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus. The SCI

Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
is a simple 2-pin interface that operates asynchronously.  Data is transmitted on 
one pin and received on the other. Start and stop bits synchronize communications 
between two devices. The SCI port is a universal asynchronous receiver transmit­
ter (UART) that can be used with an RS-232 level translator to communicate with 
personal or other types of computers over fairly long distances. 
The SPI port requires a third pin to provide the synchronizing signal between 
the control chip and an external peripheral. This type of communication is usually 
on the same board. Standard SPI peripherals are available from many manufactur­
ers and include A/D converters, display drivers, electrically erasable programmable 
ROM (EEPROM), and shift registers.
The I2C bus is a patented interface developed by NXP Semiconductors (for­
merly Philips Semiconductors) [4].  The half-duplex, synchronous, multimaster bus 
requires only two wires to transmit data (SDA) and clock (SCL) signals. The master 
communicates with individual slaves by using a 7-bit or 10-bit address. Initially de­
fined with a maximum of 100 kbit per second (standard), a 400 kbit fast-mode and 
high-speed 3.4 Mbit option are now available, as well as a fast-mode plus transfer 
rate between the latter two. 
5.3.2  Memory
Various types of memory can be integrated on a chip, including RAM, ROM, 
EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory. Semiconductor memory is based on a single 
transistor or cell that is on or off to generate a bit that is either a one or a zero. 
Memory is classified as either volatile or nonvolatile. Volatile memory is not stored 
when the power is disconnected to the MCU. Nonvolatile memory is stored when 
power is disconnected. The amount of memory in a chip is usually rated in kilobytes 
(1 KB = 1024 bits). Increasing the amount of memory increases the chip size and the 
chip cost. Some types of memory, such as EEPROM, can significantly increase the 
process complexity and also add to the cost.
Random access memory (RAM) can be read or written (changed) by the central 
processing unit (CPU) and is volatile [3]. Read only memory (ROM) can be read 
but not changed. This nonvolatile memory is included in the design (masked layout) 
of the chip. Reprogramming a chip once it has been designed is a common practice 
to correct errors in the original software, to upgrade in order to improve system 
performance, or to adjust for variation that could have occurred since the system 
was initially installed. Erasable programmable ROM (EPROM) can be changed by 
erasing the contents with an ultraviolet light and then reprogramming new values. 
This nonvolatile memory has a limited number of erasure and reprogramming op­
erations. One-time programmable ROM (OTP ROM) is the same as EPROM, ex­
cept that it is packaged in a lower cost opaque package.  Since ultraviolet light can­
not penetrate the package, this memory cannot be erased after it is programmed. 
Electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), and frequently E2ROM, is 
a nonvolatile memory that can be changed by using electrical signals. Typically, an 
EEPROM location can be erased and reprogrammed thousands of times before it 
wears out due to field stress. 
The most common memory for control applications is flash memory. Nonvola­
tile flash memory is easily reprogrammed in the application and is done faster than 
EEPROM. Once it is programmed, flash memory contents remain intact until an 

5.3  MCUs for Sensor Interface 
89
erase cycle is initiated by the software. Program and erase voltages for EEPROM 
and flash are performed at approximately 12V. 
Two of the newest memory types are ferroelectric random-access memory (Fe­
RAM or FRAM) and magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM). Both can 
be embedded in controllers. Unlike FeRAM, which is based on charge, MRAM 
uses the magnetic properties of materials. Table 5.1 compares four different types 
of memory [5].
The ferroelectric effect is the tendency of dipoles within a crystal to align in 
the presence of an electric field and to remain polarized after the field is removed 
[6]. Reversing the field causes polarization in the opposite direction. No current is 
required to maintain either state, which provides a binary memory capacitor with 
low power consumption. Advantages of FeRAM for sensing applications include:
••
Very fast write times (up to 20 times faster than EEPROM; 
••
Write/erase endurance up to 10 million times greater than EEPROM;
••
Arrays up to eight times larger than prior versions;
••
Lower voltage, lower power operation to conserve battery life.
One company has developed its MRAM process specifically for integration in 
SOC products, such as the combination of microcontrollers and MRAM on one 
chip [7]. MRAM can replace flash, EEPROM, and SRAM with a single nonvolatile 
fast memory with essentially unlimited endurance. Using a few added mask steps, 
MRAM can be embedded in the last two metal layers of standard CMOS logic 
processes.
5.3.3  Input/Output
Input/output (I/O) is a special type of memory that senses or changes based on 
external digital elements and not the CPU [3]. I/O ports connect these external ele­
ments to the CPU and provide control capability for the system. I/O can be either 
parallel, transferring eight data bits at a time to the MCU, or serial, transferring 
data one bit at a time.

Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
General purpose I/O connections (pins) can either be used as an input or an 
output. A number of pins is typically grouped together and called a port. The pro­
gram determines the function of each pin. Program instructions evaluate the logic 
state of each input and drive outputs to logic one or zero in order to implement the 
control strategy.  Input-capture and output-compare functions in the MCU simplify 
the design of the control strategy. 
Input-capture is used to record the time that an event occurred. By recording 
the time for successive edges on an input signal, software can determine the period 
and/or the pulse width of the signal. Two successive edges of the same polarity are 
captured to measure a period. Two alternate polarity edges are captured to measure 
a pulse width [8].
Output-compare is used to program an action at a specified time. For example, 
an output is generated when the output-compare register matches the value of a 
16-bit counter. Specific duration pulses and time-delay are easy to implement with 
this function.
5.3.4  On-Board A/D Conversion
Various types of ADCs were discussed in Chapter 4. An ADC is frequently inte­
grated with the MCU. For MCUs, the successive approximation register (SAR) is 
the most popular method of performing A/D conversions due to its fast conversion 
speed and ease of use with multiplexed input signals.  An 8-bit ADC in 8-bit MCUs 
has a theoretical resolution of about 0.39%.
For those instances where higher resolution is required, the SPI port of an 
MCU allows external circuitry to be interfaced.  For example, an integrated circuit 
such as Linear  Technologies’ LTC1290 connected to the SPI clock, data in, data 
out, and one additional programmable output pin of an MCU provides a 4-wire 
interface for a 12-bit data conversion. The data are transferred in two 8-bit shifts to 
the MCU in 40 ms.  By adding the 12-bit capability, the resolution is improved from 
0.39% to 0.0244%. Many modern 8-bit MCUs have higher resolution ADCs, in­
cluding 10-bit, 12-bit, and even two independent 16-bit SARs.
A 32-bit MCU demonstrates the additional capability and flexibility of higher-
performance controllers. Designed to address the touch-screen controller (TSC) 
requirements of consumer electronic products, Freescale Semiconductor’s i.MX25 
multimedia applications processor has an embedded 12-bit successive-approxima­
tion ADC. Figure 5.2 shows the clock diagram for generating the clock to the ADC. 
To eliminate the complexity of a multiclock domain, the ADC module uses 
only one root clock generated from the i.MX25 IPG clock. The i.MX25’s IPG root 
clock is typically 66.67 MHz, but in low-power mode, it can be reduced to 33.33 
MHz or 16.66 MHz. Also, the clock control module (CCM), can gate the ADC 
module root clock on or off or the ADC clock can be gated off within the ADC 
module.
5.3.5  Power Saving Capability
An advantage of the combination of MCU hardware and software is a variety of 
power saving approaches.  Varying the processing speed or stopping processing 

5.3  MCUs for Sensor Interface 
91
altogether can have a significant impact on overall power consumption. In addi­
tion, the ability to operate at lower voltages also reduces the power consumption. 
Reducing the power consumption involves more than reducing the supply current 
while running processor code. For example, extending the life of battery-powered 
sensors and other circuitry requires keeping the average current consumption as 
low as possible [10]. As show in Figure 5.3, through short activation time for pe­
riodic measurements, an application can draw much more current and still have 
the average current consumption remain quite low and very close to the standby 
current level.

Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
5.3.6  Local Voltage or Current Regulation
On-board voltage or current regulation is important to sensors that are not ratio­
metric since the variation in supply voltage over a –40°C to 125°C operating range 
can be greater than ±5%. The availability of analog control circuitry with high volt­
age (e.g., 40V or higher) standoff capability allows the integration of a series pass 
5V regulator on the MCU [11]. Availability of a similar shunt regulator allows a 
two-wire self-protected and self-powered system to be designed using only a sensor 
and an MCU. At higher levels of integration, such as analog voltage and/or current 
regulation, can both reduce component count and improve accuracy. Furthermore, 
these regulation schemes can be dynamically altered to improve functionality or 
reduce power consumption.
5.4  DSP Control 
DSPs have a hardware arithmetic capability that allows the real-time execution of 
feedback filter algorithms. In contrast, MCUs use look-up tables to approximate 
filter algorithms with inherent limitations of flexibility and accuracy. A DSP that 
executes instructions in less than 100 ns allows a peak execution rate of 20 millions 
of instructions (or integer operations) per second (MIPS). DSPs are also rated in 
millions of operations per second (MOPS), where the MOPS rating is several times 
the MIPS rating.  
Initial distinguishing characteristics of DSPs include a multiplier or multiply ac­
cumulator (MAC) for arithmetic calculations and floating-point unit processing for 
high dynamic range. However, this has changed over the years. Fixed-point DSPs 
are quite common today. While many DSPs address high processing power, some 
also target low-power, cost-sensitive applications, such as portable products [12]. 
With performance up to 300 MHz for 600 MIPS, Texas Instruments’s C5000 DSP 
platform provides low power consumption, a high level of peripheral integration, 
and large on-chip memory to reduce overall system cost. The fixed-point 16-bit 
DSP includes: 
••
Total active core power at less than 0.15 mW/MHz at 1.05V;
••
1–3 low-dropout regulators (LDOs) enable integrated power management;
••
Standby power at less than 0.15 mW;
••
On-chip memory options ranging from 64 KB to 320 KB.
The need for real-time processing in several systems dictates the need for DSP 
technology for that portion of the control function.  This growing class of func­
tions cannot work effectively with traditional table look-up and interpolate func­
tions to make the control decision. Instead, the MAC unit allows state estimator 
functions to be implemented with an algorithm defining the state. However, MCUs 
historically excelled at system control, especially related to timing and sequencing 
operations. With the increasing need for the capabilities of both an MCU and a 
DSP, the line between the two has somewhat blurred. For example, Analog Devices 
Blackfin 16/32-bit processor family is classified both as an MCU and a DSP. The 
family combines a 32-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC)-like instruction 

5.4  DSP Control  
93
set to perform smaller number of instructions at higher speeds and dual 16-bit 
MAC [13].
Many devices combine an MCU core with a DSP core, such as Texas Instru­
ments’s DaVinci TMS320DM644x and TMS320DM646x, which are both DSP-
based devices that are optimized for video/display applications with an ARM9 
processor for control functions. The use of the MCU versus the DSP portion can 
impact the performance of an integrated MCU-DSP. For example, Infineon’s 32-
bit TriCore MCU-DSP with a 100 MHz core has a sustained 130 MIPs rating and 
delivers 80 MCU MIPs plus 50 DSP MIPs, or 40 MCU MIPs plus 90 DSP MIPs, 
depending on the implementation of load sharing in software [14].
5.4.1  Digital Signal Controllers
DSCs are another evolution of DSP technology. In contrast to DSPs that address 
high-speed processing, DSCs typically target low-speed processing. I/O specific pe­
ripherals in DSCs allow them to address sensing requirements in consumer elec­
tronics and motor control applications. Definitions of the capabilities of DSCs 
vary from supplier to supplier. Texas Instruments defines DSCs as “processors that 
combine the high-performance math and algorithmic capabilities of a DSP with 
the peripheral, memory integration and ease-of use of traditional microcontrollers 
(MCUs)” [15]. 
DSCs have become very popular for computationally-intense sensing appli­
cations. Using DSCs, engineers can more efficiently perform many system-level 
tasks. These include: filtering sensor signal noise, improving signal-to-noise ratio, 
compensating for sensor degradation over time, and dealing with sensor-to-sensor 
variability [15]. However, the continued need for MCU functionality in control 
systems has also blurred the distinction between these controllers. Figure 5.4 shows 
a block diagram for Microchip Technology’s dsPIC33E DSC and PIC24E MCU for 
motor control and general purpose applications where one aspect of the core of the 
separates one device from the other [16]. In addition to the DSP engine that is only 
in the DSC, the barrel shifter that manipulates data, especially in arithmetic opera­
tions associated with DSP operation, is not offered in the MCU.
5.4.2  Field Programmable Gate Arrays
FPGAs are another approach to obtain DSP functionality. The highly configurable 
hardware of FPGAs can provide distributed DSP resources. As shown in Figure 
5.5, four different tasks are handled by separate DSPs with their own memory and 
I/O [17]. This level of computing power and the ability to have it quickly for both 
development and production volumes has become an enabler for radar sensing 
and vision sensing in high-end vehicles [18, 19]. For example, an FPGA evaluation 
board with four cameras can provide a surround view system or can be decoupled 
into multiple systems, including rear view parking and blind spot detection.
5.4.3  Algorithms Versus Look-Up Tables 
MCUs use look-up tables to store values that are accessed when the program is 
running. Algorithms are used to correct for variations from expected results and to 

94 
�������������������������������������
Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
implement a control strategy. The speed of accessing the information from a table 
or performing a calculation determines the response time of the sensor input to 
the MCU/DSP portion of the system. This can be the limiting factor to initiating a 
change to the output in an MCU/DSP-controlled system.
Figure 5.4  In this block diagram for an MCU and DSC, the only aspects separating the two are the DSP 
engine and barrel shifters that are only in the DSC. (© Microchip Technology, Inc. [16]).

Altera [17].)

5.5  Techniques and Systems Considerations 
95
A control/sensor combination can implement an electronically programmable 
trim as an alternative to laser trimming. However, all trimming and calibration 
processes for a sensor require some form of data conversion by the MCU or DSP. 
The time it takes to perform these conversions by mathematical calculations or get 
data from a look-up table must be within the control system’s ability to respond 
to the sensed input.  In the application, real-time trimming can be implemented in 
order to allow adaptive control at the sensor level. This will improve the accuracy 
of a sensor that has drifted after some time in operation. 
5.5  Techniques and Systems Considerations
Increased precision can be obtained for sensors by characterizing devices over tem­
perature and pressure (or acceleration, force, etc.) and storing correction algorithms 
in MCU memory. The MCU can convert the measurement to display different units 
(i.e., psi, kPa, mmHg, or inches of water for pressure measurements). Other tech­
niques use the MCU’s capability to improve linearization, to provide PWM outputs 
for control, and to provide auto-zeroing/auto-ranging. The operating frequency 
and switching capability of the MCU must be considered in system design. Lastly, 
the MCU’s computing capability can be used in place of sensor(s) when sufficient 
information exists. These system aspects will be explored in this section.
5.5.1  Linearization
Sensor nonlinearity can be improved by the use of table look-up algorithms. The 
variation in sensor signal caused by temperature can also be improved by using an 
integrated temperature sensor and a look-up table to compensate for temperature 
effects while linearizing the output, nulling offsets, and setting full-scale gain from 
information stored in an EEPROM or flash memory. Look-up tables can be imple­
mented in masked ROM, field programmable EPROM, onboard EEPROM, or 
flash memory.  
Compensation for nonlinearity and the number of measurements during the 
test and calibration procedure can be simplified if a nonlinear output correlates 
with a sensor design parameter. For example, a strong correlation was found be­
tween the span and linearity of a pressure sensor with a thin diaphragm [20]. As 
Figure 5.6 shows, the nonlinearity increased to almost 5% with the highest span 
units.
Analytical techniques were investigated to improve the nonlinearity. A polyno­
mial regression analysis was performed on 139 sensor samples ranging from 30 to 
70 mV full scale span to determine the coefficients B0, B1, and B2 in the formula:

where B0, B1, B2, and B3 are sensitivity coefficients. The second order terms were 
sufficient for calculations to agree with measured data with a worst case value for 
calculated regression coefficient = 0.99999. The relationship of these values to the 
span allowed a piece-wise linearization technique with four windows to reduce the 
linearization error of most sensors to less than 0.5%. These calculations could be

included in the MCU look-up table for improved accuracy in an application. Others 
have also investigated linearization in great detail as a general means to improve 
sensor accuracy [21, 22].
5.5.2  PWM Control
The pulse width modulation (PWM) output from the MCU can be used to convert 
an analog sensor output to a digital format for signal transmission in remote sensing 
or noisy environments [23]. Figure 5.7 shows the simple, inexpensive circuitry used 
to create a duty cycle that is linear to the applied pressure. The MCU-generated 
pulse train is applied to a ramp generator. The frequency and duration of the pulse 
can be accurately controlled in software. The MCU requires input-capture and 
output-compare timer channels. The output-capture pin is programmed to output 
the pulse train that drives the ramp generator, while the input-capture pin detects 
edge transitions to measure the PWM output pulse width. The pulse width changes 
from 50 to almost 650 µs for zero to full scale output for this sensor.
5.5.3  Autozero and Autorange
Combining a sensor and an MCU to perform a measurement that otherwise would 
be less accurate or more costly than other available alternatives is feasible today. 
The cost of many MCUs is comparable or lower than the micromachined sensors 
that provide their input signal. For example, a signal conditioned pressure sensor 
has been combined with an MCU to measure 1.5 inch or less of water with an ac­
curacy of 1% of the full scale reading [24]. The MCU provides software calibration, 
software temperature compensation, and dynamic-zero capability. Also, a digital 
output compatible with the SPI protocol is provided for the pressure measurement.
Figure 5.6  Span versus linearity for pressure sensor output.

5.5  Techniques and Systems Considerations 
97
Auto referencing can be performed by the MCU to correct for common-mode 
errors, especially with low-level signals. Auto referencing uses the MCU logic and 
clock signal, combined with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and counter. A 
signal from the MCU initiates the counter. The DAC provides a sample-and-hold 
and programmable voltage source. The sensor output is summed with the autore­
ference correction at the input of an amplifier to obtain a corrected output to the 
system.
A calibration-free method for pressure sensors has been designed using a cali­
brated pressure sensor, an MCU with integral A/D converter, and two additional 
ICs [25]. As shown in Figure 5.8, two input channels (for V1 and V2) and one out­
put port (P) are used in the calibration portion of this system. The analog switches 
provide voltages V1 and V2 that are converted and stored in registers in the MCU. 
The switches are then put in the opposite direction and the new values are stored. 
The MCU adds the differential results that becomes and input to the A/D converter. 
All errors from the instrument amplifier are canceled in this circuit using the dif­
ferential conversion. For a measurement that only requires a full scale accuracy of 
±2.5%, the offset of the pressure sensor can be neglected and the system does not 
require any calibration procedure. For a ±1% measurement, the full scale output 
is set at 25°C.

Using MCUs/DSPs to Increase Sensor IQ
5.5.4  Diagnostics
One of the more valuable contributions that digital control can make to the sen­
sor’s functionality is the ability to self test, analyze status, diagnose, and report 
problems to an operator or other systems that use the sensor’s output. The problem 
could be as simple as a warning for maintenance, or calibration or an indication 
of catastrophic failure that would not allow the system to function when required. 
For example, an automotive air bag system may operate for years without requiring 
deployment. However, knowing that the sensor is capable of providing the signal to 
indicate a crash event is part of the safety that the system can routinely provide to 
the driver and passenger. In the air bag system, a dash indicator lamp is activated 
by the MCU to indicate that it has performed a system-ready analysis. A lamp that 
stays on or flashes indicates that the MCU has detected a fault and that the system 
needs servicing.
5.5.5  Reducing EMC/RFI
Radiated radio frequency interference (RFI) and electromagnetic interference 
(EMI)—both the transmitting and receiving of unwanted signals or electromag­
netic compatibility (EMC)—of a device is becoming an important design consid­
eration with increasingly higher levels of system integration and higher processing 
bandwidths. These problems can be reduced at the component level with smaller 
radiation loops and a smaller number of signal lines. Power management in the 
MCU can also eliminate some self-induced effects that generate RFI to the sensor 
element. An example of power management is called “quiet time sampling.” This 
circuit technique performs analog switching when digital switching is not present 
[26]. Cleaner samples of data are taken by halting high current, high frequency ac­
tivity while the sensor input is being measured. Normal digital processing functions 
continue once these values are in memory. 
5.5.6  Indirect (Computed not Sensed) Versus Direct Sensing
Inputs to the MCU can be manipulated to provide additional data for a system. For 
example, the MCU can use an input pressure signal to provide maximum pressure, 
Figure 5.8  Calibration-free pressure sensor system. (© Freescale, Inc., 2012. Used with permission [25].)

5.6  Software, Tools, and Support 
99
minimum pressure, an integrated (averaged) pressure, and time-differentiated pres­
sure data to a system. An accelerometer signal processed by a signal processor can 
be integrated once to provide velocity and twice to provide displacement informa­
tion. Also, a single sensor input to an MCU can replace several switches sensing the 
same parameter and can provide programmable switch points for outputs.
The ability to compute rather than sense is among the solutions that MCUs 
bring to control applications. For example, in three-phase motor control systems, a 
Hall-effect sensor is used to sense the location of the magnetic field for each phase 
or the rotor speed in induction motors. An MCU uses this signal to switch output 
drivers for pulse-width modulated control. The sensors in this system have been a 
target for cost reduction for many years. Popular solutions have eliminated the sen­
sors (this is called a sensorless technique) by using the MCU to compute the rotor 
speed and slip angular frequency from other available information, including the 
primary resistance [27]. 
5.6  Software, Tools, and Support
Creating a new approach or alternative to existing control technologies requires 
much more than the architecture. The software that is used to program the control 
portion and tools that allow the system to be developed are equally important. Por­
table code (software compatibility) is essential if future end products may require 
migration to a higher performance MCU or to a DSP/DSC. Keeping the sensor’s 
design and process simple and separate from the MCU or DSP allows the imple­
mentation with several available processors. 
One of the main advantages of using existing MCUs, DSCs, or DSPs is the 
development tools that already exist and allow the designer to quickly and easily 
develop both system hardware and software. In many cases, the tools and proces­
sor are familiar to experts in the design community; the capabilities and limitations 
are well-understood. The tools include software tools, compliers, and debuggers. 
Many suppliers offer USB design tools that can address sensor applications. The 
development tools and the documentation that has been established over several 
years of customer usage are available for many suppliers for MCUs, DSPs, and 
DSCs. As a result, the capability exists to develop the smartest sensor that can be 
defined today.
5.6.1  Design-in Support
Touch screen sensing is one of the increasingly popular techniques for human ma­
chine interface, especially on portable products. This capability is enabled specifi­
cally by MCUs. There are several approaches to perform the sensing. 
As shown in Figure 5.9, a mutual capacitance approach to sensing provides 
more sensors and more accurate results than a self-capacitance technique [28]. This 
is because self-capacitance produces an ambiguity of the touch point, or what is 
sometimes called a ghost pattern, because two fingers on one line provide the same 
results as a single finger. In contrast, with the mutual capacitance design, each XY 
intersection on the screen is individually addressed so all touch points are unam-

biguously sensed. Implementing this technology requires an MCU such as Atmel’s 
mXT224 maXTouch touchscreen controller. 
The mXT224 is a 224-node highly configurable touchscreen controller with a 
touch response greater than 250 Hz that delivers 12-bit × 12-bit resolution. The 
EVK-mxt224A kit allows evaluation of the capacitive-to-digital conversion (CDC) 
technique and the overall performance of the chip [29]. The modular kit includes a 
4.3-inch touchscreen and printed circuit board with the mXT224 that can be con­
nected to a PC through a USB connection. PC software allows the evaluation the 
full range of configuration options including the device’s multitouch and built-in 
gesture capabilities. In addition, the kit has comprehensive documentation and a 
quick start guide to simplify the evaluation.
5.7  Sensor Integration
The fourth level in advancing integration (refer to Figure 1.7) combines a CMOS-
compatible sensor with integrated analog and digital circuitry. Through wafer-level 
packaging, several companies have products that combine the digital computing 
portion with a MEMS sensor. The die size does not increase if the MEMS struc­
ture is built over the CMOS logic used for the MCU or DSP as part of the CMOS 
fabrication process. For example, the MEMSIC MXC6226XC dual-axis thermal 
accelerometer has integrated signal conditioning circuitry including a DSP [30]. As 
shown in Figure 5.10, in addition to the DSP, the integrated circuitry includes am­
plification and ADC, sensitivity thermal compensation and fine gain adjust control, 
an I2C interface, and more. This is a sensor with an integrated DSP for improving 
the sensors operation in the system and not a DSP with an integrated sensor.
An alternative approach to integrating digital control with the sensor is shown 
in Figure 5.11. In this case, the MPL3115A2 has a separate pressure sensor and a 
dedicated ASIC integrated side-by-side in the same package [32]. The digital signal 
processing and control and trim logic blocks are the digital portion of the ASIC, 
and the rest of the blocks are analog circuitry. For high accuracy in barometric 
measurements, the circuitry has 20-bit resolution to detect altitude changes as low 
as 0.3m. The I2C output operates up to 400 kHz. Power management in the con­
trol circuitry has a standby mode current draw of 2 µA or 8.5 µA at 1 Hz in the

low-power mode. Because the unit handles communications, power management, 
and algorithms for the sensing application, these functions are offloaded from a 
host MCU. 
5.8  Application Example
Electrically-powered cars and trucks, such as electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric 
vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) require advanced 
MCU technology to control their traction motors. For the highest overall efficiency, 
the motors use Field Oriented Control (FOC) to generate sinusoidal commutation 
[personal e-mail communication from Renesas, March 14, 2012]. This commuta­
tion process requires the transformation of two motor phase currents into the Iq 
and Id components of the torque and flux vectors using Clarke and Park trans­
forms.  The Park transform and the inverse Park transform used in the PWM con­
trol algorithm require the current rotor position as an input.
While it is possible to use a sensorless design (see Section 5.5.6) and estimate 
the rotor position fed to the Park transform, the inaccuracy would reduce the ef­
ficiency.  Consequently, traction motor applications always use a position sensor. 
Because a resolver (an electromagnetic induction-type angular sensor) generates 
very accurate position information in fractions of a degree resolution, even when 
stopped, it is usually the sensor of choice.  To provide smooth operation, a traction 
motor accelerating from stall under a high torque load requires very accurate rotor 
position information that most encoders would be incapable of providing. 
Figure 5.12 shows a block diagram of the inverter control circuit for the three-
phase motor [33]. An MCU designed specifically for the control of these motors 
integrates the resolver to digital (RD) converter, as well as several additional ap­
plication peripherals. These include excitation signal generating function timer 
pattern buffer (TPBA), a high-precision motor control timer (TSG2), ADC with

size (critical dimensions) into the sub-µm range. These goals have lead to lower 
supply voltages (3.3V and less). In addition, customer requirements for increased 
and more easily programmed memory and reduced development cost and system 
design cycle time continue to affect the design and methodology used to create these 
products. The resulting improvements can be useful in the development of smart 
sensors and can be cost-effective by using other capabilities provided by the MCU, 
DSP, DSC, ASIC, or FPGA. Communicating the data from smart sensors is among 
the capabilities that can be integrated on chip and is such a critical part that Chap­
ter 7 will be dedicated to this aspect of the control logic.

Communications for Smart Sensors
Metcalfe’s Law points to a critical mass of connectivity after which the benefits of 
a network grow larger than its costs.
—Bob Metcalfe, co-inventor of Ethernet [1]
6.1  Introduction
The increasing interest in smart sensors is a direct result of the need to communicate 
and share sensor information in distributed control systems and networks of all 
sorts. The internet of things (IoT) and other connectivity concepts that use sensors 
have resulted in predictions of thousands of sensors existing for each person on 
earth, resulting in trillions of sensors in use by the 2020s [2]. Unfortunately, numer­
ous protocols have been defined for data communication. While Ethernet is the 
most widely installed local area network (LAN), industry standards have been (and 
are being) developed for various applications. Within a given market segment, sev­
eral protocols continue vying for acceptance. The widespread availability of these 
protocols in silicon hardware from several manufacturers is essential, but does not 
guarantee long-term success. This chapter will provide background information, 
identify many of the existing communication protocols, and describe silicon chips 
that integrate hardware and software to support system designs and the commu­
nication of sensor data in wired networks. The intent is to bring out issues associ­
ated with communicating sensor and system data and not to provide an in-depth 
understanding of the protocols. Protocols for wireless networks will be covered in 
Chapter 8. Chapter 12 goes into the details of the IEEE 1451 standards developed 
specifically for sensors.
6.2  Background and Definitions
Data communication from sensor inputs must be analyzed recognizing that the sen­
sor is a part of an entire control system. Several industry committees and individual 
companies have expended considerable effort to generate acceptable protocols that 
will support the requirements for distributed control. System functionality and the 

108 
��������������������������������
Communications for Smart Sensors
ability to use available silicon hardware, software, and development tools must be 
considered when selecting a protocol for a given application. 
6.2.1  Definitions
Several new terms and definitions are used to describe the communication of system 
information. A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules for communications. The 
bus connects internal or external circuit components and can be serial or parallel, 
but the serial approach is more common. A device-level bus connects basic control 
elements (the sensors and actuators) to a host controller. Multiplexing (MUX) is 
the combining of several messages for transmission over the same signal path. Ac­
cess to the bus is obtained through an arbitration process. Bit-by-bit arbitration is 
also called collision detection. Contention is the ability to gain access to the bus on 
a predetermined priority. Latency is guaranteed access (with maximum priority) 
within a defined time. A deterministic system can predict the future behavior of a 
signal. 
The system goal of interoperability will permit sensors or actuators from one 
supplier to be substituted for one from another manufacturer. Different types of 
networks are shown in Figure 6.1. The star, ring, and linear (tree, multidrop) are 
common topologies, or methods of connecting data lines to system nodes. The use 
of master-slave relationships—although an important part of control networks—is 
giving way to the use of more distributed intelligence in many applications.
The 4- to 20-mA standard of the Instrument Society of America (ISA) has 
been the analog data transmission standard for over forty years. However, digital 
techniques provide more system functionality and increased noise immunity for 
signal transmission. Digital interface formats for point-to-point or multidrop com­
munications are shown in Table 6.1 [3]. These protocols have seen limited use in 
computer-controlled systems. The EIA-485 is most often used for digital field bus 
applications. It is the physical layer in Profibus and Bitbus protocols. The EIA-485 
is a balanced-line (differential) data transmission over a single twisted-wire pair 
[3]. However, examining the different market segments, an even wider variety of 
standards exists. 
6.2.2  Background
The International Standards Organization (ISO) has defined the Open Systems In­
terconnect (OSI) model that describes seven layers for data networking. The layers 
and their functions are shown in Figure 6.2 [4]. Available and proposed standards 
typically use all or a portion of these layers to define the standard.
In a distributed system, a node contains the sensor (or actuator), the hardware 
for local computations, and the network interface [5]. The term sensor bus is fre­
quently used when sensors are connected in a system using a multiplexed bus and 
allowing packets from different senders to be sent to different receivers. A higher-
level sensor network uses all layers of the OSI model to provide more information 
and simplify the user’s system design and maintenance activity.

6.3  Sources (Organizations) and Standards
Several universities have developed standards for communication. For example, 
the University of Michigan has proposed the Michigan parallel standard (MPS) [6]. 
Researchers at Delft University of Technology have developed a serial communica­
tions protocol [7]. The Integrated Smart Sensor (IS2) bus is a mixed analog/digital 
two-line serial bus interface designed to provide a microinstrumentation system 
for industrial applications. However, a protocol requires more than definition and 
demonstration hardware. Accepted usage by a number of manufacturers ultimately 
determines the real standards that may be de facto standards. University-developed 
protocols may achieve acceptance with the adaptation of industrial users, but this 
process takes longer than utilizing existing industry-sponsored standards. The focus

different market segments. A list of several standards, including those developed 
by universities, manufacturers, and standards organizations, is shown in Table 6.2. 
Some of these are far less accepted than others and others may not be used at all.

6.4  Automotive Protocols
Due to its large volumes, the automotive segment has driven specifications, result­
ing in the actual implementation of protocols in several products. In automobiles, 
information from one sensor and/or data from one system can be communicated 
with other systems by using multiplex wiring to reduce the number of sensors and 
the amount of wire that is used in a vehicle. While several protocols have been 
proposed and implemented by different manufacturers, today the most common 
automotive protocols are Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect 
Network (LIN), Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST), and FlexRay. These 
and several other protocols developed for specific manufacturer’s applications are 
listed in Table 6.2. 
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) was initially established SAE J1850 
as the standard for multiplexing and data communications in U.S. automobiles 
in 1994. However, data communications for trucks and On-Board Diagnostics II 
(OBDII) were based on the CAN protocol. Today, CAN is the predominant vehicle 
data bus. A comparison of the performance, capabilities, and use of today’s most 
popular automotive protocols is shown in Table 6.3 [8].
The SAE Vehicle Network for Multiplexing and Data Communications (Mul­
tiplex) Committee defined three classes of vehicle networks: Class A, Class B, and 
Class C [9]. Class A is for low-speed applications, such as body lighting. Class B 
is for data transfer between nodes to eliminate redundant sensors and other sys­
tem elements. Class C is for high-speed communications and data rates that are 
typically associated with real-time control systems. The data rates and latencies for 
these three classes are summarized in Table 6.4.

6.4  Automotive Protocols 
113
6.4.1  CAN Protocol
CAN is a serial communications protocol developed by Robert Bosch GmbH that 
was originally designed for automotive multiplex wiring systems, especially high-
speed data communications. CAN supports distributed real-time control with a 
high level of security and message integrity. It has also become attractive for use in 
lower speed and other distributed control applications. 
The original CAN specification was announced in the 1980s. A revision, CAN 
2.0, was announced in 1991. CAN 2.0 consists of an A and B part. Part A is 
known as CAN 2.0 A, CAN 1.2, and BasicCAN. Part A specifies an 11-bit identi­
fier field, includes no specification for message filtering, and has a layered archi­
tecture description based on Bosch’s internal model. Part B enhancements include 
an extended 29-bit identifier field, some message filtering requirements, and layer 
description based on ISO/OSI reference model. The 29-bit identifier field allows 
the automotive standard protocol, SAE J1850, 3-byte headers to be mapped into 
the CAN identifier field. However, minimum CAN compliance is established by 
conformance to CAN 2.0 A only [10].
CAN is a multimaster protocol that allows any network node to communi­
cate with any other node on the same network. Any node can initiate a transmis­
sion once it has determined that the network is idle. CAN properties include user-
defined message prioritization. CAN is actually a nondeterministic system, but a

guaranteed maximum latency for highest prioritization can be calculated. Lower 
priorities are determined on a statistical basis. CAN utilizes carrier sense, multiple 
access/collision resolution (CSMA/CR) for nondestructive collision resolution. The 
arbitration technique is bitwise and results in the highest priority message being 
transmitted with low latency time. The flexible system configuration allows user-
options that have been led to CAN developed systems in automotive and industrial 
applications [10]. 
The message format for CAN is a fixed format frame with a variable number 
of data bytes. Zero to eight data bytes are permissible. The minimum data frame 
length is 44 bit times. Four message types are defined: data frame, remote frame, er­
ror frame, and overload frame. The messages are routed to receiving nodes through 
the use of message identifiers and message filtering. Functional addressing allows 
multiple nodes to act on a single message. However, nothing in the hardware pre­
vents the user from using physical addressing to achieve node-to-node addressing. 
Part of the error detection scheme is the acceptance of every message by all nodes 
or no nodes. Even if a component on the network is not concerned with the mes­
sage that is transmitted, it must still receive the message, check the cyclic redun­
dancy check (CRC), and acknowledge (ACK) acceptance. The data frame, shown 
in Figure 6.3, is the most widely used frame. Priority is established in the identifier 
field based on the user’s messaging strategy [10]. 
Data is requested through the use of a remote frame and is transmitted through 
the data frame. The remote frame contains no data field, and the RTR bit is sent 
recessive. Otherwise, the remote frame is identical to the data frame [11]. 
Error detection and error signaling are possible because CAN has a variety of 
built-in error counters that help contain errors and prevent nodes that have failures 
from restricting communications on the bus. A faulty transmitting node always 
increases its error counter more than other nodes. Therefore, the faulty node be­
comes the first to go “bus off.” Automatic retransmission of corrupted messages 
minimizes the possibility of an undetected message. CAN also has the ability to 
distinguish between temporary errors and permanent node failures, which make it 
ideal for high-noise environments that occur in automotive and industrial applica­
tions [10]. The error message frame is shown in Figure 6.4. Bit error, stuff error, 
CRC error, form error, and acknowledge error can be detected. The error frame 
contains the superposition of error flags that are sent by various nodes on the net­
Figure 6.3  CAN data frame.

work and the error delimiter. Both passive and active error codes are possible in 
CAN, depending on the status of the node [11].
The CAN protocol does not address the physical layer requirements. The trans­
ceiver is not specified, but rather is left to the user’s network characteristics to 
define the requirements. (Bit timing rules in the CAN specification must be met). 
Accepted physical media include, but are not limited to: twisted pair (shielded or 
unshielded), single wire, fiber-optic cable, or transformer coupled to power lines. 
RF transmitters are also being developed by some users for CAN systems. Ac­
ceptable transmission rates range from 5 Kbps to 1 Mbps. The most widely used 
implementation to date is a twisted pair bus with NRZ bit formatting. Twisted-pair 
CAN drivers are available that simplify system design [10].
6.4.2  LIN Protocol
The LIN protocol was developed as a low-cost alternative to network connections 
that did not require the performance capabilities of CAN, such as mirrors, door 
locks, and window controls in body electronic systems. The single-wire, master-
slave communication system is based on the common SCI (UART) byte-word inter­
face that is a common peripheral in many MCUs [12]. However, the protocol can 
also be implemented as equivalent in software or a pure state machine for ASICs. 
The master node controls the medium access, avoiding arbitration and collision 
management in the slave nodes. This provides a guarantee of the worst-case latency 
times for signal transmission. With LIN, the maximum transmission speed is 20 
kbps and the network is typically under 12 nodes because of the small number of 
64 identifiers and the relatively low transmission speed. 
6.4.3  Media Oriented Systems Transport
MOST is the de facto standard for multimedia and infotainment networking in the 
automotive industry [13]. The synchronous network uses a ring topology to trans­
mit audio, video, voice, and data signals. Initially developed using plastic optical fi­
ber as the physical layer, MOST25 provides bandwidth of approximately 23 Mbps 
(nominally 25 Mbps) [14]. The use of electrical unshielded twisted pairs was added 
with the MOST50 update, which doubles the bandwidth and increases the frame 
length to 1,024 bits. The 2007 release of MOST150 specification provides a physi­
cal layer to implement Ethernet in automobiles. This increases the frame length up 
to 3072, about six times the bandwidth of the initial MOST25.

6.4.4  FlexRay
Developed by the FlexRay Consortium for fault-tolerant communications in au­
tomotive systems, FlexRay is a deterministic high-speed data bus that addresses 
the requirements of drive-by-wire, steer-by-wire, brake-by-wire, or any x-by-wire 
system. To keep costs down and deliver top performance in a rugged environment, 
FlexRay uses unshielded twisted pair cabling to connect nodes together in simple, 
multidrop, passive connections, or in more complex networks with active star con­
nections [15]. The use of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) synchronizes 
each FlexRay node to the same clock, and each node waits for its turn to write on 
the bus. For systems that depend on up-to-date data between nodes, such as vehicle 
safety systems, FlexRay can guarantee the consistency of data deliver to nodes on 
the network. Operating as a Class C bus in the 1M to 10 Mbps range of real-time 
control, the bus can support one of two channels per node. 
6.4.5  Other Automotive Protocol Aspects
In the 1990s, a consortium of German and French automakers developed an oper­
ating system (OS) standard for automotive electronics. The Open System for Au­
tomotive Electronics (the German acronym is OSEK) OS is an extension of the 
front end of the MCU hardware [16]. It is intended to provide a structured design 
with additional higher software levels encapsulating lower levels in order to reduce 
the software complexity for distributed control systems in vehicles. The OS allows 
standardized software components to be used across multiple platforms in order to 
reduce development cost and time to market. Portions of OSEK are standardized in 
ISO 17356, Road vehicles–Open interface for embedded automotive applications.
OSEK was developed to be independent of the communication protocol; it is 
compatible with the CAN and other automotive protocols shown in Table 6.2. The 
combination of application-specific OS, protocol, and system hardware (including 
smart sensors) will be required to improve the efficiency, meet emissions and safety 
standards and improve the overall driving experience in future vehicles.
The Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSTAR) OS builds upon 
the OSEK OS to provide an even more comprehensive approach to software and 
hardware standardization in vehicle systems. One of its goals is to simplify the ex­
change and update options for software and hardware [17]. Jointly developed by 
automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and tool developers, the global acceptance of 
the standard is viewed as proof of its success. In 2011, the development partner­
ship extended the scope of its applications to enable its members to reuse or adapt 
their AUTOSAR available products outside of the automotive industry. This step 
further increases the standard’s acceptance. With the extensive use of sensors in au­
tomotive systems and the growing complexity of those systems, sensors can benefit 
from AUTOSAR. The standard defines a sensor/actuator software component as a 
special type of AUOTSAR software component that is independent of the ECU on 
which it is mapped, but dependent on the specific sensor and/or actuator for which 
it is designed [18]. This allows the sensor component to provide a software repre­
sentation of the electrical signal present at an input pin of the ECU and to output 
the physical quantity measured by the sensor.

6.5  Industrial Networks
The power of a distributed multiplex system is easily demonstrated in factory auto­
mation. In many cases, users have completed wiring a multiplex system installation 
with one or two people in a single day, a task that previously took a crew of electri­
cal technicians several days to complete. Also, these installations work successfully 
the first time, resulting in a considerable cost reduction. Once a system strategy is 
developed, nodes can be added or moved easily without re-engineering the system. 
These nodes can include sensors, as well as valves, motors, and lighting loads. The 
key is an open standard and plug-and-play capability. However, the industrial mar­
ket has even more proposed and developing standards than the automotive market. 
6.5.1  Example Industrial Protocols
The industrial protocols listed in Table 6.2 offer advantages to distributed control 
systems. A brief summary of the most widely known, frequently mentioned, and 
better-documented protocols will conclude this section. These include the highway 
addressable remote transducer (HART), process field bus (Profibus), and Serial, 
Real-Time Communication System (SERCOS) protocols.
Rosemount developed the HART protocol in the late 1980s. It has a dedicated 
users group (the HART Communication Foundation) with several participating 
companies. The open multiple master protocol is compatible with the 4–20 mA 
current loop and also allows digital communication [19]. 
Profibus is a German Deutsches Industrial Norm (DIN) standard that supports 
up to 1.5 Mbps data rate. The deterministic system uses a master-slave hierarchy 
and has a capacity of 127 nodes. Arbitration is handled by command response. 
EIA-485 is used as the physical layer [20].
The SERCOS network typically consists of eight nodes per ring. It operates at 
a speed of up to 1 Mbps and for a distance of up to 40 meters at this speed. It is 
a deterministic, multimaster network with command response and broadcast for 
arbitration. The physical layer uses fiber optic cables [19].
6.6  Protocols in Other Applications
Table 6.2 shows that applications, such as building and home automation, have had 
several unique different protocols developed for them. An example of the connec­
tivity in a smart home, or Home Area Network (HAN), including fire and smoke 
sensors, moisture sensor, and security sensors, is shown in Figure 6.5. Not shown 
are the motion/occupancy sensors and photoelectric sensors that would indicate the 
need for lighting in the programmable lighting system. Such a system would also 
have thermostats and temperature sensors for heating and air conditioning control. 
These sensors are also an integral part of building automation (smart buildings) for 
increased energy efficiency.
Major projects such as smart grid and smart meter add another dimension to 
networks in homes and buildings. While historically these new applications would 

118 
��������������������������������
Communications for Smart Sensors
have driven new standards from a new organization, there appears to be sufficient 
motivation and capability from existing standards to support these opportunities. 
In some cases, an organization can provide the connectivity without another stan­
dard sponsor entering the picture. The HomePlug Alliance demonstrates this meth­
odology with the introduction of Netricity Powerline Communication (PLC) for 
longer range powerline networking for outside-the-home, smart grid, and indus­
trial applications. HomePlug connected products inside of the HAN create a bridge 
to the smart meter and wide area network of the utility company, through Netricity 
products that complement and coexist with HomePlug specifications [21]. Another 
approach to avoiding new standards occurs when developers take advantage of 
a highly successful bus, such as Ethernet or USB. These protocols have the broad 
understanding and industry support to simplify the extension to a new applica­
tion; they have already demonstrated the cost effectiveness required for many new 
applications.
6.7  Protocols in Silicon
A few of the protocols that have been discussed have been implemented in silicon 
hardware and are available from multiple sources. In some cases, the protocol is 
a stand-alone integrated circuit. However, a protocol integrated into a microcon­
troller provides computing capability and a variety of system features that impact 
the cost-effectiveness of individual system nodes. 
6.7.1  MCU with Integrated CAN
The CAN protocol has been implemented on a variety of microcontrollers by sev­
eral semiconductor manufacturers. The typical integrated CAN solution contains a 
variety of I/O, memory, and other system features. One key point to note about the 
Figure 6.5  Many appliances, sensors and controls are connected in a smart home.

6.7  Protocols in Silicon 
119
CAN protocol is that, although a set of basic features must be implemented in any 
CAN device, a number of extended features may also be implemented in silicon, de­
pending upon the intended target application. The implications must be understood 
when considering interoperability and interchangeability. 
An example of the CAN protocol implemented in a microcontroller is pro­
vided by the Infineon AUDO MAX MCU shown in Figure 6.6. In addition to in­
tegrating four CAN nodes, the MCU includes other automotive protocols, several 
memory modules, and additional peripherals to support automotive powertrain 
applications.

(MultiCAN) nodes and more. (Courtesy of Infineon Technologies [22].)

��������������������������������
Communications for Smart Sensors
6.7.2  LIN Implementation
The LIN protocol has been implemented in several MCUs, but is also available in 
a sensor-specific IC. As shown in Figure 6.7, ZMDI’s ZSSC3170 IC combines a 
conditioning IC with a LIN transceiver in a single chip [23]. Targeting air-condi­
tioning, level measurement, and seat adjustment applications in vehicles with an 
integrated LIN interface, the unit conforms to LIN specification versions 1.3, 2.0, 
and 2.1. With a configurable LIN publisher frame content and a data conversion 
rate of up to 430 Hz, the chip fully utilizes the maximum LIN channel capacity of 
20 kbps. For sensor signal conditioning, the IC is compatible with resistive bridges 
and provides a maximum analog gain of 420 with extended offset compensation 
capabilities. In addition to the LIN output, measured values are also provided in a 
PWM format.
6.7.3  Ethernet Controller
Figure 6.8 provides another example of how a protocol embedded in an integrated 
circuit simplifies its implementation. The Ethernet controller contains an integrated 
media access controller (MAC) and 10 Base-T physical layer (PHY) in a package 
that can be as small as 5 × 5 mm. As part of its support for the controller, the sup­
plier also provides an Ethernet stack that runs on its MCUs at no additional cost. 
In addition to using the chip’s integrated Flash memory as general-purpose, non­
volatile memory, it may be used to store user constants and web server content. The 
last six memory locations are factory preprogrammed with a unique 48-bit MAC 
address. With the controller, Ethernet connectivity can easily be added to any mi­
crocontroller or host processor with 11 or more port I/O pins.
6.8  Transitioning Between Protocols
Because several communication protocols exist, the transition between protocols 
is frequently required. A gateway node provides the transition between networks 
Figure 6.7  A sensor signal conditioning IC with an integrated LIN transceiver includes both an analog front 
end for the sensor’s input and a digital core that provides three output formats including LIN. (Courtesy of 
ZMDI [23].)

6.9  Application Example

that use different protocols. In some cases, custom hardware and software gateways 
convert information from one system’s language to that of the other system. Ideally, 
the MCU in this node has one or both protocols that allow an easy transition. In a 
worst-case scenario, the MCU uses a separate peripheral for each protocol. 
The Profibus protocol is available in RAM microcode in a number of semicon­
ductor devices and provides an example of an integrated implementation. A single-
chip LAN solution has been developed to interface Ethernet and a variety of dif­
ferent sensor networks, including Profibus [25]. As shown in Figure 6.9, network 
nodes can be connected to an Ethernet hub using twisted-pair cables. The MCU in 
this application has a 32-bit CPU that provides 4.5 MIPS at 25 MHz for power and 
flexibility in any existing Ethernet system. Since Ethernet is the leading number of 
installed LANs, interoperability is essential.
6.9  Application Example
The first production use of FlexRay, the deterministic and fault tolerant automotive 
protocol occurred on the 2007 BMW X5 [26]. In the X5, the protocol coordinates 
all functions of the vehicle’s AdaptiveDrive system, which is a combination of active 
roll stabilization and electronic damping control. To do this, the vehicle employs the 
FlexRay communication controller and transceiver.
Freescale Semiconductor’s MFR4200 communication controller (see Figure 
6.10) connects to the unit’s microcontroller and delivers a bit rate up to a maxi­
mum of 10 Mbps on each of two channels, however, only one is used in the Adap­
tiveDrive system. NXP Semiconductors’ TJA1080 FlexRay transceiver (bus driver) 
provides the interface between the protocol controller and the physical bus in the 
network.

the protocol’s capability to support a data rate of up to 10 Mbps, as well as its 
determinism and task synchronization capabilities in a distributed closed-loop con­
trol system. With 5 ms cycle time and 2.5 ms update time for distributed sensor and 
control signals, the network provides damper control for each wheel. 
6.10  Summary
This chapter has discussed communication protocols for sensors. The ability for 
sensors to communicate with other portions of the control system allows more 
intelligence at the sensor node and more distributed control. Protocols that have 
available silicon solutions have a higher likelihood of acceptance. While many types 
of standards have been developed, industry support to implement a specific stan­
dard and implementation options may limit its usefulness, and only the most ac­
cepted protocols withstand the test of time. An entirely new protocol developed for 
sensor-specific applications would have to be well-defined and accepted by sensor 
users to justify the development cost necessary to implement the protocol in silicon.

Control Techniques
A machine is intelligent when it does the things of a common three year old. 
—Marvin Minsky, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence
7.1  Introduction 
Distributed control systems (DCS) have brought decision making to the sensor. 
The built-in intelligence for the smart sensor can take advantage of a variety of 
existing and developing control techniques. The extent to which new computing 
paradigms will affect sensors depends on the need for control at the sensor and the 
cost-effectiveness of using these new techniques. Existing control techniques have 
grown from programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and PC-based instruments. 
Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and the state machine are the basis 
of many control systems. However, artificial intelligence approaches of fuzzy logic 
and neural networks have increasingly impacted sensor-based systems. Fuzzy logic 
has already found several applications in appliances and automobiles. Adaptive 
control techniques using higher-performing MCUs and DSPs allow sensors to ad­
just to aging effects during their operating life. Control strategies that implement 
computationally-intense algorithms are able to shrink a proof-of-concept labora­
tory demonstration into a useful solution that can have popular applications based 
on the increased computing capability of MCUs, DSPs, and FPGAs.  
7.1.1  Programmable Logic Controllers
PLCs are used in industrial applications to control a variety of logic and sequencing 
processes. A typical PLC consists of a central processing unit (CPU), a program­
mable memory, input/output interfaces, and a power supply [1]. Smaller, less expen­
sive PLCs can be used and the response time and interference from noise reduced by 
“combining a sensor and microprocessor into one unit, commonly called a smart 
sensor” [1]. Functions that are performed by smart sensors in this role include cor­
recting for environmental conditions, performing diagnostics functions, and mak­
ing decisions.

Control Techniques
7.1.2  Open- Versus Closed-Loop Systems
The simplest control system is an open-loop system. The sensor input goes to a 
processing unit that produces an output. As shown in Table 7.1, this requires ba­
sic mechanics and physics knowledge, as well as mechanical-to-electrical interface 
knowledge for a simple system, such as a fuel indicator [2]. The table shows the in­
creasing knowledge level required to implement increasingly more complex systems 
with automotive applications as examples.
A closed-loop system can use (1) the sensor to modify the control strategy and 
(2) a control strategy to improve the performance of the sensor [3]. Figure 7.1 com­
pares a capacitive surface-micromachined accelerometer using an open-loop signal-
conditioning circuit and a closed-loop signal conditioning circuit. The closed-loop 
system has advantages over the open-loop system, including improved linearity and 
a wider dynamic range. Table 7.2 is a comparison of several parameters [3].
In general, a single-loop closed-loop system has a comparison node for a set 
point versus an input (the feedback signal) from a sensor regarding the status of 
the process that is being controlled. Based on the comparison, control action is 
taken to increase, reduce, or maintain speed, flow, or some other variable that is 
controlled by a mechanical actuator, such as a valve or motor. The PID control 
algorithm is a common technique in a closed-loop system [4].
7.1.3  PID Control
Most single-loop controllers include at least three principal control actions: propor­
tional, integral (or reset), and derivative (or rate). Each of these actions corresponds 
to a specific technique for controlling the process set point. Proportional adjust­
ments amplify the error by a constant amount relative to the size and sign of the 
deviation. The proportional band has a range of deviations in a percent of full-scale 
that corresponds to the full operating range of the control element [4]. 
Integral control is a function of time, unlike the proportional control that has 
no time associated with it. Integral control responds to the continued existence of 
a deviation, such as an offset. The combination of proportional and integral action

Control Techniques
Derivative control is only used in combination with the proportional or in­
tegral control action. Changes in speed and/or direction of the deviation initi­
ate derivative control action. This action reduces the time that the system would 
otherwise take to reach a new set point determined by the proportional control. 
Controllers with derivative control have rate amplitude and rate time adjustments. 
Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control can be implemented in both analog 
and digital systems [4]. 
The PID control algorithm is defined by

where: T(s) is the desired transfer function, and R(s) and C(s) are Laplace trans­
forms of the reference input r(t) and the controlled output c(t) [5]. 
If C(s) is not measured, the system is open-loop. Otherwise, a measurement of 
C(s) is used to provide closed-loop feedback control. Figure 7.2 shows the location 
of these parameters in the analog control system [5]. For r(t) varying with time, a 
tracking problem must be solved. For r(t) = constant, the problem is one of regu­
lation. Disturbances in the forward transmission path and the feedback path can 
prevent c(t) from ideally following r(t).
The process being controlled typically dictates if only proportional, propor­
tional and integral, or full PID should be implemented. As in most systems, the 
most appropriate solution is the simplest one that will achieve the desired results. 
Control systems based on digital techniques can improve previous analog systems. 
Figure 7.3 shows the simplification that results when a single rotary encoder pro­
vides position, speed, and commutation data in a speed-control system [6]. The 
number of connections to the motor is reduced from 13 to 8. The speed computa­
tion block is used to interpolate the encoder output signal for improved resolution.
7.2  State Machines
The state machine is one of the most commonly implemented functions in program­
mable logic [7]. The state machine is actually a sequencing algorithm. It allows an 
interrupt service routine to execute an algorithm that extends over many interrupts. 
State machines can be open- or closed-loop [8]. State machines are developed from

a state diagram and a state table. The state diagram is determined at the begin­
ning of the design process from a description of the problem. A natural language 
describes the intended circuit function. A key area of interest is the synthesis of the 
state machine—a process that allows rapid and easy development of the circuit 
from a functional description of the state machine. If only a small subset of inputs 
is sensed while the circuit is in any given state, then an algorithmic state machine is 
used in place of a state diagram.
A finite-state machine is a mathematical representation of a digital sequential 
circuit where abstract symbols (not binary codes) represent the states. Finite-state 
machines can be specified in state transition tables or circuits consisting of logic 
gates and flip-flops. These dedicated controllers can be either synchronous or asyn­
chronous, and can be implemented in hardware or software. Figure 7.4 shows an 
embedded finite-state machine used in a three-axis MEMS accelerometer. The pro­
grammable blocks enable custom motion recognition inside of the sensor, allowing 
gestures to initiate specific functions, such as launching an application.
7.3  Fuzzy Logic 
Fuzzy logic control theory is an alternative to look-up tables and algorithm calcula­
tions; it is easier to develop and has performance advantages in many applications. 
Fuzzy logic can be defined as a branch of logic that uses degrees of membership in 
Figure 7.3  Analog versus digital speed control (After: [6].)

sets, rather than a strict true/false membership [10]. Fuzzy logic is defined as finding 
acceptance in consumer, automotive, industrial, and even decision-making applica­
tions [11]. Table 7.3 provides examples of existing applications.
In contrast to PID control that models the system or process being controlled, 
fuzzy logic focuses on the human operator’s behavior [12]. Fuzzy logic defines a 
partial, and not a strict, set of membership normally associated with the Boolean 
logic that is used in MCUs and DSPs. Rules stated in natural language establish 
membership to the fuzzy sets. 
Figure 7.5 shows an example of fuzzy logic membership for a pressure (or vac­
uum) input. The fuzzy set allows membership with different grades, each expressed 
by a number in the interval [0, 1]. In this example, membership functions and rules 
are established for the five pressure ranges of very low, low, normal, high, and very 
high. The membership value for intermediate locations is some number between 0 
and 1. A rule for the very high pressure could be: if the pressure is very high, then 
decrease the power greatly with a weight of 0.7 assigned for greatly. For low pres­
sure, the rule could be: if the pressure is low, then increase the power slightly with 
a weight of 0.3 assigned for slightly.
The final part of the fuzzy logic process is defuzzification. The defuzzification 
process takes a weighted average to translate the fuzzy outputs into a single crisp

value. Output membership functions are typically defined by singletons. A single­
ton in an 8-bit system is defined by an 8-bit value that represents the output value 
corresponding to the linguistic label of the output system.
To simplify the implementation of fuzzy logic on existing microcontrollers, a 
fuzzy kernel can be developed by the MCU manufacturer [13]. A fuzzy kernel, or 
engine, is software that performs the three basic steps of fuzzy logic: fuzzification, 
rule evaluation, and defuzzification. As shown in Figure 7.6, the fuzzy inference 
unit (FIU) receives system inputs and information from the knowledge base for 
each step of the process. All application-specific information is contained in the 
knowledge base that is developed independently from the fuzzy inference program. 
With fuzzy logic, applications that were once thought to be too complex to be 
practical are being easily controlled. Furthermore, the rules in a fuzzy system often 
hold true even if the operating parameters of that system change. This is typically 
not true in conventional control systems.

Control Techniques
In general, fuzzy logic does not require special hardware. The software require­
ments can be low, based on a limited number of rules to describe the system. For 
most control tasks, software running on standard processors can perform fuzzy 
logical operations. Specialized hardware does simplify code development and boost 
computational performance for low-cost applications. Fuzzy logic allows 8-bit 
MCUs to perform tasks that may have otherwise required a more powerful MCU, 
such as a RISC processor.
Fuzzy logic has been used with multiple sensors to produce a mobile security 
robot for evaluating the environment in an art gallery [14]. As shown in Figure 
7.7, the fuzzy logic certainty engine in the robot weighs multiple variables, creates 
a composite picture from data supplied by the sensors, and performs real-time 
threat identification and assessment. The robot is able to analyze data based on 
location, the time of day, historical trends, and external conditions. A wide range 
of safety threats detrimental to art objects has been identified by the robot during 
a 36-month evaluation. Air quality assessment for conditions harmful to humans is 
an obvious extension of this technology.
7.4  Neural Networks
Unlike fuzzy logic, neural networks allow the system to define the rules instead of 
an expert. By definition, a neural network is a collection of independent process­
ing nodes that solves problems by communicating with one another in a manner 
roughly analogous to neurons within the human brain [12]. Neural networks are 
useful in systems that are difficult to define. They have an additional advantage of 
being able to operate in a high-noise environment. Complex or numerous input pat­
terns are among the problems that neural networks are addressing [15]. 
The structure of a neuron is shown in Figure 7.8(a) [15]. The neuron learns 
from a set of training data. Each input to the neuron is multiplied by the synapse 
Figure 7.7  A variety of sensors provide input to the fuzzy logic certainty engine of a mobile robot. 
(After: [14].)

7.4  Neural Networks 
133
weight. The neuron sums the results of all the weighted inputs and processes the 
results with a typically nonlinear transfer function to determine the output. A local 
memory stores previous computations and modifies the weights as it learns. 
A neural network consists of a number of neurons connected in some manner 
as indicated in Figure 7.7(b). In that model, a hidden layer exists that prevents di­
rect interaction between the input and the output. However, the hidden layer is not 
required and more than one may exist. Also, the number of neurons does not have 
to be the same in each layer. To train or condition the neuron for proper response, 
several sets of inputs with known results are applied to the neural network. The 
output is compared for each set of inputs to the known results, and the weights are 
adjusted to compensate for errors.
Figure 7.8   (a) Neuron and (b) neural network (After: [15]).

134 
������������������
Control Techniques
An example of a potential application for a neural network is the control of an 
automotive fuel injection system [16]. Vehicle engine control systems initially used 
calibration and look-up tables meet emissions regulations. However, increasingly 
stricter emission regulations with further reductions of hydrocarbons (HC), oxides 
of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions may require the function-
approximation, learning, and adaptive capabilities of neural networks. By using 
a neural network control, a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (A/F) can be maintained 
over the life of the vehicle even if the engine dynamics change. Experimental results 
with a neural network and a linear A/F sensor have demonstrated the capability to 
control stoichiometry within a ±1%, which was better than the production control 
unit.
7.5  Combined Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks
Fuzzy logic and neural networks are being combined to utilize the best features of 
each technology. One approach begins with a set of fuzzy rules that have been well-
tuned by an expert using trial-and-error methods. A neural-like adaptive mecha­
nism is then installed in the fuzzy system to handle exceptional circumstances after 
the system is in use. These systems compensate for load variables and for the wear 
and tear that occurs over time [17]. 
In an alternate approach, the fuzzy system is coarsely defined by experts. The 
fuzzy rule base is then refined with a neural network. The neural network adapts 
to minimize errors.
Another approach combines fuzzy associative memories with neural networks. 
In general, an associative memory is a neural architecture used in pattern recogni­
tion applications. The network associates data patterns with specific classes or cat­
egories that it has learned. This combination produces a system in which the neural 
network front-end learns rules from training data and then supplies those rules to 
a fuzzy logic back-end to execute the rules [17].
The previous examples started with a fuzzy system and applied neural network 
learning. Other researchers have started with neural networks and applied fuzzy 
logic. In these systems, the network adapts in a more intelligent manner. The ulti­
mate technology in this area could be evolutive learning—the application of genetic 
algorithms to combine fuzzy and neural systems automatically. Genetic algorithms 
are guided stochastic search techniques that utilize the basic principles of natural 
selection to optimize a given function [18]. These advanced control concepts are 
being explored for process optimization in manufacturing complex ICs.
7.6  Adaptive Control
Adaptive control is a system of advanced process control techniques that is capable 
of automatically adjusting or adapting to meet a desired output, despite shifting 
control objectives and process conditions or unmodeled uncertainties in process dy­
namics [18]. Because of their capacity to learn, neural networks have the capability 
to provide adaptive control, but they are not the only means. As shown in Figure 
7.9, the difference between the desired performance and the measured performance 

7.6  Adaptive Control 
135
in the control system is the starting point for the adaptive process [19]. The adap­
tive system modifies the parameters of the adaptive controller in order to maintain 
the performance rating close to the desired value. 
All adaptive-control systems have a conventional servo-type feedback loop and 
an additional loop that is designed to identify the online process and determine the 
parameters to be adjusted on the basis of the process parameters. The addition of 
an identification algorithm and an outer control loop maintains performance in the 
presence of disturbances. An indirect adaptive scheme has an additional outer loop 
to perform system identification, and it provides access to process parameters for 
monitoring and diagnostics [19].
Adaptive control can be obtained in fuzzy logic systems by using a controller 
that operates at a higher level to perform tuning and adaptive-control functions 
[20]. The architecture for this approach is compared to a low-level, direct, closed-
loop system in Figure 7.10. Adjustments that the fuzzy logic controller performs 
include online and offline tuning of the controller parameters, online adaptation 
of the low-level controller, and self-organization and dynamic restructuring of the 
control system.
7.6.1  Observers for Sensing
Observers, or algorithms that correct for variations from physical models, are in­
creasingly being used in more complex systems, such as motor controls and auto­
motive engine controls. A discrete time domain representation of an observer in 
a motor control system is shown in Figure 7.11 [21]. In this example, the intent 
is to compute the best-estimated value for velocity from the measured position 
of the rotor. In Figure 7.11, u is the input voltage; A is a matrix representing the 
motor’s dynamics; B is the input vector; D is a vector that shows which one of the 
system variables is the output (position), X is the state-variable vector that includes 
two components: position and velocity, Z is the delay operator, and H is the ob­
server vector. The lower portion of Figure 7.11 shows the block diagram of the 
actual motor and the upper portion contains the observer algorithm that is in the 
software [21].
Figure 7.9  Adaptive control system.

Control Techniques
The observer estimates both velocity and position. A comparison of the esti­
mated position with the measured position is used to correct for the next sampling 
period.  Estimation error is used to achieve a better estimate for the next sampling 
interval. The observer gain vector H is used to modify the observer dynamics.
Feedforward techniques use sensors to modify the estimated values for system 
inputs that are in the observer model [22]. The growing complexity of automotive

engine controls to meet increasingly stringent emissions targets may require sys­
tems that anticipate, act, and then adjust algorithms based on measurements on a 
cylinder-by-cylinder basis. Model-based methods can also reduce the calibration 
effort that takes considerable time and effort for each internal combustion engine 
that a manufacturer produces. Sensor-based intelligent decision-making has also 
been investigated as a possible solution in computer-based untended machining 
[23]. These and other techniques that expand the capability of neural networks rely 
heavily on sensor-system synergy.
7.7  Other Control Areas
Computationally intense models such as hidden Markov modeling (HMM) used 
in automatic speech recognition will be used more frequently as available com­
puting power increases [24]. Higher performance for real-time control is achieved 
in digital signal processors (DSP) and multiprocessor systems. For example, auto­
matic speech recognition (ASR) has been implemented in ROM on a DSP chip. The 
HMM technique treats speech as a stochastic process for matching the input to a 
word command. In these systems, sensor input from a microphone directly affects 
the signal-to-noise ratio of the input. Limited bandwidth and high noise systems 
such as telephone lines still cause problems for some existing speech recognition 
systems. However, continuing improvements in algorithms and the computational 
engine are improving the process.
Multiprocessor computing and multicore processors are used today for con­
trolling industrial robotics. These powerful processors support the implementation 
of machine vision, speech recognition, and optical character recognition. Tech­
niques used in multiprocessing include common Fourier transform, convolution, 
linear prediction, dynamic time warping, template matching, and spectral process­
ing [25]. 
The discrete Fourier transform is used to determine the frequency components 
of a time series. Multiplying a matrix of cosine and sine functions with the time-se­
ries vector yields the frequency-series vector. By computing a 64-element time series 
vector concurrently on 64 processors (one component per processor), processing 
time was reduced to 1/64 of the uniprocessor’s time.
Convolution is used for filtering a time series. It requires calculating the in­
ner products of time-series sections with a coefficient vector that defines the filter 
characteristics. By using a 16-element convolution kernel, or software function, 
and distributing the elements in a 128 processor with only one broadcast of the 
time-series vector, the computation was performed 128 times faster.
Linear prediction is used to obtain smoothed, compact spectral representations 
of a signal. It requires calculating the autocorrelation function for the time signal. 
This is identical to convolution calculation, with the convolution kernel replaced 
by a section of the time series for autocorrelation. By processing one coefficient 
per processor, the autocorrelation function is calculated N-times faster, where N is 
the number of autocorrelation coefficients computed. Linear predictive coding is 
frequently used for speech recognition.
Dynamic time warping calculates the similarity between two signals that have 
differing nonlinear time-alignment patterns. The computation determines the 

138 
������������������
Control Techniques
optimum path through a matrix of distances formed from the squared Euclidean 
distances between discrete sample sections of the signals. Multiple paths are ex­
plored based on the selected algorithm, and the minimum total distance defines the 
similarity and best alignment path. Template matching in linear-vector quantiza­
tion classifier requires a similar calculation of the Euclidean distance between an 
unknown vector of features and a lexicon of templates. Time warping is another 
approach for speech recognition.
Spectral processing involves a sequence of computations. The computations 
include a weight vector, Fourier transform, conversion from real to imaginary com­
ponents to power, and conversion from power to decibels. The final calculation of 
the power components of the frequency spectrum is converted to decibels using a 
standard linear-to-logarithmic library function. This amount of processing is in­
dicative of speech and image recognition. 
Associative memory is used in pattern recognition applications, in which the 
network is used to associate data patterns with specific classes or categories it has 
already learned [18].
The control areas discussed in this section are aimed at some of the high-end 
computing requirements in sensory systems. As shown in Table 7.4, these technolo­
gies are essential for many smart-sensing applications. More than one approach 
can be used to implement a solution for these complex systems.
7.7.1  RISC Versus CISC
The Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) architecture is the established ap­
proach for desktop computing and embedded control applications. An embedded 
system has one or more computational devices (which may be microprocessors 
or microcontrollers) that are nor directly accessible to the user of the system.  A 
relatively new addition for computing requirements is the Reduced Instruction Set 
Computer (RISC) architecture. Computer and workstation manufacturers that are 
seeking the highest performance levels are using RISC architecture. Embedded com­
puting applications are also utilizing the performance that this approach provides.

CISC-based architectures allocate transistors to decreasing the denominator 
of (7.2) [26]. However, based on recent improvements in price-performance of 
semiconductor memory and significant advances in compiler technology, transis­
tors can be reallocated to increasing the numerator. This is the basis of the RISC 
architecture that frees up transistors for integrating additional components. The 
additional components can be peripherals or microcoded kernels that improve the 
performance in a specific application.
Two approaches, CISC and RISC, are now available to solve a variety of ap­
plication problems in several markets. Because no single computing solution is 
correct for all applications, designers must choose the approach that satisfies their 
design criteria. For a given application there is a best fit solution and more than one 
feasible solution. CISC-based designs will continue to satisfy a significant number 
of applications, especially in embedded control. However, RISC has established its 
presence in a range of commercial computing environments, as well as embedded 
applications. RISC architecture in an embedded environment does not take advan­
tage of the 64-bit bus, zero wait state memory, or the amount of memory that is 
integrated on one desktop MPU chip. To be affordable, the RISC performance is 
compromised, but it is still beyond the capabilities of today’s CISC MCU. 
CISC microcontrollers range from simple 4-bit units and the most popular 8-bit 
units up to 32-bit units. The lower cost versions are easily combined with single 
sensors (such as a pressure, flow, or acceleration sensor) to provide a smart sensor. 
The high performance 32-bit CISC and RISC units are allowing complex strategies 
and diagnostics in automotive engine and powertrain control systems. They also 
are required for more complex sensing in imaging and navigation systems.
7.8  Impact of Artificial Intelligence
Fuzzy logic and neural networks will undoubtedly continue to affect not only the 
control systems, but also the sensors that are used in these systems. One analysis 
shown in Figure 7.12 suggests that artificial intelligence will require sensors with 
lower accuracy and, subsequently, will cost less [27]. At the same time, the number 
of sensor applications will increase as a result of artificial intelligence (and the lower 
cost). Artificial intelligence includes the newer control techniques, such as fuzzy 
logic and neural networks. 
The control decisions made in fuzzy logic systems can be made in spite of 
absolute accuracy from the sensory data [28]. As a result, performance specifica­
tions will change from point-to-point to domain-type specifications. Domain-type 
specifications will allow the sensor to function with wider tolerance in terms of 
repeatability, accuracy drift, and linearity. A natural extension of the fuzzy logic 
rules to the sensor has the sensor expressing the measurement in terms of grade of 

140 
������������������
Control Techniques
membership to the predefined domain. These principles have already been applied 
to color, proximity, fluid control, and position sensors.
An extensive analysis of classic control theory, fuzzy logic, neural networks, 
and rough set theory has been performed for smart sensors [29]. The authors have 
defined an operator’s inference model that allows the evaluation of the situation, 
the assignment of the situation to a characteristic state, and the selection and ex­
ecution of the proper characteristic control. The model has been used to evaluate 
smart sensors and control system design. The rough set in this analysis is similar to 
fuzzy logic, except that a rough A/D converter replaces the fuzzifier in the control­
ler, and a rough D/A converter replaces the defuzzifier. The inference engine in the 
controller evaluates the decision table for the rough set. The decision tables used to 
derive the rules in the rough controller are simple to understand and easy to edit.
As part of their findings, the authors determined that classic control theory, a 
mature technology with widely supported hardware, can accomplish more com­
plex computing by increasing the millions of instructions per second (MIPS). Fuzzy 
logic has commercial developments available that are making its acceptance wide­
spread, but it does have safety and reliability disadvantages. The rough set can be 
used for pattern matching and is fast and low-cost; however, it has stability and 
completeness concerns that are similar to fuzzy logic and neural networks. Neural 
networks can possibly provide an all-analog system that is easily integrated with 
sensors, but they have an added problem of an unknown decision basis. However, 
attention to the areas of concern is allowing all of these systems to be evaluated for 
new applications. The combination of these control techniques with sensors will 
achieve new levels of smart sensing.
Among the challenges that have been identified for controls systems are [30]:
••
Control of systems with both symbolic and continuous dynamics;
Figure 7.12  Impact of artificial intelligence on sensors (After: [27].)

7.9  Application Example 
141
••
Control in distributed, asynchronous, and networked environments;
••
High level coordination and autonomy;
••
Automatic synthesis of control algorithms, with integrated verification and 
validation;
••
Building very reliable systems from unreliable parts.
In addition to fuzzy logic and neural networks, other artificial intelligence con­
cepts include knowledge acquisition and representation, logical reasoning, multi­
sensor integration, Dempster-Shafer’s theory of evidential reasoning, and real-time 
expert systems. The combination of these approaches and other control techniques 
is being pursued to solve the listed and other control system challenges, and con­
tinues to enhance the sensing capability of advanced control systems. Chapter 14 
investigates sensor fusion, another control technique that has expanded greatly 
from military to automotive and consumer applications.
7.9  Application Example
Autonomous robots that perform preprogrammed functions and respond to 
changes in their operating environment without operator intervention require an 
extensive amount of sensing and control. To spur the development of autonomous 
vehicles, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) established the DARPA Urban Challenge, with an award of two 
million dollars for the team that could successfully complete navigating a 55-mile 
course with a driverless vehicle. In 2007, six vehicles completed the course, and the 
grand prize was awarded to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
Developed by the Tartan Racing team, CMU’s vehicle, called Boss, is shown 
in Figure 7.13 [31]. The sensors including more than dozen lasers, cameras, and 
radars are quite visible. The sensors are the inputs to computers with over 500,000 
lines of code that provide the perception, planning, and behavioral software needed 
to make decisions regarding the vehicle’s operation in static and dynamic traffic 
situations. Tasks that the vehicle had to address include [32]:
••
Follow rules of the road;
••
Detect and track other vehicles at long ranges;
••
Find a spot and park in a parking lot;
••
Obey intersection precedence rules;
••
Follow vehicles at a safe distance;
••
React to dynamic conditions like blocked roads or broken-down vehicles.
To handle the urban driving situations, the team used a control architecture 
with five major building blocks as shown in Figure 7.14 [31]. The blocks consisted 
of:
••
Mission planning, which computed the cost (as a function of time and risk) 
of all possible routes;

142 
������������������
Control Techniques
••
Behavior generation that formulated a problem definition;
••
 Motion planning that consisted of several motion planners that were capable 
of avoiding static and dynamic obstacles to achieve a desired vehicle state;
••
Perception and world modeling interpreted the information from various 
sensors, as well as the road/route network definition file (RNDF) and mis­
sion data file (MDF), and fused the data streams together in order to provide 
a composite picture of the world to the system;
••
Mechatronics electrical and mechanical components (including the sensors, 
radar, lidar, and Vehicle Controller for drive-by-wire (DbW))  provided a 
means for algorithms to interact with the world.
The three layers of continuous and sequential planning in the software archi­
tecture, Mission planning, Behavior generation, and Motion planning made deci­
sions based on the best information available from the Perception subsystem. The 
Mission planner determined the best path from each waypoint to the next check­
point. After the Behavior generation subsystem initiated inter-lane, inter-road, and 
parking-lot maneuvers, the Motion Planner executed them and initiated intra-lane 
maneuvers, such as in-lane obstacle avoidance.
7.10  Summary
This chapter discussed control techniques and significantly improved computing 
capabilities. Fuzzy logic has found broad acceptance in many control applica­
tions. More complex systems will benefit from fuzzy logic and other advanced 
approaches, such as model-based algorithms. Some of these systems will use more

feedback and consequently more sensors. However, the sensors, at least in some 
instances, may not have to be as accurate and therefore could offset at least some 
of the added cost of getting smarter. With autonomous control, sensors and control 
combine to provide preprogrammed responses to anticipated static and dynamic 
situations challenging the limits of machine intelligence.

Wireless Sensing
A third layer of information acquisition and processing devices commonly called 
the sensory swarm is emerging, enabled by even more pervasive wireless network­
ing and the introduction of novel ultra-low power technologies.
—Jan M. Rabaey [1]
8.1  Introduction 
One of the more monumental changes that accelerated in the twenty-first century 
that affects sensing is the desire for portable, wireless products. The number of 
sensed parameters and the ease of obtaining measurements will increase based on 
remote, wireless sensing.  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with distributed remote 
measurements require the combination of a sensor or sensors, the digital technolo­
gies (discussed in Chapter 5), and radio frequency (RF) semiconductors, including 
radio frequency ICs, or RFICs, and an energy source. This technology block is 
defined as a node. In some instances, RF technology performs the sensing function. 
The use of RF technology in remote sensing has historically been associated 
with the geophysical analysis of parameters, such as air and surface temperature, 
wind velocity, and precipitation rate. This information is necessary to predict 
weather, and is typically gathered from equipment mounted on an aircraft, satellite, 
or weather balloon. These applications of RF continue to grow; however, newer 
commercial applications that are portable and have much lower cost objectives will 
be the focus of this chapter.
Portable wireless products require low power consumption to increase their 
useful life before requiring battery replacement. For these types of measurements, 
high impedance sensors, sleep mode, and smart techniques, such as the pulse width 
modulation (PWM) technique that was discussed in Chapter 5, are required. De­
pending on the type of measurement (static or dynamic) and how frequently it must 
be made, periodic readings can be transmitted to distant recording instruments in 
process controls, hazardous material monitoring systems, and a variety of mobile 
data acquisition applications. These readings would have been more time-consum­
ing, dangerous, prohibitively expensive, or difficult with the previously available 
technology. Perhaps the most compelling reasons for wireless instead of wired sens­
ing are the ease of installation and cost avoidance from not having to install wires.

This chapter will bring out other advantages as well as the importance of several 
wireless sensing techniques.
8.1.1  The RF Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum that is available for wireless communications in the 
United States is frequently update-based legislation. The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) regulation Title 47 has parts 1 to 100, where part15 covers un­
licensed security systems, keyless entry, remote control, and RF local area networks. 
Table 8.1 identifies key frequency ranges that are the focus of several industries. 
The industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands are used for several applications. 
Integration is the key to higher performance, smaller packages, and lower cost in 
the RF arena, as well as previously discussed systems, with several semiconductor 
technologies used in various frequency ranges.

8.1  Introduction  
149
8.1.2  Spread Spectrum
Spread spectrum is one of the secure methods of transmitting information via radio 
signals that expanded from military use to commercial use. The spread spectrum 
signal is a much lower magnitude, but is generated by a much broader frequency 
range (26 MHz), compared to a narrow-band signal of less than 25 kHz, as shown 
in Figure 8.1. Narrowband transceivers (combined transmitter and receiver) are 
highly susceptible to interference by frequency sources near their carrier frequen­
cies. Because they operate within the audio range, the equipment being monitored 
frequently generates the interference [2]. 
Spread spectrum offers improved interference immunity, low interference gen­
eration, high data rates, and nonlicensed operation at practical power limits [3]. 
To conform to FCC guidelines, the total transmitted power must be at 1 watt 
maximum, and the spectral density (the power at any specific frequency) must be 
no greater than 8 decibels (dB) in a 3-kHz bandwidth. Two techniques are used to 
distribute the conventional narrowband signal into a spread spectrum equivalent: 
direct sequencing and frequency hopping.
Direct sequence is a spread spectrum approach that creates an instantaneous 
RF signal that consists of many frequencies spread over a portion of the frequen­
cy spectrum. The information signal, which is usually digital, is combined with a 
much faster stream of pseudorandom binary code that is repeated continuously. 
This technique is difficult to detect, and recapturing the information requires du­
plicating the spreading code at the receiver end.
Another spread spectrum approach is frequency hopping. Both the base and the 
subscriber, or handset and base, hop from frequency to frequency in a simultane­
ous fashion [4]. The theory states that noise tends to occur at different frequencies 
at different times. Therefore, even though a part of the transmission may be lost 
due to interference, enough of the message will be received by hopping through the 
interference to create a noticeably better output when compared to fixed frequency

systems. A variety of applications and their frequencies are shown in Table 8.1. The 
1.8- to 2.4-GHz band is also open for data collection in Europe, which represents 
a large market for RF data. 
Time hopping (TH), where the transmitted signal has intermittent start and 
stop times, is frequently added to the spread spectrum techniques. However, it is 
usually not considered a true spread spectrum technique. In addition, hybrids of 
direct sequence, frequency hopping, and time hopping are also used.
Spread spectrum’s ability to put a greater number of carriers in a specific band­
width and increase the security of the transmitted data is enabling several new 
wireless applications for sensing. Spread spectrum techniques combined with new 
frequency ranges in the unlicensed ISM bands have made new applications both 
possible and easy to implement. In addition to communication, commercial ap­
plications of spread spectrum include wireless LANs, security systems, instrument 
monitoring, factory automation, remote bar code reading, automatic vehicle loca­
tion, pollution monitoring, medical applications, and remote sensing of seismic and 
atmospheric parameters.
8.2  Wireless Data and Communications 
Error-free wireless data is possible due to digital data transmission. A number of 
protocols are vying for acceptance in RF signal transmission. Existing access meth­
ods include time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple ac­
cess (FDMA), and the newest code division multiple access (CDMA). Users are 
assigned a time slot, a frequency, or a code that allows multiple users to share the 
available frequency spectrum. CDMA provides an additional dimension and op­
tion that allows more efficient utilization of the available spectrum, and therefore, 
greater capacity (up to 20 times greater) with a given bandwidth [5]. This means 
that an increased number of users can access the system and maintain the level of 
service (access, data rate, bit error rate (BER), etc.) with only a slight degradation 
in process gain. The discontinuous nature of human speech is the key to one aspect 
of CDMA technology. Only one-third of the air time is used for speech; the rest is 
spent on pauses between words, syllables, thoughts, and listening. CDMA uses a 
variable-rate voice encoder (vocoder) that performs a speech-encoding algorithm to 
transmit speech at the minimum data rate needed. Encoding rate is from 1–8 kbps, 
depending on speech activity.
Several techniques that include frequency shift keying (FSK), amplitude shift 
keying (ASK), on-off keying (OOK), differential phase shift keying (DPSK), quadra­
ture phase shift keying (QPSK), binary phase shift keying (BPSK), and Gaussian 
minimum shift keying (GMSK) are used to modulate the signal transmission. An­
other approach, offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK), uses a maximum 
phase transition of 90 degrees and requires slightly less transmission power than 
the traditional QPSK modulations scheme. Techniques previously used for military 
and satellite communications, such as differential quadrature shift keying (DQSK) 
and GMSK, maximize the information density in a spectral bandwidth. The choice 
depends on cost and performance objectives within the system.  

8.3  Wireless Sensing Networks

8.3  Wireless Sensing Networks 
Introduced in 1999 by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), Bluetooth 1.0 
provided the initial short-range standard for transferring data in wireless computer 
and cell phone applications. The technology has a 1 Mbps data rate and a range of 
about 10m. Bluetooth Smart devices with low power consumption (using a single-
mode low energy radio) and interconnecting communication capability are built to 
Bluetooth v4.0 specifications. With v4.0 products, the average power consumption 
is about 1 μA, maximum/peak power consumption is less than 15 mA [6], and the 
range increases to as much as 300 meters.
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) use IEEE 802.11 a/b or g, and operate 
over 1,000 to 3,000 feet range at frequencies of 2.4 or 5 GHz. WiMax uses IEEE 
802.11n for 3.6 GHz operation. With cellular networks, operation can span the 
globe for communicating sensor data, as well as voice communications.  However, 
several new wireless approaches have been developed specifically for wireless sen­
sors networks.
A typical WSN consists of several distributed sensors monitoring various pa­
rameters. Unlike the wired networks discussed in Chapter 4, many wireless net­
works take advantage of mesh technology. A mesh network has self-healing and 
self-organizing properties to handle the loss of signal or weak signal in a distributed 
WSN. As shown in Figure 8.2, a mesh network node not only transmits and re­
ceives its own data; it also can relay data packets to and from nodes that may have 
a reduced signal due to proximity or other restrictions to the master or gateway 
node [7]. A reduced function device (RFD) takes advantage of full function device 
(FFD) to communicate with the coordinator.

����������������
Wireless Sensing
Experts at market research firm IDTechEx predict that the market for wire­
less mesh networks will grow rapidly from $0.58 billion in 2012 to $2.4 billion in 
2022 [8]. The market for WSNs in general is far larger, with proposed standards 
applying to both areas. This growth is part of the Intent of Things, with wireless 
technology playing an essential role in the connectivity process.
The completion of the IEEE 802.15.4 personal-area network (PAN) radio 
standard in 2003 opened the floodgates for WSNs. The standard provides layer 1 
(physical layer, or PHY) and layer 2 (media access controller, or MAC) of the net­
work and is the underlying radio protocol for many wireless networks.
8.3.1  ZigBee
ZigBee was the first wireless standard to take advantage of the IEEE 802.15.4 radio 
protocol. Targeting longer battery life and lower cost than Bluetooth technology, 
ZigBee’s intent is battery life of months, or even years, on a single battery charge for 
wireless sensing and control applications. A ZigBee network relies on mesh technol­
ogy to provide redundancy required for unattended system operation and reliable 
signal transmission. Figure 8.2 shows a ZigBee wireless network. Logical device 
types include coordinator, router, and end devices.
Operating in the unlicensed ISM bands, the most popular ZigBee configura­
tion is in the 2.4-GHz band, where the standard defines sixteen 5-MHz channels. 
Maximum data rate is 250 kbps using OQPSK modulation [9]. Optional specifica­
tions provide for operation at 915 MHz (in the United States), with 40 kbps using 
BPSK modulation. A European version uses 868 MHz with 20 kbps. ZigBee’s typi­
cal power of 1 mW or 0 dBm provides a range from 10 to 100 meters. In addition 
to Bluetooth and ZigBee, several other standards, as well as numerous proprietary 
techniques, have been developed for transmitting wireless data. Table 8.2 shows a 
comparison of the properties of some of the most common standards. 
8.3.2  ZigBee-Like Wireless
Variations of ZigBee, for proprietary and non-standardized WSNs, have been de­
veloped to achieve even lower power consumption and/or other benefits that the 
compromises necessary for establishing a standard did not allow. In many instances, 
the IEEE 802.15.4 standard was used for the radio portion. In fact, many suppliers 
of ZigBee ICs have a proprietary version a well. For example, Microchip Technol­
ogy has MiWiTM Mesh and MiWi P2P proprietary protocols. MiWi Mesh is a sim­
ple protocol designed for low data rate, short distance, low-cost networks [11]. The 
protocol allows a maximum of 1024 nodes on a network. Each coordinator can 
have only 127 children, with a maximum of eight coordinators in a network. Pack­
ets can travel a maximum of four hops in the network. These ZigBee-like variations 
continue to proliferate as customers pressure suppliers to meet the requirements of 
their specific applications.
8.3.3  ANT+
Developed for low-data rate WSN applications, and supported by the ANT+ Alli­
ance, ANT+ is a proprietary technology that operates at 2.4 GHz [12]. It is designed 

8.3  Wireless Sensing Networks  
153
to run by using low-cost, low-power microcontrollers and transceivers. Using star 
or mesh network topologies, ANT+ has found several applications in sports, fitness, 
wellness, and home health applications. The protocol also has potential in LANs 
for home and industrial automation applications.
8.3.4  6LoWPAN
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) released an International Open Stan­
dard  IPv6 over Low-power wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) that 
brings together IEEE 802.15.4 and Internet Protocol to sensors and controllers 
among other applications. This specification provides an alternative to ZigBee, 
while using the same underlying radio protocol.
8.3.5  Near Field Communication (NFC)
 One of the underlying technologies behind many mobile payment solutions using 
smart phones and other similar devices is near-field communication (NFC). NFC 
is based on existing RFID standards. The technology facilitates the fast and simple 
setup of wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and more.
8.3.6  Z-Wave
Z-Wave is another proprietary network that competes with ZigBee in the home 
area network (HAN). Operating at 908.42 MHz in the United States and Canada

and other frequencies based on country regulations, the mesh network can have up 
to 232 nodes. It uses GFSK modulation and delivers data rates of 9600 bps and 40 
kbps. Output power is 1 mW or 0 dBm. Transmission range can reach 30 meters 
in free space [9]. 
 8.3.7  Dust Networks
Initially described as smart dust in the late 1990s, Dust Networks’ calls the self-
forming nodes in its SmartMesh network motes. In the network, the motes collect 
and relay data, and a network manager monitors and manages network perfor­
mance and sends data to the host application. Ultra-low power consumption of 
the company’s IEEE 802.15.4 (2.4 GHz) SoCs, less than 5 mA for reception and 
less than 6 mA for transmission, is attributed to its Eterna technology [13]. The 
chip’s SmartMesh IP is based on 6LoWPAN and 802.15.4e standards. Additional 
applications/standards addressed by the design approach include SmartMesh Wire­
lessHART (see Section 8.4), other industrial applications, and ZigBee solutions. 
8.3.8  Other RF Wireless Solutions
Additional RF wireless sensing options include: 
••
Open Source IPv6 Automation Network (OSIAN);
••
MyriaNed, biology-inspired, low-power wireless technology developed by 
DevLab;
••
INSTEON, a dual-mesh network technology developed by SmartLabs;
••
ONE-NET, an open source standard for wireless networking in home 
automation; 
••
EnOcean, low power, proprietary wireless technology.
As this list demonstrates, there appears to be no shortage of wireless solutions 
that could connect sensors in a variety of applications. The challenge for users is 
determining which wireless solution will meet the application requirements and 
survive the competitive environment for the lifetime of the application.
8.3.9  Optical Signal Transmission
The infrared (IR) spectrum is also used for transmitting data. It is low cost for cost-
sensitive applications and does not require licensing. However, it is limited to line-
of-sight (LOS) transmission and cannot penetrate solid objects. The IR spectrum 
(indicated in Table 8.1) is from 0.7 µm to 0.1 cm.
8.4  Industrial Wireless Sensing Networks
For industrial applications, two WSNs have emerged as leading solutions. In Sep­
tember 2007, the HART Communication Foundation (HCF) announced the official 
release of the HART 7 Specification. This specification contains WirelessHART, 

8.5  RF Sensing 
155
which takes advantage of IEEE 802.15.4 radio and frequency hopping, spread 
spectrum, and mesh networking technologies. In 2010, the International Electro­
technical Commission (IEC) approved the WirelessHART specification as a full 
international standard (IEC 62591Ed. 1.0) for process automation [14].
The Instrument Society of America (ISA), with support from hundreds of end 
users and suppliers, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy, developed ISA-
100.11a, Wireless Systems for Industrial Automation: Process Control and Re­
lated Applications. In September 2009, the standard was approved by ISA [15]. 
ISA-100.11a is a mesh network with frequency hopping that also takes advantage 
of IEEE 802.15.4 radio, provides high security and reliable message delivery, and 
interfaces with several existing industrial standards. In November 2011, IED ap­
proved ISA-100.11a as an international standard.
Again, these are far from the only alternatives for industrial automation ap­
plications. VDC research expects the following wireless solutions to all play a role 
in industrial automation based on respondents replies to a 2011 survey [16]: IEEE 
802.11g, IEEE 802.11b, proprietary in 900 MHz Band, IEEE 802.11a, proprietary 
in 2.4 GHz Band, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, proprietary in 
400 MHz Band, and proprietary in 800 MHz Band.
8.5  RF Sensing
Radio frequency techniques are also used in wireless sensors. RF sensors are a non­
contact and intrinsically safe way to measure velocity and distance, detect motion 
and pressure, and indicate direction of motion. In addition, RF sensors are used for 
liquid level sensing and detecting the presence of foreign objects. RF sensing tech­
niques include surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors, Doppler radar, sonar, ultrason­
ics, and microwave sensors. Some of these sensing techniques are used in vehicle 
antitheft and remote entry systems. 
8.5.1  Surface Acoustic Wave Devices
SAW technology is being used for both RF communication and sensing. SAW de­
vices enhance the stability of oscillators in transmitters and provide front-end filters 
to set the bandwidth and improve intermodulation performance of receivers. SAW 
devices respond to temperature, pressure, force, and vibration. The SAW device 
placed in an oscillator circuit, as shown in Figure 8.3, provides a frequency varia­
tion that can accurately be measured [17]. Differential techniques can be used to 
compensate for unwanted stimuli. The frequency range can be from DC to several 
GHz.
SAW devices are also being used in chemical sensors. In gas sensors, dual 
SAW oscillators are frequently used. One SAW device acts as the reference and the 
other has a gas-sensitive film deposited between the input and output interdigi­
tated transducers. The relative change in the SAW oscillator frequency is directly 
proportional to gas concentration. In one study, porous oxide coatings were used 
as the discriminating element in the sensor [18]. The coating microstructure was 
evaluated by monitoring nitrogen adsoption-desorption at 77K using SAW devices 
as sensitive microbalances. The frequency response of a SAW device coated with 

156 
����������������
Wireless Sensing
zeolite in a sol-gel microcomposite film was measured at -6,350 Hz for methanol, 
-10,200 Hz for isopropanol, and +74 Hz for iso-octane.
Automotive navigation systems are also potential users of SAW devices. The 
SAW device is used in an RF-ID tag to identify a vehicle for billing purposes. In this 
application SAW devices operate at 856 MHz (see Section 8.5.8).
8.5.2  Radar
Radar (the acronym for radio detecting and ranging) uses reflected radio waves to 
measure range, bearing, and other parameters. A radar proximity sensor (shown 
in Figure 8.4) uses spread spectrum techniques and is a good example of critical 
elements of a radar system [19]. This particular sensor is designed to meet cost-
sensitive applications, such as blind spot detection in automobiles. The approach 
detects the echoes that reflect back over a limited range from continually propagat­
ing electromagnetic impulses. The sensor is not affected by most materials. so its 
location is not a factor in its ability to function properly. The unit can see through 
walls and can distinguish between the materials of a wood or metal wall. The radar 
noise is coded, so an unlimited number of sensors can be colocated without interfer­
ing with each other.
 The proximity sensor’s antenna transmits a subnanosecond pulse at a noise 
dithered repetition rate. The pulse can be from 50 ps to 50 ns long. Dithering ran­
domizes the time of the transmission in a spread spectrum that appears as noise to 
other detectors. The echoes returned to the (patented) receiver are sampled typi­
cally at a frequency of 1 MHz and in a time frame (plus delay) determined by the 
transmitter. The range of this sensor is limited to 20 ft (6m) or less. However, sev­
eral applications are possible with the sensor, including car security, voice-activated 
Figure 8.3  SAW device.

8.5  RF Sensing

navigation, and detectors for locating one material embedded in another, such as 
steel within concrete.
Production microwave proximity sensors operate on radar principles. A simple 
microwave sensor consists of a transceiver, antenna, and signal processing circuitry 
[20]. The microwave frequency range and its various subclassifications are indi­
cated in Table 8.1. 
The transceiver in a microwave sensor uses a Gunn diode or field-effect tran­
sistor (FET) to generate a low-power microwave signal. The energy developed is 
focused by the antenna into a beam whose size is determined by the application. 
The reflection of the beam from an object provides a lower level signal that can be 
analyzed by the signal processing circuitry. The signal can be used for Doppler shift 
(motion, speed, direction), strength, (presence), or phase change (distance) depend­
ing on the application.
Microwave sensors are experiencing size reductions and performance improve­
ments from the integration possible in microwave monolithic integrated circuit 
(MMIC) chips. A MMIC can have all or large portions of the circuit on a single 
chip. Flip-chip packaging (see Chapter 10) of a MMIC containing the detector di­
odes has allowed frequency operation up to 40 GHz [21].
8.5.3  Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)
Light detection and ranging (LIDAR, also LADAR), or laser radar, is not an RF 
technology. However, it operates similar to radar in some applications. It uses ul­
traviolet, visible, or near-infrared light to image objects. Similar to radar, LIDAR 
can measure distance, speed, and rotation. In addition, it can also measure chemical 
composition and concentration.

Wireless Sensing
LIDAR sensors have distinct advantage and disadvantages compared to radar 
[22]. For example, in vehicle tracking applications, radar sensors provide reliable 
information on straight lanes, but have problems when the road curves due to a 
restricted field of view. In contrast, LIDAR sensors can cover the regions of interest 
in almost all situations, but do not provide precise speed information. As a result, 
in some applications such as autonomous driving (see Chapter 14), both sensors 
are used to obtain the benefits of both and overcome the shortcomings of each 
technology.
8.5.4  Global Positioning System
The global positioning system (GPS) is based on information supplied by 24 satel­
lites that are located in six orbital planes [23]. The satellites pass over Earth at an 
altitude of 20,183 km (10,898 nautical miles). A single satellite will orbit Earth 
twice for each earth rotation, tracing exactly the same path twice each day but 
passing four minutes earlier than the day before. The design of the system ensures 
that at least four satellites are in view at any one time, on or above the surface of 
the Earth under all weather conditions. 
GPS satellites transmit at two frequencies: L1, which is centered at 1,575.42 
MHz and L2, which is centered at 1,227.6 MHz. Each satellite broadcasts a navi­
gation message that includes a description of the satellite’s position as a function 
of time, an almanac, and clock correction terms. Each message is comprised of 25 
frames, each 30 seconds long. A commercial GPS is capable of locating to within 
100m of the desired destination.
GPS technology is an integral part of the automotive intelligent transportation 
system (ITS) (see Section 8.5.7). GPS can be use to track field personnel and for 
locating position relative to location on a digital map. In addition, several GPS 
products are offered for consumer use. GPS is the most commonly recognized form 
of satellite tracking but there are other techniques including:
••
Augmented GPS;
••
Off-board navigation;
••
On-board navigation;
••
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs);
••
Russian GLONASS;
••
Galileo positioning system;
••
COMPASS navigation system of China;
••
Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS);
••
DGPS differential GPS.
Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are enabled by Wi-Fi or Worldwide In­
teroperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and are good for very specific geo­
graphical areas. RTLS can provide enhanced tracking capability to GPS approaches.

8.5.5  Remote Emissions Sensing
The remote measurement of vehicle exhaust emissions is one way that remote sens­
ing will start to affect a broad range of the population. Identifying high carbon 
monoxide (CO)- and hydrocarbon (HC)-emitting vehicles on city streets is possibly 
the next step toward reduced emissions from vehicles with combustion engines. The 
remote sensing system is shown in Figure 8.5 [24]. The main parts of the system 
include: the infrared (IR) detector and source; a video camera to record the license 
plate number; a modified police radar gun; and a personal computer with specially 
developed software. 
The remote sensing device (RSD) system operates by continuously monitoring 
the intensity of an IR source. The presence of a vehicle is indicated when the beam 
is broken, resulting in the reference voltage dropping to zero and a span voltage 
measurement being made. The value prior to beam interruption is also stored. As 
the vehicle exits the beam, samples are taken at 125 Hz for over 1 second. The 
carbon dioxide (CO2) spectral region is filtered at 4.3 µm, and the CO region is 
filtered at 4.6 µm in order to isolate these values. The HC values can be detected 
as well. This system incorporates three noncontact remote measurement devices, 
including an extension of previously used police radar technology that typically has 
a maximum range of 800m.
8.5.6  Remote Keyless Entry
Available wireless remote control of the door locks on vehicles is a step towards an 
automatic driver sensor (ADS). An ADS identifies that a specific driver is approach­
ing the vehicle and that the driver will require access and possibly different control 
settings than the previous driver. Today’s remote entry systems use either IR or RF 
sensors. One RF system, diagrammed in Figure 8.6, has a transmitter in the ignition 
key that is powered by a lithium battery [25]. The transmitter generates a frequency 
of about 41 or 230 MHz when a switch in the key is depressed. The vehicle’s rear 
window defogger acts as the antenna. The antenna receives the signal that is then

sent to the receiver for amplification, FM detection, and wave modification. If the 
transmitted code matches the stored code, the motor drive circuit either unlocks or 
locks the doors. The wireless system can be activated within 3 feet of the vehicle. 
It has a standby mode, which is intermittent to avoid excessive drain on the ve­
hicle’s battery. If ten or more incorrect codes are transmitted to the receiver within 
a 10-minute period, the system reacts as if a theft is occurring and all reception is 
discontinued. The key must be inserted manually to verify ownership.
8.5.7  Intelligent Transportation System
The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), frequently called smart cars and smart 
highways, requires several sensing technologies, many of which are RF-based, in 
order to implement full functionality. ITS has defined several areas that are being 
addressed to varying degrees, from research to production systems. These areas aim 
to solve a number of system-related problems, as well as to provide new functions 
and services to drivers. The application areas include advanced traffic manage­
ment systems (ATMSs); advanced traveler information systems (ATIS); advanced 
public transportation systems (APTSs); advanced vehicle control systems (AVCS); 
advanced rural transportation systems (ARTSs); and commercial vehicle operations 
(CVO). 
The various systems require a number of sensors, including GPS sensing, 
closed-circuit TV monitoring, IR detectors, dead reckoning, automatic vehicle lo­
cation, and identification [26]. Dead reckoning can be accomplished by differential 
Figure 8.6  Remote door lock control system.

8.5  RF Sensing

wheel-speed sensing and a fluxgate magnetic compass, or a combination of in­
clinometers, gyroscopes, inverse Loran, electronic odometers, and/or wheel-speed 
sensors. In addition, the cellular infrastructure and/or radio beacons play an in­
tegral part in the vehicle navigation requirements of ATMS, ATIS, APTS, ARTS, 
and CVO. The AVCS system will require sensors to determine distance between 
vehicles for smart cruise control (automatic vehicle spacing) and closing distance 
(time to impact) for collision avoidance systems. The RF sensors and their typical 
frequency ranges are indicated in Figure 8.7. Many of the developing applications 
are already well-established, especially in high-end vehicles.  
An aspect not shown in Figure 8.7 that uses RF technology for communication 
is dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). DSRC is an enabling technology 
for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. 
Operating at 5.9 GHz, the short-to-medium range communication service has a 
transmission range of up to 1000 meters and a transmission rate from 6 to 27 
Mbps [27].
Collision avoidance uses a 77-GHz three-beam radar unit to provide a time-
to-impact warning. One system can track up to 12 objects while measuring range 
angle and relative velocity [28]. The radar system also employs a video camera 
mounted near the inside mirror to provide a 30-deg field of view. The camera de­
tects lane markings, road edges, and objects in the vehicle’s path. 
Near-obstacle detection systems (NODSs), for parking and blind spot detec­
tion, use Doppler radar operating at 10.5 to 24 GHz to sense objects within a 
few inches or feet from a vehicle. Sensing technologies other than radar are also 
used for this application, including ultrasonic, acoustic, and video imaging. For 
example, Sonar (acoustic sensing) has been developed for these shorter range mea­

Wireless Sensing
surements. Sonar units are mounted at each corner of the vehicle. One sonar device 
operates at 50 kHz and drives a 300V transducer to generate the sonic pulse.
True road speed is one of the inputs that is required in vehicle navigation. A mi­
crowave Doppler radar sensor mounted at the front of the vehicle can provide this 
measurement. Intrinsic errors due to the spread of the Doppler frequencies from 
the top to the bottom of the beam, sensor location, false signals from clutter, pitch­
ing, vibration, signal glint (irregular ground reflections), short term oscillator in­
stability, and dirt are among the error possibilities for this speed sensing approach 
[29]. However, microwave sensors are not significantly affected by humidity, tem­
perature, or air movement, and they do not require isolation of the transmitter and 
receiver, which are considerations for ultrasonic Doppler sensing.
The complete ITS concept contains several systems that ultimately accomplish 
a number of goals, including safer travel on urban and rural roads and higher us­
age of existing highway system. Certain systems and subsystems can and are being 
implemented separately. RF-ID tags are one ITS element that have already achieved 
high volume and usage in a variety of applications.
8.5.8  RF-ID
RF-ID tags are being used to track inventory in warehouses, work-in-process (WIP) 
in manufacturing plants, and animals in laboratories, on farms, or in the wild, as 
well as for automatic toll collection for vehicles. The RF tag is a transponder that is 
read and decoded by an RF reader. For inventory and WIP in harsh environments or 
non-LOS operations, RF-ID is an alternative to a bar-code system [30]. The tags can 
be active or passive. Active tags have on-board batteries and larger data capacities 
approaching 1 Mb. A decision-making ability is included in some varieties with the 
addition of a microcontroller. Passive tags obtain their operating power from RF 
energy transmitted from an antenna, and as a result, have limited data capacities, 
typically 1 to 128 bits. 
RF-ID systems operate in both low- and high-frequency ranges. Low-frequency 
systems typically operate in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 1.5 MHz and also 
have lower data transfer rates. They are cost-effective in access control and as­
set tracking applications. High frequency systems operate in the spread spectrum 
range of 900 MHz to 2.4 GHz and have higher data transfer rates. High frequency 
systems cost more than low frequency systems, but they can operate at distances up 
to 100 feet (30 meters) or more.
The main blocks of a passive RF-ID tag are shown in Figure 8.8 [31]. An 
RF burst is received, rectified, and used to charge a capacitor that serves as the 
power supply for the tag circuitry. A voltage regulator keeps the voltage across the 
capacitor at a constant 2V. Logic circuitry interprets the command from the RF 
burst. An interrogation request is answered with transmission of a number from 
the EEPROM or flash memory. Information in the EEPROM can be changed by 
a transmission that enables the logic to store new data into the on-board memory. 
The charge pump increases the 2V to 15V to reprogram the EEPROM.
RF-ID tags are being used for automatic toll collection. The driver does not 
have to slow down for the system to detect the vehicle’s ID and charge the driver/

owner’s account. This can reduce congestion on highways and still collect revenue 
to cover road construction and maintenance.
8.5.9  Other Remote Sensing
RF bar code readers demonstrate the freedom of operating untethered for com­
mercial applications, which have become commonplace. Available RF units provide 
data from charge-coupled devices (CCDs), laser scanners, or infrared wand sensors 
to a base station that can be up to 150 ft (45.7m) away. The units are mobile and 
can be used without the interference of wires in high-traffic areas.
Remote meter reading is being accomplished by transmitting the amount of 
gas, water, or electricity consumed at a particular site to a mobile receiving unit. 
A single operator can verify the status of almost twice the number of accounts, 
thereby reducing the cost of the measurement. Remote barcode readers and scan­
ners are also among the applications that are taking advantage of RF technology in 
a sensing environment.
8.6  Telemetry
Telemetry is a remote measurement technique that permits data to be interpreted at 
a distance from the primary detector. Telemetry is used in Formula One race cars 
to allow the pit crew to analyze the real-time data generated from a vehicle on the 
track and provide feedback to the driver that can affect the outcome of the race. 
More than a dozen sensors placed around the vehicle provide information to the 
engine control computer and transmit the data to a mobile laboratory that travels 
from race to race [32]. An indication of a potential problem can initiate a pit stop 
before the problem becomes a race-disqualifying failure. Indianapolis 500 and Na­
tional Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) vehicles also use similar 
telemetry. In fact, proving ground vehicles equipped with telemetry systems allow 
automotive engineers to evaluate development vehicles on a high-speed test track 
from their offices. Cellular communications with the driver provides on-the-spot 
direction for performing various tests with real-time feedback on how the system is

Wireless Sensing
affected. In both racing and vehicle development, time is short and cost investment 
is high. Telemetry makes the outcome more predictable.
Production vehicles use telemetry in the tire pressure monitoring system 
(TPMS). The RF transmitter at each wheel sends a signal in the ISM band (315, 
434, 868, and 915 MHz are common frequencies) that is received by a unit mount­
ed under the dash, and a dashboard-mounted display provides information to the 
driver. One system uses pulse code modulation to transmit digital data by turning 
the carrier frequency on or off, producing bursts of radio frequency energy [33]. 
Switching rate and time are controlled to create the code.
Wheel-mounted transmitters deliver 10 frames of coded data in 128-ms bursts 
at approximately 30- to 35-second intervals. Each frame has eight bits of data and 
a blanking period. Two bits indicate tire pressure, two identify the wheel being 
measured, and the remaining four bits identify the car model and year. Tire pres­
sure and temperature are important vehicle measurements that not only affect the 
performance and economy of the vehicle, but also have a significant impact on 
vehicle safety. As a result, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) regulation Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 138 requires 
all new light vehicles sold in the United States to have a TPMS since 2007. Figure 
8.9 shows one manufacturer’s view of a highly integrated system [34].
Another measurement that is difficult to obtain is the temperature of the piston 
in an internal combustion engine. Telemetry has been used to transmit the tempera­
ture indicated by the variation of a temperature-sensitive chip capacitor. The sys­
tem schematic is shown in Figure 8.10 [35]. Increasing temperature decreases the 
capacitance that, in turn, increases the transmitting frequency. A multiloop antenna

in the oil pan receives the transmitted signal. Data is converted to temperature 
through a calibration curve. The system has seven data channels to map tempera­
tures at a number of locations inside the piston. A small 22-pin hybrid package 
contains the multiplexer and the blocking oscillator. Power is generated based on 
the piston’s movement. A minimum engine speed of 1,200 rpm is necessary, and 
temperatures from 150 to over 600°F (65–315°C) can be measured. To keep track 
of the data being sent, a reference capacitor that is not temperature-dependent 
transmits a 1-MHz signal. The remaining channels are each turned on for 1 second 
and off for 1 second. Temperature-dependent frequencies are generated between 
250 kHz to 500 kHz for the data channels.
Ambulatory monitoring of critically ill patients, or patients requiring real-time 
diagnostics for analysis purposes, has increased the use of medical telemetry. This 
telemetry can be short-range within a hospital floor, long-range for an entire wing, 
or strictly on the patient in a body area network (BAN). Most telemetry is within 
the 174–216 MHz (VHF) frequency band for ultra-low power transmission. High­
er power requirements use an alternative UHF band (450–470 MHz) and require 
licensing.
Real-time monitoring of noninvasive blood pressure, partial pressure of oxy­
gen (SpO2), and peripheral pulse provide additional diagnostic and assessment 
information on many cardiac and respiratory patients. Electrocardiograms (ECG) 
and SpO2 can be monitored by small light-weight devices [36]. A central monitor­
ing station receives the data, analyzes the data for anomalies, and routes waveform 
data and parameter data to additional analysis or recording equipment. Consoli­
dating several patients into one remote station can lower hospital costs by reducing 
the staff for intensive care and post-operative units, as well as provide an improved 
level of patient care. More data can be accumulated and analyzed with less effort

from nurses and doctors. In addition, the onset of problems can be detected quickly 
and appropriate action can be taken sooner.
RF telemetry has also been investigated for microminiature transducers for 
biomedical applications. Transferring data and power into and out of the body to 
implanted transducers is a critical area due to the reliability of the component and, 
more importantly, the restrictions and potential for patient infection.  A millimeter-
size microstimulator was developed using RF telemetry, operating at 1 MHz for 
power and control [37].  The assembly included: a micromachined silicon substrate 
that has the stimulating electrodes, CMOS, and bipolar power regulation circuitry; 
a custom-made glass capsule electrostatically bonded onto the silicon carrier to 
provide a hermetically sealed package; hybrid chip capacitors; and the receiving 
antenna coil. 
A wireless endoscopy imaging capsule called the PillCam® uses a custom RF 
transceiver from Microsemi Corporation for telemetry [38]. Because a patient 
swallows the device, it has unique application requirements. The PillCam can have 
a CMOS optical detector to capture images at each end. Figure 8.11 identifies a 
single-camera application and other system aspects, including the RF transmitter 
and antenna.  The transceiver reduces battery size by enabling the capsule to con­
sume less than 7.5 mW of power while transmitting up to 14 images per second 
during an eight-hour procedure.
The application of microtelemetry will be more practical with improvements 
in integrated MEMS devices, including biological MEMS (BioMEMS) and other 
sensors and a reduction in the receiving antenna size.
8.7  RF MEMS
MEMS technology is being used to develop RF components that demonstrate supe­
rior high-frequency performance relative to conventional (usually semiconductor) 
devices. These devices provide potential for new system capabilities [39]. Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has investigated MEMS technology 
for radio front-ends, capacitor banks, and time-delay networks for quasi-optical 
beam steering and reconfigurable antennas.

8.8  Application Example 
167
One patent describes a monolithically-integrated switched capacitor bank us­
ing MEMS technology that is capable of handling GHz-signal frequencies in both 
the RF and millimeter bands [40]. In addition, the technique maintains precise 
digital selection of capacitor levels over a wide tuning range. Each MEMS switch 
includes a cantilever arm suspended above the substrate that extends over a ground 
line and a gapped signal line with a set of contacts on the arm and the substrate. 
The MEMS switch is actuated by a voltage applied to the top electrode that pro­
duces an electrostatic force and attracts the control capacitor structure towards the 
ground line, causing the electrical contact to close the gap. The integrated MEMS 
switch-capacitor pairs have a large range between their on-state and off-state im­
pedance, and exhibit superior isolation and insertion loss characteristics.
Antennas, transmission lines, and other RF components are being built us­
ing micromachining techniques [41]. The MEMS devices are less expensive than 
previous silicon versions. Figure 8.12 shows a 40-GHz waveguide [41]. Standard 
CMOS processing was used with a post-process etch to obtain the V-groove and 
open area. The transverse electromagnetic mode (TEM) waveguide provides low-
loss and high-phase velocity at up to 40 GHz.
The cost of installing sensors (as much as $2,000 per ft in some situations, 
such as portions of an aircraft) is initiating research and also the implementation of 
wireless MEMS sensors [42]. 
8.8  Application Example
Healthcare monitoring is a rapidly growing area. With wireless sensing technology, 
engineers have developed new applications in hospital and clinics, doctors’ offices, 
remote wireless healthcare, and PAN diagnostics and monitoring. Market research

to more than 400 million devices by 2014 [43].  Three broad categories for this 
growth include health and fitness, at-home health monitoring, and professional 
healthcare telemedicine.
With the many different wireless communication technologies and advanced 
sensors available today, many companies and universities are proposing solutions 
for healthcare applications. As shown in Figure 8.13, University of Virginia re­
searchers in the INERTIA team have described how body area sensor networks 
(BASNs) can measure physiological, biokinetic, and ambient phenomena [44].  The 
team is researching fundamental issues associated with these networks, including 
the tradeoffs associated with wearability, system capabilities, power consumption, 
dynamics environment adjustment, and more.
One of the challenges that researchers face in these highly localized measure­
ments includes choosing the right wireless technology. Figure 8.14 shows a system 
view that consolidates the collection (sensor) and processing (MCU and software) 
into one block and the wireless technologies into a transmission block [45]. The 
diagram identifies five different wireless technologies to transmit medical data, es­
pecially real-time data from sensors. While the technologies are used today, they 
have not yet been optimized for medical applications. As a result, there are many 
opportunities to improve these systems with continued advancement in sensors, 
wireless networks, and other system technologies.
8.9  Summary
Real-time data acquisition systems increasingly look to RF communications for 
more complete monitoring, faster installation, and easier maintenance. With a

variety of wireless sensing networks available, the savvy system developer can cre­
ate new approaches for sensing systems and solve problems in many areas. Field 
service workers and other mobile data collectors who need to communicate the 
results of a sensed parameter or acquired data do not want to be connected by wires 
to a distributed system. Farms or vineyards that are equipped with wireless sensors 
can monitor conditions, such as temperature and moisture level, over a wide area 
and provide data that can optimize the use of water to avoid excessive usage and 
save valuable crops. Monitoring for energy efficiency and indoor air quality in 
buildings is recognized as essential in many new buildings. Home, office, vehicle, 
industrial, and human body monitoring systems are easier to implement with RF 
signal transmission instead of using hard-wired installations. Also, several hazard­
ous monitoring situations require the sensing and transmitting of data to minimize 
the exposure of humans to toxic material. The combination of wireless technology 
with MEMS technology is part of an exciting new area for smart sensors.

MEMS Beyond Sensors
MEMS technology is used for more than sensors and advanced materials expand 
the possibilities. Silicon carbide micro- and nano-systems are uniquely enabling for 
high temperature instrumentation and control applications.
—Merhan Meraghany, MEMS research pioneer (2012)
9.1  Introduction
The MEMS technology that has enabled many new semiconductor sensors is being 
applied to control systems for numerous mechanical applications. In some cases, 
the microstructures that are being developed have no direct relationship to sensors. 
However, many of these devices enhance the performance of the total system or 
allow system design that was not previously possible. Since micromachining is fun­
damental to manufacturing these structures, future developments in this area will 
improve both MEMS technology and the systems that utilize them. 
The microscale design and fabrication of mechanical and electrical structures 
is called microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The terms microsystems and 
microsystems technology (MST) are also used to describe the structures formed 
using micromachining, especially in Europe. The extent to which micromachining 
is utilized to produce components that are not sensors is demonstrated by the list 
of developed silicon structures shown in Table 9.1 [1]. The batch processing of me­
chanical components has the same potential for mechanical engineering and other 
disciplines that semiconductor batch processing has had for electrical engineering. 
The semiconductor industry with 2011 global sales of about 300 billion and result­
ing electronics industry would not exist without batch processing technology. A 
few of the areas that are being explored will be discussed in this chapter to indicate 
the variety and extent of MEMS technology. The MEMS field is progressing and 
expanding very fast. The examples given show the broad coverage of this new field. 
New actuator designs and new MEMS technologies are being developed rapidly. 
The reader interested in the most recent developments is referred to the MEMS 
Industry Group, journals, books, and websites referenced in this chapter and at the 
end of the book.

9.2  MEMS Actuators
Actuators micromachined from silicon and other semiconductor materials use elec­
trostatic, electrothermal, thermopneumatic, electromagnetic, electroosmotic, elec­
trohydrodynamic, shape memory alloy (SMA), thermoresponsive polymers, and 
other means to provide motion. Table 9.2 shows a comparison of the capabilities 
of several actuators [2]. These actuators range from existing products that provide 
unmatched performance compared to their macro-scale counterparts to intriguing 
lab curiosities that require significant development to become practical. Examples 
of a silicon microvalve, micromotors, micropump, microdynamometer, microtrans­
mission, and a microsteam engine as well as actuators in alternate materials will be 
discussed in this section.
9.2.1  Microvalves 
One area of MEMS actuators that has achieved production status is microvalves. 
Figure 9.1 shows a direct acting valve fabricated from three layers of silicon [3–7]. 
The three layers of the valve stack include an over plate, mechanical layer, and port 
plate. The valve is approximately 6 mm × 10 mm × x mm, yet provides the same

ports by moving a sliding plate valve over the openings in a port plate. Flow capac­
ity tests using nitrogen (N2) at 100 psi yield flows from 6 to 40 L/min.

The microvalves are used in automotive transmissions and brake systems as 
well for refrigerants in air conditioning and other rugged applications. With a max­
imum aperture size of 2 mm2, the chip provides the pilot valve in an assembly that 
has a response time of 0.25 seconds, maximum operating pressure of 450 psig, 
resolution of 0.5 PWM steps from 20% to 80% and valve shutoff leakage of 2 lpm 
at 100 psig (air). 
9.2.2  Micromotors 
Micromotors are among the more interesting demonstrations of the potential of 
MEMS. Several researchers have fabricated electrostatic and electromagnetic mo­
tors. An example of an electrostatic motor is shown in Figure 9.2 [8]. The rotor’s 
diameter is typically about 0.1 mm. The stator is activated by pulses that produce 
an electrostatic force. Coupling the motor to a load and friction are among the 
problems that must be solved to make the motor useful. However, a fan for cool­
ing ultrahigh performance microprocessors is among the possibilities that can be 
envisioned for this technology. Tribology is the study of wear and is among the 
areas receiving considerable investigation for these machines since they cannot be 
lubricated using conventional approaches and maintain the unique capabilities that 
MEMS technology promises.
Figure 9.2  Electrostatic micromotor. (After: [8].)

9.2  MEMS Actuators 
177
The coil windings in a magnetic micromotor require a thicker actuator cross 
section. One approach uses a polyimide-based process that allows microstructures 
to be fabricated on top of a standard CMOS process [9]. The core of the motor 
is multilevel electroplated nickel-iron wrapped around a meander conductor. The 
meander structure for conductor and coil is accomplished by reversing the normal 
roles of the conductor and magnetic core. The magnetic core is wrapped around a 
planar conductor either by interlacing or by interconnecting multilevel metal lay­
ers. Polyimide is used as the dielectric interlayer between for embedding the coils 
and the cores. Figure 9.4 shows the functional micromotor and an example of the 
meander coil [9, 10]. The rotor was operated up to a speed of 500 rpm based on 
the limitations of the drive controller.
A micromachined wedge stepper motor has been fabricated using surface mi­
cromachining technology [11]. As shown in Figure 9.3, the outer ring has internal 
teeth that are engaged by a tooth on each end of the reciprocating shuttle. The 
outer ring can have gear teeth on the outside or other means of engaging another 
mechanical member. The figure shows a rotary version of the 3-poly layer indexing 
stepper motor. However, a linear version of this concept is possible as well. This 
approach can be used in designs that require precise and repeatable positioning of 
micromechanical components.
9.2.3  Micropumps
A miniature peristaltic pump has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The pump 
consists of three silicon wafers bonded together as shown in Figure 9.5 to produce 
a flow channel, membrane, and heater [12]. Silicon fusion bonding was used to 
join the wafers containing these elements together. The heaters are suspended in a 
thermopneumatic fluid and sequentially activated from left to right. The flow chan­
nel is fabricated by a proprietary etching technique to closely match the contour of

the bulging silicon nitride membrane. Heating the fluid deflects the membrane that 
displaces the liquid. The deflected membrane seals the channel to prevent backflow. 
Performance of the micropump has been predicted to be 7 µl per minute at 15 psi. 
Pumps that can displace precise amounts of liquid have applications in medicine for

automatic insulin dispensing as well as in manufacturing for precise process control 
and reduced material cost.
9.2.4  Microdynamometer
The first steps have been taken to achieve a functional planar microdynamometer 
[13]. A dynamometer consists of a motor, a coupling gear train, a generator to 
act as an active load, and associated electronics. The LIGA process (discussed in 
Chapter 2) with the addition of a sacrificial layer (SLIGA) was used to fabricate 
mechanical components of the MEMS microdynamometer. Magnetic actuation was 
chosen for the micromotor and generator windings. As shown in Figure 9.6, a

MEMS Beyond Sensors
2-pole-pair motor with three windings per pole (upper right-hand corner) and a 
generator with six windings were fabricated using electroplated nickel. Photodiodes 
were integrated in the design that can be used to determine the position of the rotor 
in the motor and the generator. Among the issues that must be resolved to realize a 
functional microdynamometer are magnetic materials problems.
A microtransmission has been fabricated using surface micromachining that 
can increase the power from a microengine by a factor of 3 million when the fric­
tion is neglected [14]. Researchers coupled six identical transmission systems, each 
with a 12:1 reduction ratio to achieve the total increase. That level could allow a 
micromachine the force needed to move a 1-lb object. The gear is reversible and 
can increase as well as decrease speeds. Figure 9.7 shows an example of a surface 
micromachined gear set [15].
9.2.5  Microsteam Engine
The world’s smallest steam engine was fabricated using surface micromachining 
technology [15]. Figure 9.8 shows the SEM of this device. Water inside of the com­
pression cylinders is heated by electric current, vaporizes, and pushes the piston out. 
Capillary forces retract the piston when the current is removed.
9.2.6  Actuators in Other Semiconductor Materials
Actuators have been designed and fabricated using thin film and plated metals, 
dielectrics, and photoresists for sacrificial layers on GaAs and InP substrates. GaAs 
and InP materials are used to fabricate MMIC devices, which require tuning that 
potentially can be performed by on-chip actuators and result in improved perfor­
mance and yield. Sliding interdigitated capacitive tuners, bending beams, and ro­

tating switches have been fabricated in a MMIC compatible process as a first step 
toward their ultimate use to control the MMIC [16].
Epitaxial silicon carbide (3C-SiC) films and sputtered amorphous SiC films 
have been investigated for high-temperature MEMS devices [17]. Suspended dia­
phragms and free-standing cantilever structures were etched into epitaxial films 
using bulk micromachining. The cantilever beams deflected downward due to re­
sidual stress variation in the film. Surface micromachining techniques were also 
applied to amorphous SiC. A 150-µm-diameter, 1.5-µm-thick gear was fabricated 
from amorphous SiC sputtered on silicon dioxide. These materials hold promise 
for MEMS devices but require considerable development effort to progress from 
the laboratory into production.
A more recent application of SiC technology produced a nanoelectromechani­
cal system (NEMS) switch that can operate at temperatures up to 500°C [18, 19]. 
As shown in Figure 9.9, researchers etched switches a few hundred nanometers in 
size out of silicon carbide. In addition to achieving virtually zero leakage off-state 
current, the switches are capable of operating at microwave frequencies with radia­
tion hardness. Using a pair of these switches, the design team made an inverter that 
was able to switch on and off 500,000 times per second, performing computations 
each cycle. Switch breakdowns that occurred after 2 billion cycles are the subject 
of further research.
9.3  Other Micromachined Structures
In addition to actuators, MEMS structures will be used for system components that 
require small size or reproducibility that can be achieved with micromachining. 
Microgears were already discussed previously. Multiple metal microgears have been 
driven by forced air or relatively weak magnetic fields. Other examples discussed

in this section demonstrate the variety of research and development activity that is 
occurring for MEMS-based devices.
9.3.1  Cooling Channels
A microheat pipe created by parallel microchannels in the bottom of a high perfor­
mance IC can provide cooling to minimize hot spots, improve performance, and 
increase reliability. A proposed approach is shown in Figure 9.10 [20]. After etching 
the channels, multiple metalization layers are vacuum deposited to line the walls 
of the channel and seal the top. Heating the chip in a fluid bath fills approximately 
20% of the cavity volume with fluid. The ends are sealed after this step to contain 
the fluid. The microheat pipe’s operation causes fluid to evaporate in high tempera­
ture regions and condense in low temperature areas resulting in a more uniform 
temperature distribution across the IC. Increasingly higher operating frequencies 
for higher performance MPUs and MCUs may require this type of cooling to avoid 
increasing the packaging size and/or increasing the amount of external heatsinking.
A patent has been issued in the United States for cooling of high-power semi­
conductor devices using microchannels formed by micromachining or laser cutting 
techniques in silicon or silicon carbide structures [21]. The microchannels remove

heat by forced convection and/or the use of fluid coolant located as close as pos­
sible to the heat source. The microchannels maximize heat sink surface area and 
provide improved heat transfer coefficients for higher-power density of semicon­
ductor devices without increasing junction temperature or decreasing reliability.
Gaseous flow in micron-sized channels is also being investigated. The exchange 
of energy and momentum between MEMS and their gaseous environments often 
governs the response characteristics of these systems. In order to study the momen­
tum exchange between a gaseous media and microdevices, microchannels were 
fabricated (52.25 mm wide, 1.33 µm deep, and 7,500 mm long) for conducting 
nitrogen flow experiments [22].
9.3.2  Microoptics
A number of microoptical devices have been produced by micromachining tech­
niques, including gratings, lenses, air bridges, electrical interconnects, fiber-optic 
couplers, alignment aids, corner reflectors, and waveguides [23]. In addition to sili­
con, a number of III-V semiconductor materials are being investigated for improved 
optical performance. A chemically assisted ion beam etching (CAIBE) process using 
argon and xenon ion beams and chlorine as the reactive gas was used to fabricate 
surface-emitting lasers. The 3-µm diameter lasers operated at room temperature 
with a threshold current below 1.5 mA and a differential quantum efficiency of 
16%. However, a number of problems must be solved for the lasers to provide a 
viable solution for optical computing, chip-to-chip communications, and optical 
switching. The combination of mechanics, optics, and electronics at the micron 
scale promises to be an important field in optical microsystems.
A different combination of micromachining and optics is demonstrated in Fig­
ure 9.11 [24]. This polysilicon microscanner consists of a hollow nickel-plated 
polygon reflector on the rotor of an electrostatic drive micromotor. Microopto­
mechanical systems (MOMS) are based on wafer-level integration of optical and 
MEMS components. Microscanners and movable optical elements have been de­
signed and fabricated using electroless plating of reflective nickel surfaces on the 
rotor of the micromotor. The nickel thickness (height) is 20 µm and its width is 
10 µm. Scanners with diameters from 250 to 1,000 µm have been produced, but 
the larger micromotors do not operate reliably after they are released. Diffraction 
grating microscanners were fabricated with spatial gratings of 2 and 4 µm using a 
similar process. The key to MOMS devices is the ability to fabricate different opti­
cal and mechanical structures on a common substrate.
An actuator has been proposed that uses optical power to provide mechani­
cal energy [25]. An optical actuator has potential advantages of higher operating 
speed, lower power consumption, and lower thermal expansion than nonoptical 
approaches. A silicon cantilever reacts to a photoelectric current by relaxing, as 
opposed to an applied electrostatic voltage that stresses the beam further.
9.3.3  Microgripper
Microgrippers or microtweezers have been demonstrated by several researchers. 
One research team has developed a surface-micromachined polysilicon microgrip­
per that is activated by an electrostatic comb-drive [26]. The electrostatic-comb 

184 
�������������������
MEMS Beyond Sensors
drive technique provides the force for several microactuators as well as an oscillat­
ing structure for many sensors. The two movable gripper arms are controlled by a 
three-element electrostatic comb as shown in Figure 9.12. The length of the drive 
arms Ldr is 400 µm and each extension arm is Lext = 100 µm long. By using separate 
open-and-close drivers, the gripping range for a given maximum voltage is doubled.

tesy of Case Western Reserve University.)

9.3  Other Micromachined Structures 
185
Movement of 5 µm was produced by the grippers with less than 30V applied to the 
comb drive.
9.3.4  Microprobes
A cantilever beam contacting and scanning across the surface of a sample can mea­
sure the topography of a surface. This instrument, an atomic force microscope 
(AFM), requires a mechanical structure with a sharp tip, small spring constant, 
and high resonant frequency [27]. Batch fabrication yields cantilevers with very re­
producible characteristics, and piezoelectric-, capacitive-, or piezoresistive-sensing 
techniques can be used to sense the deflection of the probe tip. The construction 
of an AFM probe is shown in Figure 9.13. The dimensions of one device are L1 = 
175 µm, L2 = 75 µm, w = 20 µm, b = 90 µm, and t = 2 µm. The calculated spring 
constant of this structure is 4 N/m. The AFM probe was used to measure a silicon 
dioxide grating that had a depth of 270Å and repeated every 6.5 µm. These types of 
devices may be useful in profilometry and IC inspection. An AFM probe produced 
by Park Scientific Instruments is shown in Figure 9.13(b).

9.3.5  Micromirrors
One of the most successful MEMS actuators is Texas Instruments Digital Light 
Processing technology. The first commercial products were shipped in 1996. Exten­
sively used for displays, digital micromirror devices are micromachined as shown 
in Figure 9.14. The micromirror element is an aluminum mirror suspended over an 
air gap by two thin post-supported hinges [28]. The mechanically compliant hinges 
permit the mirror to rotate 10 degrees in either direction. The posts provide the con­
nections to a bias/reset bus that connects all the mirrors of the arrays to a bond pad. 
The mirrors are fabricated over conventional CMOS SRAM cells that provide an 
address circuit for each mirror. The mirrors have a response time of approximately 
10 ms and can be pulse-width modulated to provide a gray scale output in a black 
and white display. Monolithic arrays with 768 × 576 pixels have been produced.
The most recent version of this design, created by DLP Pico technology, was 
introduced in January 2012 [29]. The DLP3000 is comprised of 415,872 (608 × 
684 array) microscopic mirrors. Its companion controller, the DLPC300, provides 
a user interface for high-speed operation of the micromirror array. The micromir­
rors have a 7.6-µm pitch and achieve a ±12-deg tilt angle.
A hinged micromirror device has been fabricated using surface micromachin­
ing [15]. The hinged micromirror is driven by microengine coupled to a three-gear 
torque increasing system. The combination is sufficient to deflect the mirror with­
out aid of external probes. Figure 9.15 shows the mirror is shown in the upright 
position.
MEMS technology is finding increased usage in production displays. Based on 
a reflective interferometric modulation (IMOD) technology, pixels in one display 
contain reflecting micromembranes [30]. The bistable pixels are highly reflective, 
consume very low power, and can be seen in direct sunlight.
Another MEMS-based display technology uses a digital microshutter to modu­
late light from a red-green-blue (RGB) backlight [31]. The unit’s high switching 
speed allows its use in applications form full-speed video to e-reader operation.

The manufacturer cites performance capabilities of greater than 170-degree view­
ing angles, more than 3,000:1 contrast ratio, and 24-bit color depth at one quarter 
of the power consumption of equivalent size and resolution liquid crystal displays.
9.3.6  Heating Elements
Multijunction thermal converters (MJTCs) have been fabricated using a standard 
CMOS process and bulk micromachining [32]. After CMOS processing, a cavity is 
etched by bulk micromachining that produces a suspended MJTC cantilever struc­
ture shown in Figure 9.16. Polysilicon resistive heating elements and aluminum-
polysilicon thermocouple junctions are encapsulated in glass. The glass protects 
these elements from the etchant and provides a mechanical support. MJTCs have 
potential applications in low-cost, high-precision RF and microwave power circuits.
9.3.7  Thermionic Emitters
Arrays of sputtered tungsten thermionic emitters have been fabricated by surface 
micromachining [33]. An SiO2 layer isolates sputtered tungsten from the silicon 
substrate. The tungsten is patterned by wet-etching, and the silicon is also wet-
etched under the filament to avoid contact. The filaments were tested in a vacuum 
of 5 × 10-7 torr. The filaments changed from barely visible red to white light once 
they start to emit. Operating life approaching 1 hr has been achieved with emission 
currents of about 10 nA. The thermionic emitters are used as the first stage on a 
miniature scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM is less than 2 cm3 in vol­
ume and is formed by stacking five silicon dice.
Those developments in thermionics require examining terms that are commonly 
used for semiconductors. The invention and volume production of semiconductors

or solid-state devices displaced vacuum tubes. However, thermionic devices made 
using semiconductor processes have now created gaseous-state microdevices. Vol­
ume production of these devices is certain to raise comments if they are referred to 
as solid-state devices.
9.3.8  Field Emission Devices
A number of field emission devices (FEDs) are being developed using microma­
chining techniques [34]. An FED consists of an array of emitting microtips. In one 
approach, the microtips are formed by etching chambers inside a masked silicon 
wafer. Molybdenum tips are vacuum deposited in the chamber. Several hundred 
emitter tips are fabricated for each pixel, allowing dozens of tips to fail without 
discernible loss of brightness.
Another technique to produce the microtips uses selective etching of a polycrys­
talline silicon substrate. This is a self-aligned process that uses the crystal structure 
of silicon to produce atomically sharp silicon tips. It may be possible to eliminate 
lithography in this approach due to the self-aligning nature of the process. (The 
application of FEDs is discussed further in Chapter 11.)
9.3.9  Unfoldable Microelements
Microstructures that have elastic joints have been used to make movable three-
dimensional (3-D) structures from planar surface micromachined structures. Mi­
crorobots are among the possibilities for these devices. The basis of the movable 
structure is shown in Figure 9.17(a) [35]. Polyimide provides the flexible connection

to polysilicon plates or skeleton-like structures. The phosphosilicate glass (PSG) is 
sacrificially etched to free the structure for the substrate. Released structures have 
actually been folded at the hinges like paper, creating microcubes and insect-like 
3-D structures. 
An SEM of a robotic bug example is shown in Figure 9.17(b) [36]. The struc­
ture was fabricated using MCNC’s multiuser MEMS process (MUMPs). The bug 
includes an actuator, electronics, sensors, IR diode, and solar cell. The microrobot 
is made from a 1cm × 0.5 cm × 0.5mm silicon chip. 
A surface-micromachined MEMS hinge designed for foldout structures uses 
two structural layers of polysilicon to form both the hinge and movable plate [37]. 
The more recent development is an improvement over an earlier pin-and-staple sys­
tem and scissor-hinge design. The pin-and-staple system required three structural 
layers to achieve a base, axle pin, and retaining staple where the foldout movable 
structure was attached to the substrate. The scissor-hinge weaves a second poly­
silicon layer under and then over the first polysilicon layer. Weaving allows the

tesy of BSAC, University of California Berkeley).

retaining structure to be deposited with the first layer but not connected to it. The 
most recent development makes use of cantilevers to press on and then fix the axle 
pin. The axle is designed with a self-limiting mechanism that prevents the axle from 
protruding beneath the first layer of polysilicon. The hinge was designed, built, 
and tested in a surface-micromachined microphotonic system. The hinge could be 
opened to 90 ± 0.8 degrees.
Methods for actuating the artificial arms on robotic devices have been studied 
and compared to properties of nature’s actuators: muscles [38]. One of the more 
interesting developments is an electrostatic muscle that uses the combination of 
a number of small force displacements to produce significant displacement [39]. 
Integrated force arrays produce a flexible membrane that contracts with an applied 
electric field. Surface micromachining is used to create metal-clad polyimide rect­
angles that are only a few µm on a side. An array of 1.5 million cells forms a 1-cm-
long fiber that contracts 0.3 cm with only a few volts applied. The force-array 
technology is being developed for coordinated movement of interlocking flexible 
elements. Besides robotics, self-aligned high-density multicontact electrical connec­
tors can be designed using this technology.
9.3.10  Micronozzles
Microminiature apertures and nozzles are required for optical instruments and a 
variety of mechanical devices, including high-resolution inkjet printers, flow con­
trol, and atomizers [40]. The micronozzle used for inkjet printers is the highest 
volume production microactuator. Sacrificial etching is used to produce a highly 
cusped nozzle-shaped structure using silicon nitride. A mold is created for the ni­
tride by steps (a) through (d) in Figure 9.18. The nitride structure is freed from the 
substrate by a KOH etch and precision backsawing as shown in Figure 9.18(e). 
Alternatively, back-masked anisotropic etching produces the structure shown in 
Figure 9.18  Micronozzle fabrication process. (After: [40].)

9.3  Other Micromachined Structures

Figure 9.18(f). A variety of other materials including silicon dioxide, boron-doped 
silicon, polysilicon, refractory, and noble metals can be used for the nozzle.
9.3.11  Interconnects for Stacked Wafers
Wafer-on-wafer construction is being used to improve the density of integrated 
circuits. Micromachining with subsequent metalization can provide a technique to 
interconnect a stack of various silicon technologies at the wafer level. As shown in 
Figure 9.19 [41], anisotropically etched wafers are aligned where the interconnec­
tion is required. The pyramid shaped structure has a square opening at the top of 
25 µm and is 120 µm at the bottom for thin wafers. A fine gold-plated wire mesh is 
used to fill the cavity. The wire mushrooms at the top and compresses at the bottom 
to form a gold-on-gold contact.
More recently, MEMS technology is used to create vertical connections called 
through-silicon vias (field emission devices) to enable 3-D packaging and reduce IC 
footprints in space-constrained circuit boards. One process offers sub-50-µm pitch 
for through wafer connections in up to 60-µm thick substrates [42]. As shown in 
Figure 9.20, DRIE (refer to Chapter 2) technology using a via-first approach en­
ables the construction of CMOS sensors on top of via substrates. The trench etch 
stops before the wafer is etched completely through. After filling the cavity with a 
high-temperature dielectric, a chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) process 
applied to the back of the wafer removes the connecting material to yield isolated 
connection paths through the wafer. See Section 10.4.5 for more details.
9.3.12  Nanoguitar
In case the imagination has not been sufficiently stimulated by the variety of struc­
tures discussed so far in this chapter, one final example is the nanoguitar fabricated 
by researchers at Cornell University [43]. As shown in Figure 9.21, what has been 
called the world’s smallest guitar is only 10 µm long. The six strings are each 50 
nm, or 100 atoms, wide. The nanoguitar was micromachined from crystalline sili­
con. The key to the technology is electron-beam (e-beam) lithography that allows 
extremely fine patterns to be created. A 30-nm-wide wire suspended across a 2-µm 
gap has also been made using this approach. These nanomechanical devices are 
among the initial research to resolve physical questions regarding motion and me­
chanical energy dissipation.

9.4  Application Example
In contrast to the MEMS guitar and some of the other structures discussed in this 
chapter that are strictly laboratory demonstration devices, MEMS-based oscillators 
have found applications in numerous electronics systems. Since oscillator timing 
circuits provide critical synchronization for most digital systems, they are an inte­
gral part of virtually all electronic products. One company has shipped over 100 
million oscillator, clock generator, and resonator units [44]. While this is small com­
pared to the volume of quartz oscillators, it is a significant acceptance for MEMS 
technology in this application. The MEMS-based units’ typical advantages over 
traditional quartz oscillators include lower cost, smaller and thinner packages, as 
well as higher reliability.

9.4  Application Example 
193
Figure 9.22 shows the construction of a MEMS oscillator from SiTime [45]. 
The plastic package contains the MEMS resonator mounted on an analog oscil­
lator IC. The programmable CMOS circuitry allows the combination to achieve 
stability up to 0.1 ppm and jitter of 500 femtoseconds or less. In addition, the IC 
can address spread spectrum, programmable drive strength, and multiprotocol sig­
naling in a single chip.
Figure 9.23 shows the architecture of the MEMS oscillator including three dif­
ferent mechanical structures representing the variety of resonators that could be 
used for different applications [46]. The phase-locked loop (PLL) circuitry on the 
analog oscillator die generates the output frequency that can range from 250 kHz 
to 800 MHz, depending on the requirements of the specific device. In addition, the 
PLL uses the digitally converted output of the temperature sensor for temperature 
compensation achieving 0.1 to 50 ppm frequency stability over the temperature 
range.
Figures 9.22 and 9.23 are one company’s approach to MEMS timing and over 
a dozen suppliers are forecast to compete for this business before the end of 2012 
[47]. One established supplier of crystal (piezoelectric) oscillators has developed 
a piezoelectric MEMS (pMEMS) oscillator [48]. The company layers aluminum-
nitride piezoelectric material on a single-crystal silicon MEMS resonator beam to 
yield a device that actuates the silicon beam’s vibrations and transduces its bulk-
acoustic wave into electrical timing signals. With this technique, the supplier has 
achieved native frequencies as high as 1GHz. The other companies competing for 
MEMS oscillator business will use a combination of MEMS design, CMOS analog 
circuitry, packaging, and software to differentiate their products and address the 
application requirements for MEMS timing solutions. Many of the systems that 
use the MEMS oscillators will also use a variety of sensors, so smart sensors will 
benefit from the advantages that these MEMS products provide.

9.5  Summary
Micromachining technology is used to produce micron-scale machines—movable 
structures—that are independently fascinating. If they can be interconnected for use 
in a microsystem, these devices have the potential to create new industries just as 
semiconductor technology has done. Several of the designs discussed in this chapter 
have already achieved production status working at a macro level in the system. 
MEMS devices at either the macro or micro level combined with sensors will pro­
vide new tools and improved performance as well as adding a unique smart aspect 
for control systems.

Packaging, Testing, and Reliability 
Implications of Smarter Sensors
Packaging was an afterthought for most MEMS designers and manufacturers only 
a few years ago.
—Micro and Nanotechnology Commercialization Education Foundation’s 
(MANCEF’s) Second Edition of International Micro-Nano Roadmap [1]
10.1  Introduction
All the advances and research occurring in micromachining would lead one to be­
lieve that breakthroughs in these areas will be sufficient to revolutionize sensing. 
Unfortunately, the problems associated with the basic sensor packaging are com­
pounded when the sensor is combined with higher levels of electronics. These prob­
lems initiate at the lowest level of die and wire bonding and extend to encapsulation, 
sealing, and lead forming issues. Fundamental assembly differences frequently exist 
between sensor and microelectronics packaging and are among the problems that 
are being solved to achieve smarter sensors. These differences include die bonding 
for stress isolation instead of for heat dissipation and wire bonding procedures.
Packaging is essential to establishing the reliability of the sensor. Therefore the 
reliability requirements must be taken into account in the design of the package, 
especially for custom packages in specific applications. Testing of the sensor and 
circuitry combination also requires combining test capability from both technolo­
gies. This chapter will address sensor packaging, especially technology from the 
semiconductor industry that is being applied to add the smarts and solve reliability 
and testing issues for smarter sensors.
10.2  Semiconductor Packaging Applied to Sensors
Many sensor packages in the late twentieth century resembled semiconductor 
packages of the 1980s or even the 1970s. The semiconductor industry and sensor 
manufacturers have made significant progress in high-density plastic encapsulated 
packages. The almost universal use of surface-mount technology (SMT) is among 

198 
�������������������������������������������������������������������
Packaging, Testing, and Reliability Implications of Smarter Sensors
the more important changes. To achieve increased functionality without increased 
silicon complexity, available silicon technologies are being combined at the pack­
age level in packages based on semiconductor, not module manufacturer, assembly 
techniques. These multichip modules (MCMs) are used for several applications, 
including automotive.
As the use of surface-mount technology increases, a decline has occurred in 
the use of the previously popular package. Other through-hole packages like single 
in-line plastic (SIP) and pin-grid array (PGA) will also decrease. Today, ball-grid 
array (BGA) and land-grid array (LGA) are predominately used for MEMS sensors. 
SMT approaches, such wafer-level packages (WLPs), wafer-level chip-scale pack­
ages (WLCSPs), stacked die, and 3-D packaging are the focus of present packaging 
development. For highly integrated components, packaging techniques must take 
into account more complex, system-level requirements as well as assembly require­
ments. The ability of the sensor industry to adapt to the newer semiconductor 
packaging approaches to sensors will determine the acceptance of smart sensor 
technology and the future growth of the industry.
The type of sensor, amount of circuitry, and application can change the cost 
significantly. The cost of an accelerometer in Figure 10.1 is based on a separate 
control chip and g-cell in an SMT package. The die cost in that case is 30% for 
the g-cell and 24% for the ASIC [2]. However, the greatest challenge with the ac­
celerometer for automotive air bag applications is inexpensive testing. Yole Dével­
oppement estimates that packaging, assembly, test, and calibration steps account 
for nearly 35% to 60% of a total MEMS packaged module’s cost [3]. For more 
complex packaging such as pressure sensor where media isolation is required, the 
cost of packaging, assembly, and testing can climb to 95% of the total cost.
Sensor packages have basic requirements that are similar to semiconductor 
devices. The variety of harsh sensor applications makes packaging more difficult 
than packaging for a semiconductor device. However, the basic package operations 
occur in similar order.
A completed sensor wafer has a final processing step that prepares it for pack­
aging [4]. This could include thinning the wafer and attachment of a backside 
metal such as a gold-silicon eutectic. Sensors tested at the wafer level that do not 
meet minimum specifications are identified as rejected units by an ink dot. Sensors 
are then separated into individual die from the wafer by sawing or scribe-and-
break techniques. Good sensor dice are placed in carriers that allow automatic

10.2  Semiconductor Packaging Applied to Sensors

pick-and-place machines to transfer dice from the carrier to the final package where 
a die bond attaches the sensor firmly to the package. Wire bonds connect the elec­
trical contacts on the die surface to the leads of the package that allow the sensor 
to interface to external components. The package is then sealed if it is metal or ce­
ramic, or encapsulated if it is molded plastic. Lead plating and trim (or singulation) 
occur next and are followed by marking and final test operations.
The actual design of the package must take into account sensitive areas of the 
semiconductor device and the sensor’s specific function. The following list [4] iden­
tifies characteristics that affect sensor packaging. The sensitivity of the semicon­
ductor to light must be minimized in packaging for an accelerometer but optimized 
for a photodiode. Similarly, the package’s sensitivity to stress must be taken into 
account during its design to prevent this stress from affecting the offset and sensi­
tivity in a stress-sensitive pressure sensor. For smart sensors, the key item in the list 
below, which shows the characteristics that affect sensor packaging, is the fact that 
integration level affects the sensor’s package.

A passivation layer that is deposited near the end of the wafer fabrication pro­

mon terms used to describe this layer. Silicon dioxide and silicon nitride doped with 
boron, phosphorus, or both are two materials used for the passivation process. For 
the semiconductor sensor, the mechanical properties of these layers must also be

Packaging, Testing, and Reliability Implications of Smarter Sensors
taken into account. For example, in silicon pressure sensors, implanted or diffused 
elements are protected by a passivation layer, but the diaphragm area is masked to 
avoid the dissimilar material interface and dampening effect that would be caused 
by the glass layer.
For semiconductor components, the package provides protection from the en­
vironment that can include moisture and gaseous or liquid chemicals. These pack­
ages are further protected in applications like automotive underhood-mounted 
modules by additional epoxy and silica potting compounds or conformal coatings 
(e.g., acrylics, polyurethane, silicone, and ultraviolet curing compounds) that cover 
the printed circuit to which the component is mounted. However, semiconduc­
tor sensors frequently have to interface to this environment. Pressure sensors, for 
example, that respond to static and dynamic pressures must have protection tech­
niques that allow the transmission of the pressure signal to the force collecting 
diaphragm with minimal damping and distortion of the signal. Distortion can be 
caused by compressible fluids. Additional protective materials for the die surface 
and the wire bonding connections, such as a compliant, thin conformal parylene 
coating or hydrostatic methyl-silicone gel, are frequently used as the means to 
transmit pressure to the top surface of the sensor. Parylene deposition is a vacuum 
process where the reactive vapor is passed over room temperature sensor and coats 
it with the polymer [5]. The equipment used to perform this process is quite sophis­
ticated, especially relative to gel coatings. The kind of media to which parylene and 
gel-protected sensors can be interfaced is limited by the properties of the protective 
material.
10.2.1  Increased Pin Count
One of the more difficult problems that must be solved when additional electronic 
circuitry is integrated with or interfaced to the sensor is the requirement for addi­
tional pinouts. Integrated circuits including MCUs have industry-accepted standard 
packages that allow a large number of pinouts. To increase the density in rapidly 
increasing surface-mounted applications, pin pitches at 50 µm and below are being 
pursued. Tape-automated bonding (TAB) is one of the technologies used to address 
fine pitch requirements, especially for the MEMS portion. Sensors, on the other 
hand, are usually limited to eight or fewer pins. Furthermore, the packaging varies 
considerably from manufacturer to manufacturer, with no standard form factor 
(Figure 10.2). The requirements for a mechanical interface for pressure, force, flow, 
or liquid level cause additional packaging problems.
Additional circuitry, whether it is simple signal conditioning or more sophisti­
cated approaches that include ASIC and microcontroller capabilities, has an impact 
on sensor packaging [7]. A “sensor only” versus integrated sensor plus control 
circuit is one level of differentiating packaging requirements. However, increased 
functionality through additional circuitry, either on the same chip or from a sepa­
rate chip included in the ultimate sensor package or module, affects the pin count, 
normally increasing the number of package pins. An exception occurs for simple 
amplification and temperature compensation circuits for pressure sensors, where 
the number of pinouts is actually reduced from four to three for piezoresistive 
sensors.

10.3  Hybrid Packaging 
201
10.3  Hybrid Packaging
Hybrid packages such as ceramic multichip packages are routinely used during 
the research and development of semiconductors and MEMS devices. This allows 
researchers to probe selected portions of the die and verify expected functionality, 
especially if the entire die is not performing to predicted performance levels. In 
some instances, hybrid packages are also used for production sensors.
10.3.1  Ceramic Packaging and Ceramic Substrates
Ceramic packages, such as the ceramic DIP (CERDIP) utilize a lead frame that is 
attached to the ceramic base through a glass layer. After die and wire bonding, a 
ceramic top is glass sealed to the base. This same technique is used for other form-
factor ceramic packages, including the ceramic flat pack. Ceramic packages are 
usually used for high-reliability applications and are much more expensive than 
other semiconductor packaging techniques. They are very useful in the develop­
ment phase of a sensor since the silicon die does not have to be encapsulated. This 
allows various test points on the die to be easily probed and measured in packaged 
form [8].
Ceramic technology is used in hybrid assembly techniques for sensors. The 
ceramic substrate, usually an aluminum oxide, provides a firm mounting platform 
for the sensor die. Stress isolation can be obtained by utilizing a compliant silicone 
for the die attachment. The ceramic substrate allows laser trimming of thick-film 
resistors deposited on the ceramic surface to provide the calibration for a signal-
conditioned sensor.
10.3.2  Multichip Modules 
The extensive advancements for packaging multichip microelectronics is also being 
evaluated and adapted for manufacturing combined sensor(s) and microelectronics.

and Control [6].)

Packaging, Testing, and Reliability Implications of Smarter Sensors
Figure 10.3 shows semiconductor packaging techniques that are being used for 
sensors [7]. These approaches include (a) conventional chip-and-wire, (b) flip-chip, 
and (c) TAB. Chip-and-wire is the standard die-on-substrate packaging technique. 
Flip-chip packaging will be discussed further in Section 10.4.3. TAB packaging 
eliminates wiring bonding from the die to a lead by directly attaching a lead to 
the top of the die. Any one of these methods can be used for multichip module 
packaging. 
For MCMs with one or more sensing elements and silicon ICs, silicon is a com­
mon substrate material. The approach of a silicon circuit board to achieve wafer-
level, hybrid integration is the most frequently used solution for combined sensor 
and ASIC/MCU. However, there are several varieties of MCMs depending mainly 
on the substrate technology: MCM-L, MCM-C, MCM-D, and MCM-Si are com­
mon classifications [9].
 An MCM-L, where the -L suffix stands for laminate, uses advanced printed 
circuit board technology, copper conductors, and plastic laminate-based dielectrics. 
This is essentially a chip-on-board, or COB, technology as shown in Figure 10.3(a). 
MCM-C uses thick film screening on cofired ceramic substrates. An MCM-D has 
interconnections formed by the thin-film deposition of metals on dielectrics of poly­
mers or inorganic compounds. MCM-Si uses a silicon substrate with aluminum or 
copper interconnections, and SiO2 as the inorganic dielectric media.
The yields for MCM modules can be lower than for assemblies made using 
packaged semiconductors. Known good die (KGD) techniques in the semiconduc­
tor industry are directed towards improving yields by improved testing at the wafer 
level. These same approaches are required for MCM sensors.
10.3.3  Dual-Chip Packaging
Custom packages that accommodate a sensor die and its associated signal condi­
tioning circuit are common for high-volume applications. In those instances, the 
volume justifies the development and tooling costs. An example of a gyroscope 
sensor package developed for automotive rollover detection is shown in Figure 
10.4 [10]. Both chip-level and packaged products are contained in the package. The 
two-chip approach has proven to be both cost-effective and flexible.
10.3.4  BGA Packaging
BGA packages are among the newer semiconductor packages that are also used 
for multichip smart sensors. For example, VTI Technologies’ three-axis low-power 
gyroscope uses a 3.0 × 3.0 × 88-mm3 BGA package. The unit’s flip-chip (see Section 
Figure 10.3  Bare die mounting techniques for MCMs.

10.4  Common Packaging for Sensors 
203
10.4.3) ASIC is mounted underneath the MEMS element and is visible on the bot­
tom side of the package. The capacitive sensor targets mobile phones, gaming input 
devices, and more.
10.4  Common Packaging for Sensors
The highest volume sensor packaging techniques utilize molded plastic packages 
with form factors that include SIP, DIP, quad flat packs and a variety of surface-
mount devices (SMDs) or surface-mount technology (SMT) packages. The lead 
frame and molding techniques used in plastic packages provide the lowest cost 
semiconductor packages. Improvements that have occurred include improved ca­
pability to withstand autoclave testing for improved hermeticity and the use of 
improved, low-stress mold compounds for surface-mount applications. However, a 
sensor that must physically interface with a mechanical system, such as a pressure 
sensor, presents additional packaging challenges.
Cylindrical TO-5 and TO-8 and other multipin metal-can semiconductor pack­
ages have been adapted for usage as sensor packages (see Figure 10.2). For pressure 
sensors, the lid and header of the package usually have a hole to allow the pressure 
source to be applied to the die and provide a pressure reference to atmosphere. The 
leads extend through the base of the package through glass mounting seals. The 
use of gold-plating material and hard die attachment to the glass substrate of the 
sensor provides one of the most media-compatible sensors. The metal lid is welded 
to the header, and pressure sensor port attachment is accomplished through solder, 
brazed, or weld techniques [8]. These packages are also used for accelerometers, 
optical devices, and other sensors.

Packaging, Testing, and Reliability Implications of Smarter Sensors
10.4.1  Plastic Packaging
Even though sensor packaging technology extensively uses semiconductor pack­
aging techniques, a specific sensor package can provide several areas of innova­
tion. For example, a plastic chip carrier package that uses lead frame technology 
has been used for manufacturing pressure sensors since the 1980s. A single mold 
forms both the body and back of the chip carrier. The unibody package provides 
lower cost, fewer process steps, higher pressure range capability, and greater media 
compatibility when compared to earlier versions that were made of separate body 
and metal backplate [8]. The lead frame assembly technique allows easy handling 
of several devices at one time and the automation of assembly operations such as 
die bond, wire bond, and gel-filling operations. Automation allows tight process 
controls to be implemented and still provides high throughput. 
One of the more difficult problems for sensors that interface to harsh environ­
ments is media compatibility. One approach to achieving a low-cost interface is 
shown in Figure 10.6.
10.4.2  Surface-Mount Packaging
Specifically designed surface-mounted sensor packages are used extensively in con­
sumer electronics products for accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and 
other inputs. In more complex sensors, the package may be a printed circuit board 
(PCB) assembly or ceramic substrate that exclusively uses surface-mount technol­
ogy. Figure 10.7 shows an example of a 13 × 13 × 2-mm ceramic substrate with 
five surface-mounted ICs, including a 32-bit MCU [12]. The sensors in the nine-
axis system-on-board design include an SMT packaged three-axis accelerometer 
and a six-axis geomagnetic module that integrates a three-axis accelerometer and a 
Figure 10.5  Plastic BGA package. (Courtesy of VTI Technologies Oy [11].)

10.4  Common Packaging for Sensors

three-axis magnetometer. As volume increases in these applications, increased inte­
gration and higher density multichip modules will allow smaller packaging.
10.4.3  Flip-Chip
Flip-chip packaging technology commonly used in integrated circuits is also used 
for sensors [13]. Flip-chip technology allows the electronics to be fabricated on one 
chip that can be attached to the MEMS chip through either a fluxless process or 
flux-assisted solder reflow process. This is an MCM-Si approach to combining dif­
ferent silicon processing technologies instead of increasing masking layers and die 
size to achieve a monolithic silicon solution.
An example of flip-chip technology in a standard IC process is shown in Figure 
10.8(a) [14]. This technology has been used in automotive and computer applica­
tions for several years. The solder bump is formed over plated copper at the wafer 
level. Several steps precede the actual formation of the bump. A passivation nitride 
is used to mask areas other than the aluminum-copper metal contact on the silicon 
die. Sputtered titanium tungsten (TiW) and copper are used to form a base metal 
for copper, lead, and tin, which are plated onto the base. Reflow in a gradually 
ramped oven causes a thermally induced amalgam of tin and lead to form into

a ball due to surface tension. Spacing of the bumps evenly around the die avoids 
stress during thermal expansion.
Figure 10.8 also shows how flip-chip technology can be applied to a sensor. 
The sensor is represented by a diaphragm structure but could be any microma­
chined structure. In one case, the sensor could be a flip-chip on a more complex 
IC such as an MCU. An alternate approach is to have the IC as a flip-chip on the 
MEMS structure. The requirements of the sensor must be considered when this 
type of packaging is developed.
10.4.4  Wafer-Level Packaging
Chapter 2 discussed surface micromachined structures sealed inside a two-layer 
bulk micromachined sensor package. This wafer-level chip scale packaging of 
MEMS sensors results in considerable cost savings over packaging methods that use 
metal can or ceramic packages. The process has demonstrated manufacturability 
and yields a well-protected, hermetic sensor device such as an accelerometer, gyro­
scope, and more. This technology has far-reaching implications and opens the door 
to new methods of low cost hermetic packaging over the more expensive methods. 
Protection of the two-layer structure has been accomplished with a molded plastic 
package for current products. Future protective packaging may take a different 
form.

sensor, and (d) bump structure itself.

10.4  Common Packaging for Sensors 
207
Epoxy protection for ICs has provided a low-cost packaging solution for con­
sumer electronics. The glob-top package shown in Figure 10.9(a) is simply an ep­
oxy mound that protects the die surface and wirebonds for an IC mounted on a 
circuit board. For flip-chips, a protective layer around the die is used as shown in 
Figure 10.9(b) [15]. In that case, the protection is from silicon to silicon with sensi­
tive layers sealed inside the epoxy. Lower-cost packaging will be essential for many 
new smart sensor applications. In some instances, adapting these approaches has 
provided the cost breakthrough.
10.4.5  3-D Packaging
Three-dimensional packaging is one of the current industry efforts for advanced 
packaging, including the sensors in the system. Driven by the increased use in con­
sumer electronics products, many suppliers are addressing the technology challenges 
that 3-D packaging poses. Figure 10.10 shows the market transition for MEMS 
packaging that one supplier expects to see to quad-flat no-leads (QFN) and BGA 
packages based on low-stress solutions that derived from existing high-volume lead 
frame and laminate-based package platforms. Amkor expects that the transition 
will lead to more standards for sensor packaging and a consolidation of the many 
current packages to fewer packages based on cavity and molded-platform designs.
Some production MEMS products use 3-D packages today. Figure 10.11 shows 
how the bulk micromachined MEMS structure in InvenSense IDG-300 dual-axis 
gyroscope gets directly bonded onto its CMOS circuitry [1]. The stacked structure 
takes advantage of the small sealing area that results from using the multilayer 
Figure 10.9  Epoxy protection for single die: (a) glob top, and (b) flip-chip. (After: [13].)

metal in the CMOS process. That allows a standard overmolding process for the 6 
× 6 × 1.4-mm package.
The semiconductor industry’s recent (since 1997) through-silicon via (TSV) 
technology enables the direct interconnection of stacked silicon processes at the 
wafer level and die level. Providing high density and high performance, the inter­
connection technique addresses a wide range of 3-D semiconductor industry pack­
aging requirements including MEMS and other sensors.
Approaches to TSV vary from company to company. For example, Silex Mi­
crosystems attributes its via first process as technology to enable true wafer-level 
packaging and MEMS designs with significantly reduced form factor [17]. Using 
the methodology described in Chapter 9, Silex says it avoids the metal routing 
and contact pad areas that consume a large portion of existing MEMS designs.

and interconnects a MEMS structure to a CMOS ASIC. (Courtesy of InvenSense [1].)

10.5  Reliability Implications 
209
Figure 10.12 shows an example of MEMS packaging with TSVs. A sub-50-µm 
pitch through substrate wafers as thick as 600 µm is possible.
Advanced semiconductor packaging for improved performance, reduced costs, 
and more is the focus of several industry, university, and government research pro­
grams. At the wafer level, IMEC, an independent research center, is developing a 
range of 3-D packages that could benefit MEMS companies [1]. In addition to 3-D 
system-in-a-package based on the classic packaging infrastructure, the company 
is addressing 3-D wafer-level-packaging based on the emerging wafer-level-pack­
aging infrastructure and 3-D stacked IC approaches based on foundry-level 3-D 
technology.
Georgia Tech researchers attribute only 20% of an electronics system’s cost 
and volume to silicon devices [18]. The remaining 80% includes passives, thermal 
structures, and batteries with their associated interconnections. This makes system 
packaging a critical area for research. Termed a 3D All Silicon System Module or 
3D ASSM at Georgia Tech, its researchers see MEMS packaging and sensors as an 
integral part of their 3-D system-level packaging concept.
10.5  Reliability Implications
Sensors require tests similar to those performed for ICs and unique qualification 
tests to verify that they will have acceptable performance of both the silicon and 
the packaging for their intended applications. For example, several tests have been 
developed for silicon pressure sensors that are based on the need to detect potential 
failures due to the environment in which these devices will operate. These tests have 
been used to qualify sensors with on-chip amplification. Key tests include, but are 
not limited to [19]:
••
Operational life, such as pulse and pressure-temperature cycling with bias;
••
High humidity, high temperature with bias;
••
High temperature with bias;
••
High and low temperature storage life;

••
Temperature cycling;
••
Mechanical shock;
••
Variable frequency vibration;
••
Solderability;
••
Backside blow-off (for pressure sensors);
••
Salt atmosphere.
These tests use accelerated life and mechanical integrity testing to determine 
the lifetime reliability statistics for silicon pressure sensors. Potential failure mecha­
nisms are determined by the materials, processes, and process variability that can 
occur in the manufacturing of a particular sensor. For example, the pressure sensor 
of Figure 10.13 has 10 product-related and 8 process-related areas with 73 differ­
ent items that can impact reliability [19]. Other sensors will have reliability test 
requirements that are commensurate with the application for which the sensor is 
being used and the type of packaging technique that is employed.
One approach for establishing media compatibility for sensors uses in situ 
monitoring [20]. A typical three-step approach for verifying media compatibility 
is (1) characterize, (2) expose to environment, and (3) retest for conformity to 
specification. That requires removing the sensor from the test environment and

10.5  Reliability Implications 
211
also changes the exposure of the sensor through the addition of oxygen prior to 
retest. Procedures have been developed that test the organic compounds used in the 
sensor’s packaging, the silicon sensing element, and the integrated circuitry in the 
sensor without removing the sensor from the test chamber. New sensor materials 
and modified packaging designs have been shown to survive in a variety of harsh 
media common to applications in automobiles and trucks. Previously a comparable 
confidence level would have been possible only after achieving millions of unit 
hours in the actual application.
10.5.1  The Physics of Failure
The sensor packaging problems specific to the application must be thoroughly 
addressed to ensure acceptable performance over the sensor’s expected lifetime. 
Identifying minimum expectations and critical application factors that limit device 
lifetime are part of a methodology known as the physics of failure approach to 
reliability testing [21]. The physic of failure involves analyzing the potential failure 
mechanisms and modes, as shown in Figure 10.14. Once these are understood, 
application-specific packaging development can proceed, the proper test conditions 
can be established, and critical parameters can be measured and monitored.
One key failure mechanism for sensors that operate in harsh media applica­
tions, for example pressure sensors, is corrosion, specifically galvanic corrosion 
caused by dissimilar metals that are in electrical contact in aqueous solutions. Us­
ing a physics of failure approach, researchers can ask the appropriate questions. 
Which environmental factors contribute to the failure mechanism? What acceler­
ates it? What should be done to the sensor package to prevent corrosion or mini­
mize its impact over the sensor’s lifetime? What is the expected sensor lifetime?
The answers to these questions allow simulations to be performed and costs to 
be analyzed before lengthy and potentially expensive testing is initiated. The test­
ing ultimately proves the acceptability of a particular proposal. Unless the proper 
mechanisms are known, overdesigning can add unnecessary cost to the packaging, 
such as a passivation layer, a hard die attachment, or any nonstandard process. 
Furthermore, the design trade-offs that result may not prove beneficial. For ex­
ample, adding a hard die attach to the pressure sensor to improve the strength of 
the die bond could limit device performance in other areas, such as temperature 
coefficient of offset [21].
The increasing complexity of systems demands that designers increasingly use 
automated design methodologies. This is especially true in automotive applica­
tions. Automotive safety applications require an even higher degree of scrutiny. 
Automotive industry requirements to apply functional safety as defined in ISO 
26262 “Road Vehicles—Functional Safety” has prompted one supplier to develop 
knowledge-based, automated design analysis (ADA) tools for performing phys­
ics of failure durability simulations and reliability assessments [22]. Figure 10.15 
shows the type of results that the program provides. While aimed at the overall 
electronic system, sensors can certainly benefit from the approach that provides 
identification of specific design risks early in the design process so cost-increasing 
problems can be solved at the early point.

Packaging, Testing, and Reliability Implications of Smarter Sensors
10.5.2  Wafer-Level Sensor Reliability
One of the inherent advantages of semiconductor sensors is their capability of in­
tegrating the signal conditioning, temperature compensation, and essentially any 
aspect of semiconductor fabrication on the same silicon substrate as the sensor. This 
allows wafer-level reliability to be implemented. Test structures on the wafer or 
monitor wafers allow evaluation of critical process steps as they occur and provide 
rapid feedback to detect and correct process errors. The cost of testing at the wafer 
level is considerably less than testing at the completed assembly level. As shown 
in Table 10.2 [23], the cost of evaluating critical process steps early in the wafer 
fabrication process provides a considerable cost reduction over testing performed 
after the assembly process is completed. The data is a comparison of semiconductor 
process testing only. However, packages such as flip-chip and KGD approaches to 
packaging common in the semiconductor industry can also be applied to sensors. 
Wafer-level reliability provides benefits for both the sensor manufacturer and the 
user.
Figure 10.14  Physics of failure methodology.

10.5  Reliability Implications 
213
Normal test techniques require packaged units and considerably more time for 
evaluation. End-of-life techniques require even longer testing to ensure that a prod­
uct life (e.g., 20 years) is achievable. For wafer-level testing, additional testing at 
the package level is required since packaging methods have a significant impact on 
the total reliability. However, wafer-level reliability testing is one of the ways that 
semiconductor sensors can continue to achieve lower product cost and continuous 
improvement.

10.6  Testing Smarter Sensors
Several issues occur for testing sensors that combine other semiconductor technol­
ogy. Since the ultimate smart sensor is a combination of a MEMS structure and an 
MCU, the challenges that this combination pose for testing increase. Challenges 
include, but are not limited to, different types of testing required, unique test equip­
ment, and multipass testing. To allow for a low-cost integrated solution, those is­
sues must be addressed [24].
The integration of a physical measurement function onto an already complex 
mixed-mode analog-digital chip such as an MCU with an integral ADC raises the 
need for an additional type of testing. If a pressure sensor is combined with an 
MCU, one of the more difficult testing situations occurs. Testing for the pressure 
sensor must be able to apply the physical medium being tested to the device and 
measure the response. Measuring the response to a physical stimulus is not a stan­
dard test for the semiconductor industry, especially under multiple temperatures. 
Standard testers can test the digital and analog portions of the MCU. The applica­
tion of a physical stimulus and the ability to heat and cool the device under test rap­
idly and accurately drives the need for a modified and unique tester. These testers 
are one-of-a-kind and are not available as standard equipment. Therefore, the cost 
of the tester is a large part of the final unit’s cost.
Not only are the testers expensive, but the throughput is limited. Limited 
throughput will cause increased cost to each part due to increased depreciation 
costs allocated to each device. The cost is further increased by the need for multi­
pass testing. For calibration, each part may require testing at least three different 
temperatures to determine the transducer’s output characteristics over temperature. 
These values are then used to derive the compensation algorithm that is loaded 
into the on-chip memory. To complete the cycle, the device is once again tested 
over temperature to confirm the accuracy. Therefore, not only is a special tester 
required, but it becomes a bottleneck since it must be used twice to complete each 
device—once to measure the characteristics and a second time to verify the result.
Finding ways to reduce the cost of testing is one of the key challenges for a low-
cost integrated sensor and MCU combination. Ideas to consider include a thorough 
characterization of the design, limiting the operating temperature, limiting the ac­
curacy, programming the MCU to take data during testing, and loading the test and 
compensation algorithm into the MCU prior to testing.
10.7  Application Example
One of the high-volume applications for unique sensor packaging occurs in the 
automotive tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). The U.S. National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Transportation Recall Enhancement, Ac­
countability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act requires new vehicles weighing 
up to 10,000 pounds to include TPMS technology after model year 2008. The 
regulation seeks to reduce accidents caused by improperly inflated tires. Based on 
increased safety as well as improved efficiency from properly inflated tires, require­
ments for TPMS are increasing in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

10.8  Summary 
215
One supplier’s highly integrated solution includes a surface micromachined 
capacitive pressure sensor, an 8-bit MCU, an RF transmitter, and a two-axis ac­
celerometer in a single SOIC package [25]. Figure 10.16 shows the sensor system-
in-package with selective encapsulation media protection for the pressure-sensing 
portion.
Capacitive pressure sensor technology was chosen for ultralow power con­
sumption and precise sensing [27]. Acceleration sensors detect whether the car is 
moving to save power, wheel speed, and/or direction of rotation. The single-pack­
age solution was designed to reduce development cycle time, component count, 
and system cost.
10.8  Summary
As smarter sensing technology is developed, ASIC, MCU, or DSP capabilities are in­
cluded with the sensor. Today, the multichip components add an increased number 
of pins to the other sensor packaging requirements. However, all the justification 
for future cost-effectiveness of semiconductor-based sensors is predicated on these 
sensors following the learning curve similar to semiconductors. Plastic packaging 
has been essential for the cost-effective, high-volume requirements of consumer 
electronics sensor applications. To continue the progress in this area, packaging 
standards must be aggressively pursued to overcome the plethora of packages that 
exist today. Furthermore, sensor packages must be standardized for test equipment 
(handlers) and second sources. Sensor packaging draws heavily from both semicon­
ductor and hybrid packages, but new techniques that are unique to smart sensors 
will continue to be developed to meet future requirements.

Mechatronics and Sensing Systems
Even with a high level of integration, sensor designers need to think outside the 
chip to develop an effective system solution.
—Roger Grace 
11.1  Introduction
To achieve the highest level of smart sensing, essentially the entire system including 
the software will become a sensing system or an extension of sensing capability. The 
term mechatronics is frequently used to describe system design for a combination 
of electromechanical components. Computers or microcontrollers are an integral 
part of many mechatronic systems. Mechatronics has been defined as the synergistic 
combination of precision mechanical engineering, electronic control, and the sys­
tems approach for designing products and manufacturing processes [1].
Mechatronics represents a higher level of sophistication and complexity, re­
quiring designing at the interface of the electromechanical system. In some ways, 
mechatronics is similar to analog-to-digital interface, only more complex. Although 
engineers from different disciplines share their results on a particular program, 
each engineer works with a less-than-perfect understanding of how his or her de­
sign decision affects decisions of his or her counterpart. Mechatronics and other 
approaches, such as concurrent engineering, are attempting to understand design 
trade-offs earlier in the design process in order to reduce design cycle time and en­
sure that the final product meets the design criteria. Mechatronics combined with 
micromachining and smart sensors enables the design and fabrication of complete 
microsystems within a semiconductor-type package and ultimately within a single 
monolithic chip.
11.1.1  Integration and Mechatronics
The need for increased control capability in electronic systems is driving increased 
levels of integration in semiconductor electronics, including sensors. A fully inte­
grated silicon system is frequently cited as a goal for the ultimate system. Silicon 

220 
��������������������������������
Mechatronics and Sensing Systems
integration is certainly progressing towards this capability, especially for selected 
portions of systems. However, the cost and performance capabilities of higher levels 
of integration must compete against the components that they would displace. Also, 
design flexibility and use in several applications must be considered. This includes 
diverse requirements such as satisfying both domestic and international require­
ments, or simultaneously meeting cost-sensitive low-end specifications and also 
providing feature-sensitive high-end products. Furthermore, safety and reliability 
concerns, such as the potential failure modes from a system failure-mode-and-effect 
analysis (FMEA) can lead to more distributed intelligence when single point failures 
cannot be tolerated. In some cases, the system constraints make it desirable to have 
sensing and power control elements remote, or at least separated, from the micro­
controller that is controlling the system. This allows improved power dissipation, 
fault detection, and protection from system voltage extremes [2].
System partitioning and the determination of how much integration should 
occur within each component are decisions that should be made by an interac­
tive design team composed of both system and silicon designers. Integration for 
the output section of the control system is frequently called a smart-power IC. 
These integrated solutions have been in volume production by several manufactur­
ers since the mid-80s. Understanding their contribution to the control system, and 
how they take advantage of embedded sensing in both normal operation and fault 
modes, is essential to achieve the systems approach and implement mechatronics 
methodology. This chapter will examine smart-power ICs and systems aspects of 
mechatronics.
11.2  Smart-Power ICs
Smart-power ICs and power ICs (PICs) typically combine bipolar and MOS cir­
cuitry with power MOSFET technology to provide direct interface between the 
MCU and system loads such as solenoids, lamps, and motors. Smart-power ICs 
are defined by the Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) as “hybrid 
or monolithic devices that are capable of being conduction cooled, perform signal 
conditioning, and include a power control function such as fault management and/
or diagnostics. The scope [of this definition] shall apply to devices with a power 
dissipation of 2W or more, capable of operating at a case temperature of 100°C 
and with a continuous current of 1A or more.” Smart-power devices also provide 
increased functionality as well as sophisticated diagnostics and protection circuitry. 
Sensing of current levels and junction temperature is a key aspect of the design for 
control during normal operation and for detecting several fault modes.
The power in smart-power ICs is typically a power MOSFET or diffused MOS 
(DMOS) device. The size of this portion of the silicon area is determined by the 
process technology, voltage rating, and desired on-resistance. Process technology 
determines the on-resistance per unit area and has provided improvements based 
on reducing the cell size and improving cell geometry. The voltage rating inversely 
affects efficiency—a higher voltage rating means a higher on-resistance for a given 
area for the power device and lower efficiency. For a given process and voltage 
rating, the number of cells is increased to meet on-resistance specification. Since 

11.2  Smart-Power ICs 
221
increased silicon area directly impacts the cost, the highest on-resistance to allow 
safe power dissipation in the system is normally specified.
The smart-power approach to system design means that a number of circuit 
elements can be consolidated into one single device. These devices would previ­
ously have been discrete components; or a combination of standard, or custom IC, 
and discrete output devices. As illustrated in Figure 11.1, input, frequently from a 
microcontroller, initiates the start-up or turn-on procedure. The control can have 
circuitry for soft start function or charge pump circuitry for increasing the gate 
drive voltage. A high degree of functionality is achieved by smart-power ICs due to 
the interaction between the control circuit, power device, protection circuitry, and 
the load. Multiple power devices on one single chip are the most cost-effective uses 
of this technology. This provides space-saving, component reduction, total system 
cost reduction, improved performance, and increased reliability from the reduced 
number of interconnections.
Historically, the choice of process technology for smart-power ICs has depend­
ed on the type of control elements that were integrated. Some circuit elements, 
like op amps, comparators, and regulators are best implemented using a bipolar 
IC process. MOS circuitry handles logic, active filters (time delays), and current 
mirrors better than bipolar circuitry. Some circuits, such as ADCs or power ampli­
fiers, can be implemented equally well in either technology. A process that has both 
MOS and bipolar for the control circuitry does not have to sacrifice performance 
or features; if it is combined with the appropriate output devices, the process can 
handle the power control functions for a number of system loads. However, just as 
a smart sensor needs to fully utilize the capability of a more expensive process, a 
smart-power IC must also provide advantages beyond those that separate control 
IC and discrete power devices can provide. One of the key means to achieving in­
creased functionality is to integrate sensing into the smart-power IC.

11.3  Embedded Sensing 
Sensing in smart-power ICs detects fault conditions and threshold conditions, and 
this allows implementation of control strategies. Overtemperature, overcurrent, 
and overvoltage conditions can be sensed, and the smart-power IC can be designed 
to react or simply provide a signal to the MCU for system-safe operation. This sec­
tion explores the different sensing techniques and applications of the sensed signal.
11.3.1  Temperature Sensing
Temperature sensors can be easily produced in semiconductor devices by using 
either the temperature characteristics of Vbe or a diffused resistor. In addition, 
circuitry is easily integrated to produce a monolithic temperature sensor with an 
output that can be easily interfaced to a microcontroller. By using an embedded 
temperature sensor, additional features can be added to ICs. (Note that a sensor 
becomes an embedded item in a semiconductor product when it has a secondary 
instead of primary function.)
Sensing for fault conditions, such as a short circuit, is an integral part of many 
smart-power ICs. The ability to obtain temperature sensors in mixed bipolar-
CMOS-DMOS semiconductor process provides protection and diagnostics as part 
of the features of smart-power ICs. The primary function of the power IC is to 
provide a microcontroller-to-load interface for solenoids, lamps, and motors. In 
multiple-output devices, sensing the junction temperature of each device allows the 
status of each device to be input to the microcontroller, and, if necessary, the MCU 
can shut down a particular unit that has a fault condition [3].
In ICs, the temperature limit can be sensed by establishing a bandgap reference. 
Two diodes’ junctions are biased with different current densities, but the ratio is 
essentially constant over the operating temperature range (-40°C to 150°C). The 
following equation shows how the differential voltage (∆Vbe) is related to the cur­
rent (I) and emitter area (A) of the respective transistors:

where kB is Boltzman’s constant (1.38 × 10-23 J/K), T is the temperature in K, and 
q is the charge of an electron (1.6 × 10-19 C).
At a targeted high temperature, the negative temperature coefficient of Vbe 
equals the positive temperature coefficient voltage developed across a sense resis­
tor, and a thermal limit signal is generated. Other circuitry regulates the voltage 
and turns off the output power device. 
A smart-power IC can have multiple power drivers integrated on a single 
monolithic piece of silicon. Each of these drivers can have a temperature sensor in­
tegrated to determine the proper operating status and shut off only a specific driver 
if a fault occurs. Figure 11.2 shows an eight-output driver that independently shuts 
down the output of a particular driver if its temperature is excessive (between 
155°C to 185°C). 

11.3  Embedded Sensing  
223
The octal serial switch (OSS) adds thermal sensing through overtemperature 
detection circuitry to the protection features. Faults can be detected for each output 
device and individual shutdown can be implemented. In a multiple output power 
IC it is highly desirable to shut down only the device that is experiencing a fault 
condition and not all of the devices that are integrated on the power IC. With out­
puts in various physical locations on the chip, it is difficult to predict the thermal 
gradients that could occur in a fault situation. Local temperature sensing at each 
output, instead of a single global temperature sensor, is required.
As shown in Figure 11.3, the eight outputs of the device have individual tem­
perature sensors that allow each device to turn off independently when the thermal 
limit of 170°C is exceeded. All of the outputs were shorted to 16V supply at a room 
temperature ambient. A total current of almost 30A initially flowed through the 
device. Note that each device turns off independently. The hottest device turns off 
first. Variations can result from differences in current level and thermal efficiencies. 
As each device turns off, the total power dissipation in the chip decreases and the 
devices that are still on heat up slower.
This hard short could have been diagnosed by short circuit (current limit) sens­
ing. However, a soft short, which by definition is below the current limit, but ex­
ceeds the power dissipating capability of the chip, can be an extremely difficult

Mechatronics and Sensing Systems
condition to detect. Soft shorts require overtemperature sensing to protect the IC 
from destructive temperature levels.
The overtemperature condition sensed by the power IC may mean that the de­
vice turns itself off to prevent failure in one case; and in another situation, a fault 
signal provides a warning to the MCU but no action is taken depending on the fault 
circuit design. The remaining portion of the system is allowed to function normally. 
With the fault conditions supplied to the MCU, an orderly system shutdown can 
be implemented.
Temperature sensing has also been integrated into a standard power MOSFET 
process. The power MOSFET process was chosen instead of a power IC process 
because a large die size was required to meet the power dissipation requirements of 
a very cost-sensitive automotive application. A minor modification (the addition of 
a single masking layer) to a production power MOSFET process allows both sens­
ing and other protection features to be integrated.
The thermal sensing is provided by integrated polysilicon diodes. By monitor­
ing the output voltage when a constant current is passed through the diode(s), an 
accurate indication of the maximum die temperature can be obtained. A number 
of diodes are actually provided in the design. A single diode has a temperature 
coefficient of 1.90 mV/°C. Two or more can be placed in series if a larger output 
is desired. For greater accuracy, the diodes can be trimmed during the wafer probe 
process by blowing fusible links made from polysilicon.
The response time of the temperature sensing diodes is less than 100 µs, which 
has allowed the power device to withstand a direct short across an automobile 
battery. The sensor’s output was applied to external circuitry that provided shut­
down prior to device failure. The sensing capability also allows the output device 
to provide an indication (with additional external circuitry) if the heatsinking is not 
proper when the unit is installed in a module, or if a change occurs in the applica­
tion that would ultimately cause a failure. Because of its importance to extreme op­
erating conditions and fault survival, temperature sensing has become a common, 
and in most cases a required aspect of smart-power ICs.

escale Semiconductor.)

11.3.2  Current Sensing in Power ICs
Current sensing provides protection and control in power ICs. A device that dem­
onstrates this approach is shown in Figure 11.4 [4]. The circuit (Figure 11.4(a)) 
includes a voltage regulator, oscillator, and charge pump to provide a high side 
switch with an N-channel power MOSFET. This custom device has multiple current 
sensing levels for control and fault detection (Figure 11.4(b)). The current sensing 
technique uses a sample of the current flowing through the total power MOSFET 
cells, the ratio of the number of sample cells to control cells, as an indication of the 
total current. A resistor in series with the sense cells, which handles considerably 
lower current, provides a voltage proportional to the current in the power device. 
This technique avoids adding a series resistance to the total on-resistance and the 
subsequent power consumption, which could be excessive for an integrated circuit. 
The isolated sensing cells for four different current sensing levels are inside the four 
“lassoed” areas (left side, lower section in the cell area) in Figure 11.4(b). The high­
est current level could trigger an overcurrent fault and the lower levels can be used 
for system-specific control points. Similar to the temperature sensing, current sens­
ing has become a common, and in many cases, required aspect of smart power ICs.
11.3.3  Diagnostics
The eight-output driver with serial communications shown in Figure 11.2 repre­
sents a high level of complexity for diagnostics. Control and sensing of the faults 
of individual output drivers could require over 24 connections for eight output 
drivers. By using a SPI protocol described in Chapter 6, 8-bit serial control of the 
output and independent diagnostics are possible with only three connections. The

Mechatronics and Sensing Systems
SPI operates at a frequency of up to 2 MHz and utilizes the low-voltage, high-speed 
CMOS capability in the power IC process. With both the input and the output tied 
directly to the MCU, the unit acts as a closed loop subsystem between the load and 
the MCU for each load. By using a daisy-chain technique, several additional devices 
can be added to the control capability. A total of 32 outputs are controlled with 
only four connections to the MCU.
A high level of smart-power IC device complexity is demonstrated in a parallel-
serial control. This device has six outputs that can be selected independently on six 
dedicated parallel input pins by an input command (voltage above Vth) from an 
MCU. Inputs 0 and 1 and 4 and 5 can also be simultaneously selected. This allows 
the two output devices to be connected in parallel for reducing the on-resistance. 
Parallel control provides the fastest activation of the loads, which allows real-time 
control using pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques. The drawback is the 
highest number of connections must be made and the highest number of traces 
must be routed on the printed circuit board. Serial control of the six outputs is also 
possible using a SPI interface, as described earlier. Mixed control of the outputs can 
be achieved with various combinations of parallel and serial control of the outputs.
Fault diagnostics and control are similar to those in the octal serial switch. 
However, an advanced SPI interface provides serial diagnostic information to the 
MCU, which includes immediate parity checking (nth word) to confirm that the 
smart-power IC received the word sent by the MCU. In the initial SPI implementa­
tion (the OSS), fault reporting is performed in the n-1 word. The present command 
to the OSS is compared to the outputs from the previous word to determine the 
status. The time of the active filter period, which can be several clock cycles, is re­
quired before the next word can determine if a fault exists. The advanced SPI uses 
an exclusive OR to provide fault information when the current word is written.
Automotive applications have required diagnostics beyond those typically 
found in smart-power ICs. For example, U.S. on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) leg­
islation requires that the actual movement of the pintle in transmission solenoids 
be monitored when the output device is activated. This is done to indicate that the 
transmission is in the proper gear and that the torque converter has full lockup. 
Simply sensing the current going through the output device is insufficient to deter­
mine that the pintle has moved as a result of the output device being turned on. The 
differential sensing circuit in Figure 11.5(a) is used to detect the change that occurs 
when the solenoid’s armature is attracted into the winding. The negative slope, 
shown in the current waveform in Figure 11.5(b), is an indication of the physical 
movement. Either low-side or high-side sensing can be performed with low-pass 
filters, high-pass filters, and a comparator providing the signal conditioning. The 
event counter can be adjusted from 15 to 64 to establish the confidence level of 
detecting movement. The on-resistance of the power driver can be used as a sense 
resistor to convert the current into a voltage level. A peak detector can also be used 
to detect the peak in Figure 11.5(a). The results can be reported on a serial SPI or 
with parallel fault reporting. The OBD-II diagnostic adds one more aspect to the 
fault sensing/detection capability of smart-power ICs. Table 11.1 shows a summary 
of the faults that can be detected [2].
Fault reporting techniques and corresponding MCU commands to the smart-
power IC can be accomplished by several methods. For new devices the most ap­
propriate communication technique is dictated by the application requirements.

Mechatronics and Sensing Systems
The communication techniques that are available as building blocks are summa­
rized in Table 11.2 [2].
For distributed control systems both smart-sensing and smart-power nodes 
are required. Smart-power ICs combined with an MCU or MCUs with integrated 
power devices implement the load control. This means that the power or output 
side of the system must also be able to communicate using the system protocol. 
The protocols discussed in Chapter 6 must take into account the power portion of 
the system. For a power node to be added to an existing system, it must have the 
appropriate protocol to operate on the system.
11.3.4  MEMS Relays
Electrostatic and electromagnetic MEMS relays have been produced using micro­
machining processes. Magnetically actuated relays can achieve larger forces and 
a greater air gap between contacts than electrostatic designs [5]. The larger gap 
provides greater isolation for applications at higher voltages. Micromachining pro­
cesses use to produce the microrelay include surface micromachining and poly­
imide-mold electroplating techniques. The electromagnetic relays operate below 5V 
so they can be directly interfaced to a MCU or DSP. The relays have been operated 
850,000 cycles without failing. The combination of this adaptation of mechanical 
technology with micromachining, sensing, and MCU and DSP technology should 
provide some useful mechatronic solutions.
To provide a smaller and lower power relay than magnetic techniques allow, 
while avoiding the high-voltage requirements of electrostatic designs, Advantest 
uses piezoelectric technology in its MEMS relay [6]. The relay’s 1-µm-thick piezo­
electric film enables operation at a low actuation voltage. It can handle a high-
frequency transmission of up to 20 GHz. Sampling in 2012, mass production of the 
MEMS relays is planned for January 2013. More extensive production of MEMS 
relays should add to the system designer’s arsenal of tools for smart sensor systems.
11.4  Other System Aspects
The smart sensor system requires additional components to provide a self-contained 
unit. Current developments would allow batteries and displays to be integrated

with the sensor. Any item mentioned in Chapter 8 and 9 might also be part of this 
integration—if the packaging problems discussed in Chapter 10 are solved. These 
components, combined with smart sensors, digital logic from an MCU or DSP, 
and smart-power ICs, will enable a number of new mechatronics approaches. One 
system aspect that must be addressed by one of these areas is the catastrophic effect 
that electrostatic discharge (ESD), system voltage transients, and EMI can have on 
electronic components. Those factors are covered in Section 11.4.3.
11.4.1  Batteries
Portable applications have generated considerable system design activity to obtain 
extended performance and improved life from the batteries that power these sys­
tems. By including semiconductor components in the battery, a smart battery is 
created. A smart battery is a battery or battery pack with specialized hardware 
and software that provides information regarding the state of charge and calcu­
lates predicted run time [7]. Information regarding the type of battery chemistry 
and the battery-pack voltage, capacity, and physical packaging is conveyed by a 
protocol to power-related devices in the system. The system can provide control 
to a smart battery or batteries, a smart battery charger, and various regulators and 
switches. Other battery charging efforts are directed at eliminating the memory-
effect in nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, reducing the charging cycle time, and 
avoiding overcharging, which reduces battery life. Portable data acquisition systems 
and remote sensing devices will benefit when smart batteries are incorporated into 
their design.
Reduced battery size through thin-film manufacturing technology will also im­
pact sensors. A thin-film solid-state Li/TiS2 microbattery has been reported that has 
properties suitable for long-life rechargeable applications [8]. The microbatteries 
range in size from 8 to 12 µm in thickness and have a capacity between 35 and 
100 µA-hrs/cm2. The open-circuit voltage is approximately 2.5V. Batteries have 
been cycled over 10, 000 cycles at 100 µA/cm2. Microbatteries routinely withstood 
1,000 cycles between 1.4 and 2.8V at current densities as high as 300 µA/cm2.
Any reasonably smooth surface is a potential substrate for the thin-film bat­
tery. A chromium, TiS2, and solid electrolyte layer are sputtered onto the substrate. 
LiI, Li, and a protective coating are vapor-deposited over the sputtered layers. The 
construction technique will allow the microbattery to be incorporated with many 
semiconductor devices, including microsensors, during their manufacture.
Photopatterned carbon that is subsequently heat-treated at various tempera­
tures has been explored for its potential in MEMS devices [9]. The material pro­
duced by this process permits a variety of new MEMS applications through new 
shapes, resistivities, and mechanical properties. Carbon surfaces can be used to 
form electrochemical electrodes with deposition of a wide variety of organic mol­
ecules. Polymeric batteries have been developed using the photopatterned carbon 
and surface micromachining. More recent information on chip-level batteries is 
covered in Chapter 15. Batteries compatible with MEMS processes or capable of 
being copackaged with MEMS devices based on their small size and other factors 
will change the way that designers configure sensing and other systems.

Efficient low-power displays are an essential part of many systems, including por­
table digital assistants, virtual reality-driven robots, and automotive global posi­
tioning systems. These displays communicate information from the machine to the 
operator. Currently, active matrix liquid crystal displays are the dominant tech­
nology, but flat panel displays and an emerging technology called field emission 
displays (FEDs) are potential replacements in several areas. FEDS produce light 
using colored phosphors. They do not need complicated, power-consuming back­
lights and filters, and almost all light is visible to the user. In addition, no power is 
consumed by pixels in the off state. An FED consists of an array of microtips that 
are micromachined into a substrate. Metal, silicon, and diamond are being investi­
gated for the microtips. One approach using MEMS technology and silicon as the 
backplane has been analyzed for its potential to be cost-competitive versus other 
approaches [10]. The display is an array of field emitters on 0.9-µm centers used to 
provide a phase grating. The phase grating is operated by electrically controlling the 
mechanical positions of the grating elements to modulate the diffraction of light. 
The evaluation showed this MEMS approach to be very promising since it uses a 
simpler process and half the MEMS masking-steps of digital micromirrors (see Sec­
tion 9.3.5). Successful implementation of this or any of other CMOS-based imaging 
approaches being investigated for displays will provide additional possibilities for 
a sensor-to-operator interface.
11.4.3  System Voltage Transients, Electrostatic Discharge, and 
Electromagnetic Interference
Surviving voltage transients, electrostatic discharge, and electromagnetic interfer­
ence are common application requirements, especially in the automotive environ­
ment. The ability to withstand a load dump is the prime factor in defining the 
voltage capability of semiconductor devices used in automotive applications. The 
load-dump transient is a high voltage (>100V in an unsuppressed system) high-
energy transient generated by disconnecting the battery from the alternator when 
the engine rpm is high and the alternator is generating a high-level output. Tech­
niques of handling load dump include (1) squelching the energy from an excessively 
high-voltage input (>60V) by turning on an active clamp until the energy decays 
(few hundreds of milliseconds), and (2) designing the output devices to withstand 
high voltage without turning on. The latter approach is done with an increase in 
the resistance of each output device and therefore causes more power dissipation 
under normal operating conditions. This technique must be used for high voltage 
(>100V) pulses to avoid excessive power dissipation during the load dump. A third 
alternative uses the circuitry in the smart-power device to turn the output on for a 
period of time (about 80 ms) when an overvoltage occurs. The input is time filtered 
before sampling to determine if the gate drain clamp should be turned on again [2].
Semiconductor sensor designs and applications have a system requirement that 
is normally not a problem in presemiconductor mechanical sensors; namely, ESD. 
Automotive and other applications generate high levels of electrostatic discharge 
(ESD) during manufacturing or in service. As a result, automotive manufacturers 
specify some of the most stringent ESD testing to qualify components. Automotive 

11.4  Other System Aspects 
231
module manufacturers are indicating that future specifications will require any IC 
pin that is accessible outside the module to withstand 10-kV electrostatic discharge 
with 250-pF and 1500-ohm load. This means that peak currents approaching 7A 
and energy levels in the 12.5 to 14 millijoules (mJ) range must be tolerated. The 
output connections of sensors, power, and control circuitry can be exposed to elec­
trostatic discharge during assembly or operation [2].
Sensors must be designed to meet levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI) 
commonly found in the application or required by industry specifications. EMI is 
a disturbance or malfunction of equipment or systems caused by the operation of 
other equipment or systems, or by the forces of nature. Distributed control sys­
tems can be susceptible to high frequency switching that is common in comput­
ers, switching power supplies, and power control. Figure 11.6 shows an industrial 
process control with ground loops and other EMI paths [11]. Sensors can be easily 
affected, depending on the wiring. Isolating the wiring, avoiding ground loops, and 
in some cases uses shielded wiring may be necessary to avoid problems.
In automotive applications, some manufacturers require the sensor to with­
stand electric fields of magnitude up to 200 V/m in the engine compartment and 
up to 50 V/m in the passenger compartment [12]. Performance levels and mea­
surement methods are defined in a number of Society of Automotive Engineers 
(SAE) documents including SAE J551, SAE J1816, SAE J1113, SAE J1407, and 
SAE J1338. Classifications of failure mode severity are provided in SAE J1812.
An example of automotive testing for EMI is demonstrated by the qualification 
testing for a plastic-packaged integrated pressure sensor. The testing required per­
formance at 200 V/m radiated immunity—from 10 kHz to 1 GHz. This is one of 
the higher signal strength levels that specified in automotive standards. However, 
Figure 11.6  EMI in process control system. (After: [11].)

required performance depends on the customer specification. Over 30 EMI specifi­
cations have been reported for engine control applications around the world; there 
is no common standard [13]. The following field characteristics were defined:
••
Field strength = 200 V/m;
••
Frequency range = 1 kHz to 1 GHz;
••
Modulation = AM, 30% with 1-kHz sine wave;
••
Polarity = vertical and horizontal;
••
Criteria for acceptable performance of device under test (DUT): alternating 
current (AC) ripple = ≤ ±50 mV.
Testing results included (1) passing the test and (2) finding that the test setup 
played a significant role in defining the device response and real susceptibility. Fur­
thermore, due to the number of specifications that exist and to verify acceptable 
performance of product in the plastic package for two specific applications, ad­
ditional tests were conducted. A product exposed to an extreme amount of EMI 
is encountered in a direct RF injection test. Direct RF injection is performed by 
soldering the harness to an impedance network. A 100-V/m signal was injected 
directly into the leads of the plastic-packaged sensor. To pass the test, a filter tech­
nique was developed that greatly improved the performance of a plastic-packaged 
integrated pressure sensor even under the toughest testing including the direct RF 
injection test. 
Since the ability to withstand overvoltage and EMI/EMC compatibility are re­
quired in many applications, this system aspect will be essential as sensors embrace 
more system aspects.
11.5  Application Example
Increasingly stringent systems requirements dictate new approaches to safety and 
other critical applications. System-level integration of a separate power IC and an 
MCU have addressed the redundancy and failsafe aspects of automotive safety sys­
tems as required by ISO 26262. The two separate chips work together to meet au­
tomotive safety integrity level (ASIL)-D requirements [14]. Built-in self-test (BIST), 
short-circuit detection, integrated watchdog timers, a redundant power supply, 
and an SPI protocol checker and are among the system solutions in the two chips 
to meet the ISO standard. Figure 11.7 shows the specific semiconductor elements 
implemented in the two system ICs (referenced D.1 to D.10 as in the Annex D of 
ISO 26262-5:2011(E)) to meet the requirements of the standard. With the role that 
MEMS sensors play in automotive safety systems, experts expect that the sensors 
will have to meet the ISO 26262 requirements as well [15]. The shared resources 
approach could provide one of the solutions.

11.6  Summary

11.6  Summary
The control of the output portion of the system made possible by smart-power ICs 
has been discussed. This technology combined with smart sensors and computing 
technology is part of mechatronics—a holistic approach to the system. New devel­
opments in batteries and display technology are redefining the sensor. Advances in 
all of these areas will contribute to new generations of smarter sensing and smart 
sensing systems that are interactive sensing networks, especially if potential system 
problems are taken into account early in the design process. The complete micro­
system is a promise that may be fulfilled in the future.

Standards for Smart Sensing
Without standards, the smart capability and the value of sensors will be limited in 
networking applications. However, with standards, smart sensors will allow users 
to break the network barriers by enabling them to access and share data obtained 
via different network protocols. 
—Kang Lee, National Institute of Standards and Technology
12.1  Introduction
Ongoing industry efforts have focused on the definition, functionality, and commu­
nication standards for smart sensors for several years. The goal is interoperability in 
a wide range of primarily industrial applications. The smart sensor, with appropri­
ate local decision-making capability, can act as a stand-alone sensor, communicate 
in a peer-to-peer relationship to other sensors and actuators, or act as an intelligent 
node in a network. Interoperability allows the implementation of various interfaces 
across different networks for network-independent operation. Such effort was ex­
pected to expedite the development and transition to networked smart transducers 
as well as development and commercialization efforts for smart sensors and smart 
actuators. While continuous progress has been made in the standards area, industry 
acceptance and implementation has lagged. However, as companies face the need 
to overcome network barriers, standards should play a critical role in that process.
12.2  Setting the Standards for Smart Sensors and Systems
The IEEE and the National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST) initiated 
an activity in 1993 that has led to the definition of development of seven accepted 
standards and one proposed standard [1–3]:
••
IEEE Std. 1451.0-2007, Common Functions, Communication Protocols, 
and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats;
••
IEEE Std 1451.1-1999, IEEE Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for 
Sensors and Actuators-Network Capable Application Processor Information 
Model;

IEEE Std 1451.2-1997, IEEE Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for 
Sensors and Actuators-Transducer to Microprocessor Communication Pro­
tocols and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats;

••

Sensors and Actuators—Mixed-Mode Communication Protocols and Trans­
ducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) Formats;
••

sors & Actuators—Wireless Communication Protocols & Transducer Elec­
tronic Data Sheet (TEDS); 
••
IEEE P1451.6, Draft Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sensors 
and Actuators—A High-speed CANopen based Transducer Network Inter­
face for Intrinsically Safe and Non-intrinsically Safe Applications; 
••
IEEE 1451.7-2010, IEEE Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface for Sen­
sors and Actuators—Transducers to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
Systems Communication Protocols and Transducer Electronic Data Sheet 
Formats.
The dates after the standards indicate when each was accepted as a full-use 
standard. IEEE 1451.6 does not have final approval.
A number of new terms and acronyms were developed to deal with the ele­
ments of smart sensors in an interoperable network. The Transducer Electronic 
Data Sheet (TEDS) is a machine-readable specification of the characteristics of the 
transducer interface [4]. A smart transducer interface module (STIM) includes the 
TEDS, the supporting electronics including the transducer on the transducer side 
of the hardware interface to network-capable application processor (NCAP). The 
NCAP is a device that supports a network interface, application functionality, and 
general access to the physical world via one or more transducers. A transducer in­
dependent interface (TII) is a 10-wire digital communication interface that allows 
an NCAP or host to obtain sensor readings or actuator actions as well as request 
TEDS’ data [3]. 
As shown in Figure 12.1 [5], the eight standards tie together the elements link­
ing smart sensors, (the STIMS), bus-interface modules, and mixed-mode transduc­
ers to the network through the NCAP. IEEE 1451.4 connects through a mixed-
mode interface (MMI). The Home Phoneline Network Alliance (HPNA) provides 
connectivity for 1451.3. The standards represent an extensive effort to provide 
sufficient detail to achieve interoperability while allowing flexibility for manufac­
turers of components, subsystems, and systems.
The major common element in the 1451 family is the TEDS or ability to support 
a TEDS [6]. The hardware interface, distance between elements, signal converter, 
and measurement level are areas that differentiate the four family members. The 
approved IEEE 1451standards are thorough documents that are hundreds of pages 
long. The remaining sections in this chapter provide more detail on the various 

12.3  IEEE 1451.1

family members, but interested readers are directed toward the actual documents 
and the references.
12.3  IEEE 1451.1
The 1451.1 specification provides a simple, complete object model for building 
smart sensor and actuator-based systems [5]. In general, an object is a collection 
of data and operations. An object model is a definition of data structures and op­
erations organized in a formal specification. For IEEE 1451.1, a smart transducer 
object model includes an interface to a transducer object model and to a transducer 
bus.
The IEEE 1451.1 standard models a smart transducer as a software PC with 
a backplane and plug-in cards [7]. This standard is intended for a manufacturer 
or integrator that provides additional functionality in the form of onboard intel­
ligence that has to be supported on more than one underlying network. Figure 12.2 
shows the building blocks and software components of parameters, events, actions, 
files, and timers.
12.3.1  Network-Capable Application Processor
The NCAP typically consists of a processor with an embedded operating system 
and timing capability. NCAPs can range from simple elements with more extensive

support from STIMs with many channels to more complex designs with multiple 
ports. The top-level relations between block objects, software processes, and an 
NCAP are illustrated in Figure 12.3 [5]. Within an NCAP there can be several 
software processes in the function block, base transducer block, and non-IEEE 
1451 objects but only one object NCAP block. Object identifying properties are

The IEEE 1451.1 standard provides both physical and logical specifications for 
the smart transducer object model [5]. The solid lines in Figure 12.4 represent the 
physical components of the system and the dotted lines provide the logical view. 
The sensors and actuators form a transducer that is connected over an interface to 
a microprocessor or microcontroller. The network protocol logical interface and 
transducer logical interface are defined in 1451.1. IEEE1451.2 defines the (hard­
ware) interface between transducers and the NCAP. The interfaces are optional 
and either 1451.1 or 1451.2 can be implemented without the other. If support for 
interoperable transducers is not required, only 1451.1 could be used. If networking 
is not required, IEEE 1451.2 would be sufficient. Developed after the initial 1451.1 
and 1451.2 standards were approved, IEEE 1451.0 defines common commands 
and the http interface [5]. In addition, it defines Smart Transducer Web Services 
(STWS), for IEEE 1451 smart transducers that includes:

12.3.2  Network Communication Models
The IEEE 1451.1 standard provides two models for network communication be­
tween objects. The point-to-point client server model is tightly coupled for one-
to-one communications. The publish-subscribe model is loosely coupled for 
one-to-many and many-to-many communications. Network software suppliers are 
expected to provide code libraries that contain routines for the calls between the 
IEEE 1451.1 communication operations and the network [4].
Figure 12.5 shows the client-server used in IEEE 1451.1 [4]. The model is sup­
ported by two complementary application-level operations:
••
Execute on client-side client-port objects;
••
Perform on all network-visible, server-side objects.
The execute and perform operations work together to provide a remote-object-
operation-invocation style messaging service [4].
The publish-subscribe model in IEEE 1451.1 is shown in Figure 12.6 [4]. The 
model provides a means for loosely coupled communications between objects 
where the sending, or publishing, object does not need to be aware of the receiving, 
or subscriber, objects. This model is supported by two operations:
••
Publish on publisher port objects;
••
AddSubscriber and an associated callback operation on subscriber port 
objects.
The publisher and subscriber use a combination of domains, keys, and topics/
qualifiers (defined in the standard) to allow only the publications of interest to a 
subscriber object to be selected from publications received by a subscriber port [4].

241
12.4  IEEE 1451.2
IEEE 1451.2 defines an interface, both the hardware and software blocks, for net­
worked transducer(s) that does not depend on a specific control network [8]. The 
standard introduces the concept of a STIM and defines a TEDS, which is an integral 
part of the STIM and the TII—the physical interface between the STIM and the 
NCAP [9]. Figure 12.7 shows the relationship between the elements defined in IEEE 
1451.2 and the network [8]. Note that a single sensor or actuator or many channels 
of transducers may exist in a single STIM. This section explains key aspects of the 
STIM, TEDS, TII, and the built-in tools for enabling smarter systems.
12.4.1  STIM
The STIM in Figure 12.7 can contain from 1 to 255 transducers of various types 
[8]. A STIM is controlled by an NCAP module through a dedicated digital interface. 
A STIM meets the requirements of 1451.2 if it:
••
Supports the required performance;
••
Contains a properly formatted TEDS;
••
Has a physical interface that implements the lines, protocol, and timing of 
the TII. 
IEEE 1451.2 defines four types of sensors, one actuator, and an event detector 
[8]. The four sensor types all read some variable, convert the data from analog to 
digital form, and make the data available. The transducer types are
••

••
Buffered sensor;
••
Data sequence sensor;

���������������������������
Standards for Smart Sensing
••
Buffered data sequence sensor;
••
Actuator;
••
Event sequence sensor.
Figure 12.8 illustrates the response of an STIM to a trigger [9]. The triggering 
function provides a means for an NCAP to send the STIM a command for an ac­
tion to take place (the trigger signal), and for the STIM to indicate the time when 
the action occurred (trigger acknowledgment). This general flow is elaborated in 
the standard to show the sensor and actuator activity that occurs concurrently in 
the quiescent and triggered states. Other possible triggering options include:
••
Triggering buffered sensors;
••
Triggering data sequence sensors; 
••
Triggering buffered data sequence sensor;
••
Triggering event sequence sensors.
When the sensor STIM reacts to an NCAP trigger, the transducer begins read­
ing [10]. When the reading is completed the STIM makes a trigger acknowledge 
and the NCAP reads the value(s). The actuator STIM reacts to an NCAP trigger by 
writing the value(s) and initiating transducer actuation. When complete, the STIM 
asserts a trigger acknowledge.
Triggering the buffered sensor results in the same as the sensor except the value 
is returned from the previous trigger. This means it is an immediate response but 
the time of the reading is uncertain [10].
A data sequence sensor samples at its choice of time—typically synchronized 
with the physical world. After the trigger, the sensor waits until the next sample 
time and then returns an ACK signal and the results [10].
Triggering the buffered data sequence sensor is similar to the data sequence 
sensor except it makes the data in the holding buffer available. The trigger

acknowledgment is coincident with the availability of previously acquired data set. 
If another trigger occurs after the holding buffer is read but before the acquisition 
of the next sample of data is complete, the acknowledge signal is not returned until 
the data acquisition process is complete [9].
An event sequence sensor is the same as the data sequence sensor but it does 
not return any data. For this sensor, the time of the event is the relevant informa­
tion [9].
12.4 2  Transducer Electronic Data Sheet
The TEDS identifies essentially everything the user wants to know or may want to 
know about the transducer, including:
••
Manufacturer, model number, revision code, serial number, device type, and 
date code for transducers;
••
When the units was calibrated and the variable, type, and limits of use;
••
Calibration constants and calibration date;
••
Signal conversion data model, model length, and number of significant bits;
••
Channel timing read/write setup time, sampling period, warm-up time, and 
update time;
••
Power supply requirements (voltage and current);

Overhead: the TEDS length and number of channels. 
Eight different TEDS memories are defined in 1451.2. The types of TEDS are 
either for use by the NCAP (machine readable) or for operators (human read­
able). There are two mandatory and four optional TEDS classifications. Table 12.1 
shows the type of TEDS that have been defined in 1451.2 [8].
Figure 12.9 shows the addressable sections of the TEDS [11]. The mandatory 
sections are shown with solid lines and the optional sections are shown with dotted 
lines. The standard was defined to provide a growth path for future applications.
Table 12.2 shows an example of one of the TEDS in 1451.2—the data struc­
ture in the mandatory channel identification data block [9]. The 17 fields provide 
manufacturer- and sensor-specific information. The function of the channel identi­
fication TEDS is to make available at the interface all of the information to identify 
the channel being addressed. The channel identification TEDS bytes are constant 
and read-only [9].

12.4.3  TII
The standard digital interface for IEEE 1451.2, TII, is a clocked serial interface 
similar to an SPI (see Chapter 5). The 10 electrical connections are defined as shown 
in Table 12.3 [12]. The lines are defined more thoroughly in the standard, and the 
power supply aspects are discussed further in Section 12.4.5. The standard does not 
define a standard connector but leaves that as a flexibility item to the discretion of 
the user.
12.4.4  Calibration/Correction Engine
IEEE 1451.2 describes a correct algorithm that allows users to convert ADC output 
into engineering units for sensors and engineering units into input to an ADC for 
actuators [13]. Lookup tables, linear conversions, and multiple-input polynomial 
surface calibrations are among the possible uses of this data for sensors. The cali­
bration TEDS contains the capability to perform:
••
First-order conversion with a single segment straight line;
••
Segmented first-order conversion for nonlinear sensors where higher accu­
racy is required;

Figure 12.10 is an example of where the correction algorithm can be run [13]. 
Figure 12.10(a) shows the calibration TEDS stored in the STIM. In this case, the 
host computer copies the calibration TEDS from the STIM and performs the con­
version from raw data to engineering units. This can be cost-effective in small sys­
tems but larger systems with many transducers can expend much of the CPU’s time 
in the correction process.

Distributed systems can have the conversion performed in one computer that 
provides corrected data to other processors or in each computer in the system. If a 
single processor performs the correction the other processors must be programmed 
to only get data from the host and not directly from the transducer or NCAP. If the 
conversion is performed in multiple places, the copy of the calibration TEDS must 
be changed each time a transducer is changed.
Figure 12.10(b) shows the conversion performed in the NCAP. The calibration 
TEDS is copied from the STIM into the NCAP, where the conversion to engineering 
units is performed. This simplifies the management of the source of data and elimi­
nates multiple copies of the data. The NCAP processor will cost more to provide 
this capability.
Figure 12.10(c) shows the STIM running the correction process. This technique 
is useful in systems with a large array of transducers or with groups of very high-
speed transducers. For wide acceptance, ICs must be developed that provide this 
capability.
12.4.5  Sourcing Power to STIMs
Voltage on the power line at the NCAP is specified at 5V ±0.20V dc with respect to 
the common. Power for the STIM interface control circuitry must be provided only 
through the primary communications interface. Power is normally supplied to the 
STIM as shown in Figure 12.11(a) [9]. An alternate source of power for the STIM

secondary power sources [9].

for applications where the sensor or actuator circuitry exceeds the current and/or 
voltage levels that the NCAP can provide is shown in Figure 12.11(b).
12.4.6  Representing Physical Units in the TEDS
IEEE 1451.2 has a simple and easily stored method of identifying physical units 
for use with smart transducers, allowing them to provide output in terms any user 
can understand [14]. This capability enhances sensor plug and play without writ­
ing special software. The approach uses a standard set of units to determine the 
calibration constants. For a manufacturer, this means that they can always perform 
their final test and calibration the same way. For a user, a standard technique exists 
for a variety of system functions by understanding the methodology used in IEEE 
1451.2. The standard represents the International System of Units units (SI) as 
shown in Table 12.4.
For an example of how to express a measurement of distance, consider (12.1) 
[13]. This equation shows how a measurement in meters could be written. To pro­
vide this to a computer, only the exponential values are used; that is, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0, 0, 0.

The standard provides two derived units, radians (rad) and steradians (sr) to 
the seven base SI units and addresses units that are given in meters per meter, 
logarithm of quantities and logarithms of dimensionless numbers, as well as hard­
ness and digital data through an enumeration field (enum). Exponents are encoded 
using an unsigned byte integer. The exponent and its sign are multiplied by 2 and 
128 is added to achieve an encoded byte integer with a resolution of ½. Using this 
technique, exponents between -64 to +63 can be expressed.
As an example of how measurement units are handled in IEEE 1451.2, consid­
er a pressure measurement that is expressed in Pascals–kilogram per meter per sec­
onds squared. Table 12.5 shows the field units for this example. The enumeration 
0 means that the units are the product of the base units. Examples of how distance,

and switch positions are shown in [13].
12.5  IEEE 1451.3
IEEE 1451.3 defines a digital interface for connecting multiple, physically separated 
sensors [15]. This is one of two MMIs that allow digital information to be stored 
with the transducer and transmitted over analog data wires. The multidrop trans­
ducer bus standard is a minibus implementation small enough and cheap enough to 
integrate into a transducer. The amount of overhead for the proposed 1451.3 is con­
siderably less than existing fieldbuses that use up to 32 bits for node addressing [3].
The interface for a minibus for multiple modules that are physically separated 
is shown in Figure 12.12. The interface supports TEDS, as well as channel iden­
tification, hot swapping, and time synchronization protocols. The transducer bus 
interface module (TBIM) consists of one to N transducers and a 1451.3-defined 
TEDS and interface logic to control and transfer data across the minibus. Most 
likely, the TEDS contains a meta TEDS, meta ID TEDS, channel TEDS, channel 
ID TEDS, calibrations TEDS, and calibration ID TEDS but with different names to 
avoid confusion with those defined in 1451.2. The transducer bus controller (TBC) 
manages the minibus and handles the setup and data transfer [15].

12.6  IEEE 1451.4
The amount of existing sensor and networking technologies and the cost of tran­
sitioning to the digital network standards defined in 1451 are issues that the pro­
ponents of the standard are addressing. Analog sensors, with their existing wiring 
and the requirement for wide bandwidth analog measurements are specifically 
addressed by IEEE 1451.4. IEEE 1451.4 establishes a standard that allows these 
analog-output, mixed-mode transducers to communicate digital information with 
a high-level IEEE 1451 object [16]. To fit into the digital network defined by other 
1451 standards, the bidirectional digital communication of self-identification, test, 
and programmable signal conditioning is defined with consideration for simplicity 
and low cost. IEEE 1451.4 offers compatibility with legacy systems and provides a 
transition path to 1451 [15]. Both sensors and actuators are supported by 1451.4 
and yet the interface is invisible from the network’s perspective.
Figure 12.13 shows the TEDS and high-level 1451 object for an analog trans­
ducer [16]. For many 1451.4 applications, it is not practical to include the network 
interface (NCAP) with the transducer due to size limitations or harsh operating 
environment considerations. However, the transducer TEDS must contain enough 
information to allow the higher-level 1451 object to fill in any gaps.
Figure 12.14 is an example of an IEEE 1451.4 implementation. The NCAP and 
TEDS characteristics are defined in 1451.1 and 1451.2 and refined as necessary for 
mixed-mode network in 1451.4. Minimizing the amount of nonvolatile memory 
is one of the goals of the developers of the standard. The 1451.4 TEDS includes 
categories and parameters as shown in Table 12.6 [16]. Since its acceptance as a 
full standard, several articles have reported various aspects of IEEE 1451.4 [17].
12.7  IEEE 1451.5
IEEE 1451.5 defines a transducer-to-NCAP interface and TEDS for wireless trans­
ducers. As shown in Figure 12.1, it addresses Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth wireless 
protocols as well as 6LowPAN (IEEE 802.15.4, IPv6) [18]. Since its full approval,

several wireless applications have been described implementing 1451.5 [19, 20]. 
For example, an IEEE 1451.5-802.11 standards-based wireless sensor network 
(WSN), consisting of one gateway node and two wireless sensor nodes has been 
presented in a peer-reviewed forum [19]. The WSN has demonstrated TIM discov­
ery, transducer discovery, read a block of transducer data, and provided real-time 
wireless monitoring.

12.8  IEEE P1451.6
IEEE P1451.6 defines a transducer to NCAP interface and TEDS for high-speed 
CANopen networks [21]. In addition to defining a mapping of the 1451 TEDS to 
CANopen dictionary entries, P1451.6 also maps communication messages, process 
data, configuration parameters, and diagnostic information between the two net­
work protocols.
At present, an unapproved standard, the aspects of P1451.6 without the intrin­
sically safe definitions has been implemented in many transducer and closed-loop 
controllers as a CANopen Device Profile standard under the name DS404 for over 
10 years [22]. For example, an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor interface has been 
designed for a CAN to ECG preamplifier connectivity [21].
12.9  IEEE 1451.7
IEEE 1451.7, the sensor-integrated RFID standard, defines communication meth­
ods and data formats for sensors and actuators that communicate with RFID tags 
[23]. Prior to this standard, an openly defined, independent interface standard be­
tween transducers and RFID tags did not exist. In addition to following the ISO/
IEC 24753 standard, 1451.7 also defines TEDS formats based on the IEEE 1451 
family of standards and protocols for accessing TEDS and transducer data. Without 
specifying transducer design or signal conditioning, the standard adopts necessary 
interfaces and protocols to facilitate the use of technically differentiated, existing 
technology solutions.
12.10  Extending the System to the Network
The IEEE 1451 family of standards enables a broad range of networking possibili­
ties. As shown in Figure 12.15, the network independence provided by 1451 allows 
manufacturers to connect smart sensors within different systems to various net­
works [24]. While acceptance has been slower than promoters expected, the con­
tinued activity in this area from standards makers and users should lead to greater 
connectivity in industrial and other networks.
12.11  Application Example
An example of how the NCAPs for sensors and actuators could be established for a 
wastewater treatment system is provided in the Appendix of 1451.1. That example 
provides a rigorous implementation of the standard. Identifying the NCAPs is one 
of the initial steps. The system diagram in Figure 12.16 shows a PID control system 
(see Section 7.1.3) that takes periodic pH sensor readings to control the pump speed 
based on the measurements and pH set points [4].
The mixer control is either on or off based on the pump speed being above or 
below a given set point. The measurements are logged to a database, used in the au­
tomated control system, and displayed for an operator to override the automated

system. The NCAP hardware required to implement this system with IEEE 1451 
functionality is shown in Figure 12.17.
The functionality of the wastewater system is partitioned among three NCAPs 
[4]. The level control and pH control are implemented on simple NCAPs and im­
plemented separately to meet safety requirements. The operator system is imple­
mented with a PC NCAP as the host for the system’s man-machine interface and 
data management system. Developing the software functionality for this system 
provides a rather complete use of 1451.1. The interested reader should refer to the 
latest revision of the standard for the full details of the example.
12.12  Summary
Standards have played a major role in many industries to accelerate and expand ac­
ceptance. The accepted and proposed IEEE 1451 standards described in this chap­
ter have been or are being developed to work together or separately depending on 
the system requirements. These standards should provide transducer to network in­
teroperability and extended benefits to existing sensor manufacturers and network 
users. The potential to use the Internet in control systems will change the way net­
works are designed by engineers and used in organizations. Chapter 13 expands the 
future potential and the visions that are developing for networked smart sensors.
Other market segments, such as automotive, have established standards that 
are finding industry acceptance. However, in many respects, de facto standards 
continue to play a significant role in sensor networking.

The great thing about standards is that there are so many of them.

13.1  Introduction
Industry standards for smart sensors include the IEEE 1451 family and others that 
have been initiated for control applications. These standards’ intent is to reduce the 
barriers to acceptance and therefore accelerate the development and usage of new 
smart sensors in existing and advanced systems. Some of the capabilities enabled 
by the IEEE 1451 standards have already been demonstrated. Other possibilities 
continue to be proposed and developed by companies and organizations with a 
vision for the future. This chapter will discuss how plug and play makes sensors 
smarter and easier to deal with in the real world and the advanced communication 
and control capabilities that smart sensors can bring to control systems through 
Ethernet, the Internet, and more.
13.2  Sensor Plug and Play
Using computer technology and object-oriented technology approach to sensing is 
behind several standard approaches. In addition to the IEEE 1451 standard, Mi­
crosoft has developed Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for supporting PCs in 
embedded control applications. The OLE for Process Control (OPC) Foundation is 
driving commonality based on OLE-based standard objects, methods, and proper­
ties for servers of real-time information in distributed control systems, program­
mable logic controllers, smart field devices, and analyzers [1]. Object technology 
answers the demands for open systems in control system design. Example of objects 
include a valve, loop, trend log, field device, pressure sensor and I/O board. Objects 
can model real-world data or the data contained within the object may be real-time. 
Figure 13.1 shows how object models could control operations and events in a 
proportional-integral-derivative control system.
The use of Java program language for embedded applications has interesting 
implications for smart sensors [2]. A Java Automation Application Programming

More Standards Impacting Sensors
Interface (API) has been developed by Sun Microsystems and a group of process 
control and manufacturing systems vendors. Java is computing platform indepen­
dent and will run on any Java-enabled machine. Applications are decoupled from 
platforms and can be distributed across networks on servers with full or partial 
applications delivered to clients. In this environment, only one copy of the applica­
tion is maintained on the server. The user always has the current version and the 
application goes away when the user’s task is completed [1].
Cost is key enabler for many new systems. As software costs and development 
times continue to rise, many companies in the embedded systems world are viewing 
Java as a program language that will let them write code once and move easily from 
one MCU to another [2]. However, Java was developed for desktop computing and 
has functionality that exceeds the requirements of embedded control.
More recently, the Internet Protocol for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance is pur­
suing the “use of the Internet Protocol to serve as the foundation for a network of 
sensor-enabled physical objects to communicate with each other as seamlessly as 
individuals do over the Internet” [3]. In 2012, the alliance, whose members include 
leading technology, communications, and energy companies, demonstrated device 
to device interoperability of nine member companies’ devices. The demonstration 
involved interoperability at the application layer using the Internet Engineering 
Task force (IETF) standard protocols with multiple PHY/MAC layers successfully 
interoperating with each other.
The organizers’ success in forming a single network using direct communi­
cation between sensor/controller nodes without the need for gateways marks a 
first for wireless IoT devices using compatible media. Participants’ wireless imple­
mentations of 6LoWPAN, IPv6, Real-Time Programming Language (RPL), and 
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) used IEEE 802.15.4 (both sub-GHz and 
Figure 13.1  Object model for control. (After: [1].)

13.3  Universal Serial Bus

2.4 GHz) and PowerLine Communication (PLC) (refer to Chapter 8 for wireless 
details).
PLC is an alternative to running additional wires for communication since it 
uses a modulated carrier signal for transmitting and receiving data on a power wir­
ing system. Supported by IEEE 1901.2010, the HomePlug Alliance’s HomePlugAV, 
high-speed communications is the most widely deployed powerline networking 
standard [4]. Several semiconductor suppliers offer ICs based on the standard pro­
viding a competitive environment and industry impetus for future growth. Sensors 
are among the devices that can be connected in a PLC system, especially as smart 
grid/smart energy solutions are implemented.
13.3  Universal Serial Bus
The universal serial bus (USB) and IEEE 1394 (also known as Firewire) provide 
plug and play capabilities for PCs. When these PC-based standards are applied to 
sensing, the level of smarts increases. One expert’s analysis found several interesting 
comparisons between USB and the IEEE 1451 family of standards, both of which 
were launched in 1993 [5]. Similarities include:
••
Both specify the details of data transfer between two nodes;
••
Both accommodate a wide range of complex device/peripheral data and for­
mat this into a standard digital data stream;
••
Both exploit the special features of connecting smart transducers or smart 
computer peripherals;
••
Both provide self-identifying information in response to requests from the 
connected system regarding the type of device.
Technical differences between the interfaces involve wider use than sensors and 
actuators and more restrictions on host and slave/functional end points, host op­
erating software, physical connector, and configuration data for USB. Beyond the 
technical issues, and perhaps more significant to the market success of USB over 
IEEE 1451 acceptance, are the following features of USB:
••
Lower cost; 
••
Sponsorship by trend setting proponents;
••
Lower complexity; 
••
Significantly larger market size; 
••
Lack of entrenched legacy solutions;
••
Easier use compared to previous approaches. 
All of these attributes contribute to the success of USB and should be consid­
ered as any standard is evaluated for smart sensor connectivity. In some cases, a 
single item may be significant enough to limit market acceptance. For example, 
Firewire’s $20 cost penalty over USB has limited its implementation in general data 
transfer applications.

The ability to increase the sampling rate for high-speed applications; 
••
Capability to store calibration values inside onboard, nonvolatile memory.
IEEE 1451’s TEDS requires nonvolatile memory to store real-time calculations 
that correct for variances in parameters such as nonlinearity as well as other con­
figurations. The elimination of this requirement provides a significant advantage, 
since the TEDS chip can be eliminated. The USB interface also removes the need 
for the signal conditioner, analog filter, power supply, and multimeter. Figure 13.2 
shows the difference between a traditional sensor system, such as IEEE 1451, and 
a USB sensor system.
13.4  Development Tools Establish De Facto Standards
USB has become a de facto standard for connecting sensor and other electronic 
components to users’ PCs for product features and capabilities demonstration as 
well as development tools and kits. In addition, USB plays a prominent role in data 
acquisition (DA). Figure 13.3 shows an example of a USB development tool for 
Sensirion’s SDP610 digital differential pressure sensors [7]. In addition to the USB 
stick with an adapter cable and the pressure sensor, viewer software can be down­
loaded from the company’s website and easily installed on the user’s computer. With 
the software, the user can measure at different resolutions, display differential pres­
sure in Pa and inches of water, and chose absolute or relative timing. The software 
also provides data-logging capability.

for misconnections. Top: traditional sensor system. Bottom: USB sensor system. (After: [6].)

13.5  Alternate Standards 
261
Many companies offer similar USB-based evaluation kits to demonstrate the 
capabilities of their products as well as other USB-based design tools including 
development kits, boards, and systems. The USB tools take advantage of the com­
puting, memory storage, and display capabilities of the PC. As a result, the USB 
dongle has become a universal tool for evaluating and developing complex prod­
ucts including sensors.
13.5  Alternate Standards
Not all systems are covered by the standards or addressed in a manner that satisfies 
all applications. Critical and unique environments with design constraints outside 
of the standards can require modifications of a standard, and in some cases, an­
other standard. Four examples will be discussed, but they are just a sample of the 
instances when no matter how many “standards” are available, another approach 
is deemed necessary.
13.5.1  Airplane Networks
Standards can be applied to applications that were not necessarily the focus of the 
standard developers. Figure 13.4 shows the use of a variation of the IEEE 1451 
standard for a jet airplane [8]. The primary difference is the analog output for 
troubleshooting. Each of a number of buses on the airplane would connect a num­
ber of sensors or actuators to a central DA and/or control system. The connection 
between the hub and host computer would be less than 100m and actually may not 
be required. A single high-speed cable or fiber-optic link would provide the inter­
face to the host computer located remotely from the network. Other available buses 
were analyzed by the development team and eliminated for the following reasons:

13.5.2  Automotive Safety Network
Cost-effective simple circuitry for networked control for airbags and other vehicle 
safety systems has lead to the development of a distributed systems interface (DSI) 
[9]. Supported by the DSI Consortium, this interface is offered as a freely licens­
able standard. Other automotive standards such as CAN or pending fault-tolerant 
standards were considered too expensive for the air bag application by consortium 
members.
The DSI is not designed to be fault-tolerant but it has a high immunity to EMI. 
The signal protocol uses voltage mode signaling in one direction (from master) and 
current mode signaling in the other (from slave). However, the DSI does not fail 
without warning. During power-up each node is analyzed and the air bag can be 
added or removed depending on presence and size of passenger without completely 
reconfiguring the network. This configuration during power-up allows compo­
nents from several different suppliers to be combined for the first time at vehicle 
assembly and/or to be replaced in service if they are found to be defective without 
special programming equipment [10].
An example of the two-wire DSI network is shown in Figure 13.5. The master 
node polls each sensor for information, calculates whether an air bag needs to be 
deployed, and then issues a command to the appropriate actuator (squib). The term 
niche area network (NAN) has been applied to this network that connects to other 
networks within the vehicle.
The DSI network with the various components of an air bag system is shown in 
Figure 13.6 [10]. Although the network is a NAN, 23 components are identified in 
Figure 13.4  Boeing 777 adaptation of IEEE 1451.2. (After: [8].)

the figure. The ability of automakers to add safety components, such a side-impact 
air bags, kneebags, tubular restraints, pretensioners, and occupant sensors with­
out redesigning the entire system provides flexibility and saves time and resources. 
DSI3 version 1.0 technical specification was finalized and released February 17, 
2011 [11]. 
13.5.3  Another Automotive Safety Network
Peripheral Sensor Interface 5 (PSI5) is another protocol developed for use in airbag 
applications [12]. The steering committee of the PSI5 organization (automotive 
system manufacturers Autoliv, Bosch, and Continental) and associates members

that include semiconductor suppliers and others provides significant driving force 
for this standard. Similar to DSI, for low cost, PSI5 is a two-wire master-slave 
network but PSI5 is Manchester encoded and DSI is full duplex. PSI5’s developers 
regard its date rate of 125 kbps (in both directions) as applicable to most of the 
automotive sensor applications with sufficient bandwidth for many multichannel 
sensor configurations. Table 13.1 shows a comparison of the data rate and other 
key parameters in both protocols.
Figure 13.7 shows a block diagram comparison of DSI and PSI5 by a supplier 
that supports both air bags systems. Note that both architectures contain the same 
content at a high level. However, the organization and integration of some portions 
create many devices that are unique to a specific bus. For example, even though the 
MEMS sensing element and packaging are identical, the signal conditioning ASIC 
that also communicates to each bus makes each system’s accelerometers (crash 
satellite sensors) unique.
13.5.4  Automotive Sensor Protocol
In addition to standards developed for air bag systems, SAE developed a sensor 
protocol for high-resolution data transmission with a lower system cost than estab­
lished and developing standards that initially targeted engine control systems [16]. 
The Single Edge Nibble Transmission (SENT) standard, SAE J2716 Apr-07, is a 
point-to-point digital protocol for transmitting signals from sensors to a controller 
that eliminates a DAC at the sensor and ADC at the MCU, considerably reducing 
system cost.

The message structure, shown in Figure 13.8, consists of a short (less than 1 
ms) telegram of 8 nibbles (32 bits) including sensor data, diagnostic information, 
and CRC [17]. Two 12-bit values or channels are transferred in a single message.

One channel can be eliminated to gain more resolution in a single-channel design. 
A synchronization/calibration pulse starts the message and a CRC checksum nibble 
ends the message. The protocol operates at a nominal clock frequency of 28 kHz.
Figure 13.9 shows the block diagram of a triaxial Hall effect absolute rotary 
position sensor that includes the SENT protocol as one if its three outputs. In addi­
tion to a ratiometric analog and PWM output, the sensor has a SENT output with 
programmable linear transfer characteristics. The sensor implements the standard’s 
single secure sensors format [18]. Note that the three output options only require 
a single pin. This keeps the product’s packaging cost low and allows its use in a 
variety of systems.
The SENT protocol was approved by SAE in 2007. In 2009, the Short PWM 
Code (SPC) protocol, an extension of the SENT protocol that allows bidirectional

communication, was proposed. In addition, SPC proponents cite reduced system 
cost as additional motivation for the modification. 
13.6  Consumer/Cell Phone Apps
In the late twentieth century, the well-known standard war was Apple vs. Microsoft 
in computer operating systems. With cell phones sales of about 1.4 billion annually 
in 2011 and 35% of those sales attributed to smart phones according to research 
firm Wedge Partners, the current turf war to establish a dominant de facto standard 
is in the cell phone OS [19]. Android is the smart phone OS with the highest mar­
ket share at 59% followed by Apple’s iOS with 23% share and Nokia, Symbian, 
Blackberry and others completing the list according to IDC. In addition, Apple and 
Google’s Android is expected to have 62.5% and 36.5% of the worldwide tablet 
market in 2012 according to IDC [20].
For any type of cell phone or computer, Bluetooth provides a common means to 
easily connect peripherals and communicate data. Market research firm Forward 
Concepts predicts Bluetooth-embedded handset sales to reach 2.4 billion units by 
2016 [21]. The introduction of Bluetooth 4.0 with its Bluetooth low energy (BLE) 
feature in November 2011 increases the potential use of BLE as de facto wireless 
standard for communicating sensor data.
At Sensors Expo 2012, presenters discussed compelling reasons why BLE could 
provide a platform for wireless sensing that overcomes many of the shortcomings 
that have limited the widespread adoption of existing wireless sensing protocols 
[22, 23]. Leveraging the installed based and name recognition of Bluetooth with 
significantly lower power consumption, BLE could follow the path of USB for com­
puter data transfer (see Table 13.2).
One final standards effort targets sensor plug and play for the sensor web: the 
accessibility of global environment data [24]. The goal of the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) SensorWeb Enablement (SWE) initiative is the definition of 
standards for uniform access to sensor resources comparable to the retrieval of

information resources in the World Wide Web. This includes the definition of web 
service interfaces and data encodings to make sensors discoverable, taskable, and 
accessible on the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994, the OGC has developed 30 
approved OGC standards that collectively comprise a platform for interoperabil­
ity. The standards “have been implemented in hundreds of commercial and open 
source geoprocessing products and are being implemented in communities and or­
ganizations around the world” [24].
To simplify and minimize human involvement in the integration of sensors into 
observing systems, OGC has developed a sensor plug and play infrastructure for 
the Sensor Web that combines:
1.	 Semantic matchmaking functionality;
2.	 A publish/subscribe mechanism underlying the Sensor Web; 
3.	 A model for the declarative description of sensor interfaces that provides a 
generic driver mechanism. 
OGC’s SWE initiative provides yet another standards-based effort to en­
hance the value of the increasing amount of sensor data towards improving the 
environment. 
13.7  Application Example
With the driving force of a high-volume industry or consumer-accepted platform 
such as an iPhone or an Android operating system, many companies develop ap­
plications or apps. Apps developers are frequently small companies or individuals 
that have identified what they hope is a consumer must-have item. 
An example of what can be done today is Sensorcon’s Sensordrone [25]. Sens­
ordrone is a programmable multisensor platform device for the Android OS. The 
Sensordrone includes three gas sensors, illumination, color, relative humidity, pres­
sure, capacitance, infrared temperature sensing, and more. An expansion connec­
tor allows other sensors to connect to it. Data communication to the Android-
based host occurs through the Bluetooth standard. The initial Sensordrone uses 
Bluetooth 2.1, but it will be upgraded to Bluetooth 4.0, and in the future it will 
support USB. While currently designed for Android, the company plans to support 
other platforms such as iOS, Blackberry, and Windows.
The company’s environmental sensors that monitor toxic gases, carbon mon­
oxide, and hydrogen sulfide provide useful (and entertaining) data quite different 
from the sensing integrated into current smart phones. For example, Sensordrone’s 
precision gas sensor can measure the alcohol content above beakers of beer and 
whisky and the unit’s color sensors can measure the color of the two drinks. 
The platform provides control over many sensing aspects including which sen­
sors are on, frequency of data collection, and when to transmit data as well as the 
unit’s LED colors. The platform has three modes of operation: 
1.	 Call-Respond Mode delivers the most recent data;
2.	 Streaming Mode sends real-time data;

13.8  Summary 
269
3.	 Data Logging Mode stores data in memory, and then downloads and ex­
ports when requested.
The company’s open software policy allows others to develop apps for even 
more sensor applications. The integrated sensing capability of smart phones for 
motion sensing and navigation has dramatically changed many aspects of modern 
life for those who use these features. If compelling and useful apps can be devel­
oped for other sensors, similar lifestyle improvements can be expected.
13.8  Summary
Smart architectures for sensors and networks continue to appear in several differ­
ent areas. The emphasis is being placed on interoperability and standardization of 
protocols, along with the flexibility offered by an array of components from build­
ing blocks to integrated solutions. As a result, next generation control systems can 
have a level of flexibility and functionality that will grow as the industry grows and 
expand with application requirements. However, no matter how many standards 
are available, applications or organizations may require variations or new alterna­
tives, which may eventually become standards in their own right.

Sensor Fusion
By doing fusion I improve the results in some fashion. But you need to know the 
contribution being made by each of the contributing sensors because there is a cost 
associated with doing this function.
—Belur Dasarathy, multisensor information fusion pioneer [1]
14.1  Introduction
One of the more dramatic changes in sensor and system design that has accelerated 
in the last decade is the use of sensor (also known as information or data) fusion. 
From its initial use in military and robotics applications, sensor fusion has ex­
panded into a few automotive and numerous consumer applications. Sensor fusion 
adds value to the data from the individual sensors and, in many cases, increases the 
number of sensors used in a particular application.
Ongoing industry efforts for sensor fusion are occurring in the computing and 
software area as well as the sensor area with integrated computing and software. 
Figure 14.1 shows the advancements and somewhat independent progress made 
in the two paths over the last three decades. Based primarily on MEMS technol­
ogy, sensors have added sensor fusion algorithms into products in the latest phase. 
The computing path has increased in complexity from a single-core MCU with 
limited integral memory to include software and firmware for fuzzy logic and neu­
ral networks to multicore MCUs that can handle signal processing separate from 
housekeeping and other functional core(s) including sensor fusion. Many control­
ler implementations of sensor fusion use a separate application processor (AP) for 
this function. This chapter addresses the expanding implementations of sensor fu­
sion in several applications with consideration for the control, software, and sensor 
aspects.
14.2  Sensor and Other Fusion Background
The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) de­
veloped the initial Data Fusion Lexicon in 1987 [2]. Its creation and maintenance 
targets military threat assessments and reactions. The 1999 “Revisions to the JDL 

272 
�������������
Sensor Fusion
Data Fusion Model” explains that the JDL model “uses the synergistic differences 
in the data to improve the estimate/assessment of a reported environment (state 
estimation function) [2].” When it achieves its goal, data fusion enables improved 
estimation of specific situations and improved responses to them. The authors of 
this report also identified the confusion that was associated with the many fusion 
terms including information fusion, data fusion, and sensor fusion. Multisensor 
integration was identified as a separate area.
One 2007 source defines sensor fusion as, “the combining of sensory data or 
data derived from sensory data from disparate sources such that the resulting in­
formation is in some sense better than would be possible when these sources were 
used individually” [3].
This rather simple definition avoids the actual complexity of the sensor fusion 
techniques being applied today.
Several models have been developed for information, data, as well as sensor 
fusion [4]. Multilevel fusion at three or even four levels is an attribute of the most 
popular models. The interested reader can readily find these architectures in papers 
describing the Dasarathy, Omnibus, Waterfall, and other models. The choice of 
which architecture to use is defined by the application, user’s experience, and other 
factors outside of the scope of this chapter.
Shown in Figure 14.2, the initial Dasarathy model is one of the earlier models 
to explain the fusion that can occur at different levels [5]. Sensor inputs provide 
a combined output in the first fusion level of the model with feature and decision 
fusion occurring at higher levels. Three-letter acronyms indicate data in (DAI), 
data out (DAO), feature in (FEI), feature out (FEO), decision in (DEI), decision out 
Figure 14.1  The evolution or maturity curve of sensor fusion shows how it has benefited from two 
separate growth paths—one for processing and one for sensing.

(DEO). The original Dasarathy model has since been expanded by Dasarathy and 
others as well to cover all the levels of the JDL model.
One of the goals of information fusion is context awareness based on suffi­
cient and accurate information including data from sensors. In fact, context-aware 
computing is well-established terminology, initially defined for mobile computing 
[6]. As noted in Figure 14.1, the sensing and computing technologies have made 
substantial progress so that context awareness or ubiquitous computing is possible 
now. In fact, ubiquitous sensing has been recognized as a critical piece of the aware­
ness requirements of some systems [7].
The initial nonmilitary applications for sensor fusion targeted condition based 
maintenance, robotics, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring [8]. 
These efforts did not provide the awareness and visibility of fusion technology 
until automotive and consumer applications expanded its use. As a result, sensor 
fusion was not a topic included in the first (1995) or even second (2000) edition of 
this book. In 2012, its absence would be a major omission. 
14.3  Automotive Applications
Automotive engineers initially recognized the importance of sensor fusion for ad­
vanced safety applications. In fact, sensor fusion is used on many production ve­
hicles for merging the data from ranging and vision systems. An alternative use of 
sensor fusion also occurs in applications that minimize the use of sensors by taking 
the data available from existing sensors and through complex algorithms, avoiding 
the need for additional sensors. The autonomous vehicle, one that drives itself, is 
the ultimate vehicle application for sensor fusion. The next three sections provide 
more details of these automotive applications.

14.3.1  Ranging and Vision 
To improve the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), including pedestrians and 
cyclists, the European Commission funded a research project called Sensors and 
System Architecture for Vulnerable Road Users (SAVE-U) protection that was initi­
ated in 2002 [9]. The solution proposed by the working group consisting of auto­
makers and tier-1 suppliers was a sensing platform composed of three subsystems:
1.	 Radar;
2.	 Vision;
3.	 High-level fusion.
As shown in Figure 14.3, the multilevel and different sensor technologies in­
volved in sensor fusion for a vehicle warning or control system include both low-
level and high-level data fusion. Sensing technologies include IR vision, color vis­
ible vision, and four or five 24-GHz radar sensors.
The researchers determined that high-level data fusion was insufficient to pro­
vide the required quality and reliability of the target data [10]. The overlapped 
coverage of the three sensor types dictated that the low-level focused detection on a 
region of interest identified by other sensors. The high level confirmed the potential 
targets classified by the system. Figure 14.4 indicates data processing on the SAVE-
U sensor platform.
Radial range and speed, angle indication, and rough classification provided 
by the radar sensors are sent to the video detection stage for low-level fusion. The 
algorithms for merging the IR segmentation results with the color video camera’s 
output were implemented on dedicated real-time embedded image processing hard­
ware with fusion performed mainly at the pixel level.

14.3  Automotive Applications 
275
Since the research effort from this project was reported, several systems devel­
oped independently by automotive suppliers have been installed in high-end pro­
duction vehicles. These systems target more than pedestrian and cyclist detection 
and avoidance. The addition of speed and yaw rate to the radar and camera fusion 
as well as GPS data for logging and validating (but not part of the sensor fusion) 
allows sensor fusion to enable: adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, 
precrash braking, lane departure warning, and other advanced warning systems 
[5].
14.3.2  Sensor Fusion for Virtual Sensors
Government requirements for tire pressure monitoring systems have spurred sup­
pliers and carmakers to pursue alternatives to avoid the added hardware in each 
tire or wheel. NIRA Dynamics’ solution is an indirect tire pressure monitoring 
system (iTPMS) called the tire pressure indicator (TPI). As shown in Figure 14.5, 
the system uses information from several different physical sensors to compute new, 
virtual sensor signals. 
Introduced in Europe in 2006 and the United States in 2008, TPI meets the 
ECE-R 64 and FMVSS 138 requirements for TPMS. The software solution deter­
mines the tire inflation pressure from the wheel speed signals without requiring a 
pressure sensor, RF components, and other circuitry at each wheel. TPI is therefore 
very cost-effective. When an underinflated tire is detected, the system alerts the 
driver accomplishing the safety goal of the regulations as well as fuel economy 
improvement from avoiding driving on underinflated tires.

Virtual sensing based on adding algorithms rather than adding more sensors 
could become more common as the number, types, and intelligence of sensors in­
crease for vehicles and other products as well as locations, such as smart homes 
and smart buildings.
14.3.3  Autonomous Driving
The DARPA Urban Challenge (see Section 7.9) with its $2 million prize motivated 
several university and industry entries as well as collaborations to address the chal­
lenges of a driverless vehicle [12]. To successfully maneuver the 60-mile course, 
the winning vehicle (the Boss) and other entrants used sensor fusion to effectively 
utilize the output of their vehicles’ sensors and make the appropriate driving deci­
sions. The winning vehicle’s moving obstacle fusion architecture is shown in Figure 
14.6 [13].
The moving obstacle fusion architecture consists of three layers: sensor, fusion, 
and situation assessment. The fusion algorithm processes the data from many dif­
ferent input sources maintained in the sensor layer. Each measurement is associated 
with an existing tracked object, but there are often multiple techniques for mea­
surement association. Measurements that do not associate with existing objects 
initiate the creation of a new object.
The sensor layer provides an initial classification of the object based on the 
sensor’s characteristics. Radar sensors detect the presence but not the shape of 
an object. To improve the data, lidar detects whether the object is shaped like a 
car. The fusion layer takes each of the eight sensor’s list of associated (and unas­
sociated) measurements and applies it to the global list of tracked objects. Using 
information from a road world model, the situation assessment layer estimates the 
intention of the tracked object. The results of moving obstacle tracking (that uses 
an extended Kalman filter state estimator), static obstacle detection, road-shape es­
timation, road-shape feature detectors, and other calculations, initiate the vehicle’s 
mechatronic systems’ responses. The system was sufficient to outmanipulate the 
five other entrants that successfully completed the course. 
More recently, the Google driverless car has garnered attention and the right 
to travel on Nevada roadways with some restrictions in 2012 [14]. The Google 
vehicle’s capabilities result from Stanford University’s winning entrant in the 2005

DARPA challenge. In addition to video cameras, radar, and GPS, Google’s driver­
less car uses online navigation features to monitor traffic, detect pedestrians, and 
get passengers to their destinations. Autonomous driving cannot occur without 
sensor fusion.
14.4  Industrial (Robotic) Applications
Robots were one of the initial applications for sensor fusion. More recently, robotic 
sensor agents (RSAs) have been proposed to help human and existing monitoring 
instruments monitor and assess environmental situations [15]. The intent is mitiga­
tion of security, natural, and man-made threats. To achieve the goal of focusing on 
only the most relevant parameters and avoid wasting effort on processing irrelevant 
information, different sensor planning strategies are used. The strategies optimize 
the performance of the combination of fixed and mobile RSAs during specific sens­
ing tasks.
Multisensor data fusion in the model involves symbol, feature, pixel, and 
signal-level fusion. The advantages of RSA’s multiple sensors include redundancy, 
complimentary, and timeliness as well as cost. The cost advantage results from 
using lower-cost sensors to achieve a high level of data integrity instead of more 
expensive and less robust devices. The use of sensor fusion to lower product and 
subsequently system cost is an alternative strategy to the virtual sensing discussed 
in Section 14.2.2.

14.5  Consumer Applications
Motion sensing in portable devices such as cell phone or tablet PCs has taken sensor 
fusion from the battlefield to the marketplace. Virtually every MEMS sensor sup­
plier that offers a three-axis accelerometer and/or gyroscope has developed some 
level of sensor fusion for its hardware. With 9DoF motion sensing becoming a 
common technology in portable consumer products, sensor fusion is an essential 
aspect of product differentiation. In fact, according to the market research firm 
IHS iSuppli, IMUs that combine accelerometers, compasses, and gyroscopes could 
reach 4.2 billion units annually by 2015 [16]. With that market potential, several 
approaches are being offered to satisfy a variety of consumer applications. Figure 
14.7 shows the sensing, calibration filtering, and computations blocks required to 
generate sensor fusion and improved accuracy output from 10DoF sensor inputs.
14.5.1  Fusion Software in the Sensor
One sensor fusion technique implements some level of fusion directly in the sen­
sor. Many MEMS companies take this approach but the amount of integration is 
increasing. For example, InvenSense MPU-6000/6050 devices combine a three-axis 
gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer on the same silicon die together with an 
onboard digital motion processor (DMP) capable of processing complex nine-axis 
MotionFusion algorithms [18].  The sensor fusion algorithms access external mag­
netometers or other sensors through an auxiliary I2C bus. The DMP engine in the 
sensor offloads complex sensor fusion, sensor timing synchronization, and gesture 
detection computations.

conductor [17].)
[         ]

14.5  Consumer Applications 
279
The MotionFusion algorithms provide digital output of the six or nine-axis 
data in rotation matrix, quaternion, Euler angles, or raw data format. Quaternion 
mathematics extends the imaginary plane to three-dimensional space [19]. Like 
Euler angles data, the mathematic approach involving three-dimensional rotations 
is especially useful in motion calculations.
14.5.2  Separate Fusion Software
Some suppliers develop sensor fusion software for a separate MCU or application 
processor. For its MEMS sensors, Freescale designed a sensor fusion reference plat­
form for Microsoft Windows 8. Twelve axes of sensor inputs including a three-axis 
accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer as well as pressure, temperature, and 
ambient light sensors demonstrate the software. Calculations in the 32-bit MCU 
include pass-through and calibration data as well as sensor fusion outputs [20].
Another approach for sensor fusion is a separate software product. STMicro­
electronics iNEMO engine is software that fuses accelerometer, gyroscope, and 
magnetometer data to provide accurate and reliable motion-sensing information 
that is easy to integrate into smart consumer devices [21].
The iNEMO Engine_PAAP software pack includes the iNEMO Engine as a 
precompiled library for ARM MCUs and is compatible with Android OSs starting 
from version 2.3.3. The software includes complete hardware abstraction layer 
(HAL) and API for algorithm setup and tuning.
14.5.3  Flexible Fusion Software
Providing designers options, including where the sensor fusion software runs, is 
another strategy. For example, Kionix software suite operates either as a hardware 
solution on an embedded MCU or as a software solution on an AP with a variety 
of three-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer inputs [22]. As shown 
in Figure 14.8, the API sensor framework always resides on an AP or CPU. In the 
hardware implementation, the human interface device (HID) is implemented in the 
MCU, whereas the software approach has HID formatting in the AP or CPU.
The solution’s scalability extends to different OS and sensor configurations. 
OS variations include embedded, fixed-point MCUs with a real-time OSs or float­
ing-point, 32-bit mobile-phone OSs such as Android and Windows 8 [23]. Sensor 
combinations supported by the software include accelerometer and magnetometer 
(AM), accelerometer and gyroscope (AG), and accelerometer, magnetometer, and 
gyroscope (AMG). For added user flexibility, the software supports third-party 
or custom-developed software for enhanced motion processing and application-
specific functions.
14.5.4  Agnostic Sensor Fusion
Movea, a motion-processing and data fusion technology company, does not sup­
ply MEMS sensors. As a result, it has a motion sensor fusion solution that works 
with sensors from essentially any sensor supplier [24]. The company’s MotionCore 
product line is a family of motion processing IP cores designed for mobile devices. 

280 
�������������
Sensor Fusion
Optimized for motion sensing and data fusion applications, the architectures run 
implementations of the company’s proprietary SmartMotion algorithms.
With claimed superiority to software-only solutions, the dedicated motion pro­
cessors, available as licensable IP cores, enable sensor, processor, and mobile plat­
form vendors to offer a complete motion processing solution. Using an approach 
called the chemistry of motion, Movea has identified fundamental human motion 
elements and a means to rapidly prototype new features based on the building 
blocks. The IP includes a set of modules for popular applications in indoor/pe­
destrian navigation, activity monitoring, motion gaming, augmented reality, and 
gesture-based device/application control.
Applied at the semiconductor level, the goal of SmartMotion software, firm­
ware, and tools is more intelligent sensing. The IP cores can be integrated directly 
into sensors, APs, MPUs, MCUs, and custom DSPs manufactured by semiconduc­
tor and MEMS companies. Additionally, MotionCore solutions come with a suite 
of reference stimuli and test patterns for system validation and libraries of industry 
MEMS characterization parameters.
14.5.5  Simulation and Testing
One final consideration for sensor fusion implementation is simulation and testing. 
Targeting the R&D environment, simulation software is available to test fusion al­
gorithms with inputs from a wide variety of MEMS sensors, including accelerome­
ters, gyroscope, magnetometer, digital compass, and barometric height sensors [25].

nix, Inc. [22].)

14.6  Application Example 
281
Spirent Communications’ SimSENSOR software works with the company’s 
multi-GNSS constellation simulators by simulating MEMS sensor outputs on a 
common trajectory with the simulated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) 
signals. The software includes MEMS noise models and error-correction tools for 
bias and drift that can be controlled by users.
14.6  Application Example
In addition to smart phones and tablet PCs, motion sensing enabled by sensor 
fusion has fundamentally changed several motion-based applications including 
interactive games, animation, training and simulation, and more. One area that 
demonstrates the new-found capability is a motion suit. An example is MVN iner­
tial motion capture suit from Xsens shown in Figure 14.9. The suit is a system for 
full-body human motion capture based on inertial sensors, biomechanical models, 
and sensor fusion algorithms [5]. The system’s 17 inertial trackers and the sensor 
Figure 14.9  The 6DoF tracking of body motion in the Xsens MVN Motion Capture system can be 
used in animation as well as medical and sports applications to analyze human movement and gait.

Sensor Fusion
fusion software allow motion capture without requiring cameras [26]. This saves 
users both time and money. 
An advanced human-body model provides the output of 23 body segments. 
The company’s MVN Studio, a Windows 7 application for motion capturing, dis­
plays a real-time visualization of the segments on a PC. Based on the use of a stabi­
lized Xsens sensor fusion algorithm, the dynamic accuracy is 2 deg RMS.
Applications of motion suits include: 
••
3-D character animation;
••
Game development— in-game and cinematics;
••
Film and visual effect (VFX)—on-set, stunts;
••
Live entertainment such as concerts and road shows;
••
Training and simulation.
Motion suits have become a popular means of supporting the motion require­
ments of these applications as well as demonstrating the motion sensing capability 
of IMU hardware and supporting sensor fusion software [27]. In addition, focused 
locations such as motion-controlled gloves have also been developed using IMUs 
and sensor fusion technology for demonstration purposes as well as real-world 
applications.
14.7  Summary 
The increasing capability and reduced pricing of multiaxes MEMS sensors and 32-
bit MCUs has brought motion sensing to numerous consumer applications based 
on the use of sensor fusion. Sensor fusion simplifies the processing of the data from 
the sensors and addresses the application requirements to put the data into context. 
However, sensor fusion is by no means limited to motion sensing and MEMS tech­
nology. The use of this computing technique is commonly being applied to auto­
mobiles and robots in a variety of situations. With fusion in any of its many forms, 
sensors make substantial progress in the area of smart technology and justify the 
term of smart sensor.

Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor 
Nodes
Who will replace billions of dead batteries?
	
	
	
—Steve Arms, MicroStrain, 2008 [1]
15.1  Introduction
One of the major aspects limiting more extensive use of wireless sensing technol­
ogy and WSNs is the need to eventually, periodically, or, in some cases, frequently 
change or recharge the batteries. Energy harvesting (EH), the conversion of ambi­
ent energy to electrical energy, provides a potential solution to this problem. For 
the right applications, energy harvesting promises to deliver the energy without any 
cost—once the transition to electricity has been paid for.
15.2  Applications Drive Technology Implementation and Development
While solar, wind, and water energy harvesting have been used for decades and even 
hundreds of years, self-powered, batteryless technology was commercialized within 
the last 10 years or so. Wireless sensors have provided a driving force for the new­
est technologies. According to an IDTechEx report, wireless sensors were expected 
to use 1.6 million energy harvesters, resulting in energy harvester sales of $13.75 
million in 2011 [2, 3]. The report’s authors expect the total market for energy har­
vesting devices to exceed $4 billion in 2021. In addition to the existing strength of 
consumer applications, industrial and health care EH applications are expected to 
provide substantial growth. However, there are many areas that can benefit from 
wireless sensors powered by energy harvesting.
15.2.1  Structural Health Monitoring 
Bridges, roadways, and other structures subject to stress and aging frequently have 
inherent vibration as an ambient energy source [4]. The 2007 collapse of the I-35W 
Bridge in Minnesota demonstrated a compelling and reinforcing case for this EH 

286 
�������������������������������������������
Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Nodes
application. Periodic monitoring including sensor embedded in the concrete could 
have prevented the tragedy. Existing technology has been used to show several 
products’ viability to detect and avoid problems in structural health applications.
15.2.2  Building Automations Systems
Building automation systems (BASs) can significantly reduce energy consumption. 
For example, the U.S. DOE reports that buildings consume 39% of the energy and 
74% of the electricity produced annually in the U.S. [5]. Occupancy, photovoltaic, 
and other sensors can reduce the use of lighting and heating and air conditioning 
and reduce the annual energy cost for a conference room in half by some estimates 
[2]. Wired solutions that cost hundreds of dollars per foot make wireless solutions 
very attractive—if battery maintenance can be avoided.
15.2.3  Industrial Applications
In industrial applications, equipment monitoring can avoid excessive and un­
planned downtime and the resulting expensive lost production. However, running 
wires to equipment that needs to be monitored is costly. One study has shown that 
wireless sensing with 18 self-powered sensors can be as much as $500 per sensor 
less than wired online monitoring [6]. Monitoring temperature and vibration can 
determine the health and efficiency of a variety of moving equipment in industrial 
applications [3].
15.2.4  Automotive
Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMSs) are a frequently cited automotive ap­
plication for energy harvesting. Capturing the energy generated from tire vibration 
using MEMS-based piezoelectric technology can displace the battery-based systems 
currently in use. However, several other possible applications exist, including roof-
mounted solar panels to power ventilation fans, and thermoelectric energy harvest­
ing from heat sources such as the catalytic converter to supplement or minimize the 
power from the vehicle’s alternator [7]. These techniques can improve the mileage 
on internal combustion powered vehicles as well as electric vehicles. With its large, 
130W solar glass roof, the Fisker Karma harnesses energy from the sun to extend 
the driving range for up to an additional 200 miles (322 km) annually [3, 8]. The 
solar glass system can also power milliwatt to fractions-of-a-watt sensors in the key 
off mode and avoid problems of excessively discharging the batteries.
15.2.5  Aircraft
Energy harvesting has been used for aircraft development for many years. Mov­
ing components and structural elements can be monitored by piezoelectric energy 
harvesters in both development and in service. Some researchers expect that future 
aircraft will employ extensive EH-powered sensor networks [9]. Each sensor will 
be powered by electricity produced by a thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a 
small water tank storing thermal energy. The TEG uses the temperature differ-

15.3  Complete System Consideration 
287
ence between the cold air in high altitudes and the water-based heat storing unit to 
generate electricity.
15.2.6  Portable Consumer 
Consumer electronics applications of calculators, toys, lighters, radios, and more 
are predicted to drive the sale of 600 million EH units in 2012 and 900 million 
units in 2017 [3, 7]. Separate from these are other consumer products including 
wristwatches, laptops/ebooks, and mobile phones that are poised for dramatic EH 
growth within the next 5 years. While energy harvesting may not eliminate the bat­
teries in these products, it can extend their use before requiring recharging.
15.2.7  Remote Distributed Applications
Large geographic areas that require constant monitoring including farmland or haz­
ardous waste sites are ideal targets for energy harvesting. For the farm, a variety of 
sensors including rain, humidity, temperature, and others can help avoid the loss of 
crops from temperature extremes, inadequate moisture in the soil, or overwatering. 
The number and widespread distribution of the sensing locations in many remote 
applications makes battery power an undesirable alternative. In addition, the EH 
solution can provide an increased level of reliability and prevent power interrup­
tions [5].
15.3  Complete System Consideration
EH techniques for converting mechanical or electrical energy, light, or temperature 
differences into energy for powering sensors include piezoelectric, RF, thermoelec­
tric, inductive coupling, electromagnetic, wind, and photoelectric technology. How­
ever, it takes more than an energy harvester to design a successful energy harvesting 
application. Figure 15.1 shows the blocks of an energy harvesting sensing node 
that include power management, MCU, transceiver, and some means of energy 
storage [2]. The energy storage element could be a small rechargeable battery or an 
ultracapacitor.
Every block in an EH-based wireless sensor network must avoid sapping the 
limited energy produced by the energy harvester including the sensor. 
To appreciate the limitations of today’s technologies, Table 15.1 summariz­
es the expectations for the power-generating capabilities of the most popular EH 
Figure 15.1  The energy harvesting system consists of several pieces that must all use minimum 
power.

288 
�������������������������������������������
Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Nodes
approaches. The capability of energy harvesting techniques varies over a wide 
range, so the end application must be carefully analyzed for its ability to ensure 
a minimum input level from the energy source. The voltage output of all of these 
sources typically varies from 0.5 to less than 10V.
15.4  EH Technologies
The implementation of energy harvesting technologies can vary considerably from 
supplier to supplier. In this section, production techniques for thermoelectric, piezo­
electric, photovoltaic, electromagnetic, RF, and electromechanical, switch-generated 
electrical energy will be explained including MEMS implementations. In addition, 
Section 15.4.8 will explore some future concepts that may greatly extend EH.
15.4.1  Thermoelectric EH
In thermoelectric energy harvesting, a temperature difference (ΔT) is essential to 
energy conversion. The TEG uses the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical 
power [10]. In the current generating mode, a p-n couple produces a current flow 
when a hot junction rejects heat and a cold junction absorbs heat. Increasing the 
number of PN couples increases the current and generating capabilities. Equation 
(15.1) shows how to calculate ZT, the thermoelectric figure-of-merit, for this pro­
cess [11].

where:
α = Seebeck coefficient (V/K)
ρ = electrical resistivity (Ω-cm)
σ = electrical conductivity (Ω-cm)-1
κ = thermal conductivity (W/mK)
T = mean temperature (absolute, K)
For high output, thermoelectric materials must have:
••
High Seebeck coefficient (V/K);
••
Low electrical resistivity (Ω-m);
••
Low thermal conductivity (W/mK).
Popular materials for TEGs include SiGe, PbTe, and Bi2Te3 [11].
15.4.1.1  Bulk TEG
Bulk TEGs use ceramic plates to sandwich the arrays of thermocouples into a ther­
mopile. Available bulk TEG products convert heat to electrical power by harvesting 
the thermal energy between [12]:
••
A higher-temperature solid surface and ambient air via natural convection;
••
A higher-temperature fluid stream and lower-temperature fluid stream;
••
A higher-temperature fluid stream and ambient air via natural convection.
The output of Marlow Industries’ EverGen solid air assembly is shown in Fig­
ure 15.2. The plot is only valid for the EHA-PA1AN1-R02-L1 that has a natural 
convection heat sink with a thermal resistance of about 15 K/W. The figure shows

tries Inc. [11].)

the power output of an LTC3108 DC-DC converter, whereas the power out of the 
TEG would be much higher. This family of products uses Bi2Te3 for high output at 
room (25°C) and medium (250°C) temperatures. Minimum start-up ∆Ts are 1°C 
for liquid source and liquid heat sink products and 5.5°C for other versions.
15.4.1.2  MEMS TEG
Micropelt uses a thin-film microelectronic process to develop a silicon-based MEMS 
thermogenerator. The working structure consists of leg pairs of n- and p-type mate­
rial separately produced and optimized on two different wafers to generate a volt­
age [13]. The thermoelectric Bi2Te3-related materials are deposited via sputtering 
[14]. Figure 15.3 shows the two-wafer structure.
The generated voltage is directly proportional to the number of leg pairs and 
the temperature difference between the top and bottom sides times the Seebeck 
coefficient. More than 100 leg pairs are possible on a square millimeter and a tem­
perature difference (ΔT) as small as 25°C can generate an open-circuit voltage in 
excess of 2.5V. With a heat load of 1W applied to thermogenerator with 450 leg 
pairs, over 2.5 mW can be generated with a ΔT of only 25°C as shown in Figure 
15.4. The products target applications that operate around room temperature.
While the differences between bulk and thin-film technology impact physical 
dimensions at the device level, the end product’s need for substantial heat sink to 
achieve effective output at a given ΔT minimizes these differences.

and the other with p-type material. (Courtesy of Micropelt GmbH [13, 14].)

15.4  EH Technologies 
291
15.4.2  Piezoelectric EH
In a piezoelectric energy harvester (PZEH), a vibrating structure produces an out­
put voltage from a piezoelectric (PZT) material. A common approach is a bi- or 
trimorph design operating in resonance. Figure 15.5 shows one version of this 
technique. 
For optimum efficiency, the resonant frequency of the PZEH needs to be tuned 
to each targeted vibration source. Table 15.2 shows the variations that exist for 
several vibration energy sources [15, 16]. To overcome the restrictions imposed by 
tuning, several researchers are investigating improvements to single, fixed-frequen­
cy operation [17]. Broadband resonant harvesters can consist of several resonators 
with different eigenfrequencies but add weight and typically operate somewhere off 
resonance. Frequency-tunable generators use the same total seismic mass to gener­
ate all frequencies but add complexity and consume additional power.

15.4.2.1  Ceramic PZEH Products
Several PZEH products are available. A few examples provide an idea of the kind of 
variations that exist. Some ceramic fiber piezoelectric harvesters, such as Advanced 
Cerametrics’ piezoelectric fiber composites (PFCs), can generate as much 40V pk-
pk [4]. Also, the company’s PFC biomorph (PFCB) can easily generate 400V pk-pk 
and much higher levels [18].
Smart Materials’ Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) is an array of machined rect­
angular piezoceramic fibers in an epoxy matrix [19, 20]. The thin (300 µm) flexible 
structure can be bonded to many surfaces using a two-part adhesive. Invented by 
NASA in 1996, MFC has applications in sensors, actuators, and energy harvesting.
Another flexible piezoelectric energy harvester is Midé’s Volture PZEH, shown 
in Figure 15.6. Depending on the product, the tip-to-tip displacement varies from 
0.03 to 0.15 in. To determine the application requirements, the company offers a 
stand-alone characterization product to measure the vibration environment.
Figure 15.7 shows the output of single-crystal piezoelectric PMN-PT and PZT-
based energy harvester developed by KCF Technologies. 
15.4.2.2  MEMS PZEH
MicroGen Systems, Inc.’s piezoelectric vibrational energy harvester uses MEMS 
technology [23].The BOLT060 micropower generators are 1.0 cm2 silicon-based 
chips or less that produce power levels up to 200 µW [23]. Two- and four-chip 
packaged versions have been developed as well. The MEMS structure of the PZEH 
device is shown in Figure 15.8 [24]. In an overall package size that is less than 0.7 
cm3, the MEMS harvester can generate a constant 100 µW at 0.5g.

15.4.3  Photovoltaic EH
Common photovoltaic (solar) cells use monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline sili­
con, amorphous silicon thin-film, and nonsilicon thin-film construction techniques 
[16]. Light exposure to a p-n junction creates a somewhat constant output current 
until the maximum power point (MPP) voltage is reached. Table 15.3 shows that 
even though the powered generated is substantially lower than sunlight, many light 
sources can still provide power for WSNs [25].

Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Nodes
15.4.4  Electromagnetic EH
Electromagnetic energy harvesters convert mechanical energy (vibration) to elec­
trical energy through an oscillating magnetic mass. The mass crosses a fixed coil 
creating a varying amount of magnetic flux and inducing a voltage according to 
Faraday’s law [26]. Mechanical tuning optimizes resonant frequency present within 
the application environment to maximize the power output.
The 100- and 120-Hz vibration bands found on machines makes them ideal 
candidates for electromagnetic technology. EH units such as Perpetuum’s Vibrating 
Energy Harvestors (VEHs) deliver 1 mW peak power at 25g with a 2-Hz half-pow­
er bandwidth. This results in more than 0.3 mW of power for 95% of the machines 
[27]. Figure 15.9 shows the trend of output versus machines.
Featuring a power output up to 20 mW, the Perpetuum Free-Standing Harvest­
er (PMG FSH), combines electromagnetic vibration energy harvesting technology 
with selectable energy charge, storage, and management options [4].
15.4.5  RF EH
Designed for extremely low power consumption, Powercast’s P2110 Powerhar­
vester receiver converts radio waves in the 850 to 950 MHz range into DC power 
[4]. As shown in Figure 15.10, the receiver stores the harvested energy into a capaci­
tor and boosts the voltage to provide a regulated supply to other EH components. 
The efficiency of the RF energy harvested is greater than 40% for input power levels 
from 0.2 to 10 mW. Figure 15.11 shows the efficiency and operating range of two 
915 MHz RF to DC converters [29].
15.4.6  Electromechanical EH
Pushing a rocker-style wall switch provides sufficient energy to activate EnOcean’s 
wireless EH system. As shown in Figure 15.12, when the spring snaps, electro­
magnetic induction produces a short voltage pulse lasting a few milliseconds. The 
conversion of mechanical energy into electric energy allows the transmission of the

switching signal over a distance of a few hundred meters, eliminating the need for 
wiring between the switch and the load in a building automation system.
15.4.7  Multiple Energy Sources
The choice of the energy harvesting technique depends on the energy source or 
sources that the WSN would normally experience. In some applications, more than 
one energy harvesting technique may be available and required to ensure a suffi­
cient amount of energy [13]. For example, for applications where both solar and 
vibration energy are available, Midé has combined its Volture vibration energy 
harvester with a solar energy harvester [31]. The company achieves a hybrid energy

harvester by incorporating an encapsulated solar panel into its Volture enclosure. 
The vibration portion is offered with either an 80 to 175 or 60 to 140 Hz range.
15.4.8  Future Concepts
The interest in energy harvesting and the need for improved technologies has moti­
vated several companies to investigate new techniques for higher performance and/
or lower cost. One company has a program in development for MEMS power har­
vesting. Figure 15.3 shows a feasibility demonstration prototype built as proof of 
concept with the possibility of scaling to the millimeter level. In addition to WSNs 
where periodic or vibrational mechanical energy can be converted into current flow, 
in static applications, the same multilayer planar coil processing can be utilized to 
fabricate an electromagnetic scavenging device.
Researchers at the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) are working on a 
hybrid piezoelectric energy harvesting transducer (HYPEHT) [33]. Unique design 
methodology allows the device to couple more mechanical energy, produce more

electrical charge, and yield greatly enhanced energy conversion efficiency compared 
to other methods. The HYPEHT produces 100 to 1,000 times more electrical en­
ergy output than a comparable bimorph or sandwich piezoelectric beam. The unit 
also achieves 26% mechanical to electrical energy conversion efficiency— a value 
five times greater than that of the state-of-the-art piezoelectric transducers.
15.5  Energy Storage
As indicated in Figure 15.1, once energy is harvested, some means of storing the 
energy is required. Storage techniques include batteries and ultracapacitors. This 
section provides insight into available techniques focused on energy harvesting 
applications.
15.5.1  Batteries
While one of the goals of energy harvesting is eliminating the need to replace the 
battery at a wireless node, this does not dictate that a battery cannot be used in an 
energy harvesting system. In fact, several companies have developed rechargeable 
thin-film batteries. Two examples are Cymbet Corporation and Infinite Power Solu­
tions [4].
Cymbet’s EnerChip solid-state battery is available in 50-, 12-, and 5-µAh pack­
aged products [34]. The rechargeable energy cells have a nominal 3.8V or 3.3V 
output. In addition, the EnerChip CBC050-BDC is a 50-µAh (with a life cycle ca­
pacity of 25 mAh) solid state battery bare die (5.7 mm × 6.1 mm × 200 µm thick) 
intended for copackaging with other ICs in a single package or multichip module. 
The 12- and 5-µAh versions are also available in bare die format with appropri­
ately smaller size as as well as a 1-µAh version that is only 1.375 mm × 0.85 mm 
× 200 µm thick.
Infinite Power Solutions microenergy cell (MEC) solid-state batteries are 
available in a variety of capacities from 0.13 to 2.5 mAh [35]. For example, the 
THINERGY MEC102, is a 4.1V solid-state, thin-film, rechargeable single-cell bat­
tery available in 1.7 and 2.5 mAh capacities. Capable of providing up to 10 mWh 
(36 J) of energy, the 25.4 × 50.8 × 0.17 mm units have a high discharge rate capa­
bility of 100 mA (continuous) and 300 mW (continuous) [4].

�������������������������������������������
Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Nodes
15.5.2  Ultracapacitors 
An ultracapacitor or supercapacitor is an energy storage device that utilizes high 
surface area carbon to deliver much higher energy density than conventional ca­
pacitors [36]. With capacitances in mF and higher levels instead of µF, three orders 
of magnitude or more energy is available. In many energy harvesting applications, 
ultracapacitors provide a viable alternative to battery storage.
For example, CAP-XX G and H Series supercapacitors have demonstrated 
performance capabilities required for low-power energy harvesting systems. These 
capabilities include operating over a wide temperature range, low leakage current, 
minimal initial charging current, and predictable self-discharge characteristics [4]. 
Figure 15.14 demonstrates the ease of implementing an ultracapacitor with avail­
able power management energy harvesting ICs.
CAP-XX general purpose (G-prefix) (-40°C to 70°C) supercapacitors have 
nominal operating voltage of 4.5V and 2.3V and high-temperature (H-prefix) 
(-40°C to 85°C) units are available in 5.5V and 2.75V ratings. Table 15.4 shows 
the parameters for the smallest product in each category.
15.6  Energy Budget
With the limited energy available from any energy harvesting source, optimal de­
sign considerations and the energy budget are among the critical design aspects in 
any EH system. Power management ICs, ultralow power MCUs, software, wireless 
transmitters, and sensors must all operate at minimal power levels.
15.6.1  Power Management ICs
Power management is such a major design issue for EH systems that leading analog 
IC companies have designed ICs for specific EH sources. The analog IC handles the

15.6  Energy Budget

conversion of the voltage level to appropriate levels for other portions of the system 
including charging the battery or supercapacitor [13]. In some cases, this requires 
boosting the voltage from a level of a few volts to several volts required for the sen­
sor and transceiver.
For example, Linear Technology has developed a family of energy harvesting 
products. Designed specifically for low-input voltage sources such as TEGs, the 
LTC3108 is an ultralow voltage dc-dc converter and power manager. The chip can 
collect and dispense surplus energy in energy harvesting systems. Other EH power 
management ICs include the LTC3588-1 that provides the power supply for piezo­
electric energy harvesting (see Figure 15.14) and the LT3652, which can be used as 
a battery charger in solar power applications [4].
15.6.2  MCUs
A very low power consumption MCU handles the proper operation of the com­
plete WSN [13]. Companies including Texas Instruments, Microchip Technology, 
and others have developed MCUs with extremely low power consumption and 
specifically applied them to energy harvesting applications. For the lowest energy 
consumption, designers must [38]:
••
Optimize duty-cycle, maximum time in standby;
••
Power manage sensors;
••
Effectively use intelligent peripherals;
••
Utilize efficient nonvolatile data storage;
••
Implement power aware software.
MCUs, and especially their low-power capabilities, are always undergoing con­
stant improvement. Microchip Technology’s nanowatt extreme low power (XLP) 
MCUs have sleep currents below 20 nA [4]. Additional low-power MCU attributes 
for stingy energy harvesting systems include the watchdog timer, real-time clock, 
and run currents.
The software routines developed by users play an equally important role to the 
hardware that runs their algorithms. EH MCU designers caution users that their 
skills must be sharpened even more in EH WSNs to cope with the limited power 
available. A simple example of a pitfall to avoid is an endless loop calculation that

would impose a 100% CPU load, when a setup timer for the output requires 0% 
CPU time [38].
Ten energy tips for EH systems include [39]:
1.	 Optimize the system for low average power.
2.	 Firmware efficiency is essential—avoid loops.
3.	 Use hardware timers and interrupts.
4.	 Isolate loads—all loads should be switchable.
5.	 Avoid power leakage—backfeeding through other devices.
6.	 Trade-off net power between dynamic and static power. (In some cases, 
processing with high power consumes less energy than slow processing 
with low power. It is usually better to process data and send the answer 
instead of sending data.)
7.	 Understand the implications of power-up sequencing for proper timing to 
minimize power to each device.
8.	 Use MCU vendor’s hints and tricks to minimize power.
9.	 Use energy processing devices that provide status indications to make in­
formed power management decisions.
10.		 Minimize wireless protocols and topology.
15.6.3  Wireless Transmission
Typically, the biggest energy consumer in an EH system is the RF transmitter. In 
addition to the wireless communication protocol, the transceiver must also have 
extremely low power in both active and wait or even sleep modes [13]. Figure 
15.15 demonstrates current consumption in the various portions of the transmis­
sion cycle. The one-second snapshot shows the current draw of 15 mA for the 
7.5-ms receive or transmit portion versus 700 nA for the radio in sleep mode and 

15.6  Energy Budget

comprises over 90% of the total 33-nAh (392-µJ) energy consumption [39]. This is 
just one example of minimizing the current draw to transmit or receive sensor data.
Compatible with piezoelectric, electrodynamic, solar, RF field, and thermo­
electric harvesters, MicroStrain’s EH-link Energy Harvesting Wireless Node with 
an IEEE 802.15.4 radio consumes 12 µJ at start-up, only 105 µJ for either an ac­
celerometer or humidity sensor measurement, and 92 µJ to transmit the data [4].
EnOcean energy harvesting wireless sensor solution consumes 50 µWs (µJ) to 
transmit a signal 300m (in a free field), since the signal duration process starts, 
executes, and completes in less than a thousandth of a second [40].
Some wireless EH applications use Semtech’s SX1230 integrated RF transmit­
ter that operates in 315-, 434-, 868-, and 915-MHz bands [41]. The IC achieves 
stable RF output power of less than ±0.5 dB and negligible frequency drift over 
an operating voltage range from 3.7V down to 1.8V [42]. For this IC, the average 
current for periodic operation of 1 second is 16 µA. Table 15.5 shows the current 
and duration in all modes.
These examples demonstrate an industrywide effort to minimize power con­
sumption for the wireless transmission in EH systems. New generations of trans­
mitter ICs will include an increasing amount of advanced features to address even 
lower power consumption. 
15.6.4  Sensor Power Consumption
The sensor in an EH system also requires close scrutiny for its power consumption. 
Many MEMS sensors use capacitive sensing and draw minimum power. However, 
low power is not always an inherent parameter for many sensors. An interesting 
example is a resistive sensor that normally draws a substantial amount of current 
in an analog measurement [43].
Typically, a Wheatstone bridge would have 350Ω strain gauge that could be in­
creased to 1 K-Ω or more to reduce the current draw. If the bridge is not turned off, 
a 1 K-Ω bridge with 3V applied draws 3 mA continuously. Simply switching the 
bridge on to make a reading and then off can still have the current on for relatively 
long time to stabilize the reading. 
An alternative hardware architecture uses a time to digital converter (TDC) 
instead of an analog measurement. Making the measurement in the time domain by 
combining the resistors of the bridge with a capacitor and only energizing the strain 
gauge for about 100 µS saves power and minimizes self-heating effects. Similar

Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Nodes
alternative approaches may allow the use of other sensors that would otherwise be 
deemed unacceptable for an EH application.
15.7  Development Systems
Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing energy harvesting is the total sys­
tem approach that must be taken by users to achieve a viable solution. One of the 
solutions to the complexity involved in optimizing every aspect of an energy har­
vesting system is a completely or almost completely engineered system such as the 
one shown in Figure 15.16. In addition to addressing all of the system’s aspects, 
this design can handle energy harvesting inputs from several EH sources, including 
piezoelectric, inductive, photovoltaic, and thermoelectric harvesters [1].
An alternative solution to reducing design complexity is a development kit. 
Recognizing the challenges of optimizing all the pieces of an EH system, essentially 
all of the companies pursuing energy harvesting applications have development 
kits, boards, tools of some sort, and in some cases software to efficiently manage 
the harvesting, measurement, and transmission processes. Rather than duplicating 
efforts, suppliers of different parts of the system have readily collaborated. Figure 
15.17 shows a development board designed for low-power RF harvesting. With a 
simplified design-in process, the available energy can be tapped for many wireless 
measurements [44].
Powercast’s RF-powered wireless sensor module uses its P2110 Powerhar­
vester receiver, Microchip Technology’s PIC24 XLP MCU and MRF24J40 (IEEE 
802.15.4) radio technology, and supercapacitor storage to make temperature, hu­
midity, and light measurements without requiring a battery [44]. The capacitor in 
the system is a 50 mF but it could be as low as 3,300 µF. The wireless protocol in 
the radio module (MRF24J40MA) is Microchip Technology’s proprietary MiWi™ 
P2P (peer to peer), a lower power alternative to the ZigBee protocol.
The system’s operating steps include [44]:
••
Accumulate energy in capacitor;
••
Power MCU upon reaching charge threshold;
••
Power and read sensors;
••
Measure received signal strength indicator (RSSI);
••
Format data packet;
••
Transmit data packet (broadcast-only);
••
Turn off power (go dormant).
Development tools where the EH, MCU, battery or ultracapacitor supplier, 
and others have collaborated should provide a high degree of success to the initial 
design and considerable reduce the design cycle time.

15.8  Application Example
KCF Technologies Wireless Vibration Monitoring System installed on two 1,200-
ton chillers has produced outstanding results. In addition to piezoelectric energy 
harvesting, the system includes six wireless accelerometers, a wireless network man­
ager, and software for vibration diagnostics.
The system transmits vibration data on a regular schedule (from 5 minutes to 
12 hours) for trend diagnostics with power supplied by piezoelectric energy har­
vesters (see Figure 15.18). The sensors provide continuous amplitude monitoring 
to detect transients with software identifying and recording the transients.
KCF’s system identifies and filters peak frequencies of interest. A remote online 
station monitors the real-time status of the machine. Figure 15.19 shows the data 
from an application.
In addition to saving an average of $580 per installed sensor based on avoid­
ing the cost of wiring and installation, the monitoring system saves other costs as 
shown in Table 15.6. The EH-powered system has demonstrated its capability to 
reduce costs and positively impact the user’s bottom line.
15.9  Summary
With the potential for dozens of years of operation without requiring a battery 
change or any maintenance, energy harvesting promises a new era for wireless sens­
ing. At least one supplier has stated that its harvesters are designed to last over a 
hundred years. If the harvester has sufficient energy and meets the application’s cost 
objectives, an increasing number of users will include EH in new designs. However, 
the technology is still in its early stages and will have to progress much further to 
match expected performance and cost objectives.

Active EH research by the U.S. government and many universities targets ap­
plying the technology into many more of today’s existing applications as well as 
entirely new ones. New materials and design techniques are among the advances 
that will increase the use of energy harvesting to achieve perpetually powered sys­
tems. WSNs will be among the major beneficiaries of EH advances towards making 
ubiquitous sensing a reality.

16.1  Introduction
Several technologies can be combined to develop the next generation of smart sens­
ing systems. This has been possible for many years and is indeed the basis of many 
instruments such as the Fabry-Perot interferometer, blood testing systems, and the 
camera-on-a-chip. What makes the future possibilities exciting is the scale (size and 
number) of the sensors enabled by the combination of micromachining and micro­
electronics. The size of semiconductor sensors is directly proportional to the cost 
of the sensor, and the cost is inversely proportional to the volume of applications. 
When cost barriers are broken, laboratory curiosities become a part of everyday 
life. Accelerometers for air bag systems in cars, disposable blood pressure sensors 
for medical applications, and three-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes for motion 
sensing in smart phones have demonstrated the extent that a cost-effective sensing 
technology can displace a previous technology or create a new application. This is 
especially true with on-chip or package-level integration.
Smart sensors can be stand-alone elements of simple products or distributed 
in complex networks such as a factory, or a vehicle. The availability of standards 
should expedite the development of networked sensors, especially the smarter 
versions. In a growing number of portable consumer electronic products such as 
smartphones or interactive entertainment devices, sensors’ signals are used inside 
the device with board-level interfaces such as SPI or I2C. However, even these prod­
ucts use sensor signals communicated through a personal area network (PAN) for 
added functionality.
The combination of several or all of the topics discussed in this book will create 
new control, communication, entertainment products, and more. These new prod­
ucts may require several enabling technologies that are in the process of achiev­
ing manufacturing status. Aggressive semiconductor industry roadmaps, heavy

investment in R&D for sensors, and the large number of participants in sensor 
technology and manufacturing promise to continue delivering a variety of competi­
tive products with increasing focus on the smart aspects of these sensors.
Many industry experts are actively trying to define the next killer app for 
MEMS technology. While they share ideas at technical and commercialization con­
ferences, a MEMS device in development today could be many years from achiev­
ing full commercial status. As shown in Table 16.1, the product evolution to full 
commercialization phase for today’s successes for MEMS-based sensors and other 
products has encompassed decades [5]. Note that the median time for discovery 
is 10 years, for product evolution is 8 years, and for cost reduction/application 
expansion is 12 years. This is a total of 30 years from discovery to full production. 
Bio/chemical and RF sensors have yet to achieve full production.
MEMS technology that forms the basis of many of the smart sensors discussed 
in this book has proven to be a disruptive force. Disruptive technology upsets 
the status quo in an industry. In the case of MEMS, the market pull has brought 
process-technology and packaging companies into the regime of IC manufacturers 
and their suppliers.
16.2  Future Sensor Plus Semiconductor Capabilities
The rapid growth of electronic products including those that use sensors occurs 
from the highly predictable nature of ICs to increase performance and reduce costs. 
Based on Moore’s law, named for Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, the number 
of transistors integrated in an IC doubles every 2 years [6]. Taking into account 
the number of transistors and increased operating speed, the performance doubles 
every 18 months. This improvement has been documented since 1971 and used to 
predict advanced generation of IC products and their technology requirements. The 
International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) has made predic­
tions for 15 years into the future for many years.

16.2  Future Sensor Plus Semiconductor Capabilities 
311
Sensors do not progress according to Moore’s law. In 2011, ITRS included 
MEMS for the first time, based in part on justification provided by an earlier white 
paper and other organizations’ efforts [6, 7]. The term “more-than-Moore” (MtM) 
describes the portions of electronics systems that do not necessarily scale at the 
same rate as the digital portion described by Moore’s law. Figure 16.1 shows how 
these added technologies enable interaction with users and the outside world.
ITRS’ addition of MEMS includes some previous roadmap activity by the In­
ternational Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (iNEMI) [8]. The biennial iNEMI 
report contains a chapter devoted to understanding the evolution of MEMS tech­
nology and the technical challenges to achieving the manufacturing capabilities 
that will be required over the next 10 years [9].
Other roadmap activity has also been performed by the Micro and Nanotech­
nology Commercialization Foundation (MANCEF). MANCEF developed the first 
international roadmap based on both micro- and nanotechnologies in 2003 [6, 10].
Based on the MEMS industries’ reliance on technology for future growth, 
industry experts initiated an effort called the Trillion Sensor Roadmap in 2012 
[11]. The TSensors organization will develop a 10-year market forecast focused 
on very high volume sensor applications for emerging smart systems. Figure 16.2 
shows three proposed paths to a trillion sensors. Driving forces for achieving the 
implementation of a trillion sensors include the Internet of Things, Central Ner­
vous System for the Earth (CeNSE), Sensory Swarms, Context-Aware Computing, 
eHealth/mHealth, and other applications supporting solutions of global issues and 
problems [11].
16.2.1  Monolithic Versus Package-Level Integration 
One of the major decisions for how to add intelligence to MEMS sensors is mono­
lithic (wafer-level) or package-level integration. The ITRS projects that “the

biochips. (Courtesy of Semiconductor Industry Association [6].)

The Next Phase of Sensing Systems 
integrated MEMS multimode sensors (with accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetom­
eters, and a pressure sensor) are expected to reach 10 DOF in the package by 2015, 
moving on to integration at the wafer-level and/or chip-level by 2017” [6]. With 
this being one of the most aggressively pursued areas for many suppliers, it should 
serve as the leading edge for integration technologies.
Package-level integration has predominantly been the means of achieving smart 
sensor to date. However, some movement toward monolithic smart sensors has oc­
curred. For example, Figure 16.3 shows a monolithic dual-axis accelerometer with 
integrated digital circuitry (see Section 2.9).
Packaging-level integration still has a long and useful future. Figure 16.4 
shows package-level integration for the entire system that includes sensors, such as 
Figure 16.2  The timing of 1 trillion sensors based on three projections. (Courtesy of TSensors/
Janusz Bryzek [11].)

biosensors, and MEMS devices that may or may not be sensors [13]. The 3-D pack­
aging concept targets the complete system but selected portions could be sensor-
specific systems, such as a WSN with energy harvesting (see Section 10.4.5).
16.3  Future System Requirements
Megatrends and global societal needs such as advanced and mobile health care, 
improved safety, and security, clean water and air, and increased energy efficiency 
drive many developments including sensors. Major government, university, and 
industry R&D activity in these areas will identify the technology requirements to 
address the challenges. Prior efforts by these institutions are the basis of the devel­
opments cited in this book. Government interest in commercializing R&D provides 
manufacturers and universities the opportunity to work with national laboratories 
and take the next step with offsetting government funds.
In 2000, the second edition of Understanding Smart Sensors predicted, “Oth­
er areas that are growing rapidly are handheld portable products. Today’s highly 
mobile society uses technology in a variety of portable applications... Finding the 
smart sensor applications in portable products could open new markets for these 
products.” Certainly, motion sensing in smart phones and tablet PCs has helped 
fulfill that prediction.
Several brief examples in this section demonstrate research that could produce 
the next enabling technology for sensors that will appear before 2020.
16.3.1  Sensing in Automobiles
Automobiles have been a major driving force for MEMS and other sensor technolo­
gies. Pressure sensors for engine control systems and accelerometers for air bags 
systems brought these MEMS technologies from laboratories into high-volume pro­
duction. Engine, transmission, antilock braking, automated suspension systems, 
electric power steering, air bag, and tire pressure monitoring systems are just a few

The Next Phase of Sensing Systems 
of the widely available vehicle systems that have driven sensor technology. Figure 
16.5 shows some of the sensors that could be implemented in the near future [14].
16.3.1.1  Self-Driving Cars
Autonomous cars that operate without driver assistance will drive a high level of 
sensor fusion and the cost reduction of vision sensing technologies. While these 
vehicles may seem to be a long way in the future, the Association for Unmanned 
Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) is working toward a goal of having them as 
a viable means of transportation by 2022—less than a decade away [15]. With the 
inaugural Driverless Car Summit, AUVSI brought together industry experts. Car 
companies actively working on combining adaptive cruise control with automatic 
steering towards some level of autonomous driving include Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, 
and Mercedes-Benz [16]. GM’s Super Cruise system in development for Cadillac 
may be on production vehicles as soon as 2015. 
The amount of control relinquished by the driver to the vehicle remains one of 
the unresolved issues but crash avoidance technology that automatically brakes if 
sensors detect that the vehicle is approaching another vehicle too rapidly is already 
being offered. On Google’s self-driving car, the crash avoidance system costs about 
$150,000 with $70,000 attributed to the lidar technology [16]. Reducing the cost 
of lidar and vision sensing cameras will play a critical role in determining how ex­
tensively these systems are deployed in vehicles.
16.3.1.2  Wireless Sensing in the Networked Vehicle
RF technology adds another dimension to smart sensors in vehicle applications. It 
is possible to envision small MEMS structures in WSNs powered by appropriate 
energy harvesting technology interfacing to the vehicle’s CAN bus through Blue­
tooth or other wireless technology. One possible vehicle application is a wireless 
version of an electronic nose to detect airborne substances and odors [17]. This 
device could be mounted in an existing automotive component such as a dome light 
Figure 16.5  Sensors in the car. (After: [14].)

16.3  Future System Requirements 
315
housing. The dome light’s housing provides a central position in the car for the nose 
to function similar to a home smoke and/or chemical detector. Rather than sound 
an audible alarm, the sensor would send a wireless signal to a remote receiver/inter­
preting device in the vehicle for analysis before notifying the driver.
Wireless sensory capability could expand to other defense mechanisms to detect 
and react to other harmful or undesirable occurrences in the vehicle. For example, 
the driver or passenger(s) could wear a sensing system that transmitted the driver’s 
physical state. Patients with potentially debilitating conditions such as heart condi­
tion, epilepsy, or diabetes would be prime target for such sensing systems adding to 
the total number of RF sensing nodes in the vehicle.
A few car companies are actively working in the area of health and wellness in 
the vehicle [18]. For example, Ford is investigating how its SYNC system’s connec­
tivity capability could be used in the area of health and wellness. The Ford SYNC 
system allows users to bring a cell phone into their vehicle and wirelessly connect 
through Bluetooth to vehicle-based systems including the dash display and audio 
system.
Cell-phone connectivity in the vehicle can be used for medical applications. The 
car recognizes the patient by his/her cell phone, which may allow the implementa­
tion of in-vehicle health systems without exposing patient confidentiality. With the 
in-vehicle networking capability, Ford is partnering with companies to research 
how technology related to patient health could be implemented in its vehicle.
One example is the development of a seat that monitors the driver’s heart rate. 
Six electrode sensors in the backrest monitor the driver’s heart rate to provide a 
contactless electrocardiograph (ECG). The technology could be linked with other 
vehicle systems to reduce risk for drivers with heart conditions.
In another project with Medtronic, a leading supplier of medical equipment, 
researchers are working on a prototype system that allows SYNC to connect via 
Bluetooth to a Medtronic continuous glucose monitoring device on a diabetic pa­
tient [18]. Such connectivity provides glucose levels and trends to the driver or 
passenger patient through the vehicle’s audio system and its center stack display. If 
levels drop too low, a secondary alert occurs.
Based on the amount of time that people spend in automobiles and the impor­
tance of the driver’s health for well-being and safety, increased use of smart sensors 
for driver and passenger monitoring can be expected in the future as performance, 
reliability, and cost goals for in-vehicle systems are met.
16.3.2  Sensing in Smart Phones  
Consumer electronics has superseded automotive as the driving force behind MEMS 
sensors [19]. The smart phone is just one example of the extent of sensors in a con­
sumer electronics product. Table 16.2 summarizes the sensors that can readily be 
found in a smart phone, especially an iPhone. This is certainly just the beginning. 
Humidity, bar code scanning, RFID, heart monitoring, perspiration/mood detect­
ing, and chemical sensors are being discussed as possible additions. For those users 
whose favorite sensor is not integrated in the phone, there would be an app and 
additional sensors that could be added.

316 
����������������������������������
The Next Phase of Sensing Systems 
16.3.3  Health Care Sensors
Health care applications have been a major beneficiary of the automotive and con­
sumer electronics industries need for MEMS sensors. Health care is an important 
area for many electronics companies, since spending in this area is 8% to 16% of 
developed countries’ gross domestic products [20]. Of that, 75% to 85% involves 
chronic disease management. For example, there are over 300 million diabetics in 
the world. Thus, patient monitoring, including connectivity to a wireless gateway, 
has become big business. Figure 16.6 shows the sensor connectivity in a PAN [21]. 
Security including cryptography is expected to play an increasingly important role 
for the data from the sensors in these systems.
16.4  Software, Sensing, and the System
Software provides such a critical portion of the smarts in smart sensing that the ini­
tial figure shown in Chapter 1 needs to be modified to reflect its presence and value. 
Figure 16.4 shows a more meaningful summary of the contents of a smart sensor. 
The software not only allows the modification of basic sensor functions but also 
adds the ability to adapt to changing application requirements. The sensor element

is increasingly a multiaxis, multiparameter (high, medium, and low range) and even 
multisensor aspect in the smartest sensors.
Sensing’s role in the system expands with two of the newest driving forces for 
electronic products: apps and cloud computing.
16.4.1  Sensor Apps
As many as 182.7 billion apps may be downloaded annually by 2015 [22]. Sensor-
specific applications are among the numerous apps developed for smart phones. 
One example is a blood pressure monitor that connects to an iPhone, iPad, or iPod 
Touch [23]. The system uses an automatically inflating cuff with air pump at 15 
mmHg/sec. Operating between 10°C to 40°C and 15% to 90% RH, the unit has a 
measurement range for pressure from 0 to 250 mmHg and for pulses of 30 to 200 
beats/min. The monitor stores the patient’s measurements in the iPhone, iPad, or 
iPod Touch devices and the mobile device transmits the results to the company’s 
website for easy access from an internet browser. The company also makes a smart 
baby monitor that allows users to monitor noise, movement, temperature, and hu­
midity in their child’s environment from their smart phone.
Another sensor app allows users to easily collect data from pH sensors and 
display the data on an iPhone, iPod, or iPad [24] (see Figure 16.8). While the app is 
free from the download store, the PH-1 meter accessory and pH electrodes are sold 
separately or as a kit. The pH electrode measures over a 0- to 14-pH range with 
accuracy to ±0.01 pH. The free app displays pH, millivolts, ambient temperature, 
and solution temperature in real time. When used with a GPS-enabled device, the 
pH meter app records measurements with both time stamp and geographic coordi­
nates, eliminating transcription errors and improving efficiency.
Using the acceleration and GPS sensors already in their smartphones, another 
app allows users to provide road status and repair requirements to city officials 
[25]. With the app installed and activated before a drive, the phone’s accelerometer 
senses a bump, the GPS records the location, and the phone transmits the data to a

remote server. With several users sharing data, a city can obtain data and focus on 
repairing the most frequently occurring problems. While the idea is not foolproof 
at present (what driver aims at the worst pothole?), the concept shows how shared 
data from numerous inputs can improve the environment for all.
With cell phones either built into a vehicle, such as General Motors’ OnStar or 
brought in through in-vehicle systems such as Ford’s SYNC, vehicles are an increas­
ing target for apps. The apps include obtaining input from onboard vehicle sensors. 
Car manufacturers use data in the vehicle’s onboard networks to alert owners of 
vehicle’s maintenance and service requirements. Apps can interpret the on-board 
diagnostic network (OBD-II), convey the charge status of an electric vehicle (EV)

Ongoing research seeks to improve the quality and usefulness of aggregated 
data from cell phones, vehicles, and other sensors. Emerging techniques help iden­
tify “real” data from noise and sensor errors. Sensor fusion plays an essential role 
in this process [26]. The virtual sensors created from the aggregated data provide 
an “easy-to-use framework for combining data from a multitude of sensors to ad­
vance to the next level of context awareness.”
16.4.2  Cloud Sensing
Cloud computing and apps go hand in hand in many areas. Market research firm 
IDC expects cloud computing technology to generate 14 million jobs globally by 
2015 [27]. Sensor companies expect to get their fair share of these jobs.
In cloud computing, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enables the 
IoT. For real-time monitoring and control, each M2M node has the capability to 
interact with the intelligence at remote collection points and related servers [28]. 
Figure 16.9 shows the connectivity. One or more sensors in the end M2M nodes 
report physical conditions to a remote site or are used with local embedded intelli­
gence. Aggregator devices connect multiple nodes. A gateway connects many mesh 
sensor networks and separate M2M nodes to a cellular network and then the cloud

magazine [28].)

The Next Phase of Sensing Systems 
for distribution to M2M servers. An application may have multiple PANs from 
ZigBee, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth WSN connections that report to a separate gateway.
Vehicle manufacturers already obtain diagnostic data from the vehicle’s OBDII 
and other onboard systems diagnostics. The data is sent by built-in (OnStar in 
GM vehicles) or brought in cell phones (in Ford’s SYNC system) and goes to the 
cloud for use by the manufacturer to alert drivers to maintenance and other vehicle 
requirements. Carmakers’ use of the cloud for these and other apps will increase. 
Ford expects cloud-based software upgrades to simplify customers’ ability to keep 
their vehicles up-to-date not unlike computer software manufacturers [29]. A con­
cept vehicle uses the cloud to understand driver behavior and travel patterns. This 
allows the vehicle to be proactive and alert the driver about destinations and adjust 
the control strategies for charging the battery in its plug-in-hybrid powertrain.
These are just a few examples of how cloud computing can take advantage of 
the capabilities of existing smart sensors. The cloud will be an essential driver of 
smart sensor applications and define the requirements for entirely new generations 
of smart sensors.
16.5  Trusted Sensing
Based on the extensive connectivity to wireless networks and the Internet, one of 
the stumbling blocks that could limit or delay the trillion sensor future is security 
issues. With increased computing capability, sensors will be vulnerable to the same 
hacking issues that have plagued computers and networks. Researchers have recog­
nized the importance of sensors in numerous security-sensitive wireless applications 
including e-commerce, e-wallet, and e-health [30]. 
End points, the M2M connections, are traditionally difficult to authenticate to 
the network [31]. This includes a plant’s automation and control networks, such 
as SCADA systems, and more. The connected sensors in these networks pose ad­
ditional problems to quality of service if hackers gain access through weak links in 
the network. 
With sensors, the security threats may not only come from the outside. For 
example, vehicles with drunk driver protection sensing or monitors for obtaining 
insurance rate reductions or monitoring devices so parents can know if their child 
is driving too fast may also be spoofed or modified by the users [32, 33]. But car­
makers are concerned as well, since the wireless infotainment systems link to the 
vehicles’ network on-board control systems. 
To provide the required security, trusted sensors have been proposed [30]. 
Trust often requires authenticity and integrity of sensor readings. Exactly how the 
trust should be established is still being determined but there are examples based on 
trusted hardware and software that have been developed for computers, networks, 
and portable wireless devices [31].
Figure 16.10 shows a high-level architecture for trusted sensors [30]. Sensor-
based attestation (validation) between a mobile device and the cloud protect the 
sensor reading’s integrity and demonstrate its authenticity. The middle layer runs 
application code to locally transform the sensor readings before uploading the in­
formation to the cloud. To preserve the integrity of the readings once they are pro­
cessed, the local processing needs to be isolated from the OS. 

16.6  Alternate Views of Smart Sensing 
321
Trusted sensors can be built both in software and in hardware. For systems 
with an onboard trusted platform model (TPM) a software-only architecture can 
be implemented [32]. The TPM, in most cases an ASIC with a dedicated structure 
to establish a hardware root of trust, is available in over 500 million enterprise-
level computers today and versions have been defined for mobile products [31]. 
The software solution uses the TPM to establish accountability and sign readings 
including when, where, and the clock readings. Once the readings are signed by the 
TPM, they cannot be modified.
The hardware solution integrates a TPM-like functionality into each individual 
sensing device [32]. This would allow the transmission of signed raw sensor read­
ings. Both the software and hardware solutions have challenges that researchers 
are investigating. Recognizing the potential problem at this point in time provides 
a significant advantage—if it is appropriately addressed. Otherwise, as the number 
of connected smart sensors grows, the threat of incorrect and potentially harmful 
data could increase as well.
16.6  Alternate Views of Smart Sensing
The smart sensing definition in Chapter 1 is part of IEEE 1451 standard. However, 
as the technology has been evolving, other definitions have been offered that show 
a different view of smart sensing technology and offer insight to what researchers 
think is in the future for smart sensors. Two examples will be presented.
One prior view of smart sensing proposed that a “smart sensor is defined as 
one that is capable of: (i) providing a digital output; (ii) communicating through 
bi-directional digital bus; (iii) being accessed through a specific address; and (iv) 
executing commands and logical functions” [34]. The smart sensor also has desir­
able functions such as compensation of secondary parameters (e.g., temperature), 
failure prevention and detection, self-testing, autocalibration, and various compu­
tationally intensive operations. The emphasis on computing attributes in this defi­
nition necessitates an MCU as a minimum requirement for a smart sensor.
Another previously proposed definition stated “a smart sensor consists of a 
transducer combined with other signal conditioning and other circuitry to produce 
Figure 16.10  A trusted sensor architecture. (Courtesy of Microsoft Research [30].)

322 
����������������������������������
The Next Phase of Sensing Systems 
output information signals that have been logically operated on to increase the val­
ue of the information to the system” [35]. The aspects of added signal conditioning 
and increased information value are noteworthy in this definition. The author lists 
sensor characteristics that take several sensors from the simplest to smartest ver­
sion. Figure 16.11 shows these characteristics.
Other’s definition of smart sensors can vary considerably. For example, INW, 
a company that serves the environmental industry asks, “What makes a sensor 
smart?” [36]. Their answer is, “we engineer our Smart Sensors with enhancements 
that record data, control system operations, communicate over a network, and 
much more.” This type of company-centric response to the capability enabled by 
smart sensors will most likely proliferate.
The key to smart sensing will be in the ability to satisfy users, not those mak­
ing definitions. Sensor manufacturers will apply the term smart sensor to a product 
even if it does not meet an industry definition. But customers selecting those sen­
sors that directly impact the performance and value of their product will determine 
the truly smart sensors. It is hoped that this book has in some manner provided 
guidance to designers, manufacturers, and users of smart sensors to understand 
their potential in control systems and other applications. 
16.7  The Smart Loop
Smarter sensors require adding intelligence to the sensor. The easiest way to add 
intelligence is by using an MCU or ASIC to provide computing capability and 
digital communication. Today, many package-level and even monolithic combina­
tions of these technologies are in mass production. In contrast, smarter systems 
require understanding more about the system and the environment. In real time, 
this knowledge must be accumulated from sensors that provide more information 
to the computing portion of the system such as the health care systems mentioned 
earlier in this chapter. 
Figure 16.11  Smart sensor relative IQ (After: [35])

16.8  Application Example 
323
Figure 16.12 shows the continuum that exists as future sensors get smarter and 
controllers use more sensors. Microsystems need smart sensors. Systems, in gener­
al, will benefit from smart sensors. Starting at any point on the continuum and add­
ing an increasing amount of smarts to sensors or more sensor inputs to the digital 
controller, the system moves the operating point from one perspective to the other. 
With increased connectivity, any operating point will require the trust aspect and 
as identified in Figure 16.7. Trust must be an integral part of future smart sensors. 
16.8  Application Example
A forward-looking example demonstrates the exciting future for smart sensors and 
one of the driving forces for a trillion sensors. Hewlett-Packard (HP) engineers have 
developed a new class of low-power, digital MEMS accelerometers [37]. Using ex­
pertise gained from fluidic MEMS technology developed by HP, the accelerometers 
are up to 1,000 times more sensitive than currently available high-volume products. 
The devices are part of HP’s Central Nervous System for the Earth (CeNSE) infor­
mation ecosystem concept mentioned in Section 16.1. 
Figure 16.13 shows the cross section of the MEMS process. The process and de­
sign allow a large proof mass to obtain the high sensitivity [38]. The 5-mm-square, 
three-layer accelerometer can detect a 10-femtometer change in the position of its 
center chip and has a 130-dB dynamic range for a significant improvement in data 
quality [38, 39]. HP is working on the next generation of sensors that combine a 
three-axis inertial sensor and gyroscope in a single planar chip.

����������������������������������
The Next Phase of Sensing Systems 
The company envisions complete sensor networks conducting real-time data 
collection for a range of applications, including bridge and infrastructure health 
monitoring, geophysical mapping, mine exploration, and earthquake monitoring. 
While the sensing technology is still in the research and development phase, one 
major company has already bought into the vision [39]. HP and Shell are collabo­
rating to develop a wireless sensing system to acquire extremely high-resolution 
seismic data on land [40]. The goal is a vast improvement in the quality of seismic 
imaging, allowing Shell to more easily and cost-effectively explore difficult oil and 
gas reservoirs.
Tests conducted in the seismic testing vault at the U.S. Geological Survey’s 
(USGS) Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory facility in New Mexico have pro­
vided remarkable results [41]. Researchers established the sensor’s noise floor, the 
measure of the smallest detectable acceleration over a range of frequencies, at 10 
ng√Hz. This level is comparable to noise created by the earth’s ocean waves at the 
quietest locations on earth as defined by the Peterson low noise model. When an 
earthquake occurred in the Gulf of California during the testing period, a side-by-
side comparison of the new sensor with a USGS reference sensor showed similar re­
sults down to 25 mHz demonstrating the capability of the minute sensor to match 
an established instrumentation-grade sensor. A network of these sensors combined 
with data storage and analysis tools provides a unique sensing system solution. 
This kind of performance can take smart sensors to the next level and with a goal 
of distributing these sensors over massive land areas, the trillion sensors per year is 
not that far out of reach.
16.9  Summary
Smart sensors will mean more than the IEEE definition presented in Chapter 1. 
However, technology is not smart if it is not cost-effective. The exciting prospect of 
merged MEMS and microelectronics is a sensor that adds very little cost compared 
to the cost of all the other electronics required to make the sensor function as ex­
pected in the final system. This monolithic Level V sensor, as proposed in Chapter 
1, will use well-defined CMOS processing for all of the microelectronics and a 
CMOS-compatible MEMS process for the sensor(s). The sensor, in effect, becomes 
free. 
As the industry improves its ability to fabricate MEMS sensors, the area of 
the sensor relative to circuitry that makes the sensor’s output useful and smarter 
becomes a smaller and smaller portion of the overall chip, especially as other func­
tionality is added to the digital portion. Additional processing for the sensor will 
increase the overall cost. Viewed from the perspective of an IC manufacturer, the 
lion’s share of the cost is in everything except the sensor. For all intent, the sen­
sor is “free.” The cost increases, sometimes significantly, as the specifications are 
defined for a specific sensor. Performance, especially, accuracy, resolution, repeat­
ability and reliability directly affect qualification efforts, test time, and yield items 
that have a direct and significant impact on cost. Application-specific software also 
adds to the cost.
The cost is associated more with initial process, design, packaging, and of 
course, the testing of the sensing system. The cost of the digital portion will be

reduced as the semiconductor industry’s roadmap for improved capability is con­
tinually advanced. Achieving the desired specification will be where cost becomes a 
factor. A sensor used in a moderate (room temperature) environment with only 5% 
accuracy could have the same internal sensing chip as the rugged automotive ap­
plication that achieves 1% accuracy over a -40°C to 125°C ambient temperature. 
The cost of testing, on-chip calibrating, and packaging will make the latter more 
expensive.
While the smart adjective was frequently used in the late twentieth century to 
describe a “new and improved version,” the twenty-first century has brought a new 
meaning to smart. As shown in Table 16.3, smart continues to have a pervasive 
presence in technology products [1]. However, now smart is the new green. With 
this observation, Frost & Sullivan also note that sensors are moving from “smart” 
to “intelligent.”
One luminary, Aart de Geus, chairman and CEO of Synopsys Inc., envisions 
a future of “smart everything” culminating in smart apps that will deliver the ul­
timate product capabilities [20]. Recent and projected advances in semiconductor 
technology and design tools will enable tomorrow’s engineers to design, simulate, 
and verify something as complex as an entire vehicle system and probably to “vir­
tually” prototype the entire vehicle. To effectively utilize these tools, the design 
methodology and even the designer’s skill set must be modified to include MEMS 
technology in the systems approach. 
Standards will play a critical role for increased connectivity and in reducing 
costs for sensor manufacturers that can be passed on to systems manufacturers 
and, ultimately, to consumers. Achieving increased and trusted performance and 
functionality at costs that were once thought to be impossible will enable future 
smart sensors limited only by the imagination.
