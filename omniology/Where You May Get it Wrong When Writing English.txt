Introduction
INTRODUCTION
This book is based on my experience both as English language teacher and editor. I joined 
Sweden’s Jönköping International Business School in 2001. The milieu of the school is 
truly international. Many members of its faculty (more than 70%) come from abroad. Its 
student population is even more diverse. The school, which offers all its courses in English, 
attracts hundreds of foreign students every year, taking advantage of English as a medium 
of instruction, but more importantly, benefiting from the generosity of Sweden’s education 
system, which forbids collection of tuition fees from students whether Swedes or non-Swedes.1
As part of my English language teaching tasks at the school, I had to edit dissertations, 
scholarly papers, articles and reports and polish them from the language point of view. The 
corrections I made helped some of my colleagues at the university to get printed in some of 
the most prestigious scholarly journals and publications. But as I was editing and teaching, 
I found that many of the errors were recurrent in the scores of dissertations and hundreds 
of papers, articles and reports I was asked to have a look at. Then, I began collecting these 
errors and tabulating them. In the course of time, the corpus grew to thousands of examples, 
many of which I included in the handouts I gave to my students. Talking about errors in 
the class and how to identify and correct them is something students enjoy most. But one 
word of caution: teachers will have to present the errors to their students as anonymously 
as possible. As teachers, our job is not to embarrass our students. Our job is to encourage 
and motivate them.
The Purpose
This book is specifically written to improve the skill of writing in English. It is the product 
of almost a decade of teaching, editing and researching at the university. There is no shortage 
of books written in English and targeting English language learning errors. But I regret 
to say that most of the stuff I have seen is rarely based on authentic material and samples 
gathered over a long period of time. This book is corpus-based and is meant primarily 
to help readers write English properly, without errors if possible. It is designed both as a 
textbook and a publication that can be used by the majority of people as a guide on how 
to improve their English writing skills.

Introduction
Readers
I have a wide spectrum of readers in mind, ranging from high-school and university students, 
to teachers, academics and professionals. Exercises and tips on how to identify erroneous 
instances and pitfalls and ways to correct them make up the bulk of the book. There are 
special chapters on different writing tools and skills in English. There are special chapters 
on how to write, along with tips on how to link sentences and paragraphs together to 
produce an essay. University students and academics have special chapters on quoting and 
paraphrasing – the tools whose mastering is essential when writing.
The erroneous instances I discuss and analyze in the book are not selected haphazardly. 
They are among the most frequent samples which I have come across in my teaching and 
editing. Each of the book’s 15 chapters deals with one particular area which I have found 
to be problematic when writing English.
Grammar in Action
The book can be seen as “a grammar in action”. Grammatical concepts are simplified but 
not at the expense of accuracy. The book differs from mainstream English grammar and 
English language teaching publications in several aspects. First, it heavily relies on language 
usage rather than language theory. Second, it analyses and discusses authentic samples of 
language, i.e. the errors foreign English learners may make when writing English. Third, 
it provides plenty of exercises, all arranged and designed in a manner that differs from its 
traditional English language teaching counterparts. Fourth, readers are not left on their 
own to struggle with the exercises. Each example starts with an explanation and a sample 
of relevant error, which I hope they will try to solve on their own before moving to the 
correct versions.

Introduction
Another fundamental difference is the use of citations for the grammar points the book 
tackles. I have relied almost solely on mainstream British and American media outlets, 
such as The New York Times (NY Times), The Washington Post, Newsweek, TIME, The 
Economist, BusinessWeek, the Financial Times (FT), the BBC, The Wall Street Journal 
(WSJ), The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, the Los Angeles Times, Scientific American, 
The Independent, NPR (National Public Radio), and The Christian Science Monitor 
(Monitor). I am not aware of the degree of significance non-English language scholars give 
to mainstream media when compiling their lexicons and writing their grammar books in 
their own languages. But in English, we see the outlets mentioned above as the benchmark 
of proper English. How The New York Times, for instance, uses a word or constructs a 
sentence is one of the better ways to tell what is prevalent in current English. For this 
reason, English lexicographers and linguists cite profusely from these outlets when writing. 
Thanks
I owe a great deal to my colleague Lars-Olof Nilsson for the time he spent copy-editing the 
book. My thanks go to Carol-Ann Soames and her tips and suggestions. I am indebted to 
my undergraduate students who came to me praising my initial handout “One Hundred 
and One Errors,” and asking whether I could turn it into a book. I am glad that their 
dream has now come true.

Quoting and Paraphrasing – Introduction

QUOTING AND PARAPHRASING – 
INTRODUCTION
This chapter examines the notions of quoting and paraphrasing in English. The remarks 
here serve as a basis for the following two chapters, one on quoting and the other on 
paraphrasing. Most of the examples I use to demonstrate the different ways these two 
very important writing skills are cultivated in English are drawn from mainstream English 
publications, like The New York Times. I have made certain changes, particularly in the 
use of sources and reporting verbs, to make these examples of use to the wide spectrum of 
readers the book targets.
We use quoting and paraphrasing frequently whether in speech or writing. When we 
quote, we need to repeat exactly what someone else has said or written, usually with the 
acknowledgement of the source. When we paraphrase, we try to restate or express in a 
shorter or clearer way what someone has said or written, usually with the acknowledgement 
of the source. In other words, quoting involves direct repetition of what others have said 
or written while paraphrasing repeats what others have said and written but in different 
words. Paraphrasing, or expressing the ideas of others in your own words, is an important 
part of writing. It allows you to extract and summarize essential points, while at the same 
time making it clear from whom and where you have got the ideas you are discussing. 
It may be desirable to quote the author’s original exact words. If you do so, keep the 
quotations as brief as possible and only quote when you feel the author expresses an idea 
or opinion in such a way that it is impossible to improve upon it, or when you feel that 
it captures an idea in a particularly succinct and interesting way.
Also try to keep direct quotations at a minimum. Good authors paraphrase more than quote 
and if they are obliged to use direct quotations, they mainly do it in the following instances:
•	 when the wording of the original is particularly pertinent to an idea they are 
discussing and cannot be improved upon
•	 when they want to mention or accept authority to support their line of argument
•	 to avoid any ambiguity or misrepresentation of source material.

Quoting and Paraphrasing – Introduction
It is essential to acknowledge any material quoted directly or indirectly. Be careful to use 
borrowed material sparingly and selectively. The indiscriminate use of quotations is as bad 
as a lack of them. You will certainly not make a good impression by submitting work which 
is full of quotations.
TOOLS
In English, we have certain linguistic tools at our disposal to quote and paraphrase at ease. 
Here is a summary of these tools with examples from major U.S. and British media outlets, 
which you can easily apply when writing reports, articles, research papers or dissertations.
USE OF PUNCTUATION MARKS
Since our main concern is writing rather than speech, it may be useful to start by a short 
review of the punctuation marks we need when quoting or paraphrasing (see Chapter 7).
Any quotation needs punctuation marks (single or double inverted commas). These should 
enclose what is quoted. Other punctuation marks placed inside the quotation by the writer 
include commas, periods, question marks and exclamation marks. Note that the inverted 
commas indicating a quotation in English may be single or double, but always try to be 
consistent and follow the style sheet of your institution. The role punctuation marks play 
in quoting and paraphrasing is examined thoroughly in the next two chapters.
GRAMMAR POINT
English grammar books tackle quotation and paraphrasing under the heading of direct and 
indirect speech. The subject is broad and sometimes difficult to grasp when only seen from 
a linguistic point of view, but it has wide practical applications in speaking and writing. The 
following is a summary of the major points of grammar which you need to consider when 
quoting or paraphrasing. They are discussed in much greater detail with ample examples in 
the chapters dedicated to quoting and paraphrasing (see Chapters 4, 5, 11, and 12).
NOTES ON THE USE OF TENSE
◊	 The use of tenses (form of the verb) is important when quoting and paraphrasing. 
What form reporting verbs such as say, ask, argue, tell, add, etc., have in different 
situations is essential to credibility and meaning and the tenses of the text in general 
(see Chapter 2).
◊	 The reporting verb of a quotation may be in the present or past. This often but 
not always affects the tenses of the paraphrase (see 1.4–1.9).
◊	 Tense changes often occur when paraphrasing since the original spoken or written 
words are changed and the meaning is preserved. But remember you need to be 
consistent in the use of tense (see Chapter 8).

Quoting and Paraphrasing – Introduction
11
◊	 You can achieve continuity when paraphrasing through the use of linking phrases 
like: The author went on to say that, he continued that, he added that, etc. 
Such forms remind the reader that the text is a paraphrase. 
◊	 When paraphrasing you do not repeat the speaker or writer’s exact words. Paraphrasing 
usually takes place in the past, so the reporting verb is often in the past. As a 
result, the tenses of the reported clause are usually ‘moved back.’ This ‘moving 
back’ of tenses is called backshift in linguistics. A useful general rule is ‘present 
becomes past and past becomes past perfect.’ But past modals and the past perfect 
are unchanged, since no further backshift is possible (see Chapter 3).
◊	 You often need to change your pronouns when paraphrasing, depending on the 
meaning of the text and what the pronoun refers to (see Chapter 3).
◊	 You may need to make some necessary time and place changes when paraphrasing 
in relation to the changes in tense (see Chapter 3).
◊	 You also need to change your modal verbs from present to past. But you have 
to be careful because modals are not always easy to use in English. 
◊	 The rules about tense sequence (see Chapter 8) also apply to questions: X 
asked whether/if family-owned companies were happy with the presence of 
foreign investors.

Quoting and Paraphrasing – Introduction
◊	 You need to change the inversion of subject and reporting verb in quoted questions 
if you want to paraphrase them back to a statement word order (subject + verb): 
X wondered whether/if medium-sized firms relied on foreign labour.
◊	 Note that Do/Does/Did disappear when paraphrasing quoted Yes/No question: 
“Did the investors help in the provision of public utilities?” X asked whether 
the investors helped in furnishing the region with municipal services.
◊	 If and whether are interchangeable after reporting verbs like ask, want to know, 
wonder, etc., but whether conveys slightly greater doubt. Some verbs, like discuss, 
are followed by whether. Unlike that, if and whether (see 15.37) cannot be omitted 
after reporting verbs.
◊	 When paraphrasing, you also need to change the inversion of subject and reporting 
verb in quoted questions starting with where, why, what, who, when and how back 
to a statement word order (subject + verb): “Why have the multinationals invested 
so heavily in emerging markets?” X wanted to know why the multinationals 
had poured so much money into the emerging markets.
◊	 There is no inversion of subject and reporting verb when the question is about the 
subject: “Who invests in emerging markets?” X asked which firms invested in 
emerging markets. “Which firm makes these parts?” X asked which firm made 
these parts. 
General Prose and Academic Writing
1.4 In general prose (and to a lesser degree in academic writing), the prime verb in a sentence 
is often in the past tense. Newspapers generally tend to report past events. Consistency (see 
Chapter 8) in the sequence of verbs means that the governing verb in a sentence decides the 
tense of other verbs in the same sentence. When paraphrasing, the reporting verb functions 
as the prime verb if the attribution comes at the beginning of the sentence:
Warren E. Buffett said he planned no major changes to Berkshire’s management practices. 
(NY Times)
1.5 But it is acceptable in today’s English to have the governing verb in the present tense 
though the reference is the recent past:
Gary Kennedy, the director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in the 
Bronx, says psychological care is “equally if not more important than” medical care for 
this group. (NY Times)
Much existing literature on the aging population has been negative, he says. (NY Times)
And yet the medical dictum says that for incurable diseases, the only recourse is prevention. 
(NY Times)

Quoting and Paraphrasing – Introduction
1.6 In academic writing, the prime verb (when quoting or paraphrasing, see Chapters 2 and 
3) can be in the present tense though the reference is to works written in the past. But you 
have to be consistent in the sequence of your tenses. Do not vacillate between the present 
tense and past tense with your prime verbs when quoting and paraphrasing:
Damasio (1994: 256) wrote, “The effort to understand the mind in general biological 
terms has been retarded by several decades, and it is fair to say it has barely begun.”
Damasio (1994: 256) writes, “The effort to understand the mind in general biological 
terms has been retarded by several decades, and it is fair to say it has barely begun.” 
1.7 We can refer to things or events in the future even if the reporting verb is in the 
past tense:
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said he would switch to the Democratic party. 
(NY Times)
NOTE The tense in the paraphrase from The New York Times is in the past said and would, but 
it means that the senator will join the Democratic party after he made the statement.
1.8 Consistency (see Chapter 8) in tense sequence is not necessary when describing 
eternal truths:
He said the sun rises in the east and moves toward the west and there sets.
The scientist said the earth is round.
1.9 The governing or reporting verb controls the sequence of tense if the attribution comes 
at the beginning of your sentence (paraphrase). As we shall see, it is possible to move 
the reporting verb to the middle or the end of your sentence. In that case it can lose its 
governing or controlling function of tense sequence:
They also said that radiation levels would fall over the next two months with the 
disappearance of short-lived iodine 131. (NY Times)
Radiation levels will fall over the next months, they also said, with the disappearance of 
the of short-live iodine 131. (NY Times)

Courtesy Titles
1.10 Differences between general prose and academic prose surface at several levels in writing. 
One important level is quoting and paraphrasing. If you are writing a general report or an 
article for a newspaper, you do not need to pursue the tools that are necessary for academic 
essays and dissertations. I have tried my best in this book to point out, whenever necessary, 
where the two types of writing meet and where they diverge.
One area of divergence occurs when treating courtesy titles. In academic writing, we rarely 
use titles like Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms. with surnames. In general prose, they are a must in 
some media outlets like The New York Times, for instance. Courtesy titles as those mentioned 
above appear in several credible outlets in English for second and later references to people 
who do not bear specialized titles. In general prose, it is important to write the first name, 
middle initial (if any) and the surname on first reference; this is not required in academic 
writing where the surname is enough inside the text for both quoting and paraphrasing on 
first reference and later references:
At the annual gathering of Berkshire Hathaway’s investors here this weekend, Warren E. 
Buffett made it clear that, as far as he is concerned, it’s back to business as usual. But a 
former top manager for him, David L. Sokol, may make that a difficult goal to accomplish.

Quoting and Paraphrasing – Introduction
Mr. Buffett said at a news conference on Sunday that while he viewed the controversy 
caused by Mr. Sokol’s abrupt departure a month ago as sad, he saw little reason to dwell 
on the matter for very long. (NY Times)
1.11 Specialized titles like Dr, Prof., Gov. Lt. Gen., etc. are treated differently. These titles, 
which are normally deleted in academic writing, appear in first reference (specialized title 
+ first name + initial name – if available – + surname). In second and later references, use 
only the specialized title plus the surname: 
Prof. Richard Muller of Berkeley, a physicist who has gotten into the climate skeptic 
game, has been leading the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project… 
Instead, however, Professor Muller reported that his group’s preliminary results find a 
global warming trend “very similar to that reported by the prior groups.” (NY Times)
1.12 But note that on certain occasions, when the specialized title is as significant or 
sometimes even more important than the holder (the surname), the title may replace the 
surname in second and later references:
Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the most devastating attack on American soil in 
modern times and the most hunted man in the world, was killed in a firefight with United 
States forces in Pakistan, President Obama announced on Sunday night.
In a dramatic late-night appearance in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Obama 
declared that “justice has been done”.
“For over two decades, Bin Laden has been Al Qaeda’s leader and symbol,” the president 
said in a statement televised around the world. (NY Times)
1.13 There is no need to add titles to surnames of historic figures (Hitler, Lenin, Napoleon):
Remains of Lenin, father of Russian Revolution, still lie in state in mausoleum that 
dominates Red Square. (NY Times)

The use of that (conjunction) in Quoting and Paraphrasing
1.14 It is possible in today’s English to omit that after reporting verbs like say, disclose, 
announce, etc.
President Obama said he had decided to release his full birth certificate. (NY Times)
The president said he decided to release the long-form birth certificate two weeks ago. 
(NY Times)
1.5 But if the noun after any reporting verb can be the direct object of the same verb, I 
recommend that you retain that for the sake of clarity:
American companies disclosed that their information is increasingly disconnected from 
the desires of investors and the marketplace. (NY Times)
1.6 that is necessary when an adverb of time follows the reporting verb:
The Paris fashion house announced on Tuesday that Olivier Rousteing will succeed 
Christophe Decarnin. (NY Times)
NOTE The presence of that in the above sentence shows that the element of time applies to the 
part of the sentence after it.

QUOTING
Quoting is the presence of actual elements of other texts in the text you are writing. It is 
vital to demonstrate to your readers that the actual elements you have taken from others 
do not belong to you. Quoting, or including other people’s texts in your own, is a skill in 
English. Quoting sets boundaries between your voice as a writer and the voice or voices 
of others that you want to insert in your text. The quoted texts are marked differently in 
speech and writing. In speech, they are marked by intonation or vocal quotation marks. In 
writing, the area with which we are concerned, they are singled out by quotation marks. 
These marks, whether single or double inverted commas, tell the reader that you as a writer 
have preserved the original wording. You have made no change in the tense of verbs or 
words referring to time and place and demonstratives such as this and that.

Quoting
In English, there are some tools which you will need to use when quoting. These are called 
orthographic tools. They are symbols, or marks, meant to differentiate, or draw a boundary, 
between you as the writer and the actual texts you insert in your own writing. Here are the 
marks which you need to employ in English when quoting:
•	 Three dots… we use them to break up the quotation for the words that we choose 
to omit from the original text. In academic writing, the three dots are usually placed 
between square brackets.
•	 Double inverted commas “ ” the standard clues that nothing of the text included 
in them is yours.
•	 Single inverted commas ‘ ’ can also be used for quoting but can mean a number 
of things as we shall see. 
•	 Semi-circular brackets (	
) are used when writers insert their own changes or 
indicate the source. 
•	 Square brackets [	
] are sometimes used to enclose three dots or to indicate a 
different publication year. 
•	 The comma (,) is used to separate subject and reporting verb. 
•	 The colon (:) could also work as a comma in quoting. 
HOW TO QUOTE
To help you master the skill of quoting in English, let us assume that you want to use some 
actual elements or texts from the following source: 
“Taxpayers and the Auto-industry” by Danan Parana, Hampton Press, 2008
You have already highlighted the following two sentences from Parana’s book and would 
like to include them as they are in your text:
Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that taxpayers should only 
assist automakers executing a credible plan for long-term viability. We’ll continue to 
work with members on both sides of the aisle to achieve legislation that protects the 
good faith investment by taxpayers.
Apart from the tools mentioned above, you will need a source and a reporting verb for the 
quotation. The source, which in this case is Parana, grammatically has the function of a 
subject. It is not necessary for the source to be human. Non-human sources, such as names 
of radios, television networks, journals, etc., can also function as subjects in a quotation.

Quoting
The source or subject of your quotation needs a verb, but not any verb. Only reporting verbs 
are possible with the subject of your quotation. There are many reporting verbs that go with 
the subject (source) in English. It is necessary that you understand their meanings properly. 
Remember that these verbs are often attitudinal in nature. This means that they have different 
levels of emphasis. And remember that not all of them are suitable for quoting. Some are 
only suitable for paraphrasing (see Chapter 3). If in doubt, use the neutral ones like say, 
add, go on, continued, etc. Here is a list of the most frequent reporting verbs in English. 
We will return to their use in quoting and paraphrasing later: 
acknowledge
complain
encourage
pledge
remark
admit
conclude
ensure
predict
repeat
agree
condemn
estimate
presume
request
allege
confirm
forecast
promise
suggest

PRACTICAL GUIDE
Now let us move to the way quoting is done in English. The samples presented below 
will help you master the techniques of quoting in English, and at the same time show the 
differences and similarities between English and your native tongue. 
2.1 When quoting, we need a subject (source) and a reporting verb. The two may come 
at the beginning of the quotation where they must be separated either by a comma (,) or 
a colon (:). Remember, it is essential that you cite the page number from which you take 
the quoted material in academic writing:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that 
taxpayers should only assist automakers executing a credible plan for long-term viability.”

2.2 Subject and reporting verb may be placed at the end of the quotation. A comma separates 
the double inverted commas and the subject and reporting verb. In academic writing, you 
can do away with the reporting verb when the subject is placed at the end of your quotation:
“Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that taxpayers should 
only assist automakers executing a credible plan for long-term viability,” Parana 
(2008: 30) said. 
2.3 You can proceed with your text after the unquote marks. In this case, you do not need 
a comma to separate the double inverted commas:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Based on such measures, Sony is planning to reduce investment 
in the electronics business by approximately 30 percent” in the fiscal year ending 
March 2010.

2.4 You can add to the quote without closing it and then place the subject and reporting 
verb at the end of your sentence:
“Based on such measures, Sony is planning to reduce investment in the electronics 
business by approximately 30 percent ” in the fiscal year ending March 2010, Parana 
(2008: 30) said.
2.5 You can break up your quotation into two parts by placing subject and verb somewhere 
in the middle:
“Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that taxpayers should only 
assist automakers executing a credible plan for long-term viability,” Parana (2008: 30) 
said. “We’ll continue to work with members on both sides of the aisle to achieve legislation 
that protects the good faith investment by taxpayers.” 
2.6 Use three dots … to replace the words which you choose to omit and leave space at 
both ends. Another way is to enclose the three dots with parentheses or square brackets:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Long-term financing…should only assist automakers executing 
a credible plan for long-term viability.”
2.7 When the text you want to quote includes a quotation, place it inside the quotation 
between single inverted commas. If the inside quote ends the paragraph, close it with single 
inverted commas, leave space and then end with double inverted commas: 
That message can be a hard sell, Parana (2008: 30) acknowledges. “A lot of people are 
driven by wanting to have imaging,” he says. “They are miserable as hell, they can’t work, 
and they can’t sit. We look at you and say, ‘We think you have a herniated disk. We say 
the natural history is that you will get better. You should go through six to eight weeks 
of conservative management.’ ”
2.8 If you end the quotation which omitted parts add another dot to the three dots:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that 
taxpayers should only assist automakers….”

2.9 The reporting verb and subject can change position when placed at the end of the 
quotation, but remember you can do away with the reporting verb in academic writing in 
this case:
“Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that taxpayers should 
only assist automakers executing a credible plan for long-term viability,” said Parana 
(2008: 30). 
2.10 When you choose to omit words at the beginning of the sentence there is no need 
for the three dots, but make sure the quoted part fits the correct flow of syntax:
Parana (2008: 30) said it was necessary that “taxpayers should only assist automakers 
executing a credible plan for long-term viability.”
2.11 The reporting verb may be in the present or past. In academic writing the present 
is preferable:
Parana (2008:30) says, “Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that 
taxpayers should only assist automakers executing a credible plan for long-term viability.” 
2.12 If a quotation ends with a question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!) there is no 
need for a comma to separate the end quotes from the subject and reporting verb:
“Long-term financing must be conditioned on the principle that taxpayers should only 
assist automakers but who will eventually pay the money back?” Parana (2008: 30) said. 
2.13 You can use different reporting verbs, but always try to make sure that you have the 
right one. As explained earlier, most reporting verbs express the attitude of the writer and 
not the source you are quoting. Here are a few examples:
Parana (2008: 30) asks, “Would you trust assurances that there won’t be any more 
terrorist attacks on America?”
In another article Parana (2007: 30) writes, “Over recent months, Lady Thatcher has 
suffered a number of small strokes. That meant there would be no more public speeches.” 
Parana (2008: 30) told Russian auto-makers, “We are not going to be able to settle this 
as quickly as the Americans would like, because there are serious technical problems.”
“They are not too hard to make,” Parana (2008: 30) told a conference on the Manhattan 
Project at Los Alamos, N.M. “They will be universal if people wish to make them universal.”

2.14 Watch for the flow of your sentence if you try to break it up into two parts. Note 
the position of commas and the use of the lower or upper case with which the second part 
of the quotation starts:
“Since the birth of the nuclear age,” Parana (2008: 30) writes, “no nation has developed 
a nuclear weapon on its own, although many claim otherwise.” 
“It took only two weeks and three days for the Pakistanis to field and fire a nuclear device 
of their own,” Parana (2008: 30) notes. In another disclosure, Parana (2008: 50) says 
China “secretly extended the hospitality of the Lop Nur nuclear test site to the French.”
Parana (2008: 30) adds that, in the autumn of 1966, Israel conducted a special, non-
nuclear test “2,600 feet under the Negev desert.”

2.15	 Scare Quotes
These are the parts of text placed mainly between single inverted commas or italics. They 
are used to attract the reader’s attention to a particular word, term or phrase. Make sure 
the reader does not mistake them for quotations. Their effect is mainly to warn readers 
that these expressions are problematic in some way and that you as a writer do not want 
to be associated with them. Here, and as elsewhere, you will need to follow style book 
instructions which often advise writers on how to quote, how to scare quote and how to 
paraphrase. Thus, it is important that you do not confuse your scare quotes with partial 
quotes. Remember, partial quotes are sourced, while scare quotes are not, as the following 
examples show:
Parana (200: 30) described the negotiations with auto makers as “constructive and 
positive.” 
Parana (2008: 30) said the meetings with car industry executives were “frank and useful.” 
The ‘terrorists’ Western media talk about may be the freedom fighters of other nations. 
This ‘war on terror’ is totally unjustified.
NOTE Double quotation marks can also be used for scare quotes. The decision to use single or 
double inverted commas depends on the publication manual your institution adopts and 
the guidelines to authors, which may differ from one journal to another. For instance, 
The Washington Post uses quotation marks with words and phrases that are used in an 
ironic or opposite sense. The quotation marks in the following examples do not indicate 
direct speech or writing:
Freeman has also erected five “eco-cabins” based on designs by Frank Lloyd Wright. 
(Washington Post)
Almost three months after rebels expelled the forces of Moammar Kadafi, life goes on 
in “liberated” Libya with a state of mind that might be described as precarious elation. 
(Washington Post)
2.16 When quoting in academic writing always provide the author, year and the specific 
page of the citation. The reporting verb is not always necessary in academic writing:
“We can never say that that could never happen here,” said Parana (2003: 55).

“In the future, every time a developer decides to build in the city of Los Angeles, he will 
go to City Hall and solicit politicians’ help to get subsidies from the city, with support 
from many powerful parties who will benefit from the project,” (Parana 2003: 55).
2.17 If your quotation contains fewer than 40 words, when writing a scholarly paper or a 
dissertation, include it into the text and unquote with double inverted commas. If it comprises 
40 or more words, start your quotation on a new line and indent the whole paragraph. 
There is no need for quotation marks. Place the source and the page in parentheses after 
the period:
American nuclear facilities have backup power systems, and backups to those. All plants 
are required to have batteries to provide power in the event of a loss of power and 
failure of backup generators. In the United States, 93 of the 104 operating reactors have 
batteries capable of providing power for four hours; the other 11 have eight-hour batteries. 
Fukushima had eight-hour batteries. It wasn’t enough. (Parana 2008: 50–52)
2.18 If your attribution appears at the end of your sentence, unquote with quotation marks, 
provide the source and then end your sentence with a period:
“These sorts of big numbers can tell you which plants need to take steps first to fix general 
problems, or which plants might have wider margins if a problem were to occur,” Parana 
(2009: 60) said. 
NOTE In academic writing, the above quote may appear as follows:
“These sorts of big numbers can tell you which plants need to take steps first to fix general 
problems, or which plants might have wider margins if a problem were to occur” Parana 
(2009: 60).
2.19 Online material must be credited in the same way. In academic writing, you will need 
to provide the author, the year and the page number in brackets. If the electronic material 
has no page number, mention the number of the paragraph you are citing:
Parana (2002: paragraph 9) went on: “Regulators and federal courts have discounted the 
likelihood of multiple crises hitting a nuclear facility at the same time.”
NOTE In the reference list you will need to provide the link and the date you had retrieved 
the material.

2.20 If the pages are not visible in the electronic material, mention the paragraph as well 
as headings or subheadings:
“The commission has determined that the chance of such a bizarre concatenation of events 
occurring is extremely small,” (Parana 2002: Theoretical Framework, paragraph 10).
2.21 As mentioned earlier, you must follow the exact wording of your quotations in terms of 
spelling and punctuation. It may happen that the quotation contains errors or inaccuracies 
in grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. which you think might distract or confuse the 
reader. In that case, you will need to introduce the Latin word sic, which means thus or so, 
in italicized form and place it in parentheses. The word indicates that the error has been 
retained in its original form:
“These sorts of big numbers can tell you which plants need to take steps first to fix general 
problems, or which plants might has (sic) wider margins if a problem were to occur,” 
Parana (2011: 29).

2.22 But there is at least one exception to the rule in 2.21. You can change the first letter 
in your quotation to an uppercase or lowercase for the smooth and correct flow of your 
syntax. All other changes, such as introducing a word or a phrase to provide context for 
your readers, italicizing certain words for emphasis or omissions, quoting a book which is 
still in manuscript form or in press, etc., should be clearly indicated:
Parana (1999: 69) went so far as to suggest the need for “[t]he public to be even more 
afraid of radiation than the experts who work with it every day.”
“A fault line discovered in 2008, called the Shoreline Fault, runs about half a mile from 
the front door of Diablo Canyon,” (Parana 2009: 23, in press).
“Opponents want new seismic studies before the plant’s license is renewed,” (N. Parana, 
personal communication, June 23, 2010).
NOTE Since the material and the sources gathered through personal communication cannot be 
recovered by readers, there is no need to include them in the reference list. 
According to Parana (2001: 90), “This is about irreducible irrationality, if you like. We 
are irrational, every last one of us.” (Emphasis added)
NOTE (Emphasis added ), means you are the one who has italicized the word, and (Emphasis 
in original ) means italicization was there in the original text.
2.23 If citations are there in the original text, do not omit them:
“Dalana (2007), the director of both facilities, said that all plants are designed to withstand 
substantial earthquakes, but argued that none of them are actually considered to be in 
significant earthquake zones,” Parana (2011: 123) said. 
2.24 If you quote from work by two authors, cite both authors whenever quoting them. 
If you quote from a work by more than two authors, the general rule in academic writing 
is to cite all of them and the year when first referred to. In second reference, cite the first 
author followed by et al., a Latin abbreviation which means and others:
Parana and Dalana (2000: 45) write: “With 104 American reactors now running, that 
would mean such an event once every 1,000 years or so.”

Dalana, Halana, Parana and Warana (2001: 145) note: “The challenge that we confront 
is that external events obviously can occur that may be larger than you expected.” 
(first reference)
Dalana et al. (2001: 145) note, “Earthquakes are a challenge because the historical record 
is so short. The Richter scale is only 75 years old.” (second reference)
2.25 If you translate a conversation or a text into English, you will need to indicate that 
in your citation:
Parana (2005: 41) said, “There were serious arguments between the various sections about 
whether to go, how to use electrical lines, which facilities to use and so on.” (Author’s 
translation from German). 
2.26 In English, it is preferable to use single quotation marks in headlines, banks, subheadings, 
chart headings and caption overlines. This is how The New York Times and the BBC indicate 
direct speech or writing in their headlines:
Obama Calls World ‘Safer’ After Pakistan Raid (NY Times headline)
Rice crops ‘have single origin’ (BBC headline)
NOTE The structures between single inverted commas in the above headlines indicate a quotation 
because they are included within longer quotations lower down in the same articles. 
When the words or phrases in the inverted commas do not appear in quotations in the 
body of the article, they are treated as scare quotations (see 2.15 ). In this case, the use of 
quotation marks may not necessarily indicate direct quotation or speech in English. For 
instance, the BBC encloses certain words in its headlines with single inverted commas to 
show that the broadcaster has no independent confirmation of the information enclosed 
between them: 
Bahrain medics ‘promoted unrest’ (BBC headline)
Row over Gandhi ‘atrocity’ claims (BBC headline)

PARAPHRASING
When quoting, you set a boundary between your text and the text of another author or 
source. As we have seen, there are explicit orthographic tools to demarcate this boundary. 
Thus, there are two levels of writing, your own writing level and that of the source. You 
and the source do not speak at the same time because you employ tools that set the source’s 
actual elements quite apart from yours. In other words, you and the source you are using 
do not speak and think simultaneously.
In paraphrasing, this boundary blurs. You and the source you are using speak and think 
simultaneously. The source’s actual elements are no longer there. You only have your own 
writing level, as the words are yours but the ideas are not. Therefore, there are so many 
shifts, orthographic and otherwise, that must occur when paraphrasing.
There is no need to insert a quotation if the source’s grammar or theme is unsuitable, the 
subject hard to understand, and the topic not directly relevant to what you want to say. It 
is always a good idea to paraphrase awkward passages rather than carrying them verbatim 
in your text.

Paraphrasing
There are many differences that set quotations and paraphrases apart. In quoting, the writer 
erects an orthographic barrier in which the source’s actual elements are confined. No such 
barrier exists in the paraphrase of the same quotation. But the removal of boundaries 
(orthographic tools) is not enough for the writer and the source to speak on the same 
level. Major shifts, particularly in the use of some deictics, such as here, there, now, this, 
and those, need to be introduced in order to transform a source’s actual elements into a 
paraphrase. Other necessary shifts cover the use of pronouns as well as terms and expressions 
referring to time and place.
PRACTICAL GUIDE
The following is a practical guide on the necessary tips and tools you will need when 
paraphrasing in English. It is important that you master these tips and tools as well as those 
related to quoting, before you wade through the accompanying exercise:
3.1 As you read the following quotation and its paraphrase, note how this and those in the 
quotation are replaced by what they stand for when the quotation is paraphrased. Also note 
the removal of the orthographic tools (the doubled inverted commas) in the paraphrase. But 
what is most interesting is the way the source’s actual elements (quotation) are transformed 
into those of the writer, making both speak and think simultaneously. Paraphrasing is much 
more demanding than quoting, as the example below illustrates: 
“This city has honored this man here two days ago and I cannot understand the stand 
of those disapproving this occasion,” Parana (2008: 30) said. (Quotation)
Parana (2008), in remarks on the celebration honoring the former Prime Minister Halana 
Daman, said he could not understand that there were people who criticized the gathering 
held in Stockholm on December 23, 2007. (Paraphrase)
3.2 Observe the shift in the use of pronouns in the following quotation from I to he in 
the paraphrase. Also note how the source’s actual words in the quotation are transformed. 
The source’s actual elements are not there. What remains in the paraphrase is the gist of 
the source’s ideas:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “I am not going to negotiate with them on those terms.” 
(Quotation)
Parana (2008) said he was not ready to talk to the Russians if they insisted on the same 
conditions. (Paraphrase)

Paraphrasing
3.3 The paraphrases above show how the writer and the source speak in one voice. But 
remember that the transformation should be confined to turning the source’s actual words 
into your own. You must preserve the source’s ideas. You are free to transform the source’s 
actual elements in the quotation into whatever elements you deem necessary to express the 
gist of the source’s ideas. But certain shifts are obligatory, namely in the tense of the verb, 
in the use of pronouns and when the quotation contains words or phrases referring to time 
and place. Note the pronoun shifts that are obligatory when turning the quotation below 
into a paraphrase:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “I do not think I am pleased when I see others having a stake in my firm.”
Parana (2008) said he would not want to see foreign investors owning shares in his 
company.
3.4 You need to change the inversion of subject and verb in quoted questions if you want 
to paraphrase them back to a statement word order (subject + verb). Also note the shifts 
that take place in the tense of the verbs: 
Parana (2008: 30) asked, “Do medium-sized companies in England rely on expatriates?”
Parana (2008) wondered whether/if medium-sized firms in England depended on 
foreign labour.
3.5 Note that Do/Does/Did disappear when paraphrasing a quoted Yes/No question: 
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Did the investors help in the provision of public utilities.” 
Parana (2008) asked whether the investors had helped in furnishing the region with 
municipal services. 
3.6 If and whether are interchangeable after reporting verbs like ask, want to know, 
wonder, etc., but whether conveys slightly greater doubt: 
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Who will live there?”
Parana asked whether there was anyone willing to settle down in Somalia.
3.7 The use of that after reporting verbs say, add, note, etc., is optional. Also note the 
shift in the deictic this:
Parana (2008: 30) said, “This is not the author I recommended to you.”
Parana (2008) said Graham Fairclough was not the writer he had told his students to read.

3.8 When paraphrasing, you also need to change the inversion of subject and reporting 
verb in quoted questions starting with where, why, what, who, when and how back to a 
statement word order (subject + verb): 
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Why have the multinationals invested so heavily in emerging markets?”
Parana (2008) wanted to know why the multinationals poured so much money into the 
emerging markets.
3.9 There is no inversion of subject and reporting verb when the question is about the subject: 
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Who invests in emerging markets?” 
Parana (2008) asked which firms invested in emerging markets. 
Parana (2008: 30) said, “Which firm makes these parts?” 
Parana (2008) asked which firm made those parts.

3.10 You cannot use more than one source for one quotation unless the quoted statement has 
multiple authors. For instance, the multiple sourcing in the following quote is unacceptable: 
“We are unanimous that the economy is in the throes of harsh and tough recession and 
that bad times are ahead,” British analysts said. Q
3.11 But multiple sourcing is possible if you were quoting a book by several authors or a 
statement signed by these analysts:
“We are unanimous that the economy is in the throes of harsh and tough recession and 
that bad times are ahead,” British analysts said in a written statement. 
“We are unanimous that the economy is in the throes of harsh and tough recession and 
that bad times are ahead,” Parana and Darana (2008: 30) said. 
3.12 It is possible to have multiple sourcing when paraphrasing:
Most British analysts agree that the economy is suffering from recession and that the 
future does not look that promising.
Parana (2003) and Darana (2008) agree that the economy is suffering from recession 
and that the future does not look that promising.
3.13 You can use prepositions instead of reporting verbs for both quoting and paraphrasing: 
For Parana (2008: 30), “The car industry has lost its shine and it will take many years 
for it to recover.”
For Parana (2008), such talk just proves that U.S.’s leadership is intent on domination. 
3.14 Note that paraphrasing gives room to add context. If used properly, this will help 
you to shed more light on the context and bring the paraphrased material much closer to 
your own voice:
Parana (2008), director for adult education and literacy for Iowa, said that there had 
been strong interest in the on-demand program among disabled people, older adults and 
people who need flexibility as they look for work. 
3.15 It is important in paraphrasing to have consistency of the tense of the verb:
Parana (2008) said he was told that he would not be promoted because he did not 
graduate from high school.

A quotation of the above paraphrase could be:
“I am told I will not get a better position since I lack a degree,” Parana (2008: 30) said.
3.16 The following versions are also possible:
Parana (2008) says that while he was able to become good friends with courtroom 
opponents, Mr. Miller was the exception.
And while Parana (2008) previously succeeded in limiting consumers’ rights to sue financial 
institutions, he says he now favors offering that remedy in certain circumstances. 
3.17 As in quoting, the position of the source and the reporting verb varies:
One violation occurred over the portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir 
that is controlled by Pakistani forces, according to Parana’s (2008) account.
According to Parana’s (2008) account, one violation occurred over the portion of the 
disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir that is controlled by Pakistani forces. 
One violation occurred over the portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir 
that is controlled by Pakistani forces, Parana (2008) said. 
Parana (2008) said one violation occurred over the portion of the disputed Himalayan 
region of Kashmir that is controlled by Pakistani forces. 
3.18 Note that we do not separate the reporting verb from the rest of the paraphrase by a 
comma when the source and the reporting verb come at the beginning of the paraphrase. 
When they occur at the end of the paraphrase, the comma is necessary:
Parana (2008) said one violation occurred over the portion of the disputed Himalayan 
region of Kashmir that is controlled by Pakistani forces. 
One violation occurred over the portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir 
that is controlled by Pakistani forces, Parana (2008) said. 
3.19 As in quoting, the source and the reporting verb may break a sentence into two parts. 
Note how they are separated by two commas from the rest of the sentence:
A husband and wife, Parana (2008) said, were both fired the same day from 
Goldman Sachs. 
In a cascading financial crisis, Parana (2008) said, a pastor can discard a sermon prescribed 
by the liturgical calendar and directly address the anxiety in the air.

3.20 You can add to the paraphrased author relevant information in different ways. Note 
the following:
In an interview, Parana (2008) said that until the recent market turmoil, he did not fully 
appreciate how much risk Wall Street had assumed and how much damage its practices 
could inflict on ordinary Americans. 
In a book he wrote with Professor George A. Akerlof of the University of California, 
Berkeley, Parana (2008) argues that current circumstances call for a couple of 
intermediate targets.
3.21 It is possible to have one source and two reporting verbs in the same sentence when 
paraphrasing:
Parana (2008), a former S.E.C. commissioner, said the amendment he won was troubling, 
adding that it could block the S.E.C. from punishing a credit-rating agency that 
consistently issued unreliable ratings.

Parana (2008: 30), in the interview, acknowledged his full-speed-ahead approach. “Any 
job I do, I work hard at and I try to succeed at,” he said.
In the preface, Parana (2008: 30) gives a searing critique of what he calls the “blinkered 
and disjointed pre-war planning for Iraq’s reconstruction” and the botched expansion 
of the program from a modest initiative to improve Iraqi services to a multibillion-
dollar enterprise. 
3.23 You can use a variety of reporting verbs when paraphrasing. But remember, the choice 
of the appropriate reporting verb is important. Reporting verbs express your attitude as 
an author. This attitude should reflect that of the source as far as possible. Here are a 
few examples:
Parana (2008) denies putting any pressure on the banks to demand extra guarantees for 
the loan.
Parana (2008) alleges that senior executives told their employees to destroy thousands of 
documents within days of notice.
City analysts (2008) predicted the shares would suffer further unless Marconi rapidly 
sorted out its finances.
Parana (2008) demands the return of foreign investors to the region and has hinted that 
the town hall might issue new regulations to make that possible.
Parana (2008) questioned the validity of the Monterey agreement.

IMPORTANT NOTE
The symbol () is used in English for “incorrect,” but some European languages use it for 
“correct.” The symbol () is used in English for “correct,” but in some European languages it 
is used opposite the English way, i.e. for “incorrect.” Readers are also asked to note that the 
presence of the symbol () in this book does not always mean that the sample is grammatically 
wrong. () might mean that the version is in need of rewriting. Similarly, the symbol () may 
be taken to mean that the version, according to the author, is the most suitable and reasonable. 
Some of the corrections are what the author sees as better versions, suggestions or rewrites.
3.24 The writer of the following paragraph fails to set orthographic boundaries between 
the two voices in the quotation from the CEO:
The CEO explains: “You check that from time to time, you know. And then you say 
“wow, they have purchased a new machine.” That’s what I do not want to happen.” 
The CEO explains: “You check that from time to time, you know. And then you say, 
‘wow, they have purchased a new machine.’ That’s what I do not want to happen.’ ” R
3.25 There are three problems with the following quotation. First, the verbs engage and 
understand do not agree with their subject (see Chapter 4). Second, we have the date of 
the publication of the source’s work and the page number in two different places. Third, 
we are not sure whether “proactive” as a scare quote (see 2.15) belongs to the source or 
the writer:
Miller (1983) thinks of an entrepreneurial firm as one that “engage in product-market 
innovation, undertake somewhat risky ventures, and are first to come up with “proactive” 
innovations, beating competitors to the punch” (p. 771). Q
For Miller (1983: 771), entrepreneurial firms “engage in product-market innovation, 
undertake somewhat risky ventures, and are first to come up with “proactive” innovations, 
beating competitors to the punch”. (Emphasis in the original) R
NOTE In academic writing, you will need to say whether placing “proactive” between double 
inverted commas and italicizing first were there in the original text or they are of your 
own making.

3.26 This is a sentence which is indeed very hard to read. Part of the ambiguity is due to 
the wrong use of quotation marks. First, we are not sure whether the structures between 
double inverted commas are used for attribution, because at the end of the sentence the 
writer cites several authors. Second, note the confusion which unhealthy organizations 
causes where, besides the round brackets, the writer adds double inverted commas. Third, 
it is recommended that you separate the dependent clause with a complex sentence marker 
from the independent clause by a comma (see 7.4). Fourth, the sentence is too long (58 
words). In short, the sentence needs rephrasing:
Hence, when organizations are “healthy” i.e. work enables meaning, structure, identity, 
self-respect of employees as well as material awards (Watson, 1995) the working situation 
and the workplace are “spices of life” rather than “kisses of death” (“unhealthy 
organizations”) for individuals and organizations that also organizations may also 
become “financially healthy” (see Lennart, 2002: Mchugh & Brotherton, 2000; Randel, 
1998). Q

Hence, when organizations are healthy – work enables meaning, structure, identity, self-
respect of employees as well as material awards (Watson, 1995) – the working situation 
and the workplace become spices of life rather than kisses of death for individuals and 
organizations. This renders them financially viable. (See Lennart, 2002; Mchugh & 
Brotherton, 2000; Randel, 1998). (Emphasis in the original) R
3.27 Do we have one author for the same work or two? If both authors have written the 
same work, we should use and. If each is the writer of a separate work, then we need to 
mention the year for the first, too:
Learning or knowledge gathering is based on cultural factors within a organization (Popper, 
Lipsichtiz, 1998). Q
Learning or knowledge gathering is based on cultural factors within an organization 
(Popper and Lipsichtiz, 1998). R
3.28 If you have the names of the authors, you do not need to say by the authors and 
there is no need for i.e.:
It is doubtful if it can be used to the full as discussed by the authors, i.e. Lave & Wenger (1991). Q
Lave and Wenger (1991) doubt whether it can be used to the full. R
3.29 There is no need for the first mention of Miller and O’Leary, 1987 since we have 
them at the bottom, which is the right thing. We usually separate quotations from the rest 
of the text and indent them when they are three lines or more (approx. 40 words or more). 
Finally, there is usually no need for the inverted commas when a quotation is separated from 
the rest of the text as the indentation and the white spaces before and after the quotation 
set the necessary orthographic boundary between your voice and the source’s voice:
Standards became common in the scientific management school and the Taylorism and 
were often related to time and working studies (Miller and O’Leary, 1987). 
“Cost accounting could now embrace also the individual person and make them 
accountable by reference to prescribed standards of performance”

often related to time and working studies. “Cost accounting could now embrace also the 
individual person and make them accountable by reference to prescribed standards of 
performance.” (Miller and O’Leary, 1987, p. 241) R
3.30 A similar problem arises in the following sample but this time with the first mention of 
the author, and particularly with Motivational purpose is summarized by Drury (1997). 
Note that it is important for the quotation, when separated in this way, to read from the 
point of view of syntax as if it were part of the structure preceding it. Get rid of the passive 
construction is summarized by Drury and the slash planning/simplifying: 
The purposes of standards are divided into two groups, the motivational and the 
planning/simplifying purpose. Motivational purpose is summarized by Drury (1997):
	
“If people know in advance that their performance is going to be judged, they are 
likely to act differently from the way they would done if they were aware that their 
performance was not going to be measured.” 
(Drury, 1977, p 545) Q
Standards are of two purposes, the motivational and the planning. Drury (1997, p. 545) 
writes: 
	
If people know in advance that their performance is going to be judged, they are 
likely to act differently from the way they would if they were aware that their 
performance was not going to be measured. þ
3.31 Two things are wrong with the following sentence. The first relates to the quotation 
which starts with a capital letter. You only start your quotation with a capital letter if it 
grammatically can stand by itself, independent from the rest of the sentence. Here it cannot. 
It is grammatically part of what precedes it. For the smooth flow of the text, you will need 
to replace the uppercase A with a lowercase placed between square brackets [a]. This will tell 
the reader that you, as the author, have reduced the original A to a for the sake of reading. 
Moreover, the source and the date of the publication of the source’s work are missing:
The term feature used in conjunction with feature models has “A prominent or distinctive 
and user-visible aspect, quality, or characteristic of a software system or systems.” Q
The term feature used in conjunction with feature models has “[a] prominent or distinctive

3.33 Separate your quotation by a (,), or colon (:), and place it immediately after the 
reporting verb when you have your subject and the reporting verb at the beginning of your 
sentence. But please note that you do not need to separate your paraphrase with a comma 
or any other punctuation symbol when you have your subject and reporting verb at the 
beginning of the paraphrase. Also you will need to mention the date of the publication of 
Bachman’s work and the page number from which you got the citation:
Bachman suggests “Trust works on the basis of positive assumptions…” Q
Bachman (1998: 145) says, “Trust works on the basis of positive assumptions…” R
3.34 Page numbers are usually separated from years by a colon (:). But remember the 
choice of these writing tips often depends on the instructions publishers and institutions 
have for authors: 
Gietzman (1996, 613) states “Traditional management accounting practices do not 
provide managers with necessary information to assess whether…” Q
Gietzman (1996: 613) says, “Traditional management accounting practices do not 
provide managers with necessary information to assess whether…” R
3.35 It is not logical to use multiple sourcing for the same quotation. It is very rare for 
two people to say exactly the same thing:
However, this was not met with enthusiasm. “We were pretty thorough when things were 
rough…” they said. Q
3.36 Remember, a quotation starts with double inverted commas and ends with double 
inverted commas:
This will help it to cut costs and focus on its strengths,” said the UBS. Q
“This will help it to cut costs and focus on its strengths,” said the UBS. R
3.37 We usually start a quotation with a capital letter unless it is part of the preceding 
clause or phrase. We separate the reporting verb “say” by a (,) or a colon (:):
Mats Lagerqvist thinks that Banco complements Swedbank, and says “we can also make 
our offers even wider when it comes to keeping the investments, with the help of Banco”. Q

3.38 You will need a reporting verb before the subject (the source) Irene Krohn, Telia. 
Also note the wrong use of (-):

generally”-Irene Krohn, Telia. Q
“We’ll look at each case and take an independent decision, but we will not compensate 
generally,” said Irene Krohn, Telia. R
3.39 It is good to provide context to our quotations, but you will need to do it properly from 
the language viewpoint. Here, there is a problem with the part introducing the quotation:
When asked about whether it is important that a subcontractor is well known in the 
market for the company to choose it the CEO is reluctant to agree. “Reputation is 
not enough. Other factors must be taken into account.” Q
Asked whether the company thought it was important for a subcontractor to be well 
known in the market, the CEO reluctantly said, “Reputation is not enough. Other 
factors must be taken into account.” R
3.40 The confusion in the following is mainly due to the presence of the passive construction. 
Try to turn the passive into active and bring the subject the CEO to the beginning of 
the sentence:
Customers need a more holistic view of the company and, which is suggested by the 
CEO, “get a feeling for” the supplier. Q
Customers need a more holistic view of the company, and the CEO suggests that they 
“get a feeling for” the supplier. R
3.41 Do not separate titles from sources. Do not forget to open and end quotations with 
double inverted commas. There is also a problem with the phrase oilprices.

New York. Q

3.42 Do not forget to separate your source (subject) and reporting verb from your quotation

Subject and Verb Agreement
4	
SUBJECT AND VERB AGREEMENT
Subjects in English have certain features in common with verbs. This relationship is usually 
referred to in English grammar as concord or agreement. And the most important agreement 
between grammatical units in English occurs between singular subjects and singular verbs, 
and plural subjects and plural verbs. This type of concord, which is a source of trouble 
for many learners of English, occurs when the verb is in the present tense. The following 
examples show grammatical concord, i.e., the verbs formally agree with the number (singular 
or plural) of their subjects: 
Irish budget airline Ryanair reports an increase in annual profit of 23%. (BBC)
Asian leaders agree nuclear pact. (BBC headline)
The leaders have met on an informal basis for a decade. (BBC)
Thailand has been trying to boost growth after civil unrest last year. (BBC)
The election is expected to be closely fought. (BBC)
New promises are being made in election campaign literature. (BBC)
The final votes were being counted. (BBC)
The eruption was on a different scale to the one in Iceland last year. (BBC)
But in today’s English, the rules determining grammatical concord are not enough. Learners 
must be made aware that we have other types of concord, namely notional concord and 
concord of proximity. In notional concord the verb agrees with the singular or plural meaning 
of the subject and not its form. In concord of proximity, the verb agrees with the singular 
or plural noun that is nearest to it. Note the following examples:
The government describes them as independent, state-funded schools. (BBC)
The US government have deemed the BBC worthy recipients of the money due to their 
ability to reach a broad base across the globe. (NewStatesman)
The family have got a new song to reveal their Christmas wishes. (BBC)
His family have been informed. (BBC)
Family Works to Prove Its Ties to Jefferson (NY Times headline)
The Assad family has ruled Syria for 40 years. (AP)
In the following, the verb agrees with the number (singular or plural) of the nearby noun:
Hunger strikes harm no one except the person who denies food to themselves.
Hunger strikes harm no one except the persons who deny food to themselves.

Subject and Verb Agreement
One major source of difficulty for learners of English regarding subject and verb agreement 
is the tendency to apply the rule of concord or proximity to the nearby noun instead of 
the head noun in a complex noun phrase. Many of these errors occur when the verb in 
the sentences they write is far removed from its subject and one or several other nouns 
intervene. In dealing with sentences like these, learners usually fail to identify the subject 
or the main noun. Note the following examples:
Workers at Honda plants take 14 days off. 
A worker at Honda plants takes 14 days off.
The exercises in this book include several tips on how to avoid these errors. This chapter 
specifically deals with erroneous samples containing such errors. 
EXERCISE
Here are some examples of the most frequent subject and verb agreement errors English 
language learners may make when writing English along with the necessary tips on how 
to correct them:
4.1 One important tip is that the verb agrees with the head noun of the main noun phrase. 
In the following example, the head noun is use and not properties:
The use of properties are important. Q
The use of properties is important. R
4.2 Two successive names coordinated by and are treated like a plural noun, i.e. they agree 
with a plural verb. The sentence below is a bit hard to read mainly because it starts with what. 
It is not wrong to use what for non-question sentences provided they are short and clear:
What Lave and Wenger points out to be important when building a CoP is that learning 
should be situated and contextual. Q
Lave and Wenger (year of publication of the book or journal is necessary in academic 
writing) point out that it is important to situate and contextualize learning when building 
a CoP. R

4.3 Here is a sentence which is too long. At the same time it has an error in agreement. For 
better reading, I first advise that you divide the sentence into two parts and then correct 
the error related to subject and verb agreement:
As the delimitations for the change and the specifications of goals influences the 
possibilities for results and ergonomic improvements in different ways there is a need to 
discuss the underlying assumptions for the change effort with arrangement involved. Q
Change delimitations and goal specifications influence the possibilities of improving 
ergonomic results. Thus, there is a need to discuss the underlying assumptions for 
change. R
4.4 Here is another example of lack of agreement. Remember the verb agrees with the head 
of the noun phrase; in this case picture. For better reading, try to bring the agent Eakin 
to the beginning of the sentence. The shift in the position of the agent solves the problem 
and makes reading easier:
A striking picture of the main components in these attitudes were described by Eakin (1992). Q
A striking picture of the main components in these attitudes was described by Eakin 
(1992). R
Eakin (1992) gives a striking picture of the main components in these attitudes. R
4.5 Always remember that the verb agrees with the main noun or the head of the noun 
phrase, which is factors in the following sentence:
The factors in the equation offers no proof. Q
The factors in the equation offer no proof. R
4.6 It is sometimes difficult to tell which is the head noun when the noun phrase is very 
long. In the following sentence, the noun phrase, written in bold, is 11 words with three 
nouns of which chapters is the head:
These chapters which are concluded in a number of research questions represents the 
framework for the thesis. Q
These chapters, concluded in a number of research questions, represent the framework

4.7 Identifying the head of a noun phrase is very important to address pitfalls in subject-
verb agreement in English. One main clue is that the noun immediately preceding the 
preposition in a complex noun phrase is usually the head noun. parts in the noun phrase 
written in bold is the head noun and immediately precedes the preposition of:
In this chapter the brand concept and parts of its history is presented. Q
In this chapter the brand concept and parts of its history are presented. R
4.8 The following sentence is hard to read, partly because of the way that and what are 
used. Also, note that the sentence has two errors in agreement between subject and verb:
The following quote suggest a very basic logic for understanding marketing communications 
towards industrial customers that does not proclaim limits for what tools are useful. Q
The following quote suggests a basic logic for the understanding of marketing 
communication with industrial customers that sets no limit for the tools they see as 
useful. R

4.9 A relative clause modifies the head noun it follows (see 12.7). The head noun agrees 
with the verb in the modifying relative clause. One way to solve the problem is to have 
a reduced relative clause, one in which the relative pronoun has been omitted, modifying 
the head noun:

4.12 In the following, the head noun is strength:
The strength of these dependencies diminish with distance. Q

Subject and Verb Agreement
4.15 One common error in agreement of subject and verb is related to names of countries. 
You will need to remember that names of countries are singular in English and agree with 
a singular verb. Names of organizations in English are mostly treated like singular nouns:
The European Union are to blame. Q
The European Union is to blame. R
The United States have no intention to stay in Iraq. Q
The United States has no intention to stay in Iraq. R
4.16 The pronouns referring to names of organizations have to be singular, too:
OPEC has promised that they will increase their production. Q
OPEC has promised that it will increase its production. R
4.17 But this particular rule may have exceptions, namely with company names. Company 
names are singular but notionally are sometimes treated as plural, particularly in business 
English. This is the case, for instance, with the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, 
where names of companies occasionally get a plural verb or a plural pronoun. Here are a 
few examples from mainstream English publications:
Volvo have had a bit of a problem in the past with image. (BBC)
Why can’t Microsoft and their ‘partners’ compete with iTunes? (WSJ)
Microsoft are doing exactly the right thing. (FT)
Microsoft and their own startup businesses. (NY Times)
If you trust Microsoft and their partners not to slip a trojan horse spyware application 
onto your computer, there’s no guarantee that a less trustworthy company won’t do that 
or worse. (WSJ)
Microsoft and their ilk have their way. (FT)
4.18 The following is a sample taken from an English text written in Sweden. Ford, as 
a name of a company, agrees with a plural verb while Volvo, which is also a name of a 
company, is treated as singular since it is referred to by the singular pronoun its. Always 
try to be consistent. Besides, the use of the present continuous tense are demanding is 
inappropriate (see Chapter 10).
Ford are demanding Volvo to make some change in its cost structure to achieve better 
economy. Q

Ford demand that Volvo make some change in their cost structure to achieve better 
economy. R
Ford demands that Volvo make some change in its cost structure to achieve better 
economy. R
4.19 The gerund (-ing) at the beginning of a sentence is treated like the main or head noun 
of the noun phrase in subject-verb agreement. Note that it is always singular and agrees with 
a singular form of the verb. In the following sentence, the nouns knowledge, flows and 
localities are part of the bolded complex noun phrase following the main word introducing:
Introducing potential knowledge and information flows be­tween dif­ferent localities 
imply that there might be substantial spatial dependence between localities. Q
Introducing potential knowledge and information flows be­tween dif­ferent localities 
implies that there might be substantial spatial dependence between them. R
4.20 Some learners invert the subject and verb after adverbs of time, place or manner when 
writing or speaking English. This may be due to direct interference from their mother tongue:
Therefore has US started preparing their troops for an attack. Q
Therefore the US has started preparing its troops for an attack. R

Subject and Verb Agreement
4.21 We have inversion of subject and verb in English but it only occurs after certain words 
and expressions. The following are examples drawn from mainstream English publications, 
demonstrating some of the words and expressions which require subject and verb inversion 
in English when they occupy the initial position in a sentence:
Nowhere will the tributes be more exuberant than Warsaw for he was born close to the 
city and gave his first recital there just before his eighth birthday. (The Times)
Little do you realise they will shortly engage the entire family in a power struggle for the 
soul of your business and your very health. (BBC)
Seldom have so many stars, major playwrights, good directors been scheduled on-and-
off-Broadway. (LA Times)
Not once did I say to myself ‘I can’t go on.’ I used to say ‘I’m tired,’ but you’d have 
people running with us at different points around the world, and they would talk to us 
and give us a lift. (BBC) 
“Never did I imagine I would be doing something like this,” says the 27-year-old luk 
thung (country music) singer. (TIME)
No longer do players and not-so-perfect strangers point a finger at Moe Drabowsky (right) 
of the Baltimore Orioles and say, “There he is. There’s the guy who gave up Stan Musial’s 
3,000th hit, the guy who was the losing pitcher when Early Wynn finally got his 300th 
victory, the guy who was born to be a loser.” (Sports Illustrated/CNN)
Not since Buckingham Palace took so long to respond to Princess Diana’s death in 1997 
has an organisation so badly misjudged the mood of the public. (BBC)
Nowhere will you find a more succulent piece of meat. (CNN)
Little did Stewart Cink know how much it meant. (Sports Illustrated/CNN)

The Possessive
5	
THE POSSESSIVE
The possessive or genitive is marked in writing in English by adding an (s) and an apostrophe 
(’). It takes two forms in English: boy’s, boys’. Learners sometimes fail to use the right 
possessive form, confuse between the two forms and occasionally replace the apostrophe 
with other punctuation marks (see below). Let us first go over a few tips on how it is used 
in English, relying on examples from mainstream British and American publications, and 
then discuss the errors you may make when using the possessive in English:
5.1 The possessive form in English is used with nouns, representing people, animals or things:
US President Barack Obama’s Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, arrived in the region 
on Monday. (BBC)
Japan’s Nikkei index shed 3.1%. (BBC)
The world’s biggest bond investor… (BBC)
The country’s central bank said it would inject more than $20bn (£13bn) in short-term 
loans to commercial banks to boost liquidity. (BBC)
He said another five people had been rescued from the building’s balcony. (BBC)
He moved the newspaper’s operations to a new skyscraper on 42nd Street at Longacre 
Square. (NY Times)
5.2 The possessive form (’s) is placed after names of people ending in an (s).
Prince Charles’s wife emerges from Diana’s shadow. (Reuters)
If you missed James’s show on BBC Two last night, then catch it here on the BBC 
iPlayer. (BBC)
5.3 It is possible to add only an apostrophe or an apostrophe and an (s) to the possessive 
form of singular nouns representing things and ending in an (s):
N.Y. Times’ Dowd Admits Lifting Blogger’s Words (AP headline)
The New York Times’s Green Inc. Has a New Name and Mission (NY Times headline)
5.4 Plural nouns get only the apostrophe:
GATT seeks to tie all the dogs’ tails together. (Scientific American)
During the Members’ Forum Period you may also present any questions. (FT)
What happened to the readers’ comment forum? (Washington Post)

5.5 Acronyms and abbreviations are treated like singular nouns.
A weak government might not be able to implement policies quickly to reduce the UK’s 
high budget deficit. (BBC)
Congress Takes Aim at Wall St.’s Wild Trading (NY Times headline)
OPEC’s producers have since stuck to a rigorous playbook. (NY Times)
US’s Geithner is to discuss Greece with G7 colleagues. (Reuters)
Companies fail UN’s Global Compact. (FT)
The BBC’s Jonny Dymond in Brussels says… (BBC)
5.6 In the case of joint ownership it is preferable to give the possessive form to the final 
name only:
Kym and Jack’s wedding day in pix (BBC headline)
The series finale features the return of Captain John and Jack’s brother Gray. (BBC)
The weapons threat was key to Blair and Bush’s case for war. (BBC)

57
The Possessive
NOTE The rule in 5.6 might have exceptions. When two nouns are in joint ownership, it is 
possible for both to have the possessive form:
The fact that Blair’s and Bush’s governments face parallel but separate inquiries from 
their own legislatures operates, in some ways… (Time)
5.7 Add (’s) to plural nouns not ending in (s):
Classic editions of children’s folk tales… (NY Times)
Geno Auriemma laments the lack of attention women’s basketball receives. (NY Times)
5.8 In case of inanimate nouns which are plural in form but singular in meaning (i.e. 
physics, mathematics, measles, news, shingles, diabetes, acoustics, species, crosswords, General 
Motors, the United States), you may add an apostrophe if you follow the manual of style 
and usage of major U.S. publications, particularly The Associated Press. If you follow the 
BBC, the standard bearer of British English (BrE), and even The New York Times, the 
standard bearer of American English (AmE), there is no need for the apostrophe:
We do not have mathematics difficulties. (BBC)
Using an applying mathematics website (BBC)
The number of measles cases continues to rise. (BBC)
United States wealth has plunged 12 percent since 2007. (NY Times)
General Motors profits decrease during 12 months (NY Times)
NOTE You may come across the words mathematics, measles, United States and General 
Motors in the above sentence written with an apostrophe in AmE (mathematics’ rules, 
measles’ cases, United States’ wealth and General Motors’ profits).
NOTE When writing English try to avoid the personalization of inanimate objects. Therefore, 
using the possessive excessively with inanimate objects is not recommended in English. 
Try to give preference to the of construction in cases involving inanimate nouns. For 
example, write rules of mathematics instead of mathematics rules and cases of 
measles instead of measles cases.

The Possessive
5.9 The (s) and the apostrophe are not the only markers to express the possessive (genitive 
case) in English. There is a close similarity between the meaning of a noun in the possessive 
form and the same noun in which the possession is expressed by of construction (the of-
genitive). The choice between them, grammarians say, is mostly an issue of gender and 
style. However, there are a few rules. The (s) and the apostrophe are normally reserved 
for personal nouns, higher animals and geographical names. The of construction is mainly 
reserved for inanimate nouns:
Teacher’s Notes are available to support most programmes. (BBC)
Book’s notes are available to support most programmes. Q
Notes of the book are available to support most programmes. Q
Notes from the book are available to support most programmes. R
Book notes are available to support most programmes. R
EXERCISE
Here are a few samples of the pitfalls you may fall into when using the posessive form 
in English:
5.10 In the following, there is a difference between founder’s and founders’. The difference 
is simple but affects meaning a great deal. Is the writer talking about the families of one 
founder or more than one founder? Try to be extra cautious with the singular and plural 
forms of nouns indicating ownership. Replacing founders’ with a possessive pronoun and 
using the plural form founders solves the ambiguity. In fact founder’s is wrong because 
there is no indication of possession or ownership there:
A large fraction of the world’s publicly traded firms are controlled by their founder’s or 
members of the founders’ families. Q
A large fraction of the world’s publicly traded firms are controlled by their founders or 
members of their families. R
5.11 The possessive form is not the only construction in English indicating ownership. 
The of construction is one of them. Another is the possessive form of English pronouns (see 
Chapter 11). There is nothing wrong with the following from the grammar viewpoint, but the 
sentence will read much better through the use of the of construction or a possessive pronoun:
Chapter 13 concludes the thesis by summarizing and discussing the thesis’ main 
contributions. Q
Chapter 13 concludes and summarizes the main contributions of the thesis. R
Chapter 13 concludes the thesis, summarizing its main contributions. R

The Possessive

5.12 Here is another instance where there is no need for the apostrophe since ownership 
is already indicated by the use of the of construction, which is one of the main indicators 
of possession in English. In the absence of the of construction, the need for the possessive 
form would arise, i.e., culture’s transmitters and authors:
A central point of departure for a cultural historical analysis of leadership is to see leaders 
more as transmitters’ than authors’ of culture. Q
A central point of departure for a cultural and historical analysis of leadership is to see 
leaders more as transmitters than authors of culture. R
5.13 Uncertainty and confusion in the use of the possessive form prompts the writer to 
add an apostrophe where it is not necessary:
Consumers would like the mutual funds’ they invest in to maximize risk-adjusted expected 
returns. Q
Consumers would like the mutual funds they invest in to maximize risk-adjusted expected 
returns. R

The Possessive
5.14 In the following, shareholder’s has to be in the plural form but the writer uses the 
singular with the possessive form. I attribute the confusion to lack of proper knowledge on 
the use of the possessive form in English:
The deal caused a negative effect on the plan of controlling shareholder’s votes. Q
The deal had a negative effect on the plan of controlling shareholders’ votes. R
5.15 The use of the colon (:) or the hyphen (-) to replace the apostrophe is a classic example 
of errors many European learners make when writing English, particularly with abbreviations:
The UN:s Secretary General… Q
UN’s Secretary General…or simply UN Secretary General R

ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS
INTRODUCTION
In newspaper, online or academic writing, the writer bears the responsibility of bridging 
the language gap. The writer, not the reader, is the one who is under obligation to make 
terms familiar. 
Abbreviations and acronyms are among the terms that require clarification, and defining 
them needs some effort on the part of the writer. 
Abbreviations and acronyms are very common in professional writing. It is wrong to assume 
that the reader has the ability to unravel these terms even if they are clearly spelled out. 
WHAT ARE THEY? 
The term abbreviation refers to forms which are usually formed by taking the initial letters 
of a phrase or name, such as IBM, for International Business Machines or BBC for British 
Broadcasting Corporation. They are read letter by letter.
The term acronym denotes a word formed from the first letters of the words that make up 
the name of something. It is only used to refer to shortened structures that are read out 
as single words. But unlike abbreviations, they are read as one word. For example AIDS is 
an acronym for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and NATO is an acronym for North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. The two terms, abbreviations and acronyms, however, are 
sometimes used interchangeably. The term abbreviation is sometimes used in this book to 
refer to both. 
In this chapter, I provide you with a few tips on how abbreviations are used in English. 
Some of the tips are illustrated with examples from mainstream BrE and AmE publications. 
HOW TO DEFINE THEM 
It is important to clearly define the meaning of an abbreviation or acronym for the reader. 
Here are some rules:

6.1 When using an unfamiliar abbreviation or acronym for the first time, it is important 
that you write the name in full the first time it is mentioned, followed by the abbreviation 
or acronym, which is normally placed in brackets in BrE and without brackets in AmE. 
And also note that not all abbreviations are written in uppercase:
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which will now submit the plan to 
Congress, said broadband was the “greatest infrastructure challenge”. (BBC)
The aim would be for similar schemes to be established by countries belonging to, say, 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the Association of South East 
Asian Nations (Asean). (The Times)
Indian hydropower company NHPC launched a Rs60 billion ($1.25 billion) IPO on 
Friday. By the end of the first day of bookbuilding, the institutional tranche was six times 
covered. (BusinessWeek)

Abbreviations and Acronyms
6.2 In AmE, abbreviations are normally separated by a period or a full stop. In BrE, they are 
not separated by a period. Acronyms are normally written without periods in both varieties.
The P.R. people for the Oscars are busy coming up with cute headlines for their now 
daily announcements of the latest bold-faced names slated to appear on Sunday’s show. 
(LA Times)
Prime Minister Brian Cowen was meeting U.S. President Barack Obama at the White 
House. (LA Times)
The US is awaiting Israel’s response to its request for gestures to reassure the Palestinians. 
(BBC)
A Nobel peace prize-winning Welsh physicist says climate change scientists are losing “a 
PR war” against sceptics with vested interests. (BBC) 
NOTE The general rule in AmE is to use periods when the letters of an abbreviation stand 
for separate words. No periods separate the letters of an acronym – an abbreviation 
pronounced as one word – in both varieties of English. Acronyms are generally in 
uppercase if they are up to four letters long: SALT, AIDS, NATO. Acronyms of five or 
more letters are upper-and-lowercased: Unicef, Unesco, Oxfam, Awacs. Exceptions exist, 
and the dictionary is the best guide: modem, radar, UNDP, UNHCR. Also note that 
The New York Times writes abbreviations of broadcasting services, networks and stations 
without periods (i.e., CNN, PBS, NPR, BBC, KPFA ).
6.3 If the abbreviation is mentioned only once or twice, then you will need to write the 
full expression. 
6.4 If, however, the abbreviation occurs several times, then you should spell it out the first 
time it is used:
FSA report into RBS failure faces review
An investigation which cleared Royal Bank of Scotland of any wrongdoing in the run-
up to the financial crisis is to be reviewed, it has been announced. 
The Treasury Committee said the report, which was carried out by the Financial Services 
Authority, would be looked at by independent experts.

The FSA said last year that RBS made “a series of bad decisions” but there was no 
fraudulent or dishonest activity.
The report has not yet been published in full. 
Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, welcomed the review.
“There is strong public interest in having a clear account of the causes of RBS’ failure,” 
he said.
“The appointment of the independent reviewers will provide public assurance of the 
report’s openness and contribute to its quality.” 
As well as looking into the causes of RBS’s failure, the independent review will also look 
at the FSA’s regulation and supervision of RBS and “identify any deficiencies and actions 
taken by the FSA subsequently”, a statement said. 
“We need to know the decisive mistakes which destroyed RBS, how they came to be made, 
whether the FSA was asleep at the wheel, and whether we can have confidence that they 
are awake now,” said chairman of the Treasury Committee Andrew Tyrie. (BBC)
6.5 You can repeat the abbreviation as it is throughout your writing. It is sometimes necessary 
to use part of it or to repeat it by using different but relevant words and phrases:
GM earns $3.2 billion in 1Q on strong car sales, gain from former parts division Delphi
DETROIT – General Motors says its first-quarter net income more than tripled on 
strong car sales in the U.S. and China.
The company’s first-quarter net income totaled $3.2 billion, or $1.77 per share, one of 
its best performances since the SUV boom in the early 2000s. It was GM’s fifth straight 
quarterly profit since late 2009, the year it emerged from bankruptcy.
Quarterly revenue rose 15 percent to $36.2 billion. Worldwide sales climbed 12 percent, 
including a 25-percent jump in the U.S.
GM’s net income includes a $1.6 billion gain from the sale of its stake in Delphi 
Automotive, its former auto parts division. Without one-time items, GM earned 82

6.6 Note that some abbreviations such as the EU or UK are more common than the terms 
they stand for. In this case, there is probably no need to spell them out:

Britons living in the rest of the EU cannot claim the mobility element of UK disability 
benefit, the EU Court of Justice has confirmed.
Three people challenged the decision to stop their allowance several years ago because 
they moved abroad. (BBC)
6.7 It is quite common to keep abbreviations in headlines and titles. But you need to 
clarify them at the earliest possible opportunity, preferably in the first paragraph of your 
story or report:

Abbreviations and Acronyms
6.8 Remember that excessive use of abbreviations, acronyms, numerals and strings of 
capital letters brings discontinuity and confusion into your writing. Although their use is 
sometimes unavoidable, as a writer you will need to devise your own ways of how to make 
them clear to your audience.
6.9 You can live without using an abbreviation or acronym in the case of a short report. For 
example, The Associated Press, America’s number one news agency, only uses abbreviations 
or acronyms if absolutely necessary. The agency employs them sparingly and only to clarify 
if more than one group or program is mentioned in the text.
6.10 If abbreviations are necessary for clarity, stick to those that have been commonly used 
and understood in your field or institution. Resist the urge to turn larger official names 
into acronyms for the sake of convenience.
6.11 In naming new committees or organizations do not create a clever abbreviation and 
attempt to find a name that fits those parameters. Focus the work on creating an effective 
name for the group. Effective names speak louder than clever acronyms.
6.12 If mention of an abbreviation is necessary, for example to establish someone’s credentials, 
the preferred form is to avoid the abbreviation and use a phrase: Jim Smith, who has a 
master’s in physics, is an expert in his field.
6.13 Many people would like their degrees to be mentioned when referring to them. In 
academic writing, the preferred form is to avoid an abbreviation of title and degree as well 
as the first or middle names of authors. Mentioning the surname when placing citations 
inside the text is enough. In non-academic prose, you can place the abbreviated form of 
the degree before the name (first and surname) in first reference. In second reference, it is 
enough to use the abbreviated form and the surname:
“It’s very difficult to be a woman,” said Dr. Leslie Ford of the National Cancer Institute 
wryly. (first reference, NY Times)
“It’s been a real culture shift for gynecologists,” said Dr. Ford. (second reference, NY Times)
POINTS OF GRAMMAR AND STYLE
6.14 Do not use the abbreviated form of an academic degree before the name of its holder:
Ph.D. John Smith… 
Dr. John Smith… þ

Abbreviations and Acronyms
6.15 It is not recommended in English to begin your sentence with a lowercase abbreviation. 
Begin your sentence with a capitalized abbreviation or acronym. Rephrase your sentence if 
the acronym or abbreviation is originally in lowercase.
6.16 In non-academic prose, we generally avoid alphabet soap when using abbreviations 
(i.e., we try to avoid abbreviations or acronyms that are difficult for the reader to recognize).
6.17 To make acronyms or abbreviations such as kilo, MP, VIP plural, add a small s.
About £4m which was to be used for policing London was spent on protecting VIPs, 
the Met tells MPs. (BBC) 
6.18 Do not use courtesy titles and the academic degree abbreviation at the same time:
Dr. John Smith, Ph.D.,… 
Dr. John Smith… þ
6.19 Do not add an apostrophe and (s) (e.g., VIP’s) to denote the plural. Only use the 
apostrophe and (s) to denote the possessive form. Note that the final (s) in both cases is 
a small letter.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, says Europe has a “once in a generation 
opportunity” to build a robust new diplomatic service. (BBC) 
A groundbreaking new book…identifies Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams as a key Irish 
Republican Army figure who directed some of the IRA’s most notorious killings and 
bombings. (LA Times) 
6.20 Abbreviations and acronyms can function as pre-modifiers (precede the head or the 
main noun) in a noun combination. As such they are usually treated like nouns qualifying 
other nouns:

PUNCTUATION
The use of right punctuation marks in the right place is very important for the meaning of 
what you write in English. My experience shows that the use of punctuation marks does 
not have a universal character. In other words, different languages employ these signals 
in different ways and for different purposes. Punctuation marks might be the same across 
languages, but their use might be quite different. 
Not only that. The way punctuation marks are used might be different between the varieties 
of the same language. As if that is not enough of a problem for learners of English, different 
outlets within the same variety may employ different ways of using them. You will learn a 
lot about these differences if you compare, for instance, the way the BBC employs them 
with that of The New York Times. It will also be interesting, for instance, to compare 
their use by the BBC and The Times of London. This means that each publishing house, 
academic journal, media outlet and institution may have special instructions to authors on 
the use of punctuation.
But it will be much more revealing if you compare the way a prominent non-English media 
outlet, such as television, radio or newspaper, employs these marks with the way the BBC 
or The New York Times use them. The samples with erroneous use of punctuation marks 
examined in this book demonstrate this difference. My hope is that as we examine the errors 
and provide the right solutions, you will pick up enough knowledge on how punctuation 
marks are used in English, the areas where you may get it wrong, and how to identify and 
then rectify these errors.
The following guide is not an alternative to correct punctuation. The best guideline is to 
use your common sense. Try always to remember that incorrect punctuation can change the 
meaning of your sentence. Incorrect punctuation does not help the reader to track what you 
want to say. Punctuation marks are there to help you express your thoughts clearly. If they 
fail to help you make clear what you want to say, it is better not to have them. Clarity in 
writing should be your top priority. When you lose track when writing a sentence, it is best 
to give up and start fresh. It is no use fighting your way through with syntax in English. 
If your sentence is too long and too involved, it needs to be broken apart and replaced 
with shorter sentences. The same applies to punctuation. Excessive and unnecessary use of 
punctuation marks in a sentence makes it very hard to read.

Punctuation
Punctuation marks add balance and rhythm to your sentence. They are the signposts, telling 
the reader where to pause (comma, semicolon and colon), stop (period and question mark), 
or deviate from the direct and smooth flow of your sentence (dash, parentheses and brackets). 
Punctuation marks are tools that help writers to put a pause in the flow of their thoughts. 
The length of the pause depends on the kind of punctuation mark a writer employs.
GUIDE TO PUNCTUATION MARKS
Here are the types of punctuation marks we use in English. Please get acquainted with them 
before you move to the exercise in which erroneous samples are analyzed and suggestions 
provided on how to correct them. 
7.1	
The Apostrophe (’)
We use this for possession (genitive) and contraction (see Chapter 5).
7.1.1	 We also use the apostrophe plus (s) to denote decades:
Gordon Brown, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, announced a budget surplus of $19 
billion, the biggest since the booming 1980s, for the year ending March 31. (NY Times)
7.1.2 We use the apostrophe for plurals from numerals or letters (size 6’s; F-16’s):
Latin Democracies Do Not Need F-16’s (NY Times headline)
Size 6’s from different manufacturers are not exactly the same. (BBC) 
7.1.3 We use the apostrophe in expressions like 60 days’ notice, 12 years’ imprisonment. But 
we write: 60-day notice, a 20-year sentence:
Ames’s Wife Draws Sentence Of Five Years’ Imprisonment (NY Times headline)
Six-days’ notice is, in my judgment, a sufficient time. (NY Times)
7.2	
Brackets
There are four types of brackets in English: 
•	 (…) round brackets/brackets (BrE), parentheses (AmE)
•	 […] square brackets (BrE), square brackets (AmE)
•	 {…} braces (BrE), braces (AmE)
•	 <…> angle brackets (BrE), angle brackets (AmE)

Here is a summary of how different brackets are used in English with examples from 
mainstream British and American publications:
7.2.1 Parentheses are used mainly to set off structurally independent elements. They usually 
lead to a pause in the writer’s thought. In general, parentheses enclose an explanation or 
clarification of a construction the writer sees as difficult for the reader to understand:
Portugal’s three main political parties have given their blessing to new austerity measures 
in return for a €78 billion ($115 billion) bailout. (AP)
7.2.2 Do not use the dash and the parentheses together to indicate an aside or an abrupt 
interruption in the flow of a sentence:
The fact that only a very, very small group of trusted officials had this information – (even 
members of the executive board were not informed) – means that there were no serious 
discussion of the project. 

Punctuation
The fact that only a very, very small group of trusted officials had this information (even 
members of the executive board were not informed) means that there was no serious 
discussion of the project. 
7.2.3 Parentheses are used to set off citations inside the text when paraphrasing or quoting 
in academic English:
Their illegal spying was written into the extension of the Foreign Intelligence Service Act 
(The New York Times, 2007).
“Nowhere is the importance of policy more striking than with the Internt,” (Meikle and 
Redden 2011: 35).
Meikle and Redden (2011: 35) say, “Nowhere is the importance of policy more striking 
than with the Internt.”
7.2.4	 Parentheses are used to enclose an abbreviation once you have spelled it out when 
mentioned for the first time. Note that in general prose this rule usually applies to BrE. In 
AmE, the abbreviation is spelled out when first mentioned. The abbreviation is written in 
the second and later references:
A spokesman for New York’s Port Authority said they detained Mr Strauss-Kahn at JFK 
airport at the request of the New York Police Department (NYPD).
NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said Mr Strauss-Kahn had been charged with a criminal 
sexual act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment relating to an incident involving 
a 32-year-old woman. (BBC)
The International Space Innovation Centre (ISIC) aims to pull together new technologies, 
products and services to boost the sector still further. (BBC)
The head of the United Nations Children’s Fund in Belgium resigned today after the 
disclosure of a child pornography case linked to the Belgian branch of the organization. A 
spokesman at Unicef headquarters in Geneva said the head of the organization’s Belgian 
committee, Gilbert Jaeger, had resigned “to show how angry he is about what has happened 
in his organization.” (NY Times)

7.2.5 Use square brackets to enclose material you insert in a quotation. They indicate that 
the material enclosed between them does not belong to the original author. Confine their 
use to explain things that you think might be obscure for your readers in your quotation. 
Use them sparingly because they signal a shift from the verbatim text, diverting the reader’s 
attention from the flow of the quotation. (See Chapters 1 and 2) 
According to Durry (1977: 545), “The change [in the format of the newspaper] creates 
the conditions for a new dynamic in both the organization and journalism”.
7.3	
Colon (:)
A colon is used to introduce lists, definitions, equations or examples. There are four important 
things to note here. First, the structure after the colon may include independent clauses 
(sentences), dependent clauses or phrases. Second, in AmE we start the first word after the 
colon with a capital letter if the structure can stand for itself as an independent clause, 
otherwise we start with a small letter. Third, in BrE, the use of the uppercase or lowercase 
after the colon is not that consistent and differs from one outlet to another. Fourth, the 
colon is often used to separate the subject and reporting verb from the beginning of a 
quotation, mainly in BrE:
It’s easy to envision a headline like: “Lone Tourist in Pensacola Eaten by Visiting Walrus 
Herd.” (NY Times)
His unsatisfying call…used to drive Democrats nuts: open to all ideas, can’t afford inaction. 
(NY Times)
House routinely described him with the same words: ‘psychologically healthy.’ (NY Times)
In a blog post, Wikipedia said: “At present, only about 0.1% of the 3.3 million articles 
on the English Wikipedia are under edit protection.” (BBC)
President Obama has to be able to answer the most simple questions at a gut level: Do our 
interests merit such an escalation and do I have the allies to achieve victory? (NY Times)
The first question was hiding in plain sight: Why do we have to recruit and train our 
allies? (NY Times)
I have said this before, and I will say it again: The Middle East only puts a smile on your 
face when it starts with them. (NY Times)

Comma (,)
The following guidelines treat some of the most frequent questions you may have about the 
use of commas in English. These guidelines show how commas are used in standard English 
in major U.S. media, namely The Associated Press and The New York Times.
7.4.1 Commas are used to separate elements in a series, but do not use them before and 
or or in the same series unless their absence leads to confusion:
LaHood said almost 100 applications came in from 24 states, the District and Amtrak.

7.4.2 In case of complex series or phrases, put a comma before the concluding conjunction:
About 30 percent of all Virginians “strongly” support gay marriage, and 35 percent oppose 
it just as adamantly. (Washington Post)
7.4.3 Use a comma to enclose a nonessential (nonrestrictive) clause (that is, a clause 
providing incidental extra information). An essential (restrictive) clause, providing necessary 
information, does not go between commas (see 12.7.1): 
English universities allowed to charge UK students a maximum annual fee of £9,000 
from 2012, which graduates do not have to start paying until they are earning £21,000 
a year. (Guardian)
7.4.4 Set off your introductory dependent clauses, namely those indicated by complex 
sentence markers, from the main clause by a comma (see 12.4):
Despite several attempts to contact his London office, the Guardian has been unable to 
obtain comment from Musharraf. (Guardian)
Since Bin Laden’s death, Pakistan has come under intense US scrutiny. (Guardian)
7.4.5 Separate your introductory phrases (e.g. prepositional phrases) from the rest of the 
sentence by a comma:
Under current government plans, annual student numbers are capped to keep costs down. 
(Guardian)
In a speech in Texas, the president will highlight success at curtailing illegal immigration. 
(Washington Post)
After a slow start, Jayson Werth is trying to regain what made him one of the league’s 
top players. (Washington Post)
7.4.6 Use a comma before conjunctions like but, and and for (see 12.2) when they connect 
two independent clauses (i.e. they can stand alone as separate sentences), or when their 
subjects are clearly stated: 
Ofcom receives 450 telecoms complaints a day, and the largest areas of complaint are 
mis-selling. (Guardian)
I think the trade surplus will continue to shrink, and China is seeing a more balanced 
trade structure. (BBC)

7.4.7 But when the conjunction links two clauses whose subject is the same and is not 
repeated, you do not need to set it off by a comma:
The result has been a steep decline in illegal incursions and plummeting crime rates in 
U.S. border communities from Texas to California. (Washington Post)
The administration’s policy of deporting up to 400,000 illegal immigrants a year is 
disrupting families and targeting the wrong people. (Washington Post)
The Congress is all going to get together and give relief to the immigrant community. 
(Washington Post)
7.4.8 Use a comma to introduce a quotation (see Chapter 2).
7.4.9 You will need the comma to end your quote if the quote is followed by an attribution. 
Do not use a comma if the quoted material ends with an exclamation or a question mark 
(see Chapter 1):
“There are many steps that have yet to be undertaken in order to implement the 
agreement,” she said. (NY Times)
He added, “The novel aspect of the survey is, once we gave assurances about the right of 
return, the other issues became very resolvable.”
7.4.10 You will need a comma to end your paraphrase if it is followed by an attribution. 
Do not use a comma if the attribution is at the beginning of the paraphrase (see Chapter 3): 
The conflict and disrupted supply lines had delayed the arrival of commercial goods, she 
said. (BBC)
Administration officials said they expected the surplus to total $4.996 trillion in the 10 
years beginning with the start of the next fiscal year, on Oct. 1, 2001. (NY Times)
7.4.11 In general, use the comma for figures in thousands: 
Telephones were a new luxury enjoyed by fewer than 1,500 households. (NY Times)

NOTE Bear in mind that there are some minor differences in the use of commas between BrE 
and AmE. For detailed guidance, consult the punctuation section of the Oxford Advanced 
Learner’s Dictionary for BrE, and Webster’s New World College Dictionary for AmE.
7.5	
Dashes
The hyphen is mainly used to form compounds in English. Do not insert hyphens hastily 
and automatically when writing in English as their haphazard use can be confusing and 
misleading. To know whether a compound is formed with or without a hyphen, you will 
need to consult an authoritative dictionary in English.
There are three different dashes in English: 
•	 The en dash (–), which is short and has the length of letter ‘n’ in English.
•	 The em dash (—), which is longer and has the length of letter ‘m’ in English. This is 
mainly used before and after parenthetical structures. It can also be used as a signal 
to indicate that what comes after it is merely an explanation of what precedes it. 
•	 The hyphen whose length is the same as the en dash but with a different use.

The ordinance will potentially mislead consumers with point-of-sale requirements. (BBC)
On Monday night in Ohio, a 62-foot-tall statue of Jesus got hit by lightning and burned

value put on it by Microsoft’s interest. (Telegraph)
With a partnership, Facebook can tack another service onto its ever-expanding menu – a 
crucial feature given that many mobile devices, including tablets, now come equipped 
with front-facing cameras. (Reuters)
You will get enough information about the functions of each as you read through the 
samples with the erroneous use of punctuation.
7.6	
Full stop (BrE), period (AmE) (.)
We rarely pay attention to the use of the period in English, but it is a powerful mark of 
punctuation. It is the piece of punctuation that helps you overcome the tendency of writing 
too many clauses together. The period helps readers not to lose their concentration and 
lump too many ideas in one sentence. It is the mark which is always there at your disposal 
to partition your ideas into separate sentences. 
7.7	
Double or single inverted commas (quotation marks) (“…”) or (‘…’)
What appears inside the inverted commas depends on the variety of English you follow. In 
American English, the periods or commas at the end of the text quoted are placed before 
the inverted commas, whether single or double. In British English, they are placed outside 
if they do not belong to the quoted material, particularly when partial quotes are used 
(see 2.15). Otherwise, they are placed inside the quoted material.

Here are a few examples demonstrating how the commas and periods are used at the end 
of quoted text in BrE:
Walkouts would be unavoidable if BA refused to immediately work with the union to 
address “outstanding issues”, said Tony Woodley. (Guardian)
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak pledged to take “stern action”. (BBC)
“We will implement our contingency plan to keep British Airways flying,” the company 
said in a statement. (BBC)
The judge described the killing as “senseless and unnecessary”. (BBC)
He told McMullan: “You stabbed her in broad daylight in the town centre. She had 
everything to live for.” (BBC)
Here are a few examples demonstrating how the commas and periods are used at the end 
of quoted text in AmE:
Still, he added, “It would not surprise me at all if somebody in the White House decided 
that we ought to suspend or debar BP just because it will make it look like we’re doing 
something.” (NY Times)
“The trickle-down can often exceed the initial problem,” he said. (NY Times)
“BP may think they are dealing with one big man across the ring,” Mr. Hester said. “The 
fact is, they are going to have a tag team.” (NY Times)
7.8	
Semicolon (;)
The semicolon is receding from non-professional writing, and some mainstream publications 
such as the BBC rarely use it. However, its use is still important particularly in mainstream 
AmE publications in the case of complicated lists to clarify which items belong to 
which category. The other important use is when writers want to join two closely linked 
independent clauses: 
Though their region contributes nearly 80 percent of the government’s revenue, they have 
hardly benefited from it; life expectancy is the lowest in Nigeria. (NY Times)
The swamp was deserted and quiet, without even bird song; before the spills, Mr. Kanyie 
said, women from Bodo earned a living gathering mollusks and shellfish among the 
mangroves. (NY Times)

7.11 There is inconsistency in the use of punctuation marks here. First, we do not start 
with a capital letter after a semi-colon. Second, if you use a semi-colon to separate a list, 
do not change it to another punctuation mark in the same list. Third, we need and before 
the last item on the list:
Research topics covered were for example the following: Business development activities 
of biotech start-ups; Performance and value added of corporate venture capital; Patenting 
strategies in the semiconductor industry: Licensing strategies in the biotech industry: The 
influence of incubators on the development to startups. 
Research topics covered were, for example, the following: business development activities 
of biotech start-ups; performance and value added of corporate venture capital; patenting 
strategies in the semiconductor industry; licensing strategies in the biotech industry; and 
the influence of incubators on the development of startups. 
7.12 First, the wrong use of punctuation makes the following sentence hard to read. Do 
not use forward slashes or backward slashes ‘/’ ‘\’ to separate synonyms (words with almost 
the same meaning). In fact their use is restricted in general writing to instances such as and/
or, he/she, etc. Second, do not use synonyms one after another in this way. One of them is 
sufficient and the choice is yours as a writer. Third, and is a connector, but the two bits it 
combines in the following sentence do not go together. It is much better that you start a 
new sentence instead of linking the structures by and. At the same time, there is subject-
verb disagreement in the sentence. See the correct version below to note how these pitfalls 
have been clarified:
Thibault was introduced by one of his friends/colleagues and Donada & Nogatchewsky 
(2006) is one of the few articles in which interaction between coordination mechanisms 
in interorganizational relations have been explicitly recognized. 
Donada & Nogatchewsky’s (2006) is one of the few articles in which interaction between 
coordination mechanisms in inter-organizational relations is explicitly recognized. 
7.13 First, there is no need for the hyphen here. Second, according to is misplaced. Do 
not separate definite or indefinite articles (a, an, the) in this way. It is much better to place 
according to at the end of the sentence:
The VMI-project in itself was an example of how the control proposed from the customer 
could be seen as causing resources to be deployed in an, according to the supplier, 
inefficient way in the perspective of the supply chain. 

7.14 You need a hyphen to link inter with organizational. You will need to be careful 
with the use of the so-called ‘co-words’ in English which start with prefixes such as inter-, 
co-, multi-, semi-, post-, pre-, non-, anti-, etc. Some of them are hyphenated, others are 
not. There are no special rules. The rule of thumb is to look up the word in a dictionary 
or check how authoritative English web sites use it. But remember, there are differences 
between BrE and AmE and consistency is important (see Chapter 8). Further, you will need 
an apostrophe after the plural (s) in suppliers:
The suppliers calculation of costs in the inter organizational relationship… 
The suppliers’ calculation of costs in the inter-organizational relationship… 
7.15 You will need a comma after the word model because the phrase value chain model 
belongs to Porter which you will need to indicate by the possessive form:
According to Porter (1985) value chain model a company is a part of a longer chain 
of different activities. 
According to Porter’s (1985) value chain model, a company is a part of a longer chain 
of different activities. 
7.16 Be consistent in the use of inverted commas. Do not shift between single and double 
inverted commas when quoting. It is recommended that you reserve your single inverted 
commas for emphasis, or indicating doubt or displeasure with the concept, the word or 
phrase placed between them. Reserve your double inverted commas for quoting:
A central point of departure for a cultural historical analysis of leadership is to see leaders 
more as “transmitters” than ‘authors’ of culture. 
A central point of departure for a cultural historical analysis of leadership is to see leaders 
more as ‘transmitters’ than ‘authors’ of culture. 
7.17 You will need to be careful with the use of abbreviations, such as e.g. or i.e. (see 
Chapter 6). These abbreviations are usually separated from the preceding and the following 
word by a comma. Do not try to overuse them in your writing:
In all the fields there is a battle of influence and power and to reach a position requires 
resources – i.e. access to the specific capital that is feasible in the field. 
In all fields there is a battle of influence and power. Reaching a position of power requires

Provincial press is e.g. the sector which has the lowest proportion of women in leading 
positions. 

positions. 
7.19 The use of the hyphen in noun phrases (groups of words headed by a noun) is vital 
for meaning. Note for instance the difference between high-voltage cable which means a 
cable with a high voltage, and high voltage cable which means the cable is high and has voltage. 
Similarly, there is a difference in meaning between a high-school building and a high school 
building. You will need to distinguish between U.S.-led invasion and U.S. led invasion. In 
the former, U.S.-led is an adjective qualifying (describing) the invasion. In the latter, U.S. 
is subject, led verb and invasion object. Also, you will need to distinguish between student-
training session where student-training is an adjective, and student training session where 
student is subject and training verb. With a hyphen, the meaning is a session for the training 
of students. Without a hyphen, one would assume that the students are training the session. 
Bearing these points in mind, try to correct the following:

7.23 The position of the em dash is legitimate here but unfortunately the writer fails to use 
it properly. em dashes are longer than hyphens and computers today help you distinguish 
between them and the en dashes. You need to leave a space before and after a hyphen as 
you write in order to turn your en dash into an em dash. In the following sample, the 
parenthesis starts with a dash and ends with a hyphen. Moreover, note how the writer 
erroneously places could between a hyphen and a dash. For correct punctuation, turn the 
hyphen after exist into a dash and place in my opinion between two commas:
A closer look at the examples of organizing will reveal patterns of firms’ compliance to 
solutions already present, and most of them – although some exceptions exist – could – 
in my opinion not be referred to as entrepreneurial or innovative. 

CONSISTENCY
Consistency is very important for style. It is in fact one of the chief features which contribute 
to effective writing in English. If your writing is inconsistent, readers will find it difficult to 
pursue your thoughts and ideas. Consistency helps readers evaluate what you write, respond 
to it and linguistically associate with it. 
Inconsistency in writing in English appears in several aspects of language, many of which 
we deal with in this book. Your writing will be inconsistent if you switch between BrE 
and AmE, or if you switch between formal and informal vocabulary in the same report, 
paper, essay or book. There are several grammatical features that are usually a characteristic 
of informal style, e.g. phrasal verbs (see 14.15), contractions (see p. 154) and colloquial or 
informal vocabulary. Formal style, on the other hand, exhibits formal usage, such as complex 
noun phrases, subordinate clauses (see 12.3) and absence of contracted forms.
Consistency requires predictability in several other aspects of grammar, style and layout. 
For instance, it is important that you as a writer be consistent in the use of the tense of 
the verb, the use of punctuation, spelling and variety of English.
This chapter focuses on some common learning errors you may make when writing with 
regard to consistency. Consistency is a wide topic in linguistics and covers issues such as 
cohesion and coherence (see Chapter 13). Here, I will give you some of the most representative 
samples of these pitfalls along with tips on how to get rid of them.
CONSISTENCY IN THE TENSE OF THE VERB
8.1 Verbs linked by coordinators or part of coordinating structures (see 12.2) usually have 
the same tense. This means that if the verb or verbs preceding a coordinator are present 
tense, the one or the ones following it will take the same tense. The grammatical pitfall 
indicated in bold in the following is due to lack of consistency in the tense of the verb. It 
should have the same tense as the verb in the structure coordinated by and: 
Advertising can be used to spread a new offer and also indicates how successful the 
company is. 

denouncing them. 
8.3 The verb analyze in the following will have to agree with the preceding verb as both 
appear in the same structure coordinated by and:

in order to confirm the validity of the method we have chosen. 

CONSISTENCY IN LISTING
8.4 It is important to be consistent when listing things in writing. If you start the first item 
on your list with a noun, let the item or items that follow also start with nouns. If you start 
the first item on your list with a verb in a particular tense, let the other verb or verbs that 
follow have the same tense. Do not mix between different grammatical structures, i.e., do 
not start the first item on your list with a verb and the second with a noun. Finally, make 
sure that the first item on your list follows smoothly and correctly, from the grammar point 
of view, the word or structure immediately preceding it. The following is a good example 
of an error in listing. The verb after b should agree with the tense of the verb following 
a. Also, try to indicate the start of a list in writing with a comma (,) or a colon (:) (see 
Chapter 7 for further details on the use of the comma and the colon). Furthermore, the 
sentence includes two more errors in subject-verb agreement:
However, practically this is done by a) selecting a number of codes that the researcher 
think is relevant, b) define conceptual categories. 
However, practically this is done by, a) selecting a number of codes that the researcher 
thinks are relevant, and b) defining conceptual categories. 
CONSISTENCY IN BULLET POINTS
8.5 Consistency is important when you use bullet points. Remember that your bullet points 
must fit the correct flow of syntax as if they are part of the structure or clause through 
which you direct the reader’s attention to them. The bullet points in the following example 
do not flow smoothly. They should be read as if each one of them is an integral part of 
The general feature analysis process consists of…. One way to get your bullets right is 
to read out the introductory part with each point and see whether they form one complete 
grammatical structure. If you read out the introductory part – written in bold – ending with 
the preposition of, you will see that three of the bullet points are in grammatical mismatch. 
Prepositions are normally followed by nouns or gerunds and not verbs:

verb. The verb include needs an object, the position normally occupied by a noun phrase. 
As a result three points do not follow the introductory part smoothly:

8.7 Try to end your introductory structure with the type of word or expression that will 
make it easy for you to list your points. It is extremely difficult to be grammatically consistent 
in the following. You will need to make many changes before you get it right:
Even if the three relationships are different in several ways, there are also a number of 
similarities

8.8 The introductory structure of the following bullet points ends with must which has to 
be followed by the base form of the verb. If you read it out, you will find that two points 
do not start with the base form of the verb in English:

8.9 Do we start our bullet points with a lowercase or uppercase? In fact both ways of 
writing are acceptable, but it is preferable to start your bullet points with a lowercase if 
they are mainly phrases or dependent clauses and only add a period (full stop) to the last 
point. Begin with an uppercase if your bullet points are complete sentences and end each 
point with a period:

three options:

as essentially hostile
•	 explore for more oil at home
•	 reduce consumption, through frugality and/or alternative fuels.
(BBC)
However, the Bank of England indicated that indirect exposures were substantial. For example:
•	 UK banks have major “counterparty” exposure to its fellow European banks, and 
a default by Greece and other sovereign borrowers could lead to the collapse of 
these European banks.
•	 The European debt crisis could scare markets, making them less willing to lend to 
anyone they consider risky, including UK banks.
•	 Greater market fear could also lead to falling prices for risky assets like corporate 
bonds, forcing UK banks to write down the value of their loans and other assets, 
causing them heavy losses.

CURRENCIES
How do you write currency names, their symbols and abbreviations? In my experience as 
editor and English language teacher, I see the writing of currency names, their symbols and 
abbreviations as one of the problematic areas for many learners when writing English. Every 
currency has a name, usually a symbol and often an abbreviation (a code). In English, we 
have special ways of referring to currencies in writing, and I am afraid many students ignore 
these ways when writing English. For instance, it is important to note that more than one 
country may share the same currency name and symbol, such as the dollar. Other issues 
to bear in mind include the way the currency names are written, and where to place their 
symbols and abbreviations.
Here are a few tips on how to deal with currencies in written English:
9.1 When one particular currency, such as the dollar, shares the same symbol and name with 
other currencies, it is important that you tell the reader which one you are referring to at 
the start of your writing. Note that there are several countries in the world which call their 
currency the dollar, but each country gives its currency a different abbreviation or code. For 
instance, HKD (Hong Kong dollar), NZD (New Zealand dollar), CAD (Canadian dollar), 
and AUD (Australian dollar). Four Nordic states (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland) 
call their currency krona or krone, but use different abbreviations to refer to it:
The US dollar continues to slide on international currency markets as fears of US interest 
rate increases grow. (BBC)
Economy sweats over Aussie dollar (BBC headline)
Lars Heikensten, head of Sweden’s central bank who remains the guardian of the Swedish 
currency, the krona, said Monday would be “just another day in the office”. (BBC)
Bilfinger’s move comes despite recent market volatility and a slide in the Australian 
dollar. (NY Times)
9.2 When dealing with non-hard or even hard currencies, try to mention their worth in 
U.S. dollars. If you are citing U.S. dollars, try to convert them to the currency your readers 
know most about, preferably their local currency. It gives them an idea of the currency’s 
exchange rate and value:
Iran has doubled the denomination of its highest banknote to 100,000 rials ($10, £6.50), 
its Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani has announced. (BBC)
The average sales price of new homes sold in May was $263,400 (£176,900). (BBC)
Seventeen bathroom equipment makers have been fined a total of 622m euros ($760; 
£510m) by the European Commission for price-fixing. (BBC)

9.3 Currency names start with small letters unless they occur at the beginning of a sentence 
or are part of a headline where the rule is to write the first letter of every content word 
(see Chapter 14) in uppercase: 
Dollar loses ground against euro (BBC headline)
The dollar has plunged to its lowest level against the euro. (BBC)
For the last 18 months, China has kept the yuan pegged to the weakening US dollar, 
hurting EU exports to China. (BBC)
China’s currency is the renminbi, also known as the yuan, its basic unit. (NY Times)
Is Greece’s Debt Trashing the Euro? (NY Times headline)
9.4 When full currency names are used with amounts, they are placed after the amount:
In currencies,the dollar reversed losses to steady at 89.43 yen. (NY Times)
The Harrods department store in London has been sold to Qatari Holdings for around 
1.5 billion pounds, the BBC said today. (Bloomberg)

In the whole of 2009, Exxon made a profit of £19.28bn. (BBC)
US oil giant Exxon Mobil is buying natural gas producer XTO Energy in a deal worth 
$41bn (£25bn). 
Analysis by The Economist suggests a figure of €75 billion rather than €25 billion. 
(Economist)
9.6 Currency abbreviations (codes) of major currencies can be used instead of their full 
names:
The major exception was USD-JPY, which remained inside relatively narrow trading 
bands. (BusinessWeek)
GBP Hits New Low Against the Euro. (Washington Post headline)
9.7 Currency abbreviations are placed before the amount with a space separating them:
The Lord Advocate, Andrew Hardie, has issued a consultation paper that aims to raise the 
ceiling on civil claims from GBP 1,500 to as much as GBP 50,000. (Washington Post)

might cost consumers as much as $600 million a year. (NY Times)
9.10 When dealing with money and in any currency, the rule of spelling out numbers 
below 10 does not apply: 
Sharks can be worth far more when they are swimming around the reef than when they 
are in a bowl of soup – as much as nearly $2 million each. (NY Times)
9.11 Not all currencies have symbols. In English, we normally use symbols for hard 
currencies like the dollar ($), the pound (£) and the euro (€). Spell out other currency names, 
particularly in the first reference. You can use currency abbreviations for later references in 
the same article:
The Canadian dollar began its ascent early in 2003. (NY Times)
The Canadian dollar rose against more than half of its 16 major peers, climbing the 
most, 0.9 percent, against the British pound. (Business-Week)

The Progressive Tense
98
10	 THE PROGRESSIVE TENSE
The progressive tense (or progressive aspect) combines the use of either the past or present 
forms of the verb be (is, am, are, was and were) and the -ing form of the main verb. With 
the progressive tense, the usual implication is that the event or activity goes on over a limited 
period of time, and is not necessarily finished yet. I have noticed that many English language 
learners have a tendency to use the progressive tense with verbs and instances where the 
present tense or past tense are more appropriate. Common English learning errors occur 
mainly due to confusion resulting from meanings of the verbs used. 
We divide verbs into different categories in English. On major classification is between static 
and dynamic. With dynamic verbs (e.g., play, hit, kick, melt), the agent is actively involved 
in the action or event. With stative verbs (e.g., hate, believe, own, have, hear, know), no 
action is involved on the part of the agent as they express and identify processes or states 
of being and mind. The latter group do not usually occur in the progressive. 
There is another important aspect for learners of English to remember. In English, only a 
few verbs appear in the progressive (the estimate is less than 5%). Moreover, they are more 
frequent in conversation than writing.

The Progressive Tense
One way to avoid pitfalls in the use of the progressive tense is to resort to the present simple 
tense whenever possible. The present simple tense can be used in most cases where learners 
get it wrong with the use of the progressive tense as the samples below demonstrate. The 
present tense is versatile in English in the sense that it does not only indicate the present 
time but can even describe events that happen repeatedly within a time frame that overlaps 
between the present, past and future.
EXERCISE
Here are a few examples of some of the most frequent pitfalls learners make with the use 
of the progressive tense when writing English:
10.1 The use of is demanding is inappropriate in the following:
The segmentation is demanding an effort from the individual. 
The segmentation demands an effort from the individual. 
10.2 So is the use of is depending in the following:
It is depending on relations between the actors. 

10.3 Here are more examples:
It is diminishing the impact. 
It diminishes the impact. 
Hence, it is not showing any large skewness. 

These are ranging from the smallest with about 5 employees, to the largest publishers 
with hundreds of employees. 

publisher. 

They devote 35% of their working hours to undergraduate education. 
10.4 Apart from the erroneous use of the progressive tense are following, the sentence below 
is awkward. The reason is the use of the slash (/) twice (see Chapter 7) and the repetition 
of the same expression product/project also twice. One way to solve a long and awkward 
sentence (see p. 127) like this one is to divide it into two separate sentences:
The costing situations are following the product/project and the situations that are a 
part of the relationship but not related to a specific product/project is included. 
The costing situations follow the project or the product. They also follow the situations 
that are part of the relationship but are not linked to a specific project or product. 
10.5 Here is another long and awkward sentence (see p. 127). Besides the error in the 
progressive tense, the sentence needs to be rewritten and divided into two separate sentences: 
The 3&4 and 5&6 relationships are undermining the way to showing the costs in order 
to motivate the costs should mainly be seen as a short term and rare occurrence that the 
buyers are accepting inefficiency. 
The relations between 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 undermine the way the costs are shown. 
To be motivated, they should mainly be seen as short term and a rare occurrence of the 
buyers accepting inefficiency. 

10.6 The following sentence has more than one error. First, it is incomplete (see Chapter 12). 
Second, it includes an inappropriate use of the progressive tense:
When the products in a production process are flowing in a continuous fashion like e.g. 
a petrol refinery. 
When the products in a production process flow without interruption, as is the case with 
a petrol refinery, maintenance costs drop. 
NOTE The correct version above completes the sentence. The additional independent clause is 
marked in bold. The sentence starts with when, which is a complex sentence marker 
(see 12.4 ). Other changes include the omission of expressions like are flowing in a 
continuous fashion and like e.g. which I see as superfluous.

The Progressive Tense
10.7 The following is yet another good example of an awkward sentence (see p. 127). It 
has to be rephrased. In the meantime, it has two grammatical pitfalls, one in the use of the 
progressive tense, and the other in subject-verb agreement (see Chapter 4):
On the other hand, if the wage is not compensating for the attractiveness, but the 
accessibility to attractiveness actually add some value we can expect a positive sign. 
However, the accessibility to attractiveness actually adds some value. We can still expect 
a positive sign if the wage does not compensate for attractiveness. 
10.8 We need two separate sentences in order to make the following read well. As we 
rewrite, we will need to get rid of the grammatical pitfalls which include an error in the 
use of the progressive tense as well as an error in subject-verb agreement:
The sales are also a lot slower now comparing to earlier this year, there is rarely more 
than two that is bidding on the same apartment. 
The sales are a lot slower when compared to earlier this year. There are rarely more than 
two persons bidding for the same apartment. 

Pronouns
11	 PRONOUNS
This chapter is not about the syntactic and semantic properties of pronouns. I am sure you 
have read a lot about pronouns from your school or university grammar of English. It is 
not my intention to repeat the same information here. You could always go back to your 
school grammar books and learn more about pronouns. Such information is now readily and 
easily accessible on the Internet. All you need to do is to write ‘English pronouns’ on the 
Google search engine, and you will be face to face with countless web sites on the subject, 
among them some by the world’s most prestigious U.S. and British universities. There is no 
dearth of information on the grammatical and syntactic features of pronouns. But there is 
a dearth of information on the common errors learners of English make in this important 
area of grammar and advice on how to correct them. 
EXERCISE
The following are some of the commonest errors learners may make when using pronouns 
in English. Go over them carefully, using the tips given before each erroneous instance as 
a tool for correction on your own before reading the suggested correct versions:
11.1 Try to replace the second mention of the same subject in the same sentence by a 
pronoun. See also what is wrong with the way split ups is written: 
When the costs are discussed between the buyer and seller, the costs are presented either 
in formal cost split ups or in special interorganizational form. 
When the costs are discussed between the buyer and seller, they are presented either in 
formal cost split-ups or in special inter-organizational form. 
11.2 Do not use he/she, his/her when the referent (the noun being referred to) is plural. 
Also note that the form of the verb after to is wrong:
One thought behind the design of the doctoral program was that the doctoral candidates 
should have a chance to developing his or her skills gradually. 

should have a chance to develop their skills gradually. 

11.3 Try not to exceed 20–25 words per sentence. Your simple sentence, of course, can be 
much shorter and that is quite alright in English. Other points to note include the use of 
parenthetical clauses like the one between the two brackets. Try to avoid such structures 
unless absolutely necessary. You could always have them in a separate sentence. Other things 
to note here include the superfluous repetition of doctoral candidates (3 times) as well as 
the wrong use of he or she and the progressive contributing:
The design of the post-graduate education is to some extent fixed but since the doctoral 
candidates are supposed to create a plan for their time as doctoral candidates, (most 
of all doctoral candidates have written plan), he or she is contributing to the design 
and development of the program. 
The design of post-graduate education is to some extent fixed but since doctoral candidates 
are supposed to write a research plan, they contribute to the design and development 
of the program. Almost all doctoral candidates have their own written plans. 

11.4 One way of getting rid of what appears to be ‘sexist language’ (see p. 165) is to turn 
nouns that are neuter in gender into plural if possible. Rewrite this one by starting your 
sentence as follows: Doctoral students are employed under one-year renewable contracts… 
and then continue on your own:
Employment as a doctoral student is for one year at a time and extensions depend on the 
progress the doctoral student make in his/her studies according to his/her individual 
study plan. 
Doctoral students are employed under one-year renewable contracts. The duration of 
their study and research depends on the progress they make in accordance with their 
study plans. 
11.5 Try to introduce pronouns to replace respondents which is repeated four times in 
the following sentence. You could start your sentence as follows: In my first round of 
interviews, I collected general data about the respondents, their…
In the first interviews with respondents I collected general data about the respondents, 
the respondents organization, and specific questions about the respondents formal 
planning. 
In my first round of interviews, I collected general data about the respondents, their 
organizations and their formal planning. 
11.6 Always make sure that you use the right pronoun and that you, as a writer, are aware 
of which noun it refers to. The pronoun it does not fit here:
The actors do not express that it needs a business plan. 
The actors do not say whether the entrepreneurs are in need of a business plan. 
11.7 We do not know what it in the following sentence refers to. From the context, the 
nearest noun is what one assumes would stand for their which it could be a plural noun:
Due to their weak power in relation to their resource denependencies, it follows the 
prediction of Oliver (1991). 

up their, which is a possessive pronoun, with them, which is an object pronoun:

Strategies of new ventures are influenced by two of their qualities. 

but also the size of those. 
It is important to find a measure that will grasp not only the number of establishments 
but also their size. 
11.9 There is no need to mention magic twice. Replace the second mention of the word 
with an appropriate pronoun:
Describing magic positively leads to the neglect of harmful effects of magic. 
Describing magic in a positive way leads to the neglect of its harmful effects. 
11.10 Do not start a new paragraph with a pronoun such as it that requires an explicit 
referent to be understood. You can use it if the referent is existential, i.e., with a universal 
and not specific referent, as this example from the BBC shows: It is common knowledge that 
most interest rates for business borrowing are in double figures: 
It implies that the business plan tool is grounded in an array of concepts and behaviors…  
The discussion above implies that the business plan tool is grounded in an array of 
concepts and behaviors. 
NOTE The pronoun it could stand for something else and not necessarily The discussion above. 
The idea is if the pronoun is not existential, you as a writer will need to replace it by 
what it stands for, particularly when starting a new paragraph.
11.11 To have his/her/its replacing one referent in English is quite unacceptable. If possible, 
turning the owner into plural could perhaps help solve the problem:
The owner has legal protection assuring his/her/its right as exclusive user in certain 
geographical areas. 
Owners have legal protection assuring their right as exclusive users in certain geographical 
areas. 

be used as the complete explanation for branding. 

details see 15.42). Then try to see what is wrong with ones in the following:

11.25 In the following sentence the writer uses the pronoun he to refer backward to the 
immediate antecedent. Make sure which pronoun fits if you have more than one antecedent. 
The cars had arrived but the dealer said he was not for sale. 
The cars had arrived but the dealer said they were not for sale. 
11.26 Use pronouns to replace nouns that are repeated more than once in one sentence. In 
the following, it is better to replace the management of brands with their management:
How a firm can understand whether brands and the management of brands is actually 
a helpful strategy. 
How can a firm understand whether brands and their management are actually a helpful 
strategy? 
11.27 Using the right pronoun to refer to words and expressions such as every, each, 
someone, somebody, everybody, etc. is rather problematic. This is also the case with gender 
neutral singular nouns that refer to persons, e.g. student, teacher, artist. In English, we are 
sensitive to the way we refer to a person whose gender is not specified. Using the masculine 
pronoun he is no longer acceptable in many contexts. The best solution today is the use 
of plural pronouns. Using he or she and his or her is still an option, but their excessive 
use is not recommended at all. The plural today is a better option. I would suggest they 
instead of his/her in the following sentence. Also note the wrong use of interests, which 
many learners take to mean interest rates (see 3.32):
Everyone should be able to pay his/her interests. 
Everyone should be able to pay their interest rates. 

12	 SENTENCES
A grammar of any language usually aims to describe how its sentences are constructed. 
English language grammars divide sentences into two main types: notional and formal. A 
notional sentece is one which expresses a single thought. A formal sentence relies on how 
a sentence is constructed – the pattern of words it contains. Modern grammar books of 
English adopt the formal approach to sentences and usually overlook the notional approach. 
This book pays due attention to both approaches.
Formally, a sentence in written English begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, 
a question mark or an exclamation mark. But it is important to remember that the formal 
description of a written sentence in English does not apply to every single situation. In 
this book, we have several sentences representing newspaper headlines which do not end 
in a period. You may also come across such sentences in advertising, public notices and 
legal documents.

Sentences
There are several types of sentences in English. Good writers do not confine themselves to 
one type. They use a variety of sentences. This makes their writing vivid, interesting and 
lively. However, I advise the use of as many short sentences as possible. Long sentences, 
experience shows, are difficult to read, hard to understand and not easy to write.
WHAT IS A SENTENCE IN ENGLISH?
A sentence (a clause) in English starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop (.), 
question mark (?) or an exclamation mark (!). It contains a group of words comprising a 
subject and a predicate. A predicate includes a verb. It may also have an object, a complement 
or an adverb. Remember, a sentence, whether simple, compound or complex, must produce 
a complete thought.
As this book is not about English grammar or English linguistics, I will only outline here 
information, which I think will help you produce proper sentences in English.
We have three major types of sentences in English: (1) simple sentences which have only one 
clause, expressing a complete thought, (2) compound sentences which have two independent 
clauses each capable of expressing one complete thought, and (3) complex sentences, which 
have two or more clauses, one of which has to be independent, i.e. capable of expressing 
one complete thought.
TYPES OF SIMPLE SENTENCES IN ENGLISH
There are basically seven types of simple sentences in English. They combine the following 
elements: Subject (S), Verb (V), Object (O), Complement (C) and Adverbial (A). These 
elements appear basically in seven patterns. Examples:
a.	 SV	
	
The sun (S) is shining (V).
b.	SVO		
The lecture (S) bored (V) me (O).
c.	 SVC	 	
Your dinner (S) seems (V) ready (C).
d.	SVA	 	
My office (S) is (V) in the next building (A).
e.	 SVOO	
I (S) must send (V) my parents (O) an anniversary card (O).
f.	 SVOC	
Most students (S) have found (V) her (O) reasonably helpful (C).
g.	 SVOA	
You (S) can put (V) the dish (O) on the table (A).2

My teaching experience shows that learners normally make errors when attempting to 
write compound or complex sentences. This chapter provides you with some tips on how 
to overcome these problems. Read these tips carefully before moving to the exercises where 
you will be asked to rewrite specimens of incorrect sentences students, teachers, academics 
and professionals have produced.
COMPOUND SENTENCES
Compound sentences bring two independent clauses together. They are called independent 
because each one of them can stand by itself to produce a complete thought or a simple 
sentence. The lexical items that join the two independent clauses are called coordinators or 
conjunctions. In writing, they are normally preceded by a comma. Coordinators are easy 
to recognize in English. Bringing their first letters together, they form FANBOYS: for, and, 
nor, but, or, yet, so.
Here are some examples from mainstream BrE and AmE publications. Study them carefully, 
highlighting where their writers place their commas (see 7.4) and noting how each of 
their independent clauses could stand by itself to produce one simple sentence with a 
complete thought:
Growth and recovery are expected in 2010 in most world regions, but the upturn will 
be modest. (BBC)
The BBC’s reputation for honesty and integrity is now in tatters, yet this isn’t a private 
firm. (BBC)
That way, all the sections load, including pictures, so it’s available offline. (NY Times)
Acapulco is one of Mexico’s biggest tourist resorts, but in recent years it has been the 
scene of bloody turf wars between rival drug cartels. (BBC) 
“He didn’t structure them or negotiate them, nor was he aware of their accounting 
treatment,” his attorney Patricia Hynes said. (BBC)
England may have 66 times as many players, yet the underdog seemed to have a far better 
idea of how it was going to win on Saturday. (Times Online)
When they met, he got Gloria to type up his book, so she became intimately acquainted 
with every anatomical detail of her fiancé’s former loves. (Times Online)

“Lesbian couples and unmarried couples usually have other routes available to them if 
they want to have children, but surrogacy is particularly important to gay men, so they

provisions that will anger the green lobby. (Guardian)
They do not give a toss about the children involved here, nor do they consider gay people 
like anyone else, they consider themselves a special case. (Guardian) 
COMPLEX SENTENCES
Complex sentences are made up of more than one clause. One of these clauses is called 
independent, i.e. it can stand by itself and express a complete thought. The other is called 
dependent or subordinate, i.e. it does not express a complete idea and grammatically cannot 
stand by itself. Complex sentences can express more than one idea and have more than 
one verb in them.

Sentences
The distinction between dependent and independent clauses is important in English. It 
assumes more importance for learners of English. It is here some of the most frequent errors 
are made. Lack of this distinction is a major source of the type of awkward sentences cited 
as examples of poor English in this book.
Therefore, it is important to remember that independent clauses are complete sentences with 
a subject + predicate (object, complement or adverbial). They express complete thoughts 
in both context and meaning.
Dependent (subordinate) clauses are incomplete sentences or parts of sentences. They do not 
make sense on their own and cannot express a complete thought. Their meaning depends 
on the rest of the sentence.
COMPLEX SENTENCE MARKERS
There are certain lexical items whose presence signals that the sentence is of the complex 
type. They are called subordinating conjunctions. These words initiate or start a dependent 
clause. Here is a list of the most frequent subordinating conjunctions in English. They are 
arranged alphabetically:
after
even though
now that
until
although
how
once

NON-FINITE CLAUSES
One other area of difficulty when writing English is the use of non-finite clauses. The 
sentences containing these clauses are complex in the sense that they have an independent 
clause, expressing a complete thought and another dependent part, which cannot express 
an idea on its own.
There are three non-finite forms of the verb:
•	 to + infinitive:
To study in Britain, a foreign student should at least have a highschool degree. 
•	 -ing participle:
Leaving home, he was attacked by burglars.
•	 -ed participle:
Written in 1959, the book soon became a classic.
Sentences with non-finite clauses are lively, vivid and add beauty to writing. But please do 
not use them excessively. Use them sparingly as parts of sentences that are not too long.

Also note that non-finite clauses can be used to modify (add further information) to nouns. 
These are normally viewed as reduced clauses in which the relative pronouns (see 12.7) 
have been omitted:
•	 -ing participle:
Policies covering legal costs have to be revised.
Nations pursuing ‘war on terror’ are divided.
Countries vying for a slice of the Indian market held a meeting in London. 
•	 -ed participle:
Orders placed by the company were rejected.
Efforts exerted to win contracts have failed.
•	 Noun + to-infinitive
Action to tackle market weakness is necessary.
Plans to boost solvency are being discussed at the highest levels.
The decision to surrender ownership was taken by the family.
HOW TO WRITE NON-FINITE CLAUSES IN ENGLISH
The following is an exercise to train you on how to write non-finite clauses in English. 
There are two important things to remember here. First, it is always necessary to remember 
that your non-finite clauses are not full sentences, i.e., they cannot stand by themselves and 
do not express a full thought. This means you will need to complete them. Second, one 
way to train yourself on writing good sentences with non-finite clauses is to have relative 
clauses reduced into non-finite clauses, i.e. taking the relative pronoun, and turning the 
accompanying verb phrase into a non-finite clause. See the following examples:
British Medical Council Bars Doctor Who Linked Vaccine With Autism (NY Times 
headline)

Arab countries, which were led skilfully by Egypt, managed to manoeuvre the US into

(NY Times)
They were furious with the notorious pass laws governing the movement of blacks.
RELATIVE CLAUSES
Relative clauses combine two simple sentences (independent clauses) and turn them into a 
complex sentence (one is independent and the other is dependent). Relative clauses need 
relative pronouns: when (time), why (reason), who, that, whom (person), where (place), 
that (neutral), which (thing) and whose (possessive for person and thing). The use of these 
relative pronouns is a source of trouble when writing English. The problems are related to 
•	 the writer’s inability to distinguish between the conditions under which relative 
pronouns are to be used (see Chapter 11)
•	 the writer’s inability to distinguish the type of connection relative pronouns have 
with their antecedents, i.e. the noun they refer to (see Chapter 4)
•	 the writer’s inability to form what we call reduced relative clauses in which the 
presence of a relative pronoun and some other elements are omitted (see above)
•	 the inability to distinguish between human (who, whom), non-human (which), or 
neutral (that) pronouns (see Chapter 11)
•	 the inability to see the difference between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative 
clauses. (See below)

12.7.1	RESTRICTIVE AND NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSES
A distinction between restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses in English is necessary in writing. 
Both types of clauses, referred to sometimes as essential clauses and nonessential clauses, 
provide additional information about a word or a phrase in the sentence. Grammar books 
dwell at length with the differences between them. For the purposes of this book it is 
sufficient to note that restrictive clauses cannot be removed without changing the meaning 
of the sentence. They restrict the meaning of the word or phrase they explain. Nonrestrictive 
clauses, however, can be removed without changing the basic meaning of the sentence. Note 
the following two sentences.
1.	Assessing a travel site that competes with the big boys. (NY Times) 
2.	Vancouver, which was eliminated by Chicago in the last two years, can close out 
the series Tuesday. (NY Times)

The clause starting with that in the first sentence is restrictive. It is essential to the meaning 
of the sentence. The which clause in the second sentence is set off from the rest of the 
sentence by commas. It is nonrestrictive. The information it provides is not essential to the 
meaning of the sentence as it explains and adds further information to the main subject 
Vancouver. Because many English language learners, including native speakers, find it difficult 
to make the distinction, influential style guides, such as APA (Publication manual of the 
American Psychology Association), call on authors to reserve that for restrictive clauses and 
which for nonrestrictive clauses. Consistent use of restrictive and nonrestrictive phrases and 
clauses will help you produce a clear and precise copy.
12.7.2	RESTRICTIVE AND NONRESTRICTIVE PHRASES
The underlying concept separating between restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses also applies 
to phrases. A restrictive phrase is a word or a group of words that are essential to the 
reader’s understanding of what the author has in mind. A nonrestrictive phrase provides 
more information about something in the sentence, but the reader will not be misled if 
the information were removed. Follow the same rules of punctuation by setting off your 
nonrestrictive phrases by commas from the rest of the sentence:
1.	Award-winning drama Garrow’s Law starts shooting second series in Scotland. (BBC) 
2.	The price of US corn, or maize, as it’s known elsewhere, shot up in response to 
government efforts to turn more and more corn into ethanol fuel. (Monitor)
There are no commas separating Garrow’s Law from the rest of the sentence in 1. Without 
the words Garrow’s Law the reader would not know which work the writer refers to. Their 
presence is essential to the meaning of the sentence. In the second sentence the word maize 
provides the reader with the name of the corn and the clause provides additional information. 
The absence of the word and the clause would not change the meaning of the sentence.
Study the relative clauses in the following sentences, which are derived from mainstream 
AmE and BrE publications, bearing the above points in mind: 
The army said it no longer supported the president, who sparked protest when he tried 
to overhaul the Supreme Court. (BBC)
A nation whose pupils live in the past will have no future. (Times Online)

EXERCISE: INCOMPLETE SENTENCES
The following sentences are wrong because they are incomplete. They only include one 
dependent clause and for this reason they do not express one full thought. To have them 
completed, you will need to add an independent clause.

the role of parenthetical structures that explain the noun preceding them as is the case in

the subject, the noun, they modify still needs a predicate. The correct version exemplifies 
these points:
The requirements that cannot be fulfilled using the resources in the domain. 
The requirements that cannot be fulfilled, using the resources in the domain, are:… 
NOTE The colon after the verb means you can proceed with bullet points or a normal list
The requirements cannot be fulfilled, using the resources in the domain. 
The requirements that cannot be fulfilled, using the resources in the domain, have added 
new constraints. 
12.11 The following sentence starts with a complex sentence marker (see 12.4). Complex 
sentence markers introduce dependent clauses, which cannot be treated as complete sentences 
unless they are accompanied by an independent clause:
While working on the project too hard. 
While working on the project too hard, the engineers made a new discovery. 
The engineers made a new discovery while working on the project too hard. 
12.12 The use of complex sentence markers (see 12.4), with their dependent clauses as 
complete sentences, is one of the major pitfalls learners may fall into when writing English. 
Here are more examples of how the writers of the following dependent clauses have ended 
their sentences with a period, mistakenly believing that they have a complete sentence. The 
correct versions exemplify that dependent clauses like these only become full sentences when 
supplemented by an independent clause:
Though econometric test has shown that regional wage differences do not tell the whole 
story (McCann, 2001). 
Though econometric tests have shown that regional wage differences do not tell the whole 
story (McCann, 2001), family-owned firms in the region have reported two-digit 
growth figures. 

EXERCISE: AWKWARD SENTENCES
This exercise deals with sentences which are hard to read. I call them ‘awkward’ sentences 
because readers find them ambiguous and difficult to read. There is more than one reason 
why many learners are fond of writing difficult and awkward sentences. Some learners love 
long sentences with several clauses. There are others who prefer the type of sentence structure 
that differs from the normal English sentence structure of subject + predicate. 
I have tried to avoid mother tongue interference in this book since this is a subject which 
English language teaching scholars have almost exhausted. An ‘awkward’ sentence does not 
mean it is wrong. It might be acceptable from the grammatical viewpoint but it is difficult 
to tell what it means, or it takes a lot of effort to find out what the author wants to say. 
The samples below are not easy to read for the reasons mentioned above. The suggested 
correct versions and the explanations preceding each sample are part of an effort to advise 
readers how to write a sentence that is easy to read and grasp from the perspective of both 
grammar and meaning.
12.13 The following sentence is a classic example of an awkward sentence in English. It is 
repetitive. For instance that is mentioned four times and study twice. Note also the use 
of redundant phrases or clauses That it was not the question, it was the fact that it was, 
etc. (See 13.1):
That it was not a question of a traditional organization that was regarded as important 
phenomena in this study, on the contrary it was the fact that it was a project of inter-
organizational relationship that was seen as an interesting phenomenon as a study object. 
This study sees inter-organizational relationship as an interesting phenomenon and not 
the traditional organization. 
12.14 Try to avoid convoluted sentences like this one:
In inter-organizational learning it is not where individual learning activities that are in 
focus, even if learning always starts and ends with individuals. 
12.15 In sentences like this one place the comparative form of the adjective clearer at 
the end:
This is done to make clearer a comparison. 
This is done to make the comparison clearer. 
This is done to clarify the comparison. 

12.16 The use of active voice instead of passive is recommended in sentences such as the 
following:
In Table 3.1 the description of the variables is presented. 
Table 3.1 describes the variables. 
12.17 Prepositional phrases, if not modifying head nouns, are mobile, i.e. we can have them 
at the beginning, the middle or the end of the sentence. Their presence at the beginning of 
the sentence is mainly to draw readers’ attention and focus: In the church, the priest rarely 
raised his voice. The prepositional phrase says that most probably the priest would raise his 
voice in places other than the church. But that is not the case with the following sentence:
For this type of study is the construct validity of special interest. 
The validity of construct is of special interest for this type of study. 
For this type of study, it is the validity of construct that is of special interest. 

The political dimension is very important in peacekeeping operations as it strongly 
affects all the phases in the relation model. 
12.18 It is not wrong to start a sentence with an adjective provided that it reads well and it 
is not convoluted like this one. However, many today view such structures as rather archaic. 
The passive construction as suggested by Holgersson makes reading rather difficult:
Necessary for such an approach would be to develop a system where biologists rank the 
environments as suggested by Holgersson (2007). 

value of equity was Claessens et al (2002). 

12.20 The paragraph below is wordy. It has 57 words. Compare it with the correct version: 
The role of dividends in agency context is then further classified by La Porta et al. (2000b) 
according to two main views. The first type of agency models regards dividends policy as 
an outcome of agency problems and the legal protection of shareholders. The second type 
regards dividend policy as a substitute for legal protection of shareholders. 
La Porta et al. (2000b) further divide the role of dividend in agency context into two 
main types: dividend policy as an outcome of agency problems and the legal protection 
of shareholders, and dividend policy as a substitute for legal protection of shareholders. 
12.21 It is not wrong to start your sentence with that as a complex sentence marker 
(see 12.4). If you do, please try to make sure that you do not end up with a convoluted 
structure like the following:
That dividend payout decreases with the voting power of the largest shareholder is shown 
by Gugler and Yurtoglu (2003), on a sample of German firms. 
Gugler and Yurtoglu (2003), relying on a sample of German firms, show that dividend 
payout decreases with the voting power of the largest shareholder. 
12.22 A straightforward English sentence of subject + verb + object (see 12.1) will dispel

ideals, it can be hampered by the parents being good examples. 
Good parents can offer the example that will hamper the rising numbers of broken families 
lacking positive ideals. 
12.23 The following sentence is short but again a bit hard to read. We do not know what

12.24 The following sentence, though short, is still hard to read. Note the pronoun it, which 
gives the impression that its antecedent might not be the letter. Pronouns are usually placed 
a bit far away from their referents in the same sentence in English (see Chapter 11). Also 
note, industrial utveckling. Occasionally, some writers use English words and phrases when 
speaking or writing in their native tongues. That is quite alright as far as understanding goes 
if the expectation is that the majority of readers understand English. But inserting foreign 
words and phrases in your English text without translation is a totally different matter:
In the letter from the dean it says that Staffan Laes should be evaluated as professor in 
the subject area “industrial utveckling.” 
In his letter, the dean says that Staffan Laes should be evaluated for professorship in the 
subject area of “industrial development.” 
12.25 You will make the sentence easier to read if you change the passive (in bold) into 
active. Change the agent Linell into subject and rewrite:

Linell (1998), among others, criticizes studying speech acts out of their context. 

12.26 A subject in a sentence can be one noun or a noun phrase that may include other 
parts of speech as well as phrases and clauses. Long subjects like the one in the following 
sentence (identified in bold) make your text rather awkward and hard to read. The use of 
the passive voice at the end of the sentence is another source of awkwardness:
The move from external to internal mediation, that is a society where nothing separates 
men from each other so that they are exposed to direct competition, is also discussed 
by Alexis de Tocqueville in his Democracy in America. 
Alexis de Tocqueville in his Democracy in America discusses the move from external to 
internal mediation, a society where nothing separates men from each other when exposed

12.27 The best way to make the following sentence easy to read is to divide it into two parts:
As actors themselves describe what their organizations have to offer SMEs they do recognize 
the needs and the solutions and services asked by SMEs. 
Actors describe what their organizations have to offer SMEs. At the same time, they 
recognize the needs, the solutions and the services SMEs ask for. 
12.28 The sentence below needs to be rewritten in order to get rid of its redundant parts. 
Also note the superfluous use of double inverted commas and the second mention of the 
word course:
As a matter of fact, despite the fact that entrepreneurs call for training and other “practical” 
courses, few examples of such courses were found as I asked actors engaged in activities 
related to training and education. 
According to actors engaged in training and education, there were few training courses 
although the entrepreneurs initially had asked for many more. 
12.29 There is no need for the fact that in the following sentence. The use of the passive 
at the end of the sentence with the agent by actors makes reading rather difficult:
One example of such difference is that the fact that the relationship between firms and 
banks has grown more difficult during the last few years and has been stressed more 
often by Tuscan actors than by actors in the County of Jönköping. 

Anders Ackebo says they cannot participate in the stock because of Landsbankis’ economic

12.31 The way both, the latter and the former are used makes the following sentence 
extremely hard to read (see 15.36). The author, in my opinion, should have spelled out what 
both stands for at the beginning of the sentence. Note the singular form of the verb changes 
which links our perception to the word function while what changes are components. The 
use of double inverted commas “anyone” gives us the impression that the author either has 
doubts about the findings or is not satisfied with them (see 2.15). And the last use of the 
latter adds much more to the ambiguity of the sentence:
While both are examples of suppliers the former represents components with a certain 
function that changes the value of the end product and that the supplier has developed. 
The latter represents something that is necessary for the product’s finalization although 
could be supplied by “anyone.” The subcontractors of the latter generally are not familiar 
of the customer market. 
12.32 The following sentence is extremely hard to read. It is mainly due to the way first, 
second and the latter are used:
Out of these three, Axelson and Wynstra seem to believe that the first and the second 
are commonly considered as stereotype for purchased business services while the latter, 
though common in the market, is not as commonly considered. 
12.33 It is better not to repeat the same word twice in the same sentence:
The company’s main business is similar to Trinity’s as the company mainly develops and 
produces aluminum profiles. 
Like Trinity, the company mainly develops and produces aluminum profiles. 
12.34 I suggest that you get rid of the second mention of the word products:

12.37 The following is a sentence which is hard to read. The reason is due to the way but 
also…and the relative clause starting with which are used:
The syllabus for each program gives a description of its program content, but also the 
objectives for personal development of the student, which is addressed too in the vision 
document. 
The syllabus describes the content and objectives of each course as outlined in the vision 
document. 
12.38 Are there two courses or one course? In fact there is one, although the following 
sentence might give the impression that there are two. Also, try to be careful with the use 
of expressions of time, such as this autumn term. If the year is not specified, it could mean 
the autumn of any other year, and that is not possible of course:
This autumn term we are offering for the first time a course as pure e-learning course, 
Business English Online. 
This year (2010), we offer for the first time a business English online course in autumn. 
12.39 Pay attention to expressions referring to time when you write. Make sure you as a 
writer can tell the time frame these expressions refer to. It is not so in the following:
In the last few years and the year to come we have had (or will have) 20 doctoral students. 
We hope to have 20 doctoral students by 2011. 
12.40 The shorter your non-finite clauses are the better (see 12.5). You can always resort 
to the normal English sentence structure of subject + verb + object (see 12.1).

committees in School Student Association called the Quality committee. 

12.41 There are so many elements in this sentence that are redundant. The sentence is also 
awkward and hard to read. Also note the wrong use of he or she which the author employs 
to refer backward to the plural noun candidates: 
The design of the post-graduate education is to some extent fixed but since the doctoral 
candidates are supposed to create a plan for their time as doctoral candidates, (most of 
all doctoral candidates have written plan), he or she is contributing to the design and 
development of the program. 
The design of post-graduate education is to some extent fixed. Doctoral candidates are 
required to write a plan on how to spend their research time. 
12.42 The following is another sentence, which can be described as convoluted. This is 
due mainly to verbosity, represented in the use of the passive construction and the relative 
clause, which repeats what the sentence says earlier:
The development of the research activities at the school has been supported by the 
contract with the Government, which resulted in considerable research resources from 
the Government. 
Under the contract, the school has received substantial funds from the government for 
research. 
12.43 Do not repeat the same structure twice unless it is a term or an expression you think 
is difficult for your readers to grasp if replaced by something else. The part written in bold 
in the following sentence is superfluous:
We have about 25 universities and university colleges run by the Government, which means 
that their governance structure is regulated and controlled by the government. 
The government runs 25 universities and university colleges. 
12.44 The sentence below would read better if the passive were changed into the active voice:
In table 2-7 the working status a few months after earning the degree is shown. 
Table 2.7 shows the students’ employment status a few months after graduating. 
12.45 Here is another example of a passive sentence which would read better if turned 
into active:
In table 2-9 the time to find the first job for the 1998 graduates are presented. 
Table 2.9 presents the time it took 1998 graduates to find their first jobs. 

spell out the number at the beginning of your sentence or, if necessary, recast the sentence:

Twenty years later, the map has been redrawn. (NY Times)
43 Ph.D. candidates joined the course last year. 
Last year 43 Ph.D. candidates joined the course. 
53 out of 57 of those accepted as a PhD candidate at the university have a full-time 
employment at the university as a PhD candidate. 
Of the 57 Ph.D. students, 53 have full-time jobs at the university. 
NOTE Note: The sentence starting with 53 above is wordy and verbose. It has 25 words with 
phrases ‘PhD candidate’ and ‘at the university’ repeated twice. The suggested correct 
version has 12 words. By the way, you can start your headline with a number in English:

12.48 This paragraph is a good example of verbosity. There are so many things which can 
be deleted without having an impact on what the writer wants to say. It is 125 words. The

need to realize that our readers can be as intelligent as we are
In order to aid the readers’ understanding of this thesis and its results, this chapter explains 
how the forthcoming studies were conducted and further describes the logic behind 
their design. Focus in the chapter lies on explaining how the studies were conducted in 
practice and discussing how they might be evaluated. Although the below description 
can be interpreted as a picture of a chronological process this is not the case. The writing 
of this thesis was an interactive process where theory as well as study developed during

and the conclusions and suggestions presented in the final chapter were not only drawn 
during the final weeks of the process. 

discussions in the seminar. 
12.51 Starting a sentence with a subject + verb will certainly make it easier to read. Starting 
a sentence with a that clause makes it rather hard to read:

Coherence
13	 COHERENCE
It is very important that the ideas you express in any kind of writing are logically linked. 
Logical sequence is at the center of written communication in various fields of knowledge. 
Journalists, web writers and academics are required to exhibit a high degree of coherence 
in the articles, reports, dissertations and books they produce.
As a writer, you need to structure your ideas into clear and logical units as far as possible. 
You are required to show coherence at least at two levels – layout and meaning.
Layout is the shape or appearance of your writing. Writers pay a lot of attention to layout. 
Various publishing houses have devised their own techniques and principles. I hope that 
your study of the samples I have taken from mainstream BrE and AmE publications as 
illustrations in this book has by now made you aware of the difference, for instance, in the 
shape of headlines between the BBC and The New York Times.
We determine the limit of a sentence by punctuation symbols. Sentences are combined into 
paragraphs whose beginning is signaled by indentation or an empty line. A group of related 
paragraphs can be divided into sections and marked by subheadings and other indicators.
But it is coherence at the level of semantics or meaning that matters. It does not take a lot 
of effort to achieve coherence when it comes to layout. The organization and unity of ideas 
into coherent and logical segments is usually hard for beginners to grasp.
LEAD OR TOPIC SENTENCE
To achieve coherence at the level of meaning, your sentences, paragraphs and even headlines 
and subheadings have to be logically related to each other. Good writers usually start with 
a topic sentence, lead or a controlling paragraph. Each paragraph develops one of the 
elements in the topic sentence or the first paragraph. You might have noticed, for instance, 
that for the BBC a paragraph is one sentence and that for The New York Times a paragraph 
could be one or more sentences. Academics use longer paragraphs, each comprising several 
sentences. But the concept is almost the same – the paragraph exhibits unity of thought, 
tackling one main idea or topic. 
While the lead or topic sentence steers the flow of meaning in newspapers, academics control 
the logical sequence of their texts by a controlling paragraph, which states the theme or 
the main idea around which the whole essay evolves.

Coherence
The topic sentence or controlling paragraph is developed by other sentences, generally 
referred to as supporting material. Each paragraph in this kind of writing hinges on one 
main idea, controlled by a topic sentence. It is important that the writer, relying on 
semantic and linguistic devices, shows that the topic sentence or the controlling paragraph 
is sufficiently developed.
HOW TO LINK SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS
There are at least two different ways to link sentences within one paragraph and the 
paragraphs with each other as part of a larger piece of writing. Besides, there are many 
devices which writers can use to achieve a coherent and logical transition between sentences 
in one paragraph or between paragraphs within an article or essay. 
The logical transition between sentences and paragraphs can be implicit or explicit. In 
implicit transition the linking device is not stated clearly – it is hidden or implied. Note 
the following examples:
•	 The train was late. Therefore, they missed the meeting.
•	 The train was late. Thus, they missed the meeting.
•	 Because the train was late, they missed the meeting.
•	 The train was late. They missed the meeting.
The four sentences above express the same thing. But in the first three the logical connection 
is explicitly expressed by therefore, thus and because. In the fourth, there is no transitional 
device. The connection is implicit and understood from the context. In English, we prefer 
to go without a transitional device, if logical connection is understood from the context. 
But this method is usually beyond the grasp of inexperienced writers. I have noticed that 
many learners, when writing English, overuse these devices. 
There is nothing wrong with explicit transition, which is achieved through transitional 
devices. Only their excessive and unnecessary use in English makes them sound weird. You 
can always rely on explicit transitional devices. Used in the right place, they function as 
road signs, helping the reader to follow and pursue the text with ease. 
Here is a summary of these explicit transitional devices. It is important that you employ 
them properly in your writing. Without them, it is difficult to achieve the coherence and 
the logical sequence of ideas – so essential in today’s writing.

TRANSITIONAL DEVICES
Writers rely on a range of transitional devices to link their sentences and paragraphs in a 
logical and coherent way. These include:
TRANSITIONAL WORDS AND PHRASES
The English language has many words that can be used as indicators to fit a piece of writing 
together. Grammarians discuss these words and phrases at length and provide plenty of 
examples. They also divide them into groups to show what kind of link they can achieve. 
Some style writers call these words and phrases “link words”. Their typical position is usually 
at the beginning of a sentence but that is not compulsory. 
A word of warning! Do not overuse these words. Use them only when appropriate. Check 
your text and take them away if you see their removal would not affect their transitional 
function. As I said earlier, foreign learners writing English are often fond of overdoing their 
use. Not every sentence or paragraph should start with one of them. If you have too many 
of them in a text, it will look like the presence of too many signposts on a road, making 
it too difficult for drivers to follow. Transitional words and phrases in English are of the 
following types:

The Use of Synonyms
Synonyms can be used as substitutes for words with more or less the same meaning. If you 
are writing about a decrease in industrial output, as the BBC does in the following extract, 
you may want to use different words referring to the action of decreasing, on condition 
that these words fall within the same semantic field:
Surprise dip in UK’s industrial output (headline)
UK industrial output fell unexpectedly in April, but economists have said the figures 
should not be a cause for concern. 
Output fell by 0.4% compared with March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, 
whereas a rise of 0.4% had been forecast. 
It was the first fall in monthly production since January.
Experts said the drop should be seen as a correction after a particularly strong jump in 
output in March of 2%.

Coherence
Repetition
Writers may repeat an idea expressed by one particular word several times in their writing 
for the sake of coherence and logical sequence. But when they repeat they often try to use 
different words and expressions. This has become a powerful writing tool. When it comes 
to the repetition of words through the use of pronouns or determiners, try to make sure 
that the lexical item you choose clearly identifies the noun it refers to:
The dollar rose in early trading today against major currencies among them the pound. 
Yesterday, it hit a low not seen since September.
Stocks firmed despite analysts’ predictions that commodity-producing countries, 
particularly crude producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran were to raise output. The 
former had made clear that the latter would benefit.
An Italian architect got his due in Madrid last week. The architect, Andrea Palladio, is 
seen by many as the inventor of the modern villa.
(BBC)
THE USE OF STYLE GUIDES
Many institutions, journals and media outlets have their own guides to authors. These 
guides advise authors on how certain words are to be written, policies on confused spelling, 
transliterating, formatting, referencing, sourcing, etc. You will need to meet the conditions 
your institution or the outlet you are writing for sets for the way your material is to be 
presented. Some prestigious universities have well-formulated electronic guidelines for 
academic writing. Good guidelines include suggestions that may help you solve some stylistic 
problems like the ones discussed in this book.
HOW TO START
Good writers are the ones who startle and engage their readers from the very first few sentences. 
In the middle of the story or article, they should widen or deepen readers’ knowledge of 
the topic. Readers also expect the writers to give a sensation of a completed statement.
The three steps outlined above are important for both online and print writing. Writers try 
their best to have them in their articles. But how many of them succeed?

Coherence
As a writer, you have always to remember that you are not writing for yourself. If you write 
an article and find it interesting, lucid and easy to understand, do not expect your readers 
to come up with the same opinion. It always takes at least two pairs of eyes to judge how 
significant and important a piece of writing is.
And because your readers are the ones who will have the final say, you are required to do 
your utmost to make them happy. In addition to the three criteria mentioned above, there 
are other important principles, which you will need to adhere to as you move from your 
introduction to the body and conclusion of your article.
The first is accuracy. If you get a fact wrong, misspell a name or omit a vital piece of 
information, you will damage the credibility of the institution you are working for. And 
without credibility, a newspaper, a web site, an institution or a writer is finished.
The second is clarity. Newspaper and online articles meant to inform are different from 
academic or scientific writing, which is known for its complexity. But as a writer, whether 
writing a newspaper article, a composition, an essay, a scholarly paper or a dissertation, you 
do not need to use big words and long sentences to show your readers how smart you are. 
You have to give them the information quickly, concisely and without a lot of extra words, 
embedded phrases and clauses.
The third principle is style. Good writers are artists. Never forget that your number one 
objective is to tell people what they need to know. Your job is not to show them how much 
of a literary artist you are.
WRITING GUIDELINES
The following guidelines are important. If you use them, your writing will be clear and 
lucid, void of ambiguous words, phrases, clauses and other structures. The basis is to help 
the reader understand what you want to say, without having to look up so many words in 
a dictionary and spending a lot of time trying to find out what you want to say.
Sentence Structure
Good sentence structure is fundamental for good writing. For many writers it means simple 
construction: subject + predicate (verb, object, complement, adverb). Do not separate 
these five elements by a lot of parenthetical phrases and clauses. They usually delay and 
confuse meaning.

Sentence Length
Try to divide your paragraphs notionally and not haphazardly. This means that each paragraph 
should express one of the themes you want to explain to your readers. There are no strict 
rules for how long a paragraph should be. But it is always better to show your reader that 
moving from one paragraph to another is a signal in the movement of notions and different 
ideas you want to convey. Keep your sentences short. Often you may need less than 25 
words for a sentence. To grab readers’ attention, good writers occasionally break up their 
complex sentences into simple and short ones of an average of five words each.
One Idea per Sentence
The reader will be able to follow what you say if each of your sentences deals with one 
idea. Having two or more ideas in one sentence makes comprehension difficult and time 
consuming. It is a major source of ambiguity (see 12.1–12.7).

Commas and Other Punctuation
I have found many of my students to be very fond of punctuation marks, particularly 
commas, brackets, hyphens and inverted commas. A good remedial exercise is to try writing 
a story with no commas. That, of course, means sentences should be short. Research shows 
that up to 25-word sentences are fairly clear to most readers. If you do not want to count 
the number of words in your sentences, employ the following easy test. A sentence is too 
long if you cannot read it aloud without taking a breath.
Abbreviations 
Some abbreviations are common and in some cases more popular than the names they 
stand for. Others are highly restricted and only understood by the limited circle of those 
with knowledge of the subject. These you need to avoid and if you think it is necessary to 
include them, spell them out. Do not take it for granted that readers will understand the 
abbreviations common in your area of specialization (see Chapter 6).
Active Voice
Passive voice sounds dignified, but readers understand active voice more quickly. The passive 
voice can also be a source of ambiguity unless the writer clearly specifies the agent or the doer. 
Jargon and Difficult Words
Jargon includes the specialized and technical words of a profession or trade. The special words 
and phrases you use to refer to your area of specialization are a good example. The danger 
is when you assume that everybody understands what these words mean. That is not true.
Do not look for words which are difficult to understand. Do not try to show the reader the 
extent of your vocabulary. Readers are not interested in the number of words you know. 
They want to understand what you want to say. Try to replace your long and difficult words 
with shorter and simpler ones.
Pre- and Post-Modifiers
Adjectives describe nouns but you should never try to overuse them. One adjective of the 
same category or grade is sufficient. Also, try to limit the number of prepositional phrases 
following the head noun in any one sentence to not more than two.

Quotations
The best quotations are the ones which are short and bright. They surprise, shock or amuse. 
They reveal insights or secrets. They prove points. They allow experts to give perspectives, 
and real people to air grievances. Do not quote simple statements of fact (see Chapter 2).
When quoting, avoid saying the same thing twice. Do not include a lot of parenthetical 
information in your quotations. Partial quotations are not recommended unless mentioned 
in full later in the text.
When quoting or paraphrasing, you should mention the source and follow the rules specified 
in the style sheet of the institution, journal, publishing house or outlet you are writing for. 
When it comes to actual writing, experts agree that overuse of quotations is a sign of 
inexperience. Good writers are those who have developed the skill of paraphrasing and a 
sense for the good quotation (see Chapter 2).
Contractions
Contractions are short forms of words, e.g., he’s which may be a contraction of he is or he 
has. Contractions were usually used in spoken English and not in formal written English. 
However, written English is becoming more and more informal, i.e. much closer to spoken 
English. The New York Times, for instance, uses contractions frequently on its pages. 
Nonetheless, you are advised not to use contractions in academic writing unless you are 
quoting. Here is a list of the most frequent contractions in English:

DRAWING LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS
In drawing logical conclusions, we often pay little attention to whether the statements we 
accept as true are reasonable or sensible. This is because we depend entirely upon the form 
of the statements and not upon what we are talking about. Thus, it is quite acceptable to 
draw a logical conclusion without using a conclusion indicator, e.g. therefore, hence, thus, 
consequently, it follows that, one may infer, one may conclude.
Consider the two statements:
Students at Stockholm University are sent abroad for study.
Eva studies at Stockholm University.
Common sense tells us that if we accept these two statements as true, then we must accept 
the following third statement as true:
Eva will go abroad for study.
Logical conclusions might be implicit. If so, you can draw your conclusion without using 
any of the indicators referring to them.
Consider the statements:
Temperatures have dropped drastically in North America. 
Oil-producing countries have slashed output.
Common sense here tells us that if the two statements are true, then we must accept the 
following sentence as true:
There has been a sharp rise in fuel prices.
Lack of Coherence
It will be difficult for readers to follow along easily when sentences, ideas and details do 
not fit together. In coherent writing, ideas tie together smoothly and clearly.
To establish the links to help readers follow your ideas, you will need to employ the following: 
(a) repetition of a key term or phrase (see p. 150), (b) synonyms (see p. 150), (c) pronouns 
(see Chapter 11), (d) transitional words (see p. 143) and (e) repeated or parallel sentence 
pattern (see p. 150).
Lack of coherence occurs mostly when we as writers fail to reason properly.

Errors of Reasoning
An error of reasoning occurs when a statement is not logical. A statement exhibiting an 
error of reasoning is called a fallacy. Instead of strengthening your points of view, these 
statements can be used against you. If you get familiar with them, you will be able to spot 
them in other people’s writing. Here are examples of possible errors of reasoning a writer 
might commit:
Appeal to force, e.g.
You must do the exam set for March 20, or you will have no bread and butter to eat and 
a roof to shelter.
Abusive, e.g.
Do not trust what the MPs say. The parliament is used to ranting.
Circumstantial, e.g.
Certainly we are the world’s leading institution in entrepreneurship studies.
Ignorance, e.g.
There is no proof that global warming is harmful to the environment. Therefore, there is 
no need to impose environmental controls.
Appeal to pity, e.g.
The students are poor. They have no clothes and cannot afford to buy food. Their situation 
is miserable. Please show some mercy and let them pass the exam.
Propaganda, e.g.
Get your Mercedes now or there will be no vehicle of the same standard for you to buy.
Accident, e.g.
He bought a shirt yesterday and therefore he is wearing a shirt today.

Hasty generalization, e.g.
Two of the company executives were arrested on charges of fraud. All executives are cheats.
False accusation, e.g.

teacher told her about the questions in advance.
Complex statements, e.g.
The students have given up cheating on exams.
Irrelevant statements, e.g.
In attempt to combat carjacking, the authorities have set aside a special budget for 
the Ministry of Interior. Carjacking is a horrible crime which we recommend no one 
to commit.

REDUNDANT STRUCTURES
Try to be Concise
13.1 You will certainly produce a more readable copy if you are frugal with words. You 
will increase your chances of getting your copy or manuscript accepted for publication if 
you are concise and economical with words. One way to meet the limit on the number of 
words editors impose on manuscripts is to tighten your copy by getting rid of redundant 
expressions. Economy of expression is important in English, and it means that authors must 
do their best to eliminate clumsy words, phrases and sentences, avoid the use of jargon, 
circumlocutions and overuse of the passive voice. Remember that short words and short 
sentences are always easier to understand than long ones.
There are many ways to get rid of words, phrases and even clauses whose presence in a 
piece of writing is unnecessary. Structures which we can omit without hampering the flow 
and meaning of the text are usually referred to as redundant. We tend to add extra words 
or phrases that actually add nothing to the meaning of the sentence. These words and 
phrases can be meaningful in appropriate contexts. But you need to eliminate them if their 
presence in a sentence makes your text wordy and repetitive. Here are a few examples with 
redundant structures written in bold:
I am generally willing to take any particular kind of job. 

help and assistance. 

Overuse of Expletives is not Recommended
13.2 The general meaning of an expletive is an exclamation or oath, especially one that 
is profane, vulgar or obscene. In this book, I use the term to refer to words or phrases 
that do not contribute any meaning but are added only to fill out a sentence. Here are 
some examples:
It is of paramount importance that we launch the new doctoral program. 

13.3 Active verbs convey meaning directly to the reader. Passive forms of verbs and 
nominalizations tend to make a sentence longer and the meaning is not so direct. Study 
the following examples:

by the study.

getting to the point. While circumlocutions are commonly used when speaking, try to avoid 
them as far as possible in writing:

NON-SEXIST LANGUAGE
The Word ‘man’
Not very long ago the word man carried the dual meaning of an adult human and an adult 
male. But in the course of time its meaning has changed and it is now closely identified 
with adult male. In today’s English we try to avoid the generic use of man when referring 
to both sexes. And as a result, writers are advised to employ alternatives to replace the word 
and other related expressions with masculine markers.

In English, we are obliged today to treat women in all areas of writing the way we treat 
men. Your writing in English should reflect a society that no longer assigns roles or 
occupations to men only or women only. Therefore, it is essential that you try to avoid 
physical descriptions, sexist references, demeaning stereotypes and condescending phrases, 
particularly when referring to women. For instance, your copy should not assume ‘maleness’ 
when the reference includes both sexes. In other words, we are required, when writing in 
English, to be evenhanded when treating the sexes. Our copy should be free of stereotypes 
and assumptions.
Using just he to refer to both sexes is now unacceptable in many contexts in English. 
So what should you do? There are a few tips to circumvent the problem. One solution, 
currently prevalent in AmE, is to use she and her for occupational terms, such as artist, 
musician or author, whose gender is not specified. Another solution is to use they, which 
is gender neutral. In cases where the plural is not an option and there is no other word or 
expression to neutrally refer to both sexes, use he or she, which is an alphabetical listing of 
singular pronouns in English. 
It is natural in English to use the nouns woman, man, girl and boy in reference to people. 
Avoid using male and female as nouns. If a construction warrants their presence, use them 
as adjectives. When used as adjectives, avoid affixing them to occupational titles female 
judge, male nurse in a way that implies that the occupation normally belongs to one sex. 
Today we apply tougher restrictions to he or she, him or her and his or hers, which should be 
used as a last resort. A preferred solution to avoid assumptions of maleness and femaleness 
is to resort to plural constructions. Another solution is to rewrite the sentence so that no 
pronoun is required, e.g.
A lawyer always defends his clients.
Lawyers always defend their clients.
The lawyer always defends the client.
Special care is taken today when writing English so that both sexes are treated equally. For 
example, The New York Times avoids phrases like “Hollis M. Cordero and his wife, Lynn” 
because the newspaper believes the phrase “assigns the woman unthinkingly to second rank.” 
Instead, it advises its reporters and editors to write: “Hollis and Lynn Cordero” or “Lynn 
and Hollis Cordero.”3

13.9.1 This section includes some examples which many today identify with adult male(s). 
Today’s U.S. and British newspapers provide alternatives with generic meaning. Note that 
writers and speakers try to avoid the use of man in occupational terms when persons holding 
the job could be either male or female. One way to avoid their use is to have them replaced 
by nouns which are neuter in gender, i.e. have no distinction for sex. Examples include 
people, humanity, humankind but not mankind. Here are some tips to help you avoid 
sexist language. Note that the first set is viewed as sexist in English and the second as neutral:

EXERCISE
This is a general exercise with a variety of errroneus samples. It is designed as a test to assess 
the progress you have made so far in detecting errors and correcting them:
13.10 In the following sentence, the use of the preposition of is wrong. For a better read 
you might want to change the adjective dependable into a verb:
The country’s welfare is dependable of these companies. 
The country’s welfare depends on these companies. 
13.11 The following is only a dependent clause. In English it cannot stand by itself (as a 
full sentence), and it does not express a full idea. You need to add a main clause for it to 
become a full sentence (see 12.4).
Although the government wants the taxes to remain high. 
Although the government wants the taxes to remain high, there are many in the country 
who take the opposite view. 
13.12 The word people is plural and agrees with a plural verb in English. It is also advisable 
not to repeat the same word twice in a sentence. Try to replace it with a pronoun if it is 
a noun:
The people who needs resources are the people who is in jail. 
The people who need resources are those who are in jail. 

13.13 There is a difference between effect and affect (see 14.38). There is a difference 
between their and there. But both do not fit in the context of the sentence below. And 
also note the wrong use of the possessive form Americas:
The attack on New York has effected Americas relationship with Saudi Arabia, which 
has been their ally in the Middle East. 
The attack on New York has affected America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia, which 
has been its ally in the Middle East. 
13.14 The use of 90:s is wrong. So is the inversion of subject and verb was the price and 
73$ (See 14.21):
During the Gulf War in the beginning of the 90:s was the price of oil approximately 
37$ a barrel. 
During the 1990 Gulf War, the price of oil was approximately $37 a barrel. 
13.15 The logical order of the following sentence is wrong. This is why it does not read 
well. Compare with the correct version:
The oil price dropped from approximately $25 a barrel to the lowest noted level in twelve 
year period $10 a barrel. 
The oil price dropped to $10 a barrel from approximately $25 a barrel, the lowest level 
in 12 years. 
13.16 Names of organizations are singular in English and the verb they agree with has to 
be singular. Also note that the use of the present continuous tense are controlling does 
not fit here:
One other major reason is OPEC. They are controlling the market and has in the last 
three years a very strict output policy. 
One other major reason is OPEC. It controls the market and has pursued, in the last 
three years, a very strict output policy. 
13.17 Acronyms are treated like nouns when it comes to the possessive form. Remember, 
names of countries are singular in English:
The fact undermines OPECs attempts to limit global production when Russia are in 
need of hard cash. 
The fact undermines OPEC’s attempts to limit global production when Russia is in need 
of hard cash. 

13.18 Write dates in numbers:
In ninety-sixty the price went up a couple of dollars. 
In 1960, the price went up a couple of dollars. 
13.19 Use who to refer to antecedents (nouns) that are human and which for non-human 
antecedents. Reserve this distinction only to who and which. In English we have an alternative 
relative pronoun that which can be used with both human and non-human antecedents. 
Also note that we use the before the names of countries and organizations which start with 
united in English, such as the U.S., the U.A.E, the U.K., the U.N., when they are not 
pre-modified (no adjective, noun or other elements precede them immediately): 
There is some other countries outside the OPEC who produce oil, these are for example 
US, UK, Russia and Norway. 
There are some other countries outside OPEC that produce oil. These include, for example, 
the U.S., the U.K., Russia and Norway. 

13.20 The verb learn does not need a personal pronoun whether singular or plural in the 
object form (e.g., me, you, him, her, us, them). Also note that learning as an adjective is 
only used attributively (before a noun) in English, e.g., a learning experience, but not the 
experience is learning:
The course has been relevant and learning. I have learned me a lot. 
The course has been relevant and useful. I have learned a lot. 
13.21 There are three errors in the following sentence. There is the wrong inversion of 
subject and verb are Sweden. Names of countries in English are singular and not plural. 
And the noun country has to be plural:
But today are Sweden one of the richest country in the world. 
But today Sweden is one of the richest countries in the world. 
13.22 The use of ones is wrong (see 15.42):
They spend their money at ones. 
They spend their money at once. 
13.23 Check your idioms, using the lexicon or the Internet, if in doubt. Do not confuse 
than with then. (See 3.39).
The company started on the right feet but than began to shake. 
The company started on the right foot but then it began to shake. 
13.24 The following sentence is ambiguous. It suffers from verbosity:
Entrepreneurship is defined in the broad sense of the concept, meaning the creation of 
new economic activities as well as renewal of old ones. 
Broadly defined, entrepreneurship is the creation of new economic activities and the 
renewal of old ones. 
13.25 The following is a convoluted sentence in which information is not presented in a 
straightforward manner:
Four major research programs being focused on will present the research within Business 
Administration. 
Business administration research focuses on four major programs. 

13.26The following sentence suffers from redundancy. There are more words than necessary 
to express the thought:
A fact that can be seen as a little disappointing is that it is relatively few of our students 
have started their own firms, and, furthermore, this fraction seems to be diminishing. 
It is disappointing to see fewer students starting their own firms. 
13.27 Do not use the same word more than once in one sentence:
This means that the new programmes very quickly became international programmes 
instead of regional programmes. 
This means that the new programmes quickly assumed an international instead of a 
regional character. 
13.28 The passive voice makes this sentence a bit difficult to read:
About a third of graduated students have been employed by the Tax authorities. 
The Tax Department employs about one third of our graduates. 
13.29 In the following it is very difficult to tell which courses the writer is talking about 
and whether they deal with the teaching of the English language or if their medium of 
instruction is English. To produce a correct version, I had to break it down into three 
sentences. To clarify the ambiguity about the number of courses in each category, I had to 
resort to a calculator: 
First, most (45) of our courses in English are advanced courses while only 18 are 
intermediate courses and 15 are introductory courses of which seven of these introductory 
courses are for language courses. 
We have 45 courses, and most of them are given in English. Of these 12 are advanced, 
18 intermediate and 15 introductory. Of the introductory courses, seven are language 
courses. 
13.30 There is redundancy and unnecessary repetition in the following:
The family models are developed for the perspective of developers and configuration 
management staff. The family models are thus not intended to portray end-users. 
The family models are designed for developers and configuration staff. They are not 
intended to portray end users. 

13.31 The following is another example of a long sentence that is extremely hard to read:
One thought behind the design of the doctoral program was that the doctoral candidates 
should have a chance to developing his or her skills gradually, by combining teaching, 
courses, writing the doctoral dissertation. 
The program gives doctoral candidates the chance to develop their skills gradually by 
teaching different courses besides their research studies. 
13.32 It is possible to turn the names of the days of the week and the months of the year 
into plural in English. For example, I work on Sundays, means I do that every Sunday. 
But in the following sentence, Sundays is wrong. It should be in the possessive form: 
I am concerned about Sundays referendum. 
I am concerned about Sunday’s referendum. 

13.33 Always try to make sure that you as a writer can tell which items or things your 
pronouns stand for, particularly words such as the latter and the former. If it is not clear to 
you, how on earth could you expect your readers to find out on their own. In the following 
samples, it is extremely difficult to tell what exactly the latter refers to (see 15.36):
Some of the communication media in use are manually attended by the users (customers), 
interacting directly with an information system, without any intervention from employees. 
The latter, the self-service technologies (Meuter et al., 2000) are very cost effective from 
a company perspective. 
A few weeks later, the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia opened. The latter had 
been called for by the old congress solely to rectify some problems with the Articles of 
Confederation. 
But what is of particular interest is the introduction of a third character: Mr. Van rough. 
The latter, dimple and may represent three dominating masculine archetypal selves 
available at the turn of the 18th century. 
Through the media, although having no real economic relevance for the lower middle 
classes, it slowly permeates the latter, becoming a norm dreamed, though not actually 
a norm lived. 
13.34 The following is a good example of verbosity. Remember, in academic writing you 
will need to mention the year in parenthesis to show the date Anderson and Narus’s book 
was published:
A suitable definition of trust when dealing with transparency in buyer-supplier relationships 
is definition of trust as outlined by Anderson and Narus. 
Anderson and Narus (2008) provide a suitable definition of trust when dealing with 
transparency in buyer-supplier relationships. 
13.35 The following sentence is incomplete. You need an independent clause, expressing a 
full thought to supplement the dependent clause starting with the complex sentence marker 
Because (see 12.4). There is also a difference between there, which is an adverbial and their 
which is a possessive pronoun: 
Because of the large subsidies these countries give to there farmers. 
Because of the large subsidies these countries give to their farmers, agricultural produce 
has soared in Europe. 
Agricultural produce has soared in Europe because of the large subsidies European 
states give to their farmers. 

13.36 As well as is a complex sentence marker (see 12.4) and initiates a dependent clause,

clause in order to have an appropriate sentence in English:
As well as the fashion clothes and meat which are imported from abroad. 
As well as the fashion clothes and meat, the country imports huge quantities of 
vegetables and cereals. 
13.37 The plural possessive pronoun their does not fit in the following sentence because 
the referent department preceding it is singular:
Each department has the responsibility for the quality of the education within their 
field of competence. 
Each department has the responsibility for the quality of the education within its field 
of competence. 
13.38 The following is a paraphrase but it is not done properly. It is also difficult to identify 
the source or subject of the paraphrase. The use of the latter is wrong, too:
Inquired about the existence of an oil trust headed by Rockefeller in 1888, the latter 
answered in the negative, although it was perfectly known he was involved. 
Asked about the oil trust, Rockefeller – who headed the trust in 1888 – said he knew 
nothing about it. 
13.39 The verb range does not agree with the subject, which is the head of the noun 
phrase involvement:
The actual involvement of institutional investors in the firms operations range from the 
threat of selling shares to the active use of voting rights. 
The actual involvement of institutional investors in firms’ operations ranges from the 
threat of selling shares to the active use of voting rights. 
13.40 The following is another example of an incomplete sentence. The relative clause 
starting with who are modifies the subject shareholders. The subject needs a predicate to 
form a complete sentence:
Shareholders who are not actively involved on a day to day basis in the control or 
management of the firms’ resources. 
Shareholders who are not actively involved on a day-to-day basis in the control or 
management of the firms’ resources get better deals. 

study accordingly. 
Below I describe these items and discuss them to enhance the study. 
13.42 The same noun is mentioned twice in the same sentence. Try to avoid structures like 
(S)he (see p. 165). And his/her is inappropriate in this context:
The confusion between these concepts is perhaps even clearer within the field of 
ergonomics where the particular subject of study and change is the participant or the 
work of the participant. (S)he of course represents master in his/her own work. 
The confusion between these concepts is perhaps even clearer within the field of

14	 CONTENT WORDS
Any piece of language, whether written or spoken, consists of words. There are different 
classes or kinds of words in English. In this chapter, we are not very much concerned about 
how authoritative English grammar books explain these classes and how many they are. 
Our main concern is how to help learners of English to, first, be aware of the errors they 
make when using certain words in English and, second, give them some information and 
ideas on how to address those errors. 
It is sufficient for the purposes of this book to divide words in English into two major 
kinds or classes: content words, such as nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, and function 
words which include classes such as determiners, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, 
auxiliary verbs, numerals and discourse markers. Examples of the two kinds of words we 
have identified here are easy to find in grammar books of English or through simple searches 
on the Internet. 
There are two chapters in this book specifically tackling the problems one might come across 
when choosing the right English word: content words and friendly words. This chapter 
deals with vocabulary, and mainly content words. I will try to give some explanation before 
each erroneous use as well as citations, when necessary, from mainstream U.S. and British 
publications of how the word is used today in order to help readers produce correct versions 
on their own. 
EXERCISE
Here are some samples of the most frequent vocabulary errors you might make when writing 
English. Go over them carefully, using the tips given before each erroneous instance as a 
tool for correction before reading my correct versions:
14.1 The error in the following sentence might be due to negligence on the part of the 
writer. In English, we generally use the same form of the content word, in this case an 
adverb, in sequences combined by connectors such as and:
Indeed, this chapter shows that acting socially and responsible should not mean just 
having… 

The word has three forms in English: responsible, responsibly and responsibility. Their 
use, the way they function in phrases, or clauses is worthy of attention. Examine the 
following examples:
responsible adj.
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites. (BBC)
Should banks be more responsible? (BBC)
Russia has welcomed the responsible outcome of an EU crisis summit. (BBC)
responsibly adv. 
The site also lets you know how we manage our business responsibly. (BBC)
responsibility n. 
Corporate responsibility is about working better for our stakeholders. (BBC)
14.2 You will need to distinguish between away, which we mainly use for distance, and 
apart, which we generally use to mean that two persons or things are separated:
They are living apart 200 km. 
They live apart and are 200 km away. 

14.3 Beware of exclamations from your mother tongue creeping into English. The exclamation 
Euuu does not sound English. Perhaps the writer means um (umm). Exclamations are the 
sounds which people make when hesitating or do not know what to say next, e.g. Oh! Ugh! 
Wow! Certain adjectives and nouns can be exclamations, e.g. Excellent! (How) wonderful! 
(how) good (nice) of you! Good! Marvelous! Splendid! Heavens! Good Lord! Jesus Christ! My 
God! Others can be dependent clauses such as: How great it was to see the film! Doesn’t that

It is important to study the overall market setting. 
14.5 The -ing (dominating) and -ed (dominated) forms of verbs can function as adjectives 
in English. But not all verbs have that capacity, and both forms can generate different 
meanings. For instance, a dominated market is the market that is dominated and an 
investor-dominated market is the market that is dominated by investors (please note the 
position of the hyphen in the last example (see Chapter 7 for further details). A dominating 
market or a dominant market is the market that dominates. You may generalize with other 
verbs with such capacity in English. Try to see whether dominated fits in the example below: 
The family has a dominated market share in the company. 
The family has a dominant market share in the company. 
14.6 For the sake of clarity try not to vacillate between the singular and plural form of 
the same word when you want to refer to the same thing. Also, try not to repeat the same 
word more than once in the same sentence. The use of the plural and singular forms of 
customer and supplier and their repetition makes the following sentence very hard to read:
The argument is that for information about cost structure is that since customers and 
suppliers often are interdependent in the short run, the customer wants low prices but 
not lower than what enables the supplier to continue with deliveries. 
Customers and suppliers often are interdependent in the short run. The former want low 
prices but not to the extent that makes it difficult for the latter to continue deliveries. 

14.7 The use of the singular and plural forms of the same word in the following sentence 
leads to ambiguity. Note the phrase between the square brackets where the singular form of 
customer does not agree with the preceding pronoun their. Also, there is no justification 
for the uppercase in the two words between the brackets:
Even if we never stopped their [The Customer’s] production, we did not handle the 
situation in an optimal way. 
Although we never disrupted their (customers’) supplies, we did not handle the situation 
in an optimal way. 
We never disrupted customers’ supplies. However, we did not handle the situation in 
an optimal way. 
14.8 Note that other than can also be used to mean except. At the same time you will 
need to distinguish between except and accept, which fall in the category of ‘friendly words’ 
(see Chapter 15): 
It is impossible to isolate all other factors than those learned that did have an effect on 
the fact that something had happened or did happen. 
It is impossible to isolate all factors other than (except) those with an effect on what has 
happened. 
14.9 When trying to produce a better version of the following, remember our advice of 
not repeating the same word twice in the same sentence as far as possible:
All participants except participants from two companies showed that they appreciated 
working with other in a project. 
The participants appreciated working with others except (other than) those from the 
two companies. 
14.10 You will need to distinguish between cooperation (working together) and corporation 
(a large business company):
Almost all the cooperations are based on products that are running as projects. 
Almost all the corporations are project-run and product-based. 
14.11 There are several words in English which are pronounced the same way but written 
differently. And weather and whether are a good example (see Chapter 3):

14.12 There are some words whose meaning is one thing when singular and something 
else when plural, and detail (a small fact or feature as a countable noun) and details 
(information about something) are a good example. Mind you, detail can also be used as 
a verb in English, e.g. It details how US government agencies can request access to customer 
data (BBC). Rewrite the following, correcting the erroneous use of detail and making other 
necessary changes: 
The situation that occurs is that during the cooperation the buyer also expects the cost 
of detail to be reduced with the cost that is presented. 
During the deliberations (talks), the buyer also expects the cost of a detail to be reduced 
as part of the cost package. 
14.13 It is not advisable to use a stroke or slash (/) to separate words. There are two slashes 
in the sentence below, which is already a bit long (42 words): 
The costing situations have been classified in the following categories in the figure below. 
The costing situations are following the product/project but also situations that are a part

14.14 Phrasal verbs, verbs + particles, have become very important in current English usage. 
Today, we have dictionaries specifically compiled to explain their meanings and functions 
in the English language. One important thing for you to know is that when phrasal verbs 
are used as nouns, they are mostly written as one word, or occasionally hyphenated but 
not separated:

14.15 We have agreed that we should avoid using the same word twice in the same sentence 
as far as possible. We should also avoid using two phrases with exactly the same meaning 
in the same sentence, e.g. In the next figure (Figure 2.2 below). Try also to avoid the 
passive voice in cases like these: 
In the next figure (Figure 2.2 below) the geographical distribution of population change 
is showed for the time period 1993–2006. 

14.16 Some nouns in English are both singular and plural. public is one of them. You 
will need to choose which form to use relying mainly on your dictionary, grammar book 
or the Internet. It is not acceptable to use the plural and singular forms of the same noun 
in one sentence. It is also unacceptable to use a plural pronoun to refer to a singular noun, 
as in the following case:
The general public has great expectations on daily newspapers, in particular when they

be changed into analyzes and the discussion surrounding the ethnologist Mats Lindqvist’s 
study can be reduced to the ethnologist Mats Lindqvist’s. Remember, in academic writing 
you will need to mention the year Hallberg and Lindqvist had issued their studies: 
Hallberg makes an analysis of the discussion surrounding the ethnologist Mats Lindqvist’s 
study Gentlemen in the Business world, an ethnological Analysis of the World of 
Swedish Top-Executives. 
Hallberg (1998) analyzes the discussion about the ethnologist Mats Lindqvist’s (1994) 
Gentlemen in the Business World, an Ethnological Analysis of the World of Sweden’s Top-
Executives. 
14.18 Among the English words, which have one meaning when singular and another when 
plural, are export, exports, import and imports. My experience as an English language 
teacher and editor shows that such words are a source of trouble even for native speakers of 
English. If we know what they mean, we will certainly know how to use them in meaningful 
sentences. Let us focus on export and exports: 
export as a verb means to send goods to another country; as a noun it means the process 
of selling and exporting goods
exports as a noun means the products sent or sold to another country
Can you now see what is wrong with the use of these two words in the following:
The German export falls because the dollar falls. 
German exports fall as the dollar weakens further.  
For instance, Träcentrum and the Swedish Trade and Export Council are arranging a

14.21 Adjectives are words that describe persons or things. Adverbs are words that add 
more information about place, time, manner, cause or degree to a verb, an adjective, a 
phrase or another adverb. The word technical in the following sentence is related to the 
verb compared and has to be an adverb:
This is the first phone that technical can be compared with the iPhone. 
This is the first phone that technically can be compared to the iPhone. 
14.22 See whether the words you choose read well. nearest in the sentence below is hard to 
read. We use nearest to refer to the year that is closer in time to the occurrence of the event, 
i.e. sports, birthdays or subject matter. For example, the athlete’s name should be rounded to 
the nearest year (BBC), means we shall take the year closer to the month the athlete was 
born as the date of birth. Therefore, the use of nearest in the following does not fit: 
I think we need to downsize with about 5–10 per cent during the nearest year, says Erik 
Lowenadler, CEO of Ericsson Microwave Systems. 
I think we need to downsize 5–10 per cent next year, says Erik Lowenadler, CEO of 
Ericsson Microwave Systems. 
14.23 Do not mix up change and exchange. The first word means to become different. 
The second one refers to a place, or an act of giving something to somebody or doing 
something for somebody and receiving something in return:

The stock exchange index. 
14.24 Many learners find it hard to distinguish between loan, lend and borrow. The source 
of trouble is confusion. They may use borrow while what they have in mind is lend. Let 
us go over their meanings first. loan (v. and n.) refers to something (mainly money) which 
an organization lends and somebody borrows. lend (v.) lent, lent means to give something 
(e.g., money) to somebody, or allow them to use something that belongs to you, which 
they have to return to you later. borrow means to take and use something that belongs 
to somebody else, and return it to them at a later time. Here are a few examples which I 
hope will help you expel the confusion you might have had about the use of these words:
Problems in the student loans system are being monitored. (BBC)
My daughter has been told she is eligible for a grant and loan. (BBC)
Ipswich Town defender Tommy Smith has been loaned to Brentford. (BBC)
If the banks won’t lend you money, might a stranger? (The Economist)

14.25 Punctuation (see Chapter 7) is also a problem area. For instance, there are differences 
in the use of (.) and (,) with numbers between English and other European languages. In 
English we use (.) as a decimal marker and usually (,) as a thousand marker. Also, there 
are special ways of writing the names of currencies (see Chapter 9) in English, which are 
different from those prevalent in other European languages: 
Penthouses on Östermalm have falling with 23% this summer. That is about 10.000 
Swedish crowns per square meter. 
Penthouses in Östermalm have fallen 23% this summer, that is about SEK 10,000 per 
square meter. 
14.26 Do not agglutinate, i.e. do not form words by combining them with other words 
and word elements on your own. Use an authoritative dictionary to see whether two words 
(compounds) are written as one word, separated or hyphenated:
European datacenters are facing a serious energy crisis. 
European data centers are facing a serious energy crisis. 
14.27 Do not confuse lose (v) and loose (adj. v.). The latter means not firmly fixed where 
it should be:

trust. 

14.33 The words economics, economic, economical, economically and economy might 
be rather difficult for some learners to tackle, particularly the difference that exists between 
economic and economical. Let us first go over their meanings and uses:
economics has two meanings, the first (n. singular) refers to the study of money, trade and 
industry; the second (n. plural) refers to the way in which money influences or is organized:
Preston Austin has managed to squeeze the economics of NY Times. (NY Times)
Paul A. Samuelson is the first American Nobel laureate in economics. (NY Times)
Economics are a factor. (NY Times)
economic (adj) is connected to the first meaning of economics and is used before nouns:

economical (adj) is used mainly when referring to things that use or consume no more 
than is necessary, providing good value:

14.39 Note that their and there fall within the category of friendly words (see Chapter 15).

14.40 You will need to be extra cautious when using figurative language. Never take it for

form figures of speech on your own. One good way is to consult authoritative dictionaries.

14.41 Let us round up this chapter by saying a few words about amount of, number of, 
few, less, fewer than and lesser than (for more details see 3.1 and 3.6). The general rule is 
that amount of is used with uncountable nouns, number of is used with countable nouns. 
few is used with plural nouns and a plural verb to mean not many, and less is used with 
uncountable nouns to mean smaller amount. Here are a few examples:
Over the next two and a half years, no fewer than 59 different variations of the BBC One 
balloon were produced. (BBC)
Half of all employees earned less than the median. (BBC)
We all require a certain amount of fat and calories in our diets. (FT)

14.42 Compounds in English are written in different ways. They can be written as one word, 
two words or joined by a hyphen. They can be nouns, adjectives or verbs made of two or 
more words or parts of words. There is no rule of thumb on how to write them, but this 
does not mean that you are free to bring any two elements (i.e., nouns adjectives, verbs and 
particles) together haphazardly. It is always a good idea to seek help from an authoritative 
dictionary. Generally speaking, noun compounds are mainly written as one word and 
occasionally hyphenated. Verb compounds are mostly separated. Note the following examples:
back up (v.) backup (n.)
crack up (v.) crackup (n.)
cut back (v.) cutback (n.)
show off (v.) showoff (n.)
shut down (v.) shutdown (n.)
smash up (v.) smashup (n.)
take up (v.) takeup (n. and adj.)
take off (v.) takeoff (n. and adj.)
take over (v.) takeover (n. and adj.)

15	 FRIENDLY WORDS
This chapter explains the differences and similarities in meaning, mainly between pairs of 
words that often are a source of trouble when writing English. I call them ‘friendly words’ 
because they have some common characteristics from the viewpoints of orthography or 
phonetics or both. This short list of words is not haphazard, in the sense that these words 
were picked at random from the lexicon. They were collected from the corpus, which I 
had compiled over the ten years of my teaching English and editing English texts. First, I 
explain the meanings of these words, and then provide examples to show how mainstream 
English publications use them. 
15.1	 accept/except
accept is a verb and means to agree or answer positively. except is both a conjunction and 
a preposition. Many learners sometimes confuse between the two and often find it difficult 
to use except properly. except as a preposition means with the exclusion of:
We shouldn’t accept that losing our brightest and best is always progress. (Guardian)

15.3	 advice/advise

aid is a verb and noun. As a verb, it means to assist or be assisted. As a noun, it means 
assistance or support. aide is a noun and means an assistant or supporter:

allusion means an indirect reference to somebody or something. illusion means an impression 
or belief that is false or unreal:

WWII allusion. (Guardian)
If life is real and art is an illusion, does the life of an artist glide between illusion and

15.7	  always/never/all
Sometimes words like these terrify me. Life is full of exceptions and such words leave no 
room for that. I have found many of my students to be very fond of these words, particularly 
all. As a writer, you need to be absolutely sure that you leave no room for exception before 
using such words, otherwise you are bound to lose readers’ trust.
15.8	  among/amongst/amidst/amid/between
among and amongst are prepositions and have the same meaning, i.e., something or someone 
is in the middle or in the company of. amidst is a variant of amid, both are prepositions 
and refer to something or someone in the middle of or surrounded by. between, also a 
preposition, refers to the position someone or something has in relation to interval, quantity, 
amount or degree. Many non-native speakers of English follow the general tradition of 
using between for two, and among for more than two. Unfortunately, this rule is no longer 
justified since between can also be used with more than two items or entities, particularly 
when their number is unspecified:
A scholar finds no evidence of cannibalism among Donner Party members. (NY Times)

In 2006, Mr. Préval was again elected president amidst allegations of impropriety.

15.10	  and/but
These two coordinating conjunctions have great potential in writing. They connect words, 
phrases and clauses and are versatile as far as meaning is concerned. The issue I want to 
raise here is whether we can use them to start a sentence or not. Many learners frown when 
seeing and or but at the beginning of a sentence. But I am afraid that is no longer the case 
in current English and in most mainstream English publications:
And it is clear that many key establishment figures are giving only very reluctant support 
to President Ahmadinejad. (BBC)
But last week was particularly bad. (NY Times)

15.11	  anybody/anyone/any one/such as/no one/everyone
anybody is a pronoun. It means anyone, i.e. any person. The two-word form any one 
means one person or thing of a group. Many learners do not see this important distinction 
between the one-word form anyone and the two-word form any one. Another important 
point to note concerns the type of pronoun (singular or plural) to use to refer to anyone 
and anybody. Here, grammar and sense have pulled in different directions. But in a world 
so conscious about gender stereotyping, admired writers and mainstream publications such 
as The Christian Science Monitor, The Washington Post and The New York Times may 
use plural pronouns – they, them, their, themselves – to refer to singular pronouns, such 
as every, each, everybody, one, anyone, no one, everyone, and even nouns such as an 
individual and a person. One way to avoid assuming maleness or femaleness (he or she) 
is to rephrase your sentence, but often a plural construction will serve:
Is anyone in America listening? (Monitor)
I doubt anybody is going to get their ideal best case out of this. (Monitor)
The state legislature has passed a law that allows the police to stop anyone on the street 
and ask him for his papers. (Monitor)
I mean I did something that really anyone could if they tried. (Monitor)
Any one of them can cast the deciding vote on matters of life and death, individual 
freedoms, and government power. (Monitor)
Any one who is injured should be asked whether their personal details can be released 
to the Unions. (BBC)
15.12	  bad/badly 
bad is an adjective and badly is an adverb. You should not mistake bad for an adverb when 
coming across a sentence such as:
I feel bad for Pittsburgh, just as I’d have felt bad for us if we hadn’t won. (NY Times)
It’s normal to have an opinion and speak badly about us. (Independent)
If he treated me badly I’d be out of there in a flash. (NY Times)
The bad news is you may not get paid on time. (Washington Post)

15.13	  beside/besides
beside means next to or at the side of. besides means in addition to:
A major beneficiary of the Judith Rothschild Foundation, besides the artists it promotes, 
has been its only trustee. (NY Times)
Besides burning, the options included shredding, drowning and facing a firing squad. 
(NY Times)
Hazare’s associates barred them all from sitting beside him on the dais. (AP)
15.14	 bloc/block 
Both words are pronounced in the same way but are totally different in meaning. bloc 
refers to political alliances when coalitions of people, groups or even nations agree on the 
purpose or goal. block has more than a dozen meanings in English, but none of them has 
anything to do with political alliances:
She has said that the 27-nation bloc should adopt “restrictive measures” of its own. (BBC)
Officials try to block websites containing “suspicious” words, including “drugs, military 
government, democracy, student movement”, according to the US State Department. 
(BBC)
This commercial product is fresh coconut sold in the form of a hard white block. (BBC)
15.15 	borrow/lend/loan
(See 14.25)
15.16	  chair/chairperson/chairman/chairwoman
The four words are synonymous in the sense that they are used to refer to a person holding 
an office or a position of authority in departments, offices, colleges, meetings, etc. The first 
two, chair and chairperson, are neutral in gender but chairman and chairwoman are 
gender specific, that is we use them when we are certain about the gender of the person 
we are talking about. As outlined in 13.9, in English we now prefer to select the words 
and constructions which are neuter in gender as far as possible:
Mr Papademetriou has been chair of the Migration Committee. (Economist)
Dr Isher Judge Ahluwalia, one of India’s foremost economists, is Chairperson of the 
Board of Governors. (Economist)
President Obama today tapped Janet Yellen to be the Fed’s Vice Chairwoman. (Economist)

15.17 client/clientele/customer/patron
In general client means customer. It refers to the person, company or organization that 
uses the professional services of another. patron means customer or client but assumes 
other more important meanings as it generally refers to a person who supports or backs a 
cause, an activity or an organization. clientele, mainly used in AmE, refers to the body or 
collection of customers, clients and patrons. The word can agree with both singular and 
plural verbs, depending on meaning: 
Goldman Sachs was charged with deceiving clients by selling them mortgage securities 
secretly. (WSJ)
Sometimes, it seems like companies are trying to annoy their customers. (WSJ)
 A line often forms outside the door of LAND Thai Kitchen where patrons can eat a 
two-course prix fixe lunch for $8. (WSJ)

15.18 	complement/compliment
The two words are sometimes confused. They are pronounced the same but have quite 
different meanings. As a noun complement means the thing that makes something complete. 
The noun compliment means the expression of praise and approval. The verb complement 
means combine well with something to form a whole. The verb compliment means to 
express admiration and praise:

(Washington Post)
15.23	 each/every/any
The difficulty many learners have when using these words is with their grammatical function 
rather than meaning. They represent a class of English words and expressions that can 
function as adjectives, pronouns and adverbs at the same time. These words are singular 
in form but they give the impression of plural in meaning. The confusion between form 
and meaning leads to pitfalls in writing. Here are some practical rules with examples from 
mainstream English publications:
Generally, these expressions take a singular verb:
Where Every Seat Is Front Row Center (NY Times headline)
Each petitioner receives a reply. (NY Times)
Please note ‘The Andrew Marr Show’ must be credited if any part of this transcript is 
used. (BBC)
Disqualify any entrant who breaches the rules or has acted fraudulently in any way. (BBC)
Each of the 16 countries in the euro zone has its own economic problems. (NY Times)

The word any – unlike each or every – can be used as an adjective in a noun phrase with 
a plural head:

(BBC)
The other source of problem relates to the type of pronoun to use when referring backward 
to nouns modified by these words. In sentences like these, grammar and sense go in different 
directions. While the grammar requires a singular pronoun, the meaning requires a plural 
pronoun. Many English writers as well as mainstream English publications today opt for 
the plural pronoun. The main reason is to avoid gender stereotyping (see 13.9):
Each person can keep their own files. (NY Times)
In addition, a tuition fee loan to cover fees is paid by the government on behalf of every 
student directly to the institution they attend. (BBC)

15.26	 eminent/imminent

means that something is about to occur, impending:

eminent economists. (NY Times)

Province, an insurgent stronghold in the Afghan war. (NY Times)

Though written differently, the verb and noun forms of these words have the same meaning, 
with BrE opting for enquire and enquiry and AmE opting for inquire and inquiry. The 
verb inquire or enquire means to seek information or to ask about something. The noun 
inquiry or enquiry means a question, an examination or an investigation:

15.28	  ensure/insure
Both ensure and insure mean to make sure or certain. The difference is that BrE only 
allows ensure while AmE allows both. However, in both varieties of English the word insure 
means to provide, to arrange, to acquire or to have insurance:
Police commissioners would be tasked to ensure that people were encouraged to stand 
up to anti-social behaviour. (The Independent)
Bush is working to insure Permanent Presence in Iraq. (Washington Post)
Thai government is to insure tourists against bird flu. (AP)
15.29 everyone/everybody
Both words mean all people or every person. But note that the two words, though singular 
in form, may agree with a plural verb in current English. The same applies to pronouns 
used to refer to them, particularly when trying to avoid gender stereotyping: 
No, you shouldn’t invite everyone in your class to your party. (BBC)
Everybody is welcome to edit Wikipedia. (NY Times)
I believe everybody have heard about the mystery of Loch Ness Monster. (BBC)
I advise everyone in the class to bring their umbrellas. 
Please have everyone bring their swimming suits.
15.30	 expenditure/expense
expenditure refers to the action of spending money or the amount of money spent. expense 
has several meanings. In the world of money and finance, it means cost, cause of spending 
and its plural form refers to the money spent for specific purposes. expense also means a 
sacrifice or something spent for a purpose:
Overall revenue expenditure rose 4.3 per cent on average, a small drop from 4.8 per cent 
in the previous two years. (FT)
PT Indofood Sukses Makmur may spend 4.2 trillion rupiah on capital expenditures this 
year to expand its business. (BusinessWeek)

15.31	  expensive/inexpensive
The two words are antonyms, i.e., the meaning of expensive (high in price) is opposite to 
that of inexpensive (low in price or cheap).
What’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought? (Guardian)
Job Clubs are an excellent, inexpensive way of getting peer support. (Guardian)
15.32 	farther/further
The distinction between both words is not easy to draw today as some writers and media 
outlets use them interchangeably. However, modern usage generally prefers to reserve farther 
for physical distance and further for non-physical distance:
At that point they decided to rent it out and aim for further capital growth. (The Times)
They boarded a train that they hoped would take them to Spain, but got no farther than 
a town close to Orléans. (The Times)

a few means a small number of or some, while the few means the minority. several means 
more than three, some, but fewer than many.

timescale. (BBC)

15.34	  fewer/less
The general rule is to use few, fewer, fewest with items that can be counted and less with 
mass items which can have a measureable extent. However, this rule does not hold all the 
way through. less can be used with items where fewer would apply. For instance, we use 
less than before items (nouns) that can be counted but refer to measure of amount, time 
or distance. Examine the following examples: 
When most homes can receive digital channels and radio, 6 Music will have fewer than 
700,000 listeners. (Guardian)
Trustbusters want to put less emphasis on market definition when assessing mergers.

15.36 	former/the former/latter/the latter
former refers to an earlier period, or time. the former refers to the first mentioned of two 
things or people. latter refers to time near the end of a period. the latter means the second 
of two things or people already mentioned:
American black vultures are more aggressive than turkey vultures and often drive the 
latter away from carcasses. (BBC)

There are two main types of partridge available in Britain: the native grey partridge and 
the red-legged partridge. The former has delicate and tender flesh which, when young, 
is pale and full of flavour. (BBC)
NOTE When the former or the latter refer backward to a plural noun, they agree with a 
plural verb: 
But the difference between the cost-control proposals in the Democratic bill and the cost-
control proposals in Ryan’s roadmap isn’t that the former are “complicated and really hard to 
understand” (read: smart) while the latter are simple, unimaginative and cruel. (NY Times)
15.37	  if/whether
Both words are used as conjunctions in English. Grammar books dwell at length with 
their meanings and use and the differences between them. I am afraid there is no rule of 
thumb. However, use if when you want to say that one thing can, will or might happen 
or be true, depending on another thing happening or being true. Use whether to express a 
doubt or choice between two possibilities. Remember if has more uses and meanings than 
whether in English. What is interesting to note here is that both can be used in reporting 
questions (see Chapter 3):
She was having a public argument with her boyfriend when a strange woman asked 
whether she’d like to be in a film. (BBC)
Asked whether there were arguments, he replied: “Yeah, of course.” (BBC)
Wendy asks if this is an issue on which the DUP struggles. (BBC)
“We are continuing urgently to clarify whether any other British nationals were on the

15.39	 its/it’s
The first its is a possessive pronoun. It modifies a noun. The second is a contraction of it 
is or it has.
Clothing chain Zara opens its first store in India, as its Spanish owner Inditex continues 
its global expansion. (BBC)
It’s not just a game, it’s a promotion. (NY Times)
So far, it’s never happened. (NY Times)
15.40	 lie/lay
lie, lay, lain means to rest, recline or be situated on a flat or horizontal surface. lay, laid, 
laid means to put, place or cause something to lie down. Do not confuse lie as an irregular 
verb with the regular verb lie, lied, lied, which means to give or make a false statement. 
Also note that lie is used as a noun to mean a false statement:
For French and Italian Soccer, Dark Days Could Lie Ahead (NY Times headline)
Ms. Stewart-Smith then laid a hand on the woman’s shoulder as she passed through the 
threshold of the room. (NY Times)
The writers will have the highly subjective option of deciding if Bonds and Clemens 
cheated and lied. (NY Times)
15.41	  luggage/baggage
Both words have the same meaning. They refer to bags, suitcases taken out on a journey. 
The difference is that the BrE luggage is baggage in AmE:
She said the airline hoped to put between 2,000 and 3,000 pieces of luggage on flights 
throughout the day. (BBC)
15.42	  one/ones/one’s/once
These words have numerous meanings and uses. Here I will concentrate on areas which are 
problematic for English language learners. The word one is a pronoun in English and is 
mainly used to refer to an unspecified individual or avoid repeating a noun that has already 
been mentioned. We use one to refer to singular nouns and ones to refer to plural nouns. 
We use one’s as the possessive form of one. The last word once is an adverb and means 
formerly, or at one time in the past:
One was hoping this president will attempt some real reform by tackling much more 
important areas. (BBC)
The wooden platform probably once led out to a small island sitting in the lake. (BBC)

They pick uncharacteristic works by the artists we know well, and turn up major statements 
by the ones we don’t. (NY Times)
15.43	  personal/personnel
The word personal is an adjective. It mainly means that the things it modifies are private, 
related to a particular person. The word personnel refers to the number of people employed 
by an organization, or the organization’s administrative unit handling their issues:

we protect your personal information is always within the terms of our privacy policy. 
(BBC)
Founded in 1998 by former Navy Seals, Blackwater Worldwide says it has prepared tens 
of thousands of security personnel to work in hot spots. (NY Times)
15.44	 principle/principal
The word principle is a noun and means basic truth or rule of law. principal is both 
adjective and noun. As an adjective, it means the highest or foremost in rank or degree. 
As a noun, it refers to a person holding a presiding position such as the head of a school:
The former principal of a Lincolnshire college has become an OBE in the Queen’s 
Birthday Honours list. (BBC)

experience”. (BBC)
Arabic is the nation’s principal language. (NY Times)
I take it as a first principle of economics that consumers respond to pricing. (NY Times)
15.45	 rise/raise
Some dictionaries list more than 20 meanings for rise (rose, risen). But it is probably one 
out of its many meanings that learners get confused with when writing English. rise, which 
generally means to increase in number, amount, volume, size, intensity, force or level, is a 
transitive verb, i.e., it does not need an object. rise can be used as a noun in English, too. 
raise, which is a regular verb, has as many meanings, many of them are identical with rise. 
But raise is a transitive verb, requiring an object. When used in a sentence, its meaning 
should be to cause something to increase in level, force, intensity, size, volume, amount or 
number. Also raise can be used as a noun:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

FURTHER READING
The main work to which this book relates is A student’s Grammar of the English Language 
(SGE) by S. Greenbaum and R. Quirk (Longman, 1990) and the related workbook by 
S. Chalker (Longman, 1992). Chalker’s workbook simplifies SGE and provides scores of 
exercises of what can be ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ in English. However, there are other grammars, 
using the same basic approach, which can be consulted in coordination with this book. 
A Communicative Grammar of English published by G. Leech and J. Svartvik (Longman, 
1994) is written with the needs of foreign learners of English in mind. There are other 
grammar books targeting foreign learners like English Grammar in Use by R. Murphy, first 
published in 1985 (Cambridge University Press), and now in its third edition. It is a self-
study reference and practice work. CUP’s English language teaching includes several grammar 
titles with practical use like Advanced Grammar in Use 2nd Edition, Advanced Grammar in 
Use Supplementary Exercises and Essential Grammar in Use 3rd edition. Other works readers 
might find useful include The Craft of Editing (Springer, 2000) by M. Alley, Publication 
Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th Edition 2009), and The New York Times 
Manual of Style and Usage (Three River Press, 1999), written by A. Siegal and W. Connolly.
