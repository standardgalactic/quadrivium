Introduction
P
erhaps you’ve applied for a job and have been refused an application because you 
don’t have a high school diploma or a GED. Or maybe you were up for a promotion at 
work, but when your boss found out you didn’t finish high school, he said you weren’t eligi-
ble for the new job. Maybe you’ve always wanted to go to college but couldn’t even apply 
because the college of your choice requires a high school diploma or equivalent (the GED) 
for admission. Or perhaps your kids are just about to graduate from high school, and you’re 
motivated to finish, too.
Whatever your reasons are for wanting to earn a high school diploma — whether we’ve 
mentioned them here or not — this book is for you. It takes you through the process of pre-
paring to take the GED tests — which, if you pass them, offer you the equivalent of a high 
school diploma without all the time-consuming bells and whistles of a high school education.
About This Book
If you want a high school diploma, you can always go back and finish high school the old-
fashioned way. Of course, it may take you a few years, and you may have to quit your job to 
do it. Plus, you’d have to sit in a class with teenagers for eight or so hours a day (and proba-
bly be treated like one, too).
For most people, this situation doesn’t sound too appealing. This book presents a different 
solution: to earn a high school diploma in the shortest time possible. If you don’t mind pre-
paring yourself for a series of challenging tests that determine whether you’ve mastered key 
skills, you can get a General Educational Development (GED) diploma that’s the equivalent 
of a high school education — and you can do so in much less than four years.
If taking the GED tests to earn your diploma sounds like a great idea to you, this book is a 
necessary study tool because it’s a fun-filled and friendly instruction manual for succeeding 
on the GED tests. It isn’t a subject-matter preparation book — that is, it doesn’t take you 
through the basics of math and then progress into algebra, geometry, and so on. It does, 
however, prepare you for the GED by giving you detailed information about each test, two 
sets of full-length practice tests, and plenty of easy-to-understand answers and explanations 
for those tests. Use this book as your first stop. We include numerous practice tests you 
can take to help you prepare for taking the GED tests. After taking the first set of practice 
tests and going through the answers and explanations, you can determine which subject 
areas you need to work on.

Foolish Assumptions
Here’s who we think you are:
 
✓ You meet your state’s requirements regarding age, residency, and the length of time 
since leaving school that make you eligible to take the GED tests. (Check with your 
local GED administrator to find out your state’s requirements.)
 
✓ You’re serious about getting a high school diploma as quickly as you can.
 
✓ You’re willing to put in the time to prepare, keeping in mind that you have a lot of 
other responsibilities, too.
 
✓ Getting a high school diploma is a priority in your life.
 
✓ You want a fun and friendly guide that helps you achieve your goal.
 
✓ You want to gain some insight from the experience of others.
If any of these descriptions sounds like you, welcome aboard. We’ve prepared an enjoyable 
tour of the GED.
What You’re Not to Read
You probably have a very busy life with numerous responsibilities like children, a job or 
two, and social activities. You may not have the time to read every single word we write. 
The good news is you don’t have to read everything. If you want to read just the essential 
information that can help you prepare for the GED, you can skip the sidebars. The sidebars 
are the areas of text on a gray background. They add a little background information, but 
they’re not essential to your understanding of the subject.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has seven parts, each of which prepares you for the GED. We’ve organized this 
second edition a bit differently from the first: The first part gives you the ins and outs of the 
GED, each of the next five parts deals specifically with one of the five tests, and the last part 
includes some fun tips for maximizing your test scores and being successful on the GED 
tests. The following sections explain each part in a little more detail.
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective
If you’ve never heard of the GED tests, you can use Part I to find out everything you need to 
know about the GED as a whole, including what it covers and who can take it. If you have 
heard of the GED, turn to this part to find out some extra information and some handy tips 
for succeeding on all five of the GED tests. You also find out how to register for the tests 
and how to figure out your scores after you receive them.

 Introduction
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: 
The Language Arts, Writing Test
This part tells you everything you ever wanted to know about the Language Arts, Writing Test 
and provides you with two practice tests (and the answers that go with them) to help you 
prepare for this test. Here, you get to test your ability to organize content, improve sentence 
structure, and correct grammatical mistakes. You also get to try your hand at writing an essay 
for Part II of this test. Don’t panic! This essay isn’t a full research essay — it’s a short essay 
that uses your past experiences and knowledge as research. And, to help you do your best, 
this part offers you a handful of pointers and strategies to keep in mind as you take the test.
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test
This part is all about the Social Studies Test. Here, you get a chance to take inventory of 
your skills in understanding principles and concepts in history, geography, economics, and 
civics. You get to practice answering multiple-choice questions based on both textual and 
visual materials (these visual materials include maps, cartoons, and graphs). You also find 
some pointers and strategies to help you do your best on the test. Like the other test-spe-
cific parts of this book, this part offers you two full practice tests and the answers that go 
with them. Take some time to go through these tests and read their corresponding answer 
explanations as you prepare for the Social Studies Test.
Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: 
The Science Test
For the Science Test, you’re expected to know some scientific vocabulary and have a very 
basic understanding of scientific principles. Don’t panic! You don’t have to understand 
Beilstein’s categorization of organic chemicals, but you do need to know basic concepts like 
the fact that carbon is present in many forms on earth. With a little bit of practice (hint: check 
out Part IV!) and some outside reading, you can become much more comfortable with the 
Science Test and amaze yourself with how much you already know about the topics it covers.
This part provides all the details you need to know about the Science Test, including the skills 
it tests you on, the test’s format, and a few strategies to help you do your best on the real test. 
It also offers you a ton of practice answering questions about physics, chemistry, and earth sci-
ences. And, then, to help you prepare for the real test, it provides all the answers and explana-
tions you need to figure out which questions you got right and which ones you missed.
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: 
The Language Arts, Reading Test
This part focuses on preparing you for the Language Arts, Reading Test by showing you the 
test’s format, the skills it tests you on, and some strategies to help you do well on test day. 
As you may or may not know, this test tests your ability to understand literary passages. To 
help you get ready to answer the passages that appear on this test, take the two practice 
tests in this part. Then spend some time reading the answers and explanations that go with 
them to find out what you may need to practice a little more before you take the real test.

The GED For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: 
The Mathematics Test
For those of you who cringe at the words mathematics, calculations, and problem solving — 
or for those rare few of you who get excited about them — this part is for you. Here, you 
discover all the details about the Mathematics Test you need to know, including the skills it 
tests you on, the different answer formats it uses (and instructions on how to use them), 
and some strategies that can help you do well on the test. Take some time to go through the 
practice tests in this part, and then read all the answers and explanations to find out what 
you did right and what you did wrong (and why). If you’re not great at math, don’t worry! 
We’re here to help you get familiar with the Mathematics Test so that you can feel calm and 
confident as you sit down to take the real test.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
This part is a treat to read — and you can review it in no time at all. Here you discover some 
key ways to prepare for the tests and improve your scores, ten ways to be successful on the 
GED, and ten ways to use your GED diploma after you pass the tests.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons — little pictures that you see in the margins of this book — highlight bits of text that 
you want to pay special attention to. Here’s what they mean:
 
Whenever we want to tell you a special trick or technique that can help you succeed on the 
GED tests, we mark it with this icon. Keep an eye out for them.
 
This icon points out information you want to burn into your brain. Think of the text with 
this icon as the sort of stuff you’d tear out and put on a bulletin board or your refrigerator.
 Take this icon seriously! Although the world won’t end if you don’t heed the advice next to 
these icons, the warnings are important to your success in preparing to take the GED tests.
 
We use this icon sparingly to point out additional technical information that you don’t need 
to lose sleep over. When you see this icon, feel free to skip the material next to it if you’re 
short on time.
Where to Go from Here
Some people like to read books from beginning to end. Others prefer to read only the chap-
ters or sections that interest them. Still others look in the index or table of contents for spe-
cific information they need to know now. However you want to approach this book is fine 
with us — just don’t peek at the practice tests until the moment you’re ready to take them 
(and be sure not to look at the answers until after you take the tests that go with them!).

Part I
Putting the GED 
into Perspective

In this part . . .
O
kay, you want to earn your high school diploma but 
don’t have time to attend classes eight or so hours a 
day for four years, so you’ve turned to the GED for help. 
And now you need help preparing for the GED! Lucky for 
you, this part of the book is here to help you get started 
in your test planning and preparation. It introduces you to 
the GED and gives you a brief look at each of the five tests. 
It gives you a chance to see what the GED expects you to 
know in order to receive your high school equivalency 
diploma, as well as what and how to prepare for the tests. 
It also offers some logistical help with how to schedule the 
test so you can make sure you’re eligible to take it before 
you sign up. Plus, it gives you a peek inside how the tests 
are scored, which is definitely to your advantage.
Here you can also find plenty of tips for succeeding on the 
GED tests. You find out what to take with you and what to 
leave at home, what to do if you have special needs, and 
how to manage your time. Finally, this part explains the 
importance of practice tests. The more practice you get, 
the better prepared you’ll be for what the test throws at 
you, so don’t hesitate — turn the page and get ready to 
meet the GED head on!

Chapter 1
Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the different GED test sections and their questions
▶ Registering for the exam
▶ Knowing that you can take the GED when English is your second language
▶ Understanding what your scores mean and how they’re determined
T
he GED tests measure whether you understand what high school seniors across the 
country are supposed to have learned before they graduate. When you pass these tests, 
you earn a high school equivalency diploma, which can open many doors for you — perhaps 
doors that you don’t even know exist at this point.
Ready to get started? This chapter gives you the basics of the GED tests: what the tests look 
like, how to answer the questions on them, how to schedule the tests, and what to do after 
you get your scores back.
Reviewing the Test Sections
The GED tests include the following five tests, each of which you can take separately:
 
✓ Language Arts, Writing, Parts I and II
 
✓ Social Studies
 
✓ Science
 
✓ Language Arts, Reading
 
✓ Mathematics, Parts I and II
 Note that although you can take each of the five tests separately, you must take both parts 
of the Language Arts, Writing or Mathematics Tests at the same time.
The following sections offer a closer look into what these tests cover and how they’re set up.
Language Arts, Writing Test
The Language Arts, Writing Test is split into two parts (which we explain in further detail in 
the following sections):
 
✓ Part I asks you to rewrite and revise passages. This part focuses on your grammar, 
punctuation, and spelling skills.
 
✓ Part II asks you to write an essay on a given topic. This part examines your skills in 
organizing your thoughts and writing clearly.

8
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
 
You must pass both parts to get a score in this test. If you pass one part of the test but not 
the other, you must retake both parts the next time.
Language Arts, Writing Test, Part I
The Language Arts, Writing Test, Part I, has 50 multiple-choice questions and a time limit of 
75 minutes. In this test, you’re asked to edit and revise material that’s given to you. This 
material comes from the following sources:
 
✓ Workplace materials: Work-related letters, memos, and instructions that you may see 
on the job
 
✓ How-to books: Samples of all general reference books that are supposed to make you 
richer, stronger, and lighter or a better cook, driver, investor, or student (or anything 
else you want to become better at)
 
✓ Informational works: Documents that present you with information (often dry and 
boring information), such as the instructional manual that tells you how to set the 
clock on your DVD player
You find three question types in this part of the Language Arts, Writing Test:
 
✓ Correction: In these questions, you’re asked to correct sentences presented to you.
 
✓ Revision: In these questions, you’re presented with a sentence that has a word or 
phrase underlined. If the sentence needs a correction, one of the answer choices will 
be better than the words or phrase underlined. If no correction is needed, either one of 
the answer choices will be the same as the underlined portion, or one of the choices 
will be something like “no correction needed.”
 
✓ Construction shift: In these questions, you have to correct a sentence by altering the 
sentence structure. The original sentence may not be completely wrong, but it can be 
improved with a little editing.
 
See Chapter 4 for the lowdown on this test, Chapters 5 and 7 for full-length practice Language 
Arts, Writing Tests, and Chapters 6 and 8 for answers and explanations to those tests.
To give you an idea of what the questions on this test look like, consider the following 
examples:
Questions 1 and 2 are based on the following business letter.
Dear Mr. Snyder:
(1) I have received your letter of February 3 and offer my apologi for the mistake in your 
account. (2) The charge for your checks should have been $16.20, not $1,620.00. (3) I have 
credited the entire amount, making your checks free. (4) I hope this settles the matter.
 
1. Sentence 1: I have received your letter of February 3 and offer my apologi for the mistake 
in your account.
 
 How can this sentence be improved?
 
(1) insert a semicolon after February 3
 
(2) change February to Feb.
 
(3) insert a period after February 3 and capitalize and
 
(4) change apologi to apology
 
(5) no correction needed
The correct answer is Choice (4). The correct spelling is apology.

9
 Chapter 1: Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
 
2. Sentence 3: I have credited the entire amount, making your checks free.
 
 How can this sentence be improved?
 
(1) change credited to credit
 
(2) change the comma after amount to a semicolon
 
(3) change free to freely
 
(4) change the comma after amount to a colon
 
(5) no correction needed
The correct answer is Choice (5). The sentence is correct in its current form.
Language Arts, Writing Test, Part II
In this part of the Language Arts, Writing Test, you write an essay in 45 minutes. Because the 
two parts of the Writing Test are given together, however, you can share time between the 
two parts. If you finish Part I in less than 75 minutes, you can use the extra time on Part II.
The topic you’re given to write on may sound like a question you hear in a Miss America 
pageant. Here are two examples:
 
✓ What is the most important invention discovered in your lifetime?
 
✓ How have computers allowed you to accomplish everyday tasks more efficiently?
 
See Chapter 4 for more examples of essay topics, and take a stab at writing full-length 
essays in the practice tests in Chapters 5 and 7. Time the tests so that you’re taking them 
under the same conditions as the real GED tests.
In your essay, you give your opinion or explain your viewpoint and then back it up with 
your own experiences and facts you may know from your life. This essay isn’t a research 
paper. The information for the essay topics on this test is in your head — not in a research 
library.
When you write this essay, make sure it’s a series of interconnected paragraphs on a single 
topic. Not only should the entire essay begin with an introduction and end with a conclusion, 
but each paragraph needs an introductory sentence and a concluding sentence, as well.
 Write only on the assigned topic. To make sure you understand what the topic is about, 
read it several times. Essays written off topic don’t receive scores (and if you don’t receive 
a score on Part II of the Writing Test, you have to take both Parts I and II over again).
Two different people grade your essay, and, as they do, they look for the following:
 
✓ Material that’s clearly organized
 
✓ Main points that are well focused
 
✓ Ideas that are well developed
 
✓ Words that are used properly
 
✓ Sentences that are well structured
 
✓ Sentences that use proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling
Note: Neat writing or printing makes grading easier for your real-life graders, so taking some 
time to practice writing neatly before the test isn’t a bad idea.
 
Read the newspapers and watch television news for a few months before the tests. Doing so 
gives you some material with which to back up your opinions and viewpoints in your essay.

10
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
Social Studies Test
For the Social Studies Test, you have to answer 50 multiple-choice questions in 70 minutes. 
These questions deal with the following subject areas:
 
✓ American history (25 percent)
 
✓ World history (15 percent)
 
✓ Civics and government (25 percent)
 
✓ Economics (20 percent)
 
✓ Geography (15 percent)
The questions in this test are based on written texts, pictures, charts, tables, graphs, photo-
graphs, political cartoons, diagrams, or maps. These textual and pictorial excerpts come 
from a variety of sources, such as government documents, academic texts, material from 
work-related documents, and atlases.
 
See Chapter 9 for more information about the Social Studies Test, and be sure to take the 
full-length practice tests in Chapters 10 and 12. (Then check out Chapters 11 and 13 for the 
answers and explanations.)
You may see the following types of problems on the Social Studies Test.
Question 1 is based on the following table.
Type of Religion
Date Started (Approximate)
Sacred Texts
Buddhism
500 BC
None
Christianity
33 AD
Bible (Old Testament and New Testament)
Hinduism
4000 BC
Vedas; Upanishads
Islam
600 AD
Qur’an; Hadith
Judaism
2000 BC
Hebrew Bible; Talmud
 
1. According to the table, Hinduism
 
(1) started in 600 AD
 
(2) uses the Qur’an as one of its sacred texts
 
(3) is the oldest religion
 
(4) has no known sacred texts
 
(5) has one known sacred text
The correct answer is Choice (3). The table shows that Hinduism is the oldest of the five 
religions listed because it began in 4000 BC.
Question 2 is based on the following excerpt from the diary of Christopher Columbus.
Monday, 6 August. The rudder of the caravel Pinta became loose, being broken or unshipped. 
It was believed that this happened by the contrivance of Gomez Rascon and Christopher 
Quintero, who were on board the caravel, because they disliked the voyage. The Admiral 
says he had found them in an unfavorable disposition before setting out. He was in much 
anxiety at not being able to afford any assistance in this case, but says that it somewhat 
 quieted his apprehensions to know that Martin Alonzo Pinzon, Captain of the Pinta, was a 
man of courage and capacity. Made progress, day and night, of twenty-nine leagues.

11
 Chapter 1: Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
 
2. Why would Rascon and Quintero have loosened the rudder?
 
(1) They were trying to repair the rudder.
 
(2) The Admiral found them in an unfavorable disposition.
 
(3) The captain was very competent.
 
(4) They wanted to stop to fish.
 
(5) They did not want to be on the voyage.
The correct answer is Choice (5). This answer is the only one supported by the text. The 
others may be related to statements in the passage, but they don’t answer the question.
Science Test
When you take the Science Test, you have to answer 50 multiple-choice science questions in 
80 minutes. The questions deal with the following topics:
 
✓ Life science (45 percent)
 
✓ Physical science, including chemistry and physics (35 percent)
 
✓ Earth and space science (20 percent)
 
Some of the information the questions refer to appears in passages that you read before 
answering the questions. Other information is presented in charts, figures, graphs, maps, or 
tables. Chapter 14 discusses these different formats in detail. Turn to Chapters 15 and 17 to 
take two full-length sample Science Tests that are similar to the real ones. (Don’t forget to 
go to Chapters 16 and 18 to find the answers and explanations to those tests — after you 
finish taking them, of course!)
 Most of the information you need to answer the questions on the Science Test is given to 
you in the passages and other excerpts, although to get a perfect score, you’re expected to 
have picked up a basic knowledge of science. However, even if you answer correctly only 
the questions based entirely on information presented, you should get a score high enough 
to pass.
Here are some sample problems that may be on the Science Test.
Questions 1 and 2 are based on the following excerpt from a press release.
A key feature of the Delta 4’s operation is the use of a common booster core, or CBC, a 
rocket stage that measures some 150 feet long and 16 feet wide. By combining one or more 
CBCs with various upper stages or strap-on solid rocket boosters, the Delta 4 can handle an 
extreme range of satellite applications for military, civilian, and commercial customers.
 
1. The CBC in this context is a
 
(1) Canadian broadcasting corporation
 
(2) common booster core
 
(3) cooperative boosters corps
 
(4) civilian barbers cooperative
 
(5) common ballistic cavalier
The correct answer is Choice (2). After all, it’s the only answer choice mentioned in the 
passage.

12
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
 
2. How can the Delta 4 handle a wide range of applications?
 
(1) using the Delta 4 with different names
 
(2) developing a Delta 5
 
(3) continuing research
 
(4) using the CBC as the base of a rocket ship
 
(5) creating a common core booster
The correct answer is Choice (4). The passage says that “By combining one or more CBCs 
with various upper stages or strap-on solid rocket boosters . . . ,” so Choice (4) comes clos-
est to answering the question.
Language Arts, Reading Test
The Language Arts, Reading Test includes 40 multiple-choice questions that you must 
answer in 65 minutes. Seventy-five percent of the questions are based on passages from lit-
erature and include at least one work from each of the following:
 
✓ Drama
 
✓ Poetry
 
✓ Prose fiction (that is, novels and short stories) written before 1920
 
✓ Prose fiction written between 1920 and 1960
 
✓ Prose fiction written after 1960
Twenty-five percent of the questions are based on nonfiction texts. These passages come 
from any of the following sources:
 
✓ Critical reviews of visual and performing arts: Most people go to the theater, movies, 
and concerts for entertainment, but if, after you leave, you tell other people your 
impression of what you saw, you’re doing more than just watching for entertainment’s 
sake — you’re critically reviewing the performance. In this test, some of the questions 
may be based on excerpts from critical reviews.
 
✓ Nonfiction prose: Prose is any written words not written as poetry. Prose is divided 
into two main categories: fiction and nonfiction. If the story is made up by the author, 
it’s usually referred to as prose fiction. If the words are based on facts, the work is con-
sidered nonfiction prose. A biography, an instruction manual, or a history text (even 
this book!) are all examples of nonfiction prose.
 
✓ Workplace and community documents: These documents are the types of materials 
you see on the job or in a community; they include workplace rules, employment con-
tracts, wills, deeds, mortgage documents, instructions on how to use a voting machine, 
and income tax forms.
 
Chapter 19 gives you more information about the Language Arts, Reading Test, and Chapters 20 
and 22 test your knowledge with full-length sample tests. (Don’t forget to turn to Chapters 21 
and 23 for the answers and explanations to those tests when you finish taking them.)
You may see questions like the following in the Language Arts, Reading Test.
Questions 1 and 2 are based on the following excerpt from a play.
Irvin and Mervin enter from stage left. Irvin is dressed sloppily in torn jeans, he wears a flannel 
shirt over a dirty T-shirt, and he has unkempt hair. Mervin is dressed more neatly in khakis, a 
blue buttondown shirt open at the neck, and loafers.

13
 Chapter 1: Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
Irvin: What you want to do, man?
Mervin: (laughing) With you or to you?
Irvin: (looking up) What do you mean by that?
Mervin: What are you wearing?
Irvin: What’s wrong with it?
Mervin: What’s not wrong with it?
Irvin: So what? You don’t want to go to the mall now?
Mervin: Why would I want to go to the mall with you, looking like that?
Irvin: Aren’t I your best friend?
Mervin: Can’t you dress a little better?
Irvin: Would I be a better friend if I dressed more like you?
Irvin and Mervin look at each other and shuffle off toward the mall.
 
1. What form of sentence does the author use to create this conversation?
 
(1) All of the dialogue is boring.
 
(2) All of the dialogue is in questions.
 
(3) Every sentence is in a different form.
 
(4) This is the way I talk to my friends.
 
(5) All of the dialogue is in exclamatory sentences.
The correct answer is Choice (2). Each line of dialogue is a question.
 
2. According to the dialogue, why do Irvin and Mervin want to go to the mall?
 
(1) The latest Harry Potter movie is playing there.
 
(2) They are going to meet friends.
 
(3) Irvin wants to shop for clothes.
 
(4) Mervin works there.
 
(5) They are looking for something to do.
The correct answer is Choice (5). According to the first line of dialogue, they’re looking for 
something to do. In another scene, you may find out that they’re going to see a movie, meet-
ing friends, shopping for clothes, or going to work, but GED questions are based only on the 
dialogue presented.
Mathematics Test, Parts I and II
The Mathematics Test has two parts: Part I allows you to use a calculator; Part II doesn’t. 
Each part has 25 questions. You have 45 minutes to complete each part. In other words, you 
have to answer 50 questions in 90 minutes. Answer all the questions.

14
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
The Mathematics Test covers the following four major areas:
 
✓ Algebra, equations, and patterns (20 to 30 percent)
 
✓ Data analysis, statistics, and probability (20 to 30 percent)
 
✓ Measurement and geometry (20 to 30 percent)
 
✓ Number operations (20 to 30 percent)
Eighty percent of the questions are multiple choice; the other 20 percent require you to 
answer the question yourself in what is called an alternate-format grid.
 An alternate-format grid is either a standard grid or a coordinate-plane grid. Instead of get-
ting a set of multiple-choice answers to choose from, you figure an answer and enter it on 
whichever of these two grids you’re given on the answer sheet. (Note that the coordinate-
plane grid may require some practice — if you need help and reading through Chapter 24 
isn’t enough, contact a tutor to walk you through it.)
 
Chapter 24 gives you a lot more information about the Mathematics Test, including how to 
answer the different types of questions and how to prepare for the subject areas tested. 
Check out Chapters 25 and 27 for two full-length practice Mathematics Tests, and don’t 
forget to turn to Chapters 26 and 28 for the answers and explanations.
Consider the following questions (one traditional multiple-choice question and two ques-
tions that you have to answer using alternate-format grids) that are similar to what you may 
see on the Mathematics Test.
 
1. A right-angle triangle has a hypotenuse of 5 feet and one side that’s 36 inches long. What is 
the length of the other side in feet?
 
(1) 3
 
(2) 48
 
(3) 243
 
(4) 6
 
(5) 4
The correct answer is Choice (5). Using the Pythagorean Relationship (a formula that’s 
given to you on the Formula page of the test), you know that a2 + b2 = c2, where c is the 
hypotenuse and a and b are either of the other two sides. Because you know the hypote-
nuse and one side, turn the equation around so that it reads a2 = c2 – b2.
To get c2, you square the hypotenuse: 5 × 5 = 25.
The other side is given in inches — to convert inches to feet, divide by 12: 36 ÷ 12 = 3. To get 
b2, square this side: 3 × 3 = 9.
Now solve the equation for a: a2 = 25 – 9 or a2 = 16. Take the square root of both sides, and 
you get: a = 4
 
The Mathematics Test presents real-life situations in the questions. So if you find yourself 
answering 37 feet to a question about the height of a room or $3.00 for an annual salary, 
recheck your answer because you’re probably wrong.

 Chapter 1: Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
 
2. Barb is counting the number of boxes in a warehouse. In the first storage area, she finds 24 
boxes. The second area contains 30 boxes. The third area contains 28 boxes. If the ware-
house has 6 storage areas where it stores boxes, and the areas have an average of 28 boxes, 
what is the total number of boxes in the last three areas? Record your answer on the stan-
dard grid by writing the number in the top boxes and shading in the bubbles below the 
boxes. You have to write the answer in both places.

The correct answer is 86 (which you record on the standard grid provided). If the ware-
house has 6 storage areas and they have an average of 28 boxes in each, they have 6 × 28 = 
168 boxes in the warehouse. The first three areas have 24 + 30 + 28 = 82 boxes in them. The 
last three areas must have 168 – 82 = 86 boxes in them.

The correct answer is to shade the missing point at (0,4). If you shade the three points 
given on the coordinate-plane grid, you see that a fourth point at (0,4) creates the rectangle. 
Just be sure, however, that you don’t draw on the GED test book as you’re taking the test!

It’s a Date: Scheduling the Test
To take the GED, you can’t just drop in to the testing site and take the test whenever you 
please. You have to schedule it based on the available testing dates. Each state or local test-
ing center sets its own schedule for the five GED tests, which means that your state decides 
how and when you take the five tests. Schedules for the tests vary by state or local testing 
center and may be offered as often as once every week or as seldom as once every couple of 
months. Your local GED administrator can give you all the information you need about 
scheduling the test. Locate the GED administrator in your area by logging on to www.
gedtest.org or by calling 800-62-MYGED. In addition, local school districts and commu-
nity colleges can provide information about local test centers in your area.
Taking all five of the GED tests together takes seven hours and five minutes, with breaks in 
between the tests. Depending on your local testing center, you may have to take all the tests 
in one sitting (a rare stipulation), or you may be able to break the tests up into two or more 
sittings. Some states allow you to take one test each time you go to the testing center, and 
some offer the tests in the evenings or on weekends.
The following sections answer some questions you may have before you schedule your test 
date.

 Chapter 1: Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
Discovering whether you’re eligible
Before you schedule your test, make sure you meet the requirements to take the GED. 
You’re eligible to apply to take the GED tests only if
 
✓ You’re not currently enrolled in a high school. If you’re currently enrolled in a high 
school, you’re expected to complete your diploma there. The purpose of the GED tests 
is to give people who aren’t in high school a chance to get an equivalent high school 
diploma.
 
✓ You’re not a high school graduate. If you’re a high school graduate, you should have a 
diploma, which means you don’t need to take the GED.
 
✓ You meet state requirements regarding age, residency, and the length of time since 
leaving high school. Check with your local GED administrator to determine your 
state’s requirements concerning these criteria.
Knowing when you can take the tests
When can you take the GED tests? The simple answer is this: If you’re eligible and prepared, 
you can apply to take the GED tests as soon as you want. Just contact your local testing 
center to get a test schedule, and then pick a day (or days) that works for you.
You can also apply to take the tests if you’re not prepared, but if you do that, you don’t 
stand a very good chance of passing. If you do need to retake any of the tests, use your time 
before your next test to get ready. You can retake the tests only a limited number of times, 
and, in most jurisdictions, taking the test costs money (check with your local testing center 
to find out how many times you can retake the test). To save time and money, prepare 
before you schedule the tests.
Are special accommodations available?
The GED testing centers make every effort to ensure that 
all qualified people have access to the tests. If you have 
a disability, you may not be able to register for the tests 
on Monday and take them on Friday, but, with some 
advanced planning, you can probably take the tests 
when you’re ready. Here’s what you need to do:
 ✓ Contact the GED Testing Service or your local GED 
center and explain your disability.
 ✓ Request any forms that you have to fill out for your 
special circumstances.
 ✓ Ensure that you have a recent diagnosis by a physi-
cian or other qualified professional.
 ✓ Complete all the proper forms and submit them with 
medical or professional diagnosis.
 ✓ Start planning early so that you’re able to take the 
tests when you’re ready.
Please note that, regardless of your disability, you 
still have to be able to handle the mental demands of 
the tests.
The GED Testing Service in Washington, D.C., defines 
specific disabilities, such as the following, for which it 
may make special accommodations, provided the dis-
ability severely limits your ability to perform essential 
skills required to pass the GED:
 ✓ Medical disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, epi-
lepsy, or blindness
 ✓ Emotional disabilities, such as schizophrenia, major 
depression, attention deficit disorder, or Tourette’s 
syndrome
 ✓ Specific learning disabilities, including perceptual 
handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, 
dyslexia, and developmental aphasia

18
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
Signing up
To sign up for the test, follow these steps:
 
1. Contact your local GED administrator to make sure you’re eligible.
 
2. Ask the office for an application (if needed) or an appointment.
 
3. Complete the application (if needed).
 
4. Return the application to the proper office, with payment, if necessary.
 
 The fees vary state by state, so contact your local administrator or testing site to find 
out what you have to pay to take the tests. In some states, if you fall into a low-income 
bracket, you can have the fees paid for you.
 
Never send cash in an envelope to pay for the GED. Most local administrators have payment 
rules and don’t accept cash.
Working with unusual circumstances
If you feel that you may have a special circumstance that prevents you from taking the GED 
tests, contact the GED administrator in your area. If, for example, the tests are going to be 
held on your Sabbath, the testing center may make special arrangements for you.
 
When applying for special circumstances, keep the following guidelines in mind:
 
✓ Document everything in your appeal for special consideration.
 
✓ Contact the GED administrator in your area as early as you can.
 
✓ Be patient. Special arrangements can’t be made overnight. The administrator often has 
to wait for a group with similar issues to gather so he can make arrangements for the 
entire group.
 
✓ Ask questions. Allowances can be made if you ask. For example, special allowances 
include extended time for various disabilities, large print and Braille for visual impair-
ments, and age (for those individuals older than 60 who feel they may have a learning 
disability).
Taking the GED When English 
Is Your Second Language
The good news is that English doesn’t have to be your first language for you to take the 
GED. The GED tests are offered in English, Spanish, and French. If you want to take the test 
in Spanish or French, contact your local GED administrator so that you can apply.
 
If English, Spanish, or French isn’t your first language, you must decide whether you read 
and write English as well as or better than 40 percent of high school graduates because you 
may be required to pass an English as a Second Language (ESL) Placement test. If you write 
and read English well, prepare for and take the tests (either in English or in Spanish or 
French). If you don’t read or write English well, take additional classes to prepare yourself 
in English until you think you’re ready. If you want or need more information about the lan-
guage component of the GED tests, check out the “Your Language” section at www.acenet.
edu/Content/NavigationMenu/ged/test/take/Take_GED.htm.

19
 Chapter 1: Taking a Quick Glance at the GED
In many ways, the GED tests are like the TOEFL (the Test of English as a Foreign Language) 
comprehension tests. If you’ve completed the TOEFL tests with good grades, you’re likely 
ready to take the GED. If you haven’t taken the TOEFL tests, enroll in a GED preparation 
course to see whether you have difficulty understanding the subjects and skills assessed on 
the test. GED courses provide you not only with some insight into your comprehension abil-
ity, but also with a teacher to discuss your skills and struggles.
Eyeing What You Have to 
Score to Pass the GED
To pass the tests, you have to score at least 410 on each test and have an average score of 
450 on the five tests. If you achieve a passing score, congratulate yourself: You’ve scored 
better than at least 40 percent of today’s high school graduates, and you’re now a graduate 
of the largest virtual school in the country.
The following sections address a few more points you may want to know about how the 
GED tests are scored and what you can do if you score poorly on some or all of the tests.
Identifying how scores are determined
Except for the essay, each correct answer is worth one point. No matter how hard or easy 
the question is, if you get it right, you get one point. In each test, the points you get are 
totaled, and the total converts to a standard score, ranging from 200 to 800 on each test.
 
Because you don’t lose points for incorrect answers, make sure you answer all the ques-
tions on each test. After all, a guessed answer can get you a point. Leaving an answer blank, 
on the other hand, gives you only a zero.
Web sites that can help you plan to take the GED
The Internet is a helpful and sometimes scary place. 
Some Web sites are there to help you in your GED prep-
aration, while others just want to sell you something. 
You have to be on alert to separate the good from the 
bad. Here are a couple of essential ones:
 ✓ www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm?
Section=GED_TS: This Web site is the main 
site for the GED Testing Service. It contains all the 
essential information you may want to look up as 
you get ready for the GED. Look around at the vari-
ous links on this site — you’ll find a wealth of useful 
and relevant information here.
 ✓ www.acenet.edu/Content/Navigation
Menu/ged/test/admin.htm: If you aren’t 
sure who the GED administrator is in your area, go to 
this site for a list of all the administrators by location.
If you’re curious and want to see what’s out there, enter 
GED into any search engine and relax while you try to 
read about 22,000,000 entries ranging from the helpful to 
the helpless. We suggest leaving this last activity until 
after you’ve passed the tests. As useful as the Internet 
can be, it still provides the opportunity to waste vast 
amounts of time. And right now, you need to spend your 
time preparing for the tests — and leave the rest for 
after you get your diploma.

20
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
Knowing what to do if you score 
poorly on one or more tests
If you discover that your average score is less than 450 on any of the tests, start planning 
to retake the test(s) — and make sure you leave plenty of time for additional studying and 
preparing.
 
As soon as possible after seeing your results, contact your local GED administrator to find 
out the rules for retaking tests. Some states may ask that you wait a certain amount of time. 
Some may ask that you attend a preparation course and show that you’ve completed it 
before you can take the GED tests again. Some may charge you an additional fee.
No matter what score you receive on your first round of tests, don’t be afraid to retake any 
of them that you didn’t pass. Now that you’ve taken them once, you know what you need to 
work on, and you know exactly what to expect on test day. Just take a deep breath, and get 
ready to prepare some more before you take your next round of tests.

Chapter 2
Navigating the GED Testing System
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out who takes the GED
▶ Understanding why people take the test
▶ Using pretests to help you prepare for the GED
▶ Managing your time before and during the test
You may be wondering why you should consider taking the GED, or, if you’ve already 
decided to take it, you may be curious about why you should spend a lot of time pre-
paring for it. Well, the truth is that the GED is the best substitution for a high school 
diploma you can find in the United States today.
But why do you even need a high school diploma or its equivalent? To answer this question, 
take a serious look at the world today. In the United States, the number of people who have 
completed high school has increased sharply in the last few years. More and more people 
have completed college degrees, which brings us to the main problem. When you go to 
apply for a job, chances are good that the other people applying for that job will have more 
education than you. If you’ve been working for a while and you have recently been downsized, 
you probably entered the work force before education became one of the main applicant-
screening tools. With the shifting of industries from place to place, your skills alone may no 
longer be valued. Thus, to make a living, you need to become more competitive. Lucky for 
you, the GED is one way to do just that.
Think of yourself as a product that people should want to buy. The ingredients of your 
product have to be interesting and enticing, and the marketing of those ingredients has to 
be superb. A high school diploma is one of the necessary ingredients, and it needs to 
appear prominently on your résumé for all potential employers to see.
This chapter gives you a clear idea of why you may want to take the GED and others who 
may be in a similar situation. This chapter also points out some general tidbits that can help 
you find your way through the GED test maze and come out ahead. Although preparing for 
the GED will definitely cut into your TV time and social life — and require some sacrifices 
and a real commitment from you — in the end, passing the test and receiving the GED will 
be worth all the effort and time.
Identifying Who Takes the GED
People who take the GED are people like you who want or need a high school diploma but, 
for one reason or another, don’t have one. Check out the following sections to get a better 
picture of who takes the GED.

22
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
People who didn’t finish high school
The majority of people who take the GED dropped out of high school for some reason 
before they finished and didn’t receive a high school diploma. Perhaps you dropped out of 
school to help your family with living expenses. Perhaps school just wasn’t right for you. 
Perhaps you had a baby and weren’t able to take care of your newborn and go to school at 
the same time. The reason why you didn’t finish high school is irrelevant. 
If you’re looking to take the GED, all that matters is 
 
✓ You’re not currently enrolled in school (and haven’t been for a specified period of time).
 
✓ You’ve reached a certain minimum age. 
 
The amount of time you’ve been out of school and the age you need to be to take the GED 
depend on your local school district. You can find out these qualifications and whether you 
qualify by contacting the GED administrator in your area. Check out www.acenet.edu/
Content/NavigationMenu/ged/test/admin.htm to find your local administrator.
If you meet both qualifications, you’re eligible to take the tests. If you choose to sign up and 
take the tests, making sure you’re prepared is the next step, and that’s where we can help. 
This book is chock-full of information and helpful hints to get you through the whole GED 
process.
Newcomers to the United States
If you’ve come to the United States from another country, you may have graduated from a 
school that is equivalent to a U.S. high school but have difficulty providing proof. Not all 
U.S. employers or schools immediately accept documents from another country, especially 
if they’re in another language, which leaves you with a problem. Fortunately, the GED 
comes to the rescue. The GED is recognized across the United States and Canada; it’s as 
close to a universal diploma as you can get. Passing the GED tests provides you a diploma 
that states you’re the equivalent of a high school graduate, which is helpful for someone 
who’s having difficulty proving her level of education.
 
If English isn’t your first language and you have trouble reading it, you may need to beef up 
your English-speaking and reading skills before taking the GED. The GED tests are in English 
and require a level of English understanding equivalent to most senior high school students. 
We suggest you take some English classes to improve your reading skills before you take 
the GED. Although the GED test is available in French and Spanish as well as English, not all 
test centers offer the test in all languages, so you have to check first with your local test 
center. Some test centers also require that you prove you can read English and may require 
that you take an ESL test in addition to the GED test. Check all this out first with your local 
test administrator and avoid any last-minute surprises. To find out more about this test, 
visit www.acenet.edu and search for “GED Test of English as a Second Language.” To find 
out if your jurisdiction requires the ESL test, contact your local testing center.
Opening Doors: Why People Take the GED
People take the GED because they want to increase their opportunities either in the 
 workforce or in the world of education. In either case, the GED can open many doors 

23
 Chapter 2: Navigating the GED Testing System
for you. If you’re considering taking the GED, you may find yourself in one of the following 
situations:
 
✓ You want a better-paying job. Most employers base their pay offer on your qualifica-
tions and experience. The GED diploma is a widely recognized credential and can help 
you climb up the rungs of the pay scale.
 
✓ You want to gain admission to a college or other post-secondary institution. Post-
secondary institutions want to see that you have the ability to take their courses. Some 
may accept you if you’re older than a certain age and ask that you pass certain courses 
or take certain exams before admitting you. Most accept a high school diploma or 
equivalent. The GED diploma is definitely an equivalent and is widely accepted for a 
high school diploma.
 
✓ You want to enter a field in which a high school diploma is a necessity. Many occu-
pations and apprenticeships require a high school diploma or equivalent to enter. The 
GED diploma is the key to this lock.
 
✓ You want to feel better about yourself. People, in general, feel better about them-
selves when they have accomplished a challenging task. Passing the GED test is such a 
task, and, when you accomplish this one, you can spend some time patting yourself on 
the back as long as you don’t strain anything while doing it. It may be better to tell 
your friends and relatives and let them pat you on the back. Then you can just enjoy all 
the attention.
No matter what your situation is, the GED offers you a way to reach your goals.
Eyeing the Importance of Pretesting 
with the Practice Tests
If you knew everything that would be on a particular test, you could probably just walk in 
and ace it, right? And suppose that you didn’t pass, you could simply take it again and again 
until you passed it, couldn’t you? Actually, you couldn’t. The GED has strict rules about 
retaking it. You usually have to wait a period of time before retesting. Limits are set by the 
local authorities, so check with your local administrator. Because you can’t retake the test 
whenever you want, you need to ensure you’re prepared before you take the test so you 
pass it the first time.
The following sections discuss one of the best ways to prepare for the GED tests — pre-
tests. A pretest, or practice test as we often call it, is an informal test that covers the same 
material that the real test covers. These tests help you get a feel for that material and the 
test format. Read on to find out how you can use pretests to your advantage in order to help 
you get ready for the GED.
Using practice tests to prepare for the GED
How you use the practice tests is key to how well you do when you take the real GED. You 
can take practice tests individually or in a group (depending on your preference) to give 
you an idea of how you may do on the real test. Essentially, practice tests assist you in pre-
paring for the real GED by helping you find out what you don’t know and what you do know. 
With this information, you can prepare for the test more efficiently.

24
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
Just because a practice test has the word test in it doesn’t mean you have to panic. Repeat 
to yourself, “This practice test is my friend and only wants to help me.” Doing so can help 
you relax and understand that the practice tests in this book are set up to do just that — 
help you relax and practice for the real tests. These practice tests also help you discover 
your weaknesses and strengths so you can concentrate on subject areas that you need to 
study, which can definitely improve your chances of success on the real tests.
We supply several practice tests throughout this book that help you get familiar with what 
to expect on test day. Before each set of tests in each part, we provide you with a chapter 
that outlines what’s unique about that particular test. Note: Not all tests on the GED are the 
same, and knowing as much as you can about each test can help you pass it. (For example, 
the Language Arts Test has a different format than the Math Test.) After you read the initial 
chapter in each part, you’re ready to take the ensuing practice tests.
Working your way through a practice test
To get the most out of the practice tests in this book, you need to know what to do when 
taking them. Set yourself up as if you were going to take the real test. Time yourself and 
don’t take a break to check the answers. The closer you come to real test conditions, the 
better the result will be when you take the real test.
When taking any practice tests in this book, keep the following steps in mind to help you 
through the process:
 
1. Carefully read the instructions at the beginning of each test.
 
 Take a few minutes to read and understand them. Normally, the person giving the real 
test makes sure that everyone understands the instructions before going ahead with 
the test. If you have any questions about the directions for a particular practice test, 
ask. The best time to concern yourself about instructions is before the test. The 
instructions for the practice tests are as close as possible to the instructions for the 
real tests. You can find tons of info about the tests in this book as well as on the GED 
Web site at www.acenet.edu. If all else fails, ask your local administrator before the 
test about the instructions. He or she will tell you, if the answer is public knowledge. If 
the answer is to be revealed when you take the test, be patient.
 
2. Know the time restrictions for the real test, and stick to them as you take the prac-
tice test.
 
 Timing is very important during the GED tests. At the beginning of each test, the direc-
tions tell you how much time you have for the test. Make sure you stick to the allotted 
time. Use an alarm clock; have a friend keep an eye on the time; or do anything else 
you have to do to make sure you don’t go over the time limit.
 
 During the real test, the person giving the test will remind you about the time allotment 
and what will happen at the end of the test. Usually, he tells you to put your writing 
instruments down and close your book. Whatever the test proctor says, make sure you 
do it. This is not the time to show how much of an individual you are. Be part of the 
crowd and follow instructions.
 
3. Prepare for the practice test the way you would prepare for the real test.
 
 Have your writing instruments ready and waiting. Have enough scrap paper to make 
notes. Make photocopies of the answer sheets or tear them out of this book so that 
you don’t have to keep flipping back and forth in the book. Find an uncomfortable 
chair to sit on — test centers aren’t famous for their comfortable seating. Concentrate 
on the test — not the chair — and you’ll be fine. The other way around can be a recipe 
for disaster.

25
 Chapter 2: Navigating the GED Testing System
 
4. Make a mental plan beforehand so you know how to answer the questions in the 
allotted time.
 
 You know before you start taking the test how many questions are on it and how much 
time you have to answer them. You also know about how many minutes you can safely 
spend on each question. Make a mental plan of how you’re going to use this informa-
tion. Obviously, you can’t time each question, but you may feel comfortable timing each 
set of five or ten questions to make sure you stay on track. You may want to set aside a 
few minutes at the beginning to scan over the material and pick out the easy questions. 
Or you may decide to read all the questions and start with the even-numbered ones and 
finish with the odd-numbered ones. Whatever you choose, make the decision ahead of 
time and stick to it.
 
5. Skim the questions, answer the easy ones first, and then focus on the more difficult 
ones. 
 
 Be sure to record all your answers on your answer sheet. If possible, leave some time 
at the end of the test for review. Don’t overthink the questions. You’re looking for the 
best answer as stated or suggested by the question and any other material presented. 
If your previous knowledge tells you that the best answer according to the passage 
isn’t the correct answer, play the multiple-choice game. Choose the best answer based 
on the material presented to you. In doing so, if your previous knowledge is flawed or if 
you forget something you should remember, you can still get the right answer and pass 
the test — which, of course, is the goal of this entire exercise.
 
6. After you finish all the questions or run out of time, make some notes on your scrap 
paper about the difficulty of the test.
 
 Make notes about which questions you found difficult to answer and which ones you 
found easy to answer. Make notes about how you felt as you took the test. Did you 
have enough time? Did specific sections cause you trouble? Make notes on everything 
you remember about the test — these notes will come in handy later.
 
7. Check the answers to see how you did.
 
 You can find the answers and their explanations in the chapter immediately following 
the practice test chapter. For each question, compare your answer to the correct 
answer. If you got it wrong, read the explanation to try to figure out why. If you’re not 
sure why it’s wrong, try reading the question and its answer’s explanation again. If 
you’re still not sure, ask for help. If you answered correctly, congratulate yourself, but 
read the explanation anyway. You may find out a bit more about doing a particular 
type of question, or you may just find out what you already know. If you don’t read the 
explanation, you won’t find out anything more.
 
8. When you finish checking your answers, add up the number of questions you 
answered correctly.
 
 On the real test, the scores are computed using a complex calculation that we can’t do 
here. To be on the safe side, though, consider that getting 80 percent of the answers 
correct leaves you with a safe margin for error. If you scored more than 20 percent of 
the questions wrong, you still have work to do.
 
9. Review the questions you missed, even if you missed only one, and read the notes 
you made right after you finished the test (see Step 6).
 
 If your notes indicate that you knew you had problems with these questions when you 
answered them, compare those notes with the answers. For example, if you felt you 
had trouble with the questions about graphs and you got most of the graph-related 
questions wrong, you need more help with graphs. If you got them right, you may be 
worrying too much or you may just need a quick review of graphs. At this point, you 
can review your plan of action or make up one if you haven’t already done so. That 
way, you have a plan for passing the test based on experience. Then decide for your-
self what you want to do next to continue preparing.

26
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
 
 In the introductory chapter for each test, we tell you what’s being tested in that partic-
ular test. Go to the sections in the introductory chapter with headings that focus on 
the areas in which you need the most help (based on your analysis of your answers 
and posttest notes). If you made the most mistakes in one or more areas, spend most 
of your time working on that area as you prepare to take another practice test. And 
remember: Sometimes you have to take a slight detour to get to your goal. If you’re 
having a lot of trouble with a particular test or section, consider looking into a course, 
asking a friend, or getting a tutor for that test or section. Whatever you decide to do, 
practice, practice, practice.
 
10. Go on to the second practice test if you did well on the first one or if you’ve finished 
any extra preparation you wanted to do.
 
 Follow Steps 1 through 9 to complete that test the same way you did the first. If your 
score improves, congratulate yourself. If it doesn’t and you get a less-than-perfect 
score, analyze your mistakes to find out your areas of weakness and concentrate on 
them. At this point, you may want to do some additional practice or consider joining a 
GED preparation class. You can also find some sample questions for the GED at www.
acenet.edu/Content/NavigationMenu/ged/test/prep/sample_questions.
htm. The important thing is to get some help and do more preparation. Whether you 
do well or not on the practice tests, the GED instructors can help you decide whether 
you’re ready to take the real tests.
Managing Your Time for the GED
Time management becomes an important issue as soon as you decide you need a high 
school diploma equivalency. If you had all the time in the world, you could just meander 
through preparation and planning. Unfortunately, you have deadlines that you or others 
may have set for you, which means you have a limited time to do something. Managing your 
time means that you stand a very good chance of finishing on time. How well you figure out 
how to manage your time can make accomplishing your goals that much more possible in 
the time allotted.
In this section, we give you some hints about how to manage your time. To start, this sec-
tion consists of about 800 words. Think about how long it takes you to read and understand 
an 800-word passage. Keep track of the time it actually takes to do this activity. You can use 
that information as you plan how to spend your time taking the test.
Before the tests
Prior to taking the GED, you have plenty of tasks to tend to, and you have to find time to 
take care of them. Before you start studying or doing any other preparation work, you need 
to have a firm grasp of what you need to do and how much time you need to devote to each 
task — which is where we come in to help you.
Before the test, make sure you do the following:
 
1. Make a list of everything you need to do to prepare for the GED.
 
 We suggest you first look at the GED Web site at www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.
cfm?Section=GED_TS, consult your local administrator, and review material such as 
this book to help you prepare. Create your own list based on your skills and the test 
areas where you need the most help. You can create a table like the one we provide 
you here to help you stay organized.

Wait for results while considering a realistic

the results are low.
 
2. After you have your list, approximate how much time you need to complete each 
task, indicating both when you’d like to have it done and leaving space to fill in the 
date you actually complete it.
 
 Estimate how long you think it may take you to finish a task. Remember that some 
tasks will take longer than others. For example, getting a copy of your high school tran-
script may take only a couple of hours, while preparing for your weakest subject area 
may take 30 or 40 hours, depending on how much time you need. Make sure to take 
into consideration any lag time because you won’t always get immediate answers to 
questions; sometimes you’ll have to wait to see people or wait on the mail. Take a cal-
endar and figure out when you should have the task completed.
 
Your plan for managing your time is written on paper, not carved in stone. As you work 
through the preparation process, you may realize that you need more time for one task, 
such as taking more math pretests, and less time for another task. If so, that’s okay. You can 
simply revise your schedule to take your new needs into consideration. Sometimes a pencil 
and an eraser are a time manager’s best friends. Make sure you write down the date when 
you’ve completed each task.
During the tests
After the GED starts, you’re on strict timelines to finish each test. The best thing you can do 
to manage your time during the tests is simple: Relax. Many students get so psyched up right 
when they sit down to take the tests that they have trouble focusing and waste valuable time.
During the test, use the following time-management strategies to help keep yourself on track 
and to finish on time. We include specific time-management strategies for each test in the 
part of the book that deals with each particular test.
 
✓ Take deep breaths, and do anything you can to relax and focus on the task at hand. 
Some people like to meditate. Others like to visualize themselves doing well on the test. 
Still others like to close their eyes and say a little prayer. Whatever your preference, take 
a few minutes to relax, but remember you don’t get extra time on the test to do so.
 
✓ Skim the questions to spot the easy ones, and do those questions first. After doing so, 
look at your watch and quickly calculate how many questions are left and how much 
time you have to do them. To determine how much time you can spend on each ques-
tion, divide the time remaining by the number of questions you have left. Be sure to 
add in a little extra time at the end of the test for review (see the next bullet point for 
details). Note: In each part, we offer a chapter that outlines how many questions are on 
each test and how much time you have to answer them. Use these chapters to help you 
create a mental game plan before the test so you’re better prepared to manage your 
time when you get to the real test.
 
✓ Leave a few minutes at the end to review your answers. You need a few minutes to 
make sure you answered everything correctly. Quickly look over your answers, but 
don’t panic and change them because you think an answer is wrong at the last minute. 
Chances are that the answer you selected first is the right one. Try to realistically con-
sider any changes you want to make.

 Chapter 2: Navigating the GED Testing System
After you pass the test: What you can do with your GED
After passing the GED and receiving that beautiful 
diploma, you’re ready to think about your future. In addi-
tion to the obvious celebrations for your personal gradu-
ation, you have plenty more to do. Consider the following 
ways you can improve your life with your new GED in 
hand. Chapter 31 has some interesting ways your life 
can change with a GED.
 ✓ You can qualify for a better job. If you took the 
GED to get a better job, go for it. Having a GED may 
increase your chances of passing the initial screen-
ing process and getting an interview. During the 
interview, you can shine your way past the other 
qualified applicants. Make sure you let your pro-
spective employer know that you passed a test 
that about 40 percent of high school graduates 
would have trouble passing. Furthermore, you’ve 
proved that you’re a diligent worker by preparing 
and passing the GED after leaving school. You’re 
dedicated, you know how to prepare, and you learn 
well — if you didn’t, you couldn’t have passed the 
test. Basically, you’re worthy of being hired. With 
this attitude, you should do well in interviews and be 
on your way to getting a better job.
 
 Take some information about the GED tests and 
diploma with you to your interview. Don’t assume 
that every Human Resource person knows all 
about the GED. Go to the GED Home Page and 
download some information to strengthen your 
case. You can enter GED ace into a search engine 
or go to www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.
cfm?Section=GED_TS.
 
 If you get the job, you can earn a larger salary to 
help fund your future. If you’re good at what you do 
and work your way up, you can fund your present 
and future needs.
 ✓ You can go to college or some other post-secondary 
school. With a GED, you can apply to and improve 
your chances of getting accepted at many post-
secondary schools. Check with the school you want 
to apply to, and find out the admission requirements; 
review its deadlines for applying and the courses it 
offers. Consult with the financial aid office to find out 
about your options for payment.

Succeeding on the GED
In This Chapter
▶ Getting ready the night before and the day of the test
▶ Figuring out what to expect on test day
▶ Nailing down important test-taking strategies
▶ Staying calm and relaxed while you take the test
You may never have taken a standardized test before. Or if you have, you may wake up 
sweating in the middle of the night from nightmares about your past experiences. 
Whether you have or haven’t experienced the joys or sorrows of standardized tests, to suc-
ceed on the GED, you have to know how to perform well on this type of test, which consists 
mostly of multiple-choice questions.
The good news is you’ve come to the right spot to find out more about this type of test. 
This chapter explains some important pointers for what you can do the days and nights 
before and the morning of the test and what you need to do during the test to be successful. 
It also explains some important test-taking strategies that can help you feel confident.
Leading Up to Test Time
Doing well on the GED involves more than walking into the test site and answering the ques-
tions. You need to be prepared for the challenges in the tests. To ensure you’re ready to 
tackle the test head-on, make sure you do the following leading up to the test:
 
✓ Get enough sleep. We’re sorry if we sound like your parents talking, but it’s true — 
you shouldn’t take tests when you’re approaching exhaustion. Plan your time so that 
you can get a good night’s sleep for several days before the test. If you prepare ahead 
of time, you’ll be ready and sleep will come easier.
 
✓ Eat a good breakfast. A healthy breakfast fuels your mind and body. You have to 
spend several hours taking the test, and you definitely don’t want to falter during that 
time. Eat some protein, such as eggs, bacon, or sausage with toast for breakfast. Avoid 
sugars (donuts, jelly, fruit) because they can cause you to tire easily. You don’t want 
your empty stomach fighting with your full brain.
 
✓ Take some deep breaths. During your trip to the testing site, prepare yourself mentally 
for the test. Clear your head of all distractions, practice deep breathing, and imagine 
yourself acing the test. Don’t panic.
 
✓ Start at the beginning, not the end. Remember that the day of the test is the end of 
a long journey of preparation and not the beginning. It takes time to build mental 
muscles.
 
✓ Be on time. Make sure you know what time the test begins and the exact location of 
your test site. Most examination centers don’t let you enter if you’re late. Don’t take a 

32
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
chance — arrive early. If necessary, take a practice run to make sure you have enough 
time to get from your home or workplace to the testing center. You don’t need the 
added pressure of worrying about whether you can make it to the test on time. In fact, 
this added pressure can create industrial-strength panic in the calmest of people.
 
 Traffic happens. No one can plan for it, but you can leave extra time to make sure it 
doesn’t ruin your day. Plan your route and practice it. Then leave extra time in case a 
meteor crashes into the street and the crowd that gathers around it stalls your prog-
ress. Examiners don’t have a lot of sympathy for you if you show up late because you 
didn’t check the starting time. They have even less sympathy if you show up on the 
wrong date.
Finding Out What to Take to the GED Tests
The GED may be the most important exam you ever take. Treat it seriously and come pre-
pared. Make sure you bring the following items with you on test day:
 
✓ You: The most important thing to bring to the GED tests is you. If you enroll to take 
the tests, you have to show up; otherwise, you’ll receive a big fat zero. If something 
unfortunate happens after you enroll, contact the test center and explain your situa-
tion to the test administrators. 
 
✓ Correct identification: Before test officials let you into the room to take the test, they 
want to make sure you’re you. Bring the approved photo ID — your state GED office 
can tell you what’s an approved form of photo ID. Have your ID in a place where you 
can reach it easily. And when asked to identify yourself, don’t pull out a mirror and 
say, “Yep, that’s me.”
 
✓ Fees you still owe: To take the GED, you must pay a registration fee, which varies from 
state to state. (Check with your local administrator to double-check when the fee has 
to be paid and how to pay it.) If you don’t pay the fee, you can’t take the exam. Bring 
your receipt in case of any misunderstanding at the door.
 
✓ Registration confirmation: The registration confirmation is your proof that you did 
register. If you’re taking the tests in an area where everybody knows you and every-
thing you do, you may not need the confirmation, but we still suggest you take it 
anyway. It’s light and doesn’t take up much room in your pocket.
 
✓ Other miscellaneous items: In the instructions you receive after you register for the tests, 
you get a list of what you need to bring with you. Besides yourself and the items we list 
previously, other items you want to bring or wear include the following:
 
• Comfortable clothes
 
• Comfortable shoes
 
• Wristwatch with a second hand, if possible (If you haven’t changed the battery 
lately, you may want to do so beforehand.)
 
• Two No. 2 pencils or HB mechanical pencils; a pen for the essay (all of which may 
be provided for you at the testing center — but why take a chance?)
 
The rules about what enters the testing room are strict. Don’t take any chances. If an item 
isn’t on the list of acceptable items and isn’t normal clothing, leave it at home. The last 
place on earth to discuss whether or not you can bring something into the test room is at 
the door on test day. If you have questions, contact the test center in advance. Check out 
www.acenet.edu/resources/GED/center_locator.cfm to find a list of sites close to 
your home with their addresses and phone numbers. You can also call 800-62-MYGED to ask 
your questions of real people. Whatever you do, be sure not to bring the following:

33
 Chapter 3: Succeeding on the GED
 
✓ Books
 
✓ Calculator (one is provided for you — see Chapter 24)
 
✓ Notes or scratch paper
 
✓ MP3 player
 
✓ Cell phone (leave it at home or in your car)
 
✓ Anything valuable, like a laptop computer or radio that you don’t feel comfortable leav-
ing outside the room while you take the exams
Knowing What to Expect When You Get There
Usually you take the GED in a large examination room with at least one official (sometimes 
called a proctor or examiner) who’s in charge of the test. The proctor gives each test taker a 
booklet and an answer sheet when the test is scheduled to begin and then reads instruc-
tions to all the students. Listen carefully to these instructions so you know when and if you 
can take bathroom breaks, how much time you have to take the test, and other important 
information.
As soon as the proctor gives you permission to open the test booklet, start by skimming the 
questions. Don’t spend a lot of time skimming — just enough to spot the questions you abso-
lutely know and the ones you know you’ll need more time to answer. Use your very own code to 
mark the easy ones in the test booklet. After you finish skimming, answer all the questions you 
know first; that way you leave yourself much more time for the difficult questions.
For each question — except for a few on the Mathematics Test (see Chapter 24) and the 
essay in Part II of the Language Arts, Writing Test (see Chapter 4) — you have five answers 
to choose from. Read each question carefully, keeping in mind that only one answer is cor-
rect. Choose the answer that’s closest to the correct answer as presented to you in the 
question. If what you know is different from what the question says, go with the information 
in the question. A machine usually grades the tests, and the machine doesn’t know what’s in 
your head. Sometimes you have to choose the best answer, not the absolutely correct one.
 
You don’t have to answer questions in order. Nobody except you will ever know in which 
order you answered the questions, so do the easiest questions first.
Because taking standardized tests probably isn’t a usual situation for you, you may feel ner-
vous. This is perfectly normal. Just try to focus on answering one question at a time, and 
push any other thoughts to the back of your mind. Sometimes taking a few deep breaths can 
clear your mind; just don’t spend a lot of time focusing on your breath. After all, your main 
job is to pass the tests.
 Throughout the test, keep your eyes on your test. If your eyes glance around the room, the 
GED examiner may wonder what you’re doing. Never become the object of an examiner’s 
attention during a test. In the worst-case scenario, he or she may think you’re cheating and 
disqualify you.
Throughout the test, the examiner will periodically tell you how much time has elapsed or 
how much time is left. Listen to these reminders. When time is up, immediately stop writing, 
put down your pencil, and breathe a sigh of relief. When the test is over, hand in your 
answer sheet and test booklet. Listen for instructions on what to do or where to go next.

Discovering Important Test-Taking Strategies
You can increase your score by practicing — and mastering — a few smart test-taking strat-
egies. To help you do so, we give you some tips in this section for planning your time, deter-
mining the question type, figuring out how to answer the different types of questions, 
guessing intelligently, and reviewing your work.
Watching the clock
You have only a certain amount of time for each test in the GED exam, so time management 
is an important part of succeeding on the test. You need to plan ahead and use your time 
wisely as you move through the tests.
 
When the test begins, check your watch and write down the time you start and the time you 
have to finish. (Write these times near the top of your answer sheet in very light pencil 
marks that you can erase before handing it in.) This way, you don’t have to waste time figur-
ing out how much time you have left partway through the test. Don’t try to remember the 
time; instead, write it down.
During the test, your proctor will probably warn you — perhaps more than once — about 
how much time remains. Check the times you’re told against the times you write down at 
the beginning of the test. Table 3-1 shows you how much time you have, on average, for 
each question in each test.

As you can see from this table, if you take two minutes for each question, you won’t have time 
to answer all the questions on the test. Keep in mind the following general time-management 
tips to help you complete each exam on time:
 
✓ Measure the time you have to answer each question without spending more time on 
timing than answering. Group questions together; for example, plan to do five ques-
tions in seven minutes. Doing so helps you complete all the questions and leaves you 
several minutes for review.
 
✓ Keep calm and don’t panic. The time you spend panicking could be better spent 
answering questions.
 
✓ Practice using the sample tests in this book. The more you practice timed sample test 
questions, the easier managing a timed test becomes. You can become used to doing 
something in a limited amount of time if you practice.

35
 Chapter 3: Succeeding on the GED
Identifying different question types
Although you don’t have to know too much about how the test makers developed the ques-
tions to answer them correctly, you do need some understanding of how they were con-
structed. Knowing the types of questions you’re dealing with can make answering them 
easier — and you’ll face fewer surprises. Some questions in math require a special form for 
the answer. Knowing the question type can shape the way you think about the answer. 
Some questions ask you to analyze material given in the passage, which means the informa-
tion you need is in the passage. Others ask you to infer from the passage, which means that 
all the information may not be in the passage. Although none of the tests are labeled with 
the following titles, the GED test questions assess your skills in the following areas.
Analysis
Analysis questions require you to break down information and look at how the information 
bits are related to one another. Analyzing information in this way is part of reasoning and 
requires you to
 
✓ Separate facts from opinions.
 
✓ Realize that when an assumption isn’t stated it may not necessarily be true. 
Assumptions stated in the passage or question help you find the best answer.
 
✓ Identify a cause-and-effect relationship. For example, you have to eat an ice cream cone 
quickly in hot weather. The cause is the hot weather and the effect is that the ice 
cream melts quickly.
 
✓ Infer. You may be asked to reach a conclusion based on evidence presented in the 
question. Inferring is a fancy way of saying that you’ll reach a conclusion. In the preced-
ing example, you can infer that you should stay in an air-conditioned space to eat your 
ice cream or eat it very quickly.
 
✓ Compare. If you consider the similarities between ideas or objects, you’re comparing 
them. The world is like a basketball because both are round, for example. 
 
✓ Contrast. If you consider the differences between ideas or objects, you’re contrasting 
them. For example, the world isn’t like a basketball because it is so much larger and 
has an irregular surface.
Relating to other people in social situations exposes most people to these skills. For exam-
ple, in most sports-related conversations between friends (or rivals), you quickly figure out 
how to separate fact from opinion and how to infer, compare, contrast, and identify cause-
and-effect relationships. In other social situations, you come to realize when an assumption 
isn’t stated. For example, you likely assume that your best friend or significant other is 
going to join you for a late coffee the night before an important test, such as the GED, but, in 
reality, your friend may be planning on going to bed early. Unstated assumptions that you 
assume can get you into trouble in life and on the GED tests.
Application
Application questions require you to use the information presented to you in one situation 
to help you in a different situation. You’ve been applying information left and right for most 
of your life, but you probably don’t realize it. For example, when you use the information 
from the morning newspaper to make a point in an argument in the afternoon, you use your 
application skills.
Comprehension
A comprehension question asks whether you understand written material. The GED test makers 
expect you to be able to state the info on the test in your own words, develop a summary of 

36
Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
the ideas presented, discuss the implications of those ideas, and draw conclusions from those 
implications. You need to develop these comprehension skills to understand what the multiple-
choice questions are asking you and to answer the questions successfully.
 
The best way to increase your comprehension is to read extensively and to ask another 
person to ask you questions about what you read. You can also use commercial books that 
specifically help you with your comprehension by presenting you with written material and 
asking you questions about it. One of those books is in your hands. All the other For Dummies 
test-preparation books, as well as AP English Literature & Composition For Dummies by Geraldine 
Woods (Wiley), have reading comprehension as a major focus, too. Feel free to check out these 
books to improve your comprehension if you still have difficulty after using this book.
Synthesis
Synthesis questions require you to take apart blocks of information presented to you and 
put the pieces back together to form a hypothesis, theory, or story. Doing so gives you a 
new understanding or twist on the information that you didn’t have before. Have you ever 
discussed something that happened, giving it your own twist and explanation to create a 
brand new narrative? If so, you’ve already put your synthesis skills to use.
Evaluation
Any time someone presents you with information or opinion, you judge it to make sure it 
rings true in your mind. This evaluation helps you make decisions about the information 
presented before you decide to use it. If the clerk behind the ice cream counter suggests 
you get a raspberry cone instead of the flavor you wanted because everyone knows that 
raspberry melts slower than all the other flavors, you may be a bit suspicious. Especially if 
you notice that the clerk also has four containers of raspberry ice cream and only one of 
each other flavor, you may evaluate it as biased or even incorrect.
Cognitive skills
Mental skills that you use to get knowledge are called cognitive skills and include reasoning, 
perception, and intuition. They’re particularly important in reading for understanding, 
which is what you’re asked to do on the GED tests. You can increase your knowledge and 
comprehension by reading books, researching on the Web, or watching documentaries. 
After you read or watch something new, discuss it with others to make sure you understand 
it and can use it in conversation.
Addressing and answering questions
When you start the tests, you want to have a game plan in place for how to answer the ques-
tions. Keep the following tips in mind to help you address each multiple-choice question:
 
✓ Whenever you read a question, ask yourself, “What am I being asked?” Doing so 
helps you stay focused on what you need to find out to answer the question. You 
may even want to decide quickly what skills are required to answer the question 
(see the preceding section for more on these skills). Then try to answer it.
 
✓ Try to eliminate some answers. Because all the questions are straightforward, don’t 
look for hidden or sneaky questions. The questions ask for an answer based on the 
information given. If you don’t have enough information to answer the question, one of 
the answers will say so.
 
✓ Find the best answer and quickly verify that it answers the question. If it does, mark 
it on the answer sheet and go on. If it doesn’t, mark the question in the test booklet and 
come back to it after you answer all the other questions, if you have time. Just remem-
ber to erase all marks in the test booklet before turning it in.

37
 Chapter 3: Succeeding on the GED
Guess for success: Using intelligent guessing 
The multiple-choice questions provide you with five possible answers. You get one point for 
every correct answer, and nothing is subtracted for incorrect answers, which means you 
can guess on the questions you don’t know for sure without fearing that you’ll lose points. 
Make educated guesses by eliminating as many wrong choices as possible and choosing 
from just two or three answers.
When the question gives you five possible answers and you randomly choose one, you have 
a 20-percent chance of guessing the correct answer without even reading the question. Of 
course, we don’t recommend using this method during the test.
If you know that one of the answers is definitely wrong, you now have just four answers to 
choose from and have a 25-percent chance (1 in 4) of choosing the correct answer. If you 
know that two of the answers are wrong, you leave yourself only three possible answers 
to choose from, giving you a 33-percent (1 in 3) chance of guessing right — much better 
than 20 percent! And, finally, if you know that three of the answers are wrong, your chances 
of choosing the correct answer move up to 50 percent, which is as good as a random 
choice gets!
 
If you don’t know the answer to a particular question, try to spot the wrong choices by 
keeping in mind the following tips:
 
✓ Make sure your answer really answers the question at hand. Wrong choices usually 
don’t answer the question; that is, they may sound good, but they answer a different 
question than the one the test asks.
 
✓ When two answers seem very close, consider both answers carefully because they 
both can’t be right — but they both can be wrong. Answers that are very close are 
sometimes given to see whether you really understand the material.
 
✓ Look for opposite answers in the hopes that you can eliminate one. If two answers 
contradict each other, both can’t be right, but both can be wrong.
 
✓ Trust your instincts. Some wrong choices may just strike you as wrong when you first 
read them. If you spend time preparing for these exams, you probably know more than 
you think.
Leaving time for review
Having a few minutes at the end of a test to check your work is a great way to set your mind 
at ease. These few minutes give you a chance to look at any questions that may be troubling. 
If you’ve chosen an answer for every question, enjoy the last few minutes before time is 
called — without any panic. Keep the following tips in mind as you review your answers:
 
✓ Although you technically have a minute and a half for each question, on average, try to 
do each question within a minute. The extra seconds you don’t use the first time 
through the test add up for time at the end of the test to review. Some questions 
require more thought and decision making than others. Use your extra seconds to 
answer those questions.
 
✓ Do not try to change a lot of answers at the last minute. Second-guessing yourself can 
lead to trouble. If you have prepared well and done lots of sample questions, you have 
a good chance of getting the correct answers the first time. Ignoring all your prepara-
tion and knowledge to play a hunch isn’t a good idea at the race track or on a test.
 
✓ Review is a good time to check that your answers are displayed properly. Make sure 
that the circles are filled and that you don’t have any stray marks on the answer sheet. 
A machine may read your doodles as answers and miss a partially completed circle.

Part I: Putting the GED into Perspective 
Keeping Your Head in the Game
To succeed in taking the GED, you need to be prepared. In addition to studying the content 
and skills needed for the five tests, you also want to be mentally prepared. Although you may 
be nervous, you can’t let your nerves get the best of you. Stay calm and take a deep breath. 
Remember the following pointers to help you stay focused on the task at hand:
 
✓ Take time to relax. Passing the GED tests is an important milestone in life. Make sure 
you leave a bit of time to relax, both while you prepare for the tests and just before you 
take them. Relaxing has a place in preparing as long as it doesn’t become your main 
activity. 
 
✓ Make sure you know the rules of the room before you begin. If you have questions 
about using the bathroom during the test or what to do if you finish early, ask the proc-
tor before you begin. If you don’t want to ask these questions in public, call the GED 
office in your area before the test day, and ask your questions over the telephone. If 
you’re a member of Facebook, send your questions to www.facebook.com/group.
php?gid=46193757671, which is an easy way to go if you get caught in a jungle of 
unanswered voice mails. For general GED questions, call 800-62-MYGED or check out 
www.gedtest.org.
 
✓ Keep your eyes on your paper. Everybody knows not to look at other people’s papers 
during the test, but, to be on the safe side, don’t stretch, roll your eyes, or do anything 
else that may be mistaken for looking at another test.
 
✓ Stay calm. Your nerves can use up a lot of energy needed for the test. Concentrate on 
the job at hand. You can always be nervous or panicky some other time.

Part II
Minding Your Ps and Qs: The 
Language Arts, Writing Test

In this part . . .
T
his part takes you inside the Language Arts, Writing 
Test, giving you the lowdown on both Parts I and II. 
On this test, you get a chance to answer multiple-choice 
questions and write a short essay. Lucky you!
To keep yourself from panicking, all you have to do is pre-
pare for these tasks — which is where this part comes in 
handy. Here you find out how the Language Arts, Writing 
Test is put together and on which skills it tests. With that 
information in hand, you can become familiar with what 
you’re expected to know before taking the tests — and 
this familiarity will prove incredibly beneficial on test day. 
As an added bonus, we also offer you some strategies that 
can help you do your best on this test.
After cramming your head with test details, we give you a 
chance to test your skills and preparation on two full-
length practice tests. Each of the tests has an answer 
chapter with explanations to help you understand why the 
answers are what they are, as well as suggestions for how 
to write a well-thought-out essay.

The Write Stuff: Preparing for the 
Language Arts, Writing Test, 
Parts I and II
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the format of the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
▶ Knowing what kinds of questions appear on Part I and figuring out how to prepare for them
▶ Preparing to write an essay for Part II and practicing with some sample prompts
T
he Language Arts, Writing Test evaluates your skills in comprehending and applying 
concepts in grammar and writing. In case you don’t already know, grammar is the basic 
structure of language (you know — subjects, verbs, sentences, fragments, periods, commas, 
and all that). Most of what you’re tested on (both in writing and grammar) is stuff you’ve 
picked up over the years, either in school or just by living and speaking and reading, but, to 
help you better prepare for this test, we give you some more skill-building tips in this chapter.
As you may have gathered from this chapter’s title, the Language Arts, Writing Test comes in 
two parts. Much of Part I determines how well you know grammar by asking you 50 multiple-
choice questions.
Part II of this test is different from all the other GED tests because you have to write an 
essay. Instead of coloring in circles, you write real words and sentences that connect to 
each other in some way or another and make sense to a reader. You have 45 minutes to pro-
duce a readable, coherent piece of work about a topic presented to you. In spite of its name, 
however, Part II doesn’t consist of a real essay so much as a series of related paragraphs. 
You aren’t expected to produce a book-length opus complete with documented research. 
Rather, you’re expected to write a coherent series of interrelated paragraphs on a given 
topic and use the rules of grammar and correct spelling. Examiners look for a five-paragraph 
essay that is well organized and sticks to the topic given.
This chapter gives you the details on the Language Arts, Writing Test and offers you some 
helpful tips to assist you in succeeding.
Understanding the Test Format
As we mention earlier, the Language Arts, Writing Test breaks down into two parts, each of 
which has its own question type. Having a basic understanding of the two question types 
used in these two parts can help you avoid any surprises when you sit down to take the 
test. The following sections explain what types of questions you encounter on Part I and 
Part II and offer you some advice on how to prepare more effectively. We want you to feel at 
ease when you face these sections on the test.

42
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
Grasping what’s on Part I
Part I of the Language Arts, Writing Test consists of 50 multiple-choice questions, which you 
have 75 minutes to complete. The questions ask you to read, revise, and edit documents that 
may include how-to info, informational texts, and workplace material. Don’t worry — just 
because you haven’t studied grammar for years doesn’t mean you don’t know the material. 
You probably know more than you think. And, lucky for you, all the questions in this part are 
multiple choice, which means you don’t have to come up with the answers all on your own.
To answer the questions in this part, you need to carefully read the passage. Always read the 
entire document before answering the corresponding questions because the questions 
make more sense when you have a clear idea of the content. As you read each document, 
think to yourself, “Can I correct this passage? If so, how?”
Grasping what’s on Part II
This 45-minute test has only one question, and it’s a topic on which you have to write a 
short essay. You can add any time you have left after completing Part I of the Language 
Arts, Writing Test to your time for Part II.
For this part of the test, you’re given one topic and a few instructions. Your task is to write 
approximately two pages (one front and one back) on that topic. Remember that you can’t 
write about another topic or a similar topic — if you do, you’ll receive zero points for your 
essay, and you’ll have to retake the entire Language Arts, Writing Test.
 
The instructions that accompany your essay topic require that you use your personal 
observations, knowledge, and experience as you write about your given topic.
Passing Part I
The Language Arts, Writing Test, Part I requires you to draw on all your previous knowledge 
of grammar. To help you succeed on this test, we provide insightful information in the fol-
lowing sections that deals with what skills this part of the test covers, what types of ques-
tions you’ll encounter, what you can do to prepare, how you can manage your time, and 
how the problems look on the actual test. With this information in hand, you can stare this 
test straight in the eyes on test day.
Looking at the skills Part I covers
Part I of the Language Arts, Writing Test evaluates you on the following types of skills 
related to grammar. Note that unlike the other GED tests, Part I of this test expects that you 
know or at least are familiar with the rules of grammar; looking at the passages provided 
won’t do you much good if you don’t understand the basics of these rules already.
 
✓ Mechanics (25 percent; 12 or 13 questions): You don’t have to become a professional 
grammarian to pass this test, but you should know or review basic grammar. Check out 
English Grammar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Geraldine Woods (Wiley) to review what 
you should know or may have forgotten. The mechanics of writing include the following:

43
 Chapter 4: The Write Stuff: Preparing for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
 
• Capitalization: You have to recognize which words start with a capital letter and 
which words don’t. All sentences start with a capital letter, but so do titles, like 
“Miss,” “President,” and “Senator,” when they’re followed by a person’s last 
name. Names of cities, states, and countries are also capitalized.
 
• Punctuation: This area of writing mechanics includes everyone’s personal 
favorite — commas. (Actually, most people hate commas because they aren’t 
sure how to use them, but the basic rules are simple to apply after you know 
them.) The more you read, the better you get at punctuation. If you’re reading 
and don’t understand why punctuation is or isn’t used, check with your grammar 
guidebook or the Internet. A general rule: Don’t use a comma unless the next 
group of words is a complete sentence. For example: “As agonizing as it was to 
leave her friends, college was what she wanted.” College was what she wanted is a 
complete sentence and can stand alone. (Try http://esl.about.com/od/
englishgrammar/a/a_punctuation.htm or http://grammar.about.com/
od/punctuationandmechanics/a/punctrules.htm — just beware that 
these Web pages have advertising on them.)
 
• Spelling: You don’t have to spot a lot of misspelled words, but you do have to 
know how to spell contractions and possessives and understand the different 
spellings of homonyms.
 
• Contractions: This area of writing mechanics has nothing to do with those painful 
moments before childbirth! Instead, contractions are formed when the English lan-
guage shortens a word by leaving out a letter or a sound. For example, when you 
say or write can’t, you’re using a shortened form of cannot. In this example, can’t 
is the contraction.
 
 The important thing to remember about contractions is that the apostrophe (that’s 
a single quotation mark) takes the place of the letter or letters that are left out.
 
• Possessives: Do you know people who are possessive? They’re all about owner-
ship, right? So is the grammar form of possessives. Possessives are words that 
show ownership or possession, usually by adding an apostrophe to a person’s or 
object’s name. If Marcia owns a car, that car is Marcia’s car. The word Marcia’s is 
a possessive. Make sure you know the difference between singular and plural pos-
sessives. For example: “The girl’s coat is torn.” (Coat is singular, so the apostro-
phe goes before the s.) “The girls’ coats are torn.” (Coats is plural, so the 
apostrophe goes after the s.)
 
✓ Organization (15 percent; 7 or 8 questions): On the test, you’re asked to correct pas-
sages by changing the order of sentences or leaving out certain sentences when they 
don’t fit. You have to work with passages to turn them into logical, organized para-
graphs. You may be asked to work with paragraphs to form a better composition by 
changing them around or editing them by improving or adding topic sentences or 
making sure that all the sentences are about the same topic. The important thing to 
remember is that the questions are all multiple choice, which means you have only a 
limited number of options for making the passages better. Read the questions carefully 
and you should have no problems.
 
✓ Sentence structure (30 percent; 15 questions): Every language has rules about the 
order in which words should appear in a sentence. You get a chance to improve sen-
tences through your understanding of what makes a good sentence. Extensive reading 
before the test can give you a good idea of how good sentences are structured and put 
together. The advice here, as always, is read, read, and read some more.
 
✓ Usage (30 percent; 15 questions): Usage questions make up one of the largest portions 
of the test. Grammar has a wide variety of rules, and these questions test your knowl-
edge and understanding. Subjects and verbs must agree. Verbs have tenses that must 
be consistent. Pronouns must refer back to nouns properly. If the last three sentences 
sound like Greek to you, make sure you review grammatical usage rules.

44
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
Having a firm grasp of these writing mechanics can help you get a more accurate picture of 
the types of questions you’ll encounter on Part I of this test. The next section focuses more 
on the specific passage materials you’ll face.
Identifying the types of passages in Part I
The passages that the questions in Part I are based on come in the following three forms:
 
✓ How-to texts: Each of these articles or excerpts consists of 200 to 300 words and deals 
with topics of interest to the reader, such as how to pass the GED tests, how to write a 
great résumé, how to build a fence, or how to do anything else that may be interesting 
to the general public.
 
✓ Informational texts: These articles or excerpts provide information or analysis on 
some topic. They may be position papers, support papers, or critical evaluations of 
some subject. Each of these documents consists of about 200 to 300 words and tries to 
convey information to the reader.
 
✓ Workplace material: These articles or excerpts are all around you; they include let-
ters, meeting notes, executive summaries, and applications. Each of these documents 
consists of about 200 to 300 words and discusses the everyday topics that are familiar 
to you.
 
Regardless of what type of passage the questions in Part I are based on, your job is to cor-
rect the grammar. Grammar doesn’t change with the type of passage, so, although you 
should be familiar with the various types of passages, you need to be most familiar with the 
rules of grammar so you can use them to improve the passages.
Preparing for Part I: Tactics that work
To succeed on Part I of the Language Arts, Writing Test, you can prepare in advance by 
reviewing rules of grammar, punctuation, and spelling and by familiarizing yourself with the 
format and subject matter of the Part I test. Here are some of the best ways you can prepare:
 
✓ Read as often as you can. This strategy is the best one for passing this test, and it’s by 
far the simplest because reading exposes you to correct grammar.
 
 Keep in mind that what you read makes a difference. Reading catalogues may increase 
your product knowledge and improve your research skills, but reading literature is 
preferable because it introduces you to so many rules of grammar. Reading fiction 
exposes you to interesting words and sentences. It shows you how paragraphs tie into 
one another and how each paragraph has a topic and generally sticks to it. Reading his-
torical fiction can give you some insight into what led up to today and can also help 
you with the Social Studies Test (see Chapter 9 for more on the Social Studies Test). 
Just because we didn’t mention something here doesn’t mean you shouldn’t read it. 
Read everything you can get your hands on, including newspapers, textbooks, and 
much more.
 
✓ Master the rules of basic grammar. On this test, you don’t have to define a gerund and 
give an example of one, but you do have to know about verb tenses, subject/verb 
agreement, pronoun/antecedent agreement, possessives, and the like. As your knowl-
edge of grammar and punctuation improves, have a bit of fun by correcting what you 
read in small-town newspapers and low-budget novels — both sometimes have poor 
editing.

45
 Chapter 4: The Write Stuff: Preparing for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
 
✓ Practice grammar in everyday speaking. As you review the rules of grammar, practice 
them every day as you talk to your friends, family, and co-workers. Although correct 
grammar usually “sounds” right to your ears, sometimes it doesn’t because you and 
the people you talk to have become used to using incorrect grammar. If you see a rule 
that seems different from the way you talk, put it on a flashcard and practice it as you 
go through your day. Before long, you’ll train your ears so that correct grammar 
sounds right.
 
 Correcting other people’s grammar out loud doesn’t make you popular, but correcting 
it in your head can help you succeed on this test.
 
✓ Understand punctuation. Know how to use commas, semicolons, colons, and other 
forms of punctuation. To find out more about punctuation and when and why to use its 
different forms, check out a grammatical reference book like English Grammar For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Geraldine Woods (Wiley).
 
✓ Practice writing and reading. Write as much and as often as you can, and then 
review it for errors. Look for and correct mistakes in punctuation, grammar, and spell-
ing. If you can’t find any, ask someone who knows grammar and punctuation for help.
 
✓ Keep a journal or blog. Journals and blogs are just notebooks (physical or virtual) in 
which you write a bit about your life every day. They both provide good practice for 
personal writing. Blogging or responding to blogs gives you practice in public writing 
because others see what you write. Whether you use a personal journal or a public 
blog, though, keep in mind that the writing is the important part. If public writing 
encourages you to write more and more often, do it. If not, consider the private writing 
of a journal or diary.
 
✓ Improve your spelling. As you practice writing, keep a good dictionary at hand. If 
you’re not sure of the spelling of any word, look it up. We hear you. How do you look 
up a spelling word if you can’t spell it? Try sounding out the word phonetically and 
look in an online dictionary. Type in the word and select the word that looks familiar 
and correct. If that doesn’t work, ask someone for help. Add it to a spelling list that you 
keep and practice from. In addition, get a list of common homonyms (words that sound 
the same but are spelled differently and have different definitions), and review them 
every day. (You need to know, for example, the difference between their, there, and 
they’re.) Many dictionaries contain a list of homonyms.
 
✓ Keep in mind that these questions are multiple choice. Multiple-choice questions 
always give you the correct answer. Of course, they also tell you four other answers 
that are incorrect, but all you have to do is find the correct one! As you practice speak-
ing and writing, you tune your ears so that the correct answer sounds right, which, 
believe it or not, makes finding the correct answer easier on the test.
 
✓ Take practice tests. Take as many practice tests as you can. Be strict about time limita-
tions, and check your answers when you’re finished. Don’t move on until you know and 
understand the correct answer. (Check out Chapters 5 and 7 for two sample tests and 
Chapters 6 and 8 for their answers.) The time you spend taking and reviewing these 
practice tests is well worth it.
Managing your time for Part I
To complete Part I of the Language Arts, Writing Test, you have to answer 50 questions in 
75 minutes, which breaks down to 11⁄2 minutes per question. However, because the ques-
tions on this test are based on passages (of between 200 and 300 words), you have to give 
yourself enough time to read the passages, too. The upside is that you don’t have to read a 
different passage for each question (because each passage is followed by a set of ques-
tions). The downside is that you have to remember the material you read about in each pas-
sage long enough to answer all the questions based on it.

46
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
You basically have two options for reading passages and answering questions in this part of 
the test. Before we explain these two options, imagine that you’re faced with a passage of 
about 300 words followed by ten questions. You have 15 minutes to complete these ten 
questions (11⁄2 minutes times ten). Here are your two options for moving through this pas-
sage and its corresponding questions:
 
✓ Option No. 1: For this option, you spend half a minute reading and understanding each 
question and the answer choices that follow, which takes about five minutes total. 
Then you spend about three minutes reading the passage, knowing what to look for, 
and you take the remaining seven minutes to answer the questions and review your 
answers. As you may recognize, we suggest using this option for managing your time 
on most of the GED tests (see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Option No. 2: Answering questions using Option No. 2 means taking a slightly different 
angle to managing your time than we discuss for most of the other tests on the GED. 
With this option, you begin by reading the passage as quickly as you can without sacri-
ficing understanding. This option calls on your speed-reading skills, which allow you to 
spend less time reading the passage (and have more time left to choose and review 
your answers).
 
 Remember that speed-reading allows you to increase your reading speed without hurt-
ing your comprehension. If you want to try out speed-reading by yourself, pick up any 
reading material and try to train your eyes to read down a line in the middle of each 
page, allowing your peripheral vision to catch the words at each edge. You can use 
your finger to increase the speed at which you read by moving it along the same line 
you read along. You can also practice your speed-reading skills by setting a timer and 
decreasing the time you have to read a page each time you start reading a new page of 
a book. Try anything that helps you read faster. Developing your speed-reading skills 
improves your scores in all the GED tests, but especially this one because it uses 
longer passages. Check out Speed Reading For Dummies by Richard Sutz (Wiley) for 
more info.
Practicing for Part I with some sample problems
Before you take Part I of the Language Arts, Writing Test, make sure you take plenty of prac-
tice tests so you’re well versed with the types of problems you’ll face. Take the following 
sample problems to help you get started. When you finish these, move on to Chapters 5 and 
7 to take the full-length practice tests.
Questions 1 through 4 refer to the following passage.
Project WKE
(1) Referral: Workers will refer dependent of WOW recipients to WKE.
(2) Intake: Intake process will involve a series of interviews and the use of transferable 
skills inventories combined with the evaluation of credentials.
(3) Assessment: A holistic asesment will be prepared and discussed with clients as prepara-
tion for additional experiences and training.
(4) Pre-Employment Training: Pre-employment training will include confidence building, 
interpersonal skills, goal setting, career path planning, problem-solving, résumé prepara-
tion, basic computer literacy, educational upgrading and child development and parenting 
skills as required.

47
 Chapter 4: The Write Stuff: Preparing for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
(5) Job Readiness Training: Experiences, such as job-shadowing and mentoring will be pro-
vided as needed for clients ready to enter the work farce in a supportive environment. 
Other clients will be provided with additional skills in sectoral analysis, cold calling, budget-
ing, time management, development of job search strategies, preparation and presentation 
of Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition Portfolios, development and evaluation of 
transferable skills inventories, interview techniques and follow-up.
(6) Referral: Clients will be referred to appropriate community agencies, if required. If 
desired by the client, alternate career pathways will be investigated and career paths 
planned for these alternate careers.
(7) Skill Enhancement: Clients will have the opportunity to enhance the following skills: 
computer literacy, prior learning assessment and recognition, assistance in gaining addi-
tional certification, use of computers and Internet in job search and career research, and 
academic skills.
(8) Supportive Job Search Activities (if unemployed): Unemployed clients will be intro-
duced to Supportive Job Search activities where they may volunteer for periods of time in 
positions congruent with their career plans to gain real world experience.
(9) Employment Retention (if employed): Employed clients will be able to call in to WKE to 
assist in the retention of clients in workplaces. Employers will be able to contact WKE if 
problems arise on the job and WKE will provide support, advice and mediation to try to 
maintain employment.
 
1. Section 1: Workers will refer dependent of WOW recipients to WKE.
 
 Which change should be made to Section 1?
 
(1) omit will
 
(2) change dependent to dependent(s)
 
(3) place a comma after Workers
 
(4) change WOW to wow
 
(5) no changes necessary
The correct answer is Choice (2). Because the sentence refers to the plural “recipients,” you 
can’t logically assume more than one dependent, but you need a word that allows for the 
possibility.
 
2. Section 3: A holistic asesment will be prepared and discussed with clients as preparation 
for additional experiences and training.
 
 Which change should be made to Section 3?
 
(1) change holistic to wholistic
 
(2) change will be prepared to was prepared
 
(3) change clients to patience
 
(4) change asesment to assessment
 
(5) no changes necessary
The correct answer is Choice (4). This question requires you to correct a spelling mistake. 
Always be careful of double letters. Many English words have double letters that are pro-
nounced like single letters.

48
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
 
3. Section 5: Experiences, such as job-shadowing and mentoring will be provided as needed 
for clients ready to enter the work farce in a supportive environment. Other clients will 
be provided with additional skills in sectoral analysis, cold calling, budgeting, time man-
agement, development of job search strategies, preparation and presentation of Prior 
Learning Assessment and Recognition Portfolios, development and evaluation of trans-
ferable skills inventories, interview techniques and follow-up.
 
 Which change should be made to Section 5?
 
(1) change job-shadowing to jobshadowing
 
(2) change supportive to support
 
(3) change additional to a whole lot of
 
(4) change skills to skill
 
(5) change farce to force
The correct answer is Choice (5). The word farce refers to a comic drama or film; this sec-
tion is referring to a retraining program, which is definitely more serious.
 
4. Section 9: Employed clients will be able to call in to WKE to assist in the retention of cli-
ents in workplaces. Employers will be able to contact WKE if problems arise on the job 
and WKE will provide support, advice and mediation to try to maintain employment.
 
 Which change should be made to Section 9?
 
(1) change retention to resistence
 
(2) rewrite the first sentence like this: Employed clients will be able to call in to WKE if 
problems arise on the job.
 
(3) omit if problems arise
 
(4) change support, advice and mediation to supportive advice, and mediation
 
(5) change assist in the retention of clients to assist in the release of clients
The correct answer is Choice (2). Of all the suggestions made, this one makes the most 
sense in the context of the passage. If you read the passage carefully, clients call in WKE if 
they have problems on the job. The original wording suggests otherwise.
 
As you practice doing these types of questions (here and in Chapters 5 and 7), remember to 
read the questions first; doing so gives you an idea of what you need to look for in the pas-
sage as you read it. Also, be sure to read the questions carefully — they aren’t trick ques-
tions, but they do expect you to be a good reader.
Revealing some helpful pointers for Part I
Remember the following tips as you move through Part I:
 
✓ Read the questions quickly before you read the entire passage. This way, you’ll know 
what to look for in the passage.
 
✓ Read carefully. As you read the passages, look for errors and hard-to-read sentences. 
The more carefully you read the passages, the better chance you have of getting the 
right answers when you move on to the questions.

49
 Chapter 4: The Write Stuff: Preparing for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
Passing Part II
Part II of the Language Arts, Writing Test asks you to write an essay on an assigned topic that 
will then be read by two essay graders (find out more about these graders and what they’re 
looking for in the “Revealing some helpful pointers for Part II” section). You have 45 minutes 
to read the given topic and write your corresponding essay. This part of the test assesses 
your literacy and understanding. Even if you can understand the essay topic, you must thor-
oughly know the format of writing an essay and have a knowledge of the rules of grammar.
 
Keep in mind that writing this essay isn’t that different from writing a letter or a blog — 
except that here you must explain or clarify the subject for the reader without rambling on 
until you run out of space.
 If you don’t pass this part of the Language Arts, Writing Test, you have to take both parts 
over again. That fact alone should be all the incentive you need to practice writing.
Looking at the writing skills Part II covers
Two trained essay readers grade your essay by focusing on five major criteria or skills. By 
having a clear understanding of the main skills covered in this part of the test, you can 
ensure that you address all of them when writing your essay — which will translate into 
success in terms of your essay score. The GED Testing Service defines the five essay criteria 
you need to address as follows:
 
✓ Response to the prompt: This criterion refers to how well you answer the topic, includ-
ing whether or not the focus of the response shifts as you write.
 
✓ Organization: This criterion refers to whether or not you show the reader through 
your essay that you have a clear idea about what you’re writing and that you’re able to 
establish a definable plan for writing the essay.
 
✓ Development and details: This criterion refers to your ability to expand on initial con-
cepts or statements through the use of examples and specific details instead of using 
generic lists or reiterating the same information.
 
✓ Conventions of edited American English: This criterion refers to your ability to appro-
priately use edited written English, including the application of the basic rules of gram-
mar that you’re tested on in Part I, such as sentence structure, mechanics, usage, and 
so forth.
 
✓ Word choice: This criterion refers to your ability to use appropriate words to express 
your ideas.
The evaluators grade your essay as inadequate, marginal, adequate, or effective, depending 
on your success in each of these five categories. You can check out www.acenet.edu/
Content/NavigationMenu/ged/etp/writing_2_test_descr.htm for a more in-
depth breakdown of these five criteria and what the evaluators look for in an essay that 
receives a passing score. Read the sections on what constitutes a passing score very care-
fully. If you don’t pass the essay, you have to retake the entire test.

Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
Preparing for Part II: Tactics that work
As you prepare for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Part II, do the following:
 
✓ Read and read some more. Just like for Part I (and most other tests on the GED), read-
ing is important. Reading exposes you to well-crafted sentences, which can help you 
improve your own writing. Reading also expands your horizons and provides you with 
little bits of information you can work into your essay.
 
 As you read, make an outline of the paragraphs or chapters you read to see how the 
material ties together. Try rewriting some of the paragraphs from your outline, and 
compare what you write to the original. Yours may not be ready for prime time, but 
this little exercise gives you practice in writing organized, cohesive sentences and 
paragraphs, which can go a long way in this part of the test.
 
✓ Practice writing neatly. You can’t take a computer and printer into the test for Part II, 
so you have to express your thoughts the old-fashioned way — with a pen and paper. 
Remember way back in grade school when you learned how to write neatly? Well, 
now’s the time to call on all your good-handwriting skills (no matter how buried they 
may be). Graders have to read your essay to score it, so it’s in your best interest to 
make reading your writing as easy as possible.
 
 Really neat, beautiful penmanship is easy to read, but it takes a long time to write. You 
need something in between chicken scratch and calligraphy — legible writing that you 
can write quickly. Neat and quick are the important words to keep in mind here (after 
all, this is a timed test like all the others!).
 
✓ Practice editing your own work. After the test starts, the only person able to edit your 
essay is you. If that thought scares you, practice editing your own work. Take a writing 
workshop, or get help from someone who knows how to edit. Practice writing a lot of 
essays, and don’t forget to review and edit them as soon as you’re done writing.
 
✓ Review how to plan an essay. Few people can sit down, write a final draft of an essay 
the first time around, and receive a satisfactory grade. Instead, you have to plan what 
you’re going to write. The best way to start is to jot down everything you know about a 
topic without worrying about the order. From there, you can organize your thoughts 
into groups. Check out the “Managing your time for Part II” section for more help on 
planning your essay.
 
✓ Practice writing on a topic (and not going off topic!). Your essay must relate to the 
given topic as closely as possible. If the test asks you to write about your personal 
goals, and you write about a hockey game you once played in, you can kiss your good 
score on this part of the test goodbye.
 
 To help you practice staying on topic, read the newspaper and write a letter to the 
editor or a response to a columnist. Because you’re responding to a very narrow 
topic that appeared in a particular newspaper article, you have to do so clearly and 
concisely — if you ever want to see it in print. (You can also practice staying on topic 
by picking a newspaper article’s title and writing a short essay about it. Then read the 
actual story and see how yours compares.)
 
✓ Think about and use related examples. If you’re writing about how machines make life 
harder, the difficult experience you had trying to get your toaster fixed under warranty 
makes for a great example. In contrast, a story about painting your bike fluorescent 
pink doesn’t make such a hot example. Remember that examples can provide great 
support to your essay’s main points, but, to do so, they have to relate to the topic.
 
✓ Practice general writing. If writing connected paragraphs isn’t one of your fortes, 
practice doing so! Write long e-mails. Write long letters. Write to your member of 

51
 Chapter 4: The Write Stuff: Preparing for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
Congress. Write to your friends. Write articles for community newspapers. Write short 
stories. Write anything you want — whatever you do, just keep writing.
 
✓ Write practice essays. Check out the “Practicing with some sample essays” section 
later in this chapter for a sample essay you can read. Then see Chapters 5 and 7 for 
some more practice essay prompts (in actual test format). Write essays based on the 
topics given, and then ask a knowledgeable friend or former teacher to grade them for 
you. You can also turn to Chapters 6 and 8 to read a couple of sample essays based on 
the same topics you’re given in Chapters 5 and 7. You may want to take a preparation 
class in which you’re assigned practice topics to write about, too. When you’re fin-
ished practicing, practice some more.
Managing your time for Part II
You have 45 minutes to finish your essay for Part II of the Language Arts, Writing Test, and, 
in that time, you have four main tasks:
 
✓ Plan
 
✓ Draft
 
✓ Edit and revise
 
✓ Rewrite
The following sections take a closer look at these tasks and explain how you can success-
fully complete each one in the time allotted for this test.
 
Taking 10 minutes to plan, 20 minutes to draft, 5 minutes to edit and revise, and 10 minutes 
to rewrite is a good plan for action. Keep in mind that this schedule is a tight one, though, 
so if it makes your writing too sloppy to read, consider allowing more time for rewriting. 
No one but you will see anything but the final version.
Planning
Before you begin writing your essay, read the topic carefully several times, and ask yourself 
what the topic means to you. Then, on scratch paper, write down everything you can think 
of that relates to the topic, no matter how silly it seems (this act of writing is called brain-
storming, which is like dumping out the contents of a portion of your brain). Don’t worry 
about the order in which you write your ideas or the ideas you think of. Just let everything 
you think of flow onto the paper. You can sort through all the information in the next phase.
For example, if the essay question asks you to discuss a major milestone in your life, you 
may choose to center your essay around the following topic: “Passing the GED will be a 
major milestone in my life.” In your essay, you need to explain why passing the test is the 
major milestone for you at this moment and how you plan to use the GED for the better-
ment of your life. The planning stage of your essay writing is when you jot down everything 
you can think of about the GED and its effect on your life. The points you jot down here 
should include your personal observations, experience, and knowledge.
After you have these points written down, sit back for a moment to reflect. (Don’t reflect too 
long, though, because you still have an essay to write. Just take a few minutes.) Look over 
your points and find an introduction, such as, “I have accomplished many things in my life, 
but my major milestone will be passing the GED tests.” Write this sentence down beneath 
your brainstorming notes. Beneath this sentence, write down the points you came up with 
earlier that strongly back up your introduction.

52
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
Now write down a concluding sentence, such as, “Of all my accomplishments, passing the 
GED tests will be the most important because it will open doors that are closed to me now.” 
Glancing at your introduction and the essay topic itself, select points that strengthen your 
conclusion. Some of these points may be the same ones you used in your introduction.
Next, plan a path from your introduction to your conclusion. The path may be several 
points long. Here’s an example of an essay plan from introduction to conclusion:
 
✓ Introduction: “I have accomplished many things in my life, but my major milestone will 
be passing the GED tests.”
 
✓ Body: Here’s the path from your introduction to your conclusion:
 
• List my accomplishments.
 
• Discuss my goals.
 
• Discuss what’s stopping me from reaching my goals.
 
• Tie in which of these things I may be able to eliminate by having a GED diploma.
 
• Discuss which goals are attainable with the GED diploma.
 
• Envision how my life will change as I accomplish those goals.
 
✓ Conclusion: “Of all my accomplishments, passing the GED tests will be the most impor-
tant because it will open doors that are closed to me now.”
Now reflect again. Can you add any more points to improve the essay? Don’t just add points 
to have more points, though. This isn’t a contest in which the one with the most points wins. 
This is an essay in which the one with the best points, logically written, gets the passing grade.
Look over your planning path and your points. Can you combine any parts of the path to 
make it tighter? For example
 
✓ Introduction: “I have accomplished many things in my life, but my major milestone will 
be passing the GED tests.”
 
✓ Body: Here’s the tightened path from your introduction to your conclusion:
 
• List my accomplishments.
 
• Discuss my goals and what’s stopping me from reaching them.
 
• Tie in which of these things I may be able to eliminate by having a GED diploma, 
and discuss which goals are attainable with the GED diploma.
 
• Envision how my life will change as I accomplish those goals.
 
✓ Conclusion: “Of all my accomplishments, passing the GED tests will be the most impor-
tant because it will open doors that are closed to me now.”
Now that you have the outline, you’re ready to go on to the next step — drafting your essay.
Drafting
During the drafting stage of writing your essay, you think in more detail about the main 
points you came up with in the planning stage. As you add new details (called subpoints) 
under each main point, you begin to see your essay taking shape.
Here’s an example of what the drafting process may look like for the “major milestone in 
life” topic:
 
✓ Introduction: “I have accomplished many things in my life, but my major milestone will 
be passing the GED tests.”

53
 Chapter 4: The Write Stuff: Preparing for the Language Arts, Writing Test, Parts I and II
 
✓ Body: Here are all your main points and subpoints:
 
✓ List my accomplishments:
 
• I coach youth hockey.
 
• I have kept a job for four years.
 
• I got a small promotion.
 
• I got married.
 
✓ Discuss my goals and what’s stopping me from reaching them:
 
• People expect more education from hockey coaches in the minor leagues.
 
• Many promotions are blocked to me because of my education.
 
• My children may be embarrassed to have an uneducated parent.
 
• My boss likes people with diplomas and certificates.
 
✓ Tie in which of these things I may be able to eliminate by having a GED diploma, and 
discuss which goals are attainable with the GED diploma:
 
• I may be able to coach in the minors.
 
• I can apply for more promotions.
 
• My boss may like me more.
 
• My children will be impressed by my accomplishment.
 
• I will have graduated from high school.
 
✓ Envision how my life will change as I accomplish those goals:
 
• As a minor-league coach, my picture will be in the papers.
 
• I could become a manager at my company.
 
• I may be invited to lunch by my boss to discuss ideas.
 
• I could be invited to my children’s classes to talk about the importance of 
education.
 
• I will have a diploma to hang on the wall.
 
✓ Conclusion: “Of all my accomplishments, passing the GED tests will be the most impor-
tant because it will open doors that are closed to me now. The doors are open — 
 promotion, dreams, recognition — and that creates so many more possibilities.”
Notice how each main point becomes a paragraph. The subpoints you come up with during 
the drafting process form the sentences in each paragraph.
 
Each paragraph starts with an introductory sentence, which hints at what is to come, and 
ends with a transition sentence that leads from the paragraph you’re on to the next one. 
Your subpoints are your sentences within the paragraphs. If you put your sentences in a 
logical order from introduction to transition, you start to see paragraphs — as well as your 
essay — emerging.
Editing and revising
Now comes the hard part. You have to be your own editor. Turn off your ego and remember 
that every word is written on scratch paper, not carved in stone. Make your work better by 
editing and revising it. Make this the best piece of writing you’ve ever done — in a 45-minute 
time block, of course.

54
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
Rewriting
Neatly rewrite your edited work — in pen — in the proper place in the answer booklet. Two 
graders have to read this essay, so write neatly and clearly. Write large enough to be read. 
Leave some room between lines. Your essay has to be well written, but it also has to be 
readable. If you make a mistake, neatly cross it out and move on. Scratch-outs don’t count 
against you.
Practicing with some sample essays
To help you get a feel for how the essay grader evaluates your essay, take a look at the 
sample essay that follows. The sample essay is based on this essay topic:
The Worst Traffic Control Idea — Ever
Write an essay explaining the positive and/or negative aspects of this idea. Use exam-
ples to support your point of view and be as specific as possible.
Use the five criteria we explain in the “Looking at the writing skills Part II covers” section to 
mark up the essay, pointing out its strengths and weaknesses. Also keep in mind the character-
istics of a good essay that evaluators look for, which we list in the “Revealing some helpful 
pointers for Part II” section. (Check out www.acenet.edu/Content/NavigationMenu/ged/
etp/writing_2_test_descr.htm for more details on how essays on this test are graded.)
  
     We have all driven down a quiet residential street and without warning 
hit a bump in the road, so severe, that our teeth rattled. Well, we may have 
been going ever so slightly over the speed limit but needing dental work is 
not the usual punishment for speeding.
     Living in a society where unenforced laws get ignored has presented a 
problem in many areas. Just look at all the Ponzi schemes being uncovered 
all around the world. Wherever there has been no enforcement, there has 
been an increase in crime but a little bit of speeding is not that serious a 
crime. 
     In Jamaica they call speed bumps, “Sleeping Policemen” because they do 
the job of speed control without the police being present. In St. Maarten, 
they have installed them on highways to keep the speed down in 
dangerous areas. But here, in the United States, do we need these ugly 
bumps in the road? We all know that these are just a political solution to 
calm down voters who do not want speeding traffic through their 
neighborhood. No one seems to care about the negative aspects of these 
devices.
     Cars are most efficient at constant speed but speed bumps cause the 
driver to slow down and speed up all through the area, increasing pollution 
and wasting gas. Even bicyclists, the darlings of many city politicians, have 
trouble with speed bumps. If you go too fast over one of these bumps on a 
bicycle, you may become airborne and fly off your bicycle. That will do 
damage to your body.
     Speed bumps are hard to see and force drivers to take their eyes off the 
road. This causes a dangerous situation. Who knows what could pass in 
front of a car while the driver is looking carefully for the next bump which 
will shatter teeth and probably destroy the car’s suspension. Is there no 
justice for the driver on the roads?
Speed Bumps

Now that you have a sample essay to look at, try writing your essay that addresses the traf-
fic control topic. When you’re done, evaluate it using the same criteria you used to mark up 
the sample essay. Then write an essay on one of the following topics and mark it up in the 
same way (don’t forget to use your personal experience and knowledge for support):
 
✓ Should the Government Bail Out Industries?
 
✓ Video Games Teach People Many Skills
 
✓ One Job the Guidance Department Forgot to Tell Me about
 
✓ Reality Television is the Most Unreal Programming Available
Revealing some helpful pointers for Part II
In addition to evaluating the main criteria or skills we list in the “Looking at the writing skills 
Part II covers” section, essay graders look for the following characteristics in your essay (if 
you have all these characteristics, your chances of receiving a high score are pretty good):
 
✓ Main points that focus on the topic
 
✓ Clear and organized main points and subpoints — both in the paragraphs and through-
out the entire essay
 
✓ Logically and clearly developed ideas
 
✓ Transitions throughout the essay for a smooth flow between ideas
 
✓ Good vocabulary
 
✓ Proper punctuation
 
✓ Correct spelling
Knowing what essay graders are looking for in your essay can help you make sure you meet 
all their expectations. Here are a few other tips and ground rules you’d be wise to remem-
ber as you prepare for Part II of the Language Arts, Writing Test:
 
✓ You have only 45 minutes to write an essay of about 250 words based on a single topic. 
An essay usually consists of a number of paragraphs, each of which contains a topic sen-
tence stating a main idea or thought. Be sure each paragraph relates to the overall topic 
of the essay. And, for the most part, make sure to place a topic sentence at the beginning 
of each paragraph to help readers focus on the main point you want them to understand.
 
✓ You can prepare your essay by using the scratch paper provided. You’re given 
scratch paper at the test site. Use it to make notes and write down your rough work so 
that your final essay is well organized and neat. The graders don’t look at it, so what 
you write on the scratch paper is just for you.
 
✓ You must write about the topic and only about the topic. You’re graded for writing an 
essay on the topic, so make sure you really do write on the topic you’re given. One of 
the easiest ways to fail this test is to write about something that isn’t on topic.
 
 Keep in mind that the topic is always a brief one about an issue or situation that’s 
familiar to you.
 
✓ The essay tests your ability to write about an issue that has positive and/or negative 
implications but about which you have some general knowledge. The essay doesn’t 
test how much you know about a given topic; instead, it tests your ability to express 
yourself in writing.

56
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
 
✓ You need to use stuff from your life to make your points stronger. You’re writing an 
essay about you, your life, and your experiences, so don’t forget to use real examples 
to strengthen your main points. Specific examples and details support your point of 
view, so use them liberally.
 
✓ Effective paragraphs use a variety of sentence types: statements, questions, com-
mands, exclamations, and even quotations. Vary your sentence structure and choice 
of words to spark the readers’ interest. Some sentences may be short, and others may 
be long to catch the readers’ attention.
 
✓ Paragraphs create interest in several ways: by developing details, by using illustra-
tions and examples, by presenting events in a time or space sequence, by providing 
definitions, by classifying persons or objects, by comparing and contrasting, and by 
demonstrating reasons and proof. Organize your paragraphs and sentences in a way 
that both expresses your ideas and creates interest.
 
✓ The readers want to see that you can express your ideas clearly and logically. 
They’re also reading to make sure that you stick to the topic given.

Chapter 5
Practice Test — Language Arts, 
Writing Test: Parts I and II
T
he Language Arts, Writing Test measures your ability to use clear and effective English. 
It is a test of English as it should be written, not as it may be spoken. This test includes 
both multiple-choice questions and an essay. The following directions apply only to the 
multiple-choice section; a separate set of directions is given for the essay.
The multiple-choice section consists of documents with lettered paragraphs and numbered 
sentences. Some of the sentences contain an error in sentence structure, usage, or mechan-
ics (punctuation and capitalization). After reading the numbered sentences, answer the 
multiple-choice questions that follow. Some questions refer to sentences that are correct as 
written. The best answer for these questions is the one that leaves the sentence as origi-
nally written. The best answer for some questions is the one that produces a document that 
is consistent with the verb tense and point of view used throughout the text.
You have 120 minutes (2 hours) to complete both parts of the test. You can spend up to 
75 minutes on the 50 multiple-choice questions, leaving the remaining time for the essay. 
Work carefully, but do not spend too much time on any one question. Answer every ques-
tion. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers. You may begin working on the essay 
section of this test as soon as you complete the multiple-choice section.

the Needs Assessment Survey, including raising the profile of the industry and offering on-
site training programs, particularly in the areas of spotting and pressing. (7) A great deal of 
feasibility work was undertaken during this phase yet each possible training solution 
proved to be extremely difficult and costly to implement.

(8) As the Committee moved into its second year, it officially established a joint project with 
the National Fabricare Association to achieve goals in two priority areas: mentorship, train-
ing, and profile building.

You have 45 minutes to write on your assigned essay topic. If you have time remaining in 
this test period after you complete your essay, you may return to the multiple-choice sec-
tion. Do not return the Language Arts, Writing Test booklet until you finish both Parts I and 
II of the Language Arts, Writing Test.
Two evaluators will score your essay according to its overall effectiveness. Their evaluation 
will be based on the following features:
 
✓ Well-focused main points
 
✓ Clear organization
 
✓ Specific development of your ideas
 
✓ Control of sentence structure, punctuation, grammar, word choice, and spelling
REMEMBER, YOU MUST COMPLETE BOTH THE MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS (PART I) 
AND THE ESSAY (PART II) TO RECEIVE A SCORE ON THE LANGUAGE ARTS, WRITING 
TEST.
To avoid having to repeat both parts of the test, be sure to observe the following rules:
 
✓ Before you begin writing, jot notes or outline your essay on the sheets provided.
 
✓ For your final copy, write legibly in ink so that the evaluators will be able to read your 
writing.
 
✓ Write on the assigned topic. If you write on a topic other than the one assigned, you 
will not receive a score for the Language Arts, Writing Test.
 
✓ Write your essay on the lined pages of the separate answer sheet booklet. Only the 
writing on these pages will be scored.
Note that if you do not pass one portion of the test, you must take both parts over again.

Answers and Explanations for the 
Language Arts, Writing Test
A
fter taking the Language Arts, Writing Test in Chapter 5, use this chapter to check 
your answers. Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers 
for Part I that we provide in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed 
the answers you did. You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you 
answered correctly because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought 
process that helped you choose the correct answers.
Be sure to take a look at the sample essay we provide in the “Sample Essay for Part II” sec-
tion of this chapter. Compare your essay to the sample to get an idea of what score your 
essay may have received on the real test.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key for Part 
I of the Language Arts, Writing Test.
Analysis of the Answers for Part I
 
1. 1. Change you’re (which means “you are”) to your. Your indicates ownership of the new 
company, which is the meaning you want. The other choices are either grammatically 
incorrect or do nothing to make the sentence clearer.
 
2. 3. The verb tense must be the singular was, not the plural were. Singular subjects always 
take singular verbs.
 
3. 2. The sentence needs a comma after operation to separate the introductory adverb 
clause.
 
4. 5. Homonyms are words that sound alike but are spelled differently and have different 
meanings, such as then and than. The correct word to use in this sentence is than. Than is 
used for comparisons, while then refers to time sequences. Because this sentence needs a 
word that indicates a comparison, than is the correct answer.
 
5. 1. Although you can revise this sentence in many ways, the answer that makes the most 
sense is “Thirteen new jobs will be created, returning half a million dollars to the local 
economy.” This change improves the organization of the sentence.
 
6. 3. Equipment is the correct spelling.
 
 To improve your spelling skills, read as much as you can before you take the GED 
Language Arts, Writing Test, Part I. Seeing words spelled correctly (as you do when you 
read published works) is a great way to help you recognize when words are misspelled on 
this test.

82
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
 
7. 5. The sentence is correct. No changes are needed, so the answer is no correction required.
 
 Some sentences on the test are correct. Don’t correct grammar and punctuation if the 
sentence looks right to you.
 
8. 2. To improve the sentence structure, insert particularly (an adverb modifying interested) 
before interested. This change makes the sentence easier to read and understand.
 
9. 4. You need a comma after BETA to separate the introductory adverb phrase from the rest 
of the sentence.
 
10. 4. Correct the spelling error: Change assistence to assistance.
 
11. 1. Apostrophes have two uses: to take the place of a missing letter or to indicate possession. 
You need to add an apostrophe before the s in BETA because it’s a singular possessive. 
The text indicates that the product belonging to BETA is reconditioned Italian café 
equipment, which means you need the apostrophe to show this relationship.
 
12. 4. You need to eliminate the extra apostrophe in this sentence. The correct form of the 
word is initial.
 
13. 1. You need a colon after machines to indicate to readers that a list is coming.
 
14. 1. The sentence “Direct sales and marketing will take time, because establishing a network 
of distributors will be the priority in year one” isn’t easy to understand, and it doesn’t flow 
easily off the tongue. Phrases starting with because usually make more sense at the beginning 
of the sentence. You can then write, “Because establishing a network of distributors will be 
the priority in year one, direct sales and marketing will take time.” Because the meaning 
of the second section flows from the meaning of the first section, this sentence is an 
improvement from the original.
 
15. 3. The singular noun workforce doesn’t belong with the plural verb are. The subject and 
verb in a sentence must always agree, so you need to use the singular verb is rather than 
the plural are.
 
16. 4. Too means “also,” which isn’t what you need in this sentence. Replace too with to.
 
 Before taking the GED Language Arts, Writing Test, Part I, study a list of homonyms — 
words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings. Several 
incorrect homonyms are thrown into the test to assess your ability to differentiate 
between them.
 
17. 2. Correct the homonym spelling error from soled to sold. Sold, the word you want to use, 
is the past tense of sell.
 
18. 1. The sentence “The initial mix of leasing and sales is estimated to be 20 percent leasing 
and 80 percent sales for the first year” has a problem because it could be misunderstood. 
The best way to correct this sentence is to change it around to read, “The initial mix of 
leasing and sales for the first year is estimated to be 20 percent leasing and 80 percent 
sales.” When you read a sentence and words are out of order or make reading awkward, go 
back and correct them.
 
19. 5. Because the sentence is talking about price, add the word price to clarify the meaning.
 
20. 2. Changing the sentence to read trade-ins, while the balance improves the sentence 
structure. Another way to correct the original sentence is to replace the comma with a 
semicolon; however, because that’s not an answer given, you must pick Choice (2).
 
21. 2. Avoid the overly long and complex sentence, “Over the past two years, the Drycleaning 
and Laundering Industry Adjustment Committee has worked hard to become a cohesive 
group focused on assessing and addressing the human resource implications in the 
fabricare industry.” To improve it, create two new sentences, such as the following: “Over 

83
 Chapter 6: Answers and Explanations for the Language Arts, Writing Test
the past two years, the Drycleaning and Laundering Industry Adjustment Committee has 
worked hard to become a cohesive group. It has focused on assessing and addressing the 
human resource implications in the fabricare industry.”
 
22. 5. Remove over to clarify the meaning of the sentence. If you know that the group has 29 
members (or however many it has over 15), say so.
 
23. 3. The sentence in question says that the committee has great difficulty speaking in one 
voice, which may be true. However, a more accurate statement is that the industry has 
great difficulty speaking in one voice. You know this statement is true because the 
sentence given describes the industry as fragmented. A better organization for the sentence 
is, “The Committee has taken responsibility for undertaking actions that will benefit this 
large, highly fragmented industry, which has great difficulty speaking with one voice.”
 
24. 2. Outreaching isn’t a verb; reaching out is.
 
25. 5. No correction is required because none of the other options improves the sentence.
 
 Are you thinking that we made a mistake in the sentence just above? Well, we didn’t; it’s 
correct. The noun none goes with the verb improves. The prepositional phrase of the other 
options doesn’t determine how the noun and verb agree. None is a singular noun and, 
therefore, goes with improves, not improve. If this situation comes up on your test, replace 
none with not one (in your head), ignore any prepositional phrases between none and the 
verb, and see whether not one agrees with the verb given.
 
26. 2. The sentence “During the first year, the Committee explored ways of meeting the needs 
identified in the Needs Assessment Survey including raising the profile of the industry and 
offering on-site training programs, particularly in the areas of spotting and pressing” is 
simply too long to be understood. Find a logical place to break it into two sentences. The 
first part of the sentence discusses the uses of the Needs Assessment Survey; the second 
discusses the type of training. You can split the sentence into two smaller, more easily 
understood, sentences, as follows: “During the first year, the Committee explored ways of 
meeting the needs identified in the Needs Assessment Survey. These included raising the 
profile of the industry and offering on-site training programs, particularly in the areas of 
spotting and pressing.”
 
27. 4. Insert a comma after phase to improve the sentence structure because this compound 
sentence is joined by the conjunction yet and needs the comma to ensure that the two 
thoughts remain separate.
 
 A compound sentence contains two independent clauses or thoughts. The clauses have to 
be separated by a conjunction like but or yet, and the conjunction needs a comma before it.
 
28. 4. This answer is a gimme: Three priority areas are listed, not two.
 
29. 2. Correct the homonym spelling error from passed to past.
 
30. 5. The introductory clause needs a colon at the end.
 
 If you thought the items in the list needed semicolons, they can have them or not, depending 
on house style (the style used and followed religiously by the company or publishing house 
writing or editing the text). However, if you use semicolons, you need to use them at the 
end of each component in the list, which isn’t an answer choice.
 
31. 2. The phrase as a component of the PLAR is unnecessary.
 
32. 4. You need a comma after in addition.
 
 Not sure about commas? Check out English Grammar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by 
Geraldine Woods (Wiley) for the lowdown on this sometimes tricky form of punctuation.

84
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
 
33. 1. Their is possessive (showing belonging) and is the correct choice in this sentence. 
Correct the spelling error from there to their.
 
 The homonyms, there, their, and they’re probably trip up more high school and college 
students than any other homonyms. Before heading into the GED Language Arts, Writing 
Test, Part I, know the differences between these three words!
 
34. 5. Intense and concentrated are synonyms used in this sentence for emphasis, but intense is 
misspelled as intents. Intents is where you sleep on a camping trip.
 
35. 3. The clause who score low in the pre-test is a restrictive clause, which means it refers to a 
specific noun — candidates in this case — and specifies something about the noun that the 
sentence needs to make sense to readers. Restrictive clauses aren’t separated by commas 
because they’re an integral part of the sentence.
 
 Contrast the restrictive clause with the nonrestrictive clause, which adds information about 
the noun that isn’t essential to the meaning of the sentence. If you remove a nonrestrictive 
clause from the sentence, you can still fully understand the meaning of the sentence. 
Nonrestrictive clauses require commas to separate them from the sentence.
 
36. 3. Those who score extremely well is the best order of the words. Extremely, an adverb, is 
best placed next to the word it modifies, which is well.
 
37. 4. Correct the error in the spelling of re-mediation.
 
 Although exceptions exist, when a prefix that ends in a vowel (as re- does) precedes a 
consonant, no hyphen is used. In many (but not all) cases, when a prefix that ends in a 
vowel precedes another vowel, a hyphen is used.
 
38. 1. When two adjectives (like post and secondary in the example) combine to modify one 
noun, they’re almost always hyphenated. Keep in mind, however, that when an adverb and 
adjective (such as newly formed) combine to modify a noun, they’re usually not hyphenated.
 
 If you have trouble remembering this rule, keep in mind that words ending in –ly and 
forming two-word adjectives are almost never hyphenated. As you probably already know, 
English usage can be strange and irrational. There are many exceptions to rules and 
probably just as many rules about exceptions. Style manuals can help you write correctly 
in particular areas of writing.
 
39. 2. The sentence “Students will learn methods for documenting prior knowledge and will 
develop skills while becoming reacquainted with educational environments and developing 
skills needed to succeed in such environments” is complex and redundant. Delete the 
entire phrase and developing skills needed to succeed in such environments.
 
 Unless you’re being paid by the word, always try to say what you mean in as few words as 
possible.
 
40. 5. This sentence contains a spelling error. Correct the spelling error by changing counciling 
to counseling.
 
41. 1. Although the word both refers to two options, here, you’re given only one option — 
challenges. If you insert and opportunities between challenges and never, you include a 
second option and correct the sentence.
 
42. 3. An organization is never a who; only people can be referred to as who. An organization is 
a collective noun made up of people, but the collective noun itself is an impersonal entity 
and doesn’t qualify as a who.
 
 Although the sentence may appear long and, therefore, may benefit from rewriting, the 
sentence isn’t technically incorrect. Although commas do serve to make sentences clearer, 
you don’t want to insert them unless punctuation rules make them correct.
 
43. 2. CanLearn Study Tours is a single entity because it’s one company. Therefore, it’s a 
singular noun and needs the singular verb has instead of the plural have.

85
 Chapter 6: Answers and Explanations for the Language Arts, Writing Test
 
 People like to refer to companies as them when, in fact, a company is always an it. Even 
though a company is made up of a lot of people, it’s still a singular entity.
 
44. 2. You need to insert a colon before the list to introduce it.
 
45. 5. The options presented either make the sentence difficult to understand or introduce 
errors, so the correct answer is no correction required.
 
46. 4. A stray apostrophe has landed on this sentence. The one after organizations’ is 
unnecessary because you’re not trying to show possession here.
 
 Get comfortable with the uses of apostrophes — especially those used for possession — 
before taking the GED Language Arts, Writing Test, Part I. See Chapter 3 for more info.
 
47. 2. Correct the spelling error by changing soarce to source.
 
48. 3. Formats is plural, but has is a singular verb. Verbs and their subjects must agree.
 
 Study both subject-verb agreement and pronoun-antecedent agreement before taking the 
Language Arts, Writing Test.
 
49. 2. Correct the spelling error by changing insured to ensured.
 
 Using insure is a common error. Use insure only when you mean the thing you buy to 
protect your car, house, health, life, and so on. This example has nothing to do with 
insurance, so use ensure, instead.
 
50. 5. No correction is required. The other choices don’t improve or correct the sentence.

Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
  
Hiking is a hobby I can recommend to anyone. Being outdoors, getting 
exercise, and spending quiet time alone are all facets of hiking that make it 
unique in today’s mostly indoor, sedentary — and yet overly busy — life. 
Many areas — even large cities — offer parks with dirt or grass paths that 
are perfect for a daily hike.
Hiking gets me outdoors, away from potentially harmful indoor air. Too 
much time indoors cuts humans off from the sun, which is vital to mental 
health, and can also lead to allergies or other illnesses from too much 
exposure to chemicals and other products that are trapped indoors. Just an 
hour per day of hiking can counteract many of the effects of spending too 
much time indoors.
Hiking is also great exercise, because it works the heart, lungs, and leg 
muscles without adding stress to the knees and other joints. You can hike in 
your street clothes (although a good pair of hiking boots is a good idea), so 
hiking does not require the investment in gear that many forms of exercise 
do.
Perhaps the best — and most unique — feature of hiking, however, is that 
it provides solace from our loud, fast-paced, materialistic world. When 
hiking — even in or near a large, metropolitan area — I see deer, listen to 
birdsongs, and watch squirrels busy with their work. Without the constant 
sound of a TV or radio in the background, I can focus on my own thoughts 
instead of on what is expected by society and promoted by advertisers. 
While on the trail, I can focus on the natural beauty around me instead of 
worrying about bills or comparing myself to others. This quiet disconnection 
from society helps me remember what is important in life.
In short, hiking helps me break free of the work-a-day world by getting 
me outside to appreciate nature, encouraging me to exercise, and giving me 
long periods of restful silence. I recommend hiking to anyone.
After reading through the sample essay once, reread it and answer the following questions 
about it:
 
✓ Is there a series of main points in this essay that clearly relate to the topic? (Underline 
the main points to check.)
 
✓ Does each paragraph have an introductory sentence or thought?
 
✓ Does each paragraph have a concluding sentence or thought?
 
✓ Are the sentences within each paragraph well organized?
 
✓ Are the paragraphs organized in a natural flow from beginning to end? In other words, 
does each paragraph build on the previous one and lead to the next one?
 
✓ Have the ideas in the given topic and the first paragraph been developed throughout 
the essay?
 
✓ Are all the sentences grammatically correct?
 
✓ Are all the sentences properly structured?
 
✓ Are all the sentences correctly punctuated?
 
✓ Are all the words used correctly?
 
✓ Are all the words spelled correctly?

87
 Chapter 6: Answers and Explanations for the Language Arts, Writing Test
As far as this particular sample essay is concerned, a test evaluator would probably have 
given it a high score because it has all the attributes of a good essay that we list earlier in 
this section. It isn’t perfect, but no one’s asking you to write a perfect essay. Look over the 
list of characteristics the readers are looking for, and try to determine whether your practice 
essay satisfies those requirements. If you can impose on a friend, ask him or her to answer 
the questions we list here about your essay. If you or your friend answers no to any questions, 
rewrite your essay until you and your friend can answer yes.
 
Your essay shouldn’t be just a collection of grammatically correct sentences that flow from 
beginning to end. Rather, your essay needs to be interesting and even entertaining to read. 
After all, no one — not even professional test graders — wants to read a boring essay!
The evaluators don’t know you, so make sure you wow them when you write the essay, 
especially your conclusion. When you’re finished writing your essay, read it over to ensure 
it makes sense and you use correct spelling and grammar.

Another Practice Test — Language Arts, 
Writing Test: Parts I and II
T
he Language Arts, Writing Test measures your ability to use clear and effective English. 
It is a test of English as it should be written, not as it may be spoken. This test includes 
both multiple-choice questions and an essay. The following directions apply only to the 
multiple-choice section; a separate set of directions is given for the essay.
The multiple-choice section consists of documents with lettered paragraphs and numbered 
sentences. Some of the sentences contain an error in sentence structure, usage, or mechanics 
(punctuation and capitalization). After reading the numbered sentences, answer the 
multiple-choice questions that follow. Some questions refer to sentences that are correct as 
written. The best answer for these questions is the one that leaves the sentence as originally 
written. The best answer for some questions is the one that produces a document that is 
consistent with the verb tense and point of view used throughout the text.
You have 120 minutes (2 hours) to complete both parts of the test. You can spend up to 
75 minutes on the 50 multiple-choice questions, leaving the remaining time for the essay. 
Work carefully, but do not spend too much time on any one question. Answer every 
question. You will not be penalized for incorrect answers. You may begin working on the 
essay section of this test as soon as you complete the multiple-choice section.

Fix the Problem
(1) This step requires you to listen to each customers assessment of the problem. (2) Your 
job when she explains the situation from her perspective is to fully absorb what she is 
saying about her unique set of circumstances. (3) After you identify the customer’s problem, 
the next step, obviously, is to fix it. (4) Sometimes, you can easily remedy the situation by 
changing an invoice, redoing an order, waving or refunding charges, or replacing a defective 
product. (5) At other times fixing the problem is more complex because the damage or 
mistake cannot be repaired simply. (6) In these instances, mutually exceptable compromises 
need to be reached.
(7) Whatever the problem, this step begins to remedy the situation and gives the customer 
what she needs to resolve the source of the conflict. (8) Don’t waste time and effort by 
putting the horse before the cart and trying to fix the wrong problem. (9) Its easy to jump 
the gun and think that you know what the customer is about to say because you’ve heard it 
all a hundred times before. (10) Doing so loses you ground on the recovery front and farther 
annoys the customer. (11) More often than not, what you think the problem is at first 
glance, is different from what it becomes upon closer examination.
Directions: Choose the one best answer to each question.

Executive Summary
KWIK Stop Auto Center
The correct approach for the 21st century
(1) Back in 1978, Morris James, President and Founder of KWIK Stop Auto Center, 
foresaw changes necessary for the automotive-service industry. (2) The market was 
becoming much more sophisticated. (3) Combined with 5 years’ experience as a 
licensed mechanic and owner/operator of a repair facility, this knowledge, led to the 
opening of KWIK Stop Auto Center’s first location.
(4) Morris James analyzed the “fast food” concept of providing high quality merchan-
dize at affordable prices. (5) This concept combined with speedy service helped the 
industry grow every year. (6) Morris decided that the same principals should be 
applied to the automotive industry, and he started KWIK Stop as the first logical step.
(7) In 1987, Morris was relocated to Woodbridge and began searching for a new shop 
site to begin franchising. (8) The opening of a concord franchise became very profit-
able and proved Morris’s theory to be correct. (9) He then opened the corporate 
store having established the validity of the concept in Wellesley, in 1991.
(10) Now the challenge is to develop the corporate store in a way that it can not only 
function in its capacity as a profit center but also be used as a hands-on training 
center for future franchise owners.
(11) The start up costs will require some initial investment, but will be regained 
within the first three years. (12) We will look at this situation more in-depth within 
the plan. (13) The addition of a wide selection of accessories, for the customer, will 
broaden the impact of this new concept.

The Customer Chain
(1) The relationship among internal customers and external customers is what forms the 
customer chain. (2) If you have a back room kind of job where you see the light of day, 
rarely, you can easily begin to feel that your work has little or no impact on external 
customers. (3) But if you look at the bigger picture, you can see that everyone in a company 
plays some part in fulfilling the customers needs. (4) Barely an hour goes by during the day 
when you are not, in some form or another, providing somebody for something. (5) Each 
interaction with an internal customer is an important link in a chain of events that always 
end up at the external customer’s feet.
(6) About two years ago, The Wall Street Journal ran an article entitled, Poorly treated 
employees treat the customer just as poorly. (7) We had dealed with a frightening percentage 
of managers who do not realize that their staffs are their internal customers. (8) That the 
quality of service that a company provides to its customers — we are convinced — is a 
direct reflection of how the staff of the company are treated by their managers. (9) View 
your staff members as some of your most important customers and treat them accordingly.

Answers and Explanations for the 
Language Arts, Writing Test
A
fter taking the Language Arts, Writing Test in Chapter 7, use this chapter to check 
your answers. Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers 
for Part I that we provide in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed 
the answers you did. You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you 
answered correctly because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought 
process that helped you choose the correct answers.
Be sure to take a look at the sample essay we provide in the “Sample Essay for Part II” sec-
tion of this chapter. Compare your essay to the sample to get an idea of what score your 
essay may have received on the real test.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key for Part 
I of the Language Arts, Writing Test.
Analysis of the Answers for Part I
 
1. 4. The assessment belongs to each customer and requires a possessive form of customer: 
customer’s. The other answers are neither correct nor do they improve the sentence.
 
2. 1. The meaning of this sentence is that the clerk should listen to the customer, so put the 
most important information first. The best way to start this sentence is with the When she 
explains the situation from her perspective phrase.
 
3. 3. Waving means to motion with the hand, while waive means to dismiss. It may be 
interesting to wave at a charge, but the proper meaning of the sentence is to dismiss (or 
not collect) the charge. These two words are homonyms (words that sound the same but 
have different spellings and meanings). You are expected to understand most homonyms 
for this test.
 
4. 3. The only place you can use a comma in this sentence is after the introductory phrase At 
other times.
 
5. 4. Exceptable may sound like a word, but it’s not. The correct word to use is acceptable.
 
 The more reading you do as you prepare for the test, the better your chances are for 
recognizing misspellings.
 
6. 1. A gift for you: No correction is required.
 
 If you chose Choice (5), keep in mind that this sentence has one subject and two verbs. 
These types of sentences don’t require a comma between the two verbs. Not sure about 
subjects and verbs? Here, the subject is step and the two verbs are begins and gives. If the 
sentence had a second subject before the second verb, it would need a comma.
 
7. 2. If you live anywhere near Amish country, you know that the horse comes before the 
cart. Or you may have heard the idiomatic expression, “Don’t put the cart before the 
horse.” In either case, the proper correction is to reverse the order of horse and cart.

110
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
 
8. 4. Its is possessive (meaning that it shows that something belongs to it), while it’s stands 
for “it is.” Here, the sentence clearly means “it is.”
 
 Confusing these two words is a common error that’s usually tested in some way. 
Master the difference between its and it’s. It’s means “it is” and is often confused with the 
possessive form of other words that use the apostrophe.
 
9. 3. Farther always refers to distance. Further is a matter of degree. Here, you want degree, 
not distance.
 
 If you didn’t know the answer, this question is a good example of one that you could 
answer by intelligent guessing. Choice (1) isn’t correct because looses isn’t a word. Choice 
(2) doesn’t make sense in the context of the sentence. Choice (4) isn’t right because the 
person losing ground is you, and because you don’t own the ground, you don’t want to use 
a possessive. Now you just have to guess between Choices (3) and (5).
 
10. 2. Commas used in moderation help sentences. Extra commas hurt sentences. A comma is 
never used to separate a subject from a verb.
 
11. 3. In the letter, the York Square Employment Resource Center is a title; as such, all words 
(except prepositions and articles) are capitalized.
 
12. 1. Moving since April 2002 is the only good answer here. The current sentence sounds as 
though the training programs have been in existence since April 2002 when, in fact, the 
partnership has been in existence since that time.
 
13. 4. Most (although not all) lists begin with a colon. You don’t need semicolons after the 
items in the list (the bullets serve as separators). You need a comma after the introductory 
phrase, which eliminates Choice (1), and you don’t separate a direct object from an 
indirect object with a comma, which eliminates Choice (5).
 
14. 1. No correction is required.
 
15. 2. The subject of the sentence is fact, which is singular, but the verb is are, which is plural. 
Verbs must agree with their subjects.
 
16. 3. In its current form, this sentence forces the reader to pause too long and remember too 
much. Rewriting it as “She has pursued her responsibilities with a high degree of professional 
competence and efficiency” is far more straightforward.
 
17. 1. As is, this sentence is a run-on sentence. To make it a compound sentence, all you have 
to do is add a comma after Peta.
 
18. 2. The word shoppe is quaint, but it isn’t common usage. If you were living in Williamsburg 
200 years ago, the answer would be different. Today, people use the shorter and more 
common shop.
 
19. 1. Before the change, the first sentence is missing a verb, making it an incomplete 
sentence. Choice (2) is incorrect because state-of-the-art is acting as a single adjective to 
copiers, and multiword adjectives are nearly always hyphenated. Choice (4) is incorrect 
because the first sentence is clearly describing the store, not the copiers.
 
20. 5. No change is required in this sentence. The copy shop may want to consider changing 
the way it hires and trains its staff, but that’s another matter altogether.
 
21. 3. Lists have to be parallel. In this case, you have apologizing, explaining, and gave, which 
aren’t parallel (all three are verbs, but the first two are gerunds, while the second is an 
infinitive). Changing gave to giving makes the list parallel.
 
22. 2. This is a classic run-on sentence, so you need to break it apart into separate sentences (in 
this case, three separate sentences). A good change is as follows: “Okay, I thought, fair enough. 
They’re new and getting their act together. No big deal.” (Note that the third sentence doesn’t 
appear to have a verb, but the implied subject and verb are it is, as in “It is no big deal.”)
 
23. 1. The correct answer is to add a comma after later. Most of the time, you want to set off an 
introductory clause with a comma; however, be aware that when the introductory clause is 
very short, the convention isn’t always clear: Some people use the comma and others don’t. 
On this test, however, you’re always better off putting a comma after any introductory clause.

111
 Chapter 8: Answers and Explanations for the Language Arts, Writing Test
 
24. 3. Change apologised to apologized, which is the correct spelling. The other answer 
choices do nothing to improve the sentence.
 
25. 1. Add a comma after the introductory phrase. See the answer explanation to Question 23 
for further details.
 
26. 3. Whenever a sentence has two clauses, each with a subject and a verb, a comma has to 
separate them. In this sentence, I went back is a clause that has both a subject (I) and a verb 
(went). The clause and the same thing happened again also has a subject (thing) and a verb 
(happened). Two weeks later is an introductory phrase that requires a comma after later.
 
27. 5. This answer is a gift. The sentence is correct as is.
 
 A point of interest with this sentence is that it uses one of the dreaded two/to/too words. 
These words are all homonyms: words that sound the same but have different spellings 
and meanings. Here, the use of too is correct, but be sure you put these three words on 
your list of homonyms to study.
 
28. 4. My opinion is a singular subject that needs a singular verb. Were is a plural verb and 
must be changed to the singular form was. Don’t let that prepositional phrase of their 
services throw you off track. Just act as if that part of the sentence weren’t there.
 
 If you have trouble with singular and plural verbs and subject-verb agreement, try 
changing the subject into a pronoun. This sentence would become It were, which sounds 
wrong. Changing it to It was sounds right. Trust your ears.
 
 One exception to the “it sounds right” rule is the subjunctive form of verbs. Whenever 
something is contrary to fact, you use were with singular subjects. For example, “If I were 
taller” is correct. Look for terms and phrases like if, I wish, and if only: These words are 
usually followed by the subjunctive form of the verb.
 29. 4. This question is a good example of when using elimination can help you get the right 
answer. Choice (1) introduces the wrong verb tense. Choice (2) introduces a punctuation 
error because the comma is needed. Choice (3) introduces another punctuation error: 
This comma is also needed. When you plug in Choice (4), the sentence reads more 
smoothly, so you know you have a winner.
 
30. 1. Choice (1) is the only option of all the ones presented that is correct in terms of both 
verb form and meaning. Choices (2), (3), and (5) all introduce errors in verb form; Choice 
(4) changes the sentence to present tense, which then changes its meaning.
 
31. 4. The words this knowledge are out of place, but they’re necessary to the sentence 
because they add to the meaning of the sentence. You can improve the sentence by 
moving This knowledge to the front of the sentence and changing Combined to combined. 
Another way to change the sentence is to simply remove the comma after knowledge 
(because subjects and verbs are never separated by commas), but that option isn’t an 
answer choice.
 
32. 2. This sentence contains a spelling mistake. Change merchandize to merchandise.
 
33. 1. This sentence is badly in need of a comma transfusion. It should read “This concept, 
combined with speedy service, helped the industry grow every year.” These two little 
commas help the sentence by separating the phrase combined with speedy service from the 
rest of the sentence.
 
34. 1. This sentence is fairly long and seems to ramble, but none of the options offers a way to 
split it into two. However, the sentence does have an error: Schools have principals; people 
and businesses (you hope!) have principles. These two words are homonyms, meaning that 
they sound alike but have different meanings and spellings.
 
35. 4. You should change the underlined phrase to relocated. The other answer choices 
introduce new errors.
 
36. 1. From the context of the passage, you can assume Concord is a town or city and 
deserves a capital letter at the beginning of the word.

112
Part II: Minding Your Ps and Qs: The Language Arts, Writing Test 
 
37. 2. The sentence is supposed to say that he (Morris James) had established the validity of 
the concept before (in 1991) and then (later) he wanted to establish a corporate store. 
Rewriting the sentence like this is clearer: “Having established the validity of the concept 
in Wellesley in 1991, he then opened the corporate store.” The other answer choices don’t 
maintain this meaning.
 
 Choice (4) may look good, but it changes the meaning of the sentence. He didn’t open the 
corporate store in 1991; he established the validity of the concept in 1991.
 
38. 5. Okay, this sentence is really long, but, technically, nothing is wrong with it. If you had 
the option of splitting it into two sentences, you’d want to do so. But because you’re not 
given that option and all the other options are incorrect, leave it as is.
 
39. 2. Here, start up is acting as an adjective for costs. Most multiword adjectives are hyphenated.
 
 If you chose Choice (3), you must’ve thought that the second half of the sentence had a 
second subject. If so, reread that part of the sentence to try to find the subject. It’s not 
there. This is a sentence with one subject (cost) and two verbs (will require and will be 
regained). A sentence like this one, with only one subject and two verbs, doesn’t require a 
comma. If it had a second subject before the second verb, it would need a comma.
 
40. 3. Changing the phrase to in more depth improves the sentence structure. The other 
answer choices don’t really make much sense when you plug them into the sentence.
 
41. 1. Moving on the customer to the end of the sentence improves the sentence organization 
by placing the direct object (the impact) closer to the second indirect object (the customer). 
(What’s the first indirect object? This new concept.)
 
 If you chose Choice (5), you essentially said that the customer would have a wide selection 
of accessories added to him or her.
 
42. 1. Among is used when comparing three or more entities; between is used to compare only 
two things. Here, you have two types of customers, so between is correct.
 
43. 3. Where you rarely see the light of day is an improved word order because you want the adverb 
(in this case, rarely) to be as close as possible to the verb it modifies (in this case, see).
 
44. 1. The needs belong to the customers, so you need to make customers possessive by 
making it customers’.
 
45. 2. Providing somebody for something doesn’t make sense. You don’t provide people for 
things; rather, you provide things for people.
 
46. 4. Examine the phrase that always end up. What’s the phrase referring to? Important link, 
right? Yes, but link is singular, so you don’t say, link . . . end. Instead, you say link . . . ends.
 
47. 1. “Poorly treated employees treat the customer just as poorly” is the title of a newspaper 
article and must be in quotation marks. Names of newspapers are in italics, while the stories 
that are run in them are placed in quotes.
 
 The idea of the entire work (the newspaper) being in italics, while the inner works (the 
articles) are in quotes extends to other situations, as well. For example, a book title is in 
italics, while the name of each chapter is in quotes. A TV series is in italics, while the name 
of each episode is in quotes.
 
48. 3. This sentence has two related problems. First, the past tense of deal is dealt, not dealed. 
Second, according to the context in the passage, you know that this action began in the 
past and continues in the present. You can indicate that timeline by using have. On the 
other hand, using had means that the action began in the past and also stopped in the 
past — in other words, that it isn’t continuing today.
 
49. 2. Putting we are convinced in the middle of the sentence interrupts the main point of the 
sentence — to point out a specific cause-and-effect relationship.
 
50. 5. A final gift for you — no correction is needed, and all the other answer choices make the 
sentence worse.

✓ Correct grammar
 
✓ Necessary punctuation
 
✓ Appropriate use of words
 
✓ Correct spelling
Although every essay will be unique, we provide a sample here to give you a better idea of 
what the test graders expect to see in your essay. Compare the structure of this essay to yours.
Cellphones make life easier
     My children and I recently signed up for a family-rate calling plan      complete with four
separate phones and phone numbers      so that we could communicate more easily.  Although
I put off the purchase for several years, thinking that having a cellphone would make me so
accessible to others that I would never get any time to myself, the truth is, the phones have
made all of our lives easier. 
     My three children attend three different schools.  The youngest, Doug, is in the 4th grade and
takes a free acting class year-round at the local playhouse.  His lessons run from 4:00 to 5:00
three days per week, but he can sometimes catch rides home with other children in the class.
Because I work until 5:30, my oldest daughter, Sydney, who is a junior in high school, waits for
him to call to tell her whether he needs a ride.  Before we had cellphones, Doug always had to 
find a working pay phone, and Sydney had to wait by the phone at home.
     The middle child, Maggie, is in eighth grade and plays three sports: soccer, basketball, and
track.  I can usually pick her up from practice on my way home from work, but her practices
end at different times every day.  While she, too, used to have to hunt down a pay phone and
call me at work, now she just calls and lets me know where she’ll be waiting.  I can run errands
while I wait for her call instead of waiting at work or by the curb at her school.
     The best part of the phones, though, is that whenever people want to reach any of the four of
us, they call the number for the individual, not the entire family.  I no longer answer the phone
for all of Doug’s, Maggie’s, and Sydney’s friends, and people trying to reach me no longer get a 
busy signal.
     For us, cellphones are the ultimate convenience.  In fact, we like our cellphones so much that 
we no longer have regular phone service in our home.

Part III
Finding Your Way: The 
Social Studies Test

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you find questions, questions, and more 
questions about social studies in the form of sample 
test questions — but, lucky for you, you also get the answers 
and explanations. In addition, this part explains what skills 
the Social Studies Test expects you to know, what subject 
areas the test covers, and how the test is laid out so you 
get a better idea of what you need to do to get good marks 
on the test. It also offers you some helpful strategies you 
can use to do your best on the test.
Before taking the actual Social Studies Test, take the two 
practice tests in this part to determine how well you’ve 
mastered the required skills in social studies. Pretend 
they’re real tests by timing yourself, following the instruc-
tions, and asking someone to act as the test administrator 
to keep you honest (if you can find someone willing to 
help). The closer you come to mimicking the real test con-
ditions, the more you get out of practicing here and in all 
the other tests.

A Graph, a Map, and You: 
Getting Ready for the Social Studies Test
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what the Social Studies Test covers and how it’s formatted
▶ Surveying the types of questions on this test and knowing how to prepare for them
▶ Using strategies that achieve the best results
▶ Managing your time for this test and looking at sample problems
D
o you enjoy knowing about how events in the past may help you foretell the future? 
Do the lives of people in faraway places interest you? Are politics something you care 
about? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re going to like social studies! 
After all, social studies helps you discover how humans relate to their environment and to 
other people. This overarching area of study includes subjects like history, government, 
geography, and economics.
The GED Social Studies Test assesses your skills in understanding and interpreting concepts 
and principles in history, geography, economics, and civics. Consider this test as a kind of 
crash course in where you’ve been, where you are, and how you can continue living there. 
You can apply the types of skills tested in the Social Studies Test to your experience in 
visual, academic, and workplace situations as a citizen, a consumer, or an employee. This 
test includes questions drawn from a variety of written and visual passages taken from 
academic and workplace materials, as well as from primary and secondary sources. The 
passages in this test are like the ones you read or see in most daily newspapers and news 
magazines. Reading either or both of these news sources regularly can help you become 
familiar with the style and vocabulary of the passages you find here.
The information in this chapter helps you prepare for the Social Studies Test.
Looking at the Skills the Social 
Studies Test Covers
The GED Social Studies Test requires you to draw on your previous knowledge of events, 
ideas, terms, and situations that may be related to social studies. From a big-picture 
perspective, the Social Studies Test and the skills it measures break down like this:
 
✓ 20 percent: Relates to your ability to identify information and ideas and interpret their 
meaning.
 
✓ 20 percent: Assesses your ability to use the information and ideas in different ways to 
explore their meanings or solve a problem.

118
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
 
✓ 40 percent: Measures your ability to use the information or ideas to do the following:
 
• Determine the difference between facts and opinions.
 
• Arrive at conclusions using material.
 
• Influence other people’s attitudes.
 
• Find other meanings or mistakes in logic.
 
• Identify causes and their effects.
 
• Recognize a writer’s historical point of view.
 
• Compare and contrast differing views and opinions.
 
• Determine what impact these views and opinions may have both at this time and 
in the future.
 
✓ 20 percent: Measures your ability to make judgments about the material’s appropriate-
ness, accuracy, and differences of opinion, as well as the role information and ideas 
play in influencing current and future decision making. These questions ask you to 
think about issues and events that affect you every day. That fact alone is interesting 
and has the potential to make you a more informed citizen of the modern world. What 
a bonus for a test!
Being aware of what skills the Social Studies Test covers can help you get a more accurate 
picture of the types of questions you’ll encounter. The next section focuses more on the 
specific subject materials you’ll face in this test.
Understanding the Test Format
The Social Studies Test contains 50 multiple-choice questions that you must answer in 
70 minutes, which means you have less than 11⁄2 minutes per question. These 50 questions 
check your knowledge in the following subject areas:
 
✓ American history (25 percent; 12 or 13 questions): You may have to read passages 
about the American Revolution, the Civil War, colonization, reconstruction, settlement, 
industrial development, or the Great Depression — and answer questions about them, 
of course. If you didn’t have to answer questions, reading these passages would be a 
dream assignment because American history can be a lot of fun.
 
 To practice for this section of the test, read articles and books about historical events 
and trends. Remember that 60 percent of these questions are based on visual passages, 
including illustrations, maps, and charts, so take a look at those, too. With practice, 
you can learn to read visual passages as well as you read text.
 
✓ World history (15 percent; 7 or 8 questions): The types of questions and potential 
sources of information you encounter for the world history questions are identical to 
those you find in the American history questions, except that they deal with history 
from around the world, which means they go back much further than U.S. history does.
 
✓ Civics and government (25 percent; 12 or 13 questions): These passages are all about 
civic life, government, politics (especially the American political system), Americans’ 
relationships with other countries, and America’s role in the world. Your job, if you 
wish to accept it, is to read and understand the passages and answer questions about 
them. You can find a lot of material about civics and government in newspapers and 
news magazines. If you don’t read these types of publications regularly and want to 
look at old issues, visit your public library (or go to your doctor’s waiting room). Try 
to get a sense of what’s going on by pretending you want to explain the issue to a 
friend. (Don’t actually explain all the current issues to your friends, though, because 
you’ll probably run out of friends before you run out of issues.)

119
 Chapter 9: A Graph, a Map, and You: Getting Ready for the Social Studies Test
 
✓ Economics (20 percent; 10 questions): Economics is the study of how the earth’s 
resources are used to create wealth, which is then distributed and used to satisfy the 
needs of mankind. It involves the worlds of banking and finance in both small businesses 
and large corporations. It includes workers and owners who import and export 
manufactured goods and natural resources and services. You can find sources of 
economic articles on the Internet and in newspapers, magazines, textbooks, and software 
programs.
 
✓ Geography (15 percent; 7 or 8 questions): Geography passages usually read like a list 
of places you want to go. Geography deals with the world and what’s going on in it, 
including the impact of weather and environmental conditions and the political 
divisions of land and its use by living creatures. For geography questions, you often 
have to read maps and then answer questions about them. Although reading maps is a 
different kind of reading, with a little practice, it can be a fun and wonderful way to 
daydream about where you’d like to go on your next vacation.
 
 To help you prepare for the geography questions, you can read several good geographic 
magazines with fascinating articles and beautiful photographs. Plus, you can find 
Internet sites and library books about every place on earth. The important thing is to 
read, read, and read some more just to become comfortable with the language of 
geography.
The passages in the Social Studies Test are taken from the following two types of sources:
 
✓ Academic material: The type of material you find in a school — textbooks, maps, 
newspapers, magazines, software, and Internet material
 
✓ Workplace material: The type of material found on the job — manuals, documents, 
business plans, advertising and marketing materials, correspondence, and so on
The material may be from primary or secondary sources, which means the following:
 
✓ Primary sources: The original documents, such as the Declaration of Independence
 
✓ Secondary sources: Material written about an event or person, sometimes long after 
the event takes place or the person dies
Identifying the Types of Questions and 
Knowing How to Prepare for Them
The Social Studies Test contains two main types of questions. Having a basic understanding 
of these two types can help you prepare and avoid any surprises when you sit down to the 
take the test.
As you read the passages to get ready to answer the questions about them, you’re expected 
to use the following skills:
 
✓ Comprehension
 
✓ Application
 
✓ Analysis
 
✓ Evaluation

120
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
These skills are considered higher-level thinking skills and are the ones most adults use 
regularly. To better understand these skills, consider the following three examples:
 
✓ When you buy something new, you likely have to read the users’ manual that came 
with it to figure out how to use what you bought. As you read the manual and follow its 
instructions, you use the skills of comprehension and application. You first have to 
understand what the manual says and then use that information to make the thing you 
bought work. Without the skills of comprehension and application, the clock on your 
electronic devices might blink 12:00 forever.
 
✓ If you were in the checkout line of your favorite grocery store and saw a magazine that 
said the president was born on Mars, you probably wouldn’t run directly to your 
friends screaming about this amazing development. Instead, you’d likely first want to 
decide whether this new “fact” could possibly be true by doing some further research 
and clarifying your thinking. When you read or hear something and you take time to 
think about it before using the information in a discussion with your friends, you use 
the skills of evaluation and application.
 
✓ If someone said to you, “The United States is a dictatorship with occasional outbreaks 
of democracy,” you’d need to use the skill of analysis to either agree or disagree with 
that statement. Do the “occasional outbreaks of democracy” refer to the elections? 
In this case, what happens between elections? Can the president make decisions with-
out consulting the public or the elected representatives? Can an elected representative 
vote however he or she wants without considering the needs of his or her constitu-
ents? The answers to these questions are what you get when you analyze the initial 
statement.
The following sections explain the two types of questions you encounter on this test and 
offer you advice on how to prepare for them so that you can solve them with ease when you 
face them on test day.
Questions about text passages
The first type of question you have to answer on the Social Studies Test is based on text 
passages. You read a textual excerpt or passage and then answer questions about it.
The best way to prepare for these types of questions is to read, read, read. In particular, 
these questions require you to read excerpts from documents such as the following:
 
✓ Declaration of Independence
 
✓ U.S. Constitution
 
✓ Landmark Supreme Court cases
 
✓ Consumer information guides
 
✓ Voters’ guides
 
✓ Atlases
 
✓ Tax forms
 
✓ Budget graphs

121
 Chapter 9: A Graph, a Map, and You: Getting Ready for the Social Studies Test
 
✓ Political speeches
 
✓ Almanacs
 
✓ Statistical abstracts
The more you read these types of documents, the more you think about what you read, and 
the more you think about what you read, the better prepared you’ll be for the text-based 
questions on this test. You can find examples of each of these possible sources in libraries 
and on the Internet.
When you’re preparing for the test and then again when you’re reading these passages on 
the test, read between the lines and look at the implications and assumptions in the passages. 
An implication is something you can understand from what’s written even though it isn’t 
directly stated. An assumption is something you can accept as the truth even though proof 
isn’t presented in the text.
 
When you take the test, be sure to read each question carefully so you know exactly what 
it’s asking for. If you’re being asked for facts, they’re presented to you in the passage. If 
you’re asked for opinions, they may be either stated or implied in the passages (and they 
may disagree with your own opinions — but you still have to answer with the best choice 
based on the material presented). Keep in mind that you usually find opinions in textual 
passages, political cartoons, and works of art.
If a question doesn’t specifically tell you to use additional information that isn’t presented 
in the passage, use only the information that is presented. An answer may be incorrect in 
your opinion, but according to the information presented, it’s correct (or vice versa). Go 
with the information presented unless a question tells you to do otherwise.
Questions about visual materials
To make sure you don’t get bored taking this test, only 40 percent of the questions are 
based on textual material. Another 40 percent are based on maps, graphs, tables, political 
cartoons, diagrams, photographs, and artistic works. The remaining 20 percent of the 
questions are based on a combination of visual material and text.
Although the fact that 40 percent of the questions deal with visual material may seem 
overwhelming when you think about it, consider the following:
 
✓ You’re probably already familiar with maps. Travel maps (see Figure 9-1) help you 
get from place to place. Weather maps help you see what the weather has in store for 
your area. To help you prepare for the map-based questions on the test, study the 
maps you see on TV or in newspapers or magazines; try to figure out what they’re 
showing you.
 
✓ Every time you turn around, someone in the media is trying to make a point with a 
graph. The real reason people use graphs to explain themselves so often is because a 
graph can clearly show trends and relationships between different sets of information. 
The next time you see a graph, such as the one in Figure 9-2, study it carefully to see 
whether you understand what the information in the graph is telling you. (Keep in 
mind that graphs are also called charts.)

 Chapter 9: A Graph, a Map, and You: Getting Ready for the Social Studies Test
 
✓ Tables are everywhere. If you’ve ever looked at the nutrition label on a food product, 
you’ve read a table. Study any table you can find, whether in a newspaper or on the 
back of a can of tuna. See Figure 9-3 for an example of a table that could appear on the 
Social Studies Test. (Note that tables are also sometimes called charts, which can be a 
little confusing. The thing to remember is that it doesn’t matter whether a visual passage 
is a table, a cartoon, a drawing, or a graph — as long as you know how to read it.)
 
✓ Political cartoons appear in the newspapers every day. If you don’t read political 
cartoons in the daily newspaper (usually located on the Editorial or Op-Ed pages), give 
them a try. Some days, they’re the best entertainment in the paper. Political cartoons 
in the newspaper are usually based on an event in the last day or week. If you want to 
get the most out of political cartoons, look for small details, facial expressions, and 
background clues. The cartoons on the test are obviously older than the ones in daily 
newspapers, so you may not get the context unless you’ve been reading the newspapers 
or watching the news for the past several weeks or months.
 
✓ You’ve no doubt seen countless photographs in your day. Photos are all around you. 
All you need to do to prepare for the photograph-based questions on the test is to 
begin getting information from the photographs you see. Start with the newspapers or 
magazines, where photos are chosen to provide information that connects directly to a 
story. See if you can determine what message the photograph carries with it and how it 
relates to the story it supports.
 
✓ You probably like to look at works of art. On the Social Studies Test, you have a 
chance to “read” works of art. You look at a work of art and gather information you can 
use to answer the question. To get yourself ready to gather information from works of 
art on the test, take a look at art galleries, the Internet, and library books. Lucky for 
you, some books even give some background or other explanation for these works.

Impact on the Environment
If you’re unsure of how to read a map, go to any search engine and search for Map reading 
help to find sites that explain how to read a map. If any of the other types of visual materials 
cause you concern, do the same thing — with the exception of political cartoons. If you try 
to follow the same procedure for political cartoons, you’ll get a lot of actual cartoons but 
not a lot of explanations about them. Instead, look at some examples of political cartoons 
(either in the newspaper or online) to try to understand what the cartoonist is saying to 
you. Then look up the topic of the cartoon and the date to read some of the news stories it 
refers to. Talk about the cartoon with your friends. If you can explain a cartoon or carry on 
a logical discussion about the topic, you probably understand its contents.
All the visual items you have to review on this test are familiar. Now all you have to do is 
practice until your skills in reading and understanding them increase. Then you, too, can 
discuss the latest political cartoon or pontificate about a work of art.

124
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
Examining Preparation Strategies That Work
To improve your skills and get better results, we suggest you try the following strategies 
when taking the Social Studies Test:
 
✓ Take as many practice tests as you can get your hands on. The best way to prepare is 
to answer all the sample social studies questions you can find. Do practice tests (see 
Chapters 10 and 12), practice questions (see the “Practicing with Sample Problems” sec-
tion later in this chapter), and examples, such as those on the GED site (www.acenet.
edu/Content/NavigationMenu/ged/test/prep/sample_questions.htm).
 
 Consider taking a preparation class to get your hands on even more sample Social 
Studies Test questions, but remember that your task is to pass the test — not to 
collect every question ever written.
 
✓ Practice reading a variety of different documents. As we mention in the previous 
section, read, read, and read some more. The documents you need to focus on include 
historic passages from original sources (such as the Declaration of Independence, U.S. 
Constitution, and so on), as well as practical information for consumers (such as 
voters’ guides, atlases, budget graphs, political speeches, almanacs, and tax forms).
 
✓ Prepare summaries of the passages you read in your own words. After you read 
these passages, summarize what you’ve read. Doing so can help you identify the main 
points of the passages, which is an important part of succeeding on the Social Studies 
Test. Ask yourself the following two questions when you read a passage or something 
more visual like a graph:
 
• What’s the passage about? When reading passages of text, ask yourself what 
the passage is about. The answer is usually in the first or last sentence of the 
passage. If you don’t see the answer there, you may have to look carefully 
through the rest of the passage.
 
• What’s the visual material about? When reading maps, charts, graphs, political 
cartoons, diagrams, photographs, and artistic works, ask yourself what the visual 
material is about. Look for the answer in the title, labels, captions, and any other 
information that’s included.
 
 After you get an initial grasp of the main idea, determine what to do with it. Some 
questions ask you to use information you gain from one situation in another similar 
situation. If you know the main idea of the passage, you’ll have an easier time applying 
it to another situation.
 
✓ Draft a series of your own test questions that draw on the information contained in 
the passages you read. Doing so can help you become familiar with social studies–
based questions. Look in newspapers and magazines for articles that fit into the general 
passage types that appear on the Social Studies Test. Find a good summary paragraph, 
and develop a question that gets to the point of the summary.
 
✓ Compose answers for each of your test questions. Write out five answers to each of 
your test questions, only one of which is correct based on the passage. Creating your 
own questions and answers helps reduce your stress level by showing you how 
answers are related to questions. It also encourages you to read and think about 
material that could be on the test. Finally, it gives you some idea of where to look for 
answers in a passage.
 
✓ Discuss questions and answers with friends and family to make sure you’ve 
achieved an understanding and proper use of the material. If your friends and family 
understand the question, you know it’s a good question. Discussing your questions and 
answers with others gives you a chance to discuss and explain social studies topics 
and concepts, which is an important skill to have as you get ready to take this test.

125
 Chapter 9: A Graph, a Map, and You: Getting Ready for the Social Studies Test
Managing Your Time for the Social Studies Test
Remember that you have to answer 50 questions in 70 minutes to complete this test, which 
means you have less than 11⁄2 minutes to spend on each question. Because you don’t have a 
lot of time, you want to make sure you plan accordingly to give yourself enough time to 
answer every question and to quickly review your answers.
As we mention earlier in this chapter, the questions on the Social Studies Test are based on 
both regular textual passages and visual materials like maps and charts, so, when you plan 
your time for answering the questions, you have to consider the amount of time it takes to 
read both types of passages. (See the “Questions about visual materials” section for advice 
on how you can get more comfortable with questions based on graphs, charts, and the like.)
When you come to a prose passage, read the questions first and then skim the passage look-
ing for sections that answer the questions. If this method doesn’t work, read the passage 
carefully, looking for the answers. This way, you take more time only when needed.
Because you have such little time to gather all the information you can from a visual mate-
rial and answer questions about it, you can’t study the map, chart, or cartoon all afternoon. 
You have to skim it the way you skim a paragraph. Reading the questions that relate to a 
particular visual passage first helps you figure out what you need to look for as you skim the 
material. The practice tests in Chapters 10 and 12 contain examples of questions based on 
visual materials, and so do the sample problems in the “Practicing with Sample Problems” 
section in this chapter.
 
If you’re unsure of how quickly you can answer questions based on visual materials, time 
yourself on a few and see. If your time comes out to be more than 11⁄2 minutes, you need 
more practice.
Realistically, you have about 20 seconds to read the question and the possible answers, 
40 seconds to look for the answer in the cartoon, and 10 seconds to fill in the circle for the 
answer. Dividing your time in this way leaves you less than 20 seconds for review or for 
time at the end of the test to spend on difficult questions. To finish the Social Studies Test 
completely, you really have to be organized and watch the clock. Check out Chapter 2 for 
more general time-management tips.
Practicing with Sample Problems
The sample problems in this section give you a taste of what to expect in the practice tests 
in Chapters 10 and 12 of this book.
 
Remember that the Social Studies Test doesn’t measure your ability to recall information, 
such as dates, facts, or events. It requires you to read a passage, analyze the information, 
evaluate its accuracy, and draw conclusions according to the printed text or visual 
materials contained in the passage. You then choose the one best answer to each question.
Questions 1 through 5 are based on the following passage.
Bridging both temperate and tropical regions, Mexico’s terrain includes mountains, plains, 
valleys, and plateaus. Snow-capped volcanoes slope down to pine forests, deserts, and 
balmy tropical beaches. This diverse topography supports a variety of industries, including 
manufacturing, mining, petroleum, and agricultural production. As a member of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico has the United States and Canada as 

126
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
main trading partners. In economic terms, Mexico boasts a GDP (gross domestic product) 
of $370 billion ($8,100 per person), which ranks it thirteenth in the world. Mexico currently 
enjoys an annual growth rate of over 6 percent. Beginning in 1985, Mexico began a process 
of trade liberalization and privatization. From 1982 to 1992, government-controlled enterprises 
were reduced from 1,155 to 217.
 
1. Which of the following are not part of Mexico’s terrain?
 
(1) plateaus
 
(2) polar ice caps
 
(3) mountains
 
(4) valleys
 
(5) plains
The correct answer is Choice (2) because the country doesn’t lie either at the North or 
South Pole, where polar ice caps are found. The passage mentions the other answer 
choices — plateaus, mountains, valleys, and plains — but this question asks for what isn’t 
mentioned.
 
2. Which adjectives demonstrate that the Mexican climate represents extremes in temperature?
 
(1) sunny and rainy
 
(2) dark and misty
 
(3) plains and valleys
 
(4) snow-capped and balmy
 
(5) forests and deserts
The correct answer is Choice (4). Snow-capped volcanoes represent an extremely low 
temperature, while balmy beaches refer to the higher temperatures found in a tropical 
climate. Other adjectives — such as sunny and rainy or dark and misty — don’t refer to 
changes in temperature. Plains and valleys and forests and deserts are nouns that refer to 
terrain, not temperature.
 
3. What does “diverse topography” refer to?
 
(1) differences in terrain
 
(2) uniqueness in manufacturing
 
(3) differences in agriculture
 
(4) diversity of tropical beaches
 
(5) abundance of petroleum production
The correct answer is Choice (1). Topography is another word for terrain. Diverse means 
 different. Manufacturing, agriculture, and petroleum production are types of industries. 
Tropical beaches are just one type of terrain.
 
4. Which countries are Mexico’s trading partners in NAFTA?
 
(1) the United States and the United Kingdom
 
(2) France and Germany
 
(3) North America
 
(4) Canada and the United Kingdom
 
(5) the United States and Canada

127
 Chapter 9: A Graph, a Map, and You: Getting Ready for the Social Studies Test
The correct answer is Choice (5). The text states that the United States and Canada joined 
with Mexico to form the North American Free Trade Agreement. The United Kingdom, 
France, and Germany aren’t partners in NAFTA.
 
5. What happened in Mexico between 1982 and 1992?
 
(1) Government control of enterprises increased.
 
(2) The government controlled fewer enterprises.
 
(3) Mexico achieved the highest GDP in the world.
 
(4) Mexico’s growth rate was less than 6 percent.
 
(5) Mexico won the World Cup.
The correct answer is Choice (2). According to the passage, during the decade from 1982 to 
1992, Mexico’s government reduced its control of enterprises from 1,155 to 217. It didn’t 
increase enterprise control, nor did Mexico achieve the highest GDP in the world — 12 
countries were higher. The country’s growth rate was more than 6 percent. And although 
Mexico would love to win the World Cup in soccer, the passage doesn’t say it did so during 
the mentioned decade.
Questions 6 and 7 are based on the following graph:
 
6. In what period was the inflation rate the highest?
 
(1) January to April 2008
 
(2) April to August 2008
 
(3) August to November 2008
 
(4) November 2008 to February 2009
 
(5) February to May 2009
The correct answer is Choice (2). The highest point on the graph occurs in the period 
represented by April to August 2008. If there were finer divisions on the x-axis (horizontal 
axis) of the graph, you could be more accurate in the timing, but, as it is, the graph indicates 
this level of accuracy.

7. In what period did the inflation rate first dip below zero?
 
(1) January to April 2008
 
(2) April to August 2008
 
(3) August to November 2008
 
(4) November 2008 to February 2009
 
(5) February to May 2009
The correct answer is Choice (4). The first time that the line on this graph passes through 
the horizontal line labeled 0 on the vertical axis is during the period November 2008 to 
February 2009. The numbers below this horizontal line are negative.
Revealing Some Helpful Pointers
The following additional tips can serve you well in this test:
 
✓ Don’t assume. Be extra careful with visual material and read it carefully. You want to 
be able to read visual material as accurately as you read text material, and doing so 
takes practice. Don’t assume something is true just because it looks that way in a 
diagram, chart, or map. Visual materials can be precise drawings, with legends and 
scales, or they can be drawn in such a way that, at first glance, the information appears 
to be different than it really is. Verify what you think you see by making sure the 
information looks correct and realistic.
 
✓ Be familiar with general graphical conventions. Maps and graphs have conventions. 
The top of a map is almost always north. The horizontal axis is always the x-axis, and 
the vertical axis (the y-axis) is dependent on the x-axis. Looking at the horizontal axis 
first usually makes the information clearer and easier to understand.
See Chapter 3 for general test-taking strategies that apply to all the GED tests.

The First Inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere
In telling the history of the United States and also of the nations of the Western Hemisphere 
in general, historians have wrestled with the problem of what to call the hemisphere’s first 
inhabitants. Under the mistaken impression he had reached the “Indies,” explorer 
Christopher Columbus called the people he met “Indians.” This was an error in identification 
that has persisted for more than five hundred years, for the inhabitants of North and South 
America had no collective name by which they called themselves.
Historians, anthropologists, and political activists have offered various names, none fully 
satisfactory. Anthropologists have used “aborigine,” but the term suggests a primitive level 
of existence inconsistent with the cultural level of many tribes. Another term, “Amerindian,” 
which combines Columbus’s error with the name of another Italian explorer, Amerigo 
Vespucci (whose name was the source of “America”), lacks any historical context. Since the 
1960s, “Native American” has come into popular favor, though some activists prefer 
“American Indian.” In the absence of a truly representative term, descriptive references 
such as “native peoples” or “indigenous peoples,” though vague, avoid European influence. 
In recent years, some argument has developed over whether to refer to tribes in the singular 
or plural — Apache or Apaches — with supporters on both sides demanding political 
correctness.

The Voyages of Christopher Columbus
Christopher Columbus, a Genoese sailor, believed that sailing west across the Atlantic 
Ocean was the shortest sea route to Asia. Ignorant of the fact that the Western Hemisphere 
lay between Europe and Asia and assuming the earth’s circumference to be a third less than 
it actually is, he was convinced that Japan would appear on the horizon just three thousand 
miles to the west. Like other seafarers of his day, Columbus was untroubled by political alle-
giances; he was ready to sail for whatever country would pay for his voyage. Either because 
of his arrogance (he wanted ships and crews to be provided at no expense to himself) or 
ambition (he insisted on governing the lands he discovered), he found it difficult to find a 
patron. The Portuguese rejected his plan twice, and the rulers of England and France were 
not interested. With influential supporters at court, Columbus convinced King Ferdinand 
and Queen Isabella of Spain to partially underwrite his expedition. In 1492, Granada, the last 
Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, had fallen to the forces of the Spanish monarchs. 
With the Reconquista complete and Spain a unified country, Ferdinand and Isabella could 
turn their attention to overseas exploration.

Social Structure of the Thirteen Colonies
At the bottom of the social ladder were slaves and indentured servants; successful planters 
in the south and wealthy merchants in the north were the colonial elite. In the Chesapeake 
area, the signs of prosperity were visible in brick and mortar. The rather modest houses of 
even the most prosperous farmers of the seventeenth century had given way to spacious 
mansions in the eighteenth century. South Carolina planters often owned townhouses in 
Charleston and would probably have gone to someplace like Newport to escape the heat in 
summer. Both in their lifestyles and social pursuits (such as horse racing), the southern 
gentry emulated the English country squire.
Large landholders were not confined just to the southern colonies. The descendants of the 
Dutch patrons and the men who received lands from the English royal governors controlled 
estates in the middle colonies. Their farms were worked by tenant farmers, who received a 
share of the crop for their labor. In the northern cities, wealth was increasingly concen-
trated in the hands of the merchants; below them was the middle class of skilled craftsmen 
and shopkeepers. Craftsmen learned their trade as apprentices and became journeymen 
when their term of apprenticeship (as long as seven years) was completed. Even as wage 
earner, a journeyman often still lived with his former master and ate at his table. Saving 
enough money to go into business for himself was the dream of every journeyman.

Declaration of Independence
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted 
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any 
form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter 
or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, 
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their 
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established 
should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath 
shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right 
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of 
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce 
them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, 
and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of 
these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former 
system of government. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of 
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute 
tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

Resistance to Slavery
Resistance to slavery took several forms. Slaves would pretend to be ill, refuse to work, do 
their jobs poorly, destroy farm equipment, set fire to buildings, and steal food. These were 
all individual acts rather than part of an organized plan for revolt, but the objective was to 
upset the routine of the plantation in any way possible. On some plantations, slaves could 
bring grievances about harsh treatment from an overseer to their master and hope that he 
would intercede on their behalf. Although many slaves tried to run away, few succeeded for 
more than a few days, and they often returned on their own. Such escapes were more a 
protest — a demonstration that it could be done — than a dash for freedom. As advertise-
ments in southern newspapers seeking the return of runaway slaves made clear, the goal of 
most runaways was to find their wives or children who had been sold to another planter. 
The fabled underground railroad, a series of safe houses for runaways organized by 
abolitionists and run by former slaves like Harriet Tubman, actually helped only about a 
thousand slaves reach the North.

Weather and Traffic Report
Good morning and welcome to America’s weather and traffic on WAWT, the voice of the 
world in the ear of the nation. Today is going to be hot. That’s H-O-T, and we all know what 
that means. The big “P” is coming back for a visit. We are going to have pollution today for 
sure. With our record heat today on each coast, there is a problem. If you think that it’s hot 
here, it’s even hotter up higher. And that means unhealthy air leading to unhealthy people. I 
can hear the coughs and sneezes coast to coast. I think I hear a whole series of gasps from our 
nation’s capital, good ol’ Washington D.C., and it’s not Congress that is producing all that hot 
air. And out in western California, it’s just as bad. Just the other day, I looked up “poor air 
quality” in the dictionary, and it said “see California.” Lots of luck breathing out there.
This morning, once again, there’s a layer of hot air just above ground level. That’s where we 
live — ground level. This air acts like a closed gate, and it keeps the surface air from going up 
and mixing. Of course, we are all going to drive our cars all day in heavy traffic, and some of 
us will go to work in factories. And, surprise — by afternoon, all those pollutants from the 
cars mix with the emissions from the factories and get trapped by the layer of hot air, and it’s 
try-to-catch-your-breath time. Unhealthy air is here again. Tomorrow and every day after, 
we’ll probably have more of the same until we learn to take care of our environment.
Well, I’ll see you tomorrow, if the air’s not too thick to see through.

The End of the Cold War
In July 1989, Gorbachev repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had justified the interven-
tion of the Soviet Union in the affairs of communist countries. Within a few months of his 
statement, the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe collapsed — Poland, Hungary, and 
Czechoslovakia, followed by Bulgaria and Romania. The Berlin Wall came down in 
November 1989, and East and West Germany were reunited within the year. Czechoslovakia 
eventually split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia with little trouble, but the end of the 
Yugoslav Federation in 1991 led to years of violence and ethnic cleansing (the expulsion of 
an ethnic population from a geographic area), particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
Soviet Union also broke up, not long after an attempted coup against Gorbachev in August 
1991, and the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania were the first to gain their inde-
pendence. That December, Gorbachev stepped down, and the old Soviet Union became the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The CIS quickly disappeared, and the republics 
that had once made up the Soviet Union were recognized as sovereign nations. The end of 
the Cold War led directly to major nuclear weapons reduction agreements between 
President Bush and the Russian leaders, as well as significant cutbacks in the number of 
troops the United States committed to the defense of NATO.

The Panic of 1873
During his second term, Grant was still unable to curb the graft in his administration, 
Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached by the House, and he resigned in disgrace 
for taking bribes from dishonest Indian agents. The president’s personal secretary was 
involved with the Whiskey Ring, a group of distillers who evaded paying internal revenue 
taxes. A much more pressing concern though was the state of the economy.
In 1873, over-speculation in railroad stocks led to a major economic panic. The failure of Jay 
Cooke’s investment bank was followed by the collapse of the stock market and the bank-
ruptcy of thousands of businesses; crop prices plummeted and unemployment soared. 
Much of the problem was related to the use of greenbacks for currency. Hard-money 
advocates insisted that paper money had to be backed by gold to curb inflation and level 
price fluctuations, but farmers and manufacturers, who needed easy credit, wanted even 
more greenbacks put in circulation, a policy that Grant ultimately opposed. He recommended 
and the Congress enacted legislation in 1875 providing for the redemption of greenbacks in 
gold. Because the Treasury needed time to build up its gold reserves, redemption did not 
go into effect for another four years, by which time the longest depression in American 
history had come to an end.

Answers and Explanations for 
the Social Studies Test
A
fter taking the Social Studies Test in Chapter 10, use this chapter to check your 
answers. Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers that we 
provide in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed the answers you 
did. You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you answered correctly 
because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought process that helped 
you choose the correct answers.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key.
Analysis of the Answers
 
1. 2. Columbus thought he had reached the Indies when he landed in North America, so he 
called the natives “Indians.” The other answers — the natives’ being in the Western 
Hemisphere, the fact that the Americas hadn’t been discovered yet, the natives’ being the 
hemisphere’s first inhabitants, or Columbus’s liking the sound of the name — just don’t 
make sense as reasons.
 
2. 4. Anthropologists coined the term aborigine. Historians, activists, Columbus, or explorers 
may also have used the term, but according to the passage, anthropologists is the correct 
answer.
 
3. 2. In the 1960s, after much debate, Native American was chosen as the name for the 
indigenous peoples. Other terms, such as Indian, Amerindian, native peoples, and 
indigenous peoples, were discarded.
 
4. 1. According to the passage, America was named after Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci 
rather than Christopher Columbus, who discovered the lands.
 
5. 4. According to the passage, Columbus sailed west to cross the Atlantic Ocean in search 
of Asia.
 
6. 3. Columbus thought the circumference was a third less than it really was. The other 
answers are incorrect, according to the passage.
 
7. 1. Columbus was not troubled about political allegiances. He would sail for any country 
that was willing to pay for the trip. The other choices — that he was troubled, arrogant, 
ready to sail, or ambitious — don’t refer to political allegiances.
 
8. 5. Columbus finally got partial funding from the king and queen of Spain. Portugal, England, 
France, and Japan didn’t provide any funding.
 
9. 4. Columbus convinced Ferdinand and Isabella to fund the voyage by using influential 
supporters at court. The other answers — that they had a unified country, the Muslims 
were defeated, the English and French weren’t interested, and they were ready for 
exploration — aren’t the best answers.

148
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
 
10. 5. The passage states that planters and merchants were the colonial elite. Slaves, servants, 
apprentices, journeymen, and tenant farmers were lower on the ladder. Horse racers aren’t 
mentioned in the passage.
 
11. 1. South Carolina planters were prosperous farmers. The term planters refers to farming as 
a way of making a living, so they weren’t merchants or servants, which are other occupations. 
City squires aren’t mentioned in the passage. Mansions are buildings, not people.
 
12. 4. They went to Newport to escape the summer’s heat. Other possible choices, such as 
horse racing, to find modest houses, to be near the sea, or social pursuits, may make sense 
(and may even be true), but the passage doesn’t describe them as the best reason.
 
13. 2. Tenant farmers worked for a share of the crops they produced. They weren’t landholders, 
governors, patrons, or colonials, none of whom are involved with actual farming.
 
14. 5. You must read the passage slowly and carefully to determine that shopkeepers and 
skilled craftsmen were in the middle class. (Note that the passage then breaks down the 
group of skilled craftsmen into two categories: apprentices, who worked with another 
skilled craftsman for as many as seven years, and journeymen, who had completed their 
apprenticeships.) The passage doesn’t mention noblemen, squires, merchants, or patrons.
 
15. 3. Each journeyman dreamed of having his own business someday. Other choices, such as 
having a seven-year apprenticeship, eating at the master’s table, becoming a wage earner, 
and saving money, may have some validity, but according to the passage, they aren’t the 
best answers.
 
16. 5. The passage lists two self-evident truths: that all men are created equal and that the 
Creator endowed men with certain rights. (Self-evident means evident without need of 
explanation or proof.)
 
17. 1. According to the passage, governments were to get their power from the people. 
Getting power from the Creator, among men, from a new foundation, and from the king are 
incorrect answers, according to the passage.
 
18. 3. The people were suffering because of evils of the old government, which was the main 
reason why they sought a new government. The other answers may have some truth to 
them, but they aren’t the main reason, according to the passage.
 
19. 2. The colonies had been suffering patiently. The other choices — king’s injuries, despotism, 
same object, and new guards — don’t refer directly to the colonies.
 
20. 3. George III had become an absolute tyrant. He was neither a kindly ruler nor a friend of 
the people. Having caused injuries and guarded securely aren’t the best answers.
 
21. 5. Some researchers believe cellphones are injurious to your health, particularly if they 
damage the brain or cause accidents while driving. The other answers — wonderful 
invention, aid to communication, medical breakthrough, and useful appliance — are all 
factors, but they aren’t the ones depicted in the cartoon.
 
22. 1. The cellphone user is foolhardy in that he’s driving dangerously by not paying enough 
attention to the road. Other choices, such as considerate and courageous, are incorrect. 
Talkative and cowardly aren’t the best answers, according to the cartoon.
 
23. 2. Some scientific research indicates that cellphones may represent a risk to health 
(radiation and brain tumors, for example). Movies, legends, opinion, and reports aren’t 
correct choices, according to the cartoon.
 
24. 4. Refusing to work was the main way slaves showed that they longed to be free. Illness, 
poor jobs, destroyed equipment, and stolen food may have been other ways they showed 
their frustration, but, according to the passage, those answers aren’t as important.
 
25. 1. Running away represented a form of protest. Other factors, including taking out grievances, 
upsetting routines, appealing to the master, or being sold, weren’t nearly as strong as 
protesting.

149
 Chapter 11: Answers and Explanations for the Social Studies Test
 
26. 3. The underground railroad was organized by the abolitionists. Other possible players, 
such as Harriet Tubman, former slaves, runaways, and Southern newspapers, may have 
been involved, but, according to the passage, they weren’t the organizers.
 
27. 2. Pollution tends to be at its worst in the afternoon when exhausts and emissions are 
trapped. According to the passage, other times of day don’t have as much pollution.
 
28. 4. Exhausts and emissions are the main sources of pollution. Other answers, such as 
record heat, air rising, unhealthy air, and warmer air, are factors, but they aren’t the most 
important ones.
 
29. 4. Pollution tends to be most serious on the East and West coasts. The passage doesn’t 
mention the other locations — Midwest, Deep South, up north, and near the Great Lakes.
 
30. 2. Pollution can best be prevented by reducing emissions. The other choices (changing the 
temperature, eliminating the hot air layer, preventing air from rising, and keeping warmer 
temperatures aloft) may contribute, but they aren’t the best answers.
 
31. 3. Gorbachev ended the Cold War when he repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine. Communist 
regimes, Brezhnev, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union are incorrect answers.
 
32. 1. When the Berlin Wall fell, East and West Germany were once again united. Soviet 
intervention, the Brezhnev Doctrine, regimes collapsing, and U.S. intervention may have 
existed, but they aren’t the best answers according to the passage.
 
33. 3. According to the passage, ethnic cleansing refers to the expulsion of minority ethnic 
populations. The other answers are incorrect because they don’t refer specifically to how 
people were expelled.
 
34. 5. The former Soviet republics became sovereign nations. According to the passage, the 
Soviet republics didn’t disappear, weren’t invited to join NATO, and didn’t become the 
Baltic States. The passage doesn’t mention anything called CNS.
 
35. 5. All the factors except Choice (5) are the opposite of what the last sentence of the 
passage states, so Choice (5) is the only correct answer.
 
36. 1. The main problems President Grant faced involved grafts in his administration, which 
means that members of his administration faced all sorts of problems and left their jobs 
under pressure. The other answers are incorrect, based on the passage.
 
37. 3. Over-speculation in railroad stocks led to the Panic of 1873. Other factors, such as 
investment failure, bankruptcy, tax evasion, and economic panic may have also occurred, 
but they didn’t directly cause the Panic of 1873.
 
38. 5. Greenbacks — not British pounds, gold, or silver — were used as a source of investment 
capital. Inflation has nothing to do with the question.
 
39. 1. The failure of Cooke’s bank was followed by a collapse of the stock market. The other 
answers are the opposite of what happened, according to the passage.
 
40. 3. The main way Congress ended the depression was to build up its gold reserves. Credit, 
prices, greenbacks, and inflation didn’t have as much to do with the end of the depression.
 
41. 2. The Mexican GDP was 2.8 percentage points higher than the U.S. GDP. The other 
answers are simply incorrect, according to the graphs.
 
42. 1. According to the GDP graphs, Canada’s economy has consistently performed well when 
compared to the economies of the United States and Mexico.
 
43. 2. The value of the Canadian dollar is a straight line, which means its value stayed the 
same.
 
44. 5. On 1/4/2009, the index was just under 10,000, and on 1/8/2009, it was above 6,000. Thus, 
Choice (5) is the most correct.

150
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
 
45. 5. The Dow Jones was down by more than 2,000 points, from around 11,000 to around 
9,000, which makes Choice (5) the correct answer.
 
46. 2. The setting for the cartoon is a laboratory, not a living room, playroom, library, or 
kitchen.
 
47. 5. The researcher has been studying limited patents for medicines. You can tell this from 
the phrase perpetual patents.
 
48. 3. The cartoonist depicts drug companies as greedy. Drug companies may also be caring 
or generous, but the cartoon doesn’t suggest this. Drug companies certainly aren’t religious, 
and the term curious just doesn’t make sense in this context.
 
49. 5. The solution is important for the drug companies because it will increase their profits. 
Other potential effects — sharing with people, making employees famous, improving 
public relations, and looking good — may all be important to people, but they aren’t the 
primary reason for wanting the solution.
 
50. 1. The overall theme of the cartoon is the greed of the drug companies.

Industry and Trade in the Thirteen Colonies
The colonies were part of an Atlantic trading network that linked them with England, Africa, 
and the West Indies. The pattern of commerce, not too accurately called the Triangular 
Trade, involved the exchange of products from colonial farms, plantations, fisheries, and 
forests with England for manufactured goods and the West Indies for slaves, molasses, and 
sugar. In New England, molasses and sugar were distilled into rum, which was used to buy 
African slaves. Southern Europe was also a valuable market for colonial foodstuffs.
Colonial industry was closely associated with trade. A significant percentage of Atlantic 
shipping was on vessels built in the colonies, and shipbuilding stimulated other crafts, such 
as the sewing of sails, milling of lumber, and manufacturing of naval stores. Mercantile 
theory encouraged the colonies to provide raw materials for England’s industrializing econ-
omy; pig iron and coal became important exports. Concurrently, restrictions were placed 
on finished goods. For example, Parliament, concerned about possible competition from 
colonial hatters, prohibited the export of hats from one colony to another and limited the 
number of apprentices in each hatmaker’s shop.

Charges against the King
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, 
unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so 
suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, 
unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature — 
a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and dis-
tant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing 
them into compliance with his measures.
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with manly firm-
ness, his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; 
whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the 
people at large, for their exercise, the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all 
the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstruct-
ing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their 
migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for 
establishing judiciary powers.
He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and 
the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers, to 
harass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our 
legislature.
He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the civil power.

Questions 12 through 17 refer to the following passage, which is excerpted from 
CliffsQuickReview U.S. History I by P. Soifer and A. Hoffman (Wiley).
The War of 1812
For the United States, the most obvious British target was Canada. Its population was 
small, many Canadians were actually Americans by birth, and a quick victory there 
would stop British plans to ruin American trade. The military facts painted a different 
picture, however. Thousands of Native Americans in the northwestern territories 
sided with the British when the war began, bolstering their strength, while the small 
U.S. army was composed of poorly trained state militiamen led by elderly and incom-
petent generals.
In July 1812, an American army led by General William Hull moved from Detroit into 
Canada. Almost immediately the Shawnee cut his supply lines, forcing him back to 
Detroit. Although Hull commanded two thousand men, he surrendered to a consider-
ably smaller British and Native American force. Other embarrassments followed as 
the United States suffered defeat at Queenston Heights in western New York and the 
militia under General Henry Dearborn refused to march to Montreal from northeast-
ern New York.
The United States fared better on Lake Erie in 1813. The Royal Navy could not reach 
the lake from the St. Lawrence River, so both the British and Americans raced to 
build ships on opposite sides of the lake. On September 10, 1813, the small American 
fleet under Oliver Hazard Perry defeated the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. “We 
have met the enemy, and they are ours,” he reported, a victory statement that 
became legendary.
Less than three weeks later, on October 5, William Henry Harrison (a general by then) 
defeated a combined British and Native American force at the Battle of the Thames. 
Tecumseh was killed in this battle, ending Native Americans’ hopes for a coalition 
that could stand against the advance of U.S. settlement. Despite these victories, U.S. 
efforts to capture Canada ended in a stalemate.

Gettysburg Address
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new 
nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created 
equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any 
nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battle-
field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting 
place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether 
fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, 
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, 
who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. 
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget 
what they did here . . . .

Questions 24 through 29 refer to the following passage, which is excerpted from 
CliffsQuickReview U.S. History II by P. Soifer and A. Hoffman (Wiley).
Causes of World War I
On June 28, 1914, a Serbian nationalist assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, 
the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. Austria demanded indemnities from Serbia 
for the assassination. The Serbian government denied any involvement with the 
murder and, when Austria issued an ultimatum, turned to its ally, Russia, for help. 
When Russia began to mobilize its army, Europe’s alliance system, ironically intended 
to maintain the balance of power on the continent, drew one country after another 
into war. Austria’s ally, Germany, declared war on Russia on August 1 and on France 
(which was allied with Russia) two days later. Great Britain entered the war on 
August 4, following Germany’s invasion of neutral Belgium. By the end of August 1914, 
most of Europe had chosen sides: the Central Powers — Germany, Austria-Hungary, 
Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) — were up against the Allied Powers — 
principally Great Britain, France, Russia, and Serbia. Japan joined the Allied cause in 
August 1914, in hopes of seizing German possessions in the Pacific and expanding 
Japanese influence in China. This action threatened the Open Door Policy and led to 
increased tensions with the United States. Originally an ally of Germany and Austria-
Hungary, Italy entered the war in 1915 on the side of Britain and France because they 
had agreed to Italian territorial demands in a secret treaty (the Treaty of London).

Questions 34 through 37 refer to the following passage, which is excerpted from 
CliffsQuickReview U.S. History I by P. Soifer and A. Hoffman (Wiley).
Farm Production and Declining Prices
Bringing new lands under cultivation and the widespread use of machinery led to a 
tremendous increase in farm production. The wheat crop, which became an export 
staple, grew from 170 million bushels at the end of the Civil War to more than 700 mil-
lion bushels by the close of the century. Overproduction in the United States and 
expanded crop production in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Russia drove agricul-
tural prices down during the same period. Unfortunately, American farmers did not 
seem to understand how the market operated. When prices fell, the inclination was to 
plant more, which added to the worldwide surplus and pushed prices still lower.
The promise of wealth through agriculture failed to materialize for most settlers in 
the West. They had borrowed heavily to buy their land and equipment and, as prices 
continued to fall, were unable to pay their debts. Foreclosures and the number of 
tenant farmers steadily increased in the late nineteenth century, particularly on the 
Great Plains. Farmers typically blamed their plight on others: the railroads for charg-
ing exorbitant shipping rates; the federal government for keeping the supply of 
money tight by adhering to the gold standard; and middlemen, such as grain elevator 
operators, for not paying the full value for their crops. Although organizations such 
as the Patrons of Husbandry, or the Grange, (which was founded in 1867 and grew 
quickly to more than a million members) brought redress of some grievances, discon-
tent among the farmers continued to grow at the end of the nineteenth century.

World Environmental News
Good evening and welcome to World Environmental News.
Our stories this evening: cyclones in Korea, hurricane near Mexico, flooding in 
Europe and India, volcanic eruptions in New Guinea, drought in Australia, tornadoes 
in the United States, hailstorms in Italy, earthquakes in Iran, and locusts in Denmark.
Now, let’s look at our top stories.
Drought in Australia: The wheat fields west of Canberra, New South Wales, are in 
great danger today because of the ongoing drought. In the next week, farmers may 
have to write off this year’s crop, and this will likely lead to financial ruin for many of 
them. To add to the misery, hundreds of thousands of sheep had to be sold because 
there was not enough water for them to drink.
Locusts in Denmark: The unseasonably warm weather in Denmark is proving to be 
inviting to the lowly locust. Normally found along the Mediterranean coast, the locust 
has been found far from its normal habitat. These discoveries in southwest Denmark 
are causing concern because locusts have not been seen in Denmark for over 50 years.
Hurricane near Mexico: Hurricane Herman is losing force off the Pacific coast of 
Mexico. The country is giving a sigh of relief as the hurricane winds down.
For wine drinkers: And a last note for you wine drinkers. The recent violent hail-
storms in Italy are expected to cause a poor grape harvest. This means lower wine 
production and, consequently, higher prices.
There’s more as nature lashes out. Tune in again for World Environmental News.

Analysis of the Answers
 
1. 5. England, Africa, and the West Indies all traded products: The West Indies traded 
molasses, sugar, and slaves with England for food and wood. England (via the New England 
colonies) then made the molasses and sugar into rum and traded it with Africa for more 
slaves.
 
2. 3. Rum was used to purchase slaves for use in the colonies. The other answer choices — 
colonial farms, milling of lumber, molasses and sugar, and manufactured goods — were all 
patterns of commerce but were not uses of rum.
 
3. 1. Ships were built in the colonies to increase Atlantic trade. Sewing sails, naval stores, 
milled lumber, and other crafts were products of the colonies that shipbuilding stimulated, 
but ships were the primary reason why the colonies were important to the Atlantic trade — 
the other choices were secondary.
 
4. 4. The colonies provided raw materials for British manufacturing industries. According to 
the passage, “Mercantile theory encouraged the colonies to provide raw materials for 
England’s industrializing economy . . . .”
 
5. 3. The export of hats — a finished good — from the colonies was prohibited because it 
threatened British manufacturing. Coal, pig iron, lumber, and cotton were all raw materials, 
which didn’t threaten English manufacturing.
 
6. 2. According to the first paragraph of the passage, the king neglected the colonies in a 
number of ways. Of the ways listed here, only failing to pass laws (ones that would 
alleviate grievances) is correct. Although the other choices are grievances, they can’t be 
alleviated until the appropriate laws are passed. 
 
7. 4. According to the third paragraph of the passage, the legislative bodies were forced to 
comply with the king’s rule (“. . . for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance 
with his measures. . .”).
 
8. 1. According to the fourth paragraph of the passage, when the king dissolved the 
representative houses, he threatened the rights of the people.

170
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
 
9. 5. The sixth paragraph of the passage says, “He has endeavored to prevent the population 
of these states.” In other words, he has discouraged newcomers from settling.
 
10. 3. The seventh paragraph of the passage states that the king didn’t give his approval to 
laws that would’ve created a local judicial system.
 
11. 2. The king made sure the military was independent from the colonists (last paragraph). 
This independence meant the colonists didn’t have any authority over when to hire or fire 
soldiers, how large the military was, or who the officers were. Only the king made those 
kinds of decisions.
 
12. 3. Canada was a target for the United States because it was a British possession with a 
small population (refer to the first sentence of the passage).
 
13. 1. The first paragraph states that Native Americans were loyal to the British in the war.
 
14. 5. Hull surrendered because the Shawnee cut his supply lines (refer to the second 
paragraph of the passage).
 
15. 3. The battle of Queenston Heights was a defeat for the United States — so it represented 
an embarrassment, not a victory. Refusal to march and suffering are also incorrect 
answers. A battle isn’t ever likely to be considered a proposal, so that answer choice is 
wrong, too.
 
16. 5. Although you may know that Niagara Falls kept the Royal Navy from sailing from the St. 
Lawrence River into Lake Erie, the passage doesn’t tell you so. For this reason, “not 
enough information given” is the best answer here.
 
17. 3. The last sentence of the passage states that the War of 1812 ended in a stalemate, with 
neither side claiming victory. The death of Tecumseh was also an outcome, but it wasn’t 
the overall result of the war, which is why stalemate is the best answer.
 
18. 3. As stated in the first two sentences of the passage, the issues of prime importance in the 
Civil War were liberty and equality. Happiness and friendship, safety and security, wealth 
and greed, and peace and prosperity aren’t the best answers.
 
19. 4. You know from the passage that President Lincoln was delivering his speech on a 
battlefield at Gettysburg. This fact rules out every answer choice except “on a battlefield” 
and “on the radio” (he could’ve recorded his speech, and it could’ve been broadcast by 
radio at the battlefield). However, Lincoln gave this speech in 1863, and radios hadn’t yet 
been invented.
 
20. 5. Lincoln was saying that the world would remember the soldiers who died but would not 
remember his speech. (He was wrong, given that the Gettysburg Address is one of the 
most famous speeches in American history.)
 
21. 1. Some of the battlefield was to become a burial ground for the fallen. Athletic field, cow 
pasture, shopping area, and farming aren’t relevant answer choices.
 
22. 5. The ground was hallowed by those who fought there. Lincoln doesn’t believe the people 
involved in the dedication of the battlefield can make the place holy or important; only the 
people who fought on the battlefield can do so.
 
23. 3. The word “years” follows “four score and seven,” so you can assume that phrase relates 
to time. (By the way, a score is 20 years, so four score and seven is 87 years.)
 
24. 4. Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist, so the correct answer is 
Serbia. Great Britain, France, Russia, and Germany are incorrect.
 
25. 2. Austria demanded indemnities in response to the assassination. This answer comes 
directly from the passage.
 
26. 3. Germany and France weren’t allies in the war. Although the list of allies is rather 
confusing, the passage does sum up who was on which side.

171
 Chapter 13: Answers and Explanations for the Social Studies Test
 
27. 1. You know that Great Britain entered the war when Germany invaded Belgium from the 
sentence that states, “Great Britain entered the war on August 4, following Germany’s 
invasion of neutral Belgium.”
 
28. 3. Germany was not an Allied power. About halfway through the passage is a list of the 
Central powers (on one side of the war) and the Allied powers (on the other side).
 
29. 5. Italy joined the Allies because of the Treaty of London. The Open Door Policy, increased 
tensions, territorial demands, and the expanding Japanese influence may have played a 
part, but, according to the passage, they aren’t the best answers.
 
30. 2. In the cartoon, Barack Obama is portrayed in front of a chalkboard in a classroom 
setting. Most of the students are seen as receptive to his role as an inspiring teacher. The 
other choices — comedian, disciplinarian, fashion model, or salesman — don’t go with 
the cartoon.
 
31. 5. Most of the young people are portrayed as eager to learn except for one at the back 
who’s trying to make an important point. In general, they aren’t portrayed as being bored, 
disruptive, lazy, or inattentive.
 
32. 1. Each of the students in the cartoon represents a different problem facing America, so 
the correct answer is Choice (1). The other answers don’t specifically answer the question.
 
33. 5. All of the above is the only correct choice because each of the students represents one 
of the problems facing America.
 
34. 2. New land and use of machinery have expanded farm production. The first sentence of 
the passage tells you so.
 
35. 4. Improved production drove prices down. Rising prices, underproduction, and the 
creation of a deficit are the opposite of what the passage states. The choice “led to less 
protection” is nonsense — it doesn’t have anything to do with the passage.
 
36. 1. Farmers responded to falling prices by planting more grain. Although this answer may 
go against your instinct, which may be to say that they sold their land, went deeper into 
debt, or lost their farms, the passage clearly states that they planted more grain. The word 
initially in the question is important.
 
37. 5. The phrase redress of some grievances is used to describe the Grange. Redress means “to 
set right,” and grievances means “complaints” or “disputes.”
 
38. 2. The timeline shows that, in 1900, the gold standard was adopted for U.S. currency.
 
39. 3. The Great Depression was caused by the crash of the stock market. The other answers — 
gold prices, weak currency, World War I, and President Roosevelt — may or may not have 
had some influence on the crash, but they weren’t the cause.
 
40. 5. U.S. citizens had to take all their gold to U.S. offices and not keep any in their own 
homes. The timeline and graph don’t tell you why they had to do so, just that they did. 
Turn in is the key phrase here.
 
41. 4. The U.S. currency was removed from the gold standard in 1973, not in the other dates 
listed.
 
42. 3. The best answer is that gold reached a historic high when the Soviets invaded 
Afghanistan. You have to read the timeline to answer this question.
 
43. 1. According to the newscast, Hurricane Herman is located off Mexico’s Pacific coast.
 
44. 5. Extreme drought conditions exist in Australia because of a lack of rainfall.
 
45. 1. Because of unseasonably warm weather, locusts were found in Denmark. Locusts are 
drawn to warm weather, so they’re leaving the warm Mediterranean for usually chilly 
Denmark.

172
Part III: Finding Your Way: The Social Studies Test 
 
 
46. 4. The hailstorms will ruin many of the grapes that are on the vines when the storms hit, 
which will result in a reduced grape harvest and higher wine prices in Italy. One principle 
of economics is the law of supply and demand: The less supply of something you have, 
the greater the demand is for that something, so the more you can charge for it. When 
something is in low supply, the price usually goes up.
 
47. 5. If oil prices rise, gasoline prices will rise — this answer is best according to the cartoon. 
Although you can guess that SUV sales may decrease and people may travel less as a 
result of higher oil prices, you don’t have evidence of either of these results in the cartoon.
 
48. 2. Because oil is used to fuel cars and some homes, if oil prices rise, the cost of living 
(which includes paying for gas and home heating) will also rise.
 
49. 3. The characters in the cartoon are willing to waste gasoline to drive their SUV. When you 
waste gasoline, not only do you waste money, but you also waste all the natural resources 
and energy that went into getting the oil out of the ground and turning it into gasoline.
 
50. 3. The SUV isn’t an energy saver: That’s the point of the cartoon.

Part IV
Peering at Your Specimen: 
The Science Test

In this part . . .
H
ow is the Science Test different from the other GED 
tests, and what do you have to know to pass it? The 
secrets lie within this part, which tells you all about what 
you need to know for the Science Test and how to be pre-
pared. Here we also show you how the Science Test is set 
up and give you some strategies to follow to do your best.
Like in the other parts about the specific tests, we provide 
you with two practice tests to get your feet wet. You can 
see how you did on those tests by perusing the answers 
and explanations — take the time to congratulate yourself 
when you’re right and figure out what went wrong when 
you aren’t. We recommend that you take these practice 
tests after you’ve studied and brushed up on your skills 
and science vocabulary. Mastering this set of practice 
tests tells you that you’re ready to take the real GED tests. 
If you don’t do as well as you’d hoped on these tests, you 
know you have a bit more preparation to do before you’re 
ready for the real deal.

Confronting the Science Test
In This Chapter
▶ Eyeing the skills you need to succeed on the Science Test
▶ Getting a feel for the test format
▶ Figuring out how to tackle the different question types
▶ Managing your time carefully
▶ Mastering effective preparation strategies and looking at sample problems
T
he Science Test shares some of the same features as the other tests; however, there are 
some differences. Although the questions are multiple choice (like the other tests), 
they’re based on scientific text passages or visual images, including diagrams, graphs, maps, 
and tables. To do well on the Science Test, you’re expected to have a passing knowledge of 
scientific vocabulary, and one of the best ways to improve your scientific vocabulary is to 
read scientific material and look up any words you don’t know. Rest easy that you aren’t 
expected to know the difference between terms like fission and fusion — just being slightly 
familiar with them can help you on the test.
The Science Test covers material from life science, physical science (chemistry and physics), 
and earth and space science. Don’t panic — you don’t need to memorize material from 
those subjects. You just need to be able to read and understand the material and correctly 
answer questions. The hardest part of this test is understanding science vocabulary; to help 
you out, we offer you more than one chance to improve your science vocabulary as you 
work through this chapter. In this chapter, we also help you get a feel for the Science Test’s 
format. We lift the fog from the different types of questions that may appear on your test. 
Finally, we try to help you stay awake for what may be some of the driest material on any of 
the GED tests. After you understand the words on this test, along with its basic format and 
subject areas, you can try out the practice tests in Chapters 15 and 17.
Looking at the Skills the Science Test Covers
The Science Test doesn’t test you on your knowledge of science, and you’re not expected 
to memorize any scientific information to do well on this test. Instead, this test assesses 
your ability to ferret out information presented in passages or visual materials.
 If you’re totally unfamiliar with science and its vocabulary, you’ll likely have trouble with 
the questions on this test. You’re expected to have some basic knowledge about how the 
physical world works, how plants and animals live, and how the universe operates. This 
material tests you on ideas that you observe and develop throughout your life, both in and 
out of school. You probably know a little about traction, for example, from driving and walk-
ing in slippery weather. On the other hand, you may not know a lot about equilibrium aside 
from what you read in school.

176
Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
As you take the Science Test, you’re expected to understand that science is all about 
inquiry. In fact, inquiry forms the basis of the scientific method — which is the process every 
good scientist follows when faced with an unknown. The steps of the scientific method are
 
1. Ask questions.
 
2. Gather information.
 
3. Do experiments.
 
4. Think objectively about what you find.
 
5. Look at other possible explanations.
 
6. Draw one or more possible conclusions.
 
7. Test the conclusion(s).
 
8. Tell others what you found.
 
Look at your studying for the Science Test as a scientific problem. The question you’re 
trying to answer is, “How can I increase my scientific knowledge?” Follow the scientific 
method to come up with a procedure to fix the problem. Hopefully, your solution includes 
reading, reading, and more reading! A high school science book is a great tool to use, as is a 
GED preparation book or course that teaches the basics of high school science. (Go to your 
local library to get your hands on a copy of one of these books, and check with your local 
school board to find basic science courses in your area.)
Understanding the Test Format
The Science Test contains 50 multiple-choice questions, which you have 80 minutes to 
answer. As with the other tests, the information and questions on the Science Test are 
straightforward — no one is trying to trick you. To answer the questions, you have to 
read and interpret the passages or other visual materials provided with the questions 
(and you need a basic understanding of science and the words scientists use when they 
communicate).
In terms of format, the 50 questions are grouped as sets. All the questions in a particular set 
refer to a given passage, chart, diagram, graph, map, or table. Your job is to read or review 
the material and decide on the best answer for each question based on the given material.
In terms of subject matter, the questions on the Science Test check your knowledge in the 
following areas:
 
✓ Physical science (35 percent; 17 or 18 questions): Physical science is the study of 
atoms, chemical reactions, forces, and what happens when energy and matter get 
together. As a basic review, keep the following in mind:
 
• Everything is composed of atoms. (The paper this book is printed on is composed 
of atoms, for example.)
 
• When chemicals get together, they have a reaction — unless they’re inert (which 
means they don’t react with other chemicals; inert chemicals are sort of like 
antisocial chemicals).
 
• You’re surrounded by forces and their effects. (If the floor didn’t exert a force up 
on you when you stepped down, you would go through the floor.)

177
 Chapter 14: From Aardvarks to Atoms: Confronting the Science Test
 
 For more information about physical science (which includes basic chemistry and 
basic physics), read and review a basic science textbook. You can borrow one from 
your local library (or from your local high school, if you call the office in advance and 
ask whether the school has any extras). You can also find one on the Internet. When 
reading this material, you may need definitions for some of the words or terms to make 
understanding the concepts easier. Use a good dictionary or the Internet to find these 
definitions. (If you use the Internet, enter any of the topics into a search engine and 
add “definition” after it. Become amazed at the number of hits produced, but don’t 
spend time reading them all.)
 
✓ Life science (45 percent; 22 or 23 questions): Life science is the study of cells, heredity, 
evolution, and other processes that occur in living systems. All life is composed of 
cells, which you can see under a microscope. If you don’t have access to a microscope 
and a set of slides with cells on them, most life science–related books and the Internet 
have photographs of cells that you can look at. When someone tells you that you look 
like your parents or that you remind them of another relative, they’re talking about 
heredity. Reading a bit about heredity in biology-related books can help you practice 
answering some of the questions on the Science Test.
 
 Use a biology textbook to help you review for this portion of the test. (Get your hands 
on a copy of one at your local library or high school.)
 
✓ Earth and space science (20 percent; 10 questions): This area of science looks at the 
earth and the universe, specifically weather, astronomy, geology, rocks, erosion, and 
water.
 
 When you look down at the ground as you walk, you’re interacting with earth 
sciences. When you look up at the stars on a clear night and wonder what’s really up 
there, you’re thinking about earth sciences. When you complain about the weather, 
you’re complaining about earth sciences. In a nutshell, you’re surrounded by earth 
sciences, so you shouldn’t have a problem finding materials to read on this subject.
 
You don’t have to memorize everything you read about science before you take the test. All 
the answers to the test questions are based on information provided in the passages or on 
the basic knowledge you’ve acquired over the years about science. Any science reading you 
do prior to the test not only helps you increase your basic knowledge but also improves 
your vocabulary. An improved science vocabulary increases your chances of being able to 
read the passages and answer the related questions on the test quickly.
 
As the basis for its questions, the Science Test uses the National Science Education 
Standards (NSES) content standards, which are based on content developed by science 
educators from across the country. 
Identifying the Types of Questions 
and Knowing How to Tackle Them
Like the Social Studies Test, the Science Test has two main types of questions — questions 
about textual passages and questions about visual materials (see Chapter 9 for details on 
the Social Studies Test). Having a basic understanding of these two question types can help 
you avoid any surprises when you sit down to take the test. In general, you can prepare for 
these questions similarly to how you prepare for the Social Studies Test. The following sec-
tions break down the two types of questions you encounter and offer you advice on how to 
answer them.

178
Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
 
Like with all the other GED tests, make sure you read every word and symbol that appears 
on the Science Test, including every chart, diagram, graph, map, table, passage, and 
question. Information — both relevant and irrelevant — is all over the test, and you never 
know where you’ll find what you need to answer the questions quickly and correctly. Don’t 
skip something because it doesn’t immediately look important. (Check out the “Examining 
Preparation Strategies That Work” section for more tips on how you can handle problems 
that may arise on this test.)
Questions about passages
The first question type on the Science Test is based on passages you have to read and 
understand. The written passages on this test — and the questions that accompany them — 
are very similar to a reading-comprehension test: You’re given textual material, and you 
have to answer questions about it. The passages present everything you need to answer the 
questions — but you usually have to understand all the words used in those passages to 
figure out what they’re telling you (which is why we recommend that you read as much 
science information as you can prior to the test).
The difference between this test and other reading-comprehension tests is that the 
terminology and examples are all about science. Thus, the more you read about science, 
the more science words you’ll know, understand, and be comfortable seeing on the test — 
which, as you may imagine, can greatly improve your chances of success.
 
Keep the following tips and tricks in mind when answering questions about passages:
 
✓ Read each passage and question carefully. Some of the questions on the Science Test 
assume that you know a little bit from past experience. For example, you may be 
expected to know that a rocket is propelled forward by an engine firing backward. 
(On the other hand, you won’t have to know the definition of nuclear fission — thank 
goodness!)
 
 Regardless of whether a question assumes some basic science knowledge or asks for 
an answer that appears directly in the passage, you need to read each passage and 
corresponding question carefully. As you read, do the following:
 
• Try to understand the passage, and think about what you already know about the 
subject.
 
• If a passage has only one question, read that question extra carefully.
 
• If the passage or question contains words you don’t understand, try to figure out 
what those words mean from the rest of the sentence or the entire passage.
 
✓ Read each answer choice carefully. Doing so helps you get a clearer picture of your 
options. If you select an answer without reading all the answers, you may end up 
picking the wrong one because, although that answer may seem right at first, another 
answer may be more correct. As you read the answer choices, do the following:
 
• If one answer is right from your reading and experience, mark it.
 
• If you aren’t sure which answer is right, exclude the answers you know are wrong 
and then exclude answers that may be wrong.
 
• If you can exclude all but one answer, it’s probably correct, so mark it.
Try out these tips on the sample passages and questions in the “Practicing with Sample 
Problems” section.

179
 Chapter 14: From Aardvarks to Atoms: Confronting the Science Test
Questions about visual materials
The other type of question that appears on the Science Test is the question based on visual 
materials. Visual materials are pictures that contain information you may need to answer 
the corresponding questions, and they can be in the form of tables, graphs, diagrams, or 
maps. Understanding information in visual materials takes more practice than doing so 
from textual passages because many people aren’t as familiar with getting information from 
pictures as they are with getting info from text. This section (and the practice tests in 
Chapters 15 and 17) can help you get the practice you need to do well on all the questions 
on the Science Test — including the ones based on pictures.
The following sections take a more detailed look at the different visual materials — tables, 
graphs, diagrams, and maps — that questions on the Science Test can refer to.
Tables
A table is a graphical way of organizing information (see Figure 14-1). This type of visual 
material allows for easy comparison between two or more sets of data. Some tables use 
symbols to represent information; others use words.

Most tables have titles that tell you what they’re about. Always read the titles first so you 
know right away what information the tables include. If a table gives you an explanation (or 
key) of the symbols, read the explanation carefully, too; doing so helps you understand how 
to read the table.
Graphs
A graph is a picture that shows how different sets of numbers are related. On the Science 
Test, you can find the following three main types of graphs in Figure 14-2: 
 
✓ Bar or column graphs: Use bars (horizontal) or columns (vertical) to present and 
often compare information
 
✓ Line graphs: Use one or more lines to connect points drawn on a grid to show the 
relationships between data, including changes in data over time
 
✓ Pie graphs (also called pie charts or circle graphs): Use arcs of circles (pieces of a 
pie) to show how data relates to a whole

All three types of graphs usually share the following common characteristics:
 
✓ Title: The title tells you what the graph is about, so always read the title before 
reviewing the graph.
 
✓ Horizontal axis and vertical axis: Bar, column, and line graphs have a horizontal axis 
and a vertical axis. (Pie graphs don’t.) Each axis is a vertical or horizontal reference 
line that’s labeled to give you additional information.
 
✓ Label: The label on the axis of a graph usually contains units, such as feet or dollars. 
Read all axis labels carefully; they can either help you with the answer or lead you 
astray (depending on whether you read them correctly).
 
✓ Legend: Pie graphs usually have a legend, or printed material that tells you what each 
section of the graph is about. They may also contain labels on the individual pieces of 
the pie so that you know what each piece represents.
 Graphs and tables are both often called charts, which can be rather confusing. To help you 
prepare for problems with graphs, make sure you look at and problem solve plenty of 
graphs before the test. Remember that many graphs show relationships. If the numbers repre-
sented on the horizontal axis are in millions of dollars and you think they’re in dollars, your 
interpretation of the graph will be more than a little incorrect.
Diagrams
A diagram, such as the one in Figure 14-3, is a drawing that helps you understand how 
something works.

Effects of Gravity on Supported Weight
Gravity
Excerpted from Physical Science: What the Technology Professional Needs to Know by C. Lon Enloe, Elizabeth Garnett, Jonathan Miles, and Stephen Swanson (Wiley).
Diagrams on the Science Test often have the following two components:
 
✓ Title: Tells you what the diagram is trying to show you
 
✓ Labels: Indicate the names of the parts of the diagram
When you come to a question based on a diagram, read the title of the diagram first to get 
an idea of what the diagram is about. Then carefully read all the labels to find out the main 
components of the diagram. These two pieces of information can help you understand the 
diagram well enough to answer questions about it.
Maps
A map is a drawing of some section — large or small — of the earth or another planet, 
depending on how much space exploration has been done. Because the entire world is too 
large to show you on one piece of paper, a section of it is drawn to scale and presented to 
you on the test.
Most maps give you the following information:
 
✓ Title: Tells you what area of the world the map focuses on
 
✓ Legend: Gives you general information about the colors, symbols, compass directions, 
or other graphics used on the map
 
✓ Labels: Indicate what the various points on the map represent
 
✓ Scale: Tells you what the distance on the map represents in real life (For example, a 
map with a scale of 1 inch = 100 miles shows a distance of 500 miles on the real earth 
as a distance of 5 inches on the map.)
Although maps are seldom used in science passages, they are used occasionally, so you 
want to at least be familiar with them. The best way to get familiar with maps is to spend 
some time looking at road maps and world atlases, which you can find in your local library 
or bookstore.

Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
Examining Preparation Strategies That Work
To get better results from the time and effort you put into preparing for the Science Test, 
we suggest you try the following strategies:
 
✓ Take practice tests. Chapters 15 and 17 give you full-length practice Science Tests. 
Take them. If you need more, consider purchasing additional preparation manuals that 
offer sample tests. Take as many of these practice tests as you can. Be cautious about 
time restrictions, and check your answers when you’re finished. If you don’t understand 
why some answers are correct, ask a tutor, take a preparation class, or look up the 
information in a book or on the Internet. Be sure you know why every one of your 
answers is right or wrong.
 
✓ Create your own dictionary. Get a notebook and keep track of all the new words (and 
their definitions) that you discover as you prepare for the Science Test. Make sure you 
understand all the science terminology you see or hear. Of course, this chore isn’t one 
you can do in one night. Take some time and make sure this terminology becomes part 
of your brain.
 
✓ Read as many passages as you can. We may sound like a broken record, but reading is 
the most important way to prepare for the Science Test. After you read a paragraph 
from any source (textbook, newspaper article, novel, and so on), ask yourself some 
questions about what you read. You can also ask friends and family to ask you questions 
about what you read.
Check out Chapter 3 for some general test-taking strategies to help you prepare to take the 
GED tests.
Managing Your Time for the Science Test
As we mention earlier in this chapter, the Science Test has 50 questions that you must 
answer in 80 minutes, which means you have about 90 seconds to read each textual or 
visual passage given and answer each question. If a passage has more than one question, 
you have slightly more time to answer those questions because you should read the pas-
sage only once.
To help you manage your time, we recommend you check out Chapters 2 and 3 for some 
general time-management strategies that you can use on all the tests. For the Science Test, 
specifically, we suggest you focus on these two time-saving strategies:
 
✓ For questions about passages, read the question first and then skim the material for 
the answer. The passage always contains the answer, but your background knowledge 
in science and your familiarity with scientific terms can help you understand the 
material more easily and quickly. Reading the question first provides you with a guide 
to what is being asked and what the passage is about so that you know what to look for 
as you read it.
 
✓ For questions about a visual material, such as a graph or table, read the question 
first and then scan the visual material. Look at the visual material to see the big 
picture; questions usually don’t ask about minute details.
As a general tip, answer the easiest questions first. You can then go back and spend a little 
more time on the more difficult questions. Remember, though, to plan ahead and leave a 
few minutes at the end to review your answers.

183
 Chapter 14: From Aardvarks to Atoms: Confronting the Science Test
Practicing with Sample Problems
To help increase your odds of doing well on the Science Test, you want to be as familiar as 
you can be with what you’ll encounter on the actual test. The following questions are some 
sample problems for the Science Test. Read each question carefully, and find the best 
answer based on the passages.
Questions 1 and 2 refer to the following passage.
One of the great discoveries in earth science is rocks. Rocks have many useful purposes in 
science. They can be used as paperweights to keep academic papers from flying away in the 
wind. Rocks can be used to prop laboratory doors open when the experiments go wrong 
and horrible smells are produced. Smooth rocks can be rubbed when pressure builds and 
you just need a mindless activity to get through the day.
 
1. According to the passage, one of the great discoveries in science is
 
(1) atomic energy
 
(2) static electricity
 
(3) rocks
 
(4) nectarines
 
(5) DNA
The correct answer is Choice (3). The important words in the question are According to the 
passage. When you see this phrase, you know to look in the passage for the answer. Because 
none of the answers except rocks is even remotely mentioned, rocks must be the best 
answer.
 
2. How do rocks help scientists when experiments go horribly wrong and produce terrible 
odors?
 
(1) They can be used to smash the windows.
 
(2) They can prop open the doors.
 
(3) They can be thrown in anger.
 
(4) They can be rubbed.
 
(5) Only scientists know the answer to this.
The correct answer is Choice (2). According to the passage, the rocks can be used to hold 
open the door of the lab. Rocks can also be used to smash windows and can be thrown in 
anger, but the passage doesn’t specifically mention these uses. The passage mentions 
rubbing rocks as a use of rocks, but it does so in another context.
Questions 3 through 5 refer to the following passage.
Dr. Y. Kritch was a world-famous botanist. He spent his life in search of an early blooming, 
colorful spring flower. He first developed the onelip flower, which bloomed so early that it 
immediately froze in the winter weather. After many years of research, he developed a new 
strain of flowers called the threelip, which bloomed in the late fall, just after the first frost. 
Frustrated, he decided to cross-pollinate the two blooms to develop a plant that would 
bloom in the spring. Using a special cross-averaging-pollination process, he managed to 
develop a plant that would bloom in the early spring and come in many colors. In honor of 
the averaging process, he called it a twolip, which was later changed to tulip.

3. Why did Dr. Kritch want to develop a new flower?
 
(1) He was bored.
 
(2) He wanted something named after him.
 
(3) He wanted to sell the flowers to stores.
 
(4) He needed a gift for his wife.
 
(5) Not enough information is given.
The correct answer is Choice (5). The first four answers are all possible, but the passage 
doesn’t mention any of them. The only correct answer is (5) because not much information 
is given about the doctor himself.
 
4. What was wrong with the onelip flower?
 
(1) It bloomed so late that everyone was tired of flowers.
 
(2) It never bloomed at all.
 
(3) It was an ugly color.
 
(4) It bloomed too early.
 
(5) Not enough information is given.
The correct answer is Choice (4). The passage states that the onelip bloomed so early that 
it immediately froze in the winter weather.
 
5. Based on the information in the passage, what can you assume a botanist does?
 
(1) studies the averaging process
 
(2) studies plants
 
(3) freezes to death
 
(4) sells flowers
 
(5) not enough information given
The correct answer is Choice (2). The passage describes how Dr. Kritch studied and 
developed tulip plants. Although he used the averaging process to develop the tulip, the 
passage doesn’t mention that he studied that process. No mention is made of Dr. Kritch 
selling flowers or freezing to death.
Revealing Some Helpful Pointers
Here are a few pointers to remember as you take the Science Test. (See Chapter 3 for 
more test-taking tips that apply to all GED tests.)
 
✓ Don’t panic! Your worst enemy on this or any other test is panic. Panicking takes time 
and energy, and you don’t have a surplus of both. On the Science Test, you’re expected 
to recognize and understand some scientific vocabulary, but, if you come across a 
word you don’t understand, try to figure out its meaning from the rest of the sentence. 
If you can’t do so quickly, leave it. Return to the problem at the end of the test when 
you know exactly how much time is left.

✓ Remember that reading pictures is a science. During this test, you have to answer 
questions based on visual materials, something you may not do every day. Remember 
that any visual object is like a short paragraph. It has a topic and makes comments or 
states facts about that topic. When you come across a question based on a visual mate-
rial, the first thing to do is to figure out the content of the material. Usually, visual 
objects have titles that help you understand their meanings. After you figure out the 
main idea behind the visual object, ask yourself what information you’re being given; 
rereading the question can be helpful. After you know these two pieces of 
information, you’re well on your way to answering the question.
Science on the Internet
Internet sites can increase your scientific knowledge or 
simply introduce you to a new area of interest. If you 
don’t have an Internet connection at home, try your local 
library or community center.
To save yourself time as you begin your online search 
for additional practice in reading science material, we 
suggest you check out the following sites:
 ✓ www.els.net: Contains tons of information about 
life sciences
 ✓ www.earth.nasa.gov: Contains lots of intrigu-
ing earth- and space-related info
 ✓ www.chemistry.about.com: Contains interest-
ing info related to chemistry (Note that this is a com-
mercial site, which means you’ll see pesky banners 
and commercial links amidst the interesting and 
helpful information.)
 ✓ www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/
index.pl: Contains some interesting physics les-
sons that are presented in an entertaining and infor-
mative manner
To explore on your own, go to your favorite search 
engine and type the science key words you’re most 
interested in (biology, earth science, and chemistry, just 
to name a few examples).

Why does a cinder block provide less ther-
mal transfer than a window?
 
(1) Cinder blocks are thicker.
 
(2) Windows have little insulation value.
 
(3) You can’t see through cinder blocks.
 
(4) There is no air in a cinder block.
 
(5) Windows are necessary for safety.
Directions: Choose the one best answer to each question.
Questions 1 and 2 refer to the following passage.
Insulation
During the winter, you need something to keep warmth in the house and cold air out. 
In the summer, you need something to keep heat outside and cooler air inside. What 
you need is insulation.
Insulation reduces or prevents the transfer of heat (called thermal transfer) from the 
inside out or the outside in. Fiberglass and plastic foam provide such insulation 
because they contain trapped air. Normally, air is not a good insulator because the 
currents in air transfer the heat from one place to another. Trapping the air in small 
places, however, slows or prevents the transfer of heat. Think about these little pack-
ets of air the next time you sit in a warm house, safe from the frigid air of winter.
Questions 3 through 5 refer to the following passage.
Metabolism
The process of metabolism is an essential process in every living cell. Metabolism 
allows the cell to obtain and distribute energy, which is necessary for survival. Light 
from the sun is absorbed and converted into chemical energy by photosynthesis, and 
it is this chemical energy that is necessary for animals to survive.
One of the primary carbohydrates derived from plants is glucose. Through a process 
called glycolysis, energy is obtained from glucose. This reaction takes place in mito-
chondria and the glucose molecule is broken down into pyruvic acids, which are fur-
ther broken down into molecules, such as ethanol and lactic acid. This process is 
cyclical as the energy produced keeps the fermentation going.
Pyruvic acids are broken down to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, which 
releases far more energy. What started out as sunlight has become energy that keeps 
animals alive.

 4. 
What would happen to a plant if you cov-
ered it with a cloth that does not allow light 
to pass through it?
 
(1) The plant would stop growing.
 
(2) The leaves would shrivel.
 
(3) The flower would fall off.
 
(4) The plant would starve to death.
 
(5) The roots would die.
 5. 
Which chemical is key to providing animals 
with energy?
 
(1) pyruvic acid
 
(2) carbon dioxide
 
(3) chlorophyll
 
(4) ethanol
 
(5) lactic acid
 3. 
How do animals depend on plants to stay 
alive?
 
(1) Plants provide animals with protective 
cover.
 
(2) Animals need the shade provided by 
plants.
 
(3) Cures for some diseases originate in 
plants.
 
(4) Plants provide a comfortable environ-
ment for animals.
 
(5) Plants provide animals with chemical 
potential energy.
 6. 
If force is defined as that which is required 
to change the state or motion of an object 
in magnitude and direction, how should it 
be represented?
 
(1) wavy lines
 
(2) straight line
 
(3) grams
 
(4) scalar
 
(5) vector
 7. 
If a person travels seven blocks at 3 miles 
per hour but you do not know in which 
direction, what would represent his or her 
path?
 
(1) kilometers
 
(2) scalar
 
(3) yards
 
(4) vector
 
(5) linear measure
Questions 6 and 7 refer to the following passage.
Velocity and Speed
There is a difference between speed and velocity, although sometimes you see the 
words used interchangeably. The velocity of a body is its rate of motion in a specific 
direction, such as a bicycle traveling 34 miles per hour due east. Because velocity has 
both magnitude (34 miles per hour) and direction (due east), it can be represented by 
a vector.
Speed has a magnitude only. If a bicycle travels at a speed of 28 miles per hour, you 
know its magnitude (28 miles per hour), but not its direction. Because speed has a 
magnitude but not a direction, it can be represented as a scalar.

(2) No relation exists.
 
(3) Both are scientific principles.
 
(4) Both result from explosions.
 
(5) Both are nuclear reactions.
Questions 11 through 14 refer to the following passage.
The Big Bang Theory
It is hard enough to imagine the universe as it is now and even harder to create a 
theory about how it all began. In the 1940s, George Gamow began to develop such a 
theory. Georges Lemaitre, another scientist, had also been working on the problem, 
and Gamow used some of the ideas of Lemaitre to develop his theory.
Gamow proposed the following theory: Somewhere between 10 and 21 billion years 
ago, there was a giant explosion in space. Before the explosion, the universe was the 
size of an atomic nucleus, with a temperature of about 10 billion degrees. The explo-
sion started the expansion of the universe. Quarks, or elemental particles, existed in 
huge numbers.
Within a millisecond, the universe had expanded to the size of a grapefruit. The tem-
perature cooled to 1 billion degrees. The quarks began to clump into protons and 
neutrons. Minutes later, the universe was still too hot for electrons and protons to 
form into atoms: a super-hot, fog-like environment.
With passing time and cooling temperatures, nuclear reactions took place, and within 
300,000 years, atoms of hydrogen and helium began to emerge. As the atoms formed, 
light began to shine. The universe was taking shape.
Gravity began to act on the atoms and transform them into galaxies. Within 1 billion 
years of that first great explosion, galaxies and stars began to form. Within 15 billion 
years, planets began to emerge from the heavy elements thrown off by the dying of 
stars. The universe started with a big bang and continues to grow and change accord-
ing to this theory.

they are feeding.
 
(2) Jellyfish sting and eat small ocean 
 creatures.
 
(3) The fish are afraid of the strange- 
looking creatures.
 
(4) Jellyfish and ocean creatures compete 
for the same food sources.
 
(5) Fish cannot swim as fast as jellyfish.
Questions 15 through 17 refer to the following passage.
The Jellyfish
One of the creatures living in all the world’s oceans is the jellyfish. Although it lives in 
the ocean, it is not a fish. The jellyfish is an invertebrate; that is, an animal lacking a 
backbone. Not only does it lack a backbone, but the jellyfish has no heart, blood, 
brain, or gills and is over 95-percent water.
The jellyfish has a body and tentacles. These tentacles are the long tendrils around 
the bell-like structure that contain stinging cells, which are used to capture prey. The 
movement of the prey triggers the sensory hair in the stinging cell, and the prey is 
then in trouble.
Unfortunately, people are also in trouble if they get too close to the tentacles of a jel-
lyfish. The stings are not fatal to humans but can cause a great deal of discomfort.

(3) The salt will disappear.
 
(4) The total mass will remain the same.
 
(5) Some water will disappear.
Questions 18 through 25 refer to the following passage.
Laws of Conservation
You are faced with laws every day. You cannot speed on the roads, and you cannot 
park wherever you choose.
Science has its laws, as well. One such law is that energy cannot be created or 
destroyed. This law, called the Law of Conservation of Energy, makes sense because 
you cannot create something from nothing. And if you have an electrical charge, you 
cannot simply make it disappear.
A further law of conservation is the Law of Conservation of Matter, which says that 
matter cannot be created or destroyed. This means that when a chemical change 
occurs, the total mass of an object remains constant. When you melt an ice cube, the 
water that results is neither heavier nor lighter than the original ice cube.

(4) Scientists look for connections between 
travel and caterpillars.
 
(5) Someone asked the scientists about it.
Questions 26 through 28 refer to the following passage.
Why Do Birds Fly South for the Winter?
Every fall, the sky is full of birds flying south for the winter. However, you can still see 
a few birds in the northern part of the country during the winter. Scientists have 
advanced theories about this phenomenon.
Some birds eat insects for food. In winter, many species of birds fly south, because 
that’s where the food exists. In southern states, insects are available all year long, 
providing a banquet for the birds, whereas in the northern parts of the country, 
insects (as well as other food sources, such as seeds and berries) are scarce or even 
nonexistent during the winter. The birds fly south for winter to follow the food. In the 
spring, as insects once again become plentiful in the northern states, the birds still 
follow the food, this time to the north.

 29. What destroyed the ecological balance in 
Lake Victoria?
 
(1) local merchants
 
(2) shrinking populations of snails
 
(3) freshwater lake
 
(4) growing populations of smaller fish
 
(5) the Nile Perch
 30. Why is it never a good idea to introduce a 
foreign species into a stable lake?
 
(1) The foreign species has plenty of 
predators.
 
(2) The foreign species is too attractive.
 
(3) The other species in the lake would not 
have to compete for food.
 
(4) The foreign species is bad for sport 
fishermen.
 
(5) The foreign species can upset the eco-
logical balance.
Questions 29 and 30 refer to the following passage.
The Law of Unintended Consequences
Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in Africa. It once had abundant fish, which 
provided protein for the local people who ate the fish. Unfortunately, a new species — 
the Nile Perch — was introduced into the lake by fishermen looking for a challenging 
fishing experience to attract their share of tourists interested in exploring the area.
The Nile Perch is an aggressive predator and had no natural enemies in Lake Victoria. 
It quickly ate up large numbers of the smaller fish, which affected the diets of the 
local population. These smaller fish ate algae and parasite-bearing snails. Without the 
smaller fish eating them, the live algae spread over the surface of the lake. Dead algae 
sank to the bottom of the lake and decayed, a process that consumed oxygen neces-
sary for the fish living deep in the lake.
The snails, without natural predators, and the parasites they carried multiplied, creat-
ing a serious health hazard to the population. The introduction of a fish to encourage 
tourism had a detrimental effect on the lake and the population that depended on it.

 31. If you were an aeronautical engineer plan-
ning a journey to Mars, why would you 
prefer to go to a space station on the moon 
and then launch the rocket to Mars, rather 
than going directly from Earth to Mars?
 
(1) Lower gravity on the moon means you 
need less fuel for the launch.
 
(2) You have more space to take off and 
land on the moon.
 
(3) No atmosphere means an easier takeoff.
 
(4) The moon is closer to Earth than Mars.
 
(5) Not enough information is given.
 32. If you were a communications engineer 
trying to establish a safety network to warn 
a rocket ship of dangers, where would you 
place the transmitter for this rocket ship’s 
journey to Mars?
 
(1) on the moon
 
(2) on Earth
 
(3) on Mars
 
(4) at the space station
 
(5) not enough information given
 33. Why would a trip to the moon be a better 
first choice than a trip to Mars for space 
travelers?
 
(1) You can see the moon from Earth with-
out a telescope.
 
(2) The time of the trip is much shorter.
 
(3) The moon has a better atmosphere.
 
(4) There are already space vehicles on 
the moon.
 
(5) You could phone home from the moon.
 34. If you held a pole-vaulting contest on the 
moon and Mars, on which planet could the 
same contestant vault higher with the same 
expenditure of energy?
 
(1) the moon
 
(2) Mars
 
(3) Earth

 35. According to the passage, what is a pri-
mary determinant for characteristics of the 
next generation?
 
(1) chance
 
(2) hair color
 
(3) pea plants
 
(4) heredity
 
(5) nature
 36. What are the factors that Mendel hypothe-
sized carried traits from one generation to 
the next?
 
(1) plants
 
(2) peas

(1) orange pumpkins
 
(2) doesn’t matter if you have special 
fertilizer
 
(3) monster-sized pumpkins
 
(4) larger-than-average pumpkins
 
(5) healthy pumpkins
Questions 35 through 37 refer to the following passage.
Heredity, Then and Now
How often have you seen a young child and said, “She takes after her parents.” Many 
traits in a child do come from her parents. Physical and other characteristics, such as 
hair color and nose shape, are transmitted from one generation to the next. These 
characteristics, passed from one generation to the next, exist because of genetic code.
The first scientist to experiment with heredity was Gregor Mendel during the 19th 
century. Mendel experimented with pea plants and noted that characteristics appear-
ing in “child” plants were similar to the “parent” plants. Mendel hypothesized that 
these characteristics were carried from generation to generation by “factors.” It took 
many years of research to understand why children often look like their parents, but 
genetic code is now the basis of the study of heredity.

 38. Why would the booster be jettisoned?
 
(1) to have more fuel for later in the trip
 
(2) because the shuttle needs to add 
weight
 
(3) to increase the size of the shuttle
 
(4) to make the shuttle less maneuverable 
for landing
 
(5) because it is no longer needed
 39. Which part of a shuttle carries the 
payload?
 
(1) booster
 
(2) cockpit
 
(3) orbiter
 
(4) rocket
 
(5) Challenger
Questions 38 and 39 refer to the following passage.
The Space Shuttle
NASA has designed and built six space shuttles: Atlantis, Challenger, Columbia, 
Discovery, Endeavor, and Enterprise. The space shuttles are made up of two distinct 
parts: the orbiter and the booster rocket. The booster rocket provides the additional 
thrust to get the space shuttle away from the gravitational pull of the earth. The 
orbiter carries the people and payload as well as the workings of the shuttle. In a 
space flight, the booster is jettisoned after clearing the earth’s gravitational pull, and 
the orbiter continues on its way.
 40. Work is defined as the product of force 
times displacement. Consider the diagram. 
If the force of gravity is greater than the 
forces being exerted by the muscles con-
trolling the hand, what would happen?
 
(1) Nothing would happen.
 
(2) The hand would move downward.
 
(3) The hand would move to the right.
 
(4) The hand would move upward.
 
(5) The hand would move to the left.
 41. If an athlete knows that building muscles 
requires doing work against a weight, what 
would the athlete want to change in this 
diagram?
 
(1) nothing
 
(2) moving the hand upward faster
 
(3) adding weight to the hand
 
(4) closing the fist as the arm is raised
 
(5) exhaling as the arm is raised

 42. What process in the polymerase chain 
reaction separates the DNA strands?
 
(1) heating
 
(2) chemicals
 
(3) pulling
 
(4) gravity
 
(5) chilling
 43. In order to clone an organism, you require 
an identical DNA blueprint. Why is the PCR 
something a scientist who is interested in 
cloning would want to study?
 
(1) It creates an identical copy of the DNA.
 
(2) PCR clones animals.
 
(3) Scientists should know everything.
 
(4) A duplicate DNA structure cools clones.
 
(5) The heat destroys clones.
Questions 42 and 43 refer to the following passage, which is adapted from The Sciences: An 
Integrated Approach, 3rd Edition, by James Trefil and Robert M. Hazen (Wiley).
Copying DNA Sequence
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) copies a sequence of DNA. In order to do this, a 
strand of DNA is mixed with nucleotides (DNA precursors). Nucleotides target a spe-
cific piece of DNA, as well as polymerase, an enzyme that helps to assemble DNA. 
Heat is applied until the temperature reaches 200°F. The energy from the heating sep-
arates the DNA strands. The mixture is then cooled to 140°F. At this temperature, the 
primers attach themselves to the DNA strands. Raising the temperature to 160°F 
causes the nucleotides to begin to attach to the DNA strands. After all this, two 
copies of the DNA are created.
 44. What feature makes the wolf better 
adapted to hunting in the wild?
 
(1) heavier coat
 
(2) larger body
 
(3) larger teeth
 
(4) larger paws
 
(5) deeper growl
 45. Of the members of the Canidae family that 
were mentioned, why is the dog the only 
household pet?
 
(1) There are many types of dogs to 
choose from.
 
(2) Dogs were domesticated.
 
(3) Dogs are smaller than wolves.
 
(4) Dogs protect people’s houses.
 
(5) Dogs can help the visually impaired.
Questions 44 and 45 refer to the following passage.
Dogs and Wolves — Relatives?
Current scientific theory is that the familiar family pet, the dog, descended from the 
wolf, but the dog has taken a very different path. The dog was the first animal to be 
domesticated, right around the end of the Ice Age.
Dogs are part of an extended family called Canidae, which contains 38 different spe-
cies. Jackals, foxes, wolves, and dogs are all part of this family. Although they are 
related, wolves and dogs are different. Wolves have smaller heads for the same body 
weight. Dogs have smaller teeth, a more curved lower jaw, and eyes that are more 
rounded and forward looking. At a distance, however, many of these differences are 
difficult to spot.

 46. What determines the atomic number?
 
(1) number of isotopes
 
(2) number of neutrons
 
(3) number of electrons

(5) number of chemicals
 47. Isotopes of a chemical have the same
 
(1) number of neutrons
 
(2) number of atoms
 
(3) mass number
 
(4) size
 
(5) atomic number
 48. A scientist has found related atoms in two 
different substances. If both atoms have 
the same atomic number but different mass 
numbers, what preliminary conclusion can 
be reached about the atoms?
 
(1) They are the same substance.
 
(2) They are isotopes.
 
(3) They are different substances.
 
(4) One is a compound of the other.
 
(5) It is too early to make any decisions.
Questions 46 through 48 refer to the following passage.
Isotopes
Isotopes are chemical cousins. They are related to each other, but each isotope has 
slightly different — but related — atoms. Each of the related atoms has the same 
number of electrons or protons but a different number of neutrons. Because the 
number of electrons or protons determines the atomic number, isotopes have the 
same atomic number.
The number of neutrons determines the mass number. Because the number of neu-
trons in each isotope is different, the mass number is also different. These cousins all 
have different mass numbers but the same atomic number. Their chemical properties 
are similar but not the same. Like most cousins, they have family resemblances, but 
each has a unique personality.

 49. Bears survive the winter by
 
(1) going south
 
(2) living in warm caves
 
(3) growing a heavy winter coat
 
(4) absorbing the sun’s rays to keep warm
 
(5) finding a safe shelter and hibernating
 50. Why should you not disturb a hibernating 
animal?
 
(1) It gets grouchy when awakened 
 suddenly.
 
(2) It needs its sleep.
 
(3) It could have trouble falling asleep again.
 
(4) You should never bother a wild animal.
 
(5) It would not be able to find enough 
food to survive.
Questions 49 and 50 refer to the following passage.
How to Survive the Winter
When the temperature drops and the wind blows cold, you may think of animals that 
don’t have homes to keep out the cold and worry about their ability to survive the 
winter. Not much food is available, temperatures in northern states go into the sub-
zero range, and shelter is limited. How do they survive the winter?
Many animals can hibernate for the winter. Hibernation is a sleep-like condition in 
which the animal’s heartbeat, temperature, and metabolism slow down to adapt to 
the colder temperatures. This dormant condition prevents their starving or freezing 
during the harsh winters.

Answers and Explanations 
for the Science Test
A
fter taking the Science Test in Chapter 15, use this chapter to check your answers. 
Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers that we provide 
in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed the answers you did. 
You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you answered correctly 
because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought process that helped 
you choose the correct answers.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key.
Analysis of the Answers
 
1. 2. Glass contains no encapsulated air and, thus, provides neither insulation nor greater 
thermal flow. Choice (1), that cinder blocks are thicker, can be true, but it doesn’t 
answer the question about heat transfer. Choice (2), that windows have little insulation 
value, is the best answer. Choice (3), that you can’t see through cinder blocks, is true and 
interesting but irrelevant to the question. Choice (4), that there is no air in a cinder block, is 
inaccurate. Choice (5), that windows are necessary for safety, is not only irrelevant, but 
also incorrect. To answer this question, you need to know that good insulators contain 
trapped air and that glass doesn’t. It’s assumed that this information is general knowledge 
for someone at this educational level.
 
2. 3. The passage says that insulation is necessary for reduced heat transfer, which keeps 
you warmer. All the answers except Choice (3) refer to clothing made of a single layer 
of material. The cotton padding acts as insulation for the trousers because the cotton 
contains trapped air.
 
3. 5. The last paragraph of the passage states that animals must eat food with chemical 
potential energy, which is derived from plants. The other answers are irrelevant to the 
information in the passage.
 
 This passage gives you a lot of interesting information, but because you have a time limit, 
you may want to read the question first and then look for the answer in the passage 
instead of reading the passage, reading the question, and then reading the passage again.
 
4. 4. Plants produce food using energy from the sun. If you cut off the energy from the sun, 
you cut off the food supply. The other answers may be symptoms of a plant’s starving to 
death, but Choice (4) sums up the information in one answer.
 
5. 1. According to the passage, pyruvic acid is key to energy production. This question is a 
good example of why a little bit of knowledge and familiarity with the words and names 
used in science are helpful on these tests. All the answer choices in this question are 
chemical names, and some familiarity with them would make answering the question 
easier.

Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
 
6. 5. The passage states that velocity can be represented by a vector because it has both 
magnitude and direction. Force is defined as changing the state or motion of an object, 
either in magnitude or direction. Because a force has magnitude and direction, it’s 
represented by a vector. The information needed to answer this question is in the last 
sentence of the first paragraph. You can ignore the first three answer choices completely 
because they have very little to do with the question. Choice (4) requires you to know the 
difference between a vector and a scalar. The last line of each paragraph in the passage 
contains the definitions you need.
 
7. 2. If a person travels seven blocks from home to school, only the distance is defined. The 
person can go four blocks due east and three blocks due west. He or she can take a 
roundabout path involving all four points of the compass. You really don’t know what the 
person is doing except somehow traveling seven blocks to school. This activity has only a 
magnitude and no direction, so it’s represented by a scalar. After you understand the 
definition of a scalar, which you need to answer question 6, this question is easier to 
answer. You can ignore Choices (1) and (3) because they are measures of length and do 
not answer the question. Choice (4) is wrong because a vector has both magnitude and 
direction, and Choice (5) is irrelevant.
 
8. 2. In the steam engine, water cools the steam, which then condenses, occupying less 
space. This action starts the entire cycle over again. You can eliminate the other answer 
choices when guessing is necessary. Choice (1) is incorrect because water and steam are 
both water, in different states. Their densities may be different, but their weights are the 
same. Only the volume differs when water turns to steam. Choice (3) is incorrect because 
the boiler doesn’t provide the energy to move the pump, which you can see by looking at 
the diagram. Choice (4) isn’t based on information given in the diagram. Nowhere are you 
told the weight of the pump rod. Choice (5) isn’t based on the diagram, on fact, or on 
general knowledge.
 
9. 3. The pump pushes water into the cistern. The other choices don’t answer the question 
based on the information provided in the diagram. Knowing how to answer questions 
based on diagrams is a useful skill to have for tests like this one.
 
10. 3. The producers provide food for the consumers. If the producers stay the same but the 
consumers increase, the consumers won’t have enough food, so the consumers will starve. 
The other answer choices are incorrect based on the information provided.
 
11. 3. The passage states that the temperature of the first tiny particles was 10 billion degrees.
 
 This question is excellent for practicing your skimming skills to find the answer. When you 
skim the passage, the words 10 billion degrees should jump out at you. By reading the 
whole sentence, you confirm that your answer is correct. The other answer choices are 
wrong, and your skimming skills take charge. When an answer is as definite as this one, 
skimming the passage is usually helpful.
 
12. 5. The last paragraph states that gravity transformed the atoms into galaxies. This 
question is another example of when a basic knowledge of science-related words can be 
helpful.
 
13. 3. The passage states that quarks are elemental particles. This question asks for a 
definition. A quick skim of the passage guides you toward the last sentence in the second 
paragraph, which contains the definition you’re looking for.
 
14. 5. An atomic bomb uses a nuclear reaction to produce its massive damage. The passage 
states that hydrogen and helium atoms were formed by nuclear reactions. The other 
choices don’t answer the question based on the passage. Choice (1) may be right, but 
it’s irrelevant in this context. Choices (2) and (4) are incorrect; and Choice (3) may be 
interesting in another context, but it’s wrong here.
 
15. 4. According to the passage (third sentence in the first paragraph), invertebrates have no 
backbones. The other choices may be correct, but they don’t answer the question. Here 

209
 Chapter 16: Answers and Explanations for the Science Test
and in all questions on this test, you’re looking for the best answer that answers the 
question posed. Don’t get sidetracked by other choices that are correct based on your 
knowledge or even based on the passage. The answer to the question posed is always the 
best response on a multiple-choice test.
 
16. 4. Jellyfish can sting swimmers, and the stings are painful. You find this information in the 
last sentence of the third paragraph. The other choices don’t answer the question based 
on the passage. For example, Choice (3) may be the stuff nightmares are based on, but the 
information or misinformation isn’t in the passage, so you can’t consider it.
 
17. 2. Small ocean creatures are always on the menu for jellyfish. Creatures, in general, avoid 
predators — a fact that’s general science knowledge.
 
 Reading some science articles or books is good preparation for this test, but always 
remember not to base your answers on your prior reading. Rather, base all your answers 
on the material presented in the passages.
 
18. 2. The passage states that energy can’t be created or destroyed, so the energy from the 
lightning must be transformed into another type of energy. The other answer choices 
imply that the energy has somehow disappeared, which the passage says can’t happen.
 
19. 1. Science is an ordered discipline and, as such, needs laws to maintain its organization. 
The first sentence in the second paragraph spells out this idea. Choice (5) may be true, but 
it’s irrelevant. Choice (2) is obviously incorrect. Choices (3) and (4) may be interesting for 
conversation, but they don’t answer the question using the material in the passage.
 
20. 4. Matter can’t be created or destroyed. Thus, a rabbit can’t appear except by illusion. The 
other answer choices seem scientific but have nothing to do with the question. Always 
read the question carefully to make sure you’re answering it.
 
21. 5. When ice melts, it turns into water. Although the amount of water in a melting iceberg is 
tiny compared to the amount of water in the ocean, it does add some water to the ocean. 
Choices (1) and (2) are incorrect because, although the melting of the iceberg and the 
warming of the water may be the results of global warming, these choices don’t answer the 
question. Choices (3) and (4) are incorrect. This question is a good example of what can 
happen if you read a question too quickly and answer it from general knowledge. Use the 
information in the passage to find the best answer to the question.
 
22. 1. Flashlights provide light by using the energy in the battery. The passage says that 
energy can’t be created or destroyed, so the energy in the battery must have been converted 
or transformed into something else. In reality, even if you don’t use a battery for an 
extended time, the battery grows weaker because of other reactions inside the cell. But 
this tidbit isn’t mentioned in the passage and is just a reminder not to leave batteries in 
your flashlight forever.
 
23. 4. If you add 3 ounces of water to 1 ounce of salt, you have 4 ounces of combined ingredients. 
The combined mass is the same as the sum of the individual masses. The volume may be 
different, but the question doesn’t ask you about the volume. Choices (1) and (5) may 
seem to be relevant if not correct, but they don’t answer the question because they have 
nothing to do with mass. Choice (3) is also wrong because the salt doesn’t disappear; it 
dissolves in the water.
 
24. 3. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can’t be created or destroyed. 
Thus, the energy developed by the ball rolling down the hill can’t disappear. In reality, 
there’s friction between the ball and the ground that slows it down, and the hills don’t go 
on forever — so the ball will eventually come to rest. You may have learned this information 
elsewhere, but it doesn’t answer the question based on the passage. No information in the 
passage supports Choices (1) and (5). Choice (2) may be true, but it’s irrelevant, and 
Choice (4) is cute but incorrect.

210
Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
 
25. 4. Conservation of energy is a law of science. You can immediately eliminate the other 
answers because they are obviously irrelevant. Choice (4) is the only choice that answers 
the question.
 
26. 3. The passage states that the lack of food in the winter months makes most birds fly south 
to find sources of food. When the food returns to the northern states, so do the birds. The 
other choices don’t answer the question based on the information in the passage.
 
27. 3. Some birds eat insects for their food supply. If an area has no insects, the birds move to 
find a new source of food. General reading in science tells you that living creatures go 
where the food is. Even human beings, who can choose where to live, are unlikely to move 
somewhere that lacks food. Other creatures have a more basic instinct to move to where 
there’s a supply of food. Thus, the insects have a responsibility for the birds’ migration — 
although their main contribution is being eaten.
 
28. 1. Scientists are curious about anything that happens regularly that can’t be easily 
explained. Migration is one such issue. Choice (5) may have happened, but it isn’t spelled 
out in the passage. The key word here is Every at the beginning of the first sentence.
 
29. 5. This question may have many answers, from sport fishermen to algae to snails. Of the 
potential answers given, however, Nile Perch is the best one because the introduction of 
this species caused all the subsequent problems.
 
30. 5. This question asks you to make a general statement about foreign species of fish. 
Although this question doesn’t ask you specifically to consider the Lake Victoria example, 
you’re supposed to think about that example as you answer the question. Using the Lake 
Victoria example, you can safely say that a foreign species upsets the local ecological 
balance. You also know from the example that the other four choices are incorrect.
 
31. 1. The less fuel you need to launch, the less you have to carry. The gravity on the moon is 
less than that on Earth, so you need less force and less fuel to break free of gravity. 
Choices (2), (3), and (4) may seem to have a ring of truth, but they don’t answer the 
question.
 
32. 5. The only locations mentioned in the table are Mars and the moon, and you’re supposed 
to answer the question based on the material given. Thus, you don’t have enough informa-
tion to answer the question.
 
33. 2. According to the table, it takes just 3 days to get to the moon, which is a much better 
first choice than the 1.88 years needed to get to Mars. The other choices are 
irrelevant to the question and the given table.
 
34. 1. Gravity on the moon is less than that on Mars. Because gravity is the force that attracts 
you to the moon (or to Earth or to Mars), the less the gravity, the less the attraction 
between you and the surface on which you stand, and, thus, the higher and farther you 
can jump — which, as you may know, is the goal of a pole-vaulting contest.
 
35. 4. The passage states that heredity determines the characteristics of the next generation. 
The only other answer choice mentioned in the passage is Choice (3), but this choice 
doesn’t answer the question.
 
36. 5. The passage states, “These characteristics, passed from one generation to the next, are 
called the genetic code.” Thus, the best answer is Choice (5), genetic code.
 
37. 3. If children inherit the traits of their parents, you want the desired traits of your child 
pumpkin to be a part of the traits of the parent pumpkins. Monster-sized pumpkin seeds 
have a better chance of producing extra large pumpkins than do the seeds from a regular-
sized pumpkin. Although Choice (2) seems like a possibility, the passage doesn’t mention 
the effects of fertilizer on monster-pumpkin production.
 
38. 5. All the choices except Choice (5) — that the booster is no longer needed — are incorrect 
because they’re in direct opposition to the passage. If you can quickly eliminate some or 

211
 Chapter 16: Answers and Explanations for the Science Test
most of the answer choices, you can save time answering the question. In this case, you 
can eliminate four answers, making the final choice easy and quick.
 
39. 3. Because the booster is jettisoned after takeoff, the orbiter has to carry everything that 
continues on the trip. Choices (2), (4), and (5) are wrong and can be quickly eliminated.
 
40. 2. If the force pushing down is greater than the force pushing up, the hand would move 
down. Although this question is based on the given diagram, which gives a general idea of 
what happens when a hand holds weight, the answer to the question is in the first part of 
the question itself. If the force of gravity (the downward force) is greater than the force of 
the muscles moving upward, the resultant force would be downward.
 
41. 3. A larger weight in the hand would produce a greater force downward. Thus, the athlete 
would have to work harder against this extra weight (and, as a result, would build more 
muscle). Making the displacement of the hand larger would also increase the work done, 
but this isn’t an answer choice.
 
42. 1. The fourth sentence in the passage tells you that heating is the process that separates 
DNA strands. The other choices either don’t answer the question or are wrong.
 
43. 1. Cloning requires identical DNA. As you can see from the first sentence of the passage, 
PCR provides identical copies of DNA.
 
44. 3. The larger teeth of the wolf are better for hunting. The third sentence of the third 
paragraph of the passage states that dogs have smaller teeth, which means wolves must 
have bigger teeth. Although this information isn’t stated directly in the passage, it’s 
implied. You’re expected to be able to draw conclusions from the information given, so 
read carefully. The other answer choices are incorrect. True, some dogs have heavier 
coats, larger bodies, and so on, but this information isn’t in the passage. You can answer 
the question using only information given or implied in the passage — not information 
from your general knowledge or prior reading.
 
45. 2. The passage states that the dog was domesticated very long ago. A domesticated 
animal is preferable to a wild one for a household pet. The other answers may be factually 
correct, but they aren’t part of the information included in the passage.
 
46. 3. According to the first sentence of the passage, the atomic number is determined by the 
number of electrons or protons. Skimming the paragraph after reading the question for key 
words in the question makes choosing the correct answer faster and easier.
 
47. 5. The last sentence of the first paragraph of the passage states that isotopes have the 
same atomic number.
 
 In most cases, you don’t have to memorize factual information for these tests; the 
passages give you the factual information you need to know. Remember that the answers 
are based on the factual information given.
 
48. 2. The last sentence of the first paragraph of the passage states that isotopes have the 
same atomic number. The second sentence of the second paragraph tells you that isotopes 
have different mass numbers. This question requires using two bits of information from 
two different locations in the passage to decide on the right answer.
 
49. 5. According to the first sentence of the second paragraph of the passage, bears survive 
the winter by finding a safe shelter and hibernating.
 
50. 5. Animals hibernate in the winter when food is scarce (a fact implied from the last sentence 
in the second paragraph). If you wake up a hibernating animal, that animal awakes to a 
strange environment without its usual sources of food and probably wouldn’t be able to 
find enough food to survive. The other answer choices may be right in some circumstances, 
but they don’t relate to the passage. Choice (4) is good advice, but it isn’t a good answer.

Which part of the tulip allows it to survive 
a rough winter?
 
(1) the leaves
 
(2) the buds
 
(3) the bulb
 
(4) the roots
 
(5) the stem
 2. 
If you wanted an early blooming plant to 
give your garden color in spring, which of 
the following would you plant?
 
(1) rose
 
(2) petunia
 
(3) tulip
 
(4) begonia
 
(5) impatiens
 3. 
When you are enjoying your garden in 
spring or summer, the flowers that look so 
pretty are composed of cells. These cells 
are the basic unit of all living things in the 
universe. In addition to flowers, weeds, 
trees, and even you are composed of cells. 
Although garden plants are composed of 
cells, the cells are different from plant to 
plant. That is why some plants produce 
roses and others produce dandelions.
  
Which of the following is not composed of 
cells?
 
(1) dogs
 
(2) flowers
 
(3) gravity
 
(4) Sir Isaac Newton
 
(5) the forest
Directions: Choose the one best answer to each question.
Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following passage.
Hibernating Plants
Tulips are beautiful flowers that come up early every spring. They are fragile in 
appearance but manage to survive the uncertain weather of spring, blooming for a 
while, and then sleeping for the rest of the year. The next year, they are ready to peek 
out of the earth and brighten your spring again.
Tulips survive because they grow from bulbs. Each bulb stores moisture and food 
during good weather. When the weather turns, the plant hibernates: The roots 
and leaves dry out and fall off, but the bulb develops a tough outer skin to protect 
itself. The bulb becomes dormant until the following spring, when the whole cycle 
begins again.

In the movies, guns with blank cartridges 
are used for effect. What part of the car-
tridge would be different from a cartridge 
used for target practice?
 
(1) bullet
 
(2) casing
 
(3) barrel
 
(4) gunpowder
 
(5) projectile
 5. 
If you wanted to reduce the force with 
which a projectile was hurled out of the 
barrel, what would you change?
 
(1) Use a smaller jacket.
 
(2) Use a smaller projectile.
 
(3) Use a smaller gun.
 
(4) Use less gunpowder in the jacket.
 
(5) Use more gunpowder.
Questions 4 and 5 refer to the following passage.
Gunpowder
As you watch a Western on television, have you ever wondered how the bullet is pro-
pelled out of the gun when the trigger is pulled?
Bullets are made of two parts, the jacket and the projectile. The jacket is filled with 
gunpowder and an ignition device, and when the ignition device is hit, the gunpowder 
explodes, hurling the projectile out of the barrel of the gun.
 6. 
Why is the rocket engine the perfect pro-
pulsion method for space travel?
 
(1) It’s very powerful.
 
(2) It can operate without an external 
 oxidizer.
 
(3) It carries a lot of fuel.
 
(4) You can’t hear the noise it makes.
 
(5) It accelerates quickly.
 7. 
Fuel on a rocket ship may be
 
(1) an oxidizer
 
(2) a gas
 
(3) an air
 
(4) an expansion
 
(5) a liquid
Questions 6 and 7 refer to the following passage.
Rocket Propulsion
Have you ever wondered how a rocket ship moves? Perhaps you have seen science-
fiction movies in which a captain uses a blast of the rocket engines to save the ship 
and its crew from crashing into the surface of a distant planet.
Usually, a fuel, such as the gas in a car, needs an oxidizer, like air, to create combus-
tion, which powers the engine. In space, there is no air and, thus, no oxidizer. The 
rocket ship, being a clever design, carries its own oxidizer. The fuel used may be a 
liquid or a solid, but the rocket ship always has fuel and an oxidizer to mix together. 
When the two are mixed and combustion takes place, a rapid expansion is directed 
out the back of the engine. The force pushing backward moves the rocket ship for-
ward. In space, with no air, the rocket ship experiences no resistance to the move-
ment. The rocket ship moves forward, avoids the crash, or does whatever the crew 
wants it to do.

(4) It saves money.
 
(5) Newspapers do not fit into compost 
heaps.
 10. Why is solid waste compacted in a modern 
landfill?
 
(1) to reduce the odor
 
(2) to help the bacteria decompose the 
waste
 
(3) to make the landfill look better
 
(4) to reduce the amount of space it 
occupies
 
(5) to speed up the nitrogen cycle
 11. What is the modern landfill compared to?
 
(1) an efficient way of ridding cities of solid 
waste
 
(2) a garbage lasagna
 
(3) a place for bacteria to decompose 
solid waste
 
(4) a site for archeologists to explore
 
(5) a huge compost bin
Questions 8 through 16 refer to the following passage.
Where Does All the Garbage Go?
When we finish using something, we throw it away, but where is away? In our modern 
cities, away is usually a landfill site, piled high with all those things that we no longer 
want. A modern American city generates solid waste or garbage at an alarming rate. 
Every day, New York City produces 17,000 tons of garbage and ships it to Staten 
Island, where it is added to yesterday’s 17,000 tons in a landfill site. We each produce 
enough garbage every five years to equal the volume of the Statue of Liberty. In spite 
of all the efforts to increase recycling, we go on our merry way producing garbage 
without thinking about where it goes.
In any landfill, gone is not forgotten by nature. By compacting the garbage to reduce 
its volume, we slow the rate of decomposition, which makes our garbage last longer. 
In a modern landfill, the process produces a garbage lasagna. There’s a layer of com-
pacted garbage covered by a layer of dirt, covered by a layer of compacted garbage 
and so on. By saving space for more garbage, we cut off the air and water needed to 
decompose the garbage and, thus, preserve it for future generations. If you could dig 
far enough, you might still be able to read forty-year-old newspapers. The paper may 
be preserved, but the news is history.
One of the answers to this problem is recycling. Any object that can be reused in one 
form or another is an object that shouldn’t be found in a landfill. Most of us gladly 
recycle our paper, which saves energy and resources. Recycled paper can be used 
again and even turned into other products. Recycling old newspapers is not as valu-
able as hidden treasure, but when the cost of landfills and the environmental impact 
of producing more and more newsprint is considered, it can be a bargain. If plastic 
shopping bags can be recycled into a cloth-like substance which can be used to make 
reusable shopping bags, maybe American ingenuity can find ways to reduce all that 
garbage being stored in landfills before the landfills overtake the space for cities.

 15. If municipalities lose money recycling 
paper, why do they continue?
 
(1) The politicians don’t know they are 
losing money.
 
(2) Municipalities don’t have to make 
money.
 
(3) The public likes to recycle paper.
 
(4) The cost is less than acquiring more 
landfill sites.
 
(5) Recycling paper has become part of 
urban life.
 16. How does recycling paper save money for 
the city?
 
(1) Recycling trucks run on diesel fuel.
 
(2) New landfill sites cost money to buy.
 
(3) Municipalities don’t have to burn the 
paper.
 
(4) In a landfill site, the heavy machinery 
uses a lot of fuel.
 
(5) Newspapers have to be delivered.
 12. Why is it important for cities to establish 
recycling programs?
 
(1) It makes people feel good about their 
garbage.
 
(2) It is cheaper to recycle.
 
(3) Recycling lets someone else look after 
your problem.
 
(4) You are running out of bacteria to 
decompose waste.
 
(5) It is cheaper than the cost of new land-
fill sites.
 13. What can individual Americans do to 
reduce the amount of waste that is going 
into the landfills?
 
(1) Eat less.
 
(2) Reuse and recycle as much as possible.
 
(3) Stop using paper.
 
(4) Import more nitrogen.
 
(5) Grow more bacteria.
 14. Bacteria provide what helpful purpose in 
composting?
 
(1) They help get rid of illness.

 17. In a front-end collision, what absorbs the 
force of the crash?
 
(1) air bags
 
(2) the car’s frame
 
(3) the seats
 
(4) padded dashboards
 
(5) the windshield
 18. Where is the safest place for an infant in a 
car seat in a car equipped with air bags?
 
(1) in the rear seat
 
(2) in the front seat
 
(3) on the right side of the car
 
(4) on the left side of the car
 
(5) where the infant can be tended by an 
adult
Questions 17 and 18 refer to the following passage.
Air Bags
Most new cars are equipped with air bags. In a crash, the air bags quickly deploy, pro-
tecting the driver and front-seat passenger by inflating to absorb the initial force of 
the crash. Air bags deploy so quickly and with such force that they can injure a short 
adult sitting too close to the dashboard or a child in a car seat. This safety device has 
to be treated with respect. With the proper precautions, air bags save lives. In fact, a 
person in the front seat of a modern car equipped with air bags who also wears a seat 
belt stands a much better chance of surviving a crash than an unbelted person. The 
two safety devices work together to save lives but must be used properly.

 21. Scientists thought that the atom was the 
smallest particle that existed, but they 
were wrong. There are smaller particles 
than the atom, and the atom is not itself a 
solid. If people cannot see atoms, how can 
scientists know that there are smaller parti-
cles than atoms?
 
(1) They guess.
 
(2) They experiment.
 
(3) They use powerful magnifying glasses.
 
(4) They use logic.
 
(5) Another scientist told them.
 22. The seat you are sitting on seems solid, but 
in reality, it is composed of atoms. Each of 
the atoms is composed of a nucleus, which 
is composed of neutrons and protons, but 
much of the space occupied by an atom is 
just empty space. This means that the chair 
you are sitting on is mostly empty space. It 
follows that when you stand on the floor of 
a building, you are ultimately being sup-
ported by
 
(1) wood
 
(2) concrete
 
(3) girders
 
(4) atoms
 
(5) chemical reactions
 23. What is it about the lunar landscape that 
may make landing there dangerous?
 
(1) Astronauts have to consider the possi-
bility of hostile aliens.
 
(2) The moon is full of large, uncharted 
spaces with very large boulders.
 
(3) The moon has unlit landing fields with 
uncertain footings.
 
(4) Not all maps of the moon are accurate.
 
(5) Spacecraft has poor brakes for this 
type of terrain.
 24. What aspect of the moon makes the height 
of a boulder unimportant for the astronauts 
moving about?
 
(1) Astronauts have training in flying.
 
(2) There are special tools for flying over 
boulders.
 
(3) Astronauts can drive around an 
obstruction.
 
(4) Low gravity makes climbing easier, if 
it’s necessary.
 
(5) The boulder is not that big.
Questions 23 and 24 refer to the following passage.
The Surface of the Moon
The surface of the moon is a hostile, barren landscape. Astronauts have found boul-
ders as large as houses in huge fields of dust and rock. They’ve had no maps to guide 
them but have survived, thanks to their training for the mission.

 25. When you sink into a tub of water, you 
displace
 
(1) your weight in water
 
(2) a lot of water
 
(3) bubbles
 
(4) a volume equal to the volume of your 
body
 
(5) the soap
 26. If you wanted to find the volume of an irreg-
ularly shaped object, how could you do it?
 
(1) Put the object in a pre-measured 
volume of water and measure the 
increase.
 
(2) Measure the object and calculate the 
volume.
 
(3) Weigh the object and calculate the 
volume.
 
(4) Put the object in an oven and heat it.
 
(5) Look it up.
Questions 25 and 26 refer to the following passage.
Pushing Aside the Water
If you fill a glass right to the brim with water, you have to drink it at its present tem-
perature. If you decide that you want to add ice, the water spills over the brim. The 
ice has displaced an amount of water equal to the volume of the ice.
When you lower yourself into a luxurious bubble bath in your tub, the water rises. If 
you could measure the volume of that rise, you could figure out the volume of your 
body. Because you would displace a volume of water in the tub equal to the volume 
of your body, the new combined volume of you plus the water, minus the original 
volume of the water, equals the volume of your body. Next time you sink slowly into 
that hot bathwater, make sure that you leave room for the water to rise or make sure 
that you are prepared to mop the floor.

 27. If your car becomes stuck in a snow bank, 
what must you do to free it?
 
(1) Apply a force downward to increase 
the traction of the wheels.
 
(2) Leave it at rest until it wants to move.
 
(3) Apply a force in the direction you want 
it to move.
 
(4) Sit on the hood to increase the weight 
on the front tires.
 
(5) Blame Newton.
 28. A company that refuses to change its ideas 
is said to suffer from
 
(1) downturns
 
(2) stability
 
(3) manipulation
 
(4) inertia
 
(5) poor management
 29. When you are driving at a steady speed on 
the highway, why does it take great effort 
to stop suddenly?
 
(1) Cars should have the right of way.
 
(2) It takes too much power to start driving 
again.
 
(3) Pedestrians should stay in parks.
 
(4) Your car tends to continue at the same 
rate.
 
(5) Driving is difficult enough without 
distractions.
Questions 27 through 29 refer to the following passage.
Newton’s First Law of Motion
In 1687, Isaac Newton proposed three laws of motion. These laws are not the types of 
laws that we are familiar with; they are statements of a truth in the field of physics. 
Newton’s First Law of Motion states that a body at rest prefers to remain at rest and a 
body in motion prefers to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. One 
example you may be familiar with is the game of billiards. Each of the balls will 
remain in its position unless hit by the cue ball. Once hit, the ball will continue to roll 
until the friction of the table’s surface or an external force stops it.
Inertia is the tendency of any object to maintain a uniform motion or remain at rest. 
This law has been adopted in current language. When we say that businesses or 
people are being held back because of their inertia, we mean that they will either lan-
guish in their immobility or refuse to change direction in spite of all the input from 
employees and advisors. In 1687 when Newton was formulating his First Law of 
Motion, he was not aware of the profound effect it would have on the world of science 
and common language.

 30. If you want a car that accelerates quickly, 
which attributes give you the best 
acceleration?
 
(1) lightweight and two doors
 
(2) high horsepower and automatic 
transmission
 
(3) automatic transmission
 
(4) automatic transmission and two doors
 
(5) lightweight and high horsepower
Question 30 refers to the following passage.
Newton’s Second Law of Motion
Newton’s Second Law of Motion states that when a body changes its velocity because 
an external force is applied to it, that change in velocity is directly proportional to the 
force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. That is, the faster you want 
to stop your car, the harder you must brake. The brakes apply an external force that 
reduces the velocity of the car. The faster you want to accelerate the car, the more 
force you must apply. Increasing the horsepower of an engine allows it to apply 
greater force in accelerating. That is why drag racer cars seem to be all engine.
 31. A boxer is punching a punching bag. What 
is the punching bag doing to the boxer?
 
(1) bouncing away from the boxer
 
(2) reacting with a force equal and oppo-
site to the force of his punch
 
(3) swinging with a velocity equal to that 
of the punch
 
(4) swinging back with a force greater than 
that of the punch
 
(5) remaining still
Question 31 refers to the following passage.
Newton’s Third Law of Motion
Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that for every action there is an equal and oppo-
site reaction. If you stand on the floor, gravity pulls your body down with a certain 
force. The floor must exert an equal and opposite force upward on your feet, or you 
would fall through the floor.

 32. The most important element in retaining 
the polar bear’s body heat is its
 
(1) paws
 
(2) scalp
 
(3) skin
 
(4) blood
 
(5) hair
 33. What is the polar bear’s solar heat 
collector?
 
(1) caves

(3) its furry coat
 
(4) the snow
 
(5) its skin
 34. If you had to live in the arctic, what sort of 
clothing would be most appropriate?
 
(1) insulated coats
 
(2) silk underwear
 
(3) black clothing with fur covering
 
(4) white clothing with fur covering
 
(5) heavy wool
Questions 32 through 34 refer to the following passage.
Why Don’t Polar Bears Freeze?
Watching a polar bear lumber through the frigid Arctic wilderness, you may wonder 
why it doesn’t freeze. If you were there, you would likely freeze. In fact, you may feel 
cold just looking at photographs of polar bears.
Professor Stephan Steinlechner of Hanover Veterinary University in Germany set out 
to answer the question of why polar bears don’t freeze. Polar bears have black skin. 
This means that, in effect, polar bears have a huge solar heat collector covering their 
body. Covering this black skin are white hollow hairs. These hairs act as insulation, 
keeping the heat inside the fur covering. This is like an insulated house. The heat 
stays in for a long period of time.
This is an interesting theory and does answer the question, except you may still 
wonder how they keep warm at night, when the sun isn’t out!

 35. When methane burns, it produces light, 
heat, carbon dioxide, and water. Why 
would natural gas be a good choice for 
keeping your house warm in winter?
 
(1) The chemical reaction produces 
carbon dioxide.
 
(2) The chemical reaction produces light.
 
(3) The chemical reaction produces water.
 
(4) The chemical reaction uses oxygen.
 
(5) The chemical reaction produces heat.
 36. If firefighters were faced with a methane 
fire, what would they want to eliminate to 
put out the fire?
 
(1) heat
 
(2) light
 
(3) water
 
(4) carbon dioxide

 37. Paternity testing compares the DNA of the 
child with the DNA of the
 
(1) mother
 
(2) father
 
(3) father’s aunt
 
(4) father and grandfather
 
(5) both sides of the family
 38. Why is there no need for maternity testing 
when a child is born?
 
(1) A mother’s DNA is always the same as 
her children’s.
 
(2) Fathers are liable for support.
 
(3) Mothers give birth to their children.
 
(4) It makes a better drama.
 
(5) Fathers may have more than one child.
Questions 37 and 38 refer to the following passage.
Paternity Testing
DNA has become part of everyone’s vocabulary, and several crime shows on televi-
sion use it as a key plot element. DNA has put criminals in jail and freed others. It is 
used as proof in trials and is an important dramatic tool on many television dramas 
and talk shows.
Another use for DNA is not as dramatic. Because a child inherits the DNA of his or her 
parents, DNA testing can prove paternity. This is an example of a practical use for a 
scientific discovery.

 39. What did Gus Grissom plan to do with his 
rolls of dimes?
 
(1) Sell them at auction.
 
(2) Use them in vending machines.
 
(3) Give them to children.
 
(4) Donate them to charity.
 
(5) Keep them as souvenirs.
 40. What happened to John Young’s corned 
beef sandwich?
 
(1) It is in storage.
 
(2) It was sold.
 
(3) It was left on the moon.
 
(4) It was eaten.
 
(5) Not enough information is given.
 41. What is so special about items carried in an 
astronaut’s pocket?
 
(1) Weightlessness changes their 
composition.
 
(2) They have been in space.
 
(3) Lunar radiation affects them.
 
(4) The pockets are made of a special 
material.
 
(5) They are autographed.
 42. What would NASA authorize astronauts to 
carry into space?
 
(1) toys to bring home to their kids
 
(2) a bulletproof vest
 
(3) an extra cup of coffee for the flight
 
(4) government documents
 
(5) tools for experiments
 43. Why would autographed stamps be worth 
so much money?
 
(1) They are rare when personally 
autographed.
 
(2) Stamps always become valuable.
 
(3) People collect autographs.
 
(4) Astronauts don’t give autographs.
 
(5) Auctions always get high prices.
 44. Why would the contents of an astronaut’s 
pocket become so valuable after a space 
flight?
 
(1) NASA told them not to carry things in 
their pockets.
 
(2) Auctions increase the value of articles.
 
(3) Collectors value anything that exists in 
limited quantities.
 
(4) Space travel makes articles magical.
 
(5) The astronauts held out for the highest 
price.
Questions 39 through 44 refer to the following passage.
Space Stuff
Each space flight carries items authorized by NASA, but the quirky little items carried 
in astronauts’ pockets are what catch the interest of collectors. Auction sales have 
been brisk for material carried aboard various space flights.
On the second manned Mercury flight, Gus Grissom carried two rolls of dimes. He 
was planning to give these to the children of his friends after he returned to Earth. If 
you carried two rolls of dimes around Earth, they would be worth ten dollars. When 
Gus Grissom returned to Earth, however, these dimes became space mementos, each 
worth many times its face value.
Although NASA does not permit the sale of items carried aboard space missions, 
many items have found their way to market. Eleven Apollo 16 stamps, autographed by 
the astronauts, sold for $27,000 at auction, but the corned beef sandwich that John 
Young offered to Gus Grissom never returned to Earth.

 45. If the formula for work is Work = Force × 
Distance, how much more work would you 
do in lifting a 10-pound barbell 3 feet 
instead of 2 feet?
 
(1) half as much
 
(2) 3 times as much
 
(3) 1⁄3 as much
 
(4) 11⁄2 times as much
 
(5) 21⁄3 times as much
 46. While you may see that you do work in 
climbing a flight of stairs, why do you also 
do work when you descend a flight of 
stairs?
 
(1) It is hard to climb down stairs.
 
(2) You have traveled a distance down the 
stairs.
 
(3) You feel tired after descending stairs.
 
(4) You have exerted a force over a 
 distance.
 
(5) If you do it at work, it’s work.
Questions 45 and 46 refer to the following passage.
Work
When we think of work, we think of people sitting at desks operating computers or 
building homes or making some other effort to earn money. When a physicist thinks 
of work, she probably thinks of a formula — force exerted over a distance. If you 
don’t expend any energy — resulting in a force of zero — or if your force produces no 
movement, no work has been done. If you pick up your gigantic super-ordinary two-
pound hamburger and lift it to your mouth to take a bite, you do work. If you want to 
resist temptation and just stare at your hamburger, you do no work. If your friend 
gets tired of you playing around and lifts your hamburger to feed you, you still do no 
work, but your friend does. In scientific terms, two elements are necessary for work 
to be done: a force must be exerted and the object to which the force has been 
exerted must move.

The Lead-Acid Storage Battery
One battery you rely on is the 12-volt lead-acid storage battery used in cars and 
trucks. This battery is composed of six separate cells, each developing about 2 volts. 
By connecting the six cells in series, the overall voltage becomes the sum, or 12 volts.
The Dry-Cell Battery
The traditional dry-cell or flashlight battery is a zinc-carbon battery. It derives its 
name from the fact that the liquid portion has been replaced by a moist paste of 
ammonium chloride, manganese dioxide, and carbon. These components are the 
anode portion of the cell, and the zinc container serves as the cathode.

The Cell and Heredity
Each cell in a living organism consists of a membrane surrounding a cytoplasm. The 
cytoplasm is like jelly and has a nucleus in its center. Chromosomes are part of the 
nucleus. They are important because they store DNA. DNA stores the genetic code 
that is the basis of heredity.

Answers and Explanations 
for the Science Test
A
fter taking the Science Test in Chapter 17, use this chapter to check your answers. 
Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers that we provide 
in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed the answers you did. 
You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you answered correctly 
because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought process that helped 
you choose the correct answers.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key.
 
If you have trouble finishing the entire Science Test in Chapter 17 in the allotted time, turn 
to Chapter 16 and read over the answers to the first Science Test (which you can take in 
Chapter 15). Underline the sentence or sentences that tell you the correct answer to each 
question. Mark each passage in the test in Chapter 15 to indicate whether you can skim it or 
you need to read the entire passage to find the answer.
Analysis of the Answers
 
1. 3. The passage describes how the bulb changes to allow the tulip to survive the winter. 
The complete explanation of how the bulb enables the tulip to survive is in the second 
paragraph.
 
2. 3. The passage states that tulips bloom early and grow each year from the bulb.
 
3. 3. All the answer choices except gravity are living substances that are made up of cells. 
Gravity is a force, not a living substance.
 
4. 5. Because the projectile is the only part that leaves the gun, and because movie producers 
and directors don’t want to hurt anyone, the guns are altered so that the projectile does 
no harm. In most cases, there’s no projectile and the gun just makes a noise and a flash — 
nothing comes out of the barrel. The bullet still operates in a similar way with flash and 
noise, but the nonexistent projectile is harmless.
 
5. 4. The force that propels the projectile out of the barrel is the explosion of the gunpowder 
in the jacket. The force of the explosion is determined by the amount of powder in the 
jacket. If there’s less powder in the jacket, there’s less force propelling the projectile out of 
the barrel.
 
6. 2. In space, there’s no oxidizer to take part in the chemical reaction needed for combustion. 
A rocket ship carries its own oxidizer and, thus, can travel through airless space.
 
7. 5. The passage states that “the fuel used may be a liquid or a solid.” This question asks for 
only part of the information given in the passage.

236
Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
 
8. 3. The passage states that with the methodology used for burying solid waste in a modern 
landfill, the bacteria needed for decomposition can’t survive. The reason for using landfills 
is that they require less space — not that they promote decomposition. Thus, the landfill 
and the processes used within it are as much a part of the problem as part of the solution.
 
9. 2. Recycling reduces the need for new landfill sites. In large cities, land is expensive and 
few people want to live next to a landfill site. Even if you remove the garbage by shipping it 
elsewhere, as New York City does, it still has to be dumped somewhere. This information, 
which the passage states, agrees with what you may have read in newspapers and seen on 
television. This passage is an example of a passage where previous knowledge blends in 
with the stated material.
 
 Even though you may feel you know the answer, read the passage quickly to make sure 
because sometimes your prior knowledge conflicts with what’s stated in a passage.
 
10. 4. Solid waste is compacted to reduce the amount of space it occupies, which also 
happens to make the landfill last longer. The waste is compacted in spite of the fact that 
doing so slows down decomposition and lengthens the life of the garbage.
 
11. 2. A modern landfill is compared to garbage lasagna because it’s made up of alternating 
layers of compacted garbage and dirt. This method prevents timely decomposition.
 
12. 5. The passage states that recycling is cheaper than continuing to acquire new landfill 
sites. Choice (2) looks like a possible answer, but it isn’t complete because it doesn’t 
explain why recycling is cheaper. Be sure to read the answers carefully — you don’t want 
to choose an incomplete answer. The other answer choices don’t address the question in 
light of the material presented in the passage.
 
13. 2. As long as you dispose of waste by taking it to the curb or the dump, there will be an 
excess amount of waste being disposed of. Every piece of waste that you can reuse or 
recycle lives on to be useful again and, thus, eliminates some of the waste in America.
 
14. 4. The passage states that bacteria decompose waste. Unfortunately, modern methods of 
waste disposal in landfills reduce the effectiveness of the bacteria.
 
15. 4. Landfill sites are more expensive to acquire than the cost of recycling. In most cities, 
people hope to find new uses for recycled materials, which could increase the value of 
garbage.
 
16. 2. Recycling reduces the amount of space required in landfill sites. These sites are large 
and expensive for any city to buy. Needing fewer landfill sites (or smaller landfill sites) 
would save money.
 
 You may notice a theme developing in these questions — something you may see as a 
pattern of answers. Be wary of looking for themes or patterns when answering questions 
on this test. If you think you’ve found one, be cautious because the theme or pattern may 
exist only in your head.
 
17. 1. The purpose of the airbag, according to the passage, is to absorb some of the forces in a 
front-end crash. Choice (2) is incorrect because the passage doesn’t mention anything 
about the car’s frame as part of the energy-absorbing mechanism. Choices (3) and (5) 
would do little in the way of absorbing force in a crash. Padded dashboards provide 
minimal protection, but they’re not as good as airbags.
 
 One or more answer choices to a question may be correct according to your memory, but 
if the passage doesn’t mention them, don’t choose them. A correct answer in a multiple-
choice question is either mentioned or suggested in the passage.
 
18. 1. An infant is safest in the rear seat because, when deployed, the air bag is powerful 
enough to injure a small person (according to the third sentence of the first paragraph). 
The other four answer choices seem reasonable, but they’re incorrect because the 
passage doesn’t mention them.

237
 Chapter 18: Answers and Explanations for the Science Test
 
19. 4. The diagram (going from bottom to top) indicates the process of building up a molecule. 
The quark is the smallest particle, and the molecule is the largest. Sometimes you have to 
read a diagram in an unfamiliar way to answer the question.
 
20. 4. According to the diagram, a quark is 10–18 m across and a molecule is 10–9 across. The 
molecule would be 10–9 ÷ 10–18 = 1 ÷ 10–9 or 1,000,000,000 times the size of a quark.
 
 A number with a negative exponent, like 10–9, equals 1 ÷ 10 to the positive power of the 
negative exponent (for example, 10–9 = 1 ÷ 109).
 
21. 2. Scientists often develop experiments to test theories about items that are invisible to 
the naked eye. Curiosity drives scientists to try to find answers; experimentation proves 
that smaller particles than atoms exist. The other answers don’t directly answer the 
question.
 
22. 4. The passage states that everything is composed of atoms. As a result, the floor must be 
composed of atoms. Choices (1) and (2) are building materials and are themselves made of 
atoms. Choice (3) is a fabricated part of a building and is made of atoms, and Choice (5) 
doesn’t even come close to answering the question.
 
23. 2. Landing a spaceship on large boulders is impossible, and the lack of charts makes 
accidentally meeting a boulder a possibility. A boulder as big as a house could do major 
damage to a spaceship. The passage states that there are such large boulders on the sur-
face of the moon and that there are few accurate charts of the surface.
 
24. 4. The moon has less gravity than Earth. Climbing requires lifting your weight against the 
force of gravity. It’s easier to climb on the moon. With greatly reduced gravity, astronauts 
can jump fairly high. Whether or not they could jump over a house-sized boulder remains 
to be seen.
 
25. 4. The passage tells you that you would displace a volume equal to your own volume. 
Choice (1) looks like it may be correct, but the passage is about volume, not weight.
 
26. 1. The object would displace a volume of water equal to its volume. Thus, putting an 
object in a pre-measured volume of water is one way to measure the volume of an irregu-
larly shaped object.
 
27. 3. According to Newton, a force must be applied to move an object at rest. Newton, who 
never drove a car, said that you have to apply an external force on the object at rest (the 
car in this question) in the direction you want it to move. If you want your car to move 
deeper into the snow, you push it down. If you have a crane or a helicopter, which the 
passage doesn’t mention, you apply a force upward to lift it out of the snow. Choice (3) is 
the best answer.
 
28. 4. You find the answer to this question in the second paragraph of the passage.
 
29. 4. When driving at a uniform rate of speed, the car resists changes in speed. The car wants 
to continue to travel at the same speed. To change that speed suddenly, you must apply 
great effort to your brakes.
 
30. 5. Newton’s Second Law of Motion states that when a body changes its velocity because an 
external force is applied to it, that change in velocity is directly proportional to the force 
and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. If you decrease the weight of the body 
and increase the size of the external force, the acceleration increases.
 
31. 2. Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that for every action there’s an equal and opposite 
reaction. If the boxer is exerting a force on the punching bag, the bag is exerting an equal 
and opposite force on the boxer.
 
32. 5. The passage states that the hair acts as insulation, retaining the polar bear’s body heat.
 
33. 5. The passage states that the polar bear’s dark skin collects heat from the sun.

238
Part IV: Peering at Your Specimen: The Science Test 
 
 
34. 3. If you were in the Arctic, you’d want to duplicate the experience of the polar bear. Black 
clothing with a fur covering is the best answer.
 
35. 5. In cold weather, you need a source of heat to warm your house, and methane produces 
heat in the chemical reaction. The other answers are incorrect.
 
36. 5. Methane requires oxygen to produce light and heat. If there’s no oxygen, the methane 
can’t burn.
 
37. 2. Paternity refers to the male half of a couple. If mothers were tested, it would be called 
maternity testing.
 
38. 3. No one ever has any doubt on the day of the birth about who gave birth to a child. The 
mother is always obvious on that day. If the child were separated from the mother after 
birth, maternity testing could be an issue. But the question specifically asks about the day 
the baby is born.
 
39. 3. According to the passage, Gus Grissom planned to give the dimes to the children of his 
friends.
 
40. 5. The passage tells you that the sandwich wasn’t returned to Earth, but nothing more. 
The passage doesn’t tell you what happened to it. Any of the other answer choices besides 
Choice (5) are speculation. On these tests, you need to stick to the information you’re 
given.
 
41. 2. Because being in space is a rare occurrence, anything that has been there takes on a 
certain importance. Collectors want objects that are rare and about to get rarer.
 
42. 5. The purpose of space flights is scientific research, so you’re looking for an item associated 
with carrying out experiments or performing the daily routines of space travel. None of the 
other choices fills the bill.
 
43. 1. Anything autographed by a famous person is valuable. When the object autographed is 
also available in limited quantities, it becomes more valuable still.
 
44. 3. Collectors like to collect unique things. Few items are as unique as something that has 
flown in space.
 
45. 4. Because the force remains constant, the work done is proportional to the distance 
traveled, which means you would do 3 ÷ 2 or 11⁄2 times as much work.
 
46. 4. Walking down the stairs, you have to exert a force against the force of gravity for a 
distance (the definition of work in physics). In real life, it seems easier to walk down a 
flight of stairs than walk up it, but, in both cases, work is being done.
 
47. 1. If you want a 48-volt lead-acid battery, and each cell produces 2 volts, you need 24 cells 
(48 ÷ 2 = 24).
 
48. 1. The moist paste replaces the acid in the battery.
 
49. 5. DNA stores the genetic code, which determines heredity, and you get your DNA from 
your parents.
 
50. 5. DNA in the chromosome stores the genetic code, which determines heredity. Yes, 
this answer is the same answer as Question 49, but the question is different. Read the 
questions carefully, and don’t spend your time looking for patterns or tricks.

n a nutshell, the Language Arts, Reading Test determines how well you read and 
understand what you’ve read. Sounds simple enough, right? If you’re looking for a few 
more details about the types of passages and questions that appear on this test, you’ve 
come to the right place. This chapter covers those topics and many more.
 
To do well on this test, you have to be in the practice of reading different types of material 
and comprehending what you read. If you’re not a big fan of reading, start with something 
simple, like a daily newspaper or a weekly news magazine. Every day, switch off the TV for 
an hour and read something instead. Gradually advance to how-to books (like this one) and 
short stories from an anthology (a fancy name for a collection of short stories or poems). 
Eventually, begin reading novels, longer poems, and plays.
Looking at the Skills the Language Arts, 
Reading Test Covers
You may not understand why the GED wants to test your knowledge of literature 
comprehension. However, in today’s society, being able to comprehend, analyze, and 
apply something you’ve read is an important skill set to have. The questions on the 
Language Arts, Reading Test focus on the following skills (which you’re expected to be able 
to use as you read passages of prose, poetry, and plays):
 
✓ Comprehension (20 percent): Questions that test your comprehension skills assess your 
ability to read a source of information, understand what you’ve read, and restate the infor-
mation in your own words. If you understand the passage, you can rephrase what you read 
without losing the meaning of the passage. You can also create a summary of the main 
ideas presented in the passage and explain the ideas and implications of the passage.
 
✓ Application (15 percent): Questions that test your application skills assess your ability 
to use the information you read in the passage in a new situation, such as when you’re 

244
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
answering questions. Application-focused questions are most like real life because they 
often ask you to apply what you read in the passage to a real-life situation. Being able 
to read a users’ manual and then use the product it came with is a perfect example of 
using your application skills in real life.
 
✓ Analysis (30 to 35 percent): Questions that test your analysis skills assess your ability 
to draw conclusions, understand consequences, and make inferences after reading the 
passage. To answer these questions successfully, you have to make sure your conclusions 
are based on the written text in the passage and not on your background knowledge or 
the book you read last week. Questions that focus on your ability to analyze what you 
read try to find out whether you appreciate the way the passage was written and see 
the cause-and-effect relationships within it. They also expect you to know when a 
conclusion is being stated and analyze what it means in the context of the passage.
 
✓ Synthesis (30 to 35 percent): Questions that test your synthesis skills assess your abil-
ity to take information in one form and in one location and put it together in another 
context. Here you get a chance to make connections between different parts of the 
passage and compare and contrast them. You may be asked to talk about the tone, 
point of view, style, or purpose of a passage — and saying the purpose of a passage is 
to confuse and confound test takers isn’t the answer.
 
Some questions on this test may ask you to use information in the passages combined with 
information from the text of the questions to answer them. So make sure you read everything 
written in the test booklet — you never know where an answer may come from.
Understanding the Test Format
The Language Arts, Reading Test measures your ability to understand and interpret prose 
and poetry passages. It’s plain and simple — no tricks involved. You don’t have to do any 
math to figure out the answers to the questions. You just have to read, understand, and 
use the material presented to you to answer the corresponding questions. The passages in 
this test are similar to the works a high school student would come across in English class, 
and they’re taken from two specific sources: literary text and nonfiction text (we discuss 
both areas in further detail in the next section).
To help you feel more comfortable with taking the Language Arts, Reading Test, we’re here 
to give you a better idea of what this test looks like on paper. It consists of 40 multiple-
choice questions and a number of textual passages to go with them. You have 65 minutes to 
complete the test, which means you have a little over 11⁄2 minutes to complete each question 
(and read the passage that goes with it).
Before each passage in the test is a question in bold — called a purpose question. Keep in 
mind that you don’t have to answer the purpose question; its sole job is to help you focus on 
what’s important in the passage that follows it. The purpose question suggests the purpose 
for reading the passage and can give you hints about what the questions that follow will ask.
A passage of 200 to 400 words or a poem of 8 to 25 lines follows each purpose question. The 
passages in this test may come from workplace (on-the-job) materials or from academic 
reading materials. Thirty of the questions (or 75 percent of them) are based on literary texts 
(including plays, poetry, short stories, novels, and so on), and the other ten questions (or 
25 percent) are based on nonfiction texts (including biographies, reviews, memos, directions, 
and so on). After each passage, you have to answer four to eight multiple-choice questions.
 
Passages are passages. Although the next section describes what types of passages appear 
on the Language Arts, Reading Test to help you prepare, don’t worry so much about what 
type of passage you’re reading. Instead, spend your time understanding what information 
the passage presents to you.

Identifying the Types of Questions and 
Knowing How to Prepare for Them
To help you get comfortable with answering the questions on the Language Arts, Reading 
Test, you probably want to have a good idea of what these types of questions look like. The 
good news is that we focus on the two main types of questions in this section. We also give 
you some practical advice you can use as you prepare to take this test.
 
The simplest advice we can give to someone about to take this test is to read. In the previous 
sections of this chapter, we outline what’s being tested and give you an idea of how much of 
the test focuses on each type of passage. Now comes the part you have to do yourself — the 
reading. Read everything you can and decide what kind of reading you’re doing. Ask your-
self questions about everything you read — even if that means asking yourself questions 
about the sides of cereal boxes. Read instruction manuals for products you own — you 
may surprise yourself by learning something new about some of your more complicated 
electronic possessions.
Literary passages
The Language Arts, Reading Test includes at least one passage from each of the following 
literary texts (and plenty of questions to go with them):
 
✓ Drama: Drama (that is, a play) tells a story using the words and actions of the 
characters. The description of the place and costumes are in the stage directions or in 
the head of the director. As you read passages from drama, try to imagine the dramatic 
scene and see the characters and their actions in your head. Doing so makes drama 
easier to understand.
 
 Stage directions are usually printed in italics, like this. Even though you’re not an actor 
in the play, pay attention to the stage directions. They may provide you with valuable 
information you need to answer the questions that follow the passage.
 
✓ Poetry: Poetry is the concentrated juice of literature, meaning that the ideas and 
emotions are closely packed and aren’t always visible during your first reading. Read 
poetry slowly and carefully. If you take your time, poetry can make sense and be quite 
beautiful. As a matter of fact, popular music is often written as poetry. (Leonard Cohen 
is a wonderful example of a poet who can and does sing his poems.) We know you 
aren’t taking this test as entertainment, but try to enjoy the poetry as much as you can.
 
 As you prepare for this test, read a lot of poetry — even if you hate it. Some poetry is 
beautiful and moving, and, if you read enough, you’re sure to find at least one piece 
that you come to enjoy. After you read a poem, decide what the poet is saying and how 
he or she is saying it. Why does the poet use certain words? What images are in the 
poem? Taking the time to practice asking these types of questions after reading poetry 
can really prepare you for the poetry portion of this test.
 
✓ Prose fiction: Prose fiction refers to novels and short stories. As you may already know, 
fiction is writing that comes straight from the mind of the author (in other words, it’s 
made up; it’s not about something that really happened). The only way to become 
familiar with prose fiction is to read as much fiction as you can. After you read a book, 
try to talk about it with other people who have read the book.
 
 This test includes prose fiction written during the following three time periods (look in 
the library for books written during these periods to get some ideas of what to read):

246
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
 
• Before 1920
 
• Between 1920 and 1960
 
• After 1960
 
 The difference between the time periods is usually evident in the words used and the 
situations described, but when the prose was written isn’t the most important part of 
the passages. Spend your time reading and understanding the main ideas in the passages, 
and don’t worry too much about when they were written. Just try to recognize that 
some passages are newer and some are older.
Nonfiction passages
As far as the nonfiction text on this test is concerned, you may have to read passages from 
any of the following sources (and answer questions about them, too, of course):
 
✓ Critical reviews of visual and performing arts: These prose passages are reviews 
written by people who have enough knowledge of the visual or performing arts to be 
critical of them. You can find examples of good critical reviews in the library, in some 
daily papers, and on the Internet. Enter critical review into your favorite search engine, 
and you’ll get more critical reviews than you have time to read.
 
 To prepare for this part of the test, try to read critical reviews of books, movies, 
restaurants, and the like as often as you can. The next time you go to a movie, watch 
television, or go to a play, write your own critical review (what you thought of the 
piece of work). Put some factual material into your review, and make suggestions for 
improvement. Compare what the real critics have to say with your own feelings about 
the movie, television show, or play. Do you agree with their opinions?
 
✓ Nonfiction prose: Nonfiction prose is prose that covers a lot of ground — and all the 
ground is real. Nonfiction prose is material that the author doesn’t create in his or her 
own mind — it’s based on fact or reality. In fact, this book is classified as nonfiction 
prose, and so are the newspaper articles you read every day. The next time you read 
the newspaper or a magazine, tell yourself, “I’m reading nonfiction prose.” Just don’t 
say it out loud in a coffee shop or in your break room at work — or people may start to 
look at you in strange ways.
 
✓ Workplace and community documents: You run across these types of passages in the 
job- and community-related areas of life. The following are some examples:
 
• Mission statements: Organizations and companies often write mission statements 
to tell the world what the company’s role is in the community. You may have 
your own mission statement: “I live to party” or “I hate reading,” for example. Of 
course, you may have to change it if you want to pass this test.
 
• Goal (or vision) statements: Companies and organizations may also have goal 
statements, which tell the world what they intend to accomplish. The goal statement 
for your study group may be as follows: “We’re all going to pass the GED tests on 
our first attempt.”
 
• Rules for employee behavior: Every company, school, or organized group has 
rules for behavior. Some are written down, while others are unspoken but 
understood. Some of the passages on this test come from real or imaginary rules 
of behavior. You probably already know how to read them.
 
• Legal documents: Legal documents are drafted by lawyers and may include 
leases, purchase contracts, and bank statements. If you aren’t familiar with legal 
documents, collect some examples from banks or libraries and review them. If 
you can explain these types of documents to a friend, you understand them.

247
 Chapter 19: Reading between the Lines: Encountering the Language Arts, Reading Test
 
• Letters: You certainly know what a letter is: a written communication between 
two people. It’s not very often that you get to read other people’s letters without 
getting into trouble — here’s your chance.
 
✓ Manuals: Every time you invest in a major purchase, you get a users’ manual that tells 
you how to use the item. Some manuals are short and straightforward; others are long 
and complicated. It took me so long to read the manual that came with my new camera 
that I thought my hobby was reading manuals, not taking pictures.
Examining Preparation Strategies That Work
Now that you know what to read to prepare for this test, you need to focus on how to read. 
You can’t easily skim the type of poetry and prose that appears on the test. You need to 
read each question and passage carefully to find the right answer.
Keep the following reading tactics in mind as you prepare for the test:
 
✓ Read. Read whatever you have available, but also look for the specific types of texts that 
we discuss in the preceding sections. Become a reading addict. Read labels, cereal 
boxes, novels, magazines, poems, plays, short stories, and newspapers. Read everything 
and anything. And don’t stop with just reading — also digest and think about everything 
you read, just as you’re asked to do on this test. When you read, read carefully. If reading 
poetry and drama is unfamiliar to you, read them even more carefully. The more care-
fully you read any material, the easier it’ll be for you to get the right answers on the test.
 
✓ Ask questions. Ask yourself questions about what you’ve read. Do you understand the 
main ideas well enough to explain them to a stranger? (Note that we don’t advise going 
up to strangers to explain things to them in person. Pretend you’re going to explain it 
to a stranger and do all the talking in your head. If you want to explain what you read 
to someone in person, ask your friends and family to lend you an ear — or two.)
 
 Ask for help if you don’t understand something you read. You may want to form a 
study group and work with other people. If you’re taking a test-preparation course, ask 
the instructor for help when you need it. If you have family, friends, or co-workers who 
can help, ask them.
 
✓ Use a dictionary. Not many people understand every word they read, so use a 
dictionary. Looking up unfamiliar words increases your vocabulary, which, in turn, 
makes passages on the Language Arts, Reading Test easier to understand. If you have 
a Thesaurus, use it, too. Often knowing a synonym for the word you don’t know is 
 helpful. Plus, it improves your Scrabble game.
 
✓ Use new words. A new word doesn’t usually become part of your vocabulary until you 
put it to use in your everyday language. When you come across a new word, make sure you 
know its meaning and try to use it in a sentence. Then try to work it into conversation for a 
day or two. After a while, this challenge can make each day more exciting.
 
✓ Practice. Practice taking the Language Arts, Reading Tests in Chapters 20 and 22. Do 
the questions, and check your answers. Look at the explanations of the answers that 
we provide in Chapters 21 and 23. Don’t move on to the next answer until you understand 
the preceding one. If you want more sample tests, look for additional test-prep books 
at your bookstore or local library. You can also find some abbreviated tests on the 
Internet. Enter GED test questions or GED test questions + free into your favorite search 
engine, and check out some of the results.
 
 Take as many practice tests as you can. Stick to the time limits, and keep the testing 
situation as realistic as possible. When you go to the test center for the official test, 
you will feel more at ease because you practiced.

248
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
 
This test doesn’t test you on anything but reading. All the information you need to answer 
the questions is given in the passages or in the text of the questions that accompany the 
passages. You’re not expected to recognize the passage and answer questions about what 
comes before it or what comes after it in context of the entire work. The passages are 
complete in themselves, so just focus on what you read.
 Many people get hung up on the poetry and drama passages. Don’t stress. Keep in mind 
that these literary genres are just different ways of telling a story and conveying feelings. If 
you’re not familiar with them, read poems and plays before taking this test. Discuss what 
you have read with others; you may even want to consider joining (or starting) a book club 
that discusses poems and/or plays.
Managing Your Time for the Language Arts, 
Reading Test
As we mention earlier in this chapter, the Language Arts, Reading Test consists of 40 questions 
that you have to answer in 65 minutes, which averages out to just over 11⁄2 minutes per ques-
tion. When you begin the test, the best way to manage your time is to answer the easiest 
questions first. Then move to the more difficult questions and spend a little more time on 
those questions.
 
Throughout the test, keep track of the time. You don’t want to run out of time before you 
finish answering all the questions. Arrange your time to leave a little extra time for the sec-
tions you have the most difficulty with. If you have difficulty with poetry, leave a bit of extra 
time for poetry-based questions, and use less time for the prose sections. Keep in mind, 
however, that this test is a timed test, so you can’t spend limitless time on any one ques-
tion. If you do, you won’t have time to finish — and finishing is definitely important. Check 
out Chapters 2 and 3 for some general time-management tips.
Practicing with Sample Problems
The following passage and sample problems give you some idea of what the Language Arts, 
Reading Test questions look like.
Choose the one best answer to each question. Questions 1 through 5 refer to the following 
passage.
DOES EMPLOYMENT NEED A NEW FACE?
Facilities for Access to Creative Enterprise (FACE)
Originally founded in 1982 to train unemployed youth in small “hand skill” craft workshops, 
this project provides occupational and entrepreneurial skills as an alternative to traditional 
manufacturing jobs. Beginning with glass engraving and sign writing, FACE now offers train-
ing in more than 200 hand skill occupations, including antique restoration, clothing manu-
facturing, graphic design, masonry, sail making, specialist joinery, weaving, and wood 
turning. Funded through the Youth Training Scheme, FACE provides 800 training places in 
the west and northeast of England under the premise that even if the young people can’t 
secure employment, they at least will have the skills to create their own businesses.

249
 Chapter 19: Reading between the Lines: Encountering the Language Arts, Reading Test
Based on its experience, FACE has developed, with the Royal Society of Arts, a Certificate in 
Small Business and Enterprise Skills. The aim of the certificate is “to develop the basic skills 
of enterprise across a range of occupational sectors, within small business and in general 
employment and which are applicable in a wide range of personal and social contexts 
outside work.” Competencies include self-evaluation, decision making, initiative taking, 
resource and time management, opportunism and self-motivation, problem solving, and 
learning-to-learn skills, as well as communication and number skills vital to personal 
effectiveness.
 
1. What is the overall purpose of the FACE project?
 
(1) to provide manufacturing jobs
 
(2) to engrave glass
 
(3) to train unemployed youth
 
(4) to write signs
 
(5) to restore antiques
The correct answer is Choice (3). The overall purpose of the FACE project is to train 
unemployed youth. Glass engraving, sign writing, and antique restoring are just some of 
the skills the youth may develop through FACE. Manufacturing jobs are in short supply, 
resulting in the need for entrepreneurial skills.
 
2. Which of the following is not an example of a hand skill craft occupation?
 
(1) weaving
 
(2) wood turning
 
(3) sail making
 
(4) specialist joinery
 
(5) robotic assembly
The correct answer is Choice (5). Robotic assembly is a high-tech computer-assisted 
approach to manufacturing that seeks to replace workers with robots. The other answers — 
weaving, wood turning, sail making, and joinery (carpentry) — are all examples of hand skill 
craft occupations according to the passage.
 
3. How can young people best secure employment northeast of England?
 
(1) by engaging in traditional manufacturing
 
(2) by creating new enterprises
 
(3) by joining the Royal Society of Arts
 
(4) by obtaining a Certificate in Small Business
 
(5) by going to one of 800 training places
The correct answer is Choice (2). The best way for youth to secure employment is 
to “create new enterprises,” as the passage states. Jobs are being lost in traditional 
manufacturing. The Royal Society, business certificate, and training places don’t refer 
directly to securing employment.

250
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
 
4. Who helped FACE develop the Certificate in Small Business and Enterprise Skills?
 
(1) Youth Training Scheme
 
(2) west and northeast England
 
(3) hand skill workshops
 
(4) Royal Society of Arts
 
(5) occupational sectors
The correct answer is Choice (4). The Royal Society of Arts assisted FACE in developing 
the Certificate in Small Business and Enterprise Skills. The Youth Training Scheme, while 
providing funding for FACE, wasn’t directly involved with the Certificate. Hand skill workshops 
and occupational sectors have no direct relation to the Certificate. Choice (2) — west and 
northeast England — refers only to locations.
 
5. Which competency is not included in training for the Certificate?
 
(1) self-evaluation
 
(2) anger management
 
(3) decision making
 
(4) problem solving
 
(5) number skills
The correct answer is Choice (2). Anger management isn’t mentioned in the passage as one 
of the competencies; all the other skills are.
Revealing Some Helpful Pointers
This chapter includes several tips to help you achieve greatness on this test. This section 
hits on a few other general pointers that can help give you the edge you’re looking for. As 
you work your way through the Language Arts, Reading Test, keep the following pointers 
in mind:
 
✓ Look at the purpose question. Before every passage is a purpose question (see the 
“Understanding the Test Format” section for details). Be sure to read it. You don’t have 
to answer it, but it gives you a direction for reading the passage. Take any clues that 
you can get.
 
✓ Ferret out the meaning of new words from the surrounding text. Even the best 
readers sometimes come to a word they don’t recognize or understand. Luckily, the 
sentences around a new word can give you clues to the meaning of the word. Ask 
yourself, “What word would make sense in place of the one I don’t know?”
 
✓ Recognize that everything’s important. In this test, information may be hiding in many 
places. It may be in explanatory notes set off in square brackets [like this]. It may be 
hiding in stage directions, usually printed in italics, like this. It may be hidden in the 
speaker’s name before the dialogue. Read everything and skip nothing.
 
✓ Develop your reading speed. Reading is wonderful, but reading quickly is even 
better — it gets you through the test with time to spare. Check out Speed Reading For 
Dummies by Richard Sutz with Peter Weverka (Wiley), or do a quick Internet search to 
find plenty of material that can help you read faster. Whatever method you use, try to 
improve your reading rate without hurting your overall reading comprehension.

Directions: Choose the one best answer to each question.
Questions 1 through 6 refer to the following poem, “Concord Hymn,” by Ralph Waldo Emerson 
(1886).
WHAT WAS “THE SHOT HEARD ’ROUND THE WORLD”?
By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood,
And fired the shot heard round the world.
The foe long since in silence slept;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set today a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare
The shaft we raise to them and thee.

WHERE DOES EVIL COME FROM?
DWIGHT: (sitting at table, reading newspaper) Morning.
DAD: You see your brother this morning?
DWIGHT: In bed.
DAD: I promised Harry Shepherd I’d be over to his place by seven-thirty. He’s got a 
lost sheep out on the mountain wild and steep.
DWIGHT: Says here that fatted calves are down one and three-quarter shekels on the 
Damascus market, Dad. Makes me wonder if maybe lean calves wouldn’t have a 
higher profit margin, and then we could spend more time in the vineyard — Dad, are 
you listening to me?
DAD: I’m worried about your brother.
DWIGHT: We can’t afford to stand still, Dad. Look at the Stewarts — they’re buying 
up land left and right! You’ve got to move ahead or you lose ground . . . .
WALLY: (thickly) Morning, Dad. Morning, Dwight. (He sits down, groans, puts his head 
in his hands.)
DAD: You look a little peaked, son.
WALLY: I donno — it’s some kind of morning sickness, Dad. I feel real good at night 
and then I wake up and hurt all over.
DWIGHT: I noticed a couple empty wineskins behind the fig tree this morning.
WALLY: I dropped them, and they spilled! Honest!
DAD: Where were you taking them?
WALLY: I was putting them outside! Wine’s got to breathe, you know. And so do I, 
Dad. I’ve got a real breathing problem here. I’m worried about my health, Dad. I read 
an article the other day in Assyrian Digest that says bad feelings may be environmen-
tal. I donno. Maybe I need to get away for a while, Dad. Get my head straight. Work 
out some things.

Questions 13 through 18 refer to the following excerpt from Jack London’s “In a Far Country” 
(1899).
HOW CAN I MAKE MY FORTUNE?
When the world rang with the tale of Arctic gold, and the lure of the North gripped the 
heartstrings of men, Carter Weatherbee threw up his snug clerkship, turned the half of his 
savings over to his wife, and with the remainder bought an outfit. There was no romance 
in his nature — the bondage of commerce had crushed all that; he was simply tired of the 
ceaseless grind, and wished to risk great hazards in view of corresponding returns . . . and 
there, unluckily for his soul’s welfare, he allied himself with a party of men.
There was nothing unusual about this party, except its plans. Even its goal, like that 
of all the other parties, was the Klondike. But the route it had mapped out to attain 
that goal took away the breath of the hardiest native, born and bred to the vicissi-
tudes of the Northwest. Even Jacques Baptiste, born of a Chippewa woman and a ren-
egade voyageur (having raised his first whimpers in a deerskin lodge north of the 
sixty-fifth parallel, and had the same hushed by blissful sucks of raw tallow), was sur-
prised. Though he sold his services to them and agreed to travel even to the never-
opening ice, he shook his head ominously whenever his advice was asked.
Percy Cuthfert’s evil star must have been in the ascendant, for he, too, joined this 
company of Argonauts. He was an ordinary man, with a bank account as deep as 
his culture, which is saying a good deal. He had no reason to embark on such a 
venture — no reason in the world, save that he suffered from an abnormal develop-
ment of sentimentality. He mistook this for the true spirit of romance and adventure.

Questions 19 through 24 refer to the following excerpt from James Baldwin’s “Sonny’s Blues” 
(1957).
WHY DOES SONNY FEEL SORRY?
DEAR BROTHER,
You don’t know how much I needed to hear from you. I wanted to write you many a 
time but I dug how much I must have hurt you and so I didn’t write. But now I feel like 
a man who’s been trying to climb up out of some deep, real deep and funky hole and 
just saw the sun up there, outside. I got to get outside.
I can’t tell you much about how I got here. I mean I don’t know how to tell you. I guess 
I was afraid of something or I was trying to escape from something and you know I 
have never been very strong in the head (smile). I’m glad Mama and Daddy are dead 
and can’t see what’s happened to their son and I swear if I’d known what I was doing I 
would never have hurt you so, you and a lot of other fine people who were nice to me 
and who believed in me.
I don’t want you to think it had anything to do with me being a musician. It’s more 
than that. Or maybe less than that. I can’t get anything straight in my head down here 
and I try not to think about what’s going to happen to me when I get outside again. 
Sometime I think I’m going to flip and never get outside and sometime I think I’ll come 
straight back. I tell you one thing, though, I’d rather blow my brains out than go 
through this again. But that’s what they all say, so they tell me.
Your brother,
SONNY

Questions 25 through 30 refer to the following excerpt from Tim O’Brien’s The Things They 
Carried (1990).
WHAT WERE THE THINGS THEY CARRIED?
First Lieutenant Jimmy Cross carried letters from a girl named Martha, a junior at 
Mount Sebastian College in New Jersey. They were not love letters, but Lieutenant 
Cross was hoping, so he kept them folded in plastic at the bottom of his rucksack. In 
the late afternoon, after a day’s march, he would dig his foxhole, wash his hands 
under a canteen, unwrap the letters, hold them with the tips of his fingers, and spend 
the last hour of light pretending. He would imagine romantic camping trips into the 
White Mountains in New Hampshire. He would sometimes taste the envelope flaps, 
knowing her tongue had been there. More than anything, he wanted Martha to love 
him as he loved her, but the letters were mostly chatty, elusive on the matter of love. 
She was a virgin, he was almost sure. She was an English major at Mount Sebastian, 
and she wrote beautifully about her professors and roommates and midterm exams, 
about her respect for Chaucer and her great affection for Virginia Woolf. She often 
quoted lines of poetry; she never mentioned the war, except to say, Jimmy, take care 
of yourself. The letters weighed 10 ounces. They were signed Love, Martha, but 
Lieutenant Cross understood that Love was only a way of signing and did not mean 
what he sometimes pretended it meant. At dusk, he would carefully return the letters 
to his rucksack. Slowly, a bit distracted, he would get up and move among his men, 
checking the perimeter, then at full dark he would return to his hole and watch the 
night and wonder if Martha was a virgin.

Questions 31 through 35 refer to the following excerpt, written by Dale Shuttleworth (originally 
printed in the Toronto Star, January 2008).
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISE MOVEMENT?
The Center for Social Innovation, a renovated warehouse in the Spadina Ave. area of 
Toronto houses 85 “social enterprises,” including organizations concerned with the 
environment, the arts, social justice, education, health, technology and design. 
Tribute has been paid to the “social enterprise movement” in Quebec and Vancouver 
for providing the impetus for this very successful venture.
Toronto, Ontario also has provided leadership in the areas of community education 
and community economic development — essential components in the creation of 
social enterprises. In 1974, the Toronto Board of Education assisted in the establish-
ment of the Learnxs Foundation Inc. as part of its Learning Exchange System.
The foundation represented an additional source of support for the burgeoning “alter-
natives in education” movement. In 1973, the Ontario government had imposed ceil-
ings on educational spending and together with reduced revenue due to declining 
enrolment the Toronto board had limited means to fund innovative and experimental 
programs. The Learnxs Foundation was an independent “arms-length” non-profit 
charitable enterprise, which could solicit funds from public and private sources and 
generate revenue through the sale of goods and services to support innovative pro-
grams within the Toronto system.
What followed during the 1970s was a series of Learnxs-sponsored demonstration 
projects as a source of research and development in such areas as: school and com-
munity programs to improve inner-city education; a series of small enterprises to 
employ 14- to 15-year-old school leavers; Youth Ventures — a paper recycling enter-
prise employing at-risk youth; Artsjunction — discarded material from business and 
industry were recycled for use as craft materials for visual arts classes; Toronto 
Urban Studies Centre — a facility to encourage the use of the city as a learning envi-
ronment; and Learnxs Press — a publishing house for the production and sale of 
innovative learning materials.
The York Board of Education and its school and community organizations jointly 
incorporated the Learning Enrichment Foundation (LEF), modeled on Learnxs. 
Originally devoted to multicultural arts enrichment, LEF during the 1980s joined with 
parental groups and the school board to establish 13 school-based childcare centers 
for infants, pre-school and school-age children.
In 1984, LEF was asked by Employment and Immigrant Canada to convene a local 
committee of adjustment in response to York’s high rate of unemployment and plant 
closures. Outcomes of the work of the Committee included:
York Business Opportunities Centre: In 1985, with support from the Ontario Ministry 
of Industry, Trade & Technology, LEF opened the first small business incubator oper-
ated by a non-profit charitable organization. 
Microtron Centre: This training facility was devoted to micro-computer skills, word 
and numerical processing, computer-assisted design, graphics and styling, and elec-
tronic assembly and repair.

Microtron Bus: This refurbished school bus incorporated eight workstations from the 
Microtron Centre. It visited small business, industry and service organizations on a 
scheduled basis to provide training in word and numerical processing for their 
employees and clients.
In 1996, the Training Renewal Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit charity to 
serve disadvantaged youth and other displaced workers seeking skills, qualifications 
and employment opportunities. Over the years TRF has partnered with governments, 
employers and community organizations to provide a variety of services including 
job-creation programs for: immigrants and refugees, GED high school equivalency, 
café equipment technicians, coffee and vending service workers, industrial warehous-
ing and lift truck operators, fully expelled students, youth parenting, construction 
craft workers and garment manufacturing.

Answers and Explanations for the 
Language Arts, Reading Test
A
fter taking the Language Arts, Reading Test in Chapter 20, use this chapter to check 
your answers. Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers 
that we provide in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed the 
answers you did. You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you 
answered correctly because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought 
process that helped you choose the correct answers.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key.
Analysis of the Answers
 
1. 1. They stood by the “rude bridge” (or rough-structured span) to make their stand. Although 
a flag and an arch are mentioned in the poem, they aren’t the best answers. Neither the 
flood (meaning the river) nor the April breeze is a plausible answer.
 
2. 4. The farmers were ready for war. The fact that they were “embattled” (another word for 
fighting) and firing shots shows this. They definitely weren’t having negotiations (instead, 
they seem resolute) or taking a vacation, nor were they retreating or celebrating.
 
3. 2. They’ve all since died (sleeping silently). They haven’t just gone away because they won 
or lost the war, nor are they living together peacefully.
 
4. 5. The bridge has fallen into ruins. The other answers are incorrect: The bridge did exist 
(obviously), and it wasn’t rebuilt after the battle (as indicated by the fact that it’s no 
longer there), and it was swept away.
 
5. 1. The “votive stone” represents a memorial to the fallen. A new bridge, celebration, 
ceremony, and reunion aren’t appropriate answers — they just don’t make sense in the 
context of the poem.
 
6. 3. The shot heard round the world refers to the beginning of an event, specifically, the 
American Revolution. The tone of the poem tells you this answer, in descriptions of the 
flag as “unfurling” and the farmers as “embattled.” You don’t, of course, have to know 
which war it was.
 
7. 3. Wally isn’t feeling well because he drank too much wine. You have to draw this conclusion 
from Dwight’s saying that he “noticed a couple empty wineskins behind the fig tree this 
morning.”
 
8. 1. Breakfast table is correct because the characters had just sat down for breakfast. The 
other locations — fig tree, market, bedroom, and vineyard — although mentioned in the 
excerpt, aren’t the setting of the play.

268
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
 
9. 3. Dwight felt it would be better to raise lean calves because they would represent more 
profit. Two of the answers — less profit and more expensive — are the opposite of what’s 
stated in the passage. High fat content may be true, but it isn’t mentioned in the passage. 
Goats aren’t mentioned in the passage, either.
 
10. 5. Dad isn’t paying attention to Dwight because he is worried about Wally. Lost sheep, time 
in the vineyard, buying more land, and reading the paper aren’t the best reasons for Dad’s 
distraction.
 
11. 2. Wally had been drinking wine the night before and is suffering from a hangover. The 
other reasons given — sickness, chores, reading, and working — aren’t appropriate 
answers, based on the passage.
 
12. 3. Both Wally and the wine need to breathe. Wally says, “Wine’s got to breathe, you know. 
And so do I, Dad.”
 
13. 1. Carter left his job because he was lured by the promise of Arctic gold. Leaving his snug 
clerkship may be partially correct, but it isn’t the best answer. The passage doesn’t 
mention “a woman,” except his wife, who stays behind. “Half of his savings” and “the 
heartstrings of men” don’t answer the question.
 
14. 3. He wanted to escape his everyday drudgery in life as a clerk. “Bondage of commerce” 
refers to his dislike of his day routine in the business world. His need for wealth (returns), 
romance, risk taking, and savings are different factors that don’t apply to the question.
 
15. 2. The text says that “Even its [the party’s] goal . . . was the Klondike.”
 
16. 4. It was “ominous” because there was a foreboding of ill-fortune. Throughout the passage, 
words such as “unluckily,” “ominously,” and “evil star . . . in the ascendant” give the 
 passage an ominous feeling. The route certainly was not blissful or hushed. “Surprising” 
doesn’t make sense, and “hardiest” refers to a native of the region.
 
17. 1. The fact that Jacques was native-born and raised in the Northwest made him important 
to the party. The fact that he was a renegade voyageur, born of a Chippewa woman in a 
deerskin lodge where he sucked tallow, isn’t as relevant as his knowledge of the area is to 
his importance to the party.
 
18. 3. Percy was seeking some romance and adventure in his otherwise mundane life. The fact 
that he was an ordinary man with a bank account, who spoke a good deal and was abnormally 
sentimental, aren’t the best answers.
 
19. 2. Sonny felt guilty at not having written sooner. The other answers — that he was lazy, 
busy, afraid, and in a hole — may relate to Sonny’s behavior, feelings, or location, but they 
aren’t the best answers.
 
20. 3. The passage points out that Sonny has been sent to prison. The other choices, while 
mentioned in the excerpt, don’t adequately describe his location.
 
21. 4. “Strong in the head” refers to being smart or intelligent. Humorous, happy, and angry 
aren’t characteristics related to strength or ability. Physically fit relates to the whole body, 
not the brain.
 
22. 5. Sonny would be embarrassed if his parents knew he had been sent to prison.
 
23. 1. Sonny is afraid he’ll flip (or lose his mind) before being released from prison. Being a 
musician doesn’t refer to his life in prison. “Getting anything straight” doesn’t mean 
anything and is a trick question. The other two choices — coming straight back and 
blowing his brains out — refer to things that may happen after he leaves prison, not while 
inside it.
 
24. 3. You know from the first sentence and from lines 10 and 11 that Sonny likes his brother 
and appreciates what his brother has done for him.

 Chapter 21: Answers and Explanations for the Language Arts, Reading Test
 
25. 1. Jimmy finally got a chance to read Martha’s letters after a day’s march. The question 
asks when he read the letters. In the first light of day is incorrect (the passage refers to the 
“last hour of light.”) The other choices refer to where, so they can’t possibly be correct.
 
26. 3. Martha saw Jimmy as just an acquaintance, while he wished they could be lovers. 
Strangers, siblings, and no relationship are incorrect answers.
 
27. 5. He tasted the flaps of envelopes that he knew her tongue had sealed. This shows how 
much he cared for her. The other actions — washing his hands and wrapping the letters — 
are other ways to describe his feelings for her, but they aren’t as strong as his tasting the 
envelope flaps. Holding the letters with the tips of his fingers and reading them at the last 
hour of light don’t describe his feelings.
 
28. 2. Martha enjoyed writing to Jimmy on a purely friendly basis. To say she cared deeply 
(she didn’t), was infatuated (she wasn’t), had a casual interest (it was more than casual), 
or had no feelings at all (she does have some feelings) don’t correctly describe her 
interest.
 
29. 1. The fact that her letters were thick and chatty indicates that she enjoyed writing letters. 
Her respect for Chaucer, her status as an English major, and her beautiful writing aren’t 
the best answers. Professors and roommates don’t relate to her enjoyment.
 
30. 4. The letters served as a source of hope for the future. Other answers — an interesting 
hobby, a pleasing pastime, an escape from boredom, and profound disappointment — may 
all be true, but they don’t indicate the real reason for Jimmy’s deep interest in the letters.
 
31. 2. The column specifically states that the center houses 85 social enterprises. Choice (1) is 
totally wrong and can be instantly eliminated on first reading. The other answers have a 
ring of correctness because the column is about social enterprises, charities, LEF, and 
school leavers, but they have nothing to do with the center and, thus, are wrong.
 
32. 3. The column states that the Learnxs Foundation supports innovative programs. All the 
other answers except for Choice (1) are mentioned or implied in the column; however, 
they aren’t correct answers to the question. You have to read carefully and double-check 
the facts. Just because something is mentioned or is familiar doesn’t mean it’s the right 
answer to the question.
 
33. 5. The passage clearly spells out that Artsjunction’s function is to distribute discarded 
materials to visual arts classes. The other answers may be worthy of effort on behalf of 
some charity or agency, but they aren’t the mandate of Artsjunction.
 
34. 2. The column is very specific about the purpose of the Microtron bus. It provided services 
to employees and clients of small businesses in word and numerical processing. The other 
answers sound like they could be right, but, after rereading the column, you can see that 
they aren’t.
 
 When you’re trying to answer these questions under time constraints, try to remember 
exactly what the passage said. If you only think you remember, go back as quickly as you 
can and skim the piece for key words. In this case the key word is Microtron.
 
35. 4. The passage very precisely spells out the mandate of the Training Renewal Foundation 
as being to serve disadvantaged youth and displaced workers. The other answers may be 
worthy activities for any charity, but they aren’t stated as part of the mandate and, thus, 
are wrong as answers. Choice (3) is just wrong and is a play on another meaning of serves. 
You can immediately exclude this answer and have only four others to consider.
 
36. 3. Employees should wear appropriate clothing to project a professional appearance and 
maintain safety standards. The other requirements — such as refraining from alcohol use, 
not associating with paraphernalia, being respectful, and using non-offensive language — 
don’t relate to appearance.
 
37. 1. Employees must accept the authority of supervisors, as is stated clearly in the passage.

270
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
 
38. 4. Employees must conduct themselves professionally so that the business grows and 
improves.
 
39. 2. To ensure safety and security, employees shouldn’t invite other people in. The promotion 
of dignity, interaction, supervisors, and respect don’t directly relate to ensuring safety and 
security.
 
40. 5. Repeated instances of non-compliance lead to dismissal. The other answers aren’t 
backed up by the passage.

WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT MUIR WOODS?
Under the worn wooden sign ushering one and all
To wander along the broad plank path
And feast your eyes on the majestic redwoods
Some on earth longer than 1,000 years
Their outer layers bathed in shades of brown and black
Towering above but below the clouds
Gazing now at the branches entwined in lovers knots
Nature providing the streams meandering through
Feeding the nourishments required to sustain
Through the times
Fog settles on the highest branches
Elevating trees into the heavens above
Small animals dart about the ground cover
And birds choose between plant and branch
The four seasons offer different hues
While spring follows a babbling stream,
Ending in catch basins
And summer opens to sunlight exposing their vulnerability
And their strength
Fall foliage turns to red and yellow,
With a hint of orange
While winter envelopes the landscape
Wearing a coat of white
Vulnerable now
Waiting again for seasons to renew themselves
For people and animals
To wander again along the broad plank path.

Why did Barbara invite Undershaft to the 
shelter?
 
(1) to march in the band
 
(2) to attend a great meeting
 
(3) to earn pennies
 
(4) to stepdance
 
(5) to be with them in the Assembly
 8. 
What does stepdancing for pennies tell you 
about Undershaft?
 
(1) He has natural talent.
 
(2) He frequented public houses.
 
(3) He had an impoverished youth.
 
(4) He performed passably.
 
(5) He was a skilled musician.
Questions 7 through 12 refer to the following excerpt from George Bernard Shaw’s Major 
Barbara (1905).
WHY IS UNDERSHAFT INTERESTED IN THE SALVATION ARMY?
UNDERSHAFT: One moment, Mr. Lomax. I am rather interested in the Salvation Army. 
Its motto might be my own: Blood and Fire.
LOMAX: (shocked) But not your sort of blood and fire, you know.
UNDERSHAFT: My sort of blood cleanses: my sort of fire purifies.
BARBARA: So does ours. Come down tomorrow to my shelter — the West Ham 
Shelter — and see what we are doing. We’re going to march to a great meeting in the 
Assembly at Mile End. Come and see the shelter and then march with us: It will do 
you a lot of good. Can you play anything?
UNDERSHAFT: In my youth I earned pennies, and even shillings occasionally, in the 
streets and in public house parlors by my natural talent for stepdancing. Later on, I 
became a member of the Undershaft Orchestra Society, and performed passably on 
the tenor trombone.
LOMAX: (scandalized, putting down the concertina) Oh I say!
BARBARA: Many a sinner has played himself into heaven on the trombone, thanks to 
the Army.
LOMAX: (to BARBARA, still rather shocked) Yes; but what about the cannon business, 
don’t you know? (to UNDERSHAFT) Getting into heaven is not exactly in your line, is it?
LADY BRITOMART: Charles!!!
LOMAX: Well; but it stands to reason, don’t it? The cannon business may be neces-
sary and all that; we can’t get along without cannons; but it isn’t right, you know. On 
the other hand, there may be a certain amount of tosh about the Salvation Army — 
I belong to the Established Church myself — but still you can’t deny that it’s religion; 
and you can’t go against religion, can you? At least unless you’re downright immoral, 
don’t you know.

(2) yellow bricks
 
(3) latticed windows
 
(4) gablefronts
 
(5) shingle-roofs
Questions 13 through 18 refer to the following excerpt from Washington Irving’s “Rip Van 
Winkle,” (1819).
WHAT CAN YOU LEARN FROM THE MOUNTAINS?
Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill Mountains. 
They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian family, and are seen away 
to the west of the river, swelling up to a noble height, and lording it over the surround-
ing country. Every change of season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of 
the day, produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains, 
and they are regarded by all the good wives, far and near, as perfect barometers. 
When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in blue and purple, and print 
their bold outlines on the clear evening sky; but, sometimes, when the rest of the land-
scape is cloudless, they will gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, 
in the last rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.
At the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried the light smoke 
curling up from a village, whose shingle-roofs gleam among the trees, just where the 
blue tints of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a 
little village of great antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists, in 
the early times of the province, just about the beginning of the government of the good 
Peter Stuyvesant, (may he rest in peace!) and there were some of the houses of the 
original settlers standing within a few years, built of small yellow bricks brought from 
Holland, having latticed windows and gablefronts, surmounted with weather-cocks.

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE A MAN?
Dave struck out across the fields, looking homeward through paling light . . . One of 
these days he was going to get a gun and practice shooting, then they couldn’t talk to 
him as though he were a little boy. He slowed, looking at the ground. Shucks, Ah ain

strode, feeling his long loose-jointed limbs. Shucks, a man oughta hava little gun aftah 
he done worked hard all day.
He came in sight of Joe’s store. A yellow lantern glowed on the front porch. He 
mounted steps and went through the screen door, hearing it bang behind him. There 
was a strong smell of coal oil and mackerel fish. He felt very confident until he saw fat 
Joe walk in through the rear door, then his courage began to ooze.
“Howdy, Dave! Whutcha want?”
“How yuh, Mistah Joe? Aw, Ah don wanna buy nothing. Ah jus wanted t see ef yuhd

“Sure! You wanna see it here?”
“Nawsuh. Ah wants t take it home wid me. Ah’ll bring it back termorrow when Ah

It began like any other winter school day in Chicago — grimly ordinary. The tempera-
ture a few degrees above zero, botanical frost shapes on the windowpane, the snow 
swept up in heaps, the ice gritty and the streets, block after block, bound together by 
the iron of the sky. A breakfast of porridge, toast, and tea. Late as usual, I stopped for 
a moment to look into my mother’s sickroom. I bent near and said, “It’s Louie, going 
to school.” She seemed to nod. Her eyelids were brown, her face was much lighter. I 
hurried off with my books on a strap over my shoulder.
When I came to the boulevard on the edge of the park, two small men rushed out of a 
doorway with rifles, wheeled around aiming upward, and fired at pigeons near the 
rooftop. Several birds fell straight down, and the men scooped up the soft bodies and 
ran indoors, dark little guys in fluttering white shirts. Depression hunters and their 
city game. Moments before, the police car had loafed by at ten miles an hour. The 
men had waited it out.
This had nothing to do with me. I mention it merely because it happened. I stepped 
around the blood spots and crossed into the park.

Where will you be installing the batteries?
 
(1) an electronic acquisition
 
(2) a children’s toy
 
(3) a big point-and-shoot
 
(4) a camera
 
(5) a flashlight
 32. What is the easiest model in which to 
replace the batteries?
 
(1) compact models
 
(2) big point-and-shoots
 
(3) screw bottoms
 
(4) covers not hinged
 
(5) covers that come off completely
 33. Why should locations such as sewer grates 
and tall grass be avoided when changing 
batteries?
 
(1) Water can get in the camera.
 
(2) Your lens may get dirty.
 
(3) The glare would ruin the picture.
 
(4) Your film would get exposed.
 
(5) The battery cover may be lost.
Questions 31 through 35 refer to the following excerpt from Russell Hart’s Photography For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
WHAT’S THE SECRET TO LOADING BATTERIES?
If you’ve ever had to figure out where to stick batteries in your child’s latest elec-
tronic acquisition, then loading batteries in your point-and-shoot shouldn’t be a chal-
lenge. Turn off your camera when you install them; the camera may go crazy opening 
and closing its lens. (Some cameras turn themselves off after you install new batter-
ies, so you have to turn them back on to shoot.)
With big point-and-shoot models, you typically open a latched cover on the bottom to 
install batteries. More compact models have a battery compartment under a door or 
flap that is incorporated into the side or grip of the camera. You may have to pry 
open such doors with a coin.
More annoying are covers on the bottom that you open by loosening a screw. (You 
need a coin for this type, too.) And most annoying are battery covers that aren’t hinged 
and come off completely when you unscrew them. If you have one of these, don’t 
change batteries while standing over a sewer grate, in a field of tall grass, or on a pier.
Whether loading four AAs or a single lithium, make sure that the batteries are cor-
rectly oriented as you insert them. You’ll find a diagram and/or plus and minus mark-
ings, usually within the compartment or on the inside of the door.
If your camera doesn’t turn on and the batteries are correctly installed, the batteries 
may have lost their punch from sitting on a shelf too long. Which is where the battery 
icon comes in.
If your camera has an LCD panel, an icon tells you when battery power is low.

Questions 36 through 40 refer to the following excerpt, written by Sheila Sarah Franschman 
(2010).
WHAT’S THE MOST COMFORTABLE WAY TO SEE THE SIGHTS?
San Francisco is a walking town and I trudged up and down the hills until my legs were 
ready for a vacation. I walked through Chinatown; explored Union Square; looked up at 
Coit Tower; down at the Golden Gate from the bridge; meandered in Fisherman’s Wharf 
and, of course, shopped Macy’s and Barney’s. While looking at a pair of comfortable shoes 
in a store window, I noticed, tucked away among the souvenir shops, an innocuous store 
front selling tours. What an original idea — seeing San Francisco seated instead of walking.
The next day a small white tour bus picked me up from my hotel at 8.15 a.m., a little 
earlier than I would have preferred, but the anticipation of seeing beautiful California 
while seated got me going. The bus was comfortable and not very crowded, and I 
found a window seat with its view of the world or at least Mason Street.
Traveling the spectacular windswept coastline of northern California I anticipated the high-
light of the trip, called the seventeen-mile drive. I watched as the suburbs of San Francisco 
faded into the distance and each mile took us closer to our destination. I looked at the pic-
tures in the brochure and wondered if the reality was as glorious as the photographs.
The driver explained that this was a century-old route that was originally used by tourists 
in covered wagons. Now, it was a gated community with luxury hotels and golf courses, 
which are still the main attraction after all these years, but I was not there to see people 
swinging clubs. I was there to see the power of the waves and the stillness of the deserted 
beaches. I could tolerate golfers, oblivious to anything except their game, playing on the 
world famous Pebble Beach Golf Links as long as I could commune with my beloved ocean.
Soon enough I saw it. The ocean pounded the beach, lapping up sand only to spit it out 
again in a swirl of water. I was one with the ocean, and the rhythm of the waves washed 
away all present-day concerns. This is what I had come to California to experience.
There are about twenty stops along the route and I watched in wonderment as we slowed 
to enjoy each one. Stopping first at Point Joe, I disembarked with camera in tow, awe-struck 
by the power of the waves and the beauty of the scenery. From this vista point, the terrain 
is studded by rocks jutting above the turbulent waters that stream around them. Standing 
against the backdrop of sky meeting water, people recorded memories to take back home.
People dressed in early winter attire stepped gingerly down steep terrain weathered 
by the elements to get a closer look at the magnificent beach spread before them. All 
of us on the bus had entered the seventeen-mile drive experience.
As the bus passed countless coves and scenic views, we encounter pure white sand 
while curious people move in a dream sequence aimlessly wandering about. I had 
entered the reality of Pebble Beach, the sand danced in the waves resembling an 
unfinished canvas which engulfed me and swirled my imagination.
At the next stop, the Lone Cypress stands majestically perched on the rocky cliff watch-
ing over the Pacific Ocean, a symbol and landmark inspiring amateur photographers 
trying to capture the grandeur on a silicon chip. This tree, growing from a rock, is used 
as a trademark for the resort and typifies the pioneer spirit that must have been part of 
each early Californian as they struggled with nature for their existence. Now, sitting on 
a comfortable bus, I experienced the beauty of the area surrounded by native pine and 
cypress trees, twisted by nature becoming a foil for the Lone Cypress. I admire the 
independence and strength of this tree and the early pioneers as I continue my journey.

trees, standing like a phalanx of apparitions haunting me. I have seen the raw beauty 
of California.

Chapter 23
Answers and Explanations for the 
Language Arts, Reading Test
A
fter taking the Language Arts, Reading Test in Chapter 22, use this chapter to check 
your answers. Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers 
that we provide in the first section. They can help you understand why you missed the 
answers you did. You may also want to read the explanations for the questions you 
answered correctly because doing so can give you a better understanding of the thought 
process that helped you choose the correct answers.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for an abbreviated answer key.
Analysis of the Answers
 
1. 4. From the description in the first part of the poem (trees, stream, birds, small animals, 
and so on), you can tell that the setting is a forest. None of the other answers fit the setting 
described in the poem.
 
2. 2. The poem states that the redwood trees can live longer than 1,000 years (line 4). The 
other answers are factually incorrect. This question is a good example of when skimming 
can help you find an answer quickly because it’s asking for a factual and numeric answer.
 
3. 5. The author describes in detail the changes in color of the settings for each season. The 
other answers may look like they may be right, but there’s no evidence in the poem to 
 support them.
 
4. 4. The author writes, “While winter envelopes the landscape / Wearing a coat of white / 
Vulnerable now.” The other seasons aren’t described in this manner, so you know winter is 
the answer. Choice (5) is incorrect as more than enough information is given to answer the 
question. If you read the question and then skim the poem, you stand a very good chance 
of efficiently getting the right answer.
 
5. 3. The author describes the trees as “bathed in shades of brown and black.” If you have 
some knowledge of redwood trees, you know that the wood is red — not the bark. The 
other colors may be mentioned in the poem but they aren’t referring to the redwood trees.
 
6. 1. The author says that nature provides the needed nourishment and that the streams 
carry it to the trees. Although the other answers are feasible, they’re incorrect based on 
the poem. You must answer the questions based on only the information given in the 
passage. Don’t let any prior knowledge sway you from this task. The correct answer is 
always in the passage.
 
7. 1. Barbara was recruiting players for her marching band and saw Undershaft as a candidate. 
The other answer choices (attending a meeting, earning pennies, stepdancing, and being in 
the Assembly) don’t express her interest in Undershaft.

290
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
8. 3. You know Undershaft had an impoverished youth because he had to stepdance for 
pennies to survive. During this time, poor children danced as entertainment for people 
who might throw them pennies. This way of living was a bit above begging in that the 
children provided some entertainment for the money donated.
 
9. 4. Undershaft was a trombone player who could contribute his musical talents to the 
marching band. Stepdancing, pennies, or shillings aren’t contributions to the band. Natural 
musical talent could be a correct answer, but because a more specific answer exists, you 
need to rule out this one.
 
10. 5. Lomax criticizes Undershaft’s work as a cannon manufacturer, implying that Undershaft 
won’t get to heaven because of his work with cannons. Lomax may be bitter and he may be 
philosophical, but those words don’t describe his treatment of Undershaft. “Friendly” and 
“encouraging” certainly don’t describe Lomax’s demeanor, either.
 
11. 1. Undershaft’s motto could be “Blood and Fire” because he manufactures cannons used to 
kill people in war. Playing the trombone, being a sinner, belonging to the Church, and 
marching aren’t related to blood and fire.
 
12. 2. Barbara doesn’t just preach about good works; she operates a shelter to help poor 
people. This reason is stronger than the other choices given, such as being in the Salvation 
Army, joining in marches, playing the concertina, or recruiting others.
 
13. 2. To locate the Kaatskill Mountains, you need to journey up the Hudson. A dismembered 
branch, fresh green, and surrounding the country aren’t locations that can better help you 
locate the mountains. Although asking directions may work, this approach isn’t mentioned 
in the passage.
 
14. 5. The wives use the magical hues and shapes of the mountains to forecast the weather. 
Other factors, such as the evening sky, gray vapors, or the crown of glory, aren’t as good 
of indicators. A barometer is an instrument to measure air pressure.
 
15. 3. To help you locate the village, you first need to look for light smoke curling from 
chimneys. You can’t see the other sign, shingle-roofs, as soon as you can see the smoke. 
Mountains, tents, and great antiquity aren’t signs for locating villages.
 
16. 4. The Dutch colonists were the newcomers who founded the village. Peter Stuyvesant 
established the government. The great Appalachian family refers to the mountains. The 
voyager discovered the village in his travels.
 
17. 1. Peter Stuyvesant, who had headed the government, had since died. The other answer 
choices describe Stuyvesant as an original settler, a voyager, a soldier, and a governor, but 
they don’t refer to his death.
 
18. 2. Settlers brought yellow bricks from Holland to build the houses. Other materials, such 
as weather-cocks, windows, gablefronts, and shingle-roofs, were locally acquired.
 
19. 3. Dave worked as a field hand on the Hawkins’s farm. He hopes his mother will let him buy 
a gun with his wages from Hawkins. He wasn’t unemployed, and he didn’t work at Joe’s 
store, Sears Roebuck, or with his Ma.
 
20. 1. He wants to show the other field hands that he isn’t scared of them. Dave mentions that 
he isn’t afraid of them just before he first discusses buying the gun.
 
21. 4. Dave had to purchase the gun through the Sears Roebuck catalog. Joe didn’t keep guns 
in his store. Mr. Hawkins, Ma, and the field hands aren’t sources of guns.
 
22. 4. Joe kept a yellow lantern glowing on the porch. Other answer choices, such as the smell 
of mackerel, the banging screen door, the coal oil smell, and the rear door, may also help 
you find the store, but they aren’t the best indicators.
 
23. 1. Dave lost his nerve and was afraid to ask Joe to see guns in the catalog. The other 
possibilities — it was too dark, he needed to get home for supper, he made his own 
money, and he had to ask for his mother’s permission — aren’t the best answers.

291
 Chapter 23: Answers and Explanations for the Language Arts, Reading Test
 
24. 2. Dave would have to convince Ma to give him the money to buy the gun. The other 
reasons, including finding it in the catalog, persuading Joe, returning the catalog, or getting 
ol man Hawkins’s permission, either aren’t relevant or aren’t as important as convincing 
Ma to give him the money.
 
25. 3. The winter sky was grim and the streets were gritty in Chicago. Botanical frost refers to 
the windowpane. Snow was swept in heaps for block after block. The iron sky is only one 
characteristic, and it isn’t the most important.
 
26. 5. Louie was living with his mother, who was very ill and confined to bed. Other answers 
describing Louie’s breakfast, his punctuality, his books, and his complexion aren’t good 
descriptions of the focus of his home life.
 
27. 1. The men were hunting pigeons (game) for food. You can see that having target practice, 
staying out of the weather, hiding from the police, and going to the park are inappropriate 
answers if you’ve read the passage thoroughly.
 
28. 4. They were able to knock several birds from the sky. The other answer choices — that 
the men were running indoors, were small in size, and had rifles or that the pigeons were 
near the rooftop — don’t answer the question.
 
29. 2. The hunters and their families must have been hungry for food to hunt pigeons in the 
street. The other adjectives — angry, happy, brave, and careless — don’t adequately 
describe why they were hunting.
 
30. 3. What Louie saw had nothing to do with him, and he didn’t want to get involved. Other 
possible answers — that he was hurrying to school, his mother was sick, or he was friends 
with the guys or that the guys were depression hunters — don’t relate to why Louie 
wouldn’t tell the police.
 
31. 4. The batteries are installed in a camera. Other answer choices, such as electronics, a 
children’s toy, or a flashlight, have no meaning in this excerpt. Point-and-shoot, while 
another term for a camera, isn’t the best answer.
 
32. 2. The easiest model in which to replace batteries is in the point-and-shoot camera. The 
other answer choices — compact models, screw bottoms, and different types of covers — 
don’t relate directly to the question.
 
33. 5. Avoid all the locations mentioned so that you don’t lose your battery cover if you drop 
it. Sewer grates and tall grass are places where the cover could easily be lost. The rest of 
the answer choices refer to issues other than losing battery covers.
 
34. 4. To ensure that the batteries are correctly oriented, you must find the diagram and use 
it. Other choices, such as using four AAs or a single lithium, emptying the compartment, or 
checking inside the film box, don’t answer the question.
 
35. 2. You must check the battery icon to see whether the batteries are low. According to the 
passage, the LCD panel, compartment, lithium battery, and diagram markings aren’t correct 
answers.
 
36. 3. At first, the author walked around San Francisco. The author used the bus for a trip 
outside the city after she walked around the city itself, and the passage doesn’t mention 
public transit, automobiles, or limousines. You can pick this answer easily by reading the 
questions first and then skimming the passage.
 
37. 4. The author states quite emphatically that the seventeen-mile drive was the highlight of 
the trip. The author saw all the other places, but none elicited the response of the seventeen-
mile drive.
 
38. 1. In the passage, the bus driver explained to the passengers that the seventeen-mile drive 
is really a gated community. It also contains a golf course and a luxury hotel, but it is a 
gated community itself. You have to read the questions and passage carefully to make sure 
of the answer. Skimming may have provided you with three possible answers (3, 4, and 5) 
and one unlikely but still possible answer (2). More careful reading provides only one 
correct answer (1).

292
Part V: Checking Your Comprehension: The Language Arts, Reading Test 
 
39. 1. The first answer is a direct quote from the passage, so you know right away that it’s 
right. The other answers are possible but not specifically mentioned as impressing the 
author. Two of the answers (3 and 4) aren’t located at Point Joe, one answer (5) is from 
another century, and the last answer (2) isn’t specifically associated with Point Joe. When 
you find a direct quote that answers the question, choosing the right answer is easy to do.
 
40. 2. The Lone Cypress is used as a trademark for the resort and, for this reason, has become 
famous. The other answers may or may not be right, but they aren’t specifically mentioned 
by the author. You can use only items that are specifically mentioned or directly implied 
as your answer. Other answers may be possible, but the answer you want is the one that’s 
there in the passage.

Counting All the 
Possible Solutions: 
The Mathematics Test

In this part . . .
T
his part includes ways to use the mathematics you’ve 
learned over the years to pass the Mathematics Test. 
Here you discover why this test has different answer 
forms and how to use them. To help you build confidence 
for this part of the GED, we show you that you really do 
know a lot about math — and that you may have been too 
frightened of the subject before to think about everything 
you know. We do our best to show you that math can 
be fun — or at least not horrible — and we offer you 
strategies that can help you do your best on this test.
Like the other test parts, this part includes two complete 
practice tests. Take the allotted time to answer these 
problems, and then be sure to check your answers to see 
if you were right. If you don’t answer a question or two (or 
more) correctly, use the explanations we provide to help 
you understand how to work out the problems.
Before you start preparing for the Mathematics Test, 
remember this: You can conquer math — and this part will 
help you do just that.

elcome to the dreaded Mathematics Test. Although you may have done everything 
to avoid math in high school, you can’t escape this test if you want to pass the GED. 
To tell you the truth, test takers really do have nightmares about this test, but don’t worry! 
This chapter helps you prepare not for having nightmares but for taking the test successfully.
Most of the questions in the other GED tests are about reading comprehension: You’re 
given a passage and are expected to understand it well enough to correctly answer the 
questions that follow. Although you can prepare for the other tests by doing a lot of reading 
and taking sample tests, you don’t have to come in with a lot of knowledge or great skills in 
the test areas themselves.
The Mathematics Test, however, tests your understanding of mathematical concepts and 
your ability to apply them to situations you may find in the real world, which means you 
have to spend time solving as many problems as you can and improving your math skills as 
much as possible before you take this test. This chapter gives you some tips and tricks for 
studying for the GED Mathematics Test.
Looking at the Skills the Math Test Covers
Math isn’t scary, and it has yet to appear as the villain in any major Hollywood horror films 
(at least that we know about). In fact, math can even be fun when you put your mind to it. In 
any case, the Mathematics Test assesses your abilities in math, so you have to be ready for 
it. This is the one GED subject that requires a special way of thinking and understanding — 
improving your ability to think mathematically will make your job of passing this test easier.
To do well on the Mathematics Test, you need to have a general understanding of numbers, 
their relationships to one another, measurements, geometry, data analysis and statistics, 
probability, patterns, functions, and algebra. (If you don’t know what we mean by these 
terms, check out the next section “Understanding the Test Format.”) In essence, to be 
successful on this test, you need to have the mathematical knowledge base that most high 
school graduates have and you need to know how to apply it to solve real-life problems. If, 
after reading this chapter, you’re still worried about solving different math problems, take 
some time to go through a few high school math books at your local library or sign up for a 
math prep class or a math study group.

296
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
Understanding the Test Format
The Mathematics Test consists of two parts, each with 25 questions. You have 90 minutes 
to complete both parts. Part I allows you to use a calculator; Part II bans the calculator in 
favor of your brain. (You’re given scratch paper to use for rough calculations.) You have to 
pass both parts to pass this test.
 
A formula sheet is provided for you to use during the test. Keep in mind that you may not 
need all the formulas provided, and you may not need a formula for every question. Part of 
the fun of math is knowing which formula to use for which problems and figuring out when 
you don’t need one at all.
The Mathematics Test is different from all the other tests in the GED because you have different 
ways to answer the questions on this test. This test assesses the following four areas. Each of 
the four areas gets approximately equal billing on the test. You can expect to find between 5 and 
7 questions (or 20 to 30 percent of the total number of questions) on each area.
 
✓ Number operations and number sense: Surprise, surprise — these problems deal with 
numbers. Here’s a breakdown of the two topics in this category:
 
• Number operations are the familiar actions you take in math problems and 
equations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You probably 
mastered these operations in grade school; now all you have to do is practice them.
 
• Number sense is the ability to understand numbers. You’re expected to be able to 
recognize numbers (not a difficult task), know their relative values (that 5 is 
larger than 3, for example), and know how to use them (which takes us back to 
number operations). In addition, number sense includes the ability to estimate 
(or approximate) the result of number operations — which is always a handy skill 
on a timed test.
 
✓ Measurement and geometry: Here, you get a chance to play with mathematical shapes 
and manipulate them in your head. You get to use the Pythagorean relationship (or 
 theorem) to do all sorts of interesting calculations, and you get to use measurements to 
do things like find the volume of ice cream in a cone or the amount of paint you need to 
cover a wall. If you relax, you can have fun with these questions and then maybe even 
use a lot of the knowledge in real life. This category breaks down into two topics:
 
• Measurement involves area, volume, time, and the distance from here to there. 
Measurement of time is a good thing to know when taking any test because you 
want to make sure you run out of questions before you run out of time!
 
• Geometry is the part of mathematics that deals with measurement. It also deals 
with relationships and properties of points, lines, angles, and planes. This branch 
of math requires you to draw and use diagrams.
 
✓ Data analysis, statistics, and probability: If you pay attention and practice the concepts 
in this category, you’ll be able to think more clearly about the next political poll that 
shows that every representative of the party sponsoring the poll is good and all others 
are evil. This category breaks down into the following types:
 
• Data analysis allows you to analyze data. You probably already practice this skill 
without realizing it. When you read about stock performance or lack of performance, 
calculate or read about baseball statistics, or figure out how many miles per 
gallon your car gets, you’re doing data analysis.
 
• Statistics and probability are part of data analysis. Statistics is the interpretation 
of collections of random numbers and can be used to prove one thing or another; 
probability tells you how often an event happens.
 
✓ Algebra, functions, and patterns: You most likely use these concepts in everyday life, 
although you may not know that you do. Here’s a breakdown of the three types in this 
category:

• Algebra is a form of mathematics used to solve problems by using letters to 
represent unknown numbers, creating equations from the information given, and 
solving for the unknown numbers — thus, turning them into known numbers. If 
you ever said something like, “How much more does the $10 scarf cost than the 
$7.50 one?” you were really solving this equation: 7.50 + x = 10.00.
 
• Functions are part of mathematics. They involve the concept that one number can 
be determined by its relationship with another. A dozen always consists of 12 units, 
for example. If you were buying two dozen eggs, you’d be buying 12 × 2 = 24 eggs.
 
• Patterns are the predictable repeat of a situation. For example, if someone told 
you the first four numbers in a pattern were 1, 2, 3, 4 and asked you what the next 
number was, you’d say “5” pretty fast. This simple pattern involves adding one to 
each number to get the next one. Most patterns get more complicated than this 
one, but, if you keep your wits about you, you can figure out how to solve them.
Make sure you understand how to solve problems involving these four math concepts. (The 
“Practicing with Sample Problems” section later in this chapter gives you examples on how 
to do so.) If you already have a firm grasp on these topics, go ahead and take the practice 
tests in Chapters 25 and 27. However, if you need to review most of this material, read the 
following sections for more info, and take the mini–practice test in this chapter. You can 
check your answers and read the explanations when you’re done. If you need to review 
certain concepts even more, be sure to do so. Then you can take the full practice tests. 
Identifying the Types of Questions and 
Knowing How to Tackle Them
The Mathematics Test breaks down into four main types of questions. If you have a basic 
understanding of these question types, you can avoid any surprises when you sit down to 
the take the test. The following sections explain the four types of questions you encounter 
on this test and offer advice on how to prepare for them so you can solve them with ease 
when you see them on the test.
Multiple-choice questions
Most of the questions on the GED tests are multiple choice. In these questions, you’re given 
five possible answers, and you have to choose the one best answer. Most of the multiple-
choice questions on the Mathematics Test give you some information or show you figures 
and ask you to solve the problem based on that info or those figures. But you may also see 
the following special types of questions:
 
✓ Set-up questions: These questions don’t expect you to calculate specific answers but 
ask you what steps you’d take to solve them. Before you declare this type of question 
to be your favorite, keep in mind that you still have to choose the correct way to solve 
the problem. You just get to skip the final step of calculating the answer.
 
✓ Not-enough-information questions: These questions don’t give you enough information 
to calculate specific answers. The only right answer is “not enough information given.” 
Only 4 percent of the questions on the test are of this type, so if you answer more than 
two questions this way, you may not be looking at the questions carefully enough.
 
 Some of the questions on this test may have extra information — just ignore it. Of 
course, you have to make sure the information you decide is extra really is extra. You 
don’t want to disregard anything essential to solving the problem.

Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 
Because you’re assessed no penalty for guessing, if you don’t know the answer to a 
question, guess. Although you can’t get a point for a blank answer, you can get a point for 
eliminating all but the most possible answer and marking it (if you’re correct, of course).
Alternate-format questions
Alternate-format questions ask you to calculate the answers without choosing from five 
possible answers. For these questions, you write down real numbers or fill in actual graphs. 
Because the Mathematics Test is machine graded, you can’t just write down numbers on 
paper. Instead, you use an alternate-format grid, which comes in one of two formats (see 
the following two sections).
 
The test has about ten questions that require you to record your answers on an alternate-
format grid. Don’t panic: Just concentrate on reading the instructions and calculating your 
answers.
Standard grid
Questions that require you to use a standard grid (see Figure 24-1) to record your answers 
are very similar to multiple-choice questions except that they don’t give you five choices. 
When you come up with your answer on a standard-grid question, record it on the standard 
grid by writing the numbers in the open spaces and filling in the corresponding circles below 
the numbers. (If you don’t fill in the circles, you can’t get a point for your answer.)

A standard 
grid.

Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you work your way through the standard-grid 
questions:
 
✓ No answer entered on a standard grid can be a mixed number. If your answer is a 
mixed number (a whole number and a fraction), convert your answer to a decimal 
before entering it on the grid. You convert to a decimal by dividing the top number of 
the fraction by the bottom number and adding that decimal to the whole number; for 
example, 13⁄4 becomes 1.75. If, on the other hand, your answer is an improper fraction 
(one in which the top number is larger than the bottom number), you have the choice 
of entering the number this way on the grid or converting it to a decimal and entering 
that number.

299
 Chapter 24: Safety in Numbers: Facing the Mathematics Test, Parts I and II
 
✓ No answer entered on a standard grid can be negative. If you come up with an 
answer that’s a negative number, check your calculations because it’s wrong.
Coordinate-plane grid
Questions that require you to use a coordinate-plane grid to record your answers are 
mostly geometry problems. The coordinate-plane grid is a two-dimensional graph with 
circles placed at regular points. You indicate your answer by filling in a circle to indicate a 
point on the graph (as with all other questions on this test, make sure you fill in the circles 
completely). Take a look at the coordinate-plane grid in Figure 24-2 for the point (3, 2).

The best way to prepare for questions with coordinate-plane grids is to practice geometry 
questions. Borrow a high school geometry textbook to find your fill of sample questions. 
Just be sure you understand the answers to those questions, too. If you feel the need for 
even more geometry problems, check out Math Word Problems For Dummies by Mary Jane 
Sterling (Wiley). With all the problems in this book and that book, you should have all the 
practice you need.
 
If you spend all your time doing problems to be 100 percent sure that you know everything 
there is to know, you may never get the chance to take the tests to prove what you know. So 
just do the best you can in the time you have before you take the GED tests.
Questions with a calculator
Part I of the Mathematics Test lets you use a calculator — not just any calculator, however. 
On test day, you’ll receive a special calculator — the Casio FX-260 solar calculator — to use 
on this part of the Mathematics Test. This calculator may seem like a real bonus, but don’t 
forget that you have to return it along with your test booklet. If you’re calculator-phobic or 
worried about using a scientific calculator, try to get your hands on one to practice with 
before the test. You can check out an interesting video on how to use the calculator at  
www.acenet.edu/programs/gedts/media/calc.wmv.
 
You’re probably familiar with calculators that add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The Casio 
FX-260, however, is a scientific calculator, which means it does all those operations and a 
whole lot more. The Casio FX-260 calculates fractions, percents, exponents, problems 
involving parentheses, and so on. Note that you won’t necessarily use all the keys on the 
calculator to take the test. Many test centers require you to preview a short film on how to 
use the calculator before the Mathematics Test. Call your local administrator to find out 
whether the film is available at your site.

300
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
Being given a calculator to use in Part I of the Mathematics Test has a downside, too. 
Because test takers can use a calculator, the questions in this part tend to be a bit harder 
with more steps than in the noncalculator part. However, in general, if you know how to set 
up the problems, the calculator makes them easier for you to solve.
Questions without a calculator
Part II of the Mathematics Test doesn’t let you use a calculator — unless you count the 
calculator you were born with (that’s right, your brain). You’re given scratch paper on the 
test, but the more questions you practice in your head, the easier the noncalculator test 
questions will be. Here are some easy ways to practice solving problems in your head:
 
✓ When you go shopping, add up the items as you put them in the cart.
 
✓ Calculate discounts when you shop.
 
✓ Be the first at your table in a restaurant to figure out the tip.
 
For multiple-choice questions, sometimes it’s easier and faster to estimate the answer to a 
question. For example, 4.2 × 8.9 is almost 4 × 9, which equals 36. If you see only one answer 
that’s close to 36, that answer is probably correct. If you see five answers that are close to 
36, however, you need to spend time calculating the exact answer. Although you may be 
able to solve problems in your head, always work them on paper to verify you have the 
 correct answer.
Examining Preparation Strategies That Work
To get ready for the Mathematics Test, you first have to relax and realize that math is your 
friend — perhaps not a lifetime friend but a friend at least until you finish this test. You also 
need to consider that you’ve been using math all your life (and probably didn’t even know 
it). When you tell a friend that you’ll be over in 20 minutes, for example, you use math. 
When you see a sale sign in the store and mentally figure out whether or not you can afford 
the sale-priced item, you use math. When you complain about the poor mileage your car 
gets (and can prove it), you use math. Lucky for you, we’re here to help you get more 
familiar with math (and how to use it) so that you’re ready for everything the Mathematics 
Test throws at you. The following are some strategies you can implement to help you get 
better results:
 
✓ Read and make sure you understand what you read. What all the GED tests have in 
common is that they all assess, in one way or another, reading comprehension; if you 
can’t read and understand the questions, you can’t answer them. As we mention time 
and time again in this book, just reading isn’t always enough — you have to stop and ask 
yourself questions about what you read. A good way to practice this skill is to find an old 
math textbook. Don’t worry about the grade level or even the content. If it’s full of prob-
lems to solve, it’ll work. Read through each problem and ask yourself these questions: 
What does this problem want me to find? What is the answer in general terms?
 
 If you need more practice reading and understanding math problems, go to the 
“Practicing with Sample Problems” section later in this chapter or check out one of the 
following (all published by Wiley):

• Math Word Problems For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling 

301
 Chapter 24: Safety in Numbers: Facing the Mathematics Test, Parts I and II
 
✓ Solve the problem with the information on the page — not with the information you 
may have in your head. Some questions may not give you enough information to solve 
the problem. For example, a question may ask for a conclusion that you can’t make 
from the information given on the page. Even if you know some information that would 
help you solve the problem, don’t use it. The people who write the test questions 
include and exclude information for a purpose — extra information can make guessing 
more difficult and separate the test takers who are paying attention from those who 
aren’t, and, sometimes, extra information is put in to make the question a bit more 
realistic. They don’t depend on you to add information.
 
 You bring with you to the test the knowledge of what the basic operations are and how 
to use them. You aren’t expected to know the dimensions of some fictional 
character’s room or how well Alice does on her reading scores. You’re expected to 
know how to solve problems and to leave the specifics of the problems to the tester.
 
✓ Realize that not every question is solvable. Some questions don’t include enough 
information to solve the problem, or they ask a question that can’t be answered with 
the information given in the question. If you come across a question you can’t answer, 
don’t panic! Reread the question to make sure it can’t be answered.
 
 One clue that a question may not be able to be answered is an answer choice that says, 
“Not enough information given.” Don’t assume this clue means you don’t have enough 
information, though, because some questions that can be solved include this answer 
choice to make you think. Use this clue only when you’ve already determined that the 
question can’t be solved.
 
✓ Take the practice tests in this book, and check your answers. Turn to Chapters 25 
and 27 to take the full-length practice tests. Hold yourself to the test’s time constraints, 
and make sure you answer all the questions. Then be sure to check your answers and 
read through all the answer explanations in Chapters 26 and 28. Going through the 
answers shows you on which areas of the test you need extra help.
Try not to be intimidated by the word math or the subject as a whole. A math teacher once 
said that mathematicians are lazy people — they always use the easiest way to find the 
right answer. We don’t want to insult or irritate any mathematicians by calling them lazy, 
but finding the easiest way to solve a problem is usually the right way. If your way is too 
long and complicated, it’s probably not right.
Managing Your Time for the Math Test
The Mathematics Test allows you 90 minutes to complete 50 questions (you get 45 minutes 
to answer the first 25 questions, followed by a short break, and then you get another 45 
minutes for the last 25 questions). For the mathematically inclined, that equals 1 minute 
and 48 seconds for each question. If you want some time to review your answers, you have 
less than 11⁄2 minutes for each question. To help you manage your time for the Mathematics 
Test, check out the following suggestions (refer to Chapters 2 and 3 for some general time-
management tips):
 
✓ Experiment. You need a second person to complete this exercise. After finding a friend 
to help you, close your eyes and try to estimate the length of 11⁄2 minutes. Indicate the 
beginning and end of the time by tapping the table with a finger or a pencil, and have 
your friend measure and report on your accuracy. Repeat this exercise many times until 
you can estimate 11⁄2 minutes repeatedly and accurately. Next, pick a question from the 
“Practicing with Sample Problems” section later in this chapter, and try to do it in 11⁄2 
minutes. Being able to manage your time is the most important indicator of success on 
any test like the GED.

302
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 
 If you can keep to your schedule of less than 11⁄2 minutes per question, you’ll have 
enough time to go over your answers and make any changes necessary after you finish 
solving all the questions.
 
 With such a tight schedule for taking the Mathematics Test, there’s clearly no time to 
panic. Aside from the fact that panicking distracts you from your overall goal, it also 
takes time — and you have very little time to spare. So relax and just do your best — 
save the panicking for another day.
 
✓ Time yourself. If you don’t see what’s being asked by a question within a few seconds, 
reread the question and try again. If it still isn’t clear, go on to the next question. 
Spending all your time trying to solve one problem at the expense of the others isn’t a 
good idea. Watch your watch. Put it on the table in front of you. If it doesn’t have a 
second hand or a second indicator, consider borrowing one that does.
 
 Practice timing yourself as you work your way through the practice tests in Chapters 
25 and 27. Getting familiar with how to keep track of your time before you get to the 
real test can help you make sure you run out of questions before you run out of time.
 
✓ Speed-read. The key to developing your speed-reading skills is making sure you don’t 
sacrifice your understanding of the material you’re reading along the way. Follow these 
steps to improve your speed-reading skills:
 
1. Find any book with short paragraphs and calculate the number of words in two 
typical paragraphs. The easiest way to do so is to count the number of words in 
three consecutive lines and divide by three. (Isn’t it interesting how math creeps 
into everything?) Write down the average number of words per line so you don’t 
forget it, and multiply it by the number of lines in a paragraph to figure out the 
number of words in the paragraph.
 
2. Now recruit your friend for help again. At a signal from your friend, start to read 
the paragraph and signal when you’re finished. You can then calculate how long 
it took you to read a word by dividing the time you spent reading by the number 
of words.
 
3. Read other paragraphs in the same way, but try to read them faster. You may try 
leading your eyes with your fingers by moving your finger across the line of text 
and slowly speeding up the rate you read. Check out Speed Reading For Dummies 
by Richard Sutz (Wiley) for more tips and practice ideas. If you think increasing 
your reading speed would increase your test scores or reduce your anxiety about 
finishing all the questions in the allotted time, this book is a good one to look at 
for help.
Practicing with Sample Problems
The best way to get ready for the Mathematics Test is to practice problems. You encounter 
problems on this test that evaluate your skills in a wide variety of areas, so check out the 
sample problems in this section to help you prepare for all of them. We provide several exam-
ples for each skill on the test. At the end of this section, we give you another minitest to help 
you practice even more. You can then check out Chapters 25 and 27 for additional practice.
Number operations and number sense
To do well on the questions that address number operations and number sense, you need 
to be able to use numbers in equivalent forms, such as integers, fractions, decimals, percents, 
exponents, and scientific notation, and recognize equivalences (5⁄50 = 1⁄10 = 0.1 = 10%). You 
need to know how to use whole numbers, decimals, fractions, percents, ratios, proportions, 

303
 Chapter 24: Safety in Numbers: Facing the Mathematics Test, Parts I and II
exponents, roots, and scientific notation when appropriate and how to decide which 
operation to use to solve problems. For these types of problems, you also want to be able to 
relate basic arithmetic operations to one another (for example, knowing that addition and 
subtraction are opposite operations: 5 + 2 = 7 and 7 – 2 = 5). Finally, you must know how to 
perform calculations with pencil and paper, with a calculator, and in your head, as well as 
how to estimate the solution to a problem to ensure that your answer is reasonable.
Try out the following example problems for practice with number operations and number sense:
 
1. Vlad is shopping for a new shirt because all the stores are having end-of-season sales. Sam’s 
Special Shirts offers Vlad 20% off all his purchases while Hardworking Harry’s Haberdashery 
has a special sale offering five shirts for the price of four. Which is the better deal?
 
(1) neither
 
(2) Sam’s Special Shirts
 
(3) both are the same
 
(4) Hardworking Harry’s Haberdashery
 
(5) not enough information given
In this case, the correct answer is Choice (3) because five shirts for the price of four repre-
sents a 20% discount. Consider buying four shirts for $10 each and getting one more free. 
Then your five shirts would cost you $40 or an average price of $8 each, which is 20% off the 
regular price ($10). Keep in mind that the same prices are often stated in different ways.
 
2. Lillian is drawing a scale diagram of her apartment to take with her while shopping for rugs. 
If she has taken all the measurements in the apartment, what operation would she use to 
draw the scale drawing?
 
(1) decimals
 
(2) exponents
 
(3) ratios
 
(4) scientific notation
 
(5) addition
The correct answer is Choice (3). A scale drawing involves representing one dimension 
with a smaller one while keeping the shape of the room the same. Lillian may have decided 
to represent 1 foot in real life by 1 inch on her drawing (a ratio of 1 foot to 1 inch), resulting 
in a 12-foot wall being represented by a 12-inch line. Not all the answers are operations and 
would have to be excluded immediately.
 
3. Sylvia couldn’t fall asleep one night and got to wondering how much water her bedroom 
would hold if she filled it to the ceiling. She measured all the walls and knew all the 
measurements, including length, width, and height. What operation should she use to 
calculate how many cubic feet of water would be needed to fill the room?
 
(1) addition
 
(2) subtraction
 
(3) multiplication
 
(4) division
 
(5) roots
The correct answer is Choice (3) because the formula to calculate the volume of a room is 
to multiply the length by the width by the height. (The formula for calculating volume is 
listed on the formula sheet provided with the Mathematics Test — see Chapters 25 and 27.)

304
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 
4. Hassan has developed a new trick to play on his classmates. He asks them to write down 
their ages and multiply by 4, divide by 2, then subtract 6, and, finally, add 8. When they tell 
him the resulting number, Hassan can always tell them their age. If one of his friends tells 
Hassan the resultant number is 52, how old is he?
 
(1) 33
 
(2) 25
 
(3) 52
 
(4) 24
 
(5) 26
The correct answer is Choice (2). Hassan knows that multiplication and division are 
opposite operations, which means that multiplying by 4 and dividing by 2 produces a 
number twice the original. Addition and subtraction are opposites, too, so subtracting 6 and 
adding 8 results in a number 2 larger than the original. If the number Hassan’s friend tells 
him is 52, Hassan simply has to subtract 2 from the resultant number (52) and divide by 2, 
giving him an answer of 25.
 
5. Susie is shopping for a few groceries. She buys a loaf of bread for $1.29 and a half-gallon of 
milk for $1.47. She sees her favorite cheese on sale for $2.07. If she has $5.00 in her purse, 
can she buy the cheese?
 
(1) unsure
 
(2) yes
 
(3) not enough money
 
(4) too much information
 
(5) not enough information
The correct answer is Choice (2). The simplest way to solve this problem is to add the cost 
of the bread and milk to get $2.76. The cheese is $2.07, which added to the $2.76 gives you a 
total of $4.83, which is less than $5.00. You can also estimate the result by adding $1.30 
(approximation of $1.29) and $1.50 (approximation of $1.47) to get $2.80. If you then add 
$2.10 (approximation of $2.07) for the cheese, the result is $4.90, which is less than $5.00. 
Using approximations can help you answer some questions quickly and give you an idea of 
whether or not an answer you achieved using a calculator makes sense.
Measurement and geometry
To do well on the questions that address measurements and geometry, you need to be 
able to solve problems involving geometric figures using the ideas of perpendicularity, 
parallelism, congruence, and similarity. You need to know how to “see” geometric figures 
and their translations and rotations, as well as how to understand and use the Pythagorean 
relationship (or theorem) to solve problems. You also must be able to calculate and use the 
slope of a line (which is rise over run), the y-intercept of a line (the point at which the line 
crosses the y-axis), and the intersection of two lines (where two lines meet). And you need 
to know how to use coordinates to describe and draw geometrical figures on a graph.
You must be able to identify, estimate, and convert units of metric and customary 
measurement and solve problems involving uniform rates (miles per hour, for example). 
You need to be able to read and interpret scales, meters, and gauges. In addition, you 
need to know how to solve questions involving length, perimeter, area, volume, angle 
measurements, capacity weight, and mass. Finally, you need to be able to predict how a 
change in length and width affects the perimeter, area, and volume of an object.

305
 Chapter 24: Safety in Numbers: Facing the Mathematics Test, Parts I and II
Try out the following example problems for practice with measurement and geometry:
 
1. Alvin is drawing a diagram of his room. He has drawn the line representing the floor and is 
ready to draw the line representing the wall. How would that line be related to the line 
representing the floor?
 
(1) congruent
 
(2) parallel
 
(3) similar
 
(4) perpendicular
 
(5) equal
The correct answer is Choice (4) because walls are perpendicular to floors (if they weren’t, 
the room would probably collapse).
 
2. Olga designed a logo consisting of an equilateral triangle in a circle for a new company. She 
designed it with one vertex of the triangle pointing north-northeast. The client said she liked 
the design but preferred that the vertex of the triangle point due south. What rotation 
would Olga have to perform to satisfy her client?
 
(1) 90 degrees to the right
 
(2) 45 degrees to the left
 
(3) 110 degrees to the right
 
(4) 135 degrees to the left
 
(5) 135 degrees to the right
The correct answer is Choice (5). If you visualize the equilateral triangle drawn within the 
circle with one vertex pointing north-northeast, you can see that the vertex is 45 degrees 
above the horizontal, which is due east. To go from due east to due south requires a 
rotation of 90 degrees to the right. The entire rotation would consist of 45 degrees + 90 
degrees = 135 degrees to the right. If reading about this problem is confusing, draw it. 
Diagrams often make problems easier to visualize.
 
3. Georgio wants to climb a ladder perched beside his house to check the condition of the 
eaves, which are 22 feet above the ground. For safety, the ladder should be placed 10 feet 
from the house. What would be the minimum length of ladder he would need to reach the 
eaves, rounded to the nearest foot?
 
(1) 24
 
(2) 25
 
(3) 26
 
(4) 27
 
(5) 28
The correct answer is Choice (2). You represent a ladder perched against a house by a 
right-angled triangle with the vertical height of 22 feet and a base of 10 feet. The ladder 
represents the hypotenuse of the triangle. To calculate the length of the ladder, you have 
to use the Pythagorean relationship. If you represent the length of the ladder as x, 
. Because you want the ladder to be long enough to 
reach the wall, it has to be 25 feet long. 

306
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 
Pythagoras, a Greek mathematician, proved that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-
angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The hypotenuse is 
the side opposite the right angle. You find the Pythagorean relationship on the formula 
sheet you get with your test, so don’t forget to check it for important information you may 
need as you work through the test.
 
4. Calvin and Kelvin, carpenters extraordinaire, are building a staircase for their clients, the 
Coalmans. The stairway is to bridge a space 10 feet high, and the distance from the front of 
the bottom step to the back of the top step is 14 feet. What is the slope of the stairway to 2 
decimal places?
 
(1) 0.68
 
(2) 0.69
 
(3) 0.70
 
(4) 0.71
 
(5) 0.72
The correct answer is Choice (4). To calculate the slope, you have to divide the rise by the 
run. That is 
, or 0.71 to 2 decimal places.
 
The slope of a line is rise over run (see the following figure). Thus, the slope of a stairway is 
equal to the distances above the floor of the last step over the distance from the front of the 
first step to the back of the top step.

6. Felix and Francis have just bought new cars. Felix, being American, has a car with a 
speedometer graduated in customary units. Francis, being Canadian, has a speedometer 
graduated in metric units. When they’re driving in Felix’s car at a speed of 55 miles per 
hour, what would Francis’s speedometer read in kilometers per hour?
 
(1) 160
 
(2) 88
 
(3) 55
 
(4) 77
 
(5) 100
The correct answer is Choice (2). Because 1 mile = 1.6 kilometers, 55 miles = 
88 kilometers (55 × 1.6). The speeds are both in units per hour, so 55 mph = 88 kph.
 
7. Aaron wants to paint the floor of his apartment. His living room/dining room is 19 feet by 
16 feet, his bedroom is 12 feet by 14 feet, and his hallways are 6 feet by 8 feet. Bowing to 
pressure from his friends, he has decided not to paint the floor of the kitchen or the 
bathroom. How many square feet of floor must he paint?
 
(1) 304
 
(2) 520
 
(3) 250
 
(4) 216
 
(5) 560
The correct answer is Choice (2). To find the area, you multiply the length by the width. The 
area of the living room/dining room is 19 × 16 = 304 square feet, the area of the bedroom is 
12 × 14 = 168 square feet, and the area of the hallway is 6 × 8 = 48 square feet. The total area 
is the sum of the room areas or 304 + 168 + 48 = 520 square feet.

Questions 9 and 10 are based on the following information:
April is considering two apartments. They are of equal size except for the bedrooms. 
Bedroom A is 19 feet by 14 feet and bedroom B is 17 feet by 16 feet.
 
9. How many square feet larger is the larger bedroom?
 
(1) 9
 
(2) 8
 
(3) 7
 
(4) 6
 
(5) 5
The correct answer is Choice (4). The area of bedroom A is 19 × 14 = 266 square feet. The 
area of bedroom B is 17 × 16 = 272 square feet. Bedroom B is larger by 272 – 266 = 6 square 
feet.
 
10. April wants an area rug for the larger bedroom that would cover the floor leaving a space 
1 foot from each wall. If the rug had a fringe all the way around it, how many feet long would 
the fringe be?
 
(1) 58
 
(2) 29
 
(3) 85
 
(4) 55
 
(5) 88
The correct answer is Choice (1). The measure of the fringe is the perimeter of the rug. 
Because the rug would cover the floor 1 foot in from each wall, the length of the rug would 
be 17 – 2 = 15 feet, and the width would be 16 – 2 = 14 feet. The reason why you have to sub-
tract 2 from each measurement is that the rug would be 1 foot from each wall, resulting in a 
rug that was 2 feet shorter than the room in each dimension. Perimeter = 2(l + w), where l is 
the length and w is the width, so the perimeter of the rug = 2(15 + 14) = 2(29) = 58 feet.

Data analysis, statistics, and probabilities
To do well on the types of questions that address analyzing data, stats, and probabilities, 
you need to be able to construct, understand, and draw inferences from tables, charts, and 
graphs. You need to understand the difference between correlation and causation, and you 
need to be able to draw graphs based on the data presented and ensure that the graphs 
make sense. You also must know how to predict from data using an informal line of best fit.
For this portion of the GED, you must know how to calculate the mean, median, and mode of 
a group of data and evaluate what happens to these numbers when the data is changed. 
You also need to be able to recognize bias in statistical conclusions and make predictions 
from data produced by experiments or theoretical probabilities.
Try out the following example problems for practice with data analysis, stats, and probabilities:
Questions 1 and 2 refer to the following table.

1. From the table, which car manufacturer showed the greatest percentage increase in sales?
 
(1) Commonwealth
 
(2) Frisky
 
(3) Goodenough
 
(4) Horsesgalore
 
(5) Silkyride
The correct answer is Choice (4). The greatest percentage increase was Horsesgalore with a 
55% increase in sales.
 
2. From the table, which of the following conclusions could be drawn from the data?
 
(1) Car sales are increasing across the board.
 
(2) Car sales are decreasing across the board.
 
(3) Small manufacturers are selling more cars.
 
(4) Large manufacturers are selling more cars.
 
(5) No generalization is possible from this data.
The correct answer is Choice (5). From the data given, no generalization is possible; some 
big manufacturers have rising sales, some have falling sales. This fact eliminates the first 
four statements.

3. Alan kept track of his caloric intake, his weight, and his height for a period of five weeks. 
What conclusion can you draw from his observations?
 
(1) Eating a lot makes you taller.
 
(2) Some weeks Alan was hungrier than others.
 
(3) Eating more calories will make you gain weight.
 
(4) Eating more calories will make you taller.
 
(5) There’s no correlation between the data presented.
The correct answer is Choice (3). The more Alan ate, the heavier he became (which 
represents a possible causal relationship). The table provides no basis for the other 
answers.
 
If two values change in tune with each other, they have a correlating relationship. For 
example, there’s a positive correlation between height and age during the teenage years. In 
other words, you get taller as you get older. If one event leads to another or causes another, 
the events form a causal relationship. For example, eating all the red jellybeans alters the 
percentage of orange jellybeans in a mixture of equal numbers of each color because eating 
a red jellybean removes it from the pool of jellybeans, which originally had the same 
number of each color. As a result, the percentage of orange jellybeans increases.
 
4. Connect the following points to draw a geometric figure on the coordinate-plane grid: (3,1),

Be prepared to draw graphs from data presented, but always remember that the only way 
to draw a graph for a question on this test is to use a coordinate-plane grid, which has size 
limitations. Always be sure that your graph makes sense. If the trend is declining, the graph 
should be headed downward toward the x-axis (horizontal axis). Negative values always 
appear on the left side of the y-axis (vertical axis) or below the x-axis.

(2) People born in the colder months are taller.
 
(3) People born in March are shorter.
 
(4) People born in the warm months are similar in height.
 
(5) Two of Julio’s classmates were born in each of January and March.
The correct answer is Choice (5). The only conclusion that can be reached from such a 
small, biased sample is about the number of his classmates who were born in each month.

8. Donalda collected the information in the table as part of her research on the most popular 
flavor of ice cream. After interviewing several subjects and entering her data into the table, 
she came up with the following conclusions. Which is the most believable?
 
(1) Nobody likes chocolate ice cream.
 
(2) Nobody likes vanilla ice cream.
 
(3) Strawberry ice cream is the most popular flavor in the world.
 
(4) No conclusion is possible from this data.
 
(5) Peanut ice cream is the second most popular flavor in America.
The correct answer is Choice (4). The sample Donalda used is biased because the subjects 
are all related. A proper sample in an experiment is selected randomly. Because the data is 
from a biased sample, no conclusions can be drawn from the results.
Question 9 refers to the following table.

8.5%
11.6% 
35 to 39 years old
5.1%

9. The information in this table indicates that to reduce the chance of divorce:
 
(1) Younger women should marry older men.
 
(2) Older men should marry younger women.
 
(3) Nobody should get married.
 
(4) Fewer men get divorced than women.
 
(5) You can’t draw conclusions from this table.
The correct answer is Choice (5). This table is a compilation of statistics and reflects the 
situation as of the date the statistics were gathered. You can’t realistically draw conclusions 
from this type of data, except to state things such as, “5.1% of women aged 35 to 39 got 
divorced.” Just because someone presents you with a table of data doesn’t mean you can 
draw general conclusions from it.

Question 10 refers to the following table.

Clean-R-Up Special Series
$179.00

Super Suction 101
$568.99
 
10. Pierre is looking for a vacuum cleaner for his apartment. He is on a limited budget and 
wants to spend the least he can for his purchase. He has been told by his best friend that 
spending around the mean amount for a vacuum cleaner will get him an average unit. His 
father claims that spending about the median amount is the smartest way to get a good 
deal. Which vacuum cleaner comes the closest to satisfying both criteria?
 
(1) Hopper Model A1
 
(2) Vacuous Vacuum Company Model ZZ3
 
(3) Clean-R-Up Special Series
 
(4) Electrified Home Upright
 
(5) Super Suction 101
The correct answer is Choice (5). You can calculate the mean price by adding all the prices 
and dividing the sum by the number of prices: (249.99 + 679.99 + 179.99 + 749.99 + 568.99) ÷ 
5 = $485.79. To determine the median price, you put all the prices in order; the middle one 
is the median. In this case the median is $568.99 because it’s in the middle of the prices: 
749.99, 679.99, 568.99, 249.99, 179.99. The machine that comes closest to satisfying both 
criteria is the Super Suction 101 because its price is the same as the median. The difference 
between the price of the Super Suction 101 and the mean price is $194.20. The difference 
between the price of the Hopper Model A1 and the mean price is $235.80, leaving the Super 
Suction 101 the clear mathematical winner.
 
One thing to keep in mind is that the mathematical problems on this test aren’t always 
reflections of reality. The technique used for buying vacuum cleaners in question 10 isn’t a 
reasonable way of buying anything, but it’s a good question because it tests your knowledge 
of the mean, median, and subtraction.
Algebra, functions, and patterns
To do well in the types of questions that address algebra, functions, and patterns, you need 
to be able to draw graphs or tables, create verbal descriptions and equations to represent 
presented data, and use the same data with different forms of representation. You need to 
understand that the same function may be used in different problems. You have to know 
how to solve problems using algebraic expressions and equations and how to evaluate 
formulas. You need to understand direct and indirect variation, use them to solve problems, 
and see patterns in tables and graphs. You also need to be able to explain how a change in 
one quantity in an equation results in changes in the other quantities in the equation. 
Finally, you must be able to understand, use, and solve problems involving linear, quadratic, 
and exponential functions.

315

1. The general manager of the Wonderful World of Widgets wants to present these figures in a 
visual, easily understood way to the board of directors to help them understand the effect 
that the downturn in the economy is having on the production of widgets. What would be 
the best way to present the figures?
 
(1) a graph
 
(2) a series of tables
 
(3) verbal descriptions
 
(4) pictures of the plant exterior
 
(5) a movie of how widgets are used in America
The best answer is Choice (1). A graph is a visual representation of data; it’s easily 
understood and can be used to compare data visually. You could use some of the other 
choices to represent the data, but they would all be more complex than a graph.
 
2. Rachel and Ronda were planning for their first apartment, and they decided to split the 
required shopping tasks. Rachel was responsible for finding out how much it would cost to 
carpet their living room, and Ronda was responsible for finding out how much it would cost 
to paint the walls in the bedroom. What formula would they need to use to get an answer 
that would let them figure out the price for each job?
 
(1) P = 2(l + w)
 
(2) A = l × w
 
(3) V = l × w × d
 
(4) A = πr2
 
(5) C = πd
The correct answer is Choice (2). In each case, Rachel and Ronda have to calculate the area 
of the space they’re dealing with to get a price for the carpet and the paint. The formula for 
area is A = l × w.

3. Roger and Ekua went shopping together. Ekua spent twice as much for clothing as Roger 
did. If their total expenditure for clothing was $90.00, how much did Roger spend for clothing?
 
(1) $60.00
 
(2) $90.00
 
(3) $40.00
 
(4) $30.00
 
(5) $20.00
The correct answer is Choice (4). If you represent the amount of money Roger spent by x, 
the amount of money that Ekua spent is 2x. You can represent their spending by the 
equation 90 = x + 2x or 3x = 90, in which case x = 30. So Roger spent $30.00 for clothing.
 
4. Evaluate the following formula to 2 decimal places: 
 
 
, if a = 25 and c = 9
 
(1) 34.67
 
(2) 20.40
 
(3) 22.47
 
(4) no answer
 
(5) 27.99
The correct answer is Choice (4). You can’t find the square root of a negative number, and 
2ac will always be larger than a + c, which makes the difference of the two negative.
 
5. Solve the following equation for x:
 
 
x = 2y + 6z – y2, if y = 6 and z = 2
 
(1) 12
 
(2) 11
 
(3) –12
 
(4) –11
 
(5) none of the above
The correct answer is Choice (3). You can solve this equation by substituting 6 for y and 2 
for z, which produces this equation: 2(6) + 6(2) – 62 = –12

6. Althea has a theory about the men in her class. She has decided that the taller men have 
larger shoe sizes than the shorter men. To prove her theory, she asked several of the men 
to measure themselves and tell her their shoe sizes. From her observations, she created the 
preceding table.
 
 Using her observations, Althea decided to graph the results to see if there’s any credibility 
to her theory. Draw the point that would represent the shoe size of the median height on 
the coordinate-plane grid if the y-axis represents shoe sizes.
The grid should look like this:

As you can see from the grid, the shoe size of the median height is 6 and that is marked on 
the grid. Althea doesn’t have a proper theory (but she does have an interesting observation). 
You can see this by looking at the table but her table is of a very limited sample and thus 
proves nothing.
 
7. The students in a math class are looking at the equation A = l × w. The teacher asks what 
result doubling the length (l) would have on the area (A). What answer is correct?
 
(1) none
 
(2) makes it two times larger
 
(3) makes it four times larger
 
(4) makes it three times larger
 
(5) can’t determine the result without the value of w
The correct answer is Choice (2). In this linear equation, any multiple of one term results in 
the same multiple of the answer. Multiplying l by 2 results in multiplying A by 2.
 
As you prepare for the Mathematics Test, you definitely want to remember this rule about 
equations: Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other side.

For some extra practice for the Mathematics Test, take this short pretest. After you finish 
each question in this pretest, check your answer and read the explanation provided. The 
more you know and the more you practice, the better you’ll do on test day.
 
1. A wall is 20 feet long and 8 feet high. If all of it is to be painted with two coats of blue paint, 
how many square feet of wall have to be covered?
 
(1) 56
 
(2) 160
 
(3) 230
 
(4) 320
 
(5) 40
The correct answer is Choice (4). The area of the wall is 20 × 8 = 160 square feet. Each coat 
requires that you paint 160 square feet, but because you have to paint two coats, the 
answer is 2 × 160 = 320. If your first choice for the answer was Choice (2), you forgot about 
the second coat of paint. If you picked Choice (1), you confused perimeter with area. 
Remember that perimeter is the distance all the way around an object — in this case 
2(20 + 8) = 56. Choice (4) is the correct answer with the first two digits reversed (in other 
words, it’s a reminder to check your answers carefully!). Reversing digits under the stress 
of time limits isn’t impossible or unusual. Choice (5) is just plain wrong. You can eliminate 
this answer immediately, leaving you with four answers to consider.
 
2. Barry earns $1,730 per month after taxes. Each month, he spends $900 for rent and $600 for 
living expenses like food and utilities. How much does he have left over to buy luxuries and 
spend on entertainment?
 
(1) $170
 
(2) $230
 
(3) $390
 
(4) $320
 
(5) $180
The correct answer is Choice (2). Barry spends $900 + $600 = $1,500 for rent and living 
expenses. He has $1,730 – $1,500 = $230 left over. The other answer choices are simply 
wrong. Some of them may look correct if you don’t know how to do the question.

3. On Monday, Mary walked 12 blocks. On Tuesday, she walked 10 blocks, and, on Wednesday, 
she walked 14 blocks. If she wants to beat her average trip for those three days on 
Thursday, at least how many blocks must she walk?
 
(1) 10
 
(2) 11
 
(3) 9
 
(4) 13
 
(5) 12
The correct answer is Choice (4). Her average trip for those three days was (12 + 10 + 14) ÷ 
3 = 36 ÷ 3 = 12 blocks. To beat her average, she has to walk 13 blocks on Thursday. If she 
walks 12 blocks, she will equal (not beat) her average trip. All the other answers are less 
than her average.
 
4. Solve the following equation for x: 3x + 12 = 24
 
(1) 12
 
(2) 24
 
(3) 3
 
(4) 4
 
(5) 36
The correct answer is Choice (4). If 3x + 12 = 24, you can subtract 12 from both sides so that 
3x = 24 – 12, or 3x = 12, or x = 4. Again, remember the cardinal rule of equations: Whatever 
you do to one side, you must do to the other.
 
5. Where are all the points with an x-coordinate of –4 located on a graph?
 
(1) 4 units above the x-axis
 
(2) 4 units to the left of the x-axis
 
(3) 4 units from the y-axis
 
(4) 4 units above the y-axis
 
(5) 4 units to the left of the y-axis
The correct answer is Choice (5). All points with x-coordinates that are negative are located 
to the left of the y-axis (the vertical axis). Therefore, if a point has an x-coordinate of –4, it’s 
located on a line 4 units to the left of the y-axis.
Revealing Some Helpful Pointers
As you prepare for the Mathematics Test, do the following:
 
✓ Master arithmetic fundamentals. About half the test depends on basic arithmetic 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimals, and fractions). The better you 
know the fundamentals, the better you can do on this test.
 
✓ Understand how to solve problems. To get a handle on how to solve basic mathematical 
problems, do a lot of practice problems before the test. The more problems you solve, 
the more natural solving problems will become. Borrow or buy as many math books as 
you can, and use the sample questions in them to develop your problem-solving skills.

Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
(Be sure to get one that has answers in the back so you can check your work.) Check 
every answer immediately after you work the question. If you answered it incorrectly, 
figure out why. If you can’t answer it, ask someone to explain the solution to you.
 
✓ Understand the rules of math. Textbooks are full of rules, theorems, hypotheses, and 
so on. Read over as many of these rules as you can, and try to explain the main ones to 
a friend. If you can explain a particular rule (the Pythagorean theorem, for example) to 
a friend and he or she understands it, you’ve mastered the rule. If you can’t explain it, 
ask someone to help you better understand the rule.
 
✓ Take practice tests. See Chapters 25 and 27 for two full-length practice tests. If two 
aren’t enough, buy or borrow additional test-prep books that include sample 
Mathematics Tests. Be strict about time constraints. After checking your answers, 
figure out why you missed the problems and correct your mistakes.
 
 The only part of the test you can’t duplicate is the feeling of sitting in the examination 
room just before you start the test. But the more practice tests you take, the more 
comfortable you’ll be when test day finally arrives.

Chapter 25
Practice Test — Mathematics Test: 
Parts I and II
T
he Mathematics Test consists of multiple-choice and alternate-format questions 
intended to measure general mathematics skills and problem-solving ability. The ques-
tions are based on short readings that often include a graph, chart, or figure.
Like the Language Arts, Writing Test, the Mathematics Test is made up of two parts. Part I 
allows you to use a calculator to help you answer the questions; Part II doesn’t. Each part 
consists of 25 questions.
You have 45 minutes to complete each part. Work carefully, but do not spend too much 
time on any one question. Be sure to answer every question.
Formulas you may need are given on the page before the first test question in each part. 
Only some of the questions will require you to use a formula. Not all the formulas given will 
be needed.
Some questions contain more information than you will need to solve the problem; other 
questions do not give enough information. If the question does not give enough information 
to solve the problem, the correct answer choice is “not enough information given.”
Note: The GED test administrator will collect your calculator when you finish Part I of the 
Mathematics Test. After you turn in your calculator and the administrator tells you to begin 
Part II, you can move on to that part.

Mathematics Test: Part I
The use of calculators is allowed in Part I only.
Do not write in this test booklet. The test administrator will give you a blank paper for your 
calculations. Record your answers on the separate answer sheet provided. Be sure all infor-
mation is properly recorded on the answer sheet.
To record your answers, fill in the numbered circle on the answer sheet that corresponds to 
the answer you select for each question in the test booklet.
  
EXAMPLE:
If a grocery bill totaling $15.75 is paid with a $20.00 bill, how much change should be
returned?
(1)  $5.25
(2)  $4.75
(3)  $4.25
(4)  $3.75
(5)  $3.25
The correct answer is “$4.25”; therefore, answer space 3 would be marked on the

 Chapter 25: Practice Test — Mathematics Test: Parts I and II
The Standard Grid
Mixed numbers, such as 31⁄2, cannot be entered in the standard grid. Instead, represent them 
as decimal numbers (in this case, 3.5) or fractions (in this case, 7⁄2). In addition, no answer 
on a standard grid can be a negative number, such as –8.
To record your answer for a standard-grid question
 
✓ Begin in any column that will allow your answer to be entered.
 
✓ Write your answer in the boxes on the top row.
 
✓ In the column beneath a fraction bar or decimal point (if any) and each number in your 
answer, fill in the circle representing that character.
 
✓ Leave blank any unused column.
EXAMPLE:
The scale on a map indicates that 1⁄2 inch represents an actual distance of 120 miles. In inches, how 
far apart on the map will the two towns be if the actual distance between them is 180 miles?
The answer to the above example is 3⁄4, or 0.75 inch. A few examples of how the answer could be 
gridded are shown below.

Points to remember:
 
✓ The answer sheet will be machine scored. The circles must be filled in correctly.
 
✓ Mark no more than one circle in any column.
 
✓ Grid only one answer even if there is more than one correct answer.
 
✓ Mixed numbers, such as 31⁄2, must be gridded as 3.5 or 7⁄2.
 
✓ No answer on a standard grid can be a negative number.

The Coordinate-Plane Grid
To record an answer on the coordinate-plane 
grid, you must have an x-value and a y-value. No 
answer for a coordinate-plane question will have 
a value that is a fraction or decimal.
Mark only the one circle that represents your 
answer.

their house. They have some interesting 
ideas. They want to put a rug on the floor 
surrounded by a border of tiles. They are 
considering teak paneling halfway up each

The rug costs $7.50 a square foot, and tile 
costs $9.00 a square foot. One rug they like 
is 16 feet by 10 feet, leaving just a little area 
around the rug for tiles. At the store, how-
ever, they see another rug that is only 12 
feet by 8 feet, but it’s just the right pattern 
and colors for their room. Which floor 
treatment is less expensive?

Points to remember:
 
✓ The answer sheet will be machine scored. The circles must be filled in correctly.
 
✓ Mark no more than one circle in any column.
 
✓ Grid only one answer even if there is more than one correct answer.
 
✓ Mixed numbers, such as 31⁄2, must be gridded as 3.5 or 7⁄2.
 
✓ No answer on a standard grid can be a negative number.
The Standard Grid
Mixed numbers, such as 31⁄2, cannot be entered in the standard grid. Instead, represent them 
as decimal numbers (in this case, 3.5) or fractions (in this case, 7⁄2). No answer on a standard 
grid can be a negative number, such as –8.
To record your answer for a standard-grid question
 
✓ Begin in any column that will allow your answer to be entered.
 
✓ Write your answer in the boxes on the top row.
 
✓ In the column beneath a fraction bar or decimal point (if any) and each number in your 
answer, fill in the circle representing that character.
 
✓ Leave blank any unused column.
EXAMPLE:
The scale on a map indicates that 1⁄2 inch represents an actual distance of 120 miles. In inches, how 
far apart on the map will the two towns be if the actual distance between them is 180 miles?
The answer to the above example is 3⁄4, or 0.75 inch. A few examples of how the answer could be 
gridded are shown below.

Answers and Explanations 
for the Mathematics Test
A
fter taking the Mathematics Test in Chapter 25, use this chapter to check your 
answers. Take your time as you move through the explanations of the answers for 
Parts I and II that we provide in the first two sections. They can help you understand why 
you missed the answers you did. You may also want to read the explanations for the ques-
tions you answered correctly because doing so can give you a better understanding of the 
thought process that helped you choose the correct answers.
If you’re short on time, turn to the end of the chapter for abbreviated answer keys for Parts 
I and II of the Mathematics Test.
Analysis of the Answers for Part I
Note: In all the following explanations, the answers given are the ones that would be read 
from the display on the calculator if the correct numbers were entered. Calculators always 
calculate to the maximum number of digits possible on their display. It is up to the person 
operating the calculator to either set the number of decimal places, if possible, or to make 
sense of the answer.
 
1. 3. This problem tests your understanding of numbers and their equivalents (integers, frac-
tions, decimals, and percents) in a real-world situation. Signs A, B, and C give customers 
50% off. Sign D gives them 45% (9 × 5% sales tax). Sign D offers the least discount.
 
2. 1. This problem involves measurement and geometry and tests your understanding of per-
pendicular and parallel lines in a geometrical figure. Frames are rectangles. Each pair of 
opposite sides must be parallel for this to be a rectangle.
 
3. 1680 on standard grid. This problem tests your knowledge and mastery of number opera-
tions and number sense. Use the calculator because numerous conversions are involved, 
including the following:
 
  
Area of the deck is 16 × 21 = 336 square feet
 
  
9 square feet = 1 square yard
 
  
336⁄9 = 371⁄3 square yards
 
  
1 square yard of decking costs $45.00
 
  
371⁄3 square yards of decking costs $1,680.00
 
4. 2. This problem tests your data-analysis skills. You’re asked to interpret and draw infer-
ences from the bar graph. Because the profit per unit is the same for all products, the 
product selling the least units provides the lowest profit. In each quarter, according to the 
bar graph, grommets sold the fewest numbers. Grommets were the least profitable prod-
uct and, therefore, are recommended as the one to drop.

5. 5. This problem tests your skills in measurement and geometry. You’re asked to use the 
Pythagorean relationship to calculate a distance. This is a good question on which to use 
the calculator because it involves squaring, adding, and calculating the square root.
 
 The Pythagorean relationship says that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled trian-
gle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. (You may remember this term 
being called the Pythagorean theorem.) The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle.
 
 To help you figure out this problem, draw a sketch that looks something like this:
6 feet
7 feet
x
 
 In the sketch, x represents the length of the hypotenuse. Thanks to the Pythagorean rela-
tionship, which you’re given on the formula sheet of the Mathematics Test, you know that 
the square of x is equal to the square of 6 plus the square of 7, or
 
  
62 + 72 = x2
 
  
36 + 49 = 85
 
  
Then x2 = 85
 
  
x = 9.22
 
 The length of the stairs is 9.22 feet, rounded to two decimal places.
 
6. 1. Alice has converted her story into a graph, and you’re being asked to interpret the line 
graph in conjunction with her story. Because her average daily time had been increasing 
until May, dropped in June, and recovered in July and August, you can assume that the 
twisted ankle slowed her down. It likely happened in June.
 
7. 4. Number operations are involved in solving this problem. You’re asked to average a set 
of grades for each person and compare them using a ratio. You can simplify this question 
using the calculator.
 
 The total of Paula’s marks is 80 + 64 + 76 + 72 + 88 = 380.
 
 The total of Dominic’s marks is 63 + 76 + 65 + 84 + 72 = 360.
 
 Because you divide each total by 5 to get the averages for Paula and Dominic, you can 
simply use the ratio of the totals to get the answer because it will equal the ratio of the 
averages. (Note that if one of the students had six grades and the other had five, for exam-
ple, you’d have to use the ratio of the averages, not of the totals.)
 
 The ratio of Paula’s marks to Dominic’s marks is 380:360, which you can simplify by divid-
ing top and bottom by 20 to get 19:18. Note that Choice (2) is the ratio of Dominic’s marks 
to Paula’s marks, but that’s not what the question asked for.
 
8. 66 on standard grid. This problem involves algebra, functions, and patterns. The numbers 
4, 6, 10, 18, . . . form a pattern (also called a series). After looking carefully at the series, you 
see that the second term is formed by subtracting 1 from the first term and multiplying by 
2. Try this on the third number: (6 – 1) × 2 = 10. You’ve found your pattern. Continuing the 
series: 4, 6, 10, 18, 34, 66, . . . , the first term you come to that is a multiple of 11 is 66.

9. 3. This problem involves data analysis and manipulation of numbers and is best done 
using the calculator. Most of the information given is irrelevant, except to decide that 
Simone may have bought at a high point. The important price to consider is $15.19. In addi-
tion to this price per share, Simone has to pay her broker 3% commission.
 
 Therefore, her final price per share on September 24 is $15.19 + $.03(15.19) = $15.6457. 
Because you’re dealing with money, you have to round the number to two decimal places, 
making her final price per share $15.65. This amount of money came out of her bank 
account for each share she bought.
 
 If she decides to sell the shares at this price, $15.65, she has to pay her broker another 3% 
commission, or $.03(15.65) = $0.4695. Rounded to two decimals, she has to pay a commis-
sion of $0.47 per share. She then receives the value of the shares, $15.65, minus the com-
mission of $0.47, for a total of $15.18 per share. That is, for each share she sells, the broker 
deposits $15.18 into her account. Notice that this amount is less than the amount she paid 
for each share.
 
 In order to break even, Simone has to receive $15.65 per share — after the commission. Set 
the equation up this way:
 
  
1x – x(0.03) = 15.65, where x is the selling price
 
  
1x – 0.03x = 15.65, where x is the selling price
 
  
0.97x = 15.65
 
 Now divide both sides by 0.97 and x = 16.13.
 
10. 4. This question involves algebra. You have to solve a linear equation, as follows:
 
  
 
 Cross-multiply and write this equation as 22.4(5a + 10) = 56a
 
 Getting rid of the parentheses, the equation looks like this: 112a + 224 = 56a
 
 Bringing all the as to the left and the numbers to the right, you have: 112a – 56a = –224
 
 Combining the as, you have: 56a = –224
 
 Divide both sides by 56 to get one a on the left: a = –4
 
11. 1. This question tests your skills in measurement and geometry. You’re asked to find the 
slope of a line drawn for you.
 
 The x-axis runs horizontally across the paper. The y-axis runs vertically, up and down the 
paper. The origin is where the two axes (that’s the plural of axis) intersect. Points to the 
left of the y-axis have negative x-values. Points below the x-axis have negative y-values. The 
x-intercept of a line is the point where the line cuts the x-axis. The y-intercept of a line is the 
point where the line cuts the y-axis. All lines parallel to the x-axis have slopes of 0.
 
 The slope of a line is the rise over the run. The rise is 4 and the run is 6. This means that 
the slope is 4⁄6 or 2⁄3 (divide top and bottom by 2 to simplify).
 
12. (–6,0) on coordinate-plane grid. This question tests your skills in measurement and geom-
etry. You’re asked to identify the x-intercept and the y-intercept and to draw a line with a 
slope of 2⁄3 on the coordinate-plane grid.
 
 If you draw a line through the point on the y-axis having the same slope, it crosses the 
x-axis at (–6,0). Simply count over 3 points to the left (the run), down 2 (the rise), and 
you’re at (–3,2). But you’re asked for the x-intercept, so repeat this process. Go over 3 
more points to the left and down 2 more, and you’re at (–6,0).
 
13. 5. This question doesn’t provide enough information for you to give an accurate answer. 
If the fire were rectangular in shape, the answer would be different from a circular fire, or 
an irregularly shaped fire. The question provides information only about the shape of the 
barbeque.

14. 4. Consider the price per square foot at each store:
 
  
Carnie’s Carpets: $21.50 per square yard = $21.50 ÷ 9 = $2.39 per square foot
 
  
Flora’s Flooring: $2.45 per square foot
 
  
 Dora’s Deep Discount: The area of an 8-by-12 foot rug is 8 × 12 = 96 square feet. The 
cost for 96 square feet is $210.24 or $210.24 ÷ 96 = $2.19 per square foot.
 
15. 1. In this question, you’re asked to analyze graphs to identify patterns in a workplace 
situation.
 
 In the first graph for 2007, the third quarter produces about half the output for the year. In 
the second graph, the third quarter of 2008 produces only a little over 30% of the output. 
The best answer for this question is the third quarter.
 
16. 4. This problem involves measurement, specifically, area and money. Assuming that the 
estimate for renovation is accurate, the number of square feet of renovation that the Ngs 
can afford for $18,000 is $18,000 ÷ 15.80 square feet = 1,139.24 square feet. Round this 
number to 1,140 because you usually don’t add part of a square foot.
 
17. (6,6) on coordinate-plane grid. This problem involves data analysis, statistics, and proba-
bility. You’re being asked to graph a point representing the medians of two sets of data. 
First, find the median (the middle number, when put in order) of the first set of numbers. 
The median is 6. Then find the median of the second set of numbers. Again, it is 6.
 
 Neatness doesn’t count in your rough work. Don’t spend time making beautiful tables on 
your scratch paper. Just sketch out the answer.
 
18. 2. This problem is based on measurement using uniform rates, and it asks you to make a

 From these figures, you can see that the sedan is the best buy.
 
19. 3. This problem involves number operations. Instead of asking you for the answer, which 
is pretty simple, you’re asked to provide the operations that are required to solve the 
problem. First, you divide (miles to site ÷ miles per hour), and then you add (the amount 
of time Tom wants to arrive early).
 
20. 5. This question involves data analysis. You’re asked to apply measures of central ten-
dency (the mean) and analyze the effect of changes in data on this measure. If Leonora’s 
present average is 77.8% and she wants to get an average of 80%, she needs enough marks 
to get an additional 2.2% (80 – 77.8).

 Because she is taking five subjects, she requires 5 extra points for each percent increase. 
Thus, she requires 2.2 × 5 = 11 additional points. The problem says that English is her best 
subject, so she would need the 11 extra points in English.
 
21. 1. This question tests your ability to figure out how a change in the amount of rice used 
results in changes to the amount of soup and lentils needed.
 
 Because each cup of rice requires 2 cups of soup, 31⁄2 cups of rice require 2 × 31⁄2 = 7 cups 
of soup.
 
 Because each cup of rice requires 1⁄4 cup of lentils, 31⁄2 cups of rice require 31⁄2 × 1⁄4 = 7⁄2 × 1⁄4 = 7⁄8 
cup of lentils.
 
22. 4. This question is a test in probability. You’re asked to figure out the probability of an 
event occurring. If you had an entire deck of 52 cards, the probability of drawing an ace of 
hearts would be 1:52. If you remove 6 cards and none of them is the ace of hearts, you may 
as well have a 46-card deck (52 – 6). The probability of drawing an ace of hearts from a 
46-card deck is 1:46.
 
23. 2. This problem tests your measurement skills. You’re asked to predict the impact of changes 
in the linear dimensions of the rug on its area and cost. Choice (3) seems logical, but the ques-
tion never mentions the cost of the paneling, so you can’t consider it as an answer.
 
 Draw a sketch of the room with the larger rug. It will have a tiled area around it. You have to 
figure out how many square feet of tile and carpet you need for this floor treatment, as follows:
 
  
The area of the room is 18 × 12 = 216 square feet.
 
 The larger rug will cover 16 × 10 = 160 square feet of the floor. This leaves 56 square feet 
(216 – 160) to be covered with tile. The cost of the rug is $7.50 × 160 = $1,200. The cost of 
the tile is $9.00 × 56 = $504.00. The total cost is $1,200.00 + $504.00 = $1,704.00.
 
 The smaller rug will cover 12 × 8 = 96 square feet of the floor. This leaves 216 – 96 = 120 
square feet to be covered with tile. The cost of the rug is $7.50 × 96 = $720.00. The cost of 
the tile is $9.00 × 120 = $1,080.00. The total cost is $720.00 + $1,080.00 = $1,800.00. The 
smaller rug will cost more for the entire floor treatment.
 
 Tile costs more per square foot than carpeting, so you know without doing any figuring 
that having more tile will result in higher costs.
 
24. 3. This question is an exercise in data analysis. You’re asked to compare sets of data based 
on the mean (average) prices of four other stores. You can summarize the average prices 
on a sketch table like this one:
Item

 You can see that the only item Friendly Furniture sells for over the average price is the 
loveseat, which is the answer to the question.
 
25. 320 on standard grid. This question tests your knowledge of number operations by asking 
you to solve a problem involving calculations. Sarah ate 48 ÷ 18 pistachios per minute. In 
 
 2 hours or 120 minutes, she could eat 
.

352
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
Analysis of the Answers for Part II
 
1. 1. This question is about number operations; it asks you to select the appropriate opera-
tion to solve a problem. Because the first operation performed is to find the volume of the 
room, and the formula for volume is length × width × height, the first operation you use to 
solve the problem is multiplication.
 
2. 5. This question tests your knowledge of measurement and geometry. You’re asked to 
visualize and describe geometrical figures under a 90-degree rotation. Each of the figures is 
changed by the rotation. Try drawing each of these shapes, picking a point on the perime-
ter and rotating it 90 degrees. Because this is a timed test, try drawing one or two, noticing 
that they change quite a bit. Use your imagination to check the rest. After discovering that 
none of the four shapes has the same relationship to the horizontal after a 90-degree rota-
tion about a point on its perimeter, you have your answer — not enough information given.
 
3. 1. This question tests your data-analysis skills by asking you to interpret a chart and 
answer a question involving calculation.
 
 The largest budget is the Operations budget, while the smallest budget is Human Resources. 
The ratio between these two budgets is 14.7 to 2.1 or 7:1 (dividing both sides by 2.1).
 
 If you wanted to do this in your head, notice that 14:2 (the approximate ratio between the 
Operations budget and the Human Resources budget) is double 7:1.
 
4. 5. This question tests your knowledge of patterns by asking you to compare different 
graphs to extract information. Graph 5 has the first and third quarters in the required ratio.
 
5. 5. This problem involves measurement and geometry, and it asks you to use the 
Pythagorean relationship to solve a problem.
 
 You can’t actually solve this problem, however. Because the rangefinder is measuring the 
distance from the forester’s eye and you don’t know how high his eye is above the ground, 
you can’t calculate the height of the tree. You can calculate the distance from the forest-
er’s eye to the top of the tree by using the Pythagorean relationship, but the question asks 
for the height of the tree (which is the distance from the ground — not the forester’s eye — 
to the top of the tree). Thus, you don’t have enough information.
 
6. 4. This question tests your knowledge of number operations by asking you to perform sev-
eral operations to calculate an answer. After the fourth week, Lawrie would’ve deposited 
4 × $24.00 = $96.00. There would’ve been two withdrawals totaling $7.50 + $10.00 = $17.50. 
Her balance after the fourth week would be $96.00 – $17.50 = $78.50.
 
7. 3.20 on standard grid. This question tests your skills in using percentages and discounts. 
Store A offers Sarah 1⁄3 off or 96 ÷ 3 = $32.00 off the original price. Store B offers her 30% off. 
30% is 0.30, so she’ll get 96 × 0.30 = $28.80 off the original price. By buying at store A, she’d 
get the chair for $32.00 – $28.80 = $3.20 less. Thus, she’d save $3.20.
 
8. 4. This question tests your skills by asking you to use information from a graph to solve a 
problem. From the graph, you can figure out that the volume in decibels is the square of 
the volume setting. For a volume setting of 4, the volume is 16 decibels. Therefore, for a 
setting of 10, the volume is 100 decibels (102).
 
9. 5. This question tests your skills in algebra by asking you to solve equations. The equation 
given is V = S2. If S2 = 144, the square root of 144 is 12. Thus, the answer is 12.
 
10. 2. If the volume decreases by half for every 10 feet away from the stage you get and the 
volume at the stage is 144 decibels, a person sitting 10 feet from the stage would hear at 
a volume of 72 decibels (144 ÷ 2), and a person sitting 20 feet from the stage would hear 
at a volume of 36 decibels (72 ÷ 2).
 
11. 12 on standard grid. This question involves number operations. You’re asked to calculate 
the average miles per gallon for a vehicle. Rather than provide you with the number of gal-
lons used, you’re given the cost of gasoline and the cost of the 240-mile trip. To calculate 

353
 Chapter 26: Answers and Explanations for the Mathematics Test
the amount of fuel used, you divide $54.00 by $2.70 to get 20 gallons. You can do this oper-
ation mentally to speed things up. Next, you divide the miles, 240, by the fuel used, 20 gal-
lons, to get the mileage, 12 miles per gallon (240 ÷ 20 = 12).
 
12. 5. This question tests your skills in measurement and geometry. To remain at a constant 
temperature, you have to remain at a constant distance from the fire.
 
 The path of a point that travels a constant distance from a point is a circle.
 
13. 4.48 on standard grid. This problem tests your ability to do calculations and use a for-
mula: Volume = length × width × depth. Thus, 12,902 cubic feet = 120 feet × 24 feet × average 
 
 depth. The average depth 
 (the answer is rounded).
 
14. 5. This question tests your ability to make a decision based on data presented in a table 
and then to use that information to answer a question. The least economical car costs 
$1,823 to drive for a year, while the most economical car costs $840 for the same time 
under the same conditions. The difference in cost for one year is $1,823 – $840 = $983. The 
cost for three years is $983 × 3 = $2,949.
 
15. 1. This question tests your ability to analyze data using the mean and median to answer a 
question about the data given. The mean of the city mileages is the sum of the mileages 
divided by 10 (the number of entries), which equals 16.8. The median of the mileages is the 
one midway between the two in the middle, or 16.5. The difference between the two num-
bers (16.8 – 16.5) is 1⁄3 (or 0.3).
 
16. (0,5) on coordinate-plane grid. This question tests your ability to analyze data by repre-
senting data graphically.
 
 For Vehicle A, the difference between the city and highway mileage is 5 mpg (28 – 23). The 
point you want on the y-axis is (0,5), which you need to mark on the coordinate-plane grid.
 
17. 5. This question tests your skill in algebra by asking you to solve a system of linear equations:
 
  
2x + 3y = 10
 
  
5x + 6y = 13
 
 Remember that a linear equation is one in which the powers of the variables are all equal 
to 1. To solve this system, you have to eliminate x by multiplying each equation by a 
number that allows you to subtract one from the other and end up with just ys. Multiply 
the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2:
 
  
5(2x + 3y = 10) = 10x + 15y = 50
 
  
2(5x + 6y = 13) = 10x + 12y = 26
 
 Subtract the second equation from the first, and you get 3y = 24; y = 8. (Note that you can 
also multiply the second equation by –2 and add the two equations together. Either way 
gets you the same answer.)
 
18. 2. This question asks you to analyze a situation presented in a table. The table tells you 
that the country with the highest participation rate is the United States, with a participa-
tion rate of 66.4. The country with the lowest participation rate is Portugal, with a partici-
pation rate of 15.5. Because you’re asked for an approximation, you can say that the 
participation rate in the United States is 60 and in Portugal is 15, which means that 4 times 
as many adults participate in adult education in the United States than in Portugal.
 
19. 4. This problem involves number operations. The total amount of Gordon’s bills is $23.00 + 
$31.00 + $48.00 + $13.00 + $114.00 + $39.00 = $268.00. If Gordon allocates only $250.00 to 
pay these bills, he ends up $268.00 – $250.00 = $18.00 short. Be wary of Choice (2), which is 
a special trap for people who don’t read the question carefully.
 
20. 12 on standard grid. This question tests your ability to use the Pythagorean relationship 
to solve a problem.

354
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 If the hypotenuse is 15 feet and the vertical height is 9 feet, the square of the third side is 
equal to 152 – 92, which equals 225 – 81, which equals 144. The square root of 144 is 12, so 
12 is your answer.
 
21. 5. This problem tests your knowledge of measurement and geometry by asking you to 
solve a problem involving volume and weight. You can do this problem in your head, but 
we take you through the steps using calculations first.
 
 The formula for volume of a cylinder (the cylinder is the circular inside of the pool to a 
height of 9 inches) is π × r2 × h, where π = approximately 3.14, r = radius, and h = height. If 
the diameter is 12 feet, the radius is 6 feet. If the height is 9 inches, it’s 9⁄12 feet, which can 
be simplified to 3⁄4 feet.
 
 In a formula, don’t forget that all units must be the same; that is, feet and feet or inches 
and inches.
 
 The volume is (3.14)(6 × 6)(3⁄4) = 85.59 cubic feet.
 
 Because 1 cubic foot weighs 62.42 pounds, the weight of 85.59 cubic feet is 85.59 × 62.42 = 
5,343 or 5,300 rounded to the nearest hundred.
 
 To do this problem in your head, multiply 6 × 6 to get 36. Multiply 36 by 3⁄4 to get 27, and 
multiply 27 by 3 to get 81. The approximate volume of the pool is 81 cubic feet, which isn’t 
bad for an approximation. For your purposes, say the volume is 80 cubic feet, which is still 
close. The weight of a cubic foot of water is 62.42 pounds, so round it to 60 pounds. Now, 
multiply 80 by 60 to get 4,800, which is closest to Choice (5). You can go with that approxi-
mation because it’s very close to one of the answers.
 
22. 1. This question tests your ability to evaluate an answer using a formula. This formula, 
I = p × r × t isn’t in the format you want because you want to calculate the rate, which 
 
 means solving for r. You can change the equation to 
, which allows you to calculate 
 
 the rate from the information given. Substituting into this equation, you get 
. 
 
 (Remember that 1 year and 3 months is 11⁄4 or 1.25 of a year.)
 
 Then 
.
 
23. 3. This question involves number operations. You’re asked to calculate — in your head — 
the answer to a problem.
 
 To use mental math to solve this problem, round everything. Consider the apples at $.80 a 
pound, bananas at $.20 each, milk at $1.30, and a loaf of bread at $1.00. The total for this 
approximation is (2 × $.80) + (5 × $.20) + $1.30 + $1.00 = $4.90. Looking at the answer 
choices, Choice (3) is the only one close to this approximation.
 
24. 1. This question tests your knowledge of patterns by asking you to figure out the next 
number in a series. By looking at the series, it looks like each number is the square of the 
placement of the number in the list, plus 3. That is, the first number is 12 plus 3, or 4. The 
second number is 22 plus 3, or 7. The third term is 32 (or 9) plus 3, or 12. The fifth term 
would be 52 (or 25) plus 3, which is 28.
 
25. 3. This question tests your skills in geometry by asking you to visualize a graph of an 
object. Because the object is a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal in length and are 
parallel, the fourth corner will be 2 units to the left of the y-axis, giving it an x-coordinate 
of –2, and 2 units below the x-axis, giving it a y-coordinate of –2. Therefore, the point would 
be (–2,–2).
 
 The x-coordinate is the distance from the y-axis, and the y-coordinate is the distance from 
the x-axis.

Another Practice Test — Mathematics 
Test: Parts I and II
T
he Mathematics Test consists of multiple-choice and alternate-format questions 
intended to measure general mathematics skills and problem-solving ability. The ques-
tions are based on short readings that often include a graph, chart, or figure.
Like the Language Arts, Writing Test, the Mathematics Test is made up of two parts. Part I 
allows you to use a calculator to help you answer the questions; Part II doesn’t. Each part 
consists of 25 questions.
You have 45 minutes to complete each part. Work carefully, but do not spend too much 
time on any one question. Be sure to answer every question.
Formulas you may need are given on the page before the first test question in each part. 
Only some of the questions will require you to use a formula. Not all the formulas given will 
be needed.
Some questions contain more information than you will need to solve the problem; other 
questions do not give enough information. If the question does not give enough information 
to solve the problem, the correct answer choice is “not enough information given.”
Note: The GED test administrator will collect your calculator when you finish Part I of the 
Mathematics Test. After you turn in your calculator and the administrator tells you to begin 
Part II, you can move on to that part.

 Chapter 27: Another Practice Test — Mathematics Test: Parts I and II
The Standard Grid
Mixed numbers, such as 31⁄2, cannot be entered in the standard grid. Instead, represent them 
as decimal numbers (in this case, 3.5) or fractions (in this case, 7⁄2). In addition, no answer 
on a standard grid can be a negative number, such as –8.
To record your answer for a standard-grid question
 
✓ Begin in any column that will allow your answer to be entered.
 
✓ Write your answer in the boxes on the top row.
 
✓ In the column beneath a fraction bar or decimal point (if any) and each number in your 
answer, fill in the circle representing that character.
 
✓ Leave blank any unused column.
EXAMPLE:
The scale on a map indicates that 1⁄2 inch represents an actual distance of 120 miles. In inches, how 
far apart on the map will the two towns be if the actual distance between them is 180 miles?
The answer to the above example is 3⁄4, or 0.75 inch. A few examples of how the answer could be 
gridded are shown below.

mation is properly recorded on the answer sheet.
To record your answers, fill in the numbered circle on the answer sheet that corresponds to 
the answer you select for each question in the test booklet.
EXAMPLE:
If a grocery bill totaling $15.75 is paid with a $20.00 bill, how much change should be
returned?
(1)  $5.25
(2)  $4.75
(3)  $4.25
(4)  $3.75
(5)  $3.25
The correct answer is “$4.25”; therefore, answer space 3 would be marked on the
answer sheet.

Do not rest the point of your pencil on the answer sheet while you are considering your 
answer. Make no stray or unnecessary marks. If you change an answer, erase your first 
mark completely. Mark only one answer space for each question; multiple answers will be 
scored as incorrect. Do not fold or crease your answer sheet. All test materials must be 
returned to the test administrator.
If you finish Part II early, you may return to Part I, but without the calculator.

The Standard Grid
Mixed numbers, such as 31⁄2, cannot be entered in the standard grid. Instead, represent them 
as decimal numbers (in this case, 3.5) or fractions (in this case, 7⁄2). No answer on a standard 
grid can be a negative number, such as –8.
To record your answer for a standard-grid question
 
✓ Begin in any column that will allow your answer to be entered.
 
✓ Write your answer in the boxes on the top row.
 
✓ In the column beneath a fraction bar or decimal point (if any) and each number in your 
answer, fill in the circle representing that character.
 
✓ Leave blank any unused column.
EXAMPLE:
The scale on a map indicates that 1⁄2 inch represents an actual distance of 120 miles. In inches, how 
far apart on the map will the two towns be if the actual distance between them is 180 miles?
The answer to the above example is 3⁄4, or 0.75 inch. A few examples of how the answer could be 
gridded are shown below.

operating the calculator to either set the number of decimal places, if possible, or to make 
sense of the answer.
 
1. 3. In this question, you’re given more information than you need. You’re given the dimen-
sions of every room in the apartment, but Singh doesn’t want to carpet all of them. 
Because you can use the calculator in this part of the test, you can calculate an accurate 
answer. The first thing to do is calculate the area of each of the rooms Singh wants to 
carpet.
 
 Area = length × width, and the length and width must be in the same units.
 
 Here are the areas you come up with:
 
  
Living room: 19.49 × 10.00 = 194.90
 
  
Dining room: 9.71 × 8.01 = 77.7771
 
  
Master bedroom: 13.78 × 12.40 = 170.872
 
 The calculator doesn’t put a zero at the end of a number, so the area of the master bed-
room has one fewer decimal point than the others, but that’s okay.
 
 Next, you have to total the areas: 194.9 + 77.7771 + 170.872 = 443.5491.
 
 Because the lengths and widths are in feet, the answer is in square feet, BUT the cost of 
the carpet is in square yards. To convert square feet into square yards, you divide by 9: 
443.5491 ÷ 9 = 49.283233, which is the area in square yards.
 
 You don’t need all these decimal places, but because they’re already entered into the cal-
culator, you can keep them.

Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 The carpet budget was for $35.00 a square yard, so you have to multiply the total area 
Singh wants to carpet by the cost per square yard: 49.283233 × 35.00 = 1724.9131.
 
 You need an answer in dollars and cents, so you have to round to two decimal points. 
(The third decimal integer is 2, so you need to round down.) Therefore, the budget for the 
carpet is $1,724.91 — Choice (3).
 
 This isn’t a good question for guessing because you can’t logically eliminate any of the 
answers without doing the calculations.
 
2. 0.6 (on standard grid). To convert yards into miles, you have to divide the number of 
yards you want to convert into miles by 1,760 (because one mile equals 1,760 yards). 1,000 
yards is about 0.57 miles (1,000 ÷ 1,760 = 0.568181818). Odometers usually read to one dec-
imal point, so Sarah should drive about 0.6 miles, rounded up because the second decimal 
place is larger than 5, which would be just past the restaurant.
 
3. 5. The circular carpet has a diameter of 7 feet 8 inches, and it has a 2-inch fringe all the 
way around it. To calculate the diameter that will be covered by the backing, you have to 
subtract the width of the fringe (which you get by multiplying 2 inches by 2 because the 
fringe adds 2 inches to both sides of the circle):
 
  
7 feet 8 inches – 4 inches = 7 feet 4 inches
 
 Because the units must be the same to calculate the area, you need to convert the diame-
ter into inches: 7 feet 4 inches = 7 × 12 + 4 = 88 inches.
 
 The diameter is twice the radius, thus the radius of the covered area = 88⁄2 = 44 inches.
 
 Now you can use the formula for the area of a circle given on the formula page, A = π × r2, 
where π is approximately 3.14. Thus, the area is 3.14 × 44 × 44 = 6,079.04 square inches.
 
 Because the question asks for an answer in square feet, you have to convert square inches 
to square feet by dividing by 144 (12 inches = 1 foot; 122 = 144):
 
  
6,079.04 ÷ 144 = 42.215555 or 42.2, rounded to one decimal place.
 
 Choice (4) is what you would’ve calculated if you forgot to subtract the fringe, and Choice 
(1) is the result of using the diameter in the formula rather than the radius. Choice (2) is 
the result of not reading the question carefully; it’s close, but it has two decimal places.
 
4. 2. This question tests your skills in geometry by asking you to calculate the lengths of 
sides of a triangle when given the vertices (corners of a triangle).
 
 The length of the line joining the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is 
. Thus, 
 
 when you substitute the three points of the triangle into this equation, you get the follow-
ing lengths of AB, BC, and CA (or AC):
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 From these lengths, you can see that the longest side of the triangle is BC.
 
 If you sketch out a graph and locate the points of this triangle, BC is obviously the longest 
side. Sketching could save you a lot of time calculating when the answer is this obvious, so 
try sketching first.
 
5. 4. This question asks you to draw an inference from a graph. Looking carefully at the 
graph, Coin B in the first set comes closest to 50%, which is the theoretical chance of a 
head or tail landing when the coin is balanced.

6. 9.0 (on standard grid). The shape of an ice cream cone is a cone, and the volume of a 
cone = 1⁄3 × π × radius2 × height, where π is approximately equal to 3.14 (this equation 
appears on the formula sheet given to you on the test).
 
 To make the calculations simpler using the calculator, change the fractions to decimals:
 
  
21⁄2 = 2.5, 51⁄2 = 5.5, and 1⁄3 = 0.3333333
 
 Now you have to insert the values from the question into the equation (remember that you 
find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2):
 
  
 Volume = 0.3333333 × 3.14 × (2.5 ÷ 2)2 × 5.5 = 8.9947896, or 9.0 cubic inches, rounded to 
one decimal place 
 
 Record your answer on the standard grid.
 
7. 5. This problem asks you to solve a problem using basic operations. If Donna takes 3 breaths 
for every 27-inch step and she walks 1,000 yards (which equal 36,000 inches because there 
are 36 inches in a yard), she takes 36,000 ÷ 27 = 1,333.3 steps. If she takes 3 breaths per 
step, she takes 3 × 1,333.3 = 3,999.9 or 4,000 breaths during her 1,000-yard walk.
 
8. 2. This problem is a test of your knowledge of how to use the Pythagorean relationship. 
Sketch out a map for this problem: Due south and due west are at right angles. So Yvonne’s 
journey is a triangle, with the last part of Yvonne’s journey as the hypotenuse. Pythagoras 
(the guy who, as you may expect, came up with the Pythagorean relationship) said that the 
square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other 
two sides. Thus, the square of the last leg of Yvonne’s journey equals 472 + 172 = 2,498. 
The square root of 2,498 is 49.98. Because none of the numbers in this problem has any 
numbers beyond the decimal point, you can round the answer to 50. However, the ques-
tion asks how much farther she traveled: She ended up traveling 17 + 50 = 67 miles and 
would have traveled 47 miles. Therefore, she traveled 67 – 47 = 20 miles farther.
 
9. 4. If you want to use approximate values in this problem, you could say that the car depre-
ciates about 4 cents a mile over 100,000 miles. This car is about 37,000 miles over that 
milestone, which means it has depreciated about 4 × 37,000 cents. You want to solve this 
in terms of dollars, though. To change cents into dollars, you divide by 100 (because each 
dollar has 100 cents): 4 × 370 = 1,480.
 
 You can then subtract this approximate value from the original price: $13,500 – $1,480 = $12,020.
 
10. 11,907 (on standard grid). Using the same calculation that you use in problem 9, but using 
exact values, you get 13,500 – (4.3 × 37,046) ÷ 100 = 11,907.02 or $11,907, when rounded to 
the nearest dollar.
 
11. 2. This problem tests your skills in geometry by asking you to solve a problem involving 
similarity of geometrical figures. In order to draw a scale drawing, the lengths and widths 
must be reduced in the same ratio. If the wall is 17 feet or (17 × 12 = 204 inches), and 
the paper is 11 inches long, the ratio of paper length to real length is 11:204. The width 
of the drawing must stay in the same ratio. If the height of the drawing is H, then 
 
 11:204 = H(9 × 12) or 11:204 = H(108). In other words, 
. By cross-multiplying, you get 
 
 H = (11 × 108) ÷ 204 = 5.8. Note that the answer is rounded.
 
12. 3. This question tests your skills in algebra by asking you to evaluate a term in an equa-
 
 tion. The equation for the slope of a line is 
.
 
 Substituting into the equation, you get 
 
 Then, because 0.75 is the same thing as 3⁄4, you can say the following: 

382
Part VI: Counting All the Possible Solutions: The Mathematics Test 
 
 Cross-multiplying, you get the following:
 
  
3(x2 – 12) = 4 × 12
 
  
3x2 – 36 = 48
 
  
3x2 = 48 + 36
 
  
3x2 = 84
 
  
 
13. 1.1 (on standard grid). From the table, you can see that the highest literacy rate is Russia 
at 99.4% and the lowest is China at 90.9%. Looking at Russia and the United States, you can 
see that their literacy rates are so close that, for all intents and purposes, they’re equal, 
and, thus, there’s no need to calculate the comparison.
 
 If we consider the literacy rate for Russia divided by that for China, we get 99.4 ÷ 90.9 = 
1.093509351 or 1.1, rounded to one decimal place.
 
 The literacy rate of Russia is 1.1 times the literacy rate of China.
 
14. 2. The population of India is 1,103,371,000 of which 61.0% are literate. To calculate the 
number of literate people in India, calculate 61.0% of 1,103,371,000: 
1,103,371,000 × 0.61 = 673,056,310.
 
 Note that you have to change 61.0% to a decimal, 0.61, before you can do the calculation.
 
 The population of Israel is 6,725,000 of which 97.1% are literate. To calculate the number of 
literate people in Israel, calculate 97.1% of 6,725,000: 6,725,000 × 0.971 = 6,529,975.
 
 To calculate how many more illiterate people there are in India, you have to subtract the 
number of illiterate people in Israel from the number in India: 673,056,310 – 6,529,975 = 
666,526,335. Thus, there are 666,526,335 more illiterate people in India than in Israel, which 
really doesn’t tell you anything except that the population of India is substantially larger 
than that of Israel. The answer is 2,666 million.
 
 Choice (1) is the number of illiterate people in India, which the question didn’t ask for 
directly. The other answers are just wrong.
 
 In problems involving calculating big numbers, be careful reading the digits from the calcu-
lator and copying them to the page, and recheck the numbers. 
 
15. 3. This question tests your ability to calculate a probability. Use the formula given (P = N ÷ M) 
to calculate the results. To draw a card less than 6, the possible cards to be drawn are 5 
(less than 6) × 4 (the number of suits) = 20. The total possible number of cards is 52 (total 
cards in a deck) – the picture cards (4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings), which is 52 – 12 = 40. 
Now, using the equation, the probability is 20 ÷ 40 = 1⁄2. This is another way of writing 1 in 2.
 
16. 4. This question tests your skills in statistics by asking you to solve a problem involving 
the median of a group of numbers. Peter’s median grade was 82, which you find by putting 
his marks in ascending order — 76, 79, 81, 83, 87, 92 — and taking the grade that’s right 
in the middle. If you had an odd number of grades, choosing the grade that’s in the middle 
would be easy. Because you have an even number of grades, the median is the mean (or 
 
 average) of the two middle numbers, or 
.
 
17. 1. This question is a test of your skills in data analysis. Peter’s average grade was 
(81 + 76 + 92 + 87 + 79 + 83) ÷ 6 = 83. He failed to meet his goal by 7%. Each percent is 
equivalent to one point per subject, or 7 × 6 = 42 points.
 
18. 9.5 (on standard grid). This question tests you on your skills in measurement involving 
uniform rates, such as miles per hour, gallons per minute, or, in this case, cubic feet per 
minute. The tank fills at a uniform rate, which means you can do the question without 

383
 Chapter 28: Answers and Explanations for the Mathematics Test
getting involved in a series of calculations. The volume of a cylinder = π × radius2 × height. 
Substitute the numbers from the question into this equation:
 
  
Volume of cylinder = 3.14 × (2.1 ÷ 2)2 × 4.8 = 16.61688 or 16.6
 
 The safe fill rate is 13⁄4 or 1.75 cubic feet per minute. It would take 16.6 ÷ 1.75 = 9.4857142 or 
9.5 minutes (rounded to the nearest tenth) to fill the tank.
 
19. 4. Using the formula given, you can calculate the total amount she would have at the end 
of seven years:
 
  
M = P (1 + i)n
 
  
M = $1,574 (1 + .0375)7
 
  
M = $1,574 (1.0375)7
 
  
M = $2,036.67
 
20. 4. This question tests your knowledge of equations by asking you to analyze how a change 
in one quantity in an exponential equation, E = mc2, results in a change in another quantity. 
The variation between E and m in this function is linear and direct, which means that what-
ever happens to m also happens to E. If m is 3 times larger, so is E.
 
21. 5. This question tests your ability to figure out when you don’t have enough information to 
complete a problem. Without the value of the constant, the answer can be anything.
 
22. 5. Without the length of the tank, you don’t have enough information to answer the question.
 
23. 4. This question tests your skills in probability. If there are 49 possible numbers in a set, 
the probability of drawing any one number is 1 in 49.
 
24. 3. This problem tests your skills in data analysis by asking you to make inferences from data. 
If there are 49 numbers drawn in each draw, the odds of drawing a number greater than 25 is 
20 in 49. If you count the numbers greater than 25 in the table, you find 20 of them.
 
 Although there’s a lot of data in the table, lottery draws are discrete events (they aren’t 
dependent on one another), and the results of one don’t affect the results of another. Thus, 
you can consider only one draw for this question.
 
25. 4. This question tests your knowledge of statistics and measures of central tendency (in 
this case, the median). Consider the following adaptation of the given table. (The median is 
always the middle number when numbers are lined up from smallest to largest; when you 
have an even number of numbers, as you do here, take the two middle numbers, add them, 
and divide by 2 to get the median.)

 Louise’s theory is a curious one in that she seems to have no basis for it. When considering 
the numbers presented, two of the medians are close, so the best answer is occasionally.

1. 4. To calculate the basic cost of the computer, you have to add the net cost plus the over-
head (299 + 48 + 3 = 350). Because each computer costs Jerry $350 and he sells it for $449, 
he has a net profit of $99 (449 – 350 = 99).
 
 To calculate the number of computers he’d have to sell to make $700 a week, divide the 
amount of profit he wants to make by the gross cost of each computer:
 
  
700 ÷ 99 = 7.070707071
 
 Because you can’t sell less than one of a computer, the correct answer is 8.
 
2. 2. Georgio’s mean mark was (94 + 92 + 87 + 96 + 90) ÷ 5, or 459 ÷ 5, or 91.8. Because the 
minimum requirement was 90%, Georgio was 91.8 – 90 = 1.8% above the minimum, which is 
Choice (2). If you answered Choice (4), you forgot to subtract the minimum mark.
 
3. 3. The largest installed capacity is the United States with 1,850 megawatts, and the small-
est is China with 6 megawatts. To calculate the ratio, you have to divide the largest by the 
smallest or divide 1,850 by 6, which gives you 308.3333333, which is approximately 308. 
The ratio is 308:1
 
4. 3. The simplest way to figure out this problem is to create a chart by figuring out the costs 
of the old car per day and the costs of the new car per day by dividing the miles driven by 
the mileage and multiplying by the cost per gallon. For example, on Monday, Elayne 
spends this much for her old car in the city: 30 miles ÷ 18 mpg × $2.70 = $4.50.
 
 After you find out how much Elayne spends on her old car and would spend on her new 
car per day, you have to add the costs for the seven days of the week together to get the 
costs per week for each car.

 Dealer D is offering the best terms for financing the car.
 
6. 5. This question tests your skills in algebra because it asks you to use an equation to solve 
a problem.
 
 Using the formula given in the question, you can figure out that the average deviation is 
(7+6+2+13+9+17) ÷ 6 = 54 ÷ 6 = 9. Because the absolute values are used, the numbers with-
out the signs are used. You divide by 6 because there are six values to consider.
 
 The absolute value (what’s inside the two vertical lines) of a number is its value without 
regard to its sign. So, the absolute value of a negative number is always a positive number.
 
7. 2. In statistics, for results to be valid, samples must be large and random. In this question, 
the sample is too small to tell anyone anything of statistical significance, and the entire 
sample consists of friends, not randomly selected people. The best answer is that the 
sample was too small.
 
8. 4. This question tests your skills in number operations by asking you to select the appro-
priate operations to solve this problem. To solve it, you count the number of weeks 
between September and the end of June and multiply by 0.5 (that is, 0.5 pound) to get the 
answer, so you use counting and multiplication.
 
9. 1. This question tests your skills in using estimation to solve a problem involving number 
operations. There are ten months between the beginning of September and the end of 
June. If you estimate that there are 4 weeks in each month (there are actually about 4.3 
weeks per month), there are 40 weeks in this period of time. Each of them could lose about 
20 pounds (40 × 0.5).
 
10. 4. This question tests your skills in measurement to solve a problem involving uniform 
rates. If Mary can drive at an average speed of 45 miles per hour, it will take her 900 ÷ 45 = 
20 hours to drive the 900 miles. Samantha, on the other hand, will travel at 300 miles per 
hour on a plane for a time of 900 ÷ 300 = 3 hours, but she will add 45 + 75 (1 hour and 15 
minutes is 75 minutes) + 180 (that’s 3 hours in minutes) = 300 minutes. 300 minutes is 5 
hours (300 ÷ 60). Her total trip would be 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours in duration, or 12 
hours shorter than Mary’s trip.
 
11. 3. Looking at the graph, in the third quarter, the east plant seems to have produced twice 
(ratio of 2:1) as many hats as the north plant.
 
 This answer is considered an approximation because the graphs aren’t perfectly accurate.
 
12. 3. This question tests your ability to interpret data presented in a table. The data pre-
sented is the number of years left to live at different age levels. The only valid interpreta-
tion you can reach from this data is that the number of years yet to live decreases with 
increasing age, which is Choice (3).
 
 Read the answers as carefully as you read the questions. Women may have a greater life 
expectancy, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they age better or worse than men. That’s a 
topic for another question.

13. 5. This question tests your skills in data analysis by asking you to evaluate arguments. You 
also have to discover whether you have enough information to decide on a reason for why 
women live longer than men. In this case, you don’t have enough information in the table 
to develop any hypothesis, which means Choice (5) is correct. In question 12, you have 
enough information to make a broad, sweeping generalization, but that isn’t the case in 
this question. Always read questions carefully to make sure the question is answerable 
before choosing an answer.
 
14. 3. This question tests your skills in analysis by asking you to explain how a change in one 
quantity affects another quantity. The price of the article is set by a linear function involv-
ing the overhead (the costs of doing business that don’t change with how many products 
you sell — things like rent, utility bills, salaries, and so on), the cost of acquiring the item, 
and the profit. If any of these numbers go up, the selling price goes up, too, which is why 
the correct answer is Choice (3). In this equation, each of the terms affects the answer in a 
linear manner. If the rent goes up, either the selling price goes up or the profit goes down, 
but, in either situation, the raise in rent will have an effect on the basic cost of an item and, 
thus, the selling price, as well.
 
15. 7 (on standard grid). This question tests your skills in number operations by asking you to 
write a large number in scientific notation. To write 288,257,352 in scientific notation, you 
start with an approximation — 288,000,000 is close enough. The number of zeros defines the 
power of x. The population could be written as 288 × 106. Because Sol wants to write it more 
properly as 28.8 × a power of ten, the power would have to be one higher than 6, or 7.
 
16. 4. This question tests your skills in statistics by asking you to compare measurements of 
central tendency (the means or averages). Harry’s mean time is (15.6 + 14.9 + 16.0 + 15.8 + 
16.1) ÷ 5 = 15.68. Karry’s mean time is (15.9 + 16.1 + 15.8 + 16.2 + 14.8) ÷ 5 = 15.76. Karry has 
a higher mean time (which means that Harry is slightly faster).
 
17. 2. This question tests your skills in measurement by asking you to solve a problem involving 
volume. If the total floor area is 1,400 square feet and the ceilings are 9 feet high, the volume 
of the apartment is 1,400 × 9 = 12,600 cubic feet. If the air system can replace 63 cubic feet 
per minute, it requires 12,600 ÷ 63 = 200 minutes to withdraw and replace all the air, which is 
Choice (2). The other answer choices are wrong, but Choices (1) and (3) are close enough 
that if you tried to do the question using approximations you might become confused.
 
 When some of the answers are close in value, it’s worth the extra effort to do the calcula-
tions instead of estimating.
 
18. 5. This question tests your skills in measurement and geometry. You have to solve a prob-
lem involving uniform rates. Peter’s swimming pool holds 45 × 12 × 4 = 2,160 cubic feet of 
water. He can pump 9 cubic feet per minute. It would take him 2,160 ÷ 9 = 240 minutes. To 
get from hours to minutes, divide by 60 (because every hour has 60 minutes). So it would 
take Peter 240 ÷ 60 = 4 hours to empty his pool. If he started pumping at noon on Tuesday, 
Peter would finish four hours later, which is at 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday.
 
 An easy way to simplify this problem is to divide one number by 9 first: 45 ÷ 9 = 5. Then you 
can multiply: 5 × 12 × 4 = 240. This calculation is easier to do in your head than the other way.
 
19. 1. This question tests your skills in algebra by asking you to analyze data used to calculate 
the mean of a set of numbers. If Mohammed earned an average of $420.00 for four weeks, he 
earned a total of 420 × 4 = $1,680.00. The other three weeks he earned $480.00 + $400.00 + 
$550.00 = $1,430.00. The remaining week he earned $1,680.00 – $1,430.00 = $250.00.
 
20. 457 (on standard grid). This question tests your skills in number operations. Georgia 
spent $500.00 – $126.00 = $374.00 plus $83.00 in credit card purchases. $374.00 + $83.00 = 
$457.00, or 457 in dollars on the standard grid.
 
21. 2. This question tests your skills in geometry and spatial visualization. If you opened a can 
flat along the seam, you’d have a rectangle and two circles, one on each end. Questions of 
this type require the use of imagination. Imagine a can and cut it along the seam in your 
head, and then cut around the bottom and top to make it lay flat. The result would be a 
rectangle from the can itself and a circle on each end from the top and bottom.

22. 4. This question tests your skills by asking you to read carefully to answer a question. If 
Sonya’s car uses gasoline in direct proportion to her speed, the faster she goes, the more 
gas she uses. The more gas she uses, the more it costs her to drive, which is an economic 
consequence — so Choice (4) is correct. Choice (1) isn’t an economic consequence, 
although it is true in fact.
 
 Read the answers carefully. A right answer that doesn’t answer the question is wrong.
 
23. (0,–4) on coordinate-plane grid. If the center is at the origin and the diameter (which is 
twice the radius) is 8 units, the circle will intersect each of the axes (that’s the plural of 
axis) at a distance of 4 units from it. Therefore, it intersects the negative y-axis at (0,–4).
 
24. 4. If the gauge reads 1⁄8 full, it has 24 ÷ 8 = 3 gallons of fuel left in it. Because it holds 24 gal-
lons, it needs 24 – 3 = 21 gallons to fill it.
 
25. 2. To solve these equations, you need to subtract one from the other and end up with just 
ys. To get rid of one of the variables using this method, you need to have the same coeffi-
cient in front of the variable you’re planning to eliminate. You can multiply each term of an 
equation by a number and still maintain the equation. Here’s how:
 
  
 Multiply the second equation by 2 and leave the first equation as it is (or multiply by 1, 
which is the same thing):
 
  
1(4x + 2y = 20) = 4x + 2y = 20
 
  
2(2x + 6y = 35) = 4x + 12y = 70
 
  
Subtract, and you get 10y = 50; y = 5.
 
 Note that you can also multiply the second equation by –2 and add the two equations 
together. Either way gets you the same answer.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part — which appears in all For Dummies books — 
includes lists of tens that amaze, astonish, astound, 
amuse, clarify, edify, educate, elucidate, expound, and 
explain. (Note that we use ten verbs here.)
This part gives you tips for succeeding on the GED tests, 
maximizing your test scores, and using that wonderful 
diploma after you pass all the tests.
If you use the material in this book seriously and have 
some fun with what we provide you, you’ll be prepared for 
the tests. Only you can make a difference in your life. Start 
with this part and make up your own list of how a GED 
diploma will change your life for the better.

Chapter 29
Ten (Plus One) Surefire Ways to 
Maximize Your GED Test Scores
In This Chapter
▶ Finding ways to improve your skills for each test
▶ Giving yourself time to study and sleep
▶ Preparing yourself for the big day
O
f course you want to do well on the GED — otherwise, you wouldn’t be reading 
this book. But we also know that your time is limited, so this chapter gives you ten 
(er, eleven — we got a little carried away!) ideas and tips for doing well on your tests.
Studying Subject-Matter Books
If you’ve taken all the practice tests in this book (see Chapters 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 
and 27), you may have identified key areas in which you’re lacking skills. Although those 
practice tests can’t predict your score, they do give you practice and a general idea of your 
strengths and weaknesses. If you didn’t get 80 percent correct on any of the sample tests, 
you need to improve your skills in that area.
 
We recommend that you visit your local bookstore or library for the many For Dummies, 
CliffsNotes, and CliffsQuickReview books (Wiley) that are meant just for students. For exam-
ple, consider the following fun, interesting, and easy-to-read For Dummies books that can 
either improve your skills or simply make you more familiar with (and, therefore, more 
comfortable with) certain subjects:
 
✓ Algebra For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling (mathematics)
 
✓ Algebra II For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling (mathematics)
 
✓ Algebra Workbook For Dummies by Mary Jane Sterling (mathematics)

To find out what other helpful For Dummies books have been published since this book was 
written, check out www.dummies.com.
 
Consider browsing through the For Dummies travel books to help with social studies. You 
may also want to review some of the For Dummies workplace books on managing people 
and running a business to get acquainted with workplace reading material, which often 
appears on the Language Arts, Reading Test.
 
The CliffsNotes Literature series helps you study specific books, plays, poems, and short sto-
ries. Although the Language Arts, Reading Test doesn’t test your knowledge of literature, 
reading literature is always a good way to help you prepare for that test. Consider reading 
one or two of Shakespeare’s plays and other drama, poetry from 1600 to the present, novels 
from 1920 to the present, and recent short stories. If you’re unsure about anything you read, 
pick up the CliffsNotes book on that piece of literature, and discover what you may have 
missed on your first reading. To find a CliffsNotes title for the literature you’re reading, go to 
www.cliffsnotes.com.
Books in the CliffsQuickReview and CliffsAP series may also be helpful. Note that the CliffsAP 
series is geared toward Advance Placement students who are in high school but are trying 
to take tests that allow them to earn college credits. Cliffs and CliffsQuickReview books are 
geared specifically to high school and college students who are struggling to understand a 
particular subject matter. Before buying any books, browse through each title you’re con-
sidering to make sure it meets your needs.
 
Make full use of your library (including interlibrary loans) so that you don’t end up spend-
ing all your hard-earned money on books. Here are just a few of the most helpful CliffsNotes 
books related to GED test areas:
 
✓ Cliffs Math Review for Standardized Tests by Jerry Bobrow (mathematics)
 
✓ Cliffs Memory Power for Exams by William Browning (general)

Some preparation books (books like this one that prepare you to take the GED tests) also 
include tutoring in test-content areas. (Those books are usually from 800 to 1,000 pages 
long, which is far more pages than this book had room for.) Visit your bookstore or local 
library and look for an up-to-date test-preparation book that gives you at least two addi-
tional sets of practice tests, is easy to understand, and includes some skill-building material 
in the areas in which you need help. You may also want to try taking an Official GED 
Practice Test. This test is available at testing centers and preparation classes. The official 
practice test can help you predict your score. This score allows you to see how close you 
are to passing the real GED.
You may also want to check out The SAT I For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Geraldine Woods 
and The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Michelle Rose Gilman, Veronica Saydak, and 
Suzee Vlk (Wiley). Although they’re aimed at juniors and seniors who are taking college-
entrance exams, if you can master the review material and sample questions, you prepare 
yourself not only for the GED but also for college-entrance exams after you receive your 
diploma.
Enrolling in a GED Preparation Class
If you like to interact with other people and prefer a teacher to guide you through your 
preparation, consider taking a GED preparation class: a class designed to prepare you to 
take and pass the GED tests. These classes are generally offered free of charge.
 
To find a class in your location, ask around: Question people you know who have taken the 
GED, administrators and teachers at your local high school or college, or workers at your 
local GED testing center. You may also be able to take distance-learning courses (which 
means you do your assignments on your own and contact your instructor via the Internet), 
which may be a good choice for you.

394
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
After deciding on a few potential classes, visit the class or instructor, if possible. Make sure 
that his or her teaching style matches your learning style. The preparation class will be a 
big investment of your time, so shop around wisely.
After choosing a preparation class, form a study group — a small group of other GED test 
takers who help each other with study questions. Then you can help each other study and 
ask each other questions about different aspects of the test. Not to mention, you can still go 
out with your friends and have a good time without boring everyone by talking only about 
the GED tests.
 Be wary before committing to a group, though: If the other group members’ idea of studying 
is to party for three hours to get ready for five minutes of study, and you want to study for 
three hours to get ready for five minutes of social activity, you won’t be happy. Talk to the 
other members of the study group and listen to what the goals are for the group. If you can 
find a suitable group, make a commitment and enjoy your new friends.
Scheduling Time to Study
Whether you study on your own or with an instructor, set aside time each day to study. 
Stick to your schedule as if your grade depends on it (and, by the way, it does!). Study regu-
larly by doing the following:
 
1. Take practice tests to find out with which subject area(s) you struggle.
 
 Check each answer on the practice tests, and read all the answer explanations. Make 
sure you understand your mistakes.
 
2. Focus your studies on the subject area(s) in which you’re weak.
 
3. Take more practice tests.
Preparing for the Test in Your Mind
To make yourself less anxious about the GED tests, visualize yourself at the tests. In your 
mind, see yourself enter the room, sit down at the desk, hear the instructions, and pick up 
your pen or pencil. Go through this routine in your mind until it begins to feel familiar. Then 
see yourself opening the question booklet and skimming the questions (questions that are 
likely familiar to you because you’ve taken many practice tests). See yourself noting the 
easy questions and beginning to answer them. By repeating this visual sequence over and 
over again in your mind, it becomes familiar — and what’s familiar isn’t nearly as stressful 
as what’s unfamiliar.
Getting Good Rest the Week before the Test
As part of your plan for preparation, include some social time, some down time, and plenty 
of time for rest because everyone performs better when well rested. In fact, your memory 
and ability to solve problems improve remarkably when you’re properly rested.
 
Whatever you do, don’t panic about your upcoming tests and stay up all night (or every 
night for a week) right before your tests. Instead, plan your last week before the test so that 
you get plenty of sleep and are mentally and physically prepared for the test.

395
 Chapter 29: Ten (Plus One) Surefire Ways to Maximize Your GED Test Scores
Wearing Comfortable Clothes
Consider the following situation. You’re about to sit for approximately seven and a half 
hours on what is probably an uncomfortable chair. The room may be too warm or too cold.
So, choosing from the following answers, what’s the appropriate dress for the GED tests?
 
(1) formal dress because this is an important occasion
 
(2) a parka over a bathing suit because one can never predict the weather
 
(3) something very comfortable so that you can concentrate on the tests
 
(4) your best clothes because you need to impress others
 
(5) whatever is handiest in your closet
If you answered Choice (3), you have the idea. Dress comfortably and in layers. All of your 
concentration should be on the tests, not your clothes, not on the people around you, and 
not on the conditions in the room.
Making Sure You Have Proper Identification
To take the GED tests, you need acceptable picture identification. Because what’s accept-
able may vary from state to state, check with your state GED office or your local testing 
center (or check the information they send to you after you sign up) before the test.
 
The picture I.D. required is usually a driver’s license or passport; at any rate, it’s usually 
something common and easy to obtain. Just check in advance for what’s required, and 
make sure you have it ready for the tests.
Practicing Your Route to the Test Site
On certain days, you just don’t want to get lost. These days include your wedding day, an 
important interview, and the day you’re taking the GED tests. Make sure you plan a route 
from your home to the testing site. Map it out and practice getting to the test center.
 
Leave extra time for surprises. You never know when your street could be declared an ele-
phant crossing and a pack of elephants decides to meander across your road. The crowd 
and elephants could make you late for the tests unless you allow yourself some extra time.
Arriving Early
Consider the following two scenarios:
 
✓ Test Taker One arrives 15 seconds before the beginning of the tests and feels nothing 
but panic. Test Taker One barely arrives at the desk in time to lift a pencil and begin 
the test. Test Taker One is so distracted that he or she takes 15 minutes to calm down, 
and by then, the first test is well underway.
 
✓ Test Taker Two arrives 40 minutes early. Test Taker Two has time to drink some coffee 
and relax before the test. Sitting calmly at the desk, Test Taker Two relaxes, listens to 
the instructions, and begins to take the first test in a relaxed manner.

396
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Which test taker would you rather be? Leave early for the test! Let other people stress and 
panic. Be the relaxed, prepared test taker.
 
A couple of weeks before the tests, confirm the time your test is supposed to begin. You 
may receive a letter of confirmation before your testing date. If not, follow up with the test-
ing center with a phone call.
Starting with Easy Questions
As you open each test, start with the easy questions — the ones you know you can do. As 
soon as you get the test, skim the questions, identify the easy ones, and do those problems 
first. Only after doing so are you ready to tackle the other questions in a relaxed, confident 
mood.
 Whatever you do, don’t mark in the test book as you move through the questions! Doing so 
could get you tossed out of the test.
Using Relaxation Techniques
Feeling a bit of stress before taking the GED tests is normal. A little bit of stress can actually 
help you function better, but you don’t want to become so stressed that you can’t think.
You need to find some ways to relax. Here are some techniques that may work for you:
 
✓ Think positively. Instead of listing all the negative things that may happen, start listing 
the positive things. You can pass the GED tests. You can go on to college. You can get a 
great job. You can win the lottery — well, maybe that’s going too far. Don’t be greedy. 
Just be positive!
 
✓ Breathe deeply. The first thing to remember during a stressful situation is to breathe. 
The second thing is to breathe deeply. You can do so by following these steps:
 
1. Find your diaphragm.
 
 Not a diagram, although you could use a diagram to find your diaphragm. Your 
diaphragm is that flat muscle under your ribcage that fills your lungs with air. It’s 
above your navel.
 
2. Breathe in and make your diaphragm rise as much as you can.
 
3. Exhale slowly.
 
4. Repeat, making your diaphragm rise higher each time.
 
 After you see how this process relaxes you, try it before each test.
 
✓ Count backward from ten (in your head). You can do this before any test, not just the 
math one. Start to count backward from ten with no thoughts in your mind. If a thought, 
even a teeny one, enters your mind, you have to start over. See how many times it takes 
to count from ten to one without a single thought entering your mind.
 
 Don’t do this during the tests, only before. This exercise could eat up precious time if 
you tried it during one of the tests.

397
 Chapter 29: Ten (Plus One) Surefire Ways to Maximize Your GED Test Scores
 
✓ Clench and unclench your fists. This simple relaxation technique involves your hands 
and reminds your mind to relax:
 
1. Sit with your hands in front of you.
 
2. Inhale deeply as you slowly clench your fists.
 
3. After they’re clenched, slowly exhale as you unclench them.
 
 You may have to repeat this process several times, but within a couple of repetitions, 
you’ll begin to feel relaxed.
 
✓ Stare out a window. Stare out a window, far into the distance. Try to see a point 
beyond the horizon. As you do, feel your eyes relax. Let your eyes relax until the feel-
ing spreads to every part of your body. Enjoy the feeling long enough to let go of all the 
stress that has built up. When you’re calm and full of energy, return to the test.
 
 If your testing room doesn’t have a window, stare at a blank wall and envision your 
favorite relaxing scene. Don’t be tempted, however, to close your eyes. If you’re the 
least bit tired or stressed, you may fall asleep and not wake up until the test is over.

Ten Ways to Be Successful 
on the GED Tests
In This Chapter
▶ Doing what you can to prepare before the test
▶ Avoiding common mistakes on test day
▶ Weeding out some bad habits so that you can succeed
You want to be successful on the GED tests. If you didn’t, you wouldn’t have this book 
in your hands and spend all your spare time preparing for the tests, right? For your 
benefit, we present ten quick and easy ways to help you achieve your goal in this chapter.
Selecting the Best-Possible Test Date
Why plan to take your GED tests when you have a million other things to do? Sure, you 
probably live a busy life all the time, but do your best to find a period in that busy life 
when you can concentrate on preparing for and passing the tests. Choose the test date 
wisely. If you have enough time to prepare, you’ll do well. It’s just that simple. Select a date 
that gives you enough time to prepare but not one that’s so far in the distance that you’ll 
retire before you take the tests. Check out Chapter 1 for information on scheduling the test.
Preparing, Preparing, and Then 
Preparing Some More
If you’re thinking of just signing up for the test, waiting until the test day comes, and walking 
in to take it — without ever preparing or studying — you’ll likely be disappointed at your 
test results. You wouldn’t start to build a house by arriving at the construction site with 
nothing but your good looks and a smile, right? A successful completion — of any goal — 
requires careful and complete planning. Check out Chapter 3 to read about some general 
tips for preparing for the tests. Also spend some time reviewing Chapters 4, 9, 14, 19, and 
24, which give you specific tips and hints for preparing for each individual test.
 
Being confident is great. Being overconfident can cause problems. If you think you may be 
overestimating your knowledge, take as many practice tests as you can, and take them 
under the same time conditions as the actual tests. If your confidence exceeds the results 
you get on the practice tests, don’t knock the practice tests. Consider yourself lucky to 
know in which areas you need more practice. Then start seriously preparing for what may 
turn out to be a life-changing situation. Preparation is never wasted, and time wasted is 
never preparation.

400
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Remaining Realistic
When you take the test, you need to keep a level head. Preparing (see the preceding sec-
tion) is the best way to accomplish this goal. Optimism alone won’t assure success. But an 
optimistic attitude combined with realistic preparation will get you far in this world. Your 
mental attitude can steer you in that direction. Look at the bright side, but be realistic.
To help, make a list of all the things you could worry about. If you find it easier, make a 
series of lists: personal, family, community, state, country, region, world, ecological, envi-
ronmental, financial, governmental, and so on. Make the list as long and complete as you 
can. Leave it for a day, and try to add more items later. When your list is as complete as 
possible, read it, toss it, and promise not to worry about anything on the list until after you 
finish taking the GED tests. Worrying distracts you from the one and only thing that should 
be on your worry list: passing the GED tests. On the other hand, if you make a list of the 
changes that could come about in your life after you pass the GED tests, you can look 
toward the future. Realistic preparation can help you accomplish your goals.
Being on Time for When the Tests Start
If you’re late to the test site, you probably won’t be allowed to enter and you’ll have to take 
the tests on another date. Not to mention, you’ll probably have to pay again to take the 
tests. Who needs all this grief? All you have to do to prevent this tragedy is to be early for 
the tests, which, contrary to popular belief, isn’t as difficult as it may seem. You can pre-
pare for your route and arrival the way you prepare for the tests. Check out some route 
maps on the Internet. Look into the schedules for your local public transportation services. 
Do your research, leave extra time for unforeseen situations, and arrive on time and ready 
for the tests.
Keeping Your Comments to Yourself
A little bit of stress is normal when you walk into a test. The last thing you want, though, is 
to increase your stress level. Although it may seem antisocial, keep your serious conversa-
tions to a minimum just before the tests. If you want to exchange pleasantries about the 
weather, go ahead. If you want to arrange to go for coffee after the tests, plan away. If you 
want to get into a serious conversation about how everything you’ve done to this point will 
only guarantee failure, run away as fast as you can and don’t talk to anyone! People hanging 
around the test center or walking into the tests who have a hundred hints to tell everybody 
are guaranteed to increase your stress level. If you’ve prepared, you’re ready. Listen to the 
voice in your head that says you’re ready. Don’t listen to the sidewalk experts who are 
going into the tests with you. If they were so smart, they’d already have their GED.
Staying Focused on the Task at Hand
An archer who wants to hit the bull’s-eye keeps all his mental faculties focused on the goal 
at hand. Nobody ever hit the center of the target daydreaming about the next social gather-
ing. For this reason, put your mind on a leash; don’t let it wander during the test. Letting 
your mind wander back to the greatest vacation you ever had can be very relaxing, but

letting it wander during a test can be a disaster. You want your mind sharp, keen, and 
focused before and during the tests, so concentrate on the task at hand — doing your best 
and passing the GED.
 
Be sure to get plenty of sleep in the nights and weeks before the test. If you’re well rested, 
you’ll have an easier time focusing on each question and answering it correctly.
Looking at Only Your Test
If there were a Biggest Mistake Award for test takers, it would be awarded to someone who 
looks at his or her neighbor’s paper during the test. This action is called cheating and is a 
very serious matter. Not only will you be asked to leave the testing center, but you may 
have to wait from several months to a year before you’re allowed to schedule another test. 
Look at only your test. For the duration of the tests, your test and answer booklets are the 
most beautiful, fascinating items in the world. Thus, it’s impossible not to spend all your 
time looking at them. More than likely, your neighbor will have a different test.
 Don’t even give the slightest hint that you may, possibly, be looking at someone else’s 
paper. The test proctor probably won’t care about what you were actually doing; what he 
saw was you looking in the general direction of another person’s paper, which, as you know, 
is considered cheating.
Writing Clearly and Carefully
The GED has only one test that allows you to write out an answer (as opposed to filling in 
circles). For the essay in Part II of the Language Arts, Writing Test (see Part II of this book), 
make sure you write clearly and carefully. Two test graders have to read it, and if they mis-
read it because the writing is impossible to read, you’ll lose marks. If your writing is natu-
rally sloppy, spend some time improving it or figure out how to speed print. Be kind to your 
test graders — write clearly. You may write in cursive or print. Just be neat. Check out 
Chapter 4 for more advice.
Thinking Positive
Young children often inform their parents that they’re in charge of themselves. Although 
this idea may not be true for a 4-year-old child, it’s certainly true for an adult. You’re in 
charge of your thoughts. You can think positive thoughts, or you can think negative 
thoughts. All we can say is that positive thoughts will make you happier, more productive, 
and more confident, all of which can help you do your best on the GED tests.
Doing Your Best, No Matter What
Not everyone passes the GED tests the first time. If you’ve taken the tests before, don’t see 
yourself as a failure for not passing them — see the situation as a learning experience. Use 
your last test as motivation to discover your academic weaknesses. Sometimes you can gain 
more from not succeeding than from succeeding. Whether you’re taking the tests for the 
first time or not, focus on doing your best.

402
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Life is full of ups and downs. Although you may do your best on the test, unfortunately, fate 
may scheme against you. You may be a bit under the weather, or your children may have 
gotten on your last nerve right before you left the house. Regardless, don’t worry. You can 
always retake the tests. Keep in mind that doing your best can build your confidence to 
achieve more at the next opportunity.
 
You can retake the tests up to three times a year and over several years, if needed. Failing 
once isn’t a permanent condition, but not doing your best can become one.
You only have to retake the tests that you didn’t pass. Note: There is an additional fee to 
retake individual tests. The prices may vary, so consult your local administrator. 

Chapter 31
Ten Ways to Use Your GED 
After You Pass the Tests
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the most out of your diploma in your work life
▶ Reaping a few more personal benefits from your diploma
P
assing the GED tests makes life more rewarding because it opens doors that you may 
not have even known were closed before you passed the tests. You’ve probably 
already figured out why you want your GED; if not, this chapter shares ten great advantages 
the GED diploma can give you.
Getting a Job
Many employers want to see a high school diploma or its equivalent before they even think 
about giving you a job. In fact, a high school diploma or its equivalent is often used as a 
screening tool for interviews. A GED allows you to jump this hurdle. It shows potential 
employers that you’ve mastered skills equal to most high school graduates. This accom-
plishment can help you get an interview, and, when the interviewer sees how brilliant you 
are, it can help you get a job.
 
The U.S. government, one of the country’s largest employers, accepts a GED as being equiv-
alent to a high school diploma. Who’s going to argue with Uncle Sam?
Being Promoted
If you’re already working, you want to show your supervisor that you’re ready for a promo-
tion. The GED says, “I worked hard for this diploma and achieved something special!” 
Passing the GED helps you show your employer that you’re ready to do the same — that is, 
work hard — on the job. It also shows that you’ve taken responsibility for your life and are 
ready to take on additional responsibility at work. Earning a GED gives you a document that 
shows you’ve mastered skills and are ready to master some more. You’ve solved problems 
and read charts and diagrams, and you’re ready to do the same at work.

404
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Showing Others What You Can Achieve
When you earn your GED, you show the world that you accomplished — on your own — 
what most other high school students needed a building, teachers, counselors, principals, 
and at least four years to accomplish. Now’s the time to visit old teachers and go to 
reunions to show your past acquaintances what you’ve accomplished on your own. 
Sometimes we even think you should get to wear a badge that says, “GED — I Did It!” After 
all, being able to show others that you’ve accomplished something major thanks to your 
own hard work is important — in both your personal and professional lives.
Including Your GED in Your College Portfolio
Your college portfolio is a binder that lists all your skills and experiences in an organized 
manner. Many colleges have a particular format they want you to use for your portfolio; if 
yours doesn’t, employment counselors can suggest generic formats. You can also make up 
a format. The important thing is to have a place where you list all your skills and experi-
ences that you can take to college and job interviews.
Your GED is the centerpiece of your portfolio. The diploma is a stamp of approval on all your 
prior learning. It shows that you officially know what high school graduates comprehend.
Proving You’re Ready for Further Education
After you master the skills equal to most high school graduates, you’re ready to go on to the 
next step: college. Most colleges accept the GED as proof of the equivalency to high school 
graduation. If your goal is further education, remind the registrars at the colleges you want 
to attend that you’re a mature student who has worked hard to get where you are. 
Emphasize the real-world skills you’ve mastered by working in the real world, and explain 
how those skills make you a great candidate for college.
In an address to a joint session of Congress on February 24, 2009, President Obama asserted 
the need to graduate more high school students and to support their entrance into postsec-
ondary institutions. Passing the GED tests proves that you’re ready to be one of these stu-
dents who is ready to enter college.
Setting an Example for Your Kids
If you’re like most people, you want your kids (or grandchildren) to be better educated and 
more successful than you were. As soon as you pass the GED tests, you set the bar a little 
higher for them. Your accomplishment also reminds your kids that education is important — 
for you and them.
Enhancing Your Wall Décor
You may already have interesting mementos of your life hanging on your wall, but what 
could be more exciting than your very own framed GED diploma? A diploma looks great on 

405
 Chapter 31: Ten Ways to Use Your GED After You Pass the Tests
your wall because it represents all the hard work you put in to passing the tests — not to 
mention your accomplishment in doing so.
 
If you plan to frame your GED diploma, make a couple of copies for prospective employers 
and colleges before you do so. Make copies of the transcript of your test results, as well. 
That way, you’re ready to include these copies with your job and college applications (as 
soon as you finish the rest of them).
Making You Feel like Part of a Select Group
Earning the GED means that you’ve outperformed 40 percent of high school seniors, which 
in itself is impressive. It also places you among great company. Comedian Bill Cosby and 
Dave Thomas, the late founder of Wendy’s, are GED graduates. Although no one can prom-
ise that passing the GED tests will make you a show-business star or help you start a fast-
food chain, it will make you feel very special. Who knows when you’ll become famous 
enough to be listed in this section of a future edition?
Motivating Yourself
One thing about challenging tests is that you have to face the challenges they throw at you 
on your own. You can use the fact that you overcame those challenges thanks to your hard 
work and determination to motivate yourself in your future endeavors. If you successfully 
passed the GED tests through rigid preparation and planning, nothing can stop you. After 
all, you’ve accomplished something not everyone can do. Enjoy the feeling you get from 
passing the GED, and use it in the future as you go on to bigger and better pursuits.
Improving Your Self-Esteem
When you pass the GED tests, you’re essentially a high school graduate and can prove it 
(thanks to the handy diploma and transcript you receive upon passing the test). But the 
piece of paper is only concrete proof of your accomplishment. The real results are in your 
brain and in your own feelings about yourself. You need to remember that you passed the 
tests by yourself, with a little help from preparation texts, perhaps — but the real work was 
yours. Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment you feel after passing the tests, and use it to feel 
better about yourself.
