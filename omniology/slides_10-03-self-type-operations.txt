Self Type Operations

Self Type Operations 
• What can be the dynamic type of the object returned by inc? 
– Answer: whatever could be the type of “self” 
 
 
class A inherits Count { } ; 
class B inherits Count { } ; 
class C inherits Count { } ; 
           (inc could be invoked through any of these classes)

•
In general, if SELF_TYPE appears textually in the class C as the 
declared type of E then 
               dynamic_type(E)  C 
 
•
Note: The meaning of SELF_TYPE depends on where it appears 
– SELF_TYPEC to refers to an occurrence of SELF_TYPE in the body of C 
 
•
This suggests a typing rule: 
                  SELF_TYPEC  C                      (*)

• Rule (*) has an important consequence: 
– In type checking it is always safe to replace 
SELF_TYPEC by C 
 
• This suggests one way to handle SELF_TYPE : 
– Replace all occurrences of SELF_TYPEC by C

Self Type Operations 
• Recall the operations on types 
– T1  T2             T1 is a subtype of T2 
– lub(T1,T2)     the least-upper bound of T1 and T2 
 
• Extend these operations to handle SELF_TYPE

Self Type Operations 
Let T and T’ be any types but SELF_TYPE 
 
1.
SELF_TYPEC  SELF_TYPEC 
•
In Cool we never compare SELF_TYPEs coming from different classes 
 
2.
SELF_TYPEC    T  if C  T 
•
SELF_TYPEC can be any subtype of C 
•
This includes C itself  
•
Thus this is the most flexible rule we can allow

3.  T  SELF_TYPEC always false 
 
Note: SELF_TYPEC can denote any subtype of C.  
 
4. T  T’ (according to the rules from before) 
 
 
 

Self Type Operations 
Choose the subtype relations that 
are true for the class definitions 
given at right 
Square  SELF_TYPEShape  
SELF_TYPECircle  Quad  
SELF_TYPEShape  Shape 
SELF_TYPERect  Shape 
Class Object 
Class Bool inherits Object 
Class Point inherits Object 
Class Line inherits Object 
Class Shape inherits Object 
Class Quad inherits Shape 
Class Circle inherits Shape 
Class Rect inherits Quad 
Class Square inherits Rect 
 
 

Alex Aiken 
Self Type Operations 
Let T and T’ be any types but SELF_TYPE 
1.
lub(SELF_TYPEC, SELF_TYPEC) = SELF_TYPEC 
 
2.
lub(SELF_TYPEC, T) = lub(C, T) 
This is the best we can do because SELF_TYPEC  C 
 
 
3.
lub(T, SELF_TYPEC) = lub(C, T) 
 
4.
lub(T, T’)  defined as before
