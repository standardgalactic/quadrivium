Greek Myths

A Dorling Kindersley Book

Stories of old  
In ancient times, the people of 
Greece built huge temples where they 
worshipped their gods and goddesses. 
Where did the idea of these gods come 
from? Like all cultures, the Greeks 
wanted to understand the changing 
seasons, the weather, why good and  
bad things happened to them, and  
what would happen when they died.

5
Their answers lay in the belief that 
there were gods and goddesses who took 
an interest in people’s everyday lives. 
They told stories about these immortals 
that we call myths. These included tales 
of heroes, monsters and spirits. v
The belief in the Greek gods and goddesses 
spread throughout the ancient Greek empire.

Family of Greek gods  
Let’s begin at the beginning with the 
god of the heavens, Uranus, and the 
earth goddess, Gaia. Their children were 
the race of Titans, a group of powerful 
giants who roamed the heavens and 
earth. The youngest, Cronus, the god  
of Time, took control when he killed  
his father. Aphrodite [af-ro-DIE-tee], 
the goddess of love, sprang from the  
sea as Uranus was cut into pieces. 
Aphrodite, goddess  
of love and beauty

7
Eros
The beautiful son of Aphrodite, 
Eros, was the god of love.  
In myths, he was known for 
shooting his arrows at people  
to make them fall in love.
Cronus had three sons: Zeus, 
Poseidon [poss-EYE-don] and Hades. 
He also had three daughters: Hestia, 
Demeter and Hera. It was these 
immortals and their children who 
appeared in many of the Greek myths.
Cronus, 
god of time
Uranus, god of the heavens

8
Zeus waged a 
terrifying war against 
his father and some  
of the Titans, and 
defeated them.  
He then became the  
god of heaven and earth and went on to 
father many gods, goddesses and heroes. 
He lived with his wife, Hera, along with 
Demeter, Aphrodite and his eight 
immortal children on Mount Olympus, 
the highest mountain in Greece. 
Zeus, god of 
the heavens 
and earth
Hera, goddess 
of childbirth 
and marriage
The peak of Mount 
Olympus was believed to  
be the home of the gods.

9
Hestia, the goddess of the home,  
gave up her seat on Olympus to look 
after the fire within the mountain. 
Poseidon, the god of the sea, lived in  
his golden underwater palace, stirring  
up storms and earthquakes  
if he was angry. 
 
 
 
 
Hades was the dark god of the 
Underworld – the place where people 
went when they died.
Hades, god of 
the Underworld
Poseidon, god 
of the sea

10
Demeter, the goddess of crops, had  
a beautiful daughter named Persephone 
[per-SEFF-on-nee]. Hades kidnapped 
Persephone and made her his wife in  
the Underworld. As Demeter grieved, 
the earth became frozen and nothing 
grew and so Zeus ordered  
Hades to free Persephone.
Hades kidnapped 
Persephone, taking  
her to the Underworld.

11
When she saw her daughter again, 
Demeter’s sadness melted, winter  
faded and the plants grew. However, 
Persephone had eaten six pomegranate 
seeds during her time in the 
Underworld, so each year she 
had to spend six months with 
Hades. For the other six 
months, she could be with  
her mother, and the seasons 
changed to spring and summer. 

Many of Zeus’s 
immortal children 
had unusual birth 
stories. One day Zeus 
had a bad headache. 
He asked his son Hephaestus [hef-EEST-
us] to split open his head with an axe. 
Out sprang Athena [a-THEE-na], dressed 
for battle and shouting her war cry. 
Just like us, these titanic Olympians 
had emotions such as love, jealousy and 
anger. They were fascinated by people 
and meddled in their lives with both 
heroic and fateful consequences. v
Athena’s city
Athens, the capital of Greece, was named for Athena 
after she won a competition against Poseidon.

and lightning

blacksmith’s fire

14
Pandora’s jar  
According to legend, Zeus wanted  
to create a race of people. He ordered 
Prometheus [pro-MEE-thee-us], one  
of the Titans, to mould men  
and women out of clay in the 
likeness of the gods. Zeus  
then breathed life into  
the people. 

15
Prometheus lived among the people 
and taught them how to build homes, 
grow plants and hunt animals.  
He begged Zeus to give them fire so they 
could cook and make metal 
tools, but Zeus refused.  
“It will make them as 
powerful as the gods,” 
he said.
However, Prometheus stole some fire 
from the rising sun. When Zeus saw the 
people using fire, he was very angry and 
punished Prometheus severely.
Eternal punishment
For disobeying Zeus, Prometheus 
was chained to a high rock and  
had his liver torn out each day  
by an eagle. As he was immortal, 
his liver grew back every night.

16
Zeus also wanted to punish the 
people, so he asked Hephaestus to  
make a woman in his blacksmith’s fire. 
The gods gave her gifts, such as beauty, 
love, curiosity and deceit. They named 
her Pandora meaning “all-gifted”.
She was sent to Prometheus’s brother, 
Epimetheus [e-pee-MEE-thee-us].  
She was also given a jar, which she  
was forbidden to open. 
Pandora receives the gifts of beauty from Aphrodite, 
music from Apollo and deceit from Hermes.

17
Although his brother had warned 
him not to accept a gift from Zeus, 
Epimetheus was enchanted with 
Pandora and married her. 
Pandora could not 
forget about the jar.  
One day she peeped 
inside and all the evils flew out 
into the world –
sickness, sin  
and death. 
 
As she closed the lid, 
hope was the only 
thing left in the jar. v

18
Labours of Heracles  
This is the tale of the greatest and 
strongest of all heroes – Heracles [HAIR-
a-kleez]. He was the son of Zeus, but his 
mother was a mortal woman. Hera was 
extremely jealous of Heracles. He grew 
into a determined, wise young man with 
superhuman strength and skill.
Zeus wanted his son to become a god 
when he died. Hera replied, “I will only 
agree to this if Heracles can perform 
twelve labours to be set by his cousin 
Eurystheus [you-RIS-thee-us], the king  
of Mycenae [my-SEE-nee]”. 
Super strong
As Heracles lay in his cot,  
Hera sent serpents to kill him. 
Even though he was only a  
baby, Heracles strangled  
them with his bare hands.

19
Eurystheus hated Heracles and  
wanted him dead.
“Your first task is to kill the lion, 
which is devouring the people of 
Nemea,” he commanded.
Athena guided 
Heracles in many 
of his tasks.
Heracles was 
called Hercules 
by the Romans.

The Nemean lion had skin that could 
not be pierced by weapons. So Heracles 
followed the lion to its cave and wrestled 
with it. After strangling it to death,  
he returned to Eurystheus, wearing  
the lion’s skin as armour.
Heracles successfully completed task 
after task. His eleventh task was to steal 
some golden apples 
that grew on a tree 
in a garden that  
was guarded by 
three maidens called 
the Hesperides  
[hes-PAIR-i-deez], 
along with a fierce 
serpent. 

21
After seeking advice from the gods, 
Heracles went first to the Hesperides’ 
father, Atlas. He was one of the Titans 
defeated long ago by Zeus. Atlas’s 
everlasting punishment was to hold  
up the heavens on his shoulders.
“If you ask your daughters for a 
couple of apples,” said Heracles,  
“I’ll hold up the heavens for a while.”
Heracles’ tasks included killing 
or capturing many of the fiercest 
mythical animals.

22
Atlas agreed but asked Heracles to 
kill the serpent first. Heracles did this  
by shooting a single arrow over the 
garden wall. He then took up Atlas’s 
burden. When Atlas returned with  
the apples, he did not want to take  
the heavens back. 
“I’d be delighted to 
continue,” said Heracles, 
“but could you just take 
them for a moment so 
that I can make  
a grassy cushion 
for my shoulder?”

23
When Atlas took the heavens back, 
Heracles picked up the apples and 
walked away, and 
went on to complete 
his twelfth labour.
Zeus was 
pleased. When 
Heracles died,  
he joined the 
gods on Mount 
Olympus and he  
became the guardian  
of the door to the 
heavens. v
Heracles’ twelfth 
labour was to go to the 
Underworld and bring 
back Hades’ three-
headed dog, Cerberus. 

24
Theseus and the Minotaur 
Just off the coast of 
Greece is an island called 
Crete. It was here, say  
the myths, that a most 
fearsome creature called the Minotaur 
lived during the reign of King Minos. 
The Mintoaur was half-man and  
half-bull and only ate human flesh.  
The beast was so terrible that the king 
commanded his greatest craftsman, 
Daedalus [DED-uh-lus] to build a 
labyrinth that no one could escape from.  
Bulls of Knossos
When the ancient 
palace of Knossos in 
Crete was excavated, 
images of bulls were found. Some think this proves 
that the ancient Cretans worshipped bulls. 
Greece
Crete

25
At the centre of this maze lived  
the Minotaur.
Every nine years, seven boys and 
seven girls were sent from Athens  
to be fed to the Minotaur. This was 
payment from the King of Athens, 
Aegeus [ay-GEE-us], for accidentally 
causing the death of Minos’s son  
 many years before.  
The third payment  
was now due.

26

27
In Athens, the victims were being 
selected. A young prince named Theseus 
offered to go and kill the Minotaur.  
He was the adopted son of 
Aegeus and the son of the  
sea-god Poseidon. 
The ship that Theseus took to 
Crete had black sails but the crew 
also took white sails with them. 
“If you succeed, raise the white sails 
on your return,” said Aegeus to his son.
When they arrived at Crete, the 
Athenians were met by King Minos and 
his daughter, Ariadne. She fell in love 
with Theseus at first sight. 
“I’ll help you kill the Minotaur if you 
take me back to Athens and make me 
your wife,” Ariadne said to Theseus.  
He agreed.

28
“Tie one end of this magical ball of 
thread to the entrance of the labyrinth 
and follow it to the centre,” Ariadne 
instructed. “Go at night while the 
Minotaur sleeps. After killing it, roll the 
thread back up and it will lead you out.”

29
That night, the glimmering thread 
led Theseus to the Minotaur, which he 
wrestled and killed. When he arrived 
back at the entrance, Ariadne and the 
Athenians were waiting. They boarded 
their ship and set sail for Athens. 
On the way, Theseus left Ariadne 
asleep on the island of Naxos because 
he did not love her. He also forgot to 
change the sails from black to white.  
When King Aegeus saw the black sails, 
he thought his son was dead and threw 
himself into the sea. 
Theseus’s triumphant 
return was 
overshadowed  
by grief. v

30
The fall of Icarus  
King Minos was furious that Theseus 
had succeeded in defeating the 
Minotaur. He put the inventor of  
the labyrinth, Daedalus, and his lazy 
son, Icarus, into prison. Daedalus 
started planning how to escape. 
He collected feathers from 
passing birds and made two pairs of 
wings by threading the feathers together 
and sealing them with wax from their 
candles. Finally, 
they were ready  
to escape.

31
“Put on these 
wings,” Daedalus 
told Icarus. “Follow me, and  
don’t fly too high or too low.” 
They both took flight over the sea. 
Icarus was careful at first, but then 
soared upwards, feeling free like a bird. 
The sun’s heat then melted his wings 
and he tumbled to his death. 
When Daedalus looked back for his 
son, he could see only feathers floating 
on the water. v

32
The adventures of Perseus 
There was a young man named Perseus, 
who lived with his beautiful mother, 
Danae [DAN-ay-ee], on the island of 
Seriphos [SEH-ri-fos]. The evil king, 
Polydectes, wanted to marry Danae  
but Perseus protected her. So Polydectes 
tricked Perseus into attempting an 
impossible task. 

33
Polydectes 
held a feast. 
Being poor, 
Perseus came 
without a gift  
but promised the king a present.
“Bring me the head of the Gorgon 
Medusa,” challenged Polydectes. 
The Gorgons were three fearsome, 
scaly monsters, who had snakes for hair. 
Anyone who looked at Medusa’s face 
turned to stone.

34
Perseus’s father was none other than 
Zeus. From Olympus, Zeus sent Athena 
and Hermes to help his son. They gave 
him the shiniest shield and the sharpest 
sickle in the world. 
Following their advice, Perseus then 
visited the nymphs of the North Wind. 
These female spirits lent him some 
winged sandals, 
a leather bag 
and Hades’ Cap 
of Invisibility.
Nymphs were female 
spirits who protected 
natural things such 
as mountains, valleys, 
rivers, trees, wind  
and rain.

35
Wearing the sandals and cap, Perseus 
flew unseen to the far west where he 
found the three Gorgons asleep. Looking 
only at Medusa’s reflection in the shield, 
he cut off her head with the sickle and 
put it into the bag.
The winged horse
When Perseus killed Medusa, a  
winged horse, Pegasus, sprang 
from her body. Another myth 
tells how a boy named Bellerophon 
tamed Pegasus, using Athena’s bridle.

36
As Perseus flew home, he saw a 
princess, Andromeda, chained to a rock, 
about to be eaten by a sea monster. Her 
parents had angered Poseidon, who had 
sent the monster to destroy their kingdom 
unless their daughter was sacrificed. 
Story in the stars
Some star patterns have been named 
after the characters in Perseus’s story. 
These include Perseus, Andromeda  
[an-DROM-ih-duh], her parents and 
the sea monster.

37
As the monster rose from the  
waves, Perseus held up Medusa’s  
head and turned the monster to stone. 
Perseus married Andromeda and took 
her back to Seriphos.
King Polydectes had made Danae a 
slave and was surprised to see Perseus.
“Where’s my gift?” he asked.
Without a word, Perseus held 
up the head of Medusa and 
turned the king to stone. v

Dionysus
The foolishness of Midas 
Not all myths are about heroes.  
Some tell of very foolish mortals who 
misused gifts from the gods. One such 
person was King Midas. 
One day, Midas found an old satyr 
called Silenus in his garden. Silenus  
was drunk after feasting with the  
god Dionysus [die-on-EYE-sus].
Satyr
38

39
Mischievous satyrs
Satyrs were roguish male spirits  
of nature who roamed the woods 
and mountains. They were half-
man and half-goat, and had horns, 
hooves and tails.
King Midas looked after Silenus very 
well and then returned him to Dionysus, 
who lived by the banks of the River 
Pactolus. In thanks, Dionysus promised 
Midas any gift he wanted.
“Let everything I touch turn to  
gold,” replied Midas, greedily.
His wish was granted. 

40
With delight, Midas turned 
his palace and all the trees and 
flowers in his garden to gold.
However, his pleasure was 
short-lived. As he picked up food and 
drank his wine, they also turned to gold. 
Then he hugged his daughter. To his 
horror, she turned to gold, too. 

41
Midas returned to Dionysus and 
begged to be freed from his gift. 
“Wash away your greed in the  
spring of the River Pactolus,” Dionysus 
told him. 
As Midas bathed in the river,  
the water turned to gold.
However, Midas had not learnt  
from his foolishness.

42
Apollo
Tmolus
Pan
Midas
Midas was a worshipper of Pan,  
the mischievous goatlike god of wild 
places. He enjoyed listening to Pan play 
country tunes on his reed pipes. 
One day, Pan boasted that he was a 
better musician than Apollo, the god of 
music, and challenged him to a contest. 

43
The contest was to be judged by the 
river god Tmolus [MO-lus]. Midas came 
along to listen and judge for himself. 
Pan’s merry tunes were no match for 
Apollo’s lilting lyre music and Tmolus 
awarded the prize to Apollo. However, 
Midas said he preferred Pan’s playing.  
In anger, Apollo gave Midas a pair of 
long, hairy donkey ears. Midas covered 
his ears in a turban, but people found 
out about them and he died of shame. v

44
Orpheus and Eurydice 
The myths claim that the most gifted 
musician who ever lived was Orpheus 
[OR-fee-us]. Orpheus was married to  
the beautiful Eurydice [you-RIH-dih-see], 
but their happiness was cut short when 
she was bitten by a serpent and died.
Filled with aching sorrow, 
Orpheus took his lute and 
travelled to the Underworld 
to try and get her back. On 
the shore of the River Styx, 
he met the ferryman who rowed dead 
souls to the gates of Hades’ kingdom. 
Orpheus played a sad song that charmed 
the ferryman into taking him across  
the river. At the gates, the watchdog, 
Cerberus, stood guard. Orpheus lulled  
the creature to sleep with a lullaby.

45
Music in his blood
Orpheus was the son of Apollo and 
the muse Calliope [CAL-eye-oh-pee]. 
There were nine muses, or goddesses 
of art, who were said to inspire 
poets, musicians, artists and writers.

46
As Orpheus made his way through 
the dark kingdom to see Hades, the 
sweet music he played soothed the 
screaming pain of the tormented souls. 
Hades was angry that a living person 
had entered his realm, but when 
Orpheus played his music, Hades 
wept iron tears. 

47
“Eurydice may follow you to the 
upper world,” Hades said, “on the 
condition that you don’t look at her 
until she has reached the sunlight.”
Orpheus made his way to the 
surface, playing joyful 
tunes. But, as he 
reached the sunlight, 
he looked back. 
For a moment, he 
saw Eurydice nearly 
alive again, almost at 
the entrance to the 
Underworld. Then 
she faded once more 
into a pale ghost  
and disappeared. 
Orpheus had lost  
her forever. v
