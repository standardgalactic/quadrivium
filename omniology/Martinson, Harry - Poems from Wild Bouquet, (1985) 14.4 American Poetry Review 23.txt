 Peonies
 Summer grew, broadened out;
 thickened into positive clumps.
 Dark-red farm peonies bulged in the rain.
 When they opened their firm-knotted rag balls, she came
 the lusty queen.
 She looked for heavy bouquets,
 luxuriant repasts for the senses.
 The greenery was wet. Life-wet was the summer-saga:
 She had prepared only for life, not for autumn.
 Deep in her flesh defiantly she knew
 that in time Death would wave to her
 with his banner of hay.
 Giant Pine B
 The giant pine: almost a forest in itself ^B
 with its own storm song. t^?
 Like everything in its own life but also all of life. j^H
 Alone in the noise of multitudes,
 itself a quantity of secret places and fates. |B
 Silent winters, haystackcloud summers, ^B
 pigeon and marten. ^B
 At its top often a thrush ^B
 that sings of the years, Bfl
 long and many, BB
 that go sweeping by. BB

Sphinx 
Moth 
And 
Daddy 
Longlegs 
In the evening when dark is settling down, the stately sphinx moth 
comes 
to the wild honeysuckle 
by the rock face. At dusk when 
one's 
impressions 
of color are blurred, it somewhat 
resembles 
a hummingbird 
in front of the flowers in a Brazilian 
forest glade. 
It has the same admir 
able ability with flickering intensity to stand still in the air, at which 
point the fantastic 
frequency of oscillation 
can no longer be perceived 
except as a cloud-image 
of whirling powder 
in the soft grey-white 
light. 
On 
its long trunk is a straw that appears 
to support and control the 
hovering 
level. 
It is like a flying, peaceful honey-stiletto, 
whose wings 
function with 
dizzying precision. When 
its long honey-stick 
has sucked up the secreted 
supply in the deep, narrow hiding places of the flower, it recoils an inch or 
more and then moves 
sideways 
to the next flower. 
For five or six evenings 
in a row it searches 
throughout 
the entire 
honeysuckle 
growth that covers almost half the rock face. 
The sphinx moth 
is among the twilight's noctuidae moths, 
those that 
have the firmest and most 
inviting appearance. 
It has none of the daddy 
longlegs' 
spooky 
thinness 
and 
endless 
long-legged 
vacillation. 
The 
sphinx moth always 
seems to have an errand, while the daddy 
longlegs 
seems always 
to be coming at random like a spindle-thin emaciated 
piece 
of wreckage, 
carried about by the wind. The placid, cautiously 
strutting 
daddy 
longlegs is thinner even than the harvester-beetle. 
But it exists, it 
feeds itself and manages 
as we do. When 
it is smashed 
by an impatient 
hand, it quietly collapses. 
Then 
its remains mark 
the wall 
like a Chinese 
ink-drawn character, 
its legs stretched out like a lingering fragment in 
the frozen billows of death. 
And there outside 
the wall flies the sphinx moth with its proud, lynx 
marked 
body. And men, who are so far removed 
from insects, try to 
bring their thoughts 
into harmony with them, but they never can. 
Mystery 
seeps through all the crevices, and the clocks tick on. Reality 
arches itself in the mind as in a crucible. Man, 
the seeker, seeks himself. 
Tropical 
Myth 
Rain 
cast its net over the forest, 
caught drought's 
demon. 
Lightning held high its lantern, 
flickered, went out, was 
lit again 
until it was all over and the trees shook off the moisture. 
Everything 
became 
clear again. 
The apes wove 
the ascending moon 
into a loose-braided 
basket 
of lianas. 
The moon 
escaped 
but dropped 
embers 
on the buzzarding 
caraya monkeys 
in the branches 
of the mora 
trees: 
That 
is how fireflies were born. 
Between 
Shadows 
Between 
shadows 
oscillating 
like pointers 
light spots wander 
forth. 
In the glade of a July day they animate 
the creatures 
scuttling amid the mini-world's 
tussocks. 
In between 
the straw stalks 
the very ground of summer speaks of dangerous 
things. 
Every minute 
a thousand 
small events 
occur quickly and cautiously: 
The 
leaves blink in the trees. 
Loose 
Leaves 
i 
All 
is so still and distinctly 
resonant 
this night in clear spring. 
In the bog the lapwing builds 
its lectern: twigs and branches 
crisscrossed. 
For three months 
she will be the bog's weather 
sibyl 
and will predict the rains that will fall over the field's scarecrow 
in whose 
rags red ants live. 
But 
first she lays at the top three eggs 
a bit larger than a dove's. 
ii 
The knot in the twig 
and the alder leaves' nerves: 
they exist for me 
and I am the song spoken at the expense 
of the earth. 
Bent 
like a servant 
I walk 
through the kitchen of the spruce grove 
on an evening 
in midge-filled 
June? 
and there quietly and gratefully 
taste the sorrel's leaves 
as if they were already a soup. 
iii 
Now 
the poplar 
shakes off the rain and the sky clears, O vast 
land! 
Scent of rain and scent of poplars, 
vast 
land! One absorbs 
you through the nose, vast 
land, 
and the happy fellow asks: did the lapwing not foretell this yesterday? 
O vast land, and the rain-laden 
rye moving 
with raindrop-eyes 
in billows across 
the field on a mission 
of trade. 
To breathe 
in your nurturing aromas, O land! 
iv 
A bell wanders 
tonight across 
the glades 
over the forests for miles: 
the black woodpecker's 
echoing sound. 
He awakens 
a fox, 
and the moss-covered 
block by the den's black eye 
gazes 
treacherously 
into its shadow 
but the sun's lizard-like glimpse 
is climbing the aspen's 
trunk. 
The 
lingonberries 
are in their youth. 
v 
In the heat where the rye stands wearing 
its driest cornflower dress 
the grasshopper 
has rested its days ah, so lightly 
on the toylike gloss of the neck. 
For the ear that cannot see 
but speaks 
to the inner eye, 
small amber cymbals 
stir in the shrill light 
and keep clicking: summer still! summer still! summer still! 
while the rye sighs of harvest. 
vi 
Misty 
evening 
in the glowworm months: 
shocks of grain in the field. 
Field mice 
run between 
them 
like kids between houses 
on long streets. 
But 
it soon quiets down and everyone 
sleeps. A further change: 
fog lays a hand on the waist 
of each sheaf, 
then dances 
out with it over the soaked and smoky floors.

The Heron 
In pure autumn, 
the air is clear. 
God 
is breathed 
from the tree with every breath; 
the spring is 
stained yellow, 
and henna bleeds 
from the cut alder. 
The grey heron stood here one morning; 
stood in repose as the crane stands 
directly under the fog's light water veils. 
I watched 
it as it stood, 
unaware 
of all that has happened 
and all that has altered the world's 
vision. 
Frightened 
by the train's iron rumble beyond 
the mist, 
the heron fled with dignity 
as the train approached, 
oblivious, 
elegant, peaceful 
and wild. 
On Harry 
Martinson 
Poets 
lead notoriously 
difficult lives, but surely few poets anywhere 
have 
begun 
life under more 
trying circumstances 
than Harry 
Martinson. 
When 
his alcoholic, 
sea-faring father died in 1910, his mother 
fled to California, 
leaving the six-year-old 
Harry, 
along with her four 
other youngest 
children, to public welfare. After humiliating 
years with 
his guardians, 
he ran away to sea at the age of fourteen, and from 1920 to 
1927 
shipped 
out fourteen times, serving under 
the flags of various 
nations, 
in his words, 
"as deckhand, 
stoker, coaltrimmer 
and all-round 
kitchen menace 
on eighteen 
ships, sometimes 
bumming 
around 
in the 
ports of the world, hiking for thousands 
of miles, 
especially 
in India, on 
the European 
continent, and in the Americas.'' 
Having 
acquired 
tuber 
culosis 
at sea, he came ashore 
for good, and his disease 
was 
arrested. 
Like Melville, 
whom he resembles 
in many ways, he spent the remainder 
of his life making 
use of these early experiences 
in his work. His 
first 
travel books, 
collected 
in English 
in one volume Cape Farewell 
(1934), 
won him wide acclaim, 
as did his fictionalized 
autobiography 
Flowering 
Nettle (1935; English translation, 1936). In Passad (Trade 
Winds) (1945) 
he abandoned 
travelling 
in an outward 
sense; 
instead 
he travelled 
inwardly, seeking the ties between 
the extrovert 
traveller, the "world 
nomad," 
and the brooding 
introvert. The 
former sailor employed 
the 
concept of "trade wind" 
as a unifying symbol. "There exists something 
universally 
compelling 
that cannot yet be pinned down 
in a material 
way, 
' ' he wrote. 
*' 
The wind is a good symbol of this, and among the winds 
the trade wind 
is the best symbol of human 
reasonableness 
and of the 
human desire for airing things. It symbolizes 
a mental 
state that takes 
the sea atmosphere 
as a model, 
its openness 
uniting with the eye's open 
ness for new vistas 
and new lands." The metaphor 
of travel acquired 
a 
new dimension 
in Martinson's 
epic poem v4mara (1956), which 
tells of a 
giant spaceship 
hurtling through the universe on an irreversible journey 
with 8,000 
evacuees 
on board, after technological 
man 
has made 
the 
earth uninhabitable 
and all imaginative possibilities 
have been neglected 
or rejected. 
In 1949 Martinson 
was elected to the Swedish Academy 
and 
in 1974 he shared the Nobel Prize for literature with Eyvind 
Johnson. He 
died four years later. 
Martinson's 
novel The Road 
(1948; English 
translation, 
1955) pre 
ceded Jack Kerouac's 
On the Road, 
and although 
it shares perhaps 
the 
latter book's 
impetus of protest against 
the evils of organized 
society, it 
is wholly different. The guiding 
spirit of Martinson's 
novel is a central 
intelligence, a focus of feeling that gives 
form to the wanderer's 
life. At 
the core of this intelligence 
is nature 
itself: 
There were a thousand reasons why one walked the highways year after year. 
One of the loveliest of those reasons was the woods, the forest. The woods had 
a way of hiding themselves behind themselves from tree to tree, from ridge to 
ridge, and of never ceasing to give promise of something hidden. Associated 
with the woods was a great and hopeless attraction. There was no banishing it, 
for if you tried to drive it away, it merely flitted like a bird from tree to tree, 
called like a cuckoo or whistled like a thrush.... 
If you went into the forest as 
a child, idly, or just to pick berries or to look for strayed cows, then the whole 
forest 
stepped 
forward, 
closed 
round 
you, 
poured 
its waves 
over you, 
and you 
were caught, at once terrified and expectant. The forest by its constant change 
of shape and sound persuaded the wanderer who walked in it that he must ever 
expect something, darkly urging upon him foreboding after foreboding, 
presentiment 
after presentiment, 
without 
end.* 
* The Road 
by Harry Martinson, 
translated from the Swedish by M.A. 
Michael, New York: 1955, pp. 51-53. 
Early 
in his career Martinson 
abandoned 
private 
symbolism 
and 
experience 
in his poetry for the largest theme of all, nature. He allied 
himself with a fine Swedish 
tradition that began even before the time of 
Linnaeus 
(1707-1778). 
As Lars Gyllensten 
points 
out, Martinson 
is 
similar to the famous botanist 
in his 
4'deeply original 
ingenuity, his 
sensitive 
and unconventional 
alertness 
and attentiveness 
and also his 
humorous, 
unsentimental, 
and tender identification with the shape and 
form of every living thing/ 
' From a few square 
feet of the natural 
scene 
that the poet studies and observes, he finds his way to a broad, and even 
cosmic, perspective 
and to a magnanimous 
philosophy 
of life. 
In View from a Tussock 
(1963), Martinson 
complains 
that the descrip 
tion of natural 
scenery is subjected 
to constant 
critical attack. The fact 
that such description 
in Sweden 
has a long, fine tradition antedating 
Linnaeus 
does not mean 
that "nature 
prose" 
or "nature 
lyrics" have 
found acceptance 
as a genre or even as a sub-genre. On the contrary, 
such writing is always suspect. Martinson 
feels that anyone who persists 
in depicting 
the natural 
scene and who becomes 
absorbed 
by the prob 
lems of ecology will a priori belong 
to an artistic minority. And a book 
concerned with nature, he points out, is usually 
reviewed 
in Sweden 
by 
scientists 
in order to make clear that it is distinctly different from belles 
lettres. Martinson 
gives 
a characteristically 
modest 
definition 
of a 
"nature 
writer": 
He is an artist capable of expressing old simple truths in a way that makes 
them seem fresh: he can say that grass is green, that the cuckoo sings, that the 
sun glitters on the water. To achieve this one needs patience, sensitivity and 
the desire and ability to transport oneself into the special serene state ?f mind 
that in each instance is needed to attain an artistic-analytical contact with 
natural 
phenomena. 
Such 
a state, Martinson 
maintains, 
can be reached 
only "through 
solitude 
and silence." 
In his view 
the nature writer 
should 
research, 
study, observe 
and describe 
nature 
and not merely 
identify with 
it 
(except in the most general 
sense) or use it only to express private 
sym 
bolism or the happenings 
of an internal kind. What 
he may 
lose in inti 
macy 
or ambiguity 
through his research 
is more 
than compensated 
for 
by the exactitude 
with which he records every detail. 
In Martinson's 
view there exist no boundaries 
between descriptions 
of nature and belles 
lettres: 
Our 
encounter 
with 
nature 
is an encounter 
with 
life, with 
what 
is. If anyone 
knew 
what 
art was, 
it would 
be 
intolerable, 
and 
if we knew 
what 
nature 
was, 
that might be just as intolerable. What we meet in nature is its mystery, and in 
approaching 
it, a measure 
of what 
might 
be called 
"shyness" 
is required. 
. . . 
One who depicts nature should advance toward what he wishes to describe 
with deer-shy sensitivity. It won't do to lock the description into heavy, 
cumbersome 
facts. 
Throughout 
his nature poems 
the senses are brought constantly 
into 
play: the leaves "blink in the trees," the swan eats its way through the 
"putrid 
velvet 
of sludge," 
the butterflies 
"in voluminous 
oriental 
shawls" 
listen to the rays of the moon, 
the long jersey of the snake's 
skin 
"shines 
white 
in the forest." What 
the senses 
retain, time does not 
dissipate: 
When we cut firewood in the late autumn forest 
many things happened that the senses preserved, 
things that lay down in memory, fueling it with their own 
shiny birch bark; 
that part of the firewood never went up in smoke. 
The natural world that the poems present is without a human presence 
and yet humanity 
is everywhere 
implied: the cuckoo will "auction 
off his 
bankrupt 
estate" 
and soon "board out his son"; the beach tussock plays 
and quivers with "a blue salt note" for its ocean master; 
the rows of cab 
bage heads 
"puff into their chubby selves"; 
"Life and Death, 
the two 
great squanderers/play 
a bold game at night." Natural 
objects 
are seen 
in terms of human 
accoutrements: 
the grebe's 
head 
turns almost 
full 
circle "like a bright weathervane"; 
the island floats forth, "a ship with a 
rigging of oaks"; 
the wing sheathing 
of junebugs 
is muted 
"like Indian 
brass"; 
an errant boulder 
is "a sturdy cupboard with the key turned on 
the inside and with moss 
in the lock." A humor akin to that of Christian 
Morgenstern 
adds a human dimension: 
"everyone named Otto" 
believes 
that "the cuckoo is calling him"; Santa Claus, 
"the nursery's Rasputin," 
shakes 
"his cotton-wad 
beard/and 
high-booted 
forces his way 
into 
everybody's 
heart." When 
the naked mushroom 
in autumn offers up his 
"erect bun," we are made 
to witness 
a hilarious 
erotic scene. When 
a 
human speaker does appear 
in the poems 
it is as a servant of the natural 
world: 
Bent like a servant I walk through the kitchen of the spruce grove. 
At the center of nature, Martinson 
always reminds us, is man: "Man, 
the 
seeker, is seeking himself." 
There 
is in Martinson's 
quiet, probing, 
sensitive approach 
something 
akin to the attitude of reverence of the American 
Indian, for whom 
the 
earth, in all its manifestations, 
is holy: 
The knot in the twig 
and the alder leaves ' nerves: they exist for me 
and I am the sun spoken at the expense of the earth. 
This reverence accounts 
for the openness 
of the poems 
to which Robert
