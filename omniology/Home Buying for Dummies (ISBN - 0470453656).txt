Making Everything Easier!™


Praise for Previous Editions of Home 
Buying For Dummies
“It is absolutely practical. They cover the basics in straightforward language 
and go into enough detail to make them the only books 
you’ll need.”
 
— Eric Antonow, President and CEO, Katabat Corporation
“As a fi rst-time home buyer, I found this book to be a quick read and 
immensely helpful in knowing what to ask my agent, what to look for on 
walk-throughs, what to expect in terms of offers and counteroffers, as well 
as the entire timeline and process from open house to moving in. This 
book really is invaluable to anyone purchasing a home, even if you’re not a 
fi rst-time home buyer.”
 
— Travis A. Wise, San Jose, CA
“Because I bought this book, I was able to carry on intelligent conversations 
with my agent and lender when I recently purchased a home. Even better, 
I felt prepared for those conversations and much more in control of the 
situation than I would have had I not read this book. Thanks to the authors 
for doing such a great job!”
 
— Jeff C. Benson, Lake Zurich, IL
 “I never bought real estate in my life. I never shopped for a mortgage in my 
life. But after reading this book I am extremely well prepared when I call them 
and when they walk through the door to meet with me.”
 
— Ben Milano, Lindenhurst, NY
 “If you are considering buying a home, don’t fail to read this excellent new 
book. The book is full of profi table ‘insider tips’ which most real estate writers 
either don’t know or are afraid to reveal. The advice is so good I wish I had 
written it . . . on my scale of 1 to 10, this outstanding book rates a 12.”
 
— Robert J. Bruss, Tribune Media Services
“ . . . Home Buying For Dummies immediately earned a prominent spot on my 
reference bookshelf . . . takes a holistic approach to home buying.”  
 
— Broderick Perkins, San Jose Mercury News
“ . . . invaluable information, especially for the fi rst-time home buyer . . .”    
 
— Carol Nuckols, Fort Worth Star-Telegram

Here’s what critics have said about Eric Tyson and his 
previous national bestselling personal finance guides:
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty 
about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the 
publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control. My 
college-aged daughters even enjoyed reading it!”
 
— Karen Tofte, producer, National Public Radio’s 
Sound Money
“Among my favorite fi nancial guides are . . . Eric Tyson’s Personal Finance For 
Dummies.”
 
— Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal
“Smart advice for dummies . . . skip the tomes . . . and buy Personal Finance For 
Dummies, which rewards your candor with advice and comfort.”
 
— Temma Ehrenfeld, Newsweek
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at all 
income levels to take control of their fi nancial futures. This book is a natural 
outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like Henry Ford, 
he wants to make something that was previously accessible only to the 
wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
 
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestseller Built 
to Last; Lecturer in Business, Stanford Graduate School of 
Business
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a . . . For Dummies book. He 
doesn’t tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the why’s 
and how’s — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . It will lead 
you through the thickets of your own fi nances as painlessly as I can imagine.”
 
— Clarence Peterson, Chicago Tribune
“Personal Finance For Dummies is, by far, the best book I have read on fi nancial 
planning. It is a simplifi ed volume of information that provides tremendous 
insight and guidance into the world of investing and other money issues.”
 
— Althea Thompson, producer, “PBS Nightly Business Report”

About the Authors
Eric Tyson is a syndicated personal fi nancial writer, lecturer, and counselor. 
He is dedicated to teaching people to manage their personal fi nances better. 
Eric is a former management consultant to Fortune 500 fi nancial service 
fi rms. Over the past two decades, he has successfully invested in securities 
as well as in real estate, started and managed several growing businesses, 
and earned a bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale and an MBA at the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business.
An accomplished freelance personal fi nance writer, Eric is the author of fi ve 
other national bestsellers in the For Dummies series: Personal Finance For 
Dummies, Investing For Dummies, Mutual Funds For Dummies, Real Estate 
Investing For Dummies (which he coauthored), and Taxes For Dummies 
(which he also coauthored). Eric was an award-winning journalist for The San 
Francisco Chronicle/Examiner. His work has been featured and praised in hun-
dreds of national and local publications, including Newsweek, Kiplinger’s, The 
Wall Street Journal, Money, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and on NBC’s 
Today Show, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, The Oprah Winfrey Show, 
ABC, CNBC, Bloomberg Business Radio, CBS National Radio, and National 
Public Radio.
Eric has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of personal fi nance, 
investment, and real estate quandaries and questions. In addition to main-
taining a fi nancial counseling practice, he is a much sought after speaker.
You can visit him on the Web at www.erictyson.com.
Ray Brown is a veteran of the real estate profession with more than three 
decades of hands-on experience. A former manager for Coldwell Banker 
Residential Brokerage Company, McGuire Real Estate, and Pacifi c Union 
GMAC Real Estate, as well as a founder of his own real estate fi rm, the 
Raymond Brown Company, Ray is currently a writer, consultant, and public 
speaker on residential real estate topics.
Ray knows that most people are pretty darn smart. When they have prob-
lems, it’s usually because they don’t know the right questions to ask to get 
the information they need to make good decisions themselves. He always 
wanted to write a book that focused on what you need to know to make 
sound home-buying decisions — a book that kept people from manipulating 
you by exploiting your ignorance. This, at last, is that book!
On his way to becoming a real estate guru, Ray worked as the real estate 
analyst for KGO-TV (ABC’s affi liate in San Francisco) and was a syndicated 
real estate columnist for The San Francisco Examiner. For 16 years he hosted 
a weekly radio program, Ray Brown on Real Estate, for KNBR. In addition to 
his work for ABC, Ray has appeared as a real estate expert on CNN, NBC, CBS, 
and in The Wall Street Journal and Time.
That’s all fi ne and good. Ray’s three proudest achievements, however, are 
Jeff and Jared, his two extraordinary sons, and over 43 years of nearly always 
wedded bliss to the always wonderful Annie B. He’s delighted that Jeff’s wife, 
Genevieve, and his grandson, Aidan Joseph Brown, have joined the family.


Dedications
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as 
well as to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have taught 
me everything I know about how to explain fi nancial terms and strategies so 
that all of us may benefi t. — Eric Tyson
This book is lovingly dedicated to my real estate pals who taught me how 
the game is played; to my clients and friends who honor me with their trust 
and loyalty; to my brother Steve and best buddy Ben Colwell, who made 
RBCo a reality; to Bruce Koon and Corrie Anders, who taught me the dubious 
joy of writing; to Warren Doane and Dennis Tarmina, who encouraged me 
to follow this dream; to both brother Daves and Bob Agnew for being there; 
and, saving the best for last, to Annie B., Jeff, Genevieve, Jared, and Aidan, 
who have cheerfully (most of the time, anyhow) put up with the “Ray way” all 
these years. — Ray Brown

Introduction
W
elcome to Home Buying For Dummies, 4th Edition!
For about the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can quickly and 
easily discover how to save thousands — perhaps even tens of thousands — 
of dollars the next time you buy a home.
How can we make such a claim? Easy. Each of us has spent decades person-
ally advising thousands of people like you about home purchases and other 
important financial decisions. We’ve seen how ignorance of basic concepts 
and practices translates into money-draining mistakes. We know that many 
of these mistakes are both needless and avoidable.
 
No one is born knowing how to buy a home. Everyone who’d like to buy a 
home must learn how to do it. Unfortunately, too many people get a crash 
course in the school of hard knocks — and learn by making costly mistakes 
at their own expense.
We know that you’re not a dummy. You’ve already demonstrated an interest 
in discovering more about home buying by selecting this book, which can 
help you make smart moves and avoid financial land mines.
In the event that you’re still wondering whether to buy this book, consider 
that buying a home may well be the largest purchase that you ever make. If 
you’re like most people, buying a home can send shock waves through your 
personal finances and may even cause a sleepless night or two. Buying a 
home is a major financial step and a life event for most people. It certainly 
was for us when we bought our first homes. You owe it to yourself to do 
things right.
About This Book: The Eric Tyson/Ray 
Brown Difference
We know that many home-buying books are competing for your attention. If 
the fact that our families are counting on you to purchase this book doesn’t 
sway you, here are several other compelling reasons why this is the best 
book for you:

2
Home Buying For Dummies, 4th Edition 
 
✓ It’s in plain English. Because we work with real people and answer 
real questions, our information is current, and we have a great deal of 
experience in explaining things. This experience can put you firmly in 
control of the home-buying process (rather than having it control you).
 
✓ It’s objective. We’re not trying to sell you an expensive newsletter or 
some real estate product that you don’t need. Our goal is to make you 
as knowledgeable as possible before you purchase a home. We even 
explain why you may not want to buy a home. We’re not here to be real 
estate cheerleaders.
 
✓ It’s holistic. When you purchase a home, that purchase affects your 
ability to save money and accomplish other important financial goals. 
We help you understand how best to fit your home acquisition into the 
rest of your personal-finance plan.
 
✓ It’s a reference. You can read this book from cover to cover if you want. 
However, we know that you’re busy and that you likely don’t desire to 
become a real estate expert, so each portion of the book stands on its 
own. You can read it piecemeal to address your specific questions and 
immediate concerns.
Conventions Used in This Book
Every book has its own conventions, and this one is no different. To make the 
most of the information we provide, keep your eye out for these conventions:
 
✓ Italics highlight new terms that we define.
 
✓ Boldfaced text indicates the keywords in explanatory bulleted lists.
 
✓ Monofont sets Web addresses apart.
In addition, you can safely skip text in gray-shaded sidebars without missing 
anything you need to know. Sidebars contain plenty of helpful information, 
but the information they contain isn’t crucial to your understanding of the 
topic at hand.
How This Book Is Organized
So you’re ready to buy a home. Or maybe you know that you’re not ready, 
but you see a home purchase somewhere on the not-too-distant horizon. 
This book starts with the premise that many important things should fall 

3
 Introduction
into place before you sign a contract to buy a home. And even after the 
deal is done, you’ll have questions. Fear not! Our book covers what you need 
to know.
Part I: Home Economics
Perplexed about whether or not to buy a home? Concerned that your finan-
cial house isn’t as neat and tidy as it should be? Don’t know what you can 
afford or how you’ll pay for it? This part is for you! Many prospective home 
buyers make the mistake of buying before they understand their financial 
options and the home-buying process. As a bonus in this part, we explain 
real estate market economics, and we tell you how to spot a buyer’s market 
(good values) and avoid the perils of a seller’s market (inflated prices).
Part II: Financing 101
One of the most challenging and important aspects of the home-buying 
process is choosing a mortgage. Although not quite as jargon-prone as an 
Internal Revenue Service auditor, most mortgage lenders do have a penchant 
for using terminology — such as negative amortization and points — that 
you probably don’t use in your daily life. In this important part, we explain 
the different types of mortgages and cut through all that jargon to help 
you select the type of mortgage that matches your needs. We discuss the 
importance of your credit score, how to understand it, and even how to 
improve it. In addition to explaining how to get the best deal that you can on 
a mortgage, we guide you through the morass of paperwork required to 
apply for and obtain your loan.
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices
After you decide that you’re ready to buy and you know how much you can 
really afford (given your budget and other financial objectives), you’re ready 
to explore how the home-buying game is played. In this part, we introduce 
you to the various types of property you may consider buying and the people 
you may hire to help you buy a home. In addition to steering you toward 
winning strategies and players, we help you avoid loser properties and 
people. We give you a crash course on how to distinguish good buys from 
overpriced duds so that you don’t overpay (and may even get a very good 
deal) when you purchase your dream home. We also explain how to harness 
the power of the Internet and tell you which realty Web sites are worth 
your time.

4
Home Buying For Dummies, 4th Edition 
Part IV: Making the Deal
In this part, we get down to brass tacks — how to negotiate a super deal and 
how to get your home inspected from roof to foundation so that you know 
whether it’s in perfect shape or riddled with expensive defects. Because you 
can’t close the purchase until you get homeowners insurance, we explain 
what to buy, where to buy, and how to buy it right. Finally, we describe some 
of the legal and tax ramifications of your purchase, along with ways to make 
sure that your deal closes smoothly and without unnecessary costs.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this part, we tackle shorter topics that don’t seem to fit elsewhere in this 
book. Here, we list the ten financial musts after you buy, the ten things to 
know when investing in real estate, and the ten things to consider when 
selling your house.
Part VI: Appendixes
Besides showing you a good home-inspection report, this part also provides 
a sample home-buying contract so you’ll be familiar with these documents. 
Finally, we provide you a comprehensive glossary in case you can’t quite 
remember what a certain real estate word or phrase means.
Icons Used in This Book
Sprinkled throughout this book are cute little icons to help reinforce and 
draw attention to key points or to flag stuff that you can skip.
 
This bull’s-eye notes key strategies that can improve your real estate deal 
and, in some cases, save you lots of moola. Think of these as helpful little 
paternalistic hints we would whisper in your ear if we were close enough to 
do so!
 
Numerous land mines await novice as well as experienced home buyers. 
This explosive symbol marks those mines, and then we tell you how to 
sidestep them.

5
 Introduction
 
Occasionally, we suggest that you do more research or homework. Don’t 
worry: We tell you exactly what you need to do.
 
Unfortunately, as is the case in all parts of the business world, some people 
and companies are more interested in short-term profits than in meeting your 
needs and concerns. We warn you how, when, and where you may be fleeced, 
and where appropriate, we show you how to de-fleece yourself!
 
“If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times . . . .” Remember good old 
Mom and Dad? From time to time, we tell you something quite important and 
perhaps repeat ourselves. Just so you don’t forget the point, this icon serves 
as a little nag to bring back those childhood memories.
 
Some of you are curious and have time to spare. Others are busy and just 
want to know the essentials. This geeky icon points out tidbits and informa-
tion that you don’t really have to know, but understanding this stuff can make 
you more self-confident and proud!
Where to Go from Here
Odds are you’re not quite ready to bolt over to the nearest bank and take out 
a mortgage — and we don’t suggest that you blindly call the first Realtor in 
the Yellow Pages. It’s up to you where you go from here, but if you’re just 
beginning to think about buying your first home, we recommend that you 
read this book straight through, cover to cover, to maximize your home-
buying savvy. But the A-to-Z approach isn’t necessary — if you feel pretty 
confident in your knowledge of certain areas, pick other ones that you’re 
most interested in by either skimming this book’s table of contents or by 
relying on the well-crafted index at the back of the book.

s home buying for you? Is now the right time? How 
much can you afford to spend on a home? These 
questions aren’t meant to throw you into a panic. If you 
don’t know how to answer them (and perhaps even if you 
think that you do), this part is for you! Many people 
assume that they need to buy a home (or that they don’t) 
without taking a good look at their overall personal 
financial situation. Don’t make that mistake! Read this part 
to see how a home purchase should fit into your financial 
puzzle and to understand how and why home prices do 
what they do.

Chapter 1
Deciding Whether to Buy
In This Chapter
▶ Considering the pros and cons of owning and renting
▶ Avoiding common mistakes when deciding to buy or rent
E
very month, week, and day, we buy things large and small: lunch, a new 
pair of shoes, and every now and then, a car.
Most people buy things without doing much comparison shopping, but 
instead draw upon their past experiences. When the counter help at the 
nearby coffeehouse is friendly and you like the brew, you go back for more.
Sometimes purchases lead you by association to related purchases. You get 
a pet cat or dog, for instance, and buying a collar and pet toys may naturally 
follow. By the same token, you buy a home, and before long you have a new 
television and gardening gloves.
You end up being really happy with some items you purchase. Others fall 
short of your expectations . . . or worse. When the items in question don’t 
cost you much, it’s no big deal. Perhaps you return them or simply don’t buy 
more in the future. But when it comes to buying a home, that kind of sloppy 
shopping can lead to financial and emotional disaster.
If you’re not willing to invest time, and if you don’t work with and heed the 
advice of the best people, you could end up overpaying for a home you 
hate. Our goals in this book are simple: to ensure that you’re happy with the 
home you buy, that you get the best deal you can, and that owning the home 
helps you accomplish your financial goals.
Weighing the Advantages 
of Owning versus Renting
Nearly everyone seems to have an opinion about buying a home. People in 
the real estate business — including agents, lenders, property inspectors, 
and other related people — endorse homeownership. Of course, why 

10
Part I: Home Economics 
wouldn’t they? Their livelihoods depend upon it! Therein lies one funda-
mental problem of nearly all home-buying books written by people who 
have a vested interest in convincing their readers to buy a home.
 
Homeownership isn’t for everyone. One of our objectives in this chapter is to 
help you determine whether home buying is right for you.
Consider the case of Peter, who thought that owning a home was the best 
financial move he could make. What with tax write-offs and living in a place 
while it made money for him, how could he lose? Peter envied his colleagues 
at work who’d seemingly made piles of money with property they bought 
years ago. Peter was a busy man and didn’t have time to research other ways 
to invest his money.
Unfortunately, Peter bought a place that stretched his budget and required 
lots of attention and maintenance. Adding insult to injury, Peter went to 
graduate school clear across the country (something he knew he was likely 
to do at the time he bought) three years after he purchased. During these 
three years of his ownership, home prices dropped 10 percent in Peter’s 
neighborhood. So after paying the expenses of sale and closing costs, Peter 
ended up losing his entire down payment when he sold.
Conversely, some people who continue to rent should buy. In her 20s, 
Melody didn’t want to buy a home, because she didn’t like the idea of settling 
down. Her monthly rent seemed so cheap compared with the sticker prices 
on homes for sale.
As it always does, time passed. Melody’s 20s turned into 30s, which melted 
into 40s and then 50s, and she was still renting. Her rent skyrocketed to eight 
times what it was when she first started renting — that insignificant $150 
monthly rent was now over $1,200 per month. Even with the late 2000s real 
estate price declines, home prices really seemed out of sight compared with 
three decades earlier. She fearfully looked ahead to escalating rental rates in 
the decades when she hoped to be retired.
Ownership advantages
Most people should eventually buy homes, but not everyone and not at 
every point in their lives. To decide whether now’s the time for you to buy, 
consider the advantages of buying and whether they apply to you.
Owning should be less expensive than renting
You probably didn’t appreciate it growing up, but in addition to the diaper 
changes, patience during potty training, help with homework, bandaging 
bruised knees, and countless meals, your folks made sure that you had a roof 
over your head. Most of us take shelter for granted, unless we don’t have it or 
are confronted for the first time with paying for it ourselves.

11
 Chapter 1: Deciding Whether to Buy
Remember your first apartment when you graduated from college or when 
your folks finally booted you out? That place probably made you appreciate 
the good deal you had before — even those cramped college dormitories 
may have seemed more attractive!
But even if you pay several hundred to a thousand dollars or more per month 
in rent, that expense may not seem so steep if you happen to peek at a 
home for sale. In most parts of the U.S., we’re talking about a big number — 
$150,000, $225,000, $350,000, or more for the sticker price. (Of course, if 
you’re a medical doctor, lawyer, management consultant, or investment 
banker, you probably think that you can’t find a habitable place to live for 
less than a half-million dollars, especially if you live in costly places such as 
New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, or San Francisco.)
 
Here’s a guideline that may change the way you view your seemingly cheap 
monthly rent. To figure out the price of a home you could buy for approxi-
mately the same monthly cost as your current rent, simply do the following 
calculation:
Take your monthly rent and multiply by 200, and you come up with the 
purchase price of a home.
$ _________ per month 
x 
200 = $ ________________
Example: $ 1,000 
x 
200 = $200,000
So in the preceding example, if you were paying rent of $1,000 per month, you 
would pay approximately the same amount per month to own a $200,000 
home (factoring in tax savings). Now your monthly rent doesn’t sound quite 
so cheap compared with the cost of buying a home, does it? (Note that in 
Chapter 3 we show you how to accurately calculate the total costs of owning 
a home.)
 
Even more important than the cost today of buying versus renting is the cost 
in the future. As a renter, your rent is fully exposed to increases in the cost of 
living, also known as inflation. A reasonable expectation for annual increases 
in your rent is 4 percent per year. Figure 1-1 shows what happens to a $1,000 
monthly rent at just 4 percent annual inflation.
When you’re in your 20s or 30s, you may not be thinking or caring about your 
golden years, but look what happens to your rent over the decades ahead 
with just modest inflation! Then remember that paying $1,000 rent per month 
now is the equivalent of buying a home for $200,000. Well, in 40 years, with 4 
percent inflation per year, your $1,000-per-month rent will balloon to $4,800 
per month. That’s like buying a house for $960,000!

In our example, we picked $1,000 for rent to show you what happens to that 
rent with a modest 4 percent annual rate of inflation. To see what may 
happen to your current rent at that rate of inflation (as well as at a slightly 
higher one), simply complete Table 1-1.

If you’re middle-aged or retired, you may not plan on having 40 to 60 years 
ahead of you. On the other hand, don’t underestimate how many more years 
of housing you’ll need. U.S. health statistics indicate that at age 50, you have a 
life expectancy of nearly 30 more years, and at age 65, nearly 20 more years.
Although the cost of purchasing a home generally increases over the years, 
after you purchase a home, the bulk of your housing costs aren’t exposed to 
inflation if you use a fixed-rate mortgage to finance the purchase. As we 
explain in Chapter 6, a fixed-rate mortgage locks your mortgage payment in at 
a fixed amount (as opposed to an adjustable-rate mortgage payment that fluc-
tuates in value with changes in interest rates). Therefore, only the compara-
tively smaller property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses will 
increase over time with inflation. (In Chapter 3, we cover in excruciating 
detail what buying and owning a home costs.)
 
You’re always going to need a place to live. And over the long term, inflation 
has almost always been around. Even if you must stretch a little to buy a home 
today, in the decades ahead, you’ll be glad that you did. The financial danger 
with renting long term is that all your housing costs (rent) increase over time. 
We’re not saying that everyone should buy because of inflation, but we do 
think that if you’re not going to buy, you should be careful to plan your 
finances accordingly. We discuss the pros and cons of renting later in this 
chapter.
You can make your house your own
Think back to all the places you ever rented, including the rental in which 
you may currently be living. For each unit, make a list of the things you really 
didn’t like that you could have changed if the property were yours: ugly car-
peting, yucky exterior paint job, outdated appliances that didn’t work well, 
and so on.
Although we know some tenants who actually do some work on their own 
apartments, we don’t generally endorse this approach, because it takes your 
money and time but financially benefits the building’s owner. If, through per-
sistence and nagging, you can get your landlord to make the improvements 
and repairs at her expense, great! Otherwise, you’re out of luck or cash!

14
Part I: Home Economics 
When you own your own place, however, you can do whatever you want to it. 
Want hardwood floors instead of ugly, green shag carpeting? Tear it out. Love 
neon-orange carpeting and pink exterior paint? You can add it!
 
In your zest and enthusiasm to buy a place and make it your own, be careful of 
two things:
Uses for the wealth you build up in your home
Over the many years that you’re likely to own it, 
your home should become an important 
part of your financial net worth — that is, 
the difference between your assets (financial 
things of value that you own, such as bank 
accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, 
mutual funds, and so on) and your liabilities 
(debts). Why? Because homes generally 
increase in value over the decades while you’re 
paying down the loan used to buy the home. 
Remember, we’re talking about the long term 
here — decades, not just a few years. The 
housing market goes through downturns — 
the late 2000s being the most recent down 
period — but the long-term trend has always 
been higher.
Even if you’re one of those rare people who 
owns a home but doesn’t see much apprecia-
tion (increase in the home’s value) over 
the decades of your adult ownership, you still 
benefit from the monthly forced savings that 
result from paying down the remaining balance 
due on your mortgage. Older folks can tell 
you that owning a home free and clear of a 
mortgage is a joy.
All that home equity (the difference between 
the market value of a home and the outstanding 
loan on the home) can help your personal and 
financial situation in a number of ways. If, like 
most people, you hope to someday retire but 
(also like most people) saving doesn’t come 
easily, your home’s equity can help supplement 
your other sources of retirement income.
How can you tap into your home’s equity? Here 
are three main ways:
 ✓ Some people choose to trade down — 
that is, to move to a less costly home in 
retirement. Sell your home for $500,000, 
replace it with one that costs $300,000, and 
you’ve freed up $200,000. Subject to certain 
requirements, you can sell your home and 
realize up to $250,000 in tax-free profits 
if you’re single, or $500,000 if married. 
(See Chapter 17 to find out more about this 
home-ownership tax break.)
 ✓ Another way to tap your home’s equity is 
through borrowing. Your home’s equity may 
be an easily tapped and low-cost source of 
cash (the interest you pay is generally tax-
deductible — see Chapter 3).
 ✓ Some retirees also consider what’s called a 
reverse mortgage. Under this arrangement, 
the lender sends you a monthly check that 
you can spend however you want. 
Meanwhile, a debt balance (that will be 
paid off when the property is finally sold) is 
built up against the property.
What can you do with all this home equity? Help 
pay for your children’s college education, start 
your own business, remodel your home, or 
whatever!

15
 Chapter 1: Deciding Whether to Buy
 
✓ Don’t make the place too weird. You probably want or need to sell your 
home someday, and the more outrageous you make it, the fewer buyers 
it will appeal to — and the lower the price it will likely fetch. If you don’t 
mind throwing money away or are convinced that you can find a buyer 
with similarly (ahem) sophisticated tastes, be as weird as you want. If 
you do make improvements, focus on those that add value: skylights, a 
deck addition for an outdoor living area, updated kitchens and bath-
rooms, and so on.
 
✓ Beware of running yourself into financial ruin. Changing, improving, 
remodeling, or whatever you want to call it costs money. We know many 
home buyers who neglect other important financial goals (such as 
saving for retirement and their kids’ college costs) in order to endlessly 
renovate their homes. Others rack up significant debts that hang like 
financial weights over their heads. In the worst cases, homes become 
money pits that cause owners to build up high-interest consumer debt 
as a prelude to bankruptcy or foreclosure.
You avoid unpleasant landlords
A final (and not inconsequential) benefit of owning your own home is that 
you don’t have to subject yourself to the whims of an evil landlord. Much is 
made among real estate investors of the challenges of finding good tenants. 
As a tenant, perhaps you’ve already discovered that finding a good landlord 
isn’t easy, either.
 
The fundamental problem with some landlords is that they’re slow to fix 
problems and make improvements. The best (and smartest) landlords realize 
that keeping the building shipshape helps attract and keep good tenants 
and maximizes rents and profits. But to some landlords, like Leona Helmsley, 
maximizing profits means being stingy with repairs and improvements 
(although some of Leona’s tenants took her to court for her “excessive 
thriftiness”).
When you own your home, the good news is that you’re generally in 
control — you can get your stopped-up toilet fixed or your ugly walls painted 
whenever and however you like. No more hassling with unresponsive, 
obnoxious landlords. The bad news is that you’re responsible for paying for 
and ensuring completion of the work. Even if you hire someone else to do it, 
you still must find competent contractors and oversee their work, neither of 
which is an easy responsibility.
Another risk of renting is that landlords may decide to sell the building 
and put you out on the street. You should ask your prospective landlords 
whether they have plans to sell. Some landlords won’t give you a truthful 
answer, but the question is worth asking if this issue is a concern to you.

16
Part I: Home Economics 
 
One way to avoid being jilted by a wayward landlord is to request that the 
lease contract guarantee you the right to renew your annual lease for a certain 
number of years, even with a change in building ownership. Unless landlords 
are planning on selling, and perhaps want to be able to boot you out, they 
should be delighted with a request that shows you’re interested in staying a 
while. Also, by knowing if and when a landlord desires to sell, you may be able 
to be the buyer!
Renting advantages
Buying and owning a home throughout most of your adult life makes good 
financial and personal sense for most people — but not all people and not 
at all times. Renting works better for some people. The benefits of renting 
are many:
 
✓ Simplicity: Yes, searching for a rental unit that meets your needs can 
take more than a few days (especially if you’re in a tight rental market), 
but it should be a heck of a lot easier than finding a place to buy. When 
you buy, you must line up financing, conduct inspections, and deal with 
myriad other issues that renters never have to face. When you do it 
right, finding and buying a good home can be a time-consuming pain in 
the posterior.
 
✓ Convenience: After you find and move into your rental, your landlord is 
responsible for the never-ending task of property maintenance and 
upkeep. Buildings and appliances age, and bad stuff happens: Fuses 
blow, plumbing backs up, heaters break in the middle of winter, roofs 
spring leaks during record-breaking rainfalls, trees come crashing down 
during windstorms. The list goes on and on and on. As a renter, you can 
kick back in the old recliner with your feet up, a glass of wine in one 
hand and the remote control in the other, and say, “Ahhhhh, the joys of 
not being part of the landed gentry!”
 
✓ Flexibility: If you’re the footloose and fancy-free type, you dislike feeling 
tied down. With a rental, so long as your lease allows (and most leases 
don’t run longer than a year), you can move on. As a homeowner, if you 
want to move, you must deal with the significant chores of selling your 
home or finding a tenant to rent it.
 
✓ Increased liquidity: Unless you’re the beneficiary of a large inheritance 
or work at a high-paying job, you’ll probably be financially stretched 
when you buy your first home. Coming up with the down payment and 
closing costs usually cleans out most people’s financial reserves. In 
addition, when you buy a home, you must meet your monthly mortgage 
payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair 
expenses. As a renter, you can keep your extra cash to yourself, and 
budgeting is also easier without the upkeep-expense surprises that 
homeowners enjoy, such as the sudden urge to replace a leaking roof or 
old furnace.

17
 Chapter 1: Deciding Whether to Buy
 
 You don’t need to buy a home to cut your taxes. Should you have access 
to a retirement account such as a 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRA, or Keogh 
plan (see Chapter 2), you can slash your taxes while you save and invest 
your extra cash as a renter. So saving on taxes shouldn’t be the sole 
motivation for you to buy a home.
 
✓ Better diversification: Many homeowners who are financially stretched 
have the bulk of their wealth tied up in their homes. As a renter, you 
can invest your money in a variety of sound investments, such as 
stocks, bonds, and perhaps your own small business. You can even 
invest a small amount of money in real estate through stocks or mutual 
funds if you want (see Chapter 16). Over the long term, the stock 
market has produced comparable rates of return to investing in the 
real estate market.
 
✓ Maybe lower cost: If you live in an area where home prices have 
rocketed ahead much faster than rental rates, real estate may be over-
priced and not a good buy. This happened in some areas (portions of 
California, Florida, and Nevada, for example) in the U.S. in the mid-2000s. 
In Chapter 4, we explain how to compare the cost of owning to the cost 
of renting in your area and how to spot a potentially overpriced real 
estate market.
 
 Renting should also be cheaper than buying if you expect to move soon. 
Buying and selling property costs big bucks. With real estate agent com-
missions, loan fees, title insurance, inspections, and all sorts of other 
costs, your property must appreciate approximately 15 percent just for 
you to break even and recoup these costs. Therefore, buying property 
that you don’t expect to hold onto for at least three (and preferably five 
or more) years doesn’t make much economic sense. Although you may 
sometimes experience appreciation in excess of 15 percent over a year 
or two, most of the time, you won’t. If you’re counting on such high 
appreciation, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment.
The Pitfalls of the Rent-versus-Buy 
Decision
When you’re considering purchasing a home, you can do lots of reflecting, 
crunch plenty of numbers, and conduct copious research to help you with 
your decision. We encourage these activities and show you how to do them 
in later chapters.
In reality, we know that many people are tempted to jump into making a 
decision about buying or continuing to rent without setting all their ducks 
in a row. At a minimum, we want to keep you from making common costly 
mistakes, so in the following sections, we go over the biggies to avoid.

18
Part I: Home Economics 
Renting because it seems cheaper
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, in the long run, owning should save 
you money compared with renting a comparable abode. But come on, we’re 
Americans, after all, and we live on — nay, thrive on — instant gratification. 
We’re not generally long-term thinkers — we too often live for today. Well, 
when you go out to look at homes on the market today, the sticker prices are 
typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Your monthly rent seems 
dirt-cheap by comparison.
 
You must compare the monthly cost of homeownership with the monthly cost 
of renting. And you must factor in the tax savings you’ll realize from home-
ownership tax deductions. (We show you how to make these calculations in 
Chapter 3.) But you must also think about the future. Just as your educational 
training affects your career prospects and income-earning ability for years to 
come, your rent-versus-buy decision affects your housing costs — not just this 
year, but also for years and decades to come.
Fretting too much over job security
Being insecure about your job is natural. Most people are — even corporate 
chief executives, superstar athletes, and movie stars. And buying a home 
seems like such a permanent thing to do. Job-loss fears can easily make you 
feel a financial noose tightening around your neck when you sit down to sign 
a contract to purchase a home.
Although a few people have real reasons to worry about losing their jobs, the 
reality is that the vast majority of people shouldn’t worry about job loss. 
We don’t mean to say that you can’t lose your job — almost anyone can, in 
reality. Just remember that within a reasonable time, your skills and abilities 
will allow you to land back on your feet in a new, comparable position. We’re 
not career experts, but we’ve witnessed thousands of people bounce back in 
just this way.
 
When losing your job is a high likelihood, and especially if you’d have to 
relocate for a new job, consider postponing the purchase of a home until your 
employment situation stabilizes. (If you haven’t demonstrated a recent history 
of stable employment, most mortgage lenders won’t want to lend you money 
anyway — see Chapters 6 and 7.) When you must move to find an acceptable 
or desirable job, selling your home and then buying another one can cost you 
thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars in transaction fees.

19
 Chapter 1: Deciding Whether to Buy
Buying when you expect to move soon
People move for many reasons other than job loss. You may want to move 
soon to advance your career, to be nearer to (or farther from!) family, to try 
living somewhere new, or just to get away from someplace old. Unless you’re 
planning to hold onto your home and convert it to a rental when you move, 
buying a home rarely makes sound financial sense when you expect to move 
within three years. (Ideally, stay put for at least five years.)
Succumbing to pushy salespeople
When you buy a house, you’re the one who’ll be coming home to it day after 
day — and you’re the one on the hook for all the expenses. Don’t ever forget 
these facts when you plunge into the thick of purchasing a home. If you have 
lingering doubts about buying a home, apply the brakes.
 
Many people involved in home-buying transactions have a vested interest in 
getting you to buy. They may push you to buy sooner (and buy more) than 
you intend to or can afford, given your other financial goals and obligations. 
The reasons: Many people who make their living in the real estate trade get 
paid only if and when you buy, and the size of their earnings depends upon 
how much you spend. In Chapter 9, we show you how to put together the 
best team to assist you in making a decision rather than push you into making 
a deal.
Ignoring logistics
Sometimes, when looking at homes, you can lose your perspective on big-
picture issues. After months of searching, Frederick finally found a home 
that met his needs for both space and cost. He bought the home and moved 
in on a Saturday. Come Monday morning, Frederick hopped in his car and 
spent the next hour commuting. At the end of his workday, it was the same 
thing coming home. He was tired and grumpy when he arrived home Monday 
evening, and after making dinner for himself, he soon had to hit the hay to 
rise early enough to do it all over again on Tuesday.
Initially, Frederick hoped that the trying traffic was an aberration that would 
go away — but no such luck. In fact, on many days, his commute was worse 
than an hour each way. Frederick grew to hate his commute, his job, and his 
new home.

20
Part I: Home Economics 
 
When you buy a home, you’re also buying the commute, the neighborhood, its 
amenities, and all the other stuff that comes along for the literal and figurative 
ride. Understand these issues before you buy. In the end, after 18 months of 
commuter purgatory, Frederick sold his home and went back to renting much 
closer to his job. Forgetting to consider what the commute from a home to his 
job would entail was an expensive lesson for Frederick. Don’t make the same 
mistake Frederick made; take your time, and consider all the important factors 
about the home you’re thinking about purchasing.
Overbuying
Many first-time home buyers discover that their desires outstrip their bud-
gets. Nelson and his wife, Laura, had good jobs in the computer industry 
and together made in excess of $100,000 per year. They got used to buying 
what they desired — they ate at fancy restaurants, took luxury vacations, and 
otherwise indulged themselves.
When it came time to purchase a home, they spent the maximum amount and 
borrowed the maximum amount that the mortgage person told them they 
could. After the home purchase, Laura got pregnant and eventually left her 
job to spend more time at home. With the high home-ownership expenses, 
kid costs, and reduced household income, Nelson and Laura soon found 
themselves struggling to pay their monthly bills and started accumulating 
significant credit card debts. Ultimately, they ended up filing bankruptcy.
 
Either you own the home, or it owns you. Get your finances in order, and 
understand how much you can truly afford to spend on a home before you 
buy (see Chapters 2 and 3).
Underbuying
Remember in the story “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” how Goldilocks had 
difficulty finding porridge to her liking? In one case, it was too cold, and in 
another, too hot. Well, just as you can overbuy when selecting a home, you 
can underbuy. That’s what Nathan and Rebecca did when they bought their 
first home. They believed in living within their means — a good thing — but 
they took it to an extreme.
Nathan and Rebecca bought a home whose cost was far below the maximum 
amount they could have afforded. They borrowed $70,000 when they could 
have afforded to borrow three times that amount. They knew when they 
bought the home that they’d want to move to a bigger house within just a few 

21
 Chapter 1: Deciding Whether to Buy
years. Although this made the real estate agents and lenders happy, all the 
costs of buying and then selling soon after gobbled a huge chunk of Nathan 
and Rebecca’s original down payment.
Buying because it’s a 
grown-up thing to do
Peer pressure can be subtle or explicit. Some people even impose pressure 
on themselves. Buying a home is a major milestone and a tangible display of 
financial maturity and success. If your friends, siblings, and coworkers all 
seem to be homeowners, you may sometimes feel as though you’re being a 
tad juvenile by not jumping on the same train.
Everyone has different needs, but not everyone should own a home, and 
certainly not at every point in their adult lives. Besides, although they may 
never admit it, some homeowning friends and colleagues are jealous of you 
and other financially footloose and fancy-free renters.
A study even supports the notion that the life of a typical renter is, in some 
respects, better than that of the average homeowner. Peter Rossi and Eleanor 
Weber of the University of Massachusetts Social and Demographic Research 
Institute conducted a survey of thousands of people. Here are some of their 
findings:
 
✓ Homeowners are less social, on average, than renters — spending less 
time with friends, neighbors, and coworkers.
 
✓ Homeowners spend more time on household chores.
 
✓ Perhaps for the preceding reasons, renters have more sex and less 
marital discord and cope better with parenting than homeowners do!
Buying because you’re afraid that 
escalating prices will lock you out
From time to time, particular local real estate markets experience rapidly 
escalating prices. During such times, some prospective buyers panic, 
often with encouragement from those with a vested interest in converting 
prospective renters to buyers. Escalating housing prices make some renters 
feel left out of the party. Booming housing prices make the front page of 
the newspaper and the local TV news. And gloating homeowners cluck over 
their equity.

22
Part I: Home Economics 
 
Never in the history of the real estate business have prices risen so high as to 
price vast numbers of people out of the market. In fact, patient buyers who 
can wait out a market that has increased sharply in value are often rewarded 
with steadying and, in some cases, declining prices (witness what happened in 
the late 2000s). Although you won’t be locked out of the market forever, you 
should keep in mind that if you postpone buying for many years, you’ll likely 
be able to buy less home for your money thanks to home prices increasing 
faster than the rate of inflation.
Misunderstanding what you can afford
When you make a major decision, be it personal or financial, it’s perfectly 
natural and human to feel uncomfortable if you’re flying by the seat of your 
pants and don’t have enough background. With a home purchase, if you 
haven’t examined your overall financial situation and goals, you’re just 
guessing how much you should be spending on a home.
Again, the vested-interest folks won’t generally bring this issue to your 
attention — partly because of their agendas and motivations, but also 
because it’s not what they’re trained and expert at doing. Look in the mirror 
to see the person who can help you with these important issues. (Chapter 2 
walks you through all the important personal financial considerations you 
should explore before you set out on your buying expedition.)

Chapter 2
Getting Your Financial 
House in Order
In This Chapter

▶ Determining your savings requirements to achieve your goals
▶ Protecting yourself and your assets with insurance
▶ Remembering what’s most important in life
W
hen you’re shopping for a home, you’re the person best suited to 
look out for your overall interests. The people involved in typical 
real estate deals (such as real estate agents, bankers, loan brokers, and 
the like) are there to get their jobs done. It’s not within their realm of respon-
sibility to worry about how the real estate purchase fits with the rest of 
your personal finances and how best to arrange your finances before and 
after purchasing a home. This chapter explains how you can address these 
important issues.
 
Now, time for a parental warning: Skip this chapter at your own peril. In the 
great history of home buying, many people have bought real estate without 
first getting their finances in order, setting some goals, and dealing with 
problems — and they’ve often paid dearly for this oversight. What are the 
consequences of plunging headlong into a home purchase before you’re 
financially ready? For starters, you could end up paying tens of thousands of 
dollars more in taxes and interest over the years ahead. In the worst cases, 
we’ve witnessed the financial ruin of intelligent, hardworking people who end 
up over their heads in debt (and in some situations, even in foreclosure and 
bankruptcy). We want you to be happy and financially successful in your 
home — so please read this chapter!

24
Part I: Home Economics 
Surveying Your Spending
Even if your income and spending fluctuate, you may have unknowingly 
developed a basic spending routine. Every month, you earn a particular 
income and then spend most of, all of, or perhaps even more than what you 
earn on the necessities (and the not-so-necessary things) of life.
 
When you want to buy a home, saving is one area where it pays to be above 
average. Consistently saving more than 5 percent of your income can help 
turn you from a renter into a financially able and successful homeowner. Why? 
For two important reasons:
 
✓ First, in order to purchase a home, you need to accumulate a decent 
chunk of money for the down payment and closing costs. True, wealthy 
relatives may help you out, but counting on their generosity is fool-
hardy. The attached strings may make such a gift or loan undesirable. If 
you’re like most people, you probably don’t have any wealthy relatives 
anyhow.
 
✓ Second, after you buy a home, your total monthly expenses will proba-
bly increase. So if you had trouble saving before the purchase, your 
finances are really going to be squeezed postpurchase. This will further 
handicap your ability to accomplish other important financial goals, 
such as accumulating money for retirement. If you don’t take advantage 
of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, you’ll miss out on thousands 
(if not tens of thousands) of dollars in valuable tax benefits. We discuss 
the importance and value of funding retirement accounts later in 
this chapter.
Gathering the data
One of the single most important things that you can and should do before 
you head out to purchase a home is to examine where (and on what) you’re 
currently spending your money. Completing these financial calisthenics 
enables you to see what portion of your current income you’re saving. Having 
a handle on your current budget also enables you to see how a given home 
purchase will fit within the budget or destroy it!
 
Review your spending data from at least a three-month span to determine how 
much you spend in a typical month on various things — such as rent, clothing, 
income taxes, haircuts, and everything else (see Table 2-1). If your spending 
fluctuates greatly throughout the year, you may need to analyze and average 
for 6 (or even 12) months to get an accurate sense of your spending behavior 
and shenanigans.

Financial software packages, such as Quicken and Microsoft Money, can help 
with the task of tracking and analyzing your spending, but old-fashioned 
paper and pencil work fine, too. What you need to do is assemble information 
that shows what you typically spend your money on. Get out your checkbook 
register, credit- and charge-card bills, online bill payment and banking sum-
mary, job pay stub, and your most recent tax return.
Whether you use our handy-dandy table or your own software isn’t impor-
tant. What does matter is that you capture the bulk of your spending. But 
you don’t need to account for 100 percent of your spending and track every 
last penny (or even every last dollar). You’re not designing an airplane or 
performing a financial audit for a major accounting firm here!
 
As you collect your spending data and consider your home purchase, think 
about how that purchase will affect and change your spending and ability to 
save. For example, as a homeowner, if you live farther away from your job 
than you did when you rented, how much will your transportation expenses 
increase? Also note that in Chapter 3, we walk you through estimating 
home-ownership expenses, such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, 
and the like.
Analyzing your spending numbers
Tabulating your spending is only half the battle on the path to fiscal fitness 
and a financially successful home purchase. You must do something with and 
about the personal spending information that you collect.

28
Part I: Home Economics 
Here, in order of likelihood, are the possible outcomes of your spending 
analysis:
Trimming the fat from your budget
Most people planning to buy a home need to 
reduce their spending in order to accumulate 
enough money for the down payment and clos-
ing costs and to create enough slack in their 
budget to afford the extra costs of homeowner-
ship. (Increasing your income is another strat-
egy, but that’s usually more difficult to do.) 
Where you decide to make cuts in your budget 
is a matter of personal preference — but unless 
you’re independently wealthy or a spendthrift, 
cut you must.
First, get rid of any and all consumer debt — 
such as that on credit cards and auto loans. 
Ridding yourself of such debt as soon as pos-
sible is vital to your long-term financial health. 
Consumer debt is as harmful to your financial 
health as smoking is to your personal health. 
Borrowing through consumer loans encour-
ages you to live beyond your means and do the 
opposite of saving — call it “dis-saving” (or 
deficit financing, as those in Washington, D.C., 
say). The interest rates on consumer debt are 
high, and unlike the interest on a mortgage, the 
interest on consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible, 
so you bear the full brunt of its cost.
Should you have accessible savings to pay 
down your consumer debts, by all means use 
those savings. You’re surely paying a higher 
interest rate on such debt than you’re earning 
from interest on your savings. Plus, interest on 
your savings is taxable. Just be sure that you 
have access to sufficient emergency money 
through family or other means.
If you lack the savings to make your high-cost 
debts disappear, start by refinancing your high-
cost credit card debt onto cards with lower-
interest rates. Then work at reducing your 
spending to free up cash to pay down these 
debts as quickly as possible. And if you have a 
tendency to run up credit card balances, con-
sider getting rid of your credit cards and obtain-
ing a Visa or MasterCard debit card. These 
debit cards look like credit cards and are 
accepted the same as credit cards by mer-
chants, but they function like checks. When you 
make a purchase with a debit card, the money 
is deducted from your checking account within 
a day or two.
Trim unnecessary items from your budget. Even 
if you’re not a high-income earner, some of the 
things you spend your money on are unneces-
sary. Although everyone needs food, shelter, 
clothing, and healthcare, people spend a great 
deal of additional money on luxuries and nones-
sentials. Even some of what we spend on the 
“necessity” categories is partly for luxury.
Purchase products and services that offer 
value. High quality doesn’t have to cost more. In 
fact, higher-priced products and services are 
sometimes inferior to lower-cost alternatives.
Finally, buy in bulk. Most items are cheaper per 
unit when you buy them in larger sizes or vol-
umes. Wholesale superstores such as Costco 
and Sam’s Club offer family sizes and competi-
tive pricing.

29
 Chapter 2: Getting Your Financial House in Order
 
✓ You spend too much. When most people examine their spending for the 
first time, they’re somewhat horrified at how much they spend overall 
and for what specific things. Perhaps you had no idea that your café latte 
addiction is setting you back $100 per month or that you spend $400 per 
month on eating out.
 
 Your challenge is to decide where to make reductions or cutbacks. 
(Check out the nearby sidebar, “Trimming the fat from your budget.”) 
Everybody who has enough discretionary income to buy this book has 
fat in her budget (some have much more than others). For most people 
to reach their financial goals, they must save at least 10 percent of their 
pretax income. But how much you should be saving depends upon what 
your goals are and how aggressive and successful an investor you are. If, 
for example, you want to retire early and don’t have much put away yet, 
you may need to save much more than 10 percent per year to reach 
your goal.
 
✓ You save just right. You may be one of those people who has mapped 
out a financial path and is right on track. Great! However, just as a cue 
ball sends a neatly racked set of billiard balls into disarray, buying a 
home can disrupt even the most organized and on-track budgets.
 
 Reviewing what your budget may look like with a home in the picture 
is important. So if you haven’t already done so, complete Table 2-1 to 
analyze your current spending and project how it may look after a home 
purchase.
 
✓ You save a lot. Perhaps you’re one of those rare sorts who save more 
than necessary. If so, you not only may be able to skip doing a budget 
but also may be able to stretch the amount you spend and borrow when 
buying a home. But even if you’ve made your financial plans and are 
saving more than enough, you still may want to complete Table 2-1 to 
ensure that your financial train doesn’t get derailed.
Reckoning Your Savings Requirements
Not only do most people not know how much they’re currently saving; even 
more people don’t know how much they should be saving. You should know 
these amounts before you buy a home.
How much you should be saving likely differs from how much your neighbors 
and coworkers should be saving because each person has a different situa-
tion, different resources, and different goals. Focus on your own situation.

Part I: Home Economics 
Setting some goals
Most people find it enlightening to see how much they need to save to 
accomplish particular goals. Wanting to retire someday is a common goal. 
The challenge is that in your 20s and 30s, it’s difficult to have more clearly 
defined goals — such as knowing that you want to retire at age 58 and move 
to New Mexico, where you’ll join a shared-housing community and buy a 
home that currently costs $200,000. Not to worry — you don’t need to know 
exactly when, where, and how you want to retire.
But you do want to avoid nasty surprises. When Peter and Nancy hit their 
40s, they came to the painful realization that retirement was a long way off 
because they were still working off consumer debts and trying to initiate a 
regular savings program. Now they’re confronted with a choice: having to 
work into their 70s to achieve their retirement goals or settling for a much 
less comfortable lifestyle in retirement.
If retirement isn’t one of your goals, terrific! Should you want (and be able) 
to continue working throughout your 60s, 70s, and 80s, you don’t need to 
accumulate the vast savings that others must in order to be loafing during 
The wise use of credit
Just because borrowing on credit cards bears 
a high cost doesn’t mean that all credit is bad 
for you. Borrowing money for long-term 
purposes can make sense if you borrow for 
sound, wealth-building investments. Borrowing 
money for a real estate purchase, for a small 
business, or for education can pay dividends 
down the road.
When you borrow for investment purposes, you 
may earn tax benefits as well. With a home pur-
chase, for example, home mortgage interest 
and property taxes are generally tax-deductible 
(as we discuss in Chapter 3). When fixed-rate 
mortgages go for around 7 percent, for instance, 
the effective after-tax cost of borrowing money 
is just 4.6 percent for a moderate income 
earner who’s paying approximately 35 percent 
in federal and state income taxes.
If you own a business, you may deduct the 
interest expenses on loans that you take out for 
business purposes. Interest incurred through 
borrowing against your securities (stock and 
bond) investments (through so-called margin 
loans) is deductible against your investment 
income for the year.
In fact, you can even make wise use of short-
term credit on your credit cards to make your 
money work harder for you. For example, you 
can use your credit cards for the convenience 
that they offer, not for their credit feature. When 
you pay your bill in full and on time during each 
monthly billing cycle, you’ve had free use of the 
money that you owed from the credit card 
charges that you made during the previous 
month. (See Chapter 5 for details on how to use 
your positive credit experiences to obtain the 
best possible mortgage.)

those golden years. But counting on being able to keep working throughout 
your lifetime is risky — you don’t know what the job market or your personal 
health may be like later in life.
Retirement savings accounts 
and a dilemma
Prior years’ tax reforms have taken away many of the previously available 
tax write-offs, except for one of the best and most accessible write-offs: 
funding a retirement-savings plan. Money that you contribute to an employer-
based retirement plan — such as a 401(k) or a 403(b) — or to a self-employed 
plan — such as an SEP-IRA or a Keogh — is generally tax-deductible. This 
saves you both federal and state income taxes in the year for which the 
contribution is made. Additionally, all your money in these accounts com-
pounds over time without taxation. (Note: The newer Roth IRA retirement 
accounts are unique in offering no up-front tax break but allowing the tax-free 
withdrawal of investment earnings subject to eligibility requirements.) These 
tax-reduction accounts are one of the best ways to save your money and 
make it grow.
The challenge for most people is keeping their spending down to a level that 
allows them to save enough to contribute to these terrific tax-reduction 
accounts. Suppose that you’re currently spending all your income (a very 
American thing to do) and that you want to be able to save 10 percent of your 
income. Thanks to the tax savings that you’ll net from funding your retire-
ment account, if you’re able to cut your spending by just 7.5 percent and put 
those savings into a tax-deductible retirement account, you’ll actually be able 
to reach your 10 percent target.
 
Generally speaking, when you contribute money to a retirement account, the 
money isn’t accessible to you unless you pay a penalty. So if you’re accumulat-
ing down-payment money for the purchase of a home, putting that money 
into a retirement account is generally a bad idea. Why? Because when you 
withdraw money from a retirement account, you not only owe current income 
taxes but also hefty penalties (10 percent of the amount withdrawn must go to 
the IRS, plus you must pay whatever penalty your state assesses).
So the dilemma is that you can save outside of retirement accounts and have 
access to your down-payment money but pay much more in taxes, or you 
can fund your retirement accounts and gain tax benefits but lack access to 
the money for your home purchase.
 
You can skirt this dilemma in two ways. See whether your employer allows 
borrowing against retirement-savings-plan balances. And if you have an 
Individual Retirement Account (either a standard IRA or a Roth IRA), you’re 
allowed to withdraw up to $10,000 (lifetime maximum) toward a home 

32
Part I: Home Economics 
purchase so long as you haven’t owned a home for the past two years. 
Tapping into a Roth IRA is a better deal because the withdrawal is free from 
income tax as long as the Roth account is at least five years old. Although a 
standard IRA has no such time restriction, withdrawals are taxed as income, 
so you’ll net only the after-tax amount of the withdrawal toward your down 
payment.
Because most of us have limited discretionary dollars, we must decide what 
our priorities are. Saving for retirement and reducing your taxes are impor-
tant, but when you’re trying to save to purchase a home, some or most of 
your savings need to be outside a tax-sheltered retirement account. Putting 
your retirement savings on the back burner for a short time to build up your 
down-payment cushion is okay. Be careful, though, to purchase a home that 
offers enough slack in your budget to fund your retirement accounts after the 
purchase. Do the budget exercise in Table 2-1, earlier in this chapter!
Other reasons to save
Wanting to have the financial resources to retire someday is hardly the only 
reason to save. Most people have several competing reasons to squirrel 
away money. Here are some other typical financial objectives or goals that 
motivate people (or should be motivating them) to save money. We tell you 
how to fit each goal into your home-purchasing desires and your overall 
personal financial situation:
 
✓ Emergency reserve: Whether random bad things happen isn’t so much 
the issue as when they happen. You simply can’t predict what impact a 
job loss, death in the family, accident, or unexpectedly large expense 
may have on you and your family. That’s why it’s a good idea to have an 
easily accessible and safe reservoir of money that you can tap should 
the need arise.
 
 Make sure that you have access to at least three months’ worth of 
expenses (if you have a highly unstable job and volatile income, perhaps 
even six months’ worth). Ideally, you should keep this money in a money 
market fund because such funds offer you both high yields and liquidity. 
The major mutual fund companies (such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. 
Rowe Price) offer money funds with competitive yields, check-writing 
privileges, and access to other good investments. (See Chapter 3 to find 
out more about these funds and how you can use them for investing 
your down-payment money.) Alternatively, a bank savings account can 
work, but it will likely offer a lower yield. Should you have benevolent 
relatives who are willing to fork over some dough in a flash, they may 
serve as your emergency reserve as well.

33
 Chapter 2: Getting Your Financial House in Order
 
✓ Educational expenses: If you have little cherubs at home, you want the 
best for them, and that typically includes a good college education. So 
when the first cash gifts start rolling in from Grandma and Grandpa, 
many a new parent establishes an investment account in the child’s 
name.
 
 Your best intentions could come back to haunt you, however, when 
Junior applies to enter college. All things being equal, the more you 
have available in your non-retirement accounts and in your child’s 
name, the less financial aid your child will qualify for. (By financial aid, 
we mean all types of assistance, including grants and loans that aren’t 
based on need.) Unless you’re wealthy or are sure that you can afford 
to pay for the full cost of a college education for your kids, think long 
and hard before putting money in your child’s name. Although it may 
sound selfish, you actually do yourself and your child a financial favor 
by taking full advantage of opportunities to fund your retirement 
accounts. Remember, too, that one of the advantages of being a home-
owner is that you can borrow against your home’s equity to help pay 
for your child’s college expenses.
 
✓ Startup business expenses: Another reason to save money is if you hope 
to start or purchase a business someday. When you have sufficient 
equity in your home, you can borrow against that equity to fund the 
business. But you may desire to accumulate a separate investment pool 
to fund your business.
 
No matter what your personal and financial goals are, you’re likely going to 
need to save a decent amount of money to achieve them. Consider what 
your goals are and how much you need to save to accomplish those goals, 
especially for retirement. Get your finances in order before you decide how 
much you can really afford to spend on a home. Otherwise, you may end up 
being a financial prisoner to your home.
Protecting Yourself, Your Dependents, 
and Your Assets
Not carrying proper insurance is potentially disastrous — both to yourself 
and your dependents. We’re not talking about homeowners insurance here. 
(Heck, we haven’t even explained how to find a home or get a loan yet! We 
get to homeowners insurance in Chapter 13.)
You need proper insurance protection for yourself personally, as well as 
for your assets. Sure, you can take your chances and hope that you never 
contract a dreaded disease, get into a horrible auto accident, or suffer some 
other misfortune or bad luck. But misfortune and bad luck usually come 
knocking without a warning.

34
Part I: Home Economics 
Trust us when we say that we’re optimistic, positive thinkers. However — 
and this is a big however — we know more than a few folks who got them-
selves (or their families or both) into major financial trouble after purchasing 
a home because they neglected to obtain proper insurance.
 
Here are a few cautionary tales:
 
✓ Steve bought a home and then learned from his doctor that he had 
multiple sclerosis. Steve had to cut back dramatically on work, and 
because he lacked proper long-term-disability insurance and now 
earned much lower work income, he was forced to sell his home at a 
large loss due to a soft real estate market in his area.
 
✓ Mary owned a home in California and, despite the known risk of earth-
quakes, didn’t purchase earthquake coverage. “It’s so expensive, and 
besides, the insurance companies won’t be able to meet the claims in a 
major quake. Government assistance will help,” she said. Mary’s home 
was a total loss in an earthquake, and although the government made a 
loan, it didn’t pay for the loss — ultimately, the money came out of 
Mary’s pocket.
 
✓ Maggie and Donald were living a charmed life in the New England 
countryside with their two children, a white farmhouse, and a dog and 
a cat — until Maggie came down with cancer. She left her job, which 
placed some strain on the family finances. After much treatment, 
Maggie died. Donald and the kids were forced to move because Maggie 
lacked proper life insurance.
 
✓ Michelle had a walkway in disrepair. Unfortunately, one day an older 
man tripped and severely injured himself. To make a long story short, 
after lengthy legal proceedings, the settlement in favor of the man was 
significant enough to force Michelle to sell her home. A good chunk of 
the settlement money came out of Michelle’s pocket because she lacked 
sufficient liability insurance.
Now, we’re not about to try to tell you that insurance would have made 
these situations come out fine. Insurance generally can’t prevent most major 
medical problems, keep a person from dying, or stop someone from suing 
you. However, proper insurance can protect you and your family from the 
adverse and severe financial consequences of major problems. The right kind 
of insurance can make the difference between keeping versus losing your 
home, and it can help you and your family maintain your standard of living.
Wanting to skip insurance is tempting. After all, insurance costs you your 
hard-earned, after-tax dollars, and unlike a meal out, a vacation, or a new 
stereo, insurance has no up-front, tangible benefit.

35
 Chapter 2: Getting Your Financial House in Order
 
You hope that you won’t need to use insurance, but if you do need it, you’re 
glad it’s there to protect you and, in some cases, to protect your dependents. 
Buy too little insurance and it won’t protect you and yours against a real 
catastrophe. So you need the right amount of coverage that balances good 
protection against cost.
Insuring yourself
Before you buy a home, get your insurance protection (for yourself and for 
your valuable assets) in order. Not doing so is the financial equivalent of 
driving down the highway in an old subcompact car at 90 miles per hour 
without a seat belt. You should purchase sufficient protection to prevent a 
financial catastrophe.
Disability insurance
Your ability to produce income should be insured. During your working 
years, your future income-earning ability is likely your most valuable asset — 
far more valuable than a car or even your home.
Long-term-disability insurance replaces most of your lost income in the event 
that a disability prevents you from working. Major disabilities are usually the 
result of accidents or medical problems — occurrences that, of course, can’t 
be predicted. Even if you don’t have financial dependents, you probably 
need disability coverage. Unless you’re quite wealthy and no longer need 
to work for income, aren’t you financially dependent upon your paycheck? 
Although many larger companies offer long-term-disability insurance, many 
small-company employees and self-employed people have no coverage — 
a risky situation.
Life insurance
When you have dependents, you may also need life insurance protection. The 
question to ask yourself and your family is how they’d fare financially if you 
died and they no longer had your income. If your family is dependent upon 
your income and you want them to be able to maintain their current standard 
of living in your absence, you need life insurance.
Term life insurance, like most other forms of insurance, is pure insurance pro-
tection and is the best type of insurance for the vast majority of people. The 
amount of coverage you buy should be based upon how many years’ worth of 
your income you desire to provide your family in the event of your passing.

36
Part I: Home Economics 
 
Insurance brokers love to sell cash-value life insurance (also known as whole or 
universal life insurance) because of the hefty commissions that they can earn 
by selling this type of insurance. (These commissions, of course, come out of 
your pocket.) Some mortgage lenders lobby you to buy the mortgage life 
insurance that they sell. Skip both these options. Mortgage life insurance is 
simply overpriced term insurance, and cash-value life insurance generally 
combines overpriced life insurance with a relatively low-return investment 
account.
Wills, living trusts, and estate planning
Although some of us don’t like to admit it or 
even think about it, we’re all mortal. Because of 
the way our legal and tax systems work, it’s 
often beneficial to have legal documents in 
place specifying important details such as what 
should be done with your assets (including your 
home) when you die.
A will is the most basic of such documents, and 
for most people, particularly those who are 
younger or don’t have great assets, the only 
critical one. Through a will, you can direct to 
whom your assets will go upon your death, as 
well as who will serve as guardian for your 
minor children. In the absence of a will, state 
law dictates these important issues.
Along with your will, also consider signing a 
living will and a medical power of attorney. 
These documents help your doctor and family 
members make important decisions regarding 
your healthcare, should you be unable to make 
those decisions for yourself.
Even a will and supporting medical and legal 
documents may not be enough to get your 
assets to your desired heirs, as well as minimize 
taxes and legal fees. When you hold significant 
assets (such as a home and business) outside 
tax-sheltered retirement accounts, in most 
states, those assets must be probated — 
which is the court-administered process for 
implementing your will. Attorneys’ probate fees 
can run quite high — up to 5 percent of the 
value of the probated assets. Establishing and 
placing your home and other assets in a living 
trust can eliminate much of the hassle and cost 
of probate.
Finally, if your net worth (assets minus liabili-
ties) exceeds $3.5 million (for tax year 2009) 
upon your death, the federal (and perhaps your 
state’s) government will levy significant estate 
taxes. Estate planning can help minimize the 
portion of your estate subject to such taxation. 
One simple but powerful estate-planning strat-
egy is to give money to your desired heirs to 
reduce your taxable estate. (If your relatives are 
in the fortunate position of having great wealth, 
they may give, free of tax, up to $13,000 yearly to 
as many recipients as they want. If they give 
you $13,000, you can use this money toward 
your home’s down payment.)
Wills, living trusts, and estate planning are noth-
ing more than forms of insurance. Remember 
that it takes both time and money to generate 
these documents, and the benefits may be a 
long time off, so don’t get carried away with 
doing too many of these things before you’re 
older and have significant assets. Read the 
latest edition of Taxes For Dummies (Wiley), 
which Eric coauthored, to find out more about 
estate planning.

Health insurance
 
In addition to disability and life insurance, everyone should have a compre-
hensive health insurance policy. Even if you’re in good health, you never 
know when an accident or illness may happen. Medical bills can mushroom 
into tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in no time. Don’t be without 
comprehensive health insurance.
Insuring your assets
As your wealth builds over the years (ideally, at least in part, from the 
increasing value of the home that we help you buy), so does the risk of 
losing — or facing a lawsuit arising from — your valuable assets. For exam-
ple, you should have comprehensive insurance on your home and car(s). 
Should your home burn to the ground, a comprehensive homeowners 
insurance policy would pay for the cost of rebuilding the home. Likewise, 
if your car is totaled in an accident, auto insurance should pay to replace 
the car.
 
With all types of insurance that you purchase, take the highest deductible that 
you can comfortably afford. The deductible represents the amount of money 
that you must pay out of your own pocket when you have a loss for which you 
file a claim. High deductibles help keep the cost of your coverage low and also 
eliminate the hassle associated with filing small claims.
Along with buying insurance to cover the replacement costs for loss of or 
damage to your valuable assets, you can (and should) purchase adequate 
liability insurance for those assets. Both homeowners insurance and 
auto insurance come with liability protection. Make sure that you carry 
liability coverage for at least twice the value of your net worth (assets 
minus liabilities).
In addition to the liability protection that comes with auto and homeowners 
insurance, you may purchase a supplemental liability insurance policy 
known as an umbrella or excess liability policy. Purchased in increments of 
$1,000,000, this coverage can protect people with larger net worth. Note that 
this coverage doesn’t protect against lawsuits arising from your work.
Invest in Yourself
Last but not least, in your zest to build your financial empire and buy ever 
bigger and more expensive homes, don’t forget your best investment: you. 
Don’t run your life and body into the ground by working horrendous hours 
just to afford what you consider your dream home.

38

In addition to investing in your health, your family, and your friends, invest in 
educating yourself and taking charge of your finances. If you need more help 
with assessing your current financial health; reducing your spending, your 
taxes, and your debts; and mapping out an overall financial plan (including 
dealing with your investments and insurance), be smart and pick up a copy

Chapter 3
What Can You Afford to Buy?
In This Chapter
▶ Determining the costs and tax benefits of homeownership
▶ Getting a grip on closing costs
▶ Acquiring and investing the down payment
W
hen you walk into an auto showroom, one of the first questions the 
salespeople ask (after you pry them off you) is, “What is your budget?” 
or, “How much can you afford to spend on a car?” Of course, they hope that a 
large number rolls off your tongue. If you’re like many car buyers, you may be 
likely to say something along the lines of, “I’m not really sure.”
Many car buyers today finance the purchase — so they allow a banker or 
other lender to determine how much car they can afford. Such determina-
tions are based on a buyer’s income and other debt obligations.
But here’s where most people get confused. When a lender says that you 
qualify to borrow, say, $30,000 for a car purchase, this doesn’t mean that you 
can afford to spend that much on a car. What the lender is effectively saying 
to you is, “Based on what little I know about your situation and the fact that I 
can’t control your future behavior, this is the maximum amount that I think is 
a prudent risk for my organization to lend to you.”
The lending organization normally requires a certain down payment to pro-
tect itself against the possibility that you may default on the loan. Should you 
default on an auto loan, for example, the lender has to send the repo man out 
to take away and sell your car. This process takes time and money, and the 
lender will surely get less for the car than the amount that you paid for it.

40
Par t I: Home Economics 
Lenders Can’t Tell You 
What You Can Afford
 
Ultimately, a lender doesn’t care about you, your financial situation, or your 
other needs so long as it has protected its financial interests. This is true 
whether you’re borrowing to buy a car or a home. The lender doesn’t know or 
care whether, for example, you’re
 
✓ Falling behind in saving for retirement
 
✓ Wanting to save money for other important financial goals, such as 
starting or buying your own small business
 
✓ Parenting a small army of kids (or facing steep private-schooling costs)
 
✓ Lacking proper personal insurance protection
And therein lies the problem of making your decision about how much home 
(or car) you can afford to buy on the basis of how much money a lender is 
willing to lend you. That’s what Walter and Susan did. They set out to pur-
chase a home when Walter’s business was booming. They were making in 
excess of $200,000 per year.
Walter and Susan really wanted to buy the biggest and best house that they 
could afford. When they met with their friendly neighborhood banker, he 
was more than willing to show them how they could borrow $900,000 by get-
ting an adjustable-rate mortgage. (You can read all about these mortgages in 
Chapter 6. We’ll simply tell you here that because some adjustable mortgages 
start out at an artificially low “teaser” interest rate, they enable you to qualify 
to borrow a good deal more than would be the case with a traditional, fixed-
rate mortgage.)
Walter and Susan bought their dream home with an adjustable-rate $900,000 
mortgage. Within a few years, Walter and Susan’s dream home turned into 
the Nightmare on Oak Street. Their mortgage became a financial noose 
around their necks.
When blessed with young children, Walter and Susan didn’t want to work 
crazy hours anymore; yet they were forced to do so to meet their gargantuan 
mortgage payments. The initial payments on their adjustable-rate mort-
gage were high, but they ballooned gigantically as the loan’s interest rate 
increased.
The financial strain led to personal strain as Walter and Susan had frequent 
arguments about money and childcare. We know of others who stretched 
themselves the same way that Walter and Susan did. Many of them continue 
slaving away long hours in jobs they don’t like and making other unnecessary 
sacrifices, such as limiting the time they spend with family, in order to make 

41
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
their housing payments. Some end up divorcing, due in part to the financial 
strains. Others default on their loans and lose their homes and their good credit.
 
People at all income levels, even the affluent, can get into trouble and overex-
tend themselves by purchasing more house than they can afford and by taking 
on more debt than they can comfortably handle. Just because a lender or real 
estate agent says that you’re eligible for, or can qualify for, a certain size loan 
doesn’t mean that’s what you can afford given your personal financial situa-
tion. Lenders can’t tell you what you can afford — they can tell you only the 
maximum that they’ll allow you to borrow.
The Cost of Buying and Owning a Home
Before you set out in search of your dream home, one of the single most 
important questions you should answer is, “What can I afford to spend on a 
home?” To answer that question intelligently, you first need to understand 
what your financial goals are, what it will take to achieve them, and where 
you are today. If you haven’t yet read Chapter 2, now’s the time (unless 
you’re 100 percent sure that your personal finances are in tiptop shape). In 
the following sections, we dig into the costs of buying and owning a home.
Mortgage payments
In Chapter 6, we discuss selecting the best type of mortgage that fits your 
particular circumstances. In the meantime, you must still confront mortgages 
(with our assistance) because mortgages undoubtedly constitute the biggest 
component of the total cost of owning a home.
Start with the basics: A mortgage is a loan you take out to buy a home. A 
mortgage allows you to purchase a $150,000 home even though you yourself 
have far less money than that to put toward the purchase.
With few exceptions, mortgage loans in the U.S. are typically repaid over a 15- 
or 30-year time span. Almost all mortgages require monthly payments. Here’s 
how a mortgage works. Suppose that you’re purchasing a $150,000 home and 
that (following our sage advice, appearing later in this chapter) you have 
diligently saved a 20 percent ($30,000, in this example) down payment. Thus, 
you’re in the market for a $120,000 mortgage loan.
You sit down with a mortgage lender who asks you to complete a volume of 
paperwork (we navigate you through that morass in Chapter 7) that dwarfs 
the stack required for your annual income tax return. Just when you think the 
worst is over (after the paperwork blizzard subsides), the lender proceeds to 
give you an even bigger headache by talking about the literally hundreds of 
mortgage permutations and options.

42
Par t I: Home Economics 
Don’t worry — we can help you cut through the clutter! Imagine, for a moment, 
a simple world where the mortgage lender offers you only two mortgage options: 
a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (fixed-rate 
simply means that the interest rate on the loan stays fixed and level over the 
life of the loan). Here’s what your monthly payment would be under each 
mortgage option:
$120,000, 15-year mortgage @ 7.00 percent = $1,079 per month
$120,000, 30-year mortgage @ 7.25 percent = $819 per month
As we discuss in Chapter 6, the interest rate is typically a little bit lower on a 
15-year mortgage versus a 30-year mortgage because shorter-term loans are a 
little less risky for lenders. Note how much higher the monthly payment is on 
the 15-year mortgage than on the 30-year mortgage. Your payments must be 
higher for the 15-year mortgage because you’re paying off the same size loan 
15 years faster.
But don’t let the higher monthly payments on the 15-year loan cause you 
to forget that at the end of 15 years, your mortgage payments disappear, 
whereas with the 30-year mortgage, you still have 15 more years’ worth of 
monthly payments to go. So although you do have a higher required monthly 
payment with the 15-year mortgage, check out the difference in the total pay-
ments and interest on the two mortgage options:
Mortgage Option
Total Payments
Total Interest
15-year mortgage
$194,147
$74,147
30-year mortgage
$294,700
$174,700
Note: In case you’re curious about how we got the total interest amount, we 
simply subtracted the amount of the loan repaid ($120,000) from the “Total 
Payments.” Also, the monthly payment numbers previously cited, as well as 
these total payments and interest numbers, are rounded off, so if you try mul-
tiplying 180 or 360 by the monthly payment numbers, you won’t get answers 
identical to these numbers.
With the 30-year mortgage (compared with the 15-year mortgage), because 
you’re borrowing the money over 15 additional years, it shouldn’t come as 
a great surprise that (with a decent-size mortgage loan like this one) you 
end up paying more than $100,000 additional interest. The 30-year loan isn’t 
necessarily inferior; for example, its lower payments may better allow you to 
accomplish other important financial goals, such as saving in a tax-deductible 
retirement account. (See Chapter 6 for more information about 15-year 
versus 30-year mortgages.)

 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
In the early years of repaying your mortgage, nearly all of your mortgage pay-
ment goes toward paying interest on the money that you borrowed. Not until 
the later years of your mortgage do you begin to rapidly pay down your loan 
balance, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 
As interest rates increase, so does the time required to pay off half the loan. 
For example, at a 10 percent interest rate, paying off half the loan takes almost 
24 years of the loan’s 30-year term, and at a 14 percent interest rate, paying off 
half the loan takes over 25 years of the loan’s 30-year life.

Lender’s limits
Because we’ve personally seen the financial consequences of people borrow-
ing too much (yet still staying within the boundaries of what mortgage lenders 
allow), you won’t hear us saying in this section that lenders can tell you the 
amount you can afford to spend on a home. They can’t. All that mortgage lend-
ers can do is tell you their criteria for approving and denying mortgage appli-
cations and calculating the maximum that you’re eligible to borrow. (For the 
inside scoop on lenders and their limits, see the first section of this chapter.)
 
Most, but by no means all, mortgage lenders follow similar loan-evaluation 
criteria because they actually sell the mortgage loans they originate in the 
financial markets to picky investors. Fannie Mae (FNMA: the Federal National 
Mortgage Association) and Ginnie Mae (GNMA: the Government National 
Mortgage Association) guarantee the repayment of principal and interest on 
such loans so long as the bank that originates the mortgage adheres to certain 
specific criteria for accepting or rejecting the mortgage loan. Perhaps, in the 
often-confusing world of investments, you’ve heard of Ginnie Maes. Well, when 
you invest in these mortgage-backed securities, what you’re basically buying 
are bonds that are mortgages — perhaps even yours!
Mortgage lenders tally up your monthly housing expense, the components of 
which they consider to be
Mortgage payment
(PI for principal 
and interest)
Property taxes
(T for taxes)
Insurance
(I for insurance)
_________________________________________
Lender’s definition of housing expense 
(PITI is the common acronym)
For a given property that you’re considering buying, a mortgage lender calcu-
lates the housing expense and normally requires that it not exceed a certain 
percentage (typically around 35 percent or so) of your monthly before-tax 
(gross) income. (Some lenders allow the percentage to go a bit higher.) So, 
for example, if your monthly gross income is $6,000, your lender will not 
allow your expected monthly housing expense to exceed $2,100 (if the lender 
is using 35 percent). When you’re self-employed and complete IRS Form 1040, 
Schedule C, mortgage lenders use your after-expenses (net) income, from the 
bottom line of Schedule C.
 
Now, if you’ve been paying attention thus far in this chapter, you should smell 
something terribly wrong with such a simplistic, one-number-fits-all approach. 
This housing-expense ratio completely ignores almost all your other financial 
goals, needs, and obligations. It also ignores maintenance and remodeling 
expenses, which can gobble up a lot of a homeowner’s dough.

45
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
About the only other financial considerations a lender takes into account 
(besides your income) are your other debts. Specifically, mortgage lenders 
examine the required monthly payments for student loans, an auto loan, 
credit card bills, and other debts. In addition to the percentage of your 
income lenders allow for housing expenses, lenders typically allow an addi-
tional 5 percent of your monthly income to go toward other debt repayments. 
Thus, your monthly housing expense and monthly repayment of nonhousing 
debts can total up to, but generally be no more than, 40 percent.
 
Should you have consumer debt, be sure to read Chapter 2. Suffice it to say 
here that you should get out (and stay out) of consumer debt. Consumer debt 
has a high cost, and unlike the interest on a mortgage loan, the interest on 
consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible. And consumer debt handicaps your abil-
ity to qualify for and pay back your mortgage. Consumer debt is the financial 
equivalent of cancer.
Figuring the size of your mortgage payments
Calculating the size of your mortgage payment, after you know the amount 
you want to borrow, is simple. The hard part for most people is determin-
ing how much they can afford to borrow. If you already know how large a 
monthly mortgage payment you can afford, terrific! Go to the head of the 
class. Suppose that you work through your budget in Chapter 2 and calculate 
that you can afford to spend $1,500 per month on housing. Determining the 
exact amount of mortgage that allows you to stay within this boundary is a 
little challenging, because the housing cost you figure that you can afford 
($1,500, in our example) is made up of several components. Lucky for you, 
we cover each of these components in this chapter, including mortgage pay-
ments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. (Note that although lend-
ers don’t care about maintenance expenses in figuring what you can afford to 
buy, you shouldn’t overlook this significant expense.)
As you change the amount that you’re willing to spend on a home, the size 
of the mortgage you choose to take out also usually changes, but so do the 
other property cost components. So you may have to play with the numbers 
a bit to get them to work out just right. You may pick a certain home and 
then figure the property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and the like. When 
you tally everything up, you may find that the total comes in above or below 
your desired target ($1,500, in our example). Obviously, if you come out a 
little high, you need to cut back a bit and choose a slightly less-costly prop-
erty and/or get a smaller mortgage.
Using Table 3-1, you can calculate the size of your mortgage payments based 
on the amount you want to borrow, the loan’s interest rate, and the length (in 
years) the mortgage payments last. To determine the monthly payment on a 
mortgage, simply multiply the relevant number from Table 3-1 by the size of 
your mortgage expressed in (divided by) thousands of dollars. For example, 
if you take out a $150,000, 30-year mortgage at 7.50 percent, multiply 150 by 
7.00 (from Table 3-1) to arrive at a $1,050 monthly payment.

Stretching more than lenders allow
Sometimes, prospective home buyers feel that 
they can handle more debt than lenders will 
allow. Such home buyers may seek to borrow 
more money from family or fib on their mortgage 
application about their income. (Self-employed 
people have the greatest opportunity to do this.) 
Such behavior isn’t unlike the shenanigans of 
some teenagers who drive above the speed 
limit, drink and smoke forbidden things, or stay 
out past curfew and sneak in the back door.
Although a few of these teenagers get away 
with such risky behavior, others end up in trou-
ble academically or psychologically (or worse). 
The same is true of homeowners who stretch 
themselves financially thin to buy a more costly 
property. Some survive just fine, but others end 
up in financial and emotional trouble.
And, increasingly, home buyers who lie on 
their mortgage applications are getting caught. 
How? When you’re ready to close on your loan, 
lenders can (and often do) ask you to sign a 
form authorizing them to request a copy of your 
income tax return from the IRS. This allows the 
lender to validate your income. (See Chapter 7 
for more details.)
So although we’ve said that the lender’s word 
isn’t the gospel as to how much home you can 
truly afford, we will go on record as saying that 
telling the truth on your mortgage application 
is the only way to go (and prevents you from 
committing perjury and fraud). Telling the truth 
is not only honest but also helps keep you from 
getting in over your head. Bankers don’t want 
you to default on your loan, and you shouldn’t 
want to take the risk of doing so either.

49
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
Property taxes
If you live and breathe, escaping taxes is darn near impossible. When you 
buy and own a home, your local government (typically through what’s called 
a county tax collector’s office or an equivalent for your local town) sends you 
an annual, lump-sum bill for property taxes. Receiving this bill and paying it 
are never much fun because most communities bill you just once or twice 
per year. And some homeowners find it aggravating to be paying so much 
in property taxes on top of all the federal and state income and sales taxes 
they pay. In case you’re wondering, property taxes go toward expenses of the 
local community, such as the public schools and snow plowing (for those of 
us foolish enough to locate where the winters are cold). Especially in higher-
cost areas with few retail and commercial properties paying taxes, residential 
property taxes can be quite significant.
Should you make a small down payment (typically defined as less than 20 per-
cent of the purchase price), many lenders insist on property tax and insurance 
impound accounts. These accounts require you to pay your property taxes and 
insurance to the lender each month along with your mortgage payment.
 
Property taxes are typically based on the value of a property. Although an 
average property tax rate is about 1.5 percent of the property’s purchase 
price per year, you should understand what the exact rate is in your area. Call 
the tax collector’s office (you can find the phone number in the government 
pages section of your local phone directory under such headings as “Tax 
Collector,” “Treasurer,” or “Assessor”) in the town where you’re contemplat-
ing buying a home and ask what the property tax rate is and what additional 
fees and assessments may apply.
Be careful to make sure that you’re comparing apples with apples when 
comparing communities and their property taxes. For example, some com-
munities may nickel-and-dime you for extra assessments for services that are 
included in the standard property tax bills of other communities.
 
Real estate listings, which are typically prepared by real estate agents, may 
list what the current property owner is paying in taxes. But relying on such 
data to understand what your real estate taxes will be if you buy the property 
can be financially dangerous. The current owner’s taxes may be based on an 
outdated and much lower property valuation. Just as it’s dangerous to drive 
forward by looking in the rearview mirror of your car, you shouldn’t buy a 
property and budget for property taxes based on the current owner’s taxes. 
Your property taxes (if you buy the home) may be recalculated based on the 
price you pay for the property.

Insurance
When you purchase a home, your mortgage lender almost surely won’t allow 
you to close the purchase until you demonstrate that you have proper home-
owners insurance. Lenders aren’t being paternalistic, but self-interested. You 
see, if you buy the home and make a down payment of, say, 20 percent of the 
purchase price, the lender is putting up the other 80 percent of the purchase 
price. So if the home burns to the ground and is a total loss, the lender may 
care more, at least financially, than you do. In most states, your home is the 
lender’s security for the loan.
Some lenders, in years past, learned the hard way that some homeowners may 
not care about losing their homes. In some cases, where homes were total 
losses, homeowners with little financial stake in the property and insufficient 
insurance coverage simply walked away from the problem and left the lender 
with the financial mess. Because of cases like this, almost all lenders today 
require you to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) if you put down less 
than 20 percent of the purchase price when you buy. (We discuss PMI further 
later in this chapter, in the section titled “The 20 percent solution.”)
When you buy a home, you should want to protect your investment in the 
property (as well as cover the not-so-inconsequential cost of replacing your 
personal property, if it’s ever damaged or stolen). In short order, your cloth-
ing, furniture, kitchen appliances, and beer can collection can tally up to a lot 
of dollars to replace.
 
When you purchase homeowners insurance, you should buy the most com-
prehensive coverage that you can and take the highest deductible that you 
can afford to help minimize the cost. In Chapter 13, we explain how to do 
all that. To estimate what homeowners insurance may cost you, we suggest 
you contact some of the insurers we recommend in Chapter 13. Explain to 
them what type and price range of properties you’re considering buying in 
which communities (zip codes), and they should be able to give you a ball-
park monthly cost estimate for insurance. Calling insurance agents now also 
enables you to begin to evaluate which insurers offer the service and coverage 
you desire when the time comes to actually buy your dream home.

51
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
Just as you should do when you shop for a car, get quotes on insuring prop-
erties as you evaluate them, or ask current owners what they pay for their 
coverage. (Just remember that some homeowners overpay or don’t buy the 
right kind of protection, so don’t take what they pay as gospel.) If you over-
look insurance costs until after you agree to buy a property, you could be in 
for a rude awakening.

Maintenance and other costs
As a homeowner, you must make your mortgage and property tax payments. 
If you don’t, you’ll eventually lose your home. Homes also require mainte-
nance over the years. You must do some kinds of maintenance (repairs, for 
example) at a certain time. You never know precisely when you may need 
to fix an electrical problem, patch a leaking roof, or replace the washer and 
dryer — until the problem rears its ugly head, which is why maintenance is 
difficult to budget for. (Painting and other elective improvements can take 
place at your discretion.)
 
As a rule of thumb, expect to spend about 1 percent of your home’s purchase 
price each year on maintenance. So, for example, if you spend $150,000 on a 
home, you should budget about $1,500 per year (or about $125 per month) 
for maintenance. Although some years you may spend less, other years you 
may spend more. When your home’s roof goes, for example, replacing it may 
cost you several years’ worth of your budgeted maintenance expenses. With 
some types of housing, such as condominiums, you actually pay monthly dues 
into a homeowners association, which takes care of the maintenance for the 
complex. In that case, you’re responsible for maintaining only the interior of 
your unit. Before you buy such a unit, check with the association to see what 
the dues are and whether any new assessments are planned for future repairs. 
(See Chapter 8 for more information.)
In addition to necessary maintenance, you should be aware (and beware) of 
what you may spend on nonessential home improvements. This Other 
category can really get you into trouble. Advertisements, your neighbors, and 
your coworkers can all entice you into blowing big bucks on new furniture, 
endless remodeling projects, landscaping, and you name it.

52
Par t I: Home Economics 
 
Budget for these nonessentials; otherwise, your home can become a money 
pit by causing you to spend too much, not save enough, and (possibly) go 
into debt via credit cards and the like. (We cover the other dangers of overim-
provement in Chapter 8.) Unless you’re a terrific saver, can easily accomplish 
your savings goal, and have lots of slack in your budget, be sure not to over-
look this part of your home-expense budget.
The amount you expect to spend on improvements is just a guess. It depends 
on how finished the home is that you buy and on your personal tastes and 
desires. Consider your previous spending behavior and the types of projects 
you expect to do as you examine potential homes for purchase.

The tax benefits of homeownership
One of homeownership’s benefits is that the IRS and most state governments 
allow you to deduct, within certain limits, mortgage interest and property 
taxes when you file your annual income tax return. When you file your 
Federal IRS Form 1040, the mortgage interest and property taxes on your 
home are itemized deductions on Schedule A (see Figure 3-2). On mortgage 
loans now taken out, you may deduct the interest on the first $1 million of 
debt, as well as all the property taxes. The good folks at the IRS also allow 
you to deduct the interest costs on a home equity loan (second mortgage) to 
a maximum of $100,000 borrowed.
Just because mortgage interest and property taxes are allowable deductions 
on your income tax return, don’t think that the government is literally paying 
for these items for you. Consider that when you earn a dollar of income and 
must pay income tax on that dollar, you don’t pay the entire dollar back to 
the government in taxes. Your tax bracket (see Table 3-2) determines the 
amount of taxes you pay on that dollar.

Tax difference between maintenance 
and improvements
While you own your home, it’s in your interest 
to track the amount that you spend on improve-
ments. Why? Well, when you sell your home 
someday, the IRS allows you to exclude from 
taxation that portion of your profit that was 
due to capital improvements. (As we discuss 
in Chapter 17, IRS home-sale tax rules also 
enable qualifying taxpayers to exclude from 
federal taxation a large chunk of profit — up to 
$250,000 for single taxpayers, $500,000 for mar-
ried couples filing jointly.)
For tax purposes, the IRS enables you to add 
the cost of improvements (but not money spent 
on maintenance) to your original purchase 
price. What’s the difference? Well, there is a 
difference, but as with all matters on which the 
IRS has an opinion, that difference isn’t always 
crystal clear.
 ✓ Capital improvements are things you do 
to your home that permanently increase 
its value and lengthen its life. Capital 
improvements include such things as land-
scaping your yard, adding a deck, purchas-
ing new appliances (as long as you leave 
them when you sell), installing a new heat-
ing system or roof, remodeling and adding 
rooms, and so on.
 ✓ Maintenance and repair expenses, in con-
trast, include those types of fix-up items 
that need to be done throughout your home 
from time to time. Maintenance and repairs 
include such things as fixing a leaky pipe or 
toilet, painting, paying someone to cut your 
lawn and pull weeds, and the like.
So when you buy a home, keep handy a file 
folder into which you can dump receipts for 
your home-improvement expenditures. If 
you’re in doubt as to whether an expense is an 
improvement or a maintenance item, keep the 
receipt and figure it out when the time comes 
to sell your home.

55
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
 
Technically, you pay federal and state taxes, so you should consider your 
state tax savings as well when calculating your home-ownership tax savings. 
However, to keep things simple and still get a reliable estimate, simply mul-
tiply your mortgage payment and property taxes by your federal income tax 
rate. This shortcut works well because the small portion of your mortgage 
payment that isn’t deductible (because it’s for the loan repayment) approxi-
mately offsets the overlooked state tax savings.

The deductibility of the mortgage interest on up to $1 million borrowed 
covers debt on both your primary residence and a second residence. (Buying 
and maintaining two homes is an expensive proposition and something few 
people can afford, so don’t get any silly ideas from our mentioning this tax 
tidbit!)
Congratulations! You’ve totaled what your dream home should cost you 
on a monthly basis after factoring in the tax benefits of homeownership. 
Don’t forget to plug these expected home-ownership costs into your current 
monthly spending plans (see Chapter 2) to make sure that you can afford to 
spend this much on a home and still accomplish your financial goals.
Closing Costs
On the day when a home becomes yours officially, known as closing day, 
many people (in addition to the seller) will have their hands in your wallet. 
Myriad one-time closing costs can leave you poorer or send you running to 
your relatives for financial assistance.
We don’t want you to be unable to close your home purchase or be forced to 
get down on your hands and knees and beg for money from your mother-in-
law. (Not only is such groveling hard on your ego, but also, she may expect 
grandchildren pronto.) Advance preparation for the closing costs saves your 
sanity and your finances.

Here are some typical closing costs (listed from those that are usually largest 
to those that are typically tiniest) and how much to budget for each (exact 
fees vary by property cost and location):
 
✓ Loan origination fees (points) and other loan charges: These fees 
and charges range from nothing to 3 percent of the amount borrowed. 
Lenders generally charge all sorts of fees for things such as appraising 
the property, pulling your credit report, preparing loan documents, and 
processing your application, as well as charging a loan origination fee, 
which may be 1 or 2 percent of the loan amount. If you’re strapped for 
cash, you can get a loan that has few or no fees; however, such loans 
have substantially higher interest rates over their lifetimes. As Chapter 
12 explains, you may be able to cut a deal with the seller to pay these 
loan-closing costs.
 
✓ Escrow fees: Escrow fees range from several hundred to over a thou-
sand dollars, based on your home’s purchase price. These fees cover 
the cost of handling all the purchase-related documents and funds. We 
explain escrows in much more detail in Chapters 9 and 14.
 
✓ Homeowners insurance: This insurance typically costs several hundred 
to a thousand-plus dollars per year, depending on your home’s value 
and how much coverage you want. As we discuss earlier in this chapter, 
you can’t get a mortgage unless you prove to the lender that you have 
adequate homeowners insurance coverage. Promising to get this cover-
age isn’t enough; lenders usually insist that you pay the first year’s pre-
mium on said insurance policy at closing.
 
✓ Title insurance: This insurance typically costs several hundred to a 
thousand dollars, depending on the home’s purchase price. Lenders 
require that you purchase title insurance when you buy your home to 
make sure that you have clear, marketable title to the property. Among 
other things, title insurance protects you and the lender against the 
remote possibility that the person selling you the home doesn’t legally 
own it. We discuss title insurance in detail in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Property taxes: These taxes typically cost several hundred to a couple 
thousand dollars and are based on the home’s purchase price and the 
date that escrow closes. At the close of escrow, you may have to reim-
burse the sellers for any property taxes that they paid in advance. For 
example, suppose that (before they sell their home to you) the sellers 
have already paid their property taxes through June 30. If the sale closes 
on April 30, you owe the sellers two months’ property taxes — the tax 
collector won’t refund the property taxes they’ve already paid for May 
and June.
 
✓ Legal fees: These fees range anywhere from nothing to hundreds of dol-
lars. In some Eastern states, lawyers are routinely involved in real estate 
purchases. In most states, however, lawyers aren’t needed for home 
purchases as long as the real estate agents use standard, fill-in-the-blank 
contracts. Such contracts have the advance input and blessing of the 
legal eagles.

57
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
 
✓ Inspections: Inspection fees can run from $200 to $1,000 (depending on 
the property’s size and the scope of the inspection). As we explain in 
Chapter 13, you should never, ever consider buying a home without 
inspecting it. Because you’re likely not a home-inspection expert, you 
benefit from hiring someone who inspects property as a full-time job. 
Sometimes you simply pay these costs directly; other times you pay 
these costs at closing.
 
✓ Private mortgage insurance (PMI): Should you need it, this insurance 
can cost you several hundred dollars — or more — annually. As we 
explain in the next section, if you put less than 20 percent down on a 
home, many mortgage lenders require that you take out private mortgage 
insurance. This type of insurance protects the lender in the event that 
you default on the loan. At closing, you need to pay anywhere from a 
couple months’ premiums to more than a year’s premium in advance. If 
you can, avoid this cost by making a 20 percent down payment or by 
obtaining 80-10-10 financing, which we explain in the section “Ways to 
buy with less money down,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Prepaid loan interest: Lenders charge up to 30 days’ interest on your 
loan to cover the interest that accrues from the date your loan is funded 
(usually, one business day before the escrow closes) up to 30 days prior 
to your first regularly scheduled loan payment. How much interest you 
actually have to pay depends on the timing of your first loan payment. 
If you’re smart, and we know that you are, you can work out this timing 
with the lender so you don’t have to pay any advance loan interest.
 
 To avoid paying three useless days of interest charges, never schedule 
your escrow to close on a Monday. Should you close on a Monday, the 
lender has to put your mortgage funds into escrow the preceding Friday. 
As a result, you’re charged interest on your loan for Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday even though you won’t own the home until escrow closes 
on Monday. (This little tip more than pays for this book all by itself. Don’t 
you feel smart now?)
 
✓ Recording: The fee to record the deed and mortgage usually runs 
about $50.
 
✓ Overnight/courier fees: These fees usually cost $50 or less. Remember 
the times when you sent something via the U.S. Postal Service to a des-
tination that you could have driven to in less than a few hours, and it 
took them the better part of a week to get it there (or perhaps they lost 
it)? Well, lenders and other players in real estate deals know that these 
snags can occur without warning, and because they don’t want to derail 
your transaction or cost themselves money, they often send stuff the 
fastest way they can. And why not — it’s your money!
 
✓ Notary: Notary fees run from $10 to $20 per signature per buyer. At the 
close of escrow, you sign all sorts of important documents pledging your 
worldly possessions and firstborn child, should you renege on your mort-
gage. Therefore, you need to have your signature verified by a notary so 
everybody in the transaction knows that you really are who you say 
you are.

58
Par t I: Home Economics 
As you can see, closing costs can mount up in a hurry. In a typical real estate 
deal, closing costs total 2 to 5 percent of the property’s purchase price. Thus, 
you shouldn’t ignore them in figuring the amount of money you need to close 
the deal. Having enough to pay the down payment on your loan just isn’t 
sufficient.
 
When you’re short of cash and hot to buy a home sooner rather than later, 
you can take out a mortgage with no out-of-pocket fees and points (see 
Chapter 6) and try to negotiate with the property seller to pay other closing 
costs (see Chapter 12). Expect to pay a higher mortgage interest rate for a 
low-up-front-fee loan. And all other things being equal, expect to pay a higher 
purchase price (with a correspondingly bigger mortgage) to entice the seller 
to pay your other closing costs. Also, don’t blindly accept all the closing costs 
come closing time. In Chapter 14, we explain the importance of auditing your 
closing statement.
Accumulating the Down Payment
Jeremy went house hunting and soon fell in love with a home. Unfortunately, 
after he found his dream home, he soon discovered all the loan-documentation 
requirements and the extra fees and penalties he would have to pay for having 
such a small down payment. Ultimately, he couldn’t afford to buy the home 
that he desired because he hadn’t saved enough. “If I had known, I would 
have started saving much sooner — I thought that saving for the future was 
something you did when you turned middle-aged,” he told Eric.
 
We don’t want you to be surprised when you finally set out to purchase a 
home. That’s why now, in the comfort of your rental, commuter train, or bus 
(or anywhere else you may be reading this book), we’d like you to consider 
the following:
 
✓ How much money you should save for the down payment and closing 
costs for the purchase of your home
 
✓ Where your down-payment money is going to come from
 
✓ How you should invest this money while you’re awaiting the purchase 
and closing
The 20 percent solution
Ideally, when buying a home you should have enough money accumulated 
for a down payment of 20 percent of the property’s purchase price. Why 20 
percent and not 10 or 15 or 25 or 30 percent? Twenty percent down is the 
magic number because it’s generally a big enough cushion to protect lenders 
from default. Suppose, for example, that a buyer puts only 10 percent down, 

59
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
property values drop 5 percent, and the buyer defaults on the loan. When 
the lender forecloses — after paying a real estate commission, transfer tax, 
and other expenses of sale — the lender will be in the hole. Lenders don’t 
like losing money. They’ve found that they’re far less likely to lose money 
on mortgages where the borrower has put up a down payment of at least 
20 percent of the property’s value. (Unfortunately, lenders and the folks in 
Washington forgot this fact, which led to the late 2000s real estate market 
problems and high levels of foreclosures.)
If, like most people, you plan to borrow money from a bank or other mort-
gage lender, be aware that almost all require you to obtain (and pay for) 
private mortgage insurance (PMI) if your down payment is less than 20 per-
cent of the property’s purchase price. Although PMI typically adds several 
hundred dollars annually to your loan’s cost, it protects the lender financially 
if you default. Should you buy an expensive home — into the hundreds-of-
thousands-of-dollars price range — PMI can add $1,000 or more, annually, to 
your mortgage bill. (When you make a down payment of less than 20 percent, 
you can also expect worse loan terms, such as higher up-front fees and/or a 
higher ongoing interest rate on a mortgage.)
 
PMI isn’t a permanent cost. Your need for PMI vanishes when you can prove 
that you have at least 20 percent equity (home value minus loan balance 
outstanding) in the property. The 20 percent can come from loan paydown, 
appreciation, improvements that enhance the property’s value, or any combi-
nation thereof. Note also that to remove PMI, most mortgage lenders require 
that an appraisal be done — at your expense.
Note: If you have (or expect to have) the 20 percent down payment and 
enough money for the closing costs, skip the next section and go to the sec-
tion on how to invest your down payment money.
Ways to buy with less money down
Especially if you’re just starting to save or are still paying off student loans 
or worse — digging out from consumer debt — saving 20 percent of a prop-
erty’s purchase price as a down payment plus closing costs can seem like a 
financial mountain.
Don’t panic, and don’t give up. Here’s a grab bag filled with time-tested ways 
to overcome this seemingly gargantuan obstacle:
 
✓ Boost your savings rate. Say that you want to accumulate $30,000 for 
your home purchase, and you’re saving just $100 per month. At this 
rate, it will take you nearly two decades to reach your savings goal! 
However, if you can boost your savings rate by $300 per month, you 
should reach your goal in about five years.

60
Par t I: Home Economics 
 
 Being efficient with your spending is always a good financial habit, but 
saving faster is a necessity for nearly all prospective home buyers. Without 
benevolent, loaded relatives or other sources for a financial windfall, you’re 
going to need to accumulate money the old-fashioned way that millions 
of other home buyers have done in the past: by gradually saving it. Most 
people have fat in their budgets. Start by reading Chapter 2 for ways to 
assess your current spending and boost your savings rate.
 
✓ Set your sights lower. Twenty percent of a big number is a big number, 
so it stands to reason that 20 percent of a smaller number is a smaller 
number. If the down payment and closing costs needed to purchase a 
$300,000 home are stretching you, scale back to a $240,000 or $200,000 
home, which should slash your required cash for the home purchase by 
about 20 to 33 percent.
 
✓ Check out low-down-payment loan programs. Some lenders offer low-
down-payment mortgage programs where you can put down, say, 10 per-
cent of the purchase price. To qualify for such programs, you generally 
must have excellent credit and purchase private mortgage insurance 
(PMI). In addition to the extra expense of PMI, expect to get worse loan 
terms — higher interest rates and more up-front fees — with such low-
money-down loans. Check with local lenders and real estate agents in 
your area.
 
 Unless you’re champing at the bit to purchase a home, take more time, 
and try to accumulate a larger down payment. However, if you’re the 
type of person who has trouble saving and may never save a 20 percent 
down payment, buying with less money down may be your best option. 
In this situation, be sure to shop around for the best loan terms.
 
✓ Access retirement accounts. Some employers allow you to borrow 
against your retirement-savings plan. Just be sure that you understand 
the repayment rules so that you don’t get tripped up and forced to 
treat the withdrawal as a taxable distribution. You’re allowed to make 
penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts for a first-
time home purchase (see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Get family help. Your folks or grandparents may like, perhaps even 
love, to help you with the down payment and closing costs for your 
dream home. Why would they do that? Well, perhaps they had finan-
cial assistance from family when they bought a home, way back when. 
Another possibility is that they have more money accumulated for 
their future and retirement than they may need. If they have substan-
tial assets, holding onto all these assets until their death could trigger 
unnecessary estate taxes. A final reason they may be willing to lend you 
money is that they’re bank-and-bond-type investors and are earning 
paltry returns.
 
 If your parents or grandparents (or other family members, for that 
matter) broach the topic of giving or lending you money for a home 
purchase, go ahead and discuss the matter. But in many situations, you 

61
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
(as the prospective home buyer) may need to raise the issue first. Some 
parents just aren’t comfortable bringing up the topic of money or may 
be worried that you’ll take their offer in the wrong way.
 
✓ Look into seller financing. Some sellers don’t need all the cash from the 
sale of their property when the transaction closes escrow. These sellers 
may be willing to offer you a second mortgage to help you buy their 
property. In fact, they often advertise that they’re willing to assist with 
financing. Seller financing is usually due and payable in five to ten years. 
This gives you time to build up equity or save enough to refinance into 
a new, larger, 80 percent conventional mortgage before the seller’s loan 
comes due.
 
 Be cautious about seller financing. Some sellers who offer property with 
built-in financing are trying to dump a house that has major defects. 
It’s also possible that the house may be priced far above its fair market 
value. Before accepting seller financing, make sure that the property 
doesn’t have fatal flaws (have a thorough inspection conducted, as we 
discuss in Chapter 13) and is priced competitively. Also be sure that the 
seller financing interest rate is as low as or lower than the rate you can 
obtain through a traditional mortgage lender.
 
✓ Check out 80-10-10 financing. It’s called 80-10-10 because a bank, 
savings and loan association, or other institutional lender makes a 
traditional 80 percent first mortgage, and you get a 10 percent second 
mortgage and make a cash down payment equal to 10 percent of the 
home’s purchase price. You can get the second mortgage either from 
the institutional lender that provides the 80 percent first mortgage or 
from the previously mentioned seller. From a lender’s perspective, 
80-10-10 financing is as good as 20 percent down. Mortgages For Dummies 
(Wiley), which we cowrote, delves into the intricacies of special situa-
tion loans like this.
 
✓ Get partners. With many things in life, there is strength in numbers. You 
may be able to get more home for your money and may need to come 
up with less up-front cash if you find partners for a multiunit real estate 
purchase. For example, you could find one or two other partners and go 
in together to purchase a duplex or triplex.
 
 Getting involved in the real estate version of Siamese twins or triplets 
isn’t without risk, however. Before you go into a partnership to buy a 
building, be sure to consider all the “what ifs.” (What if one of you wants 
out after a year? What if one of you fails to pay the pro-rata share of 
expenses? What if one of you wants to remodel and the other doesn’t? 
And so forth.) Have a lawyer prepare a partnership agreement that 
explicitly delineates how issues like these will be dealt with. Otherwise, 
you could face some major disagreements down the road, even if you 
go in together with friends or people you think you know well. We cover 
the pros and cons of partnerships in Chapter 8.

Par t I: Home Economics 
Where to invest the down payment
 
As with all informed investing decisions, which investment(s) you consider for 
money earmarked for your down payment should be determined by how soon 
you need the money back. The longer the time frame during which you can 
invest, the more growth-oriented and riskier (that is, more volatile) an invest-
ment you may consider. Conversely, when you have a short time frame — five 
years or less — during which you can invest, choosing volatile investments is 
dangerous.
When the stock market is rising, as it did so often in the 1990s, some folks are 
tempted to keep down payment money in stocks. After all, when you’re get-
ting returns of 20 percent or more annually, you’ll reach your down payment 
savings goal far more quickly. Greedier investors lusting after high-flying 
technology and Internet stocks that seem to double in value every 90 days 
hope to quickly parlay their small savings for a shack into a money mountain 
for a mansion.
 
Investing down payment money in stocks is a dangerous strategy. Your 
expected home purchase may be delayed for years due to a sinking invest-
ment portfolio. Stocks are a generally inappropriate investment for down 
payment money you expect to tap within the next five years. More aggressive 
individual stocks should have an even longer time horizon — ideally, seven 
to ten or more years. Consider what happened to the home buying dreams 
of folks who foolishly parked their home-down-payment money in the stock 
market before and during the severe stock market decline of the early 2000s 
and the steep decline of 2007–08.
Investments for five years or less
Most prospective home buyers aren’t in a position to take many risks with 
their down payment money. The sooner you expect to buy, the less risk 
you should take. Unless you don’t expect to buy for at least five years, you 
shouldn’t even consider investing in more growth-oriented investments, such 
as stocks.
Although it may appear boring, the first (and likely best) place for accumulat-
ing your down payment money is in a money market mutual fund. As with 
bank savings accounts, money market mutual funds don’t put your principal 
at risk — the value of your original investment (principal) doesn’t fluctuate. 
Rather, you simply earn interest on the money that you’ve invested. Money 
market funds invest in supersafe investments, such as Treasury bills, bank 
certificates of deposit, and commercial paper (short-term IOUs issued by the 
most creditworthy corporations).

63
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
 
Money market funds are one of the three major types of mutual funds — the 
other two being those that focus on bonds (bond funds) and those that focus 
on stocks (stock or equity funds). Many people think of mutual funds as being 
risky investments, partly because they equate funds with stock market invest-
ing. However, the reality is that under Securities and Exchange Commission 
regulations, money market funds can invest only in safe securities, and money 
funds’ investments must have an average maturity of less than 90 days. The 
short-term nature of these funds eliminates the risk of money market funds’ 
being sensitive to changes in interest rates in the way that bonds and bond 
funds are.
Although some bank savings accounts pay reasonable interest rates, nearly 
all pay less in interest than the best money market funds. Why? Because 
banks aren’t as efficient and low-cost as money markets. Who do you think is 
paying for the rent in all those bank branches, anyway?
Buying a home with “no money down”
More than a few books written by (and high-
priced seminars led by) real estate “gurus” 
claim that not only can you buy property with no 
money down but also that you can make piles of 
money doing so. A generation ago, this way of 
thinking was popularized by Robert Allen in his 
book Nothing Down.
Allen says that the key to buying property with 
no money down is to find a seller who’s a don’t-
wanter — that is, someone who “will do anything 
to get rid of his property.” Why would someone 
be that desperate? Well, perhaps the person is in 
financial trouble because of a job loss, an over-
extension of credit, or a major illness.
Perhaps when more people used to live in 
smaller, tight-knit communities where every-
one supported one another, this type of vulture 
capitalism may not have flourished. But in these 
times, Allen says, a don’t-wanter can offer you 
the most favorable mortgage terms, such as a 
low down payment and interest rate.
How do you find such downtrodden souls who 
are just waiting for you to take advantage of 
them? According to Allen’s estimates, 10 percent 
of the sellers in the real estate market are don’t-
wanters. Simply call people who have property 
listed for sale in the newspaper, or place ads 
yourself saying that you’ll buy in a hurry.
In our experience, finding homes that can be 
bought with no money down isn’t easy to do. If 
you can find such a desperate seller, be aware 
that the property may have major flaws. If the 
property were a good one, logic dictates that 
the seller wouldn’t have to sell under such 
lousy terms. Should you have the patience to 
hunt around and sift through perhaps hundreds 
of properties to find a good one available with 
seller financing at no money down, be our 
guest. Just don’t expect the task to be easy or 
all that lucrative. Better to look for good prop-
erties and low-down-payment lender financing 
and to start saving a healthy down payment so 
that you can qualify for a better loan.

64
Par t I: Home Economics 
 
If you really want to save through a bank, shop, shop, shop around. Smaller 
savings and loans and credit unions tend to offer more competitive yields than 
do the larger banks that spend gobs on advertising and have branches on nearly 
every corner. Remember, more overhead means lower yields for your money.
In addition to higher yields, the best money market funds offer check writing 
(so that you can easily access your money) and come in tax-free versions. 
If you’re in a higher income tax bracket, a tax-free money market fund may 
allow you to earn a higher effective yield than a money fund that pays taxable 
interest. (Note: You pay tax only on money invested outside tax-sheltered 
retirement accounts.) When you’re in a high tax bracket (refer to Table 3-2 
earlier in this chapter), you should come out ahead by investing in tax-free 
money market funds. If you reside in a state with high income taxes, consider 
a state money market fund, which pays interest that’s free of both federal and 
state tax.
The better money market funds also offer telephone exchange and redemp-
tion and automated, electronic exchange services with your bank account. 
Automatic investment comes in handy for accumulating your down payment 
for a home purchase. Once per month, for example, you can have money 
zapped from your bank account into your money market fund.
 
Because a particular type of money market fund (general, Treasury, or tax-
free municipal) is basically investing in the same securities as its competitors, 
opt for a fund that keeps lean-and-mean expenses. A money fund’s operating 
expenses, which are deducted before payment of dividends, are the major 
factor in determining its yield. As with the high overhead of bank branches, 
the higher a money fund’s operating expenses, the lower its yield. Excellent 
money funds from the best mutual fund companies are yours for the asking for 
annual operating expenses of 0.5 percent or less. We recommend good ones in 
this section.
When you’re not in a high federal-tax bracket, and you’re not in a high state-
tax bracket (that is, you pay less than 5 percent in state taxes), consider the 
following taxable money market funds for your home down payment money:
 
✓ Fidelity Cash Reserves ($2.5K to open)
 
✓ Fidelity’s Money Market (higher yields if you have $25K to invest)
 
✓ T. Rowe Price Summit Cash Reserves ($25K to open)
 
✓ Vanguard’s Prime Money Market ($3K to open)
You can invest in a money market fund that invests in U.S. Treasury money 
market funds, which have the backing of the U.S. federal government — 
for what that’s worth! From a tax standpoint, because U.S. Treasuries are 
state-tax-free but federally taxable, U.S. Treasury money market funds are 

65
 Chapter 3: What Can You Afford to Buy?
appropriate when you’re not in a high federal-tax bracket but you are in a 
high state-tax bracket (5 percent or higher). Should you choose to invest in a 
money market fund that invests in the U.S. Treasury, consider these:
 
✓ Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market ($25K to open)
 
✓ USAA’s Treasury Money Market ($3K to open)
 
✓ Vanguard Treasury Money Market ($3K to open)
 
✓ Vanguard’s Admiral Treasury Money Market (higher yields if you have 
$50K to invest)
Municipal (also known as muni) money market funds invest in short-term debt 
issued by state and local governments. A municipal money market fund, which 
pays you federally tax-free dividends, invests in munis issued by state and local 
governments throughout the country. A state-specific municipal fund invests in 
state and local government-issued munis for one state, such as New York. So if 
you live in New York and buy a New York municipal fund, the dividends on that 
fund are generally free of both federal and New York state taxes.
So how do you decide whether to buy a nationwide or state-specific munici-
pal money market fund? Federal-tax-free-only money market funds are 
appropriate when you’re in a high federal-tax bracket but not a high state-
tax bracket (less than 5 percent). Your state may not have good (or any) 
state-tax-free money market funds available. If you live in any of those states, 
you’re likely best off with one of the following national money market funds:
 
✓ T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Money Market ($25K to open)
 
✓ USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market ($3K to open)
 
✓ Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market ($3K to open)
Getting in touch with mutual fund companies
Most mutual fund companies don’t have many 
(or any) local branch offices. Generally, this 
fact helps mutual fund companies keep their 
expenses low so they can pay you greater 
yields on their money market funds.
So how do you deal with an investment com-
pany without a location near you? Simple: You 
open and maintain your mutual fund account 
via the fund’s toll-free phone line, the mail, 
and the Web. Some fund providers also have 
branch offices.

Investments for more than five years
Should you expect to hold onto your home down payment money for more 
than five years, you can comfortably consider riskier investments, such as 
longer-term bonds, as well as more conservative stocks. Eric covers these 
investments and many others in the latest editions of his books Investing For 
Dummies and Mutual Funds For Dummies (both published by Wiley).
Short-term bonds and bond funds
You may be thinking, “Three to five years is 
an awfully long time to keep my money dozing 
away in a money market fund.”
Well, yes and no. During some time periods, 
investors who buy bonds maturing in five years 
get very little in the way of extra yield versus 
what they could get in a good money market 
fund. During other periods, three-year to five-
year bonds yield a good deal more interest than 
money market funds yield.
Whenever you invest in bonds that won’t 
mature soon, you take on risk. First is the risk 
that the bond issuer may fall into financial trou-
ble between the time that you buy the bond and 
the time that it’s due to mature. Second is the 
risk that interest rates in general could greatly 
increase. If the latter happens, typically caused 
by unexpected inflation, you may end up hold-
ing a bond that pays you less interest than the 
rate of inflation.
Most of the time, bonds that mature in a few 
years should produce a slightly higher rate of 
return for you than a money market or savings 
account. However, if you invest in such bonds, 
recognize that you may end up earning the 
same (or perhaps even less) than you would 
have earned had you stuck with a money market 
fund. Rising interest rates can deflate the value 
of an investment in bonds.
Invest in bonds only if you expect to hold them 
for at least three to five years. If you want to 
invest in individual bonds and you’re not in a 
high tax bracket, consider Treasury bonds, 
which don’t require monitoring of credit risk 
— that is, unless the U.S. government slips into 
default! Also look at the yield on bank certifi-

f you’re contemplating the purchase of a home, you may be concerned 
about the future direction of home prices. After all, who wants to buy a 
home and then see prices drop? Conversely, who in their right mind wouldn’t 
love to jump into the real estate market before prices head higher? To under-
stand what drives home prices, you must examine what drives the supply of, 
and demand for, homes.
 
As we discuss what causes home prices to rise and fall in this chapter, please 
keep the following in mind: When it comes to buying and owning a home, 
don’t get too hung up on the current state of your local market. If you take 
the perspective that after you buy a home, you’re likely to own one for many 
decades, worrying about timing your purchase is generally not worth the trou-
ble. Timing — that is, buying when prices are at rock bottom and getting out 
when you think that home values are cresting — is extraordinarily difficult to 
do. We know people who started waiting for lower home prices a generation 
ago — and they’re still waiting!
Predicting what’s going to happen with real estate prices in a particular 
neighborhood, town, region, or state over the next one, two, three, or more 
years isn’t easy. Ultimately, the demand for and prices of homes in an area 
are driven largely by the economic health and vitality of that area. With an 
increase in jobs, particularly ones that pay well, comes a greater demand for 
housing.
 
If you first buy a home when you’re in your 20s, 30s, or even your 40s, you’ll 
likely end up being a homeowner for several decades or more. Over such a 
lengthy time, the real estate markets in which you have your money invested 
will surely experience more than a few ups and downs. History shows that real 
estate prices experience more and bigger ups than downs over the long term 
(check out Figure 4-1 to see what we mean), so don’t fret about the cloudiness 
of your real estate crystal ball.

 Chapter 4: Why Home Prices Rise and Fall
That said, you may be ambivalent about buying a home at particular times in 
your life. Perhaps you’re not sure that you’ll stay put for more than three to 
five years. The shorter the time period you expect to hold onto your home, 
the more important it is to be careful about when you buy. Thus, part of your 
home-buying decision may hinge on whether current home prices in your 
area offer you a good value. Even if you expect to stay put for a while, under-
standing what causes home prices to rise and fall and knowing ways to maxi-
mize your chances of getting a good buy can also be worth your while. This 
chapter helps you grasp these points.
What Drives Real Estate 
Markets and Prices?
If you’re going to buy a home, you’re making a significant investment — per-
haps the single biggest investment you’ve ever made. You can do a mountain 
of research to decide what, where, and when to buy.
In the rest of this chapter, we explain what to look for, from an investment 
standpoint, both in a community and in the property that you buy. Some of 
the information that we provide requires you to think like an investor. Of 
course, for many people, buying a home to live in is different from buying a 
piece of investment real estate to rent out.
Note: We discuss different types of properties (single-family homes, condo-
miniums, and the like) and their investment desirability in Chapter 8.
Jobs, glorious jobs
A home provides shelter from the elements and a place to store and ware-
house your consumer possessions. Because houses cost money to buy and 
maintain — and you’re likely not a descendant of the Rockefellers, the Gettys, 
or Bill Gates — you need an ongoing source of money in order to afford your 
home. Where does this money come from? A job.
Okay, you may call it your career or (even better) one of your passions. But if 
you’re like most folks, you work to pay your bills. And a home and its accom-
panying expenses are one of the biggest sources of expenses that people have 
(hence, one of the reasons we end up working so many decades as adults)!

70
Part I: Home Economics 
 
So it stands to reason that the demand for housing and the ability to pay for 
housing are deeply affected by the abundance and quality of jobs in a com-
munity or area. From an investment perspective, an ideal area where homes 
appreciate in value at a relatively high rate has the following characteristics:
 
✓ Job growth: So what if an area has hundreds of thousands or millions of 
jobs if the number of jobs is shrinking? The New York City metropolitan 
area had millions of jobs yet experienced declining real estate prices in 
the early 1990s and late 2000s because of a deteriorating job base. Job 
creation is the lifeblood of a healthy local real estate market.
 
 Check out the unemployment situation, and examine how the jobless 
rate has changed in recent years. Good signs are a declining unemploy-
ment rate and increasing job growth.
 
✓ Job diversity: No, we’re not talking about political correctness here. If a 
community is reliant on a paper manufacturer and an underwear maker 
for half of all its jobs, you ought to be wary of buying a home there. 
Should both of these companies do poorly, the real estate market will 
follow. This type of scenario has played out in smaller communities that 
were badly hurt when large defense manufacturers and military bases 
lost many employees because of defense cutbacks.
 
✓ Job quality: All jobs aren’t created equal. Which area do you think has 
faster-appreciating real estate prices: an area with more high-paying jobs 
in growth industries (such as technology) or an area that’s producing 
mostly low-pay, low-skill jobs (such as jobs in fast-food joints)? As with 
food, entertainment, and sex, quality is just as important as (if not more 
important than) quantity. When most of the jobs in a community come 
from slow-growing or shrinking employment sectors (such as farms, 
small retailers, shoe and apparel manufacturers, and government), real 
estate prices are unlikely to rise quickly in the years ahead. On the other 
hand, areas with a preponderance of high-growth industries (such as 
technology) should have a greater chance of experiencing faster price 
appreciation.
 
So how can you get your hands on data that gives you this type of perspec-
tive? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles employment and unemploy-
ment data for metropolitan areas and counties. You can find this department’s 
treasure trove of data via your computer at www.bls.gov, or try visiting a 
good local library or chamber of commerce. A real estate agent also may be 
able to help you track the data down.
Available housing
Although jobs create the demand for housing, the amount of housing avail-
able — both existing and new — is the supply side of the supply-and-demand 
equation. Even though jobs are being created, housing values may be 

71
 Chapter 4: Why Home Prices Rise and Fall
stagnant if an overabundance of available housing exists. Conversely, a rela-
tively low employment growth rate in an area with a housing shortage can 
trigger significant real estate price increases.
 
Start by examining how well the existing supply of housing is being utilized. 
Vacancy rates, which measure how much or little demand there is for existing 
rental units, are a useful indicator to investigate. The vacancy rate is calcu-
lated simply by dividing the number of empty (unrented) rental units by the 
total number of rental units available. So, for example, if 50 rental units are 
vacant in Happy Valley, Tennessee, and 1,000 total units are available, the 
vacancy rate is 5 percent (50 divided by 1,000).
A low vacancy rate (under 5 percent) is generally a good indicator of future 
real estate price appreciation. When the vacancy rate is low and declining, 
more competition for few available rental units exists (or will soon exist). 
This competition tends to drive up rental rates, making renting more expen-
sive and less attractive.
On the other hand, high vacancy rates indicate an excess supply of rentals, 
which tends to depress rents as landlords scramble to find tenants. All things 
being equal, high (more than 7 to 10 percent) and increasing vacancy rates 
are generally a sign — bad for real estate sellers and prices but good for pro-
spective home buyers.
 
In addition to checking out vacancy rates, which tell you how well the exist-
ing housing supply is being used, smart real estate investors look at what’s 
happening with building permits. In order to build new housing, a permit is 
required. The trend in the number of building permits can tell you how fast or 
how slowly the supply of real estate properties may be changing in the future.
 
A significant increase in the number of permits being issued, such as what 
happened in some areas in the early to mid-2000s, can be a red flag because 
it may signal a future glut of housing. Such increases often happen after a 
sustained rise in housing prices in an area. As prices reach a premium level, 
builders race to bring new housing to market to capitalize on the high prices.
Conversely, depressed prices or a high cost of building can lead to little new 
housing being developed. Eventually, this trend should bode well for local 
real estate prices.
The supply of housing is also determined in part by the amount of land 
available to develop. Unless you think that houseboats or landfill sites are 
the waves of the future, you’ll agree that land is needed to build housing. A 
limited supply of land generally bodes well for long-term real estate price 
appreciation in an area. Thus, real estate has appreciated very well over the 
decades (and is expensive today) in areas such as Manhattan, San Francisco, 
Hawaii, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, which are surrounded by water. Conversely, 
home prices tend to rise slowly in areas with vast tracts of developable land.

72
Part I: Home Economics 
Inventory of homes for 
sale and actual sales
Just as scads of developable land and a barrage of new buildings place a lid 
on potential real estate price increases in the future, so do escalating num-
bers of properties listed for sale. Local associations of real estate agents, 
through their Multiple Listing Service (MLS), typically track the total number 
of listings (employment agreements between a property owner and a real 
estate agent). Properties that are “for sale by owner” (that is, without an 
agent) aren’t included in this total, but such unlisted sales tend to follow the 
same trends as property listed with agents. (We aren’t aware of anyone track-
ing the total number of properties for sale by owner.)
In a normal real estate market, the number of homes listed for sale stays at a 
relatively constant level as new homes come on the market and other ones 
sell. But as property prices start to reach high levels and some real estate 
owners/investors seek to cash in and invest elsewhere, the listing inventory 
(number of listings) can increase significantly. When home prices reach a 
high level relative to the cost of renting (see the next section), increasing 
numbers of potential buyers choose to rent. Buyer interest also may dry up 
because of an economic slowdown.
An increase in the number of newly listed houses for sale and a high inventory 
of unsold homes are two signs that soft home prices likely lie ahead. With many 
options to choose among, prospective buyers can be picky about what they buy. 
This competition among many sellers for a few buyers is what begins to exert 
downward pressure on prices and can create a buyer’s market — a market in 
which prices are soft because of supply far exceeding demand.
A decreasing number of new listings and a low inventory of properties listed 
for sale bode well for home price increases. Few listings, multiple purchase 
offers, and rapid sales indicate that the demand from buyers exceeds the 
supply of property listed for sale — a seller’s market.
When the local economy is strong and housing isn’t expensive compared 
with rental rates, more renters elect to (and can afford to) purchase, thus 
increasing sales activity. If you’re a seller, you’re in heaven. As a buyer, you 
may be frustrated by dealing with constant price increases, losing homes in 
multiple-offer situations, or being beaten by other bidders in the race to a 
new listing.

73
 Chapter 4: Why Home Prices Rise and Fall
The rental market
Rental rates provide a useful indicator of the demand for housing. When the 
demand for rental housing exceeds the supply of rental housing and the local 
economy continues to grow, rents generally increase. This situation is a plus 
for future home price increases. As the cost of renting increases, purchasing 
a home looks all the more attractive to renters who are on the fence and are 
considering buying.
The trend in rents and the absolute level of rents don’t tell you all that you 
need to know. Suppose that a two-bedroom, one-bath, 1,100-square-foot 
home in a decent neighborhood in your town is renting for $1,200 per month. 
So what? What you also need to know is how this rental cost compares with 
the cost of purchasing and owning the same home.
 
Compare the cost of renting a given home with the cost of owning it. Such a 
comparison is effectively what current renters do when they weigh the costs 
of buying a home and leaving their landlord behind. Comparing the cost of 
owning a home with the cost of renting that same property serves as a reality 
check on home prices.
Interest rates and home prices
Because the biggest expense of owning a home 
generally is the monthly mortgage payment, the 
level of interest rates on mortgages have a big 
impact on home prices. As interest rates drop, 
so can payments on mortgages of a given size.
Consider a $100,000, 30-year, fixed-rate mort-
gage. If the interest rate is 6 percent, the 
monthly mortgage payment is $600. At an inter-
est rate of 10 percent, the mortgage payment 
balloons to $878.
It’s certainly true that low interest rates enable 
more renters to become homeowners. So you 
may think that declining interest rates would 
cause home prices to rise and, conversely, that 
increasing interest rates would lead to falling 
home prices. That this isn’t the way the world 
operates is proved by the fact that even though 
interest rates trended higher in the late 1990s, 
home prices were rising briskly in many com-
munities nationwide. Also, many parts of the 
U.S. in the late 2000s experienced falling home 
prices at the same time that interest rates were 
declining.
Clearly, other factors do influence home prices, 
especially the health of the local and national 
economies and consumer confidence. And 
although low interest rates make housing more 
affordable, low rates also make building more 
housing at lower costs possible. A larger supply 
of housing tends to dampen housing price 
increases.
What’s the lesson of this story? Don’t try to 
time your housing purchase based upon what’s 
happening, or what you expect to happen, with 
interest rates. The future change in your home’s 
value could very well surprise you.

74
Part I: Home Economics 
In order to make a fair comparison between renting and owning, you must 
compare the monthly cost of renting with the monthly cost of owning. If you 
compare the cost of renting a home for $1,200 per month with the sticker 
price of buying that same home for $250,000, you’re comparing apples with 
oranges. That $250,000 is the total purchase price of the home, not your 
monthly cost of owning it.
And when you calculate home-ownership costs, you must also factor in tax 
benefits. Your biggest home-ownership expenses — mortgage interest and 
property taxes — are generally tax-deductible (see Chapter 3).
 
Comparing the cost of owning a home with the cost of renting that same home 
is a simple yet powerful indicator of whether real estate in an area is over-
priced, underpriced, or priced just right. Buying is generally safer (and a good 
value) when it costs about the same as renting. However, in some particularly 
desirable and in-demand communities, homeownership almost always costs 
more than renting. What’s a reasonable premium? You won’t find a simple 
answer, but if the monthly cost of owning is pushing past 20 to 30 percent 
more than the monthly cost of renting, be cautious.
Real estate get-rich-quick schemes
Scores of books have been written and high-
priced seminars conducted claiming to have 
the real estate investing approach that can 
“beat the system.” Often, these promoters 
claim that you can become a multimillionaire 
through buying distressed property — property 
with financial, legal, or physical problems. One 
suggested strategy is to buy property on which 
a seller has defaulted or is about to default. 
Or how about buying a property in someone’s 
estate through probate court? Maybe you’d 
like to try your hand at investing in a property 
that has been condemned or has toxic-waste 
contamination!
Getting a “good buy” and purchasing a prob-
lem property at a discount larger than the cost 
of fixing the property are possible. But these 
opportunities are hard to find, and sellers of 
such properties are often unwilling to sell at a 
large enough discount to leave you sufficient 
profit. If you don’t know how to thoroughly and 
correctly evaluate the problems of a property, 
you could end up overpaying. You may even get 
stuck with a property that has incurable defects 
such as poor location, excessive noise, or no 
backyard. (We tell you how to separate dumps 
from diamonds-in-the-rough fixer-upper prop-
erties in Chapter 8.)
In some cases, the strategies that these real 
estate gurus advocate involve taking advantage 
of people’s lack of knowledge. For example, 
some people don’t know that they can protect 
the equity in their home through filing personal 
bankruptcy. When you can find sellers in such 
dire financial straits, you may be able to get bar-
gain buys on their homes.
Other methods of getting a good buy take a 
great deal of time and digging. Some involve 
cold-calling property owners to see whether 
they’re interested in selling. If you phone thou-
sands of people, you may eventually find a good 
candidate this way. However, when you factor 
in the value of your time, these deals rarely 
appear attractive.

75
 Chapter 4: Why Home Prices Rise and Fall
After you purchase a home, you’ll probably own it for decades to come. So 
don’t worry about timing your first home purchase. Trying to time your pur-
chase has more importance if you may be moving in fewer than five years. In 
that case, be careful to avoid buying in an overheated market. The level of real 
estate prices compared with rents, the state of the job market, and the number 
of home listings for sale are useful indicators of the housing market’s health.
How to Get a Good Buy in Any Market
What if you have to (or want to) buy in a seller’s market? Or you’re simply 
frightened that you’re going to overpay in any market because you’re a home-
buying novice? No one likes to be taken. And most folks like to feel or believe 
that they’re getting a bargain.
Many times, when you purchase products and services through businesses 
(especially retailers), the sellers like to tell you how much of a discount or 
markdown they’re offering you:
60 PERCENT OFF!
GOING-OUT-OF-BUSINESS SALE — EVERYTHING MUST GO!
SAVE UP TO $3 PER POUND!
SPRING CLEARANCE SALE!
Some home sellers and (more often) their agents like to use the same type of 
advertising. The following examples are from actual home-for-sale ads:
HUGE PRICE REDUCTION!
PRICE SLASHED $20,000!
REDUCED! BACK ON THE MARKET — OWNER MUST SELL!
 
Whenever you see these types of ads, rather than thinking, “Gee, that sounds 
like a good deal,” you should be thinking, “That home must have been over-
priced before, and/or it probably has a significant defect.”
Now, we’re not trying to tell you that you can’t get a deal (in other words, 
buy a home for less than it’s worth). But doing so isn’t easy, and finding just 
the right situation takes a great deal of work. For most people, not overpay-
ing — in other words, paying fair market value (which isn’t necessarily the 
asking price) — is a good objective. See Chapter 10 to find out more about 
determining home values.
Read our suggestions for finding a good buy even if you’re willing to pay fair 
market value. These ideas can help prevent you from overpaying.

76
Part I: Home Economics 
Seek hidden opportunities to add value
The easiest problems to correct are cosmetic. Some sellers and their agents 
are lazy and don’t even bother to clean a property. Painting, tearing up dingy 
carpeting, refinishing hardwood floors, replacing outdated cabinets and 
appliances, and installing new landscaping need not be difficult projects. And 
such changes can make some properties look much better.
A somewhat more complicated way to add value is to identify properties not 
being fully used or developed according to their zoning. Sometimes you can 
make more productive use of a property. For example, you may be able to con-
vert a duplex to two separate condominiums. Some single-family residences 
may incorporate a rental unit if local zoning allows. Perhaps you can add 
another level to create a panoramic view. A good real estate agent, a contrac-
tor, and the local planning office in the town or city in which you’re looking at 
property should be able to help you identify properties for which the use can 
be changed.
 
Identifying, evaluating, buying, and fixing up a property take valuable time and 
energy. If you have a talent for finding hidden opportunities and are willing to 
invest the time required to coordinate the fix-up work, by all means try your 
hand and money at it! Just be sure to be realistic when you assess whether 
the major defects can be corrected, how much money you may need to spend 
to improve the property, and how much value your improvements can really 
add. Also, be sure to hire a competent property inspector (see Chapter 13).
Buy when others are scared to buy
When the economy hits the skids and unemployment rises, the mood is 
somber and gloomy, and the number of home purchases usually drops. 
Prices tend to fall as well. This situation, such as the conditions brought on 
by the financial and credit crisis of the late 2000s, can signal a great time to 
step up and buy. Buy when homes are “on sale” and when you don’t have 
to compete with many other buyers. Buy when you can have your pick of a 
larger inventory of homes for sale.
 
Few people feel comfortable buying an investment that has gone down in 
value, especially when things look bleak. (For some perverse psychological 
reason, though, many of us love shopping for bargains in retail stores.) Here 
are several signs that a soft real estate market is beginning to firm up:
 
✓ The monthly cost of owning a home approximates the monthly cost of 
renting a similar property. One of the beauties of a major real estate 
price decline is that it can bring home-ownership costs back in line with 
rent costs.

77
 Chapter 4: Why Home Prices Rise and Fall
 
✓ The inventory of homes listed for sale starts to fall from its peak as 
home sales pick up.
 
✓ The rental market tightens (as evidenced by increasing rents and a low 
vacancy rate). Another good sign is that little new housing is being built.
 
✓ The job market improves. Remember that jobs fuel the demand for hous-
ing. Home prices tend to rebound when employment increases. Watch 
for a decrease in the unemployment rate in your region.
 
Despite lower home prices, an improving economy, and tightening rental and 
homes-for-sale inventories, prospective home buyers generally show far less 
interest in buying a home when things still look bleak. It takes courage to buy 
during those times when newspaper headlines and TV news reports trumpet 
the latest round of layoffs. Keep a level head, and take advantage of buying 
opportunities when they occur. Years down the road, you may be glad that 
you did.
Find a motivated seller
When you take your time and peruse enough properties, you eventually cross 
paths with a property owner who really needs or wants to sell. The owner may 
need to relocate to another part of the country for a job, or perhaps the owner 
is trading up to a larger home and needs the cash from the sale of the current 
one to buy the new home. Sometimes a property owner simply can’t afford to 
own and maintain a home any longer because of personal financial troubles.
 
Whatever the reason, buying a home at or below its fair market value is far 
easier if the seller is what we call motivated. How do you find a motivated 
seller? Simple: You ask questions! The number of prospective buyers who are 
too shy to (or don’t think to) ask why a seller is selling is amazing. Many sell-
ers will be honest, and more than a few real estate agents (especially those 
who love to talk) have loose lips and share plenty of details. But you gotta ask!
Buy during slow periods
Most local real estate markets go through predictable busy and slow peri-
ods like clockwork. Just as it makes good sense to buy when the overall real 
estate market in an area is depressed, it can be beneficial to buy during those 
typical slow periods.
For example, far fewer prospective buyers tend to be looking for homes 
during the holiday season in the dead of winter. In most markets, the period 
from Thanksgiving through January or February tends to be quite slow. The 
colder the region in which you live, the later into the new year this slow 
period lasts. In the blustery and snowy northernmost regions of the U.S., the 

78
Part I: Home Economics 
real estate market doesn’t really start to pick up until April. In locales that are 
sunny and warm year ’round, such as Florida and Southern California, home 
sales start to pick up as early as February.
Another typically slow period is during the summer months of July and 
August. Many people take vacations then, and those families who want to buy 
in time for the next school year have likely already bought. The oppressive 
heat in the southern regions also keeps people indoors and near their air 
conditioners and iced tea.
The advantage of looking during the slow periods is that you have far less 
competition from other potential buyers. If you can find a motivated seller, 
you may really be able to negotiate a great deal without the intrusion of other 
potential buyers.
We’re not saying, however, to look only during slow periods of the year, or 
that you can definitely get a good buy during these times. You must be realis-
tic. In most markets most of the time, fewer properties are for sale during the 
slow periods. Smart sellers get their properties sold during the more active 
periods in the spring and fall. Also, be aware that a good portion of those 
properties on the market during slow periods may be the unwanted leftovers.
Become a great negotiator
Getting a good buy can be as simple as being a good negotiator. Good nego-
tiation skills may enable you to buy a property at less than fair market value, 
especially if you find a seller who needs to sell soon.
Your negotiating position is also better if you’re in a situation where you 
don’t have to buy. The more patient you are and the more willing you are to 
walk away if you don’t get a good deal, the better able you’ll be to negotiate 
a good buy. Having a backup property in mind (or remembering that many 
other properties are out there for you to buy) also helps. See Chapter 12 to 
discover how to be a world-class negotiator.
Buy in a good neighborhood
If you buy a home in a desirable area, you should have a better chance at 
making a good investment. We explain how to find out whether a neighbor-
hood is good in Chapter 8.
When you buy good real estate and hold it for the long term, you should 
earn a decent return on your investment. Over the long haul, having bought 
a property at a small discount becomes an insignificant issue. You’ll make 
money from owning a home (and perhaps other real estate investments) as 
the overall real estate market appreciates.

Most lenders also use a number of other facts to make credit decisions. They 
usually look at the amount of debt you can reasonably handle given your 
income, your employment history, and your credit history. Based on their per-
ception of this information, as well as their specific underwriting policies, lend-
ers may extend credit to you even if your score is low, or decline your request 
for credit even if your score is high. But your chances for getting approved at 
the best possible loan terms improve when you have a good score.
 
Understanding your credit score can help you manage your credit health. By 
knowing how lenders evaluate your credit risk, you can take action to lower 
your credit risk — and thus raise your score — over time. A better score may 
mean better loan options for you.

The Record You Can’t Ignore: 
Your Credit Report
You’ve probably heard about credit reports and realize that they can make or 
break your application for a loan. However, these reports are mysterious to 
most of us because we don’t know what goes into a credit report, nor do we 
understand what we can do to improve our credit score. Wonder no more . . . .
What your credit history comprises
Credit reports tell a lender how well you manage your finances. Your report 
details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit-reporting 
agency by lenders who’ve extended credit to you. Your credit report lists
 
✓ What types of credit you use
 
✓ The length of time your accounts have been open
 
✓ Whether you’ve paid your bills on time
It tells lenders how much credit you’ve used and whether you’re seeking new 
sources of credit. It gives lenders a broader view of your credit history than 
one bank’s own customer records (unless all your previous credit has been 
drawn from that one bank).
What goes into your credit report
 
Although each credit-reporting agency formats and reports information 
differently, all credit reports contain basically the same kinds of information:
 
✓ Identifying information: Your name, address, Social Security number, 
date of birth, and employment information are used to identify you. 
These factors aren’t used to calculate your score, however. Updates to 
this information come from information you supply to lenders.

83
 Chapter 5: Understanding and Improving Your Credit Score
 
✓ Trade lines: These are your credit accounts. Lenders report each 
account you’ve established with them. They report the type of account 
(credit card, auto loan, mortgage, and so on), the date you opened the 
account, your credit limit or loan amount, the account balance, your 
payment history, and when you closed the account.
 
✓ Inquiries: When you apply for a loan, you authorize your lender to ask 
for a copy of your credit report. This is how inquiries appear on your 
credit report. The inquiries section contains a list of everyone who 
accessed your credit report within the past two years. The report you 
see lists both voluntary inquiries, spurred by your own requests for 
credit, and involuntary inquiries, such as when lenders order your report 
so as to make you a preapproved credit offer in the mail.
 
✓ Public record and collection items: Credit-reporting agencies also 
collect public record information from state and county courts and 
information on overdue debt from collection agencies. Public record 
information includes bankruptcies, foreclosures, suits, wage attachments, 
liens, and judgments.
Along with the credit report, lenders can buy a credit score based on the 
information in the report.
Why you should check your credit report
If your credit report contains errors, it may be incomplete or contain infor-
mation about someone else. This typically happens because
 
✓ You applied for credit under slightly different names (Robert Jones, Bob 
Jones, and so on).
 
✓ Someone made a clerical error in reading or entering name or address 
information from a handwritten application.
 
✓ Someone gave an inaccurate Social Security number, or the lender 
misread the number.
 
✓ Loan or credit card payments were inadvertently applied to the wrong 
account.
 
Derogatory information on your credit report may force you into a mortgage 
with a higher interest rate and fees or cause your mortgage application to be 
denied. If you find an error, the credit-reporting agency must investigate and 
respond to you within 30 days. If you’re in the process of applying for a loan, 
immediately notify your lender of any incorrect information in your report. 
See the last section in this chapter for info on how to contact the credit-
reporting agencies to obtain your credit report.

The Most Popular Kid on 
the Block: FICO Scores
The credit score most lenders use today was developed by Fair Isaac 
Corporation and is called a FICO score. FICO scores range from a low of 300 to 
a maximum of 850. The higher your FICO score, the lower the potential risk 
you pose for lenders. FICO scores are provided to lenders by the three major 
credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
Although FICO scores are the most commonly used credit risk scores in the 
U.S., lenders may use other scores to evaluate your credit risk. These include
 
✓ Application risk scores: Many lenders use scoring systems that include 
the FICO score but also consider information from your loan application.
 
✓ Customer risk scores: A lender may use these scores to make credit 
decisions about its current customers. Also called behavior scores, these 
scores generally consider the FICO score along with information on how 
you’ve paid that lender in the past.
 
✓ Other credit bureau scores: These scores may evaluate your credit 
report differently than FICO scores, and in some cases a higher score 
may mean more risk, not less risk, as with FICO scores.
 
If you’ve been turned down for credit, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act (ECOA) gives you the right to find out why within 30 days. You’re also enti-
tled to a free copy of your credit agency report within 60 days, which you can 
request from the credit-reporting agencies. If your credit score was a primary 
part of the lender’s decision, the lender will use the score reasons to explain 
why you didn’t qualify for the credit.
How scores work — the short version
Each credit score is calculated by a mathematical equation that evaluates 
many types of information from your credit report at that agency. By compar-
ing this information with the patterns in hundreds of thousands of past credit 
reports, the score identifies your level of estimated future credit risk.
In order for a FICO score to be calculated from your credit report, the report 
must contain at least one account that has been open for six months or 
longer. In addition, the report must contain at least one account that has 
been updated in the past six months. This ensures that enough recent infor-
mation is in your report to calculate a score.
Your score can change whenever your credit report changes. But your score 
probably won’t change a lot from one month to the next.

85
 Chapter 5: Understanding and Improving Your Credit Score
 
Although a bankruptcy or late payment can quickly lower your score, 
improving your score takes time. That’s why it’s a good idea to check your 
score (especially if you have reason to be concerned about your credit history) 
at least six months before applying for a mortgage. That gives you time to take 
corrective action if needed. If you’re actively working to improve your score, 
you should check it quarterly or even monthly to review changes.
But no score, no matter how high or low, says whether you’ll be a “good” or 
“bad” customer. Although many lenders use FICO scores to help them make 
lending decisions, each lender also has its own strategy, including the level 
of risk it finds acceptable for a given type of loan. There is no single minimum 
score used by all lenders.
How a FICO score assesses your 
credit history — the long version
The FICO score evaluates several categories of information: your payment 
history, the amount you owe, the length of your credit history, new credit 
you’ve acquired, types of credit you have in use, and the number of credit 
queries. Some, as you’d expect, are more important than others. It’s impor-
tant to note that
 
✓ A score considers all these categories of information, not just one or 
two. No one piece of information or factor alone determines your score.
 
✓ The importance of any factor depends on the overall information 
in your credit report. A given factor may be more important for some 
people than for others who have a different credit history. In addition, 
as the information in your credit report changes, so does the impor-
tance of any factor in determining your score. That’s why it’s impossible 
to say exactly how important any single factor is in determining your 
score — even the levels of importance shown in the following sections 
are for the general population and differ for different credit profiles.
 
✓ Your FICO score looks only at information in your credit report. 
Lenders often also look at other things when making a credit decision, 
including your income, how long you’ve worked at your present job, and 
the kind of credit you’re requesting.
 
✓ Your score considers both positive and negative information in your 
credit report. Late payments lower your score, but establishing or rees-
tablishing a good track record of making payments on time raises your 
score.
 
✓ Raising your score is a bit like getting in shape. It takes time, and there 
is no quick fix. In fact, quick-fix efforts can backfire. The best advice is to 
manage credit responsibly over time.

86
Par t II: Financing 101 
The percentages in Figure 5-1 are based on the importance of the five catego-
ries for the general population. For particular groups — for example, people 
who haven’t been using credit long — the importance of these categories 
may be different.
The following sections offer a complete look at the information that goes into 
a FICO score and how you can improve your score in each area. For a visual 
graphic of what contributes to your credit score, see Figure 5-1.

Your payment history
The first thing any lender wants to know is whether you’ve paid past credit 
accounts on time. Your track record for repaying creditors affects roughly 35 
percent of your score.
FICO scores can differ among bureaus
Fair Isaac makes the FICO scores as consistent 
as possible among the three credit-reporting 
agencies. If your information is identical at all 
three credit-reporting agencies, your scores 
from all three should be within a few points of 
one another.
But sometimes your FICO score may be quite 
different at each of the three credit-reporting 
agencies. The way lenders and other busi-
nesses report information to these agencies 
sometimes results in different information being 
in your credit report at the different agencies. 
The agencies may also report the same infor-
mation in different ways. Even small differences 
in the information at the three credit-reporting 
agencies can affect your scores.
Because lenders may review your score and 
credit report from any one of the three credit-
reporting agencies, go ahead and check your 
credit report at all three to make sure each is 
correct (see the last section in this chapter to 
find out how to do that).

87
 Chapter 5: Understanding and Improving Your Credit Score
Late payments aren’t an automatic score-killer. An overall good credit picture 
can outweigh one or two instances of, say, late credit card payments. On the 
other hand, having no late payments in your credit report doesn’t mean you 
automatically get a great score. Some 60 to 65 percent of credit reports show 
no late payments at all. Your payment history is just one piece of information 
used in calculating your score.
In the area of payments, your score takes into account
 
✓ Payment information on many types of accounts: These include credit 
cards such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover; credit 
cards from stores where you do business; installment loans (loans such 
as a mortgage on which you make regular payments); and finance-
company accounts.
 
✓ Public record and collection items: These items include reports of 
events such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, suits, wage attachments, 
liens, and judgments. They’re considered quite serious, although older 
items and items with small amounts count less than more recent items 
or those with larger amounts. Bankruptcies stay on your credit report 
for seven to ten years, depending on the type.
 
 A foreclosure, a short sale (where the lender agrees to accept less than 
the total amount due on a mortgage), or a deed in lieu of foreclosure (in 
which a borrower deeds his property to the lender, who then sells it and 
uses the proceeds of the sale to repay the mortgage) lowers your credit 
score. If you’ve had the misfortune to go through one of these negative 
credit events, be advised that they’re considered extremely serious 
delinquencies. Don’t expect to get a new home loan with favorable terms 
for five to seven years after your foreclosure, short sale, or deed in lieu 
of foreclosure.
 
✓ Details on late or missed payments (delinquencies) and public record 
and collection items: The FICO score considers how late such payments 
were, how much was owed, how recently they occurred, and how many 
there are. As a rule, a 60-day late payment isn’t as damaging as a 90-day 
late payment. A 60-day late payment made just a month ago, however, 
penalizes you more than a 90-day late payment from five years ago.
 
✓ How many accounts show no late payments: A good track record on 
most of your credit accounts increases your credit score.
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
✓ Pay your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections can have a 
major negative impact on your score.
 
✓ If you’ve missed payments, get current, and stay current. The longer 
you pay your bills on time, the better your score. 

88
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
✓ If you’re having trouble making ends meet, get help. This doesn’t 
improve your score immediately, but if you can begin to manage your 
credit and pay on time, your score gets better over time. See our advice 
in Chapter 2 for credit-problem-solving strategies.
 
Paying off or closing an account doesn’t remove it from your credit report. 
The score still considers this information because it reflects your past credit 
pattern.
The amount you owe
About 30 percent of your score is based on your current debt. Having credit 
accounts and owing money on them doesn’t mean you’re a high-risk bor-
rower who’ll receive a low score. However, owing a great deal of money on 
many accounts can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely 
to make some payments late or not at all. Part of the science of scoring is 
determining how much is too much for a given credit profile.
In the area of debts, your score takes into account
 
✓ The amount owed on all accounts. Note that even if you pay off your 
credit cards in full every month, your credit report may show a balance 
on those cards. The total balance on your last statement is generally the 
amount that will show in your credit report.
 
✓ The amount owed on all accounts and on different types of accounts. 
In addition to the overall amount you owe, the score considers the 
amount you owe on specific types of accounts, such as credit cards and 
installment loans.
 
✓ Whether you show a balance on certain types of accounts. In some 
cases, having a small balance without missing a payment shows that 
you’ve managed credit responsibly. On the other hand, closing unused 
credit accounts that show zero balances and that are in good standing 
doesn’t raise your score.
 
✓ How many accounts have balances. A large number can indicate higher 
risk of overextension.
 
✓ How much of the total credit line is being used on credit cards and 
other revolving credit (carrying a debt balance month to month) 
accounts. Someone closer to “maxing out” on many credit cards may 
have trouble making payments in the future.
 
✓ How much of installment loan accounts is still owed compared with 
the original loan amounts. For example, if you borrowed $10,000 to buy 
a car and you’ve paid back $2,000, you owe (with interest) more than 
80 percent of the original loan. Paying down installment loans is a good 
sign that you’re able and willing to manage and repay debt.

89
 Chapter 5: Understanding and Improving Your Credit Score
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
✓ Keep balances low on credit cards and other revolving credit. High 
outstanding debt can adversely affect a score.
 
✓ Pay off debt. The most effective way to improve your score in this area 
is by paying down your revolving credit.
 
✓ Don’t close unused credit cards as a short-term strategy to raise your 
score. Generally, this doesn’t work. In fact, it may lower your score. Late 
payments associated with old accounts won’t disappear from your 
credit report if you close the account. Long-established accounts show 
that you have a longer history of managing credit, which is a good thing. 
And having available credit that you don’t use doesn’t lower your score. 
You may have reasons other than your score to shut down old credit 
card accounts that you don’t use, but don’t do it in hopes of getting a 
better score.
 
✓ Don’t open new credit card accounts that you don’t need just to 
increase your available credit. This approach could backfire and 
actually lower your score.
The length of your credit history
How established is your credit history? About 15 percent of your score is 
based on this area. In general, a longer credit history will increase your 
score. However, even people who haven’t been using credit long may get 
high scores, depending on how the rest of the credit report looks.
In this area, your score takes into account
 
✓ How long your credit accounts have been established, in general. The 
score considers both the age of your oldest account and an average age 
of all your accounts.
 
✓ How long specific credit accounts have been established. Your score 
reflects how long you’ve been handling different types of credit. Your 
score increases over time, for example, if you show that you can manage 
both a credit card and an installment loan such as a mortgage or car 
loan. This category doesn’t have a specified minimum or maximum 
amount of time, but the longer you responsibly manage your credit, the 
higher your credit score.
 
✓ How long it has been since you used certain revolving credit accounts. 
The score assesses revolving credit accounts such as credit cards dif-
ferently if they haven’t been used for a long time. An inactive credit card 
account, no matter how old, is given less weight in your credit score 
than active accounts.

90
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
To improve your FICO score in this category, don’t open a lot of new accounts 
too rapidly if you’ve been managing credit for only a short time. New accounts 
lower your average account age, which has a larger effect on your score if you 
don’t have a lot of other credit information. Also, rapid account buildup can 
look risky if you’re a new credit user.
New credit you’ve acquired
Taking on a lot of new debt affects your score, too. About 10 percent of your 
score is based on new credit and credit applications.
 
People tend to have more credit today and to shop for credit — via the 
Internet and other channels — more frequently than ever. Credit scores reflect 
this fact. However, research shows that opening several credit accounts in a 
short period does represent more risk — especially for people who don’t have 
a long-established credit history.
Applying for several new credit cards or accounts also represents more risk. 
However, FICO scores do a good job of distinguishing between a search for 
many new credit accounts and rate shopping for one new account.
In the area of new credit, your score takes into account
 
✓ How many new accounts you have. The score looks at how many new 
accounts you have by type of account (for example, how many newly 
opened credit card accounts you have). It also may look at how many of 
your accounts are new accounts.
 
✓ How long it has been since you opened a new account. Again, the 
score looks at this by type of account.
 
✓ How many recent requests for credit you’ve made. This is indicated 
by inquiries to the credit-reporting agencies. Inquiries remain on your 
credit report for two years, although FICO scores consider only inquiries 
from the last 12 months. The scores have been carefully designed to 
count only those inquiries that truly impact credit risk.
 
✓ The length of time since lenders made credit report inquiries. The 
older the lender inquiries, the better. Inquiries more than a year old are 
ignored. In this case, being ignored is good.
 
✓ Whether you have a good recent credit history following past payment 
problems. Reestablishing credit and making payments on time after a 
period of late payment behavior both help raise a score over time.

91
 Chapter 5: Understanding and Improving Your Credit Score
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
✓ Do your rate shopping for a specific loan within a focused period of 
time. FICO scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and 
a search for many new credit lines, in part by the length of time over 
which inquiries occur. For more on this topic, see the section “The 
number of credit inquiries,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Reestablish your credit history if you’ve had problems. Opening new 
accounts responsibly and paying them off on time will raise your score 
in the long term.
 
It’s okay to request and check your own credit report and FICO score. This 
won’t affect your score as long as you order your credit report directly from 
the credit-reporting agency or through an organization authorized to provide 
credit reports to consumers. See the last section in this chapter, “Getting 
Hold of Your Report and Score,” for details on where you can obtain your 
credit score.
Types of credit you have in use
The credit mix usually isn’t a key factor in determining your score, but it’s 
given more weight if your credit report doesn’t have a lot of other informa-
tion on which to base a score. About 10 percent of your score is based on 
this category.
In this area, your score takes into account
 
✓ What kinds of credit accounts you have. Your score considers your 
mix of credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, finance company 
accounts, and mortgage loans. Don’t feel obligated to have one of each.
 
✓ How many of each type of credit account you have. The score looks 
at the total number of accounts you have. How many is too many varies 
depending on the credit type. You don’t need to have one of each type. 
Don’t open credit accounts you don’t intend to use just to hype up your 
total.
 
How to improve your FICO score:
 
✓ Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed. Don’t open 
accounts just to have a better credit mix — it probably won’t raise your 
score.
 
✓ Have credit cards — but manage them responsibly. In general, having 
credit cards and installment loans (and making timely payments) raises 
your score.
 
✓ Note that closing an account doesn’t make it go away. A closed 
account still shows up on your credit report and may be included in the 
score.

92
Par t II: Financing 101 
The number of credit inquiries
A search for new credit can mean greater credit risk. This is why the FICO 
score counts inquiries — those requests a lender makes for your credit 
report or score when you apply for credit.
FICO scores consider inquiries very carefully because not all inquiries are 
related to credit risk. You should note three things about credit inquiries:
 
✓ Inquiries don’t affect scores very much. For most people, one addi-
tional credit inquiry takes less than 5 points off their FICO score. 
However, inquiries can have a greater impact if you have few accounts 
or a short credit history. Large numbers of inquiries also mean greater 
risk: People with six inquiries or more on their credit reports are eight 
times more likely to declare bankruptcy than people with no inquiries 
on their reports.
 
✓ Many kinds of inquiries aren’t counted at all. The score doesn’t count 
it when you order your credit report or credit score from a credit-
reporting agency. Also, the score doesn’t count requests lenders make 
for your credit report or score in order to make you a preapproved 
credit offer or to review your account with them, even though you may 
see these inquiries on your credit report. Requests that are marked as 
coming from employers aren’t counted either.
 
✓ The score looks for rate shopping. Looking for a mortgage or an auto 
loan may cause multiple lenders to request your credit report, even 
though you’re looking for only one loan. To compensate for this, the 
score counts multiple inquiries in any 14-day period as just one inquiry. 
In addition, the score ignores all inquiries made in the 30 days prior to 
scoring. So if you find a loan within 30 days, the inquiries won’t affect 
your score while you’re rate shopping.
What FICO scores ignore
FICO scores consider a wide range of information on your credit report. 
However, they don’t consider
 
✓ Your race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status
 
 U.S. law prohibits credit scoring from considering these facts, as well as 
any receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any consumer right 
under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
 
✓ Your age
 
✓ Your salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed, or employment 
history

93
 Chapter 5: Understanding and Improving Your Credit Score
Lenders may consider this information, however:
 
✓ Where you live
 
✓ Any interest rate being charged on a particular credit card or other 
account
 
✓ Any items reported as child/family support obligations or rental 
agreements
 
✓ Certain types of inquiries (requests for your credit report or score)
 
 The score does not count any requests you make, any requests from 
employers, or any requests lenders make without your knowledge.
 
✓ Any information not found in your credit report
 
✓ Any information not proved to be predictive of future credit 
performance
Why your score is what it is
When a lender receives your FICO score, up to four score reasons are also 
delivered. These are the top reasons why your score wasn’t higher. If the 
lender rejects your request for credit and your FICO score was part of the 
reason, these score reasons can help the lender tell you why.
 
These score reasons can be more useful to you than the score itself. They help 
you determine whether your credit report may contain errors and how you 
may improve your credit score. However, if you already have a high FICO score 
(for example, in the mid-700s or higher), some of the reasons may not be help-
ful, because they may be marginal factors related to less important categories, 
such as your length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit in use.
Getting Hold of Your Report and Score
 
Getting and retaining a copy of your personal credit report is a good idea. 
Because your personal credit report contains a history of your use (and 
abuse!) of credit, it’s important that you’re aware of what it contains and 
whether the information is accurate.
If you’re applying for a mortgage, you can ask at that time for a copy of your 
credit report — after all, you’re paying for it! You should also know that lend-
ers are required to give you a copy of your credit report without charge if 
they turn you down for a loan.

94

Congress gave each of us the right to get one free credit report annually from 
each of the three big credit bureaus — Experian (888-397-3742; www.experian.
com), Equifax (800-685-1111; www.equifax.com), and TransUnion (800-888-
4213; www.transunion.com). Credit bureaus are also generally required to 
provide you with a free copy of your report if you were denied credit, employ-
ment, housing, or insurance over the most recent 60 days because of infor-
mation in their credit files. You may also purchase a copy of your credit 
report from any of the three big bureaus (generally for less than $10). At the 
least, 
we encourage you to get your free reports annually. Only the report is free, 
however. You still have to pay to find out what your credit score is.
 
It’s easy to check your FICO score and to find out specific things that you can 
do to raise it. The Web sites for many banks, financial services companies, and 
credit-reporting agencies offer FICO scores for a fee. Information you receive 
includes
 
✓ Your current FICO score
 
✓ Your credit report on which your FICO score is based
 
✓ An explanation of your score, the positive and negative factors behind it, 
and how lenders view your credit risk
 
✓ A FICO score simulator you can use to see how specific actions, such as 
paying off all your card balances, would affect your score
 
✓ Specific tips on what you can do to improve your FICO score over time
In addition, you can see current information on the average interest rates for 
home loans for different FICO score ranges.

M
ost of us need to take out a mortgage to buy a home for the simple 
reason that doing so is the only way we can afford a home that meets 
our needs. This chapter helps all nonwealthy folks comprehend mortgages 
and then choose one. (If you are wealthy and have a great deal of money to 
put into a property, this chapter can also help you decide how much of your 
loot to put into your home purchase.)
Start with the basics. What’s a mortgage? A mortgage is nothing more than a 
loan that you obtain to close the gap between the cash you have for a down 
payment and the purchase price of the home that you’re buying. Homes in 
your area may cost $70,000, $170,000, $470,000, or $770,000. No matter — 
most people don’t have that kind of spare cash in their piggy banks.
Mortgages require that you make monthly payments to repay your debt. The 
mortgage payments comprise interest, which is what the lender charges for 
use of the money you borrow, and principal, which is repayment of the origi-
nal amount you borrow.
As noted in Chapter 3, the lender may also insist that you establish an 
impound account if your cash down payment is less than 20 percent of the 
purchase price. Impound accounts require that you pay your monthly prop-
erty taxes and insurance to the lender with your mortgage payment. Your 
lender then makes these payments on your behalf when they’re due.
Figuring out how to select a mortgage to meet your needs ensures that you’ll 
be a happy homeowner for years to come. You also need to understand how 
to get a good deal when shopping around for a mortgage because your mort-
gage is typically the biggest monthly expense of homeownership (and per-
haps of your entire household budget). Paying more in total interest charges 

96
Par t II: Financing 101 
over the life of your mortgage than you originally pay for your humble abode 
itself isn’t unusual.
Suppose that you borrow $144,000 (and contribute $36,000 from your savings 
as the down payment) for the purchase of your $180,000 dream palace. If you 
borrow that $144,000 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7 percent, you end 
up paying a whopping $200,892 in interest charges alone over the life of your 
loan. That $200,892 is not only a great deal of interest; it’s also more than the 
home’s purchase price or the loan amount you originally borrowed!
So that you don’t spend any more than you need to on your mortgage, and so 
that you get the mortgage that best meets your needs, the time has come to 
get on with the task of understanding the mortgage options out there.
Fixed or Adjustable? That Is 
the Interest(ing) Question
You may remember the skit from Saturday Night Live where Dan Aykroyd and 
John Belushi worked in a restaurant that served only cheeseburgers, chips, 
and Pepsi. Customers who tried to order a hamburger, fries, and Coke were 
out of luck. No hamburgers, just cheeseburgers; no fries, just chips; and no 
Coke, just Pepsi. At that restaurant, your choices were already made. If only 
you were so lucky with mortgages.
Like some other financial and investment products, many different mortgage 
options are available for your choosing. The variations can be significant or 
trivial, expensive or less costly.
You will note throughout this chapter that two fundamentally different types 
of mortgages exist: fixed-rate mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages. The 
chief difference between these two main types of mortgages is how their 
interest rate is determined.
Distinguishing fixed-rate mortgages 
from adjustables
Before adjustable-rate mortgages came into being, only fixed-rate mortgages 
existed. Usually issued for 15- or 30-year periods, fixed-rate mortgages (as the 
name suggests) have interest rates that are fixed (unchanging) during the 
entire life of the loan.
With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate stays the same, and your monthly 
mortgage payment amount never changes. No surprises, no uncertainty, and 

97
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
no anxiety for you over interest-rate changes and changes in your monthly pay-
ment. If you like the predictability of your favorite TV show airing at the same 
time daily, you’ll probably like fixed-rate mortgages.
On the other hand, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs for short) have an inter-
est rate that varies (or adjusts). The interest rate on an ARM typically adjusts 
every 6 to 12 months, but it may change as frequently as every month.
As we discuss later in this chapter, the interest rate on an ARM is primarily 
determined by what’s happening overall to interest rates. When interest rates 
are generally on the rise, odds are that your ARM will experience increasing 
rates, thus increasing the size of your mortgage payment. Conversely, when 
interest rates fall, ARM interest rates and payments generally fall.
If you like change, you may think that adjustable-rate mortgages sound good. 
Change is what makes life interesting, you say. Please read on, because even 
if you believe that variety is the spice of life, you may not like the financial 
variety and spice of adjustables!
Subprime mortgages and the late
2000s housing slump
During the late 1990s and continuing into the 
early to mid 2000s, mortgage lending was 
extended to more and more people who previ-
ously wouldn’t have qualified for home loans. 
With little or no down payments and poor credit 
scores (that’s the subprime reference), in the 
past these borrowers would have had to save 
more and improve their credit scores before 
qualifying for a home loan. In other words, they 
would have had to delay a desired home pur-
chase and upgrade their financial situation.
Thanks to government backing and incentives, 
subprime mortgages mushroomed, and more 
renters were enabled to borrow money and 
purchase homes. As long as real estate prices 
continued rising, jobs were plentiful, and the 
economy was strong, things worked out fine.
Unfortunately, during the mid 2000s, home 
prices began flattening, and then in the late 
2000s prices started trending down, especially 
in those housing markets most heavily populated 
with subprime borrowers. On some of these 
loans, monthly mortgage payments jumped 
significantly higher after an initial period, and 
borrowers couldn’t handle them financially. The 
economy soured and layoffs and unemployment 
rose, which further pressured stretched hom-
eowners. And as housing prices dropped more 
than 20 percent in particular markets, some of 
these subprime borrowers who bought with 
little or even no money down simply chose to 
walk away from homes worth quite a bit less 
than the outstanding mortgage balance.
Real estate market downturns aren’t enjoyable 
for homeowners. No one likes to lose money, 
even on paper. And the late 2000s real estate 
market decline was a nasty decline for some 
parts of the country. But as with past declines, 
this too shall pass. Home prices shall rise again. 
And lenders have returned to more sensible 
lending criteria — expecting folks to make 
down payments and have decent credit or pay 
much, much more if they don’t.

Par t II: Financing 101 
Looking at hybrid loans
If only the world were so simple that only pure fixed-rate and pure adjustable-
rate loans were available. But one of the rewards of living in a capitalistic 
society is that you often have a wide array of choices. Enter hybrid loans (or 
what lenders sometimes call intermediate ARMs). Such loans start out like a 
fixed-rate loan — the initial rate may be fixed for three, five, seven, or even 
ten years (often called 3/1, 5/1, 7/1, or 10/1 ARMs) — and then the loan con-
verts to an ARM, usually adjusting every 12 months thereafter. Some hybrid 
loans adjust more frequently or, conversely, may only have one adjustment.
Starting out risky: Interest-only mortgages
As housing prices mushroomed in already-high-cost urban areas and sur-
rounding desired suburbs in the early 2000s, lenders responded with yet 
another twist and began pushing interest-only loans. Unlike a traditional 
mortgage, interest-only mortgages entice borrowers with artificially low pay-
ments in their early years. This is possible because the initial payments 
simply consist of interest (hence the name of the loans) with no repayment of 
principal.
At some predetermined point down the road (three, five, seven, or ten years), 
repayment of principal begins, and the monthly loan payment amount takes 
a significant jump of 20, 30, or 40 percent or more. And therein lies the major 
problem with these loans; some borrowers may be financially unprepared 
for the much higher payments. In the worst cases, these loans are actually 
balloon loans in disguise (see the nearby sidebar) carrying all the additional 
warts of balloon loans.
 
As you may have gathered, we’re not big fans of interest-only mortgages. We 
urge you to completely understand all the terms and conditions before agree-
ing to take one.
Making the fixed/adjustable decision
So how do you choose whether to take a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate loan? 
Is it as simple as a personality test?
 
In this section, we talk you through the pros and cons of your mortgage 
options, but as we do, please keep one very important fact in mind: In the final 
analysis, the mortgage that’s best for you hinges on your personal and financial 
situation. You are the one who’s best positioned to make the call as to whether 
a fixed or an adjustable loan better matches your situation and desires.

99
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
Fixed-rate mortgages
It stands to reason that because the interest rate doesn’t vary with a fixed-
rate mortgage, the advantage of this type of mortgage is that you always 
know what your monthly payment is going to be. Thus, budgeting and plan-
ning are easier.
You’ll pay a premium, in the form of a higher interest rate (generally 3/8 to 3/4 
percent), to get a lender to commit to lending you money over many years 
at a fixed rate. The longer the mortgage lender agrees to accept a fixed inter-
est rate, the more risk that lender is taking. A lender who agrees to loan you 
money, for example, over 30 years at 8 percent will be weeping if interest 
rates skyrocket (as they did in the early 1980s) to the 15-plus percent level. 
(With the rise of interest rates and inflation at that time, mortgage lenders 
Balloon loans
One type of mortgage, known as a balloon 
loan, appears at first blush to be somewhat 
like a hybrid loan. The interest rate is fixed, for 
example, for five, seven, or ten years. However, 
and this is a big however, at the end of this time 
period, the full loan balance becomes due. In 
other words, you must pay off the entire loan.
Borrowers are attracted to balloon loans for the 
same reason that they’re attracted to hybrid or 
ARM loans — because balloon loans start at 
a lower interest rate than do fixed-rate mort-
gages. Buyers are sometimes seduced into 
such loans during high-interest-rate periods or 
when they can’t qualify for or afford the pay-
ments of a traditional mortgage.
We don’t like balloon loans because they can 
blow up in your face. You may become trapped 
without a mortgage if you’re unable to refinance 
(obtain a new mortgage to replace the old loan) 
when the balloon loan comes due. You may 
have problems refinancing if, for example, you 
lose your job, your income drops, the value of 
your property declines and the appraisal comes 
in too low to qualify you for a new loan, or 
interest rates increase and you can’t qualify for 
a new loan at those higher rates.
In the real estate trade, balloon loans are also 
called bullet loans. Why? If the loan comes due 
during a period of high mortgage rates, industry 
people say that it’s like getting hit by a bullet.
Remember that refinancing a mortgage is never 
a sure thing. Taking a balloon loan may be a 
financially hazardous short-term solution to 
your long-term financing needs.
The one circumstance under which we say 
that it’s okay to consider a balloon loan is if you 
absolutely must have a particular property and 
the balloon loan is your one and only mortgage 
option. If that’s the case, you should also be 
as certain as you can be that you’ll be able to 
refinance when the balloon loan comes due. If 
you have family members who could step in to 
help with the refinancing, either by cosigning 
or by loaning you the money themselves, that’s 
a big backup plus. Oh, and if you must take out 
a balloon loan, get as long a term as possible, 
ideally for no less than seven years (ten years 
is preferable), and always start the refinancing 
process at least six to eight months before your 
balloon loan is due.

Par t II: Financing 101 
were paying interest rates to depositors that were almost double the levels of 
the interest they were charging for mortgages that had commenced a decade 
before. Not a profitable way to run a bank!)
In addition to paying a premium interest rate when you take out the loan, 
another potential drawback to fixed-rate loans is that if interest rates fall 
significantly after you take out your mortgage, you face the risk of being 
stranded with your costly mortgage. That could happen if (because of dete-
rioration in your financial situation or a decline in your property’s value) you 
don’t qualify to refinance (get a new loan to replace the old one). Even if you 
do qualify to refinance, doing so takes time and usually costs money for a 
new appraisal, loan fees, and title insurance.
Here are a couple other possible minor drawbacks to be aware of with some 
fixed-rate mortgages:
 
✓ If you sell your house before paying off your fixed-rate mortgage, your 
buyers probably won’t be able to assume that mortgage. The ability to 
pass your loan on to the next buyer (in real estate talk, the next buyer 
assumes your loan) can be useful if you’re forced to sell during a rare 
period of ultra-high interest rates, such as occurred in the early 1980s.
 
✓ Fixed-rate mortgages sometimes have prepayment penalties (explained 
in the sidebar “Avoid loans with prepayment penalties”).
Avoid loans with prepayment penalties
Some mortgages come with a provision that 
penalizes you for paying off the loan balance 
faster. Such penalties can amount to as much 
as several percentage points of the amount of 
the mortgage balance that’s paid off early.
When you pay off a mortgage early because 
you sold the property or because you want to 
refinance the loan to take advantage of lower 
interest rates, a few lenders won’t enforce their 
loan’s prepayment penalties as long as they get 
to make the new mortgage. Even so, your hands 
are tied financially unless you go through the 
same lender.
Many states place limits on the duration and 
amount of prepayment penalty that lenders 
may charge for mortgages made on owner-
occupied residential property. The only way to 
know whether a loan has a prepayment pen-
alty is to ask and to carefully review the federal 
truth-in-lending disclosure and the promissory 
note the mortgage lender provides you. We 
think that you should avoid such loans. (Many 
so-called no-points loans have prepayment 
penalties.)

101
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
Adjustable-rate mortgages
Fixed-rate mortgages aren’t your only option. Mortgage lenders were intel-
ligent enough to realize that they couldn’t foresee how much future inter-
est rates would rise or fall; thus, adjustable-rate mortgages (adjustables for 
short) were born.
Although some adjustables are more volatile than others, all are similar in 
that they fluctuate (or float) with the market level of interest rates. If the inter-
est rate fluctuates, so does your monthly payment. And therein lies the risk: 
Because a mortgage payment is likely to be a big monthly expense for you, an 
adjustable-rate mortgage that’s adjusting upward may wreak havoc with your 
budget.
Given all the trials, tribulations, and challenges of life as we know it, you may 
rightfully ask, “Why would anyone choose to accept an adjustable-rate mort-
gage?” Well, people who are stretching themselves — such as some first-time 
buyers or those trading up to a more expensive home — may financially force 
themselves into accepting adjustable-rate mortgages. Because an ARM starts 
out at a lower interest rate, such a mortgage enables you to qualify to borrow 
more. As we discuss in Chapter 2, just because you can qualify to borrow 
more doesn’t mean that you can afford to borrow that much, given your other 
financial goals and needs.
Some home buyers who can qualify for either an adjustable-rate or a fixed-
rate mortgage of the same size have a choice and choose the fluctuating 
adjustable-rate mortgage. Why? Because they may very well save themselves 
money, in the form of smaller total interest charges, with an adjustable-rate 
loan rather than a fixed-rate loan.
Because you accept the risk of a possible increase in interest rates, mortgage 
lenders cut you a little slack. The initial interest rate (also sometimes referred 
to as the teaser rate) on an adjustable should be less than the initial interest 
rate on a comparable fixed-rate loan. In fact, an ARM’s interest rate for the 
first year or two of the loan is generally lower than the rate on a fixed-rate 
mortgage.
Another advantage of an ARM is that if you purchase your home during a 
time of high interest rates, you can start paying your mortgage with the 
artificially depressed initial interest rate. Should interest rates subsequently 
decline, you can enjoy the benefits of lower rates without refinancing.
Another situation when adjustable-rate loans have an advantage over their 
fixed-rate brethren is when interest rates decline and you don’t qualify to 
refinance your mortgage to reap the advantage of lower rates. The good news 
for homeowners who are unable to refinance and who have an ARM is that 

102
Par t II: Financing 101 
they usually capture many of the benefits of the lower rates. With a fixed-rate 
loan, you must refinance in order to realize the benefits of a decline in inter-
est rates.
 
The downside to an adjustable-rate loan is that if interest rates in general rise, 
your loan’s interest and monthly payment will likely rise, too. During most 
time periods, if rates rise more than 1 or 2 percent and stay elevated, the 
adjustable-rate loan is likely to cost you more than a fixed-rate loan.
Before you make the final choice between a fixed-rate mortgage and an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, read the following two sections.
What would rising interest rates do to your finances?
 
Far too many home buyers, especially first-timers, take out an adjustable-rate 
mortgage because doing so allows them to stretch and borrow more to buy a 
more expensive home. Although some of this overborrowing is caused by the 
modern-day American spendthrift “I gotta have it today” attitude, overborrow-
ing is also encouraged by some real estate and mortgage salespeople. After all, 
these salespeople’s income, in the form of a commission, is a function of the 
cost of the home that you buy and the size of the mortgage that you take on.
If you haven’t already done so, let your fingers do the walking back to 
Chapters 2 and 3. Read and digest these chapters in order to understand how 
much you can really afford to spend on a home, given your other financial 
needs, commitments, and goals.
 
When considering an ARM, you absolutely, positively must understand what 
rising interest rates (and, therefore, a rising monthly mortgage payment) 
would do to your personal finances. Consider taking an ARM only if you can 
answer all of the following questions in the affirmative:
 
✓ Is your monthly budget such that you can afford higher mortgage pay-
ments and still accomplish other financial goals that are important to 
you, such as saving for retirement?
 
✓ Do you have an emergency reserve (equal to at least six months of living 
expenses) that you can tap into to make the potentially higher monthly 
mortgage payments?
 
✓ Can you afford the highest payment allowed on the adjustable-rate 
mortgage?
 
 The mortgage lender can tell you the highest possible monthly payment, 
which is the payment that you would owe if the interest rate on your 
ARM went to the lifetime interest-rate cap allowed on the loan.
 
✓ If you’re stretching to borrow near the maximum the lender allows or an 
amount that will test the limits of your budget, are your job and income 
stable?

103
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
 
✓ If you expect to have children in the future, have you considered that 
your household expenses will rise and your income may fall with the 
arrival of those little bundles of joy?
 
✓ Can you handle the psychological stress of changing interest rates and 
mortgage payments?
If you’re fiscally positioned to take on the financial risks inherent to an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, by all means consider taking one — we’re not 
trying to talk you into a fixed-rate loan. The odds are with you to save money, 
in the form of lower interest charges and payments, with an ARM. Your inter-
est rate starts lower (and generally stays lower, if the overall level of interest 
rates doesn’t change). Even if rates do go up, as they are sometimes prone to 
do, they’ll surely come back down. So if you can stick with your ARM through 
times of high and low interest rates, you should still come out ahead.
Also recognize that although ARMs do carry the risk of a fluctuating interest 
rate, almost all adjustable-rate loans limit, or cap, the rise in the interest rate 
allowed on your loan. We certainly wouldn’t recommend that you take an ARM 
without caps. Typical caps are 2 percent per year and 6 percent over the life of 
the loan. (We cover ARM interest-rate caps in detail later in this chapter.)
When to consider hybrid loans
If you want more stability in your monthly pay-
ments than you can get with a regular adjustable, 
and you expect to keep your loan for no more 
than five to ten years, a hybrid (or intermediate 
ARM) loan with a fixed interest rate for the loan’s 
first five to ten years, which is explained earlier in 
this chapter, may be the best loan for you.
The longer the initial interest rate stays locked 
in, the higher it will be, but the initial rate of a 
hybrid ARM is almost always lower than the 
interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. 
However, because the initial rate of hybrid 
loans is locked in for a longer period of time 
than the six-month or one-year term of regular 
ARMs, hybrid ARMs have higher initial interest 
rates than regular ARM loans.
During periods when little difference exists 
between short-term and long-term interest 
rates, the interest-rate savings with a hybrid 
or regular adjustable (versus a fixed-rate loan) 
are minimal (less than 1 percent). In fact, during 
certain times, the initial interest rate on a 7- or 
10-year hybrid was exactly the same as on a 
30-year fixed-rate loan. During such periods, 
fixed-rate loans offer the best overall value.
To evaluate hybrids, weigh the likelihood that 
you’ll move before the initial loan interest rate 
expires. For example, with a 7-year hybrid, if 
you’re saving, say, 0.5 percent per year versus 
the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage but you’re quite 
sure that you’ll move within seven years, the 
hybrid will probably save you money. On the 
other hand, if there’s a reasonable chance that 
you’ll stay put for more than seven years and 
you don’t want to face the risk of rising pay-
ments after seven years, you should opt for a 
30-year, fixed-rate mortgage instead.

104
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
Consider an adjustable-rate mortgage only if you’re financially and emo-
tionally secure enough to handle the maximum possible payments over an 
extended period of time. ARMs work best for borrowers who take out smaller 
loans than they’re qualified for or who consistently save more than 10 percent 
of their monthly income. If you do choose an ARM, make sure that you have a 
significant cash cushion that’s accessible in the event that rates go up. Don’t 
take an adjustable just because the initially lower interest rate allows you to 
afford a more expensive home. Better to buy a home that you can afford with 
a fixed-rate mortgage. (And don’t forget hybrid loans if you want a loan with 
more payment stability but aren’t willing to pay the premium of a long-term, 
fixed-rate loan.)
How long do you expect to stay in the home/mortgage?
This is the single most important question you need to answer. As we explain 
earlier in this chapter, a mortgage lender takes more risk when lending 
money at a fixed rate of interest for many (15 to 30) years. Lenders charge 
you a premium, in the form of a higher interest rate than what the ARM starts 
at, for the interest-rate risk that they assume with a fixed-rate loan.
Short-term versus long-term interest rates
When choosing between an adjustable-rate 
mortgage and a fixed-rate mortgage, many 
people don’t realize that they’re making a choice 
between a mortgage on which the interest rate 
is determined by either short-term or long-term 
interest rates.
“What’s a short-term versus a long-term inter-
est rate?” you ask. Glad you asked. When a 
mortgage lender quotes an interest rate for a 
particular type of loan, he should specify (in 
terms of how many years until the loan is com-
pletely paid off) the length of the loan.
Most of the time, borrowers must pay a higher 
interest rate to borrow money for a longer 
period of time. Conversely, borrowers gener-
ally pay a lower rate of interest for shorter-term 
loans. So?
Well, the interest rates that are used to deter-
mine most adjustable-rate mortgages are 
short-term interest rates, whereas fixed-rate 
mortgage interest rates are dictated by long-
term interest rates. During most time periods, 
longer-term interest rates are higher than 
shorter-term rates because of the greater risk 
the lender accepts in committing to a longer-
term rate.
It stands to reason, therefore, that when little 
difference exists in the market level of short-
term and long-term interest rates, the rates of 
fixed-rate mortgages shouldn’t be all that differ-
ent from the rates of adjustable-rate mortgages. 
Thus, adjustables appear less attractive, and 
fixed-rate mortgages appear more alluring.
On the other hand, when short-term interest 
rates are significantly lower than long-term 
interest rates, adjustable-rate mortgages should 
be available at rates a good deal lower than the 
rates for fixed-rate loans. All things being equal, 
adjustables appear more attractive during such 
time periods and save you more money during 
the early years of your loan.

105
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
If you don’t plan or expect to stay in your home for a long time, you should 
consider an ARM. Saving money on interest charges for most adjustables is 
usually guaranteed in the first two to three years because an ARM starts at 
a lower interest rate than a fixed-rate loan does. If you’re reasonably certain 
that you’ll hold onto your home for fewer than five years, you should come 
out ahead with an adjustable. However, you should also ask yourself why 
you’re going to all the trouble and expense of buying a home that you expect 
to sell so soon.
 
If you expect to hold onto your home and mortgage for a long time — more 
than five years — a fixed-rate loan may make more sense, especially when 
you’re not in a position to withstand the fluctuating monthly payments that 
come with an ARM.
When you’re in the intermediate area (expecting to stay seven to ten years, 
for example), consider the hybrid loans we discuss earlier in this chapter.
If you’re still stuck on the fence, go with the fixed-rate loan. A fixed-rate loan 
is financially safer than an ARM — and easier to shop for.
Deciding on your loan’s life: 
15 years or 30?
After you decide which type of mortgage — fixed or adjustable — you want, 
you may think that your mortgage quandaries are behind you. Unfortunately, 
they’re not. You also need to make another important choice — typically 
between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage. (Not all mortgages come in just 
15- and 30-year varieties. You may run across some 20- and 40-year versions, 
but that won’t change the issues we’re about to tackle.)
When you’re stretching to buy the home you want, you may also be forcing 
yourself to take the longer-term, 30-year mortgage. Doing so isn’t necessarily 
bad and, in fact, has advantages.
The main advantage that a 30-year mortgage has over its 15-year peer is that 
it has lower monthly payments that free up more of your monthly income for 
other purposes, including saving for other important financial goals (such as 
retirement). You may want to have more money so that you aren’t a financial 
prisoner to your home and can just have a life! A 30-year mortgage has lower 
monthly payments because you have a longer period to repay it (which trans-
lates into more payments). A fixed-rate 30-year mortgage with an interest rate 
of 7 percent, for example, has payments that are approximately 25 percent 
lower than those on a comparable 15-year mortgage.

106
Par t II: Financing 101 
What if you can afford the higher payments that a 15-year mortgage requires? 
You shouldn’t necessarily take it. What if, instead of making large payments 
on the 15-year mortgage, you make smaller payments on a 30-year mortgage 
and put that extra money to productive use?
 
If you do, indeed, make productive use of that extra money, the 30-year 
mortgage may be for you. A terrific potential use for that extra dough is to 
contribute it to a tax-deductible retirement account that you have access to. 
Contributions that you add to employer-based 401(k) and 403(b) plans (and 
self-employed SEP-IRAs or Keoghs) not only give you an immediate reduction 
in taxes but also enable your investment to compound, tax-deferred, over the 
years ahead. Everyone with employment income may also contribute to an 
Individual Retirement Account (IRA). However, your IRA contributions may 
not be immediately tax-deductible if your (or your spouse’s) employer offers a 
retirement account or pension plan.
 
If you exhaust your options for contributing to all the retirement accounts 
that you can, and if you find it challenging to save money anyway, the 15-year 
mortgage may offer you a good forced-savings program.
When you elect to take a 30-year mortgage, you retain the flexibility to pay it 
off faster if you so choose. (Just be sure to avoid those mortgages that have 
a prepayment penalty, as we explain earlier in this chapter.) Constraining 
yourself with the 15-year mortgage’s higher monthly payments does carry a 
risk. Should you fall on tough financial times, you may not be able to meet the 
required mortgage payments.
Finding a Fixed-Rate Mortgage
If you decide, based upon our advice and selection criteria, to go with a 
fixed-rate loan, great! You shouldn’t be disappointed. You’ll have the peace 
of mind that comes with stable mortgage payments. And because fixed-rate 
loans have fewer options, they’re a good deal easier to compare than 
adjustable-rate loans.
However, we don’t want to give you the false impression that fixed-rate loans 
are as simple to shop for as carbonated beverages. Unfortunately, because 
of the hundreds of lenders that offer such loans and the seemingly endless 
number of extra fees and expenses that lenders tack onto loans, you need to 
put on your smart-consumer hat and sharpen your No. 2 pencil.
Be sure that you understand the following sections before you attempt to 
choose the best fixed-rate loan to meet your needs.

107
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
The all-important interest rate
If you’ve ever borrowed money, you know that lenders aren’t charities. 
Lenders make money by charging you, in the form of interest, for the use of 
their money. Lenders normally quote the rate of interest as a percentage per 
year of the amount borrowed. You may be familiar with rates of interest if 
you’ve ever borrowed money through student loans, credit cards, or auto 
loans. In these cases, lenders may have charged you 8, 10, 12, or perhaps 
even 18 percent or more for the privilege of using their money. Similarly, 
mortgage lenders also quote you an annual interest rate.
You’ve shopped for other products and services by phone, so you may as 
well get on the horn and call lenders, as well. The first one you call may be 
offering a fixed-rate loan at an interest rate of 7.5 percent. Then you call 
another lender to try to beat that rate, and that lender says, “Sure, we can get 
you into a fixed-rate loan at 7.25 percent.”
 
Be careful of lenders telling you what you want to hear in your first phone call 
with them. Remember that no reputable lender can commit to an interest rate 
without reviewing your loan application and credit score.
No one can accurately predict where 
interest rates are headed
All you rational readers out there are prob-
ably commenting that the choice between an 
adjustable-rate mortgage and a fixed-rate mort-
gage is simple. All you need to know in order 
to make a decision is the direction of interest 
rates. It’s only logical. When interest rates are 
about ready to rise, a fixed-rate mortgage is 
favorable. Lock in a low rate and smile smugly 
when interest rates skyrocket.
Conversely, if you think that rates are going 
to stay the same or drop, you would want an 
ARM. Some real estate books that we’ve read 
even go so far as to say that your own personal 
interest-rate forecast should determine whether 
to take an ARM or fixed-rate mortgage! “Interest-
rate forecasts should be the major factor in 
deciding whether or not to get an ARM,” argues 
one such book.
Now, we don’t think that you’re stupid, but 
you’re not going to figure out which way rates 
are headed. The movement of interest rates 
isn’t logical, and you certainly can’t predict it. If 
you could, you would make a fortune investing 
in bonds, interest-rate futures, and options.
Even the money-management pros who work 
with interest rates and bonds as a full-time 
job can’t consistently predict interest rates. 
Witness the fact that bond-fund managers at 
mutual fund companies have a tough time beat-
ing the buy-and-hold bond-market indexes. If 
bond-fund managers could foresee where rates 
were headed, they could easily beat the aver-
ages by trading into and out of bonds when they 
foresee interest-rate changes on the horizon.

The finer points of points
 
If you blindly choose a 7.25 percent loan, you could be making a very expen-
sive mistake. You have an idea of what we mean if you’ve heard the expres-
sion “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” You shouldn’t judge a mortgage solely 
by its interest rate, either. You must also understand the points and other 
loan fees that the lender assesses.
Just as Abbott goes with Costello, Laurel goes with Hardy, and Calvin is 
inseparable from Hobbes, the interest rate on a mortgage should go together, 
in your mind, with the points on the loan. We aren’t talking about the kind of 
points that a basketball player tallies during a game for each successful shot. 
Points on a mortgage cost you money.
Points are up-front interest. Lenders charge points as a way of being paid for 
the work and expense of processing and approving your mortgage. When 
you buy a home, the points are tax-deductible — you get to claim them as an 
itemized expense on Schedule A of your IRS Form 1040 (see Chapter 3). When 
you refinance, in contrast, the points must be spread out for tax purposes 
and deducted over the life of the new loan.
Lenders quote points as a percentage of the mortgage amount and require 
you to pay them at the time that you close on your home purchase and begin 
the lengthy process of repaying your loan. One point is equal to 1 percent of 
the amount that you’re borrowing. For example, if a lender says that the loan 
being proposed to you has two points, that simply means that you must pay 
2 percent of the loan amount as points. On a $120,000 loan, for example, two 
points cost you $2,400. That’s not chump change!
 
The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan has an inverse relationship to that loan’s 
points. When you’re able to (or desire to) pay more points on a mortgage, 
the lender should reduce the ongoing interest rate. This reduction may be 
beneficial to you if you have the cash to pay more points and want to lower 
the interest rate that you’ll pay year after year. If you expect to hold onto the 
home and mortgage for many years, the lower the interest rate, the better.
Conversely, if you want to (or need to) pay fewer points (perhaps because 
you’re cash-constrained when you make the home purchase), you can pay 
a higher ongoing interest rate. The shorter the time that you expect to hold 
onto the mortgage, the more sense this strategy of paying less now makes. 
Again, the key question is, how long do you intend to keep your home?
 
Don’t get suckered into believing that “no-point” loans are a good deal. There 
are no free lunches in the real estate world. Remember the points/interest-rate 
trade-off: If you pay less in points, the ongoing interest rate is higher. So if a 
loan has zero points, it must have a higher interest rate. This doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that the loan is better or worse than comparable loans from other 

109
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
lenders. However, it has been our experience that lenders who aggressively 
push no-point loans aren’t the most competitive lenders in terms of pricing. 
No-point loans make sense only when you’re really tight on cash for your 
home purchase and expect not to hold onto the home and mortgage for the 
long term.
Take a look at a couple of specific mortgage options to understand the 
points/interest-rate trade-off. Suppose that you want to borrow $150,000. One 
lender quotes you 7.25 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan and charges one 
point (1 percent). Another lender quotes 7.75 percent and doesn’t charge any 
points. Which offer is better? The answer depends mostly on how long you 
plan to keep the loan.
The 7.25-percent loan costs $1,024 per month compared with $1,075 per 
month for the 7.75-percent mortgage. You can save $51 per month with the 
7.25-percent loan, but you’d have to pay $1,500 in points to get it.
To find out which loan is better for you, divide the cost of the points by 
the monthly savings ($1,500 divided by $51 equals 29.4). This gives you the 
number of months (in this case, 29.4) it will take you to recover the cost of 
the points. The 7.25-percent loan costs 0.5 percent less in interest annually 
than the 7.75-percent loan. Year after year, the 7.25-percent loan saves you 
0.5 percent. But because you have to pay one point up front on the 7.25-
percent mortgage, it will take you about 30 months to earn back the savings 
to cover the cost of that point. So if you expect to keep the loan more than 30 
months, go with the 7.25-percent, one-point option. If you don’t plan to keep 
the loan for 30 months, choose the no-points loan.
 
To make a fair comparison of mortgages from different lenders, have the lend-
ers provide interest-rate quotes at the same point level. Ask the mortgage con-
tenders, for example, to tell you what their fixed-rate mortgage interest rate 
would be at one point. Also, make sure that the loans are of the same term — 
for example, 30 years.
Other lender fees
You may think that because you’re paying points with your mortgage, you 
don’t have to pay any other up-front fees. Well, think again. There’s no short-
age of up-front loan-processing charges for you to investigate when making 
mortgage comparisons. If you don’t understand the fee structure, you may 
end up with a high-cost loan or come up short of cash when the time comes 
to close on your home purchase.

110
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
Ask each lender whose services you’re seriously considering for a written 
itemization of all of these “other” charges. To reduce your chances of throw-
ing money away on a mortgage for which you may not qualify, ask the lender 
whether your application may be turned down for some reason. For example, 
disclose any potential problems with the property that were discovered 
during inspections of the property (see Chapter 13 for details on inspections).
Just as some lenders have no-point mortgages, some lenders also have no-fee 
mortgages. If a lender is pitching a no-fee loan, odds are that the lender will 
charge you more in other ways, namely in the ongoing interest rate on your 
loan.
Application and processing fees
Lenders generally charge $200 to $500 up front as an application or processing 
fee. This charge is mainly to ensure that you’re serious about wanting a loan 
from them and to compensate them in the event that your loan is rejected. 
Lenders want to cover their costs to keep from losing money on loan applica-
tions that don’t materialize into actual loans. A few lenders don’t charge this 
fee, or if they do, they return it if you take their loan.
Credit report
Your credit report tells a lender how responsibly you’ve dealt with prior 
loans. Did you pay all of your previous loans back (and on time)? Credit 
reports don’t cost a great deal, but you can expect to pay about $50 to $75 
for the lender to obtain a current copy of yours.
 
If you know that you have blemishes on your credit report, address those 
problems before you apply for your mortgage. Otherwise, you’re wasting your 
time and money. Don’t apply for a loan that you know will be denied. Flip to 
Chapter 5 for tips on improving your credit score.
Appraisal
Mortgage lenders want an independent assessment to ensure that the prop-
erty that you’re buying is worth approximately what you agree to pay — that’s 
the job of an appraiser. Why would the lender care? Simple — because the 
lender is likely loaning you a large portion of the property’s purchase price. If 
you overpay and home values decline or you end up in financial trouble, you 
may be willing to walk away from the property and leave the lender holding 
the bag.
The cost of an appraisal varies with the size, complexity, and value of prop-
erty. Expect to pay a few hundred dollars for an appraisal of most modestly 
priced, average-type properties.

 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
Arriving at the Absolute Best Adjustable
If you’re the calm and collected type of person who isn’t prone to panicking, 
can stomach interest-rate volatility, and have decided based on our sage 
advice to go with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), you need to under-
stand a bit more in order to choose a good one. Adjustables are more compli-
cated to evaluate and select than fixed-rate mortgages are.
In addition to understanding points and other loan fees that we cover in the 
preceding section on fixed-rate loans, you’ll be bombarded with such jargon 
as margins, caps, and indexes. Numbers geeks can easily spend hundreds of 
hours comparing different permutations of ARMs and determining how they 
may behave in different interest-rate environments.
 
Unlike with a fixed-rate mortgage, precisely determining the amount of money 
a particular ARM is going to cost you isn’t possible. As with choosing a home 
to buy, selecting an ARM that meets your needs and budget involves compro-
mising and deciding what’s important to you. So here’s your crash course in 
understanding ARMs.
Where an ARM’s interest rate comes from
 
Most ARMs start at an artificially low interest rate. Selecting an ARM based on 
this rate is likely to be a huge mistake because you won’t be paying this low 
rate for long, perhaps for just 6 to 12 months — or maybe even just 1 month! 
Lenders and mortgage brokers are like many other salespeople; they like to 
promote something that will catch your attention and get you thinking you’re 
going to get a great deal. That’s why lenders and brokers are most likely to tell 
you first about the low teaser rate.
The starting rate on an ARM isn’t anywhere near as important as what the 
future interest rate is going to be on the loan. How the future interest rate on 
an ARM is determined is the single most important feature for you to under-
stand when evaluating an ARM.
All ARMs that we’ve ever seen are based on an equation that includes an 
index and margin, the two of which are added together to determine and set 
the future interest rate on the loan. Before we go further, please be sure that 
you understand these terms:
 
✓ Index: The index is a measure of interest rates that the lender uses as a 
reference. For example, the six-month bank certificate of deposit index is 
used as a reference for many mortgages. Suppose that the going rate on 
six-month CDs is approximately 5 percent. The index theoretically indi-
cates how much it costs the bank to take in money that it can then lend.

112
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
✓ Margin: The margin is the lenders’ profit (or markup) on the money 
that they intend to lend. Most loans have margins of around 2.5 percent, 
but the exact margin depends on the lender and the index that lender 
is using. When you compare loans that are tied to the same index and 
are otherwise the same, the loan with the lower margin is better (lower 
cost) for you.
 
✓ Interest rate: The interest rate is the sum of the index and the margin. 
It’s what you will pay (subject to certain limitations) on your loan.
Putting it all together, in our example of the six-month CD index at 5 percent 
plus a margin of 2.5 percent, we get an interest rate sum of 7.5 percent. This 
figure is known as the fully indexed rate. If this loan starts out at 5 percent, for 
example, the fully indexed rate tells you what interest rate this ARM would 
increase to if the market level of interest rates, as measured by the CD index, 
stays constant. Never take an ARM unless you understand this important 
concept of the fully indexed rate:
Index + margin = interest rate
 
Many mortgage lenders know that more than a few borrowers focus on an 
ARM’s initial interest rate and ignore the margin and the index that determine 
the loan rate. Take our advice and look at an ARM’s starting rate last. Begin to 
evaluate an ARM by understanding what index it’s tied to and what margin it 
has. The sections that follow explain common ARM indexes.
Treasury bills
The U.S. federal government is the largest borrower in the universe as we 
know it, so it should come as no surprise that at least one ARM index is 
based on the interest rate that the government pays on some of this pile of 
debt. The most commonly used government interest rate indexes for ARMs 
are for 6-month and 12-month Treasury bills.
The Treasury-bill indexes tend to be among the faster-moving ones around. In 
other words, they respond quickly to market changes in interest rates.
Certificates of deposit
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are interest-bearing bank investments that lock 
you in for a specific period of time. Adjustable-rate mortgages are usually tied 
to the average interest rate that banks are paying on six-month CDs.
As with Treasury bills, CDs tend to move rapidly with overall changes in 
interest rates. However, CD rates tend to move up a bit more slowly when 
rates rise because profit-minded bankers like to drag their feet when paying 
more interest to depositors. Conversely, CD rates tend to come down quickly 
when rates decline so that bankers can maintain their profits.

113
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
The 11th District Cost of Funds Index
The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (also known as COFI, pronounced like 
the caffeinated brew that some people drink in the morning) is published 
monthly by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. This index shows the 
monthly weighted average cost of savings, borrowings, and advances for its 
member banks located in California, Arizona, and Nevada (the 11th District). 
Because the COFI is a moving average of the rates that bankers have paid 
depositors over recent months, it tends to be a relatively stable index.
 
An ARM tied to a slower-moving index, such as the 11th District Cost of Funds 
Index, has the advantage of increasing more slowly when interest rates are on 
the upswing. On the other hand, you have to be patient to benefit from falling 
interest rates when rates are on the decline. The 11th District is slow to fall 
when interest rates overall decline.
Because ARMs tied to the 11th District Cost of Funds Index are slower to rise 
when overall interest rates rise, they generally begin at a higher rate of inter-
est than do ARMs tied to faster-moving indexes.
The London Interbank Offered Rate Index
Okay, now for a more unusual index. The London Interbank Offered Rate Index 
(LIBOR) is an average of the interest rates that major international banks 
charge one another to borrow U.S. dollars in the London money market. Like 
the U.S. Treasury and CD indexes, LIBOR tends to move and adjust quite rap-
idly to changes in interest rates.
Why do we need an international interest-rate index? Well, foreign investors 
buy American mortgages as investments, and not surprisingly, these investors 
like ARMs tied to an index that they understand and are more familiar with.
How often does the interest rate adjust?
Lenders usually adjust the interest rates on their ARMs every 6 or 12 months, 
using the mortgage-rate formula we discuss earlier in this section. Some loans 
adjust monthly. (Monthly adjustments are usually a red flag for negative 
amortization loans; we explain why to stay away from these loans in the later 
sidebar, “Avoid adjustables with negative amortization.”) In advance of each 
adjustment, the mortgage lender should send you a notice spelling out how the 
new rate is calculated according to the agreed-upon terms of your ARM.
 
The less often your loan adjusts, the less financial risk you’re accepting. In 
exchange for taking less risk, the mortgage lender normally expects you to pay 
a higher initial interest rate.

114
Par t II: Financing 101 
Limits on interest-rate adjustments
Despite the fact that an ARM has a system for calculating future interest rates 
(by adding the margin to the loan index), bankers limit how great a change 
can occur in the actual rate that you pay. These limits, also known as rate 
caps, affect each future adjustment of an ARM’s rate following the end of the 
initial rate.
Periodic adjustment caps limit the maximum rate change, up or down, allowed 
at each adjustment. For ARMs that adjust at six-month intervals, the adjust-
ment cap is usually 1 percent. ARMs that adjust more than once annually gen-
erally restrict the maximum rate change allowed over the entire year, as well. 
This annual rate cap is usually 2 percent.
Finally, almost all adjustables come with lifetime caps. You should never take 
on an ARM without a lifetime cap. These caps limit the highest rate allowed 
over the entire life of the loan. ARMs commonly have lifetime caps of 5 to 6 
percent higher than the initial rate.
Avoid adjustables with negative amortization
Some ARMs cap the increase of your monthly 
payment but not the increase of the interest 
rate. The size of your mortgage payment may 
not reflect all the interest that you actually owe 
on your loan. So rather than paying the interest 
that’s owed and paying off some of your loan 
balance every month, you may end up paying 
some (but not all) of the interest that you owe. 
Thus, the extra unpaid interest that you still owe 
is added to your outstanding debt.
As you make mortgage payments over time, the 
loan balance you still owe is gradually reduced 
in a process called amortizing the mortgage. 
The reverse of this process (that is, increasing 
the size of your loan balance) is called negative 
amortization.
Liken negative amortization to paying only the 
minimum payment required on a credit card bill. 
You continue accumulating additional interest 
on the balance as long as you make only the 
minimum monthly payment. However, doing 
this with a mortgage defeats the purpose of 
your borrowing an amount that fits your overall 
financial goals (see Chapter 3).
Some lenders try to hide the fact that the ARM 
they’re pitching you has negative amortiza-
tion. How can you avoid negative-amortization 
loans? Simple — ask!
Also be aware that negative amortization pops 
up more often on mortgages that lenders con-
sider risky to make. If you’re having trouble find-
ing lenders willing to offer you a mortgage, be 
especially careful.
Last but not least, realize that many lenders 
won’t put additional financing in the form of 
second mortgages or home-equity lines of 
credit behind a negative-amortization loan. 
They fear that if the negative-amortization loan 
amount grows too large, it could swallow all the 
equity in the property.

115
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
 
When you take on an ARM, be sure that you can handle the maximum possible 
payment allowed, should the interest rate on the ARM rise to the lifetime cap. 
If, for example, the ARM’s start rate is 5 percent and lifetime cap is 6 percent, 
you could be paying 11 percent interest in just three short years in the worst 
possible case.
Locating the Best, Lowest-Cost Lenders
For those of you out there who abhor shopping, we have some bad news. 
Unless you enjoy throwing away thousands of dollars, you need to shop 
around for the best deal on a mortgage. Think of it as “dialing for dollars” (or 
“surfing for dollars,” for you Web users).
Whether you do the footwork on your own or hire someone competent to 
help you doesn’t matter. But you must make sure that this comparison shop-
ping gets done.
Suppose that you’re in the market for a 30-year, $100,000 mortgage. If, 
through persistent and wise shopping, you’re able to obtain a mortgage that 
is, for example, 0.5 percent per year lower in interest charges than you oth-
erwise would have gotten, you’ll save about $14,000 over the life of the loan 
(given approximate current interest rates). You can double those savings for 
a $200,000 mortgage.
 
Although we encourage you to find the lowest-cost lenders, we must first issue 
a caution: Should someone offer you a deal that’s much better than any other 
lender’s, be skeptical and suspicious. Such a lender may be baiting you with a 
loan that doesn’t exist or with one for which you can’t qualify, and then you’ll 
get stuck with a higher-cost loan if you don’t have time to apply for another 
mortgage elsewhere.
Shopping on your own
Most areas have no shortage of mortgage lenders. Although having a large 
number of options to choose from is good for competition, so many alterna-
tives can also make shopping a headache.
Many different types of companies offer mortgages today. The most common 
mortgage originators (as they’re known in the business) are banks, savings 
and loan associations, and mortgage bankers.

116
Par t II: Financing 101 
“Who cares?” you ask. Well, mortgage bankers do only mortgages, and the 
best ones offer very competitive rates. Smaller banks and savings and loans 
can have good deals as well. As for the big banks whose names are drilled 
into your head from advertisements, they usually don’t offer the best rates.
As you begin your mortgage safari, you don’t have to go it completely alone. 
If you’ve done a good job selecting a real estate agent to help you with your 
home purchase, for example, the agent should be able to rattle off a short list 
of good lenders and mortgage brokers (see the following section) in the area. 
Just remember to compare these lenders’ loans and rates with those of some 
other mortgage lenders that you find on your own.
 
Otherwise-good real estate agents may send you to lenders that don’t neces-
sarily offer the best mortgage interest rates. Some real estate agents may not 
be up to date with who has the best loans, or they may not be into shopping 
around. Others may have simply gotten comfortable doing business with cer-
tain lenders or gotten client referrals from said lenders previously.
As you surely know, the Internet offers yet another method for tapping into 
companies in a particular line of work. In Chapter 11, we offer plenty of 
advice and recommendations for Web sites that can assist you with mortgage 
shopping.
Another way to find lenders is to look for tables of selected lenders’ inter-
est rates in the Sunday real estate section of the larger area newspapers. 
However, don’t assume that such tables contain the best lenders in your 
area. In fact, many of these tables are sent to newspapers for free by firms 
that distribute information to mortgage brokers. Nonetheless, you can use 
these tables as a starting point by calling the lenders that list the best rates 
(realizing, of course, that rates can change daily and that the rates you see in 
the paper may not accurately reflect what’s currently available).
 
If you’re a data hound, HSH Associates (800-873-2837; www.hsh.com) pub-
lishes, on a weekly basis, lists of dozens of lenders’ rate quotes for most met-
ropolitan areas. The initial package, which comes with explanatory booklets, 
costs $20. If you wish to purchase subsequent updates, those go for $10 each.
Working with a mortgage broker
Mortgage brokers are middlemen, independent of banks or other financial 
institutions that have money to lend. They can do the mortgage shopping 
for you.

 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
Traits of good lenders
Yes, thousands of mortgage lenders are out 
there. However, not anywhere near that many 
mortgage lenders are good lenders. Real estate 
agents and others in the real estate trade, as 
well as other borrowers whom you know, can 
serve as useful references for steering you 
toward the top-notch lenders and away from 
the losers. (To make sure you get unbiased rec-
ommendations, ask your agent whether she’ll 
be paid a referral fee by any of the lenders 
being recommended.) As you solicit input from 
others and begin to interview lenders, seek to 
find lenders with the following traits:
 ✓ Straightforward: Good loan agents explain 
their various loan programs in plain English, 
without using double talk or jargon. They 
provide easy to read, written comparisons 
of their various loan programs which show 
all interest rates, costs, fees, and loan 
terms. They help you compare their loans 
with their competitors’ loans. Run as fast as 
you can in the opposite direction from mort-
gage officers who talk down to you and try 
to snow you with lots of confusing lingo.
 ✓ Approve locally: Good lenders approve 
your loan locally. They don’t send your loan 
application to an out-of-town loan commit-
tee, where you’re transformed from a living, 
breathing human being into an inanimate 
loan number. Good lenders use appraisers 
who are familiar with the local real estate 
market and have experience appraising the 
types of properties that are commonly sold 
locally. Good lenders actively work with you 
and your agent to get loan approval.
 ✓ Market savvy: Good lenders understand 
the type of property that you want to buy. 
Here’s another big advantage of local loan 
approval: No deal-breaking, last-minute 
loan cancellations unexpectedly arise 
because you inadvertently run afoul of 
some obscure institutional policy.
 ✓ This type of snafu generally occurs when a 
mortgage broker tries to find the loan with 
the lowest interest rate currently being 
offered anywhere in the universe. Finding 
the loan is relatively easy. Getting the 
money, on the other hand, is nearly impos-
sible, because you don’t know what bizarre 
quirks lie buried deep in the loan docu-
ments’ fine print.
 ✓ These quirky loans usually apply to abso-
lutely pristine property. For example, an 
out-of-state lender once approved a loan 
subject to having all corrective work com-
pleted and the house painted inside and 
out prior to close of escrow. Given that the 
loan was approved on Monday and the sale 
was scheduled to close Friday, there was 
no way that the work could be completed 
in four days.
 ✓ Competitive: Good lenders are competi-
tive. Don’t be afraid to ask the lender that 
you like best to match the interest rate of 
the lowest-priced lender you find. At worst, 
the lender will turn your rate request down. 
At best, you’ll get the lender you want and 
the loan terms you want. Loan rates and 
charges are negotiable.
 ✓ Detail-oriented: Good lenders meet con-
tract deadlines. They approve and fund 
loans on time. Your agent knows which 
lenders deliver on their promises and 
which don’t. Talk’s cheap. You need action, 
not empty promises. Missed deadlines may 
squash your purchase.

118
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
If your credit history and ability to qualify for a mortgage are questionable, a 
good mortgage broker can help polish and package your application and steer 
you to the few lenders that may make you a loan. Brokers can also assist if 
lenders don’t want to make loans on unusual properties that you’re inter-
ested in buying. Many lenders don’t like dealing with co-ops and tenancies-in-
common (see Chapter 8), borrowers with credit problems, or situations where 
a home buyer seeks to borrow most (90 percent or more) of a property’s 
value.
Mortgage brokers typically tell you that they can get you the best loan deal 
by shopping among many lenders. They may further argue that another 
benefit of using their service is that they can explain the multitude of loan 
choices, help you select a loan, and assist with the morass of paperwork 
that’s (unfortunately) required to get a loan.
Good mortgage brokers can deliver on most of these promises, and for this 
service, they receive a cut of the amount that you borrow — typically, 0.5 to 
as much as 2 percent on smaller loans. Not cheap, but given what a headache 
finding and closing on a good mortgage can be, hiring a mortgage broker may 
be just what the financial doctor ordered.
If you’re going to work with a mortgage broker, please keep in mind that such 
brokers are in the business of “selling” mortgages and derive a commission 
from this work, just as do stockbrokers who sell stock and car salespeople 
who sell cars. A difference, though, is that the interest rate and points that 
you pay to get most mortgages through a broker are the same as what you 
would pay a lender directly. Lenders reason that they can afford to share 
their normal fees with an outside mortgage broker who isn’t employed by 
the bank. After all, if you got the loan directly from the bank, you’d have to 
work with and take up more of the time of one of the bank’s own mortgage 
employees.
However, some lenders, including those with the lowest rates, don’t market 
through mortgage brokers. And sometimes a loan obtained through a mort-
gage broker can end up costing you more than if you had obtained it directly 
from the lender — for example, if the mortgage broker is taking a big commis-
sion for himself.
The commission that the mortgage broker receives from the lender isn’t 
set in stone and is completely negotiable, especially on larger loans. On a 
$100,000 loan, a 1 percent commission amounts to $1,000. The same com-
mission rate on a $300,000 loan results in a $3,000 cut for the broker, even 
though this three-times-larger loan doesn’t take up three times as much of 
the mortgage broker’s time. You have every right to inquire of the mortgage 
broker what his take is. Don’t become overwhelmed with embarrassment; 
remember, it’s your money, and you have every right to know this informa-
tion! Ask — and don’t hesitate to negotiate.

 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
 
Be sure to get all costs and fees in writing prior to committing to take a loan. 
Always ask if the mortgage broker is receiving a yield spread premium from the 
lender. This is an undisclosed fee that you pay for with a higher interest rate 
on your loan.
 
In addition to understanding and negotiating a commission with the mortgage 
broker, get answers to the following questions when choosing a 
mortgage broker:
 
✓ How many lenders does the broker do business with, and how does 
the broker keep up to date with new lenders and loans that may be 
better? Some mortgage brokers, out of habit and laziness, send all their 
business to just a few lenders and don’t get you the best deals. Ask bro-
kers which lenders have approved the broker to represent them.
 
✓ How knowledgeable is the broker about the loan programs, and does 
the broker have the patience to explain all of a loan’s important fea-
tures? The more lenders a mortgage broker represents, the less likely 
the broker is to know the nuances of each and every loan. Be especially 
wary of a salesperson who aggressively pushes certain loan programs 
and glosses over or ignores explaining the important points we discuss 
in this chapter for evaluating particular mortgages.
 
All the advice that we give for selecting a good lender applies doubly for 
choosing a good mortgage broker. Some brokers, for example, have been 
known to push programs with outrageous interest rates and points, which, not 
too surprisingly, entail big commissions for them. This problem occurs most 
frequently with borrowers who have questionable credit or other qualification 
problems.
Also head for cover if your mortgage broker pushes you toward balloon and 
negative-amortization loans (discussed earlier in this chapter). Balloon loans, 
which become fully due and payable several years after you get them, are 
dangerous because you may not be able to get new financing and could be 
forced to sell the property.
 
If you’re on the fence about using a mortgage broker, take this simple test: If 
you’re the type of person who dreads shopping and waits until the last minute 
to buy a gift, a good mortgage broker can probably help and save you money. 
A competent mortgage broker can be of greatest value to those who don’t 
bother shopping around for a good deal or who may be shunned by most 
lenders.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be 
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what bro-
kers say they can get for you.

120
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
Be aware, though, that some brokers only tell you what you want to hear — 
that they can beat your best find. Later, you may discover that the broker isn’t 
able to deliver when the time comes. If you find a good deal on your own and 
want to check with a mortgage broker to see what she has to offer, it may be 
wise not to tell the broker the terms of the best deal you’ve found. If you do, 
more than a few brokers will always come up with something that they say 
can beat it.
Loan prequalification and preapproval
When you’re under contract to buy a property, 
having your mortgage application denied (after 
waiting several weeks) may cause you to lose 
the property after having spent hundreds of dol-
lars on loan fees and property inspections. Even 
worse, you may lose the home that you’ve prob-
ably spent countless hours searching for and a 
great deal of emotional energy to secure. Some 
house sellers won’t be willing to wait or may 
need to sell quickly. If the sellers have other 
buyers waiting in the wings, you’ve likely lost 
the property.
How could you have avoided this heart-
ache? Well, you may hear some people in the 
real estate business, particularly real estate 
agents and mortgage brokers, advocate that 
you go through mortgage prequalification or 
preapproval.
Prequalification is an informal discussion 
between borrower and lender. The lender pro-
vides an opinion of the loan amount that you 
can borrow based solely on what you, the bor-
rower, tell the lender. The lender doesn’t verify 
anything and isn’t bound to make the loan when 
you’re ready to buy.
Preapproval is a much more rigorous pro-
cess, which is why we prefer it if you have 
any reason to believe that you’ll have difficulty 
qualifying for the loan you desire. Loan preap-
proval is based on documented and verified 
information regarding your likelihood of contin-
ued employment, your income, your liabilities, 
and the cash you have available to close on a 
home purchase. The only thing the lender can’t 
preapprove is the property you intend to buy 
because, of course, you haven’t found it yet.
Going through the preapproval process is a sign 
of your seriousness to house sellers — it places 
sort of a Good Borrowing Seal of Approval on 
you. A lender’s preapproval letter is consider-
ably stronger than a prequalification letter. 
In a multiple-offer situation where more than 
one prospective buyer bids on a home at the 
same time, buyers who’ve been preapproved 
for a loan have an advantage over buyers who 
haven’t been proved creditworthy.
Lenders don’t charge for prequalification. Given 
the extra work involved, some lenders do charge 
for preapproval (perhaps a few hundred dol-
lars). Other lenders, however, offer free preap-
provals to gain borrower loyalty. Don’t choose 
a lender just because the lender doesn’t charge 
for preapproval. That lender may not have the 
best loan terms.
If you do choose to get preapproved with a 
lender that charges for it, be sure that you’re 
soon going to go through with a home pur-
chase. Otherwise, you’ll have thrown good 
money down the drain.

121
 Chapter 6: Selecting a Mortgage
 
When a mortgage broker quotes you a really good deal (you’ll know this if 
you’ve shopped a little yourself), ask who the lender is. Most brokers refuse 
to reveal this information until you pay the few hundred dollars to cover the 
appraisal and credit report. In most cases, you can check with the actual 
lender to verify the interest rate and points that the broker quoted you and 
make sure that you’re eligible for the loan. (In some cases, lenders don’t 
market loans directly to the public.)
Should you discover, in calling the lender directly, that the lender doesn’t 
offer such attractive terms to its customers, don’t leap to the conclusion that 
the mortgage broker lied to you. In rare cases, a mortgage broker may offer 
you a slightly better deal than what you could have gotten on your own.
 
If the broker is playing games to get your business, charging the broker’s up-
front fee on your credit card allows you to dispute the charge and get your 
money back.
Should you apply for more than one mortgage?
When you applied to college or for your last 
job, you likely didn’t apply only to your first 
choice. You probably had a backup or two or 
three. Thus, when the time comes to apply for a 
mortgage, you may be tempted to apply to more 
than one mortgage lender. The advantage — if 
one lender doesn’t deliver, you have a backup 
to . . . well, fall back on.
However, we believe that if you do your home-
work and pick a good lender with a reputa-
tion for low rates, quality service, and playing 
straight and meeting borrowers’ expectations, 
applying for more than one mortgage isn’t nec-
essary on most properties. When you apply for 
a second loan, you must pay additional applica-
tion fees and spend more time and effort com-
pleting extra paperwork.
Applying to more than one mortgage lender 
makes more sense in special situations where 
you run a greater risk for having your loan appli-
cation denied. The first case is when you have 
credit problems. Read Chapter 2 to whip your 
finances into shape before you embark on the 
home-buying journey; read Chapter 7 for tips on 
completing your loan application in a way that 
will make lenders salivate.
The second circumstance under which it makes 
sense to apply to more than one mortgage 
lender is when you want to buy a physically 
or legally “difficult” property. It’s impossible, 
of course, to know in advance all the types of 
property idiosyncrasies that will upset a par-
ticular lender. In fact, both of your authors, ear-
lier in our home-ownership days, were denied 
mortgages because our prospective homes had 
quirks that a particular lender didn’t care for. 
Minimize your chances for negative surprises 
by asking your agent and property inspector 
whether any aspects of the property may give a 
lender cause for concern.
If you apply for two loans, tell both lenders that 
you’re applying elsewhere. When the second 
lender pulls your credit report, the first lender’s 
recent inquiry will show up. (Less-than-candid 
borrowers almost always get caught this way.) 
Also tell both lenders that you’re sincerely inter-
ested — just as you would tell all prospective 
employers.

U
nderstanding and selecting a mortgage (the subject of Chapter 6) isn’t 
all that difficult a project after you cut through the jargon and know 
how to think about your overall financial situation and goals.
Unfortunately, when you apply for a mortgage, obstacles may get in your way. 
In this chapter, we show you how to conquer these irritating and sometimes 
not-so-trivial challenges. We also answer your queries about other perplexing 
(and, in some cases, desirable) alternatives you may have.
In the last section of this chapter, we explain how to complete those dreaded 
mortgage application forms.
Overcoming Common Mortgage Problems
Few things in life are more frustrating than not being able to have something 
you really want, especially if you perceive, rightly or wrongly, that most other 
people you know have it. If you want to buy a home and you can’t finance the 
purchase, odds are that your dream will have to be put on hold.
 
Don’t despair if obstacles stand in your way. You may have to exhibit a bit 
more patience than usual, but we’ve never met anyone who was determined 
to buy a home but wasn’t able to overcome credit or other problems. This 
chapter shows you how to get the financing you need and deserve!

124
Par t II: Financing 101 
Insufficient income
Your desired mortgage lender may reject your loan application if you appear 
to be stretching yourself too thin financially. Don’t get angry — the lender 
may be doing you a huge favor by keeping you from buying a home that will 
prevent you from saving money and achieving other financial goals that may 
be important to you over time. (For more on this topic, read Chapters 2 and 3 
about getting your financial house in order and determining how much home 
you really can afford.)
 
If you know that you can afford the home that you have your sights set on, 
here are some keys to getting your loan approved:
 
✓ Be patient. When you have a low income (for example, if you’re self-
employed and have been deducting everything but the kitchen sink as a 
business expense), you may need to wait a year or two so that you can 
demonstrate a higher income.
 
✓ Put more money down. If you make a down payment of 25 to 30 percent 
or more, some mortgage lenders can approve you for their no-income-
verification mortgage loan. Generally speaking, such mortgages come 
with higher interest rates than conventional loans, so recognize that you 
must pay a premium for this type of loan.
 
✓ Get a cosigner. You always knew that you’d hit your parents up again 
someday for help and favors. If your folks are in good financial shape, 
they may be able to cosign a loan to help you qualify. A financially sol-
vent sibling, rich aunt, or wealthy pal can do the same.
 
 Be sure to consider the financial and nonfinancial ramifications of 
having a relative or buddy cosign a loan with you. If you default on the 
loan or make payments late, you’ll besmirch not only your credit history 
but also your cosigner’s. At a minimum, have a frank discussion about 
such issues before you enter into such an arrangement, and be sure to 
write up a loan agreement with your benevolent cosigner.
Debt and credit problems
When you seek to take out a mortgage, lenders examine your credit history, 
which is detailed in your personal credit report (see Chapter 5 for details on 
credit reports and scores). Lenders also analyze your current debts and lia-
bilities, which you provide on your mortgage application. Your current debts 
and credit history can produce a number of red flags that may make lenders 
skittish about lending you money. This section tells you how to deal with the 
typical problems that concern lenders.

125
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
Credit report boo-boos
As you may know, creditors can report your loan delinquencies and defaults 
to credit bureaus. These blemishes will show up on your personal credit 
report.
 
Here’s our suggested plan of attack for dealing with such problems:
 
✓ Be proactive. If you know that your credit report includes warts and 
imperfections, write a concise letter to the lender explaining why the 
flaws are there. For example, maybe you were late on some of your loan 
payments once because you were out of the country and didn’t get your 
bills processed in time. Or perhaps you lost your job unexpectedly and 
fell behind in your payments until you located new employment.
 
✓ Shop around for understanding and flexible lenders. Some lenders are 
more sympathetic to the fact that you’re human and have sometimes 
erred. As you interview lenders, inquire whether your previous credit 
blemishes may pose a problem. You may also consider enlisting the ser-
vices of a mortgage broker, who may well be more accustomed to deal-
ing with loan problems.
 
✓ Look to the property seller for a loan. Property sellers who are inter-
ested in playing lender can also be flexible. Surprisingly, some won’t 
even check your credit report. Those who check your credit report may 
be more willing than banks and other mortgage lenders to forgive past 
problems, especially if you’re financially healthy and strong today.
 
✓ Fight and correct errors. Credit-reporting agencies and creditors who 
report information to the agencies make mistakes. Unfortunately, in the 
financial world you’re guilty until you can convince the credit agencies 
that you’re innocent. Start by identifying the erroneous information 
on your credit report. Should the erroneous information pertain to an 
account that you never had, tell the credit bureau to examine the possi-
bility that the derogatory information belongs on someone else’s report.
 
 If the bad data is for one of your accounts but a creditor (for example, 
First Usury Bank, from which you obtained an auto loan) has made an 
error, you’ll likely have to hound such a creditor until it instructs the 
credit bureau to fix the mistake. To get these sorts of errors corrected, 
you must be persistent and patient. By law, the credit bureaus are sup-
posed to respond to your inquiry within 30 days. Should you get the 
runaround from the front-line customer-service representatives you 
talk to, ask to speak with a supervisor or manager until you get satisfac-
tion. If that technique doesn’t work, contact your local Better Business 
Bureau (see your local phone directory) and file a complaint. You’re also 
allowed to enter a statement of contention on your credit report so that 
prospective creditors, such as mortgage lenders, that pull your credit 
report can see your side of the story. But your best strategy is to have 
the disparaging information removed from your credit report.

126
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
✓ Get a cosigner. As we suggest earlier, a cosigner, such as a relative, 
can also help deal with credit problems that are knocking out your loan 
application.
 
✓ Save more, and build a better track record. If you can continue to rent, 
buying yourself some more time may do the trick. Why rush buying if 
lenders avoid you like the plague and reject you, or only offer loans with 
ultrahigh interest rates? Spend a couple of years saving more money and 
keeping a clean credit record, and you’ll eventually have lenders chasing 
you for your business!
 
If you’re having problems getting approved, sit down with your loan officer and 
make a list of the items you must rectify to get an approval. Instead of trying to 
guess what’s wrong, you’ll have a checklist of everything you need to correct.
Excess debt
If you’re turned down for a mortgage because of excess debt (such as on 
credit cards and auto loans), be grateful. The lender has actually done you a 
favor! Over the long term, such debt is a serious drag on your ability to save 
money and live within your income.
 
Should you have the cash available to pay off some or all of the debt, we 
emphatically urge you to do so. Mortgage lenders sometimes make this a con-
dition of funding a mortgage, especially when you have significant debts or are 
on the margin of qualifying for the loan that you desire. If you lack sufficient 
cash to pay down the debt and buy the type of home you want, choose among 
the following options:
 
✓ Set your sights more realistically. Buy a less expensive home for which 
you can qualify for a mortgage.
 
✓ Go on a financial diet. Your best bet for getting rid of consumer debt is 
to take a hard look at your spending (see Chapter 2) and identify where 
you can make cuts. Use your savings to pay down the debt. Also explore 
boosting your employment income.
 
✓ Get family help. Another potential option is to have your family help 
you, either by cosigning your loan or by lending or giving you money to 
pay down your high-interest debt.
Lack of down payment
Saving money in America, where everything is considered a necessity at one 
time or another, can be a chore. Should you lack sufficient money for a down 
payment, turn to Chapter 3 for suggestions about how to get financing.

127
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
Dealing with Appraisal Problems
Your loan application may be sailing smoothly through the loan-approval 
channels — thanks to your sterling (or at least acceptable) financial condition — 
and then, all of a sudden (like in a Batman episode):
POW!!! BANG!!! THUMP!!! KABOOM!!!
The property that you’ve fallen in love with isn’t worth what you agreed to 
pay for it, at least according to the appraiser — the person who values prop-
erty for lenders. You may be shocked, dismayed, and perhaps even fright-
ened that the appraiser has given such a low estimate. What course of action 
you should take depends on which of the following three issues caused the 
low appraisal.
You’ve overpaid
Appraisals don’t often come in lower than the contract’s purchase price. 
When they do, more often than not they’re low because you (and perhaps 
your real estate agent) overestimated what the home is worth. If this is the 
Credit (FICO) scores
Lenders generally use a credit-scoring system 
to help them streamline credit application 
processing. The most commonly used credit-
scoring system by mortgage lenders is the FICO 
score. FICO is short for the company that devel-
oped this system — Fair Isaac Corporation.
Higher scores mean that the borrower is far 
more likely to make timely and complete pay-
ments when borrowing money. In other words, 
such borrowers are the types that lenders 
prefer making loans to and are generally said 
to be “low risk.”
Credit scores such as the FICO score are deter-
mined by using information in your credit report. 
Because there are three major credit-rating 
agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion), 
you can have a FICO score from each of their 
reports. (We discuss credit reports and how to 
obtain them for free in Chapter 5.)
In the event that you’re turned down for a 
mortgage or other loan, request a copy of your 
credit report and an explanation from the lender 
for the specific reasons that you were denied 
credit. You can improve your credit score over 
time by addressing lenders’ concerns and by 
using the solutions we present elsewhere in 
this chapter for dealing with common mortgage 
application problems.
The best defense against being turned down is 
to examine, understand, and even improve your 
credit score before applying for a mortgage. 
Please see Chapter 5 for all the details.

128
Par t II: Financing 101 
case, be grateful that the appraiser has provided you a big warning that 
you’re about to throw away money, perhaps thousands of dollars, if you 
go through with paying the price specified in your purchase contract. It’s 
also possible that the appraised value is low because the home needs a new 
roof, new foundation, or other major structural repairs. (We cover property 
inspections in Chapter 13.)
 
Because you obviously like the property (after all, you made an offer to buy it), 
use the appraisal as a tool to either renegotiate a lower purchase price with 
the seller or get a credit from the seller to do necessary repairs. If the seller 
won’t play, move on to other properties. Also reevaluate your agent’s knowl-
edge of property values and motivations — consider finding a new agent if the 
present agent prodded you into overpaying. (We provide guidance on finding 
an outstanding agent in Chapter 9.)
The appraiser doesn’t know your area
If you and your agent know local property values and have seen comparable 
homes that fully justify the price you agreed to pay, it’s possible that the 
appraiser simply doesn’t know local property values. One clue that this is 
the case is if the appraiser doesn’t normally appraise homes in your area. 
Another clue is if the comparable properties that the appraiser chose aren’t 
good, representative comparisons. We get into exactly what is and isn’t a 
comparable property in Chapter 10.
 
If you have reason to believe that the appraiser may be off base, express your 
concern to the mortgage lender that you’re using. Also, request a copy of the 
appraisal, which you’re entitled to. The lender should be able to shed some 
light on the appraiser’s background and experience with valuing homes in your 
area. Sometimes you can have a reappraisal done without an additional charge.
The appraiser/lender is sandbagging you
The least likely explanation for a low appraisal is that your mortgage lender 
may have come in with a low appraisal to get out of doing a loan that she 
feels is undesirable. In the business, this trick is called sandbagging.
Lenders that use in-house appraisals are best able to torpedo loans that they 
don’t want to make. Why, you may reasonably wonder, would lenders sandbag 
you on a loan for which they’ve willingly accepted a loan application? Remember 
that the eager front-line mortgage person at the bank or the mortgage broker 
who placed your loan with the lender likely works on commission and isn’t 
the person who makes mortgage-approval decisions at the lending company.

129
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
 
Should you suspect that your loan is being sandbagged, request a copy of 
your appraisal. If comparable sales data show that the appraisal is low, con-
front your lender on this issue and see what she has to say about it. If you get 
the runaround and no satisfaction, ask for a full refund of your loan applica-
tion and appraisal fees and take your business to another lender. You may 
also consider filing a complaint with the state organization that regulates 
mortgage lenders in your area.
Those Darn Mortgage Forms
When you finally get to the part of your home purchase where you’re apply-
ing for a mortgage, you’re likely to become so sick of paperwork that you’ll 
yearn for a paperless society. You may be interested in knowing that some 
lenders (especially online lenders, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 11) 
are moving to a more computer-driven (and less pen-and-paper-oriented) 
mortgage-application process. No matter; you’re still going to have to provide 
a great deal of personal and financial information.
In this section, we review the forms that you’re commonly asked to complete in 
the mortgage-application process. If you’re working with a skilled person at the 
mortgage lender’s firm or mortgage-brokerage firm that you’ve chosen, that 
person can help you navigate most of this dreaded paperwork.
But we know that you probably have some questions about what kinds of 
information you’re required to provide versus information that you don’t 
have to provide. You also may be uncomfortable revealing certain, how shall 
we say, less-than-flattering facts about your situation — facts that you feel 
may jeopardize your qualifications for a mortgage. Finally, no matter how 
good the mortgage person that you’re working with is, the burden is still on 
you to pull together many facts, figures, and documents. So here we are, right 
by your side, to coach and cajole you along the way.
The laundry list of required documents
Many mortgage lenders provide you an incredibly lengthy list of documents 
that they require with mortgage applications (see Figure 7-1). One quick look 
at the list is enough to make most prospective home buyers continue renting!
But don’t despair. This list must cover all possible situations, so some of the 
items won’t apply to you. We hope, for example, that you’re not simultane-
ously receiving a diploma, divorcing, being relocated by your employer, and 
completing bankruptcy papers!

Par t II: Financing 101 
 
Figure 7-1: 
An example 
of the 
myriad doc-
uments that

lenders ask 
you to fork 
over.
 
Most of the items on this laundry list are required to prove and substanti-
ate your current financial status to the mortgage lender and, subsequently, 
to other organizations that may buy your loan in the future. Pay stubs, tax 
returns, and bank and investment-account statements help document your 
income and assets. Lenders assess the risk of lending you money and deter-
mine how much they can lend you based on these items.

131
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
If you’re wondering why lenders can’t take you on your word about the per-
sonal and confidential financial facts and figures, remember that some people 
don’t tell the truth. Even though we know that you’re an honest person, lend-
ers have no way of knowing who’s honest and who isn’t. The unfortunate 
consequence is that lenders have to treat all their applicants as though they 
aren’t honest.
Even though lenders require all this documentation, some buyers still falsify 
information. Worse yet, some mortgage brokers, in their quest to close more 
loans and earn more commissions, even coach buyers to lie to qualify for a 
loan. One example of how people cheat: Some self-employed people create 
bogus tax returns with inflated incomes. Although a few people have gotten 
away with such deception, we strongly discourage this wayward path — it’s 
fraudulent.
 
Falsifying loan documents is committing perjury and fraud and isn’t in your 
best interests. Besides the obvious legal objections, you can end up with more 
mortgage debt than you can really afford. Plus, mortgage lenders can catch 
you in your lies. How? Well, some mortgage lenders have you sign a docu-
ment (at the time you close on your home purchase or at the time of your loan 
application) that allows them to request directly from the IRS a copy of the 
actual return you filed with the IRS. Form 4506 grants the lender permission to 
get a copy of your tax return. Another document that the lender may spring 
on you is Form 8821, which asks the IRS to confirm specific information and 
is more likely to be sent in by a lender to verify your financial information as 
reported for tax purposes (see Figure 7-2). You typically get these documents 
at closing. You can refuse to sign them — but then again, the lender can refuse 
to make you a loan!
When you can’t qualify for a desired mortgage without resorting to trickery, 
getting turned down is for your own good. Lenders have criteria to ensure 
that you’ll be able to repay the money that you borrow and that you don’t get 
in over your head.
Permissions to inspect your finances
In order for a mortgage lender to make a proper assessment of your cur-
rent financial situation, the lender needs to request detailed documentation. 
Thus, mortgage lenders or brokers ask you to sign a form (like the one shown 
in Figure 7-3) authorizing and permitting them to make such requests of your 
employer, the financial institutions that you do business with, and so on.

Tip: You may be able to get your tax return or return information from other sources. If you had your tax return completed by a paid preparer, they 
should be able to provide you a copy of the return. The IRS can provide a Tax Return Transcript for many returns free of charge. The transcript
provides most of the line entries from the tax return and usually contains the information that a third party (such as a mortgage company) requires. 
See Form 4506-T, Request for Transcript of Tax Return, or you can call 1-800-829-1040 to order a transcript.

Figure 7-3: 
This type of 
form grants 
permission 
to your 
mortgage 
lender or 
broker to 
verify and 
document 
the financial 
facts of 
your life.
 
 
As we recommend in numerous places throughout this book, before you agree 
to do business with a lender, you should get, in writing, the lender’s estimate 
of what your out-of-pocket expenditures will be in order to close on your 
home loan. The good news for you is that lenders are required by law to pro-
vide, within three days of your application, what’s called a Good Faith Estimate 
of closing costs after you initiate a mortgage with them (see Figure 7-4).
The Uniform Residential Loan Application
This is the big enchilada, the whole cannoli, or whatever you want to call it. 
Mortgage lenders and brokers throughout this vast country use the Uniform 
Residential Loan Application to collect vital data about home purchases and 
proposed loans. Many lenders use this standardized document, known in the 
mortgage trade as Form 1003, because they sell their mortgages to investors.

134
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
Figure 7-4: 
Here’s an 
estimated 
closing 
costs 
worksheet.
 

135
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
Some mortgage lenders may toss you a Form 1003 and expect you to return 
it to them completed. Other lenders and brokers help you fill out the form or 
even go so far as to complete it all for you.
 
If you let someone fill out the Uniform Residential Loan Application on your 
behalf, know that you’re still responsible that the information on the form is 
accurate and truthful. Also, be aware that in their sales efforts, some mort-
gage lenders and brokers may invite you to their offices or invite themselves 
to your home or office to complete this form for you or with you. Although 
we have no problem with good service, we do want you to keep in mind that 
you’re not beholden or obligated to any lenders or brokers, even if they offer 
to come over and wash your car and provide you a pedicure! It’s your money 
and your home purchase, so shop around for a good loan or mortgage broker. 
(Also, keep a copy of all the forms you complete for one mortgage lender to 
save time should you decide to apply to another lender.)
If, like most people, you take the first whack at completing this form your-
self, we trust that you’ll find the upcoming sections (in which we walk you 
through the major items on this application) useful.
I. Type of mortgage and terms of loan
The main items of concern to you in the first section of the application (see 
Figure 7-5) are the loan amount (Amount), Interest Rate, length of the loan 
(No. of Months), and the loan type (fixed rate or ARM). At the time that you’re 
applying for your mortgage, if you’re unsure as to some of these options and 
what you’re going to choose, simply leave the relevant spaces blank.

Don’t fill in these boxes!
II. Property information and purpose of loan
Your mortgage lender is curious about why you want to borrow the vast sum 
of money that you list in Part I — hence, Part II (see Figure 7-6). In addition to 
wanting to know the property’s address, the lender wants to know the prop-
erty’s legal description. The Legal Description of Subject Property simply means 
the property’s block and lot number, which come from the preliminary title 
report. Your real estate agent, your mortgage lender, and you should each 
have copies of this report soon after you have a signed purchase agreement.

Complete this line if this is a refinance loan. 
The information you include in the Purpose of Loan section tells the lender 
whether you plan to use the mortgage to buy a home, refinance an existing 
loan, or build a new home (Construction). The lender also wants to know 
whether the property is your primary or secondary residence, or an investment 
property. Your answers to these questions determine which loans your property 
is eligible for and the terms of the loans. From a lender’s perspective, construc-
tion loans and investment-property loans are riskier than other loans and 
generally carry higher interest rates.
 
You may be tempted (and some mortgage brokers have been, as well) to lie 
on this part of the mortgage application to obtain more favorable loan terms. 
Be aware that lenders can — and sometimes do — challenge you to prove that 
you’re going to live in the property if they suspect otherwise. Even after clos-
ing on a purchase and their loan, lenders have been known to ask for proof 
that the borrower is living in the property. They may ask you for utility bills 
(to see whether the bills are in your name), and some lenders have even been 
known to send a representative around to knock on the borrower’s doors to 
see who’s living in the home!

137
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
At the time that you apply for your mortgage, you must declare how you’ll 
hold title to the property — in other words, how the ownership of the home 
will be structured for legal purposes. We cover this important decision in 
Chapter 14.
Mortgage lenders also like to know where your down payment and closing 
costs are coming from to ensure that this money isn’t yet another loan that 
may burden your ability to repay the money they’re lending you. Ideally, 
lenders want to see the down payment and closing costs coming from your 
personal savings. Tell the truth — lenders have many ways to trip you up in 
your lies here. They may ask to see the last several months of your bank or 
investment-account statements to verify that, for example, a relative didn’t 
recently give you the money.
III. Borrower information
The third part of the Uniform Residential Loan Application (see Figure 7-7) is 
where you get to inscribe your name, rank, and serial number. When you’re 
buying the property with someone else, such as your spouse, you have the 
added thrill of providing information about the other person, as well.

Part III says, 
“So tell me 
about your-
self . . . .”

Yrs. School 
Mailing Address, if different from Present Address 
Yrs. School simply means how many total years of formal schooling you have 
under your belt. If you graduated from high school, you’ve had 12 years of 
schooling. Two- or four-year colleges add that many years on top of the 12. If 
you were silly enough to go to graduate school, add the number of years that 
you spent toiling away for those additional scraps of paper to hang on your 
office or den wall.
The lender also wants to know where you’ve been living recently. (In addi-
tion, the company needs to know if your mailing address differs from your 
home address.)

138
Par t II: Financing 101 
Lenders are looking for some stability here. Most lenders also request a letter 
from your landlord to verify that you pay rent on time. If you’ve moved fre-
quently in recent years, most lenders check with more than your most recent 
landlord. If your application is borderline, good references can tip the scales 
in your favor. If you’ve paid what you owed, and you’ve paid on time, you have 
nothing to worry about. If you haven’t, you should explain yourself, either by 
separate letter to the lender or in the blank space on page 4 of the application.
IV. Employment information
Just as mortgage lenders want to know your recent residences, they want to 
know your recent work history (see Figure 7-8). If you’ve been in one posi-
tion for at least the past two years, that’s the only position you need to list. 
Otherwise, you must list your prior employment to cover the past two-year 
period. Again, the lender is looking for stability, which can help push a mar-
ginal application through the loan-approval channels.

If you’re a detail kind of person, you may be wondering why the application 
asks for the monthly income from prior jobs but not your current one. The 
reason is that you provide the monthly income for your current position in 
the next section (Part V) of the application.
You may also wonder (and be concerned about) why the lender wants your 
current and previous employers’ phone numbers. Shortly before your loan 
is ready to close, the lender may call your current employer to verify that 
you’re still employed, but verification of employment is usually done by mail. 
It’s highly unlikely that the lender will call your previous employers.

139
 Chapter 7: Mor tgage Quandaries, Conundrums, and Paperwork
V. Monthly income and housing expense projections
Part V (see Figure 7-9) makes or breaks many a mortgage application. Here, 
you list your monthly income, including that derived from investments such 
as bank, brokerage, and mutual fund accounts. Most people’s employment is 
what qualifies them to borrow money via a mortgage. If your income fluctuates 
from month to month, simply enter your average monthly income over the 
past 12 months. (Some lenders use a 24-month average if you’re 
self-employed.)

Should you leave a short-term residence or 
job off your application?
Some people who prepare resumes decide to 
omit positions that they’ve held for only a short 
period of time. The reasons vary, but most 
people do it to make their resumes look stronger 
and to avoid being perceived as job hoppers.
When you’ve had gaps in employment, it’s 
better to show the gap than to be caught with 
your hand in the cookie jar — lenders often 
ask for the dates of your employment. Don’t lie; 
lenders who catch you in one lie will scrutinize 
your loan application twice as carefully, looking 
for more inconsistencies. Lenders don’t mind 
some job hopping.
Another section of the verification-of-
employment request, which your current 
employer receives from the lender, asks what 
your prospects are for continued employment. 
The answer to that question is important, too.
In a sense, a mortgage application is like a 
resume. You want to present your information 
in its most positive, yet truthful, light.

140
Par t II: Financing 101 
 
Net Rental Income refers to the difference between your rental real estate’s 
monthly rents and expenses (excluding depreciation). Rental property is 
property that you’ve bought for the purpose of renting it out. Therefore, Net 
Rental Income is the profit or loss that you make each month on rental prop-
erty (excluding depreciation) that you own. If you’ve recently purchased the 
rental property, the lender counts only 75 percent of the current rent that 
you’re collecting. When you’ve held your rental property long enough to com-
plete a tax return, most lenders use the profit or loss (excluding depreciation) 
reported on your tax return.
Should you have other income sources, such as child support or alimony, list 
them on the Other line, and describe them in the last portion of this section. 
The more income you can list, the better equipped you are to qualify for a 
mortgage with the most favorable terms for you.
The Combined Monthly Housing Expense area on the right side of this sec-
tion enables you to tally up your current and proposed housing expenses. 
If you’re currently renting, simply enter your rent in the relevant box. Your 
proposed expenses refer to what your estimated expenses would be with the 
purchase of the home that you’re expecting to buy. Your mortgage lender or 
broker can help you complete this important section.
 
If you’re stretching to buy, make sure that the estimates that your lender or 
broker plugs into the estimated-housing-expense section are reasonable and 
not inflated. In their efforts to cover their own behinds and to ensure that 
you don’t get in over your head, some mortgage lenders make estimates that 
are too high. If, for example, the mortgage lender estimates that homeowners 
insurance will cost you $100 per month but you already have a quote in hand 
for good coverage at $80 per month, speak up about the discrepancy.
Should you be precariously balanced on the borderline between qualifying 
and not qualifying for a loan, lenders will be less inclined to approve your loan 
if a big difference exists between your current housing expenses and your 
proposed expenses as a homeowner. Lenders and mortgage brokers refer to 
people in this situation as subjecting themselves to payment shock. If you’re in 
this situation, you should assess whether you can really afford that significant 
an increase in your monthly housing expenses (see Chapters 2 and 3).
VI. Assets and liabilities
In Part VI (see Figure 7-10), you present your personal balance sheet, which 
summarizes your assets and liabilities. Your assets are subdivided into liquid 
(for example, non-retirement account) assets and those assets that aren’t 
liquid (such as real estate). Liquid, in this example, simply means those 
assets that you can sell quickly to come up with cold, hard cash for a home 
purchase or some other purpose.

VI. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
This Statement and any applicable supporting schedules may be completed jointly by both married and unmarried Co-Borrowers if their assets and liabilities are sufficiently joined so that the Statement  
can be meaningfully and fairly presented on a combined basis; otherwise, separate Statements and Schedules are required. If the Co-Borrower section was completed about a non-applicant spouse or other  
person, this Statement and supporting schedules must be completed about that spouse or other person also.

Why so many spaces are allotted to checking and savings accounts puzzles us. 
If you can’t squeeze your other non-retirement holdings in brokerage accounts 
or mutual funds into the small space provided for Stocks & Bonds, use the 
extra bank-account lines, and explain what you’re listing there.
Liabilities are any loans or debts you have outstanding. The more such obli-
gations you have, the more reluctant a mortgage lender will be to lend you a 
large amount of money.
 
When you have the cash available to pay off high-cost consumer loans such 
as credit card loans and auto loans, consider doing so now. (If you opted for 
loan prequalification or preapproval, as we discuss in Chapter 6, the lender 
likely recommended getting rid of these consumer debts at that time.) Such 
debts generally carry high interest rates that aren’t tax-deductible, and they 
hurt your chances of qualifying for a mortgage (see Chapter 3 for an 
explanation of this matter).
Note (at the bottom of the liability column) that you are to list child sup-
port and alimony payments that you make, as well as out-of-pocket expenses 
related to your job if you aren’t self-employed. Such monthly expenses are 
like debts in the sense that they require monthly feeding.
Part VI continues onto page 3 and includes space for the details of rental real 
estate you already own. If you make a profit from such holdings, that profit 
can help your chances of qualifying for other mortgages. Conversely, negative 
cash flow (property expenses exceeding income) from rentals reduces the 
amount that a mortgage lender will lend you. Most mortgage lenders want a 
copy of your tax return (and possibly copies of your rental agreements with 
tenants) to substantiate the information you put in this space.
VII. Details of transaction
In Part VII (see Figure 7-11), you detail the terms of your proposed home 
purchase. The purpose of this section’s first part is to total the home’s cost, 
including closing costs. After subtracting the expected loan amount, this 
column arrives at how much money you need to come up with to close on 
the home purchase. Some prospective buyers find that after they’ve success-
fully completed this section, they must go begging to family or borrow more 
money to close on the purchase.
VIII. Declarations
Part VIII (shown in Figure 7-12) shouldn’t be called Declarations; it should be 
called Personal Interrogation!

X. INFORMATION FOR GOVERNMENT MONITORING PURPOSES 
The following information is requested by the Federal Government for certain types of loans related to a dwelling in order to monitor the lender's compliance with equal credit opportunity, fair housing  
and home mortgage disclosure laws. You are not required to furnish this information, but are encouraged to do so. The law provides that a lender may not discriminate either on the basis of this information,  
or on whether you choose to furnish it. If you furnish the information, please provide both ethnicity and race. For race, you may check more than one designation. If you do not furnish ethnicity, race,  
or sex, under Federal regulations, this lender is required to note the information on the basis of visual observation and surname if you have made this application in person. If you do not wish to furnish the  
information, please check the box below. (Lender must review the above material to assure that the disclosures satisfy all requirements to which the lender is subject under applicable state law for the  
particular type of loan applied for.)

Actually, if you don’t have anything to put on page 4, you should draw a diagonal 
line across it so the lender knows that you saw it and have nothing to say. Be 
sure to sign at the bottom of this last page as well, even if you don’t write any-
thing on it. Many people don’t sign — and no wonder, with the Grand Canyon 
of space between the top of this page and the signature line at the bottom!
Other typical documents
All mortgage lenders and brokers have their own, individualized package of 
documents for you to complete. Some documents are standard because they 
are federally mandated. Covering all these forms here is certainly beyond 
the scope of this book — and most people’s attention span. What follows are 
some of the other common forms that you’re likely to encounter from your 
mortgage lender or broker.
Your right to receive a copy of appraisal
It wasn’t always the case, but you now have the right to receive a copy of the 
appraisal report. That borrowers didn’t always have this right is a bit absurd — 
after all, you’re the one who’s paying for the appraisal!
To make sure you know that you have this right, the government requires that 
mortgage lenders and brokers present you with the document in Figure 7-15.
 
Despite the fact that the notice tells you to make your request in writing, try 
making the request verbally to save yourself time. Then, if your request is 
ignored, go to the hassle of submitting a written request for your appraisal 
(within 90 days of the rendering of a decision to approve or reject your loan). 
Appraisals are good to have in your files — you never know when an appraisal 
may come in handy. At the very least, you can see what properties were used 
as comparables to yours in order to discover how good or bad the appraisal is.

146

Equal Credit Opportunity Act
Another form you’ll probably see is one that discloses that it’s a matter of 
federal law that a mortgage lender may not reject your loan because of any 
nonfinancial personal characteristic, such as race, sex, marital status, age, 
and so forth. You also don’t have to disclose income that you receive as a 
result of being divorced (although we think that doing so is in your best inter-
est because such income may help get your loan approved).
 
If you have reason to believe that a mortgage lender is discriminating against 
you, contact and file a complaint with your state’s department of real estate 
or the government division that regulates mortgage lenders in your state. And 
start hunting around for a better, more ethical lender.

may hire to help you buy a home. In addition to steering 
you toward winning strategies and winning players, 
we help you avoid loser properties and, well, losers in 
general. We provide a crash course on how to distinguish 
good buys from overpriced turkeys so that you won’t

W
hat’s your idea of the perfect car, the perfect job, and the perfect way 
to spend a day? Would you have said the same things ten years ago? 
Probably not. Perfection is a moving target — it changes as you change.
Where the perfect home is concerned, there’s no such thing. For one thing, 
few people have the financial resources to afford what they think is the per-
fect home. Even if you’re among the fortunate few with bucks to burn, it’s still 
highly unlikely that one home will be perfect for you from birth to earth. The 
home that’s great in your 20s when you’re footloose and fancy-free probably 
won’t cut it when you’re in your 40s if you’re married or raising a family. Fast-
forward another 20 years to when you’re nearing retirement. You may want 
or need to move to a smaller home that’s easier to maintain.
Don’t fret. Even though no single home stays perfect forever, this chapter 
shows you how to profitably achieve sequential perfection in your homes. 
And because moving is expensive, we also show you how to minimize the 
number of times you buy and sell.
You probably know someone who’s lost money on a house sale. We’re sure 
that you don’t plan to be the next victim of a capricious real estate market 
such as the one that hit during the late-2000s. Getting a bargain when you 
buy a home is a fine objective, but don’t stop there. Don’t you also want your 
home to appreciate in value while you own it?
 
The best time to think about how much you’ll get for your house when you sell 
it is before you buy it. Never let your enthusiasm for a house blind you to its 
flaws. Before you buy, try to look at the property through the eyes of the next 
potential buyer. Anything that disturbs you about the house or neighborhood 
will probably also bother the next buyer.

150
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
We’re not suggesting that you should plan to sell your house immediately 
after buying it. For all we know, you’ll live happily ever after in the home 
you’re about to purchase. Then again, an unforeseen life change, such as 
a job transfer or family expansion, may force you to sell. If that happens, 
making a nice profit can take some of the sting out of moving day.
Appreciation is handy for a lot more than just increasing your net worth. 
Given that your home increases in value over time, you may someday find 
that this equity (the difference between market value and the mortgage you 
owe) can help you accomplish a multitude of important financial and per-
sonal goals. You can use the money any way you want — add to your retire-
ment, help pay your kids’ college education, start your own business, or take 
the Orient Express from London to Venice to celebrate your 25th wedding 
anniversary. Nest eggs are extremely versatile financial tools — and they’re 
cholesterol free!
In a world filled with uncertainties, no one can guarantee that your home will 
increase in value. However, buying a good property in a desirable neighbor-
hood tremendously increases your odds of making money. This maxim holds 
true whether the real estate market is strong or weak when you sell.
Property prices aren’t static. They rise and fall because of such factors as the 
local job market, the supply of and demand for available housing and rental 
units, interest rates, and annual cycles of strong versus weak market activ-
ity. (For more on this subject, turn to Chapter 4.) Most of these things are 
beyond your control and ability to predict. But this doesn’t mean that your 
financial destiny as a homeowner is a total fluke of fate. On the contrary, you 
control three important factors that greatly affect your home’s value:
 
✓ How much you pay for your home
 
✓ Where your home is located
 
✓ What home you buy
 
The number-one controllable factor is how much you pay for your home. If 
you grossly overpay for your house when you buy it, you’ll be extremely lucky 
to make a profit when you sell. That’s why we devote Chapter 10 to making 
sure that you know exactly how to spot well-priced properties and avoid over-
priced turkeys.
This chapter focuses on the other two crucial factors under your control: 
where and what you buy.

151
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
Location, Location, Value
If you’re wildly wealthy, you can afford to live anywhere you darn well please. 
The rest of us, however, have somewhat more limited budgets. Even so, 
unless you’re foraging at the bottom of the housing food chain, you have 
many choices on places to spend your money. Where you ultimately decide 
to buy is up to you.
You’ve probably already heard that the three most important things you 
should look for when buying a home are “location, location, location.” 
That axiom is largely true. People buy neighborhoods every bit as much as 
houses. In good times and bad, folks pay a premium to live in better neigh-
borhoods. Conversely, rotten neighborhoods ravage home values. You’d 
have trouble selling the Taj Mahal if it were surrounded by junkyards and 
chicken farms.
But simply stating that the secret of making money in real estate when you 
buy is “location, location, location” is akin to saying you’ll make a fortune in 
the stock market if you buy low and sell high. It takes more than glittering 
generalities to make money. You need specifics.
First off, we don’t agree that the three most important factors are location, 
location, location. Besides, we don’t see much point in repeating ourselves 
three times — it’s not like you’re a complete idiot or something! Value — 
what you get for your money — is important too.
If, for example, everyone knows that Elegant Estates is the best neighbor-
hood in town, you’ll pay a hefty premium to live there. And although Elegant 
Estates is currently king of the hill and may stay that way forever, keep in 
mind that this particular neighborhood has no place to go except downhill.
Other neighborhoods, ones that aren’t held in such high esteem right now, 
may eventually improve what they offer home buyers and ultimately experi-
ence far greater property-value appreciation. Buying a home in a good loca-
tion, though important, shouldn’t be your sole home-shopping criterion. If 
you want to buy a home that is a good investment, you must look for good 
value. We explain how to do that in this chapter.
Characteristics of good neighborhoods
Good neighborhoods, like beauty, are in the eyes of the beholder. For exam-
ple, being near excellent schools is important if you have young children. 

152
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
If, conversely, you’re ready to retire, buying in a peaceful area with outdoor 
activities may appeal to you, and being next to a noisy junior high school is 
your nightmare! Neither neighborhood may suit you if you’re the footloose 
and fancy-free type. Your ideal neighborhood is probably a singles’ condo 
complex downtown so you can be near the action day or night.
Personal preferences aside, all good neighborhoods have the following 
characteristics:
 
✓ Economic health: Nothing kills property values faster than a forest of 
“For Sale” signs precipitated by corporate layoffs or foreclosures. See 
Chapter 4 for ways to evaluate the employers and job markets in the 
various communities where you’re contemplating buying a home.
 
✓ Amenities: Amenities are special features of a neighborhood that make 
it an attractive, desirable place to live. Wide streets bordered by stately 
oak trees, lush green parks, ocean views, quiet cul-de-sacs, parking, and 
proximity to schools, churches, shopping, restaurants, transportation, 
playgrounds, tennis courts, and beaches are prime examples of ameni-
ties that add value to a neighborhood. Of course, few people can afford 
to buy in a neighborhood that has all these amenities, but the more of 
these perks a neighborhood has, the better.
 
✓ Quality schools: You may not care how good or bad the local schools 
are if you don’t have school-age children. However, unless you’re buying 
in a remote, retirement, or vacation-type community, you had better 
believe that when you’re ready to sell your house, most prospective 
buyers with kids will be deeply concerned about the school system. But 
you should care about the quality of nearby schools for more than just 
resale value, because good schools produce better kids, and that clearly 
affects the quality of life in the community.
 
 Don’t rely on test scores or someone’s opinion when assessing school 
quality; visit the schools and speak with parents and teachers to get a 
handle on the schools in an area.
 
✓ Low crime rates: Most folks today are concerned with crime — and well 
they should be, given that crime rates in many parts of America are too 
high. As with schools, don’t rely on hearsay or isolated news reports. 
Communities compile crime statistics, generally by neighborhood. Call 
the local police department, visit its Web site, or check the town’s refer-
ence library to get the facts.
 
✓ Stability: Some communities are in a constant state of flux. “Out with 
the old and in with the new” is their motto. Imagine what would happen 
to property values if a junkyard were replaced by a beautiful park. 
How about the reverse — an ugly, multistory, concrete parking garage 
appears where there was once a beautiful park? Check with the local 
planning department and a good real estate agent for the inside scoop 
on proposed developments in neighborhoods that you’re considering.

153
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
✓ Pride of ownership: A home’s cost has no bearing on the amount of pride 
its owners take in it. Drive through any neighborhood, posh or modest, 
and you see in a flash whether the folks who live there are proud of their 
homes. A neighborhood filled with beautifully maintained homes and 
manicured lawns shouts pride of ownership.
 
 Property values sag when homeowners no longer take pride in their prop-
erty. Avoid declining neighborhoods that display the red flags of dispirited 
owners — poorly kept houses, junk-filled yards, abandoned cars on the 
street, many absentee owners renting houses, and high rates of vandal-
ism, crime, and foreclosures. Neighborhood deterioration is a blight that 
spreads from one house to another.
Selecting your best neighborhood
You may get lucky and find the neighborhood of your dreams right away. 
You’re far more likely, however, to end up evaluating the strengths and weak-
nesses of several neighborhoods while trying to decide which one to favor 
with your purchase. If you’re on a budget — and most people are — you may 
have to compromise and make tradeoffs.
Suppose that one neighborhood has the schools you like, the second is clos-
est to your office (which would save you an hour a day commuting), and the 
third neighborhood is in a town with a delightful beach. They’re all good 
neighborhoods, so your decision isn’t easy
 
Following are ways to research and select the best neighborhood for you.
Prioritize your needs
Buying a home when you have budgetary constraints involves making 
tradeoffs. For example, if you want to live in the town with great schools and 
parks, you’ll probably have to settle for a smaller home than you would if you 
bought in a more average community. When push comes to shove and you 
have to choose a place to live, you must decide what is most important to you.
Research
As we say earlier in this chapter, in the section “Characteristics of good 
neighborhoods,” you should examine the health of the local economy, area 
amenities such as parks and entertainment, school quality, and crime rates 
before you buy a home. So where can you find this wealth of information?
 
✓ Tap local resources. Check the local library. The local chamber of 
commerce is another excellent source of information.

154
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
✓ Talk to people who live in the neighborhoods. Who knows more about 
a neighborhood than folks who live in it? In addition to asking how they 
feel about their neighborhood, see what residents say about the other 
neighborhoods you’re considering. If you can spark some neighborhood 
rivalry, you’ll get the dirt about the other neighborhoods’ lousy weather, 
parking problems, unfriendly or snobby owners, and so on. Renters are 
also a great source of information. Because they don’t have a wad of 
cash invested in a home, renters are generally candid about the short-
comings of a neighborhood. Last but not least, drive or walk through 
the neighborhoods at various times of the day and evening to make sure 
that their charm stays on 24 hours a day.
 
✓ Get days-on-market (DOM) statistics from your real estate agent. DOM 
statistics indicate how long the average house in an area takes to sell 
after it goes on the market. As a rule, the faster property sells, the more 
likely it is to sell close to full asking price. Quick sales indicate strong 
buyer demand, which is nice to have when you’re ready to sell.
 
✓ Get help from a professional. Ask a real estate agent, lender, or 
appraiser to compare the upside potential of home values in each neigh-
borhood. As Chapter 9 explains, home buying is a team sport. Get an 
analysis of each neighborhood’s present and future property values 
from full-time real estate people.
 
 Neither real estate agents nor lenders charge for opinions of value. 
They both, however, have a vested interest in selling you something. 
Appraisers, on the other hand, have no ax to grind. True, appraisers 
charge to analyze neighborhood property values and pricing trends. But 
if you’re going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a home, 
paying an additional few hundred dollars to get an unbiased, profes-
sional analysis of a neighborhood’s property values may be money well 
spent.
 
✓ Go online. Several real estate Web sites provide local community data 
and information. See Chapter 11 for recommended sites and surfing 
strategies.
Fundamental Principles for 
Selecting Your Home
Good news. It doesn’t matter whether you buy a log cabin, Cape Cod colo-
nial, French provincial, Queen Anne Victorian, or California ranch–style 
house. You can make money on any property by following three fundamental 
principles to select the home you buy. As you read the following guidelines, 
remember that they’re not hard-and-fast rules — exceptions do exist.

An appraiser can tell you that the principle of progression states that property 
of lesser value is enhanced by proximity to better properties. English transla-
tion, please? Buy one of the cheaper homes on the block, because the more 
expensive houses all around yours pull up the value of your home.
For instance, suppose that your agent shows you a house that just came on the 
market in a neighborhood you like. At $175,000, it’s one of the least expensive 
homes you’ve seen in the area. The agent says that the other homes around it 
sell for anywhere from $225,000 to $275,000. You start to salivate.
 
Don’t whip out your checkbook yet. Do a little homework first. Find out why 
this house is so cheap. If the right things are wrong with it, write up the offer. 
If the wrong things are wrong with it, move on to the next property.
Curable defects
If a house is a bargain because it has defects that aren’t too difficult or expen-
sive to correct, go for it. For example, maybe the house is an ugly duckling 
that just needs a paint job, landscaping, and some other minor cosmetic 
touches in order to be transformed into a swan. Perhaps it’s the only two-
bedroom house on the block, but it has a large storage area that you can con-
vert into a third bedroom for not more than $15,000. For $190,000 ($175,000 
for the house plus $15,000 to add the bedroom), you’re living in a $225,000 to 
$275,000 neighborhood. Such a deal!
Problems like these are curable defects — property deficiencies you can cure 
by upgrading, repairing, or replacing the defects relatively inexpensively. 
Painting, modernizing a bathroom, installing new counters and cabinets in 
the kitchen, and upgrading an electrical system are some examples of curable 
defects.
Incurable defects
 
If a house has major problems, it’s not a bargain at any price. Who’d want a 
house located next to a garbage dump? Or what about a really ugly home? Just 
because the seller made a fortune in the sausage business doesn’t mean that 
you (or anyone else) would want to live in a house built in the shape of a giant 
hot dog. Maybe the house is cheap because a contractor says it’s a wreck 
about ready to fall down, and you’d have to spend at least $125,000 on a new 
roof, a new foundation, new plumbing, and complete rewiring.

156
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Enormous deficiencies like these are called incurable defects. They aren’t 
economically feasible to correct. You can’t fix the fact that a house is poorly 
located. Nor does it typically make sense to pay $175,000 for the hot-dog 
house so you can tear it down and build a new home (unless that’s what com-
parable vacant lots sell for). By the same token, if you pay $175,000 for the 
wreck and then pour in another $125,000 on corrective work, you’ll have the 
dubious honor of owning the most expensive house in the neighborhood.
Don’t get us wrong. All rehabs aren’t bad. We go into more detail about fixer-
uppers later in this chapter.
The benefits of renovating cheaper homes
The less expensive houses on the block are also the least risky ones to reno-
vate, thanks to the principle of progression. For example, suppose that you just 
paid $175,000 for a house that needs a major rehab. Your construction project 
is located smack-dab in the middle of a neighborhood of $250,000 homes.
 
The difference between your purchase price and the value of the surrounding 
homes approximately defines the most you should consider spending on a 
rehab.
In the preceding example, you should spend no more than $75,000 to bring 
your home up to the prevailing standard set by the other houses. Of course, 
this is assuming that you can afford to spend that kind of money (see Chapter 
2) and that you have the time and patience to coordinate the rehab work or 
do it yourself. As long as you improve the property wisely and stay within 
your budget, you’ll probably get most or all the rehab money back when you 
sell the property.
Use the principle of progression in conjunction with location, location, value. 
Buying one of the better less-expensive homes in a good neighborhood 
enhances your likelihood of property appreciation in the years ahead.
The principle of regression: Why not to 
buy the most expensive house on the block
You guessed it. The principle of regression is the economic opposite of the 
principle of progression.
If you buy the most expensive house on the block, the principle of regression 
punishes you when you sell. The lower value of all the other homes around 
you brings down your home’s value.

157
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
If an evil spirit whispers in your ear that you should buy the most expensive 
house on the block to flaunt your high status in life, go to an exorcist immedi-
ately. Don’t succumb to the blandishments of the evil spirit unless the prob-
ability of losing money when you sell fills you with joy. Satisfy your ego — and 
make a wiser investment — by purchasing one of the less expensive homes in 
a better neighborhood.
The most expensive house on the block is also the worst candidate for 
remodeling. Suppose that you buy a $250,000 home in a neighborhood of 
$150,000 houses. From an appraiser’s perspective, the home already sticks 
out like a financial sore thumb. Spending another $50,000 to add a fancy new 
kitchen to what is already the most expensive house on the block further 
compounds your problem.
That new kitchen almost certainly won’t increase your home’s value to 
$300,000. No one can dispute the fact that you spent $50,000 on the kitchen 
if you have the receipts to prove your expenditures. But folks who buy 
$300,000 homes generally want to be surrounded by other homes worth as 
much as, or more than, the one they’re buying.
Homes are like cups. When you fill a cup too full, it overflows. By the same 
token, when you make excessive improvements to your house (based on sale 
prices of comparable homes in the neighborhood), the money you spend on 
the rehab goes down the financial drain. This phenomenon is called overim-
proving a property.
Even if you buy the least expensive house in the neighborhood, you can over-
improve it if you spend too much fixing it up. The best time to guard against 
overimproving your house is before you do the work.
 
If you’ll end up with the most expensive house on the block when you finish a 
project, don’t do the project.
The principle of conformity: Why 
unusual is usually costly
The principles of progression and regression deal with economic conformity. 
If you want to maximize your chances for future appreciation of the home 
you buy, your home should also conform in size, age, condition, and style to 
the other homes in your neighborhood. That’s the principle of conformity.
This principle doesn’t mean that your home has to be an identical clone of 
every other house on the block. It should, however, stay within the prevailing 
standards of your neighborhood. For example:

158
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
✓ Size: Your home shouldn’t dwarf the other houses on the block, or 
vice versa. If your home is smaller than surrounding houses, use the 
principle of progression as a guide to bring it into size-conformity with 
the other houses and you increase your home’s value. If, conversely, 
you have a three-bedroom home in a neighborhood of two- and three-
bedroom homes, adding a large fourth bedroom to your house would 
violate the principle of regression.
 
✓ Age: You almost never see an older home in the midst of a tract 
of modern new homes. However, every now and then you find a brand-
new home incongruously plunked in the midst of older homes. A 
modern home typically looks out of place in a neighborhood of gracious, 
older homes. Even if you get a terrific deal on the price, the modern 
home’s lack of conformity with other homes on the block will probably 
come back to haunt you when you attempt to sell it.
 
✓ Condition: The physical condition of your house has a tremendous 
impact on its value. Not surprisingly, your home loses value if it’s a 
dilapidated dump compared with the rest of the houses on the block.
 
 Ironically, having your home in far nicer condition than other houses in 
the neighborhood isn’t wise either. Even if your home conforms to all 
the other houses in size, age, and style, you still overimprove your home 
if the quality of materials, workmanship, and appliances in your home 
greatly exceeds the prevailing neighborhood quality standards.
 
✓ Style: The architectural style of the house you buy isn’t critical — as 
long as it conforms to the prevailing architectural style of other homes 
in the neighborhood. From an investment standpoint, for example, you 
don’t want to buy the only Queen Anne Victorian in a block filled with 
Pennsylvania Dutch Colonial houses, or vice versa. Nor should you buy 
a three-story home when all the surrounding houses are one story high.
 
Your home doesn’t have to be a bland, boring replica of every other house on 
the block. You can follow the principle of conformity and still express your 
individuality by the way you landscape, paint, and furnish your home. You 
know you’ve done well when people use words like “tasteful” and “exquisite” 
to describe your home. On the other hand, your decorating motif is a problem 
if folks refer to your house as “weird” or “eccentric.”
Defining Home Sweet Home
What exactly is a home? When you come right down to it, home is an elusive 
concept. Everyone knows, for example, that home is where the heart is. That’s 
fine and good if you’re a romantic but not too helpful if you’re a home buyer.

159
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
Up until now, we’ve loosely used the terms “home” and “house” to mean any 
place where you live or want to live. Under that definition, everything from a 
studio apartment in Manhattan to a grass hut on a Hawaiian beach qualifies 
as a home. Now, however, precision matters. We’re about to focus on the 
specific types of property you’re most likely to buy: detached homes, con-
dominiums, and cooperative apartments. Each of these options offers home-
owners distinct financial and personal advantages and disadvantages that 
you must understand to make a wise buying decision.
Detached residences
If you were raised in a big city, your mental image of home is probably an 
apartment in a multistory steel-and-concrete building, an attached brownstone, 
or some other type of row house. If, on the other hand, you grew up in a small 
town, when someone says “home” you most likely visualize a brick or wood-
frame residence with a white picket fence, a garden, and a swingset in the yard.
 
To distinguish the kind of home you see in areas of abundantly cheap land 
(and in programs like Leave It to Beaver) from condos, co-ops, and other types 
of property that folks call home, the correct terminology for the white-picket-
fence type property is detached single-family dwelling. The operative word is 
“detached,” because such homes aren’t attached to any of the surrounding 
properties. Now that you’re properly dazzled by the depth and breadth of our 
knowledge, we’ll just call these “homes” or “houses” like everyone else does.
Detached homes, like cars, come in two basic types: new and used.
New homes
If you’re the type of person who’d never think of buying a used car because 
you like the new-car smell and don’t like buying someone else’s problems, you 
may feel the same way about new homes. They have some very appealing 
advantages:
 
✓ A properly constructed new home is built to satisfy today’s buyers. 
Choosing a new home produced by a reputable builder of high-quality 
properties gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your home 
doesn’t contain asbestos, lead-based paints, formaldehyde, or other haz-
ardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, you can rest assured that your 
new home complies with current (and more stringent) federal, state, and 
local building, fire, safety, and environmental codes. Of course, you have 
no guarantee that future years won’t uncover more hazards!

160
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
✓ A properly constructed new home should be cheaper than a used 
home to operate and maintain. Operating expenses are minimal because 
a new home should incorporate the latest technology in energy-efficient 
heating and cooling systems, modern plumbing and electrical service, 
energy-efficient appliances, and proper insulation levels. And with a quality 
new home, your initial maintenance expenses are practically nonexistent 
because everything is new — roof, appliances, interior and exterior paint, 
carpets, and so on. Other than changing the light bulbs, what’s to fix?
 
✓ A properly designed new home won’t force you to adjust your lifestyle 
to its limitations. On the contrary, new homes have enough wall and 
floor outlets to accommodate all your high-tech goodies — microwave 
oven; espresso machine; satellite TV and cable outlets; video recorders; 
CD and DVD players; hair dryers; electric razors; electric toothbrushes; 
and home-office gear such as computers, monitors, printers, broadband 
Internet connections, fax machines, and so on. No unsightly, hazardous 
tangle of extension cords for you.
 
New homes are only as good as the developers who build them. Visit several 
of the developer’s older projects. See with your own eyes how well the devel-
opments have weathered over the years. Ask homeowners in older develop-
ments whether they’d buy another new home from the same developer. See 
what kinds of problems, if any, they’ve had with their homes over the years. 
Inquire whether the builder closed the sale on time and honored all contrac-
tual commitments, including the completion of any unfinished construction 
work, on time. Also find out whether the developer amicably fixed defects that 
occurred or whether homeowners had to take legal action to get problems 
corrected. Ask real estate agents how much homes in the developments have 
appreciated in value over time and how that compares with other homes in 
the general area.
As you may expect, new homes also have some disadvantages. To wit:
 
✓ What you see usually isn’t what you get. You see a professionally 
decorated, exquisitely furnished, beautifully landscaped model home. 
You buy a bare-bones, unfinished house where nearly everything — 
appliances, carpets, window coverings, painting, fireplace finishes, land-
scaping, and so on — is an extra that isn’t included in the base price. 
Developers often spend tens of thousands of dollars lavishly decorating 
model homes. Unwary new home buyers can spend small fortunes trying 
to duplicate the look of model homes. When touring a model home, ask 
the salesperson to explain exactly what is and isn’t included in the no-
frills base price.
 
✓ Prices are less negotiable. Developers maintain price integrity to 
protect the value of their unsold inventory of homes and to sustain 
appraised values for loan purposes. In fact, a developer who cuts prices 
is warning you that the project is floundering. Rather than reduce their 
asking prices, developers bargain with you by throwing in free extras 

161
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
or giving you upgrades (for instance, more expensive grades of carpet, 
better appliances, or granite kitchen counters rather than Formica) in 
lieu of a price reduction.
 
 Some developers attract buyers by pricing bare-bones houses very 
close to their actual cost and then make substantial profits on extras 
and upgrades. If, upon doing some comparison shopping, you find that 
these items are outrageously overpriced, don’t purchase them from the 
developer. Instead, buy the bare-bones house, and purchase extras from 
outside suppliers.
 
✓ On a price-per-square-foot basis, new homes are usually more expen-
sive than used ones. No surprise. Land, labor, and material costs are 
higher today than they were years ago, when the used homes were built. 
And don’t forget that you’re buying a home without any wear and tear.
 
✓ New homes in more developed areas are generally built in spots previ-
ously considered undesirable or unbuildable. It’s the old “first come, 
first served” principle. Earlier developments got better sites. Today’s 
developers take whatever land is available — steep hillsides, flood 
plains, and land located far away from the central business area. Ten or 
twenty years from now, today’s so-called lousy sites will be considered 
prime areas for new building — it’s all relative.
 
✓ New homes may have hidden operating costs. Developments with 
extensive amenities usually charge the homeowners dues to cover 
operating and maintenance expenses of common areas such as swim-
ming pools, tennis courts, exercise facilities, clubhouses, and the like. 
Some homeowners associations charge each owner the same annual fee. 
Others prorate dues based on the home’s size or purchase price — the 
larger or more expensive your home, the higher your dues. If the devel-
opment has a homeowners association, find out how its dues are struc-
tured and what your dues would be. Also find out what rules (called 
covenants) govern what you can do with your home as part of the devel-
opment. Some covenants limit the colors you can use when painting the 
house, what additions you can make to the property, whether you can 
rent the property, and so on. Although meant to maintain high property 
values, some of these rules can create problems later as you seek to 
adapt your property to your changing lifestyle. For more detailed infor-
mation about the important documents associated with homeowners 
associations and covenants, be sure to see the section “Attached resi-
dences” later in this chapter.
 
 Sometimes, homeowners-association dues are set artificially low to cam-
ouflage the true cost of living in the development. When that happens, 
sooner or later homeowners get slugged with a special assessment to 
repaint the clubhouse, resurface the tennis courts, or whatever. Make 
sure that the homeowners association in the neighborhood you’re con-
sidering has adequate reserves and that its dues accurately reflect actual 
operating and maintenance costs. Also check to see whether the historic 

162
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
rate of increase in dues has been reasonable and is in line with the current 
overall inflation rate, which you can probably determine by asking your 
lender.
 
✓ You may have to use the developer’s real estate agent to represent 
you. Developers always have their own sales staff and their own pur-
chase contracts. Some developers, however, let you be represented by 
an outside real estate agent, which is called broker cooperation. Others 
insist that you use their agent. This isn’t a negotiable item. If you don’t 
like it, your option is to walk away without buying a home.
 
 If you’ve fallen in love with a new home but the developer won’t cooper-
ate with outside agents, we recommend that you pay for an independent 
appraisal to get an unbiased opinion of the home’s value. You also want 
to have a real estate lawyer of your own choosing review your contract. 
(See Chapter 9 for how to find one and what he can do for you.)
 
Just because a home is brand-spanking new doesn’t mean that it’s flawless. 
People build homes. People are human. To err is human — that’s why you 
hear the expression human error. Moreover, builders work for profit and may 
be tempted to cut corners to maximize their short-term profits, not to mention 
that some builders simply aren’t very good. Thus, even a brand-new, never-
been-lived-in home should be thoroughly inspected from foundation to roof by 
a professional property inspector to discover possible human errors before 
you purchase it. We cover property inspections in our usual meticulous 
manner in Chapter 13.
Used homes
Perhaps you’re wondering why we classify all homes as being either new or 
used. Why not “new and old” rather than “new and used”? Because old isn’t 
a precise term. How old is old? Is a home built more than 25 years ago old? 
Or should the cutoff be homes constructed over 50 years ago? If homes built 
more than 50 years ago are old, what should we call homes built 100 or 200 
years ago — decrepit? Used, on the other hand, merely means that someone 
owned the home before you did. (Considering how expensive homes are, you 
may prefer to call the place you purchase a “previously owned” home. If that 
makes you feel better, go right ahead.)
Regardless of what you choose to call them, used homes have many com-
mendable features:
 
✓ Used homes are generally less expensive than new homes. As a rule, 
folks who bought houses years ago paid less for their homes than devel-
opers charge to build comparable new homes today. Furthermore, at 
any given time, more used homes are on the market than new homes. 
Good old competition holds down the price of used homes.

163
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
✓ Asking prices of used homes are generally much more negotiable 
than asking prices of new homes. Sellers of used homes don’t have to 
protect the property values of an entire development. They typically 
just want to get their money and move on to life’s next great adventure.
 
✓ Used homes are usually located in well-established, proven neighbor-
hoods. With a used home, you don’t have to wonder what the neigh-
borhood will be like in a few years when it’s fully developed. Just look 
around, and you can see exactly what kind of schools, transportation, 
shopping, entertainment, and other amenities you have.
 
✓ Used homes have been field tested. By the time you buy a used home, 
its previous owners have usually discovered and corrected most of the 
problems that developed over time due to settling, structural defects, 
and construction flaws. You won’t have to guess how well the home will 
age over the years — you can see it with your own eyes.
 
 No matter how well a home ages, you should still have it thoroughly 
inspected (inside and out) by qualified professionals before you buy it. The 
last owners may not have had the time, desire, or money to fix problems. 
They may also not have been aware of hidden problems. Be sure that the 
home meets today’s building codes; doesn’t have environmental, health, 
or safety hazards; is well insulated; and so on. Never try to save money 
on home inspections just because the house looks fine to you. The only 
exception to this stern admonishment is if you yourself happen to be a pro-
fessional property inspector. (See Chapter 13 for more about home inspec-
tions and inspectors.)
 
✓ Used homes are “done” properties. When you buy a used home, you 
generally don’t have to go through the hassle and expense of buying and 
installing carpets, window coverings, and light fixtures; finishing off the 
fireplace; planting a lawn; landscaping the grounds; building fences and 
patios; installing sprinkler systems; and the like. The work is already 
done (unless the used home is a major rehab project), and everything is 
generally included in the purchase price.
 
✓ Buying a used home may be the only way to get the architectural 
style, craftsmanship, or construction materials you want. What if your 
heart is set on owning an authentic 1800s New England farmhouse or a 
Queen Anne Victorian? Perhaps you want plaster walls, parquet floors, 
stained-glass windows, or some other kind of materials or craftsmanship 
that is unaffordable, if not impossible to find, in new homes. If that’s the 
case, buy a used home.

164
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Like new homes, used homes have some disadvantages:
 
✓ Used homes are generally more expensive than new homes to operate 
and maintain. Some used homes have been retrofitted with energy-efficient 
heating and cooling systems. Even so, a used home with 12-foot-high 
ceilings will always be more expensive to heat than a new home with 
9-foot-high ceilings. By the same token, the older a used home’s roof, 
gutters, plumbing system, furnace, water heater, appliances, and so on, 
the sooner you’ll need to repair or replace them.
 
 Before buying a used home, ask the seller for copies of the past two 
years’ utility bills (gas, electric, water, and sewer) so you can see for 
yourself exactly how much it costs to operate the house. If the utility 
bills are horrendous, ask your property inspector about the cost of 
making the house more energy efficient.
 
✓ Used homes generally have some degree of functional obsolescence. 
Examples of functional obsolescence due to outdated floor plans or design 
features are things like the lack of a master bedroom, one bathroom in a 
three bedroom house, no garage, inadequate electrical service, and no 
central heating or air conditioning. How much functional obsolescence 
is too much? That depends on you. What we think is charming, you may 
consider an uninhabitable disaster. We deal with extreme functional 
obsolescence in the fixer-upper section later in this chapter.
 
✓ Wonderful used homes are sometimes located in less-than-wonderful 
neighborhoods. You may be attracted to an utterly charming older home 
in a lousy neighborhood. Despite how much you think you’d love living 
in it, don’t forget that you’ll have to travel through the undesirable sur-
rounding area every time you want to get in and out of your dream house.
 
 Even though you may be able to ignore gang wars and graffiti on every 
wall, will prospective buyers be equally tolerant when you’re ready to 
sell? Remember: “location, location, value.” No matter how stunning the 
property or how great the deal you’re offered on it, don’t buy someone 
else’s problem.
Attached residences
If you can’t accept the rules and regulations that would, of necessity, be 
imposed on you by communal living, don’t read any further. You’re much too 
free a spirit to be happy owning an attached residence.
But if you’re willing to put up with the constraints of communal living to get 
the economic and lifestyle goodies associated with it, read on. You may be 
pleasantly surprised.

165
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
Condominiums
What type of property offers first-time buyers their most affordable housing 
option and gives empty-nesters who own detached homes an ideal lifestyle 
alternative for their golden years? If you said “condominiums,” go to the head 
of the class.
Some folks think that a condominium is a type of building. They’re wrong. 
The kind of building in which a condo is located doesn’t matter. Condos can 
be apartments in a Chicago high-rise or split-level townhouses in Dallas or 
Victorian flats in San Francisco. What makes a condo a condo is the way its 
ownership is structured.
 
First, a quick break for today’s foreign-language lesson. In Latin, con means 
“with,” and dominium means “ownership.” Put the two words together, and 
you get condominium, which translates to “ownership with others.” You’ll defi-
nitely dazzle your pals “con” that etymology trivia tidbit.
Suppose that you buy a condo in a Chicago high-rise. You have a mortgage, 
property taxes, and a fancy deed suitable for framing to prove that you own 
unit 603, one of 100 condos in that building. So far, owning a condominium is 
pretty much like owning a detached home that floats in the sky.
When you buy a detached home, an invisible line runs along the border of 
your property to separate what belongs to you from what belongs to your 
neighbors. When you purchase a condo, on the other hand, your property 
line is the interior surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, windows, and doors) of 
your unit. In other words, with a condo, you get a deed to the air inside your 
unit and everything filling it — carpeting, window coverings, and all.
The investment value of detached homes
Americans have always had a deep-seated 
love for detached homes. Like spawning salmon 
returning to the stream where they were born, 
many people are inexorably drawn to the same 
kind of house they grew up in when it’s their 
turn to buy a home. Even if you didn’t grow up in 
a detached home, you may covet one because 
TV shows and advertisements have drilled into 
your head that such homes are desirable and a 
sign of success.
Buyer demand for detached homes makes them 
good investments. Compared with attached res-
idences, such as condominiums and coopera-
tive apartments, detached homes tend to hold 
their value better in weak markets and appreci-
ate more rapidly in strong markets. Ask a local 
real estate agent for a comparison of property-
value appreciation in detached versus attached 
residences, and you can see what we mean.

166
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Air and interior improvements aren’t all you own. You and the other condo 
owners in the condominium complex share ownership of the land on which 
the project is located and the high-rise building that contains your individual 
units. Thus, all of you own a portion of the roof, exterior building walls, and 
foundation — as well as a chunk of the garage, elevators, lobby, hallways, swim-
ming pool, tennis courts, exercise facilities, and so on. All the parts of the com-
plex beyond the individual units are known as common areas because you own 
them in common with all the other condo owners.
If you buy a condo, you automatically become a member of the project’s 
homeowners association. You don’t have to attend the meetings unless you 
want to, but you must pay homeowners-association dues. The dues cover 
common-area operating and maintenance expenses for everything from staff 
salaries, chlorinating the pool, lighting the lobby, and garbage collection to 
fire insurance for the building. A portion of your dues goes into a reserve 
fund to cover inevitable repairs and replacements such as painting the build-
ing occasionally and replacing the roof.
 
Before buying a condo, find out exactly what percentage of joint ownership 
you’d have in the entire condominium complex. That amount establishes 
how much you’ll be assessed for monthly homeowners-association dues and 
what percentage you’ll pay of a special assessment that may be imposed on 
owners to cover unforeseen common-area expenses. It also determines how 
many votes you’d have in earthshaking matters affecting the complex, such as 
whether to paint the building aqua or tangerine, whether to repair the existing 
treadmill in the health club or buy a new one, and so on.
Condominiums use several different methods to establish the ownership 
percentages.
 
✓ The simplest method is to give each owner an equal share of ownership 
in the entire development. Thus, each owner has one vote and pays an 
equal amount of the monthly dues and any special assessments.
 
✓ If the ownership percentage is based on the size or market value of the 
condo, people who own the larger or more expensive units have more 
say in what happens in the complex than do owners of the smaller or 
less expensive condos. However, the heavy hitters also have accordingly 
higher monthly homeowners-association dues and pay a larger percent-
age of special assessments.
Why a condo?
Given their complexity, why do folks buy condominiums? Why doesn’t every-
one stick to simple, straightforward detached homes? Here’s why:

167
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
✓ Attached residences increase your buying power. Compare the price of 
a two-bedroom condo with a two-bedroom detached single-family 
dwelling in the same neighborhood. On the basis of livable square foot-
age, condos generally sell for at least 20 to 30 percent less than compa-
rable detached homes. Owning your very own roof, foundation, and plot 
of land is much more expensive than sharing these costs with a bunch of 
other owners.
 
 For some would-be buyers, the choice is either buying a condo that 
meets their living-space needs or continuing to rent. Economic necessity 
explains why the path to the American dream for nearly one out of five 
first-time real estate buyers is condominium ownership. There’s buying 
power in numbers.
 
✓ Attached residences generally cost less to maintain than detached 
homes. Suppose that you’re one of 100 condo owners in a Chicago high-
rise. Unlike the owner of a detached home, who has to pay the entire cost 
of maintenance expenses such as installing a new roof or getting an exte-
rior paint job, you can split these maintenance expenses with the other 
99 owners. Although replacing the high rise’s roof, for example, costs 
more in absolute terms than replacing the roof of a detached single-family 
home, the cost per owner should be less. There’s economy in numbers.
 
✓ Attached residences have amenities that you couldn’t otherwise afford. 
How many people do you know who own detached single-family homes 
with tennis courts, swimming pools, and fancy exercise clubs? Most hom-
eowners can’t afford expensive goodies like these. But when the cost is 
shared among all the owners in a large condo complex, the impossible 
dream is suddenly your hedonistic reality. There’s luxury in numbers.
 
✓ Attached residences are ideal homes for some empty-nesters. As you near 
retirement, you may find yourself rattling around in a detached single-family 
home like a little ol’ pea in a great big empty pod. Perhaps a two-bedroom 
condo in a building with no maintenance hassles and a doorman who’ll 
forward your mail while you’re off on one of your frequent vacations would 
solve all your problems. There’s lifestyle in numbers.
Condo drawbacks
Like detached homes, condos aren’t for everyone. Judge for yourself how 
much the following drawbacks may affect you:
 
✓ Condominiums offer less privacy. Shared walls mean you can hear others 
more easily. Noise pollution is one of the biggest problems with condos 
and the one area that prospective condo buyers frequently overlook. 
Visit the unit at different times of the day and different days of the week 
to listen for noise. Talk to owners of condominiums in the complex to 
see whether they’re bothered by noise pollution. If possible, spend a few 
hours or an evening in a unit. Be sure to turn off the easy-listening music 
that real estate agents may have playing during your tour of the unit.

168
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
 As a rule, the fewer common walls you share with neighbors, the more 
privacy you have in your unit. That’s one reason corner units sell for 
a premium. And if your unit is on the top floor, you won’t have people 
walking on your ceiling (unless there’s a roof deck, of course). The ulti-
mate in condo privacy, if you can afford it, is a top-floor corner unit.
 
✓ Condominiums are legally complex. Prior to buying your condo, you 
should receive copies of three extremely important documents: a Master 
Deed or Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs); 
the homeowners-association bylaws; and the homeowners-association 
budget. (See the nearby sidebar, “Condominium documents,” for more 
details.) Read these documents from cover to cover.
 
 The CC&Rs, bylaws, and budget are legally binding on all condo owners. 
Even though they’re bulky, bloated, and boring, you must read them 
very, very, very carefully. If you have questions about what these docu-
ments mean, or if you don’t understand how they affect you, consult a 
real estate lawyer. And as long as we’re talking about legal stuff, find out 
from your agent or the homeowners association whether the condomin-
ium is either currently involved in litigation or plans to be in the foresee-
able future. Lawsuits are expensive.
 
✓ Condominiums are financially complex. As a prospective owner, check 
the current operating budget. Be sure that it realistically covers build-
ing maintenance costs, staff salaries, utilities, garbage collection, insur-
ance premiums, and other normal operating expenses. If the budget is 
too low, prepare to get slugged with a massive dues increase sooner or 
later. By the same token, make sure that the budget includes adequate 
reserve funds to provide for predictable major expenses such as occa-
sional exterior paint jobs and new roofs. How much is adequate? Three 
to five percent of the condominium’s gross operating budget is generally 
considered a minimally acceptable reserve. If the reserve fund is too 
low, you’re in danger of getting a special assessment in the event of a 
financial emergency.
 
 We recommend that you review the past several years’ operating bud-
gets and financial statements for indicators of poor fiscal management. 
Here are some red flags to look out for:
 
• Frequent, large homeowners-association dues increases. Dues 
shouldn’t be increasing annually much faster than the current rate 
of inflation.
 
• Special assessments that wouldn’t have been necessary if the 
association had an adequate reserve fund. When discussing the 
budget and reserve fund, find out whether any dues increases or 
special assessments are anticipated in the near future to make up 
operating deficits or cover the cost of a major project.
 
• Too many homeowners who are delinquent in paying their dues. 
Operating expenses continue unabated regardless of whether all 
the owners pay their dues.

169
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
✓ Some condominium rules are overly restrictive. People who live in 
proximity to one another need a smattering of rules to maintain order 
and keep life blissful. Too many rules, however, can turn your condo into 
a prison. For example, the condominium may have rules specifying what 
kind of floor and window coverings you must have in your unit, rules regu-
lating the type or number of pets you can have in your unit, rules limiting 
your ability to rent your unit to someone else, rules forbidding you to 
make any alterations or improvements to your unit, rules limiting when or 
how often you can entertain in your unit, and so on. Before you buy, read 
the CC&Rs and bylaws carefully to find out exactly what kind of usage 
restrictions they contain. Some of these same restrictions can apply in 
new detached housing developments, as discussed previously.
 
 If you discover that the condominium (or the new housing development) 
has restrictions you don’t like, don’t buy the unit. Trying to modify 
CC&Rs or bylaws to eliminate restrictions after you’ve bought a unit is 
usually an expensive exercise in frustration and futility. We know that 
you have far better things to do with your life than waste a big chunk of 
it haggling with condominium associations and their lawyers.
 
 Prudent rental restrictions are good. Ideally, all units in the complex 
will be owner-occupied. If some owners occasionally let friends use their 
units or rent the units for a week or two while they’re on vacation, no 
big deal. However, if most of the units are owned by absentee investors 
who rent them to an endless parade of partying strangers, that’s bad if 
you happen to have difficulty sleeping with loud music blaring late at 
night. You may also have trouble getting a mortgage in a complex with 
too many renters.
 
✓ Brand-new condominium developments have the same advantages 
and disadvantages as new detached homes, compounded by a condo’s 
added legal and economic complexity. If you haven’t yet read the sec-
tion about new detached homes earlier in this chapter, now’s the time 
to do so. All our cautionary statements about new detached homes also 
apply to new condominiums. Like new detached homes, new condo proj-
ects are as good or bad as the developers who build them and the law-
yers who create them. Because any new project, by definition, doesn’t 
have a track record yet, you must visit earlier projects done by the same 
developer to see how well they’ve aged and how satisfied the condo 
owners are.
 
 Some unscrupulous developers of new condominium projects purposely 
lowball monthly operating costs to deceive prospective purchasers into 
thinking that living there costs less than it really does. These developers 
pay a portion of the monthly expenses out of their own pockets to keep 
project costs artificially low. The economic ax falls when the developer 
turns the project over to the homeowners association, which is soon 
forced to jack up the dues to cover actual operating expenses. When 

170
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
projected operating costs look too good to be true, they probably are. 
Compare the new project’s projected operating expenses with the actual 
operating expenses of a comparable established project.
 
✓ Where condominium parking and storage are concerned, the obvi-
ous isn’t. For example, does your condo deed include a deeded garage 
or parking space that only you can use, or is parking on a first-come, 
first-served basis? Do parking privileges cost extra, or is parking part of 
the monthly dues? What about provisions for guest parking or a parking 
area for boats or trailers? Do you have a deeded storage area located 
outside your unit? If so, where is it? If you need even more storage, is 
any available, and how much does it cost? You’re much better off getting 
answers to these questions before, rather than after, you buy.
 
✓ Some older buildings that have been converted from apartments into 
condominiums have functional obsolescence problems. Older build-
ings frequently have excellent detailing and craftsmanship. However, 
they also often have outdated heating and cooling systems, and may 
lack elevators, which are mighty handy if, for instance, you’re carrying 
groceries or suitcases up several flights of stairs. If you’re buying a condo 
in an older building, find out whether utilities are individually metered or 
lumped into the monthly homeowners-association dues. Does your unit 
have a thermostat to control its heating and air conditioning, or is the 
heating and cooling system centrally controlled?
 
 If utilities are part of the monthly dues, other condo owners have no 
incentive to economize by moderating their use of heat or air condition-
ing. If you’re frugal, you just end up subsidizing owners who aren’t. By 
the same token, in a building with central heating and cooling, your cli-
mate choices may be limited to roasting in the winter and freezing in the 
summer. Even if you can live with utility overcharges and personal dis-
comfort, these factors may deter future buyers from purchasing when 
you try to sell your unit.
 
✓ Size can be a problem. Large condo complexes usually have a cold, 
impersonal, hotel-like feeling. And as a rule, people who live in large 
complexes tend not to pay much attention to finances and day-to-day 
operating details because the homeowners association hires profes-
sional property managers to run things for the owners. There are, 
however, a couple of offsetting advantages to owning a condo in a large 
complex. If, for instance, several owners in a 100-unit complex fail to 
pay their monthly dues, it’s not the end of the world financially. What’s 
more, socially speaking, the odds of regularly running into an owner you 
detest diminish as the complex increases in size.

171
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
 Don’t buy into a small condominium complex unless you enjoy intimate 
relations with your neighbors. Carefully size up the other owners. Be 
sure that they’re the kind of folks you can trust to carry their fair share 
of the load financially and operationally. In a small condo, you actively 
participate in the homeowners association because you must. Every 
vote has an immediate impact on your finances and the quality of your 
life. You don’t have to love the other owners. BUT (note the big “but”) if 
some or all of them are the type of people you’ll be unable to get along 
with, don’t buy the unit.
After reading the disadvantages of condo ownership, you may think that only 
a fool would buy a condo. Not true. We know plenty of content condo owners 
who’d never consider buying a detached dwelling. In our attempt to protect 
you, we sometimes go a little overboard on the cautionary side of things. We 
do so with your best interests at heart.
 
Condominiums make the most sense for folks who don’t want operating and 
maintenance hassles (remembering that you’ll still have the expense), want 
to maximize their bang for the buck spent on living space, and don’t need a 
private yard. Buying a condo for a few years while you save enough money 
to purchase a detached home usually doesn’t make economic sense. Given 
the expenses of buying and selling a condo, combined with its probable lack 
of decent appreciation, you’re probably better off waiting to buy a detached 
home if you think you can do so within five years.
Condos need to be inspected, too
When you buy a condo, you must inspect the 
entire building — not just your unit. As Chapters 
9 and 13 explain, you need a professional prop-
erty inspector on your real estate team because 
the structural and mechanical condition of a 
property greatly affects its value. What’s the 
condition of expensive common-area com-
ponents such as the roof, heating and cool-
ing systems, plumbing and electrical systems, 
elevators, foundation, and the like? Are ameni-
ties such as tennis courts, swimming pool, and 
health facilities in good shape? Because you’re 
buying part of all the common areas in addition 
to your individual unit, you need a professional’s 
opinion of the entire complex’s condition.
Check the building’s soundproofing by asking 
other owners whether they’re bothered by 
noises emanating from units above, below, or 
beside their unit. The building has a ventilation 
problem if you can smell other people’s cooking 
odors in your unit or the hallways. If you dis-
cover that expensive repairs or replacements 
are necessary and the condominium’s reserve 
fund doesn’t have anywhere near enough 
money to cover the anticipated costs, don’t 
buy a unit in this complex. Sooner or later, the 
owners can expect a special assessment and/
or a big dues increase.

Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Cooperative apartments
The two most common types of attached residences are condominiums and 
cooperative apartments, which are usually called co-ops. You can’t tell which 
is which by looking at the building or individual units. Like condominiums, 
what makes a co-op a co-op is its legal status.
You’ll be delighted to know that most of the pros and cons of condominium 
ownership also apply to co-ops, so you don’t have to read a ton of new stuff. 
(If you haven’t read the previous section on condos, do so now.) In the fol-
lowing sections, we just focus on the three ways in which condos and co-ops 
differ: the definition of legal ownership, management, and your financing 
options.
Definition of legal ownership: Deed versus stock
When you buy a condo, you get a deed to your unit. When you buy a co-op, 
you get a stock certificate (to prove that you own a certain number of shares 
of stock in the cooperative corporation) and a proprietary lease, which entitles 
Condominium documents
If you’re the type of person who only wants to 
know what time it is, skip this. If, on the other 
hand, you’re fascinated by how watches are 
made, you’ll love this sidebar. It explains how 
condominiums are created and operated.
A condo project is born when the project devel-
oper records the Master Deed or Declaration 
of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions 
(CC&Rs) in the county recorder’s office, which 
officially makes this information a matter of 
public record for all the world to see. CC&Rs 
establish the condominium by creating a home-
owners association, stipulating how the con-
dominiums’ maintenance and repairs will be 
handled, and regulating what can and can’t 
be done to individual units and the condomini-
ums’ common areas. A similar procedure is 
sometimes used with new developments for 
detached housing.
Bylaws keep the condominium functioning 
smoothly. They describe in minute detail the 
homeowners association’s powers, duties, 
and operation. The bylaws also cover such 
nitty-gritty items as how the homeowners-
association officers are elected and grant the 
association the right to levy assessments on 
individual condo owners.
Last, but far from least, the developer creates a 
budget. Unlike the government, the condomini-
um’s budget can’t (theoretically, at least) oper-
ate in the red. The current budget establishes 
how much the condominium expects to spend 
this year to operate and maintain itself. Condo 
owners also receive an annual statement of 
income and expenses showing precisely how 
last year’s dues were spent and spelling out the 
condominium’s current financial condition.

173
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
you to occupy the apartment you bought. The corporation owns the building 
and has the deed in its name as, for example, the 10 West Eighty-sixth Street 
Corporation. Thus, you’re simultaneously a co-owner of the building and a 
tenant in the building you co-own.
 
In most cooperatives, shares are allocated based on a how big a unit is and 
what floor it’s on. Thus, a top-floor apartment usually has more shares than a 
ground-floor unit of the same size. The more shares you have, the greater your 
influence in the co-op because each share gives you one vote. Unfortunately, 
power has a price. Your proportionate share of the cooperative’s total mainte-
nance expenses is based on the number of shares you own in the corporation. 
If you own a great many shares, your monthly expenses will be dispropor-
tionately high. And when you’re ready to sell, your unusually high monthly 
expenses may reduce your unit’s value.
Management: Homeowners association versus board of directors
If you’ve always fantasized about being the chairman of the board, here’s 
your chance: Buy a co-op apartment, and work your way up the corpo-
rate ladder. Because your unit is in a building owned by a corporation, it’s 
governed by a board of directors elected by you and the other owners. 
Nomenclature aside, just like the homeowners association in a condominium, 
the board of directors is responsible for the cooperative’s day-to-day opera-
tions and finances.
Financing your purchase
Securing a mortgage to purchase your co-op may be difficult. Many lenders 
flat-out refuse to accept shares of stock in a cooperative corporation as secu-
rity for a mortgage. Conversely, some co-ops absolutely won’t permit any 
individual financing over and above the mortgage the corporation has on the 
building as a whole. These co-ops believe that one proof of creditworthiness 
is your ability to pay all cash for your unit.
 
Unless you’re richer than Midas, don’t buy a co-op if only one or two lenders 
in your area make cooperative-apartment loans. Odds are you’ll pay a higher 
interest rate because of the lack of lender competition and lender concerns 
about the greater risks of co-ops. Worse yet, what if these lenders stop making 
co-op mortgages and no other lenders take their place? You won’t be able to 
sell your unit until you find an all-cash buyer (and they’re few and far between) 
or until you have the financial resources to lend the money yourself to the next 
buyer.

Finding a Great Deal
If you’re like most people, you’re cursed with champagne taste and a beer 
budget. The homes you hunger for cost far more than you can afford. To buy 
one of these dream homes, you’d either have to get a really, really good deal 
or win the lottery.
Good deals are out there. The trick is knowing where to find them and how 
to evaluate them. Don’t waste time looking at perfect houses if you’re search-
ing for a deal. People pay premium prices for perfection. The houses you 
find great deals on are imperfect properties — houses with either physical 
or financial problems. The deal you’re offered is an inducement to tackle the 
problem. Whether the deal is ultimately better for you or for the seller is the 
question.
In Chapter 4, we discuss strategies for getting a good buy in any type of hous-
ing market. In the rest of this chapter, we cover special property situations 
that may be good deals or pigs in a poke.
Buying and selling co-ops is often challenging
Buying and selling co-ops is usually a lot more 
difficult than buying and selling condos. Most 
cooperatives stipulate that individual owners 
can’t sell or otherwise transfer their stock or 
proprietary leases without the express consent 
of either the board of directors or a majority of 
owners.
Prospective buyers generally must provide sev-
eral letters of reference regarding their sterling 
character and Rock of Gibraltar creditworthi-
ness. In addition, they may have to submit to a 
personal grilling by the board of directors. Given 
that the owners live in close proximity to one 
another and depend on one another financially, 
having the ability to screen out party animals, 
deadbeats, and the like is reasonable as long as 
that power isn’t misused to unfairly discriminate 
against buyers.
Even so, some buyers find the approval process 
extremely intrusive and strenuously object to 
giving strangers their financial statements. The 
approval process also tends to slow the sale of 
co-op units on the market.
Owning a co-op is a two-edged sword. As a 
co-op owner, you have much more control over 
who your neighbors will (or won’t) be than do 
condo owners. Unfortunately, that control cuts 
both ways. When you try to sell your unit, people 
you consider perfect buyers may be turned 
down by the co-op because your neighbors 
think that the prospective buyers would enter-
tain too much or can’t carry the load financially. 
Giving up the right to sell your co-op to the high-
est bidder may be too high a price to pay for the 
right to choose your neighbors.

 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
Finding a fixer-upper
Fixer-uppers are rundown houses with physical problems. Real estate agents 
generally refer to fixer-uppers euphemistically as “needing work,” “having 
great potential,” or “handyman’s special.”
Fixer-uppers aren’t very popular in sluggish real estate markets. Most buyers 
in such markets don’t want to put up with the hassle or financial uncertain-
ties associated with doing a major rehab. They prefer to buy houses in 
move-in condition. Such a house is a safe but passive investment. Because its 
potential has already been fully realized, the new owner can’t do anything to 
significantly increase its value.
A fixer-upper, on the other hand, offers potentially larger rewards to folks 
who have the vision to see beyond the mess that is to the wonderful home 
that can be. A fixer-upper buyer must also have the financial resources and 
courage to tackle the risks. If you fit that profile, here’s what you may be able 
to look forward to after you’ve transformed your ugly duckling into a swan:
 
✓ You’ll be living in a nicer home and a better neighborhood than you’d 
otherwise have been able to afford.
 
✓ Instead of buying a home decorated in someone else’s idea of good 
taste, your home will be done the way you like it.
 
✓ You may have increased your home’s fair-market value in excess of your 
out-of-pocket expenses for improvements you made.
For example, if you’re handy, you can add thousands of dollars of value to a 
fixer-upper by doing labor-intensive jobs such as painting, wallpapering, and 
landscaping yourself. Sweat equity can pay big dividends.
 
If, like us, you’re mechanically challenged, forget sweat equity. It’s less frus-
trating and cheaper in the long run to earn money doing what you do best 
and then using some of that money to hire competent contractors to do what 
they do best. Poor workmanship is a false economy; it looks awful and reduces 
property values. Doing the project well the first time is easier, faster, and ulti-
mately less expensive than doing it badly yourself and then paying someone 
else to fix your mess. If you’re one of those rare people who can do quality 
work yourself, by all means try your hand at it — just be realistic about the 
required time and costs.
Some fixer-uppers are easy to spot. They look like classic haunted houses — 
peeling paint, shutters falling off, overgrown yard, and so on. Things don’t 
get any better on the inside. These houses may need everything from a good 
cleaning to electrical system and plumbing overhauls.

176
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Other fixer-uppers, however, are much more subtle. Some older houses, 
condos, and co-ops, for example, may look fine at first glance but have func-
tional obsolescence. They’re livable, but they need improvements, such as 
adding master bedrooms, bathrooms, or garages, and upgrading their electri-
cal systems to bring them up to today’s more rigorous housing standards.
Digging for a diamond among the dumps
Finding the right fixer-upper isn’t a matter of luck. On the contrary, it takes 
persistence, skill, and plain hard work. You spend lots of time tromping 
through properties; invest more precious time evaluating promising fixer-
uppers that ultimately don’t make sense economically; and then, just when 
you’re ready to give up, you finally discover a diamond in the rough that you 
end up buying.
Here’s how to separate diamonds from dumps:
 
✓ Read this book. Everything you need to know is here. Pay special atten-
tion to the topics covered in this chapter (good neighborhoods; prin-
ciples of progression, regression, and conformity; and used homes and 
condos), Chapter 10 (accurately determining fair market value so you 
don’t overpay), and Chapter 13 (property inspections). Also, be sure 
that you can financially afford all the necessary expenditures after the 
purchase for the fix-up work (see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Inspect the heck out of the fixer-upper before you buy it. Every prop-
erty should be carefully inspected prior to purchase. Fixer-uppers need 
even more scrutiny so that you know precisely what you’re getting your-
self into. Make your purchase offer conditional upon your approval of 
the property inspections and satisfactory resolution of corrective work 
issues you discover. You can find these clauses in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Get contractors’ bids for structural repairs and renovations. You can 
use contractors’ bids as a negotiating tool to get a corrective-work 
credit or lower sales price from the sellers for structural repairs such 
as termite-damage repairs and a new roof. You should also get cost esti-
mates for renovations such as bathroom modernization, new kitchen 
appliances and cabinets, central heating, and anything else required to 
bring the property up to date.
 
 If the bids and cost estimates you receive indicate that you’d end up 
with the most expensive house on the block, don’t do the project. Fix-up 
work has three iron laws:
 
• It’s always more disruptive than you expected.
 
• It always takes longer to finish than you planned.
 
• It always costs more than you estimated.

177
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
 So if estimated fix-up costs would make the property the most expensive 
house on the block, by the time the work is finally completed, the actual 
costs will make it the most expensive house in the state!
 
Getting a loan is usually difficult if the cost of anticipated corrective work 
repairs exceeds 3 percent of the property value, which is always the case 
with major fixer-uppers. However, a good real estate agent should know 
which lenders in your area specialize in fixer-upper loans. Given that one 
such lender finds you creditworthy and your project feasible, that lender 
may give you a mortgage to buy the property and a construction loan to 
make the improvements.
Final thoughts on fixer-uppers
Feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the risks associated with fixer-uppers 
is normal. Now you understand why most home buyers avoid them — they 
fear being sucked into a bottomless bog that utterly disrupts their lives and 
totally devours their savings. Rent Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House and 
The Money Pit at your local video store to preview what may be in your real 
estate future!
 
Most novice home buyers, especially first-time buyers, woefully underestimate 
the time and cost required to fix up homes. When all is said and done, nearly 
all people find that it would have cost them the same or less to buy a more fin-
ished home and avoid the headaches of doing or coordinating the renova-
tions. Some folks have ended up in financial ruin and even divorced over the 
stresses of such renovations.
 
If you like challenges and are willing to do a ton of extra detective work, 
remember these tips to maximize your chances of succeeding with a fixer-
upper:
 
✓ Buy in the best neighborhood you can afford.
 
✓ Buy one of the cheaper houses on the best block.
 
✓ Make sure that the renovations will more than pay for themselves in 
increased property value.
 
✓ Make sure that the purchase price is low enough to allow you to do the 
corrective work and renovations without turning your property into the 
most expensive house on the block.
If the real estate gods play fair and square, whoever buys the exquisitely 
finished home you transformed from a dump will pay a bonus for your far-
sightedness to see the fixer-upper’s potential, for your audacity to tackle the 
financial risk, and for your stamina to put up with the chaos and filth of a 
rehab. If (and only if) you select wisely, negotiate the price wisely, and reno-
vate wisely, you’ll enjoy years of blissful living in the wonderful home you 
created — and ideally make a fine profit to boot when you sell it.

Taking over a foreclosure
To get a mortgage, you give the lender the right to take your home away from 
you and sell it to pay the balance due on the mortgage if you:
 
✓ Don’t make your loan payments
 
✓ Don’t pay your property taxes
 
✓ Let your homeowners insurance policy lapse
 
✓ Do anything else that financially endangers your home
The legal action to repossess a home and sell it is called a foreclosure.
Every year, hundreds of thousands of homes end up in foreclosure. 
Foreclosures in the late 2000s hit a high not seen in decades. Most foreclo-
sures result from people overextended on debt, including mortgages whose 
payments ratchet higher than the borrowers are prepared to handle. In other 
cases, however, people fall on hard times — they lose a job, experience unex-
pected healthcare costs, suffer a death in the family, or go through a divorce. 
Finally, some borrowers who have little invested choose to walk away from 
properties that have declined in value.
You may have heard stories about people who got good deals buying fore-
closures far below the property’s appraised value. And in fact, some people 
Structural repairs versus renovations
Work done on fixer-uppers falls into two broad 
categories: structural repairs and renovations.
 ✓ Structural repairs are changes you make to 
a property to bring it up to local health and 
safety standards. Such work can include 
foundation repairs, roof replacements, 
new electrical and plumbing-system instal-
lations, and so on — things that cost big 
bucks but add relatively little value to prop-
erty. Ideally, you can get a credit from the 
seller to do some, if not all, of the necessary 
structural repairs. The less you have to take 
out of your pocket for corrective work, the 
more you have to spend on renovations.
 ✓ Renovations increase a fixer-upper’s value 
by modernizing the home. Remodeling an 
old kitchen, installing a second bathroom, 
and adding a garage are a few examples of 
major structural renovations that make your 
home more functional, more pleasant to live 
in, and more valuable when you sell it.
 
 Cosmetic renovations (painting, carpeting, 
landscaping, and the like) also add value 
with far less expense and aggravation. The 
ideal fixer-uppers to buy are ones that look 
awful but simply need cosmetic fixes to 
look their best.

 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
who buy foreclosed property luck out. But for every lucky winner, many 
more people don’t profit or, worse, actually lose money buying foreclosures.
 
Buyer beware — foreclosures are generally legal and financial cesspools. Unless 
you have an expert on your team who can guide you through the entire foreclo-
sure process from beginning to end, don’t even think about buying a foreclosure 
at an auction.
If you buy a foreclosed home, you most likely also buy the previous owner’s 
problems. Here’s a list of risks to ponder:
 
✓ Physical: Some homeowners react to the emotional devastation of a 
foreclosure with a scorched-earth attitude of “if we can’t have it, we’ll 
make darn sure that nobody else wants it.” Before leaving, they take 
appliances, light fixtures, cabinets, sinks, toilets, and anything else 
of value. In extreme cases, they break windows, pour concrete down 
kitchen and bathroom drains, rip wiring out of walls, uproot shrubs, cut 
down trees, and do anything else they can think of to trash the property. 
What if you’re the high bidder for a sabotaged house at an auction of 
foreclosed properties? Lucky you.
 
 Lenders usually won’t let you inspect foreclosed properties prior to 
their auction. Nor can you make your offer to purchase subject to get-
ting a loan. Lenders don’t guarantee clear title to these properties, nor 
can you get title insurance to protect against undisclosed or undis-
covered flaws in the chain of title or liens against the properties (see 
Chapter 13 for more on title insurance). The risk of buying a property at 
a foreclosure auction greatly exceeds the possible reward.
 
✓ Financial: Depending on which state the house is located in, a foreclo-
sure can take anywhere from four months to over a year to complete. 
Suppose that you get what appears to be a good deal from people who 
are actually selling partway through the foreclosure process to avoid 
the stigma of foreclosure. What if these people lie about how much they 
owe on their mortgage and property taxes? What if they don’t tell you 
about unpaid homeowners’ association fees, unrecorded mortgages, 
court judgments, or federal and state tax liens (outstanding tax bills) 
hanging over the house? One guess who’s liable for debts secured by the 
property. Lucky you.
 
✓ Possession: Suppose that after buying a foreclosure at an auction, you visit 
your new home and discover that the previous owners are still living in 
it with their last remaining possession — a shotgun. They have no inten-
tion of leaving peacefully. Who do you think will have the pleasure of 
evicting them? Lucky you.

180
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
Given possible sabotage by the previous owner, buying a foreclosure is never 
entirely safe. The least risky way to purchase one is to buy directly from a 
lender who got title to the property because no one bought it at auction. 
Here’s why:
 
✓ Any recorded or undisclosed mortgages, court judgments, or tax liens 
on the house are either removed from the property or at least revealed 
to you prior to your purchase.
 
✓ You can — absolutely must, in fact — have the house minutely scruti-
nized by professional property inspectors. Where foreclosures are con-
cerned, you have to find out whether the previous owner left any hidden 
surprises for you. If we haven’t scared you off yet, see Chapter 13 for the 
unique aspects of inspecting foreclosed property.
 
✓ The price and terms of sale are negotiable. Even though foreclosures are 
normally listed at their appraised value, lenders may make allowances 
for corrective work by either reducing the price or giving you a credit to 
do the work. They’ll also, as a rule, offer attractive loan terms (low cash 
down payments, no loan fees, and below-market interest rates) to get rid 
of these blighted properties quickly. After all, they’re in the loan business — 
not property management.
Back-on-the-market properties
When a house listed for sale receives an 
acceptable offer, the sellers usually tell their 
agent not to actively market the property or 
solicit other offers while they work with the 
buyers to satisfy the contract’s terms and con-
ditions of sale, such as property inspections 
and financing. If such a property comes back on 
the market (BOM, in real estate lingo), it means 
that the deal fell apart.
Property comes back on the market for many 
reasons. Perhaps the buyers couldn’t qualify for 
a loan or got cold feet. Maybe the lender didn’t 
think the house was worth as much money 
as the buyers were willing to pay for it and 
wouldn’t approve their request for a loan. The 
far and away most common reason deals fall 
through, however, is that the buyers and sellers 
couldn’t agree on how to handle the corrective 
work discovered during the inspections.
Ironically, the castle that all the buyers coveted 
when it was the newest listing on the market 
may turn into a “that old thing” pumpkin when 
it returns. Suddenly, suspicious buyers wonder 
what’s wrong with the house. Real or imagined, 
that stigma of being a problem property repels 
a lot of people. They don’t want to buy a house 
that someone else rejected. As a result of 
reduced buyer enthusiasm, BOM homes often 
sell for a lower price the second time around.
Don’t categorically reject a house that comes 
back on the market. Find out why it’s BOM. If 
the problem is related to property defects, ask 
the sellers to show you copies of the inspec-
tion reports. Given that the problems are cor-
rectable and that you can negotiate a good 
deal, the sellers’ misfortune may be your good 
fortune. Sellers who’ve had a deal implode are 
frequently more willing to realistically negotiate 
on price and terms with the next buyer. If you 
apply the principles we cover in the fixer-upper 
section of this chapter, you can turn a BOM into 
a great deal.

181
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
 
Think long and hard before buying a foreclosure. Even if you purchase one 
directly from a lender, you may be buying a house permeated from foundation 
to roof by shattered dreams. Such a house probably hasn’t been given the best 
of care. Do your homework carefully, have the property thoroughly inspected, 
and understand fully what you’re getting yourself into before you buy.
Pooling Your Resources: 
Ad Hoc Partnerships
As home prices have escalated in many densely populated parts of the coun-
try, so has the frequency of unrelated people forming ad hoc partnerships 
to buy houses. These couples aren’t necessarily romantically involved. On 
the contrary, they’re usually folks who decide that a good way of turning the 
American dream of owning a home into reality is to join forces as partners.
Types of residential partnerships
One type of ad hoc partnership, known as equity sharing, involves outside 
investors who don’t live in the property. The investor provides cash to buy a 
house, which the other partner lives in while the property (ideally) appreci-
ates in value. After a specified period of time — say, five years — the partner 
who lives in the house has the option either to buy out the investor’s share of 
the property or to sell the house and split the proceeds.
With live-in partnerships, the other type of residential ad hoc partnership, all 
partners live together in the jointly purchased property. By pooling their income 
and cash for a down payment with a significant other, friend, or relative, these 
individuals get a place to call home; a tax shelter; and, if the real estate gods 
are willing, a profit when they eventually sell and go their separate ways.
Live-in partnerships are the real estate version of Siamese twins. People who 
live in ultraclose proximity to their partners every day have a personal rela-
tionship that is far more intense than in an equity-sharing partnership.
 
We’ve seen live-in partnerships that turned out wonderfully. As time passed, 
the partners became even closer friends than they were before buying the 
house. Most live-in partnerships, however, are no more than marriages of con-
venience that the partners suffer through solely to reap economic benefits. 
Bickering about things like whether to patch a leaky roof or get a new one, 
who left the sink full of dirty dishes (again!), whether to paint the living room 
purple or gold, and who gets the backyard for a party next Saturday can strain 
even the best of relationships.

Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Structuring a successful partnership
Too many partnerships end up on the rocks unnecessarily. Why? The part-
ners didn’t anticipate problems related to co-ownership that arose. Ironically, 
most of these problems are foreseeable and avoidable. Proper planning 
prevents problems.
 
Before forming a residential partnership, you can do two things to greatly 
increase your odds for success:
 
✓ Give it a trial run. If you’re considering a live-in partnership, we recom-
mend that you live with your prospective partner for at least six months 
before buying a home together. You may discover that you have a major 
compatibility problem — for example, you may go to bed each night by 
nine, and your roomie may love to party into the wee hours of the morn-
ing. Ditto if you, Felix, insist on having everything in its place, and your 
partner-to-be, Oscar, uses the floor for a closet. Imagine the delights of 
co-ownership if you always pay your bills by the first of the month, and 
your partner’s favorite sport is a spirited game of duck-the-bill-collector.
 
✓ Put it in writing. We also recommend having a lawyer who handles resi-
dential real estate partnerships prepare a written partnership agreement 
as soon as possible. Don’t reinvent the wheel; let an experienced lawyer 
guide you and your prospective partner through the foreseeable “what 
ifs” of every partnership.
The partnership from hell
Unfortunately, partnerships occasionally turn 
into unmitigated disasters. Irv’s sad tale illus-
trates some pitfalls of residential partnerships.
Irv and Sid, good pals for almost 25 years, 
bought a condo together. Irv used money inher-
ited from his mother for the condo’s down pay-
ment and closing costs. Sid, who had a much 
higher income than Irv but no cash, lived in 
the condo as his principal residence. Sid cov-
ered the monthly mortgage payments, property 
taxes, and homeowners-association dues, and 
also paid rent to Irv.
It was a perfect partnership. Sid got the tax 
deductions he needed, plus 25 percent of the 
appreciation when the condo sold. Sid’s rent 
payments gave Irv a good return on the cash 
he’d invested, and he’d get the lion’s share of 
the condo’s appreciation when it sold. Irv and 
Sid were delighted with their arrangement.
All went well for nearly a year. Then, without 
warning, Sid filed bankruptcy.
Irv’s rent payments stopped, of course. What’s 
more, the bankruptcy court put a lien on the 
condo to tie up Sid’s assets — and inadver-
tently tied up Irv’s money as well. Worst of all, 
Irv and Sid didn’t have a written partnership 
agreement describing their 75/25 equity split. 
Without something in writing, Irv was unable to 
prove this fact to the court’s satisfaction.

183
 Chapter 8: Where and What to Buy
Ideally, you should have the agreement drawn up well before you make an 
offer to purchase. Why the rush? To make sure that you and your partner 
understand precisely how the partnership operates and what your responsi-
bilities to each other are. The agreement should cover important issues such 
as the following:
 
✓ Financial arrangements: This section of the agreement deals with the 
economics of buying, maintaining, and selling the property. It also speci-
fies the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes for 
each partner if the partnership involves unequal financial contributions.
 
 What happens if, for example, your partner suddenly dies or goes bank-
rupt? How you take title in the property is critical. (We cover this impor-
tant issue in Chapter 14.) Should the partners in a live-in partnership 
give each other first right of refusal to buy the partner’s share before 
it can be sold to an outsider? Planning for the unexpected sure beats 
reacting to a crisis. Your agreement must have equitable provisions for 
terminating the partnership.
 
✓ Dispute resolution: What if you and your partner come to blows on a 
critically important issue like whether to plant daisies or roses along the 
side of the house? If only two partners are involved, how do you break 
tie votes? Anticipate disputes. Even the best of friends occasionally 
disagree — that’s a fact of life. Provide a method (such as mediation or 
arbitration) to resolve the problems you can’t work out between your-
selves.
 
✓ Game plan: If you and your partner intend to improve the property you 
purchase by, for example, remodeling the kitchen or converting a pair 
of flats to condominiums, your partnership agreement should be as spe-
cific as possible regarding the intended scope of work, project timing, 
cost, and so on. Plan now to prevent arguments later.
 
Never rush into a partnership — the economic consequences of a mistake 
may be devastating. Carefully weigh the pros and cons. Then get everything in 
writing with help from a lawyer experienced in covering all the “what if” situa-
tions just in case everything doesn’t turn out as wonderfully as you hope.

W
inston Churchill once characterized the former Soviet Union as 
“a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” Churchill’s apt 
description applies equally well to the home-buying process. If you’re like 
most folks who are looking for a home, you’re not an expert on property 
values, financing, or tax and real estate law. And when your life savings are 
on the line, ignorance isn’t bliss. Not understanding what’s involved in the 
process of buying a home can cost you big bucks and make you unhappy 
with the home that you ultimately purchase.
How can you find your way through the convoluted maze of constantly chang-
ing real estate market conditions, local laws, regulations, and tax codes? Where 
can you sign up for a crash course in home values? Even if you have the apti-
tude, how will you find the time to become an expert in so many fields?
One way around these problems is to do nothing. You can’t get into trouble 
if you’re lying in a corner, curled tightly into the fetal position. Of course, the 
downside of doing nothing is that nothing gets done. You can never buy a 
home by using this method.
Reading Home Buying For Dummies, 4th edition is a far more dynamic 
course of action. This book shows you how to become a smart home buyer. 
However, this book can’t do everything for you.

186
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
Understanding the theory of property values and knowing what your dream 
home is actually worth are two very different things. Similarly, reading 
about home buying isn’t a slam-dunk guarantee that you’ll become an expert 
home buyer — there’s no substitute for years of practical experience in the 
field. You also need some experts on your side. Don’t worry. In this chapter, 
we explain how to find competent experts who can help you buy a home and 
who won’t charge you an arm and a leg for that help.
The Team Concept
Time and time again, we’ve seen smart people blunder into horrible situa-
tions while buying a home. More often than not, what got them into trouble 
was ignorance of something that they (or their advisors) should have known 
but didn’t.
Strangely enough, knowing everything yourself isn’t important. What is impor-
tant is having good people on your team — people who know what you need 
to know so that they can help you solve the problems that invariably arise.
Lining up the players
You don’t have to become an instant expert in home values, mortgages, tax 
and real estate law, title insurance, escrows, pest-control work, and construc-
tion techniques to play the home-buying game well. You can choose to hire 
people who have mastered the skills that you lack. Home buying is a team 
sport. Your job is to lead and coach the team, not play every position. After 
you’ve assembled a winning team, your players should give you solid advice 
so that you can make brilliant decisions.
 
If cost were no object, you’d hire every competent expert you could get your 
hands on. But because you probably don’t have an unlimited budget, you need 
to determine which experts are absolutely necessary and which tasks you can 
handle yourself. In this chapter, we explain which experts are generally worth 
hiring and which ones you can pass on. Ultimately, of course, you must deter-
mine how competent or challenged you feel with the various aspects of the 
home-buying process.
Here’s a thumbnail sketch of the possible players on your team:
 
✓ You: Always remember that you’re the most important player on your 
team. In nearly every home purchase, something goes wrong — one of 
your players drops the ball or doesn’t satisfy your needs. You have every 
right to politely, yet forcefully, insist that things be made right. Remember 
that you hire (and pay) the players on your team. They work for you. Bad 

187
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
players may see things the other way around — they want to believe (and 
want you to believe) that they’re in charge. They may try to manipulate 
you to act in their interests rather than yours. Don’t tolerate this. You’re 
the boss — you can fire as well as hire.
 
✓ Real estate agent: Because the home you’re about to buy is probably 
the largest single investment you’ll ever make, you must have someone 
on your team who knows property values. Your agent’s primary mission 
is to help you find your dream home, tell you what the home is worth, 
and negotiate for it on your behalf.
 
✓ Real estate broker: Every state issues two kinds of real estate licenses: 
a salesperson’s license and a broker’s license. People with broker’s 
licenses must satisfy much tougher educational and experience stan-
dards. If your real estate agent isn’t an independent broker or the broker 
for a real estate office, he (or she) must be supervised by a broker who 
is responsible for everything that your agent does or fails to do. In a 
crisis, your transaction’s success may depend upon backup support 
from your agent’s broker.
 
✓ Lender: If you can’t pay, you can’t play. And because most folks can’t 
pay all cash for their homes, you probably need a loan to buy your 
dream house. A good lender offers competitively priced loans and may 
even be able to help you select the best type of loan from the financial 
minefield of loan programs available today.
 
✓ Property inspector: A house’s physical condition greatly affects its 
value. Have your dream home thoroughly inspected from roof to foun-
dation before you purchase it to ensure that you actually get what you 
think you’re buying.
 
✓ Escrow officer: Mutual distrust is the underlying rule of every real estate 
deal. You and the seller need a neutral third party, an escrow officer, 
who handles funds and paperwork related to the transaction without 
playing favorites. The escrow officer is the home-buying game’s referee.
 
✓ Financial and tax advisors: Before you buy a home, you should under-
stand how the purchase fits into the context of your overall financial 
situation. You should address the issues of what your financial goals are 
and, given those goals, how much house you can afford. In Chapter 2, we 
explain how to do that.
 
✓ Lawyer: You may or may not need a lawyer on your team, depending 
on your contract’s complexity, where your dream home is located, and 
your personal comfort level. The purchase agreement you sign when 
buying a home is a legally binding contract. If you have any questions 
about your contract’s legality, put a lawyer who specializes in real estate 
law on your team.
 
Odds are you won’t win the game unless you have a winning team. But remem-
ber that your players are advisors — not decision makers. You’re the boss and 
decision maker. The buck stops with you. After all, it’s your money on the line.

188
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Avoiding gratuitous advice
We’ll say it again: Buying a home is a team sport. Successful transactions 
result from the coordinated efforts of many people — agents, brokers, lend-
ers, property inspectors, escrow officers, tax advisors, and lawyers. Each 
player brings a different set of skills to the game and should make an impor-
tant contribution to your team.
As long as your experts stick to what they know best, everything goes 
smoothly. Whenever one of your experts invades another expert’s turf, how-
ever, war breaks out with a bang.
Unsolicited opinions related to property values are an example of one dev-
astating type of gratuitous advice. Such opinions are usually volunteered by 
tax advisors or lawyers during a review of your transaction. Lawyers and tax 
advisors don’t know property values. Making a low-ball offer based on their 
bad advice, no matter how well intentioned, can blow the deal on your dream 
home.
Incredibly, some buyers foolishly solicit gratuitous advice in a misguided 
attempt to save a few bucks. “Why,” buyers ask themselves, “hire a CPA for 
tax advice if we can get free tax advice from our agent? Why pay for legal 
advice from a lawyer if our escrow officer can give us free opinions about the 
best way for us to take title to our home?”
Why? Because if you’re lucky, free advice from the wrong expert is worth 
exactly what you pay for it. Zip. Zero. Nada. Nothing.
If you’re unlucky, free advice can be very expensive. The IRS, for example, 
shows no mercy if you make a mistake based upon faulty advice. Ironically, 
this type of mistake usually ends up costing you far more than a lawyer or tax 
advisor would have charged you for correct advice.
Given the adverse consequences of bad advice, good experts don’t offer guid-
ance that they aren’t qualified to give. If asked, they categorically refuse to 
give such advice. Instead, they redirect their clients to the proper experts. 
Good experts are wise enough to know what they don’t know and humble 
enough to admit it. On a more selfish level, they don’t want to get sued by 
their clients for giving lousy advice.
 
Beware of experts who offer you gratuitous advice outside their fields of 
expertise.

189
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
Reeling in a Real Estate Agent
“What’s it worth?”
The wrong answer to this question can cost you big bucks! Worse yet, there’s 
no simple answer to this deceptively simple question, because home prices 
aren’t precise. As Chapter 10 explains, you can’t reduce home prices to a 
math problem where 2 plus 2 reassuringly equals 4 now and forevermore. 
Home prices aren’t fixed — on the contrary, they slither all over the place.
 
Houses sell for fair market value, which is whatever buyers offer and sellers 
accept. Fair market value isn’t a specific number; it’s a price range.
Suppose that you make an offer on a house worth about $150,000. If the seller 
has a better agent than you do, and you’re desperate to buy, you may end 
up paying $160,000. On the other hand, if you’re in no hurry to buy, and your 
agent is a good negotiator, you may be able to buy the home for $140,000. 
Home sale prices are often directly related both to the agent’s knowledge of 
what comparable houses have sold for and to the agent’s negotiating skills. 
Of course, other factors (such as the buyer’s and seller’s motivation, needs, 
and knowledge) are also important.
A good agent can be the foundation of your real estate team. An agent can 
help you find a home that meets your needs, negotiate for that home on your 
behalf, supervise property inspections, and coordinate the closing. Agents 
often have useful leads for mortgage loans. A good agent’s negotiating skills 
and knowledge of property values can save you thousands of dollars.
Some people think that “good agent” is a contradiction in terms. These folks 
tell you that all agents have a hidden agenda: to make people buy more expen-
sive homes than they can afford in order to fatten agents’ commission checks.
Some agents may try to pressure you to buy sooner rather than later (and 
to pay more than you should) to fatten their own commissions. And unfor-
tunately, many well-intentioned-but-inept agents are also out there. In the 
following sections, we explain how to avoid the bad agents — and how to sift 
through the masses of mediocre agents — in order to narrow the field down 
to good agents who are worthy of their commissions.
Types of agent relationships
Say that you’ve been working with an agent named Al who has been showing 
you property for several months. Yesterday, you finally found a home you 
like. The house seemed well priced, but you told Al to make a low-ball offer 

190
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
anyhow. (What the heck. Everybody knows that prices are negotiable. If the 
sellers don’t like the price, let them make a counteroffer.) But what if your 
agent blew your cover? Suppose that Al told the sellers all your innermost 
secrets — such as how much cash you have for a down payment and how 
much you’re really willing to pay for the house. Now the sellers can beat 
you at your own game. If you discover what Al did to you (many victimized 
buyers don’t), you’d undoubtedly feel hurt, betrayed, and pretty darn angry. 
You’d ask Al just whose side he’s on.
The answer to that question has changed somewhat over the years. In 
decades past, buyers thought that they had agents who represented them. 
But in fact, they didn’t. Back then, all agents were legally bound to be either 
agents or subagents of the seller.
 
Subagents, also called cooperating agents, work with one another through 
membership in a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). Agents use the MLS to pro-
mote their own real estate listings, and such agents offer to share their com-
missions with agents from other offices who actually sell the listed properties. 
As subagents of the seller, MLS participants are obliged to get top dollar for 
the sellers’ properties.
Unfortunately, most buyers didn’t know that the very agents who were work-
ing with them were actually representing the interests of the sellers. And the 
law didn’t require agents to tell buyers which party they (the agents) actually 
represented before preparing offers on behalf of their buyers.
Times have changed somewhat. Some states (such as California) have 
adopted improved consumer-protection laws. These states passed laws that 
force agents to give both buyers and sellers a written disclosure regarding 
their duties as agents. The laws then allow buyers and sellers to select which 
type of relationship they want to have with their agents.
Home buyers and sellers can have three different types of relationships with 
real estate agents. We explain dual agency in the nearby sidebar “Dual agency 
and conflicts of interest.” The other possible relationships are both types of 
single agency, which is when the agent represents only one of the two parties 
in the transaction:
 
✓ Seller’s agent: In this form of single agency, the agent works solely for 
the seller.
 
✓ Buyer’s agent: In this type of single agency, the agent works only for 
the buyer. A buyer’s agent isn’t an agent of the seller even if the buyer’s 
agent gets a portion of the commission paid by the seller.
 
Although single agency is an improvement over the old system, buyer’s agents 
still suffer from the conflict of interest inherent in getting a commission that is 
tied to a percentage of the amount that a buyer spends for a property.

191
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
In rare cases, buyer’s agents don’t accept money from sellers. Instead, a buyer 
signs a contract to work exclusively with a buyer’s agent, and the buyer pays 
the agent a retainer that is applied toward the fee owed when the buyer’s agent 
Dual agency and conflicts of interest
In certain transactions, an agent represents 
both the seller and the buyer. This type of rep-
resentation is called dual agency.
Dual agency is the most confusing form of 
agency. Most people think that dual agency 
means that the exact same agent represents 
both the buyer and the seller. Such a situation is 
possible, but it’s highly unusual and even more 
inadvisable. One agent can’t possibly represent 
your best interests as a buyer and the seller’s 
best interests at the same time.
In a more common kind of dual agency, the sale 
of a particular property involves two different 
agents who both work for the same real estate 
broker. Suppose that Sam Seller decides one 
sunny Sunday to list his house for sale with 
Sarah, an Acme Realty agent. Sarah smiles as 
she signs the agreement to represent Sam as 
the seller’s exclusive agent.
Simultaneously, Betty Buyer bumps into Bob, 
who’s also an Acme Realty agent, at a Sunday 
open house. Betty likes Bob’s style and asks 
him to represent her exclusively as a buyer’s 
agent. Bob enthusiastically agrees.
So far, so good. Sam has Sarah, his exclusive 
agent. Betty has Bob, her exclusive agent. 
Things get complicated later that afternoon 
when Bob shows Betty Buyer the house Sarah 
just listed for Sam Seller. Betty is bedazzled. 
She loves the house and tells Bob to write up 
an offer on it immediately.
When Betty decided to make an offer on Sam’s 
house, the agency relationships that Betty and 
Sam had with their respective agents changed. 
Like it or not, Sarah suddenly represented both 
Sam and Betty. Similarly, Bob became the agent 
of both Betty and Sam.
Why? Even though two different agents are 
involved, both agents work for the same real 
estate broker, Acme Realty. As soon as Bob 
started to work on Betty’s offer, Acme Realty 
represented the seller and the buyer of the 
same property. That’s dual agency.
Dual agency probably won’t be a problem if you 
end up working with an agent in a small office 
that has only a few agents. The odds that you’ll 
buy a home listed by one of the other agents 
in your agent’s office are slim. However, if the 
agent that you select works for a large broker-
age operation with multiple offices and thou-
sands of agents (such as Coldwell Banker), 
your odds of having to deal with dual agency 
skyrocket.
As a buyer, you must be on guard for two 
potential problems when confronted with dual 
agency. First, make sure that your agent isn’t 
sharing confidential information with any other 
agents at her real estate company. Second, 
watch out for agents who push their own com-
pany’s listings because selling an in-house list-
ing generates higher commissions for them.
Most states permit dual agency relationships 
as long as the agency status is disclosed to 
both the sellers and the buyers in advance, 
and both parties agree to it. Undisclosed dual 
agency can be used as grounds to have a pur-
chase agreement revoked and usually permits 
the injured parties to seek recovery against the 
real estate agents.

finds the buyer a home. Depending on the contract provisions, the retainer 
may or may not be returned to the buyer if the buyer’s agent fails to find the 
buyer a satisfactory property to purchase.
 
Here’s a way to have the best of both worlds with a buyer’s agent. This tech-
nique removes the buyer’s agent’s incentive to get you to spend more, yet it 
keeps you from paying a fee if you don’t buy a home. Offer your buyer’s agent 
a lump-sum commission plus a bonus if, and only if, the agent gets you a better 
buy. For example, if the agent typically receives 3 percent of a home’s sale 
price, and you expect to buy a home for approximately $200,000, offer the 
agent a flat $5,000 commission plus an additional $100 bonus for every $1,000 
below $200,000 the agent reduces the price for you, up to a maximum $6,000 
commission.
Is your agent your ally or your enemy? Because laws regarding an agent’s 
legal responsibility vary from state to state, know how the game is played in 
your state. Be sure that you determine who your agent represents before you 
begin working together.
How agents get paid
Real estate brokerage is an all-or-nothing business. As a rule, agents are paid 
a commission only when property sells. If the property doesn’t sell, agents 
don’t get paid.
 
This payment method can create a conflict of interest between you and your 
agent. The payment method won’t create a conflict of interest with good agents, 
because good agents put your best interests in front of their desire to get paid. 
You know that you’re working with a bad agent, however, if the agent is more 
interested in quickly closing the sale and having you pay top dollar than in 
diligently educating you and getting you the best possible deal.
Allow us to answer your burning questions about real estate commissions:
 
✓ How much do real estate agents get in commissions? Commissions are 
calculated as a percentage of the sale price. Depending on local custom, 
commissions on homes usually range from 4 to 7 percent of the sale price.
 
✓ Who pays the commission? Typically, sellers. After all, sellers get money 
when property sells. Buyers rarely have much money left after making the 
down payment for their dream home and paying loan charges, property-
inspection fees, homeowners-insurance premiums, moving costs, and 
the other expenses of purchase noted in Chapter 3. Because commission 
is part of the sales price, however, the effective cost of the commission 
comes out of both the buyer’s and seller’s pockets.

 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
 
✓ Are commissions negotiable? Absolutely. Listing agreements (the con-
tracts that property owners sign with brokers to sell property) and pur-
chase agreements usually state that commissions aren’t fixed by law and 
may be negotiated between sellers and brokers.
 
✓ How is the commission distributed? Suppose that a house sells for a nice, 
round $200,000. Assuming a 6 percent commission rate, the sale generates 
a $12,000 commission. That’s a lot of money. At least it would be if it all 
went to one person, but commissions don’t work that way as a rule.
 
 Usually, the commission is divided in half at the close of escrow. The list-
ing broker, who represents the sellers, gets half ($6,000, in our example) 
of the commission, and the other half ($6,000) goes to the selling broker, 
who represents the buyers.
Where an agent’s time goes
Some people think that real estate commis-
sions are disproportionately large relative to the 
amount of work that agents do. That’s a polite 
way of saying that agents are grossly overpaid.
Justifying a good agent’s commission is easier 
if you understand what we call The Iceberg 
Theory. As you probably know, 90 percent of an 
iceberg’s bulk is hidden underwater. You can’t 
tell how big an iceberg is by the portion you see 
floating above the waterline. By the same token, 
you can’t tell how much time agents spend 
working for you. Good agents spend at least 
nine hours working behind the scene for every 
hour spent in the presence of their clients.
Unfortunately, most buyers and sellers don’t know 
this. Buyers and sellers think that commissions 
are excessive, given the relatively few hours they 
actually see their agents working for them.
Unlike lawyers and other professionals who 
bill clients by the hour, real estate agents don’t 
itemize the time spent on a transaction from 
start to finish. If they did, you’d have a much 
better idea of where your agent’s time goes.
Good real estate agents typically spend around 
20 hours a week touring new properties and 
checking up on houses that have been on the 
market a while to see which houses are still 
available and which have had offers accepted 
on them. Agents do this legwork, week in and 
week out, to keep themselves current regarding 
what’s on the market and how property values 
are changing.
After you select an agent, she starts target-
ing houses you may want to buy. Good agents 
screen several properties for each one they 
eventually show you, saving you the time of 
doing the screening yourself. Your agent spends 
time playing phone tag with listing agents, 
trying to get instructions about how to show 
properties, and scheduling showings. Then she 
spends more hours with you, touring houses 
and searching for your elusive dream home.
After you’ve found your dream home, your agent 
spends time preparing an offer to purchase, 
presenting the offer, and negotiating counter 
offers with the seller’s agent regarding the price 
and terms of sale. After the offer is accepted, a 
good agent spends more hours helping you with 
such things as securing a mortgage; coordinat-
ing transaction details with the seller’s agent; 
providing information and paperwork to the 
escrow officer; going through the home with 
your various property inspectors; and review-
ing mandated local, state, and federal disclo-
sure statements from the sellers.

194
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
If the selling or buying agent works for a broker, the broker typically gets a 
portion of the commission. The brokerage firm typically takes 30 to 50 percent 
of the commission, which leaves the agent 50 to 70 percent. In some firms, 
such as RE/MAX, agents pay a fixed monthly fee to their brokerage firm and 
end up keeping 80 to 90 percent of the commissions they bring into the firm. 
Agents who work on their own as independent brokers, of course, don’t have 
to split their commissions with anyone.
Characteristics of good agents
Good agents can be male or female, and they come in a wide assortment of 
races, colors, creeds, and ages. All good agents, however, have the following 
characteristics that are beneficial to buyers:
 
✓ Good agents educate you. Your agent knows the home-buying process 
and carefully explains each step so that you always understand what’s 
happening. Agents should be patient, not pushy. A good agent never 
uses your ignorance to manipulate you.
 
✓ Good agents don’t make decisions for you. Your agent always explains 
what your options are so that you can make wise decisions regarding 
your best course of action.
 
✓ Good agents tell you when they think that adding other experts 
(inspectors, lawyers, and the like) to your team is advisable. Experts 
don’t threaten a good agent. The agent’s ego should always be second-
ary to the primary mission of serving you well.
 
✓ Good agents voluntarily restrict themselves geographically and by 
property type. Your agent has ideally learned that trying to be all things 
to all people invariably results in mediocre service. Different communi-
ties can have radically different market conditions, laws, and restric-
tions. (For more information, see the nearby sidebar “Agents who work 
outside their areas of expertise are dangerous.”)
 
✓ Good agents are full-time professionals, because serving you properly 
is a full-time job. To reduce the financial impact of changing jobs, many 
people begin their real estate careers as part-timers, working as agents 
after normal business hours and weekends. That’s fine for the agents, 
but not you.
 
 
One of the first questions you must ask any agent you’re considering work-
ing with is “Are you a full-time agent?” Just as you wouldn’t risk letting a 
part-time lawyer defend you, don’t let a part-time agent represent you.

195
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
 
✓ Good agents have contacts. Folks prefer doing business with people 
they know, respect, and trust. You can use your agent’s working rela-
tionships with local lenders, property inspectors, lawyers, title officers, 
insurance agents, government officials, and other real estate agents. 
Good agents will refer you to highly skilled service providers who offer 
competitive pricing.
 
 Watch out for duplicitous agents with hidden agendas. Instead of refer-
ring you to the best possible service providers, these agents limit their 
recommendations to people who refer business to them or pay them a 
referral fee.
 
✓ Good agents have time. Agents earn their living selling time, not houses. 
Success is a two-edged sword for busy agents. An agent who is already 
working with several other buyers and sellers probably won’t have 
enough surplus time to serve you properly. Occasional scheduling con-
flicts are unavoidable. But if you often find your needs being neglected 
because your agent’s time is overcommitted, get a new agent.
Agents who work outside their areas of expertise 
are dangerous
Many pitfalls await unwary buyers who 
trust agents who work outside their areas of 
expertise. Although extreme, here’s a real-life 
example of a disaster caused by an agent who 
specialized in property located in Sonoma, a 
peaceful suburban town about 40 miles north 
of the city of San Francisco.
The Sonoma agent represented her friend in the 
purchase of a small apartment building located 
in San Francisco. The buyer planned to convert 
the apartments to condominiums and then sell 
the condos individually at a profit.
Unfortunately, the Sonoma agent knew noth-
ing about San Francisco’s strict rent-control 
law or its equally strict condo-conversion ordi-
nance. The intent of these laws is to discourage 
people from converting lower-rent apartments 
to upscale condos.
Had the building been converted to condos, the 
total proceeds from individual sales would’ve 
been less than the price the buyer had originally 
paid for the building, because of the restrictive 
nature of these two laws. The agent’s negli-
gence ultimately led the buyer to lose $125,000 
when she later resold the building.
This agent not only made the mistake of working 
in “foreign territory,” but she also failed to rec-
ommend that the buyer put a local real estate 
lawyer on her team to advise the buyer about 
these legal issues. The buyer could have sued 
her agent for malpractice. She didn’t, because 
the agent was her “friend.”
With friends like that, the buyer didn’t need any 
enemies. If the Sonoma agent had been a true 
friend, she’d have referred the buyer to a good 
San Francisco agent.
Agents who go out of their area of geographi-
cal or property expertise do so because they’re 
either greedy or just too darn inept to know 
better. Whatever the reason, avoid such agents 
like the plague.

Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Selecting your agent
After you know the glittering generalities of a hypothetical good agent (see 
the previous section), you’re ready to get down to the nitty-gritty specifics of 
choosing an agent of your very own. We strongly recommend that you inter-
view at least three agents before selecting the lucky one.
Finding referral sources
If you have trouble finding three good agents to interview, here are some 
referral sources:
 
✓ Friends, business associates, and members of religious, professional, 
and social organizations to which you belong: In short, anyone you 
know who’s either house hunting or who owns a home in your target 
neighborhood can be a source of agent referrals. Don’t just ask for 
names; find out why these folks liked their agents.
 
✓ Your employer: The company you work for may have a relocation ser-
vice that you can consult.
 
✓ Professionals in related fields: Financial, tax, and legal advisors can be 
good agent-referral sources.
 
✓ The agent who sold your previous home: If you’re a homeowner who’s 
moving into a new area, ask the agent who sold you your home to 
recommend a good agent in that area. Good agents network with one 
another.
 
✓ Sunday open houses: While you’re investigating the houses, check out 
the agents. These agents have already proved (by their open-house 
activity) that they work the neighborhood in which you want to buy.
 
Don’t take any referral, even if it’s from the Pope, as gospel. Most people who 
give referrals have limited or outdated experience with the recommended 
agent. Furthermore, the person making the referral is probably not a real 
estate expert.
Requesting an activity list
After you’ve identified at least three good agents, the fun begins. To avoid a 
misunderstanding, tell each agent that you plan to interview several agents 
before you select the one you’ll work with. Ask each agent to bring to the 
interview a list of every property the agent listed or sold during the preceding 
12 months. This list, called the activity list, is an extremely powerful analytical 
tool.

197
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
 
Here’s what the activity list should include and how you should use the list 
during the interview:
 
✓ Property address: Addresses help you zero in on the agent’s geographi-
cal focus. See for yourself exactly how many properties the agent sold 
and listed in your target neighborhood(s). Eliminate agents who are 
focused outside your area and agents who have no geographical focus.
 
✓ Property type (house, condo, duplex, other): You can use this informa-
tion to determine whether the agent works on the kind of property you 
intend to buy. If, for example, an agent specializes in condos, and you 
want to buy a detached single-family home, you may have a problem.
 
✓ Sales price: Does the agent handle property in your price range? An 
agent who deals in much more or less expensive property than you 
expect to buy may not be the right agent for you. If, for example, you 
plan to spend $150,000, and the least expensive house the agent sold in 
the past year cost $300,000, you have a mismatch. Such agents probably 
won’t spend much time on you because they have bigger fish to fry.
 
✓ Date of sale: Sales activity should be distributed fairly evenly through-
out the year. If it isn’t, find out why. A lack of recent sales activity may 
be because of illness or personal problems that may reduce the agent’s 
effectiveness.
 
✓ Whom the agent represented — seller or buyer: Seasoned agents work 
about half the time with buyers and the other half with sellers. Newer 
agents primarily work with buyers. Avoid agents who work primarily 
with sellers. These agents generally lack either the interest or aptitude 
to work effectively with buyers.
 
✓ Total dollar value of property sold during the preceding 12 months: 
Comparing the three agents’ grand-total property sales is a quick way to 
measure each agent’s individual activity and success. There are, how-
ever, other equally important factors to consider when selecting your 
agent. You don’t necessarily want a “top producer.” These agents get to 
the top by listing and selling large quantities of property. They usually 
don’t have the time or patience to do the hand-holding and education 
you may need, especially if you’re a first-time buyer.
 
✓ Name and current phone numbers of sellers/buyers: You’ll use this 
later to spot-check references.
 
Words whisper; actions thunder. The activity list transforms cheap chatter into 
solid facts. Good agents willingly give you their lists and encourage you to check 
client references. Bad agents don’t want you talking to their unhappy victims. 
Eliminate from consideration any agent who won’t give you a comprehensive 
activity list — she is trying to hide either a lack of sales or unhappy clients.

198
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Interviewing agents
Begin each interview by spending a few minutes analyzing the agent’s activity 
list. After you’ve finished reviewing the list and had time to organize your 
thoughts, get answers to the following questions:
 
✓ Are you a full-time agent? You should have asked this before inviting 
the agent to be interviewed. If you forgot, do it now. Don’t work with 
part-time agents.
 
✓ Whom do you represent? This topic gets back to the fundamental ques-
tion of agency. Is the agent representing you exclusively, or is he a dual 
agent who represents both you and the seller? Be sure that you know 
exactly whom your agent represents at all times.
 
✓ What can you tell me about your office? Discuss office size, staff support, 
market specialization, and reputation. See whether the agent’s broker is 
knowledgeable, is available to you if necessary, and is a good problem-
solver. In a crunch, your transaction’s success (or failure) may depend 
upon the quality of backup support that you and the agent receive.
 
 Don’t put too much weight on the size of the agent’s office. Some excel-
lent agents work as sole practitioners, and other excellent agents prefer 
the synergism and support services of a huge office. Although larger 
offices tend to have more listings, no one office ever has a monopoly on 
the good listings. Quality of service is more important than quantity of 
agents or listings.
 
✓ How long have you been an agent? You want an agent who keeps learn-
ing and growing. After five years in real estate, a good agent has five 
years’ experience, whereas a mediocre agent has one year’s experience 
five times. Time in the saddle is, by itself, no guarantee of competence.
 
✓ Do you have a salesperson’s license or a broker’s license? An agent 
must satisfy more rigorous educational and field-sales experience 
requirements to get a broker’s license. Many fine agents have only a 
salesperson’s license throughout their entire careers. Although a bro-
ker’s license isn’t a guarantee of excellence, good agents often obtain a 
broker’s license to improve their professional skills and to give them-
selves an advantage in agent-selection situations.
 
✓ Do you hold any professional designations? Have you taken any real 
estate classes recently? What do you read to keep current in your 
field? Taking continuing-education courses and reading to stay abreast 
of changes in real estate brokerage are good signs. So is obtaining pro-
fessional designations, such as the GRI (Graduate, Realtor Institute) and 
CRS (Certified Residential Specialist) designations through the National 
Association of Realtors’ study programs. However, credentials in and of 
themselves are no guarantee of competence or ethics.

199
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
 
✓ What is your understanding of my home-buying needs? You’ve probably 
already told the agent what type of property you want to buy, the neigh-
borhood you want to live in, and how much you can spend. See whether 
the agent remembers what you said. If the agent doesn’t remember, watch 
out. You need an agent who listens carefully to what you say.
 
✓ What do you think of the other two agents (name them) whom I’m 
interviewing? To encourage frankness, assure the agents that you won’t 
repeat what they say to you. Good agents don’t build themselves up by 
tearing down other agents. If all three agents are good ones, you won’t 
hear any derogatory comments. However, if one of the agents (or the 
agent’s firm) has a bad reputation in the real estate community, the 
other two agents should tell you. Good or bad, the reputations of your 
agent and the agent’s office rub off on you.
 
✓ How many other buyers and sellers are you currently representing? 
If, for example, the agent holds three listings open every weekend and 
is working with six other buyers to boot, where do you fit in? Although 
some scheduling conflicts are inevitable, you shouldn’t have to contort 
your life to fit the agent’s schedule. A good agent has time to accommo-
date your schedule.
 
✓ Do you work in partnership with another agent or use assistants? 
Some agents team up with another agent to handle buyers and sellers 
jointly. If this is the case, you must interview both agents. Other agents 
delegate time-consuming detail work to their assistants so they them-
selves can focus on critical points in the transaction. If an agent relies 
on such assistants, be sure that the assistants are qualified and that you 
understand exactly how and when during the buying process the agent 
will work directly with you. You don’t want to hire an agent only to find 
that you end up working most of the time with her assistant — whom 
you can’t stand.
 
✓ Is there anything I haven’t asked about you or your firm that you 
think I should know? Perhaps the agent is planning to change firms or 
is leaving next week to take an 80-day trip around the world. Maybe the 
agent’s broker is going out of business. This is the make-sure-that-I-find-
out-everything-I-need-to-know-to-make-a-good-decision question.
Checking agents’ references
Here’s your chance to profit from other people’s mistakes, which is infinitely 
preferable to goofing up yourself. You should have activity lists with the names 
and phone numbers of every buyer and seller that the agents represented 
during the past 12 months. You can pick and choose the people you want 
to call instead of being restricted to a highly selective list of references who 
think that these agents are God’s gift to real estate.

200
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
What’s to prevent agents from culling out their worst transactions? Nothing. 
However, the more deals they delete, the less activity they have to show you — 
and the worse they look when you compare the agents’ overall sales activity.
Suppose that each agent gives you a list containing 50 transactions. Assuming 
one buyer or seller for each transaction, 50 clients per agent times three agents 
interviewed equals 150 phone calls. You’d be on the phone forever!
Good news. You don’t have to call each and every client to check references. 
You can get a pretty darn accurate picture of the agents by making as few as 
six calls per agent.
Here’s a fast, easy way to get a representative sampling of client references:
 
1. Because you’re a buyer, ignore all references from sellers.
 
 Doing so probably slices the list in half.
 
2. Zero in on people who bought property similar in price, location, and 
property type to what you want to buy.
 
3. Call two of those representative buyers who purchased a home about 
12 months ago, another two buyers who bought 6 months ago, and 
two buyers whose escrows closed most recently.
 
 By spreading references over the past year, you can find out whether 
the agent’s level of service has been consistently good.
 
Now that you’ve identified which buyers to call, here’s what to ask when you 
have them on the phone:
 
✓ Is the agent trustworthy? Honest? Did the agent follow through on 
promises? Your agent can’t be even the tiniest bit untrustworthy, dis-
honest, or unreliable. A negative answer to any of these questions is the 
kiss of death.
 
✓ Did the agent have enough time to serve you properly? Was the agent 
available as required to fit your schedule? Occasional scheduling con-
flicts are okay. Frequent conflicts are absolutely, flat-out unacceptable.
 
✓ Did the agent explain everything that happened during the buying 
process clearly and in sufficient detail to satisfy you? What one person 
thinks is sufficient detail may not be nearly enough information for 
another. You know which type of person you are — question agent refer-
ences accordingly.
 
✓ Did the agent set realistic contract deadlines and meet or beat them? 
“Time is of the essence” is a condition of every real estate contract. 
Contract time frames for obtaining a loan, completing property inspec-
tions, and the like are extremely important and must be strictly adhered 

201
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
to, or the deal goes belly-up. Good agents prepare well-written 
contracts with realistic time frames and then ensure that all deadlines 
are met on or before the due dates.
 
✓ Do the words self-starter, committed, and motivated describe the 
agent? No one likes pushy people. But if you’re under pressure to buy 
quickly, the last thing you want is a lethargic agent. You shouldn’t have 
to jab your agent periodically with an electric prod to make sure that 
he’s still breathing. Find out how energetically the agent in question is 
prepared to work.
 
✓ Who found the home you bought — you or the agent? This question is 
a double-check of the agent’s market knowledge. Good agents know not 
only what’s already on the market but also which houses will be coming 
on the market soon. You shouldn’t have to find the house you buy — 
that’s your agent’s job.
 
✓ Did the agent negotiate a good price for your home? See whether the 
agent’s buyers still think that they got a good deal. Good agents are frugal 
when spending their clients’ money. Good agents use their knowledge of 
property values and their negotiating skills to make sure that their clients 
pay the fair market value or less for the homes that they buy. People who 
bought homes six months or a year ago can tell you how well their pur-
chase prices have stood the test of time.
 
✓ Would you use the agent again? This is the ultimate test of customer 
satisfaction. If someone says “no,” find out why not. The negative answer 
may be due to a personality conflict between the buyer and the agent that 
won’t bother you. On the other hand, the negative answer may reveal a 
horrendous flaw that you haven’t yet discovered in the agent.
 
✓ Is there anything I haven’t asked you about the agent or the agent’s 
office that you think I should know? You never know what you’ll find 
out when you ask the famous catchall question.
Making your decision
After analyzing all three agents’ sales activity, interviewing the agents, and 
talking to their buyers, you have most of the facts you need to make an 
informed decision. Here are three final considerations to help you select the 
paragon of virtue that you need on your real estate team:
 
✓ Will you be proud having the agent represent you? People who deal 
with your agent will form opinions of you based upon their impressions 
of your agent. You can’t afford to have anyone on your team who isn’t a 
highly skilled professional.
 
✓ Do you communicate well with the agent? Good agents make sure that 
you completely understand everything they say. If you can’t understand 
your agent, you’re not stupid — the agent is a poor communicator.

202
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
✓ Do you enjoy the agent’s personality? Home buying is stressful, even 
for the coolest of cucumbers. You’ll be sharing some extremely intense 
situations with your agent. Working with an agent you like may transform 
the home-buying process from a horrible experience into an exciting 
adventure — or at least a tolerable transaction.
Getting the most from your agent
After working so hard to find a great agent, it would be a shame to inadver-
tently ruin the relationship. Good buyer/agent relationships aren’t accidental. 
Such relationships are based upon pillars of mutual loyalty and trust that 
develop over time.
Poor relationships, conversely, result from misconceptions of how the game 
is played. Some buyers act in what they think is their best interest, but they 
end up unintentionally harming themselves.
More isn’t always better
One common fallacy is thinking that five agents are five times better than one 
agent. The theory sounds so logical. If you work with agents from a variety 
of offices, you can get better market coverage and first peek at the new list-
ings that each office puts on the market. The more agents you work with, the 
better your chances of quickly finding your dream home.
Things don’t work that way in the real world. When smart agents first meet 
you, they’ll probably ask whether you’re working with any other agents. 
These agents are trying to find out how much you know about the market 
(so they won’t waste time showing you houses that you’ve already seen) and 
learn what you didn’t like about the properties that you saw.
One good agent can quickly show you every home on the market that meets 
your price, neighborhood, size, and condition specifications. If none of the 
houses is what you want, good agents keep looking until the right home hits 
the market. Good agents don’t limit their searches to houses listed by their 
offices. They investigate anything even remotely similar to what you want, 
regardless of which office listed the property. Whether you work with one 
agent or one hundred, you’ll see the same houses.
Agents know that they won’t get paid if you don’t buy. That risk comes with 
the job. What agents hate is losing a sale after months of hard work because 
they called you shortly after another agent called you about the same house. 
That risk is unnecessary. You’re free, of course, to work with as many agents 
as you want. In fact, working with more than one agent makes sense if you’re 
looking for a home in more than one geographic area. Don’t be surprised, 

203
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
however, if good agents in the same area opt out of a horse race. Their odds 
of getting paid for their work increase dramatically when they spend their 
time on buyers who work exclusively with them. Loyalty begets loyalty.
 
The risk of playing the field is rarely worth the reward. One loyal agent totally 
committed to finding you a home is infinitely better than five agents work-
ing for you as a last resort because they consider you just marginally better 
than Benedict Arnold. Like marriages, the best buyer/agent relationships are 
monogamous.
Your agent isn’t the enemy
Another fallacy is viewing your agent as your adversary. True, you don’t want 
to tell your innermost secrets to a loose-lipped agent who blithely blabs them 
to the seller or seller’s agent. Some buyers think that the less their agent 
knows about them, the better. Such buyers believe that after agents know 
why they want to buy and how much cash they have, the agents will some-
how magically manipulate them into spending far more than they can afford 
to spend for the home they eventually buy.
Not true. Good agents ask such questions because they need to be sure that 
you’re financially qualified in order to avoid wasting your time and theirs by 
showing you properties that you can’t afford. If your agent knows that you’re 
under deadline pressure to buy, she’ll give your house hunt top priority.
Buying without an agent
You may see a For Sale by Owner (also known 
as a FSBO — pronounced fiz-bo) or two during 
your home search. The sellers may even 
be friends, neighbors, or work colleagues. 
Because no real estate agent is involved on the 
selling side of a FSBO transaction, the sellers 
don’t have to pay a commission. That shaves 
big bucks off their expenses of sale.
If the FSBO home meets your needs, and you 
found it yourself, you may rightfully wonder 
whether you need an agent to complete the 
deal. After all, if the sellers don’t have to pay 
your agent’s commission, they should be willing 
to sell you the home at a lower price.
Some home buyers have successfully pur-
chased their dream homes without an agent. 
Others have made big boo-boos that way.
If you’re a novice, using an agent usually makes 
sense. Consider the additional value that an 
agent brings to the transaction beyond finding 
you the property, such as negotiating; estimat-
ing market value; and helping coordinate prop-
erty inspections, contingency removals, seller 
disclosures, financing, opening escrow, and 
myriad other details.
You may also consider asking an agent to rep-
resent you for less than the standard 3 percent 
commission because you found the property 
yourself. If you decide not to use an agent, con-
sider hiring an attorney by the hour to review 
the contract and handle the transaction’s 
important legal details.

204
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
Good agents won’t betray your trust. They know that if they take care of you, 
the commission takes care of itself. If you can’t trust your agent, don’t play 
cat-and-mouse games — get a new agent.
Ironically, smart agents fear you as much as or more than you fear them. 
They know that you have the power to make or break their careers. If they 
please you, you’ll be a source of glowing referrals for them. If they upset you, 
you’ll tell everyone you know about the bad job they did.
Use the immense power of potential referrals to manage your relationship 
with the agent. If your agent does a lousy job, don’t get mad — tell the world 
every gory detail of your rotten experience. Nothing ruins an agent’s career 
faster than dissatisfied clients.
Bagging a Broker
Selecting a broker is easy. When you choose an agent, your agent’s broker 
goes along for the ride. It’s a package deal.
If your transaction rolls merrily along from the time your offer is accepted to the 
close of escrow, you probably never meet the broker. But if the engine begins 
to misfire and the wheels start coming off, one guess who you turn to for a 
quick repair job. Brokers are the invisible grease in problematic transactions.
All states issue two markedly different types of real estate licenses: one for 
salespeople (agents) and one for brokers. Agents who have broker’s licenses 
must satisfy much more stringent educational and experience standards than 
agents with a salesperson’s license do.
Your agent may have either type of license. Broker licensees have the option 
either to operate independently or to work for another broker. An agent who 
has a salesperson’s license, on the other hand, must work under a broker’s 
direct supervision so that you have access to the broker’s higher level of 
expertise should you need it.
When Harry Truman was president, he had a sign on his desk that read “The 
buck stops here.” Like Truman, good brokers don’t pass the buck. Here are 
some of their other characteristics:
 
✓ Excellent reputation: The broker’s image, good or bad, will be obvious 
from comments that you hear while checking agent references. You 
want the seller, lender, and all other people involved in your transaction 
working with you because of your broker’s reputation, not in spite of it. 
Buying a home is hard enough without the added burden of having to 

205
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
overcome guilt by association. If an agent’s references disparage the 
agent’s broker, dump the agent.
 
✓ Extensive business relationships: Good brokers develop and maintain 
relationships with the people whom their office deals with — other bro-
kers, lenders, title officers, city officials, and the like. This preexisting res-
ervoir of goodwill is yours to use when the going gets rough. Brokers with 
strong business relationships can work near-miracles for you in a crisis.
 
✓ Strong problem-solving skills: Participants in real estate transactions 
sometimes get highly emotional. When your life savings are on the line, 
you may occasionally lash out at your agent and the other players. 
Someone has to resolve the resulting quarrels and misunderstandings. 
That someone is the broker.
 
The broker’s job is to help solve your problems. Call your broker into the 
game if your agent is stymied by a tough problem or if you’re having trouble 
with your agent. Everything your agent does or fails to do is ultimately the 
broker’s responsibility.
Landing a Lender
Everyone thinks that buying a home is likely to be the largest single purchase 
you’ll ever make. Unless you’re an all-cash buyer, however, everyone is 
wrong. Here’s why.
Suppose that your dream home’s purchase price is $250,000. You make a 20 
percent cash down payment of $50,000 and get a $200,000 fixed-rate loan 
at 7.5 percent interest from your friendly lender. Over the next 30 years, you 
conscientiously repay the loan with payments of about $1,400 a month. (We 
show you in Chapters 3 and 6 how to crunch these numbers for yourself.)
Your 360 monthly loan payments total approximately $500,000. If you originally 
borrowed $200,000, the additional $300,000 you paid is interest on your loan. 
Total interest charges exceed your home’s purchase price!
If you can’t pay, you can’t play. You need a good lender on your team to 
transform you from a home looker into a homeowner. By finding the right 
lender, you can save yourself big bucks over the life of the loan.
No one loan is right for everyone. A person fresh out of college who’s struggling 
to buy a condo with 5 percent cash down has vastly different loan require-
ments than an older, cash-rich couple who put 50 percent cash down on a 
retirement cottage by using equity from the sale of their previous house.

206
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Generations ago, finding the right loan was easy. You could get any kind of 
mortgage you wanted, as long as it was a 30-year, fixed-rate loan. All home 
loans were basically the same except for minor variations in loan fees and 
interest rates.
Those kinder, gentler days of yesteryear are long gone. Today, you’re con-
fronted by a bewildering array of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
programs. In Chapter 6, we take the mystery out of securing a mortgage and 
selecting a lender.
Procuring Property Inspectors
A home’s price is directly related to its physical condition. Homes in top 
shape sell for top dollar. Fixer-uppers sell at greatly reduced prices because 
whoever buys them must spend money on repairs to get them back into pris-
tine condition.
Even if you’re a rocket scientist, you can’t know how much work a house may 
need just by looking at it. You can’t see whether the roof leaks, the electri-
cal system is shockingly defective, the plumbing is shot, the furnace’s heat 
exchanger is cracked, the chimney is loose, or termites are feasting on the 
woodwork. Invisible defects like these cost major money to repair.
Street-smart versus book-smart
Book-smart people have theoretical knowl-
edge. They know only what should happen in 
a perfect world based upon what they’ve read. 
You’re getting book-smart right now.
Street-smart people, conversely, know how 
things work in the real world. They learned the 
hard way through years of hands-on, practical 
experience. A good real estate broker is one 
of the most street-smart people on your home-
buying team.
People learn very little from uneventful, routine 
transactions; they’re like flying a plane on auto-
pilot. Street smarts come from the sweaty-palm 
deals. Fortunately, most agents have only one or 
two of these gut-wrenching messes each year. 
When these turbulent transactions occur, the 
broker takes control of the plane, so to speak.
Because the broker participates directly or indi-
rectly in every deal the office handles, your bro-
ker’s practical experience is directly related to 
the number of agents in the office. A broker who 
manages a 25-agent office, for example, gets 25 
years’ of real estate experience per calendar 
year. Any broker who can survive five years of 
handling all the office’s truly terrible transac-
tions becomes a superb problem-solver out of 
sheer necessity.

207
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
Because you don’t want to inadvertently become the owner of a home with 
such expensive hidden problems, you need property inspectors on your 
team. None of the other players on your team — including real estate agents, 
lenders, and brokers — is qualified to advise you about a house’s physical 
condition or the cost of necessary corrective work. In Chapter 13, we cover 
everything you need to know about property inspections and selecting prop-
erty inspectors.
 
Even though a home isn’t quite as complicated as a space shuttle, it still has 
plenty of expensive systems that can go haywire. “Saving” money by forgo-
ing inspections just because a home appears to be in good condition is a 
false economy. The vast majority of home problems aren’t visible. Never buy 
a house that hasn’t been thoroughly inspected from foundation to roof by a 
qualified inspector of your own choosing.
Electing an Escrow Officer
One common denominator crops up in most every real estate deal: mutual 
distrust. As a buyer, would you give the sellers your hard-earned money 
before every single condition of the sale is satisfied? Not likely. If your posi-
tions were reversed and you were the seller, would you give the buyers the 
title (ownership) to your house before you got their money? No way.
Deals would grind to a halt without something to bridge the gulf of mutual 
buyer-and-seller distrust. Even the simplest transaction involves myriad 
details that must be resolved to everyone’s satisfaction before the sale can 
be completed. That’s why real estate, like other team sports, has a referee.
Your escrow officer is the referee who keeps the game civilized. Strictly speak-
ing, escrow officers aren’t on anyone’s team — they’re neutral. They act as a 
disinterested third party for buyers and sellers without showing favoritism to 
either party.
 
After you and the seller have a signed contract, all the documents, funds, and 
instructions related to your transaction are given to the escrow holder speci-
fied in your purchase agreement. We cover this process, known as opening an 
escrow, in detail in Chapter 14.
Buyers and sellers often select the escrow holder based upon the recommen-
dation of their real estate agents. Depending on where the property you’re 
buying is located, local custom dictates whether your escrow is handled by 
a lawyer, bank, real estate broker, or the firm that issues the title-insurance 
policy.

208
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Escrow fees range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars 
and are based on your property’s purchase price. Once again, local custom 
usually determines whether the buyer or the seller pays for the escrow 
or whether the escrow fees are split fifty-fifty. However, as we discuss in 
Chapter 12, this item is often negotiable.
Finding (Or Forgoing) Financial 
and Tax Advisors
The real estate game is played with real money — your hard-earned cash. 
You’ve likely scrimped, saved, and done without in order to get the cash for 
your down payment. When you sell your house someday, its equity will prob-
ably be a major chunk of your net worth. Either way, buying or selling, you 
have big bucks on the line.
A home purchase has an enormous impact on your personal finances. Before 
you buy a home, you need to understand how a home purchase fits within 
the context of your overall finances and your other goals. Be sure to read 
Chapters 2 and 3, which deal with these important issues.
 
You can elect to hire a financial advisor, but most such titled advisors aren’t 
set up to handle home-buying questions objectively. The reason: Financial 
advisors stand to gain financially from the advice they render. Many so-called 
financial consultants get commissions from the investments they sell you. If 
this is the case, how motivated will they be to advise you to use your cash 
to buy a home rather than an investment from them?! Advisors who manage 
money on a fee (or a percentage) basis have the same conflict of interest.
If you’re going to hire an advisor, use one who works by the hour and doesn’t 
have a vested interest in your home-buying decision. Few financial advi-
sors work on this basis. Although tax advisors are more likely to work on 
this basis, they tend to have a narrower-than-needed financial perspective. 
A competent tax advisor may be able to help you structure the home’s pur-
chase to maximize your tax benefits. For most transactions, however, a tax 
advisor is unnecessary.
If you want to hire a financial or tax advisor, interview several before you 
select one. Check with your agent, banker, lawyer, business associates, and 
friends for referrals. As is the case with selecting your agent, you should get 
client references from each tax advisor and call the references.
 
Here’s what to look for in a good financial or tax advisor:
 
✓ Is this a full-time job for the advisor? The realm of personal finances 
and taxes is too vast for you to trust a part-timer. You need the services 
of a full-time professional.

209
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
 
✓ Does the advisor speak your language? Good advisors can explain your 
financial alternatives in simple terms. If you don’t understand exactly 
what the tax advisor is saying, ask for clarification. If you still don’t 
understand, get another tax advisor. (See the nearby sidebar “Some 
experts give wrong advice.”)
 
✓ Is the advisor objective? Hire someone who works solely by the hour 
and doesn’t have a vested interest in the advice he gives you about 
when to buy and how much to spend.
 
✓ What is the advisor’s fee schedule? Hourly fees vary widely. Don’t pick 
someone strictly on a cost-per-hour basis. An advisor who’s just begin-
ning to practice, for example, may charge only half as much as one with 20 
years’ experience. If the rookie takes four hours to do what the old pro does 
in an hour, which advisor is more expensive in the long run? Furthermore, 
the quality of the seasoned veteran’s advice may be superior to the quality 
of the novice’s advice.
 
✓ Is the tax advisor a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or Enrolled Agent 
(EA)? These professional designations indicate that the tax advisor has 
satisfied special education and experience requirements and has passed a 
rigorous licensing exam. A CPA does general accounting and prepares tax 
returns. An EA focuses specifically on taxation. Only CPAs, EAs, and attor-
neys are authorized to represent you before the IRS in the event of 
an audit.
 
✓ Does the tax advisor have experience with real estate transactions? 
Tax practice, like law or medicine, is an extremely broad field. The tax 
advisors that IBM uses (for example) are undoubtedly wonderful, but 
IBM’s tax advisors aren’t necessarily the best ones for you. You need a 
tax advisor whose clients have tax problems like yours.
 
The best advisors in the world can’t do much to change the financial and tax 
consequences of a transaction after the deal is done. If you’re going to consult 
advisors, do so before you make significant financial decisions. Plan your finan-
cial and tax situation instead of reacting to the consequences after the fact.
Looking for Lawyers
Lawyers are like seat belts: You never know when you may need them. Your 
deal is rolling merrily along when out of nowhere — slam, bam, wham — you 
hit a legal pothole and end up in Sue City.
That real estate purchase agreement you sign is meant to be a legally bind-
ing contract between you and the seller. If you have any questions about the 
legality of your contract, get a lawyer on your team pronto. No one else on the 
team is qualified to give you legal advice.

210
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Here’s what determines whether you need a lawyer on your team:
 
✓ The location of the property you’re buying: In states such as California, 
lawyers rarely work on deals that involve only filling in the blanks on 
a standard, preprinted purchase agreement that has been previously 
reviewed and approved by members of the bar association. In other 
states, such as New York, however, lawyers routinely do everything 
from preparing purchase contracts to closing the escrow. Your agent 
knows the role that lawyers need to play in your locale.
 
✓ The complexity of your transaction: You need a lawyer any time you 
get into a situation that isn’t covered by a standard contract. Unless 
your agent is also a lawyer, she isn’t qualified to do creative legal writing. 
Complicated issues, such as those that frequently arise from partnership 
agreements between unrelated people who buy property together, and 
the complex legal ramifications of taking title to your home should be 
handled by a lawyer. (We get into partnership agreements in Chapter 8 
and taking title in Chapter 14.)
 
✓ When no agent is involved: Say that you’re buying a home that’s being 
offered for sale directly by the owner. If neither you nor the seller has an 
agent, get a lawyer to prepare the contract and have the lawyer do the 
work that an agent would normally handle. Eliminating an agent doesn’t 
eliminate the need for disclosures, inspections, contingency removals, 
and myriad other details involved in the home-buying process.
 
✓ To sleep at night: You may have the world’s easiest deal. Still, if you’d 
feel more comfortable having a lawyer review the contract, your peace 
of mind is certainly worth the cost of an hour or two of legal time.
Selecting your lawyer
If, for whatever reason, you decide that you need a lawyer, interview several 
before making your selection. Law, like medicine, is highly specialized. A 
corporate attorney or the lawyer who handled your neighbor’s divorce isn’t 
the best choice for your real estate team. Get a lawyer who specializes in 
residential real estate transactions. Your agent and broker are excellent refer-
ral sources because they work with real estate lawyers all the time in their 
transactions.
A good lawyer:
 
✓ Is a full-time lawyer and licensed to practice law in your state: Of 
course.
 
✓ Is local talent: Real estate law, like real estate brokerage, is extremely 
provincial. The law varies not only from state to state but also from one 
area to another within the same state. Rent-control laws, condominium-
conversion statutes, and zoning codes, for example, are usually passed 

211
 Chapter 9: Assembling an All-Star Real Estate Team
by city or county governing agencies. A good local lawyer knows the 
laws and has working relationships with people who administer those 
laws in your area.
 
✓ Has a realistic fee schedule: Lawyers’ fees vary widely. A good lawyer 
gives you an estimate of how much handling your situation will cost. As 
with financial and tax advisors, the experience factor comes into play. 
Seasoned lawyers generally charge higher hourly fees than novice law-
yers, but seasoned lawyers also tend to get a lot more done in an hour 
than inexperienced lawyers can. A low rate is no bargain if the novice is 
learning on your nickel.
 
✓ Has a good track record: If your case may go to trial, find out whether 
the lawyer has courtroom experience. Some lawyers don’t do trial work. 
Then ask about the lawyer’s track record of wins versus losses. What 
good is a lawyer with a great deal of trial experience if that lawyer has 
never won a case?
 
✓ Is a deal-maker or a deal-breaker (whichever is appropriate): Some law-
yers are great at putting deals together. Others specialize in blowing them 
out of the water. Each skill is important. Good deal-makers, however, 
aren’t always equally good deal-breakers, and vice versa. Depending on 
whether you want the lawyer to get you out of a deal or keep it together, 
be sure that you have the right type of lawyer for your situation.
 
 If your lawyer’s only solution to every problem is a lawsuit, you may be 
in the clutches of a deal-breaker who wants to run up big legal fees. Find 
another lawyer!
 
✓ Speaks your language: Good lawyers explain your options clearly and 
concisely without resorting to incomprehensible legalese. Then they 
give you a risk assessment of your options to help you make a sound 
decision. For example, the lawyer may say that your first course of 
action will take longer but will give you a 90 percent chance of success, 
but the faster option gives you only a 50 percent chance of prevailing.
Getting the most out of a lawyer
Whoever said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure must 
have been thinking of lawyers. A two-hour preventive consultation with your 
lawyer is infinitely better than a two-month trial that may take place just 
because you “saved” money by avoiding a consulting fee.
 
If you’re not sure whether you need a lawyer, Chapter 12 contains a clause 
you can put in your contract to get out of any deal that isn’t approved by your 
lawyer. You don’t actually need to get a lawyer if you use this clause; it just gives 
you the option to have the contract reviewed later by a lawyer if you want.

212
Par t III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Good lawyers are strategists. Given adequate lead time, they can structure 
nearly any deal to your advantage. Conversely, if you bring wonderful law-
yers into the game after the deal is done, all they can do is damage control. 
The best defense is a good offense.
 
Beware of the legal awe factor. Some people hold lawyers in awe because 
their word is viewed as law. Disobey lawyers, they think, and you’ll go to jail. 
Baloney. Don’t blindly follow your lawyer’s advice. If you don’t understand 
the advice or if you disagree with it, question it. You may be correct, and the 
lawyer may be wrong. Lawyers are every bit as fallible as everyone else.
Some experts give wrong advice
Ray wasn’t very sophisticated about tax advi-
sors when he moved to San Francisco. Several 
people whom he worked with suggested that he 
use their tax advisor. He selected her based on 
their recommendations (plus the fact that her 
office was only two blocks away from his).
Ray knew he’d made a mistake when he went 
over to her office to review the tax return she’d 
prepared for him. He asked her how she had 
arrived at the itemized deductions for auto 
expenses and professional training. In both 
cases, they were much higher than the totals of 
the receipts Ray had given her.
She explained that these higher deductions 
reduced his tax bite and said no one would 
question the deductions because they were 
within acceptable IRS guidelines. Ray still didn’t 
understand her concept of deducting more 
money than he had spent.
Ray’s tax advisor rather impatiently went 
through the tax return again, speaking more 
slowly and using smaller words the second 
time. She concluded by saying he shouldn’t 
worry about what she’d done because every-
one overstates expenses.
Ray knew that she was speaking English 
because he recognized nearly all the words, but 
they seemed to be bouncing off his forehead 
without penetrating his brain. He was getting 
more and more frustrated. His tax advisor was 
getting later and later for her next appointment. 
In desperation, she finally gave Ray the return 
and sent him home like a schoolboy to “think 
it over.”
He did.
Ray decided the problem wasn’t that he was 
stupid. The problem was that he’d been given 
unethical advice. In her zeal to save Ray money, 
the tax advisor had falsified his deductions. 
That falsification was wrong. Worse, it was 
illegal. Ray solved the problem by getting a new 
tax advisor.
Never blindly follow the advice of experts 
because you’re in awe of their expertise. Experts 
can be just as wrong as ordinary mortals.

Chapter 10
What’s It Worth?
In This Chapter
▶ Becoming an educated buyer
▶ Determining the value of homes
▶ Red flagging overpriced houses
▶ Protecting yourself from overpaying
Y
ou see a home for sale. The asking price is $249,500. Is that charming 
cottage a steal or an overpriced turkey?
If you don’t have the faintest idea, don’t worry — that’s normal. Most 
buyers don’t know property values when they start hunting for a home. To 
become an educated buyer, you need to take time to familiarize yourself 
with property values.
When Ray began his real estate career, he spent dozens of hours each 
week looking at houses. Like all new agents, his appetite for property was 
boundless and indiscriminate — big houses, tiny condos, old property and 
new, houses in pristine condition or fixer-uppers, uptown, downtown, and 
midtown. If it had a roof and a For Sale sign, Ray toured the property inside 
and out.
Why? The best way to learn property values is to eyeball as many houses as 
possible and then monitor them until they sell. That’s how agents educate 
themselves.
 
You don’t need to see every house in town to get educated. A good agent can 
accelerate your learning curve by playing the real estate version of show 
and tell. You have to tour only houses that meet your specific wish list for 
budget, style, size, and neighborhood. After seeing no more than a dozen 
houses comparable to your dream home, you should be an educated buyer.
Don’t be surprised if you’re utterly confused after a day spent looking at 
property for sale. When you see six or seven houses in rapid succession, it’s 
challenging to remember which one had the wonderful kitchen and which 
one had the huge backyard with a swing set. To make your property tours 
most productive, follow these tips:

214
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
✓ Take notes. You’ll probably get a listing statement (those one-page, 
house-for-sale advertisements/marketing pieces), brochure, or Multiple 
Listing Service fact sheet describing each property you visit. To help 
you remember the house, make notes directly on your information sheet 
regarding distinguishing features such as a sunken living room, a crazy 
floor plan, or a location near a commuter rail stop.
 
✓ Review the tour. After you finish for the day, discuss the houses you 
saw with your real estate agent (if you have one). If your memory is 
fuzzy about a property or two that you visited, your agent can probably 
fill in the details.
 
✓ Save the info sheets. As you’ll see when you read the “Determining 
Fair Market Value: Comparable Market Analysis” section later in this 
chapter, sale prices are mighty important negotiating tools. Ask your 
agent (or the listing agent, if you don’t have an agent) to tell you when 
a house you toured sells and how much it sold for. Mark the sale price 
and date of sale on your info sheet for future reference.
The Three Elusive Components of Worth
Oscar Wilde said a cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and 
the value of nothing. In the real estate game, neither cost nor price is the same 
as value. When you understand what these words mean and how they differ, 
you can replace emotion with objectivity when looking at houses and during 
price negotiations after you finally make an offer. Out-facting people usually 
beats trying to out-argue them.
Value is a moving target
 
Value is your opinion of what a particular home is worth to you, based on how 
you intend to use it now and in the future. Value isn’t carved in stone; on the 
contrary, it’s pretty darn elusive.
For one thing, opinions are subjective. We, your humble authors, may think 
that we resemble Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. You, on the other hand, 
are of the opinion that we look like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi — in full 
monster makeup. No harm done, as long as we all realize that a big difference 
exists between subjective opinions and objective facts.
Furthermore, internal factors — things related to your personal situation — 
have a sneaky way of changing over time. Suppose that you currently place 
great value on a home with four bedrooms and a large, fenced-in backyard. 
The home must be located in a town with a good school system. Why? 
Because you have young children.

215
 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
Twenty years from now, when the kids are grown and have moved out (you 
hope!), you may decide to sell the house. Why? Because you no longer need 
such a big home. Neither the house nor the school system changed — what 
changed were internal factors regarding your use for the property, and thus 
its value to you.
External factors are things outside your control that affect property values. 
If your commute time is cut in half because mass-transit rail service is 
extended into your neighborhood after you buy your home, your home’s 
value may increase. If a garbage dump is built next door to you, you’ll have 
a big problem getting top dollar for your house when you sell it.
 
The law of supply and demand is another external factor that affects value. 
If more people want to buy than sell, buyer competition drives home prices 
up. Conversely, if more people want to sell than buy, home prices drop. 
See Chapter 4 for a complete explanation of all the factors that influence 
home prices.
Cost is yesterday
Cost measures past expenditures — for example, what the sellers paid when 
they bought their house. What the sellers originally paid or how much they 
spent fixing up the house after they bought it doesn’t mean diddlypoo as 
far as a house’s present or future value is concerned. That was then, and this 
is now.
For example, when home prices skyrocketed in most parts of both coasts 
during the latter half of the 1990s and into the mid-2000s, some buyers 
accused sellers of being greedy. “You paid $400,000 seven years ago. Now 
you’re asking $850,000,” they said. “If you get your price, you’ll make an 
obscenely large profit.”
“So what?” sellers replied compassionately. “If you don’t want to pay our 
modest asking price, move out of the way so those nice buyers standing 
behind you can present their offer.” In a hot seller’s market, people who 
base their offering price on what sellers originally paid for property waste 
everyone’s time.
However, the market doesn’t always go in the same direction forever. In the 
early 1990s and again in the late 2000s, for example, prices declined in many 
areas. Sellers would’ve been ecstatic to find buyers willing to pay them what 
they paid five years earlier, when home prices peaked.

216
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Uneducated buyers are inadvertent liars
Ray has only to look into a mirror to see the per-
fect prototype of a lying, uneducated buyer. Like 
all buyers, Ray honestly believed he was telling 
his agent the truth when he and his sweet wife, 
Annie B., began looking for a home in the wine 
country about 50 miles north of San Francisco. 
When they first met their agent, Beverly Mueller, 
Ray wasted no time establishing the ground 
rules of the house hunt.
“We don’t need the Taj Mahal,” Ray told Beverly. 
“I’m in the real estate army, not a civilian like 
your other buyers. Trust me when I tell you that 
$300,000 is the flat-out, absolute upper limit of 
what we’ll spend.”
“I understand, Ray. We’ll only look at places 
under $300,000,” Beverly said.
And look they did. Over the next several months, 
Beverly showed them every house in their price 
range on the market in the Sonoma Valley. 
Ray and Annie rejected each and every one. 
Either they liked the land and hated the house, 
or vice versa. They were ready to give up when 
they got lucky.
Ray and Annie found Woodpecker Haven, the 
home they ended up buying in Glen Ellen, thanks 
to Karen and Herman Isman, friends of theirs 
who were also working with Beverly. Karen and 
Annie drove from San Francisco to Glen Ellen 
together to see a house that Beverly thought the 
Ismans would like. It was love at first sight — 
not for Karen, but for Annie.
Why hadn’t Beverly shown Ray and Annie 
the house? Because its asking price was 
$390,000 — far more than the $300,000 ceiling 
Ray imposed. Beverly’s mistake was believing 
what Ray told her when they first met.
Why did Ray lie? He didn’t intend to. Had he and 
Annie found what they wanted for less than 
$300,000, Ray would’ve been telling the truth. 
Only after three months of looking at property 
did it become clear that what Ray and Annie 
wanted to spend and what they wanted to live in 
were totally out of whack with market reality.
Many buyers hit the same wall sooner or later 
during their education process. Ray and Annie 
belatedly realized that they had to make trade-
offs — either reduce their expectations to 
fit their budget or expand their budget until it 
satisfied their expectations.
That was when they became educated buyers. 
They were finally realistic enough to make tough 
decisions.
What Ray and Annie experienced happens to 
most people. For example, you ruefully decide 
that either the swimming pool or the family room 
has to go because you can’t afford a home that 
has both and still buy in the neighborhood you 
like. Or perhaps you opt to keep your wish list 
intact and buy in a slightly less wonderful neigh-
borhood. Something has to give when you’re 
forced to confront reality.
The other alternative is expanding your buying 
power. Much as you’d like the security of a 
30-year fixed-rate loan, you decide to get an 
adjustable-rate mortgage instead because the 
ARM allows you to qualify for a bigger loan. 
Much as you’d like to buy without financial 
assistance from your parents, you swallow your 
pride and ask them for a loan. Again, something 
has to give.
Groucho Marx once said he’d never belong to 
any club that would have him as a member. 
Paraphrasing Groucho, most folks would rather 
not settle for the house they can afford if, by 
stretching themselves a bit, they can buy their 
dream home.

 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
Price is what it’s worth today
Sellers have asking prices on their houses. Buyers put offering prices in their 
contracts. Buyers and sellers negotiate back and forth to establish purchase 
prices. Today’s purchase price is tomorrow’s cost. Is the purchase price a 
good value? That depends.
You may get a bargain if you find a house owned by people who don’t know 
property values or who must sell quickly because of an adverse life change 
such as divorce, job loss, or a death in the family. Folks who don’t have time 
to sit around waiting for buyers willing to pay top dollar usually take a hit 
when they sell. Time is the seller’s enemy and the buyer’s pal.
If, however, you must buy quickly to relocate for a new job or to get your kids 
settled before school starts, watch out. You could overpay because you don’t 
have enough time to search for a good deal.
 
Cost is the past, price is the present, and value (like beauty) is in the eyes of 
the beholder. What the sellers paid for their house years ago, or what they’d 
like to get for it today, doesn’t matter. Don’t squander your hard-earned 
money on an overpriced house to satisfy a seller’s unrealistic fantasy.
Fair Market Value
Natural disasters aside, every home will sell at the right price. That price is 
defined as its fair market value (FMV) — the price a buyer will pay and a 
seller will accept for the house, given that neither buyer nor seller is under 
duress. Duress can come from life changes such as major health problems, 
divorce, or sudden job transfer, which put either the buyers or sellers under 
pressure to perform quickly. If appraisers know that a sale is made under 
duress, they raise or lower the sale price accordingly to more accurately 
reflect the house’s true fair market value.
Fair market value is more powerful than plain old value. As a buyer, you have 
an opinion of what the house is worth to you. The sellers have a separate, not 
necessarily equal (and probably higher) opinion of their home’s value. These 
values are opinions, not facts. You can’t bank opinions.
 
Unlike value, fair market value is fact. It becomes a fact when buyers and 
sellers agree upon a mutually acceptable price. Just as it takes two to tango, it 
takes a buyer and a seller to make fair market value. Facts are bankable.

218
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
When fair market value isn’t fair — 
need-based pricing
Whenever the real estate market gets all soft and mushy, many would-be sell-
ers feel that fair market value isn’t fair at all. “Why doesn’t our house sell?” 
they ask. “Why can’t we get our asking price? It’s not fair.”
 
Don’t let your highly developed sense of fair play make a sucker out of you. 
Sellers frequently confuse “fair” with “impartial.” Despite its friendly name, fair 
market value isn’t a warm, cuddly fairy godmother. On the contrary, it can be 
heartless and cruel. Need isn’t a component of fair market value. Fair market 
value doesn’t care about any of the following:
 
✓ How much the sellers need because they overpaid for their house when 
they bought it
 
✓ How much the sellers need to recover the money they spent fixing up 
their house after they bought it
 
✓ How much money the sellers need to pay off their loan
 
✓ How much money the sellers need from the sale to buy their next 
humble abode: Buckingham Palace
“Can’t sell” versus “won’t sell”
Two weeks of extraordinarily heavy winter rain 
undermined the soil of a subdivision in the 
Anaheim Hills area of Los Angeles. After this 
drenching, homes in the 25-acre development 
began slipping downhill at the rate of about 1 
inch a day.
Home foundations and swimming pools 
cracked. Streets and sidewalks buckled. Local 
authorities finally ordered everyone in the 
subdivision to evacuate their homes until the 
ground stabilized.
Unlike most frustrated sellers we know, these 
folks really couldn’t sell their homes. Forces of 
nature beyond their control reduced their 
houses’ value to zero. Other than salvage value, 
no market exists for unintentionally mobile 
homes.
Fortunately, most homeowners who claim 
that they “can’t” sell their houses don’t 
have this problem. They aren’t disaster 
victims whose homes are suddenly rendered 
valueless by an act of God. On the contrary, 
they have buyers galore for their houses, as 
well as scads of lenders who’d make loans to 
those buyers.
If nothing is wrong with their houses, what’s 
the problem? The homeowners. The problem 
isn’t that they can’t sell. These homeowners 
won’t sell.
As long as homeowners choose not to accept 
what buyers are willing to pay for their houses, 
they won’t sell — and those houses will remain 
on the market at their inflated asking prices. 
It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. As a prospective 
home buyer, beware of such greedy, unrealistic 
sellers.

219
 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
Here’s why a seller’s need-based pricing doesn’t enter into fair market value. 
Suppose that two identical houses next door to each other are listed for sale. 
One house was purchased for $32,000 three decades ago. The other house 
sold a couple of years ago for $320,000, soon after home prices peaked in the 
area. The first home has no outstanding loan on it. The other still has a big 
mortgage.
Bill and Mary, who own the house purchased two years ago, need more 
money than Ed, owner of the house purchased thirty years ago. After all, 
they paid ten times as much as Ed for their house, and they owe the bank 
big bucks to pay off their mortgage.
Because the houses are basically identical in size, age, condition, and loca-
tion, they have the same fair market value. Not surprisingly, they both 
sell for $275,000. That gives Ed a nice nest egg for retirement but barely 
pays off Mary and Bill’s mortgage. Fair? Ed thinks so. Bill and Mary don’t.
Fair market value is brutally impartial. It is what it is — not what buyers or 
sellers want it to be.
Median home prices versus 
fair market value
Some folks think that median sale prices for homes indicate fair market 
values. They don’t.
 
Organizations such as the National Association of Realtors, the chamber of 
commerce, and private research firms such as MDA DataQuick generate 
median sale-price statistics by monitoring home sales in a specific geographic 
region such as a city, county, or state. One function of these organizations is 
to gather market-research data on home-sales activity.
There’s nothing magical about the median sale price. It’s simply the midpoint 
in a range of all the home sales for a reporting period. Half the sales during 
the reporting period fall above the median, and half fall below it. The median-
price home, in other words, is the one exactly in the middle of the prices of 
all the houses that sold.
When this book went to press, the median sale price of a home in America 
was about $180,000, which tells you that half the homes in America sold for 
more than $180,000, and half sold for less than $180,000. Unfortunately, all 
you know about this hypothetical median-price home is its price.
You don’t know how many bedrooms or baths the median-price home has. 
Nor do you know how many square feet of interior living space the house 
has, how old it is, or whether it has a garage or a yard. You don’t even 
know where this elusive median-price house is located, other than that it’s 
somewhere in the United States.

220
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
If median-price information is so vague, why bother with it? Because it tells 
you two important things:
 
✓ Price trends: If the median price of a home in America was $140,000 
ten years ago and is $180,000 now, you know home prices in general 
are rising. You don’t know why median prices are going up, just that 
they are. 
 
✓ Price relativity: If the median-price home in Yakima, Washington, sells 
for $185,000 versus $550,000 for the median-price Honolulu home, 
you know that you’ll get a much bigger bang for your housing buck in 
Yakima. Honolulu has many excellent qualities, but cheap housing isn’t 
one of them.
Median-home-price statistics make interesting reading, but they aren’t any 
more accurate for determining specific home values than median-income 
statistics are for determining how much you’ll earn from your next employer. 
You need much more precise property-value information before you invest 
a major chunk of your life’s savings in a home.
 
You’ll find a graph showing U.S. median home prices from 1963 to the present 
in Chapter 4. Note that they declined during the late 2000s because of a weak 
housing market and a large increase in foreclosures. Foreclosures distort 
regional statistics if counties with a large number of foreclosures are lumped 
together with other counties that have relatively few foreclosures but are in 
the same statistical market area. No single report gives a truly comprehensive 
snapshot of any market.
 
Chapter 3 can help you determine how much you can afford to spend on a 
home. You can find some Web sites in Chapter 11 that you can use to locate 
affordable areas by comparing median home prices on a town-by-town and 
neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. When median-price statistics indicate 
that home prices are rising or falling sharply in an area, find out why by read-
ing and talking to players on your real estate team, such as your agent.
Determining Fair Market Value: 
Comparable Market Analysis
Believe it or not, houses are like Red Delicious apples. Most houses are green 
and need more time on the real estate tree before they’re ready to pick. A few 
are ripe for picking right now. The trick is knowing which is which, because 
houses don’t turn red as they ripen.
That’s one reason you must understand fair market value and know the 
asking prices and sale prices of houses comparable to the one you want to 
buy. Smart home buyers know which houses are green and which are ripe.

221
 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
The basics of a helpful CMA
The best way to accurately determine a home’s fair market value is to pre-
pare a written comparable market analysis (CMA). A competent real estate 
agent can and should prepare a CMA for a home that you’re interested in 
before you make your purchase offer. Every residential real estate office has 
its own CMA format. No matter how the information is presented to you, 
Tables 10-1 and 10-2 show you what good CMAs contain.

These are facts. The CMA’s “Recent Sales” section helps establish the 
fair market value of 220 Oak — your dream home that’s currently on the 
market — by comparing it with all the other houses that:
 
✓ Are located in the same neighborhood
 
✓ Are approximately the same age, size, and condition
 
✓ Have sold in the past six months

222
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
These houses are called comps, which is short for comparables. Depending on 
when you began your house hunt, you probably haven’t actually toured all 
the sold comps. No problem. A good real estate agent can show you listing 
statements for the houses you haven’t seen, take you on a verbal tour of the 
properties, and explain how each one compares with your dream home.
 
Communicating well with your agent about subjective terms such as large, lots 
of light, close to school, and so on is critically important. You must understand 
precisely what the agent means when using such terms. Conversely, your 
agent must understand precisely what you want, need, and can afford.
If you and your agent were to analyze the sale comps in our example, you 
would find that houses comparable to the home you want to buy — 220 Oak, 
in Table 10-2 — are selling for slightly over $200 per square foot. Putting the 
sale prices into a price-per-square-foot basis makes comparisons much 
easier. As you can see in Table 10-2, anything that’s way above or below the 
norm really leaps out at you.

The “Currently for Sale” section of the CMA compares your dream home 
(in this case, 220 Oak) with neighborhood comps that are currently on the 
market. These comps are included in the analysis to check price trends:
 
✓ If prices are falling: Asking prices of houses on the market today will be 
lower than sale prices of comparable houses.
 
✓ If prices are rising: You’ll see higher asking prices today than for comps 
sold three to six months ago.
If you’ve been looking at houses in a specific area for a while, you’ve probably 
been in all the comps currently on the market in that area. You don’t need 
anyone to tell you what you’ve seen with your own eyes. However, you do 
need an agent’s help to compare the comps you’ve seen with comps you 
haven’t seen, because some houses sold before you began your house hunt.
As Table 10-2 shows, your dream house appears to be priced very close 
to its fair market value based on the actual sale price of 210 Oak (in 
Table 10-1). Given that 220 Oak has 1,880 square feet, it’s worth $392,920 
at $209 per square foot. Factually establishing property value is easy once 
you know how.

224
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
Your CMA must be comprehensive. It should include all comp sales in the past 
six months and all comps currently on the market. Getting an accurate picture 
of fair market values is more difficult if some parts of the puzzle are missing, 
especially in a neighborhood where homes don’t sell frequently.
Like milk in your refrigerator, comps have expiration dates. Lenders usually 
won’t accept houses that sold more than six months ago as comps. Their 
sale prices don’t reflect current consumer confidence, business conditions, 
or mortgage rates. As a general rule, the older the comp, the less likely that it 
represents today’s fair market value.
Six months is generally accepted as long enough to have a good cross section 
of comp sales but short enough to have fairly consistent market conditions. 
But six months isn’t carved in stone. If a major economic calamity occurred 
three months ago, for example, then six months is too long for a valid com-
parison. Conversely, if homes in a certain area rarely sell, you may need to 
examine comparable sales that occurred more than six months ago.
 
Sale prices are always given far more weight than asking prices when deter-
mining fair market value. Sellers can ask whatever they want for their houses; 
asking prices are sometimes fantasy. Sale prices are always facts — they 
indicate fair market value. The best proof of what a house is worth is its sale 
price. Don’t guess — analyze the sale of comparable homes. Be sure that the 
comparable sales information factors in price reductions or large credits given 
for corrective work repairs (for example, a $5,000 credit from the sellers to the 
buyers to replace a broken furnace).
The flaws of CMAs
CMAs beat the heck out of median-price statistics for establishing fair market 
values, but even CMAs aren’t perfect. We’ve seen people use exactly the 
same comps and arrive at very different opinions of fair market value. 
Discrepancies creep into the CMA process if you blindly compare comps 
without knowing all the following details of the subject properties:
 
✓ Wear and tear: No two homes are the same after they’ve been lived in. 
Suppose that two identical tract homes are located next door to each 
other. One, owned by an older couple with no children or pets, is in 
pristine condition. The other, owned by a family with several small kids 
and several large dogs, resembles a federal disaster area. Your guess 
is as good as ours when figuring out how much it’ll cost to repair the 
wear-and-tear damage in the second house. A good comparable analysis 
adjusts for this difference between the two homes.

225
 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
 
✓ Site differences within a neighborhood: Even though all the comps 
are in the same neighborhood, they aren’t located on precisely the 
same plot of ground. How much is being located next to the beautiful 
park worth? How much will you pay to be seven minutes closer to 
the commuter-train stop? These value adjustments are a smidge less 
precise than brain surgery.
 
✓ Out-of-neighborhood comps: Suppose that in the past six months, no 
homes were sold in the neighborhood where you want to live. Going 
into another neighborhood to find comps means that you and your 
agent must make value adjustments between two different neighbor-
hoods’ amenities (schools, shopping, transportation, and so on). 
Comparing different neighborhoods is far more difficult than making 
value adjustments within the same neighborhood.
 
✓ Noncomp home sales: What if five houses sold in the neighborhood in 
the past six months, but none of them were even remotely comparable 
in age, size, style, or condition to the house you want to buy? You 
and your agent must estimate value differences for three- versus four-
bedroom homes, old versus new kitchens, small versus large yards, 
garage versus carport, and so on. If the home you want has a panoramic 
view and none of the other houses has any view at all, how much does 
the view increase the home’s value? Guesstimates like these don’t put 
astronauts on the moon.
These variables aren’t insurmountable obstacles to establishing your dream 
home’s fair market value. They do, however, greatly increase the margin of 
error when trying to determine a realistic offering price. You can minimize 
pricing problems created by these variables if you and/or your agent actually 
tour comparable homes inside and out.
 
A valid comparison of your dream home to the other houses is impossible if 
you and your agent have only read about the comps in listing statements 
(brief data sheets about houses offered for sale) or seen the properties on a 
Web site. Here’s why:
 
✓ Most listing statements are overblown to greater or lesser degrees. 
You don’t know how exaggerated the statement is if you haven’t seen 
the house for yourself. You may consider the “large” master bedroom 
tiny. That “gourmet” kitchen’s only distinction may be an especially 
fancy hot plate. The “sweeping” view from the living room may exist 
only if you’re as tall as Michael Jordan. Of course, you won’t know any of 
these things if you only read the houses’ puff sheets instead of visiting 
them in person.

226
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
 
✓ Floor plans greatly affect a home’s value. Two houses, for example, 
may be approximately the same size, age, and condition, yet vary wildly 
in value. One house’s floor plan flows beautifully from room to room; 
the rooms themselves are well-proportioned, with high ceilings. The 
other house doesn’t work well because its floor plan is choppy and the 
ceilings are low. You can’t tell which is which just by reading the two 
listing statements.
 
✓ Whoever controls the camera controls what you see. Remember 
when viewing those stunning color photos or video footage of a house 
advertised on a Web site that you’re permitted to see only what the 
person who took the pictures wants you to see. You certainly won’t get 
a peek at less desirable things, such as worn areas on the living room 
carpet or graffiti sprayed on the garage door of the house next door.
 
Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeballing — personally touring houses and noting 
important details both inside and out with your own eyes — is the best way to 
decide which houses are true comps for your dream home.
Getting a Second Opinion: 
Appraisals versus CMAs
If you’re in no rush to submit an offer and you’re the suspicious type, you can 
double-check the opinion of value that you and your agent arrive at before 
making an offer on your dream home. You can pay several hundred dollars to 
get a professional appraisal of the house.
Getting an unbiased second opinion of value is always reassuring. An 
appraiser won’t tell you what you want to hear just to make a sale. The 
appraiser isn’t trying to sell you anything. Whether you buy the house or 
not, the appraiser gets paid.
 
Unfortunately, the fact that the appraiser charges a fee regardless of whether 
you buy the house cuts both ways. Suppose that you and the sellers can’t 
reach an agreement on price and terms of sale because the sellers are 
deluded. Even if your offer isn’t accepted, you still get a bill from the 
appraiser. Paying for appraisals or property inspections before your offer is 
accepted generally isn’t wise.
If you think a professional appraisal is vastly superior to your agent’s opinion 
of value, think again. A good agent’s CMA is usually as creditable as an 
appraisal. Conversely, if a professional appraisal is vastly superior because 
your agent is a lousy judge of property values, you should get a better agent 
(we show you how in Chapter 9).

227
 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
In any given geographical area, appraisers usually don’t eyeball nearly as 
many houses as agents who concentrate on that area. Appraisers aren’t lazy; 
they use their time in other ways.
Formal appraisals are time-consuming. An appraiser inspects the property 
from foundation to attic, measures its square footage, makes detailed 
notes regarding everything from the quality of construction to the amount 
of wear and tear, photographs the house inside and out, photographs 
comps for the house being appraised, writes up the appraisal, and so on. 
Agents can tour 15 to 20 houses in the time it takes an appraiser to complete 
one appraisal.
Because touring properties is so time-consuming, because good agents are 
already doing the legwork, and because it’s usually impossible to tour a 
home after the sale has been completed, appraisers frequently call agents to 
get information about houses the agents have listed or sold that may be 
comps. No matter how good an agent’s description of the house is, however, 
personally touring the property is still best. Any appraisal’s accuracy is 
reduced somewhat whenever the appraisal is based on comps the appraiser 
hasn’t seen.
Agents also call one another about houses they haven’t seen, so don’t think 
that appraisers are the only ones who dial for info. However, remember that 
you’re relying on your agent’s local market knowledge to help you determine 
what a home is worth. If your agent hasn’t seen most of the comps used in 
your CMA, get an agent who knows the market.
 
Unless you’re pretty darn unsure about a property’s value and willing to 
spend the money whether or not the deal goes through, don’t waste money on 
a precontract appraisal.
Why Buyers and Sellers 
Often Start Far Apart
The average buyer may be brighter than the average seller. How else can 
you explain why buyers are generally so much more realistic about property 
prices?
It’s not as though there are two different real estate markets: an expensive 
one for sellers and a cheap one for buyers. Sellers have access to exactly the 
same comps that buyers do. Yet buyers’ initial offering prices tend to be far 
more realistic than sellers’ initial asking prices. Why? Figure 10-1 may offer 
some insight into that question.

Fair market value
Some people believe that the selfish interests of buyers and sellers force 
them to approach a house’s fair market value from opposite directions. 
Buyers bring their offering price up to fair market value because they don’t 
want to overpay. Sellers ratchet their price down to fair market value because 
they hate the thought of leaving any money on the table.
That’s logical but simplistic. This reasoning still doesn’t explain why many 
sellers initially tend to be so much more unrealistic than buyers.
The better you understand the warped thought processes of these sellers, 
the better you can handle their unreasonable objections to your eminently 
fair offer. To that end, here are the common causes of absurdly high 
asking prices.
Inept agents
Just because you use the information in Chapter 9 to select a great agent 
doesn’t mean that everyone will. In fact, many people do a rotten job of 
picking an agent.
Perhaps the sellers’ agent is an incompetent boob who doesn’t know 
anything about property values. Those poor misguided sellers didn’t 
put a smart asking price on their house because their agent gave them 
lousy advice.
When your agent discovers that the other agent is inept — either by the 
poor quality of the comps that the sellers’ agent used to establish the asking 
price or by reputation (these things get around in the real estate brokerage 
community) — what can you do? That depends.

229
 Chapter 10: What’s It Worth?
If the house has been on the market for a month or two and the sellers are 
open to reason, your agent’s brilliant comps will prevail over their agent’s 
fantasy pricing. The sellers will grasp the concept of fair market value and 
either gratefully accept your offer or make a modest counteroffer because 
your offering price is so logical, realistic, and fair.
You have a problem, however, if their house just came on the market. The 
sellers probably won’t believe anything you and your agent say about the 
asking price being too high. They’ll discount your opinion of their house’s 
fair market value because they suspect that you’re trying to steal their home. 
They’ll be nearly as suspicious of a formal appraisal done by your hand-
picked appraiser.
Bidding wars
When house sellers select an agent, the inter-
viewing process may go awry. Bidding wars 
often develop among the agents competing to 
list a seller’s house for sale. The concept of fair 
market value is the bidding war’s first victim. If 
you try to buy such a house, you could be the 
second victim. Here’s what happens when a 
seller interviews agents:
“Thanks for giving me an opportunity to list your 
lovely house, Mr. and Mrs. Seller,” the first 
agent says. “As you can see by reviewing the 
CMA, my fair market value analysis indicates 
that eight houses sold in your neighborhood in 
the past six months. Three of them were signifi-
cantly larger than yours, so they can’t be used 
as comps. The five houses comparable to yours 
in size, age, location, and condition sold in the 
range of $350,000 to $370,000. Based on their 
sale prices, I recommend an asking price of 
$375,000.”
Now the second agent strikes. “Who cares 
what the comps indicate? Your house is painted 
a particularly attractive shade of turquoise, and 
your lawn is greener than the lawns of any of 
those other houses. I suggest starting with a 
nice, round asking price of $400,000.”
Agent three knows that he probably won’t get 
the listing unless he outbids the other two 
agents. “Our firm’s Internet marketing program 
is incredibly successful,” he says, oozing confi-
dence. “Through our relocation service and 
Internet referrals, we’ll undoubtedly be able to 
find a buyer willing to pay $425,000.”
This technique of successive agents giving 
ever-higher property valuations is known as 
buying a listing. Sellers, when confronted 
by the choice of market reality versus fantasy, 
often succumb to fantasy. They rationalize 
their decision by telling themselves that the 
highest bidding agent has the most faith in their 
house.
That’s horse-hockey. If the sellers in this exam-
ple select the highest bidder, it’s because that 
agent dazzled them with the extra $50,000 they’d 
get by selecting him to sell their house. He told 
them what they wanted to hear. Greed tri-
umphed over reason.
So who wins the bidding war? Not the folks who 
own the house. If their asking price has no basis 
in the real world, you won’t purchase it. Neither 
will any other educated buyer.
How can you avoid becoming the victim of a 
bidding war? You know what we’re going 
to say. Trust the comps to tell you what the 
house is worth. If the sellers won’t listen to 
reason, move on. Comps don’t fantasize. Neither 
should you.

230
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Time cures overpricing by inept agents. The longer the house stays on the 
market without selling, the more the sellers will doubt their own and their 
agent’s opinion of value.
 
If the sellers’ house isn’t priced to sell and they won’t listen to reason, move 
on to the next house on your list. No telling how long the sellers will take to 
get smart. Don’t put your life on hold waiting for them to wise up. They may 
be very slow learners.
Unrealistic sellers
Some sellers get excellent pricing advice from agents — and choose to ignore 
it. Sellers attempting to sell without an agent often make the same mistake — 
they opt for the ever-popular need-based pricing method (which we describe 
earlier in this chapter) to set their asking price.
Sellers need time to accept that buyers don’t care how much they paid for 
their house, how much they spent fixing it up, or how much they need to buy 
their next home. The sellers are stuck with these problems. The buyer isn’t.
 
Unless an overpriced house has been on the market long enough to bring the 
sellers back to reality, move on. Most sellers aren’t open to reason until 
they’ve tried their price for a couple of months or feel external pressure to 
sell. Trying to reason with such sellers prematurely is like trying to teach a pig 
how to whistle. Your time is wasted, and the pig gets upset.
Spotting overpriced turkeys
Many agents show buyers overpriced houses, 
but their intention isn’t to sell these houses. One 
of the tactics that smart agents adopt early in 
their careers is using OPTs (overpriced turkeys) 
to graphically demonstrate the value of well-
priced homes.
Suppose that an agent shows you a three-
bedroom, two-bath house with a price tag 
of $299,500 and then takes you to an even 
more attractive four-bedroom, three-bath 
home in the same neighborhood with the same 
asking price. The agent doesn’t have to say 
another word — the difference between price 
and value is glaringly obvious. The OPT makes 
the sale.
Here’s another way to spot OPTs: They get lots 
of showings but no offers.

Tapping the Internet’s 
Best Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Honing in on helpful real estate information
▶ Starting to shop online for homes
▶ Knowing the pitfalls of real estate Web sites
N
o other personal financial transaction provokes more financial and 
emotional anxiety than buying a home. Most of us rightfully feel huge 
trepidation when buying something with upward of six digits in its sticker 
price. You have to confront deciding how much to spend, selecting a good 
real estate agent, negotiating on a property, choosing a mortgage, and 
handling the myriad closing details — all of which are mysterious, jargon-
filled, and fraught with commission-hungry salespeople. (Ditto for the head-
aches when it comes time for you to sell.) Add in some time pressure for a 
job relocation or impending birth of a child (or two), and you have a surefire 
recipe for psychological stress.
Enter the Internet. In this chapter, we highlight how you can use the Internet 
to make yourself a more informed consumer and make your home search 
more efficient and effective. We name names and recommend for your 
consideration the best sites that we’ve reviewed. We also warn you about 
common pitfalls that you may encounter online.
Finding Useful Information
The number of real estate Web sites vastly exceeds those good enough to 
warrant a bookmark. In this section, we give some pointers so that you can 
quickly head in the right direction when you start your search.

232
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Get your feet wet at Realtor.com
Given the sheer number of sites to choose among, the best place to start 
your realty Web surfing is a comprehensive site that includes useful residen-
tial real estate resources, as well as plenty of listings of houses for sale.
Our top pick for the best residential real estate Web site is www.realtor.
com, sponsored by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). In previous 
editions of this book, this site wasn’t worthy of such high praise, but now 
it is — thanks to continued improvements.
Realtor.com has millions of listings of houses for sale from Multiple Listing 
Services (MLS) around the country. Most listings are quite detailed and 
usually include a map so that you see approximately where the property is 
located. Increasing numbers of listings also include multiple photos. Because 
this is the official Web site of the NAR, though, don’t expect to find any For 
Sale by Owner listings here. Obviously, the goal of this site is to provide 
some resources to prospective home buyers (and sellers) in the hope of 
connecting you with a real estate agent. However, you may use this site as 
you wish without providing any personal details or making a commitment to 
any agent.
This site also sports some useful resources to help you in your search for a 
specific town and neighborhood by accessing community statistics, including 
demographic data, public school information, and crime statistics. The site 
even helps you begin the mortgage-shopping process.
Our chief complaint with this Web site is the ubiquitous ads. The good news, 
however, is that you can tap into this site’s vast resources without having to 
commit to buy anything or work with anyone pitching his services.
Read quality real estate news
You must be careful when surfing the Web in general, and especially when 
searching for useful, objective, and quality real estate information and 
perspectives. Here are a couple of sites we recommend for keeping up with 
the latest real estate developments, as well as continuing to add to your 
burgeoning real estate knowledge:
 
✓ DeadlineNews.com (www.deadlinenews.com): Crackerjack real 
estate writer Broderick Perkins, who wrote for the San Jose Mercury 
News for 16 years, operates this site. In addition to articles on regional 
and national real estate issues, DeadlineNews.com includes extensive 
coverage of California’s sometimes nutty and always fascinating real 
estate markets.

233
 Chapter 11: Tapping the Internet’s Best Resources
 
✓ Eric Tyson.com (erictyson.com): Your humble coauthor has a won-
derful Web site that includes timely and thought-provoking articles on 
home buying and real estate generally, as well as all important aspects 
of your personal finances.
Discover more at these sites
Several other top real estate and government organizations offer useful 
information through their Web sites. So how do you know where and what 
to look for? Of course, we’re going to tell you! Here are our top picks:
 
✓ The Federal Emergency Management Agency site (www.fema.gov) 
can help you see where various disasters (such as earthquakes, 
tornadoes, and floods) are most likely to strike, and it provides helpful 
educational resources on such topics as flood insurance and disaster 
preparation and prevention. The site also points you to useful resources 
should you or your loved ones need help someday.
 
✓ The American Society of Home Inspectors (www.ashi.org) can help 
you find an ASHI-certified inspector and teach you more about the home 
inspection process (which we cover in Chapter 13). You’ll also find 
information and links to a variety of timely consumer protection issues, 
such as Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls and notices, water 
testing, and septic systems.
 
✓ The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (www.hud.
gov) has an extensive Web site that includes HUD and other government 
agency listings of homes for sale. The site also has an excellent section 
for people with disabilities and their housing needs. Discrimination 
complaints (either as a buyer or renter) can be submitted to HUD. Bring 
your best reading glasses — the type size on this site is microscopic 
in places!
 
✓ The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis 
(www.bea.gov) has a treasure trove of state and local area economic 
data. If you want to review data to get more comfortable with the 
economic health of communities in which you may buy a home, this is 
the site for you!
Doing Some Preliminary Shopping
Our favorite thing about using the Internet as a tool for hunting real estate 
is that you can quickly get an overview of what’s going on. When it’s conve-
nient in your schedule, you can surf from Web site to Web site without 

234
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
salespeople pressuring you. Home buyers can use the Internet to compare 
one community with another in such areas as school test scores, weather, 
and crime statistics. You can research many aspects of the buying process — 
including home prices, real estate agents, property inspectors, mortgages, 
and movers — without ever leaving your easy chair. With the click of a 
mouse, the Internet can instantaneously whisk you anywhere in the world any 
time of the day or night. And you can expect to save money, too, because the 
Web is supposed to cut out middlemen and their extra costs.
 
One thing we do want you to remember regarding the Internet is this: Seeing 
is believing. Sitting in front of your computer screen in your current living 
quarters is simply no substitute for pounding the pavement and touring neigh-
borhoods and properties. You can’t talk to people you run into on the street, 
chat with school officials, or experience the quality and friendliness of local 
store owners through your computer.
Surveying homes for sale
Perhaps the Internet’s greatest contribution to the home-buying process is 
the ability it gives you to peruse many listings of homes for sale at your 
convenience. Especially if you’re contemplating an out-of-state move and 
want a general idea of what you can get for your money, accessing home 
listings online is invaluable. The screening abilities of many sites with home 
listings sure beats scouring classified ads for a given area to find, say, all the 
houses in a particular community with at least three bedrooms and central 
air conditioning for under $300,000.
 
When you do a general Web search (through Google, for example) for real 
estate in a given area (say Durham, NC), the largest local and regional Realtor 
Web sites generally pop up on the first page or two of your search results. As 
we discuss in Chapter 9, the size of your prospective agent’s firm has little 
bearing on their selection. But finding the larger realty company Web sites will 
get you in touch with more local information and listings.
Most real estate agents today will set you up to automatically receive e-mail 
updates of newly listed homes for sale that meet specific criteria (for exam-
ple, at least three bedrooms, at least 2,000 square feet, and so on). Just 
beware of agents who lazily use this instead of personally eyeballing proper-
ties and contacting you with precise feedback about given properties for sale 
that may meet your needs.
If you’re not ready to work with an agent, start your home-search process on 
www.realtor.com, which allows you to search for homes that meet specific 
criteria.

235
 Chapter 11: Tapping the Internet’s Best Resources
 
For smaller communities not well covered through real estate listing Web 
sites, try tracking down a small-town newspaper, which you can do through 
the Newspaper Association of America’s Web site (www.newsvoyager.com). 
A small-town paper can be an excellent source to discover what’s going on in 
the area you’re considering for your home purchase.
 
If you’re serious about actually buying a home you see promoted online, be 
aware that what you see isn’t always what you can get. Even though one of the 
supposed virtues of the Internet is how up-to-date it is, that’s sometimes not 
the case with sites listing homes for sale. As the late, syndicated real estate 
columnist Robert Bruss said in one of his columns, “My experience has been 
that most of these home listing Web sites contain outdated or incomplete 
listings, which can be a waste of time.”
Watching out for sites promoting 
foreclosures
With the declining real estate market in the late 2000s and the significant 
increase in foreclosures, many foreclosure-themed Web sites sprung up like 
weeds. Often, these sites hype the big money you can supposedly make 
buying foreclosures and downplay the major risks with buying and investing 
in foreclosed properties.
 
Among the various foreclosure Web sites, the biggest and most widely publi-
cized is RealtyTrac, which is usually cited as the main source for national 
and state foreclosure statistics. When you read and hear news reports about 
foreclosures increasing a certain percentage, RealtyTrac is typically the 
source of such data for the news media.
When Eric frequently saw RealtyTrac data, he wondered who these 
RealtyTrac people were and why they were collecting and publishing foreclo-
sure data. After spending time on their Web site and doing some research, 
Eric realized that RealtyTrac’s primary business is actually selling access to 
their foreclosure listings through a $49.95 monthly subscription fee.
But RealtyTrac seems to have disgruntled former customers with common 
complaints. The Better Business Bureau of the Southland in the Los Angeles 
area has logged hundreds of complaints against RealtyTrac. The firm’s latest 
rating is a “B–,” which is in the sixth tier of ratings — A+ is the highest, fol-
lowed by A, A–, B+, and then B.
Take the cast of dissatisfied customer John Gassett, who signed up for 
RealtyTrac’s “free trial” to access their foreclosure listings. Gassett was 
extremely disappointed with the prevalent inaccuracies he found in the local 

236
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
area listings he searched through, looking for potential foreclosure proper-
ties to purchase. “The information was very dated and very inaccurate. I was 
finding properties that had already sold six months ago.”
Gassett’s experience with RealtyTrac went from bad to worse when he 
attempted to cancel his subscription before racking up $49.95 in monthly 
fees. “Trying to even reach them was horrific . . . they do everything that they 
can to avoid interactions with customers,” says Gassett. He contacted them 
by phone and sent numerous e-mails, all without success. After two months 
of credit card charges, he had to step up his efforts by disputing the charges 
through his credit card company. RealtyTrac failed to back down, so Gassett 
finally got his attorney (a relative willing to work pro bono) involved to get 
the monthly charges dropped and his account canceled.
Also, RealtyTrac actively and aggressively sells customer contact information 
to other companies. Gassett, for example, received numerous solicitations 
from real estate agents who bought his contact details from RealtyTrac.
 
Gassett ended up finding current and accurate foreclosure listings in local 
newspapers. Another potential way to find compilations of foreclosures is to 
do a Web search using the name of a major city nearby and the word “foreclo-
sure.” For example, if you’re interesting in looking for foreclosed properties 
outside of Pittsburgh, PA, you could search “Pittsburgh PA foreclosures.” But 
be aware that you’ll find plenty of shady sites in the search results, as well as 
RealtyTrac and sites like Yahoo Real Estate, which also uses and promotes 
RealtyTrac. For more information about the realities and challenges to 
researching and buying foreclosures, see Chapter 8.
Sifting school information
Even if you don’t have school-age children of your own, you should investi-
gate what’s going on with local schools in areas where you’re considering 
buying a home. If you do have school-age children, you should be even more 
motivated to collect information to assist you with the all-important decision 
of where to live.
School information sites that we like include www.greatschools.net, 
www.homefair.com, www.schoolmatch.com, and www.psk12.com. These 
sites can be useful starting points for collecting basic information about 
public schools in a given area. They typically offer some free content, as well 
as other information and data for a fee. You can also see how a particular 
school and district compare with those in the rest of the nation. In addition, 
state departments of education often have useful (although cumbersome-to-
access) data on public schools. Also check out www.neighborhoodscout.
com for useful school information, along with other community data.

237
 Chapter 11: Tapping the Internet’s Best Resources
 
Please remember, of course, that getting data from a Web site is no substitute 
for visiting schools and talking to parents, administrators, and teachers. These 
latter steps take extra time and energy but often help folks make important 
decisions based on more complete information.
Perusing “best places” to live
Whenever a job relocation or family change prompts a move, it can raise 
the question, “Where’s the best place to live?” What’s best, of course, is in 
the eyes and desires of the beholder. One financial magazine, for example, 
claimed that Plymouth, MN, is the best place to live. With all due respect to 
that lovely town and the people who call it home and enjoy it, we urge you 
not to accept any publication’s or any person’s rating of the supposed best 
place to live as being applicable to your situation.
Neighborhood Scout is a terrific site that allows you to select customized 
search criteria to find the best places that meet your needs. If you don’t 
want to customize, you can begin your search with preset search criteria 
The Internet is a selling tool
It may seem odd for us to include a tip about 
selling a house that you have yet to purchase. 
But sooner or later, most folks end up selling for 
one reason or another.
When it comes time to sell their home, 
many house sellers are tempted to cut real 
estate agents — and their typical 6 percent 
commission — out of the picture. Web sites 
have made surprisingly little headway in 
helping consumers bypass agents by doing a 
For Sale by Owner — known in the trade as a 
FSBO.
Some sites offer scaled-back real estate agent 
services for a reduced commission. The com-
munities typically served by such services tend 
to have higher-cost homes. Think of these realty 
brokers as discount brokers. With the reduced 
level of service comes a lower price. One site 
trumpets: “Sell with us and pay only 4.5 per-
cent.” To that we say, when it comes time to 
sell your house, should you choose to hire an 
agent, hire the best one you can, and negotiate 
the commission. You can have a great agent 
and a competitive commission to boot. Pick up 
a copy of the latest edition of our companion 
book, House Selling For Dummies, to find 
out how.
Although the Internet is supposed to threaten 
middlemen and their profit margins, that doesn’t 
seem to be happening so far with the residential 
real estate buying and selling process. The fact 
that FSBO Web sites haven’t really taken off is 
noteworthy. Remember — there’s no substitute 
for pounding the pavement. Nothing, including 
the Internet, beats actually seeing a home and 
the surrounding environment in person.

(which you may later modify) designed to appeal to common home-
buying populations, such as “Families with Children” or “Retirement 
Dream Areas.”
Familiarizing yourself with 
financing options
Many mortgage broker and lender Web sites provide rate quotes and offer to 
help you find a low-cost loan. The interactive features of some sites allow you 
to compare the total cost of loans, including points and fees, under different 
scenarios, such as how long you keep the loan and what happens to the inter-
est rate on adjustable-rate mortgages. Interpreting these comparisons, how-
ever, requires a solid understanding of mortgage lingo and pricing. The worst 
sites are little more than glorified advertisement listings of mortgage lenders 
who pay a fee to be on the site.
 
Most mortgage sites are best used to research the current mortgage market-
place rather than to actually apply for a loan. The reason: Mortgage lending is 
still largely a locally driven business that varies based on the nuances of a 
local real estate market. Lynnea Key of Lynnea Key Realty in San Francisco 
says, “I’ve had some near disasters with Internet sites located out of the area 
that don’t understand the local market here, where we’ve had multiple offers 
and overbids. I’ve had clients have to scramble at the last minute for a local 
lender. In multiple-offer situations, when I represent a prospective buyer, 
some listing agents are uneasy with mortgage preapproval letters from an 
Internet site.” (We discuss preapproval in Chapter 6.)
 
Mortgage data tracker and publisher HSH Associates (www.hsh.com) pro-
vides tons of information on mortgages and other types of loans through its 
Web site. If you’re in the market for an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), you 
can check out the history of the interest-rate movements of various ARM 
indexes to see how quickly or slowly each index adjusts to overall changes 
in interest rates. The site also boasts useful articles and links on a variety 
of mortgages and selected home issues, such as environmental hazards in 
the home.
The Drawbacks of Searching 
for Houses in Cyberspace
The reality of real estate Web sites may fall short of what you expect. The 
following sections tell you what to watch out for.

239
 Chapter 11: Tapping the Internet’s Best Resources
Conflicts of interest
 
Sadly, most Web sites are hardly bastions of objectivity or free of commercial-
ism. On the contrary, Internet sites often have an ax to grind or an agenda to 
push. They generally derive most, if not all, of their revenue from advertising. 
Thus, whenever you’re online, always be on guard as to whether something is 
featured or promoted because it’s truly the best or because a company or 
individual paid the owner of the Web site to be brought to your attention.
Bankruptcies
Most Web sites operated for commercial purposes will fail (as is the case 
with most small businesses in general). You should be careful when choosing 
to do business with any online company, especially smaller ones, those new 
to the real estate field, or those on the verge of running out of cash.
Misleading home-valuation tools
 
Be careful when using the home-valuation tools that purport to help you 
determine the fair market value of a home or size up the fairness of your 
property taxes. You can find these tools on many general-interest real estate 
Web sites, as well as on sites such as Zillow.com. As a rule, these sites 
don’t give you the kind of information you need to find and evaluate truly 
comparable properties. And they almost always end up being a referral 
resource for real estate agents who pay the site a fee for the referrals.
Now, with the click of your computer mouse, you can visit a multitude of Web 
sites that offer addresses, sale dates, and sale prices for houses that sold in 
recent years. You can look up towns where you may want to live and search 
by specific property, by street, or by price range. (Note: Not all communities’ 
house-sales data can be found on such sites — in fact, public reporting of 
such information is prohibited in certain areas.)
These Web sites encourage prospective home buyers to use their invaluable 
sale price data to find areas they can afford and to determine what a particu-
lar house is worth. Existing homeowners can supposedly use the information 
to appeal unfairly high property-tax assessments.
If this sounds too good to be true, read Chapter 10 immediately to see the 
right way to value a home! Who cares whether 123 Main Street sold for 
$275,000 in April of last year? You need a lot more than an address, a sale 
price, and the date of sale to value a home properly. What about little details 
like size, age, condition, yard size, and so on?

240
Part III: Property, Players, and Prices 
Untrustworthy mortgage calculators
There’s usually a significant difference between the amount the ubiquitous 
online mortgage calculators say you can borrow and how much you can 
actually afford to borrow. The dollar amount that a lender or online calcula-
tor comes up with is based solely on the ratio between your expected 
housing payments and income. Although this may satisfy a lender’s concern 
that you won’t default on a loan, such a simplistic calculation ignores your 
larger financial picture, such as how much (or little) you’ve put away for 
other long-term financial goals like retirement or college education for your 
children.
 
Take a hard look at your budget and goals before deciding how much you can 
afford to spend on a home; don’t let some slick-looking online calculator 
decide this for you. Check out Chapters 2 and 3 for help.

Part IV
Making the Deal

In this part . . .
P
lay ball! When you’ve done all your preliminary 
homework, you’re ready for this part. Here’s where 
we show you how to negotiate a super deal and how to 
get your home inspected from roof to foundation so that 
you know whether it’s in perfect shape or riddled with 
expensive defects. Because you can’t close the purchase 
until you get homeowners insurance, we explain where 
and how to buy the coverage you need. Finally, we 
describe some of the legal and tax ramifications of your 
purchase, along with ways to make sure that your deal 
closes smoothly and without unnecessary costs.

W
hen it comes to buying things, most Americans are lousy negotiators. 
Negotiation isn’t part of our culture. We’ve been conditioned for 
generations to be docile buyers who pay whatever price is marked on a can 
of beans or a TV set. Instead of negotiating with someone eyeball-to-eyeball 
to drive down the price, at best we comparison shop to find the store with 
the lowest price. (And many time-starved people don’t even do that.)
Sure, we can negotiate when our back is to the wall. We haggle over expen-
sive things like cars and dicker with the boss for a raise, but doing so makes 
us uncomfortable. We walk away from these encounters with the nagging 
suspicion that we came out on the short end of the deal — that someone else 
could’ve done better.
Realizing our nation’s discomfort with negotiating, some car dealers have 
taken the haggling out of buying a car. Instead of using high-pressure sales 
tactics, these dealers post a sales price on the car — the no-dicker sticker. 
That’s their price; take it or leave it. If you take it, you probably won’t get 
the lowest price, but some people think that’s a fair trade-off to avoid the 
unpleasantness of negotiating.
You won’t find no-dicker stickers on homes. On the contrary, generally every-
thing from the purchase price to the date that escrow closes is negotiable. 
Given today’s high home prices in most of the densely populated parts of 
the U.S., buying a home is the ultimate in high-stakes negotiating. Good 
negotiators come out of a home purchase smiling. Bad negotiators take it 
in the wallet.

Following the tips in this chapter will give you the negotiating advantage 
you so richly deserve throughout the home-buying process. And of course, 
these tips make getting the keys to your dream home faster, easier, and less 
expensive.
Understanding and Coping 
with Your Emotions
Emotion is an integral part of home buying. Real estate transactions are 
emotional roller coaster rides for everyone involved.
Sometimes, like San Francisco fog, emotion drifts into transactions so quietly 
that you hardly notice it. More often, however, it thunders into deals like a 
herd of elephants.
Examining the violent forces at work
Consider the violent forces acting on you during the home-buying process:
“Good” depends on your perspective
Brace yourself. You may be shocked by the sell-
ers’ response to your offer to buy their home. 
From your perspective, you made a really good 
offer. They, on the other hand, may think your 
offer stinks.
Here, for example, is the perspective of first-
time buyers who just blew their budget to 
smithereens making a $210,000 offer for a 
home listed at $239,000: “Honey, I’m so nervous. 
Do you think the sellers will accept our 
offer? I know their home costs a lot more 
than we planned to spend, but you know 
as well as I do that it’s the best place we’ve 
seen in four months of looking. What’s taking 
them so long to get back to us? The suspense is 
killing me.”
And here’s the perspective of the retired couple 
who got their $210,000 offer: “Calm down, dear. 
Your face is beet red. Remember your blood 
pressure. I’m sure that nice young couple didn’t 
mean to insult us. And no matter what you say, 
I can’t believe that they think we’re doddering 
old fools who don’t know how much our house 
is worth. They probably made the best offer 
they could. Please don’t throw it away.”
Two entirely different takes on the exact same 
offer. Buyers generally think that they’re paying 
too much. Sellers usually think that they’re 
giving their house away. When you’re playing 
for real money, these conflicting perceptions 
fuel emotional fires that heat up the negotiating 
process.

245
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
✓ You’re dealing with people at their most primal level. Shelter, food, 
and security are the three most basic necessities of life. Home is where 
the heart is. Your home is your castle. People become vicious when 
their homes are threatened. Speaking of primal urges, now you know 
why looking for a home is called house hunting.
 
✓ You’re playing for large amounts of real money. Whether this is your 
first home or your last, it’s probably the largest purchase you’ve ever 
made. How much you pay for a home isn’t the issue. When significant 
amounts of real money are at risk, the emotional intensity for you and 
the seller is just as great, whether the house you buy costs $250,000 or 
$2.5 million.
 
✓ You’re probably going through a life change. Buying a home would be 
plenty stressful if you only had to deal with seeking shelter and spend-
ing tons of money. Throw in a life change (such as marriage, divorce, 
birth, death, job change, or retirement), which is often the motivation to 
purchase a home, and you’ve created an emotional minefield.
 
Because eliminating emotions from a home purchase is impossible, the next-
best thing to do is recognize and manage them. By all means, share your 
concerns and frustrations in a productive way with your spouse or a friend 
who has purchased a home or, better yet, with a good therapist! Bottling 
up emotions isn’t healthy or possible — the longer you stew, the worse the 
likely explosion is going to be. But the worst thing you can do is vent your 
frustrations and fears at other people in the transaction — especially the 
sellers. The folks who do the best job of controlling and properly directing 
their emotions generally end up getting the best deals.
Controlling yourself
 
Here are five techniques you can use to control your emotions during the 
home-buying negotiations:
 
✓ Put the transaction in perspective. Which is worse: a failed home pur-
chase or failed open-heart surgery? No matter how badly things go with 
your real estate transaction, keep reminding yourself that this isn’t a 
life-or-death situation. Tomorrow is another day. The sun will rise again, 
roses will bloom again, birds will sing again, and children will laugh 
again. Life goes on. If worse comes to worst, the deal may die, but you’ll 
live on to find another place that you can call home.
 
✓ Don’t let time bully you. Most life changes have predictable time 
frames. You have plenty of advance notice on marriages, births, retire-
ments, and the like. Don’t put yourself under needless pressure by 
procrastinating or by creating unnecessary, self-imposed deadlines. 
Allow yourself enough time to buy a home. Allocate time properly, and 
it will be your friend rather than your enemy.

246
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Maintain an emotional arm’s length. Keep your options open. Be ready 
to walk away from a potential house purchase if you can’t reach a satis-
factory agreement with the sellers on price and terms. Mentally condi-
tion yourself to the prospect that the deal may fall through. Houses are 
like buses: If you miss one, another will come along sooner or later.
 
✓ Accept uncertainty as a part of your transaction. Much as you’d like 
to know everything about a property before making an offer on it, the 
game is played with incomplete information. You always have far more 
questions than answers at the beginning of a transaction. Don’t worry; 
you’ll be fine as long as you know what things you need to find out and 
get the answers in a timely manner during your transaction.
 
✓ Stay objective. Use a comparable market analysis (CMA) to factually 
establish the fair market value of the home you want to buy (see 
Chapter 10). A good real estate agent can help you use this information 
to prepare an equitable offer. If you don’t plan to use an agent, consider 
working with a real estate lawyer. Having someone to buffer you from 
your unavoidable emotional involvement is helpful if your composure 
starts to slip. Just make sure that you work with professionals who are 
patient, not pushy, and who are committed to getting you the best deal. 
(Flip to Chapter 9 for tips on assembling a great real estate team.)
The Art of Negotiating
Is negotiating like water or ice? If you said “water,” go directly to the head of 
the class.
 
Negotiating is fluid, not rigid. There’s no one-size-fits-all best negotiating 
strategy that you can use in every home-buying situation. Good negotiators 
adjust their strategy based on a variety of factors, such as:
 
✓ How well-priced a property is
 
✓ How long it’s been on the market
 
✓ How motivated the sellers are
 
✓ How motivated you are
 
✓ Whether you’re dealing from a position of strength (a buyer’s market) or 
weakness (a seller’s market)
Good negotiators, however, apply a few basic principles to every situation. If 
you understand these principles, you can greatly increase the odds of getting 
what you want.

247
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
Being realistic
Good negotiators understand that facts are the foundation of successful 
negotiation. If you want to become a good negotiator, you must see things as 
they are, rather than as you want them to be. Wishful thinking makes bad 
negotiation.
What’s wishful thinking? A common wish in a rising real estate market, for 
example, is that you can pay yesteryear’s price for today’s home. Perhaps 
you saw a similar house offered for sale at a much lower price six months 
ago. You ignore the fact that prices have increased since then, which 
eliminates your chance of buying a home today at the old price. Another 
common (and generally unrealistic) wish is that you can afford to buy a 
home similar to the one that you were reared in.
How do you eliminate wishful thinking? By replacing fantasy with facts. 
Unfortunately, that’s easier said than done, because we all inevitably get 
emotionally involved when we negotiate for something that we intensely 
desire. Even though that emotional involvement is part of human nature, 
allowing emotion to seep into a negotiation can cost you dearly.
First things first
Early in Ray’s career, he worked with a buyer 
who insisted on having every question about a 
house answered before he’d submit an offer to 
purchase it. He wanted to structure a flawless 
offer. Because Ray didn’t know any better, he 
went along with the plan. They spent several 
weeks fine-tuning the offering price by checking 
comparable home sales and getting quotes from 
contractors to do the necessary corrective work 
that had been discovered during the inspections 
ordered by a previous prospective buyer.
Unfortunately, Ray and the buyer got a hard 
lesson in accepting uncertainty, because they 
overlooked one tiny detail; Ray’s “buyer” didn’t 
have a signed offer on the house. The seller 
got tired of their dithering around, endlessly 
gathering information, and sold the property to 
someone else.
If you’re smart, you’ll do what the successful 
buyer of this home did: Make a deal first. 
Condition your offer on getting all your questions 
answered while you have the house “tied up” 
with a contract.
That way, if everything goes well, you end up the 
proud owner of a wonderful home. If, however, 
you can’t get a loan, or you don’t like the findings 
of the inspection reports, you can either renego-
tiate the deal or bail out of the transaction and 
move on to a more promising home. In the mean-
time, however, you remove the property from 
the competition by getting your offer accepted.
Don’t waste time getting answers to secondary 
questions until you answer the primary ques-
tion: Can you and the seller agree on price and 
terms of sale? Failure to go for the commitment 
wastes time and money, and may cause you to 
lose the property.

248
Part IV: Making the Deal 
The importance of objectivity
Unlike you and the seller, good real estate agents don’t take things person-
ally. The seller’s agent, for example, won’t be offended if your agent tells 
her that you hate the emerald-green paint in the kitchen and the red flocked 
wallpaper in the den. Your agent, by the same token, won’t blow his cork if 
the seller’s agent says that your offer is ridiculously low.
Agents find it easy to be objective. After all, they’re not the ones who spent 
three long weekends painting the kitchen or months looking for just the 
right wallpaper to put in the den. Neither is it their life’s savings on the 
negotiating table.
Good agents listen to what the market says a house is worth. They don’t 
allow distracting details (such as how much the seller paid for the house 
ten years ago, or how little you can afford to spend for it today) to confuse 
negotiations. As you know if you’ve read Chapter 10, no correlation exists 
between these need-based issues and the current fair market value of a 
home.
Some folks think that agents have calculators for hearts. Not true. The good 
agents know that if they aren’t coldly realistic about property values, the 
home won’t sell, and they won’t get paid.
The red flags in agent negotiations
If you follow our advice in Chapter 9 when selecting your real estate agent, 
you’ll choose one who’s a good negotiator.
 
Doing a lousy job of selecting an agent can cost you big bucks. Bad agents 
don’t know how to determine fair market values; as a result, you may pay 
too much for your home. And why should the bad agent care? After all, the 
more you pay, the more your agent makes, because agents’ commissions are 
typically a percentage of the purchase price. If your agent pushes you to buy 
and can’t justify the offering price by using comparable home sales, fire your 
agent, and get a good one.
Good negotiators avoid making moral judgments. As long as the seller’s posi-
tion isn’t illegal, it’s neither immoral nor unfair. It’s simply a negotiating 
position. Of course, agents are human. Sometimes, even the best agents tem-
porarily lose their objectivity in the heat of battle. You know that this has 
happened if your agent gets red in the face and starts accusing the other side 
of being unfair.
If your agent snaps out of the funk quickly, no problem. On the other hand, if 
your agent can’t calm down, you’ve lost your emotional buffer. Agents who 
lose their professional detachment are incapable of negotiating well on your 
behalf.

249
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
No matter how satisfying it may be to go on an emotional rampage with 
your agent about the seller’s utter lack of good taste, market knowledge, or 
scruples, getting angry won’t get you the house. If your agent can’t maintain 
a level head, ask your agent’s broker (see Chapter 9) to negotiate for you, 
or get another agent.
Examining your negotiating style
Finding two people who have exactly the same negotiating style is as unlikely 
as finding two identical 200-year-old houses. All negotiating styles, however, 
boil down to variations on one of these two basic themes:
 
✓ Combative (I win, you lose): These negotiators view winning only in the 
context of beating the other side. To them, negotiation is war. They take 
no prisoners.
Fact versus opinion
You and the sellers can use exactly the same 
facts (that is, recent sale prices of comparable 
houses) and yet reach entirely different opin-
ions of fair market value. As we point out in 
Chapter 10, although houses may be compara-
ble in terms of age, size, and condition, no two 
homes are identical after they’ve been lived in.
Furthermore, even though all the houses used 
in the comparable market analysis are in the 
same neighborhood, site differences (that is, 
proximity to schools, better view, bigger yard, 
and the like) usually affect individual property 
values. Last but not least, even though all the 
comparable houses were sold during the previ-
ous six months, property values can be affected 
by changes in mortgage rates and consumer 
confidence.
For example, your agent thinks that 123 Main 
Street, which sold two months ago for $280,000, 
is the best comparable (comp) for the house 
that you’re trying to buy. The seller’s agent 
agrees that it’s a good comp but points out that 
this house has a two-car garage, whereas 123 
Main Street has only a one-car garage. Your 
agent says that 123 Main Street has a larger 
kitchen with a breakfast nook and is two blocks 
closer to the park. The seller’s agent says that 
the property you’re considering has higher-
quality kitchen cabinets and a new refrigerator, 
and is three blocks closer to the bus stop.
And so it goes. Everyone agrees on 123 Main 
Street’s sale price and date of sale. These are 
facts. They’re the same no matter who looks at 
them.
But how much value does a second garage 
space add to the home that you want to buy? Is 
being closer to the bus stop worth more to you 
than proximity to the park? Is an eat-in kitchen 
more or less valuable to you than fancy kitchen 
cabinets and a new refrigerator? The answers 
to these questions are opinions that are based 
on your value judgments. Another person 
would probably value the amenities somewhat 
differently.
Pricing isn’t 100 percent scientific at this 
level of scrutiny. No two buyers are alike. Each 
buyer has different needs and, due to those 
differing needs, will reach different conclusions 
regarding opinions of value.

250
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Cooperative (we both win): These negotiators focus on solving prob-
lems rather than defeating opponents. Everyone involved in the transac-
tion works together to find solutions that are satisfactory to both sides.
Which negotiating style is better? That depends on the kind of person you 
are, what your objectives are, and how much time you have.
Most folks opt for cooperation because they know that the world is round — 
what goes around nearly always comes back either to haunt you or to help 
you. Why fight battles in some weird game of mutually assured destruction if 
you can peacefully work together as allies to solve your common problems?
Combative negotiation is tolerated in a strong buyer’s or seller’s market. The 
operative word is tolerated. People grudgingly play an “I win, you lose” game 
when they have no alternative. However, in a balanced market that favors 
neither buyers nor sellers, combative negotiators are usually told, “I won’t 
play your stupid game because I don’t like your style.”
Cooperative negotiation, on the other hand, works well under all market con-
ditions because its goal is to scratch everyone’s itch. We all enjoy winning 
and hate losing. People sometimes cry when they’re defeated. Problems, on 
the other hand, never cry when they’re solved.
 
Unfortunately, some people are born competitors. The only cooperation they 
understand is the cooperation of a team that’s working together to defeat its 
opponents. If you’re a cooperative negotiator, here are two ways to protect 
yourself from combative negotiators:
 
✓ Try switching them from combative to cooperative by finding ways 
you both can win. Shift their emphasis from beating you to solving the 
problem. “You want to sell. I want to buy. How can we do it?”
 
✓ If that fails, deep-six the deal. If you keep negotiating, born competitors 
will strip the money from your bank account and the flesh from your 
bones. They confuse concessions with weakness. If, for example, you 
offer to split the difference, they’ll take the 50 percent you give them as 
their just due and then go for the rest. They won’t be happy until they 
thrill to a victory that’s enhanced by your unconditional defeat. Life’s 
too short to subject yourself to this kind of punishment. No matter how 
strong a seller’s market you must contend with, you can find sellers who 
are cooperative negotiators — if you try.
Negotiating with finesse
 
Skillful negotiators get what they want through mutual agreement — not 
brute force. Brute force is crude, rude, ugly, and decidedly unfriendly. Here 
are some concepts that you may find useful for negotiating with finesse:

251
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
✓ Phones are for making appointments. Never, never, never let your 
agent or lawyer present an offer or attempt to negotiate significant 
issues over the phone. Saying no over the phone is too easy for the 
sellers. Even if they agree with everything you want, they may change 
their minds by the time they actually have to sign the contract.
 
✓ Oral agreements are useless. In our society, we have written contracts 
because people have notoriously selective memories. If you want your 
deal to be enforceable in a court of law, put everything about it in 
writing. Get into the habit of writing short, dated MFRs (Memos for 
Record) of important conversations (such as “June 2 — lender said we’d 
get 7.5 percent mortgage rate,” “June 12 — sellers want to extend close 
of escrow a week,” and so on). Put these notes into your transaction file, 
just in case you need to refresh your memory. Heed the immortal words 
of Samuel Goldwyn: “A verbal agreement isn’t worth the paper it’s 
written on.”
 
✓ Deadline management is essential. Real estate contracts are filled with 
deadlines for things like contingency removals, deposit increases, and 
(of course) the close of escrow. Failure to meet deadlines can have 
dreadful consequences. Your deal could fall apart — you could even 
get sued. Most deadlines, however, are flexible — if you handle them 
correctly. Suppose that you just found out that completing the property 
inspections will take longer than anticipated. Immediately contact the 
sellers to explain the reason for the delay and then get a written exten-
sion of the deadline. Reasonable delays can usually be accommodated if 
properly explained and promptly handled.
The Negotiating Process
Negotiation is an ongoing process — a series of steps without a neatly 
defined beginning and end. Think of water flowing.
Each step in the negotiating process begins by gathering information. After 
you read this book, you’ll understand the various aspects of buying a home. 
Then you can translate your information into action that generates more 
information that in turn leads to further action. And so it goes, until you’re 
the proud owner of your dream home.
One way to begin the first action phase is to get your finances in order, get 
preapproved for a loan, and select an agent to work with you through the 
next information-gathering phase. You and your agent then investigate 
various neighborhoods and tour houses so that you know what’s on the 
market. You also figure out the difference between asking prices and fair 
market values. After you know what houses are really worth, you’re ready 
to focus on the specific neighborhood that you want to live in and begin 
seriously searching for your dream home.

252
Part IV: Making the Deal 
Making an offer to purchase
After you find your dream home, you’re ready for the next action step in the 
negotiating process: making an offer to purchase. No standard, universally 
accepted real estate purchase contract is used throughout the country. On 
the contrary, purchase contracts vary in length and terms from state to state 
and, within a state, from one locality to another.
We include the California Association of Realtors’ Residential Purchase 
Agreement in Appendix A so that you can see what a well-written, comprehen-
sive residential real estate contract looks like. When you’re ready to write an 
offer, your real estate agent or lawyer should provide a suitable contract for 
your area.
Real estate contracts are revised quite often because of such things as 
changes in real estate law and mandated seller disclosure requirements. A 
good agent or lawyer will use the most current version of the contract. Check 
the contract’s revision date (usually noted in the bottom-left or -right corner 
of each page) to make sure you’re not using a form just slightly newer than 
the Declaration of Independence.
Brute force versus style
Ray knows a real estate agent who’s a superb 
technician. He’s brilliant at determining a 
home’s fair market value; writes flawless con-
tracts; understands financing; and stays current 
on real estate laws, rules, and regulations. 
Technically, he’s impeccable.
Unfortunately, he has no compassion. He’s 
coldly perfect himself and expects equal 
perfection from everyone else. He’s an ultra-
hardball negotiator who neither gives nor 
expects mercy from his opponents. Some of his 
own clients don’t even like him, but they all 
respect him because they know that he’ll fight 
ruthlessly on their behalf.
Other agents hate working with this agent 
because he’s such a brutal negotiator. They 
deal with him only when they have absolutely 
no alternative. If he represents a buyer in a 
multiple-offer situation, for example, his buyer’s 
offer won’t be selected if the selling agent can 
find any way to work with another buyer whose 
agent is less combative.
Ray Jones, a San Francisco agent who died 
several years ago, was this agent’s exact 
opposite. Jones lacked technical polish, but he 
was kind, fair, and generous, and made folks 
smile with their hearts. His clients and other 
agents adored him. In a multiple-offer situation, 
his buyer’s offer was either accepted or at least 
counteroffered, if possible. He made buying a 
home fun.
Think carefully when selecting an agent to 
represent you. People do business with you for 
only two reasons: because they have to or 
because they want to. The right agent can give 
you a negotiating advantage. The ruthless 
negotiator may make sense for buyers who are 
in no hurry to buy and who desire to get a good 
deal on a property. For others, such a piranha 
could be bad news.

253
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
A carelessly worded, poorly thought-out offer can turn what should be a pro-
ductive negotiation into an adversarial struggle between you and the sellers. 
Instead of working together to solve your common problem (that is, “you 
want to buy, and they want to sell — how can we each get what we want?”), 
you get sidetracked by issues that can’t be resolved so early in the negotiating 
process.
Although buying a home can be a highly emotional experience, good offers 
defuse this potentially explosive situation by replacing emotion with facts. 
Buyers and sellers have feelings that can be hurt. Facts don’t. That’s why 
facts are the basis of successful negotiations.
All good offers have three things in common:
 
✓ Good offers are based on the sellers’ most important concern: a realis-
tic offering price. You shouldn’t pull the offering price out of thin air. 
Instead, base your offering price on houses (comparable to the seller’s 
house in age, size, condition, and location) that have sold within the 
past six months. As Chapter 10 explains, sellers’ asking prices are 
often fantasy. Actual sale prices of comparable houses are facts. Focus 
on facts.
 
✓ Good offers have realistic financing terms. Your mortgage’s interest 
rate, loan origination fee, and time allowed to obtain financing 
(explained in the upcoming section on contingencies) must be based on 
current lending conditions. Some offers get blown out of the water 
because a buyer’s loan terms are unrealistic. Focus on facts.
 
 If you’ve been prequalified or, better yet, preapproved for a loan (see 
Chapter 6), you or your agent should stress that advantage when you 
present your offer. This proves to the sellers that you’re a creditworthy 
buyer who’s ready, willing, and financially able to purchase their house.
 
✓ Good offers don’t expect a blank check from the sellers. Unless 
property defects are glaringly obvious, neither you nor the sellers will 
know whether any corrective work is needed at the time that your 
offer is initially submitted. Under these circumstances, it’s smart to use 
property-inspection clauses (explained in the next section) that enable 
you to reopen negotiations regarding any necessary corrective work 
after you’ve received the inspection reports.
 
 Remember that negotiation is an ongoing process. After the action of 
having your offer accepted, your property inspectors gather information. 
After they’ve determined what’s actually required in the way of correc-
tive work, you and the sellers can renew your negotiations (action) 
armed with hard facts (information). This sequence beats wasting time 
and energy by arguing with the sellers about the cost to complete 
corrective work before any of you know the precise number of dollars 
needed to do the repairs. Focus on facts.

254
Part IV: Making the Deal 
If the sellers agree with the price and terms contained in your offer, they’ll 
sign it. Their agent should give you a signed copy of the offer immediately. 
When you actually receive a copy of the offer signed by the sellers, you have 
what’s called a ratified offer (that is, a signed or accepted offer). This doesn’t 
mean that you own the house or that it has been sold. All you can say for 
now is that a sale is pending.
Leaving an escape hatch: Contingencies
Even though the sellers have accepted your offer, it should contain extremely 
important escape clauses known as contingencies, which you cleverly built 
into the contract to protect yourself. A contingency is some specific future 
event that must be satisfied in order for the sale to go through. It gives you 
the right to pull out of the deal if that event fails to happen. If you don’t 
remove a contingency, the sale falls apart, and your deposit money is usually 
returned.
These two contingencies appear in nearly every offer:
 
✓ Financing: You can pull out of the deal if the loan specified in your 
contract isn’t approved.
 
✓ Property inspections: You can pull out of the deal if you don’t approve 
the inspection reports or can’t reach an agreement with the sellers 
about how to handle any necessary repairs.
Other standard contingencies give you the right to review and approve such 
things as a condominium’s master deed, bylaws, and budget, as well as a 
property’s title report. You can, if you want, make the deal contingent upon 
events such as your lawyer’s approval of the contract, or your parents’ 
inspection of the house. As a rule, no reasonable contingency will be refused 
by the seller.
 
Don’t go overboard with contingencies if you’re competing for the property 
with several other buyers. Sellers, especially in strong real estate markets, 
don’t like offers with lots of contingencies. From their perspective, the more 
contingencies in an offer, the more likely the deal is to fall apart. You must 
delicately balance the need to protect yourself with the compelling need to 
have your offer accepted. Keep your contingency time frames realistic but 
short. Resolve as many simple questions as possible before submitting the 
offer. For instance, if your parents insist on seeing the property you want to 
buy before they’ll loan you money for a down payment, take them through the 
home before making your offer to eliminate that contingency.

255
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
If you’re considering making your offer subject to the sale of another house 
(such as the one you’re living in now), don’t do so if you’re in a bidding war 
with other buyers. Check out the section “Negotiating from a position of weak-
ness,” later in this chapter, for reasons why including this type of contingency 
could cost you the house you’re bidding on.
Here’s a typical loan contingency:
Conditioned [the magic word] upon buyer getting a 30-year, fixed-rate 
mortgage secured by the property in the amount of 80 percent of the 
purchase price. Said loan’s interest rate shall not exceed 7.5 percent. 
Loan fees/points shall not exceed 2 percent of loan amount. If buyer 
can’t obtain such financing within 30 days from acceptance of this offer, 
buyer must notify seller in writing of buyer’s election to cancel this 
contract and have buyer’s deposits returned.
If you want to see a more detailed financing contingency, read paragraph 2 of 
the California Association of Realtors’ purchase contract in Appendix A of 
this book. We cover property inspections in Chapter 13.
 
The purchase agreement you sign is meant to be a legally binding contract. As 
we say in Chapter 9, it’s wise to put a lawyer on your team immediately if you 
have any concerns about the legality of your contract. Even if you don’t have a 
lawyer when you sign the contract, including the following clause in your offer 
may be prudent if you have legal questions:
Conditioned upon my lawyer’s review and approval of this contract 
within five days from acceptance.
Using this clause doesn’t mean you actually have to hire a lawyer. It does, 
however, give you the option of having the contract reviewed later by a 
lawyer if you wish. By the way, good contracts provide space to write in 
additional terms and conditions. In the California Association of Realtors’ 
contract, it’s paragraph 25.
Include a provision in your contract that specifically states that contingen-
cies must be removed in writing. Doing so should eliminate confusion 
between you and the sellers regarding whether a contingency has been 
satisfied. See paragraph 14 of the California Association of Realtors’ contract 
for one way to handle this.
What good is a ratified offer filled with escape clauses? Well, a ratified offer 
(riddled with escape clauses or not) ties up the property. You don’t have to 
worry about the owners selling the property to someone else while you’re 
spending time and money inspecting it.
 
First get an agreement on the price and terms of sale — then get answers to all 
your other questions.

Part IV: Making the Deal 
Getting a counteroffer
It’s highly unlikely that the sellers will accept your offer as it’s originally 
written. Even if they love your offering price, they’ll probably tweak your 
offer here and there to make it acceptable to them. Sellers use counteroffers 
to fine-tune the price, terms, and conditions of offers they receive.
You’ll be relieved to know that counteroffer forms are far less complicated 
than offer forms. Take a look at the California Association of Realtors’ Counter 
Offer in Figure 12-1, for example, and you’ll see that it’s only a one-page form.
Suppose that you offer $275,000 for a home that you like, and you ask to close 
escrow 30 days after the sellers accept your offer. Because they had the 
house listed at $289,500, the sellers think that your offering price is a mite 
low. Furthermore, they need six weeks to relocate.
Instead of rewriting your entire offer, they give you a counteroffer. It states 
that they’re willing to accept all the terms and conditions of your offer except 
that they want $285,000 and six weeks after acceptance to close escrow.
The ball’s in your court once again. You don’t mind a six-week close of 
escrow, but you don’t want to pay more than $280,000, so you give the sellers 
a counter-counteroffer to that effect.
Now only one bone of contention remains: the price. The sellers come back 
to you with a firm $284,000. You grudgingly respond at $281,000 and instruct 
your agent to make it clear to the sellers that you won’t go any higher. Two 
can play the firm game. Negotiations now resemble the trench warfare of 
World War I.
If you really want the home, this phase of the game can be nerve-racking. You 
worry about another buyer making the sellers a better offer and stealing the 
house away while you’re trying to get the price down that last $3,000. The 
sellers are equally concerned that they’ll lose you by pushing too hard for 
the final $3,000. You don’t want to pay a penny more than you have to. The 
sellers don’t want to leave any money on the table.
You and the sellers are tantalizingly close to agreement on price. Your offer-
ing price and the sellers’ asking price are both factually based on recent sales 
of comparable houses in the neighborhood. So why the deadlock? Because 
sometimes the same facts can lead to different conclusions (see the sidebar 
“Fact versus opinion,” earlier in this chapter).
An equitable way to resolve this type of impasse is to split the difference fifty-
fifty. If the sellers in our example use this technique, they’ll come back to you 
with a $282,500 offer — down $1,500 from their firm asking price of $284,000 
and up $1,500 from your firm offering price of $281,000. The mutual $1,500 
concession equals less than 1 percent of the home’s fair market value based 
on a $282,500 sale price. That’s pinpoint accuracy in a real estate transaction.

Splitting the difference won’t work in all situations. It is, however, a fair way to 
quickly resolve relatively small differences of opinion (a few percent or less of 
the home’s price) so you can make a deal and get on with your life.

Part IV: Making the Deal 
The Finer Points of Negotiating
A perfectly balanced market that favors neither buyer nor seller is rare. The 
market is almost always in a state of flux. As a result, the playing field usually 
tilts toward the buyer or seller.
Negotiating when the playing 
field isn’t level
President Lyndon Johnson was a consummate politician. He’d cajole, prom-
ise, arm-twist, flatter, pressure, sweet-talk, threaten, jawbone, wheedle, bully, 
or horse-trade other politicians into supporting his legislation.
The late president’s negotiating skills were legendary. Once, when accused of 
using somewhat unethical tactics to get the votes required to pass one of his 
Great Society programs, LBJ just shrugged. “Sorry you feel that way, son,” he 
supposedly said. “All I ever wanted was my unfair advantage.”
In a perfect world, you’d always have an unfair advantage. Unfortunately, the 
world is imperfect. No matter how good you are as a negotiator, sooner or 
later you’ll have to negotiate from a position of weakness. The trick in these 
circumstances is to give yourself every possible advantage.
Buyer’s and seller’s markets
In the early 2000s, many home buyers complained bitterly about sellers 
taking unfair advantage of them. Given the seller’s market at that time in 
many parts of the country, it wasn’t unusual for owners of a well-priced 
house to receive multiple offers on it while their agent was still nailing up 
the For Sale sign. (Slight exaggeration, but you get the point.) Five years 
later, the hobnailed boot was on the other foot. Instead of a supply-demand 
imbalance, there was a demand-supply imbalance. The anguished screams 
now came from sellers who were complaining about buyers taking unfair 
advantage of them.
 
The party in the weaker position always characterizes the market as “bad.” 
Because you’re a seeker of wisdom and truth, don’t kid yourself. The market 
is, in reality, neither good nor bad. The market is impersonal. The market is 
the market. Moaning and groaning about unfair market dynamics won’t help 
you if you’re caught in a seller’s market any more than complaining helps 
sellers caught in the viselike grip of a buyer’s market.

259
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
Negotiating from a position of weakness
Newly listed homes that are priced to sell often generate multiple offers in a 
seller’s market. But even when the market isn’t a seller’s market, a well-
priced, attractive new listing may draw multiple offers.
 
Unless you absolutely must have a particular home and price is no object, be 
careful about entering a bidding war. Such auctions can drive the price of a 
home above its fair market value. That situation is great for the seller, but it is 
financially deadly for you. We don’t want you to overpay.
If you really want a home and you know that other offers will be made, here’s 
how to improve your chances of winning in a multiple-offer situation:
 
✓ Use comparable sales data to predetermine the upper limit of what 
you’ll pay. Don’t get caught up by the excitement of a bidding war 
and let your emotions override your common sense. Be sure that you 
read Chapter 10 and you know how to determine fair market value. Set 
no-matter-what limits on the amount that you’ll bid. Otherwise, you 
could grossly overpay.
 
✓ Put yourself in the sellers’ position. The sellers don’t care how long 
you’ve been looking for a home or how little you can afford to pay. 
Faced with several offers, sellers select the offer that gives them the best 
combination of price, terms, and contingencies of sale. Find out what the 
sellers’ needs are before making your offer. Their self-interest invariably 
prevails.
 
 A high purchase price isn’t the only way to sweeten a deal. If you have 
the money, make an extra-large (25 or 30 percent or more of the pur-
chase price) down payment so the sellers know that your loan will 
surely be approved. Or you could offer to let the sellers rent back their 
house for a month or two after the close of escrow (see Chapter 14), or 
give the sellers an extra-long close of escrow so they have plenty of time 
to find another home. You could also offer to buy the home “as is” so 
the sellers won’t have to pay for any corrective work. If you do this, 
however, make your offer contingent upon your approval of inspection 
reports so you can get out of the deal if the house needs too much work.
 
✓ Make your best offer initially. Buyers who win bidding contests, in 
the words of Civil War General Nathan Bedford Forrest, get there 
“firstest with the mostest.” If you want the house, don’t hold back in a 
multiple-offer situation: You may never get a second chance to make 
your best offer.
 
✓ Get preapproved for a loan. Informed sellers worry about the financial 
strength of prospective buyers. They don’t want to waste their time on 
buyers who can’t qualify for a loan. All other things being equal, if you’re 
preapproved for a loan (see Chapter 6), you should prevail over buyers 
whose financial status is in doubt. And if you’ve been preapproved for a 
loan, you’ll know that you aren’t wasting your time and money on a 
house that you may not qualify to buy.

260
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Don’t make your offer subject to the sale of another house. As dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter in the section on contingencies, if you 
own a house that you must sell in order to get the down payment for 
your new home, you’re in trouble. You’ll most likely be competing with 
other buyers who don’t have that limitation. The sellers have enough 
problems selling their house without worrying about whether you can 
sell yours. Why should they take your offer if they can accept one 
without a subject-to-sale contingency in it? Offers made subject to the 
sale of another house get no respect in a multiple-offer situation.
 
✓ If you must sell in order to buy, put your old house on the market 
before seriously looking for a new home. Ideally, you’ll have a ratified 
offer on your old house before making an offer to buy a new place. 
Then, even with a subject-to-sale clause, your negotiating position 
will be much stronger. And you won’t waste time worrying about how 
much money you’ll have when and if your house sells. Stipulate a long 
close of escrow on the old house and the right to rent it back for several 
months after the sale so that you’ll have adequate lead time to buy 
your new home.
Spotting fake sellers
Why would anyone want to be a fake seller? That some people would 
knowingly waste their time and money on an exercise in futility is absurd.
The key word is knowingly. All sellers start out thinking that they’re sincere. 
As the quest for a buyer continues, however, circumstances ultimately prove 
that some sellers are phony.
Fake sellers cleverly mimic genuine sellers. Like real sellers, counterfeit 
sellers sign listing agreements, have For Sale signs in their yards, advertise 
in newspapers, and have open houses on Sundays. They outwardly appear 
to be the real McCoy. If you don’t know how to detect fake sellers, you’ll 
waste your precious time, energy, and money by fruitlessly negotiating to 
buy a house that isn’t really for sale.
Identifying bogus sellers is ridiculously easy once you know how. Here are 
five simple tests that you can use to spot the fakes.
Are the sellers realistic?
The number-one reason that houses don’t sell is that they have unrealistic 
asking prices. When people categorically state that they “can’t” sell a grossly 
overpriced house, they expose themselves as fakes. What they’re actually 
saying is that they refuse to accept the market’s opinion of what their house 
is worth. People who won’t listen to reason aren’t sellers — they’re property 
owners masquerading as sellers.

261
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
Real sellers may inadvertently overprice their homes initially. Unlike fake 
sellers, however, they eventually wise up. They know that they have a prob-
lem if they get no offers (or only low-ball offers). Authentic sellers accept the 
relevance of using recent sales of comparable houses in the neighborhood to 
establish their house’s fair market value. Genuine sellers are realistic.
Are the sellers motivated?
Most folks don’t sell their homes to generate commissions for real estate 
agents. Sellers are usually motivated by a life change, such as wedding bells, 
a job transfer, family expansion, retirement, or a death in the family. Perhaps 
the sellers are in contract to buy another home but can’t complete the 
purchase until their house sells. Or their house may be in foreclosure. Real 
sellers always have a motive for selling.
Sometimes, homes sell for more 
than the asking price
Amy was a buyer who knew precisely what she 
wanted. Her dream home didn’t have to be 
large. It did, however, need a light and airy feel-
ing, a gourmet kitchen, nice views, a beautiful 
garden, and a garage. She’d been house hunt-
ing a long time because she refused to settle for 
anything less than her dream home.
Amy had a good agent. When a house that met 
all of Amy’s specifications was listed at $295,000, 
Amy and her agent were waiting at the front 
door on the first day that the house was opened 
for inspection.
They weren’t alone. The home was mobbed 
with drooling buyers and agents. Everything 
about the property, including its finely honed 
price, was flawless. The house was definitely 
priced to sell.
The listing agent told everyone that offers would 
be accepted in two days. Given the high level of 
buyer interest, Amy’s agent knew that there 
would be multiple offers. She suggested that 
Amy could probably beat the competition by 
offering $5,000 over the asking price. Based on 
the sale price of comparable houses in the 
neighborhood, the agent said the home was 
priced at (or perhaps slightly below) its fair 
market value. If all the other offers came in right 
at full asking price, Amy’s $300,000 offer would 
stand out from the crowd.
Amy refused. Why, she reasoned, spend an 
extra $5,000 if she didn’t have to? A full-price 
offer certainly wouldn’t insult the sellers. If that 
wasn’t enough money, Amy was sure that the 
sellers would give her a counteroffer.
She was wrong. The sellers didn’t counter any 
of the many offers they received. Instead, they 
simply accepted the highest offer, which wasn’t 
Amy’s.
Amy took a calculated risk. She could’ve been 
right. In fact, we’ve seen multiple-offer situa-
tions in which not one of the offers was close to 
full asking price. Multiple offers are no guaran-
tee that a house will sell at or over its asking 
price.
Each situation is different and must be evalu-
ated on its own merits. And don’t forget to look 
at the comparable sales data.

262
Part IV: Making the Deal 
In dire situations, such as an impending foreclosure or divorce, sellers often 
instruct their agents not to tell anyone why they’re selling. If possible, how-
ever, find out why the house is being sold before making your offer. Knowing 
the sellers’ motivation allows you to shape your offer’s terms (that is, quick 
close of escrow, letting the sellers rent back the house after the sale, and the 
like) to fit the sellers’ circumstances.
 
Lack of motivation is a gigantic red flag. If the sellers or their agent say that 
they’re testing the market, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.
Do the sellers have a time frame?
Deadlines make things happen. Seller deadlines are often established by such 
things as when the twins are due, when school starts, when they have to 
begin new jobs in another city, when the escrow is due to close on the 
new home that they’re buying, and so on. Authentic sellers always have a 
deadline within which they must complete their sale.
Time is a powerful negotiating tool. If you aren’t under pressure to buy and 
the sellers must sell immediately (if not sooner), time is your pal and their 
enemy. Conversely, if you have less than four weeks to find a place to live 
before the kids start school, the watch is on the other wrist. Ideally, you 
know the sellers’ deadline, but they don’t know yours. Most real negotiation 
occurs at the 11th hour, 59th minute, and 59th second of a 12-hour deadline.
 
You could be in deep trouble if you have a deadline and the sellers don’t. If 
you reveal this information to the sellers, they may use your deadline to 
beat you to a pulp. Beware of procrastination. Don’t let time bully you — and 
keep your deadlines to yourself.
Are the sellers forthright?
Genuine sellers are disarmingly candid about their house’s physical, 
financial, and legal status. They know that withholding vital information 
endangers the sale and may lead to a lawsuit. Early disclosure of possible 
problems, on the other hand, gives everyone the lead time required to 
solve them. Real sellers don’t have a “buyer beware” mindset.
If you keep getting nasty surprises, you’re working with fake sellers. 
Straightforward folks have only one defense against devious sellers who are 
playing an expensive, and possibly even devastating, game of “I’ve Got a 
Secret”: Terminate the transaction.
Are the sellers cooperative?
Real sellers look for ways to make transactions go more smoothly. They 
work with you to solve problems rather than waste time trying to figure out 
who’s to blame if something goes wrong. Genuine sellers have a let’s-make-it-
happen attitude. They’re deal-makers, not deal-breakers.

263
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
 
Inconsistent behavior is a red flag. If the sellers suddenly start missing con-
tract deadlines or become strangely uncooperative, they may have lost their 
motivation to sell. Perhaps the wedding was postponed or the new job fell 
through. Whatever the reason, people sometimes switch from being real 
sellers to being fakes in mid-transaction. Find out why the sellers are acting 
strangely as soon as you notice the change, and you may be able to head off 
the problem. If you ignore the danger signs, you’ll never know what hit you 
when the deal blows up in your face.
Low-balling
A low-ball offer is one that’s far below a property’s actual fair market value. 
An example of a low-ball offer is a $150,000 offer on a house that’s worth 
every penny of $200,000.
Who makes low-ball offers? Sometimes, it’s a graduate from one of those 
scuzzy, get-rich-quick real estate seminars. Another low-ball offer may come 
from somebody who’s bottom-fishing for sellers in dire financial distress. 
More often, however, low-balling is a negotiating tactic used by people who 
state categorically, “No one ever pays full asking price. You always have to 
start low to end up with a fair price.”
Those statements aren’t true, of course. When you do your homework, you 
know the difference between well-priced properties and overpriced turkeys. 
(See Chapter 10 for a brush-up.)
Why low-balling is usually a bad idea
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, low-balling a well-priced house breaks 
the first rule of a good offer: Make a realistic offering price based on the sale 
price of comparable houses. Because skillful negotiators understand both 
sides of the issue, imagine that you’re the seller of a house that’s priced as 
close as humanly possible to its fair market value.
Several days after your house goes on the market, you receive an offer with 
an absurdly low purchase price. After the vein in your neck stops pounding, 
what conclusions can you form about the low-balling buyers?
 
✓ Taken in the best possible light, the buyers obviously haven’t done 
their homework regarding comparable home sales. Because they’re 
grossly ignorant about fair market value, why should you try to educate 
them?
 
✓ Maybe the buyers think that you don’t know what your house is really 
worth and are trying to exploit your ignorance. (That vein starts 
throbbing again.)

264
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Perhaps the buyers are trying to steal your house based on a mistaken 
impression that you’re desperate to sell. There’s a name for critters 
that prey on misfortune: vultures.
None of these conclusions is at all favorable. As a seller, you’d probably make 
one of the following responses to buyers who low-balled your well-priced 
house:
 
✓ Let the buyers know that their offer is totally unacceptable by having 
your agent return it with a message that you wouldn’t sell your house 
to them if they were the last buyers on earth. Why make a counteroffer 
to people who are either idiots or scoundrels?
 
✓ Make a full-price counteroffer. To show your contempt for the buyers, 
you’ll hardball them on each and every term and condition in their offer. 
(Two can play this game.)
 
Buyers who low-ball a well-priced property listed by sellers who can wait for a 
better offer destroy any chance of developing the mutual trust and sense of 
fair play on which cooperative negotiation is based. Bargaining is fine, but you 
must find a motivated seller and not aim too low. Starting at 25 percent below 
what the home is worth generally won’t work unless the seller is desperate.
When low offers are justified
There’s a huge difference between submitting an offer that’s at the low end of 
a house’s fair market value and low-balling. Suppose that you offer $280,000 
for a home listed at $299,500. You base your offering price on the fact that 
comparable houses in the neighborhood recently sold in the $280,000-to-
$295,000 price range. You’re at the low end of the range of fair market values. 
The sellers are at the high end. You’re both being realistic.
If your offer is based on actual sales of comparable houses, it won’t insult 
the seller. Such a low offer will, however, spark lively debate as both of you 
attempt to defend your respective prices. Coming in on the low side of a 
property’s fair market value is fine as long as you have plenty of time to 
negotiate and reason to believe that the seller is motivated.
 
In situations like the preceding one, your best bet is to have an encyclopedic 
comparable market analysis and an agent who has personally eyeballed all the 
comps. Follow the guidelines that we discuss in Chapter 10.
A low offer is justified only when it isn’t a low-ball offer. Ironically, some 
sellers provoke low offers by their unwise pricing. These sellers insist on 
leaving room to negotiate in their price because they “know” that buyers 
never pay full asking price.

265
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
Sound familiar? This practice, unfortunately, becomes a self-fulfilling proph-
ecy. When buyers who know property values make an offer on an overpriced 
house, their initial offering price is usually on the low side to give themselves 
room to negotiate. What goes around comes around.
Suppose that a house’s fair market value is $300,000. If the sellers put this 
house on the market at $360,000 so they’ll have a 20-percent negotiating 
cushion, and you offer $240,000 for the same reason, you and the sellers 
start out $120,000 apart. It takes a heap of extra negotiating to bridge a gap 
that big.
 
Don’t play their silly game unless you have time to squander. Make your initial 
offer at the low end of the house’s fair market value, and see how the sellers 
respond to it. If they refuse to accept the hard evidence of recent comparable 
home sales in the neighborhood, don’t waste valuable time trying to educate 
them. They aren’t sellers yet — they’re property owners masquerading as 
sellers. If you want the house, bide your time. Don’t make your move until 
they wise up and lower their price, or their agent puts the word out that 
they’re motivated sellers who won’t turn down any reasonable offer.
Negotiating credits in escrow
Putting a “let’s sell it” price on a house isn’t always enough to get the house 
sold, especially in a buyer’s (weak) market. Sellers often find that they have 
to give buyers money in the form of seller-paid financial concessions in order 
to close the deal. The two most common concessions are for nonrecurring 
closing costs and corrective work.
Nonrecurring closing costs
Some sellers come right out and tell you that they’ll pay your nonrecurring 
closing costs if doing so will help put a deal together. Nonrecurring closing 
costs are one-time charges for such things as your appraisal, loan points, 
credit report, title insurance, and property inspections. If you’ve read 
Chapter 3, you know that we’re talking big bucks here. Closing costs can 
amount to 3 to 5 percent of the purchase price.
 
Even if the sellers don’t offer to pay your nonrecurring closing costs, asking 
for this concession as one of the terms in your offer usually won’t hurt. Two 
general exceptions to this rule are when it’s a seller’s (strong) market or when 
you’re in a multiple-offer situation.
Here’s how the credit works. Say that you’ve signed a contract to buy a 
$250,000 house. You have $55,000 in cash, and the escrow officer has just 
told you that you’ll have nonrecurring closing costs totaling 4 percent 
($10,000) of the purchase price.

266
Part IV: Making the Deal 
About now, you may be wondering, “Why not just reduce the purchase 
price to $240,000 instead of asking the sellers for a $10,000 credit?” After 
all, the sellers’ net proceeds of the sale are the same either way, and simply 
reducing the purchase price is less complicated. Not to mention that because 
property taxes are often based on the purchase price, a lower purchase 
price will probably cut your annual tax bite.
The reason: If you’re short of cash, as most buyers are, a credit is more 
helpful than a price reduction. If you have to pay $10,000 in closing costs, 
you won’t have enough cash left to make a 20 percent ($48,000) down 
payment on your $240,000 home. With less than 20 percent down, your 
monthly loan costs increase because you have to pay a higher interest rate 
on your mortgage, plus private-mortgage-insurance costs. Neither will you 
have any cash left over for emergencies. Under these circumstances, you’d 
probably decide to buy a less expensive house.
Contrast that scenario with paying $250,000 for the house and getting a credit 
from the sellers for nonrecurring closing costs. After putting 20 percent 
($50,000) cash down to get the loan with the lowest interest rate, you still 
have $5,000 in the bank thanks to the $10,000 credit. The credit makes the 
deal happen.
 
If you have plenty of cash, get a price reduction rather than a credit. In most 
areas, the lower your purchase price, the lower your annual property taxes. 
Just be aware that most agents will lobby for the credit because a price 
reduction cuts into their commissions.
Corrective work
Typically, neither you nor the sellers know how much, if any, corrective work 
is needed when you submit your offer. Therefore, purchase contracts have 
provisions for additional negotiations regarding corrective work credits after 
all the necessary inspections have been completed.
If the property inspectors find that little or no corrective work is required, 
you have little or nothing to negotiate. Suppose, however, that your inspec-
tors discover the $250,000 house you want to buy needs $25,000 of corrective 
work for termite and dry-rot damage, foundation repairs, and a new roof. Big 
corrective-work bills can be deal killers.
 
Seeing is believing. We strongly recommend that you and the seller’s agent 
be present, if possible, during property inspections so that you both actually 
see the damage. And when you receive the inspection reports, use them as 
negotiating tools. Give the sellers copies of the reports for them to review 
before you meet with them to negotiate a corrective work credit.

267
 Chapter 12: Negotiating Your Best Deal
This is the moment of truth in most home sales. Sellers usually don’t want to 
pay for the corrective work. Neither do you. The deal will fall through if this 
impasse can’t be resolved.
At this point in the negotiations, it’s critical that the sellers realize that the 
value of their house has just been reduced by the cost required to repair it. 
If comparable houses with no termite or dry-rot damage, with solid founda-
tions, and with good roofs are selling for $250,000, the sellers’ house is worth 
only $225,000 in its present condition. Given its reduced value, an 80 percent 
loan is $180,000 — not $200,000 based on a $250,000 fair market value. If you 
can borrow only $180,000 and the sellers refuse to reduce the selling price 
from $250,000 to $225,000, you have to drop out of the deal.
The sellers may refuse to pay for repairs found by inspectors that you’ve 
hired. The sellers may question the impartiality or validity of your inspection 
reports and order their own inspections to verify or refute yours. The sellers 
may even threaten to pull out of the contract if you don’t back off on your 
demands.
Sellers who try to punish the messenger are usually making a big mistake. 
You didn’t bring the damage with you when you came, and (luckily for you) 
you won’t take it with you when you go. Like it or not, the sellers are stuck 
with it. If they drive you away, they may still have a legal obligation to tell 
other buyers what you’ve discovered. That disclosure will probably lower 
the price that any future buyer will pay for their house. All things considered, 
working things out with you will probably be faster (and no more expensive) 
than waiting for another buyer.
 
Lenders also participate in corrective-work problems. They get copies of 
inspection reports when borrowers tell them that a serious repair problem 
exists, when their appraisal indicates a property obviously needs major 
repairs, or when the purchase contract contains a credit for extensive repairs. 
Whenever the property’s loan-to-value ratio exceeds 80 percent, lenders 
actively help buyers and sellers resolve corrective-work problems.
You can solve repair problems in a variety of ways:
 
✓ Ideally, the sellers leave enough money in escrow to cover the 
required corrective work with instructions for the escrow officer 
to pay the contractors as their work is completed. This strategy has 
several advantages. You can supervise the work to be sure that it’s 
done properly by contractors of your choice. The sellers don’t have to 
suffer through having the work done while they’re living in the house, 
and they don’t have to incur any liability for the workmanship. Last but 
not least, the lender knows that the work will be done.

268
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Alternatively, the lender withholds a portion of the full loan amount 
in a passbook savings account until the corrective work has been 
completed. In cases involving major corrective work, the lender may 
refuse to fund the loan until the problems have been corrected.
 
✓ The sellers may give a credit for corrective work directly to buyers at 
the close of escrow. Lenders usually don’t approve of this approach, 
because it raises uncertainties about whether the corrective work will 
actually be completed. If it isn’t, the security of the lender’s loan is 
impaired.
 
 You can make the sellers feel better by offering to get competitive bids 
on the work from several reputable, licensed contractors. As long as 
the lowest bidder will do a quality job in a timely fashion, you and the 
sellers benefit. This additional effort on your part shows the sellers that 
you don’t want to get rich off their misfortune. All you want is what you 
thought you were buying in the first place: a well-maintained home with 
a good foundation and a roof that doesn’t leak. Empathy is an excellent 
negotiating tactic.

G
iven how much houses cost today, it’s idiotic not to have the home you 
plan to purchase carefully inspected before buying it. Skipping inspec-
tions to save a few bucks (relatively speaking) could be the most expensive 
mistake you ever make. Think of your biggest fiscal fiasco ever and multiply 
it by a hundred. That gives you some idea of the magnitude of the boo-boo 
you may make if you buy a home without first having it thoroughly inspected 
from foundation to roof.
Why are we so obsessed with property inspections? According to a study 
commissioned by The Wall Street Journal and conducted by housing econo-
mist Robert Sheehan, approximately two out of every five houses have at 
least one major defect. If the odds were two out of five that you’d get hit by a 
car the next time you walked across the street, you’d be pretty darn careful 
to inspect oncoming traffic before crossing!
Conducting Thorough Inspections
A home’s physical condition greatly affects its value. You’d feel horrible if 
you paid top dollar for a home that you thought was in tiptop shape and 
discovered after you bought it that the house was riddled with expensive 
defects. Yet unless you’re a professional property inspector, you probably 
don’t have the faintest idea how much corrective work a house needs simply 
by looking at it.

270
Part IV: Making the Deal 
Believe it or not, buying homes was even riskier a generation ago. The 
prevailing attitude then was extremely simple: “Buyer beware.”
Today, fortunately, the situation has improved. Most states (but certainly 
not all) now require that sellers and real estate agents make full, immediate 
disclosure to prospective buyers of all known mechanical, structural, and 
legal problems associated with owner-occupied residential property. If this 
trend continues, the time may come when the warning shifts to “Seller and 
real estate agent beware.” (Real estate agents also have liability if they fail to 
disclose a known problem about a property.)
 
Don’t let your guard down. Even though the real estate market is a tad more 
consumer-friendly than it used to be, don’t be lulled into a false sense of 
complacency. Latent defects — hidden problems that sellers and their agents 
aren’t aware of regarding the home you’re buying — can get you into a heap of 
budget-busting trouble after you complete your purchase.
If you haven’t read Chapter 12 yet, take a quick look at the section about 
negotiating either a corrective-work credit or a price reduction. You can 
see how to use property inspections so that they pay for themselves many 
times over.
All properties should be inspected
Overinspecting a house is much better than underinspecting it. Suppose that 
you spend $350 to have the home you want to buy completely inspected by a 
qualified inspector, and you find out that nothing is wrong with it. Did you 
waste your money? Nope. You can sleep soundly, knowing that your home 
doesn’t need any corrective work.
If, conversely, you skip the inspection to save $350 and later discover that 
your house needs $35,000 worth of repairs, you end up spending $100 in 
repairs for every dollar that you “saved.” Such a deal! You may as well “save” 
money by not putting coins into parking meters and consider walloping 
parking tickets a normal driving expense!
Here’s a list of properties that must be inspected prior to purchase:
 
✓ Used houses: You’re most likely to order inspections if your “new” home 
is someone else’s used house. Obviously, the older the house, the 
greater the likelihood that you’ll find defects in its mechanical and 
structural systems.
 
✓ New houses: Even if you’re buying a newly constructed, never-been-
lived-in home, having it thoroughly inspected is wise. Just because the 
building is new doesn’t guarantee that it was built properly. Believe it or 

271
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
not, brand-new houses often have construction flaws, sometimes major 
ones. Some home builders aren’t competent, or they cut corners to save 
some money and boost their profits.
 
✓ Condominiums: You need an inspection before buying a condominium. 
Don’t forget that when you buy a condo, you’re also buying into the 
entire building in which your condo is located (see Chapter 8). As a 
co-owner of the building, you must pay your proportional share of the 
cost for corrective work required in common areas, such as the roof, 
heating system, or foundation.
 
✓ Townhouses, cooperative apartments, and all other forms of co-
ownership property: See the preceding bullet point about condomini-
ums. Shared ownership doesn’t get you off the hook. You still need 
property inspections.
 
✓ Foreclosed property: If you’re thinking of buying a foreclosed home 
from a lender who got title to the property because no one purchased 
it at an auction, it’s imperative that you have the house scrupulously 
scrutinized from top to bottom. You don’t need a professional property 
inspector to tell you someone removed fixtures and appliances — you 
can see that with your own eyes. What you can’t see is invisible stuff. 
Perhaps the copper wiring and pipes were pulled out of some walls and 
sold for scrap value, or maybe the previous owners poured acid down 
the kitchen and bathroom drains to sabotage the house. In the case of 
new construction that ends up in foreclosure, the inspector may, for 
example, discover wiring without junction boxes, or junction boxes 
without switches or fixtures attached to them. (See Chapter 8 for more 
details on foreclosures.)
 
All properties need inspecting. Period. Inspect detached residences, attached 
residences, single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, condos, co-ops, 
townhouses, and anything else that has a foundation and a roof. If you’re 
spending big bucks for a property, protect your investment by having it 
inspected.
The two types of defects: 
Patent and latent
Property defects come in two general categories: patent and latent.
 
✓ Patent defects are right out in the open for the world to see. You don’t 
need a professional property inspector to point out glaringly obvious 
stuff like water stains on the ceiling, cracks in the wall, or a flooded 
basement. You do, however, need a trained professional to tell you 
whether these defects are signs of major problems or merely inconse-
quential blemishes.

272
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Latent defects can be even more financially devastating than patent 
defects because they’re hidden. Like playing a high-priced game of hide-
and-seek, you must find latent defects or literally pay the consequences.
 
 Latent defects are out of sight — behind walls or concealed in inaccessi-
ble areas under the house or up in the attic, away from casual observa-
tion. Faulty wiring, termite damage, a cracked heat exchanger in the 
furnace, and health- and safety-code problems (such as lead in the water 
pipes and asbestos insulation) are some examples of latent physical 
flaws.
 
 If you’re considering a bank-owned foreclosed property, it may not be 
possible for your inspector to check water pressure, test for leaky pipes, 
and check pilot lights in the stove or furnace if water, gas, and electricity 
have been shut off. In that case, insist that the lender get the utilities 
turned on again so you can complete your inspection.
 
 Legal blemishes, such as zoning violations and fraudulent title claims, 
illustrate another kind of latent defect that only experts can detect.
Patent defect red flags
You don’t have to be a professional inspector to give property a basic once-
over. Even the rankest amateur can check the water pressure and turn on 
water faucets to see whether they leak. Flipping light switches on and off 
and flushing the toilets to find out whether they work properly are easy 
but effective tests. Open the refrigerator to see whether it’s cold inside. 
Turn on the stove’s heating elements to see whether they get hot. You may 
be surprised how many defects you discover with these simple tests.
By the same token, you can spot the danger signs of possibly serious struc-
tural problems even if you’ve never had any special training, as long as you 
know what to look for as you walk through a property. Although we advocate 
that you hire a professional property inspector, here’s a list of red flags that 
even a mechanically challenged home buyer should be able to spot:
 
✓ Cracks: Check the property’s foundation, interior walls, exterior retain-
ing walls, fireplace, chimney, concrete floors (basement, garage, and 
the like), and sidewalk for large cracks. Any crack that you can stick a 
pencil into is a large crack. Watch for vertical cracks on any walls and 
long horizontal or diagonal cracks on exterior walls.
 
✓ Moisture: Look for water stains on ceilings, walls, and floors. Feel base-
ment walls for dampness. Sniff out the source of moldy smells. Check 
for drainage problems inside and out by looking for standing water. A 
sump pump in the basement or garage is a red flag waving to get your 
attention.

273
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
 
✓ Stickiness: All doors (exterior, interior, garage, and cabinets) and 
windows should open and close easily.
 
✓ Looseness: You shouldn’t be able to see daylight around windows, 
doors, or skylights.
 
✓ Unevenness: Floors shouldn’t slope, and walls shouldn’t bulge.
 
✓ Insects: If the house you’re buying is made of wood or wood and stucco, 
it may have problems with wood-destroying insects or organisms. Mud 
tubes along a house’s foundation or in its basement are a sign of termite 
infestation. Look carefully at those areas of the property that come into 
contact with the earth — foundation, decks, garage, and fencing — for 
signs of decayed or rotted wood.
 
✓ Slides: Check hillsides immediately behind the property to see whether 
they have netting on them or show evidence of recent earth or mud-
slides.
 
 Before you have the property inspected, discuss any red flags you 
discover with your property inspector. Let the pro check them out to 
see whether they’re major problems or only relatively minor flaws that 
you can quickly and inexpensively correct. A sticking front door, for 
example, can indicate either that the house has expensive foundation 
problems or simply that the door absorbed moisture because it wasn’t 
properly sealed.
Types of property inspections
What inspections should you get to protect your investment? That depends 
on what area of the country you live in, how the building in question is con-
structed, and what you plan to do to the property after buying it. Here are 
the three most common types of inspections — which we recommend be 
done after you have an accepted offer to purchase but before removing your 
inspection contingencies (so that you’re able to negotiate the correction of 
problems discovered by the inspections, as we recommend in Chapter 12):
 
✓ Prepurchase interior- and exterior-components inspection: No matter 
whether you’re buying a wood-frame cottage in the country or an urban 
condo in a 20-story steel-and-concrete building, you need a complete 
inspection of the property’s interior and exterior. The inspection should 
cover such areas as the roof and gutters, plumbing, electrical work, 
heating and cooling systems, insulation, smoke detectors, kitchen, 
bathroom, and foundation. The inspection should also point out health, 
safety, and environmental hazards. This type of inspection usually takes 
several hours to complete and costs $300 to $600, depending on how 
large the property is and the inspection’s length and degree of detail.

274
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
 Don’t be surprised if the property inspector recommends additional 
inspections. Good property inspectors are generalists who are trained 
to spot red flags. Like doctors who are general practitioners, good 
property inspectors refer their clients to specialists — such as roofers, 
structural engineers, and pest control inspectors — if they discover a 
problem beyond their scope of expertise. Property inspectors know 
that you can’t make good decisions unless you have the best possible 
information.
 
✓ Pest control inspection: Warm climates, such as in the South and West, 
are a mixed blessing. You’re not the only one who loves warm, balmy 
weather. So do termites, carpenter ants, powderpost beetles, dry rot, 
fungi, and other wood-munching infestations or infections. If these are a 
problem in your area, you also need a pest control inspection. These 
inspections generally cost $150 to $400.
 
 Pest control inspections are very limited in scope — the inspectors 
check for property damage caused only by wood-destroying insects 
(infestations) and organisms (infections, such as dry rot and fungi). 
Although homes made of wood or wood and stucco are the wood 
destroyers’ primary targets, even brick homes aren’t safe. If you get a 
pest control inspection, it should be in addition to your prepurchase 
interior- and exterior-components inspection — not in lieu of it.
 
✓ Architect’s or general contractor’s inspection: You need an architect 
or a general contractor on your team if you’re buying a fixer-upper, 
intending to do corrective work, or planning a major property renova-
tion, such as adding rooms or installing a new bathroom. The architect 
or general contractor can tell you whether what you want to do is 
structurally possible and meets local planning codes for such things as 
height restrictions and lot coverage. This inspector can also give you 
time and cost estimates for the project.
 
 Architects and general contractors usually don’t charge for their initial 
property inspection because they’re hoping to get your business. 
Although these people provide a valuable service, take their reports 
with a grain of salt. Don’t expect them to give you a completely objective 
assessment as to whether you should buy the property because they’d 
probably love to do the work for you.
Inspecting inspectors
Unfortunately, some people who anoint themselves “home inspectors” have 
neither the background nor the training to do proper prepurchase home 
inspections. To compound the problem, most states don’t certify, license, or 

275
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
regulate home inspectors. If you have a clipboard, a pickup truck, and a good 
“houseside manner,” you too can be a home inspector nearly anywhere in 
the country.
 
Worse yet, some contractors inspect houses and then do the corrective work 
that they discover during their own inspections. That situation ought to start 
a red flag waving in your mind. Unscrupulous contractors can — and do — 
manipulate this conflict of interest to their advantage by finding and creating 
work for themselves.
One way around this problem is to hire someone who only does inspections. 
A growing number of property inspectors are exactly that: professional prop-
erty inspectors, not contractors. This distinction is more than just semantic. 
Performing property inspections requires a special expertise that not all con-
tractors, engineers, and architects have.
Professional property inspectors are specifically trained to do inspections 
and only inspections; they make their living solely from inspection fees. They 
don’t do corrective work, which eliminates the temptation to find unneces-
sary corrective work during their inspections.
Selecting your inspector
How can you find a qualified home inspector? Ask friends and business asso-
ciates who’ve recently bought homes whom they used for their property 
inspections. Get a list of home inspectors from a real estate agent. Be careful, 
though, of inspectors who are popular with agents — that popularity may 
stem from not killing too many deals by going easy on their inspections. Also 
check the Yellow Pages of your local phone book under “Building Inspection 
Services” or “Home Inspection Services.” If several sources recommend the 
same inspector, you’ve probably found a good one.
 
Just because someone has a diploma issued by an organization with an 
impressive name doesn’t mean that individual is a qualified property inspec-
tor. Unfortunately, some “professional” associations’ only criterion for 
membership is the ability to pay an initiation fee and annual membership 
dues. No matter how fancy the diploma, don’t be fooled by what could be a 
meaningless piece of paper.
The American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) is a professional association 
of independent home inspectors. Just because an inspector is an ASHI 
member doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get a good inspection, but it certainly 
increases the likelihood that you’ll be working with a qualified professional. 
You can’t just plunk down a membership fee and join. All ASHI-certified 

276
Part IV: Making the Deal 
members have performed at least 250 property inspections and have passed 
two written proficiency exams as a prerequisite of membership. ASHI mem-
bers must also adhere to ASHI’s standards of practice, continuing education 
requirements, and code of ethics. To find members in your area, call ASHI at 
800-743-2744 or visit its Web site at www.ashi.org.
We recommend that you interview several property inspectors prior to hiring 
one. Here are questions to help you select the best inspector:
 
✓ Are you a full-time, professional property inspector? Only one answer 
is acceptable: yes.
 
✓ What can you tell me about your company? Discuss the company’s size 
and how long it has been in business.
 
✓ Do you carry errors and omissions insurance? Errors and omissions 
insurance covers the possibility that a property inspection could miss 
some problems. If an inspector makes an error that costs you big bucks, 
errors and omissions insurance can help make amends.
 
✓ How many inspections do you personally perform each year? 
Although the average number of inspections varies from area to area, 
active inspectors usually conduct between 150 and 400 inspections per 
year. Find out whether the inspector works primarily in the area in 
which the property you want to have inspected is located and is thus 
familiar with local codes, local regulations, and local problems (such as 
floods, mudslides, earthquakes, tornadoes, and the like). Also, ask 
whether the inspector routinely inspects foreclosed property if you’re 
considering buying a foreclosed home.
 
✓ Do you hold any special licenses or certifications? Property inspectors 
usually have a background in some related field, such as construction, 
engineering, architecture, electricity, plumbing, or insurance claim 
adjusting. This diversity adds extra insights to their inspections. 
Membership in ASHI or another trade association for property inspec-
tors indicates at least a minimal knowledge of home inspection 
procedures.
 
✓ What’s the scope of your prepurchase inspection? Make sure that the 
inspection covers all the property’s major structural and mechanical 
systems, inside and out, from foundation to roof. Anything less is 
unacceptable.
 
✓ How long will your inspection take? Time actually spent at the site is 
an important consideration. This inspection isn’t a race. It usually 
takes two or three hours to thoroughly inspect a condo or a home of 
average size.

277
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
 
✓ What type of report will I receive? Verbal reports, like verbal contracts, 
are worthless. A boilerplate, checklist-type report is only marginally 
better. You must have a detailed description of your specific property’s 
mechanical and structural condition. You need a narrative report, 
written in plain English, that clearly explains the implications of its 
findings.
 
 Get sample reports from each inspector that you interview. The best 
way to see whether a company writes good reports is to read one so 
that you can draw your own conclusion. Figure 13-1 features a super-
ficial inspection report; we include an example of a thorough inspection 
report in Appendix B so that you know what a good one looks like.
 
✓ Do you mind if I tag along during your inspection? Mind? On the 
contrary, good inspectors insist that you be present during the property 
inspection.
 
✓ Will your report include an estimate of the cost to do your recom-
mended corrective work? This is a trick question. If the inspector says 
yes, don’t use the inspector. Good professional property inspectors do 
only inspections. They don’t do corrective work. Neither do they solicit 
business for their friends. Good inspectors help you establish repair 
costs by referring you to three or four reputable contractors, roofers, 
electricians, and other repair people that you can contact for corrective-
work quotes. Because there’s usually more than one way to fix a 
defect, you have to decide how best to deal with a problem after you’ve 
consulted the appropriate repair people.
 
✓ How much does your inspection cost? Unfortunately, this is generally 
the first question that buyers ask when shopping for a property inspec-
tor. This is no time to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Watch out 
for unrealistically low, “this week only” promotional fees that new 
inspectors may offer. Don’t let green inspectors practice on you. Quality 
inspections cost more than quickie, one-size-fits-all, checklist inspec-
tions, because they’re worth a lot more. Ultimately, because fees 
charged by good inspectors are usually pretty much the same (because 
of competitive pressure), you’ll probably end up using the correct 
criteria to select your inspector: compatibility and competence.
 
✓ Would you mind if I call some of your recent customers for refer-
ences? Good property inspectors are happy to give you names and 
phone numbers of their satisfied customers. Bad inspectors may balk 
at providing references or direct you to people they know will say 
something positive about them. Be sure to check at least three refer-
ences per inspector in the town where the property is located. Ask 
the references whether, after close of escrow, they discovered any 
major defects that their inspector missed and whether they’d use their 
inspector again.

Optimizing your inspection
Here are guidelines for getting the biggest bang out of the bucks that you 
invest in a prepurchase property inspection:

279
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
 
✓ Always make your offer to purchase a house subject to your review 
and approval of the inspection reports. Doing so gives you the 
opportunity to either negotiate a credit or price reduction for corrective 
work that’s discovered during the inspections or, if you want, get out of 
the deal. We cover this subject extensively in Chapter 12. As we note in 
Chapter 8, lenders generally won’t let you inspect foreclosed property 
prior to an auction.
 
✓ See whether the sellers have any presale inspection reports that they 
ordered or any copies of inspection reports generated by previous 
prospective buyers. If so, give the reports to your inspector to call her 
attention to possible problem areas. Have your agent order a permit 
search on the property to find out whether electrical, plumbing, or other 
repairs or improvements have been made.
 
 Suppose that the sellers give you a presale inspection report that they 
ordered just before putting their house on the market. It says that their 
house is in perfect condition. You could save money by relying on their 
report instead of getting your own. Should you? No way. Never let the 
fox tell you how things are in the henhouse. Always pay for your own 
inspection by an inspector of your own choosing.
 
✓ Read your property inspector’s report carefully. If you don’t see some 
defects listed in the report that your inspector specifically mentioned 
during the inspection, call the inspector to find out why. By the same 
token, don’t be the least bit shy about calling your inspector to get a 
detailed explanation of anything you don’t completely understand in 
the report.
 
✓ To minimize the cost of corrective repairs, get bids on the job from 
several reputable, licensed contractors. Never try to save money by 
using unlicensed contractors to do the work without permits. Doing 
so is usually illegal, can create health and safety problems, and can 
adversely affect your home’s resale value. Many states require that 
house sellers disclose to prospective purchasers the fact that work on 
the house was done without permits. If your state doesn’t mandate this 
type of disclosure now, it probably will by the time that you’re ready to 
sell your house.
 
✓ Use your property inspector during the contractor bidding process. If 
the contractors have questions regarding items discussed in the inspec-
tion report, refer them to the report’s author for clarification. For an 
additional fee, some property inspectors will help you evaluate bids you 
receive to do the corrective work.

280
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
 Prepurchase property inspections are intended to give you a factual 
basis for negotiating the correction of big-ticket defects — not to nickel-
and-dime sellers over credits for stained carpets and worn curtains. If 
your new home is someone else’s used house, let your offering price 
reflect the home’s reduced value due to normal wear-and-tear cosmetic 
defects.
 
 If your agent or the seller offers to pay for a home warranty plan or home 
protection plan (that is, a service contract that covers some of your 
home’s major systems and appliances), it wouldn’t be gracious of you to 
turn down a freebie. Never accept such a plan in lieu of an inspection, 
however, and don’t recommend that you use your own money to buy 
this type of plan for yourself. After spending $250 or so for the plan, 
you pay an additional $25 to $50 deductible each time you need some-
one to come out and look at a problem. Furthermore, these plans 
significantly limit how much they pay to correct major problems. Hiring 
a professional property inspector to inspect the home diligently and 
uncover all existing problems so that you can negotiate their correction 
with the sellers is a better way to spend your money.
Don’t expect your inspections to eliminate all future maintenance problems. 
In time, the garbage disposal will break. All roofs leak eventually. When these 
things happen, it isn’t part of some hideous plot to defraud you.
 
Anything in your home that can break or leak will break or leak, sooner or 
later. Repairs come with homeownership. After closing on your home 
purchase, normal upkeep is your responsibility — not the sellers’. They’ll 
have repairs of their own to make to their new home.
Insuring Your Home
Nobody likes to spend money for insurance. But if something could cause 
you a financial catastrophe, you should insure against that risk. The point of 
insurance is that you spend a relatively small amount of money to protect 
against losing a great deal of money. For example, if your home burns to 
the ground and it’s not insured, you could be out tens (if not hundreds) of 
thousands of dollars.
You shouldn’t waste money insuring potentially small-dollar losses. Suppose 
that you mail a package that contains a gift worth $50. If the postal service 
loses it, you’ll be bummed, but the loss won’t be a financial catastrophe for 
you. You shouldn’t waste your money on such insurance.
Here are the types of insurance that you do need to have in place before you 
purchase your dream home.

 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
Homeowners insurance
When you buy a home, most lenders require that you purchase home-
owners insurance. Even if you’re one of those rare people who can buy a 
home with cash without borrowing money, you should carry homeowners 
coverage. Why?
Seeing and reading are infinitely 
better than just reading
You, your agent, and the seller’s agent should 
join the inspector during the property inspec-
tion. Reading even the finest of inspection 
reports is, at best, a mediocre substitute for 
being at the property and looking at the defects 
with your own eyes. This may be your best 
opportunity to question the inspector about the 
ramifications of a defect and discuss various 
ways to correct problems. By seeing and talk-
ing about the defects, you gain a better under-
standing of why some defects are no big deal to 
fix, whereas others cost megabucks to repair.
From a negotiating standpoint, the sellers are 
more likely to accept the inspection report’s 
findings if their agent is present when the 
inspection is performed. They’ll know that the 
defects are real — their agent actually saw the 
defects and can point them out to the sellers 
before they get a copy of the inspection report. 
They’ll know that a skilled professional 
inspected their house — not some stooge that 
you hired to defame their property so that you 
could swindle them out of their hard-earned 
money. They’ll know that even if they drive you 
away by hardballing you on the corrective work, 
they’ll still be stuck with the problem of selling a 
defective house.
Even if the house is in perfect condition, you 
should know where certain things are. If you 
attend the inspection, your inspector can show 
you where to find important stuff like the fur-
nace, water heater, and circuit breakers. The 
inspector should also show you where the 
emergency shutoff valves for the house’s gas, 
electric, and water systems are. By attending 
the inspection, you learn much more about the 
house’s care and maintenance than you’d ever 
pick up by reading the inspection report.
If it’s flat-out impossible to be at the inspection 
because you’re stuck in another city or must be 
at a command-performance business meeting, 
make sure to have someone you trust (your 
agent, a relative or friend, or someone equally 
trustworthy) at the inspection to act as your 
eyes and ears. Ask your surrogate to make an 
audiotape or videotape recording of the inspec-
tion, which you can use to supplement the 
inspection report. Watching a videotape isn’t as 
good as personally being there, but it sure beats 
just reading a report. You can also call the 
inspector if you have questions about the 
report.
Last but not least, pay attention. Don’t bring 
along a gaggle of kids, relatives, friends, busi-
ness associates, painters, carpet suppliers, 
plumbers, electricians, or contractors who’ll 
distract you from the job at hand: learning 
everything you can about the property that you 
want to buy. Focus on the inspection.

282
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ First, your home and the personal property (furniture, carpets, audio 
equipment, computers, china, and the like) in your home would cost 
a small fortune to replace out of your own pocket.
 
✓ Second, your home can lead to a lawsuit. If someone were injured 
or killed in your home, you could be sued for tens or hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, perhaps even a million dollars or more.
The following sections tell how to get the homeowners coverage that 
you need.
The cost of rebuilding
If your home is destroyed, which most frequently happens from fires, your 
insurance policy should pay for the cost of rebuilding your home. The 
portion of your policy that takes care of this loss is the dwelling coverage 
section. The amount of this coverage should be equal to the cost of rebuild-
ing the home that you own. The cost to rebuild should be based on the 
square footage of your home. Your policy’s dwelling coverage amount 
shouldn’t be based on what you paid for the home or the amount of your 
mortgage. If you’re buying a condominium or cooperative apartment, exam-
ine the coverage that your building’s homeowners association carries.
 
Get a policy that includes a guaranteed replacement cost provision. This 
provision ensures that the insurance company will rebuild the home, even if 
the cost of construction is more than the policy coverage. If the insurance 
company underestimates your dwelling coverage, the company has to eat 
the difference.
Ask the insurers that you’re speaking with how they define guaranteed 
replacement cost coverage — each insurer defines it differently. The most 
generous policies, for example, pay for the home’s full replacement cost, 
no matter how much the replacement ends up costing. Other insurers set 
limits — for example, they agree to pay up to 120 percent of your policy’s 
total dwelling coverage.
Lawsuit protection
Liability insurance protects you against lawsuits arising from bad things that 
happen to others while they’re on your property. Suppose that a litigious 
passerby happens to slip on a banana peel that was left on your driveway. Or 
perhaps your second-floor deck collapses during a beer fest, and someone 
breaks a leg or two.
 
Carry enough liability insurance to protect at least two times the value of your 
assets. Although the chances of being sued are remote, remember that if you 
are sued, the financial consequences can be staggering. In fact, if you have 
substantial assets (worth more than a couple hundred thousand dollars, for 
example) to protect, you might consider what’s called an umbrella, or excess 
liability policy. Bought in increments of $1 million, this coverage adds to the 
liability coverage on your home and car(s). Check for such policies with your 
home and auto insurers.

283
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
Personal property protection
On a typical homeowners policy, the amount of personal property coverage 
is usually set at about 50 to 75 percent of the amount of dwelling coverage. 
If you’re a condo or cooperative apartment owner, however, you generally 
need to choose a specific dollar amount for the personal property coverage 
that you want.
Some policies come with personal property replacement guarantees that pay 
you for the replacement cost of an item rather than for the actual value of a 
used item at the time that it’s damaged or stolen. If this feature isn’t part of 
the standard policy sold by your insurer, you may want to purchase it as a 
rider (add-on provision), if such a rider is available.
Other catastrophes to insure against
Depending on where the home you buy is 
located, it may be subjected to earthquakes, 
floods, hurricanes, mudslides, tornadoes, wild-
fires, or other bad stuff. Standard homeowners 
policies don’t protect against all these vagaries, 
so you must secure additional riders.
Thousands of communities around the country 
are at risk for floods. Hence, if you live in one of 
these areas, you need to purchase a flood 
insurance rider. Check with prospective home-
owners insurance providers. The federal gov-
ernment flood insurance program (800-638-6620; 
www.fema.gov/business/nfip) can 
provide background information on the types of 
policies available through private insurance 
companies.
Earthquakes are another risk to insure against. 
In addition to California, parts of the Midwest 
(and even parts of the East Coast) have active 
fault lines.
Ask people in the area that you’re considering 
moving to what the local risks are. The U.S. 
Geological Survey (check your local phone 
directory; www.usgs.gov) and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (800-358-
9616; www.fema.gov) offer maps showing, 
respectively, earthquake and flood risks. Be 
aware and be informed.
Because the cost of earthquake and flood cov-
erage is based on insurance companies’ 
assessments of the risks of both your area and 
your property type, you should not decide 
whether to buy these riders based on only your 
perception of how small a risk a major quake or 
flood is. The risk is already built into the price.
You may be able to pay for much of the 
cost of earthquake or flood insurance by 
raising the deductibles on the main parts 
of both your homeowners insurance and 
the other insurance policies that you carry. 
Remember — you can more easily afford the 
smaller claims than the big ones. If you think 
that flood or earthquake insurance is too costly, 
compare the coverage’s costs with the expense 
that you’ll incur to completely replace your 
home and personal property. Buy this insurance 
if you live in an area that has a chance of being 
affected by these catastrophes.

284
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
If you ever need to file a claim, having documentation of your personal prop-
erty helps. The simplest and fastest way to document your personal effects is 
to make a videotape of your belongings. Alternatively, you can maintain a file 
folder of receipts for major purchases and make a written inventory of your 
belongings. No matter how you document your belongings, be sure to place 
this documentation somewhere outside your home (and not in the vegetable 
garden). A list or video isn’t going to do you much good if it’s in your home 
and your house goes up in a puff of smoke during a fire or is irreparably 
damaged in a horrendous flood!
Where to get good coverage inexpensively
As with other types of insurance and other financial products, you must shop 
around. But we know that you have better things to do with your time than 
shop, so here’s a short list of companies that are known for offering high-
quality, low-cost policies:
 
✓ AMICA: Call the company at 800-242-6422 for information. Although 
AMICA customers generally give the company high ratings, AMICA’s 
prices are sometimes on the high side.
 
✓ Erie Insurance: This company does business primarily in states in the 
Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Check your local phone directory for agents 
who sell Erie Insurance policies, or call 800-458-0811 for a referral to a 
local agent.
 
✓ GEICO: Call the company for specifics at 800-841-3000.
 
✓ Liberty Mutual: Check your local phone directory for agents who sell 
Liberty Mutual’s policies.
 
✓ Nationwide Mutual: Check your local phone directory for agents who 
sell Nationwide Mutual’s insurance.
 
✓ State Farm: Check your local phone directory for agents who sell State 
Farm insurance.
 
✓ USAA: Insurance through USAA is available to military officers and their 
family members. Call the company for specifics and to see whether you 
qualify (800-531-8080).
You may have access to more specific information for your state. Many state 
insurance departments, which you can locate through the state government 
listings in your phone book, conduct surveys of insurers’ prices and tabulate 
any complaints received. We also include information about some helpful 
Web sites in Chapter 11.
 
As you shop around, ask about special discounts for such things as homes 
with a security system or smoke-detection system, discounts for people who 
have multiple policies with the same insurer, and senior discounts.

285
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
Title insurance
Fast forward to a time several months after you close escrow on the pur-
chase of your dream home. Suppose that we ask you to prove to us that you 
actually own the home.
“No problem,” you say. You go to the safe deposit box where you keep all 
your important documents and pull out the fancy deed that the recorder’s 
office mailed to you a couple weeks after you completed your purchase.
Sorry. That deed isn’t proof positive.
For example, a man and his “wife” signed a deed that transferred their 
house’s title to another couple. A few weeks later, the buyers were shocked 
to find that their deed wasn’t valid because the real wife’s signature had been 
forged. In fact, the real wife didn’t even know that her husband had sold the 
property.
Title risks
In theory, you can go down to the local county recorder’s office and find out 
who owns any piece of property in the county simply by checking the public 
record. In fact, all sorts of irregularities in the history of the various people 
who’ve owned the property since it was originally constructed can affect a 
property’s title — irregularities that are difficult or impossible to find, no 
matter how diligently you comb the public records.
 
Here are some causes of these hidden risks to titles:
 
✓ Secret spouses: A seller may claim to be single when, in fact, he or 
she is secretly married in another state. Or perhaps the seller was 
divorced in a community property state where, through marriage, one 
spouse obtains a legal interest in property held individually by the 
other spouse. Whatever the reason, sometimes a present or former 
spouse no one knew about will show up out of the blue and file a claim 
against the property. This explains why title company representatives 
are so infernally curious about your marital status. They must know 
whether you’re single, married, divorced, or widowed to keep ownership 
records accurate.
 
✓ Undisclosed heirs: When property owners die without wills, probate 
courts must decide who their rightful heirs are. Court decisions may 
not be binding on heirs who aren’t notified of the proceeding. Even 
when there’s a will, probate courts must sometimes settle questions 
concerning the will’s interpretation. Undiscovered heirs sometimes 
magically appear and claim that they now own the property in question.

286
Part IV: Making the Deal 
 
✓ Questionable competency: Minors and people adjudged to be mentally 
incompetent can’t enter into binding contracts unless their court-
appointed guardians or conservators handle the transaction. If, for 
example, the seller was a minor or was mentally incompetent when a 
deed was signed, the transaction may be voidable or invalid.
 
✓ Goofs: This is a highly technical, catchall category for human errors. 
It covers everything from clerks who overlook liens recorded against 
property (liens for unpaid federal and state income taxes or local 
property taxes, for example) and other important documents while 
doing title searches, to surveyors who incorrectly establish property 
boundaries. Honest mistakes create many title problems.
 
✓ Forgery and fraud: As was the case with the fake wife, sellers are some-
times fraudulently impersonated. By the same token, signatures can be 
forged on documents. Escrow officers demand identification (that is, a 
photo ID, such as a driver’s license issued within the past five years or a 
current passport) to establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are 
who you claim to be.
 
✓ Name confusion: A lot of title problems result from people having 
names similar (or identical) to the buyer’s name or seller’s name. Even 
though you prove that you are who you claim you are, you also have to 
prove who you aren’t. If you have a fairly common last name, you’ll prob-
ably have to fill out a Statement of Information to help the title company 
distinguish you from other people with names like yours. If you have an 
ordinary name like Brown, Chen, Garcia, Gonzalez, Johnson, Jones, Lee, 
Miller, Nguyen, Williams, or the ever-popular Smith, expect to be asked 
to complete a Statement of Information.
 
 What type of information is requested in a Statement of Information? 
You (and your spouse if you’re married) will have to provide your full 
name, Social Security number, date and year of birth, birthplace, date 
and place of marriage (if applicable), residence and employment infor-
mation, previous marriages, and the like. This information is used to 
differentiate good old honest you from the legions of ne’er-do-wells out 
there with names similar to yours.
What title insurance does
Many people who buy homes spend hundreds of dollars for title insurance 
without really understanding what they’re getting for their money. Title 
insurance assures homeowners and mortgage lenders that a property has 
a marketable (valid) title. If someone makes a claim that threatens your 
ownership of the home, the title insurance company protects you and the 
lender against loss or damage, according to the terms and provisions of your 
respective title insurance policies.
Most of your title insurance premium pays for research to determine who 
legally owns the property that you want to buy and to find out whether 
any unpaid tax liens or judgments are recorded against it. Because title 

287
 Chapter 13: Inspecting and Protecting Your Home
companies do a good job of eliminating title risks before folks buy property, 
only about 10 percent of the premium goes toward indemnifying homeown-
ers against title claims after the close of escrow.
The title insurance premium that you pay at close of escrow is the one and 
only title insurance premium that you’ll have to pay, unless you refinance your 
mortgage.
Title insurance deals with your risk of loss from past problems (such as 
unpaid property tax liens or forgery in the chain of title) that may exist at the 
time that your policy is issued. Because your policy covers the past, which is 
a fixed event, you pay only one title insurance premium as long as you keep 
your original mortgage.
 
If you refinance your mortgage, you have to get a new title insurance policy to 
protect the lender from title risks (such as income tax liens or property tax 
liens) that may have been recorded against your property between the time 
your previous policy was issued and the date of the refinance. If you refinance 
your loan, ask the title company whether you qualify for a refinance rate on 
the new title insurance policy. Most title companies will give you a big pre-
mium reduction — as much as 30 percent off their normal rates — if your 
previous policy was issued within five years of the new policy’s issuance date.
Two kinds of title insurance
As a homeowner, you have a choice of two different kinds of owners title 
insurance. Depending on the extent of the coverage that you desire, you 
can either get a standard coverage policy or an extended coverage policy.
 
✓ A standard title insurance policy is less expensive than an extended 
policy because its coverage is more limited. Standard policies are 
limited to certain off-record risks (such as fraud in the chain of title, 
defective recordings, and competency), plus recorded (at the local 
county recorder’s office) tax assessments, judgments, and other 
property defects that a search of public records can uncover.
 
✓ Extended title insurance policies cover everything that standard policies 
do, plus they provide expanded coverage for off-record risks that could 
be discovered through a property inspection or by making inquiries of 
people in actual possession of the property, as well as defects such as 
unrecorded (never recorded at the county recorder’s office) leases or 
contracts of sale. Only an extended title insurance policy would protect 
the homeowners in the faulty-land-survey and kitchen-fire examples in 
the nearby sidebar, “Actual examples of title insurance problems.”
Title insurance costs vary greatly, depending on the geographic area in 
which your home is located, the home’s purchase price, and the type of 
coverage that you get. In addition to the owners policy that we recommend 
you purchase to protect your investment, you need to buy a policy to protect 
the mortgage lender against loss on the loan amount.

288
Part IV: Making the Deal 
In some Eastern states, title companies are barred from doing title searches. 
If that prohibition exists in your area, you have to use a lawyer to handle 
your title search and escrow. In either case, shop around to see who offers 
the best combination of competitive premiums and good coverage.
 
As we note in Chapter 8, foreclosure auctions are extremely risky for many 
reasons. Among other things, lenders won’t guarantee that you’ll get 
undisputed title to the property you purchase at an auction. Nor can you get 
title insurance to protect against undisclosed or undiscovered flaws in the 
chain of title or liens against auctioned property.
 
Local custom and practice determine who usually pays for title insurance. In 
some parts of the country, custom dictates that the buyer pays for it. In other 
areas, however, the seller pays the title insurance premium, or buyers and 
sellers split the cost fifty-fifty. As we point out in Chapter 12, the payment for 
title insurance is a negotiable item. Regardless of local custom, if you’re in a 
strong buyer’s market, the sellers may offer (or you could ask them) to pay 
your title insurance costs in order to put the deal together. If, conversely, 
you’re bidding against several other buyers for a particularly desirable house, 
you’d be smart to sweeten your offer by paying for title insurance, even 
though local custom prescribes that sellers pay for it.
Actual examples of title insurance problems
Folks usually don’t pay much attention to title 
insurance when they’re buying a home. Most 
people get title insurance only because the 
lender won’t give them a mortgage if they don’t 
have it. But home buyers are mighty glad to 
have such a policy when a title problem rears 
its ugly head.
For example, a woman spent close to $10,000 to 
remodel an existing carport and shed and to 
build a fence along her property line after 
obtaining her neighbor’s permission. So far, so 
good. Everything was fine for the woman until 
her neighbor sold his place several years later. 
The new owners had their property surveyed 
and discovered that her carport, shed, and 
fence extended about 2 feet onto their land. 
Instead of tearing everything down, which was 
the woman’s first impulse after getting the bad 
news, she decided to file a claim on her title 
insurance policy.
The title company discovered that she was the 
victim of a faulty land survey. It solved the 
problem by buying from her new neighbors an 
easement in perpetuity to use the land that she 
had improved so that she could leave every-
thing (carport, shed, and fence) exactly where 
it was.
Another example involves a couple whose 
kitchen was destroyed by fire. The county build-
ing department said that to rebuild it, the couple 
would have to remove a preexisting carport that 
extended into a 5-foot lot setback. The previous 
owners had gotten all the necessary permits 
that were required to build the carport, but the 
local zoning laws had changed since the time 
the carport was built in 1970.
The clever couple knew what to do. They called 
their friendly title company representative. 
After investigating their problem, the title com-
pany paid a contractor $5,000 to remove the 
carport. The title company also paid the couple 
$19,000 to compensate them for the reduced 
value of their property because it no longer had 
covered parking.

An Escrow Is a Good Thing
As soon as possible after you and the seller have a ratified offer (that is, a 
signed contract), all funds, documents, and instructions pertaining to your 
transaction should be delivered to a neutral third party: the escrow holder des-
ignated in your purchase agreement. The act of giving these funds, documents, 
and instructions to the escrow holder constitutes the escrow. Depending on 
the local custom in your area, a lawyer, an escrow firm, or a title company may 
handle the escrow. Buyers and sellers generally select an escrow holder based 
on recommendations from their agents. However, as with other companies 
you choose to do business with in your home-buying transaction, know that 
escrow fees and service quality vary.

290
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
Real estate deals are often characterized by mutual distrust. You and the seller 
need someone whom both of you can trust to hold the stakes while you two 
meet to work through all the resolved and unresolved details in your contract. 
The escrow holder (also known as the escrow officer) is your referee — a neu-
tral third party who shouldn’t show any favoritism to either you or the seller.
Know thy escrow officer
Your escrow officer is responsible for preparing and reviewing papers related 
to the transfer of title — a legal document that stipulates ownership of 
the property. This includes getting the papers properly signed, delivered, 
and made a matter of public record; complying with your lender’s funding 
instructions; ordering a title search (explained in Chapter 13); and account-
ing to you and the seller for your respective money. The escrow officer han-
dles the nitty-gritty paperwork and money details.
When the escrow is opened, your contract will probably be filled with loop-
holes known as contingencies or conditions of sale. For example, your contract 
should be written so that you can get out of the deal if you don’t approve the 
property inspection reports, or if the seller can’t give you clear title to the 
property, or if you can’t get a loan. The escrow officer’s job is to receive and 
follow your instructions. Don’t instruct the escrow officer to give your money 
to the seller until you’re fully satisfied that the seller has performed under the 
contract. Chapter 12 goes into great detail about contingencies.
Ideally, your escrow will go smoothly from start to close. If, however, the escrow 
officer ever gets conflicting instructions from you and the seller or lender, the 
escrow will stop dead in its tracks until the argument is resolved. What kind of 
conflicting instructions? Disputes about whether the purchase price includes 
an item of personal property (that is, a refrigerator, a fireplace screen, a light 
fixture, and the like) are always popular. So are disagreements about whether 
corrective work should be done prior to or after close of escrow.
 
Our friend Kip Oxman, a most excellent real estate attorney and broker, has 
a great saying that works wonders in dispute-resolution situations: “When all 
else fails, RTC.” You can find the answers to most controversies if you Read 
The Contract. The real estate purchase agreement included in Appendix A is an 
example of an extremely explicit contract that’s intended to eliminate ambiguity.
Good escrow officers are worth their weight in gold in times of crisis when 
the shouting, tears, and threats of lawsuit begin. At moments like this, often 
only the escrow officer’s incredible patience and crisis-mediation skills keep 
deals glued together.

291
 Chapter 14: It Ain’t Over till the Weight-Challenged Escrow Of ficer Sings
 
Give yourself an unfair advantage by humanizing your escrow. Either call or 
visit your escrow officer at her office to introduce yourself. Ask whether she 
needs any additional information to make the escrow go faster and smoother. 
Some questions your escrow officer may ask include the following:
 
✓ What’s your middle name?
 
✓ Where can you be reached during the day?
 
✓ What’s your insurance agent’s name and phone number?
 
✓ What’s your Social Security number (so your deposit can be placed in an 
interest-bearing account)?
A little consideration and respect now will do wonders for you later if the 
escrow hits a rough patch.
Cover all the bases
To avoid truly horrible surprises, pay particular attention to the following 
three areas.
Closing costs
If you have a nice, orderly, sequential mind, you’ve undoubtedly read the 
preceding 13 chapters and know that we have a detailed itemization of clos-
ing costs in Chapter 3. If you’re the kind of person who loves to skip around 
and sample random chapters that strike your fancy, we suggest that you read 
that section now, or the following tips won’t make as much sense.
As soon as possible, get a rough idea of how much money you have to come 
up with at the close of escrow. Immediately after opening escrow, ask the 
escrow officer to prepare a statement of your estimated closing costs. Even 
though it may take several weeks to get actual costs for inspection fees, 
repair-work credits, homeowners insurance premiums, and the like, at least 
you’ll have a preliminary number that you can fine-tune as additional infor-
mation becomes available. Having the knowledge available in this preliminary 
statement beats getting hammered by unexpected closing costs a couple of 
days before the close of escrow.
 
Estimate the closing expenses on the high side. Overestimating expenses and 
finding, when actual costs come in, that you don’t need as much money to 
close as you first expected is ideal. The sooner you put a box around your 
closing costs, the better. Don’t react to the situation — control it.

292
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
 
If, like most folks, you must put additional money in escrow just prior to the 
close of the transaction, use a cashier’s check or a money order, or have your 
funds wired directly to the escrow to prevent delays. Be sure you stay on top 
of your bank to ensure that the wire is expedited, because banks sometimes 
drop the ball. Personal checks take time to clear, and credit cards don’t cut 
it in escrows. If you have questions regarding what constitutes good funds, 
ask your escrow officer well in advance of the close of escrow. If your money 
is out of town, for example, in a high-yielding money-market fund (such as is 
recommended in Chapter 3), check with your investment company about how 
you can wire money from your account to the escrow company.
Preliminary title report
Shortly after escrow is opened, you should receive an extremely important 
document: the preliminary title report (or prelim) from your title company. 
This report shows who currently owns the property that you want to buy, as 
well as any money claims (such as mortgage liens, income-tax judgments, and 
property-tax assessments) that affect the property. Last but not least, the 
preliminary title report shows third-party restrictions and interests — such 
as condominium covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) — and 
utility-company or private easements that limit your use of the property.
 
Your contract should be contingent upon your review and approval of the pre-
liminary title report. Look it over carefully. Ask your agent, escrow officer, title-
company representative, or lawyer to explain anything in the report that you 
don’t understand. Don’t be shy — there’s no such thing as a dumb question.
As per the purchase contract, you should have the right to reasonably disap-
prove of certain claims or restrictions that you don’t want on the property 
and to ask the owner to clear them prior to the close of escrow. For example, 
asking the seller to pay off all debts secured by liens and judgments against 
the property is reasonable. Asking the seller of a condo to remove the CC&Rs 
would be unreasonable because, as noted in Chapter 8, the CC&Rs are an 
integral part of the property.
 
A preliminary title report is not title insurance. You can find more on the 
distinction between title insurance and a preliminary title report in the title-
insurance section of Chapter 13.
Final closing statement
You may believe that the most important piece of paper you get when escrow 
closes is the deed to your new home. From an accounting standpoint, however, 
the most important piece of paper is the final closing statement that you get 
from the escrow officer on the day that your escrow actually closes.

293
 Chapter 14: It Ain’t Over till the Weight-Challenged Escrow Of ficer Sings
If you think of the escrow as a checking account, the final closing statement 
is like your checkbook. The final closing statement records all the money 
related to your home purchase that went through the escrow as either a 
credit or a debit:
 
✓ Credits: Any money that you put into escrow (such as your initial 
deposit and down payment) appears as a credit to your account. You 
may also receive credits from the seller for such things as corrective-
work repairs and property taxes. And, of course, your loan is a credit.
 
✓ Debits: Funds paid out of escrow on your behalf are shown as debits. Your 
debits include modest and not-so-modest expenses, such as what you 
graciously paid the seller for your dream home, loan fees, homeowners 
insurance premiums, and property inspection fees.
 
You meet with your escrow officer several days before close of escrow to sign 
the loan documents and other papers related to your home purchase. At that 
time, you receive an estimated closing statement detailing what your closing 
costs are if the escrow closes as scheduled. Check the estimated closing state-
ment extremely carefully, line by line and from top to bottom, to be absolutely 
certain that it accurately reflects your credits and debits.
Escrow officers are human — they sometimes make mistakes. So do other 
participants in the transaction who may have given the escrow officer incor-
rect information. And guess what — when mistakes turn up, whose favor do 
you think they’re in? Probably not yours! It’s your money on the table. Pay 
attention to detail. Review the closing statement, and question whatever isn’t 
clear or correct. You need not determine at the time you sign the loan docu-
ments precisely what’s wrong with the closing statement. Take it home with 
you, and continue inspecting it and asking the various parties to the transac-
tion to clarify anything you don’t understand about it.
 
The final closing statement is extremely important. Keep a copy for your files — 
it will come in handy when the time comes to complete your annual income 
tax return. As detailed in Chapter 3, some expenses (such as loan origination 
fees and property tax payments) are tax-deductible. Furthermore, the clos-
ing statement establishes your initial tax (cost) basis in the property. When 
you’re ready to sell your property, you may owe capital gains tax on any 
profit you make by selling the property for more than your cost basis (see 
Chapter 17 for more details).
’Tis the season: December escrows
As a rule, December is a slow month for home sales. A week or two before 
Thanksgiving, most buyers switch their attention from houses to holidays 
and family gatherings, and those buyers typically don’t get back onto the 
home-buying track until late January.

294
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
 
Here are two reasons that you may decide to buck the trend:
 
✓ Bargain hunting: When the other buyers drop out of the market, you’re 
the only game in town for sellers who must move soon, or for stubborn 
sellers who foolishly waited too long to get realistic about their asking 
price. If they must sell, sellers instruct their agents to put the word out 
that they’re willing to deal. The magic phrase is, “Bring us an offer.” If 
you’re a low-baller looking for a deal, now’s the time to make your move.
 
✓ Tax deductions: What you get doesn’t matter — what does matter is 
what you get to keep. Buying a home in December gives you tax deduc-
tions that you can use to reduce your federal and state income taxes 
in that calendar year. As we discuss in Chapter 3, owning a home gives 
you physical shelter and tax shelter. On your income taxes, you can, for 
example, write off your loan origination fee (points), mortgage interest, 
and property taxes that you pay prior to December 31.
Escrows are perverse creatures under even the best of circumstances. 
They’re proof positive of Murphy’s Law, which states that whatever can go 
wrong will — and always at the worst possible time. Experienced escrow offi-
cers know that nasty surprises can rear their ugly heads whenever you least 
expect them.
The list of potential surprises is unpleasantly long: missed deadlines, title 
glitches, problems paying off existing loans, changes in your loan’s terms, 
insufficient funds to close escrow, funds not wired as promised, and so on.
December escrows are particularly perverse. Partying zaps your strength and 
reduces your effectiveness. People forget to sign papers before leaving on 
vacation. December 31 is an immutable deadline if you want to close this year 
for tax purposes. If you end up with a late December escrow, here are some 
things you (and your real estate agent) should do to make sure that you meet 
your deadline:
 
✓ Stay in touch with your lender. Lenders need copious documentation 
to substantiate loan applications. Be sure that your lender has all the 
required documents as soon as possible. Lenders say that lack of follow-
up on loan-document verification is the number one cause of escrow 
delays. In Chapter 7, we provide an extensive checklist of items — such 
as W-2s, tax returns, bank statements, and so on — that your lender may 
need you to provide to verify the information on your loan application.
 
✓ Don’t leave any blank spaces on your loan application. Draw a line 
through any section that doesn’t apply to you. If you leave a section 
blank, the lender may assume that you forgot to complete it. And make 
a photocopy of everything that you submit in case the originals get lost 
or you need to refer to the documents when the lender questions some-
thing you wrote.

295
 Chapter 14: It Ain’t Over till the Weight-Challenged Escrow Of ficer Sings
 
✓ Stay in touch with your escrow officer. Don’t let your file get buried in 
a pile of pending escrows stuck on the corner of your escrow officer’s 
desk. You or your agent should check with the escrow officer periodi-
cally to make sure that things are going smoothly.
 
✓ Be available to sign your loan documents. You may have only 24 to 48 
hours after your loan package arrives at the escrow office to sign the doc-
uments and return them to the lender. A delay could cost you the loan.
 
✓ If you’re leaving town for the holidays, tell your agent, lender, and 
escrow officer well in advance of your departure. You can usually 
make special arrangements to close your escrow — no matter where 
you are — as long as people have advance warning and know how to 
reach you. The key to success is keeping everyone posted.
 
✓ Check the calendar. Many offices are open only till noon on Christmas 
Eve and New Year’s Eve. When Christmas Day and New Year’s Day fall 
on Saturday or Sunday, office hours can really get crazy. Some busi-
nesses and public offices close on the preceding Friday, others close on 
the following Monday, and still others close on both Friday and Monday 
to give their employees a four-day holiday. Be sure to check the holiday 
office schedule of your agent, lender, escrow officer, and so on. Don’t let 
a holiday office closing derail your deal.
 
✓ Allow time between when you’d like to close and when you must 
close. Give yourself maneuvering room to resolve last-minute problems 
that inevitably appear when you least expect them. Don’t schedule your 
closing on the last business day of the year — you’ll have no margin for 
error if you need to close by year’s end.
Follow through
Engagements are to weddings what escrows are to buying houses. Just as 
wedding bells don’t always ring for everyone who gets engaged, not all open 
escrows end in home purchases.
Many escrows could’ve been saved by applying a fundamental principle of 
winning tennis: Follow through. Tennis pros know that the game is more than 
simply making contact with the ball. Pros continue their swing “through the 
ball” after they hit it because they know that the last part of the stroke is 
as important as the initial contact with the ball. If they don’t follow through 
properly, the ball won’t end up where they want it to go.
And so it is with real estate deals. Buyers, sellers, and agents often say that a 
house has been sold when the purchase contract is signed. Not true! Nothing 
was sold. The buyer and seller merely ratified an offer. Big difference!

296
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
 
If you want to actually buy and move into the home — that is, close your 
escrow — everyone involved in your transaction must follow through on 
all the details. You won’t be the proud owner of your dream house until the 
weight-challenged escrow officer sings!
How You Take Title Is Vital
One of the most important decisions you make when buying a home is how 
you take title in the property. If you’re unmarried, your choices are simpler 
because you take title as a sole owner. When two or more people co-own a 
property, however, the number of ways to take title multiplies dramatically.
How title is held is critically important. Each form of co-ownership has its own 
rainbow of advantages, disadvantages, tax consequences, and legal repercus-
sions. You shouldn’t make this decision in haste at an escrow office while 
signing your closing papers. Unfortunately, that’s what usually happens.
What’s the best form of co-ownership for you? That depends on your 
circumstances. Here are some forms of co-ownership and the advantages 
of each type.
Joint tenancy
Suppose that you and your spouse buy a house together as joint tenants. 
When your spouse dies 20 years from now, ownership of the house automati-
cally transfers to you without going through probate. This feature of joint 
tenancy co-ownership is known as the right of survivorship.
Joint-tenancy benefits don’t stop there. You also get a stepped-up basis on 
your spouse’s half of the house. This stepped-up basis may save you big 
bucks on the capital-gains tax that you have to pay if you ever sell the house.
Here’s how a stepped-up basis works. Say that you and your spouse paid 
$180,000 for the house when you bought it. Immediately after your spouse’s 
death, the house is appraised at $300,000.
Your new cost-of-the-home basis for tax purposes is $240,000 ($90,000 for 
your half-share of the original purchase price, plus $150,000 for your spouse’s 
half of the house at date of death) because no capital-gains tax applies to 
your spouse’s $60,000 of appreciation in value.
 
Even though we use a married couple in our example, you need not be mar-
ried to use joint tenancy co-ownership. However, a minimum of two people 
must co-own.

297
 Chapter 14: It Ain’t Over till the Weight-Challenged Escrow Of ficer Sings
Community property
Only married couples can take title as community property. Compared with 
joint tenancy, an advantage of community property co-ownership is that both 
halves of your house get a stepped-up basis upon the death of your spouse. 
This gives you even bigger tax savings.
Using the same figures as the joint-tenancy example, as the surviving spouse, 
your cost basis is the full $300,000. Capital-gains tax is forgiven on every 
penny of appreciation in value between the date of purchase and your 
spouse’s death.
Another advantage of community property co-ownership is the ability to will 
your share of the house to whomever you wish. Because of the right of survi-
vorship, this choice isn’t possible when title is held as joint tenants.
 
Six states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, and Wisconsin — 
allow community property with rights of survivorship. This allows 
both the full step-up in basis of regular community property, plus the 
non-administration of estates afforded by joint tenancy ownership.
Tenants-in-common or partnerships
Holding title as tenants-in-common or in the form of a partnership doesn’t 
give you a stepped-up basis upon the death of a co-owner. This creates an 
obvious disadvantage from a tax standpoint.
Offsetting legal advantages exist, however, for unrelated persons who take 
title either as tenants-in-common or as a partnership. Under these forms of 
co-ownership, you generally have the right to will or sell your share of the 
property without permission of the co-owners. Furthermore, co-owners don’t 
have to have equal ownership interests in the property — a nice feature for 
people who just want a small piece of the action.
Getting help drafting an agreement
 
If you’re smart — and we know that you must be, or you wouldn’t be reading 
this book — you and your co-owners should have a formal written agreement, 
prepared by a real estate lawyer, to cover situations likely to arise while you 
jointly own the property. (Note: Such agreements are generally used and 
advisable when partners purchasing a property aren’t a married couple). 

298
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
Here’s a recap of key provisions to include in your written agreement (you can 
find more on these items in the partnership section of Chapter 8):
 
✓ Provisions to buy out a co-owner who has to sell when the other owners 
want to keep the property
 
✓ Provisions to prorate maintenance and repair costs among co-owners 
with unequal shares in the property
 
✓ Provisions to resolve disputes regarding such things as what color to 
paint the house
 
✓ Provisions for penalties if a co-owner can’t cover his or her share of loan 
payments or property taxes
The preceding information isn’t intended to be your definitive guide to the sub-
tleties of real property title vesting. This chapter merely points out the most 
important issues that you should consider. Don’t make a decision of this mag-
nitude in haste, especially if your situation is unusual or complicated. In addi-
tion to deciding how to hold title, you should consider estate-planning issues, 
such as wills and potential trusts (see Chapter 2 to find out more).
Getting Possessive
The day your escrow closes is legally confusing. You don’t own the home 
when the day begins at 12:01 a.m., but you’re the owner of record when the 
day ends at midnight. Sometime during the day, the escrow officer gives 
the seller your money, notifies you that the deed has been recorded, and 
officially announces that you’re now the proud owner of your dream home. 
Congratulations!
Moving day
When can you actually take possession of your home and move into it? 
That depends on the terms of your contract. Look at paragraph 3 of the 
sample purchase contract in Appendix A to see an example of a Closing and 
Occupancy clause that specifies date and time of possession and delivery of 
keys from seller to buyer. Here are your usual options:
 
✓ Move in the same day that escrow closes. This is fine if the sellers have 
already moved out. If, however, the sellers haven’t moved yet and don’t 
want to deliver possession until they’re absolutely, 100 percent certain 
that escrow has closed, you may have a logistical problem. For two moving 
vans to occupy exactly the same driveway at exactly the same time borders 
on the impossible. Moving into a house while someone else is moving out 
is something you’ll never attempt more than once. You can find easier 
ways to go crazy.

299
 Chapter 14: It Ain’t Over till the Weight-Challenged Escrow Of ficer Sings
 
✓ Move in the day after escrow closes. We recommend this alternative if 
the sellers won’t deliver possession until escrow closes. Let the sellers 
have the day that escrow closes as their moving day. After all, the sell-
ers are still the owners until title transfers. Moving day is stressful, even 
under the best of circumstances. Why create unnecessary stress for 
yourself by trying to move in as the sellers are leaving?
 
 After the sellers vacate but before your movers bring your belongings 
into the house, check your new home carefully for damage that may 
have been caused by the sellers’ movers. When movers are involved, 
accidents can happen. We cover this problem in the next section.
 
 Whether you move into your home the day that escrow closes or the 
following day, you start paying for utilities and homeowners insurance 
effective the day that escrow closes. Don’t forget to coordinate phone 
installation and resumption of utility services, if necessary, with the 
proper companies a couple of weeks prior to the scheduled close of 
escrow.
 
✓ Move in after a seller rent-back. Sellers may remain in their house for 
several weeks after escrow closes while waiting to get into their new 
home. In that case, the buyer signs a separate rent-back agreement with 
the sellers, which becomes part of the purchase contract. The rent-back 
agreement covers such things as who pays for utilities and maintenance, 
what happens if property damage occurs, how much rent the sellers pay 
you, and what the penalties are if the sellers don’t vacate the property 
on the date specified in the rent-back.
 
 It’s customary for the sellers to pay rent equal to what you’re paying for 
principal and interest on your mortgage, plus property taxes and insur-
ance, so that you don’t have out-of-pocket expenses on what you pay 
to own the house during the term of their rental. The amount equaling 
principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (known as PITI) is prorated on a 
per-day basis from close of escrow until the sellers vacate.
 
 Suppose that PITI is $50 per day, and the sellers expect to be out three 
weeks after escrow closes. You both instruct the escrow officer to hold 
four weeks’ PITI in escrow to give you a cushion if the sellers encounter 
a delay in moving into their new place. When the sellers actually move 
out, you and the sellers jointly instruct the escrow officer to pay you 
PITI for the actual rental period and to refund to the sellers the unused 
portion of funds held in escrow.
 
 If the home you’re buying is vacant, you may be tempted to ask for 
permission to start fixing the house up before close of escrow. After 
all, painting or waxing floors, for example, is much easier and faster 
when the house is empty. Don’t do it. If the deal falls through, you’ve 
spent your time and money fixing up someone else’s house. If the house 
catches fire, you don’t have insurance to cover your losses. The risk 
exceeds the reward. Instead, allow some time to do these tasks after 
escrow closes and before moving in.

300
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
Final verification of condition
Read the Final Verification of Condition clause in paragraph 15 of the California 
Association of Realtors’ purchase contract in Appendix A. If your state’s con-
tract doesn’t have this type of clause in it, instruct your agent or lawyer to 
write such a clause into your contract. Nearly all contracts also have some-
thing like paragraph 25 (Other Terms and Conditions) just for this type of 
supplement to the contract.
 
We urge you to inspect the property a few days (ideally, the day) before 
escrow closes to be sure that it’s still in the same general condition that it was 
when you signed the contract to buy it. What if the sellers knocked a big hole 
in the kitchen wall during a wild party? What if they forgot to water the lawn, 
and it turned into a rock garden? What if a sinkhole appeared smack-dab in 
the middle of the driveway? The “what ifs” are endless.
You’ll probably find that everything is fine. But if it isn’t, you can order the 
escrow officer to stop the escrow while you resolve the problem. Such an 
action always gets the seller’s and real estate agent’s attention. If you and the 
seller can’t work out a mutually satisfactory solution, you may have to kill the 
deal. Killing the deal is better than buying a problem.
Coping with Buyer’s Remorse
Many home sellers are convinced that they left the family jewels on the table 
when they sold their houses. The notion that they “gave their house away” 
is called seller’s remorse. Seller’s remorse is painful, but it generally departs 
within a month or two after the sale. Sellers are lucky to have such an uncom-
plicated dementia.
If you’re like most buyers, you’ll experience the flip side of this nasty psycho-
sis. Buyer’s remorse is the sinking feeling that you paid way, way, waaaay too 
much for your new home.
Unfortunately, buyer’s remorse is much more complex than seller’s remorse. 
Buyer’s remorse is compounded by many other anxieties — that you’re get-
ting the world’s worst mortgage, that the bottom will fall out of property 
values in the years after you buy a home, that you’ll lose your job, that your 
health will fail, and that your faithful dog will die.
 
We’re here to help you deal with fear of overpayment. Those other anxieties 
are absolutely normal reactions to the uncertainties most of us initially experi-
ence. They will go away. If it makes you feel any better, nearly all home buyers 
are traumatized by the same concerns while purchasing a home.

301
 Chapter 14: It Ain’t Over till the Weight-Challenged Escrow Of ficer Sings
In time, you’ll discover (as we and millions of others who’ve gone before you 
did) that you have a fine mortgage, property values are stable, your continued 
employment is secure, your health is great, and so is your dog’s. Don’t take our 
word for this. Do a little dialing for dollars to verify that you got a good loan, 
check the help-wanted ads for jobs like yours, discuss property values with 
neighbors, get a physical examination, and take your dog to the vet.
So what about the fear that you’re paying waaaay too much? If the real estate 
gods love you, you’ll get a light case of buyer’s remorse that you can treat by 
taking a couple of aspirin. Some buyers, however, are so ravaged by it that 
they try to break their contract.
You can’t deal with buyer’s remorse until you accept it for what it is: raw, 
naked fear. You’re afraid that you’re overpaying for the house. That fear tears 
some buyers apart. The symptoms of typical, fear-driven buyer’s remorse are 
easy to spot. After you’ve signed the contract to buy your dream home, you 
do one or more of the following:
 
✓ Read ads in the real estate section of your local newspaper even more 
intently than you did before you signed the contract. You’re searching 
for similar or nicer houses with lower asking prices. (You forget that most 
houses read a lot better in ads than they eyeball when you tour them.)
 
✓ Spend Saturday and Sunday touring open houses. Reading ads isn’t 
enough for you. You pound the pavement, looking for better buys than 
you got. Seeing, after all, is believing. (Speaking of seeing, you may see 
the remorseful sellers making the rounds of the same houses that you’re 
looking at, trying to find less-nice properties with bigger asking prices.)
 
✓ Discuss your purchase with friends, neighbors, business associates, 
and the guy standing behind you while you wait in line to buy movie 
tickets. You ask anyone and everyone whether they think that you’re 
paying too much, even though 99.9 percent of the people you talk to don’t 
have a clue about property values for homes similar to yours. (You accept 
as gospel any wild guess they make that confirms your suspicions.)
After going through these exercises during escrow and for a couple of months 
after the purchase (until you’re emotionally and physically exhausted), 
you’ll probably discover that your fears are groundless. Nothing’s wrong or 
unusual about your concerns. What’s wrong is letting these fears gnaw away 
at you secretly instead of openly confronting them.
 
Facts defeat fear. The faster you get the facts you need, the less you’ll suffer.
As Chapter 10 explains, a home can have more than one correct price. 
Pricing and negotiation are arts, not precise sciences. Don’t beat yourself up 
with asking prices. You’re okay as long as your home’s purchase price is in 
line with the sale prices of comparable houses.

302
Par t IV: Making the Deal 
If you follow the principles we cover in this book, you’ll be just fine! Unlike 
many home buyers, you know how to get your finances in order before you 
buy, and you know how to determine what you can really afford to spend 
on a home. You know how to find a great neighborhood, a great property, a 
great mortgage, a great agent, and a great property inspector. You can spot 
an overpriced turkey and a good value. You know about property inspections 
and negotiating for repair of property defects. You know how to avoid nasty 
people and property surprises.
 
Knowledge is power. After you’ve assimilated the advice in this book, you’ll be 
extremely powerful. You have nothing to fear. Go for it!

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part includes information on the ten financial 
musts after you buy a house, ten things to know when 
investing in real estate, and ten things to consider when 
selling your house.

Chapter 15
Ten Financial “To Do’s” 
After You Buy
In This Chapter
▶ Going on a financial diet
▶ Resisting solicitors
▶ Refinancing when the time is right
▶ Documenting your home improvements
A
lthough it may have seemed that the day would never come — here 
you are, a homeowner. A homeowner — can you believe it? Go ahead 
and pinch yourself!
Perhaps you’re already correcting your friends who ask how it feels to be a 
homeowner. Most new owners say, “Well, the bank owns more of the house 
than I do.” Actually, you own 100 percent of the property — you just owe the 
mortgage lender a bucketload of money! Trust us when we say that although 
it may seem like a lot of money now, it won’t seem that way decades from now. 
You’ll be glad then that you decided to buy rather than continue renting. What 
you owe today, you’ll ideally own free and clear in 30 years, if not sooner.
If you think that the hard part is over after you buy a home, you may be in for 
a surprise. Moving probably wasn’t a picnic, but moving is just the beginning 
of your quest to transform your new slag heap into a beauteous home.
 
As a new homeowner, you must sidestep the many solicitations that will be 
winging your way. Unfortunately, when you buy a home, you end up on a 
zillion or so mailing lists because your home purchase is a matter of public 
record. Some communities even publish home sales (complete with buyer and 
seller names and purchase price) in the local newspaper, for goodness’ sake!
This chapter can help you become a financially happy new homeowner and 
can help you avoid the pitfalls to which many new homeowners before you 
have fallen prey.

306
Par t V: The Part of Tens 
Stay on Top of Your Spending and Saving
After you buy and move into your home, if you’re like most new homeowners, 
your furniture and other personal possessions seem to take on an even shab-
bier tinge than before. And because you’re now living in the property, you 
soon discover aspects of it that you don’t like as much as you did when you 
were looking at it from the outside as a prospective buyer. This is another 
bitter bite of buyer’s remorse, a common affliction of new home buyers that 
we discuss in Chapter 14.
 
Most home buyers can find unlimited furniture, appliances, and remodeling 
projects that quickly exhaust the incomes of even the rich and famous. Because 
of these spending temptations, more than a few home buyers end up not 
saving any of their hard-earned incomes. Some new homeowners even end 
up building credit card (and other high interest) consumer debt because 
their spending outstrips their income.
Feeling a squeeze in the budget when you buy a home is perfectly normal. 
After all, your housing expenses are probably higher than they were when 
you were renting or living in a smaller, less expensive house. But that’s all 
the more reason that you need to take a lean-and-mean approach to the rest 
of your budget and spending (see Chapter 2). You can also make your home 
more energy-efficient by doing some simple things such as adding insulation 
and installing water flow restrictors in faucets and shower heads. Also, use 
your home inspection report (see Chapter 13) to identify other opportunities 
for improvement.
Don’t neglect saving toward important financial goals, such as retirement. 
And take your time transforming your new home into a veritable palace. 
Rejoice and take solace in the fact that you have a roof over your head, a 
warm and comfortable place to sleep, and adequate living space — things 
that many people around the world can only dream about.
Consider Electronic Mortgage Payments
Mortgage lenders want to be paid and to be paid on time. And you want to 
pay them on time. Late payments can cost you dearly — many mortgages have 
stipulations for penalties equal to about 5 percent of the mortgage payment 
amount if your payment is late. If your payment is one whole month late, a 5 
percent penalty works out to an annualized interest rate in excess of 60 per-
cent! Even being one day late can trigger this penalty. (And you thought that 
credit card debt was costly to carry at 18 percent!) Late charges also show 
up as derogatories on your credit report.

307
 Chapter 15: Ten F inancial “To Do’s” Af ter You Buy
 
Sign up for your mortgage lender’s automatic-payment service to have your 
mortgage payment zapped electronically from your checking account to the 
lender on the same day each month. If your mortgage lender doesn’t offer this 
service, establish it yourself through one of the many home-banking services, 
such as CheckFree (800-297-3180; www.checkfree.com), or through bill-
payment software such as Quicken or Microsoft Money.

Most people clean out their emergency reserve (and then some) to scrape 
together enough cash to close on their home purchase. Ideally, you should 
have ready and available an emergency cash reserve equal to at least three 
months’ worth of living expenses. If your employment is unstable and you 
lack family to lean on financially in a pinch, aim for six months’ worth of 
living expenses. Keep the emergency money in a high-yielding money market 
mutual fund (see Chapter 3 for details).
As with saving money to accomplish other important financial goals, rebuild-
ing your emergency reserve requires you to go on a financial diet and spend 
less than you earn. Easier said than done, especially with all the tempting 
things to spend money on for your home. Avoid the malls, mail order cata-
logs, and home improvement stores until you’re back on an even keel!
Ignore Solicitations for 
Mortgage Insurance
Soon after you move into your home — often within a matter of just weeks or 
months — your mailbox will flood with solicitations offering you mortgage 
life insurance and mortgage disability insurance. Most of the solicitations 
come from your mortgage lender, but other solicitations may come from 
insurance firms that picked up on the publicly available information revealing 
that you recently bought your home.
 
The fundamental problem with these insurance policies is that given the 
amount of insurance protection offered, they’re usually grossly overpriced 
and don’t provide the right amount of benefits. The size of your mortgage 
shouldn’t necessarily determine the amount of life and disability insurance 
protection that you carry. If you need life insurance protection because you 
have dependents who rely on your income, buy low-cost, high-quality term 
insurance. Likewise, if you’re dependent on your income, make sure that you 
have proper long-term-disability insurance coverage. See Chapter 2 to find out 
more about satisfying your insurance needs.

Ignore Solicitations for Faster Payoff
Another type of solicitation that you may receive extols the virtues — thou-
sands of dollars in interest savings — that you can reap if you pay your mort-
gage off faster. For a monthly fee, these services offer to turn your annual 
12-monthly-payment mortgage into 26 biweekly payments, each of which is 
half of your current monthly payment. Thus, you’ll be making 13 months’ 
worth of mortgage payments every year instead of 12. Doing so will usually 
shave about 8 years off the repayment schedule of a 30-year mortgage.
These services have two problems.
 
✓ First, you’re paying the service money for paying off your mortgage 
faster — something you can do without the service and its fees.
 
✓ Second, paying off your mortgage faster than necessary may not be in 
your best interest.
 
The question to ask yourself is what you would do with the extra money each 
month if you didn’t pay off the mortgage faster. If you’d spend it on something 
frivolous that would provide only fleeting, superficial enjoyment, paying off 
your mortgage faster is probably a better use of the money. Likewise, if you’re 
an older (or otherwise risk-averse) investor, you’re unlikely to earn a high 
enough rate of return by investing your money to make it worth your while 
not to pay off your mortgage faster.
On the other hand, if you can instead put more money away into a tax-
deductible retirement account, paying off your mortgage faster may actually 
cost you money rather than save you money. Neither is it wise to pay down 
your loan if doing so leaves you cash poor. Suppose that you lose your job 
and take several months to find a new one. Or suppose that your home needs 
a new roof, and you don’t have the cash to pay for it. You should have at 
least three to six months’ worth of living expenses in some readily available 
place such as a money market fund. If you don’t, you may have to use high-
interest-rate (and not tax-deductible) credit cards to pay for unexpected 
expenses.
Consider Protesting Your Tax Assessment
In most communities, real estate property taxes are based upon an estimate 
of your home’s value. If home prices have dropped since you bought your 
home, you may be able to appeal your assessment and enjoy a reduction in 
the property taxes that you’re required to pay.

309
 Chapter 15: Ten F inancial “To Do’s” Af ter You Buy
 
Contact your local assessor’s office to inquire into the procedure for appeal-
ing your property taxes. Generally, the process involves providing comparable 
sales data in writing to the assessor to prove the reduced value of your home. 
If you need help with this exercise, contact the real estate agent who sold you 
the home. Just be aware that your agent may want to make you feel as though 
your home hasn’t decreased as much in value in order to make you (and per-
haps himself) feel better. Explain that you’re trying to save money on your prop-
erty taxes and need comps that sold for less than you paid for your house. See 
Chapter 10 if you need a quick refresher on establishing property values.
Refinance if Interest Rates Fall
In Chapters 6 and 7, we explain how to select a magnificent mortgage and 
provide many tips for getting the best mortgage deal you can. But after 
you’re into the routine of making your mortgage payments, if you’re like most 
people, staying on top of strategies to keep your mortgage costs to an abso-
lute minimum is probably as high on your priority list as flossing your teeth 
three times a day.
Keep an eye on interest rates. See the mortgage shopping resources we rec-
ommend in Chapter 6, as well as some Web sites we recommend in Chapter 11 
to efficiently assist you with that task. As you may already know, interest 
rates — like the weather — change. If interest rates decrease from where 
they were when you took out your mortgage, you may be able to refinance 
your mortgage and save yourself some money. Refinancing (as described in 
Chapter 6) simply means that you take out another new (lower-cost) 
mortgage to replace your old (higher-cost) one.
 
If rates have dropped at least one full percentage point since you originally 
took out your loan, start to contemplate and assess refinancing. The key item 
to calculate is how many months it will take you to recoup the costs of refi-
nancing (loan fees, title insurance, and the like). Suppose that your favorite 
mortgage lender tells you that you can whack $150 off your monthly payment 
by refinancing. Sounds good, huh? Well, not so quick there, Poindexter. First, 
you won’t save yourself $150 per month just because your payment drops by 
that amount — don’t forget that you’ll lose some tax write-offs if you have less 
mortgage interest to deduct.
To figure how much you’ll really reduce your mortgage cost on an after-tax 
basis, take your tax rate (as delineated in Chapter 3) and decrease the monthly 
payment savings you expect from the refinance by that amount. If you’re a 
moderate-income earner, odds are that you’re in the 28 percent tax bracket. So 
if your mortgage payment would drop by $150, and if you were to reduce that 
$150 by 28 percent (to account for the lost tax savings), your savings (on an 
after-tax basis) would actually be $108 per month.

310
Par t V: The Part of Tens 
Now, $108 per month is nothing to sneeze at, but you still must consider how 
much refinancing the loan will cost you. If the refinancing costs total, for 
example, $6,000, it will take you about 56 months ($6,000 divided by $108) 
to recover those costs. If you plan on moving within five years, refinancing 
won’t save you money — it will actually cost you money. On the other hand, 
if it costs you just $3,000 to refinance, you can recover those costs within 
three years. If you expect to stay in your home for at least that long, refinanc-
ing is probably a good move.
Keep Receipts for All Improvements
Sooner or later, you’ll spend money on your home. You should track and doc-
ument some of what you spend money on for tax purposes to minimize the 
capital gain that you may owe tax on in the future. Capital gain simply means 
the difference between what you receive for the house when you sell it less 
what it cost you to buy the house — with one important modification. The 
IRS allows you to add the cost of improvements to the original cost of your 
home to calculate what’s known as your adjusted-cost basis.
Capital gain = Net sale price – (Purchase price + Capital improvements)
For example, if you buy your home for $225,000, and over the years, it 
appreciates so that (after paying the costs of selling) your net selling price 
is $350,000, your capital gain is $125,000. Remember, though, that the IRS 
allows you to add the value of the capital improvements you make to your 
home to your purchase price.
Capital improvement is money you spend on your home that permanently 
increases its value and useful life — putting a new roof on your house, for 
example, rather than just patching the existing roof. So if you made $10,000 
worth of improvements on the home you bought for $225,000, your capital 
gain would be reduced to $115,000. Money spent on maintenance, such as 
fixing a leaky pipe or replacing broken windows, is not added to your cost 
basis (see Chapter 3 for more details).
 
Before you sell your home, be sure to understand the tax consequences of 
such a transaction. As we discuss in Chapter 17, many homeowners are eli-
gible to shelter a large chunk of their home’s capital gain from taxation when 
the time comes for them to sell.

311
 Chapter 15: Ten F inancial “To Do’s” Af ter You Buy
Ignore Solicitations to Homestead
Another pitch that you, as a new homeowner, may get in the mail is one offer-
ing to homestead your home if you pay the friendly firm anywhere from $50 
to $100. Homesteading means protecting some of your home’s equity from 
lawsuits. A firm may offer to file the appropriate (and quite simple) legal 
document to homestead.
If you live in a state where you need to take action to secure your homestead 
exemption, by all means do so. Just call the recorder’s office and ask how to 
do it. The process is simple (and, in some states, unnecessary) and not worth 
paying a firm to do for you.
Take Time to Smell the Roses
Okay, so it’s a cliché. But too often, people work, work, and work to afford 
a home and don’t take the time to enjoy life, family, and friends (or even 
their home). If you buy a home that’s within your financial means and you’re 
resourceful and thrifty with your spending in the years that you live in it, 
your home shouldn’t dictate your finances and your need to work. You 
should own the home. It shouldn’t own you.
 
No one (that we’re aware of) has ever said on her deathbed that she wished 
she had spent more time toiling away at work (and, therefore, less time with 
family, with friends, and for herself) so that she could spend more money on 
her home.

oth owning a home and paying down the mortgage on your home over 
the years should create equity — the difference between what your home 
is worth and what you owe on it. Even if the unlikely happens and your home 
doesn’t appreciate in value, you’ll build equity as you pay down your mortgage. 
More than likely, however, your home will also appreciate in value over the 
years that you own it.
Your home, then, is an investment. You can use the equity in your home in 
future years for a variety of important purposes, including (but not limited 
to) helping finance your retirement, pay for educational costs, and fund frivo-
lous and fun things such as traveling. In addition to owning your home, you 
can invest in real estate in other ways. In this chapter, we include our top ten 
tips and things you should know if you’re going to invest in real estate.
 
If you want to invest in real estate or stocks, bonds, mutual funds, small busi-
nesses, and the like, first invest your time in finding out what makes such 
investments tick and in learning how you can make informed decisions that fit 
with your personal financial situation and goals. Pick up a copy of the latest 
editions of Eric’s Investing For Dummies, Real Estate Investing For Dummies, 
and Mutual Funds For Dummies to find out more about investing.
Real Estate Is a Solid 
Long-Term Investment
During the 1990s, many people got swept up in the euphoria of a booming 
U.S. stock market. Year after year, the market cranked out easy double-digit 

314
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
returns for investors. We sometimes hear stories of people who made small 
fortunes because they happened to buy into the right stock at the right time. 
Meanwhile, in many parts of the country, real estate prices rose little by 
comparison. So it seemed to some people, including media pundits, that real 
estate was yesterday’s good investment.
 
Home values in all locations have always gone through up-and-down cycles. 
However, the long-term trend is up, and the rises usually are far greater than 
the subsequent declines, such as those that occurred in the late 2000s. (Stocks, 
as you may know, go through similar and often more violent cycles — witness 
the major stock market decline in the early and late 2000s.) So if you have a 
long-term (ideally, a decade or more) investing-time horizon, you should do 
just fine if you invest in real estate. The average annual returns are comparable 
with those enjoyed by long-term stock market investors. The best time to buy 
a house is always a decade ago. A decade from now, today’s prices may look 
dirt-cheap.
Real Estate Investing Isn’t for Everyone
If you’re an impatient, busy person, investing in real estate probably isn’t an 
ideal investment. For one thing, locating, negotiating, and closing on property 
can take a big chunk of your time if you want to buy good property at a 
good price. Then there’s the chore (and the time sinkhole) of managing the 
property — you’re responsible for everything from finding tenants to keeping 
the building clean and in good working order. Your stock and mutual fund 
investments don’t call you in the middle of the night to fix a plumbing prob-
lem, but your tenants may!
Even if you have the time to invest in real estate, you may also consider some 
other important aspects of your personal financial situation. As we discuss in 
Chapter 2, taking advantage of tax-deductible retirement accounts is vital to 
your long-term financial health and ability to retire. Buying investment real 
estate can prevent you from saving adequately in retirement accounts. Saving 
for your down payment can hamper your ability to fund these retirement 
accounts. And most of the properties that you buy will require additional out-
of-pocket money in the early years.
REITs Are Good if You Loathe 
Being a Landlord
If you want to place some money in real estate but don’t like the thought 
of being a landlord, consider real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are 

315
 Chapter 16: Ten Things to Know When Investing in Real Estate
managed by a company that pools your money with that of other investors to 
buy a variety of investment real estate properties that these trusts manage.
 
REITs trade on the major stock exchanges, and some mutual funds also invest 
in REITs. Among the better REIT mutual funds to consider are
 
✓ CGM Realty: 800-345-4048; www.cgmfunds.com
 
✓ Cohen & Steers Realty Shares: 800-437-9912; www.cohenandsteers.com

✓ T. Rowe Price Real Estate Fund: 800-638-5660; www.troweprice.com
 
✓ Vanguard REIT Index Fund: 800-662-7447; www.vanguard.com
Don’t Invest in Limited Partnerships
 
You should avoid real estate limited partnerships that are sold through securi-
ties brokerage firms. Securities brokers, often operating under the misleading 
titles of financial consultant or financial advisor, love to sell limited partnerships 
because of the hefty commissions that limited partnerships pay to the broker. 
The broker’s take can range as high as 10 percent or more. Guess where this 
money comes from? If you said, “Out of my investment dollars,” go to the head 
of the class!
In addition to the fatal flaw that only 90 cents on the dollar you invest actu-
ally go to work for you in the investment, broker-sold limited partnerships 
typically carry hefty annual operating fees ranging from 2 to 3 percent. So 
when you add it all up (or, we should say, after all these commissions and 
fees are subtracted from your hard-earned dollars), limited partnerships are 
destined to be poor investments for you.
Avoid Timeshare Condos 
and Vacation Homes
Another way that smart people lose a great deal of money when investing in 
real estate is through involvement in timeshare condominiums and vacation 
homes. The allure of both of these purchases is having a place to which you 
can escape for fun and relaxation.
With a timeshare, you’re essentially buying the ownership of one week’s use 
of a condo. Suppose that, for this privilege, you pay a one-time fee of $7,000. 
Although $7,000 may not sound like a lot, if one week costs $7,000, buying the 

316
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
entire year’s rights to use the timeshare condo comes to more than $350,000. 
However, buying a similar condo in the area may set you back only about 
$125,000! So you’re paying a huge markup on your week’s ownership because 
of the costs of selling all those weeks and the need for the timeshare distribu-
tor to make a profit. (And you’ll be on the hook for your share of the annual 
maintenance fees of a couple hundred dollars or more.)
 
A far better idea is to rent a condo that someone else owns — it’s cheaper 
than owning, you can go to a different resort area each year (ski, beach, what-
ever), and you’ll have no ownership and managing headaches. Or you could 
buy a condo outright, rent it out to others throughout the year, and then rent 
another one for yourself for the week or two each year when you plan to take 
a vacation.
Another chilling thought: Timeshare condos are nearly impossible to sell. As 
we say in Chapter 8, the best time to think about selling a property is before 
you buy. Real estate is a relatively illiquid form of investment anyhow — why 
freeze your money solid in a timeshare condo?
Vacation homes present a different problem. Most people who purchase a 
vacation home use it for only a few weeks during the year. The rest of the 
time, the property is left vacant, creating a cash drain. Now, if you’re afflu-
ent enough to afford this luxury, we’re not going to stand in your way and 
discourage you from owning more than one home. But many people who buy 
vacation homes aren’t wealthy enough to afford them.
 
Before you buy a vacation property, examine your personal finances to deter-
mine whether you can still save enough each month after such a purchase to 
achieve your important financial goals, such as paying for higher education for 
your children or building your retirement nest egg. If you do buy a vacation 
home, consider buying a property that you can rent out during most of the 
time that you’re not using it.
Residential Properties Are Your 
Best Investment Option
If you’re going to invest in real estate, residential property is generally your 
safest and wisest investment:
 
✓ First, such types of real estate are probably the most familiar to you 
because you’ve lived in (and perhaps bought) such properties already.
 
✓ Second, residential property should be easier for you to manage and 
deal with on an ongoing basis. (Be sure that you’re knowledgeable about 
current rent-control laws — if any — in your community and how they 
affect the property you may buy.)

317
 Chapter 16: Ten Things to Know When Investing in Real Estate
 
Don’t forget that with landlording come lots of responsibilities and occasional 
tricky situations. That’s why we strongly recommend that you consult a good 
local real estate lawyer if you have any questions about the legality of buying 
or operating your rental property (see Chapter 9).
Commercial or retail real estate has many financial and legal nuances that 
you probably haven’t dealt with (and probably don’t want to deal with). 
Business real estate also tends to be more volatile in value because it’s more 
easily overbuilt, and the number of businesses, unlike the population of 
people in a locale, can shrink more quickly during poor economic conditions. 
We’re not saying that you should never try to invest in this more complicated 
type of property, but it’s better for you to learn to swim in a backyard pool 
before leaping straight into a shark-infested sea.
Consider Fixer-Upper Income Property
Residential property that has curable defects (see Chapter 8) can be a good 
investment for people who can manage the repair and rehabilitation of the 
property. You must buy such property at an absolute-rock-bottom price. To 
an investor, fixer-uppers can provide an income stream from rentals, as well 
as an appreciation in the property’s value that can result from bringing the 
property back to its highest and best use.
 
Before you try your hand at buying and fixing up a property, talk to people in 
your local area who’ve already done so. Real estate agents and tax advisors 
can probably refer you to other like-minded investors. Ask these investors to 
explain all the work involved, what surprises they confronted, and whether 
they’d make similar purchases again if they had known what they do now.
Consider Converting Small Apartment 
Buildings to Condos
In real estate markets like those in densely populated urban areas, buying 
a multiunit building and converting the units to condominiums can be 
extremely profitable. To make such a transformation succeed, you need a 
good real estate lawyer and a good real estate agent who knows the value of 
apartments as condos. You also need a wise contractor who can help you 
estimate the costs of the work and the challenges involved in securing proper 
building permits.

318
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
 
As we recommend for those contemplating buying fixer-uppers, before you try 
to buy a multiunit building and attempt to convert it to condos, talk to other 
investors who’ve already done so. Also speak with your town’s planning and 
building permit departments to see what sort of regulatory red tape awaits 
you. If the property is under rent control, be sure your lawyer investigates 
the ramifications of getting permission to do a condo conversion, which may 
include requirements such as giving a lifetime lease to handicapped and older 
tenants living in the building.
Consider the Property’s Cash Flow
When you’re considering the purchase of real estate for investment pur-
poses, you must crunch some numbers. You don’t need to remember any 
calculus (or even any high school algebra) to do these calculations — basic 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division will do.
 
To decide how much a specific property is worth (as a prospective buyer) and 
to understand the financial ramifications of your ownership of that property, 
calculate what’s called the property’s cash flow. You determine cash flow by 
summing the rental income that a property brings in on a monthly basis and 
then subtracting all the monthly expenses, such as the mortgage payment, 
property taxes, insurance, utility expenses that you (as the landlord) pay, 
repair and maintenance costs, advertising expenses, 5 percent (or more) 
vacancy factor, and so on. Be realistic, and add up all the costs. If the current 
owners of the property you’re buying are using it as investment real estate, 
ask them for a copy of Schedule E (Supplemental Income and Losses) from 
their income tax return.
Your Rental Losses Are 
Limited for Tax Purposes
 
If you purchase rental property that produces a negative cash flow, you 
should know before you buy whether you can claim that loss on your per-
sonal income tax return. If you’re a high-income earner — making more than 
$100,000 per year — your ability to deduct rental losses may be limited. If 
you’re a really high-income earner — making more than $150,000 per year — 
you may not be able to deduct any of your rental losses.

Ten Things to Consider When 
Selling Your House
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding whether to sell
▶ Pricing your house right
▶ Choosing an agent
▶ Planning for after the sale
O
nce you own a home, the odds are extraordinarily high that someday 
you’ll sell it. People who live their entire lives in their first home are 
rare. (Eric’s maternal grandparents accomplished this extraordinary feat — 
living more than six decades in the same home!)
Selling a house is generally somewhat less complicated than buying one. But 
just because selling a house may be easier than buying one doesn’t mean that 
most people sell their houses properly.
If word gets out that you’re considering selling your house, real estate agents 
will be attracted to you like hungry mosquitoes are to the one person on a 
desert island. And when you sell a house, the IRS and state tax authorities 
may be waiting with open wallets to attempt to take a chunk of your profits, 
especially if you don’t take the time to understand tax laws and how to make 
them work for you before you sell. So in this chapter, we advise you about 
some important issues that you should weigh and ponder before you sell. And 
if you do decide to sell, we want you to do the best possible job of selling your 
house and avoiding the tax man (legally). In addition to reading this chapter, 
when it comes time to sell, check out our companion book: House Selling For 
Dummies.

Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Why Are You Selling?
Start with the basics. If you’re contemplating selling, consider whether your 
reasons for selling are good ones. For example, who wouldn’t like to live in 
a larger home with more amenities and creature comforts? But if you hast-
ily put your home on the market in order to buy a bigger one, you may be 
making a major mistake. If your next, more expensive home stretches you too 
far financially, you may end up in ruin.
When you need to relocate for your job, or when you have a major life 
change, moving may be a necessity. Even so, you should weigh the pros and 
cons of keeping your property versus selling. Start this analytic process by 
reading the rest of this chapter.
Can You Afford to Buy the Next Home?
If you want to buy a more costly property, such a move is known in the real 
estate business as trading up. Doing an honest assessment of whether you 
can really afford to trade up is imperative. As we say in Chapter 3, no mort-
gage lender or real estate agent can objectively answer that question for you. 
Based on your income and down payment, the lender and agent can tell you 
the most that you can spend. They can’t tell you what you can afford to spend 
and still accomplish your other financial and personal goals.
 
One of the biggest mistakes that trade-up home buyers make is overextend-
ing themselves with debt to get into a more expensive property. The result-
ing impact on their budgets can be severe — no money may be left over for 
retirement savings, for educational expenses, or simply for having fun. In the 
worst cases, people have ended up losing their homes to foreclosure and 
bankruptcy when they suffered unexpected events, such as job losses or the 
deaths of spouses who had inadequate insurance.
Before you buy your next home, go through the same personal-finance exer-
cises we advocate in Chapters 2 and 3. Get a handle on what you can really 
afford to spend on a home. Unless your income or assets have increased 
significantly since the time that you purchased your last home, you probably 
can’t afford a significantly more expensive property. The most important 
issue for people to consider is how spending more money each month on a 
home will affect their ability to save for retirement.

321
 Chapter 17: Ten Things to Consider When Selling Your House
What’s It Worth?
When you’re ready to sell your house, you better have a good understanding 
of what it’s worth. You (and your agent, if you’re using one) should analyze 
what comparable properties are currently selling for in your neck of the 
woods. For a discussion about comparable market analysis, see Chapter 10.
 
If you need to sell your house without wasting a ton of time and energy, do 
what smart retailers do: Price it to sell. We’re not advocating that you give 
your property away, so to speak, but we are suggesting that you avoid inflat-
ing your asking price to a point far above what the sales of comparable houses 
suggest that your house is worth.
You may be tempted, particularly when you’re in no great hurry to sell, to 
grossly overprice your house in the hope that an uneducated buyer may 
pay you more than the property is really worth. The danger in this strategy 
is that you won’t find a fool who will part with all that money for your over-
priced property, and no one else will bid on it. Then, as you lower the price 
closer to what the house is really worth, prospective buyers may be wary of 
buying your property because of the extended length of time that it’s been on 
the market. In the end, you may have a hard time getting 100 percent of what 
your house is really worth.
Have You Done Your Homework to 
Find a Good Real Estate Agent?
When most people are ready to sell their houses, they enlist the services of 
a real estate agent. Good agents can be worth their commission if they know 
how to prepare the property for sale, market it, and get it sold for top dollar. 
Unlike when you’re a home buyer, your interests as a seller are aligned with a 
good agent’s interests — the more you sell the property for, the more you net 
from the sale, and the more the agent gets paid.
Given how much homes actually cost (and how much they cost to sell and 
buy), you owe it to yourself to have a good agent representing you in the 
sale of your house. Be sure that the agent you select isn’t currently listing so 
many other properties for sale that she lacks enough time to properly service 
your listing. Also, the agent you worked with when you bought the home isn’t 
necessarily the best agent to hire when you sell it. Different steps and exper-
tise are required to sell (rather than buy) a house. See Chapter 9 for our guid-
ance on finding a terrific agent.

322
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Do You Have the Skills to 
Sell the House Yourself?
Although some property owners possess the skills and time needed to sell a 
house themselves, most don’t. The carrot that may entice you to sell a house 
yourself is the avoidance of the 5 to 7 percent sales commission that agents 
ask for before they attempt to sell your property. Don’t forget, however, that 
half of this commission goes to a buyer’s agent. Because most buyers work 
with agents (partly because the agents’ services appear to be at no cost to 
the buyers), you’ll potentially save yourself only 2.5 to 3.5 percent of your 
property’s final selling price by selling it without an agent on your side.
 
Whether or not you sell the house yourself, interview several agents who’ve 
demonstrated that they know your neighborhood as a result of listing and selling 
properties in the area, and ask them to prepare a comparable market analysis for 
Listing agreements cover service, not sale
A listing agreement is not a contract between 
you and a real estate agent to sell your house. 
A listing agreement isn’t a contract of sale — 
it’s a personal service contract. It has nothing 
to do with actually transferring your property to 
buyers. It only authorizes a broker to act as your 
agent in finding people who’ll buy your house.
Two basic promises appear in listing agree-
ments. Your broker promises to do his best to 
find buyers for your house. You agree to pay 
your broker a commission if the broker finds 
buyers who are ready, willing, and able to pur-
chase your house under the listing agreement’s 
price and terms.
Here’s where things get tricky: Although the 
listing doesn’t technically obligate you to sell 
your house, in rare circumstances you may still 
be required to pay your broker a commission if 
he finds a buyer willing to purchase under the 
listing agreement’s price and terms and you, 
for some trivial reason such as not liking the 
buyer’s pet pug, suddenly decide not to sell. 
If, on the other hand, you decide not to sell 
because the job you were offered is no longer 
available, it’s highly unlikely you’d have to pay 
a commission.
However, if the broker produces an offer that 
doesn’t meet the listing agreement’s price and 
terms, you don’t have to accept it and, therefore, 
don’t owe him a commission — no matter how 
much time, energy, and money he has spent on 
your behalf. Selling a house isn’t the same as 
playing horseshoes. Close doesn’t count in real 
estate brokerage.
Avoid signing a listing agreement that com-
mits you to working exclusively with a broker 
for more than three months. If the broker does 
a good job and needs to renew the listing 
because your house hasn’t sold yet, you can 
renew or extend the listing. If, conversely, the 
broker does a lousy job, you have to suffer for 
only three months.

 Chapter 17: Ten Things to Consider When Selling Your House
your house. Base your asking price on what comparable properties have sold for 
in the past six months. If you’re shopping for an agent, also ask each one for an 
activity list of all the houses that he has sold over the past 12 months so that you 
can obtain references from property sellers who’ve worked with each agent.
Have You Properly Prepared 
the House for Sale?
The real work of selling a property begins before you ever formally place it 
on the market for sale or allow the first prospective buyer through the front 
door. Prepare your house for sale both inside and out. At a minimum, you 
should do the sort of cleanup work that you do before your parents (or per-
haps the in-laws) visit — you know, scrambling around the house cleaning 
everything up (or at least tossing it under beds and into closets!).
 
But you have more to do than just running a vacuum (after you pick up the 
laundry from the floors) and washing the dishes. Have some good but brutally 
honest friends and prospective agents walk through the house with you to 
point out defects and flaws that won’t cost you an arm and a leg to fix (for 
example, repairing leaky faucets or painting areas in need of new paint). Don’t 
be defensive — take good notes! You should generally avoid major projects, 
such as kitchen renovations, room additions, and the like. Rarely will you get 
a high enough additional sales price to compensate you for the extra costs 
(and headaches) of these major projects (not to mention for the time that you 
spend coordinating or doing the work).
Do You Understand the 
House’s Hot Buttons?
People don’t buy homes — they buy a hot button, and the rest of the home 
goes with it. Hot buttons vary from home to home. Dynamite kitchens or baths, 
fireplaces, views, and gardens are often buyer turn-ons. Location is the hot 
button for people who must live in a certain neighborhood.
 
How can you determine your house’s hot buttons? Think back to what 
appealed to you when you bought it. What you liked then will probably be the 
same hot buttons that will appeal to the next buyers. After you identify the hot 
buttons, emphasize them in your listing statement, multiple-listing descrip-
tion, and newspaper ads. Successful sellers know what the buyers will buy 
before they begin the marketing process.

324
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
What Are the Financial 
Ramifications of Selling?
Before you sell your house, you should understand the sale’s financial conse-
quences. For example, how much money will you spend on fix-up work? How 
much should you be netting from the sale in order to afford your next home?
 
Unless you want to and can afford to be the proud owner of two homes, we 
advocate selling your current house before you commit to buying another. You 
can ask for a long close of escrow and a rent-back, if necessary, so that 
you have time to close the sale of your next home without camping out on 
the street. Be sure about these things upfront so that you won’t have nasty 
surprises along the way or after you sell.
Do You Know the Rules for Capital Gains 
Taxes on the Sale of a House?
Under current tax laws, most house sellers enjoy a significant tax break. 
Specifically, a large amount of capital gains, or profits, on the sale of a home 
are excluded from tax: up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for 
married couples filing jointly. (See Chapter 15 for information about calculat-
ing your profit.)
To qualify for this capital gains exclusion, the seller must have used the 
house as her principal residence for at least two of the previous five years. 
You can use the exclusion no more than once every two years.
These house-sale laws replaced the previous rules relating to capital gains on 
the sale of a house. Thus, house sellers can no longer “roll over” profits from 
the sale of one home into the purchase of a more expensive one to avoid 
taxation. Gone also is the requirement to be 55 years of age or older to get a 
special $125,000 exclusion on profits.
For the vast majority of house sellers out there, the current laws are a boon. 
Most people’s house-sale profits don’t come anywhere near the law’s exclu-
sion limits, and many now benefit from the repeal of the age restriction. 
However, there are some homeowners out there — especially those who live 
in higher-cost areas and who’ve owned their homes for many years — whose 
gains exceed the $250,000 or $500,000 limits and who’ve lost the ability to roll 
these profits over into higher-priced homes. If they sell, they’ll owe tax on 
whatever profits exceed their applicable exclusion limits.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
D
on’t let the word appendix scare you. This part 
includes such priceless goodies as a sample of a 
comprehensive purchase contract, an example of an 
excellent inspection report, and a glossary chock-full of 
the many less-than-intuitive terms tossed around in the 
real estate business.

Appendix A
Sample Real Estate 
Purchase Contract
B
ecause a real estate purchase contract is a legal document, your real 
estate agent or lawyer should provide you the appropriate contract 
form for your area and help you fill it out. As a rule, these contracts range 
from somewhat complex to quite complex and sometimes convoluted. Most 
purchase contracts include a warning that says something like this:
“This is more than a receipt for money. It is intended to be a legally 
binding contract. Read it carefully.”
Heed the warning!
Purchase contracts vary in length, complexity, and terms from state to state 
and, within a state, from one locality to another. This appendix includes a 
sample of the California Association of Realtors’ real estate purchase con-
tract. We chose California’s contract because it’s one of the most comprehen-
sive residential real estate contracts around.
 
Blank spaces are open invitations to confusion (at best) and deception (at 
worst)! Giving someone a contract with blank spaces above your signature is 
like giving someone a signed blank check. They can fill in whatever they want 
over your signature, and you may have to pay. Do not leave any spaces blank 
on your contract.
Another important thing to check is the contract’s revision date — usually 
located in the bottom-left or -right corner of the page. Be sure that you’re 
working on the most recent version of the purchase contract.
See Chapter 12 for a more in-depth discussion of real estate purchase 
contracts.

Example of a Good 
Inspection Report
I
n Chapter 13, we show you an example of a lousy inspection report. This 
appendix gives an example of what you should expect to see in a good 
inspection report.
Like our sample, your report should paint a vivid word picture of the home 
you may purchase. The inspection report should be brimming with in-depth 
explanations — not merely a list of checkmarks, generic boilerplate, and 
hastily scribbled notes.
 
Get the most out of your inspection dollar. Find a professional inspection 
company that will thoroughly inspect the property’s mechanical and 
structural systems inside and out, from foundation to roof, and present you 
a solid report on which you can make an informed home-buying decision.

As requested by the buyer or buyer's agent, this report is being prepared for the exclusive use of the buyer to
accompany the on-site verbal presentation. In no way is it to be used by, nor are we obligated to review it with, any
third parties. Because Warren Camp Inspection Services (WCIS) has not personally described the extent and
nature of its findings to anyone but those present for the entire inspection, WCIS strongly discourages third parties
from using of this report. Interested parties should arrange with WCIS for an inspection that meets their more 
individualized needs.
This report provides a professional opinion of general features and major deficiencies of the building and its systems
at inspection. It does not necessarily analyze or report on adjacent properties, nor does it cover environmental /
neighborhood concerns. It summarizes observations on components inspected in accordance with customary
property-inspection standards. The scope of this inspection is limited only to items discussed. It is not technically
exhaustive. Because certain findings are variable (separations and cracking lengths that increase in time, levelness
and plumbness readings that may change over time, erosion and corrosion levels that do not remain static, and so
on), no one should rely on any reported findings for more than 60 days.
This is not a code compliance report; a home, product, or system guarantee of any kind; nor is it an evaluation of the
property’s saleability. It includes only items accessible to visual inspection; no furniture relocation, dismantling,
demolition, or other manual handling, etc., would have occurred in its preparation. It does not fulfill the requirements
set forth in California Civil Code Section 1102 as to the required disclosures of a transferor of real property.
The WCIS inspector explained to the client the two types of reports WCIS prepares. Rather than selecting the in-depth,
narrative report with extensive recommendations, the client selected the present standard report. Findings and
recommendations that would normally have been included in the extensive narrative report would be excluded from
this report.
Please call WCIS with your questions.

INTRODUCTION
The inspected property was a single-family dwelling. Most interior spaces were unfurnished.
Low-voltage wiring, heat exchangers, gardens, fences, retaining walls, underground piping and
storage tanks, and sprinklers are not included in the scope of this inspection report.
Warren Camp Inspection Service (WCIS) inspections are designed to meet or exceed recent
“Standards of Practice” established by the American Society of Home Inspectors® (ASHI®) of
which Warren Camp is a certified member. A copy of the Standards is available upon request.
For the most part, the building is a single-level, framed structure built over a crawl space.
Built around 1955, the original structural work of this wood-framed building appeared custom-
arily constructed. No unusual or extensive damage was apparent, however, several items need
attention.
Portions of this single-family dwelling have been recently remodeled. Alteration of the
plumbing and electrical systems, as well as several structural installations at the rear addition
was made in a nonprofessional manner. These concerns are brought up in other sections of this
report. Because many of the walls and ceilings were closed, it was not possible to ascertain the
full extent of renovation. If more information about these altered areas is needed, (a) consult
with a licensed structural engineer, (b) review copies of permits and remodeling contracts that
may be made available, and (c) examine the seller’s disclosure form.
The building interior and exterior were, for the most part, adequately maintained. But of
course, all buildings have flaws. We’ll discuss a number of these flaws, but we cannot discover
and report on every one. This inspection and report is not technically exhaustive, and WCIS
does not provide a thorough or fully detailed analysis of problem areas. With only a few hours
to inspect the entire property, WCIS provides, at best, a professional opinion based upon expe-
rience. Inspector Warren Camp is not a licensed engineer or expert in every trade or craft. Only
representative sample-checks of various exposed-to-view segments of this property were
made. If additional items or conditions are found when repairs or improvements begin, call
WCIS immediately before further work resumes.
All the main points of this report were fully discussed with Red E. Toobuy and his agent,
Ken B. Elpful, at inspection. The following sections describe the findings discussed.
Repairs, corrections, and other follow-up items to consider (Note: Check-marked concerns are merely
highlights of the inspector’s findings. Read the entire report to fully appreciate this effort. Where you
have interest, follow these and the following recommendations and have specialists address those dis-
cussed items that may not have been included in this inspection and report.)
 Check with the building inspection department about permits and inspections for any
building construction, alterations, and additions.
E XTERIOR
B u i l d i n g E x t e r i o r
This building, with board-and-batten siding on the facade, and stucco on the balance, needs
maintenance on the rear addition. Surfaces should be weathersealed in the not-too-distant fu-
ture to prevent moisture entry. When references are made to the front, rear, left, and right,
they are made facing the building from ___________ Street.
Additional items not yet painted or waterproofed were found. They include five louvered
wall vents, the garage door, one new entry door, and various windrow trim pieces.

At the garage rear, soil or pavement was close to or even with the foundation top. This con- 
dition can cause wood decay and deterioration. Because Warren Camp is not qualified as a 
structural/pest-control inspector, refer to a current report for findings and recommendations. 
Wood-to-earth contacts were found at stairway posts and doorsills. Contacts encourage 
wood decay, entry of pests, and moisture retention. All contacts should be properly separated 
and appropriate grade levels maintained. 
Rust deterioration was found on several exposed nails on the rear addition’s roof eave trim. 
Prior to painting, these surfaces should either be fully prepared for paint or removed. 
A few minor cracks in the stucco were evident at inspection. The cracking is likely due to ma- 
terial shrinkage or expansion, drought, seismic forces, or ordinary building movement. Cracks 
should be caulked and weathersealed. Contact a painting and waterproofing contractor to re- 
plenish and seal exterior surfaces to prevent water entry. 
Stucco siding on the rear and side yard walls extended downward over the foundation and 
made contact with grade (ground covering). This is conducive to entry of wood-destroying 
pests or organisms from behind the stucco. As an upgrade, raise the base of stucco siding a few 
inches to expose the foundation or lower the grade level.

Aluminum windows on the rear addition appeared sound. WCIS suggests that exposed wooden 
frames, sills, and trim adjacent to the metal window frames be routinely maintained to prevent 
possible water entry. A sampling of these windows was operated at inspection and a number 
were openable to an acceptable degree. 
Many of the original building’s painted, wood-sash windows were unable to be opened when 
tested, causing some rooms to be without adequate ventilation. Further, with respect to fire 
egress and other emergency situations, it could be extremely difficult and dangerous to attempt 
exit through such inoperable closed windows.  This should be corrected immediately.  In addition, 
routine maintenance is recommended for exposed wooden sashes, adjacent window trim, and 
glazing putty to eliminate potential water seepage and extend lifespan. 
The garage entry door was a tilt-up type without open-vent screens. 
Its spring balances were not equipped with a safety device that prevents catapulting that 
might occur if the springs were to actually break under pressure. Contact a professional garage 
door installer for appropriate replacement/correction.

Excess changes in the height of pavement at the front walkway could be a trip hazard. Exercise 
caution in this area. 
This building sits on a steep hillside. Erosive soil grooves were visible in a number of loca- 
tions. Not being engineers of any kind, WCIS is unable to represent or evaluate this condition. 
Red E. Toobuy can contact qualified engineers regarding the stability of the building and hill- 
side, as well as any past, present, or future soil embankment or ground or building movement. 
Adequate soil drainage for Bay Area homes is imperative because soil types in this area 
swell when saturated and may damage a building’s foundation. Grade at the front was noticea- 
bly sloped, likely providing adequate drainage away from the foundation during rainstorms. 
A drainage pattern at the rear and side yards was not as easy to predict. Water entry is prob- 
able into the building subarea possibly because the soil and pavement was not significantly 
sloped away from the building but should be. Because calcification and/or staining were found

on the inside of a few foundation walls, grading and drainage should be monitored regularly 
and should be improved. 
Moisture and drainage conditions vary with specific soil types, landscape/hardscape de- 
signs, and weather changes. Consequently, reporting on seepage and ponding conditions or 
making representations regarding soil stability cannot be made by this inspection company. 
Refer to a seller’s disclosure and/or a soil engineer’s report to learn of the possible presence of 
a subterranean French-drain system and to fully appreciate the potential for water entry — 
whether caused by light rains, natural springs, prolonged heavy rains, or other causes. Rou- 
tinely keep all drains, patios, and walkways clean and well maintained.

Understandably, inspection of inaccessible, underground perimeter drainage systems could not 
be inspected. Neither could WCIS inspect other underground devices such as conduits, gas and 
water piping, waste and vent lines, and so on, as well as under-slab components. Absolutely no 
testing of sewer lines is done by WCIS. 
WCIS detected no outward signs of presently existing or previously placed underground fuel 
storage tanks (USTs) within the inspected areas (e.g., a fill spout, vent pipe, supply tubing and 
return line, or a fuse box labeled “oil burner” — typical indicators of USTs). Interested parties 
may wish to explore further since such exploration is not within the scope of ASHI ®  standard 
inspection practices.

The foundation was only partially accessible because of low headroom throughout the subarea. 
No ratproofing membrane was yet placed beneath the family room, which might be a thought- 
ful consideration. 
Visible foundation stem walls, as viewed from the subarea doorway and building exterior 
have been installed according to customary practiced standards. 
Garage and crawl space legs were made of continuous concrete, which is often reinforced 
with internally placed steel bars that could not be examined or verified. 
There was hairline or minor cracking on foundation sections of the family room addition. 
Such cracking in a building of this type and age is not uncommon and should be routinely moni- 
tored. If the cracking increases, or new cracks develop, contact a qualified engineer for an 
evaluation. Looking for any direct and current transference of foundation movement to adja- 
cent finished walls, ceilings, and floors, no outward sign was detectable. It was not possible to 
determine if this cracking was a current condition. Determining whether foundations shift, set- 
tle, or rotate, or cracks will appear, or if existing cracks will extend further, is not within the 
scope of ASHI ®  inspections. Neither can WCIS predict the likelihood of future foundation fail- 
ures, shifting, or settlement. If more information is needed, a qualified structural engineer,

New and original framing was seen at the rear addition. The lower areas of partially accessible, 
exposed framing, were limited to portions of the crawl space. Framing, for the most part, was 
customary, with no visible sign of critical sags, cracks, deterioration, or movement. 
Wood posts in the crawl space below the family room were in unsatisfactory condition. The 
bottoms of support posts beneath the center girder were not connected to embedded concrete 
piers. No fastening devices (screws, nails, or bolts) could be found. Corrective work is needed 
and would be easy to accomplish at the direction of a structural engineer. 
The header supporting the garage access opening was some cause for concern because of 
the nonconforming size of fasteners used at each end. The header has also begun to rotate 
(shift) causing the fastening connections to weaken. Structurally, connections made between 
one structural member and another are essential. Post base-and-top connections, and beam con- 
nections to each other and to joists, were also minimal but could easily be supplemented. 
Cripple-wall studs in the garage and subarea were tied together customarily, however, they 
were not yet benefited with supplemental fasteners or plywood shearwall panels known today 
to strengthen wooden structures located in earthquake country. 
Many structural posts, beams, and studs had also not yet been retrofitted for earthquake 
preparedness. As a standard recommendation, these measures should be taken. All upgrade 
recommendations should come from a qualified, licensed, structural engineer. 
Moisture staining was found on garage interior walls. These stains looked and felt dry, and, 
when tested with the biprobe electric moisture meter, accessible stains were dry. Because the 
cause of water staining, and the determination of its currentness, is difficult to determine, refer 
to a seller’s disclosure statement to learn what efforts were made in each of these areas. 
Rodent dropping was found throughout the subarea. Contact a pest-control company for 
an evaluation. 
Portions of the subarea’s ceiling were installed with thermal insulation, however, a calculated 
“energy inspection” is not within this industry’s standards of practice. Several sections were 
loose or had fallen onto subarea soil. Corrective work is needed.

No evidence of current structural movement was noted during inspection of samplings of doors, 
windows, floors, walls, and ceilings. The tops of some doors were taper-cut to allow for wall 
shifting over the years. Any separations on walls, molding, or ceilings, or sagging or sloping of 
floors appeared to be the result of ordinary shifting and/or expansion within framing and sup- 
porting soils. In WCIS’s opinion, the findings do not represent significant, current movement.

joists. Consequently, only a limited visual inspection of the adjacent attic space was made from 
the access doorway. 
Attic floor joists had runs of electrical wiring laid through and over their tops. Care must be 
taken whenever attic access is required. 
Ceiling insulation was installed throughout much of the attic floor. Reporting on adequacy 
of building insulation is not within inspection-industry standards. Neither would we be able to 
examine or suspect any failures or hazards beneath or amid insulation. An electrical contractor 
could inspect the embedded wiring fully as a safety evaluation and provide a safety certificate. 
Insulation baffles, required around most heat-producing elements, such as lighting fixtures 
and flues, were not readily visible and should be provided as needed. 
Visually accessible roofing supports on the main building were customarily framed. A rep- 
resentative number of purlins (supporting members) and/or collar ties (members connecting 
two roof sections) were found. Unfortunately, the family room addition’s attic was completely 
inaccessible so no inspection whatsoever was made. 
There were beneficial vent openings at overhanging roof eaves. Ventilation was customarily 
provided and maintained. 
Hire a structural engineer to evaluate family room framing. 
 Seismically retrofit structural posts, beams, plates, and studs for wind load and earth- 
quake preparedness. 
Correct the rotated header and refasten it appropriately. 
Refer to a current structural/pest-control inspection report for findings and corrective 
recommendations. 
 Provide insulation baffles where needed and refasten fallen crawl space insulation.

WCIS has some fire-safety concerns with this property. Garage wall surfaces, adjacent to habit- 
able rooms, were not completely fire-resistant. Currently, there is risk of potential flame spread, 
as well as radon infiltration, into habitable spaces. Fully separate mechanical rooms from habit- 
able rooms (e.g., by installing or patching all openings and separations with fire-resistant dry- 
wall, plaster, sheet metal, etc., or undertaking fire-resistant construction where appropriate). 
WCIS was unable to locate any smoke detectors or sprinklers in this area. A monitored alarm 
system with adequate smoke and heat detectors could be installed. 
A few smoke detectors were installed in this building: on walls in three bedrooms and the 
ceiling of the common hallway. Because state and local codes change frequently, consult the 
building department for direction on optimal number, type, and location of units. Be certain to 
replace batteries every year with fresh batteries. Providing appropriately specified and located 
fire extinguishers also improves fire safety.

The building’s front door was equipped with a lock, deadbolt, and large glass pane. Glazing did 
not have a label certifying specification (e.g., tempered or safety). Door and window panes 
without safety glazing can be hazardous when broken, so current building codes require safety- 
labeled glass to minimize possible injury. Replacement is not customarily required; however,

exercise caution and common sense in this area to prevent accidental breakage and possible 
bodily injury. 
The front entry door lock requires minor adjustment for security as well as quick and easy 
operation. 
It was a solid-core door, which is more resistant to breaking and entering, as well as to 
flame spread than a hollow-core door. (Not all solid-core doors are fire-resistant unless label- 
certified.) 
The glass-and-flat-panel door from the garage to the side entry was a weak door offering 
little in the way of security. 
Front and rear pedestrian garage doors were without at least a 1-inch-throw lock or dead- 
bolt. At all exterior doors, deadbolts are the recommended auxiliary locking devices. 
The side entrance (kitchen) deadbolt was a “double-keyed” type — a key for the inside as 
well as outside lock cylinder is required. If these keys are not easily accessible, emergency 
egress could be impossible, and bear serious safety consequences. Conversion to single-keyed 
bolts is easy, affordable, and should be considered. Contact a locksmith.

Family room addition windows were installed close to the floor. Unfortunately, each glass pane 
lacked glazing labels certifying specification (e.g., tempered or safety). Replacement glazing, 
plastic film, or barrier installation may not now be required, but exercise caution and common 
sense in these areas until improvements are made. 
Means of egress was a concern. When attempting to freely operate the fire-exit windows 
leading outside from each bedroom, the windows were painted shut and unable to open. 
Interior and exterior lighting should be supplemented for overall security and safety. 
And, as a reminder before taking possession of your new home, rekey all existing door-lock 
cylinders to improve overall security and provide peace of mind. 
Provide and install needed fire protection, separations, devices, and safety systems or 
components. 
Improve security and door-lock safety. 
Make fire-egress windows freely and fully openable.

The main water-service shutoff valve was on the building’s front wall. It was operable; no leak- 
age was detected. A 3/4 -inch copper waterline joined the building from the street. Visible do- 
mestic hot- and cold-water-supply lines were mostly made of copper. 
WCIS found a combination of galvanized iron and copper waterlines at the front of the 
building. The seller might be able to provide information about the extent of copper piping re- 
placement. Galvanized iron water piping is subject over time to corrosion from mineral build- 
up that can restrict water flow to fixtures. Corrosion may or may not be extensive and WCIS 
cannot predict at what rate this will occur. 
Measured at the main valve, static pressure on the waterline was 89 pounds per square inch 
(PSI), which is a moderate-to-high level. Prescribed water-pressure-ratings are set at 55 to 65 PSI 
to prevent leakage from excessive pressures. A water-pressure regulator, pressure gauge on 
the incoming waterline, and routine water-pressure monitoring are always recommended.

Part of the hot-water piping in the subarea had no thermal insulation. Full insulation would 
reduce energy consumption and improve the hot-response time for each water fixture. 
This area’s copper water piping was also without proper or sufficient wall and ceiling fasten- 
ers. This omission might contribute to leakage or hammering noises in these lines, such as those 
WCIS detected in both bathrooms.

Throughout this structure, visible waste and vent piping was made of cast iron. A 2-inch cast 
iron waste or vent line beneath the crawl space access door was cracked and deteriorated, re- 
quiring replacement of this piping in the not-too-distant future. 
A waste/vent line in the garage was incomplete, lacking a cap or clean-out plug. Located to 
the right of the furnace, a plumber should simply install a proper cap or plug. 
A number of drains were inspected and maintaining an effective water trap-seal. 
Traps for both bathroom washbasins were a concern for WCIS because they were not fas- 
tened to a tailpiece and  each leaked . Competent plumbing connections are essential. Trap replace- 
ment would be inexpensive and easy.

The main gas-shutoff valve, located on the building’s front exterior wall, was tight. If a shutoff 
valve is not now, or in cases of emergency, accessible or operable, the local utility company
could be contacted for correction.
Install a water-pressure regulator and gauge on the incoming water line. 
Strap water and waste lines securely to the structure.

The hot-water heater in the garage was a gas-fueled type that was operating during inspection. 
It had no fiberglass thermal jacket. A new thermal insulation blanket, equipped with a razor- 
cut, insulated access door placed directly over the heater’s ID plate, should be installed. 
The water heater also lacked adequate cross-strapping and restraining blocks designed to 
resist movement during an intense earthquake. 
It was apparently a recently installed model. With a fiberglass tank, an identification plate 
indicated that this A. O. Smith appliance had a 40-gallon capacity, a setting of 38,000 BTUs, and a 
40.4-gallon-per-hour recovery rating. 
The tank bottom was free of rust. No leaks were evident. 
A safety valve on water heater tops, referred to as a “temperature and pressure relief valve,” 
is necessary for the safe operation of these appliances. The T&PR valve was properly located and 
a water overflow tube was connected to the valve according to accepted trade practices. 
The shutoff valve on the cold-water supply piping was operational. No leakage was evident. 
Hot-water piping immediately adjacent to the water heater had some thermal wrapping, 
however, an “energy inspection” is not within the scope of our inspections. 
The drain valve at the base of the tank, when opened, showed minimal sludge deposits. 
The gas-shutoff valve was difficult to operate and should be adjusted.

Fresh air needed for complete combustion was minimal in this area. Additional, continuous 
ventilation is suggested. Open air vents and windows provide such ventilation. 
Gas-fueled heaters must always be vented safely. Visible portions of the exhaust vent flue 
were installed in a questionable and possibly unsafe condition (inaccessible portions of piping 
were not inspected). Flue connections were inappropriately “taped over” with asbestos-like ma- 
terials. The mere presence of asbestos in a building material does not necessarily represent a 
health hazard. Many factors must be considered before making such determination (e.g., the 
percentage of asbestos make-up, exact type of asbestos, and current physical condition). Consid- 
ering the age of this building, other asbestos-containing materials that may not be visibly detect- 
able or identified in this report may be present. Contact specialty contractors to conduct lab-tests 
for asbestos presence and analysis, and if found to be positive, provide estimates for removal or 
encapsulation of these materials following the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s standards 
of practice. 
The flue was also stained, suggesting either leakage at the roofline or condensation from a 
lack of fresh air in this area. However, no moisture was evident in this area at inspection. 
As a standard earthquake-preparedness consideration, some or all of the following installa- 
tions should always be undertaken if not already present: 
a. Flexible water-supply piping to water heaters 
b. Fully functional seismic cross-strapping (see enclosed WCIS brochure) 
c. Flexible gas-supply piping to heaters and all gas-fueled appliances 
 Provide continuous fresh-air circulation.

A garage-area laundry area was no longer operational. No appliances were on location. 
Air chambers on the water lines above the laundry sink had not yet been installed. Because 
they benefit the circulation of hot and cold water within these lines, air chambers should be in- 
stalled by a qualified plumbing contractor before the sink is made operational. 
The concrete-and-iron sink was adequately secured to the garage rear wall. Neither a sewer 
vent line above nor trap seal beneath this laundry tray had been installed. Contact a licensed 
plumbing contractor for such installation. 
The gas-shutoff valve was tight and will require adjustment when connecting gas piping. 
“Fresh air exchange” was minimal in this laundry area. Regularly opened windows aid such 
ventilation. 
There was concern with the looseness of the 120-volt electric outlet next to the sink. This is a 
small repair job, and because looseness could compromise grounding protection, a licensed elec- 
trician should promptly examine and fasten this outlet to its box. 
Make the various recommended plumbing improvements when making the laundry 
area operational. 
 Install a vent and trap for the sink and secure the loose electrical receptacle.

The main disconnect switch and panel on the right exterior wall had a 60-amp overcurrent 
protection device for the building. Gauge markings on the conductors were taped over but their 
size suggested #8 wire gauge. Ampacity (the service entrance capacity) was marginal, based on 
the building’s current load-demands. To  ensure  adequate electrical size, or to increase it, contact a 
licensed electrician for a load calculation and evaluation. 
The main electrical panel was fastened to the building exterior but was unprotected from the 
weather. Corrosion was found inside the panel and gutter chamber. Because it has been known 
to cause shorting, deteriorated parts should be replaced. 
This panel was also extremely dirty, inside and out. Caution must be exercised in this loca- 
tion because foreign matter can allow arcing that can lead to shorting.

The building’s main disconnect device was combined in a panel with other circuits. No other sub- 
panels were easily located or inspected. 
Protected by circuit breakers, the combined main-disconnect-and-distribution panel had the 
following circuitry distribution: 
1 @ 120-volt circuit at 15 amps 
4 @ 120-volt circuits at 20 amps 
This subpanel was not fully circuit-labeled but should be. It was, however, benefited by a closed- 
front protection cover. 
“Double-tapping” (connecting two conductors to one circuit breaker) occurred within this 
panel. Such wiring should be corrected immediately  because double tapping increases the possibility 
and frequency of tripping the overcurrent protection device. 
As a part of regular property maintenance, all circuit breakers should be trip-tested, then re- 
set yearly, to insure that they are, and will remain, fully operational.

Of course, all electrical systems should be safely and properly grounded. An appropriately 
driven grounding rod was not easily located beneath the main panel. When sample testing 
outlets requiring adequate grounding, some had little or no grounding protection. 
There was an “open ground” (ungrounded) condition in the living room, three bedrooms, 
and family room, which can be hazardous.  This should be corrected immediately for maximum per- 
sonal safety. 
In a random sampling of receptacles, “reverse polarity” was present in a few locations (in 
both bathrooms and at each side of the kitchen sink). This condition, hazardous in certain in- 
stances, can be easily corrected and should be. What’s more, the receptacle in the master bath- 
room was not protected with a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) device as expected.

Electrical wiring for this building was comprised of original as well as supplemental wiring. 
Much of the exposed wiring was the Romex ® type. 
The following is only a sampling of wiring concerns and is not intended to take the place of 
an electrical contractor’s findings: 
a. A defective light switch for the kitchen’s above-sink lighting fixture needs replacement.

b. Both bathroom light fixtures were extremely loose and this can compromise grounding 
protection. Securely fasten each fixture immediately . 
c. Some Romex wiring on garage walls was less than 8 feet high and unprotected, and this 
may permit damage to the cable. Exposed wiring should be piped into metal conduit or 
covered with approved protective material such as drywall. 
d. Extension cord wiring was inappropriately used as a substitute for permanent wiring in 
the master bedroom and should be properly wired if the fixture is to remain in use. 
e. Light fixtures in the garage and master bathroom were without lamps (bulbs). Because 
mistaken contact with hot sockets can be dangerous, replacement lamps should be pro- 
vided in every such location. 
In summary, safety concerns have arisen with interior wiring as well as the service entrance 
feeding the building. Hire a licensed electrician as soon as possible to examine the entire electrical 
system to its fullest and make corrections wherever needed. 
WCIS always recommends the installation of ground-fault circuit-interruption-type
receptacles in kitchens, bathrooms, and other wet locations as an added safety measure. Pro- 
vide where needed at the direction of a licensed electrician. 
Clean the main panel, replace deteriorated components therein, provide complete cir- 
cuit identification labeling therein, and protect the panel from the elements. 
 Remedy immediately all grounding, polarity, lighting, and wiring problems. 
 Securely fasten loose switches, receptacles, and lighting fixtures.

The Borg Warner brand gas-fueled, forced-air furnace in the garage rear had an estimated 
64,000-BTU-input-capacity rating. Installed several years ago, it may be approaching the end of 
its “useful life.” If a life-expectancy determination is needed, contact a heating specialist. 
The following heating concerns are noted: 
a. The gas-shutoff valve was tight and requires minor adjustment. 
b. Presence of a natural gas leak was detected at the furnace’s front shelf. Such leakage could 
be extremely hazardous and must be corrected immediately . Contact a licensed plumber or a 
utility company representative for thorough testing and analysis.
c. No service calendar was visible at inspection. A current record of scheduling visits would 
suggest maintenance history of the heating system. 
d. This appliance did not have benefit of pilotless ignition. A thermocouple device, which 
would shut off the gas supply if the pilot were not lit, would be a thoughtful pilot-safety 
upgrade. 
e. An electrical disconnect switch was mounted on the left side of the furnace to facilitate 
shutting down electrical power to this appliance for maintenance and repairs. 
f. No thermal insulation was presently installed on the return-air duct above the furnace. 
Because the duct is in an unconditioned or cold area, such omission lends itself to higher 
energy consumption than on insulated ducts. 
g. The warm-air ducts and plenum were wrapped with asbestos-like material that was 
crumbly. Contact specialty contractors to conduct a lab-test for asbestos presence and 
analysis here and around the house, and if found to be positive, provide estimates for

The return-air duct, flame ports, shelf, and furnace bottom were dirty. On the hall floor, the 
warm-air supply register and its interior were extremely dirty. These areas should be vacuumed 
promptly and regularly. 
The filter box allows for a 14 x 25 x 1-inch filter. The filter was clean and properly installed. 
Furnace filters need to be changed every two to four months. Dirty filters actually block airflow 
to the heat exchanger causing it to overheat. Improper filter maintenance is a primary cause of 
premature cracking of a furnace’s heat exchange components. 
Oxygen sources necessary for complete combustion were minimal in the furnace chamber. 
Fresh-air entry was obstructed by boxes of personal belongings blocking the wall’s ventilation 
screens. Remove obstructions and continually enable sufficient fresh-air exchange in this area.

This heater’s gas burners appeared to be out of balance with unusual flame characteristics known 
as “dancing flames.” Unevenness is difficult for anyone but a heating contractor or utility com- 
pany technician to analyze. Such a check-up should be made as soon as possible. 
There was minor corrosion and pitting around the frontal entry of the heat exchanger area. 
The firebox (heat exchanger) of this furnace separates and redirects hot air from ambient air, 
which it also warms and circulates. A full inspection of a heat exchanger is not possible without 
dismantling a furnace, which was not done by WCIS. There was also no access for an inspection 
mirror. Ask the local utility or a heating contractor to conduct a standard safety check of this
and all gas appliances, supply lines, and flues, now and at every change of occupancy.
Correct the gas leak at once. 
Loosen the shutoff valve. 
Address the nature and risk of asbestos-like material. 
 Clean the ventilation and circulation components. 
Provide adequate fresh-air ventilation.

Windows in a number of rooms need additional attention. Some window locks and hard- 
ware need adjustment. In addition, at least three double-hung sashes in the master bedroom 
had broken wires. And one garage window had a cracked glass pane that should be replaced.

The living room fireplace had a sound firebox. Little cracking of bricks or mortar joints was de- 
tected. The firebox was empty. 
Needing attention was the matter of cleanliness of the firebox, damper throat, and full extent 
of the chimney. The National Fire Prevention Association recommends that an in-depth inspec- 
tion of the entire fireplace system be performed whenever there’s a change of ownership of a 
home having a solid-fuel-burning fireplace. Thereafter, contact a professional chimney-sweep 
contractor to fully examine, repair, and clean all needed areas, as well as those that were not 
readily accessible for today’s inspection, on a regular basis. This will insure continued safe and 
efficient fireplace operation. 
The chimney flue had a cap on its top and it was the spark-arresting type. This protective 
ember screen was in satisfactory condition. 
The fireplace damper door was operational and well fitted. However, neither a protective 
ember screen nor a glass-door assembly was presently in place at the firebox’s outer hearth.

Inner surfaces of the dishwasher were empty and clean. It did not have an anti-siphoning de- 
vice but was well secured to the underside of the counter. An anti-siphoning device, installed 
above the sink rim, prevents backflow of waste products into the clean dishwasher appliance if 
the sewer system were to become blocked. A licensed plumber should be contacted for this 
installation. 
Stained hardwood cabinetry was in satisfactory condition; however, only a sampling of this 
kitchen’s cabinet doors, drawers, and connections was made. 
Plastic-laminated counters were in satisfactory condition, however, the backsplash to the 
right of the range was loose and needs securing and caulking. Joints in all counter, backsplash, 
and sink areas should be continuously sealed with a good quality, flexible caulk to help prevent 
moisture penetration. 
A ducted exhaust fan in the overhead microwave appliance was operational. The exhaust fan 
filter was greasy, and the fan motor drew air weakly and may be grease-bound. For an efficient

This building had two bathrooms that were recently remodeled. The sinks and faucets, traps and 
drains, and angle stops worked well when tested. 
Water pressure was adequate; however, measurement is only a relative comparison rating. 
New owners should personally test each fixture to become familiar with each and make desired 
modifications. 
Testing “dynamic water flow” (the running of two or more cold water fixtures concurrently) 
showed a noticeable drop in volume. Red E. Toobuy and his real-estate agent were told how to 
perform a “homeowner’s dynamic water flow and temperature test” on each fixture to ascer- 
tain the risk of accidental scalding when cold faucets are activated while someone is taking a 
shower. 
No evidence of significant or unusual deterioration was evident on visible drain lines and 
trap piping. Tested drains ran freely, however, water leakage was found at the guest bathroom 
sink drain. This leak needs  immediate repair and/or correction. 
Both toilets were secured and caulk-sealed to the floor. The guest bathroom’s toilet seat was 
extremely loose and needs to be tightened. 
Shower glass in the master bathroom did have a glazing label certifying composition (e.g., 
tempered or safety). Both tub and shower areas had well-fastened grab bars. 
The guest bathroom ceiling fan drew air weakly and seemed to need cleaning, servicing, or 
replacement. 
The guest bathroom’s resilient floor covering had an open seam that needs adhesive and 
caulk. 
Correct the leaking guest bathroom sink drain. 
Fasten the loose toilet seat of the guest bathroom. 
Clean, service, or replace the exhaust fan.

Multiple layers of composition shingles appear to have been laid over this structure. The actual 
number or combined weight placed on structural members could not be determined. Multiple 
layers concern roofers and inspectors for different reasons: they create an uneven surface; re- 
tain moisture and/or gas vapors between membranes; may transfer decay to structural mem- 
bers in their contact; and may add excessive weight to the structure. Whenever multi-layered 
roofs receive their next membrane, all existing roofing materials should be torn off and dis- 
carded. Consider installing appropriately specified plywood sheathing at that time. 
Although not fresh, and showing routine wear and tear due to exposure, the composition 
shingles on each roof slope appeared sound. There was little or no evidence of unusual or sig- 
nificant roof deterioration however moss growth was evident on the lower portion of the 
north-facing slope. Contact a roofing contractor to determine ways to eliminate this growth. 
Debris was found on the front roof slope where the tall tree has been dropping leaves and 
branches over time. Roofing must be promptly and regularly cleaned and maintained.

Step-shingle flashing is a quality feature. It was visible at the base of the fireplace chimney. Rust 
was observed on a portion of this flashing, suggesting further exploration and analysis by a 
sheet metal contractor. 
Pipe vent and perimeter flashing were in satisfactory condition. 
Sections of valley flashing were exposed. Overall, the condition was satisfactory. 
Three gutter seams were noticeably rusted, especially on the unpainted interior face. In 
addition, two separated or missing gutter ends were found that need correction. Hire a sheet 
metal contractor to make needed repairs or replacements. 
Gutters had collected organic debris from overhead trees. Keep gutters, downspouts, and all 
other drain openings free of debris for proper drainage throughout the year. 
The downspout system was, for the most part, customarily installed. Unfortunately, a num- 
ber of downspouts likely dump water directly onto foundation areas below, which can cause 
erosion and building settlement over time. Splash blocks or extenders can be placed at the base 
of such downspouts to divert collected water. As an option, see if a licensed plumbing contrac- 
tor can connect downspout piping to an existing drain line.

Roofs are seldom, if ever, regularly inspected. Regardless of whether a WCIS roof inspection
was made, roofing problems are often subtle and difficult to evaluate. Because property
inspectors don’t often have the hands-on training and accessibility roofers have, whenever
questions of roofing adequacy arise, a licensed roofing contractor should be asked to
provide a thorough inspection and evaluation.

Appendix C
Glossary
T
he terms that appear in italic type within the definitions are defined in 
this glossary.
acceleration clause: Watch out for an acceleration clause in your mortgage 
contract. This provision gives the lender the right to demand payment of the 
entire outstanding balance if you miss a monthly payment, sell the property, 
or otherwise fail to perform as promised under the terms of your mortgage. 
(See also due-on-sale clause.) Ouch!
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): An adjustable-rate mortgage is a mortgage 
whose interest rate and monthly payments vary throughout its life. ARMs 
typically start with an unusually low interest rate (see teaser rate) that 
gradually rises over time. If the overall level of interest rates drops, as 
measured by a variety of indexes (see index), the interest rate of your ARM 
generally follows suit. Similarly, if interest rates rise, so does your mortgage’s 
interest rate and monthly payment. Caps (see also periodic cap and life cap) 
limit the amount that the interest rate can fluctuate. Before you agree to an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, be sure that you can afford the highest payments 
that would result if the interest rate on your mortgage increased to the 
maximum allowed.
adjusted cost basis: For tax purposes, the adjusted cost basis is important 
when you sell your property because it allows you to determine what your 
profit or loss is. You can arrive at the adjusted cost basis by adding the cost 
of the capital improvements that you’ve made to the home to the price that 
you paid for the home. Capital improvements increase your property’s value 
and its life expectancy.
adjustment period or adjustment frequency: This term has nothing to do 
with the first few weeks after you’ve broken up with your sweetheart; it refers 
to how often the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage changes. Some 
adjustable-rate mortgages change every month, but more typically they have 
one or two adjustments per year. The less frequently your loan rate shifts, 
the less financial uncertainty you may have. But less frequent adjustments in 
your mortgage rate mean that you’ll probably have a higher teaser rate, or 
initial interest rate. (The initial interest rate is also called the “start rate.”)

356
Par t VI: Appendixes 
annual percentage rate (APR): This figure states the total yearly cost of a 
mortgage as expressed by the actual rate of interest paid. The APR includes 
the base interest rate, points, and any other add-on loan fees and costs. Thus, 
the APR is invariably higher than the rate of interest that the lender quotes 
for the mortgage.
appraisal: You must pay for the mortgage lender to hire an appraiser to give 
an “opinion of value” (that is, the appraiser gives a measure of the market 
value) of the house you want to buy. This professional opinion helps protect 
the lender from lending you money on a home that’s worth less than what 
you agree to pay for it. For typical homes, the appraisal fee is usually several 
hundred dollars.
appreciation/depreciation: Appreciation refers to the increase of a proper-
ty’s value. Depreciation (the reverse of appreciation) is when a property’s 
value decreases.
arbitration of disputes: This is a method of solving contract disputes that’s 
generally less costly and faster than going to a court of law. In arbitration, 
buyers and sellers present their differences to a neutral arbitrator who, after 
hearing the evidence, makes a decision that resolves the disagreement. The 
arbitrator’s decision is final and may be enforced as though it were a court 
judgment. Consult a real estate lawyer if you’re ever a party in an arbitration. 
(Also see mediation of disputes.)
assessed value: The assessed value is the value of a property (according 
to your local county tax assessor) for the purpose of determining your 
property tax.
assumable mortgage: Some mortgages allow future buyers of your home to 
take over the remaining loan balance of your mortgage. If you need to sell 
your house but the interest rate is high, having an assumable mortgage may 
be handy. You may be able to offer the buyer your assumable loan at a 
lower interest rate than the current going interest rate. Most assumables 
are adjustable-rate mortgages — fixed-rate, assumable mortgages are nearly 
extinct these days because lenders realize that they lose a great deal of 
money on these types of mortgages when interest rates skyrocket.
balloon loans: These loans require level payments, just as a 15- or 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgage does. But well before their maturity date (the date when 
you pay them off) — typically, three to ten years after the start date — 
the loan’s full remaining balance becomes due and payable. Although balloon 
loans can save you money because they charge a lower rate of interest 
relative to fixed-rate loans, balloon loans are dangerous. Being able to 
refinance a loan is never a sure thing. Beware of balloon loans!

357
 Appendix C: Glossary
bridge loan: If you find yourself in the inadvisable situation where you close 
on a new home before you sell your old one, you may need a short-term 
bridge loan. Such loans enable you to borrow against the equity that’s tied up 
in your old house until it sells. We say “bridge” because such a loan is the 
only thing keeping you above water financially during this period when you 
own two houses. Bridge loans are expensive compared with other alterna-
tives, such as using a cash reserve, borrowing from family or friends, or using 
the proceeds from the sale of your current home. In most cases, you need the 
bridge loan for only a few months in order to tide you over until you sell your 
house. Thus, the loan fees can represent a high cost (about 10 percent of the 
loan amount) for such a short-term loan.
broker: A real estate broker is one level higher on the real estate professional 
totem pole than a real estate agent (or salesperson). Real estate agents can’t 
legally work on their own — a broker must supervise them. To become a 
broker in most states, a real estate salesperson must have a number of years 
of full-time real estate experience, meet special educational requirements, 
and pass a state licensing exam. See also real estate agent and Realtor.
buydown: A buydown is a VA loan plan that’s available only in some new 
housing developments and that targets veterans with low or modest 
incomes. Buydown simply means that a builder agrees to pay part of the 
home buyer’s mortgage for the first few years. Sellers also sometimes do 
interest-rate buydowns to create attractive financing for buyers of their 
houses by paying lenders a predetermined amount of money so lenders will 
reduce their mortgage interest rates.
buyer’s brokers: Historically, real estate agents and brokers worked only for 
sellers. The buyer’s broker owes allegiance only to the buyer and doesn’t 
have an agent relationship with the seller. Although this may seem to be an 
improvement for all the buyers in the world, don’t be too ecstatic. Buyer’s 
brokers are still paid on commission when you buy, so don’t expect them to 
be supportive of you if you habitually lollygag. Also keep in mind that the 
higher the purchase price of the house, the more money the buyer’s broker 
makes.
capital gain: For tax purposes, a capital gain is the profit that you make when 
you sell a home. If you buy a home for $175,000 and then (a number of years 
later) sell the house for $325,000, your capital gain is $150,000. A sizable 
amount of capital gain on a house sale is excluded from federal tax: up to 
$250,000 for qualifying single taxpayers and $500,000 for married couples 
filing jointly.
capital improvement: A capital improvement is money you spend on your 
home that permanently increases its value and useful life — putting a new 
roof on your house, for example, rather than just patching the existing roof.

358
Par t VI: Appendixes 
caps: Real estate caps have nothing to do with dental work. Two different 
types of caps for adjustable-rate mortgages exist. The life cap limits the 
highest or lowest interest rate that’s allowed over the entire life of your mort-
gage. The periodic cap limits the amount that your interest rate can change in 
one adjustment period. A one-year ARM, for example, may have a start rate of 
7.5 percent with a plus or minus 2 percent periodic adjustment cap and a 6 
percent life cap. On a worst-case basis, the loan’s interest rate would be 9.5 
percent in the second year, 11.5 percent in the third year, and 13.5 percent 
(7.5 percent start rate plus the 6 percent life cap) forevermore, starting with 
the fourth year.
cash reserve: Most mortgage lenders require that home buyers have 
sufficient cash left over after closing on their home purchase to make the 
first two mortgage payments or to cover a financial emergency.
closing costs: After you pass every home-buying obstacle and reach the safe 
clearing in order to buy your home, one final potential land mine appears in 
the form of closing costs. These costs generally total 2 percent to 5 percent 
of the home’s purchase price and are completely independent of (and in 
addition to) the down payment. Closing costs include such things as points 
(that is, the loan origination fee to cover the lender’s administrative costs), 
an appraisal fee, a credit report fee, mortgage interest for the period between 
the closing date and the first mortgage payment, the homeowners insurance 
premium, title insurance, prorated property taxes, and recording and transfer-
ring charges. So when you’re finally ready to buy, you need to have enough 
cash to pay all these costs in order to buy your dream home.
commission: The commission is the percentage of a house’s selling price 
that’s paid to the real estate agent and broker. Because most agents and 
brokers are paid by commission, understanding how the commission can 
influence the way that agents and brokers work is important for home 
buyers. Agents and brokers make money only when you make a purchase, 
and they make more money when you make a bigger purchase. Choose an 
agent carefully, and take your agent’s advice with a grain of salt, because 
this inherent conflict of interest can often set an agent’s visions and goals at 
odds with your visions and goals.
community property: Along with joint tenancy and tenancy-in-common, 
community property is a way that married couples may take title to real 
property. Community property offers two major advantages over joint 
tenancy and tenancy-in-common. First, community property ownership 
allows spouses to transfer interests, by a will or otherwise, to whomever 
they want. The second advantage of holding title to a home in community 
property is that the surviving spouse gets favorable tax treatment. The 
entire house’s market value as of the spouse’s date of death (such market 
value is also called the house’s “stepped-up basis”) is used rather than the 
house’s original cost, which reduces the taxable profit (assuming that the 
home has appreciated in value) when the house is sold.

359
 Appendix C: Glossary
comparable market analysis (CMA): Buying a Ford Taurus from the first 
dealer that you visit would be impulsive and foolish. You need to shop 
around to find out where the best deal on that type of car is. The same is true 
with home buying. If you’re interested in buying a home, you need to find out 
how much money houses in the area have been selling for. You must identify 
“comparable” homes that have sold within the past six months, are in the 
immediate vicinity of the home you desire to purchase, and are as similar 
as possible to the one that you’re interested in buying in terms of size, age, 
and condition. You must do the same thing for comparable houses currently 
on the market to see if prices are rising, flat, or falling. A written analysis of 
comparable houses currently being offered for sale and comparable houses 
sold in the past six months is called a comparable market analysis (CMA).
conditions: See contingencies.
condominiums: Condominiums are housing units that are contained within a 
development area in which you own your actual unit and a share of every-
thing else in the development (lobby, parking areas, land, and the like, which 
are known as common areas). Condominiums are a less-expensive form of 
housing than single-family homes. For this reason, some people mistakenly 
view them as good starter houses. Unfortunately, condos generally don’t 
increase in value as rapidly as single-family houses do, because the demand 
for them is lower than the demand for houses. And because condos are far 
easier for builders to develop than single-family homes, the supply of condos 
often exceeds the demand for them.
contingencies: Contingencies are conditions contained in almost all home 
purchase offers. The seller or buyer must meet or waive all contingencies 
before the deal can close. These conditions relate to such things as the 
buyer’s review and approval of property inspections or the buyer’s ability 
to get the mortgage financing that’s specified in the contract.
convertible adjustable-rate mortgage: Unlike a conventional adjustable-rate 
mortgage, a convertible adjustable-rate mortgage gives you the opportunity 
to convert to a fixed-rate mortgage, usually between the 13th and 60th 
month of the loan. For this privilege, convertible adjustable-rate mortgage 
loans have a higher rate of interest than conventional adjustable-rate 
mortgages, and a conversion fee (which can range from a few hundred 
dollars to 1 percent or so of the remaining balance) is charged. Additionally, 
if you choose to convert to a fixed-rate mortgage, you’ll pay a slightly higher 
rate than what you can get by shopping around for the best rates available 
at the time you convert.
cooperatives (co-ops): Cooperatives are apartment buildings where you 
own a share of a corporation whose main asset is the building that you 
live in. In high-cost areas, cooperatives (like their cousins, condominiums 
and townhouses) are cheaper alternatives to buying single-family houses. 
Unfortunately, cooperatives also resemble their cousins in that they 
generally lag behind single-family homes in terms of appreciation. Co-ops 
are also, as a rule, harder to sell and obtain loans for than condominiums.

360
Par t VI: Appendixes 
cosigner: If you have a checkered past in the credit world, you may need help 
securing a mortgage, even if you’re financially stable. A friend or relative can 
come to your rescue by cosigning (which literally means being indebted for) 
a mortgage. A cosigner can’t improve your credit report but can improve your 
chances of getting a mortgage. Cosigners should be aware, however, that 
cosigning for your loan adversely affects their future creditworthiness 
because your loan becomes what’s known as a contingent liability against 
their borrowing power.
cost basis: See adjusted cost basis.
covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs): CC&Rs establish a condo-
minium by creating a homeowners association that stipulates how the 
condominium’s maintenance and repairs are handled and regulates what 
can and can’t be done to individual units and the condominium’s common 
areas. These restrictions may apply to lawn maintenance, window curtain 
colors, and the like. Some CC&Rs also put community decision-making rights 
into the hands of a homeowners association.
credit report: A credit report is the main report that a lender uses to deter-
mine your creditworthiness. You must pay for the lender to obtain this 
report, which the lender uses to determine your ability to handle all forms of 
credit and to pay off loans in a timely fashion.
debt-to-income ratio: Before you go out home buying, you should determine 
what your price range is. Lenders generally figure that you shouldn’t 
spend more than about 33 to 40 percent of your monthly income for your 
housing costs. The debt-to-income ratio measures your future monthly 
housing expenses — which include your proposed mortgage payment (debt), 
property tax, and insurance — in relation to your monthly income.
deed: A deed is the document that conveys title to real property. Before you 
receive the deed, the title insurance company must receive the mortgage 
company’s payment and your payments for the down payment and closing 
costs. The title insurance company must also show that the seller holds clear 
and legal title to the property for which the title is being conveyed.
deed in lieu of foreclosure: Instead of foreclosure, which is generally costly 
and time-consuming for all parties, a deed in lieu of foreclosure is a voluntarily 
entered agreement whereby the borrower conveys ownership of the prop-
erty in default to the lender to obtain release from the lender from paying 
outstanding debt on that property.
default: Default is the failure to make your monthly mortgage payments 
on time. You’re officially in default when you miss two or more monthly 
payments. Default also refers to other violations of the mortgage terms. 
Default can lead to foreclosure on your house.

361
 Appendix C: Glossary
delinquency: At first you’re in delinquency; then you’re in default. 
Delinquency occurs when a monthly mortgage payment isn’t received by the 
due date.
down payment: The down payment is the part of the purchase price that the 
buyer pays in cash, upfront, and doesn’t finance with a mortgage. Generally, 
the larger the down payment, the better the deal you can get on a mortgage. 
You can usually get access to the best mortgage programs with a down 
payment of 20 percent of the home’s purchase price.
due-on-sale clause: A due-on-sale clause contained in the mortgage entitles 
the lender to demand full payment of all money due on your loan when you 
sell or transfer title to the property.
earthquake insurance: Although the West Coast is often associated with 
earthquakes, other areas are also prone to earthquakes. An earthquake 
insurance rider on a homeowners policy pays to repair or rebuild your home 
if it’s damaged in an earthquake. If you live in an area with earthquake risk, 
get earthquake insurance coverage!
equity: In the real estate world, equity refers to the difference between your 
home’s market value and what you owe on it. For example, if your home is 
worth $250,000 and you have an outstanding mortgage of $170,000, your 
equity is $80,000.
escrow: Escrow isn’t an exotic dish; it’s the holding of important documents 
and money (related to the purchase/sale of a property) by a neutral third 
party (the escrow officer) prior to the transaction’s close. After the seller 
accepts the buyer’s offer, the buyer doesn’t immediately move into the 
house. A period follows during which contingencies have to be met or waived. 
During this period, the escrow service holds the buyer’s down payment and 
the buyer’s and seller’s documents related to the sale. “Closing escrow” 
means that the deal is completed. Among other duties, the escrow officer 
makes sure that the previous mortgage is paid off, your loan is funded, and 
the real estate agents are paid.
Fannie Mae: See Federal National Mortgage Association.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC): The FHLMC (or Freddie 
Mac) is one of the best-known institutions in the secondary mortgage market. 
Freddie Mac buys mortgages from banks and other mortgage-lending institu-
tions and, in turn, sells these mortgages to investors. These loan investments 
are generally considered safe because Freddie Mac buys mortgages only from 
companies that conform to its stringent mortgage regulations, and Freddie 
Mac guarantees the repayment of principal and interest on the mortgages 
that it sells.

362
Par t VI: Appendixes 
Federal Housing Administration mortgages (FHA): Federal Housing 
Administration mortgages are marketed to people with modest means. The 
main advantage of these mortgages is that they require a small down payment 
(usually between 3 percent and 5 percent). FHA mortgages also offer a com-
petitive interest rate — typically, 0.5 to 1 percent below the interest rates on 
other mortgages. The downside is that with an FHA mortgage, the buyer must 
purchase mortgage default insurance (see private mortgage insurance).
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA): The FNMA (or Fannie Mae) 
is one of the best-known institutions in the secondary mortgage market. 
Fannie Mae buys mortgages from banks and other mortgage-lending institu-
tions and, in turn, sells them to investors. These loan investments are 
generally considered safe because Fannie Mae buys mortgages only from 
companies that conform to its stringent mortgage regulations, and Fannie 
Mae guarantees the repayment of principal and interest on the loans that 
it sells.
fixed-rate mortgage: The fixed-rate mortgage is the granddaddy of all mort-
gages. You lock into an interest rate (for example, 7.5 percent), and it never 
changes during the life (term) of your 15- or 30-year mortgage. Your mortgage 
payment is the same amount each and every month. Compare fixed-rate 
mortgages with adjustable-rate mortgages.
flood insurance: “When the flood waters recede, the poor folk start from 
scratch” (Richard Wright, author). They start from scratch unless they have 
flood insurance. In federally designated flood areas, flood insurance is 
required. If even a remote chance exists that your area may flood, having 
flood insurance is prudent.
foreclosure: Foreclosure is the legal process in which the mortgage lender 
takes possession of and sells the property to attempt to satisfy indebtedness. 
When you default on a mortgage and the lender deems that you’re incapable 
of making payments, you may lose your house to foreclosure. Being in 
default, however, doesn’t necessarily lead to foreclosure. Some lenders are 
lenient and help you work out a solution if they see that your problems are 
temporary. Foreclosure is traumatic for the homeowner and expensive for 
the lender.
formula: We’re not talking about baby food here. In real estate lingo, the 
formula is how you calculate the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage. 
Add the margin to the index to get the interest rate (margin + index = 
interest rate).
Freddie Mac: See Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
graduated-payment mortgage: A rare bird these days, the graduated-payment 
mortgage gives you the opportunity to cut your total interest costs. With a 
graduated-payment mortgage, your monthly payments are increased by 
a predetermined formula (for example, a 3 percent increase each year for 

363
 Appendix C: Glossary
seven years, after which time payments no longer fluctuate). If you expect to 
land a job that may allow you to make these higher payments, you may want 
to consider this option.
home equity loan: Home equity loan is technical jargon for what used to be 
called a second mortgage. With this type of loan, you borrow against the 
equity in your house. If used wisely, a home equity loan can help people pay 
off high-interest consumer debt, which is usually at a higher interest rate than 
a home equity loan and isn’t tax-deductible; or a home equity loan can be 
used for other short-term needs, such as payments on a remodeling project.
home warranty plan: A home warranty plan is a type of insurance that 
covers repairs to specific parts of the home for a predetermined time 
period. Because home warranty plans typically cover small-potato items, 
such plans aren’t worth buying. Instead, spend your money on a good 
house inspection before you buy the home to identify any major problems 
(electrical, plumbing, or structural).
homeowners insurance: Required and necessary. No ifs, ands, or buts about 
it — you need “dwelling coverage” that can cover the cost to rebuild your 
house. The liability insurance portion of this policy protects you against 
accidents that occur on your property. Another essential piece is the per-
sonal property coverage that pays to replace your lost worldly possessions 
and usually totals 50 to 75 percent of the dwelling coverage. Finally, get 
flood insurance or earthquake insurance if you’re in an area susceptible to 
these natural disasters. As with other types of insurance, get the highest 
deductibles with which you’re comfortable.
house inspection: Like homeowners insurance, we think that a house inspec-
tion is a necessity. The following should be inspected: overall condition of 
the property, inside and out; electrical, heating, and plumbing systems; 
foundation; roof; pest control and dry rot; and seismic/slide risk. A good 
house inspection can save you money by locating problems. With the inspec-
tion report in hand, you can ask the seller to either do repairs or reduce the 
purchase price. Hire your own inspector. Never be satisfied with a seller’s 
inspection reports.
hybrid loans: Combining the features of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mort-
gages is the objective of hybrid loans. The initial interest rate for a hybrid loan 
may stay the same for the first three to ten years of the loan (as opposed to 
only six to twelve months for a standard adjustable-rate mortgage); then the 
interest rate adjusts biannually or annually. Remember that the longer the 
interest holds at the same initial rate, the higher the interest rate will be. 
These hybrid loans are best for people who plan to own their house for a 
short time (fewer than ten years) and who don’t like the volatility of a typical 
adjustable-rate mortgage.

364
Par t VI: Appendixes 
index: The index is the measure of the overall level of interest rates that 
the lender uses as a reference to calculate the specific interest rate on an 
adjustable-rate loan. The index plus the margin is the formula for determining 
the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage. One index used on some 
mortgages is the six-month Treasury bill. If the going rate for these Treasury 
bills is 5.5 percent and the margin is 2.5 percent, your interest rate would be 
8 percent. Other common indexes used are certificates of deposit index, 11th 
District Cost of Funds index, and LIBOR index.
interest rate: Interest is what lenders charge you to use their money. Lenders 
generally charge higher rates of interest on higher-risk loans. For fixed-rate 
mortgages, remember that the interest rate has a seesaw relationship with the 
points. A high number of points is usually associated with a lower interest 
rate, and vice versa. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, make sure that you 
understand the formula (the index plus the margin) that determines how the 
interest rate is calculated after the teaser rate expires.
interest-only mortgage: A mortgage that in its early years has the borrower 
making only interest payments. Typically a number of years after it starts, the 
payment jumps significantly as the borrower begins to make principal and 
interest payments.
investment property: Real estate is a good long-term investment — it has 
produced returns similar to those from diversified stock portfolios over the 
years. In practice, investment in real estate is different from investment in 
stocks. You can also leverage your real estate investment — that is, you can 
make a profit on your investment as well as on borrowed money. Investing 
in real estate is time-intensive (although investing in stocks can be, too, if 
you don’t use a professional money manager). You also need to be adept at 
managing people and money if you’re to bear fruit with real estate invest-
ments. One drawback of investment property is that you can’t shelter your 
investment-property profits in a retirement account the way you can shelter 
profits earned through stock investments.
joint tenancy: Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership that gives each tenant 
equal interest and rights in the property, including the right of survivorship. 
At the death of one joint tenant, ownership automatically transfers to the 
surviving joint tenant. This form of ownership is most appropriate for 
unmarried people in a long-term relationship. Some of the limitations of joint 
tenancy are, first, that each person must own an equal share of the house 
and, second, the right of survivorship terminates if one person transfers his 
deed from joint tenancy to tenancy-in-common.
late charge: A late charge is a fee that’s charged if a mortgage payment is 
received late. A late charge can be steep — as much as 5 percent of the 
mortgage payment amount. Ouch! Get those payments in on time!

 Appendix C: Glossary
lease-option agreement: A lease-option agreement is a special contract used 
for a property that you can lease with an option to purchase at a later date. 
These contracts usually require an upfront payment (called “option consider-
ation”) to secure the purchase option. The consideration is usually credited 
toward your down payment when you exercise your option to buy the home. 
An important factor in a lease-option agreement is what portion of the 
monthly rent payments (typically, one-third) is applied toward the purchase 
price if you buy. You’ll usually pay a slightly higher rent because of the 
lease-option privilege.
leverage: Leverage refers to exerting great influence with little effort. 
Buying a house allows you to leverage your cash in two ways. Suppose that 
you make a 20 percent down payment on a $100,000 house — thus investing 
$20,000. The first leverage is that you control a $100,000 property with 
$20,000. If your house appreciates to a value of $120,000, you’ve made 
a $20,000 profit on a $20,000 investment — a 100 percent return thanks 
to leveraging. However, leverage works both ways, so if your house 
depreciates . . . .
lien: A lien is a legal claim against a property for the purpose of securing pay-
ment for work performed and money owed on account of loans, judgments, 
or claims. Liens are encumbrances, and they need to be paid off before a 
property can be sold or title can be transferred to a subsequent buyer. The 
liens that exist on a property for sale appear in a property’s preliminary title 
report.
life cap: The life cap determines the total amount that your adjustable-rate 
mortgage interest rate and monthly payment can fluctuate up or down during 
the loan’s duration. The life cap is different from the periodic cap, which 
limits the extent to which your interest rate can change up or down in any 
one adjustment period.
liquidated damages: In most real estate contracts, buyers and sellers may 
agree at the beginning of the transaction regarding how much money one 
party, usually the seller, would receive if the other party were to violate 
the terms of the contract without good cause. Liquidated damages confine 
and define how much money the injured party may recover. Buyers, for 
example, generally limit their losses to the amount of their deposit. Discuss 
the advisability of using the liquidated damages provision with a lawyer or 
real estate agent.
lock-in: A lock-in is a mortgage lender’s commitment and written agreement 
to guarantee a specified interest rate to the home buyer, provided that the 
loan closes within a set period of time. The lock-in also usually specifies 
the number of points to be paid at closing. Most lenders won’t lock in your 
mortgage interest rate unless you’ve made an offer on the property and the 
property has been appraised. For the privilege of locking in the rate in 
advance of the loan closing, you may pay a slight interest-rate premium.

366
Par t VI: Appendixes 
margin: The margin is the amount that’s added to the index to calculate your 
interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Most loans have margins around 
2.5 percent. Unlike the index (which constantly moves up and down), the 
margin never changes over the life of the loan.
mediation of disputes: Mediation of disputes is a fast, inexpensive way to 
resolve simple contract disputes. In mediation, buyers and sellers present 
their differences to a neutral mediator who doesn’t have the power to impose 
a settlement on either party. Instead, the mediator helps buyers and sellers 
work together to reach a mutually acceptable solution of their differences. 
It’s probably in your best interest to mediate your problem before going to 
an arbitrator or suing in a court of law (also see arbitration of disputes).
mortgage broker: A mortgage broker is a person who can help you find a 
mortgage. Mortgage brokers buy mortgages wholesale from lenders and then 
mark the mortgages up (typically, from 0.5 to 1 percent) and sell them to 
buyers. A good mortgage broker is most helpful for people who won’t shop 
around on their own for a mortgage, or for people who have blemishes on 
their credit report.
mortgage life insurance: Mortgage life insurance guarantees that the lender 
will receive its money in the event that you meet an untimely demise. Many 
people may try to convince you that you need this insurance to protect your 
dependents and loved ones. We recommend that you don’t waste your time 
or money with this insurance! Mortgage life insurance is expensive. If you 
need life insurance, buy low-cost, high-quality term life insurance rather than 
mortgage life insurance.
Multiple Listing Service: A Multiple Listing Service (or MLS) is a real estate 
agents’ cooperative service that contains descriptions of most of the houses 
that are for sale. Real estate agents use this computer-based service to keep 
up with properties listed for sale by members of the Multiple Listing Service 
in their area.
negative amortization: Although it may sound like science-fiction jargon, 
negative amortization occurs when your outstanding mortgage balance 
increases despite the fact that you’re making the required monthly pay-
ments. Negative amortization occurs with adjustable-rate mortgages that 
cap the increase in your monthly payment but don’t cap the interest rate. 
Therefore, your monthly payments don’t cover all the interest that you 
actually owe. If you’ve ever watched your credit card balance snowball as 
you make only the minimum monthly payment, you already have experience 
with this phenomenon. Avoid loans with this feature!
origination fee: See points.

367
 Appendix C: Glossary
partnership: A partnership is a way for unmarried people to take title of a 
property. Partnerships most often occur among people who have a business 
relationship and who buy the property as either a business asset or for 
investment purposes. If you intend to buy property with partners, have a real 
estate lawyer prepare a written partnership agreement for all the partners to 
sign before making an offer to purchase.
periodic cap: This cap limits the amount that the interest rate of an 
adjustable-rate mortgage can change up or down in one adjustment period. 
See also caps.
points: Also known as a loan’s origination fee, points are interest charges 
paid upfront when you close on your loan. Points are actually a percentage of 
your total loan amount (one point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount). 
For a $100,000 loan, one point costs you $1,000. Generally speaking, the more 
points that a loan has, the lower its interest rate should be. All the points that 
you pay on a purchase mortgage are deductible in the year that you pay 
them. If you refinance your mortgage, however, the points that you pay at the 
time you refinance must be amortized over the life of the loan. If you get a 
30-year mortgage when you refinance, for example, you can deduct only one-
thirtieth of the points on your taxes each year.
prepayment penalty: One advantage of most mortgages is that you can make 
additional payments to pay the loan off faster if you have the inclination 
and the money to do so. A prepayment penalty discourages you from doing 
this by penalizing you for early payments. Some states prohibit lenders from 
penalizing people who prepay their loans. Avoid mortgages that penalize 
prepayment!
principal: The principal is the amount that you borrow for a loan. If you 
borrow $100,000, your principal is $100,000. Each monthly mortgage payment 
consists of a portion of principal that must be repaid, plus the interest that 
the lender is charging you for use of the money. During the early years of 
your mortgage, your loan payment is primarily interest.
private mortgage insurance (PMI): If your down payment is less than 20 
percent of your home’s purchase price, you’ll likely need to purchase 
private mortgage insurance (also known as “mortgage default insurance”). The 
smaller the down payment, the more likely a home buyer is to default on a 
loan. Private mortgage insurance can add hundreds of dollars per year to 
your loan costs. After the equity in your property increases to 20 percent, you 
no longer need the insurance. Don’t confuse this insurance with mortgage life 
insurance.

368
Par t VI: Appendixes 
probate sale: A probate sale is the sale of a home that occurs when a home-
owner dies and the property is to be divided among inheritors or sold to pay 
debts. The executor of the estate organizes the probate sale, and a probate-
court judge oversees the process. The highest bidder receives the property.
property tax: You have to pay property tax on the home you own. Annually, 
property tax averages 1 to 2 percent of a home’s value, but property tax rates 
vary widely throughout this great land.
prorations: Certain items such as property taxes and homeowners-association 
dues are continuing expenses that must be prorated (distributed) between 
the buyers and sellers at close of escrow. If the buyers, for example, owe the 
sellers money for property taxes that the sellers paid in advance, the pro-
rated amount of money due the sellers at close of escrow appears as a debit 
(charge) to the buyers and a credit to the sellers.
real estate agent: A real estate agent is the worker bee of real estate sales. 
Also called “salespeople,” agents are supervised by a real estate broker. The 
state licenses agents; their pay is typically based totally on commissions 
generated by selling property.
real estate investment trust (REIT): A real estate investment trust is like a 
mutual fund of real estate investments. Such trusts invest in a collection of 
properties (from shopping centers to apartment buildings). REITs trade on 
the major stock exchanges. If you want to invest in real estate while avoiding 
the hassles inherent in owning property, real estate investment trusts may 
be the right choice for you.
Realtor: A Realtor is a real estate agent, or broker, who belongs to the National 
Association of Realtors, a trade association whose members agree to its ways 
of doing business and code of ethics. The National Association of Realtors 
offers its members seminars and courses that deal with real estate topics.
refinance: Refinance, or “re-fi,” is a fancy word for taking out a new mortgage 
loan (usually at a lower interest rate) to pay off an existing mortgage (gener-
ally at a higher interest rate). Refinancing is not automatic; neither is 
refinancing guaranteed. Refinancing can also be a hassle and expensive. 
Carefully weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing.
return on investment: The return on investment is the percentage of profit 
that you make on an investment. If you put $1,000 into an investment and 
one year later your account is worth $1,100, you’ve made a profit of $100. 
Your return is the profit ($100) divided by the initial investment ($1,000) — 
10 percent. See also leverage.

369
 Appendix C: Glossary
reverse mortgage: A reverse mortgage enables elderly homeowners, typically 
those who are low on cash, to tap into their home’s equity without selling 
their home or moving from it. Specifically, a lending institution makes a 
check out to you each month, and you can use the check as you want. This 
money is really a loan against the value of your home; because the money 
that you receive is a loan, the money is tax-free when you receive it. The 
downside of these loans is that they deplete your equity in your estate, 
the fees and interest rates tend to be on the high side, and some require 
repayment within a certain number of years.
second mortgage: A second mortgage is a mortgage that ranks after a first 
mortgage in priority of recording. In the event of a foreclosure, the proceeds 
from the home’s sale go toward paying off the loans in the order in which 
they were recorded. You can have a third (or even a fourth) mortgage, but 
the farther down the line the mortgage is, the higher the risk of default on the 
mortgage — hence, the higher interest rate that you’ll pay on the mortgage. 
See also home equity loan.
72-hour clause: The 72-hour clause, also called a release clause, is commonly 
inserted into real estate purchase offers when the purchase of a home is 
contingent upon the sale of the buyer’s current house. The seller accepts 
the buyer’s offer but reserves the right to accept a better offer if one should 
happen to come along. However, the seller can’t do this arbitrarily. If the 
seller receives an offer that he wants to accept, he must notify the buyer 
of that fact in writing. Then the buyer usually has 72 hours (though the 
allotted amount of time can vary) from the seller’s notification to remove the 
contingency-of-sale clause and move on with the purchase; otherwise, the 
buyer’s offer is wiped out.
shared-equity transaction: In a shared-equity transaction, a private investor 
contributes money toward the purchase of a house and subsequently shares 
equity as a co-owner. When the house is sold, the investor takes a share 
of the profit or loss. These shared-equity transactions can become fairly com-
plicated because the investor co-owner and the resident co-owner may have 
conflicts of interest. For example, the investor co-owner may want to sell the 
property to make a profit, but the resident co-owner may want to stay put. If 
you intend to participate in an equity-sharing transaction, have a lawyer who 
works with residential real estate partnerships prepare a written partnership 
agreement for all parties to sign prior to purchasing the property.
short sale: Done with a property in default, to keep it from foreclosure. The 
lender agrees to accept the proceeds from selling the property as fully 
satisfying outstanding debt, even though the amount of that debt exceeds 
the sale proceeds.

370
Par t VI: Appendixes 
tax-deductible: Tax-deductible refers to payments that you may deduct 
against your federal and state taxable income. The interest portion of your 
mortgage payments, loan points, and property taxes are tax-deductible; your 
employment income is not!
teaser rate: Otherwise known as the initial interest rate, the teaser rate is the 
attractively low interest rate that most adjustable-rate mortgages start with. 
Don’t be sucked into a mortgage because it has a low teaser rate. Look at 
the mortgage’s formula (index + margin = interest rate) for a more reliable 
method of estimating the loan’s future interest rate — the interest rate that 
will apply after the loan is “fully indexed.”
tenancy-in-common: Tenancy-in-common is probably the best way for 
unmarried co-owners to take title to a home (except for those unmarried 
co-owners who are involved in close, long-term relationships — see joint 
tenancy). Co-owners don’t need to own equal shares of the property they 
hold as a tenancy-in-common. A tenancy-in-common also doesn’t provide for 
the right of survivorship that automatically passes the deceased partner’s 
ownership to the survivor without probate sale. The deceased’s share of the 
property involved in a tenancy-in-common passes to the person named to 
receive that share of the property in the deceased’s will or living trust.
title insurance: Title insurance covers the legal fees and expenses necessary 
to defend your title against claims that may be made against your ownership 
of the property. The extent of your coverage depends on whether you have 
an owner’s standard coverage or extended coverage title insurance policy. 
To get a mortgage, you also have to buy a lender’s title insurance policy to 
protect your lender against title risks.
top producers: People remark that 20 percent of all real estate agents account 
for 80 percent of all real estate sales. Be cautious. Why are those agents top 
producers? Some agents get to the top by being pushy and selling a great deal 
of property without patiently educating buyers — not the kind of agent that 
you want! If, however, the agent is a top producer because she works hard to 
meet the needs of her clients, being a top producer is a good thing.
townhouses: Townhouse is the decorative name for a row (or attached) 
home. Townhouses are cheaper than single-family homes because they use 
common walls and roofs, thus saving land. In terms of investment apprecia-
tion potential, townhouses lie somewhere between single-family homes and 
condominiums.
VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) loan: Congress passed the Service-
man’s Readjustment Act, commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights, in 1944. 
One of its provisions enables the VA to help veterans and eligible people 
on active duty obtain mortgages on favorable terms (generally, 0.5 to 1 
percent below the interest rate currently being charged on conventional 
loans) to buy primary residences. Like the FHA, the VA has no money of its 
own. It guarantees loans granted by conventional lending institutions that 
participate in VA mortgage programs.
