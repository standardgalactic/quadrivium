Logic: Language and Information 1
§1-1-4 Formalisation
Greg Restall

Formalisation
If we want to use logic to assess sentences of natural
language we need to translate from sentences of English
to formulas in our propositional language.
If we do that, we identify forms our propositions have.
This is formalisation.

Three Steps
1. Identify the Connectives.
2. Create a Dictionary.
3. Find the Form.

Identify the Connectives
Morgan can’t do advanced logic
unless he’s mastered connectives.

Identify the Connectives
Morgan can’t do advanced logic
unless he’s mastered connectives.
Miggles will be fed if Clancy is home.

Identify the Connectives
Morgan can’t do advanced logic
unless he’s mastered connectives.
Miggles will be fed if Clancy is home.
Miggles will be fed only if Clancy is home
and there’s food in the house.

Create a Dictionary and Find the Form
Morgan can’t do advanced logic unless
he’s mastered connectives.

Another Example

Another Example

Another Example
(You don’t ﬁnish Game of Thrones) ⊃(I can’t read Game of Thrones)

Another Example
∼(You ﬁnish Game of Thrones) ⊃(I can’t read Game of Thrones)

Another Example
∼(You ﬁnish Game of Thrones) ⊃(I can’t read Game of Thrones)

Another Example
∼(You ﬁnish Game of Thrones) ⊃∼(I can read Game of Thrones)

Another Example
∼(You ﬁnish Game of Thrones) ⊃∼(I can read Game of Thrones)
dictionary
f = You ﬁnish Game of Thrones
r = I can read Game of Thrones

Another Example
∼(You ﬁnish Game of Thrones) ⊃∼(I can read Game of Thrones)
∼f ⊃∼r
dictionary
f = You ﬁnish Game of Thrones
r = I can read Game of Thrones

Exercise: Formalising
Which of the following three sentences is the best match the form
(s ⊃(l ∨w))?
1. If you strike this match it will light, unless it is wet.
2. If you strike this match, either it will light or it’s wet.
3. This match will light if you strike it, unless it is wet.
dictionary:
▶s = you strike this match.
▶l = this match will light.
▶w = this match is wet.
