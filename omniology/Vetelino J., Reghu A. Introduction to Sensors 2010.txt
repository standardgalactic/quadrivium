Preface
This book came about as a result of a need to present fundamental
material to undergraduate and graduate engineering and science
students in the general area of sensors. The initial funding for the
development of the book came from a National Science Foundation
(NSF) grant relating to the integration of emerging technologies such
as sensors into engineering and science curricula. Coincident with the
NSF grant, sensors became an area of critical need fueled by terrorist
actions such as 9/11, national defense, and the health and security of
the general public. A course entitled âIntroduction to Sensorsâ was
then introduced, and course notes were developed and distributed to
students taking the course.
The first chapter introduces students to the fundamentals of sensors
independent of the underlying technology. Terms such as sensor
signature, receiver operating characteristics, and the specific sensor
properties are defined and discussed. The human body and the
automobile are treated as entities that utilize a multiplicity of sensors.
Finally, a complete sensor system that includes the preparation
phase, the sensing element and platform, and appropriate electronics

resulting in a digital readout is presented.
In the second chapter solid-state electronic sensors whose response
relates to electricity and chemistry are presented. The major focus of
this chapter is the metal oxide semiconducting sensor commonly
referred to as the Taguchi sensor. A brief overview of energy band
theory as applied to a metal oxide film is presented. The gas-film
redox reactions are discussed relative to gas sensing by the film along
with the effect of film structure, dopant, and temperature on the sensor
response. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of solid-state
electronic sensors such as the metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)
capacitor, the micromachined capacitive polymer, and the Schottky
diode sensors.
The third chapter is devoted to piezoelectric sensors. The basic theory
associated with piezoelectricity is described using the two-
dimensional hexagonal lattice as an example. The fundamental
relationship between stress, strain, electric field, and electric
displacement is presented for both nonpiezoelectric and piezoelectric
crystals. An in-depth design of a passive piezoelectric force/pressure
sensor is presented with specific applications given. The principle of
operation of an accelerometer is presented along with specific
applications. The chapter concludes with material relating to active
piezoelectric sensors. In particular, the standard quartz crystal monitor
(QCM) is discussed along with the lateral field excited (LFE) acoustic
wave sensor developed at the University of Maine. Specific
advantages and disadvantages of the QCM and LFE sensors are
discussed along with specific sensor applications. Finally, a brief
discussion of the surface acoustic wave sensor is presented.

Preface

The last three chapters relate to thermal, fiber optic, and magnetic
sensors.
A brief discussion of the theory underlying each sensor technology is
presented followed by specific sensor applications. Relative to thermal
sensors, both the resistive thermal device (RTD) and thermistor are
discussed. The fiber optic sensor is presented with specific
applications such as embedded sensors. The magnetic sensors
presented are used to determine measurands such as the magnetic
field and semiconductor properties such as carrier concentration and
mobility.

Introduction
1.1 Background
Sensors dominate the world in which we live. We are awakened in the
morning by an alarm clock and proceed to breakfast in our home,
which has smoke detectors. Our breakfast is often prepared with the
aid of timing devices, and temperature sensors tell us when the food is
ready to eat. We then proceed to go to work in our automobile, which
may have more than 50 different sensors helping in the operation and
control of the vehicle. At our workplace we are surrounded by sensors
that can be very simple, such as temperature and humidity sensors.
Other workplace sensors are quite complex, such as sensors to detect
potential explosives, metal objects, etc. If our work requires travel,
then we encounter a wide spectrum of sensors in the detection of a
variety of objects that may be on our person or in a suitcase.
In addition to sensors relating directly to the individual, a whole list of
sensors exist on local, state, national, and global levels. For example,
traffic signals in your town are often controlled by sensors. At the state
level, a variety of sensors help us in terms of waste management and
water quality. Sensors are present at a national level and are critical to
the security of our homeland. On a global level, sensors exist to
measure quantities such as ozone and pollutants that may be present
in international waters.
In recent years, the complexity of advancing technology, the ever-
increasing world population, and the emergence of terrorist-related
activities have heightened the need for new types of sensors.
Depending upon the particular application, the design, fabrication,
testing, and eventual use of the sensors requires a wide variety of
both technical and nontechnical expertise. As a result, sensors have
become an emerging technology that prevails in the world in which we
live.

Introduction to Sensors
1.2 The Human Body as a Sensor System The human body serves
as one of the best examples of a complex system that contains a wide
variety of sensors capable of sensitively and selectively detecting a
wide variety of quantities or measurands.
The most familiar sensors in the human body are those that relate to
vision, hearing, smell, taste, and feel.
The human eye can detect both small and large objects that may be
sta-tionary or in motion. The eye may also detect very subtle
variations in color or shape. A classic example of this is the
recognition of a human face. The recognition of a familiar face in a
large crowd truly emphasizes the selectivity embodied in the vision
system. The human vision system does, however, have a finite
dynamic range, which is determined by the visible part of the
electromagnetic spectrum, namely, from wavelengths of 4,100 Ã
(violet) to 6,600 Ã (red). This represents a frequency range from 7.32 Ã
1014 cycles per second (cps) to 4.55 Ã 1014 cps. Considering that the
electromagnetic spectrum has a range of over 1020 cps, visible light
represents a very small part of the spectrum.
The human ear is an example of a very sensitive sensor with a limited
dynamic range. In particular, the ear is capable of detecting sound
levels as low as 10â12 Watts/m2 (0 db) and as high as 1 W/m2 (120
db), which is the threshold of pain. The frequency range for the ear is
limited to 20 Hz to 20 kHz. This represents only a small portion of the
sound wave spectrum, which covers a range of over 1013 Hz. It is well
known that prolonged exposure to high-intensity sound levels may
produce serious ear damage. In fact, noise pollution may contribute to

anxiety, nervousness, and high blood pressure. Some typical sound
level intensities are given in Table 1.1. Prolonged Table 1.1

exposure to sound levels over 90 db is considered to be dangerous
and ear protection is recommended. This clearly points out the need
for sound intensity sensors, particularly in an industrial environment.
The human nose represents perhaps one of the most sensitive and
selective sensors in the human body. The nose is capable of
differentiating subtle differences in odor such as may occur in different
types of wine. The nose can also detect various degrees of
âfreshnessâ that may occur in fish.
The limits of sensitivity of the nose are in the low parts per billion (ppb)
to the parts per million (ppm) level in air for a target gas. This
sensitivity level is better than that of many of the best commercially
available gas sensors.
Taste is not as sensitive or selective as the other familiar body
sensors.
Although differences in levels of sweetness, sourness, and saltiness
can be detected in taste, people often confuse taste with odor. The
true measure of the taste sensor may be experienced if one has a
cold. In this case, the interference from odor is eliminated.
The so-called feel sensor is usually associated with the hand, but can
in fact be located anywhere in the body. This sensor enables one to
determine such physical features as an objectâs size, shape,
roughness, and weight. In recent years advances in robotics have

resulted in the design and fabrication of artificial feel sensors, such as
robotic arms, hands, and fingers, which have found widespread
applications in industry.
In addition to the five common body sensors, other abstract sensors
exist in the human body that can affect the individual in a variety of
different ways. For example, the death of a loved one evokes a feeling
of sadness in an individual. Danger often evokes excitement, and
overcoming an obstacle may evoke pleasure or satisfaction.
Finally, the human body has a built-in defense or immune system that
is often triggered by sensors different from those already discussed.
For example, the invasion of the human body by antigens associated
with a particular disease or infection triggers the formation of
antibodies, which then fight the disease or infection.
The sensors within the human body, particularly the five principal
sensors, can be looked upon as real-time control systems. It is
essential that these control systems communicate accurately and
effectively so the human body can avoid dangers and perform
satisfactorily. Ideally, we would like our sensors to respond quickly,
sensitively, and selectively to a particular measurand. However, with a
degradation in sensor operating accuracy or function caused by
factors such as misuse, age, or disease, it is then necessary to make
certain modifications to restore the sensor performance.

For example, deteriorating eyesight or hearing can be corrected with
use of glasses or hearing aids. These corrective measures then
simply appear in the feedback loop of the real-time control system
associated with the sensor.

Introduction to Sensors
1.3 Sensors in an Automobile
In a real-world system, such as an automobile, the ability of an
electronic control system to communicate accurately and effectively to
the automobile operator is critical to the operation of the automobile.
Since the automobile has to be operating in concert with an outside
world of significant complexity, the need for reliable, effective, and
accurate sensors is extremely high.
In order to appreciate the need, diversity, and complexity of sensors
required in an automobile, it is interesting to briefly examine the
systems in an automobile in which sensors are used. In Figure 1.1,
several potential areas of the automobile in which sensors are used
are highlighted. It can be seen that the sensor functions may range
from a simple sensing of oil pressure, water temperature, and fuel
level to the intensive control of the engine and transmission to
optimize economy and performance while minimizing potentially
dangerous emission effluents. In order to appreciate the exacting
specification and complexity of some automobile sensors, it is
interesting to examine the sensors appropriate for the engine and
transmission, or what is commonly referred to as the power train.
Various power train sensors and their required specifications are
presented in Table 1.2. These sensors are critical to the automobile
performance and relate to engine Electronic display instrument cluster

timing, manifold vacuum pressure and mass airflow, exhaust gas
oxygen level, transmission control valve position, transmission input
and output speed, and throttle and accelerator position. It can be seen
that the requirements for parameters such as accuracy and operating
temperature range are exacting. In addition to meeting technical
specifications, these sensors must also meet space and weight
requirements and be of minimal cost and high reliability. To discuss
each of the power train sensors in detail requires background in such
diverse areas as physics, chemistry, engineering, economics, and
politics.
The multidisciplinary nature of sensors can best be illustrated by
describing the development of gas sensors relating to the control of
the combustion mixtures in car engines. The goal of these sensors is
to decrease atmospheric pollution while increasing fuel economy. The
initiative in developing the combustion control gas sensors was
prompted by a political decision. In the early 1970s the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States legislated the Clean Air
Act, which required automobile manufacturers to reduce exhaust
gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (CH x) and
oxides of nitrogen (NO x) by about 90%.
This requirement had to be satisfied by cars manufactured after the
1976
models. Several approaches were tried to satisfy this regulation. The
initial approaches, which tried to optimize the fuel supply and the
ignition system, were not successful. The second approach involved

converting the polluting gases into inert species. This was done using
thermal reactors and catalytic converters. The objective was to oxidize
CO and CH x and reduce NO x.
This was achieved by recycling NO x through the engine. The
economic impact of this approach was negative in that it increased
automobile production costs significantly and the fuel economy
decreased.
Material problems relating to the difficulties encountered in disposing
of reliable and inexpensive refractory materials in thermal reactors
caused the industry to look toward catalytic converters. The approach
using catalytic converters solves the oxidation of CO and CH x and
reduces NO x to transform all polluting constituents into harmless
byproducts. However, the three-way catalytic converter is effective
only if the engine is fed with near-stoichiometric air/fuel (A/F) mixtures.
A stoichiometric A/F mixture is one in which the combustion of the
gasoline is ideal. Too much air results in a lean mixture, while too
much gasoline results in a rich mixture. This A/F mixture requirement
thus created an immediate market for an A/F sensor and appropriate
feedback control. Since the A/F sensor lifetime was projected to be
about 30,000 automobile miles and the U.S. car production was
several tens of million each year, a great sensor market was realized.
The A/F sensor currently in use is based upon a zirconia oxygen
sensor. This type of sensor has been used in the past for sensing the

partial pressure of oxygen in a gas. These sensors are basically
galvanic cells and

Introduction to Sensors
consist of a closed tube of calcia or yttria stabilized zirconia (CSZ or
YSZ).
The tube is covered on both sides with electrodes (normally platinum).
Since CSZ and YSZ are ionic conductors of oxygen, when the two
sides of the tube are exposed to different oxygen pressures a voltage
appears between the electrodes. If one side of the tube is exposed to
air for which the oxygen partial pressure is known, the partial pressure
of the other side can be obtained by measuring the voltage across the
cell. The output of the galvanic cell is fed to a signal conditioning
block, which then controls the fuel metering system so as to maintain
a stoichiometric A/F mixture. A block diagram of the complete system
currently being used to meet EPA regulations is shown in Figure 1.2.
The description of the evolution of the A/F sensor clearly illustrates the
many disciplines that determine the need for sensors and influence
their design and manufacturing. In the case of the A/F sensor, the
initial motivation was environmental, namely, a concern for air quality.
This concern resulted in the Clean Air Act, which was political. Then
science and engineering entered the picture in the approaches used
to transform polluting constituents into inert byproducts. Both
approaches had to be studied carefully to minimize economic-related
factors such as cost and fuel economy.
Material problems relating to waste disposal eliminated one approach.
Principles of electrical engineering, physics, mechanical engineering,
and chemistry were then used to realize the zirconia oxygen sensor
and the signal conditioner.

Similar scenarios can be given for the development of other sensors.
For example, in automated control of industrial operations ranging
from fabrication of integrated circuits to the assembly of automobiles,
a wide variety of chemical and physical sensors are used. In medicine,
sensors are used in the detection and control of a wide range of
potentially life-threatening diseases. Sensors also find use in studies
dealing with plants, animals, and the environment.

1.4 Classification of Sensors
Due to the multitude of sensors that may exist, at first glance it may
appear to be a formidable task to classify sensors in some logical
fashion. One possible way to classify sensors may be according to
their evolution. Inevitably, the design, fabrication, and utilization of a
sensor are driven by a need. For example, in the case of the A/F
sensor for the automobile, the need was dictated by EPA via the Clean
Air Act. Sensors in various manufacturing processes may be driven by
the need to increase production or decrease cost.
A particular biosensor may be driven by the need to rapidly detect a
life-threatening disease. A possible evolutionary process associated
with the development of a sensor is shown in Figure 1.3.
Although it is impossible to list all the potential needs that may result in
the development of a particular sensor, the needs may be grouped
into the various areas shown in Table 1.3.
The measurand either is identified concurrently with the need or
results as a consequence of the need. For example, in the study of
ozone depletion, which falls into the area of environment, the
measurand is obviously ozone.
On the other hand, in the need dictated by the Clean Air Act, namely,

reduce automobile exhaust gases such as CO, CH x, and NO x by
90%, the measurand is not obvious. However, in attempting to satisfy
this need, the identification of a sensor to maintain a stoichiometric
A/F mixture in engine combustion resulted. Various groups of
measurands possible and examples of particular measurands for
which a sensor is required are presented in Table 1.4.
Once the measurand has been identified, the next step in the
evolutionary scale is to identify the sensor appropriate to the
measurand. The realization of the sensor can be thought of as the
two-step process shown in Figure 1.4.
The measurand must undergo a biological, chemical, or physical
interaction in order that the measurand may be converted to an entity
suitable for creating a sensor output. Possible types of measurand
interactions are presented in Table 1.5.
Once the measurand interaction has taken place, a means of
detecting this interaction must be identified. Often the nature of the
interaction will define the detection means. In other cases, the means
of detection will be entirely different than the nature of the interaction.
Examples of various means of detection are given in Table 1.6.

Concurrent with the identification of the measurand interaction and
means of detection is the identification of the material(s) used in the
sensor. The candidate materials for a sensor cover a very wide range
and are presented in Table 1.7.
1.5 Example of a Gas Sensor: The Taguchi Sensor In order to
understand and appreciate the steps one must undertake in the
realization of a sensor, it is useful to consider an example. The
Taguchi sensor [3] is probably one of the most famous gas sensors
currently available.

This sensor is shown in Figure 1.5. The measurand, which is a gas,
interacts with a doped semiconducting metal oxide film such as SnO2,
changing the resistance or conductivity of the film. The resistance of
the film, R s, then becomes an indicator of the gas concentration. The
equivalent circuit for the sensor is shown in Figure 1.6. By measuring
the direct current (DC) in the circuit, which is determined by R s for a
fixed R and V, one is able to deduce the gas concentration.

Introduction to Sensors
The need for this sensor is driven by the desire to determine the
concentration of a particular target gas (measurand). Depending upon
the dopant in the SnO2 film and the temperature of the heater, this
type of sensor can detect a wide variety of target gases. The
appropriate area of application for this sensor is the environment. The
measurand reacts chemically with the doped SnO2 film; therefore, the
measurand interaction is chemical. Since the current is monitored to
detect the measurand, the means of detection is electrical. The sensor
materials used in this sensor include the metal electrodes (Al or Au),
the wire (Cu or Pb), the selective film (doped SnO2), the substrate on
which the film is deposited (ceramic alumina), and the heater
(tungsten or nichrome).

1.6 The Sensor as a Passive or Active Element The sensor itself
may be a passive or an active device. In a passive sensor, the actual
sensor doesnât have an external signal applied to it.
For example, in the galvanic cell used as an A/F sensor, two sides of
the zirconia tube are exposed to different oxygen pressures, which
creates a voltage. When the oxygen pressure is known on one side,
one can deduce from the voltage the oxygen pressure on the other
side. Another example of a passive sensor is the thermocouple. In this
device, the thermoelectric effect plays the major role. In particular,
current flow is initiated by virtue of a temperature difference across the
device. In an active sensor the sensor has an external signal applied
to it. For example, in the case of the Taguchi sensor the external signal
is an electric current that is supplied by a voltage source (see Figure
1.5). The measurand then causes changes in the external signal that
are monitored.
Other active sensors include acoustic wave (AW) sensors and fiber
optic (FO) sensors. In an AW sensor, an acoustic wave is the external
signal, while in an FO sensor, it is an allowed electromagnetic mode of
propagation.
Inherent to both the passive and the active sensor is a sensing
element.
This is the entity that the measurand of interest interacts directly with.
In the case of the Taguchi sensor the sensing element is the SnO2
film, while in the A/F sensor the sensing element is either CSZ or YSZ.
A passive or an active sensor may also have several transducers. A
transducer is a structure that converts a signal from one form to
another. In a passive sensor, transducers are used to measure a
signal that is induced in a sensor by the measurand. The metal
electrodes at the end of the zirconia tube in the A/F sensor are

examples of passive transducers. In this case, ionic conductivity is
transformed to voltage. In an active sensor, transducers are used to
excite a signal in the sensor. For example, in the case of the Taguchi
sensor, the metal electrodes cause an electric current to flow through
Introduction
15
the doped SnO2 film. In AW and FO sensors, transducers are used to
excite acoustic modes and electromagnetic modes, respectively.
1.7 The Sensor as Part of a Measurement System The sensor is by
its nature either an active or passive device that serves as the heart of
a measurement system. The roles that a sensor may play in a
measurement system are best illustrated by the block diagrams
shown in Figures 1.7 and 1.8.

When the sensor is used in a stand-alone measuring device as shown
in Figure 1.7, the desired output is usually in the form of a digital
readout.
For example, in the case of the Taguchi sensor, the sensor is as
shown in Figure 1.5 and the signal conditioner is used to translate a
measured current to a digital readout.
If the sensor is used in optimizing the performance of a particular
system as shown in Figure 1.8, it is one element of a larger system. In
this case the sensor output is fed to an appropriate signal conditioner,
which modifies the signal in a form suitable to interface to the
feedback control system.
This feedback control system then appropriately modifies one or more
sub-systems in the system under study so that an âoptimizedâ
measurand may Measurand

be produced. An example of the sensor being used to optimize the
performance of a system is the case of the A/F sensor in the
automobile (see Figure 1.2).
1.8 Sensor Properties
There are several properties associated with a sensor that are critical
to the sensor performance. Some of the more important properties are
listed in Table 1.8.
Several of the sensor properties can best be described by referring to
a sequence of typical sensor responses as shown in Figure 1.9. The
sensor response or signature that is associated with one of the means
of detection shown in Table 1.6 is plotted as a function of time. For
example, in the case of the Taguchi sensor the means of detection is
electric and the output variable, which is measured as the sensor
response, is the resistivity (resistance) or conductivity. In the case of
the A/F sensor discussed earlier the Table 1.8

means of detection is again electrical with the sensor response being
the voltage. In the AW sensor the means of detection is mechanical
and the sensor response that is measured may be the amplitude,
frequency, or velocity of the acoustic wave.
The response and recovery times are shown in Figure 1.9. The
response time is the time it takes the sensor to reach 90% of its
steady-state value after the introduction of the measurand. The
recovery time is the time that it takes the sensor to be within 10% of
the value it had before exposure to the measurand. Typically the
response times are much shorter than the recovery times. For
example, in a gas sensor a typical response time is of the order of a
minute or less, whereas the recovery time can be 30 minutes or
longer. The response time is basically the real time it takes for a
measurand to interact with the sensing element. For example, in the
Taguchi sensor it is the time it takes for the chemical reaction between
the target gas (measurand) and the film (sensing element) to occur.
The recovery time is longer and more involved than the response
time. Once the measurand has been removed from the sensor other
steps may have to be taken in order to return the sensor to its
equilibrium value. For example, in the Taguchi sensor the film needs to
be heated in order to induce a reversible chemical reaction to return
the film to its original state.
Reproducibility relates to the ability of the sensor to produce the
same signature upon repeated exposure to a particular measurand. A
sensor that exhibits excellent reproducibility would have the same
response and recovery time along with the same response level. After
repeated use of a sensor over a long period of time it is only natural to

expect some degradation in the sensor signature. This might be due
to the accumulation of trace impurities or imperfections in the sensing
element or the nature of the environment that the sensor must operate
in. This degradation, the time for which varies from one type of sensor
to another, is commonly referred to as aging.
The stability of a sensor can be deduced by examining the general
shape of the sensor signature. In the short term, one would like to
minimize or eliminate any drift, ripple, or sudden variations in a single
sensor response.
In other words, the sensor should respond in a well-behaved fashion,
as shown in Figure 1.9. Once the sensor has reached its saturation
value, it should maintain that value until the measurand has been
removed. In the long-term sensor signature parameters such as the
response time, saturation level and recovery time should be
reproducible from exposure to exposure of exactly the same
concentration of the measurand. Any significant system-atic or sudden
changes in signature parameters would indicate that the sensor is
becoming unstable in the long term.
Sensitivity and resolution are sensor properties that are extremely
critical when one is working with precise control systems or the
sensing of potentially dangerous measurands. Mathematically, the
sensitivity, S, of a sensor is

defined as the slope of the dose-response curve, which is the sensor
response vs. the measurand concentration curve. Ideally, one would
like to have the sensitivity be a constant over the dynamic range of the
sensor. This would imply a linear dose-response curve.
The lower limit of sensitivity is determined by the minimum amount of
measurand capable of producing a measurable response.
Resolution is how accurately one can measure the measurand
concentration and relates directly to the error associated with the
experimental measurement. It is important to realize that the minimum
measurable amount of measurand, or lower limit of sensitivity, may in
fact not be equivalent to the sensitivity. This is due to the fact that the
measurand response may not vary linearly with measurand
concentration. As an example, consider the nonlinear variation of the
sensor response ( Xr) with the measurand concentration ( C) shown in
Figure 1.10. It is obvious in this case that the sensitivity increases with
the measurand concentration.
Obviously in designing a sensor, one should try to obtain a response
that is linear with concentration, or at least operate the sensor in the
linear region of the dose-response curve.
The sensorâs dynamic range is defined as the range of measurand
values for which a sensor response occurs. Ideally, this dynamic

range should be associated with the measurand concentration range
for which the variation of the sensor response, Xr with concentration C
is linear. In this case, the signal conditioner design and
implementation is straightforward. The dynamic range, however, could
extend to regions where the Xr vs. C variation is nonlinear, in which
case the corresponding signal conditioner would be more complex.
The dynamic range can best be illustrated by referring to the example
of an Xr vs. C variation, given in Figure 1.11.
For the example shown in Figure 1.11, specific sensor response
regions may be defined as follows:

The sensitivity parameter, S, may be used when evaluating a single
sensor or comparing the performance of several sensors. In the single
sensor case often the sensor response will vary depending upon
sensor operating conditions. For example, in the case of the Taguchi
sensor, the sensor response is strongly temperature dependent.
Therefore, it is necessary to operate the sensor at a single
temperature that is maintained by adding a heater to the sensor. This
single temperature is normally the temperature for which S is
maximum.
Another very important sensor property is selectivity. Ideally, the
sensor should respond only to the measurand of interest and not
respond to any other measurand. If a sensor responds to measurands
other than the target, then various signal processing techniques need
to be employed in the signal conditioner in order to eliminate nontarget
measurand signals.
In the design of the signal conditioner the sensor signature is an
important input parameter. A sensor may respond to a wide variety of
measurands, but the signature for each measurand may be uniquely

different. The signal conditioner could range from a very simple signal
processing scheme, such as threshold detection, to a more complex
scheme, such as one employing neural networks.
Three other properties also need to be considered in the realization of
a sensor: namely, size, weight, and cost. The location of a sensor,
either isolated or within another system, determines the limits on the
size and
20
Introduction to Sensors
weight of the sensor. For example, sensors associated with spacecraft
and guided missiles have very small size and weight limitations.
Finally, the question of economics or cost needs to be addressed. This
is often dependent on the scope and need for the sensor. For
example, in the case of A/F
sensors in the automobile, the number of sensors required is
extremely large; therefore producing the cheapest sensor becomes a
driving force.
In the case of an application relating to monitoring the concentration of
hydrogen in the rockets of a spacecraft, the need is essential and cost
is of secondary concern.
It is important to realize that the particular sensor application
determines which sensor property is the most important. In the
detection of very highly toxic gas, sensitivity becomes one of the most
important sensor properties. In applications where the sensor must
respond numerous times to a measurand such as in âon-lineâ control
systems, properties such as reproducibility and aging become
paramount. In applications relating to the implantation of biosensors in
humans or animals, weight and size become very important
properties.

1.9 Historical Development of Sensors One of the earliest sensors
known to mankind is the compass, which was commonplace even
before Roman times. The compass basically consists of a magnetic
material, such as iron, which, when constructed as a thin needle and
allowed to rotate, will constantly point in a
northerly direction. Early travel-ers and explorers on land and sea
relied on the compass for navigation.
In more recent times, the need for sensors relative to safety became
recognized. For example, in early mining operations it was necessary
to be aware of potentially dangerous gases such as methane and
hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Miners resorted to the use of creatures such
as canaries and cats to detect these gases. An indication of the
presence of potentially dangerous gases occurred when the canary or
the cat died. This is particularly interesting in the case of H2S, a
dangerous gas that is denser than air. Miners, when approaching a
section of a mine that might have H2S gas present, often examined
this area with one or more cats. Since the higher concentrations of
H2S were located near the mine floor, the cats were the first to react to
this gas. If the cat behaved strangely or died, the miner knew that he
had only a short time to vacate the area.
In the early 1900s rapid advancement in technology prompted the
development of various types of sensors. This is illustrated in Table
1.9, where the history of the development of some important chemical
sensors is outlined.
The disciplines involved in the development of a particular sensor can
cover a wide range. For example, in the area of biosensors one can
have microbiologists, medical doctors, chemists, physicists, or
engineers working

on a single sensor. Often there is little or no collaboration between
different investigators, and hence sensor development has not
proceeded in a cohesive fashion but rather a haphazard fashion. This
is best illustrated by following the development of the Taguchi gas

sensor. The idea that a sorbed gas can affect the electrical properties
of a material was first pointed out by Bardeen [4] in the late 1940s.
However, it was not until 1962 [5] that a deliberate effort was made to
use this phenomenon in gas sensing. The first gas sensor, which did
not appear until 1968, was the result of a tremendous amount of work
by Naoyoshi Taguchi. When Taguchi started his work he had no
knowledge of gas absorption or even metal oxide semiconductors.
His motivation for the development of the gas sensor was triggered by
a liquefied petroleum gas explosion in Japan that killed 10 people.
Taguchi worked 7 days a week and holidays for 2,000 days (over 6
years) developing the Taguchi gas sensor. He went from the
beginning to the end of the periodic table before he finally settled on

SnO2 as the sensing element. He made an average 20 samples a day
resulting in roughly 40,000 samples.
After developing the commercial product [3], Taguchi had to fight
other, much larger companies in the marketplace. Finally, Taguchi
succeeded and formed Figaro Engineering, which is the leading
producer of gas sensors in the world today.
Obviously a better, more efficient and focused way to develop a gas
sensor would be to form a research team comprised of people with
different
22
Introduction to Sensors
backgrounds working in a coordinated fashion. Unfortunately, this has
not been the case in the area of gas sensors. Investigators have either
performed excruciating searches for a particular sensing element or
stumbled upon one by accident. Also, when a sensing element was
identified, in many cases, the microscopic and macroscopic behavior
of the sensing element was not understood. For example, in the case
of the detection of H2S gas (target measurand) by tungsten trioxide
(WO3) (sensing element) commercial sensors have been available [6]
since the mid-1970s. However, only recently has microscopic and
macroscopic work [7, 8] been done to understand the operation of
these sensors and optimize their performance.
Even though sensor technology has evolved in a rather random
fashion, the advances in materia1s and microfabrication technology
have had a positive effect on sensors. This is illustrated in Figure 1.12,
where an old methane gas sensor, the Davey lamp, is compared to
two examples of modern gas sensors, a Taguchi sensor and a sensor
developed in Great Britain. Microprocessor technology has also had a
positive influence in the interfacing of the sensor with the real world

via the signal conditioner and also interfacing the sensor to a control
system.
An ideal procedure for the research and development of a prototype
sensor is summarized in Figure 1.13.
Once a need has been identified, a research team comprising of
researchers in different disciplines should be formed. Working
together and using Figure 1.12

1.10 Sensor System
The exact definition of a sensor is often interpreted differently
depending upon the context in which it is used. Perhaps it is best
viewed as the sensor system shown schematically in Figure 1.14. The

system consists of three distinct components: (1) sample preparation,
(2) sensing element, and (3) sensor electronics.
The sample preparation phase of a sensor system is a very critical
component of the system. Often dangerous target measurands such
as bacteria, viruses, or pathogens may occur in minute
concentrations. For example, in the case of a toxic gas, small volumes
of the gas may not be sufficient to result in detection by the sensing
element. Rapid and efficient pumping units in which a large volume of
gas is collected and sampled are necessary.
The sample is then delivered usually with appropriate mass flow
control-lers and appropriate tubing to a prefiltering component. This

provides the first level of selectivity to the sensor system. In particular,
the primary function of this component is to filter those gaseous
components that may result in false alarms. The filtering may be done
using micron to nanoscale structures or molecular sieves such as
zeolites to eliminate potential interferents. Once the prefiltering is
accomplished, the filtered gaseous sample is then delivered to the
sensing element(s). In the case of bacteria, a very low concentration is
often present and the bacteria need to be incubated so that a
sufficient concentration of bacteria is presented to the sensing
element(s).
The sensing elements, which may be a single element or an array of
elements, typically consist of a measurand selective film and a
sensing platform. The purpose of the selective film is to sorb the target
measurand.
Once this takes place, mechanical and electrical property changes
occur in the film. This may include changes in mass, elasticity,
viscosity, conductivity, or dielectric constant. The sensing platform is
the entity upon which the measurand selective film is deposited.
Typically it consists of a substance on which the film may be attached
and an appropriate metallic electrode configuration deposited. Popular
sensing elements examined to date include the acoustic wave and
metal oxide semiconductor platforms.

In the case of the former, an acoustic wave is excited in a piezoelectric
material and the frequency of the acoustic wave changes as the
electric and mechanical properties of the measurand selective film
change. In the case of the latter, the platform is an insulator, which
may be single crystal or amorphous. Once the sensing elements have
responded to the target measurand(s) and the output has been
transduced into an electrical signal (frequency, resistance, or
impedance), the signals must then be processed. This component can
be eliminated if there is only one sensing element and the sensing film
is selective to only the target measurand.
However, in reality this seldom occurs and one must employ multiple

sensing elements and intelligently monitor the sensing element output.
This is usually done using pattern recognition and neural network
techniques. Finally, a digital readout indicates the presence (absence)
and concentration level of the target measurand. This component
would contain the necessary signal processing and conditioning to
convert the analog signal to a digital output that can be easily read by
the end user.
Clearly the exact structure of the sensor system is dependent on the
types of sensing elements used. Although certain components, such
as the sample collection, delivery, and prefiltering, are independent of
the sensing element, processing of the sensor element output, and
signal conditioning are sensing element dependent.

Electrochemical Sensors

2.1 Background
Electrochemical sensors form a group of very important sensors
whose response is a result of an interaction between electricity and
chemistryâ
hence the nomenclature electrochemical sensors. Basically, the
electrochemical sensors can be divided into three general types:
conductimetric, potentiometric, and amperometric. The
conductimetric sensors are those whose response relates to the
measurement of electrical resistance, impedance, or admittance. The
potentiometric sensor response relates to the measurement of
voltage, while the amperometric sensor response relates to the
measurement of electrical current. These sensors basically respond to
a chemical environment. This chemical environment may include a
measurand, which may be in a liquid, gas, or solid phase. Typical
measurands may include chemical species such as gases (O2, CO,
CO2, H2S, NO, NO2, etc.), protons (pH), humidity, or biological
quantities such as glucose, cho-lesterol, enzymes, antibodies,
proteins, etc. It is interesting to note that since there are a large
number of biological applications for these sensors in humans,
animals, and plants, these sensors are often referred to as bio-
electrochemical sensors by researchers working in the fields of
biology and medicine.

Work in the area of electrochemical sensors has been ongoing for
almost 100
years. One of the earliest works relates to the use of oxygen-ion-
conducting solid electrolytes as fuel and concentration cells. However,
the advent of microfabrication technology along with rapid
improvements in materials technology in the last 40 years has resulted
in the movement of sensors from the macro to the micro domain.
Amperometric sensors such as the air/fuel (A/F) sensor in the
automobile, conductimetric sensors such as the Taguchi sensor, and
potentiometric sensors such as the chemical field effect transistor
(CHEMFET) are examples of microsensors. Through the cooperative
efforts of engineers and scientists, further breakthroughs in reducing
not only the size but also the cost of electrochemical sensors may be
expected in the future.

Introduction to Sensors
2.2 Conductimetric Sensors
Conductimetric sensors basically consist of an electrically insulating
element, such as a sensing platform, upon which one deposits a
sensing semiconducting film or metal and metal electrodes. This type
of sensor is an active sensor and requires an excitation source such
as a direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) voltage to cause
current to flow in the sensing element. The measurand interacts with
the sensing film and causes changes in the sensing element
resistance (DC case) or impedance (AC case). Several configurations
have been used to model the conductiometric sensor. Basically these
configurations are of the type shown in Figure 2.1.
In the more general case of an AC excitation the sensor can be
electrically modeled as an impedance, z(Ï), whose value can be

determined by the following relation:
v( )
z(Ï
Ï
) =
(2.1)
I(Ï)
where v(Ï) = voltage between the electrodes, and I(Ï) = current
through the sensor.
When the sensor is exposed to a measurand (normally a gas), the
sensing elementâs impedance changes, and this change is directly
related to the concentration of the measurand. A general equivalent
circuit for the conductimetric sensor is shown in Figure 2.2.
One can clearly see that the equivalent circuit for the conductimetric
sensors is a rather complex arrangement of capacitors and resistors.
The significant interaction, of course, should occur between the
sensing element and the measurand, and hence the circuit elements,
Cs and Rs, should be the focus of attention. However, one must be
aware of the effect of the other elements.
If the effects are significant, means to account for them must be
explored. In Top view

this case, hermetically sealing the electrode or substrate from the
measurand should reduce the effect of some of the circuit elements.
The electrodes used in conductimetric sensors are metals. Hence, the
type of contacts that one must consider depends upon the nature of
the sensing film. For conducting sensing films the two possible types
of contacts are metal-conductor and metal-insulating oxide-conductor.
In the case of the former, the contact is ohmic, and hence the contact
resistance is zero. In the second case, an oxide layer impedes the
flow of current and presents a potential barrier, as shown in Figure 2.3.
This may result in a tunneling current at the junction.
The tunneling current is given by the Fowler Nordheim equation [1],
which is a nonlinear current vs. voltage relationship in which the
corresponding contact resistance depends upon the barrier height and
width

Introduction to Sensors
in a complicated fashion. If aluminum is used as the contact metal, a
nonlinear contact resistance results. This is due to the fact that
aluminum is prone to oxidize. If, however, one uses noble metals such
as gold, platinum, or palladium, the contact can be prepared oxide-
free. However, in this case, one must realize that noble metals are far
more costly than aluminum.
In the case of semiconducting sensing films, again two types of
contacts arise: a metal-semiconductor and metal-insulating oxide-
semiconductor.
The metal-semiconductor junction is the familiar Schottky barrier,
where the current may be a nonlinear function of the voltage. The
contact resistance associated with this junction is given by the
following relation [1]: k

where h = Planckâs constant, and m = electron mass.
In the case where the contact metal is not a noble metal, an oxide
layer appears between the metal and semiconductor. The current-
voltage relationship is then given by the following equation [1]:

In some cases the current transport is not due to electrons or holes,
but rather ions. In this case an electrochemical reaction will take place
at the contact and the mass transport of the electroactive ions must be
considered.
The contact resistance then becomes a strong nonlinear function of
the measurand concentration.

Electrochemical Sensors
31
The previous discussion has been restricted to the DC case. However,
in the AC case one must consider the capacitors in the equivalent
circuit. Since capacitance is related to charge distribution and
dielectric constant, any accumulation of charge at the contact will give
rise to capacitive effects that must be considered.
In the DC case, the value of the resistance of the sensing element
depends upon whether the layer is a semiconductor or a conductor. If
the layer is a semiconductor, the contact resistance is lower than the
selective layer resistance and can be either used to modulate the
overall sensor resistance or neglected. The resistance of the layer can
be expressed in terms of the layer conductivity, Ï, or resistivity, â, as
follows:
R =
= â
(2.5)
ÏA
A
where â = length of the layer between the electrodes, and A = layer
cross-sectional area.
The layer conductivity depends upon the concentration ( n and p) and
mobility (Î¼n and Î¼p) of the electrons and holes, respectively, in the
semiconductor layer, as follows:
Î¼ = q( n Î¼ n + p Î¼ p)
(2.6)

As the target gas interacts with the layer it will modify the carrier
concentrations and mobilities accordingly. The conductivity will either
increase or decrease depending on the nature of the reaction between
the measurand and layer. In the case where the sensing layer is a
conductor, the contact resistance is larger than the layer resistance
before exposure to the measurand. However, after exposure to the
measurand, the layer resistance increases quickly and soon exceeds
the contact resistance. Obviously for this case, the contact resistance
cannot be neglected and needs to be properly accounted for.
At first glance, it may appear that the conductimetric sensors are
reasonably simple and their support electronics is not complicated.
However, most conductimetric sensors are treated only
macroscopically. Therefore, the relationship between the output signal
and measurand concentration is given without a complete
understanding of the microscopic behavior. The microscopic
understanding is determined to a large extent by the understanding of
the measurand-layer interaction. In the case of the metal oxide
semiconductor layer, the understanding of the microscopic
interactions is fair at best, while for biological layers very little is known
about the measurand-layer interaction.
Depending upon the type of sensing film and whether the impedance
measurement is a DC or AC type, conductimetric sensors can be
divided into four groups.
32
Introduction to Sensors
The first group is called the semiconductor metal oxide sensors.
The sensing film is a metal oxide semiconductor and the

measurement is DC. The most famous of the semiconductor metal
oxide sensors is the Taguchi sensor.
The second group of conductimetric sensors is called the
chemiresistors. The sensing film in this case may be inorganic
conductor or organic semiconductor, and the measurement is DC.
The third group is called a conductor sensor. The sensing film in
this case is an electrical conductor.
The fourth and final conductimetric type sensor is called a
dielec-trometer or capacitor sensor. It differs from the other
conductimetric sensors in that it uses an AC signal and, in many
cases, the sensing film is an electrical insulator. In this case, the
change in sensing layer capacitance is monitored upon exposure to
the measurand.
2.3 Semiconducting Metal Oxide Sensors 2.3.1 background
Since the early work of Bardeen [2] in the late 1940s, it has been well
known that the adsorption of a foreign species such as gas on a
semiconductor can create surface states. These states can modify [3â
10] the carrier concentrations in a semiconductor, causing a change in
the semiconductorâs resistivity or conductivity. This so-called active
surface created problems with early work on semiconductors and
several investigations were made to pacify the surface.
The first deliberate effort to use the active surface on the
semiconductor as a gas sensor appeared in 1962. Seiyama et al. [11]
monitored the change in the conductivity of ZnO films when they were
exposed to gases such as CO2, benzene, ethyl alcohol, and oxygen.
For the first three gases the conductivity increased, since these gases
behaved as electron donors, while in the case of oxygen the
conductivity decreased, which leads one to conclude that oxygen

behaves as an electron acceptor. In a follow-up paper, Seiyama and
Kagawa [12] further examined the characteristics of this detector.
They also performed measurements on a host of other
semiconducting films, such as Cr2O3, TiO2, CuO, and SnO2.
Although there has been some work [13] on organic semiconductors
and elemental or semimetal semiconductors, the most popular
semiconductors are the metal oxide variety. Among the metal oxide
semiconductors, the one that has received the most attention has
been SnO2. This resulted in the development of the so-called Taguchi
gas sensor (TGS) [14].
Electrochemical Sensors
33
Since the sensing element of the TGS is a SnO2 film, a large amount
of work has been done on SnO2. The physical and electrical
properties of SnO2 films have been examined in detail by Jarzebski
and Martin [15]. Other studies have been concerned with the effect
various gases have on the SnO2 film.
In particular, the gases most frequently studied [16â36] included CO,
H2O
vapor, propane, H2, NOx, O2, H2S, ethanol, C3H8, CO2, methane,
SO2, and benzene. Several of these studies were directed toward
obtaining a physically realistic and practically useful gas sensor.
Properties studied included film durability, sensor size, weight and
portability, sensitivity, recovery time, response time, stability,
selectivity, and reproducibility. In particular, the sensor recovery times
for pure undoped SnO2 films were observed [30] to be in excess of 10
minutes, while the addition of a gold dopant caused the recovery time
to decrease to less than 3 minutes. Similarly, sensitization of the

surface by adding dopants such as Nb, V, Ti, Mo, Au, Pt, ThO2, Pb, or
Sb2O3
[17,18,24,27,28,30] decreased the sensor response time significantly.
Also, the selectivity of the sensor could be improved by heating the
film in environments such as SO2 [32]. By varying the operating
temperature of the sensor, it was shown [32] that the sensor response
to certain gases was maximum at a particular temperature. This
information could be used in the design of a selective sensor. Finally,
it has been pointed out by Vetelino and coworkers
[37,38] that heat treating the film was found to stabilize the film,
decrease the response time, and increase the sensitivity.
Although there have been numerous papers reporting the
characteristics of SnO2 and other semiconductor metal oxide-based
sensors, much less work has been devoted to a complete
understanding or modeling of what is actually taking place in the film.
This is a little surprising when one realizes that as early as the 1950s
[3] it was observed that the resistance of semiconductors is sensitive
to the sorption of gases. The fact that semiconductor sensors exhibit
hysteresis and are sensitive to large numbers of gases has
contributed in part to the lack of a complete understanding of the
physical or chemical processes taking place in the film. The form of
the gas interactions with semiconductor surfaces has been grouped
into four types [39]: (1) reduction/
oxidation (redox) of the semiconductor, (2) ion exchange, (3)
adsorption, and (4) surface states. The interactions present when
SnO2 is the film of interest cover all four types. For example, Pink et
al. [26] suggested a redox type reaction is involved in the sensitivity of
their SnO2 film to hydrocarbons. The H2S

sensor based on SnO2 has been suggested [39] to be an ion
exchange case. The simple adsorption case seems to be the most
popular for semiconducting oxide sensors. If the adsorbing gas is a
reducing agent, it injects electrons into the semiconductor, and if it is
an oxidizing agent, it extracts electrons from the semiconductor. An
example of the latter is the NOx-based SnO2 sensor
[19]. Finally, the creation of a surface state case has been suggested
[16,23,26]
to be the primary mechanism in some of the Taguchi sensors.
The above work seems to suggest that the appropriate microscopic
theoretical description is dependent upon what type of gas is
interacting with
34
Introduction to Sensors
SnO2. Clearly, there is a need for a good understanding of all the
physical and chemical processes involved in SnO2-based sensors.
In addition to SnO2 there has been work on other semiconducting
metal oxide films for sensor applications. These films include ZnO
[11,12,23,31,32,40], TiO2 [13,35,39], WO3 [37,38], Co3O4 [13], CeO2
[32], Mn2O3 [32], Cr2O3 [12,32], CuO [12], and Ag2O [39]. Clearly next
to SnO2 the most work has been done on ZnO. In fact, the early work
on metal oxide semiconductor films for sensor applications was done
[11] on ZnO. Interest, however, turned away from ZnO
after the introduction of the TGS sensor. Recently, however, there has
been some interesting work [40,41] on ZnO in the polycrystalline,
single crystal, and compressed disc form. The most recent work [41]

indicates that ZnO
single crystal sensors have good long-term stability and are easy to
fabricate.
Recently there has also been some work done on WO3 [37,38] at the
University of Maine in order to try to optimize these films for gas
sensing applications.
The work on the other films is limited; however, there is reason to
believe that much work is unpublished due to proprietary reasons.
This is evidenced by the commercial WO3-based H2S detector
available from Detector Electronics Industries in Minneapolis [42].
Although the macroscopic theory of operation of the semiconducting
metal oxide sensor is straightforward, the microscopic theory is
involved and in many cases not understood. In order to formulate a
complete microscopic description, one must be able to completely
describe the role gas-film-ambient chemistry and film structure play in
determining film electrical properties. Some important questions that
need to be addressed include:
â¢ Why are certain films selectively sorbent to certain gases?
â¢ How can the sensitivity of a film be maximized?
â¢ What steps are necessary in film preparation to ensure both short-
and long-term stability in the sensor response?
â¢ How can the sensor response and recovery times be minimized?
â¢ What role do ambient air parameters such as humidity and
temperature play?
â¢ How can the reproducibility of sensor properties from sensor to
sensor be maintained?

Before attempting to answer these questions, the metal oxide
semiconductor electrical properties will be discussed.

The energy band diagram for an intrinsic semiconductor with the
Fermi-Dirac probability functions superimposed upon it is shown in
Figure 2.4. In an actual metal oxide semiconductor imperfections are
present, causing it to become extrinsic. The imperfections can be
either donors or acceptors. In the case of the former they donate
electrons to the semiconductor, causing it to become n-type, while in
the latter case holes are created, causing it to become p-type. The
energy band structure for the n- and p-type metal oxide
semiconductors and the appropriate location of the Fermi level are
shown in Figures 2.5 and 2.6. In contrast to silicon, which has an

energy gap of about 1 eV, metal oxide semiconductors have an
energy gap of about 3 eV.
The excess carriers have caused the Fermi level to be either slightly
below the conduction band ( n-type) or slightly above the valence
band ( p-type). The appropriate carrier concentrations can be obtained
by invoking charge neu-trality in the semiconductor and applying the
mass-action law.
Metal oxide semiconductors typically have an excess amount of
metal, which creates oxygen vacancies. The extra electrons
associated with the metal, which are normally bound to oxygen, are
loosely bound and readily enter the conduction band. The oxygen
vacancies are therefore said to act as donors. Metal ions located in
interstitial locations or acting as substitutional impurities for the host
metal ion can also donate electrons to the conduction band. However,
the predominant donor is the oxygen vacancies. It is therefore obvious
that metal oxide semiconductors are n-type.
To achieve p-type metal oxide one would have an excess of oxygen
present. The arguments as to why excess oxygen would produce

holes would parallel the discussion on why oxygen deficiencies
produce electrons.
However, to date there has been no consistent method to make p-type
metal oxides.

The conductivity of the metal oxide is given by Equation 2.6, where the
mobility of the carriers is defined as the drift velocity per unit electric
field.
As the carriers begin to move their motion is dominated by scattering
with lattice vibrations or phonons. Since lattice vibrations become
more vigorous with increasing temperature, the mobility decreases
with increasing temperature, T, according to the following relation: Âµ â

T 3/2
(2.7)
The carrier concentrations in metal oxides typically increase
exponentially with temperature. This increase is much greater than the

decrease in mobility with temperature. Hence, overall the conductivity
increases with increasing temperature. Examples of typical variations
of the conductivity, electron carrier concentrations, and mobility [43]
are given in Figures 2.7 to 2.9 for radio frequency (RF) sputtered
tungsten trioxide (WO3) films (500 Ã thick) on a LiNbO3 substrate.

2.3.2.2 Metal Oxide Surface
Since metal oxide semiconductors are used as films, it is important to
characterize the film surface due to the fact that the target measurand
interacts with the film at or near the film surface. The surface, even
though it has no contaminants or impurities, is still imperfect. In
particular, the geometry of the film is severely interrupted at the
surface. This can then lead to

which may occur in the energy gap. Since metal oxides are more ionic
than covalent in nature, the metal ion is referred to as the cation and
oxygen is the anion. The surface metal ions or cations are positively
charged, and hence tend to capture extra electrons and therefore act
as acceptors. On the other hand, the surface oxygen ions and anions
are negatively charged and therefore tend to give up their electrons
and act as donors. The band structure for the metal oxide
semiconductor surface prior to any charge motion is shown in Figure
2.10. In this case there is no net surface charge, and it is called the
flat-band case. The surface states are shown as narrow bands with
the donor states occupied and the acceptor states unoccupied. It is
interesting to point out that the donor and acceptor states form bands.
This is due to the fact that the oxide surface may contain different
crystal faces and surface discontinuities or steps.
Once the charges begin to move, the corresponding band structure
changes. Since the allowed energy level for the acceptor states is less
than the conduction band electron energy, the electrons from the
donor sites in the n-type metal oxide move down into the acceptor
states, creating partially occupied acceptor states. A so-called double
layer is then formed, which has positively charged donor ions in the

semiconductor and negatively charged surface acceptor states as a
sheet of charges on the surface. This double layer is shown in Figure
2.11.
The region 0 â¤ x â¤ x 0 is called the space charge layer or depletion
layer since it is depleted of mobile charges. The charge density in this

If a base voltage, V, is applied across the depletion region, the surface

2.3.2.4 Accumulation and Inversion Layer
In the previous discussion the majority of the carriers in the metal
oxide semiconductor were electrons and they migrated to the surface,
giving rise to a so-called double layer. This is the normal case for
semiconductor metal oxide sensors. There are, however, two other
cases. One relates to the situation when there is an excess of majority
carriers on the surface or an accumulation layer. The other case has
an excess of minority carriers on the surface or what is called an
inversion layer.
The accumulation layer is caused by occupied surface donor states
that are located near the conduction band of the semiconductor, as
shown in Figure 2.16. The donor electrons are injected into the
conduction band and an excess of electrons appear on and near the
surface, and positively ionized donor states appear near the surface.
A surface inversion layer is formed if the unoccupied surface acceptor
states are located near the top of the valence band, as shown in
Figure 2.17.
In this case, electrons move from the valence band to occupy surface
acceptor states. In this case, the surface has negatively charged
ionized acceptors, positively charged oxygen vacancy donors whose
electrons now occupy surface acceptor states, and holes. This is
called an inversion layer since it has

excess holes on the surface while the metal oxide is n-type. It is
interesting to point out that even though the majority of carriers in the
metal oxide semiconductor bulk are electrons, the positively charged
holes near the surface form a p-type channel. Holes then move
through this channel and increase the conductivity. This is in fact the
primary conducting channel in the silicon field effect transistor (FET).
2.3.2.5 Surface States and Surface Conductivity
Basically two types of conductivity can exist in the metal oxide
semiconductor, the bulk conductivity, which is given as

Electrochemical Sensors
45

(2.19)
and the surface conductivity, which is due to the surface states
located at the semiconductor metal oxide surface. The surface
conductivity, Ïs, may be defined as follows:
Ï =
s
qNsÂµ n
(2.20)

where N s = number of carriers per unit area on the semiconductor
metal oxide surface.
If one assumes a double-layer model as shown in Figure 2.11, N s
may be represented as follows:
Ns = NDt
(2.21)
where t = semiconducting metal oxide film thickness.
Therefore, using Equations 2.19 to 2.21, the following relationship
exists between surface and bulk conductivity:
Ï =

The semiconductor metal oxide can be modeled as shown in Figure

2.3.2.6 Metal Oxide Semiconductor Film Structure

therefore they are seldom used in actual metal oxide semiconducting

Introduction to Sensors
theory previously discussed can be extended in an attempt to
describe the electrical properties of the other film structures. Basically,
the semiconductor metal oxide film may occur in one or more of the
following forms: 1. Single crystal
2. Amorphous
3. Polycrystalline
4. Compressed powders
With the exception of the compressed powders, most films are
deposited using either vacuum evaporation or sputtering techniques.
Vacuum deposition does not offer a high degree of control in terms of
film deposition parameters. As a result, reproducibility is poor and it is
not uncommon for as deposited films to have conductivities that may
vary by several orders of magnitude. Sputter techniques, on the other
hand, offer a high degree of control in terms of deposition parameters,
resulting in better film reproducibility from deposition to deposition.
Sputtering parameters such as argon/oxygen mixture, RF or DC
power, and chamber pressure can be maintained very accurately. As
a result, sputtering is the preferred technique for film deposition.

Most metal oxide films are deposited at or near room temperature and
the film structure is amorphous. This structure is not ideal for sensing
applications. First, the structure is not stable, causing film properties to
change with time. Second, these films are prone to sorb and desorb
water significantly, which causes variations in film electrical properties.
Third, the film oxidation is not complete, which also causes electrical
properties to change with time.
Fortunately, these films can be stabilized to a reasonable extent by
heat treating the film. This process, which may be called curing, rids
the film of water, stabilizes the film structure, and hastens the
oxidation process. In regard to the film structure, the film undergoes
an amorphous-to- polycrystalline phase transition. This is clearly seen
by referring to Figure 2.19, which shows the variation of the
experimentally measured conductivity of WO3
as a function of inverse temperature [44]. At about 315Â°C a
discontinuity in the conductivity is observed, indicating the
amorphous-to-polycrystalline phase transition. This has also been
substantiated with transmission electron micrographs (TEMs).
Relative to oxidation, the as deposited films have oxygen vacancies
on the surface and the bulk. As the film is heated, the oxidation of the
film due to ambient oxygen accelerates and then stabilizes. The
stability of the film is clearly evidenced in Figure 2.20, where the
conductivity of cured and as deposited films are plotted as a function
of time [43].
In order to eliminate the curing process, it is also possible to sputter
deposit the metal oxide films at elevated temperatures. However, one
must be aware of the transition temperature between the amorphous
and polycrystalline phases since different metal oxides have different
transition temperatures.

Introduction to Sensors
Compressing powders of metal oxide semiconductors has been
another popular way of preparing films. The approach is rather simple
and does not require expensive equipment such as an RF sputtering
system. Despite the fact that the method is relatively crude, the
reproducibility of the filmâs electrical properties is reasonably good.
Many sensors available on the market have in fact been prepared in
this fashion.
Surface processes dominate the film resistance in compressed
powders.
The resistance is due primarily to the intergranular boundaries where
the depletion layer is located. This is obvious by referring to Figure
2.21 [45]. The single grain can be thought of as being equivalent to a
small single crystal. It is interesting to note that the reproducibility in
the compressed powders is problematic. Also, it is seen that the grain
boundary increases the film resistance. This is also observed in
polycrystalline films (see Figure 2.19) where the conductivity
decreases or film resistance increases as the film becomes
polycrystalline.
Since the intergranular boundaries appear in both compressed
powders and polycrystalline films, it is worthwhile to examine these
boundaries more closely. Typical crystallites that appear in a
compressed powder or a polycrystalline sample are shown in Figure
2.22. Since the depletion region and the associated double layer, as
shown in Figure 2.11, normally occur in n-type metal oxide
semiconductors, the surface of the crystallites 7

is negatively charged with partially occupied surface acceptor states
due to the surface metal ions. The charge region space is depleted of
mobile carriers, and hence most of the resistance appears at the
depletion region and at the intercrystallite boundaries. Also shown in
Figure 2.22 is the appropriate energy band structure. It is clearly seen
that the electrons must overcome the potential barrier and the
intercrystallite potential, qV b, in order to move from one crystallite to
another. The intercrystallite potential is due to the fact that neighboring
crystallites have different crystallographic orientations, and hence
different energy band structures. In addition to the films occurring in
single crystal, amorphous, polycrystalline, and powder form, they can
also exist in a state that may be a combination of two or more of the
above forms. Two common forms are the sintered and calcinated
forms.
In the former, heat is applied to the constituent materials to help fuse
the material together. In the latter case, the constituent materials are
also heated in air, but a significant chemical reaction takes place. In
particular, in the calcination process metals are used and transformed
into oxides via oxidation. Sintered and calcinated film normally consist
of either a single metal oxide or a combination of several metal oxides
and other materials and are referred to as a ceramic.
Sintered and calcinated films have a physical structure that is a
combination of the single crystal, polycrystalline, and powder forms.

Examples of two different structures that may be associated with
these films are shown in Figure 2.23.
The conductivity or resistance of these necks is strongly dependent on
the neck cross-sectional area. In the two-dimensional illustration
shown in Figure 2.23, the dimension, d, will dictate whether the
conductance is crystalline type or intercrystallite type. Finally,
considering all the possible âneck sizes,â one can see that the
conduction process in these kinds of films may

be quite complex. Unfortunately, there is no consistent technique that
can be used in the preparation of the sintered and calcinated films that
can accurately control neck sizes.

Finally, one must note that the previous discussion related to film
structure and electron transport in one dimension (see Figure 2.22).
This, of course, does not occur in the real world. The film structure in
three dimensions is somewhat analogous to a boulder-strewn beach.
Electrons must navigate through the maze of three-dimensional
crystallites in order to go from one electrode to the other. To
characterize this transport process exactly is a formidable task.
2.3.2.7 Gas-Semiconductor Film Interactions
In order to try to understand the interaction between a sensing film
and a target gas, the processes occurring at the gasâsolid interface
need to be examined. These types of processes can include
interactions with the ambient atmospheric gases such as oxygen,
hydrogen, and water vapor and various target gases.
A gas can be adsorbed on a solid by either physisorption,
chemisorption, or ionosorption. In physisorption, the bonding is
considered to be weak, while in chemisorption the bonding is at least
2Â½ times greater. In ionosorption, no bonding occurs and the
adsorbate acts as a surface state capturing an electron or a hole. It is
therefore held to the surface by an electrostatic interaction. When the
physisorption or chemisorption processes take place, the surface
atoms in the film may move about and relocate themselves.
Bonds of the surface atom to the bulk atoms will break, and new
bonds will form with the adsorbing species. This will result in the
formation of a new surface phase. Using experimental spectroscopic
techniques, such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), one can
track the formation of this new phase.
Instead of trying to discuss the adsorption processes microscopically,
the present discussion will focus on the transferring of charge from the
conduction or valence band in the adsorbent (film) to the adsorbate

Electrochemical Sensors
51
(adsorbing species). This transfer of charge will ionize the adsorbate.
The rate of physisorption, chemisorption, or ionosorption of an
adsorbate is complex, particularly when one is considering the
formation of one or more monolayers of adsorbate with adsorbent. For
submonolayer coverages that normally occur in gas sensing, the rate
is proportional to the adsorbate pressure.
In physisorption, the force between the adsorbate and the adsorbent
is a dipole-dipole interaction. Basically, the molecule in the ambient
can be approximated to be a dipole. This adsorbate dipole can then
polarize or induce dipoles in the absorbent, resulting in a weak dipole-
dipole interaction.
The interactions inherent in chemisorption are much stronger.
Normally the adsorbate molecules will dissociate into atoms. These
atoms can then form surface and chemical bonds with the absorbent.
Ionosorption is very important in gas sensing, particularly as it relates
to oxygen. The ionosorbed oxygen basically exists in two forms, O â
2 and Oâ. These negatively
charged surface states augment the surface states discussed earlier
relative to the double-layer case encountered in metal oxide
semiconductors (see Figure 2.11). The surface states also provide the
majority of the surface charge, N s, and increase the surface barrier
potential. This in turn causes the high resistivity or low conductivity
normally encountered in metal oxide semiconductors.
The ionosorbed oxygen can be removed from the surface by reducing
agents. For example, if the surface is exposed to a hydrocarbon
(reducing agent) such as methane, one would obtain water and

carbon monoxide as byproducts. The surface potential barrier would
decrease and the conductivity would increase. The conductivity
increase would be directly related to the concentration of methane in
the ambient. Many gas sensors operate on this principle.
2.3.2.7.1 Effect of Adsorbed Gases on the Metal Oxide Electrical
Properties When gases adsorb on a semiconductor surface, two
major changes in the semiconductor film can occur. First, the electron
or hole density can change, and second, the height and width of the
barrier potential can either increase or decrease. Since the most
common ambient in which metal oxide sensors operate consists of air,
one must determine the effects that ambient air has on the film
properties. Ambient air basically consists of about 80%
nitrogen and 20% oxygen with trace amounts of other gases. It is
known experimentally that the film properties do not change when
exposed to a 100% nitrogen atmosphere. However, the same cannot
be said for oxygen. Further, since many sensing films are either
compressed powder or polycrystalline, they contain a large number of
potential barriers that electrons must either tunnel through or hop
over. Therefore, it is important to analyze in detail the effects adsorbed
oxygen has on the metal oxide film properties.

(2.25)
The ionosorbed entities are O â
2 and Oâ. Basically, either O2 from the ambi-
ent directly picks up an electron to form O â
2 , or O2 is broken into two oxy-
gens on the metal oxide surface and then attracts an electron from the
metal oxide bulk. The amount of oxygen adsorbed is directly
proportional to the oxygen pressure in the ambient.
One can obtain the amount of oxygen ionosorbed on the surface by
noting that gas sensors are operated in the ambient. This places limits
on the value of the barrier potential, which is usually between 0.5 and 1
V. Referring to Equations 2.15 and 2.21 one can see that density of
surface charged states is limited, and that the corresponding surface
coverage for oxygen is about 1011

to 1012 ions/cm2.
The intergranular or intercrystallite boundaries provide most of the
electrical resistance in compressed powder and polycrystalline films.
The resulting electrical current is controlled by the density of electrons,
N s, at the semiconductor surface, which is proportional to the barrier
potential, qV s (see Equations 2.15 and 2.21). In addition, one must
also contend with the intercrystallite potential barrier.
In metal oxide sensors two different scenarios can occur when a
target gas adsorbs on the sensor surface. The amount of ionsorbed
oxygen can either decrease or increase. In the case of the former the
individual barrier heights decrease. The target gas in this case is
referred to as a reducing agent, and the resulting target gas-film
interaction is called reduction. In the latter case the ionsorbed oxygen
concentration increases, causing a corresponding increase in the
barrier height. In this case the target gas is referred to as an oxidizing
agent and the resulting target gas-film interaction is called oxidation.

can be ignored. Examples of typical reducing agents include carbon,
carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane. The associated reactions

In the four cases presented it can be clearly seen that the amount of
ionsorbed oxygen is decreased, causing the barrier potential to
decrease and excess electrons to be produced. These two processes
cause the metal oxide film resistance to go down or the conductivity to
increase.

This is the basis of operation for many gas sensors [46]. The results of
a Taguchi sensor exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) are presented in
Figure 2.24 [47].

Examination of Equations 2.32 and 2.33 reveals that electrons in the
metal oxide are used to combine with oxygen to form ionsorbed Oâ.
This results in an overall decrease in free electrons and a
corresponding increase in the barrier potential height. As a result,
resistance increases and conductivity goes down.
Another interesting interaction that takes place in metal oxide
semiconductors is the interaction with hydrogen (H2). Contrary to
oxygen, which extracts electrons from the metal oxide, hydrogen
donates electrons. It can interact with the ionosorbed oxygen as
shown in Equation 2.30, or it can interact directly with the metal oxide,

When a large amount of hydrogen or hydrogen-bearing gases are
present, the surface can actually become positively charged, resulting
in the formation of an accumulation layer (see Figure 2.16).
In addition to interacting with reducing and oxidizing agents the metal
oxide can also interact with water. It is important to discuss this
situation since water vapor always occurs in the ambient atmosphere
when a sensor is operating. Also, H2O is produced in the interaction of
hydrogen and reducing agents such as methane (see Equations 2.30
and 2.31). In order to completely understand the interaction of H2O
with a metal oxide surface we must realize that water is a polar
molecule in which the hydrogen ions are separated by 105Â°, as shown
in Figure 2.25.
One also notices that the H2O molecule can be approximated as a
dipole.

There are basically two processes associated with water adsorption.
In the first process a hydroxylated surface is formed. In this process
the OHâ is attracted to the metal ion while the H+ ion or proton is
attracted to the oxide ions. This results in a net change of carrier
density in the oxide since it eliminates the Oâ ion from the surface
state. This hydroxylated surface is shown in Figure 2.26. The second
process involves the physisorption of water on the hydroxylated
surface. This can appear at the interface between grains or
polycrystallites in the metal oxide and will affect the resistance of the
metal oxide.
Heat treatments and operating the sensor at elevated temperatures
will minimize the effect of water. Normally, the physisorbed water can
be removed at low temperatures (~400Âº K); however, hydroxylated
water needs a temperature of about 700Âº K to be removed.
The final gas interaction with a semiconductor surface, which will be
discussed, relates to surface ion exchange. The previous interactions
that have been discussed relate to surface states, adsorption
(physisorption, chemisorption, and ionosorption), and reduction-
oxidation reactions. The surface ion exchange relates to the
replacement of atoms at the semiconductor oxide surface, which will
most likely affect metal oxide electrical properties. The surface ion
exchange interaction is not often seen in metal oxide gas sensors. It
has been suggested [48] that the hydrogen sulfide sensor that uses
tungsten trioxide as the metal oxide film operates on this basis. In
particular, it has been postulated that the lattice oxygen is replaced
with sulfur to form a tungsten disulfide (WS2) layer. This could result in
higher conductivity since WS2

is conductive. However, contributions due to hydrogen and water
vapor also play a role in the interaction and should be considered.
Also, the question of reversibility in responses would be difficult to
explain for anion exchange interaction.
2.3.2.7.2 Sensitivity and Selectivity As a result of the previous
discussion, it is obvious that the interesting gas-semiconductor film
interactions take place at the film surface and at the interfaces
between the grains or crystallites. These interactions modify the
barrier potential and carriers in the film, which in turn change the film
impedance.
The question of how one can impart sensitivity and selectivity to the
film has not been explored fully.
It has been pointed out earlier that sputtered films that have been heat
treated or cured offer advantages over films prepared by other
techniques.
Film parameters such as conductivity can be controlled to a
reasonable degree by carefully adjusting the sputtering parameters.

Curing the film was found to cause the film to become polycrystalline
and stabilize the filmâs electrical properties (see Figure 2.20).
Polycrystalline films are particularly attractive in gas sensing
applications since they have a large interface area between the
crystallites, therefore maximizing the gas-film interactions. In fact, one
can make an interesting comparison: the surface of a cured film is
more like the Rocky Mountains, whereas the surface of an as
deposited film is more like the Great Plains. Also, it has been shown
[44] in cured WO3 films that the response times to a target gas (H2S)
are shorter and the sensitivity is improved compared to an as
deposited WO3 film [43]. This is clearly seen by referring to Figure
2.27.

If the sensor is maintained at a constant temperature, this can have an
effect on the sensitivity and selectivity. The rate of reaction with a
particular target gas is temperature dependent. The case of the
reaction with a reducing or oxidizing agent serves as an excellent
example, since these reactions are often seen in sensors. If the
temperature is too low, the reaction is too slow to yield a high
sensitivity. If the temperature is too high, the reaction proceeds so
quickly that the concentration at the surface becomes diffusion limited,
and again the sensitivity is low. For example, in the case of a SnO2-
based sensor, the optimum temperature for methane is 450Â°C, while
for CO and C3H8
the corresponding temperatures are 200 and 350Â°C. Therefore, one
can use a single SnO2 sensor to selectively and sensitively detect

three different gases by simply operating the sensor at different
temperatures. The influence of temperature on sensitivity and
selectivity is also seen in the WO3-based H2S
and H2 sensor [43], as shown in Figure 2.28. In this case the optimum
temperature for H2S is 200Â°C, while for H2 it is about 240Â°C.
Perhaps one of the most interesting techniques used to impart
selectivity and decrease the response time is the use of a catalyst.
Noble metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), iridium
(Ir), rhodium (Rh), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) have been frequently
used in semiconductor metal oxide sensors. In order to completely
understand how to use catalysts in gas sensors, one should have a
complete understanding of catalysis. Even with this background it will
become clear that much more research needs to be done in order to
optimize the use of catalysts in gas sensing.
In order to understand the role of the catalyst in a gas sensor, a short
discussion of catalysis will be given. Before a reaction can be initiated,
a certain amount of energy called activation energy must be supplied.
For example, in the adsorption of a gas such as O2 in a gas sensor,
the O2 molecule must be dissociated as described in Equation 2.24
before it can react with another atom or molecule. In addition to the
dissociation of a molecule, other processes that may have to take
place before a reaction can appear on the sensor surface include
ionization or some intermediate reaction. The energy necessary to
initiate the reaction is usually in the form of thermal energy. This is
most commonly supplied by heat, light, or photons. The actual amount
of activation energy necessary to initiate the reaction depends upon
the reaction path. If a particular path requires a high activation energy,
the reaction rate will be low. However, if another path requires a lower
activation energy, the reaction rate will be faster.

Typically, a catalyst is added to a metal oxide semiconductor to speed
up a chemical reaction. Ideally, finely divided particles of the catalyst
should be added so that a large surface area is covered in the metal
oxide. The catalyst, although critical to the chemical reaction, does not
undergo any changes during the reaction. The catalyst can play two
important roles in the chemical reaction. First, it can concentrate the
reactants by adsorbing the appropriate gas molecules, and second, it
can provide a reaction path that requires a small amount of activation
energy. The second role is best illustrated by the

ppm H2 (humidity 20%). (From Smith, D. J., Study of the Sensitivity
and Selectivity of Tungsten Trioxide Films for Sensing Applications,
MS thesis, Electrical Engineering, University of Maine, 1992.) fact that
a metal catalyst such as platinum can rapidly dissociate a molecule
such as hydrogen into reactive H atoms. Once hydrogen is in this
form, the necessary activation energy required for a chemical reaction
is much less.
Without a catalyst present the required activation energy is much
higher since it first has to dissociate molecular hydrogen (H2) before
supplying the energy necessary for the chemical reaction to proceed.
In addition to increasing the rate of the chemical reaction, the catalyst
also plays an important role in selectivity. Certain catalysts will greatly
enhance the rate of some reactions and have little or no effect on
other reactions. This is particularly true for gold. In the case of gases

such as H2S and H2 a gold catalyst rapidly dissociates these gas
molecules as follows: H â

If oxygen-bearing gases such as CO and CO2 are exposed to gold,
little or no dissociation occurs. Platinum and palladium, however,

serve as excellent catalysts for many gases, a feature that is not
desirable for selectivity in a gas sensor.
In order to be effective in gas sensing applications, a catalyst has to
change the resistance of the semiconducting metal oxide. The catalyst
is basically deposited on the surface of the grains or crystallites in the
metal oxide semiconductor. Since the catalyst can concentrate the
reactants by adsorbing the appropriate gas molecules, one can see
that the rate of the chemical reactions on the catalyst will be high. This
is shown for the case of a reducing agent reacting with surface oxygen
in Figure 2.29. Since the products of the reactions will disappear into
the atmosphere, it is not clear as to how this will affect the metal oxide
semiconductor resistance. In fact, the catalyst may
âburnâ all of the reducing agent. This will have little or no effect on the
film resistance, and therefore the sensitivity of the sensor. Fortunately,
there are two techniques by which the catalyst can significantly affect
the metal oxide resistance. These techniques are called spillover and
Fermi energy control.
In spillover the metal catalyst dissociates the molecule and the atoms
spill over onto the semiconducting metal oxide surface, as shown in
Figure 2.30
for O2.
Similar dissociations can occur for hydrogen and other atmospheric
gases.

Figure 2.31
Finely distributed catalysis over two crystallites insuring that the
intercrystallite boundary is populated by the catalyst.
Note that the concentration of Oâ ions on the semiconductor surface
is critical to the reactions. Since high concentrations of Oâ means high
resistance and the reducing agent removes Oâ, one concludes that
the resistance decreases quickly with increasing concentrations of the
reducing agent. Obviously for the resistance to change, the spillover
oxygen and hydrogen atoms must be able to migrate to the
intercrystallite boundaries. This can be facilitated if the catalysis is
distributed finely over the crystallite surface as shown in Figure 2.31.
The fact that this occurs in a real metal oxide is dramatically shown in
Figures 2.32 and 2.33 for polycrystalline samples undoped and gold-

doped WO3 [44]. The small white dots in the gold-doped sample are
the finely divided gold particles.
The other way in which the catalyst can affect the metal oxide
resistance is by Fermi energy control. In this situation the oxygen that
is concentrated on the metal catalyst obtains its electrons from the
metal catalyst. The metal catalyst in turn removes electrons from the
metal oxide. If the deposited catalyst is in high concentration and other
surface adsorbates, such as charged oxygen on the metal oxide, can
be neglected, the catalyst controls the barrier potential. It is then clear
that the catalyst controls the flow of electrons from

work, not only must the concentration of the metal catalyst be high, but
catalyst particles should be finely dispersed, as shown in Figure 2.31.
Only then will intercrystallite resistance be affected. Typically the
catalyst separation should be less than the depletion width, or roughly
less than 500 Ã apart.
Often certain materials called promoters are added to metal oxide
semiconductors to help improve the selectivity or reactivity of the
catalyst. They typically influence the effect of the catalyst
microscopically and have an influence on valence states or
stoichiometry. Overall, little is understood on the exact role played by
promoters. Usually promoters are stumbled upon by trial and error.
2.4 Chemiresistors
If a conductimetric sensor uses a film other than a metal oxide
semiconductor, it is usually referred to as a chemiresistor. The films
that are typically used in the chemiresistor include organic films and
metallic films.

A common configuration for a chemiresistor with an organic

interdigital electrodes that are vacuum deposited on an insulating
substrate such as quartz or alumina. The film is usually deposited
using solvent spin coating or the Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) technique
[49]. Spin coating is a familiar technique that is often used in
photolithographic processes. The L-B technique is a method by which
one can deposit an organic film layer by layer. This technique offers a
high degree of precision in terms of controlling the film thickness.
Unfortunately, it is limited primarily to organic materials. The more
common organic materials used are based upon the metal

(MPCs), shown in Figure 2.35. MPCs basically have a metal ion in the
center that is attached through nitrogen atoms to various benzene
rings. MPCs are p-type organic semiconductors that can interact
strongly with gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO2), ammonia (NH3),
and chlorine (Cl2), resulting in large changes in electrical conductivity.
By varying the metal ion (Cu, Pb, Mg, Fe, Co, Ni) in the MPCs, sensor
properties such as sensitivity, selectivity, reversibility, and response
times can be varied.
Although promising results have been achieved using organic
semiconductors such as MPCs, the long-term stability of these
organic semiconductor sensors is poor. The sensors may find limited
use as disposable devices in various biosensor applications or in
cheap badges used by workers exposed to various types of gases.

Introduction to Sensors
propagating through the metallic film, resulting in an increase in film
resistance. In preparation of this sensor, several precautions need to
be taken. First, the electrodes should be of a different metal than the
sensing film or shielded from the target gas. Second, the films should
be relatively thin so that the contributions to conductivity changes can
be accurately monitored. Although any metal can be used, gold is
particularly attractive since it is reasonably selective to potential
dangerous gases such as mercury, halogen gases (Cl2, F2, I2, Br2),
and H2S. The major weakness in this type of sensor is dynamic range.
The transition of the metal films from a perfect conductor to an

insulator takes place over a small range of gas concentrations.
Therefore, this type of sensor, although very sensitive (ppb range),
saturates very quickly. This type of sensor has been exploited
commercially, as is evidenced by the gold film H2S sensor available
from Jerome Instrument Corporation [50]. This sensor has an
operational range of 1 to 500 ppb of H2S, and although the principle of
operation is reasonably simple, it costs about $10,000!
2.5 Other Solid-State Electrochemical Gas Sensors 2.5.1
background
Even though resistance-based metal oxide semiconductor sensors
are the most common gas sensors commercially available, there are
several other types of solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. They
include solid-state capacitors, metal oxide semiconductor field effect
transistors (MOSFETs), metal semiconductor Schottky type diodes,
metal interfacial layer semiconducting (MIS) heterostructure diodes,
and metal-insulating metal (MIM) heterostructure diodes. All of the
aforementioned sensors exhibit changes in electrical properties such
as conductivity, impedance, voltage, current, or capacitance upon
exposure to a target gas. Complete descriptions of each of these
sensors can be found in the literature [51]. The two most common
solid-state electrochemical gas sensors, the MOS capacitor and the
Schottky type sensors, will be discussed.
2.5.2 Solid-State Capacitive gas Sensors Any capacitor sensor
consists of an arrangement of conductors and dielectrics. The specific
materials and the geometric arrangement of the sensor itself enable
one to classify different types of capacitive sensors. The two
capacitive type sensors that will be discussed are the metal oxide
semiconductor (MOS) capacitor and the
micromechanical polymer capacitor.

Electrochemical Sensors
65
2.5.2.1 The MOS Capacitive Gas Sensor
The physical structure and the associated band structure for the MOS
capacitor are presented in Figure 2.37. The function of the insulating
layer is to block carrier flow. The potential, ÏI, is the drop in potential
across the insulating layer, and ÏS is the barrier potential variation in
the space charge region.
The barrier potential and the corresponding space charge region are
similar to the situation that occurs in a double-layer metal oxide
semiconductor, as discussed earlier. In the double-layer
semiconducting metal oxide surface, the barrier potential in the space

charge region can be modified by an applied voltage. In addition, a
sorbed target gas can also modify the barrier potential, height, and
width. Typically, oxidizing gases increase the barrier potential,
whereas reducing gas causes a potential barrier decrease. It is critical,
however, that the insulating layer thickness, t, is wide enough in order
to inhibit the tunneling of electrons or holes through the potential
barrier. Typically the value for t is greater than 100 Ã.
The total capacitance per unit area, C, of the insulator and the space
charge region is given as

Introduction to Sensors
where C sc = capacitance per unit area of the space charge region,
and C I =
capacitance per unit area of the insulator.

Assuming that the structure shown in Figure 2.37 is approximated as a
parallel plate capacitor, C sc and C I may be represented as follows: C
= Îµ
SC
SC w
(2.41)
and
C = Îµ
I
I t
(2.42)
where Îµ S C and Îµ I are the dielectric constants of the space charge
region and the insulator, respectively, and w is the depletion width in
the semiconductor.
As a target gas interacts with a space charge region, both the
dielectric constant, Îµ SC, and the thickness, w, of the space charge
region change. Hence the space charge capacitance becomes a
measure of the gas concentration.
Typically the semiconductor that is used in the MOS capacitor is
silicon and the insulating layer is SiO2. Noting that the dielectric
constant of Si is about four times greater than that of SiO2, and since
w is of the order of microns and t is typically of the order of a few 100
Ã, the total capacitance as measured is approximately the same as
the capacitance of the space charge region, and therefore a direct
measure of the target gas concentration.

The materials used in the MOS capacitor sensor are transition
materials such as Palladium (Pd) for the conductor, SiO2 for the
insulating layer, and silicon for the semiconductor. Since it is well
known that Pd readily sorbs hydrogen and hydrogen-bearing gases,
most of the work on an MOS capacitor relates to the detection of these
gases. In Figure 2.38 the capacitive applied bias voltage (C-V)
characteristics of a Pd/1,000 Ã SiO2/ n-type silicon capacitor sensor
are presented upon exposure to 100% O2 and 600 ppm of the H2 in O2
at room temperature [54].
It can be seen from Figure 2.38 that the sensitivity, which is defined as
the change in capacitance divided by the capacitive with no bias
voltage, is maximum when the bias voltage is zero. It is interesting to
note that in contrast to the semiconducting metal oxide sensor
discussed earlier, which operates at elevated temperatures, the MOS
H2 sensor operates at room temperature. This sensor, however, can
also be used at elevated temperatures to sense non-hydrogen-
bearing gases such as CO. As in the case of the semiconducting
metal oxide sensors discussed earlier, H2O vapor affects the MOS
capacitor sensitivity. In particular, although increased water vapor
concentration decreases the response time, the sensitivity is reduced.

2.5.2.2 Micromachine Capacitive Polymer Gas Sensor
Recently there has been considerable interest in using polymer-based
capacitive arrays for gas sensing [52]. In contrast to the single MOS
capacitor sensors previously discussed, the novel use of the
electrodes and the selective properties of polymer coatings have
resulted in the fabrication of multiple capacitors in a single substrate.

One of the major obstacles in a capacitor-based sensor is the
exposure of the target gas to the chemi-selective layer. One such
capacitor array configuration is shown in Figures 2.39 and 2.40. This
type of arrangement can accommodate many capacitors, and the
perforated top conductor plate allows the target gas to diffuse into the
polymer layer.
Using different types of chemi-selective films operating at different
temperatures and interfacing this structure with the appropriate
electronics enables one to detect a variety of gases simultaneously
[53]. In these individual sensing elements two basic changes occur:
changes in the dielectric constant and changes in the volume of the
polymer due to polymer swelling. This type of sensor array has been
used to detect chemical warfare agents and other toxic industrial
chemicals. The polymer coatings are typically deposited from an ink
jet and then cured in an oven. Examples of polymers include

propylaminopropyl polysiloxane (PAPPS) and siloxenefluoroalcohol
(SXFA), which are selective to various target gases such as
hydrazine, hydrogen cyanide, and sarin. The actual sensor system
array, which includes the preconcentrator, heater

2.5.3 Schottky Diode Type gas Sensor The Schottky diode basically
consists of a metal semiconductor (MS) configuration. However, if the
metal is not a noble one such as gold, palladium, etc., then the diode
would consist of a metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) configuration.
When a non-noble metal is used, oxidation can occur at the metal
semiconductor interface, causing an MIS type structure to result. The
MIS

structure and associated band structure are the same as the MIS
capacitor shown in Figure 2.37, while the MS and associated band
structure are shown in Figures 2.42. The critical element in these
structures is the semiconductor,

since this is where the gas will interact, resulting in changes in the
barrier potential and electron flow. The metal does serve a secondary
purpose in that it can selectively absorb certain gases, dissociate
them, and then make them available to the semiconductor. For
example, it is well known that palladium absorbs hydrogen and certain
hydrogen-bearing gases, whereas gold will absorb gases such as
NOx, SOx, H2S, and mercury.
The basic changes observed in the MS and MIS structures are in the
current-voltage (I-V) relationship. One must note, however, that in the
MIS structure the oxide layer must be less than 50 Ã. This is due to the

fact that electron transport occurs through the oxide layer via quantum
mechanical tunneling. The MS
configuration is really no different than the metal semiconductor
interface that occurs in the metal oxide semiconductor gas sensor
previously discussed.
As in the case of the MOS capacitive gas sensors, the most common
target gases are hydrogen or hydrogen-bearing gases such as NH3
and SiH4.
The most common metal used is palladium for both structures,
whereas the common semiconductors and insulators used in the
structure include TiO2, n-type silicon, and SiO2, respectively. Also
note that in both cases a space charge region exists. An example of
the I-V characteristics of a Pd/TiO2 diode in air containing various
concentrations of H2 is shown in Figure 2.43.

Piezoelectric Sensors
3.1 Introduction
Piezoelectric sensors use the piezoelectric effect as the principle
of operation. The piezoelectric effect refers to the appearance of an
electric field in a material when it is subjected to a stress force or a
strain. Since it is a reversible effect, if an electric field or voltage is
applied to a piezoelectric material, it stresses or strains. This first

effect is called the direct piezoelectric effect, the second, the
converse piezoelectric effect.
The following experiments will illustrate the two piezoelectric effects. A
piezoelectric material with two metal electrodes, one on the top face
and the other on the bottom face, is shown in Figure 3.1a. If one
attempts to âstretchâ
the material or apply what is commonly called a tensile stress, an
electric field will appear across the material as shown in Figure 3.1b.
Note that for this material, the electric field polarity is positive on the
top electrode. If one attempts to âsqueezeâ the material or apply what
is commonly called a compressive stress to the same material as
shown in Figure 3.1c, an electric field with a negative polarity on the
top electrode will appear.
When an electric field of the polarity shown in Figure 3.1d is applied,
the material will contract. Likewise, an electric field of the opposite
polarity will cause the material to stretch or elongate as shown in
Figure 3.1e. Finally, it is interesting to note that if the electric field or

stress is doubled, the material deformation or electric field will also
double. This is shown in Figure 3.1f and g. Obviously, if a very high
electric field or stress is applied, the material would most likely fracture
and not return to its original shape once the electric field or stress is
removed. Therefore, under the application of a low to moderate
electrical field or stress, a linear reversible relationship exists between
electric field and stress.
As a result of these simple experiments, the following conclusions can
be made:
1. Mechanical and electrical phenomena are directly coupled in
piezoelectric materials. In particular, a stress produces an electric
field, and hence a voltage, and an electric field produces a stress, and
hence a deformation.

2. The direction of the electric field developed across the material due
to stress depends on whether the stress is tensile or compressive.
3. A type of deformation, such as the elongation or compression,
caused by the applied electric field, depends on the direction of the
applied electric field.
Piezoelectric Sensors
79
4. The piezoelectric effect is linear; i.e., the stress and hence the
deformation are proportional to the electric field, and an electric field is
proportional to the applied stress.
3.2 Classification of Piezoelectric Sensors Piezoelectric sensors
can be classified as being either passive or active. In passive
piezoelectric sensors, the measurands may be detected without the
use of an external energy source and the measurand of interest is

usually a force. This force may be pressure or the force resulting from
acceleration or deceleration. An electric field may also serve as the
measurand; however, this type of passive piezoelectric sensor is
seldom used.
When the piezoelectric sensor is used as an active sensor, an
energy source such as an AC electric field or voltage is used. The AC
voltage sets up alternating stresses and therefore displacements in
the material, which manifest themselves as acoustic waves. If these
waves are then confined within the bulk or surface of finite volume in
the material, they may become resonant acoustic waves. If the
material with an excited resonant acoustic wave is then exposed to a
measurand, acoustic wave properties such as velocity, attenuation, or
resonant frequency change are then used to monitor the measurand
of interest. Common active piezoelectric sensors include bulk and
surface acoustic wave sensors. These sensors can be used to monitor
mechanical measurands such as mass and viscosity and, if coated
with a target analyte selective film, a wide range of chemical and
biological target analytes that can be present in gaseous or liquid
media.

3.3 Piezoelectric Materials as Intelligent or Smart Materials
Piezoelectric materials possess a very important feature. It is possible
to transduct a mechanical measurand such as force, pressure,
acceleration, or deceleration directly into an output electrical signal.
This direct transduction may be considered an inherent intelligence
or smartness of the material. In recent years the importance of
piezoelectric materials or what is sometimes referred to as smart
materials in the development of sensors has been grow-ing very
rapidly. The use of the smart materials allows one to simplify sensor
design, and hence to eliminate usually complex hybrid signal
transduction or conditioning components of the sensor.
In order to illustrate the smartness inherent in a piezoelectric material
consider two pressure sensors, one a classical mechanical pressure
sensor and another a piezoelectric pressure sensor. A standard
approach in the classical
80
Introduction to Sensors
mechanical sensor is to use a diaphragm as a sensing element. An
example of a classical mechanical sensor is shown in Figure 3.2a.

This simple pressure sensor consists of a diaphragm, connecting rod,
potentiometer, and DC voltage source. Under pressure, the
diaphragm displaces the rod, which in turn moves the wiper of the
potentiometer. The output voltage from the potentiometer is
proportional to the pressure. The diaphragm is made of an elastic
material like steel or aluminum.
In the piezoelectric pressure sensor the diaphragm is made of a
piezoelectric material such as the polymer polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF),
as shown in Figure 3.2b. In this case the pressure is directly converted
into an electrical signal in PVDF through the piezoelectric effect. One
can clearly see the advantage of the piezoelectric material. PVDF

and electrical components of the classical mechanical sensor. As a
result the piezoelectric pressure sensor is small, accurate, rugged,
easy to manufacture, and inexpensive.
3.4 The Piezoelectric Effect
Only certain materials display the piezoelectric effect. The first
materials known to exhibit the effect were naturally occurring, highly
polar crystals such as quartz (SiO2) and Rochelle salt. Barium
titanate, lead zirconium titanate (PZT), lithium niobate (LiNbO3), and
PVDF include some of the synthetic materials found to possess
piezoelectric properties.
In order to explain piezoelectricity, a two-dimensional hexagonal
lattice consisting of oppositely charged atoms of identical charge is

used as an example. The basic element of the hexagonal cell is the
dipole shown in Figure 3.3a. The atoms are held together by
interatomic forces, which to a first approximation are represented as
springs in Figure 3.3.
Referring to Figure 3.3a, the electric field, E, from the dipole at a point
W
where r >> â, is given by
=
E p 2
3
ÏÎµ o r
(3.1)
where p is the electric dipole moment defined as p = q
(3.2)
and Îµo is the dielectric constant of vacuum.
Under the equilibrium conditions shown in Figure 3.3b and noting that
r >> â, the electric field of the hexagonal lattice at point W is the sum of
the contributions of the individual fields from the dipoles AB, FC, and
ED, which may be expressed as follows:
E = â¡â£( q ) â(2 q ) +( q ) â¤ 2
r 3

(3.3)

Thus, the total electric field at W from the hexagonal lattice is zero.
Now, if a tensile stress, t, is applied to the lattice along the axis OW,
the lattice will be deformed and each ion will be displaced, as shown in
Figure 3.3c. The displacements, Î´ â 1 and Î´ â 2, will be different due to
the fact that the two atoms have different mass. However, to a first
approximation, one may assume that Î´ â 1 = Î´ â 2 = Î´ â. Noting that
the dipoles AB and ED are

83
And pâ may be thought of as the equivalent dipole moment of the
stressed hexagonal lattice.
In contrast to no electrical field occurring for the hexagon in
equilibrium, it is observed that the application of tensile stress has
resulted in the appearance of an electrical field.
Noting that the strain, s, due to the tensile stress, t, is defined as s = Î´
(3.6)
Equation 3.5 may be written as follows:
p Ê¹ = 2 q s
(3.7)
Since stress, t, is related to strain by Hookeâs law, which is given as s
= sct
(3.8)
where s c is the mechanical compliance, the equivalent dipole
moment, pâ , can be written as follows:
p Ê¹ = 2 q sct
(3.9)
Assuming that the two-dimensional hexagon contains N molecules
per unit area, it follows that the electric polarization, P, which in this
two-dimensional case is defined as the dipole moment per unit area, is
given as P = dt

(3.10)
where
d = 2 q scN
(3.11)
The quantity, d, is by definition the piezoelectric constant, which is
the proportionality factor between the mechanical stresses and
induced electrical polarization. Note that in an actual three-
dimensional lattice the polarization is defined as the dipole movement
per unit volume.
In order to determine the units and magnitude of d, some
representative values of the parameters in Equation 3.11 will be used.
Noting in three dimensions that N = 5 Ã 1028/m3, q = 1.6 Ã 10â19
coulombs (C), s c = 12.7 Ã 10â11
m2/N, and â = 1.5 Ã 10â10m, it is found that d = 1.52 Ã 10â12 C/N. It is
interesting to point out that this result is comparable to an actual
piezoelectric constant of quartz, d 11 = 2.41 Ã 10â12 C/N.
84
Introduction to Sensors
In a similar fashion it may be shown that when an external electric
field, E, is applied along OW, the lattice will undergo a deformation
that is a linear function of the electric field. The resulting
proportionality constant between the electric field and the resultant
strain is also a piezoelectric constant. It is interesting to examine the
structural properties of a hexagonal lattice to see if there is a
correlation between piezoelectricity and structure.

Assuming that the origin of the lattice is at an atomic site (for example,
site A), one notes that this lattice does not possess a center of
symmetry. In particular, for each ion at a position ( xy) there is no
similar ion located at (â x,â y). If there were a like atom at (â x,â y), the
piezoelectric effect would not be present.
It is interesting to note that if stress or electric field is applied along a
direction different than OW, the piezoelectric constant may be
different. It is therefore obvious that in an actual crystal the
piezoelectric constant will have different values depending on the
direction of the applied stress or electric field.
3.5 The Properties of Nonpiezoelectric and Piezoelectric
Materials
A knowledge of the electrical and mechanical properties of
piezoelectric materials is important in the design and operation of a
piezoelectric sensor. In general, these properties are described by the
constitutive equations, which relate mechanical forces such as
stress and strain to electrical properties such as electric field and
electric displacement.
In order to deduce the constitutive equations for a piezoelectric
material, both mechanical and electrical properties of nonpiezoelectric
materials must be discussed.
3.5.1 Mechanical Properties of Nonpiezoelectric Materials A
nonpiezoelectric material subjected to a stress responds by changing
its
shape, and there is no electric field accompanying the stress, as
shown in Figure 3.4. Similarly, if the material is subjected to a strain, a
stress appears.
The general relationship in a three-dimensional solid cube between
stress and strain can be written as follows:

Various forces that may be applied to a small cube of the material.
The first subscript in the individual stresses indicates the direction of
the applied force, whereas the second subscript denotes the plane
upon which the force is acting. For example, the term Î¤yz corresponds
to a force acting in the y direction on the z plane. The forces with the
same subscripts, e.g., Î¤zz, correspond to compressional forces,
whereas the forces with different subscripts, e.g., Î¤yz, correspond to
shearing forces. Also note that in Figure 3.5
there are a total of nine forces; however, only six forces appear in
Equation 3.13. This is due to the fact that the angular acceleration of
the cube must be zero, resulting in the following relationship: Î¤ =

where

and
i, j = x, y, z
Similar arguments also apply for the individual strains; hence

where i and j are defined in Equation 3.16.

The matrix [ c] is defined as the elastic constant matrix and in general
may have 36 terms. Equation 3.12 may also be written in the following
form:

where
[ s ]=[ ]â1

(3.19)
The matrix [ s c] is defined as the compliance matrix and is the same
rank order as the elastic constant matrix.
In the previous discussion relating to the planar hexagonal lattice, the
stresses, strains, mechanical compliance, and piezoelectric constant
had only one value. This is due to the fact that the force was applied in
only one direction. Because the distance between individual atoms in
an actual crystalline material is dependent upon crystallographic
direction, one can expect that a crystalline material will have several
different constants, which is reflected in the multivalued elastic and
compliance matrices. Fortunately, due to the symmetry inherent in an
actual crystal, the number of independent elastic or compliance
constants is quite small. In fact, in the case of an isotropic solid, there
are only two independent constants, whereas for a cubic crystal, only
three independent constants exist.
The respective elastic constant matrices for an isotropic solid and a
cubic crystal are given as follows:

Introduction to Sensors
3.5.2 electrical Properties of Nonpiezoelectric Materials In order to
describe the effect an electric field has on a nonpiezoelectric material,
consider the parallel plate capacitor shown in Figure 3.6. The applied
voltage or electric field causes a displacement of the electrons around
the atomic nuclei, resulting in each atom becoming a small dipole. The
material is then said to be polarized and has a dipole moment per unit
volume, or what is defined as the polarization, [ P]. The magnitude of
the polarization relates to the individual atoms comprising the material
and the strength of the applied electric field. As a consequence of the
polarization, one capacitor plate acquires a positive charge and the
other plate a negative charge, as shown in Figure 3.6. The amount of
charge per unit area is characterized by the electric displacement or
electric flux density, [ D], and is given as follows:
[ D]= Îµ [E]+[ ]
o
P
(3.22)
where [ P] = polarization of the nonpiezoelectric material, and Îµ o =
permittivity of a vacuum.
Since [ P] is proportional to the electric field, [ E], and the ability of the
atoms to deform into dipoles, it may be represented as follows:

[P]= Îµ o[Î·]â[E]
(3.23)
where [Î·] is a 3 Ã 3 matrix defined as the dielectric susceptibility.
The total electric displacement, [ D], can now be expressed as
[ D]=[Îµ]â[ E]

[Îµ]= Îµ0 [{ I]+[Î·]}

Equation 3.24 is called the dielectric constitutive equation, and [Îµ] is
the dielectric permittivity.
It is important to note that [ E], [ D], and [ P] in general are 1 Ã 3
matrices that may have x, y, or z components, depending upon the
reference coordinate system defined in the material. It then follows
that the dielectric permittivity,
[Îµ], is a 3 Ã 3 matrix, which can be represented as follows:

Normally the dielectric permittivity matrix contains one or two
independent terms and the off-diagonal terms are usually equal to

zero.
In addition to polarization there is a very small change in the shape of
a material due to the elongation of the atoms caused by an applied
electric field. This change in shape is very small in comparison to
changes due to an applied electric field in piezoelectric materials. This
phenomenon is called electrostriction and is present in any
nonpiezoelectric material. Also, it is not reversible, which means that a
change in a materialâs shape due to a stress will not create an electric
field.
3.5.3 electrical and Mechanical Properties of Piezoelectric
Materials The electrical and mechanical properties of piezoelectric
materials can be described by two piezoelectric constitutive equations.
In order to obtain these equations, first consider the experiment shown
in Figure 3.1c. A piezoelectric material with two metal electrodes, one
on the top face and the second on the bottom face, is subjected to a
compressive stress. As a result, the material will initially be deformed
according to Hookeâs law, and then, as a result of the deformation, an
electric field, [ E], appears, which then causes a polarization, [ P], and
an electric displacement, [ D], to occur in the material. Mathematically,
this may be represented by the following piezoelectric constitutive
equation:
[Î¤]=[ c]â[ s]â[ e]â[ E]
(3.27)
90
Introduction to Sensors
where [ e] is defined as the piezoelectric constant matrix. Examination
of Equation 3.27 reveals that the [ e] matrix is a 3 Ã 6 matrix defined as
follows:

Note that if the material is nonpiezoelectric, Equation 3.27 reduces to
Equation 3.12, the common representation of Hookeâs law. In order to
obtain the second constitutive equation, consider the experiment
shown in Figure 3.1d, where the piezoelectric material is subjected to
an applied electric field. As a result, the material will acquire a
polarization, [ P], or electric displacement, [ D], and a strain, [ S], or a
stress, [ T]. The second constitutive equation is usually written in the
following form:
[ D]=[ e]Î¤[ s]+[Îµ][ E]
(3.29)
where the superscript Î¤ denotes the matrix transpose operation.
Again, note that if the material is nonpiezoelectric, Equation 3.29
reduces to the relationship given in Equation 3.24.
3.5.4 The Piezoelectric Coupling Coefficient The piezoelectric
coupling coefficient, k, is one of the most important properties of a
piezoelectric material. It characterizes the piezoelectric material from
the energy conversion point of view, whereas the piezoelectric
constants characterize a material in terms of the relation between the
field quantities, such as stress, strain, electric field, and electric
displacement.
In order to describe the piezoelectric coupling coefficient from an
energy balance point of view, refer to Figure 3.7. In Figure 3.7 the
mechanical energy, W m, is supplied to a piezoelectric material
through an applied stress. This mechanical energy, W m, is stored as
a mechanical energy via the deformation of the material, W mm, and
as electric energy, W me, due to the creation of an electric field as
shown in Figure 3.7. A similar energy balance consideration can be
obtained in the case where an applied electric energy, W e, is divided

into polarization or electric displacement energy, W ee, and
mechanical energy, W em.

The piezoelectric coupling coefficient, k, is a measure of how much of

may be expressed as

It can be shown [1] that k 1 = k 2 = k, and k is given by k = e ( s Îµ)0.5
(3.32)
where e, s, and Îµ represent single-valued equivalent piezoelectric,
compliance, and dielectric constants in the crystallographic direction
for which the stress or electric field is applied. These single-valued
constants are linear combinations of the independent constants. The
value of the piezoelectric coupling coefficients for selected
piezoelectric materials is given in Table 3.1.
The piezoelectric ceramic, PZT, has the highest piezoelectric coupling
coefficients and is the strongest piezoelectric material. It has a value
of k = 68%, whereas for quartz, k â 1%.

3.6 Piezoelectric Stress/Pressure Sensor The most common
passive piezoelectric sensor is one in which stress or pressure is the

measurand of interest. The design steps necessary to develop this are
as follows:
1. Determination of the magnitude of the sensing element response in
the measurand range for different piezoelectric materials 2.
Development of an equivalent electrical circuit for the sensing element
3. Determination of the time response of the sensing element 4.
Development of a signal conditioning system to interface the sensing
element response to the observer
5. Choice of the piezoelectric material for the sensing element 6.
Sensor construction
The stress/pressure sensor used will be designed to respond to static
stresses and pressures ranging from 102 to 105 N/m2. The
piezoelectric sensing element will be a square piezoelectric plate of
dimensions 10 Ã 10 Ã 1 mm, with electrodes on the top and bottom
faces (see Figure 3.8). The above stress range corresponds
approximately to the force generated from a gram to a 1 kg weight on
the surface plate.
3.6.1 Determination of the Magnitude of the Sensing element
response in the Measurand range for Different Piezoelectric
Materials In Section 3.5 it was shown that a stress will produce a
strain or deformation, an electric field, and an electric displacement. In
order to determine

the magnitude of each sensing response, refer to Equations 3.27 and
3.29.
The strain associated with an applied stress, T, normal to the plate,
can be obtained from Equation 3.18. Noting the definition of strain in
terms of deformation given by Equation 3.6, one obtains the following
relationship for the deformation:

Î´ = s Î¤
c
(3.33)
where s c = equivalent mechanical compliance normal to the plate,
and â =
plate thickness.
Note that even though the mechanical compliance is in general a 6 Ã 6
matrix, in a given crystallographic direction (in this case, normal to the
plate) it has only a single value. This so-called equivalent mechanical
compliance is a linear combination of independent mechanical
compliance constants.
The applied stress also produces an electric field or voltage across the
piezoelectric plate. In this case Equation 3.27 reduces to the following:
T = â eE
(3.34)
Solving Equation 3.34 for E one obtains
E = â eâ1 T
(3.35)
Since the applied stress is normal to the plate, and noting that the
induced voltage may be expressed as
V = E â
(3.36)
one obtains

V = â e-1Î¤
(3.37)

As in the case of the mechanical compliance, the term e represents an
equivalent piezoelectric constant.

Finally, the applied stress also produces an electric displacement that
is equal to the surface charge density on the piezoelectric plates.
Referring now to Equations 3.18 and 3.29, one obtains
[ D] = [ e]Î¤ [ S c] [ T]
(3.38)
Noting that the surface charge, q, may be represented as q = DA
(3.39)
where A = surface area of the piezoelectric plate, one obtains q = Aeâ
S c T
(3.40)
The term eâ represents another equivalent piezoelectric constant.
Assuming that the piezoelectric plates are X-cut quartz, Z-cut LiNbO3,
and Z-cut PZT, respectively, the corresponding minimum and
maximum values for the deformation, voltage, and charge can be
obtained. These values are summarized in Table 3.2. It may be seen
that the only significant response that can easily be measured is the
voltage.
3.6.2 equivalent Circuit for the Sensing element In order to
interface the sensing element to the signal conditioning and
processing segment of the sensor, it is necessary to represent the
sensing element in terms of an equivalent electrical circuit. The
piezoelectric plate is essentially a capacitor in which the capacitance
may be represented as follows:
C = Îµ

Although piezoelectric materials are in general good dielectrics, they
do have a finite conductivity, which introduces a resistance, R s, that is
parallel to C o. This resistance may be expressed as Ï
Rs = A,
(3.42)
where Ï = piezoelectric plate conductivity. The resulting equivalent
circuit for the piezoelectric plate is shown in Figure 3.9.
The values for C o and R s for various orientations in several
piezoelectric materials are summarized in Table 3.3.
The resistance for LiNbO3 was measured at 400Â°C, and for the other
crystals, the resistance was measured at 20oC.
3.6.3 Time response for the Stress/Pressure Sensor The response
of the sensing element will be examined for a static force, F.
Using Equation 3.40 and noting that stress is force (F) per surface
area of the piezoelectric plate, one obtains the following expression for
the charge per unit area on the piezoelectric plate: q = eÊ¹ScF.

(3.43)
96
Introduction to Sensors
The charge generated on the surface of the piezoelectric plate causes
a voltage to appear across the plate. Noting the definition of
capacitance, namely, C0 = q/V,
(3.44)
and using Equation 3.43, the voltage on the plate, V0, may be
expressed as follows:
V0 = eÊ¹ScF/C0.
(3.45)
Since the charge leaks through the resistor, RS, it may be shown that
the voltage on the piezoelectric plate decays exponentially with time (
t) as follows:
V0( t) = V0 e â t/Ï0,
(3.46)
where
V0 = eÊ¹ScF/C0
and
Ï0 = RsC0
The term V0 may be written as follows:
V0=KF,

(3.47)
where
K = eÊ¹Sc/C0.
(3.48)
The parameter K depends only upon properties of the piezoelectric
plate and is called the sensor parameter. The term Ï0 is the time it
takes for the voltage to decay to 1/e of its original value and is called
the time constant of the circuit. The rate of decrease of the voltage,
V0(t), depends directly on Ï0, which is also a function of the material
properties of the piezoelectric plate.
The approximate time responses of sensing elements made from
SiO2, LiNbO3, and PZT are shown in Figure 3.10. Depending on the
piezoelectric material, there is a wide range of decay rates. For
example, for LiNbO3, Ï = 38 Âµs, while for PZT and SiO2 the values for
Ï are 1.15 s and 7.96 Ã 103 s (2.2
h), respectively. Therefore, SiO2 (quartz) appears to be a logical
choice for a static force sensor due to its very slow decay rate.
In Table 3.4, values for the time constant, Ï0, and the sensor
parameter, K, are summarized for orientations in quartz, LiNbO3, and
PZT.

3.6.4 Signal Conditioning System to interface the Sensing
element response to the Observer Examining Tables 3.2 and 3.3,

one can clearly see that piezoelectric pressure sensing elements are
inherently high-output resistive devices that generate small charges
(on the order of picocoulombs
[pC]) or currents (on the order of picoamperes [pA]), and small
voltages (on the order of millivolts [mV]).
Therefore, amplifiers may need to be used to condition the output
signal. In the present analysis two cases will be considered. In the first
case the sensing element output is directly connected to an output
display. In the second case a signal conditioning circuit is placed
between the sensing element output and the display device.
3.6.4.1 Sensing Element Output Interfaced Directly to the Display
Device
The pressure sensing element is connected via a 3 ft long coaxial 50 Î©
cable directly to a display system consisting of a Tektronix Model 7603
oscilloscope. The electric equivalent circuit, which includes the
sensing elements, a connecting cable, and a display device
(oscilloscope), is shown in Figure 3.11. The total capacitance, C T, and
resistance, R Î¤, of the circuit may be expressed as C T = C O + C
Cable + C OSC

piezoelectric materials are given in Table 3.5.
Comparing Tables 3.4 and 3.5, it can be seen that the display circuit
elements significantly affect the relevant sensor parameters. In
particular, for quartz, which initially appeared to have promise as the
piezoelectric material for the

sensing element, the time constant has decreased by about six orders
of magnitude and the sensor parameter has decreased by a factor of
44. Degradation of sensor parameters was also observed for LiNbO3
and PZT. In conclusion, one can easily see that the performance of
the sensor appears to be more dependent on the coaxial cable and
display device than on the sensing element output.
3.6.4.2 Sensing Element Interfaced to a Charge
Amplifier and a Display Device
In this case a charge amplifier is placed between the coaxial line and
the display device. The equivalent circuit for this sensor is shown in

Figure 3.12. A charge amplifier is a circuit whose input impedance is a
capacitance that provides a very high value of impedance at low
frequencies. The function of the charge amplifier is to produce a
voltage that is proportional to the charge on the piezoelectric plate
while at the same time providing a low-output impedance. Hence, it is
a charge-to-voltage converter, or what may be called an impedance
converter. The charge amplifier, with its low-output impedance,
essentially separates the display device from the sensing element.
The amplifier has a significant effect on the sensor performance. In
particular, for an operational amplifier (op-amp) of gain, A, the output
voltage from the sensing element, V O, is equal to AV O. Inherently,
op-amps have high-input impedance, low-output impedance, and
high-voltage gain. Note that the positive input of the op amp is
grounded.
It may be shown using circuit theory that the output voltage, V Ê¹Ê¹
0 ( t), is of the
same form as Equations 3.46 and 3.51; namely,

In the derivation of Equation 3.52, the gain is assumed to be very large
(typically 105 to 109).
The values of Kâ and Ï0â obtained for A = 106 and C f = 10 pF are given
in Table 3.6.
It is interesting to compare the sensor parameters with the
corresponding parameters given in Tables 3.4 and 3.5. It is seen that
the most dramatic change occurs for the sensor parameter. In
particular, for PZT it has increased three orders of magnitude. The
charge amplifier has essentially eliminated the effect of the connecting
cable and display device on the sensor performance.
3.6.5 The Choice of the Piezoelectric Material for the Sensing
element The choice of the piezoelectric material to be used for the
sensing element is dependent upon the specific application of the
stress/pressure sensor. The applications are diverse and cover the
range of measuring very weak stress, or low pressures, to measuring
stress or pressure under adverse environmental conditions. Some
typical examples of applications will be given, and appropriate
piezoelectric materials to be used for the sensing element will be
suggested.
In applications requiring high sensitivity, and therefore the need to
measure very small stresses or pressures, the sensor parameter is

the key factor. Examining Tables 3.5 and 3.6, it is obvious that the
sensor should have
Piezoelectric Sensors
101
an amplifier stage and that the most desirable piezoelectric material
for the sensing element is PZT followed by LiNbO3 and SiO2.
In the measurement of static forces the key factor is the time constant.
In this case, it can be seen from Table 3.6 that the sensor must have
an amplifier stage and the piezoelectric material of choice is quartz.
PZT may also be used, particularly if one is concerned with sensitivity.
However, appropriate signal processing needs to be performed when
PZT is used since it has a rather small time constant.
In measurement of large stresses or pressure, the piezoelectric
material must be able to withstand significant forces without fracturing
or exceeding its elastic limit. Since those materials with high elastic
constants are considered to be the strongest, the best choice for the
piezoelectric material is SiO2
followed by LiNbO3 and PZT.
Often applications require that a sensor be used in an environment
where the temperature varies over a wide range. The appropriate
choice of material is then strongly dependent upon the temperature
range of interest. For high-temperature applications, one needs to be
concerned as to whether the material of interest maintains its
piezoelectric properties.
Materials such as quartz and PZT undergo structural phase transitions
above 500 and 150Â°C, respectively. Therefore, these materials should
not be used near or above those temperatures. On the other hand,

LiNbO3 can be used up to 1,000Â°C, since it still retains its piezoelectric
properties. At low temperatures, the critical feature is the brittleness of
the material. Since this case is similar to applications relating to large
stress or pressure, the material of choice is SiO2 followed by LiNbO3
and PZT. Finally, in applications relating to high sensitivity,
temperature can play a critical role. For example, in measuring very
low stresses, a change of a few degrees in temperature can cause
piezoelectric material parameters to change, and hence affect the
sensing element response. This will result in a significant error in
determining low stress values. In order to eliminate this problem, one
should try to use a material that is both sensitive to stress and
insensitive to temperature variations. In this case, quartz may be the
material of choice over PZT and LiNbO3. This is due to the fact that
quartz, although it is not as stress or pressure sensitive as PZT or
LiNbO3, is relatively insensitive to temperature variations. PZT and
LiNbO3, on the other hand, are very sensitive to temperature changes.
In sensors that are expected to function over a long period of time, it is
important that the material and hence sensor properties have minimal
variations with time. Materials and sensors exhibiting this behavior are
said to have excellent aging characteristics. For long-life sensors the
material of choice is SiO2 followed by LiNbO3 and PZT.
Two other factors that can affect the choice of sensor material are the
technological process used to make the sensing element and the cost
of the sensing element. In terms of brittleness, PZT is the most brittle,
followed by LiNbO3 and SiO2. Relative to size and shape, SiO2 and
LiNbO3 have limits
102
Introduction to Sensors
due to the fact that they are single crystals, whereas PZT is a ceramic
and hence can be made into a variety of sizes and shapes. Finally, in

terms of cost, the least expensive is PZT followed by SiO2 and
LiNbO3.
In many applications, the final choice of the piezoelectric material is
obvious. For example, if the ultimate objective is to reduce cost, PZT is
the choice.
In other applications, the final choice is not so obvious and trade-offs
need to be considered. An example would be a sensor for low
pressure that needs to operate over a specified temperature range.
PZT gives the necessary sensitivity, but SiO2 is very temperature
stable, therefore resulting in a choice that is not so obvious.
3.6.6 Sensor Construction
There are many possible physical configurations for the
stress/pressure sensor.
These configurations depend upon the source of the stress or
pressure. The two types of sources that will be examined include
mechanical force and gas.
3.6.6.1 Piezoelectric Mechanical Force Sensor
In a force sensor a piezoelectric sensor (plate) is placed in an
enclosure (cell) in order to form a mechanically rigid cell. A basic
piezoelectric force sensor cell is illustrated in Figure 3.13a. The cell
contains the piezoelectric plate and two hardened steel cylinders. The
piezoelectric plate is mechanically connected to the internal cylinder,
which is opened to a force and free to move. A change in force causes
a mechanical change in the piezoelectric plate, which results in a
generation of electric charge or voltage. The charge or voltage is
transferred out of the cell using a shielded connector. A commercial
model of a quartz force sensor produced by Kistler [2] is shown in
Figure 3.13b.

3.6.6.2 Piezoelectric Pressure Sensor
A basic piezoelectric pressure sensor cell is illustrated in Figure 3.14a.
The piezoelectric plate is mechanically connected to a pressure
sensing diaphragm that acts as a force summing device and creates a
stress in the plate. The diaphragm, in turn, is exposed to a gas
pressure that acts through a perforated cap. The cap protects the
sensor against dust, mechanical damage, and other hostile
environmental conditions. A change in pressure causes a mechanical
change in the piezoelectric plate, which results in a generation of
electric charge or voltage, which is then transferred out of the cell
using a shielded connector.
A commercial model of a pressure sensor is shown in Figure 3.14b [3].
Once a sensor has been designed and constructed, various sensor
parameters are usually supplied by the sensor manufacturer. An
example of a sensor parameter specification sheet is given in Table
3.7 [3].

Many applications exist for the stress/pressure sensor. Examples of
stress or force sensor applications include the measurement of
compression, tension, impact, vibrating, balancing, striking, rolling,
cutting, forming, pressing, machining, and punching operations.
Examples fo pressure sensor applications include gas pressure,
combustion, explosion, pulsation, actua-tion, cavitation, fluidic,

pneumatic, blast, turbulence, and sound pressure measurements.
Various advantages and disadvantages exist for the piezoelectric
stress/
pressure sensor. The advantages may be summarized as follows: 1.
Simple sensing mechanism, direct conversion of mechanical
quantities into electrical quantities

3.7 Piezoelectric Accelerometer
A piezoelectric sensor can also be used as a pressure sensor to
determine acceleration. The principle of operation of an accelerometer
is based on Newtonâs law, which states that an acceleration, a, that a
body acquires under an influence of a force, F, is the ratio of the force,
F, divided by its mass, M; therefore,
a = F/ M
(3.53)
Basically, an accelerometer measures a force for a known mass to
determine the acceleration.

(Please see color insert following page 146) (a) Cross section of a
piezoelectric accelerometer and (b) a commercial model. (Kistler
Instrumente AG, www.kistler.com. With permission.) As an example of
an acceleration force, consider driving an automobile and then
pressing suddenly on the gas. One notices that the driver will
experience a force pushing backwards. Similarly, if the brake is

applied, the driver will be forced forward and experience a
deceleration force.
A cross section of a typical accelerometer and an actual commerical
model are shown in Figure 3.15[4]. This accelerometer basically
consists of a piezoelectric crystal and a mass, M, which is restrained
by a hemispherical spring of very high stiffness. When the
accelerometer is set into a motion, the mass, M, acquires an
acceleration, a, which manifests itself as the inertia force, F
= Ma. This force acts on the crystal producing an output voltage
proportional to the force, F. Since the mass, M, is known, the output
voltage V 0 is proportional to the force and hence the acceleration
(see Equation 3.53) as follows:
V 0 = K 0 a
(3.54)
where K 0 is a proportionality constant called sensitivity.

The equivalent mechanical circuit in a piezoelectric accelerometer.
A typical experimentally measured frequency response curve for the
piezoelectric accelerometer is shown in Figure 3.16. The lower limit of
the useful range (~1 Hz) is a function of the charge leakage in the
piezoelectric element, the mounting methods, the limitations of the
signal conditioning systems, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The upper
frequency limit results from the existence of the natural resonant
frequency of the restraining spring of stiffness, K S, and the inertia

mass, M. The simple equivalent mechanical circuit for the mechanical
part of the accelerometer excluding the piezoelectric element is shown
in Figure 3.17, which consists of mass, M, and the spring with spring
constant, K S. The resonant frequency for the mechanical circuit may
be shown to be the following:

dimensions. (Kistler Instrumente AG, www.kistler.com.

f r = ( K S/ M).5
(3.55)
Typical values of M are in the range of several tens of grams, and K S

is of the order of 1010 N/M2, and hence f r is of the order of several
tens of kilohertz.
Therefore, the flat-band frequency response covers a wide range of
frequencies up to 5 KHz.
The acceleration is a vector quantity, so it has both magnitude and
direction.
The piezoelectric element in Figure 3.15 operates in the
compressional mode and will produce an output signal only when the
force or acceleration is normal to the element. Therefore, in order to
determine acceleration in space, one needs the three-dimensional
accelerometer, which is shown in Figure 3.18[5].
A typical specification sheet supplied by a manufacturer with a
piezoelectric accelerometer is given in Table 3.8[4].
The accelerometer sensitivity, K O, is commonly expressed in terms of
electrical voltage per unit acceleration. Noting that F = Ma, one can
deduce from Equation 3.48 that K O is defined as follows: K O = KM = (
eâSc/ C O) M
(3.56)
The sensitivity, K O, depends on the properties of the piezoelectric
material and the mass of the inertia element. If a large mass is used,
the force on the crystal will be large for a given acceleration, thus
generating a relatively large output signal. However, an accelerometer
with a large mass results in several disadvantages, which may be
summarized as follows: 1. The measurand (acceleration) is distorted if
the accelerometer mass is comparable to the mass of the moving
body.
2. A heavy accelerometer has a lower resonant frequency, and hence
a smaller useful frequency range.

0,113 Nm There are many applications for an accelerometer that relate
to measuring vibratory motion on heavy structures of machinery,
machine tools, engines, pumps, compressors, pipes, and presses.
The accelerometer can also be used for testing in aviation, space, and
automotive vehicles.
3.8 Active Piezoelectric Sensors
In contrast to the passive piezoelectric sensors such as the
stress/pressure sensor and the accelerometer, the active piezoelectric
sensors utilize an energy source such as a time-varying or AC voltage
to excite an acoustic wave. This wave then interacts actively with the
measurand of interest, and acoustic wave properties such as velocity,
attenuation, or frequency are used to monitor the measurand.
Before embarking on a discussion of various types of active
piezoelectric sensors, several of the more popular acoustic waves
used in sensing applications will be discussed. Perhaps the most
popular wave used in acoustic wave sensors is the bulk acoustic
wave. This wave is typically excited by an AC voltage and is
accompanied by both mechanical displacements and an electric field
or potential. The displacements associated with a bulk acoustic wave
may either be predominantly in the direction of propagation or
transverse to the direction of propagation. In the former case, the
wave is called a longitudinal acoustic wave. The displacements
associated with this wave are shown in Figure 3.19. Basically, the
medium alternately compresses and expands in the direction of wave
propagation. If the acoustic wave has displacements transverse to the
propagation direction it is called a shear wave.
The displacements associated with this wave are shown in Figure
3.20. In an actual piezoelectric crystal, there is one longitudinal

acoustic wave and two shear waves in a particular direction. This is
shown in Figure 3.21. The

longitudinal acoustic wave velocity is roughly twice the lowest shear
wave velocity. The shear wave velocities are quite close together, and
in some high-symmetry directions in crystals they are equal. Typical
bulk wave velocities for some common piezoelectric materials are
summarized in Table 3.9.
Another type of acoustic wave that has been utilized recently in sensor
applications is the surface acoustic wave (SAW). This electrically
excited acoustic wave propagates along the surface of the
piezoelectric material

and has both displacements and an electric potential or an electric
field associated with it. Figure 3.22 gives a schematic representation of
the displacements associated with the SAW. The SAW velocity is
typically slightly less than the lowest bulk shear wave velocity. This

type of wave has some distinct advantages over bulk waves. Perhaps
the most important is related to the fact that this wave travels along
the surface, thereby allowing it to have maximum interaction with a
measurand. In contrast, a bulk wave can only interact with the
measurand at the ends of a piezoelectric crystal.
Acoustic plate modes, which have also been suggested for sensor
applications, are similar to electromagnetic waveguide modes and
travel in the interior of the piezoelectric plate interacting with the
surface at discrete locations. Figure 3.23 describes a propagating
plate mode. These modes can have both longitudinally or transversely
polarized displacements with respect to their propagation direction.
Plate modes are uniquely different from bulk and surface acoustic
waves. In particular, one may excite a large number of plate modes,
while there is only one SAW or three bulk waves for a particular
direction in a crystal. The number of plate modes is dependent upon
the plate thickness and frequency of the excitation source.
Piezoelectric Sensors
113
Figure 3.23
Description of the propagation of a plate mode in a piezoelectric plate.
In terms of sensor applications, both bulk and plate modes can be
used in liquid and gas environments, whereas SAWs are usually used
only in gas environments. If a SAW is used in a fluid environment, it
will usually radi-ate much of its energy to the nearby fluid, and hence
the SAW will attenuate very quickly along the propagation direction.

An exception to this is a SAW, which has displacement components in
the surface plane of the piezoelectric crystal. This type of horizontally
polarized acoustic wave has been used in fluid sensing applications.
Unfortunately, this wave only exists in a few crystals in isolated
orientations.
3.9 Bulk Acoustic Wave Sensor
In a bulk acoustic wave sensor a resonant or standing wave is excited
by an AC voltage applied to a piezoelectric crystal. This wave must be
shear and therefore have displacement components that are purely
transverse to the propagation direction. The allowed wavelengths
associated with this wave are directly related to the crystal thickness,
t, as follows: Î»n = 2 t/ n
(3.57)
where n = 1, 3, 5â¦.
The displacements associated with n = 1 and 3 resonant shear waves
are shown in Figure 3.24. The n = 1 configuration is commonly called
the fundamental mode, and the n = 3, 5, â¦, configurations are referred
to as higher-order harmonics. Note that even though acoustic waves
with displacement components in the direction of propagation may be
excited, they will not be resonant in this structure. This is due to the
fact that energy will be leaked out at the crystal surfaces in the form of
longitudinal acoustic waves.
Before describing the details of using a piezoelectric crystal as an
acoustic wave sensing platform, methods of exciting the resonant
acoustic wave will be discussed. This wave may be excited with a
thickness field excitation (TFE) or a lateral field excitation (LFE). In the
case of the TFE, metal electrodes are deposited on the top and
bottom faces of the piezoelectric

crystal. These electrodes are vacuum deposited noble metals, usually
gold.
The exact configuration associated with the electrodes could be a gold
film on each crystal surface or a more complicated structure, each of
which is shown Figure 3.25. In both configurations an AC voltage is
applied to the electrodes, resulting in an electric field through the
piezoelectric crystalâ
hence the nomenclature TFE. The structure given in Figure 3.25b
requires a little elaboration. In this structure the electrical contact is
made only on the bottom crystal face since the top electrode goes
around the side of the crystal. Both of the structures shown in Figure
3.25 are commonly referred to as quartz crystal monitors (QCMs). The
QCM structure shown in Figure 3.24a is used to control processes
such as thin-film growth (integrated circuits
[IC] industry), liquid evaporation (paper industry), or bacteria growth
(bio-technology industry). In these applications the sensing platform is
typically located in a holder. The exact configuration shown in Figure
3.25b came about as result of many years of research relating to
obtaining a reproducible clean resonant signal as films were being
simultaneously deposited on the sensor platform and the substrate of
interest.
Lateral field excitation is another approach used to excite the
transverse shear mode. A significant amount of work relating to LFE
transducer configurations and their subsequent use as sensing
platforms has been done at the University of Maine (UM) [6â12]. In

this excitation, an AC voltage is applied to electrodes deposited on the
bottom crystal face, resulting in an electric field along the lateral
direction of the crystal. Two common types of LFE electrode patterns
are shown in Figure 3.26.
Very recently researchers at UM have examined a novel approach
using a photolithographically deposited spiral coil antenna to excite
resonant acoustic waves. This antenna configuration is shown in
Figure 3.27. An AC flows through the antenna radiating a time- and
frequency-dependent electric field in the piezoelectric crystal. This
electric field then excites the resonant acoustic wave.

At first glance one might be led to the conclusion that any orientation
of a piezoelectric crystal can be used to excite the purely transverse
shear mode.
This is not the case, and in fact, only certain orientations in
piezoelectric crystals can excite this wave. The most common
piezoelectric crystal and orientation is the AT-cut in quartz.
In this orientation only the pure transverse shear is excited using TFE
and LFE. The coupling to the other shear mode and the longitudinal
mode is zero.
This orientation has an additional advantage in that it is temperature
compensated, which means the acoustic properties such as velocity,
frequency, and displacement are independent of temperature over a
significant temperature range about room temperature. Orientations
do exist in other piezoelectric crystals for selective excitation of a
purely transverse shear mode, but they have not been exploited for
sensor applications.

(Please see color insert following page 146) Monolithic spiral coil
antenna configuration for the excitation of resonant acoustic waves in
a piezoelectric crystal.
The LFE and spiral coil antenna sensing platforms have distinctive
advantages over the TFE sensing platform in that the top sensing
surface is bare.
A bare top surface allows both mechanical displacements and electric
fields associated with the transverse shear mode to penetrate into the
adjacent medium or analyte selective film to sense both mechanical
and electrical properties. In addition, the spiral coil antenna allows
efficient excitation of very high-frequency (~GHz) acoustic waves,
which cannot be achieved using TFE or LFE transducers on a single
piezoelectric crystal. High-frequency acoustic waves have
wavelengths that may potentially probe measurands down to the
molecular level.

Once the resonant acoustic wave has been excited, the measurable
quantities are the resonant frequency and the electrical impedance.
The velocity of the resonant acoustic wave, v, is a function only of the
piezoelectric crystal properties and may be expressed as follows: Î½ =
fn Î» n
(3.58)
where fn = frequency of the resonant acoustic wave.
Substituting Equation 3.57 into Equation 3.58 allows the resonant
acoustic wave frequency to be written as follows:

C 0 is the electrostatic capacitance between the electrodes on the top
and bottom faces of the piezoelectric crystal. The L 1, C 1, and R 1
arm of the circuit is referred to as the motional arm. L 1 represents the
motional inductance, which is a measure of the inertia of the

oscillating crystal. C 1 represents the motional capacitance, which is
related to the elasticity or energy stored in the crystal. R 1 represents
the motional resistance and is a measure of the viscosity or energy
dissipation in the crystal. The circuit elements, L 1, C 1, and R 1, can
be shown to be a function of the material properties and thickness of
the piezoelectric crystal [13].
Although the LFE and spiral coil platforms have been used in several
sensing applications, no definitive equivalent circuit currently exists for
these platforms.
3.10 Bulk Acoustic Wave Sensor Response Measurement The
response of resonant bulk acoustic wave sensors to perturbations in
the environment is commonly measured in two ways. The acoustic
wave sensor can be utilized as the feedback element in a crystal-
controlled oscillator, where the frequency and voltage of the output
can be measured or the impedance of the acoustic wave sensor can
be measured using an impedance analyzer or network analyzer. The
advantage of the oscillator configuration is that the measurement
system is compact and well suited to remote or portable

sensing systems. However, it is possible to measure only two
parameters of the oscillator, voltage and frequency. Thus, it is not
possible to determine the origin of the response if the sensor is
responding to more than two analytes in the environment, or
responding to more than two property changes of a single analyte, i.e.,

viscosity, permittivity, and conductivity changes in a liquid. The
measurement of the impedance of the sensor will enable one to
determine more exactly the nature of the response. Unfortunately,
commercially available impedance analyzers are bulky and not well
suited to be remote or portable sensors.
A crystal-controlled oscillator consists of two fundamental parts: an
amplifier or gain circuit and a feedback network (Figure 3.29). The
acoustic wave sensor serves as the feedback network, providing
positive feedback at the frequency of oscillation [13]. The gain of the
amplifier is A, and the gain of the feedback element is Î². The two
criteria that must be met for the oscillator are that the loop gain, AâÎ²,
must be greater than unity, and that the total phase ÎA + ÎÎ² = 2 n Ï,
where n = 0, 1, 2, â¦ . The loop gain must be greater than unity so that
the signal level can increase to a usable level, where it is typically
adjusted via automatic gain control. The phase criterion is crucial in
sensor applications. This is due to the fact that since perturbations to
the measurement environment affect the sensor response, the phase
will change, resulting in a change to the frequency of oscillation. This
is measured at the output. Additionally, losses in the feedback
element due to perturbations in the measurement environment can be
measured as an attenuation to the output signal, V out.
Another method of measuring the sensor response of resonant
acoustic wave sensors is to directly measure the impedance using an
impedance analyzer. Changes to the impedance of the acoustic wave
sensor due to perturbations of the measurement environment can
then be stored and analyzed. In the case of the QCM whose
equivalent circuit is given in Figure 3.28, the change in impedance can
affect the series and parallel
120
Introduction to Sensors
resonant frequencies, the amplitudes and phases of both resonant
frequencies, and the Q of the sensor. Due to this, the use of an

impedance analyzer is preferred when the measurement environment
is complex, such as in liquids. In the case of the LFE sensor, the exact
equivalent circuit is yet to be determined. However, the Butterworthâ
Van Dyke circuit can be used as an approximation.
The TFE, spiral coil, and LFE platforms can be used as stand-alone
sensors or coated with a film that may be selective to a particular
chemical or biological measurand. The most common utilization of the
TFE platform as a stand-alone sensor is in thin-film deposition
systems. In this application a TFE
platform is usually referred to as a QCM. As indicated in the name,
quartz is the piezoelectric crystal that is used. Also, a very specific
crystallographic orientation in quartz is used, namely, the AT-cut. In
this orientation a purely transverse shear mode is excited and the
acoustic wave properties do not change appreciably near room
temperature. Typically in a deposition process the QCM is placed
close to the substrate upon which a deposition is taking place, and the
film is deposited on both the QCM and the substrate simultaneously.
The frequency of the fundamental resonant acoustic wave in the QCM
changes in the deposition process and is used to monitor the
thickness of the film deposited on the substrate. In particular, it may be
shown [14] that the relative change in frequency of the QCM, Î f/ fq, is
directly proportional to the mass of the film being deposited as follows:
M
â f f
f
= â
q
M

(3.60)
q
where M f = film mass, M q = quartz crystal mass, and f q = resonant
frequency of the bare QCM.
M f is a function of the QCM surface area, A, the film density, Ï f, and
thickn ess, hf , as follows:
M = Ï
f
f Ah f
(3.61)
Substituting Equation 3.61 into Equation 3.60 and solving for h f, one
obtains

where Î f = decrease in the QCM frequency.
Since Î f is measured and the other parameters in Equation 3.62 are
known, the thickness of the deposited film is directly proportional to

the decrease in the QCM frequency as follows:

The TFE, LFE, and spiral coil sensing platforms can also be used as
stand-alone sensors in a fluid environment. In this case the
measurand of interest is a fluid property, which includes density,
elasticity, viscosity, electrical conductivity, or permittivity. It is
important to point out that the resonant acoustic wave does not

propagate into the fluid, but rather the amplitudes of the mechanical
displacement and electric field decay exponentially into the fluid. The
decay rate and depth of penetration of the acoustic fields into the
adjacent fluid are functions of the fluid properties and the acoustic
wavelength. The resulting probing of the acoustic wave into the fluid
changes the resonant frequency of the acoustic wave.
Figures 3.30 to 3.32 present the variations of the frequency shifts for
selected mechanical and electrical fluid properties for different LFE
sensors and a QCM. The electrode configuration for LFE sensors is
the half-moon structure shown in Figure 3.26b with electrode gaps
varying from 1.5 to 3.5 mm. In Figure 3.30 the frequency is shown to
decrease as a function of NaCl solution in water. It is interesting to
point out that the QCM frequency does not change 0

concentration due to the fact that the electrode on the top surface
shields most of the electric field from penetrating into the adjacent
fluid. In Figure 3.31 the frequency is shown to increase as the relative
dielectric constant of a 2-propanol solution decreases for the LFE
sensor, while for the QCM a slight decrease in frequency is observed.
The QCM smaller frequency shift in a direction opposite to that of the
LFE sensor is due to the fact that in a 2-propanol solution the viscosity
increases with decreasing relative dielectric constant. Finally, in
Figure 3.32, the frequency is seen to decrease as the viscosity of the
water glycerol solution increases.
Again, notice that the changes observed for the LFE sensor are larger
than those observed for the QCM. This is most likely due to the bare
sensing surface in the LFE sensor, which allows the displacements
associated with the resonant acoustic wave to penetrate more deeply
into the adjacent fluid.
The bulk acoustic wave sensor can also be used to sense chemical
and biological targets if the sensing platform is coated with a film
selective to the target of interest. As an example of chemical sensing,
an LFE sensor and a QCM
are coated with a polymer, polyepichlorohydrin (PECH), which is
selective to phosmet, an organophosphate pesticide [7]. In Figure 3.33

the frequency shift from baseline due to successive additions of 10 Âµl
of phosmet solution in 200
ml of water is shown. The phosmet solution exposed to the LFE
sensor had a phosmet concentration of 1.3425 ppm, while for the
QCM, the concentration was 1.4917 ppm. It is interesting to point out
that the shifts observed for the LFE sensor were higher than those
observed for the QCM, even though the 10 Âµl injections for the QCM
contained a higher concentration level of phosmet. For biological

sensing an LFE device is coated with a multilayer biochemical film
(see Figure 3.34) selective to E. coli 0157:H7, the most dangerous

3.11 Surface Acoustic Wave Sensors In contrast to bulk acoustic
wave sensors the initial work in SAW
sensors was done in the late 1970s. Since that time a significant
amount of research was performed at the University of Maine on this
sensor for sensing inorganic and organic gases and biological
molecules. Whereas in the BAW sensor one makes use of bulk
acoustic waves, in the SAW sensor the wave of interest is the SAW.
SAWs are excited on the sensing surface of a piezoelectric crystal by
means of an interdigital (IDT) electrode configuration. Figure 3.36
shows a simple SAW device.
An AC voltage is applied to the IDT on the left side of the device, and
each adjacent IDT finger has opposite polarity at a particular instant of
time. The alternating electric field between the metal electrodes, which
are usually aluminum, excites an alternating stress on the crystal
surface. If the electrode spacings are a half wavelength apart, the
alternating stress will cause the wavelets excited between adjacent
fingers to add in phase, resulting in the propagation of a SAW. The
appropriate electrode spacing can be determined by the excitation
frequency, f, and the known SAW velocity, V SAW, which is a function

of the piezoelectric material constants and the crystallographic
orientation. In particular, the electrode spacing, d, is as follows: V
d
SAW
= 2 f
(3.64)
Given the size of single crystals, the limits of photolithography, and the
SAW
velocity, the frequency of SAW devices varies from about 50 MHz to 1
GHz.
If one places an amplifier in the feedback loop of the SAW device to
compensate for losses in propagation, excitation, and reception, one
has a simple SAW
oscillator or resonator. Any material or foreign substance that comes
in contact with the surface between the IDTs will modify the SAW
velocity. Since d is fixed, one can see from Equation 3.64 that f
changes. The change in SAW frequency then becomes a function of
the amount of substance on the surface.
The common SAW sensor configuration [15] consists of two identical
SAW
devices fabricated on a single piezoelectric substrate, as shown in
Figure 3.37.

Schematic representation of the dual-delay line SAW sensor.
The SAW device, which has a sensing film deposited between the
electrodes, is called the sensing device, whereas the other SAW
device is called the reference device. In this so-called dual-delay line
configuration, changes in the material properties of the piezoelectric
substrate due to environmental effects such as temperature are
eliminated. If one used only a single device and tried to operate the
device over a specified range, the change in frequency would be a
function of not only the sensing film changes due to the sorption of a
target analyte, but also the change in SAW velocity over the
temperature range of interest.
The complete measuring system for monitoring the difference
frequency of the SAW sensing element is shown in Figure 3.38. The
feedback amplifiers create the oscillating loops with the SAW delay
lines, while the directional couplers in the loop allow the signals to be
measured without interfering with the loops. The outputs from the
directional couplers are connected to the inputs of a double balanced
mixer, which multiplies the sinusoidal wave-forms and outputs a signal
containing the sum frequency of ( fr + fs ) and the difference frequency
o f ( fr â fs ). The low-pass filter allows the difference frequency to pass
while blocking the sum frequency. The frequency counter then
measures only the difference frequency and transmits it to a computer
where it is displayed and monitored.
In order to illustrate the performance of the dual-delay line sensor
configuration, the sensing path of a Y-cut Z-propagating LiNbO3
crystal was coated with a WO3 film and exposed to hydrogen sulfide.

The response of the sensor is shown in Figure 3.39. Notice that the
change in frequency is almost 600 Hz, which is very large since the
measurement accuracy for frequency changes is typically in the single
hertz range. One can clearly see that even though the SAW
sensor is more complex than a bulk wave sensor, it does offer high
sensitivity.

fibers that can be as small as a human hair. The light, which is
electromagnetic waves, can have a wide range of frequencies ranging
from megahertz (106 cps) to the high gigahertz (109 to 1013 cps). The
fact that different frequency light waves can be transmitted through
these fibers allows one to transmit a tremendous amount of
information. It is not uncommon to have bundles of fibers (100 or
more) in a single fiber optic link. It is not surprising that fiber optic links
have immediate application in transmission of data from one point to
another. Fiber optic links may transmit energy over both short
distances (~1 m) and long distances (5 Ã 103 km or greater). Relative
to short distances, common applications are networking computers

within an office or industry, while for long distances, transatlantic fiber
optic links are used for telephone communications. Another very
important application for optical fibers is the area of sensors. These
sensors can be used for applications ranging from probing the human
body to determining structural flaws in bridges and buildings. More
details relating to sensor applications are discussed later.
4.2 Background
The first work relating to the transmission of light from one point to
another in a controlled fashion can be traced back to the late 1800s.
William Wheeler used light from an electric arc lamp placed in the
basement of his house to direct light around the house using a system
of pipes [1]. The pipes had reflective linings and diffuse optics to
facilitate the transmission of the light waves. Wheelerâs invention
relating to piping light is documented in U.S.
Patent 247,229 (1880). Figure 4.1 describes the piping light system
developed by Wheeler.

Figure 4.1
Piping light system.
The piping light system, although functional, was not completely
successful due to nonideal reflecting surfaces in the pipe.
The next serious attempt at using light piping did not appear until the
1950s. This work was motivated by the fact that if a piping light system
could be realized, a tremendous amount of data could be transmitted
from one point to another through pipes. One of the major obstacles to
light piping was the development of a transmission system. Research
began to focus on

the use of glass fibers as the transmission material. However, many
problems had to be resolved relative to the glass fiber. First, one had
to be certain that the light energy did not leak out of the fiber. Second,
the fiber had to be mechanically strong so that environmental factors
would not alter the fiber properties. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2.
When there is no coating around the fiber other than air, surface
impurities and surface roughness can cause light energy to leak. If,
however, a coating is applied to the fiber, it may be possible to
minimize the leakage.
Researchers tried a wide range of coatings, such as beeswax, plastic,
and margarine, for the fibers. Finally, in 1956, a University of Michigan
undergraduate student by the name of Larry Curtis proposed a glass-
clad fiber that consisted of melting a low-index glass onto a high-index
glass

[2]. This combination for the fiber quickly became the standard for
fiber optic links.
The development of the glass-clad fibers clearly opened the door for
fiber optic technology; however, several other important questions
needed to be resolved before fiber optics became accepted as a
standard. It was recognized that light could not be transmitted over
long distances even though it did not leak out of the optical fiber. The
light was being scattered in the fibers and also absorbed by impurities
in the glass fiber. The scattering was attributed to structural
abnormalities in the fiber, such as polycrystalline boundaries and
voids. The absorption was due to impurities that were embedded in
the fiber. The light energy was being absorbed by the impurities and
excited vibrational modes in the impurity molecules, which resulted in
the heating of the fiber. Some of the work in this area was done by
Charles Kao and George Hockman, who were research scientists at
Corning Glass [3]. Finally Air

Introduction to Sensors
in 1970, Corning Glass was able to produce low-loss optical fibers that
lost only 10% of the light over a distance of 30 miles. The question of
efficient light generation and reception still needed to be addressed in
order to realize a viable fiber optic communication system. The
invention of the laser in 1960
solved the question of light sources. Light could now be efficiently
generated over a wide range of frequencies. It was determined that
electrons in various materials could be excited to levels above their
ground state. When these electrons dropped from their excited states
they emitted quanta of light energy at characteristic frequencies. The
emitted energy can be described by Planckâs relation:
E = hf
(4.1)
where h = Planckâs constant and f = frequency.
By using different varieties of material it was then determined that the
lasers could emit light covering a wide frequency range. The question
of light reception was solved when silicon technology in the 1960s
resulted in the realization of photodetectors. In these photodetectors
the arriving light excites electrons in the silicon into the conduction
band. They in turn cause a current to appear in the semiconductor.
This current is often referred to as photo-excited current. Lasers,
photodetectors, and improved fibers resulted in the realization of fiber
optics as a viable technology for data transmission.
4.3 Theory

To completely describe the theory of excitation, transmission, and
reception of light in fiber optic links requires a background in solid-
state physics and electromagnetics. Light must be interfaced into the
individual fiber. This is often done using lasers that can be tuned to
transmit light at very specific frequencies. The light then propagates in
the fiber optic links as modes. In order to determine whether the light
will propagate in the fiber, one must realize that the fiber is a
waveguiding structure. Therefore, one must use Maxwellâs equations
and solve the equations subject to the appropriate boundary
conditions. This problem is more difficult than the traditional
rectangular waveguide problem that is normally treated in
undergraduate electromagnetic courses. In the fiber optic link the
cladding on the glass fiber is not a perfect conductor. Therefore, the
electromagnetic boundary conditions require the continuity of electric
and magnetic fields at the glass-cladding interface. One also realizes
that if the fiber is bent, it is possible for some of the light energy to be
transmitted into the cladding. This obviously contributes to loss and
corresponds to the light energy being leaked

Fiber Optic Sensors
135
into the cladding. This point is discussed in more detail later. The
geometry of the glass fiber further complicates the mathematics in that
the problem cannot be readily treated in rectangular coordinates but
must be treated in cylindrical coordinates. Although involved, this
problem can be solved and the propagating modes and their
appropriate frequencies identified. Finally, the light energy must be
received and appropriately processed. The light energy is received
using an array of photodetectors. In this case, the light energy
impinges on a semiconducting material and electrons are excited into
the conduction band, giving rise to a current that is then measured. In
order to fully understand the solid-state and electromagnetic theory
associated with fiber optics, one should have at least one course on

solid-state physics and two courses in electromagnetics, one relating
to basic electromagnetic theory and the second relating to microwave
theory. This is normally beyond the scope of most undergraduate
students.
Fiber optics can fortunately be described in a qualitative sense.
Normally light travels in a straight line, as it does in free space.
Confining light within a prescribed structure will allow more direct
point-to-point communications. Also, light need not propagate in a
straight line. However, one has to be careful that the bending in the
fiber is not too great; otherwise, light energy will leak out.
4.4 Light Leaking and Absorption in the Fiber Optic Link Two very
important topics that need to be addressed relative to the materials
used in a fiber optic link are leaking and absorption. Leaking can be
described using basic electromagnetics. It is necessary that total
internal reflection occurs when the light is incident from the glass fiber
onto the cladding. This may be illustrated by referring to Figure 4.3.

same, and therefore Î¸i = Î¸r . )
136

Introduction to Sensors
In order for no leakage of light to occur, Î¸t must be equal to 90Â°. This
may be explained using Snellâs law, which is given as follows: Î¸ =
Î¸
k f sin i kc sin t
(4.2)
where
k = Ï Âµ Îµ
f

and
k = Ï Âµ Îµ

The terms Î¼ c and Î¼ f are the permeabilities of the two media, and Îµc
and Îµf are permittivities of the two media. Total internal reflection starts
when Î¸t = 90Â°. Therefore, the transition angle, Î¸ic, for total internal
reflection from Equation 4.2 becomes

In this case the light wave travels along the interface between the fiber
and the cladding. When Î¸i > Î¸ic there is no light wave propagating into
the cladding. An exponential decay occurs for the electromagnetic
fields associated with the light wave in the cladding. In this case the
wave is said to be evanescent into the cladding. In nonmagnetic
materials Î¼ c â Î¼ f; therefore, from Equation 4.3 one obtains for internal
reflection to be possible the following condition:
Îµ <

Îµ F
(4.4)

Absorption of light energy occurs when light interacts with impurity
molecules in the glass exciting a vibrational mode in the fiber. This
may be described using the water molecule as an example. In Figure
4.4 an electromagnetic wave (light wave) is incident on a water
molecule.
The electric and magnetic fields have a harmonic variation with time.
Therefore, at one instant of time the field may be oriented as shown in
the Figure 4.4, and at the next incident of time, oriented in the opposite
direction.
Since electric fields go from plus to minus, this may cause a motion of
the

H atoms in the water molecule. It is well known that a resonant
âwaggingâ
mode exists for the hydrogen atom in which the hydrogen atoms move
back and forth at a characteristic resonant frequency. If the light
energy is at that frequency, the light energy is then absorbed by the
water molecule, causing the wagging mode to be excited. Molecular
absorption typically occurs in the 1011 to 1013 cps frequency range. In
addition to energy loss, this will lead to localized heating in the glass.

Similar arguments may be made for other impurity atoms in the glass
that occur at different frequencies. Therefore, in order to minimize
absorption effects, the number of impurities in the fiber must be
minimized.
In addition to leaking and absorption, losses also occur due to
structural effects and voids. Ideally the silica fibers should be
amorphous and have no void regions. However in the growth of the
fiber heating and cooling occur resulting in the formation of
polycrystallites. Polycrystallite boundaries and interfaces with the
amorphous glass (silica) along with voids give rise to additional loss.
In order to overcome material losses repeaters are used at regular
spacing intervals. The repeaters amplify the light waves, recovering
some of the material losses. The principle of the repeaters is similar to
that used in coaxial transmission lines, except that they operate at
much higher frequencies.
4.5 Fiber Link and Materials
The cross section of an optical fiber is shown in Figure 4.5. The
thickness and dielectric properties of the fiber and cladding often
determine the

specific application. Large fiber diameters relative to cladding
thickness are good for illumination applications. On the other hand, for
communication purposes the reverse is true: the optical fiber
thickness is much smaller than the cladding thickness. The fiber may
also have a graded dielectric constant, which is defined as a dielectric
constant that changes linearly into cladding rather than a constant
dielectric constant. This is often used to eliminate an abrupt boundary,
which can result in aging problems. The actual diameter of the fiber
may range from less than 100 microns to much larger sizes,
depending upon the application. The normal material used in the
cladding is glass (SiO2), which has been doped with impurities so as
to achieve a graded dielectric constant. In some cases plastics are
used in order to obtain more flexibility in the fiber. Fiber optic links are
often described as being similar to monofilament fishing line.
4.6 Communication Applications
Fiber optic links can be used to communicate both images and data.
Each fiber can be used to carry one point of an image from one end of
the fiber to the other. A bundle of fibers can then transmit a color
image of a particular object over a long distance. In particular, the
intensity and frequency of the received optical signals yield
information concerning the color, size, and shape of the object. This
technology is currently being exploited in an attempt to realize
âpictureâ phones. The communication of data from one point to
another can be represented as a block diagram (see Figure 4.6).
When one uses many light sources operating at different frequencies
and interfaces them to fibers and a receiver, a fiber optic

communication system results.
Note that if the receiver and transmitter were both at the same end of
the system, we would have an imaging system. In this case light is
reflected from the probe area and returned to the transmitting location.
This is illustrated in Figure 4.7. By analyzing the returned light one can
obtain very

useful information regarding the probe area. Fiber optic imaging
systems are often used to image abnormalities in the human body. In
the fiber optic communication system shown in Figure 4.6, large
amounts of data can be transmitted from one point to another using
bundles of individual fibers.
In the system, however, alignment is critical with both the transmitter
and receiver. Therefore, connectors and splicers must be carefully
designed.
At this point it is appropriate to summarize the advantages of fiber
optic systems:
â¢ Carry a large amount of information over both short and long
distances at high speeds

â¢ Transmit both digital and analog signals
â¢ Are noise-free and cheap if fiber optic links properly designed
Specific applications include:
â¢ Land and sea long-haul communications (e.g., submarine cables,
telephone networks, Internet transmission systems)
â¢ Short-haul communications (e.g., local area networks [LANs])
â¢ Picture phones
â¢ Imaging of objects and abnormalities
â¢ Use of fiber optics in treating diseases and performing surgery 140
Introduction to Sensors
In regard to the latter, treating diseases and performing microsurgery
internally in the human body is possible by increasing the intensity of
the light.
4.7 Fiber Optic Sensors
Previous sections have discussed how fiber optic technology has
affected many different areas. However, the most logical question that
one may ask is: âIs it possible to use fiber optic technology to realize
real-world sensors?â

The following sections will demonstrate that indeed fiber optic sensors
can be realized. Previously, we have seen how modifications in
current or resistance can be used in metal oxide semiconducting
sensors, and modifications in acoustic waves can be used in acoustic
wave sensors. In a likewise fashion, modifications in light can be used
in fiber optic sensors. This becomes clear when specific applications
are examined.
4.7.1 Fiber Optic Probes
Light impinging upon a candidate area or volume can yield very useful
information. Fiber optic probes are often used in assembly line
sensing. This is illustrated in Figure 4.8.
In a very simple sensing application, blockage or transmission of the
light would indicate whether the assembly part is present or absent.
The imaging of an object may also be obtained using a bundle of
fibers. In this case Input

particular parts that do not meet specifications can be identified and
removed from the production line.
Relative to sensors, the most important application is imaging within
the human body. In this case the light reflects from the target region in
the human body and is sent back to a receiver. The received light is
then analyzed to determine features of the target region. If specific
coatings are placed at the end of a fiber optic link, numerous other
applications can be envisioned. In particular, internal physical
parameters such as temperature and pressure may be determined. If
the coatings were made to be specific to certain ions, molecules, or
gases, internal sensing diagnostics could be performed. The target
measurand would sorb the light, causing variations in reflected light
signals, which can then be analyzed to determine the type of
measurand within the target area in the human body. Since the
individual fibers are so small, they may be used nondestructively in
areas such as the stomach, heart, lung, and brain.

Fiber optic sensors are also very commonly used to obtain information
about target regions in structures that are very difficult to access. For
example, internal cracks and voids can be discovered by probing the
area of interest using fiber optic probes. In this case, nondestructive
evaluation of weaknesses in various types of structures can be
uncovered. Another interesting application relates to a liquid-level
sensor to determine levels of chemicals or any other type of fluid in a
tank . A liquid-level sensor is shown in Figure 4.9. The actual sensor
consists of an input and an output fiber interfaced with a prism. In
Figure 4.9a, the light is totally reflected into the output fiber, whereas in
the second case, shown in Figure 4.9b, the light is lost to the liquid.
This is due to the fact that the liquid has different reflection
characteristics than air. In the air case total internal reflection occurs,
whereas the different value of the liquid dielectric constant causes the
light to propagate into the liquid, consequently never reaching the
output fiber.
Fiber optic sensors to determine accurate temperatures are yet
another example. In this case ultraviolet (UV) light is transmitted in a
fiber that has a glass blob at the end. The glass blob contains
phosphor, and the light at different wavelengths stimulates
fluorescence in the glass blob.
The amount of fluorescence at different wavelengths changes with
temperature. The fiber collects the light and transmits it to an optical
analyzer that compares intensities at different wavelengths, and
therefore measures temperature.
Another fiber optic application utilizes the fact that outside influences
in the fiber can directly affect light transmission and reflection. In
contrast to fiber links, which are used in communications in which the
fibers are designed to be isolated from the environment, fibers can be
designed to respond strongly to their environment. In this case one
has a fiber optic sensor. The coatings on the fiber can be doped with

materials that change their index of refraction with temperature,
pressure, or other types of

environments, like gases, etc. In this case fiber optic links can
measure changes in light intensity, polarization, and phase.

Fiber optic links are also very cheap and can be installed within a
structure when it is being built. For example, fibers imbedded in a
bridge structure can be used to detect cracks. If the material remains
intact, the fiber continues to transmit light. However, when a crack
occurs the light is no longer transmitted and indicates that close
examination of structural integrity is perhaps needed. Another
example is a microbending sensor, which can detect degrees of
bending. This is illustrated in Figure 4.10.
Under no bending the light output is high. However, when bending
occurs the light output gets lower and, eventually, under heavy
bending reaches a very low level.
Another example of a fiber optic sensor relates to a magnetic field
sensor.
The appropriate geometry is presented in Figure 4.11.
The unknown magnetic field may be in or out of the plane of the paper.
Although it is possible to solve the out-of-plane problem, the present
treatment relates to an in-plane unknown magnetic field. If the original
light intensity is I i and the output intensity is I O, the ratio I O/ I i for
two different input light intensities will enable one to measure the
unknown magnetic

on the most common sensors. One also could design a specific fiber
optic sensor to detect a particular measurand.
Finally, one use of fiber optic sensors has led to the identification of
structures with sensors called smart structures or smart skins. The
former refers to the case when the sensor is embedded in a structure,
while the latter refers to the sensor being on the surface or skin of a
structure. These sensors can monitor the general health of the
structure in a number of different ways.
These include the following:
1. Monitor fabrication and curing of a composite
2. Monitor temperature to ascertain that curing conditions meet
requirements
3. Monitor strain
4. Monitor cracks to identify serious stress problems 5. Use fiber optic
sensors for monitoring structural integrity in aircraft wings, dams,
buildings, bridges, ships, etc.

In conclusion, an obvious question one may ask is: âWhat type of
sensor is betterâmetal oxide semiconductor sensor, acoustic sensor,
or fiber optic sensor?â In order to answer that question intelligently,
one must carefully examine sensor specifications such as sensitivity,
selectivity, etc., peculiar to the particular measurand of interest. Only
after an exhaustive study of the needs is made may one say one type
of sensor is more suitable than another.

Thermal Sensors
5.1 Introduction
The most popular sensor in terms of market surveys and sales is the
temperature sensor. This sensor is used in a wide range of
applications critical to the medical, agricultural, industrial, and
automotive communities, to name just a few. The particular application
may range from measuring temperature within a furnace where
accuracies of 10Â°C may be sufficient to the measurement of
temperature associated with tumors, where accuracies of less than
.01Â°C are necessary.
The different variety of temperature sensors cover a wide range, the
most popular being the resistance thermometer, thermistors,
thermocouples, and radiation thermometers. Other, less common
varieties include acoustic thermometers, dielectric constant
thermometers, refractive index thermometers, and quartz crystal
thermometers. The obvious thermometer missing from this list is the
mercury thermometer, which has been banned. This type of
thermometer has generally not been used significantly for the
accurate measurement of temperature. Each of these thermometers
depends upon a particular technology for its operation. These
technologies are typically based on such broad areas as solid state,
electromagnetics, acoustics, and optics.

Recent advances in microfabrication technology have enabled the
realization of miniature temperature sensors that are extremely
sensitive and stable.
5.2 Resistance Thermometers
This type of thermometer is the oldest and was first introduced by
Ohm in 1827. He realized that the resistance of metals increased in a
quasi-linear fashion with temperature. The first commercially available
thermometer based on the variation of metal resistance with
temperature appeared in 1871, when Von Siemens developed a
pyrometer for furnaces by winding a .1 mm platinum wire on porcelain
inside an iron tube. As a result of this work, it was 147

realized that platinum was an excellent metal to use for a resistance
thermometer. Callendar, in 1877, formalized the platinum resistance
thermometer (PRT) as a stand-alone instrument to be used in a
Wheatstone Bridge configuration. Platinum remained the most
popular metal for the resistance thermometer in the 1900s and to this
day remains the most popular. Other metals were suggested in the
early 1930s. These include nickel, UO2, MgTiO3, germanium,
rhodium/iron, copper, and iridium. Each had particular applications.
For example, germanium and rhodium/iron were used for low-
temperature (less than 20Â° K) applications; nickel, UO2, and MgTiO3
were used as cheap alternatives to platinum; copper was used in
oceanographic studies; and iridium was used for surface temperature
applications in industrial processes. Many of these resistance
thermometers operated over a variety of temperature ranges, as
shown in Table 5.1. The most versatile in terms of accuracy, linearity,
and stability, however, was the PRT.
5.3 Theory of Metal-Based Thermometers Experimental
measurements clearly show that the resistance thermometers that
use metals display an increase in resistance as temperature
increases.
This behavior is shown in Figure 5.1 for copper, nickel, platinum, and
tungsten. It is convenient to define the temperature dependence of
these metals by the temperature coefficient of resistance: dR

where R = resistance in ohms, and T = temperature in ÂºK.
For the data shown in Figure 5.1, TCR ranges between 3.9 Ã 10â3 and
6.5 Ã
10â10 Kâ1. Generally it is observed that the behavior of the resistance
is quasi-linear in this range.

In order to explain why the resistance in metals increases with
temperature, the metal must be modeled at the microscopic level.
Basically the metal consists of ion cores immersed in a sea of
electrons. The number of free electrons in the metal does not vary with
temperature and is a constant. The only parameters that can vary with
temperature are the motion of the electrons and the vibrations of the
ion cores. As temperature increases, the electron motion increases
and the electrons collide with themselves and the vibrating ion cores.
Since the electrons are much smaller than the ion cores, one can
neglect electron-electron collisions. The major contribution is therefore
due to the electrons colliding with the vibrating ion cores. This is
illustrated in Figure 5.2, where a simplified two-dimensional lattice is
presented that shows the areas occupied by static ion cores (solid)
and vibrating ion cores (dotted). One can clearly see that the increase
in area occupied by the vibrating cores with increasing temperatures
increases the probability of collisions. Mathematically the electrical
conductivity of a metal sample may be expressed as follows: Ï = ne Î¼
(5.2)
where n = electron density, e = electronic charge, and Î¼ = electron
mobility.

In a pure intrinsic material with no defects, the only collisions
(excluding electron-electron collisions) occur between electrons and
vibrating ion cores.
However, defects such as vacancies, impurity atoms, dislocations,
and grain boundaries also occur in a real material. These defects add
to the resistance of the metal and can be incorporated into Ï as

Theoretically, the evaluation of each of the Ïi terms is a complicated
process requiring knowledge of the allowed vibrational spectrum of
the metal along with the contribution introduced by the defects.
5.4 Properties of Metal-Based Thermometers The most common
material used in metal thermometers is platinum.
PRTs typically have a resistance range between .1 Î© and 1 KÎ©.
Although platinum is expensive, new processing techniques have
made it very attractive. In particular, platinum can be drawn into very
thin wires of high purity. The wires can be less than .05 mm in
diameter and the purity greater than 99.99%. Also, platinum can be
easily deposited using high-vacuum deposition or radio frequency
(RF) magnetron sputtering. This results in much smaller volume and
mass for a given resistance, which is critical in forming thick and thin
film sensors. The thermal expansion of platinum is also well matched
to insulating substrates such as silica, alumina, and sapphire. This

results in minimum strain at the platinum-substrate interface, hence
minimizing the possibility of the film disadhering with increasing
temperatures.
Depending upon the particular application, platinum thermometers
can exist in a variety of geometries, such as long wires, coiled wires,
serpentine films, etc. An example of one such geometry is the long-
stem thermometer shown in Figure 5.3 [2]. Researchers in the
Laboratory for Surface Science and Technology at the University of
Maine have developed a serpentine platinum heater that is used in
semiconducting gas sensors. In this sensor, a gas-sensitive oxide film
is deposited on a sapphire substrate and a serpentine platinum film is
deposited on the back side of a sapphire substrate. When a voltage is
applied to the serpentine platinum film it heats the substrate to Figure

a temperature that is appropriate for the target gas-film interactions to
take place. A diagram and photo of this heater are shown in Figure
5.4.
Other, less popular metal resistance thermometers use copper (Cu),
iridium (Ir), or combinations of rhodium and cobalt (Rh-Co) or platinum
and cobalt (Pt-Co). The Cu thermometer is the most linear, but it has a
limited temperature range (0 to 100Â°C) . The Ir thermometer provides
an excellent match to aluminum substrates and is normally used as a
thin film in surface temperature measurements. Rh-Co and Pt-Co are
used primarily for low-temperature (.5 to 30 K) applications.
5.5 Theory of Semiconductor-Based Thermometers Thermometers
that use semiconductors as the sensing element differ from metal-
based thermometers in that the resistance decreases with increasing
temperature. Also, in contrast to metals, the free electron density in
semiconductors is not constant but increases with temperature. Also,
semiconductors have vacancies called holes, whose concentration
also increases with temperature. In an intrinsic

(pure) semiconductor the electron and hole densities ( n and p) can be
represented as follows: 2Ï

The resulting conductivity is then given by the following equation: e( n

Ï =

approximate Equation 5.11 as follows:
Ï = (

1 A e B T
or
(5.12)
Ï = AeB T
Examination of Equation 5.12 reveals that as temperature increases
the resistance decreases.
Semiconductors can also be doped with either donors or acceptors. In
the case of the former, the electron density increases significantly,
resulting in an n-type semiconductor, whereas in the latter, the hole
density increases, resulting in a p-type semiconductor. In the doped
semiconductor the carrier concentrations increase with temperature,
resulting in a behavior similar to that observed for the intrinsic
semiconductor.
Thermometers that use semiconductors are thermally sensitive
resistors, or what is commonly called thermistors. The semiconductors
used in thermistors are not the common semiconductors such as
silicon or gallium arsenide.
Typically thermistors use metal oxides or combinations of metal
oxides.
These materials typically have oxygen vacancies resulting in
compounds such as MOnâx. When x = 0 the oxide is said to be
stoichiometric; therefore, for each metal ion, M, there are n oxygen
ions. However, normally x is not exactly zero but a very small number,
resulting in n â x oxygen atoms on an average associated with each
metal ion. For example, in the case of tungsten trioxide, n would be 3

and x roughly about .001 or less. In this case, the tungsten ions without
three oxygen atoms would have very loosely bound electrons, which
upon application of temperature become free, resulting in the metal
oxide being n-type.
Examples of metal oxides that are used in thermistors are the oxides
of tungsten manganese, nickel, cobalt, iron, copper, lithium,
magnesium, and chromium. The most stable mixed metal oxides are
Mn-Ni and Mn-Ni-Co.
5.6 Thermistor Properties
Thermistors typically have resistance between 10 Î© and 100 MÎ©. Due
to the large resistance range, thermistors provide excellent sensitivity
and are also very stable, particularly between 100 and 300Â°C.
Thermistors can also be manufactured very cheaply. The two
commonly used thermistors are the bead type and the disc type. In the
bead type one starts with a platinum

155
wire that is drawn or stretched. Small blobs of metal oxide are then
attached with a binder at intervals along the wire. The wire is then
sintered at about 1,300Â°C to produce a series of thermistors with
embedded leads. The platinum wire is then cut on each side of the
metal oxide thermistor, and the resulting individual thermistors are
coated with a protective coating (glass).
This results in a large number of thermistors with embedded leads that
can be used as temperature sensors. In the disc type thermistor the
metal oxide in powder form is compressed and heated to about
1,100Â°C to form a disc.
Silver is then deposited on the opposite sides of the disc by spraying,
screen printing, vacuum deposition, or RF magnetron sputtering. The

disc can then be diced to form several individual thermistors.
Comparing the two techniques, the bead type thermistors are the most
durable and the cheapest to produce. Finally, for applications greater
than 1,000Â°C thermistors made with zirconium oxide are the most
popular. Zirconium is unique in its ability to withstand high
temperatures.
Another application for thermistors is in heat switches. Often at a
particular temperature it is necessary to switch or truncate some
ongoing process. Thermistors that exhibit large resistance changes
over a very small temperature range can be used in these
applications. Barium/strontium/titanate is an excellent oxide for
switches since it can change its resistance by three orders of
magnitude over a few tenths of a degree cen-tigrade in the
temperature range from 15Â° to 115Â°C. This resistance normally is
related to ferroelectricity, and the temperature at which it occurs is
related to the barium/strontium ratio. Hence, one can configure a heat
switch anywhere in the range of 15 to 115Â°C by a judicious choice of
the Ba/Sr ratio.
5.7 Concluding Remarks
In conclusion, a significant amount of research has been done on
thermal sensors. Microfabrication techniques such as RF magnetron
sputtering and photolithography have resulted in the realization of very
small, accurate, and stable temperature sensors. The temperature
range for these sensors is from about 1Âº K to over 1,200Â°C. Also, the
sensors can be used either as temperature sensors or heat switches.
Many of the temperature sensors can be pur-chased off the shelf or
can be readily designed by the user for a particular application.

Magnetic Sensors
6.1 Introduction
Perhaps one of the first sensors used by man was a compass, which
is essentially a magnetic sensor. The compass needle, which is steel,
aligns itself with the earthâs magnetic field lines and points toward the
north. The compass became very important from about 1200 A.D.
onward and was critical in guiding many explorers on both land and
sea. At that time the production of the magnetic material (steel)
suitable for compass needles was kept a close secret.
Christopher Columbus in his many transatlantic voyages was known
to have a compass to guide his ships. Even prior to the compass,
wildlife such as birds and fish have used the earthâs magnetic field to
guide them in their migration patterns. Although little is known about
the exact internal sensor inherent in birds and fish such as geese,
salmon, and eels, their migration patterns have been known to
fluctuate due to subtle changes in the earthâs magnetic field. In regard
to Atlantic salmon, it has been postulated that they can sense not only
the direction but also the magnitude of the earthâs magnetic field,
which allows them to return to their place of birth.
In 1820 Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire deflected a
compass needle, essentially initiating the age of electromagnetism.

Oerstedâs work was followed by several fundamental laws of
electromagnetism, such as the Biot-Savart law, Faradayâs law of
induction, Gaussâs law, and Ampereâs law. In 1862 these observed
physical laws were put together by Maxwell and resulted in what is
commonly called Maxwellâs equation. These equations basically form
the backbone of electrical engineering in that all the fundamental
circuit and power relations along with the theory behind light waves
and microwaves can be obtained and explained by Maxwellâs
equations. The formalization of the area of electromagnetics soon
resulted in the development of a wide range of sensors associated
with the laws and effects of magnetic or electromagnetic fields.

Introduction to Sensors
6.2 Natural and Man-Made Magnetic Fields The most common
natural magnetic field is the earthâs, which varies depending upon
where you are located. For example, the magnitude of the earthâs
magnetic field is about 0.5 A/cm at the poles and 0.25

A/cm at the equator.
With the aid of sensors placed in satellites, we can very accurately
map the exact direction and magnitude of the earthâs magnetic field.
On a much smaller scale humans are also known to produce small
magnetic fields. These fields are caused by microcurrents in the heart,
brain, and muscle tissue. The fields can be determined by attaching
electrodes to the skin and measuring the voltage drop. This technique
forms the basis for the electrocardiogram (ECG).
Magnetic fields may also be produced by man. For example, sources
such as overhead electrical transmission lines and transformers can
produce magnetic fields ranging from 0.1 to 104 A/cm. These fields no
doubt have an effect on animals and human beings living near power
lines since electrical currents exist in both. As to whether these effects
are dangerous to health is a matter that has been debated by
scientists for several years. Higher magnetic fields in the range of 102
to 105 A/cm can also be created using conventional or
superconducting coils. The range of possible natural and man-made
magnetic fields is presented in Figure 6.1 [1].

6.3 Materials Used in Magnetic Sensors Magnetic sensors use both
nonmagnetic and magnetic materials. The most common
nonmagnetic materials in use are semiconductors, which include
silicon, GaAs, and other lesser known group II-VI and III-V
semiconductors.
The magnetic materials used most commonly are iron based and are
commonly called ferromagnetic materials.

In order to understand the nature of ferromagnetic materials, a brief
background on materials stressing their magnetic properties will be
given. All atoms consist of electrons revolving around the nucleus of
the atom. Since electrons in motion are essentially current, electrons
revolving around the nucleus can be approximated as a current loop.
It may be shown that this current loop is equivalent to the magnetic
dipole, as shown in Figure 6.2.
Obviously due to the number of electrons revolving around the
nucleus the resulting magnetic dipoles may add constructively or
destructively dividing materials into two groups: those in which
permanent dipoles are absent and those in which permanent dipoles
are present. The first group of materials is often referred to as being
nonmagnetic or diamagnetic. The second group is divided into several
subgroups depending upon the interactions between the individual
dipoles. If the interaction between magnetic dipoles is very small, the
material is paramagnetic. If the dipoles add up in parallel, the material
is said to be ferromagnetic. If they are antiparallel, the material is said
to be ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic. A schematic illustration of
paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic
materials is given in Figure 6.3.

Magnetization of a ferromagnetic material where B = magnetic field.
The ferromagnetic materials respond most sensitively to a magnetic
field, and the individual dipoles tend to align themselves with the
applied magnetic field. This does not happen instantaneously. In
particular, sections of the material called domains line up and finally
the entire material is aligned.
This is illustrated in Figure 6.4.
In the magnetization process stress occurs that leads to
magnetostriction or the magnetoelastic effect. Many magnetic sensors
can be realized using this effect.

6.4 Principles of Magnetic Sensors In general a sensor can be
represented as shown in Figure 6.5. If the sensor is passive then the
input physical or electrical source is not present. This would be true in
a simple piezoelectric force or pressure sensor in which

the output is a voltage or a stress. A Taguchi or metal oxide gas
sensor is an active sensor and would have a voltage as an input, gas
as the measurand, and a change in conductivity or resistivity as the
output. In a magnetic sensor at least one of three components shown
in Figure 6.5 would be a magnetic field. For example, we may have
voltages as the input, magnetic field as the measurand, and change in
current as the output. This configuration is the well-known
magnetoresistive sensor in which a magnetic field is the measurand,
which in turn changes the value of resistance in the material.
Several magnetic sensors can be realized as a result of the
galvanomagnetic effect, which relates to interrelationships that occur
between flowing electric current subjected to a magnetic field. This
effect may be illustrated as shown in Figure 6.6, which represents the
Hall effect.
A current passing through a semiconductor is subjected to an external
magnetic field, B, which gives rise to a Lorentz force as follows: F = ev
Ã B

(6.1)
where e = electronic charge, B = external magnetic field, and v =
electron velocity.
Since the resulting force is in the y direction, the electrons will be
deflected in that direction creating a voltage, which is commonly called
the Hall voltage. Note that electron flow is opposite to flow of current.
In addition to this voltage, the electron path from the left face of the
semiconductor to the right face has been lengthened. This longer path
for the
164
Introduction to Sensors
electrons results in an increase in the resistance of the semiconductor.
This resistance is dependent on the magnetic field and is called
magnetic resistance. This exactly describes the magnetoresistive
sensor mentioned earlier. A more detailed discussion of the
galvanomagnetic effect is given in the next section.

Another magnetic sensor can be realized from magnetostriction or the
magnetoelastic effect. The application of a magnetic field to a
cylindrical rod will cause a stress, and this stress may change the
length of the rod. If this happens, the inducted stress or changes in rod
length become a measure of the applied magnetic field. In order to
understand magnetostriction, consider the application of a magnetic
field to a demagnetized ferromagnetic material, as shown in Figure
6.7.
The applied magnetic field causes the individual magnetic dipoles to
align themselves with the field, ultimately creating a magnetized
material as shown in Figure 6.8.
In this magnetization process stresses and therefore strains occur in
the magnetic material as the individual magnetic dipoles attempt to
align themselves with the applied magnetic field. In general the stress,
S, is proportional to the applied magnetic field, B, and the
proportionality constant, K m, referred to as the magnetoelastic
constant, as follows:
S = KmB

This relationship is valid for isotropic homogeneous ferromagnetic
materials. However, in crystalline anisotropic materials the relationship
is not as simple as indicated in Equation 6.2 and one must account for
the crystalline structure of the ferromagnetic material. Equation 6.2 in
this case may be written as
[ S] = [ K m] [ B]
(6.3)
where [ S] is the 1 Ã 6 stress matrix, [ K m] is the 3 Ã 6 magnetoelastic
constant matrix, and [ B] is a 1 Ã 3 magnetic field matrix.
Equation 6.3 may also be represented in the following form:
[ B] = [ K m]â1 [ S]
(6.4)

In this case one sees that an applied stress, S, can cause a change in
the magnetic field, [ B].
Obviously one can use the property of magnetoelasticity or
magnetocon-striction to configure a large number of either stress or
strain (force) and magnetic field sensors.
Additionally, one can also apply a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic
material in which one has also applied an electric current. This is
shown in Figure 6.9 for a longitudinal ferromagnetic rod.
In this case the applied magnetic field, B, and the magnetic field
associated with the current, I, vectorially combine to create a resulting
magnetic field on the rod surface, which has both longitudinal and
transverse B
field components. According to Equation 6.2, this resulting B field will
then cause a stress resulting in the twisting of the rod. This type of
configuration and the resulting effect are referred to as the
Weidemann effect.
This effect can also be used to configure a possible sensor for
magnetic fields, current, or stress (twisting).

Introduction to Sensors
6.5 Solid-State Magnetic Sensors
Due to the interrelationships between magnetic fields, electric fields
(voltage), and current in semiconducting materials, a number of so-
called solid-state magnetic sensors can be realized. In order to
understand the operation of these sensors, it is necessary to explore
galvanomagnetic efforts in more depth. In Figure 6.10 the geometry
necessary to describe these effects is presented.
The Lorentz force equation may be written in centimeter gram second
(CGS) units as follows:

where c = velocity of light.
In the absence of any applied voltage ( E = 0), a force is exerted on the
electrons. This Lorentz force ( e c
/ ( vxB) ) in the negative y direction causes the electrons to build up on
the lower edge of the sample (see Figure 6.11), resulting in an electric
field that then balances the Lorentz force as follows:

R is referred to as the Hall coefficient and V H = E y y O is called the
Hall voltage. R can be determined if V H, I O, and B O are known.
Note that I O and B O are applied and V H is measured (see Figure
6.10). Once R is known we also can determine the carrier
concentration, n, from Equation 6.12, obtaining n = â 1

In addition, if the semiconductor conductivity, Ï, is known one can
determine the carrier mobility as follows:
Ï = ne Âµ

Equations 6.13 and 6.15 clearly indicate that it is possible to determine
or sense the concentration and mobility of carriers in a semiconductor.
Also, one may envision the semiconductor to be a metal oxide film
wherein gas sorption would cause changes in n and Î¼, which can be
accurately determined using the galvanomagnetic effect.
The effects just described are referred to as primary. Important
secondary effects also exist. The electron buildup on the bottom face

of the semiconductor also causes a temperature gradient, as shown in
Figure 6.12.
Associated with this temperature gradient is an additional voltage or
field,
E =

A relationship then exists between the temperature gradient and E T
that may be expressed as
T
E = â
Ï
T
â y
(6.17)
This is commonly called the Ettinghausen effect, and Ï is a
proportionality constant. Notice also that since the electron path has
been altered due to the Lorentz force, the path length for electrons
from the left to the right side of the semiconductor has increased. This
causes the sample resistance to increase, which is the
magnetoresistance effect discussed earlier.

The galvanomagnetic effect can be utilized to construct a well-known
magnetic field sensor called the Hall sensor. Figure 6.13 describes the
basic geometry associated with this sensor.
This geometry consists of a thin rectangular semiconductor plate with
four electrical contacts. A current, I, is applied via a voltage between
contacts CS 1
and CS 2. The magnetic field, which is unknown in this case, is known
from the previous galvanomagnetic discussion to produce a Hall
voltage, which T2

appears between the sensing contacts, SC 1 and SC 2. Referring to
Equations 6.11 and 6.16, this voltage may be represented as V =

RIBOW
(6.18)
For a long plate with very small contacts Equation 6.18 is valid.
However, for a small plate with finite dimensions V H is represented as
follows: VÊ¹H = RIBOWG
(6.19)

where G = geometric correction factor.
G may vary from 0 (large contacts) to 1 (point contacts). For sensing
magnetic fields one commonly uses long plates with small contacts (
G â 1). One then measures V H and one knows R from Equation 6.12
and I, and therefore the magnetic field is given as follows from
Equation 6.18: V

By rotating the sample into different orientation one can now get all
the components of the magnetic field.
In general in solid-state magnetic field sensors the following factors
are critical:
â¢ The magnetic field modified carrier transport
â¢ Device design, which optimizes sensitivity
The present discussions have focused on semiconducting materials,
but they may be extended to semiconducting devices such as diodes
and transistors. As a result, one can realize magnetodiode sensors
and bipolar

Introduction to Sensors
magnetotransistors. More recently, quantum theory and
superconductivity have been utilized to realize superconductivity
quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). These devices are among
the most sensitive of all magnetic sensors and have been used to
determine the low magnetic fields generated by the human brain and
heart as well as unique instrumentation for the detection of
gravitational waves. An in-depth discussion of the theory and
applications associated with solid-state magnetic sensors may be
found in Rosemerin [2].
