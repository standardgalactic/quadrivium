KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
Problem Set Week 2
This problem set focuses on material covered in Lectures 3 and 4, so I recommend you to watch both
lectures and attempt Assignments 3 and 4 before submitting your answers. The deadline for completing
(and submitting) the problem set is Monday February 17 at 9:00 AM US-PST. Note that you can save
your entries as you work through the problems, and can change them at any time prior to submission,
but once you submit your answers no further changes are possible.
NOTE: THE PLATFORM DISPLAYS THE 8 PARTS OF QUESTION 4 AS SEPARATE QUESTIONS. AS A
RESULT, THE QUESTION NUMBERING WHERE YOU ENTER YOUR ANSWERS ON THE SITE DIFFERS
FROM THE NUMBERS IN THIS PDF VERSION AND IN THE TUTORIAL VIDEO.

8. A major focus of this course is learning how to assess mathematical reasoning. How good you
are at doing that lies on a sliding scale. Your task is to evaluate this purported proof, and grade
it according to the course rubric. Enter your grade (which should be a whole number between 0
and 24, inclusive) in the box. You should come within 4 points of the instructor’s grade for full
marks [5 points], within 6 points for partial marks [3 points]. You should read the website
section “Using the evaluation rubric” (it includes a short explanatory video) before
attempting this question. There will be many more proof evaluation questions as the course
progresses.
Claim: For any two propositions P, Q, ¬P ∧¬Q is equivalent to ¬[P ∧Q].
Proof: Suppose that ¬P ∧¬Q is true. Then both ¬P and ¬Q are true.
So P and Q are both false. Thus P ∧Q is false. Hence ¬[P ∧Q] is true.
This argument clearly works the other way. So we have implication in both
directions, which proves the claim.
