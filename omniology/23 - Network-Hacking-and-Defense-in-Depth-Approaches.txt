NETWORK HACKING AND DEFENSE
 IN DEPTH APPROACHES
Effective defense
begins with a deep
understanding of
network hacking
techniques.
Modern network security involves embracing
concepts 
like 
Zero 
Trust 
and 
network
segmentation. 
This approach enhances network security by
deploying measures like firewalls, intrusion
detection systems, and encryption to protect
against different types of threats.
