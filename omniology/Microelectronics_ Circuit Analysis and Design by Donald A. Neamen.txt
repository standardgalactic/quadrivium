Preface
PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS
Microelectronics: Circuit Analysis and Design is intended as a core text in electron-
ics for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. The purpose of
the fourth edition of the book is to continue to provide a foundation for analyzing and
designing both analog and digital electronic circuits. A goal is to make this book very
readable and student-friendly.
Most electronic circuit design today involves integrated circuits (ICs), in which
the entire circuit is fabricated on a single piece of semiconductor material. The IC
can contain millions of semiconductor devices and other elements and can perform
complex functions. The microprocessor is a classic example of such a circuit. The
ultimate goal of this text is to clearly present the operation, characteristics, and
limitations of the basic circuits that form these complex integrated circuits. Although
most engineers will use existing ICs in specialized design applications, they must be
aware of the fundamental circuit's characteristics in order to understand the operation
and limitations of the IC.
Initially, discrete transistor circuits are analyzed and designed. The complexity
of circuits being studied increases throughout the text so that, eventually, the reader
should be able to analyze and design the basic elements of integrated circuits, such
as linear ampliﬁers and digital logic gates.
This text is an introduction to the complex subject of electronic circuits.
Therefore, more advanced material is not included. Specific technologies, such as
gallium arsenide, which is used in special applications, are also not included,
although reference may be made to a few specialized applications. Finally, the
layout and fabrication of ICs are not covered, since these topics alone can warrant
entire texts.
DESIGN EMPHASIS
Design is the heart of engineering. Good design evolves out of considerable experi-
ence with analysis. In this text, we point out various characteristics and properties of
circuits as we go through the analysis. The objective is to develop an intuition that
can be applied to the design process.
Many design examples, design exercise problems, and end-of-chapter design
problems are included in this text. The end-of-chapter design problems are desig-
nated with a “D”. Many of these examples and problems have a set of specifica-
tions that lead to a unique solution. Although engineering design in its truest sense
does not lead to a unique solution, these initial design examples and problems are
a first step, the author believes, in learning the design process. A separate section,
Design Problems, found in the end-of-chapter problems, contains open-ended design
problems.

Preface
COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
Computer analysis and computer-aided-design (CAD) are signiﬁcant factors in elec-
tronics. One of the most prevalent electronic circuit simulation programs is Simula-
tion Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE), developed at the University
of California. A version of SPICE tailored for personal computers is PSpice, which
is used in this text.
The text emphasizes hand analysis and design in order to concentrate on basic
circuit concepts. However, in several places in the text, PSpice results are in-
cluded and are correlated with the hand analysis results. Obviously, at the instruc-
tor's discretion, computer simulation may be incorporated at any point in the text.
A separate section, Computer Simulation Problems, is found in the end-of-chapter
problems.
In some chapters, particularly the chapters on frequency response and feedback,
computer analysis is used more heavily. Even in these situations, however, computer
analysis is considered only after the fundamental properties of the circuit have been
covered. The computer is a tool that can aid in the analysis and design of electronic
circuits, but is not a substitute for a thorough understanding of the basic concepts
of circuit analysis.
PREREQUISITES
This book is intended for junior undergraduates in electrical and computer engineer-
ing. The prerequisites for understanding the material include dc analysis and steady-
state sinusoidal analysis of electric circuits and the transient analysis of RC circuits.
Various network concepts, such as Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems, are used
extensively. Some background in Laplace transform techniques may also be useful.
Prior knowledge of semiconductor device physics is not required.
ORGANIZATION
The book is divided into three parts. Part 1, consisting of the ﬁrst eight chapters, cov-
ers semiconductor materials, the basic diode operation and diode circuits, and basic
transistor operations and transistor circuits. Part 2 addresses more advanced analog
electronics, such as operational ampliﬁer circuits, biasing techniques used in inte-
grated circuits, and other analog circuits applications. Part 3 covers digital elec-
tronics including CMOS integrated circuits. Five appendices are included at the end
of the text.
Content
Part 1. Chapter 1 introduces the semiconductor material and pn junction, which
leads to diode circuits and applications given in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 covers the ﬁeld-
effect transistor, with strong emphasis on the metal-oxide-semiconductor FET
(MOSFET), and Chapter 4 presents basic FET linear ampliﬁers. Chapter 5 discusses
the bipolar junction transistor, with basic bipolar linear ampliﬁer applications given in
Chapter 6.
The frequency response of transistors and transistor circuits is covered in a sep-
arate Chapter 7. The emphasis in Chapters 3 through 6 was on the analysis and

Preface
xvii
design techniques, so mixing the two transistor types within a given chapter
would introduce unnecessary confusion. However, starting with Chapter 7, both
MOSFET circuits and bipolar circuits are discussed within the same chapter. Fi-
nally, Chapter 8, covering output stages and power amplifiers, completes Part 1 of
the text.
Part 2. Chapters 9 through 15 are included in Part 2, which addresses more ad-
vanced analog electronics. In this portion of the text, the emphasis is placed on the
operational ampliﬁer and on circuits that form the basic building blocks of integrated
circuits (ICs). The ideal operational ampliﬁer and ideal op-amp circuits are covered
in Chapter 9. Chapter 10 presents constant-current source biasing circuits and intro-
duces the active load, both of which are used extensively in ICs. The differential
ampliﬁer, the heart of the op-amp, is discussed in Chapter 11, and feedback is con-
sidered in Chapter 12. Chapter 13 presents the analysis and design of various circuits
that form operational ampliﬁers. Nonideal effects in analog ICs are addressed in
Chapter 14, and applications, such as active ﬁlters and oscillators, are covered in
Chapter 15.
Part 3. Chapters 16 and 17 form Part 3 of the text, and cover the basics of digi-
tal electronics. The analysis and design of MOS digital electronics is discussed in
Chapter 16. The emphasis in this chapter is on CMOS circuits, which form the basis
of most present-day digital circuits. Basic digital logic gate circuits are initially cov-
ered, then shift registers, ﬂip-ﬂops, and then basic A/D and D/A converters are pre-
sented. Chapter 17 introduces bipolar digital electronics, including emitter-coupled
logic and classical transistor-transistor logic circuits.
Appendices. Five appendices are included at the end of the text. Appendix A
contains physical constants and conversion factors. Manufacturers' data sheets for
several devices and circuits are included in Appendix B. Standard resistor and ca-
pacitor values are given in Appendix C, and references and other reading sources are
listed in Appendix D. Finally, answers to selected end-of chapter problems are given
in Appendix E.
Order of Presentation
The book is written with a certain degree of ﬂexibility so that instructors can design
their own order of presentation of topics.
1. Op-Amp Circuits: For those instructors who wish to present ideal op-amp cir-
cuits as a ﬁrst topic in electronics, Chapter 9 is written such that sections 9.1
through 9.5.5 can be studied as a ﬁrst chapter in electronics.
Chapter Presentation
Ideal Op-Amp Circuits:
1. Chapter 9, Sections 9.1–9.5.5.
2. Chapters 1, 2, etc.
2. MOSFETs versus Bipolars: The chapters covering MOSFETs (3 and 4) and the
chapters covering bipolars (5 and 6) are written independently of each other. In-
structors, therefore, have the option of discussing MOSFETs before bipolars, as

given in the text, or discussing bipolars before MOSFETs in the more traditional
manner.

Prologue
Prologue to 
Electronics
When most of us hear the word electronics, we think of televisions, laptop computers,
cell phones, or iPods. Actually, these items are electronic systems composed of sub-
systems or electronic circuits, which include ampliﬁers, signal sources, power sup-
plies, and digital logic circuits.
Electronics is deﬁned as the science of the motion of charges in a gas, vacuum,
or semiconductor. (Note that the charge motion in a metal is excluded from this
deﬁnition.) This deﬁnition was used early in the 20th century to separate the ﬁeld of
electrical engineering, which dealt with motors, generators, and wire communica-
tions, from the new ﬁeld of electronic engineering, which at that time dealt with
vacuum tubes. Today, electronics generally involves transistors and transistor
circuits. Microelectronics refers to integrated circuit (IC) technology, which can
produce a circuit with multimillions of components on a single piece of semicon-
ductor material.
A typical electrical engineer will perform many diverse functions, and is likely
to use, design, or build systems incorporating some form of electronics. Conse-
quently, the division between electrical and electronic engineering is no longer as
clear as originally deﬁned.
BRIEF HISTORY
The development of the transistor and the integrated circuit has led to remarkable
electronic capabilities. The IC permeates almost every facet of our daily lives, from
instant communications by cellular phone to the automobile. One dramatic example
of IC technology is the small laptop computer, which today has more capability than
the equipment that just a few years ago would have ﬁlled an entire room. The cell
phone has shown dramatic changes. It not only provides for instant messaging, but
also includes a camera so that pictures can be instantly sent to virtually every point
on earth.
A fundamental breakthrough in electronics came in December 1947, when the
ﬁrst transistor was demonstrated at Bell Telephone Laboratories by William
Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain. From then until approximately 1959,
the transistor was available only as a discrete device, so the fabrication of circuits
required that the transistor terminals be soldered directly to the terminals of other
components.
In September 1958, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments demonstrated the ﬁrst
integrated circuit fabricated in germanium. At about the same time, Robert Noyce of
Fairchild Semiconductor introduced the integrated circuit in silicon. The develop-
ment of the IC continued at a rapid rate through the 1960s, using primarily bipolar
transistor technology. Since then, the metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transis-
tor (MOSFET) and MOS integrated circuit technology have emerged as a dominant
force, especially in digital integrated circuits.

Prologue I Prologue to Electronics
Figure PR1.1 Schematic of an electronic circuit with two input signals: the dc power
supply input, and the signal input
Since the ﬁrst IC, circuit design has become more sophisticated and the inte-
grated circuit more complex. Device size continues to shrink and the number of
devices fabricated on a single chip continues to increase at a rapid rate. Today, an IC
can contain arithmatic, logic, and memory functions on a single semiconductor chip.
The primary example of this type of integrated circuit is the microprocessor.
PASSIVE AND ACTIVE DEVICES
In a passive electrical device, the time average power delivered to the device over
an inﬁnite time period is always greater than or equal to zero. Resistors, capacitors,
and inductors, are examples of passive devices. Inductors and capacitors can store
energy, but they cannot deliver an average power greater than zero over an inﬁnite
time interval.
Active devices, such as dc power supplies, batteries, and ac signal generators,
are capable of supplying particular types of power. Transistors are also considered to
be active devices in that they are capable of supplying more signal power to a load
than they receive. This phenomenon is called ampliﬁcation. The additional power in
the output signal is a result of a redistribution of ac and dc power within the device.
ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS
In most electronic circuits, there are two inputs (Figure PRl.1).One input is from a
power supply that provides dc voltages and currents to establish the proper biasing
for transistors. The second input is a signal. Time-varying signals from a particular
source very often need to be ampliﬁed before the signal is capable of being “useful.”
For example, Figure PR1.l shows a signal source that is the output of a compact disc
system. The output music signal from the compact disc system consists of a small
time-varying voltage and current, which means that the signal power is relatively
small. The power required to drive the speakers is larger than the output signal from
the compact disc, so the compact disc signal must be ampliﬁed before it is capable of
driving the speakers in order that sound can be heard. 
Other examples of signals that must be ampliﬁed before they are capable of
driving loads include the output of a microphone, voice signals received on earth
from an orbiting manned shuttle, video signals from an orbiting weather satellite, and
the output of an electrocardiograph (EKG). Although the output signal can be larger
than the input signal, the output power can never exceed the dc input power. There-
fore, the magnitude of the dc power supply is one limitation to the output signal
response.

The analysis of electronic circuits, then, is divided into two parts: one deals with
the dc input and its circuit response, and the other deals with the signal input and the
resulting circuit response. Dependent voltage and current sources are used to model
the active devices and to represent the ampliﬁcation or signal gain. In general,
different equivalent circuit models must be used for the dc and ac analyses.
DISCRETE AND INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
In this text, we will deal principally with discrete electronic circuits, that is, circuits
that contain discrete components, such as resistors, capacitors, and transistors. We
will focus on the types of circuits that are the building blocks of the IC. For example,
we will look at the various circuits that make up the operational ampliﬁer, an impor-
tant IC in analog electronics. We will also discuss various logic circuits used in
digital ICs.
ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNALS
Analog signals 
The voltage signal shown graphically in Figure PR1.2(a) is called an analog signal.
The magnitude of an analog signal can take on any value within limits and may vary
continuously with time. Electronic circuits that process analog signals are called
analog circuits. One example of an analog circuit is a linear ampliﬁer. A linear
ampliﬁer magniﬁes an input signal and produces an output signal whose amplitude
is larger and directly proportional to the input signal.
The vast majority of signals in the “real world” are analog. Voice communica-
tions and music are just two examples. The ampliﬁcation of such signals is a large
part of electronics, and doing so with little or no distortion is a major consideration.
Therefore, in signal ampliﬁers, the output should be a linear function of the input. An
example is the power ampliﬁer circuit in a stereo system. This circuit provides sufﬁ-
cient power to “drive” the speaker system. Yet, it must remain linear in order to
reproduce the sound without distortion.
Digital signals
An alternative signal is at one of two distinct levels and is called a digital signal
(Figure PR1.2(b)). Since the digital signal has discrete values, it is said to be quan-
tized. Electronic circuits that process digital signals are called digital circuits.

In many electronic systems, signals are processed, transmitted, and received in
digital form. Digital systems and signal processing are now a large part of electron-
ics because of the tremendous advances made in the design and fabrication of digital
circuits. Digital processing allows a wide variety of functions to be performed that
would be impractical using analog means. In many cases, digital signals must be
converted from and to analog signals. These signals need to be processed through
analog-to-digital (A/D) converters and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. A signiﬁ-
cant part of electronics deals with these conversions.
NOTATION
The following notation, summarized in Table PR1.1, is used throughout this text.
A lowercase letter with an uppercase subscript, such as iB and vBE, indicates a total
instantaneous value. An uppercase letter with an uppercase subscript, such as IB and
VBE, indicates a dc quantity. A lowercase letter with a lowercase subscript, such as
ib and vbe, indicates an instantaneous value of a time-varying signal. Finally, an
uppercase letter with a lowercase subscript, such as Ib and Vbe, indicates a phasor
quantity.
As an example, Figure PR1.3 shows a sinusoidal voltage superimposed on a dc
voltage. Using our notation, we would write 
vBE = VBE + vbe = VBE + VM cos(ωt + φm)
The phasor concept is rooted in Euler’s identity and relates the exponential function
to the trigonometric function. We can write the sinusoidal voltage as
vbe = VM cos(ωt + φm) = VM Re{e j(ωt+φm)} = Re{VMe jφme jωt}

where Re stands for “the real part of.” The coefﬁcient of e jωt is a complex number
that represents the amplitude and phase angle of the sinusoidal voltage. This complex
number, then, is the phasor of that voltage, or
Vbe = VMe jφm
In some cases throughout the text, the input and output signals will be quasista-
tic quantities. For these situations, we may use either the total instantaneous notation,
such as iB and vBE, or the dc notation, IB and VBE.
SUMMARY
Semiconductor devices are the basic components in electronic circuits. The electrical
characteristics of these devices provide the controlled switching required for signal
processing, for example. Most electrical engineers are users of electronics rather than
designers of electronic circuits and ICs. As with any discipline, however, the basics
must be mastered before the overall system characteristics and limitations can be
understood. In electronics, the discrete circuit must be thoroughly studied and
analyzed before the operation, properties, and limitations of an IC can be fully
appreciated.

In the ﬁrst part of the text, we introduce the physical and electrical characteristics
of the major semiconductor devices. Various basic circuits in which these devices are
used are analyzed. This introduction will illustrate how the device characteristics are
utilized in switching, digital, and ampliﬁcation applications.
Chapter 1 brieﬂy discusses semiconductor material characteristics and then
introduces the semiconductor diode. Chapter 2 looks at various diode circuits
that demonstrate how the nonlinear characteristics of the diode itself are used in
switching and waveshaping applications. Chapter 3 introduces the metal-oxide-
semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MOSFET), presents the dc analysis of MOS
transistor circuits, and discusses basic applications of this transistor. In Chapter 4, we
analyze and design fundamental MOS transistor circuits, including ampliﬁers.
Chapter 5 introduces the bipolar transistor, presents the dc analysis of bipolar
transistor circuits, and discusses basic applications of this transistor. Various bipolar
transistor circuits, including ampliﬁers, are analyzed and designed in Chapter 6.
Chapter 7 considers the frequency response of both MOS and bipolar transistor cir-
cuits. Finally, Chapter 8 discusses the designs and applications of these basic
electronic circuits, including power ampliﬁers and various output stages.

This text deals with the analysis and design of circuits containing electronic devices,
such as diodes and transistors. These electronic devices are fabricated using semi-
conductor materials, so we begin Chapter 1 with a brief discussion of the properties
and characteristics of semiconductors. The intent of this brief discussion is to be-
come familiar with some of the semiconductor material terminology, and to gain an
understanding of the mechanisms that generate currents in a semiconductor.
A basic electronic device is the pn junction diode. The diode is a two-terminal
device, but the i–v relationship is nonlinear. Since the diode is a nonlinear element,
the analysis of circuits containing diodes is not as straightforward as the analysis of
simple linear resistor circuits. A goal of the chapter is to become familiar with the
analysis of diode circuits.
PREVIEW
In this chapter, we will:
•
Gain a basic understanding of a few semiconductor material properties
including the two types of charged carriers that exist in a semiconductor and
the two mechanisms that generate currents in a semiconductor.
•
Determine the properties of a pn junction including the ideal current–voltage
characteristics of the pn junction diode.
•
Examine dc analysis techniques for diode circuits using various models to
describe the nonlinear diode characteristics.
•
Develop an equivalent circuit for a diode that is used when a small, time-
varying signal is applied to a diode circuit.
•
Gain an understanding of the properties and characteristics of a few special-
ized diodes.
•
As an application, design a simple electronic thermometer using the temper-
ature characteristics of a diode.

Objective: • Gain a basic understanding of a few semiconductor
material properties including the two types of charged carriers that
exist in a semiconductor and the two mechanisms that generate
currents in a semiconductor.
Most electronic devices are fabricated by using semiconductor materials along with
conductors and insulators. To gain a better understanding of the behavior of the elec-
tronic devices in circuits, we must ﬁrst understand a few of the characteristics of the
semiconductor material. Silicon is by far the most common semiconductor material
used for semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. Other semiconductor mate-
rials are used for specialized applications. For example, gallium arsenide and related
compounds are used for very high speed devices and optical devices. A list of some
semiconductor materials is given in Table 1.1.
Intrinsic Semiconductors
An atom is composed of a nucleus, which contains positively charged protons and
neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons that, in the classical sense, orbit
the nucleus. The electrons are distributed in various “shells” at different distances
from the nucleus, and electron energy increases as shell radius increases. Electrons
in the outermost shell are called valence electrons, and the chemical activity of a
material is determined primarily by the number of such electrons.
Elements in the periodic table can be grouped according to the number of
valence electrons. Table 1.2 shows a portion of the periodic table in which the more
common semiconductors are found. Silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) are in group IV
and are elemental semiconductors. In contrast, gallium arsenide is a group III–V
compound semiconductor.We will show that the elements in group III and group V are
also important in semiconductors.
Figure 1.1(a) shows ﬁve noninteracting silicon atoms, with the four valence
electrons of each atom shown as dashed lines emanating from the atom. As silicon

silicon atom has four nearest neighbors, as shown in Figure 1.1(b). The valence
electrons are shared between atoms, forming what are called covalent bonds.
Germanium, gallium arsenide, and many other semiconductor materials have the
same tetrahedral conﬁguration.
Figure 1.1(c) is a two-dimensional representation of the lattice formed by the
ﬁve silicon atoms in Figure 1.1(a). An important property of such a lattice is that
valence electrons are always available on the outer edge of the silicon crystal so that
additional atoms can be added to form very large single-crystal structures.

(b) Energy band diagram showing the generation process of creating an electron in the
conduction band and the positively charged “empty state” in the valence band.
A two-dimensional representation of a silicon single crystal is shown in Figure 1.2,
for T = 0 K, where T = temperature. Each line between atoms represents a valence
electron. At T = 0 K, each electron is in its lowest possible energy state, so each cova-
lent bonding position is ﬁlled. If a small electric ﬁeld is applied to this material, the
electrons will not move, because they will still be bound to their individual atoms.
Therefore, at T = 0 K, silicon is an insulator; that is, no charge ﬂows through it.
When silicon atoms come together to form a crystal, the electrons occupy par-
ticular allowed energy bands. At T = 0 K, all valence electrons occupy the valence
energy band. If the temperature increases, the valence electrons may gain thermal en-
ergy. Any such electron may gain enough thermal energy to break the covalent bond
and move away from its original position as schematically shown in Figure 1.3. In
order to break the covalent bond, the valence electron must gain a minimum energy,
Eg, called the bandgap energy. The electrons that gain this minimum energy now
exist in the conduction band and are said to be free electrons. These free electrons in
the conduction band can move throughout the crystal. The net ﬂow of electrons in the
conduction band generates a current.
An energy band diagram is shown in Figure 1.4(a). The energy Eν is the maxi-
mum energy of the valence energy band and the energy Ec is the minimum energy of
the conduction energy band. The bandgap energy Eg is the difference between Ec and
Eν, and the region between these two energies is called the forbidden bandgap.
Electrons cannot exist within the forbidden bandgap. Figure 1.4(b) qualitatively
shows an electron from the valence band gaining enough energy and moving into the
conduction band. This process is called generation.
Materials that have large bandgap energies, in the range of 3 to 6 electron–volts1
(eV), are insulators because, at room temperature, essentially no free electrons exist
in the conduction band. In contrast, materials that contain very large numbers of free
electrons at room temperature are conductors. In a semiconductor, the bandgap
energy is on the order of 1 eV.
The net charge in a semiconductor is zero; that is, the semiconductor is neutral.
If a negatively charged electron breaks its covalent bond and moves away from its
original position, a positively charged “empty” state is created at that position

1 volt, and 1 eV = 1.6 × 10−19 joules.

Figure 1.5 A two-dimensional
representation of the silicon
crystal showing the
movement of the positively
charged “empty state”
(Figure 1.3). As the temperature increases, more covalent bonds are broken, and
more free electrons and positive empty states are created.
A valence electron that has a certain thermal energy and is adjacent to an empty
state may move into that position, as shown in Figure 1.5, making it appear as if
a positive charge is moving through the semiconductor. This positively charged
“particle” is called a hole. In semiconductors, then, two types of charged particles
contribute to the current: the negatively charged free electron, and the positively
charged hole. (This description of a hole is greatly oversimpliﬁed, and is meant only
to convey the concept of the moving positive charge.) We may note that the charge of
a hole has the same magnitude as the charge of an electron.
The concentrations (#/cm3) of electrons and holes are important parameters in
the characteristics of a semiconductor material, because they directly inﬂuence the
magnitude of the current. An intrinsic semiconductor is a single-crystal semicon-
ductor material with no other types of atoms within the crystal. In an intrinsic
semiconductor, the densities of electrons and holes are equal, since the thermally
generated electrons and holes are the only source of such particles. Therefore, we use
the notation ni as the intrinsic carrier concentration for the concentration of the
free electrons, as well as that of the holes. The equation for ni is as follows:
ni = BT 3/2e

where B is a coefﬁcient related to the speciﬁc semiconductor material, Eg is
the bandgap energy (eV), T is the temperature (K), k is Boltzmann’s constant
(86 × 10−6 eV/K), and e, in this context, represents the exponential function.
The values for B and Eg for several semiconductor materials are given in Table 1.3.
The bandgap energy Eg and coefﬁcient B are not strong functions of temperature. The
intrinsic concentration ni is a parameter that appears often in the current–voltage
equations for semiconductor devices.

germanium at T = 300 K. (Ans. GaAs, ni = 1.80 × 106 cm−3; Ge, ni = 2.40 ×

Extrinsic Semiconductors
Since the electron and hole concentrations in an intrinsic semiconductor are rela-
tively small, only very small currents are possible. However, these concentrations
can be greatly increased by adding controlled amounts of certain impurities. A
desirable impurity is one that enters the crystal lattice and replaces (i.e., substitutes
for) one of the semiconductor atoms, even though the impurity atom does not have
the same valence electron structure. For silicon, the desirable substitutional impuri-
ties are from the group III and V elements (see Table 1.2).
The most common group V elements used for this purpose are phosphorus and
arsenic. For example, when a phosphorus atom substitutes for a silicon atom, as shown
in Figure 1.6(a), four of its valence electrons are used to satisfy the covalent bond
requirements. The ﬁfth valence electron is more loosely bound to the phosphorus atom.
At room temperature, this electron has enough thermal energy to break the bond, thus
being free to move through the crystal and contribute to the electron current in the
semiconductor. When the ﬁfth phosphorus valence electron moves into the conduction
band, a positively charged phosphorus ion is created as shown in Figure 1.6(b).
The phosphorus atom is called a donor impurity, since it donates an electron
that is free to move. Although the remaining phosphorus atom has a net positive
charge, the atom is immobile in the crystal and cannot contribute to the current.
Therefore, when a donor impurity is added to a semiconductor, free electrons are
created without generating holes. This process is called doping, and it allows us to
control the concentration of free electrons in a semiconductor.
A semiconductor that contains donor impurity atoms is called an n-type semi-
conductor (for the negatively charged electrons) and has a preponderance of elec-
trons compared to holes.

Figure 1.7 (a) Two-dimensional representation of a silicon lattice doped with a boron atom
showing the vacant covalent bond position, (b) the resulting negatively charged boron ion
after it has accepted an electron from the valence band. A positively charged hole is created.
The most common group III element used for silicon doping is boron. When a
boron atom replaces a silicon atom, its three valence electrons are used to satisfy
the covalent bond requirements for three of the four nearest silicon atoms (Fig-
ure 1.7(a)). This leaves one bond position open. At room temperature, adjacent silicon
valence electrons have sufﬁcient thermal energy to move into this position, thereby cre-
ating a hole. This effect is shown in Figure 1.7(b). The boron atom then has a net neg-
ative charge, but cannot move, and a hole is created that can contribute to a hole current.
Because the boron atom has accepted a valence electron, the boron is therefore
called an acceptor impurity. Acceptor atoms lead to the creation of holes without
electrons being generated. This process, also called doping, can be used to control the
concentration of holes in a semiconductor.
A semiconductor that contains acceptor impurity atoms is called a p-type semi-
conductor (for the positively charged holes created) and has a preponderance of
holes compared to electrons.
The materials containing impurity atoms are called extrinsic semiconductors, or
doped semiconductors. The doping process, which allows us to control the concentra-
tions of free electrons and holes, determines the conductivity and currents in the material.
A fundamental relationship between the electron and hole concentrations in a
semiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by
no po = n2
i
(1.2)
where no is the thermal equilibrium concentration of free electrons, po is the thermal
equilibrium concentration of holes, and ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration.
At room temperature (T = 300 K), each donor atom donates a free electron to
the semiconductor. If the donor concentration Nd is much larger than the intrinsic
concentration, we can approximate
no ∼= Nd
(1.3)
Then, from Equation (1.2), the hole concentration is
po = n2
i
Nd
(1.4)
Similarly, at room temperature, each acceptor atom accepts a valence electron, creat-
ing a hole. If the acceptor concentration Na is much larger than the intrinsic concen-
tration, we can approximate

(a) Consider silicon at T = 300 K doped with phosphorus at a concentration of
Nd = 1016 cm−3. Recall from Example 1.1 that ni = 1.5 × 1010 cm−3.
Solution: Since Nd ≫ni, the electron concentration is
no ∼= Nd = 1016 cm−3
and the hole concentration is
po = n2
i
Nd
= (1.5 × 1010)2

(b) Consider silicon at T = 300 K doped with boron at a concentration of

Solution: Since Na ≫ni, the hole concentration is
po ∼= Na = 5 × 1016 cm−3
and the electron concentration is
no = n2
i
Na
= (1.5 × 1010)2
5 × 1016

Comment: We see that in a semiconductor doped with donors, the concentration of
electrons is far greater than that of the holes. Conversely, in a semiconductor doped
with acceptors, the concentration of holes is far greater than that of the electrons. It
is also important to note that the difference in the concentrations between electrons
and holes in a particular semiconductor is many orders of magnitude.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.2: (a) Calculate the majority and minority carrier concentrations in silicon at
T = 300 K for (i) Nd = 2 × 1016 cm−3 and (ii) Na = 1015 cm−3. (b) Repeat part
(a) for GaAs. (Ans. (a) (i) no = 2 × 1016 cm−3,
po = 1.125 × 104 cm−3;
(ii) po = 1015 cm−3, no = 2.25 × 105 cm−3; (b) (i) no = 2 × 1016 cm−3, po =
1.62 × 10−4 cm−3; (ii) po = 1015 cm−3, no = 3.24 × 10−3 cm−3).
In an n-type semiconductor, electrons are called the majority carrier be-
cause they far outnumber the holes, which are termed the minority carrier. The
results obtained in Example 1.2 clarify this definition. In contrast, in a p-type
semiconductor, the holes are the majority carrier and the electrons are the minor-
ity carrier.

Drift and Diffusion Currents
We’ve described the creation of negatively charged electrons and positively charged
holes in the semiconductor. If these charged particles move, a current is generated.
These charged electrons and holes are simply referred to as carriers.
The two basic processes which cause electrons and holes to move in a semicon-
ductor are: (a) drift, which is the movement caused by electric ﬁelds, and (b) diffusion,
which is the ﬂow caused by variations in the concentration, that is, concentration gra-
dients. Such gradients can be caused by a nonhomogeneous doping distribution, or
by the injection of a quantity of electrons or holes into a region, using methods to be
discussed later in this chapter.
Drift Current Density
To understand drift, assume an electric ﬁeld is applied to a semiconductor. The ﬁeld
produces a force that acts on free electrons and holes, which then experience a net drift
velocity and net movement. Consider an n-type semiconductor with a large number of
free electrons (Figure 1.8(a)). An electric ﬁeld E applied in one direction produces a
force on the electrons in the opposite direction, because of the electrons’ negative
charge. The electrons acquire a drift velocity vdn (in cm/s) which can be written as
vdn = −μnE
(1.7)
where μn is a constant called the electron mobility and has units of cm2/V–s. For
low-doped silicon, the value of μn is typically 1350 cm2/V–s. The mobility can be
thought of as a parameter indicating how well an electron can move in a semicon-
ductor. The negative sign in Equation (1.7) indicates that the electron drift velocity is
opposite to that of the applied electric ﬁeld as shown in Figure 1.8(a). The electron
drift produces a drift current density Jn (A/cm2) given by
Jn = −envdn = −en(−μnE) = +enμnE
(1.8)
where n is the electron concentration (#/cm3) and e, in this context, is the magnitude
of the electronic charge. The conventional drift current is in the opposite direction
from the ﬂow of negative charge, which means that the drift current in an n-type
semiconductor is in the same direction as the applied electric ﬁeld.
Next consider a p-type semiconductor with a large number of holes (Figure l.8(b)).
An electric ﬁeld E applied in one direction produces a force on the holes in the same
direction, because of the positive charge on the holes. The holes acquire a drift
velocity vdp (in cm/s), which can be written as
vdp = +μpE

where μp is a constant called the hole mobility, and again has units of cm2/V–s.
For low-doped silicon, the value of μp is typically 480 cm2/V–s, which is less
than half the value of the electron mobility. The positive sign in Equation (1.9) in-
dicates that the hole drift velocity is in the same direction as the applied electric
field as shown in Figure 1.8(b). The hole drift produces a drift current density Jp
(A/cm2) given by
Jp = +epvdp = +ep(+μpE) = +epμpE
(1.10)
where p is the hole concentration (#/cm3) and e is again the magnitude of the elec-
tronic charge. The conventional drift current is in the same direction as the ﬂow of
positive charge, which means that the drift current in a p-type material is also in the
same direction as the applied electric ﬁeld.
Since a semiconductor contains both electrons and holes, the total drift current
density is the sum of the electron and hole components. The total drift current den-
sity is then written as
J = enμnE + epμpE = σ E = 1
ρ E
(1.11(a))
where
σ = enμn + epμp
(1.11(b))
and where σ is the conductivity of the semiconductor in (–cm)−1 and where
ρ = 1/σ is the resistivity of the semiconductor in (–cm). The conductivity is re-
lated to the concentration of electrons and holes. If the electric ﬁeld is the result of
applying a voltage to the semiconductor, then Equation (1.11(a)) becomes a linear
relationship between current and voltage and is one form of Ohm’s law.
From Equation (1.11(b)), we see that the conductivity can be changed from
strongly n-type, n ≫p, by donor impurity doping to strongly p-type, p ≫n, by
acceptor impurity doping. Being able to control the conductivity of a semicon-
ductor by selective doping is what enables us to fabricate the variety of elec-
tronic devices that are available.
EXAMPLE 1.3
Objective: Calculate the drift current density for a given semiconductor.
Consider silicon at T = 300 K doped with arsenic atoms at a concentration
of Nd = 8 × 1015 cm−3. Assume mobility values of μn = 1350 cm2/V–s and μp =
480 cm2/V–s. Assume the applied electric ﬁeld is 100 V/cm.
Solution: The electron and hole concentrations are
n ∼= Nd = 8 × 1015 cm−3
and
p = n2
i
Nd
= (1.5 × 1010)2
8 × 1015
= 2.81 × 104 cm−3
Because of the difference in magnitudes between the two concentrations, the con-
ductivity is given by
σ = eμnn + eμp p ∼= eμnn

Chapter 1 Semiconductor Materials and Diodes
19
or
σ = (1.6 × 10−19)(1350)(8 × 1015) = 1.73(–cm)−1
The drift current density is then
J = σ E = (1.73)(100) = 173 A/cm2
Comment: Since n ≫p, the conductivity is essentially a function of the electron
concentration and mobility only. We may note that a current density of a few hundred
amperes per square centimeter can be generated in a semiconductor.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.3: Consider n-type GaAs at T = 300 K doped to a concentration of 
Nd = 2 × 1016 cm−3. Assume mobility values of μn = 6800 cm2/V–s and μp =
300 cm2/V–s. (a) Determine the resistivity of the material. (b) Determine the ap-
plied electric ﬁeld that will induce a drift current density of 175 A/cm2. (Ans.
(a) 0.0460 –cm, (b) 8.04 V/cm).
Note: Two factors need to be mentioned concerning drift velocity and mobility.
Equations (1.7) and (1.9) imply that the carrier drift velocities are linear functions of
the applied electric ﬁeld. This is true for relatively small electric ﬁelds. As the elec-
tric ﬁeld increases, the carrier drift velocities will reach a maximum value of ap-
proximately 107 cm/s. Any further increase in electric ﬁeld will not produce an
increase in drift velocity. This phenomenon is called drift velocity saturation.
Electron and hole mobility values were given in Example 1.3. The mobility val-
ues are actually functions of donor and/or acceptor impurity concentrations. As the
impurity concentration increases, the mobility values will decrease. This effect then
means that the conductivity, Equation (1.11(b)), is not a linear function of impurity
doping.
These two factors are important in the design of semiconductor devices, but will
not be considered in detail in this text.
Diffusion Current Density
In the diffusion process, particles ﬂow from a region of high concentration to a region
of lower concentration. This is a statistical phenomenon related to kinetic theory. To
explain, the electrons and holes in a semiconductor are in continuous motion, with an
average speed determined by the temperature, and with the directions randomized by
interactions with the lattice atoms. Statistically, we can assume that, at any particular
instant, approximately half of the particles in the high-concentration region are
moving away from that region toward the lower-concentration region. We can also
assume that, at the same time, approximately half of the particles in the lower-
concentration region are moving toward the high-concentration region. However, by
deﬁnition, there are fewer particles in the lower-concentration region than there are in
the high-concentration region. Therefore, the net result is a ﬂow of particles away
from the high-concentration region and toward the lower-concentration region. This
is the basic diffusion process.
For example, consider an electron concentration that varies as a function of distance
x, as shown in Figure 1.9(a). The diffusion of electrons from a high-concentration region

20
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
to a low-concentration region produces a ﬂow of electrons in the negative x direction.
Since electrons are negatively charged, the conventional current direction is in the
positive x direction.
The diffusion current density due to the diffusion of electrons can be written as
(for one dimension)
Jn = eDn
dn
dx
(1.12)
where e, in this context, is the magnitude of the electronic charge, dn/dx is the gra-
dient of the electron concentration, and Dn is the electron diffusion coefﬁcient.
In Figure 1.9(b), the hole concentration is a function of distance. The diffusion
of holes from a high-concentration region to a low-concentration region produces a
ﬂow of holes in the negative x direction. (Conventional current is in the direction of
the ﬂow of positive charge.)
The diffusion current density due to the diffusion of holes can be written as (for
one dimension)
Jp = −eDp
dp
dx
(1.13)
where e is still the magnitude of the electronic charge, dp/dx is the gradient of the
hole concentration, and Dp is the hole diffusion coefﬁcient. Note the change in sign
between the two diffusion current equations. This change in sign is due to the differ-
ence in sign of the electronic charge between the negatively charged electron and the
positively charged hole.
EXAMPLE 1.4
Objective: Calculate the diffusion current density for a given semiconductor.
Consider silicon at T = 300 K. Assume the electron concentration varies lin-
early from n = 1012 cm−3 to n = 1016 cm−3 over the distance from x = 0 to
x = 3 μm. Assume Dn = 35 cm2/s.

Comment: Diffusion current densities on the order of a few hundred amperes per
square centimeter can also be generated in a semiconductor.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.4: Consider silicon at T = 300 K. Assume the hole concentration is given
by p = 1016e−x/L p (cm−3), where L p = 10−3 cm. Calculate the hole diffusion
current density at (a) x = 0 and (b) x = 10−3cm. Assume Dp = 10 cm2/s. (Ans.
(a) 16 A/cm2, (b) 5.89 A/cm2)

values in the diffusion current equations are not independent quantities. They are
related by the Einstein relation, which is

at room temperature.
The total current density is the sum of the drift and diffusion components. For-
tunately, in most cases only one component dominates the current at any one time in
a given region of a semiconductor.
DESIGN POINTER
In the previous two examples, current densities on the order of 200 A/cm2 have
been calculated. This implies that if a current of 1 mA, for example, is required in
a semiconductor device, the size of the device is small. The total current is given
by I = JA, where A is the cross-sectional area. For I = 1 mA = 1 × 10−3 A and
J = 200 A/cm2, the cross-sectional area is A = 5 × 10−6 cm2. This simple calcu-
lation again shows why semiconductor devices are small in size.
Excess Carriers
Up to this point, we have assumed that the semiconductor is in thermal equilibrium.
In the discussion of drift and diffusion currents, we implicitly assumed that equilib-
rium was not signiﬁcantly disturbed. Yet, when a voltage is applied to, or a current
exists in, a semiconductor device, the semiconductor is really not in equilibrium.
In this section, we will discuss the behavior of nonequilibrium electron and hole
concentrations.
Valence electrons may acquire sufﬁcient energy to break the covalent bond and
become free electrons if they interact with high-energy photons incident on the semi-
conductor. When this occurs, both an electron and a hole are produced, thus generating
1.1.4

22
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
an electron–hole pair. These additional electrons and holes are called excess
electrons and excess holes.
When these excess electrons and holes are created, the concentrations of free
electrons and holes increase above their thermal equilibrium values. This may be rep-
resented by
n = no + δn
(1.15(a))
and
p = po + δp
(1.15(b))
where no and po are the thermal equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes,
and δn and δp are the excess electron and hole concentrations.
If the semiconductor is in a steady-state condition, the creation of excess
electrons and holes will not cause the carrier concentration to increase indefi-
nitely, because a free electron may recombine with a hole, in a process called
electron–hole recombination. Both the free electron and the hole disappear
causing the excess concentration to reach a steady-state value. The mean time
over which an excess electron and hole exist before recombination is called the
excess carrier lifetime.
Excess carriers are involved in the current mechanisms of, for example, solar
cells and photodiodes. These devices are discussed in Section 1.5.

THE pn JUNCTION
Objective: • Determine the properties of a pn junction including the
ideal current-voltage characteristics of the pn junction diode.
In the preceding sections, we looked at characteristics of semiconductor materials.
The real power of semiconductor electronics occurs when p- and n-regions are di-
rectly adjacent to each other, forming a pn junction. One important concept to
remember is that in most integrated circuit applications, the entire semiconductor
material is a single crystal, with one region doped to be p-type and the adjacent
region doped to be n-type.
The Equilibrium pn Junction
Figure 1.10(a) is a simpliﬁed block diagram of a pn junction. Figure 1.10(b) shows
the respective p-type and n-type doping concentrations, assuming uniform doping in
each region, as well as the minority carrier concentrations in each region, assuming
thermal equilibrium. Figure 1.10(c) is a three-dimensional diagram of the pn junction
showing the cross-sectional area of the device.
The interface at x = 0 is called the metallurgical junction. A large density
gradient in both the hole and electron concentrations occurs across this junction. Ini-
tially, then, there is a diffusion of holes from the p-region into the n-region, and a
diffusion of electrons from the n-region into the p-region (Figure 1.11). The ﬂow of
holes from the p-region uncovers negatively charged acceptor ions, and the ﬂow of

electrons from the n-region uncovers positively charged donor ions. This action
creates a charge separation (Figure 1.12(a)), which sets up an electric ﬁeld oriented
in the direction from the positive charge to the negative charge.
If no voltage is applied to the pn junction, the diffusion of holes and electrons
must eventually cease. The direction of the induced electric ﬁeld will cause the
resulting force to repel the diffusion of holes from the p-region and the diffusion of
electrons from the n-region. Thermal equilibrium occurs when the force produced by
the electric ﬁeld and the “force” produced by the density gradient exactly balance.
The positively charged region and the negatively charged region comprise the
space-charge region, or depletion region, of the pn junction, in which there are
essentially no mobile electrons or holes. Because of the electric ﬁeld in the space-
charge region, there is a potential difference across that region (Figure 1.12(b)). This
potential difference is called the built-in potential barrier, or built-in voltage, and
is given by

where VT ≡kT/e, k = Boltzmann’s constant, T = absolute temperature, e = the

the thermal voltage and is approximately VT = 0.026 V at room temperature,
T = 300 K.

Comment: Because of the log function, the magnitude of Vbi is not a strong function
of the doping concentrations. Therefore, the value of Vbi for silicon pn junctions is
usually within 0.1 to 0.2 V of this calculated value.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.5: (a) Calculate Vbi
for a GaAs pn junction at T = 300 K for
Na = 1016 cm−3 and Nd = 1017 cm−3 (b) Repeat part (a) for a Germanium pn
junction with the same doping concentrations. (Ans. (a) Vbi = 1.23 V,
(b) Vbi = 0.374 V).
The potential difference, or built-in potential barrier, across the space-charge
region cannot be measured by a voltmeter because new potential barriers form be-
tween the probes of the voltmeter and the semiconductor, canceling the effects of Vbi.
In essence, Vbi maintains equilibrium, so no current is produced by this voltage.
However, the magnitude of Vbi becomes important when we apply a forward-bias
voltage, as discussed later in this chapter.
Reverse-Biased pn Junction
Assume a positive voltage is applied to the n-region of a pn junction, as shown in
Figure 1.13. The applied voltage VR induces an applied electric ﬁeld, E A, in the
semiconductor. The direction of this applied ﬁeld is the same as that of the E-ﬁeld
in the space-charge region. The magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the space-charge
region increases above the thermal equilibrium value. This increased electric ﬁeld
holds back the holes in the p-region and the electrons in the n-region, so there is
essentially no current across the pn junction. By deﬁnition, this applied voltage
polarity is called reverse bias.
When the electric ﬁeld in the space-charge region increases, the number of
positive and negative charges must increase. If the doping concentrations are not
changed, the increase in the ﬁxed charge can only occur if the width W of the space-
charge region increases. Therefore, with an increasing reverse-bias voltage VR,
space-charge width W also increases. This effect is shown in Figure 1.14.

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Because of the additional positive and negative charges induced in the space-
charge region with an increase in reverse-bias voltage, a capacitance is associated
with the pn junction when a reverse-bias voltage is applied. This junction capaci-
tance, or depletion layer capacitance, can be written in the form
Cj = Cjo

where Cjo is the junction capacitance at zero applied voltage.
The junction capacitance will affect the switching characteristics of the pn junc-
tion, as we will see later in the chapter. The voltage across a capacitance cannot
change instantaneously, so changes in voltages in circuits containing pn junctions
will not occur instantaneously.
The capacitance–voltage characteristics can make the pn junction useful for
electrically tunable resonant circuits. Junctions fabricated speciﬁcally for this pur-
pose are called varactor diodes. Varactor diodes can be used in electrically tunable
oscillators, such as a Hartley oscillator, discussed in Chapter 15, or in tuned ampli-
ﬁers, considered in Chapter 8.
EXAMPLE 1.6
Objective: Calculate the junction capacitance of a pn junction.
Consider a silicon pn junction at T = 300 K, with doping concentrations of
Na = 1016 cm−3 and Nd = 1015 cm−3. Assume that ni = 1.5 × 1010 cm−3 and let

electric ﬁeld occurs at the metallurgical junction. However, neither the electric ﬁeld in
the space-charge region nor the applied reverse-bias voltage can increase indeﬁnitely
because at some point, breakdown will occur and a large reverse bias current will be
generated. This concept will be described in detail later in this chapter.
Forward-Biased pn Junction
We have seen that the n-region contains many more free electrons than the p-region;
similarly, the p-region contains many more holes than the n-region.With zero applied
voltage, the built-in potential barrier prevents these majority carriers from diffusing
across the space-charge region; thus, the barrier maintains equilibrium between the
carrier distributions on either side of the pn junction.
If a positive voltage vD is applied to the p-region, the potential barrier de-
creases (Figure 1.15). The electric ﬁelds in the space-charge region are very large
compared to those in the remainder of the p- and n-regions, so essentially all of the
applied voltage exists across the pn junction region. The applied electric ﬁeld, EA,
induced by the applied voltage is in the opposite direction from that of the thermal
equilibrium space-charge E-ﬁeld. However, the net electric ﬁeld is always from the
n- to the p-region. The net result is that the electric ﬁeld in the space-charge region
is lower than the equilibrium value. This upsets the delicate balance between dif-
fusion and the E-ﬁeld force. Majority carrier electrons from the n-region diffuse
into the p-region, and majority carrier holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region.
The process continues as long as the voltage vD is applied, thus creating a current
in the pn junction. This process would be analogous to lowering a dam wall
slightly. A slight drop in the wall height can send a large amount of water (current)
over the barrier.
This applied voltage polarity (i.e., bias) is known as forward bias. The forward-
bias voltage vD must always be less than the built-in potential barrier Vbi.
As the majority carriers cross into the opposite regions, they become minority
carriers in those regions, causing the minority carrier concentrations to increase.
Figure 1.16 shows the resulting excess minority carrier concentrations at the space-
charge region edges. These excess minority carriers diffuse into the neutral n- and
p-regions, where they recombine with majority carriers, thus establishing a steady-
state condition, as shown in Figure 1.16.

The two electric ﬁelds are in opposite directions resulting in a smaller net electric ﬁeld and a
smaller barrier between the p- and n-regions. The net electric ﬁeld is always from the n- to
the p-region.

Ideal Current–Voltage Relationship
As shown in Figure 1.16, an applied voltage results in a gradient in the minority car-
rier concentrations, which in turn causes diffusion currents. The theoretical relation-
ship between the voltage and the current in the pn junction is given by

(1.18)
The parameter IS is the reverse-bias saturation current. For silicon pn junctions,
typical values of IS are in the range of 10−18 to 10−12 A. The actual value depends on the
doping concentrations and is also proportional to the cross-sectional area of the junc-
tion. The parameter VT is the thermal voltage, as deﬁned in Equation (1.16), and is ap-
proximately VT = 0.026 V at room temperature. The parameter n is usually called the
emission coefﬁcient or ideality factor, and its value is in the range 1 ≤n ≤2.
The emission coefﬁcient n takes into account any recombination of electrons
and holes in the space-charge region. At very low current levels, recombination may
be a signiﬁcant factor and the value of n may be close to 2. At higher current levels,
recombination is less a factor, and the value of n will be 1. Unless otherwise stated,
we will assume the emission coefﬁcient is n = 1.
This pn junction, with nonlinear rectifying current characteristics, is called a pn
junction diode.

Figure 1.17 Ideal I–V characteristics of a pn junction diode for IS = 10−14 A. The diode
current is an exponential function of diode voltage in the forward-bias region and is very
nearly zero in the reverse-bias region. The pn junction diode is a nonlinear electronic device.
Comment: Although IS is quite small, even a relatively small value of forward-bias
voltage can induce a moderate junction current. With a reverse-bias voltage applied,
the junction current is virtually zero.

Ex 1.7: (a) A silicon pn junction at T = 300 K has a reverse-saturation current of
IS = 2 × 10−14 A. Determine the required forward-bias voltage to produce a
current of (i) ID = 50 μA and (ii) ID = 1 mA. (b) Repeat part (a) for
IS = 2 × 10−12 A. (Ans. (a) (i) 0.563 V, (ii) 0.641 V; (b) (i) 0.443 V, (ii) 0.521 V).
pn Junction Diode
Figure 1.17 is a plot of the derived current–voltage characteristics of a pn junction.
For a forward-bias voltage, the current is an exponential function of voltage. Fig-
ure 1.18 depicts the forward-bias current plotted on a log scale. With only a small
change in the forward-bias voltage, the corresponding forward-bias current increases
by orders of magnitude. For a forward-bias voltage vD > +0.1 V, the (−1) term in
Equation (1.18) can be neglected. In the reverse-bias direction, the current is al-
most zero.
Figure 1.19 shows the diode circuit symbol and the conventional current direc-
tion and voltage polarity. The diode can be thought of and used as a voltage con-
trolled switch that is “off” for a reverse-bias voltage and “on” for a forward-bias
voltage. In the forward-bias or “on” state, a relatively large current is produced by a
fairly small applied voltage; in the reverse-bias, or “off” state, only a very small cur-
rent is created.
1.2.5

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
When a diode is reverse-biased by at least 0.1 V, the diode current is iD = −IS. The
current is in the reverse direction and is a constant, hence the name reverse-bias satura-
tion current. Real diodes, however, exhibit reverse-bias currents that are considerably
larger than IS. This additional current is called a generation current and is due to electrons
and holes being generated within the space-charge region. Whereas a typical value of IS
may be 10−14 A, a typical value of reverse-bias current may be 10−9 A or 1 nA. Even
though this current is much larger than IS, it is still small and negligible in most cases.
Temperature Effects
Since both IS and VT are functions of temperature, the diode characteristics also vary with
temperature. The temperature-related variations in forward-bias characteristics are illus-
trated in Figure 1.20. For a given current, the required forward-bias voltage decreases as
temperature increases. For silicon diodes, the change is approximately 2 mV/°C.
The parameter IS is a function of the intrinsic carrier concentration ni, which in
turn is strongly dependent on temperature. Consequently, the value of IS approxi-
mately doubles for every 5 °C increase in temperature. The actual reverse-bias diode
current, as a general rule, doubles for every 10 °C rise in temperature. As an example
of the importance of this effect, the relative value of ni in germanium, is large,
resulting in a large reverse-saturation current in germanium-based diodes. Increases
in this reverse current with increases in the temperature make the germanium diode
highly impractical for most circuit applications.
Breakdown Voltage
When a reverse-bias voltage is applied to a pn junction, the electric ﬁeld in the space-
charge region increases. The electric ﬁeld may become large enough that covalent

bonds are broken and electron–hole pairs are created. Electrons are swept into the
n-region and holes are swept into the p-region by the electric ﬁeld, generating a large
reverse bias current. This phenomenon is called breakdown. The reverse-bias cur-
rent created by the breakdown mechanism is limited only by the external circuit. If
the current is not sufﬁciently limited, a large power can be dissipated in the junction
that may damage the device and cause burnout. The current–voltage characteristic of
a diode in breakdown is shown in Figure 1.21.
The most common breakdown mechanism is called avalanche breakdown,
which occurs when carriers crossing the space charge region gain sufﬁcient kinetic
energy from the high electric ﬁeld to be able to break covalent bonds during a
collision process. The basic avalanche multiplication process is demonstrated in
Figure 1.22. The generated electron–hole pairs can themselves be involved in a col-
lision process generating additional electron–hole pairs, thus the avalanche
process. The breakdown voltage is a function of the doping concentrations in the

n- and p-regions of the junction. Larger doping concentrations result in smaller
breakdown voltages.
A second breakdown mechanism is called Zener breakdown and is a result of
tunneling of carriers across the junction. This effect is prominent at very high doping
concentrations and results in breakdown voltages less than 5 V.
The voltage at which breakdown occurs depends on fabrication parameters of the
pn junction, but is usually in the range of 50 to 200 V for discrete devices, although
breakdown voltages outside this range are possible—in excess of 1000 V, for example.
A pn junction is usually rated in terms of its peak inverse voltage or PIV. The PIV of a
diode must never be exceeded in circuit operation if reverse breakdown is to be avoided.
Diodes can be fabricated with a speciﬁcally designed breakdown voltage and are
designed to operate in the breakdown region. These diodes are called Zener diodes
and are discussed later in this chapter as well as in the next chapter.
Switching Transient
Since the pn junction diode can be used as an electrical switch, an important para-
meter is its transient response, that is, its speed and characteristics, as it is switched
from one state to the other. Assume, for example, that the diode is switched from the
forward-bias “on” state to the reverse-bias “off” state. Figure 1.23 shows a simple
circuit that will switch the applied voltage at time t = 0. For t < 0, the forward-bias
current iD is
iD = IF = VF −vD
RF
(1.19)
The minority carrier concentrations for an applied forward-bias voltage and an
applied reverse-bias voltage are shown in Figure 1.24. Here, we neglect the change
in the space charge region width. When a forward-bias voltage is applied, excess
minority carrier charge is stored in both the p- and n-regions. The excess charge is the
difference between the minority carrier concentrations for a forward-bias voltage and
those for a reverse-bias voltage as indicated in the ﬁgure. This charge must be
removed when the diode is switched from the forward to the reverse bias.

Figure 1.25 Current characteristics versus time during diode switching
As the forward-bias voltage is removed, relatively large diffusion currents are
created in the reverse-bias direction. This happens because the excess minority car-
rier electrons ﬂow back across the junction into the n-region, and the excess minor-
ity carrier holes ﬂow back across the junction into the p-region.
The large reverse-bias current is initially limited by resistor RR to approximately
iD = −IR ∼= −VR
RR
(1.20)
The junction capacitances do not allow the junction voltage to change instanta-
neously. The reverse current IR is approximately constant for 0+ < t < ts, where ts is
the storage time, which is the length of time required for the minority carrier con-
centrations at the space-charge region edges to reach the thermal equilibrium values.
After this time, the voltage across the junction begins to change. The fall time tf is
typically deﬁned as the time required for the current to fall to 10 percent of its initial
value. The total turn-off time is the sum of the storage time and the fall time.
Figure 1.25 shows the current characteristics as this entire process takes place.
In order to switch a diode quickly, the diode must have a small excess minority
carrier lifetime, and we must be able to produce a large reverse current pulse.
Therefore, in the design of diode circuits, we must provide a path for the transient
reverse-bias current pulse. These same transient effects impact the switching of tran-
sistors. For example, the switching speed of transistors in digital circuits will affect
the speed of computers.
The turn-on transient occurs when the diode is switched from the “off” state to
the forward-bias “on” state, which can be initiated by applying a forward-bias current
pulse. The transient turn-on time is the time required to establish the forward-bias
minority carrier distributions. During this time, the voltage across the junction grad-
ually increases toward its steady-state value. Although the turn-on time for the pn
junction diode is not zero, it is usually less than the transient turn-off time.

DIODE CIRCUITS: DC ANALYSIS AND MODELS
Objective: • Examine dc analysis techniques for diode circuits using
various models to describe the diode characteristics.
In this section, we begin to study the diode in various circuit configurations. As
we have seen, the diode is a two-terminal device with nonlinear i–v characteris-
tics, as opposed to a two-terminal resistor, which has a linear relationship between
current and voltage. The analysis of nonlinear electronic circuits is not as straight-
forward as the analysis of linear electric circuits. However, there are electronic
functions that can be implemented only by nonlinear circuits. Examples include
the generation of dc voltages from sinusoidal voltages and the implementation of
logic functions.
Mathematical relationships, or models, that describe the current–voltage
characteristics of electrical elements allow us to analyze and design circuits without
having to fabricate and test them in the laboratory. An example is Ohm’s law, which
describes the properties of a resistor. In this section, we will develop the dc analysis
and modeling techniques of diode circuits.
This section considers the current–voltage characteristics of the pn junction
diode in order to construct various circuit models. Large-signal models are initially
developed that describe the behavior of the device with relatively large changes in
voltages and currents. These models simplify the analysis of diode circuits and make
the analysis of relatively complex circuits much easier. In the next section, we will
consider a small-signal model of the diode that will describe the behavior of the pn
junction with small changes in voltages and currents. It is important to understand the
difference between large-signal and small-signal models and the conditions when
they are used.
To begin to understand diode circuits, consider a simple diode application. The
current–voltage characteristics of the pn junction diode were given in Figure 1.17.
An ideal diode (as opposed to a diode with ideal I–V characteristics) has the char-
acteristics shown in Figure 1.26(a). When a reverse-bias voltage is applied, the cur-
rent through the diode is zero (Figure 1.26(b)); when current through the diode is
greater than zero, the voltage across the diode is zero (Figure 1.26(c)). An external
circuit connected to the diode must be designed to control the forward current
through the diode.
One diode circuit is the rectiﬁer circuit shown in Figure 1.27(a). Assume that
the input voltage vI is a sinusoidal signal, as shown in Figure 1.27(b), and the diode
is an ideal diode (see Figure 1.26(a)). During the positive half-cycle of the sinusoidal

input, a forward-bias current exists in the diode and the voltage across the diode is
zero. The equivalent circuit for this condition is shown in Figure 1.27(c). The output
voltage vO is then equal to the input voltage. During the negative half-cycle of the
sinusoidal input, the diode is reverse biased. The equivalent circuit for this condition
is shown in Figure 1.27(d). In this part of the cycle, the diode acts as an open circuit,
the current is zero, and the output voltage is zero. The output voltage of the circuit is
shown in Figure 1.27(e).
Over the entire cycle, the input signal is sinusoidal and has a zero average value;
however, the output signal contains only positive values and therefore has a positive
average value. Consequently, this circuit is said to rectify the input signal, which is
the ﬁrst step in generating a dc voltage from a sinusoidal (ac) voltage. A dc voltage is
required in virtually all electronic circuits.
As mentioned, the analysis of nonlinear circuits is not as straightforward as that
of linear circuits. In this section, we will look at four approaches to the dc analysis of
diode circuits: (a) iteration; (b) graphical techniques; (c) a piecewise linear modeling
method; and (d) a computer analysis. Methods (a) and (b) are closely related and are
therefore presented together.

Iteration and Graphical Analysis Techniques
Iteration means using trial and error to ﬁnd a solution to a problem. The graphical
analysis technique involves plotting two simultaneous equations and locating their
point of intersection, which is the solution to the two equations. We will use both
techniques to solve the circuit equations, which include the diode equation. These
equations are difﬁcult to solve by hand because they contain both linear and expo-
nential terms.
Consider, for example, the circuit shown in Figure 1.28, with a dc voltage VPS
applied across a resistor and a diode. Kirchhoff’s voltage law applies both to non-

Objective: Determine the diode voltage and current for the circuit shown in 
Figure 1.28.

If we ﬁrst try VD = 0.60 V, the right side of Equation (1.24) is 2.7 V, so the equa-

side of Equation (1.24) is 15.1 V. Again, the equation is not balanced, but we can
see that the solution for VD is between 0.6 and 0.65 V. If we continue reﬁning our
guesses, we will be able to show that, when VD = 0.619 V, the right side of Equa-
tion (1.29) is 4.99 V, which is essentially equal to the value of the left side of the
equation.

The current in the circuit can then be determined by dividing the voltage differ-
ence across the resistor by the resistance, or
ID = VPS −VD

Comment: Once the diode voltage is known, the current can also be determined
from the ideal diode equation. However, dividing the voltage difference across a re-
sistor by the resistance is usually easier, and this approach is used extensively in the
analysis of diode and transistor circuits.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.8: Consider the circuit in Figure 1.28. Let VPS = 4 V, R = 4 k, and
IS = 10−12A. Determine VD and ID, using the ideal diode equation and the itera-
tion method. (Ans. VD = 0.535 V, ID = 0.866 mA)
To use a graphical approach to analyze the circuit, we go back to Kirchhoff’s
voltage law, as expressed by Equation (1.21(a)), which was VPS = ID R + VD. Solv-
ing for the current ID, we have
ID = VPS
R
−VD
R
which was also given by Equation (1.21(b)). This equation gives a linear relation be-
tween the diode current ID and the diode voltage VD for a given power supply volt-
age VPS and resistance R. This equation is referred to as the circuit load line, and is
usually plotted on a graph with the current ID as the vertical axis and the voltage VD
as the horizontal axis.
From Equation (1.21(b)), we see that if ID = 0, then VD = VPS which is the
horizontal axis intercept. Also from this equation, if VD = 0, then ID = VPS/R
which is the vertical axis intercept. The load line can be drawn between these two
points. From Equation (1.21(b)), we see that the slope of the load line is −1/R.
Using the values given in Example (1.8), we can plot the straight line shown in
Figure 1.29. The second plot in the ﬁgure is that of Equation (1.22), which is the ideal
diode equation relating the diode current and voltage. The intersection of the load
line and the device characteristics curve provides the dc current ID ≈2.2 mA
through the diode and the dc voltage VD ≈0.62 V across the diode. This point is
referred to as the quiescent point, or the Q-point.
The graphical analysis method can yield accurate results, but it is somewhat
cumbersome. However, the concept of the load line and the graphical approach are
useful for “visualizing” the response of a circuit, and the load line is used extensively
in the evaluation of electronic circuits.
Piecewise Linear Model
Another, simpler way to analyze diode circuits is to approximate the diode’s
current–voltage characteristics, using linear relationships or straight lines. Figure 1.30,
for example, shows the ideal current–voltage characteristics and two linear
approximations.
1.3.2

For VD ≥Vγ , we assume a straight-line approximation whose slope is 1/rf ,
where Vγ is the turn-on, or cut-in, voltage of the diode, and rf is the forward diode
resistance. The equivalent circuit for this linear approximation is a constant-voltage
source in series with a resistor (Figure 1.31(a)).2 For VD < Vγ , we assume a straight-line

VD ≥Vγ . When VD < Vγ , the Vγ source does not produce a negative diode current. For VD < Vγ , the
equivalent circuit in Figure 1.31(b) must be used.

approximation parallel with the VD axis at the zero current level. In this case, the
equivalent circuit is an open circuit (Figure 1.31(b)).
This method models the diode with segments of straight lines; thus the name
piecewise linear model. If we assume rf = 0, the piecewise linear diode character-
istics are shown in Figure 1.31(c).
EXAMPLE 1.9
Objective: Determine the diode voltage and current in the circuit shown in Fig-
ure 1.28, using a piecewise linear model. Also determine the power dissipated in the
diode.
Assume piecewise linear diode parameters of Vγ = 0.6 V and rf = 10 .
Solution: With the given input voltage polarity, the diode is forward biased or
“turned on,” so ID > 0. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 1.31(a). The diode
current is determined by
ID = VPS −Vγ
R + rf
=
5 −0.6
2 × 103 + 10 ⇒2.19 mA
and the diode voltage is
VD = Vγ + IDrf = 0.6 + (2.19 × 10−3)(10) = 0.622 V
The power dissipated in the diode is given by
PD = IDVD
We then ﬁnd
PD = (2.19)(0.622) = 1.36 mW
Comment: This solution, obtained using the piecewise linear model, is nearly equal
to the solution obtained in Example 1.8, in which the ideal diode equation was used.
However, the analysis using the piecewise-linear model in this example is by far eas-
ier than using the actual diode I–V characteristics as was done in Example 1.8. In
general, we are willing to accept some slight analysis inaccuracy for ease of analysis.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.9: (a) Consider the circuit shown in Figure 1.28. Let VPS = 8 V and
Vγ = 0.7 V, Assume rf = 0. Calculate the value of R such that ID = 1.20 mA.
(b) If VPS is reduced to 4 V and R is changed to 3.5 k, determine the power dis-
sipated in the diode. (Ans. (a) 6.08 k, (b) 0.66 mW).
Because the forward diode resistance rf in Example 1.9 is much smaller than the
circuit resistance R, the diode current ID is essentially independent of the value of rf .
In addition, if the cut-in voltage is 0.7 V instead of 0.6 V, the calculated diode current
will be 2.15 mA, which is not signiﬁcantly different from the previous results. There-
fore, the calculated diode current is not a strong function of the cut-in voltage.
Consequently, we will often assume a cut-in voltage of 0.7 V for silicon pn junction
diodes.
The concept of the load line and the piecewise linear model can be combined in
diode circuit analyses. From Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the load line for the circuit
shown in Figure 1.28 and for the piecewise linear model of the diode can be written
as
VPS = ID R + Vγ
where Vγ is the diode cut-in voltage. We can assume Vγ = 0.7 V. Various load lines
can be determined and plotted for the following circuit conditions:
A: VPS = 5 V,
R = 2 k
B: VPS = 5 V,
R = 4 k
C: VPS = 2.5 V, R = 2 k
D: VPS = 2.5 V, R = 4 k
The load line for condition A is plotted in Figure 1.32(a). Also plotted in the ﬁgure
are the piecewise linear characteristics of the diode. The intersection of the two
curves corresponds to the Q-point. For this case, the quiescent diode current is
IDQ ∼= 2.15 mA.
Figure 1.32(b) shows the same piecewise linear characteristics of the diode. In
addition, all four load lines, deﬁned by the conditions listed above in A, B, C, and D
are plotted on the ﬁgure. We see that the Q-point of the diode is a function of the load
line. The Q-point changes for each load line.
The load line concept is also useful when the diode is reverse biased. Figure 1.33 (a)
shows the same diode circuit as before, but with the direction of the diode reversed.

The diode current ID and voltage VD shown are the usual forward-biased parameters.
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we can write
VPS = IPS R −VD = −ID R −VD
(1.25(a))
or
ID = −VPS

(1.25(b))
where ID = −IPS. Equation (1.25(b)) is the load line equation. The two end points
are found by setting ID = 0, which yields VD = −VPS = −5 V, and by setting
VD = 0, which yields ID = −VPS/R = −5/2 = −2.5 mA. The diode characteris-
tics and the load line are plotted in Figure 1.33(b). We see that the load line is now in
the third quadrant, where it intersects the diode characteristics curve at VD = −5 V
and ID = 0, demonstrating that the diode is reverse biased.
Although the piecewise linear model may yield solutions that are less accurate
than those obtained with the ideal diode equation, the analysis is much easier.
Computer Simulation and Analysis
Today’s computers are capable of using detailed simulation models of various com-
ponents and performing complex circuit analyses quickly and relatively easily. Such
models can factor in many diverse conditions, such as the temperature dependence of
various parameters. One of the earliest, and now the most widely used, circuit analy-
sis programs is the simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE).
This program, developed at the University of California at Berkeley, was ﬁrst re-
leased about 1973, and has been continuously reﬁned since that time. One outgrowth
of SPICE is PSpice, which is designed for use on personal computers.
EXAMPLE 1.10
Objective: Determine the diode current and voltage characteristics of the circuit
shown in Figure 1.28 using a PSpice analysis.
Solution: Figure 1.34(a) is the PSpice circuit schematic diagram. A standard
1N4002 diode from the PSpice library was used in the analysis. The input voltage V1
was varied (dc sweep) from 0 to 5 V. Figure 1.34(b) and (c) shows the diode voltage
and diode current characteristics versus the input voltage.

Discussion: Several observations may be made from the results. The diode voltage
increases at almost a linear rate up to approximately 400 mV without any discernible
(mA) current being measured. For an input voltage greater than approximately
500 mV, the diode voltage increases gradually to a value of about 610 mV at the max-
imum input voltage. The current also increases to a maximum value of approximately
2.2 mA at the maximum input voltage. The piecewise linear model predicts quite
accurate results at the maximum input voltage. However, these results show that there is
deﬁnitely a non-linear relation between the diode current and diode voltage. We must
keep in mind that the piecewise linear model is an approximation technique that
works very well in many applications.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.10: The resistor parameter in the circuit shown in Figure 1.28 is changed to
R = 20 k. Using a PSpice analysis, plot the diode current ID and diode voltage
VD versus the power supply voltage VPS over the range 0 ≤VPS ≤10 V.
Summary of Diode Models
The two dc diode models used in the hand analysis of diode circuits are: the ideal
diode equation and the piecewise linear approximation. For the ideal diode equation,
the reverse-saturation current IS must be speciﬁed. For the piecewise linear model,
the cut-in voltage Vγ and forward diode resistance rf must be speciﬁed. In most
cases, however, rf is assumed to be zero unless otherwise given.
The particular model that should be used in a speciﬁc application or situation is
a compromise between accuracy and ease of calculation. This decision comes with
experience. In general, a simple model can be used in an initial design for ease of

accuracy. However, it is very important to understand that the diode model or diode
parameters used in the computer simulation must correspond to the actual diode
parameters used in the circuit to ensure that the results are meaningful.

DIODE CIRCUITS: AC EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT
Objective: • Develop an equivalent circuit for a diode that is used
when a small, time-varying signal is applied to a diode circuit.
Up to this point, we have only looked at the dc characteristics of the pn junction
diode. When semiconductor devices with pn junctions are used in linear ampliﬁer
circuits, the time-varying, or ac, characteristics of the pn junction become important,
because sinusoidal signals may be superimposed on the dc currents and voltages. The
following sections examine these ac characteristics.
Sinusoidal Analysis
In the circuit shown in Figure 1.35(a), the voltage source vi is assumed to be a sinu-
soidal, or time-varying, signal. The total input voltage vI is composed of a dc
component VPS and an ac component vi superimposed on the dc value. To investigate
this circuit, we will look at two types of analyses: a dc analysis involving only the dc
voltages and currents, and an ac analysis involving only the ac voltages and currents.
Current–Voltage Relationships
Since the input voltage contains a dc component with an ac signal superimposed,
the diode current will also contain a dc component with an ac signal superimposed, as
shown in Figure 1.35(b). Here, IDQ is the dc quiescent diode current. In addition, the
diode voltage will contain a dc value with an ac signal superimposed, as shown in
Figure 1.35(c). For this analysis, assume that the ac signal is small compared to the dc
component, so that a linear ac model can be developed from the nonlinear diode.

· vd = gd · vd
(1.31(a))
or

The parameters gd and rd, respectively, are the diode small-signal incremental con-
ductance and resistance, also called the diffusion conductance and diffusion
resistance. We see from these two equations that
rd = 1
gd
= VT
IDQ
(1.32)
This equation tells us that the incremental resistance is a function of the dc bias cur-
rent IDQ and is inversely proportional to the slope of the I–V characteristics curve, as
shown in Figure 1.35(d).
Circuit Analysis
To analyze the circuit shown in Figure 1.35(a), we ﬁrst perform a dc analysis and
then an ac analysis. These two types of analyses will use two equivalent circuits.
Figure 1.36(a) is the dc equivalent circuit that we have seen previously. If the diode
is forward biased, then the voltage across the diode is the piecewise linear turn-on
voltage.
Figure 1.36(b) is the ac equivalent circuit. The diode has been replaced by its
equivalent resistance rd. All parameters in this circuit are the small-signal time-
varying parameters.

Solution: Divide the analysis into two parts: the dc analysis and the ac analysis.
For the dc analysis, we set vi = 0 and then determine the dc quiescent current

IDQ = VPS −Vγ

The dc value of the output voltage is
Vo = IDQ R = (0.88)(5) = 4.4 V
For the ac analysis, we consider only the ac signals and parameters in the circuit
in Figure 1.36(b). In other words, we effectively set VPS = 0. The ac Kirchhoff volt-
age law (KVL) equation becomes
vi = idrd + id R = id(rd + R)
where rd is again the small-signal diode diffusion resistance. From Equation (1.32),
we have
rd = VT

The ac diode current is
id =

rd + R = 0.1 sin ωt
0.0295 + 5 ⇒19.9 sin ωt (μA)
The ac component of the output voltage is
vo = id R = 0.0995 sin ωt (V)
Comment: Throughout the text, we will divide the circuit analysis into a dc analysis
and an ac analysis. To do so, we will use separate equivalent circuit models for each
analysis.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.11: (a) The circuit and diode parameters for the circuit shown in Figure
1.35(a) are VPS = 8 V, R = 20 k, Vγ = 0.7 V, and vi = 0.25 sin ωt (V). Deter-
mine the quiescent diode current and the time-varying diode current. (b) Repeat
part (a) if the resistor is changed to R = 10 k. (Ans. (a) IDQ = 0.365 mA,
id = 12.5 sin ωt(μA); (b) IDQ = 0.730 mA, id = 24.9 sin ωt(μA)).
Frequency Response
In the previous analysis, we implicitly assumed that the frequency of the ac signal
was small enough that capacitance effects in the circuit would be negligible. If the
frequency of the ac input signal increases, the diffusion capacitance associated with
a forward-biased pn junction becomes important. The source of the diffusion capac-
itance is shown in Figure 1.37.
Consider the minority carrier hole concentration on the right side of the ﬁgure.
At the quiescent diode voltage, VDQ, the minority carrier hole concentration is shown
as the solid line and indicated by pn|VDQ.

Chapter 1 Semiconductor Materials and Diodes
47
If the total diode voltage increases by V during the positive half cycle of a
sinusoidal signal superimposed on the quiescent value, the hole concentration will in-
crease to that shown by the dotted line indicated by pn|VDQ+V . Now, if the total diode
voltage decreases byV during the negative half cycle of a sinusoidal signal superim-
posed on the quiescent value, the hole concentration will decrease to that shown by the
dotted line indicated by pn|VDQ−V . The +Q charge is alternately being charged and
discharged through the pn junction as the voltage across the junction changes.
The same process is occurring with the minority carrier electrons in the p-region.
The diffusion capacitance is the change in the stored minority carrier charge that
is caused by a change in the voltage, or
Cd = dQ
dVD
(1.33)
The diffusion capacitance Cd is normally much larger than the junction capacitance
Cj, because of the magnitude of the charges involved.
Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit
The small-signal equivalent circuit of the forward-biased pn junction is shown in
Figure 1.38 and is developed partially from the equation for the admittance, which
is given by
Y = gd + jωCd
(1.34)
where gd and Cd are the diffusion conductance and capacitance, respectively. We
must also add the junction capacitance, which is in parallel with the diffusion resis-
tance and capacitance, and a series resistance, which is required because of the ﬁnite
resistances in the neutral n- and p-regions.
The small-signal equivalent circuit of the pn junction is used to obtain the ac
response of a diode circuit subjected to ac signals superimposed on the Q-point
values. Small-signal equivalent circuits of pn junctions are also used to develop
small-signal models of transistors, and these models are used in the analysis and
design of transistor ampliﬁers.

OTHER DIODE TYPES
Objective: • Gain an understanding of the properties and character-
istics of a few specialized diodes.
There are many other types of diodes with specialized characteristics that are
useful in particular applications. We will brieﬂy consider only a few of these diodes.
We will consider the solar cell, photodiode, light-emitting diode, Schottky diode, and
Zener diode.
Solar Cell
A solar cell is a pn junction device with no voltage directly applied across the junc-
tion. The pn junction, which converts solar energy into electrical energy, is connected
to a load as indicated in Figure 1.39. When light hits the space-charge region, elec-
trons and holes are generated. They are quickly separated and swept out of the space-
charge region by the electric ﬁeld, thus creating a photocurrent. The generated
photocurrent will produce a voltage across the load, which means that the solar cell
has supplied power. Solar cells are usually fabricated from silicon, but may be made
from GaAs or other III–V compound semiconductors.
Solar cells have long been used to power the electronics in satellites and space
vehicles, and also as the power supply to some calculators. Solar cells are also used
to power race cars in a Sunrayce event. Collegiate teams in the United States design,

build and drive the race cars. Typically, a Sunrayce car has 8 m2 of solar cell arrays
that can produce 800 W of power on a sunny day at noon. The power from the solar
array can be used either to power an electric motor or to charge a battery pack.
Photodiode
Photodetectors are devices that convert optical signals into electrical signals. An
example is the photodiode, which is similar to a solar cell except that the pn junction
is operated with a reverse-bias voltage. Incident photons or light waves create excess
electrons and holes in the space-charge region. These excess carriers are quickly sep-
arated and swept out of the space-charge region by the electric ﬁeld, thus creating a
“photocurrent.” This generated photocurrent is directly proportional to the incident
photon ﬂux.
Light-Emitting Diode
The light-emitting diode (LED) converts current to light. As previously explained,
when a forward-bias voltage is applied across a pn junction, electrons and holes ﬂow
across the space-charge region and become excess minority carriers. These excess
minority carriers diffuse into the neutral semiconductor regions, where they recom-
bine with majority carriers. If the semiconductor is a direct bandgap material, such
as GaAs, the electron and hole can recombine with no change in momentum, and a
photon or light wave can be emitted. Conversely, in an indirect bandgap material,
such as silicon, when an electron and hole recombine, both energy and momentum
must be conserved, so the emission of a photon is very unlikely. Therefore, LEDs
are fabricated from GaAs or other compound semiconductor materials. In an LED,
the diode current is directly proportional to the recombination rate, which means
that the output light intensity is also proportional to the diode current.
Monolithic arrays of LEDs are fabricated for numeric and alphanumeric dis-
plays, such as the readout of a digital voltmeter.
An LED may be integrated into an optical cavity to produce a coherent photon
output with a very narrow bandwidth. Such a device is a laser diode, which is used in
optical communications applications.
The LED can be used in conjunction with a photodiode to create an optical sys-
tem such as that shown in Figure 1.40. The light signal created may travel over

relatively long distances through the optical ﬁber, because of the low optical absorp-
tion in high-quality optical ﬁbers.
Schottky Barrier Diode
A Schottky barrier diode, or simply a Schottky diode, is formed when a metal, such
as aluminum, is brought into contact with a moderately doped n-type semiconduc-
tor to form a rectifying junction. Figure 1.41(a) shows the metal-semiconductor
contact, and Figure 1.41(b) shows the circuit symbol with the current direction and
voltage polarity.
The current–voltage characteristics of a Schottky diode are very similar to those
of a pn junction diode. The same ideal diode equation can be used for both devices.
However, there are two important differences between the two diodes that directly
affect the response of the Schottky diode.
First, the current mechanism in the two devices is different. The current in a pn
junction diode is controlled by the diffusion of minority carriers. The current in a
Schottky diode results from the ﬂow of majority carriers over the potential barrier at
the metallurgical junction. This means that there is no minority carrier storage in the
Schottky diode, so the switching time from a forward bias to a reverse bias is very
short compared to that of a pn junction diode. The storage time, ts, for a Schottky
diode is essentially zero.
Second, the reverse-saturation current IS for a Schottky diode is larger than that
of a pn junction diode for comparable device areas. This property means that it takes
less forward bias voltage to induce a particular current compared to a pn junction
diode. We will see an application of this in Chapter 17.
Figure 1.42 compares the characteristics of the two diodes. Applying the piece-
wise linear model, we can determine that the Schottky diode has a smaller turn-on

voltage than the pn junction diode. In later chapters, we will see how this lower
turn-on voltage and the shorter switching time make the Schottky diode useful in
integrated-circuit applications.
EXAMPLE 1.12
Objective: Determine diode voltages.
The reverse saturation currents of a pn junction diode and a Schottky diode
are IS = 10−12 A and 10−8 A, respectively. Determine the forward-bias voltages
required to produce 1 mA in each diode.
Solution: The diode current-voltage relationship is given by
ID = ISeVD/VT
Solving for the diode voltage, we obtain

Comment: Since the reverse-saturation current for the Schottky diode is relatively
large, less voltage across this diode is required to produce a given current compared
to the pn junction diode.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 1.12: A pn junction diode and a Schottky diode both have forward-bias
currents of 1.2 mA. The reverse-saturation current of the pn junction diode is
IS = 4 × 10−15 A. The difference in forward-bias voltages is 0.265 V. Determine
the reverse-saturation current of the Schottky diode. (Ans. IS = 1.07 × 10−10 A)
Another type of metal–semiconductor junction is also possible. A metal applied
to a heavily doped semiconductor forms, in most cases, an ohmic contact: that is, a
contact that conducts current equally in both directions, with very little voltage drop
across the junction. Ohmic contacts are used to connect one semiconductor device to
another on an IC, or to connect an IC to its external terminals.
Zener Diode
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the applied reverse-bias voltage cannot increase
without limit. At some point, breakdown occurs and the current in the reverse-bias

direction increases rapidly. The voltage at this point is called the breakdown voltage.
The diode I–V characteristics, including breakdown, are shown in Figure 1.43.
Diodes, called Zener diodes, can be designed and fabricated to provide a spec-
iﬁed breakdown voltage VZo. (Although the breakdown voltage is on the negative
voltage axis (reverse-bias), its value is given as a positive quantity.) The large current
that may exist at breakdown can cause heating effects and catastrophic failure of the
diode due to the large power dissipation in the device. However, diodes can be oper-
ated in the breakdown region by limiting the current to a value within the capabilities
of the device. Such a diode can be used as a constant-voltage reference in a circuit.
The diode breakdown voltage is essentially constant over a wide range of currents
and temperatures. The slope of the I–V characteristics curve in breakdown is quite
large, so the incremental resistance rz is small. Typically, rz is in the range of a few
ohms or tens of ohms.
The circuit symbol of the Zener diode is shown in Figure 1.44. (Note the subtle
difference between this symbol and the Schottky diode symbol.) The voltage VZ is
the Zener breakdown voltage, and the current IZ is the reverse-bias current when the
diode is operating in the breakdown region. We will see applications of the Zener
diode in the next chapter.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 1.13
Objective: Consider a simple constant-voltage reference circuit and design the
value of resistance required to limit the current in this circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 1.45. Assume that the Zener diode break-
down voltage is VZ = 5.6 V and the Zener resistance is rz = 0. The current in the
diode is to be limited to 3 mA.

Solution: As before, we can determine the current from the voltage difference across
R divided by the resistance. That is,

The resistance is then

The power dissipated in the Zener diode is
PZ = IZVZ = (3)(5.6) = 16.8 mW
The Zener diode must be able to dissipate 16.8 mW of power without being
damaged.
Comment: The resistance external to the Zener diode limits the current when the
diode is operating in the breakdown region. In the circuit shown in the ﬁgure, the out-
put voltage will remain constant at 5.6 V, even though the power supply voltage and
the resistance may change over a limited range. Hence, this circuit provides a con-
stant output voltage. We will see further applications of the Zener diode in the next
chapter.

DESIGN APPLICATION: DIODE THERMOMETER
Objective: • Design a simple electronic thermometer using the tem-
perature characteristics of a diode.
Speciﬁcations: The temperature range is to be 0 to 100 ◦F.
Design Approach: We will use the forward-bias diode temperature characteristics
as shown in Figure 1.20. If the diode current is held constant, the variation in diode
voltage is a function of temperature.
Choices: Assume that a silicon pn junction diode with a reverse-saturation current
of IS = 10−13 A at T = 300 K is available.
Solution: Neglecting the (−1) term in the diode I–V relation, we have
ID = ISeVD/VT ∝n2
i eVD/VT ∝e−Eg/kT · eVD/VT
The reverse-saturation current IS is proportional to n2
i and in turn n2
i is proportional
to the exponential function involving the bandgap energy Eg and temperature.
Taking the ratio of the diode current at two temperature values and using the
deﬁnition of thermal voltage, we have3
ID1
ID2
= e−Eg/kT1 · eeVD1/kT1
e−Eg/kT2 · eeVD2/kT2
(1.35)
where VD1 and VD2 are the diode voltages at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. If
the diode current is held constant at the different temperatures, Equation (1.35) can
be written as
eeVD2/kT2 = e−Eg/kT1e+Eg/kT2eeVD1/kT1
(1.36)
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain

the meaning clear.

Chapter 1 Semiconductor Materials and Diodes
55
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 1.47. Assume that the diode has a reverse-
saturation current of IS = 10−13 A at T = 300 K. From the circuit, we can write
ID = 15 −VD
R

or

By trial and error, we ﬁnd
VD = 0.5976 V
and
ID = 15 −0.5976
15 × 103
⇒0.960 mA
In Equation (1.39), we can set T1 = 300 K and let T2 ≡T be a variable temper-
ature. We ﬁnd
VD = 1.12 −0.522
 T


(1.40)
so the diode voltage is a linear function of temperature. If the temperature range is to
be from 0 to 100 ◦F, for example, the corresponding change in kelvins is from 255.2
to 310.8. The diode voltage versus temperature is plotted in Figure 1.48.
A simple circuit that can be used was shown in Figure 1.47. With a power sup-
ply voltage of 15 V, a change in diode voltage of approximately 0.1 V over the tem-
perature range produces only an approximately 0.67 percent change in diode current.
Thus the preceding analysis is valid.
Comment: This design example shows that a diode connected in a simple circuit
can be used as a sensing element in an electronic thermometer. We assumed a diode
reverse-saturation current of IS = 10−13 A at T = 300 K(80 ◦F). The actual reverse-
saturation current of a particular diode may be different. This difference simply
means that the diode voltage versus temperature curve shown in Figure 1.48 would
slide up or down to match the actual diode voltage at room temperature.

Design Pointer: In order to complete this design, two additional components or
electronic systems must be added to the circuit shown in Figure 1.47. First, we must
add a circuit to measure the diode voltage. Adding this circuit must not alter the diode
characteristics and there must be no loading effects. An op-amp circuit that will be
described in Chapter 9 can be used for this purpose. A second electronic system
required is to convert the diode voltage to a temperature reading. An analog-to-digital
converter that will be described in Chapter 16 can be used to provide a digital
temperature reading.

SUMMARY
•
We initially considered some of the characteristics and properties of semicon-
ductor materials, such as the concept of electrons (negative charge) and holes
(positive charge) as two distinct charge carriers in a semiconductor. The doping
process produces either n-type or p-type semiconductor materials. The concepts
of n-type and p-type materials are used throughout the text.
•
A pn junction diode is formed when an n-doped region and a p-doped region are
directly adjacent to each other. The diode current is an exponential function of
voltage in the forward-bias condition, and is essentially zero in the reverse-bias
condition.
•
A piecewise-linear model of the diode was developed so that approximate hand
calculation results can be easily obtained. The i −v characteristics of the diode
are broken into linear segments, which are valid over particular regions of oper-
ation. The concept of a diode turn-on voltage was introduced.
•
Time-varying, or ac signals, may be superimposed on a dc diode current and
voltage. A small-signal linear equivalent circuit was developed and is used to
determine the relationship between the ac current and ac voltage. This same
equivalent circuit will be applied extensively when the frequency response of
transistors is discussed.
•
Specialized pn junction devices were discussed. In particular, pn junction solar
cells are used to convert solar energy to electrical energy. Schottky barrier diodes
are metal–semiconductor rectifying junctions that, in general, have smaller turn-
on voltages than pn junctions. Zener diodes operate in the reverse breakdown
region and are used in constant-voltage circuits. Photodiodes and LEDs were
also brieﬂy discussed.
•
As an application, a simple diode thermometer was designed, based on the tem-
perature properties of the pn junction.

Chapter
Diode Circuits
22
In the last chapter, we discussed some of the properties of semiconductor materials
and introduced the diode. We presented the ideal current–voltage relationship of the
diode and considered the piecewise linear model, which simpliﬁes the dc analysis of
diode circuits. In this chapter, the techniques and concepts developed in Chapter 1
are used to analyze and design electronic circuits containing diodes. A general goal
of this chapter is to develop the ability to use the piecewise linear model and approx-
imation techniques in the hand analysis and design of various diode circuits.
Each circuit to be considered accepts an input signal at a set of input terminals
and produces an output signal at a set of output terminals. This process is called
signal processing. The circuit “processes” the input signal and produces an output
signal that is a different shape or a different function compared to the input signal.
We will see in this chapter how diodes are used to perform these various signal
processing functions.
Although diodes are useful electronic devices, we will begin to see the limita-
tions of these devices and the desirability of having some type of “amplifying”
device.

diagram are considered in this chapter.
1Ideally, the output voltage of a rectiﬁer circuit is a dc voltage. However, as we will see, there may be an
ac ripple voltage superimposed on a dc value. For this reason, we will use the notation vO as the instanta-
neous value of output voltage.
2.1
RECTIFIER CIRCUITS
Objective: • Determine the operation and characteristics of diode
rectiﬁer circuits, which form the ﬁrst stage in the process of converting
an ac signal into a dc signal in the electronic power supply.
One application of diodes is in the design of rectiﬁer circuits. A diode rectiﬁer forms the
ﬁrst stage of a dc power supply. A dc voltage is required to power essentially every elec-
tronic device, including personal computers, televisions, and stereo systems. An electri-
cal cord that is plugged into a wall socket and attached to a television, for example, is
connected to a rectiﬁer circuit inside the TV. In addition, battery chargers for portable
electronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers contain rectiﬁer circuits.
Figure 2.1 is a diagram of a dc power supply. The output voltage1 vO is usually
in the range of 3 to 24 V depending on the particular electronics application.
Throughout the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we will analyze and design various stages in
the power supply circuit.
Rectiﬁcation is the process of converting an alternating (ac) voltage into one that
is limited to one polarity. The diode is useful for this function because of its nonlin-
ear characteristics, that is, current exists for one voltage polarity, but is essentially
zero for the opposite polarity. Rectiﬁcation is classiﬁed as half-wave or full-wave,
with half-wave being the simpler and full-wave being more efﬁcient.
Half-Wave Rectiﬁcation
Figure 2.2(a) shows a power transformer with a diode and resistor connected to the
secondary of the transformer. We will use the piecewise linear approach in analyzing
this circuit, assuming the diode forward resistance is rf = 0 when the diode is “on.”
The input signal, vI, is, in general, a 120 V (rms), 60 Hz ac signal. Recall that the
secondary voltage, vS, and primary voltage, vI, of an ideal transformer are related by

where N1 and N2 are the number of primary and secondary turns, respectively. The
ratio N1/N2 is called the transformer turns ratio. The transformer turns ratio will
be designed to provide a particular secondary voltage, vS, which in turn will produce
a particular output voltage vO.
Problem-Solving Technique: Diode Circuits
In using the piecewise linear model of the diode, the ﬁrst objective is to determine
the linear region (conducting or not conducting) in which the diode is operating.
To do this, we can:
1.
Determine the input voltage condition such that a diode is conducting (on).
Then ﬁnd the output signal for this condition.
2.
Determine the input voltage condition such that a diode is not conducting
(off). Then ﬁnd the output signal for this condition.
[Note: Item 2 can be performed before item 1 if desired.]
Figure 2.2(b) shows the voltage transfer characteristics, vO versus vS, for the
circuit. For vS < 0, the diode is reverse biased, which means that the current is zero
and the output voltage is zero. As long as vS < Vγ , the diode will be nonconducting,
so the output voltage will remain zero. When vS > Vγ , the diode becomes forward
biased and a current is induced in the circuit. In this case, we can write
iD = vS −Vγ
R
(2.2(a))
and
vO = iD R = vS −Vγ
(2.2(b))
For vS > Vγ , the slope of the transfer curve is 1.
If vS is a sinusoidal signal, as shown in Figure 2.3(a), the output voltage can be
found using the voltage transfer curve in Figure 2.2(b). For vS ≤Vγ the output volt-
age is zero; for vS > Vγ , the output is given by Equation (2.2(b)), or
vO = vS −Vγ
and is shown in Figure 2.3(b). We can see that while the input signal vS alternates
polarity and has a time-average value of zero, the output voltage vO is unidirectional
and has an average value that is not zero. The input signal is therefore rectiﬁed. Also,
since the output voltage appears only during the positive cycle of the input signal, the
circuit is called a half-wave rectiﬁer.

current waveforms
When the diode is cut off and nonconducting, no voltage drop occurs across
the resistor R; therefore, the entire input signal voltage appears across the diode
(Figure 2.3(c)). Consequently, the diode must be capable of handling the peak
current in the forward direction and sustaining the largest peak inverse voltage (PIV)
without breakdown. For the circuit shown in Figure 2.2(a), the value of PIV is equal
to the peak value of vS.
We can use a half-wave rectiﬁer circuit to charge a battery as shown in Figure 2.4(a).
Charging current exists whenever the instantaneous ac source voltage is greater than
the battery voltage plus the diode cut-in voltage as shown in Figure 2.4(b). The resis-
tance R in the circuit is to limit the current. When the ac source voltage is less than VB,
the current is zero. Thus current ﬂows only in the direction to charge the battery. One
disadvantage of the half-wave rectiﬁer is that we “waste” the negative half-cycles. The
current is zero during the negative half-cycles, so there is no energy dissipated, but at
the same time, we are not making use of any possible available energy.
EXAMPLE 2.1
Objective: Determine the currents and voltages in a half-wave rectiﬁer circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 2.4. Assume VB = 12 V, R = 100 , and

third of the time, which means that the efﬁciency of this battery charger is quite low.

Full-Wave Rectiﬁcation
The full-wave rectiﬁer inverts the negative portions of the sine wave so that a unipo-
lar output signal is generated during both halves of the input sinusoid. One example
of a full-wave rectiﬁer circuit appears in Figure 2.5(a). The input to the rectiﬁer con-
sists of a power transformer, in which the input is normally a 120 V (rms), 60 Hz ac
signal, and the two outputs are from a center-tapped secondary winding that provides
equal voltages vS, with the polarities shown. When the input line voltage is positive,
both output signal voltages vS are also positive.
The primary winding connected to the 120 V ac source has N1 windings, and
each half of the secondary winding has N2 windings. The value of the vS output volt-
age is 120 (N2/N1) volts (rms). The turns ratio of the transformer, usually desig-
nated (N1/N2) can be designed to “step down” the input line voltage to a value that
will produce a particular dc output voltage from the rectiﬁer.
The input power transformer also provides electrical isolation between the pow-
erline circuit and the electronic circuits to be biased by the rectiﬁer circuit. This iso-
lation reduces the risk of electrical shock.

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
During the positive half of the input voltage cycle, both output voltages vS are
positive; therefore, diode D1 is forward biased and conducting and D2 is reverse
biased and cut off. The current through D1 and the output resistance produce a posi-
tive output voltage. During the negative half cycle, D1 is cut off and D2 is forward
biased, or “on,” and the current through the output resistance again produces a posi-
tive output voltage. If we assume that the forward diode resistance rf of each diode
is small and negligible, we obtain the voltage transfer characteristics, vO versus vS,
shown in Figure 2.5(b).
For a sinusoidal input voltage, we can determine the output voltage versus time
by using the voltage transfer curve shown in Figure 2.5(b). When vS > Vγ , D1 is on
and the output voltage is vO = vS −Vγ . When vS is negative, then for vS < −Vγ or
−vS > Vγ , D2 is on and the output voltage is vO = −vS −Vγ . The corresponding
input and output voltage signals are shown in Figure 2.5(c). Since a rectiﬁed output
voltage occurs during both the positive and negative cycles of the input signal, this
circuit is called a full-wave rectiﬁer.
Another example of a full-wave rectiﬁer circuit appears in Figure 2.6(a). This cir-
cuit is a bridge rectiﬁer, which still provides electrical isolation between the input ac
powerline and the rectiﬁer output, but does not require a center-tapped secondary wind-
ing. However, it does use four diodes, compared to only two in the previous circuit.
During the positive half of the input voltage cycle, vS is positive, D1 and D2 are
forward biased, D3 and D4 are reverse biased, and the direction of the current is as
shown in Figure 2.6(a). During the negative half-cycle of the input voltage, vS is neg-
ative, and D3 and D4 are forward biased. The direction of the current, shown in
Figure 2.6(b), produces the same output voltage polarity as before.
Figure 2.6(c) shows the sinusoidal voltage vS and the rectiﬁed output voltage
vO. Because two diodes are in series in the conduction path, the magnitude of vO is
two diode drops less than the magnitude of vS.
One difference to be noted in the bridge rectiﬁer circuit in Figure 2.6(a) and the
rectiﬁer in Figure 2.5(a) is the ground connection. Whereas the center tap of the
secondary winding of the circuit in Figure 2.5(a) is at ground potential, the secondary

winding of the bridge circuit (Figure 2.6(a)) is not directly grounded. One side of the
load R is grounded, but the secondary of the transformer is not.
EXAMPLE 2.2
Objective: Compare voltages and the transformer turns ratio in two full-wave recti-
ﬁer circuits.
Consider the rectiﬁer circuits shown in Figures 2.5(a) and 2.6(a). Assume the
input voltage is from a 120 V (rms), 60 Hz ac source. The desired peak output volt-
age vO is 9 V, and the diode cut-in voltage is assumed to be Vγ = 0.7 V.
Solution: For the center-tapped transformer circuit shown in Figure 2.5(a), a peak
voltage of vO(max) = 9 V means that the peak value of vS is
vS(max) = vO(max) + Vγ = 9 + 0.7 = 9.7 V
For a sinusoidal signal, this produces an rms value of
vS,rms = 9.7

= 6.86 V
The turns ratio of the primary to each secondary winding must then be

For the bridge circuit shown in Figure 2.6(a), a peak voltage of vO(max) = 9 V
means that the peak value of vS is
vS(max) = vO(max) + 2Vγ = 9 + 2(0.7) = 10.4 V
For a sinusoidal signal, this produces an rms value of
vS,rms = 10.4

For the center-tapped rectiﬁer, the peak inverse voltage (PIV) of a diode is
PIV = vR(max) = 2vS(max) −Vγ = 2(9.7) −0.7 = 18.7 V
For the bridge rectiﬁer, the peak inverse voltage of a diode is
PIV = vR(max) = vS(max) −Vγ = 10.4 −0.7 = 9.7 V
Comment: These calculations demonstrate the advantages of the bridge rectiﬁer
over the center-tapped transformer circuit. First, only half as many turns are required
for the secondary winding in the bridge rectiﬁer. This is true because only half of the
secondary winding of the center-tapped transformer is utilized at any one time. Sec-
ond, for the bridge circuit, the peak inverse voltage that any diode must sustain with-
out breakdown is only half that of the center-tapped transformer circuit.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.2: Consider the bridge circuit shown in Figure 2.6(a) with an input voltage
vS = VM sin ωt. Assume a diode cut-in voltage of Vγ = 0.7V. Determine the frac-
tion (percent) of time that the diode D1 is conducting for peak sinusoidal voltages
of (a) VM = 12 V and (b) VM = 4 V. (Ans. (a) 46.3% (b) 38.6%)
Because of the advantages demonstrated in Example 2.2 the bridge rectiﬁer cir-
cuit is used more often than the center-tapped transformer circuit.
Both full-wave rectiﬁer circuits discussed (Figures 2.5 and 2.6) produce a posi-
tive output voltage. As we will see in the next chapter discussing transistor circuits,
there are times when a negative dc voltage is also required. We can produce negative
rectiﬁcation by reversing the direction of the diodes in either circuit. Figure 2.7(a)
shows the bridge circuit with the diodes reversed compared to those in Figure 2.6.
The direction of current is shown during the positive half cycle of vS. The output
voltage is now negative with respect to ground potential. During the negative half
cycle of vS, the complementary diodes turn on and the direction of current through
the load is the same, producing a negative output voltage. The input and output volt-
ages are shown in Figure 2.7(b).

Filters, Ripple Voltage, and Diode Current
If a capacitor is added in parallel with the load resistor of a half-wave rectiﬁer to form
a simple ﬁlter circuit (Figure 2.8(a)), we can begin to transform the half-wave sinu-
soidal output into a dc voltage. Figure 2.8(b) shows the positive half of the output
sine wave, and the beginning portion of the voltage across the capacitor, assuming
the capacitor is initially uncharged. If we assume that the diode forward resistance is
rf = 0, which means that the rf C time constant is zero, the voltage across the ca-
pacitor follows this initial portion of the signal voltage. When the signal voltage
reaches its peak and begins to decrease, the voltage across the capacitor also starts to
decrease, which means the capacitor starts to discharge. The only discharge current
path is through the resistor. If the RC time constant is large, the voltage across the ca-
pacitor discharges exponentially with time (Figure 2.8(c)). During this time period,
the diode is cut off.
A more detailed analysis of the circuit response when the input voltage is near
its peak value indicates a subtle difference between actual circuit operation and the
qualitative description. If we assume that the diode turns off immediately when the
input voltage starts to decrease from its peak value, then the output voltage will de-
crease exponentially with time, as previously indicated. An exaggerated sketch of
these two voltages is shown in Figure 2.8(d). The output voltage decreases at a faster
rate than the input voltage, which means that at time t1, the difference between vI and

Figure 2.9 Output voltage of a full-wave rectiﬁer with an RC ﬁlter showing the ripple voltage
vO, that is, the voltage across the diode, is greater than Vγ . However, this condition
cannot exist. Therefore, the diode does not turn off immediately. If the RC time
constant is large, there is only a small difference between the time of the peak input
voltage and the time the diode turns off. In this situation, a computer analysis may
provide more accurate results than an approximate hand analysis.
During the next positive cycle of the input voltage, there is a point at which the
input voltage is greater than the capacitor voltage, and the diode turns back on. The
diode remains on until the input reaches its peak value and the capacitor voltage is
completely recharged.
Since the capacitor ﬁlters out a large portion of the sinusoidal signal, it is called a ﬁl-
ter capacitor. The steady-state output voltage of the RC ﬁlter is shown in Figure 2.8(e).
The ripple effect in the output from a full-wave ﬁltered rectiﬁer circuit can be seen
in the output waveform in Figure 2.9. The capacitor charges to its peak voltage value
when the input signal is at its peak value. As the input decreases, the diode becomes
reverse biased and the capacitor discharges through the output resistance R. Deter-
mining the ripple voltage is necessary for the design of a circuit with an acceptable
amount of ripple.
To a good approximation, the output voltage, that is, the voltage across the ca-
pacitor or the RC circuit, can be written as
vO(t) = VMe−t′/τ = VMe−t′/RC
(2.3)
where t′ is the time after the output has reached its peak value, and RC is the time
constant of the circuit.
The smallest output voltage is
VL = VMe−T ′/RC
(2.4)
where T ′ is the discharge time, as indicated in Figure 2.9.
The ripple voltage Vr is deﬁned as the difference between VM and VL, and is
determined by
Vr = VM −VL = VM(1 −e−T ′/RC)
(2.5)
Normally, we will want the discharge time T ′ to be small compared to the time
constant, or T ′ ≪RC . Expanding the exponential in a series and keeping only the
linear terms of that expansion, we have the approximation2
e−T ′/RC ∼= 1 −T ′
RC
(2.6)
2We can show that the difference between the exponential function and the linear approximation given by
Equation (2.6) is less than 0.5 percent for RC = 10T ′. We need a relatively large RC time constant for this
application.

Chapter 2 Diode Circuits
77
The ripple voltage can now be written as
Vr ∼= VM
 T ′
RC

(2.7)
Since the discharge time T ′ depends on the RC time constant, Equation (2.7) is
difﬁcult to solve. However, if the ripple effect is small, then as an approximation, we
can let T ′ = Tp, so that
Vr ∼= VM
 Tp
RC

(2.8)
where Tp is the time between peak values of the output voltage. For a full-wave
rectiﬁer, Tp is one-half the signal period. Therefore, we can relate Tp to the signal
frequency,
f =
1
2Tp
The ripple voltage is then
Vr =
VM
2 f RC
(2.9)
For a half-wave rectiﬁer, the time Tp corresponds to a full period (not a half pe-
riod) of the signal, so the factor 2 does not appear in Equation (2.9). The factor of 2
shows that the full-wave rectiﬁer has half the ripple voltage of the half-wave rectiﬁer.
Equation (2.9) can be used to determine the capacitor value required for a par-
ticular ripple voltage.
EXAMPLE 2.3
Objective: Determine the capacitance required to yield a particular ripple voltage.
Consider a full-wave rectiﬁer circuit with a 60 Hz input signal and a peak output
voltage of VM = 10 V. Assume the output load resistance is R = 10 k and the rip-
ple voltage is to be limited to Vr = 0.2 V.
Solution: From Equation (2.9), we can write
C =

2(60)(10 × 103)(0.2) ⇒41.7 μF
Comment: If the ripple voltage is to be limited to a smaller value, a larger ﬁlter ca-
pacitor must be used. Note that the size of the ripple voltage and the size of ﬁlter
capacitor are related to the load resistance R.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.3: Assume the input signal to a rectiﬁer circuit has a peak value of
VM = 12 V and is at a frequency of 60 Hz. Assume the output load resistance is
R = 2 k and the ripple voltage is to be limited to Vr = 0.4 V. Determine the
capacitance required to yield this speciﬁcation for a (a) full-wave rectiﬁer and 
(b) half-wave rectiﬁer. (Ans. (a) C = 125 μF, (b) C = 250 μF).

Figure 2.10 Output of a full-wave rectiﬁer with an RC ﬁlter: (a) diode conduction time and
(b) diode current
The diode in a ﬁltered rectiﬁer circuit conducts for a brief interval t near the
peak of the sinusoidal input signal. The diode current supplies the charge lost by the
capacitor during the discharge time. Figure 2.10 shows the rectiﬁed output of a full-
wave rectiﬁer and the ﬁltered output assuming ideal diodes (Vγ = 0) in the rectiﬁer
circuit. We will use this approximate model to estimate the diode current during the
diode conduction time. Figure 2.11 shows the equivalent circuit of the full-wave rec-
tiﬁer during the charging time. We see that

During the diode conduction time near t = 0 (Figure 2.10), we can write

the output voltage as

DESIGN EXAMPLE 2.4
Objective: Design a full-wave rectiﬁer to meet particular speciﬁcations.
A full-wave rectiﬁer is to be designed to produce a peak output voltage of 12 V,
deliver 120 mA to the load, and produce an output with a ripple of not more than
5 percent. An input line voltage of 120 V (rms), 60 Hz is available.
Solution: A full-wave bridge rectiﬁer will be used, because of the advantages previ-
ously discussed. The effective load resistance is
R = VO
IL
= 12
0.12 = 100 
Assuming a diode cut-in voltage of 0.7 V, the peak value of vS is
vS(max) = vO(max) + 2Vγ = 12 + 2(0.7) = 13.4 V
For a sinusoidal signal, this produces an rms voltage value of
vS,rms = 13.4
√

= 9.48 V
The transformer turns ratio is then

9.48 = 12.7
For a 5 percent ripple, the ripple voltage is

Finally, the peak inverse voltage that each diode must sustain is

Chapter 2 Diode Circuits
81
Comment: The minimum speciﬁcations for the diodes in this full-wave rectiﬁer cir-
cuit are: a peak current of 2.50 A, an average current of 132 mA, and a peak inverse
voltage of 12.7 V. In order to meet the desired ripple speciﬁcation, the required ﬁlter
capacitance must be large, since the effective load resistance is small.
Design Pointer: (1) A particular turns ratio was determined for the transformer.
However, this particular transformer design is probably not commercially available.
This means an expensive custom transformer design would be required, or if a stan-
dard transformer is used, then additional circuit design is required to meet the
output voltage speciﬁcation. (2) A constant 120 V (rms) input voltage is assumed to
be available. However, this voltage can ﬂuctuate, so the output voltage will also
ﬂuctuate.
We will see later how more sophisticated designs will solve these two problems.
Computer Veriﬁcation: Since we simply used an assumed cut-in voltage for the
diode and used approximations in the development of the ripple voltage equations,
we can use PSpice to give us a more accurate evaluation of the circuit. The PSpice
circuit schematic and the steady-state output voltage are shown in Figure 2.12. We
see that the peak output voltage is 11.6 V, which is close to the desired 12 V. One
reason for the slight discrepancy is that the diode voltage drop for the maximum
input voltage is slightly greater than 0.8 V rather than the assumed 0.7 V. The ripple
voltage is approximately 0.5 V, which is within the 0.6 V speciﬁcation.
Discussion: In the PSpice simulation, a standard diode, 1N4002, was used. In order
for the computer simulation to be valid, the diode used in the simulation and in the
actual circuit must match. In this example, to reduce the diode voltage and increase
the peak output voltage, a diode with a larger cross-sectional area should be used.

Ex 2.4: The input voltage to the half-wave rectiﬁer in Figure 2.8(a) is
vS = 75 sin[2π(60)t] V. Assume a diode cut-in voltage of Vγ = 0. The ripple

the minimum load resistance that can be connected to the output. (Ans. R =

Detectors
One of the ﬁrst applications of semiconductor diodes was as a detector for amplitude-
modulated (AM) radio signals. An amplitude-modulated signal consists of a radio-
frequency carrier wave whose amplitude varies with an audio frequency as shown in
Figure 2.13(a). The detector circuit is shown in Figure 2.13(b) and is a half-wave rec-

tiﬁer circuit with an RC ﬁlter on the output. For this application, the RC time constant
should be approximately equal to the period of the carrier signal, so that the output
voltage can follow each peak value of the carrier signal. If the time constant is too
large, the output will not be able to change fast enough and the output will not repre-
sent the audio output. The output of the detector is shown in Figure 2.13(c).
The output of the detector circuit is then coupled to an ampliﬁer through a
capacitor to remove the dc component of the signal, and the output of the ampliﬁer is

A voltage doubler circuit is very similar to the full-wave rectiﬁer, except that two
diodes are replaced by capacitors, and it can produce a voltage equal to approxi-
mately twice the peak output of a transformer (Figure 2.14).
Figure 2.15(a) shows the equivalent circuit when the voltage polarity at the “top”
of the transformer is negative; Figure 2.15(b) shows the equivalent circuit for the op-
posite polarity. In the circuit in Figure 2.15(a), the forward diode resistance of D2 is
small; therefore, the capacitor C1 will charge to almost the peak value of vS. Termi-
nal 2 on C1 is positive with respect to terminal 1. As the magnitude of vS decreases
from its peak value, C1 discharges through RL and C2. We assume that the time con-
stant RLC2 is very long compared to the period of the input signal.
As the polarity of vS changes to that shown in Figure 2.15(b), the voltage across C1
is essentially constant at VM, with terminal 2 remaining positive. As vS reaches its max-
imum value, the voltage across C2 essentially becomes VM. By Kirchhoff’s voltage law,

the peak voltage across RL is now essentially equal to 2VM, or twice the peak output of
the transformer. The same ripple effect occurs as in the output voltage of the rectiﬁer
circuits, but if C1 and C2 are relatively large, then the ripple voltage Vr, is quite small.
There are also voltage tripler and voltage quadrupler circuits. These circuits pro-
vide a means by which multiple dc voltages can be generated from a single ac source
and power transformer.

ZENER DIODE CIRCUITS
Objective: • Apply the characteristics of the Zener diode to a Zener
diode voltage regulator circuit.
In Chapter 1, we saw that the breakdown voltage of a Zener diode was nearly con-
stant over a wide range of reverse-bias currents (Figure 1.21). This makes the Zener
diode useful in a voltage regulator, or a constant-voltage reference circuit. In this
chapter, we will look at an ideal voltage reference circuit, and the effects of includ-
ing a nonideal Zener resistance.
The Zener diode voltage regulator circuits designed in this section will then be
added to the design of the electronic power supply in Figure 2.1. We should note that
in actual power supply designs, the voltage regulator will be a more sophisticated
integrated circuit rather than the simpler Zener diode design that will be developed

Chapter 2 Diode Circuits

here. One reason is that a standard Zener diode with a particular desired breakdown
voltage may not be available. However, this section will provide the basic concept of
a voltage regulator.
Ideal Voltage Reference Circuit
Figure 2.16 shows a Zener voltage regulator circuit. For this circuit, the output volt-
age should remain constant, even when the output load resistance varies over a fairly
wide range, and when the input voltage varies over a speciﬁc range. The variation in
VPS may be the ripple voltage from a rectiﬁer circuit.
We determine, initially, the proper input resistance Ri. The resistance Ri limits
the current through the Zener diode and drops the “excess” voltage between VPS and
VZ. We can write

which assumes that the Zener resistance is zero for the ideal diode. Solving this equa-
tion for the diode current, IZ, we get
IZ = VPS −VZ
Ri
−IL
(2.27)
where IL = VZ/RL, and the variables are the input voltage source VPS and the load
current IL.
For proper operation of this circuit, the diode must remain in the breakdown re-
gion and the power dissipation in the diode must not exceed its rated value. In other
words:
1.
The current in the diode is a minimum, IZ(min), when the load current is a
maximum, IL(max), and the source voltage is a minimum, VPS(min).
2.
The current in the diode is a maximum, IZ(max), when the load current is a
minimum, IL(min), and the source voltage is a maximum, VPS(max).
Inserting these two speciﬁcations into Equation (2.26), we obtain
Ri =
VPS(min) −VZ
IZ(min) + IL(max)
(2.28(a))
and
Ri =
VPS(max) −VZ
IZ(max) + IL(min)
(2.28(b))

86
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Equating these two expressions, we then obtain
[VPS(min) −VZ] · [IZ(max) + IL(min)]
= [VPS(max) −VZ] · [IZ(min) + IL(max)]
(2.29)
Reasonably, we can assume that we know the range of input voltage, the range
of output load current, and the Zener voltage. Equation (2.29) then contains two un-
knowns, IZ(min) and IZ(max). Further, as a minimum requirement, we can set the
minimum Zener current to be one-tenth the maximum Zener current, or IZ(min) =
0.1IZ(max). (More stringent design requirements may require the minimum Zener
current to be 20 to 30 percent of the maximum value.) We can then solve for
IZ(max), using Equation (2.29), as follows:
IZ(max) = IL(max) · [VPS(max) −VZ] −IL(min) · [VPS(min) −VZ]
VPS(min) −0.9VZ −0.1VPS(max)
(2.30)
Using the maximum current thus obtained from Equation (2.30), we can determine
the maximum required power rating of the Zener diode. Then, combining Equa-
tion (2.30) with either Equation (2.28(a)) or (2.28(b)), we can determine the required
value of the input resistance Ri.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 2.5
Objective: Design a voltage regulator using the circuit in Figure 2.16.
The voltage regulator is to power a car radio at VL = 9 V from an automobile
battery whose voltage may vary between 11 and 13.6 V. The current in the radio will
vary between 0 (off) to 100 mA (full volume).
The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 2.17.
Solution: The maximum Zener diode current can be determined from Equa-
tion (2.30) as
IZ(max) =
(100)[13.6 −9] −0
11 −(0.9)(9) −(0.1)(13.6)
∼= 300 mA
The maximum power dissipated in the Zener diode is then
PZ(max) = IZ(max) · VZ = (300)(9) ⇒2.7 W
The value of the current-limiting resistor Ri, from Equation (2.28(b)), is
Ri = 13.6 −9

We ﬁnd

Comment: From this design, we see that the minimum power ratings of the
Zener diode and input resistor are 2.7 W and 1.4 W, respectively. The minimum
Zener diode current occurs for VPS(min) and IL(max). We find IZ(min) = 30.7
mA, which is approximately 10 percent of IZ(max) as specified by the design
equations.
Design Pointer: (1) The variable input in this example was due to a variable battery
voltage. However, referring back to Example 2.4, the variable input could also be a
function of using a standard transformer with a given turns ratio as opposed to a cus-
tom design with a particular turns ratio and/or having a 120 V (rms) input voltage that
is not exactly constant.
(2) The 9 V output is a result of using a 9 V Zener diode. However, a Zener diode
with exactly a 9 V breakdown voltage may also not be available. We will again see
later how more sophisticated designs can solve this problem.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.5: The Zener diode regulator circuit shown in Figure 2.16 has an input volt-
age that varies between 10 and 14 V, and a load resistance that varies between
RL = 20 and 100 . Assume a 5.6 Zener diode is used, and assume IZ(min) =
0.1IZ(max). Find the value of Ri required and the minimum power rating of the
diode. (Ans. PZ = 3.31 W, Ri ∼= 13 )
The operation of the Zener diode circuit shown in Figure 2.17 can be visualized
by using load lines. Summing currents at the Zener diode, we have
vPS −VZ
Ri
= IZ + VZ

Solving for VZ, we obtain
VZ = vPS

which is the load line equation. Using the parameters of Example 2.5, the load resis-
tance varies from RL = ∞(IL = 0) to RL = 9/0.1 = 90 (IL = 100 mA). The
current limiting resistor is Ri = 15  and the input voltage varies over the range
11 ≤vPS ≤13.6 V.
We may write load line equations for the various circuit conditions.
A: vPS = 11 V,
RL = ∞; 
VZ = 11 −IZ(15)
B: vPS = 11 V,
RL = 90 ; VZ = 9.43 −IZ(12.9)
C: vPS = 13.6 V, RL = ∞; 
VZ = 13.6 −IZ(15)
D: vPS = 13.6 V, RL = 90 ; VZ = 11.7 −IZ(12.9)

Figure 2.18 shows the Zener diode I–V characteristics. Superimposed on the ﬁgure
are the four load lines designated as A, B, C, and D. Each load line intersects the
diode characteristics in the breakdown region, which is the required condition for
proper diode operation. The variation in Zener diode current IZ for the various
combinations of input voltage and load resistance is shown on the ﬁgure.
If we were to choose the input resistance to be Ri = 25  and let vPS = 11 V
and RL = 90 , the load line equation (Equation (2.32)) becomes
VZ = 8.61 −IZ(19.6)
(2.33)
This load line is plotted as curve E on Figure 2.18. We see that this load line does not
intersect the diode characteristics in the breakdown region. For this condition, the
output voltage will not equal the breakdown voltage of VZ = 9 V; the circuit does not
operate “properly.”
Zener Resistance and Percent Regulation
In the ideal Zener diode, the Zener resistance is zero. In actual Zener diodes, how-
ever, this is not the case. The result is that the output voltage will ﬂuctuate slightly
with a ﬂuctuation in the input voltage, and will ﬂuctuate with changes in the output
load resistance.
Figure 2.19 shows the equivalent circuit of the voltage regulator including the
Zener resistance. Because of the Zener resistance, the output voltage will change
with a change in the Zener diode current.
Two ﬁgures of merit can be deﬁned for a voltage regulator. The ﬁrst is the source
regulation and is a measure of the change in output voltage with a change in source

voltage. The second is the load regulation and is a measure of the change in output
voltage with a change in load current.
The source regulation is deﬁned as
Source regulation = vL
vPS
× 100%
(2.34)
where vL is the change in output voltage with a change of vPS in the input
voltage.
The load regulation is deﬁned as
Load regulation = vL,no load −vL,full load
vL,full load
× 100%
(2.35)
where vL,no load is the output voltage for zero load current and vL,full load is the output
voltage for the maximum rated output current.
The circuit approaches that of an ideal voltage regulator as the source and load
regulation factors approach zero.
EXAMPLE 2.6
Objective: Determine the source regulation and load regulation of a voltage regula-
tor circuit.
Consider the circuit described in Example 2.5 and assume a Zener resistance of
rz = 2 .
Solution: Consider the effect of a change in input voltage for a no-load condition
(RL = ∞). For vPS = 13.6 V, we ﬁnd
IZ = 13.6 −9
15.3 + 2 = 0.2659 A
Then
vL,max = 9 + (2)(0.2659) = 9.532 V
For vPS = 11 V, we ﬁnd
IZ = 11 −9
15.3 + 2 = 0.1156 A
Then
vL,min = 9 + (2)(0.1156) = 9.231 V
We obtain
Source regulation = vL
vPS
× 100% = 9.532 −9.231
13.6 −11
× 100% = 11.6%
Now consider the effect of a change in load current for vPS = 13.6 V. For IL = 0, we
ﬁnd
IZ = 13.6 −9
15.3 + 2 = 0.2659 A
and
vL,no load = 9 + (2)(0.2659) = 9.532 V

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
For a load current of IL = 100 mA, we ﬁnd
IZ = 13.6 −[9 + IZ(2)]
15.3
−0.10
which yields
IZ = 0.1775 A
Then
vL,full load = 9 + (2)(0.1775) = 9.355 V
We now obtain
Load regulation = vL,no load −vL,full load
vL,full load
× 100%
= 9.532 −9.355
9.355
× 100% = 1.89%
Comment: The ripple voltage on the input of 2.6 V is reduced by approximately a
factor of 10. The change in output load results in a small percentage change in the
output voltage.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.6: Repeat Example 2.6 for rz = 4 . Assume all other parameters are the same
as listed in the example. (Ans. Source regulation = 20.7%, load regulation = 3.29%)
Test Your Understanding
TYU 2.5 Consider the circuit shown in Figure 2.19. Let VPS = 12 V, VZ O = 6.2 V,
and rz = 3 . The power rating of the diode is P = 1 W. (a) Determine IZ(max) and
Ri. (b) If IZ(min) = 0.1IZ(max), determine RL(min) and the load regulation. (Ans.
(a) IZ(max) = 150 mA, Ri = 35.7 ; (b) RL(min) = 42.7 , 6.09 %).
TYU 2.6 Suppose the current-limiting resistor in Example 2.5 is replaced by one
whose value is Ri = 20 . Determine the minimum and maximum Zener diode cur-
rent. Does the circuit operate “properly”? (Ans. IZ(min) = 0, IZ(max) = 230 mA).
TYU 2.7 Suppose the power supply voltage in the circuit shown in Figure 2.17 drops
to VPS = 10 V. Let Ri = 15.3 . What is the maximum load current in the radio if
the minimum Zener diode current is to be maintained at IZ(min) = 30 mA? (Ans.
IL(max) = 35.4 mA).
2.3
CLIPPER AND CLAMPER CIRCUITS
Objective: • Apply the nonlinear characteristics of diodes to create
waveshaping circuits known as clippers and clampers.
In this section, we continue our discussion of nonlinear circuit applications of diodes.
Diodes can be used in waveshaping circuits that either limit or “clip” portions of a
signal, or shift the dc voltage level. The circuits are called clippers and clampers,
respectively.

Chapter 2 Diode Circuits
91
Clippers
Clipper circuits, also called limiter circuits, are used to eliminate portions of a sig-
nal that are above or below a speciﬁed level. For example, the half-wave rectiﬁer is a
clipper circuit, since all voltages below zero are eliminated. A simple application of
a clipper is to limit the voltage at the input to an electronic circuit so as to prevent
breakdown of the transistors in the circuit. The circuit may be used to measure the
frequency of the signal, if the amplitude is not an important part of the signal.
Figure 2.20 shows the general voltage transfer characteristics of a limiter circuit.
The limiter is a linear circuit if the input signal is in the range V −
O /Av ≤vI ≤
V +
O /Av, where Av is the slope of the transfer curve. If Av ≤1, as in diode circuits,
the circuit is a passive limiter. If vI > V +
O /Av, the output is limited to a maximum
value of V +
O . Similarly, if vI < V −
O /Av, the output is limited to a minimum value of
V −
O . Figure 2.20 shows the general transfer curve of a double limiter, in which both
the positive and negative peak values of the input signal are clipped.
Various combinations of V +
O and V −
O are possible. Both parameters may be pos-
itive, both negative, or one may be positive while the other negative, as indicated in
the ﬁgure. If either V −
O approaches minus inﬁnity or V +
O approaches plus inﬁnity,
then the circuit reverts to a single limiter.
Figure 2.21(a) is a single-diode clipper circuit. The diode D1 is off as long as
vI < VB + Vγ . With D1 off, the current is approximately zero, the voltage drop
across R is essentially zero, and the output voltage follows the input voltage. When
vI > VB + Vγ , the diode turns on, the output voltage is clipped, and vO equals
VB + Vγ . The output signal is shown in Figure 2.21(b). In this circuit, the output is
clipped above VB + Vγ .

The resistor R in Figure 2.21 is selected to be large enough so that the forward
diode current is limited to be within reasonable values (usually in the milliampere
range), but small enough so that the reverse diode current produces a negligible volt-
age drop. Normally, a wide range of resistor values will result in satisfactory perfor-
mance of a given circuit.
Other clipping circuits can be constructed by reversing the diode, the polarity of
the voltage source, or both.
Positive and negative clipping can be performed simultaneously by using a dou-
ble limiter or a parallel-based clipper, such as the circuit shown in Figure 2.22. The
input and output signals are also shown in the ﬁgure. The parallel-based clipper is
designed with two diodes and two voltage sources oriented in opposite directions.
EXAMPLE 2.7
Objective: Find the output of the parallel-based clipper in Figure 2.23(a).
For simplicity, assume that Vγ = 0 and rf = 0 for both diodes.
Solution: For t = 0, we see that vI = 0 and both D1 and D2 are reverse biased. For
0 < vI ≤2 V, D1 and D2 remain off; therefore, vO = vI . For vI > 2 V, D1 turns on

If vI = 6 V, then vO = 4 V.
For −4 < vI < 0 V, both D1 and D2 are off and vO = vI . For vI ≤−4 V, D2
turns on and the output is constant at vO = −4 V. The input and output waveforms
are plotted in Figure 2.23(b).
Comment: If we assume that Vγ ̸= 0, the output will be very similar to the re-
sults calculated here. The only difference will be the points at which the diodes
turn on.

tion shown in Figure 2.24. Assume diode cut-in voltages of Vγ = 0.7 V. (Ans. For

Diode clipper circuits can also be designed such that the dc power supply is in
series with the input signal. Figure 2.25 shows one example. The battery in series
with the input signal causes the input signal to be superimposed on the VB dc volt-
age. The resulting conditioned input signal and corresponding output signal is also
shown in Figure 2.25.
In all of the clipper circuits considered, we have included batteries that basically
set the limits of the output voltage. However, batteries need periodic replacement, so
that these circuits are not practical. Zener diodes, operated in the reverse breakdown
region, provide essentially a constant voltage drop. We can replace the batteries by
Zener diodes.

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Figure 2.26(a) shows a parallel based clipper circuit using Zener diodes. The
voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 2.26(b). The performance of the
circuit in Figure 2.26(a) is essentially the same as that shown in Figure 2.22.
Clampers
Clamping shifts the entire signal voltage by a dc level. In steady state, the output
waveform is an exact replica of the input waveform, but the output signal is shifted
by a dc value that depends on the circuit. The distinguishing feature of a clamper is
that it adjusts the dc level without needing to know the exact waveform.
An example of clamping is shown in Figure 2.27(a). The sinusoidal input volt-
age signal is shown in Figure 2.27(b). Assume that the capacitor is initially un-
charged. During the ﬁrst 90 degrees of the input waveform, the voltage across the
capacitor follows the input, and vC = vI (assuming that rf = 0 and Vγ = 0). After vI
and vC reach their peak values, vI begins to decrease and the diode becomes reverse
biased. Ideally, the capacitor cannot discharge, so the voltage across the capacitor re-
mains constant at vC = VM. By Kirchhoff’s voltage law
vO = −vC + vI = −VM + VM sin ωt

output voltage is “clamped” at zero volts, that is, vO ≤0. In steady state, the
waveshapes of the input and output signals are the same, and the output signal is
shifted by a certain dc level compared to the input signal.
A clamping circuit that includes an independent voltage source VB is shown in
Figure 2.28(a). In this circuit, the RLC time constant is assumed to be large, where RL
is the load resistance connected to the output. If we assume, for simplicity, that
rf = 0 and Vγ = 0, then the output is clamped at VB. Figure 2.28(b) shows an exam-
ple of a sinusoidal input signal and the resulting output voltage signal. When the
polarity of VB is as shown, the output is shifted in a negative voltage direction. Simi-
larly, Figure 2.28(c) shows a square-wave input signal and the resulting output volt-
age signal. For the square-wave signal, we have neglected the diode capacitance
effects and assume the voltage can change instantaneously.
Electronic signals tend to lose their dc levels during signal transmission. For
example, the dc level of a TV signal may be lost during transmission, so that the dc
level must be restored at the TV receiver. The following example illustrates this
effect.
EXAMPLE 2.8
Objective: Find the steady-state output of the diode-clamper circuit shown in Fig-
ure 2.29(a).
The input vI is assumed to be a sinusoidal signal whose dc level has been shifted
with respect to a receiver ground by a value VB during transmission. Assume Vγ = 0
and rf = 0 for the diode.

Solution: Figure 2.29(b) shows the sinusoidal input signal. If the capacitor is ini-
tially uncharged, then the output voltage is vO = VB at t = 0 (diode reverse-biased).
For 0 ≤t ≤t1, the effective RC time constant is inﬁnite, the voltage across the ca-
pacitor does not change, and vO = vI + VB.
At t = t1, the diode becomes forward biased; the output cannot go negative, so
the voltage across the capacitor changes (the rf C time constant is zero).
At t = ( 3
4)T , the input signal begins increasing and the diode becomes reverse
biased, so the voltage across the capacitor now remains constant at VC = VS −VB
with the polarity shown. The output voltage is now given by
vO = (VS −VB) + vI + VB = (VS −VB) + VS sin ωt + VB
or
vO = VS(1 + sin ωt)
Comment: For t > ( 3
4)T , steady state is reached. The output signal waveform is an
exact replica of the input signal waveform and is now measured with respect to the
reference ground at terminal A.

MULTIPLE-DIODE CIRCUITS
Objective: • Examine the techniques used to analyze circuits that
contain more than one diode.
Since a diode is a nonlinear device, part of the analysis of a diode circuit involves de-
termining whether the diode is on or off. If a circuit contains more than one diode, the
analysis is complicated by the various possible combinations of on and off.
In this section, we will look at several multiple-diode circuits. We will see, for
example, how diode circuits can be used to perform logic functions. This section
serves as an introduction to digital logic circuits that will be considered in detail in
Chapters 16 and 17.

Example Diode Circuits
As a brief introduction, consider two single-diode circuits. Figure 2.33(a) shows a
diode in series with a resistor. A plot of voltage transfer characteristics, vO versus vI,
shows the piecewise linear nature of this circuit (Figure 2.33(b)). The diode does not
begin to conduct until vI = Vγ . Consequently, for vI ≤Vγ , the output voltage is
zero; for vI > Vr, the output voltage is vO = vI −Vγ .
Figure 2.34(a) shows a similar diode circuit, but with the input voltage source
explicitly included to show that there is a path for the diode current. The voltage
transfer characteristic is shown in Figure 2.34(b). In this circuit, the diode remains
conducting for vI < VS −Vγ , and the output voltage is vO = vI + Vγ . When
vI > VS −Vγ , the diode turns off and the current through the resistor is zero; there-
fore, the output remains constant at VS.
These two examples demonstrate the piecewise linear nature of the diode
and the diode circuit. They also demonstrate that there are regions where the diode
is “on,” or conducting, and regions where the diode is “off,” or nonconducting.

In multidiode circuits, each diode may be either on or off. Consider the two-
diode circuit in Figure 2.35. Since each diode may be either on or off, the circuit has
four possible states. However, some of these states may not be feasible because of
diode directions and voltage polarities.
If we assume that V + > V −and that V + −V −> Vγ , there is at least a possi-
bility that D2 can be turned on. First, v′ cannot be less than V −. Then, for vI = V −,
diode D1 must be off. In this case, D2 is on, iR1 = iD2 = iR2, and
vO = V + −iR1R1
(2.37)
where
iR1 = V + −Vγ −V −
R1 + R2
(2.38)
Voltage v′ is one diode drop below vO, and D1 remains off as long as vI is less
than the output voltage. As vI increases and becomes equal to vO, both D1 and D2
turn on. This condition or state is valid as long as vI < V +. When vI = V +,
iR1 = iD2 = 0, at which point D2 turns off and vO cannot increase any further.
Figure 2.36 shows the resulting plot of vO versus vI. Three distinct regions, vO(1),
vO(2), and vO(3), correspond to the various conducting states of D1 and D2. The fourth
possible state, corresponding to both D1 and D2 being off, is not feasible in this circuit.
EXAMPLE 2.9
Objective: Determine the output voltage and diode currents for the circuit shown in
Figure 2.35, for two values of input voltage.
Assume the circuit parameters are R1 = 5 k, R2 = 10 k, Vγ = 0.7 V, V + =
+5 V, and V −= −5 V. Determine vO, iD1, and iD2 for vI = 0 and vI = 4 V.
Solution: For vI = 0, assume initially that D1 is off. The currents are then
iR1 = iD2 = iR2 = V + −Vγ −V −
R1 + R2
= 5 −0.7 −(−5)

= 0.62 mA
The output voltage is
vO = V + −iR1R1 = 5 −(0.62)(5) = 1.9 V
and v′ is

From these results, we see that diode D1 is indeed cut off, iD1 = 0, and our analysis
is valid.
For vI = 4 V, we see from Figure 2.36 that vO = vI ; therefore, vO = vI = 4 V.
In this region, both D1 and D2 are on, and
iR1 = iD2 = V + −vO
R1

Note that v′ = vO −Vγ = 4 −0.7 = 3.3 V. Thus,
iR2 = v′ −V −
R2
= 3.3 −(−5)
10
= 0.83 mA
The current through D1 is found from iD1 + iD2 = iR2 or
iD1 = iR2 −iD2 = 0.83 −0.2 = 0.63 mA
Comment: For vI = 0, we see that vO = 1.9 V and v′ = 1.2 V. This means that D1
is reverse biased, or off, as we initially assumed. For vI = 4 V, we have iD1 > 0 and
iD2 > 0, indicating that both D1 and D2 are forward biased, as we assumed.
Computer analysis: For multidiode circuits, a PSpice analysis may be useful in de-
termining the conditions under which the various diodes are conducting or not
conducting. This avoids guessing the conducting state of each diode in a hand analy-
sis. Figure 2.37 is the PSpice circuit schematic of the diode circuit in Figure 2.35.

Figure 2.37 also shows the output voltage and the two diode currents as the input is
varied between −1 V and +7 V. From these curves, we can determine when the
diodes turn on and off.
Comment: The hand analysis results, based on the piecewise linear model for the
diode, agree very well with the computer simulation results. This gives us conﬁdence
in the piecewise linear model when quick hand calculations are made.

Problem-Solving Technique: Multiple Diode Circuits
Analyzing multidiode circuits requires determining if the individual devices are
“on” or “off.” In many cases, the choice is not obvious, so we must initially guess
the state of each device, then analyze the circuit to determine if we have a solution
consistent with our initial guess. To do this, we can:
1.
Assume the state of a diode. If a diode is assumed on, the voltage across the
diode is assumed to be Vγ . If a diode is assumed to be off, the current through
the diode is assumed to be zero.
2.
Analyze the “linear” circuit with the assumed diode states.
3.
Evaluate the resulting state of each diode. If the initial assumption were that
a diode is “off” and the analysis shows that ID = 0 and VD ≤Vγ , then the as-
sumption is correct. If, however, the analysis actually shows that ID > 0
and/or VD > Vγ , then the initial assumption is incorrect. Similarly, if the
initial assumption were that a diode is “on” and the analysis shows that
ID ≥0 and VD = Vγ , then the initial assumption is correct. If, however, the
analysis shows that ID < 0 and/or VD < Vγ , then the initial assumption is
incorrect.
4.
If any initial assumption is proven incorrect, then a new assumption must be
made and the new “linear” circuit must be analyzed. Step 3 must then be
repeated.

Objective: Demonstrate how inconsistencies develop in a solution with incorrect
assumptions.
For the circuit shown in Figure 2.35, assume that parameters are the same as
those given in Example 2.9. Determine vO, iD1, iD2, and iR2 for vI = 0.
Solution: Assume initially that both D1 and D2 are conducting (i.e., on). Then,
v′ = −0.7 V and vO = 0. The two currents are
iR1 = iD2 = V + −vO
R1
= 5 −0
5
= 1.0 mA
and
iR2 = v′ −V −
R2
= −0.7 −(−5)
10
= 0.43 mA
Summing the currents at the v′ node, we ﬁnd that
iD1 = iR2 −iD2 = 0.43 −1.0 = −0.57 mA
Since this analysis shows the D1 current to be negative, which is an impossible or
inconsistent solution, our initial assumption must be incorrect. If we go back to
Example 2.9, we will see that the correct solution is D1 off and D2 on when vI = 0.
Comment: We can perform linear analyses on diode circuits, using the piecewise
linear model. However, we must ﬁrst determine if each diode in the circuit is operat-
ing in the “on” linear region or the “off” linear region.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.10: Consider the circuit shown in Figure 2.39. The cut-in voltage of each
diode is Vγ = 0.7 V. (a) Let vI = 5 V. Assume both diodes are conducting. Is this
a correct assumption? Why or why not? Determine IR1, ID1, ID2, and vO. (b) Re-
peat part (a) for vI = 10 V. (Ans. (a) D1 is off, ID1 = 0, IR1 = ID2 = 0.754 mA,
vO = 3.72 V; (b) ID1 = 0.9 mA, ID2 = 1.9 mA, IR1 = 1.0 mA, vO = 8.3 V)
EXAMPLE 2.11
Objective: Determine the current in each diode and the voltages VA and VB in the
multidiode circuit shown in Figure 2.40. Let Vγ = 0.7 V for each diode.

Chapter 2 Diode Circuits
103
Solution: Initially assume each diode is in its conducting state. Starting with D3 and
considering the voltages, we see that
VB = −0.7 V
and
VA = 0
Summing currents at the VA node, we ﬁnd
5 −VA
5
= ID2 + (VA −0.7) −(−10)
5
Since VA = 0, we obtain
5
5 = ID2 + 9.3
5 ⇒ID2 = −0.86 mA
which is inconsistent with the assumption that all diodes are “on” (an “on” diode
would have a positive diode current).
Now assume that D1 and D3 are on and D2 is off. We see that
ID1 = 5 −0.7 −(−10)
5 + 5
= 1.43 mA
and
ID3 = (0 −0.7) −(−5)
5
= 0.86 mA
We ﬁnd the voltages as
VB = −0.7 V
and
VA = 5 −(1.43)(5) = −2.15 V
From the values of VA and VB, the diode D2 is indeed reverse biased and off, so
ID2 = 0.
Comment: With more diodes in a circuit, the number of combinations of diodes
being either on or off increases, which may increase the number of times a circuit
must be analyzed before a correct solution is obtained. In the case of multiple diode
circuits, a computer simulation might save time.

Diode Logic Circuits
Diodes in conjunction with other circuit elements can perform certain logic func-
tions, such as AND and OR. The circuit in Figure 2.41 is an example of a diode logic
circuit. The four conditions of operation of this circuit depend on various combina-
tions of input voltages. If V1 = V2 = 0, there is no excitation to the circuit so both
diodes are off and VO = 0. If at least one input goes to 5 V, for example, at least one
diode turns on and VO = 4.3 V, assuming Vγ = 0.7 V.
2.4.2
These results are shown in Table 2.1. By deﬁnition, in a positive logic system, a
voltage near zero corresponds to a logic 0 and a voltage close to the supply voltage
of 5 V corresponds to a logic 1. The results shown in Table 2.1 indicate that this cir-
cuit performs the OR logic function. The circuit of Figure 2.41, then, is a two-input
diode OR logic circuit.
Next, consider the circuit in Figure 2.42. Assume a diode cut-in voltage of
Vγ = 0.7 V. Again, there are four possible states, depending on the combination of
input voltages. If at least one input is at zero volts, then at least one diode is con-
ducting and VO = 0.7 V. If both V1 = V2 = 5 V, there is no potential difference be-
tween the supply voltage and the input voltage. All currents are zero and VO = 5 V.
These results are shown in Table 2.2. This circuit performs the AND logic func-
tion. The circuit of Figure 2.42 is a two-input diode AND logic circuit.

If we examine Tables 2.1 and 2.2, we see that the input “low” and “high” volt-
ages may not be the same as the output “low” and “high” voltages. As an example,
for the AND circuit (Table 2.2), the input “low” is 0 V, but the output “low” is 0.7 V.
This can create a problem because the output of one logic gate is often the input to
another logic gate. Another problem occurs when diode logic circuits are connected
in cascade; that is, the output of one OR gate is connected to the input of a second OR
gate. The logic 1 levels of the two OR gates are not the same (see Problems 2.61 and
2.62). The logic 1 level degrades or decreases as additional logic gates are connected.
However, these problems may be overcome with the use of amplifying devices (tran-
sistors) in digital logic systems.

PHOTODIODE AND LED CIRCUITS
Objective: • Understand the operation and characteristics of special-
ized photodiode and light-emitting diode circuits.
A photodiode converts an optical signal into an electrical current, and a light-
emitting diode (LED) transforms an electrical current into an optical signal.
Photodiode Circuit
Figure 2.44 shows a typical photodiode circuit in which a reverse-bias voltage is
applied to the photodiode. If the photon intensity is zero, the only current through
the diode is the reverse-saturation current, which is normally very small. Photons
striking the diode create excess electrons and holes in the space-charge region.
The electric ﬁeld quickly separates these excess carriers and sweeps them out of the
space-charge region, thus creating a photocurrent in the reverse-bias direction.
The photocurrent is
Iph = ηe	A
(2.39)
where η is the quantum efﬁciency, e is the electronic charge, 	 is the photon ﬂux
density (#/cm2−s), and A is the junction area. This linear relationship between pho-
tocurrent and photon ﬂux is based on the assumption that the reverse-bias voltage
across the diode is constant. This in turn means that the voltage drop across R in-
duced by the photocurrent must be small, or that the resistance R is small.
EXAMPLE 2.12
Objective: Calculate the photocurrent generated in a photodiode.
For the photodiode shown in Figure 2.44 assume the quantum efﬁciency is 1, the
junction area is 10−2 cm2, and the incident photon ﬂux is 5 × 1017cm−2 −s−1.
Solution: From Equation (2.39), the photocurrent is
Iph = ηe	A = (1)(1.6 × 10−19)(5 × 1017)(10−2) ⇒0.8 mA
Comment: The incident photon ﬂux is normally given in terms of light intensity, in
lumens, foot-candles, or W/cm2. The light intensity includes the energy of the pho-
tons, as well as the photon ﬂux.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.12: (a) Photons with an energy of hν = 2 eV are incident on the photodiode
shown in Figure 2.44. The junction area is A = 0.5 cm2, the quantum efﬁciency is

LED Circuit
A light-emitting diode (LED) is the inverse of a photodiode; that is, a current is con-
verted into an optical signal. If the diode is forward biased, electrons and holes are
injected across the space-charge region, where they become excess minority carriers.
These excess minority carriers diffuse into the neutral n- and p-regions, where they
recombine with majority carriers, and the recombination can result in the emission of
a photon.
LEDs are fabricated from compound semiconductor materials, such as gal-
lium arsenide or gallium arsenide phosphide. These materials are direct-bandgap
semiconductors. Because these materials have higher bandgap energies than silicon,
the forward-bias junction voltage is larger than that in silicon-based diodes.
It is common practice to use a seven-segment LED for the numeric readout of
digital instruments, such as a digital voltmeter. The seven-segment display is
sketched in Figure 2.45. Each segment is an LED normally controlled by IC logic
gates.
Figure 2.46 shows one possible circuit connection, known as a common-anode
display. In this circuit, the anodes of all LEDs are connected to a 5 V source and
the inputs are controlled by logic gates. If VI1 is “high,” for example, D1 is off
and there is no light output. When VI1 goes “low,” D1 becomes forward biased and
produces a light output.

EXAMPLE 2.13
Objective: Determine the value of R required to limit the current in the circuit in
Figure 2.46 when the input is in the low state.
Assume that a diode current of 10 mA produces the desired light output, and that
the corresponding forward-bias voltage drop is 1.7 V.
Solution: If VI = 0.2 V in the “low” state, then the diode current is
I = 5 −Vγ −VI

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 2.13: Determine the value of resistance R required to limit the current in the
circuit shown in Figure 2.46 to I = 15 mA. Assume Vγ = 1.7 V, rf = 15 , and
VI = 0.2 V in the “low” state. (Ans. R = 192 )
One application of LEDs and photodiodes is in optoisolators, in which the input
signal is electrically decoupled from the output (Figure 2.47). An input signal applied
to the LED generates light, which is subsequently detected by the photodiode. The
photodiode then converts the light back to an electrical signal. There is no electrical
feedback or interaction between the output and input portions of the circuit.

DESIGN APPLICATION: DC POWER SUPPLY
Objective: • Design a dc power supply to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The output load current is to vary between 25 and 50 mA while the
output voltage is to remain in the range 12 ≤vO ≤12.2 V.
Design Approach: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 2.48.
A diode bridge circuit with an RC ﬁlter will be used and a Zener diode will be in par-
allel with the output load.
Choices: An ac input voltage with an rms value in the range 110 ≤vI ≤120 V and
at 60 Hz is available. A Zener diode with a Zener voltage of VZ O = 12 V and a Zener
resistance of 2  that can operate over a current range of 10 ≤IZ ≤100 mA is avail-
able. Also, a transformer with an 8:1 turns ratio is available.
Solution: With an 8:1 transformer turns ratio, the peak value of vS is in the range
19.4 ≤vS ≤21.2 V. Assuming diode turn-on voltages of Vγ = 0.7 V, the peak value
of vO1 is in the range 18.0 ≤vO1 ≤19.8 V.

Chapter 2 Diode Circuits

For vO1(max) and minimum load current, let IZ = 90 mA. Then
vO = VZ O + IZrz = 12 + (0.090)(2) = 12.18 V
The input current is
Ii = IZ + IL = 90 + 25 = 115 mA
The input resistance Ri must then be
Ri = vO1 −vO
Ii
= 19.8 −12.18
0.115
= 66.3 
The minimum Zener current occurs for IL(max) and vO1(min). The voltage
vO1(min) occurs for vS(min) and must also take into account the ripple voltage. Let
IZ(min) = 20 mA. Then the output voltage is
vO = VZ O + IZrZ = 12 + (0.020)(2) = 12.04 V
The output voltage is within the speciﬁed range of output voltage.
We now ﬁnd
Ii = IZ + IL = 20 + 50 = 70 mA
and
vO1(min) = Ii Ri + vO = (0.070)(66.3) + 12.04
or
vO1(min) = 16.68 V
The minimum ripple voltage of the ﬁlter is then
Vr = vS(min) −1.4 −vO1(min) = 19.4 −1.4 −16.68
or
Vr = 1.32 V
Now, let R1 = 500 . The effective resistance to ground from vO1 is R1∥Ri,eff
where Ri,eff is the effective resistance to ground through Ri and the other circuit ele-
ments. We can approximate
Ri,eff ≈vS(avg) −1.4

SUMMARY
•
Diode circuits, taking advantage of the nonlinear i–v characteristics of the pn
junction, were analyzed and designed in this chapter.
•
Half-wave and full-wave rectiﬁer circuits convert a sinusoidal (i.e., ac) signal to
an approximate dc signal. A dc power supply, which is used to bias electronic
circuits and systems, utilizes these types of circuits. An RC ﬁlter can be con-
nected to the output of the rectiﬁer circuit to reduce the ripple effect.
•
Zener diodes operate in the reverse-breakdown region and are used in voltage
reference or regulator circuits. The percent regulation, a ﬁgure of merit for reg-
ulator circuits, was deﬁned and determined for various regulator circuits.
•
Techniques used to analyze multidiode circuits were developed. The technique
requires making assumptions as to whether a diode is conducting (on) or not
conducting (off). After analyzing the circuit using these assumptions, we must
go back and verify that the assumptions made were valid.
•
Diode circuits can be designed to perform basic digital logic functions, such as
the AND and OR function. However, there are some inconsistencies between
input and output logic values as well as some loading effects, which will
severely limit the use of diode logic gates as stand-alone circuits.
•
The LED converts electrical current to light and is used extensively in such
applications as the seven-segment alphanumeric display. Conversely, the
photodiode detects an incident light signal and transforms it into an electrical
current.
•
As an application, a simple dc power supply was designed using a rectiﬁer
circuit in conjunction with a Zener diode.
CHECKPOINT
After studying this chapter, the reader should have the ability to:
✓In general, apply the diode piecewise linear model in the analysis of diode
circuits.
✓Analyze diode rectiﬁer circuits, including the calculation of ripple voltage.
✓Analyze Zener diode circuits, including the effect of a Zener resistance.
✓Determine the output signal for a given input signal of diode clipper and clam-
per circuits.
✓Analyze circuits with multiple diodes by making initial assumptions and then
verifying these initial assumptions.

Chapter
The Field-Effect 
Transistor
33
In this chapter, we introduce a major type of transistor, the metal-oxide-semiconductor
ﬁeld-effect transistor (MOSFET). The MOSFET led to the electronics revolution of
the 1970s and 1980s, in which the microprocessor made possible powerful desktop
computers, laptop computers, sophisticated handheld calculators, iPods, and a
plethora of other electronic systems. The MOSFET can be made very small, so high-
density very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits and high-density memories are
possible.
Two complementary devices, the n-channel MOSFET (NMOS) and the p-channel
MOSFET (PMOS), exist. Each device is equally important and allows a high degree
of ﬂexibility in electronic circuit design. The i–v characteristics of these devices
are introduced, and the dc analysis and design techniques of MOSFET circuits are
developed.
Another type of ﬁeld-effect transistor is the junction FET. There are two general
categories of junction ﬁeld-effect transistors (JFETs)—the pn junction FET (pn
JFET) and the metal-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MESFET), which is fab-
ricated with a Schottky barrier junction. JFETs were developed before MOSFETs,
but the applications and uses of MOSFETs have far surpassed those of the JFET.
However, we will consider a few JFET circuits in this chapter.
PREVIEW
In this chapter, we will:
•
Study and understand the structure, operation, and characteristics of the vari-
ous types of MOSFETs.
•
Understand and become familiar with the dc analysis and design techniques
of MOSFET circuits.
•
Examine three applications of MOSFET circuits.
•
Investigate current source biasing of MOSFET circuits, such as those used in
integrated circuits.
•
Analyze the dc biasing of multistage or multitransistor circuits.
•
Understand the operation and characteristics of the junction ﬁeld-effect tran-
sistor, and analyze the dc response of JFET circuits.
•
As an application, incorporate a MOS transistor in a circuit design that en-
hances the simple diode electronic thermometer discussed in Chapter 1.

3.1
MOS FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR
Objective: • Understand the operation and characteristics of the
various types of metal-oxide semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistors
(MOSFETs).
The metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MOSFET) became a
practical reality in the 1970s. The MOSFET, compared to BJTs, can be made very
small (that is, it occupies a very small area on an IC chip). Since digital circuits can
be designed using only MOSFETs, with essentially no resistors or diodes required,
high-density VLSI circuits, including microprocessors and memories, can be fabri-
cated. The MOSFET has made possible the handheld calculator, the powerful
personal computer, and the laptop computer. MOSFETs can also be used in analog
circuits, as we will see in the next chapter.
In the MOSFET, the current is controlled by an electric ﬁeld applied perpendic-
ular to both the semiconductor surface and to the direction of current. The phenome-
non used to modulate the conductance of a semiconductor, or control the current in a
semiconductor, by applying an electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the surface is called the
ﬁeld effect. The basic transistor principle is that the voltage between two terminals
controls the current through the third terminal.
In the following two sections, we will discuss the various types of MOSFETs,
develop the i–v characteristics, and then consider the dc biasing of various MOSFET
circuit conﬁgurations. After studying these sections, you should be familiar and com-
fortable with the MOSFET and MOSFET circuits.
Two-Terminal MOS Structure
The heart of the MOSFET is the metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor shown in
Figure 3.l. The metal may be aluminum or some other type of metal. In most cases,
the metal is replaced by a high-conductivity polycrystalline silicon layer deposited
on the oxide. However, the term metal is usually still used in referring to MOSFETs.
In the ﬁgure, the parameter tox is the thickness of the oxide and ϵox is the oxide
permittivity.
The physics of the MOS structure can be explained with the aid of a simple
parallel-plate capacitor.1 Figure 3.2(a) shows a parallel-plate capacitor with the top
plate at a negative voltage with respect to the bottom plate. An insulator material
separates the two plates. With this bias, a negative charge exists on the top plate, a
positive charge exists on the bottom plate, and an electric ﬁeld is induced between the
two plates, as shown.
A MOS capacitor with a p-type semiconductor substrate is shown in Figure 3.2(b).
The top metal terminal, also called the gate, is at a negative voltage with respect to the
semiconductor substrate. From the example of the parallel-plate capacitor, we can
see that a negative charge will exist on the top metal plate and an electric ﬁeld will
be induced in the direction shown in the ﬁgure. If the electric ﬁeld penetrates the

(b) a corresponding MOS capacitor with a negative gate bias, showing the electric ﬁeld and
charge ﬂow, and (c) the MOS capacitor with an accumulation layer of holes
semiconductor, the holes in the p-type semiconductor will experience a force toward
the oxide-semiconductor interface. The equilibrium distribution of charge in the
MOS capacitor with this particular applied voltage is shown in Figure 3.2(c).An accu-
mulation layer of positively charged holes at the oxide-semiconductor interface
corresponds to the positive charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor.
Figure 3.3(a) shows the same MOS capacitor, but with the polarity of the applied
voltage reversed. A positive charge now exists on the top metal plate and the in-
duced electric ﬁeld is in the opposite direction, as shown. In this case, if the electric
ﬁeld penetrates the semiconductor, holes in the p-type material will experience a force
away from the oxide-semiconductor interface. As the holes are pushed away from the
interface, a negative space-charge region is created, because of the ﬁxed acceptor
impurity atoms. The negative charge in the induced depletion region corresponds to
the negative charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor. Figure 3.3(b) shows
the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this applied voltage.

Figure 3.4 The MOS capacitor with n-type substrate: (a) effect of a positive gate bias and
the formation of an electron accumulation layer, (b) the MOS capacitor with an induced
space-charge region due to a moderate negative gate bias, and (c) the MOS capacitor with an
induced space-charge region and hole inversion layer due to a larger negative gate bias
When a larger positive voltage is applied to the gate, the magnitude of the
induced electric ﬁeld increases. Minority carrier electrons are attracted to the oxide-
semiconductor interface, as shown in Figure 3.3(c). This region of minority carrier
electrons is called an electron inversion layer. The magnitude of the charge in the
inversion layer is a function of the applied gate voltage.
The same basic charge distributions can be obtained in a MOS capacitor with
an n-type semiconductor substrate. Figure 3.4(a) shows this MOS capacitor struc-
ture, with a positive voltage applied to the top gate terminal. A positive charge is
created on the top gate and an electric field is induced in the direction shown. In
this situation, an accumulation layer of electrons is induced in the n-type semi-
conductor.
Figure 3.4(b) shows the case when a negative voltage is applied to the gate ter-
minal. A positive space-charge region is induced in the n-type substrate by the
induced electric ﬁeld. When a larger negative voltage is applied, a region of positive
charge is created at the oxide-semiconductor interface, as shown in Figure 3.4(c).
This region of minority carrier holes is called a hole inversion layer. The magnitude
of the positive charge in the inversion layer is a function of the applied gate voltage.
The term enhancement mode means that a voltage must be applied to the gate
to create an inversion layer. For the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate, a positive
gate voltage must be applied to create the electron inversion layer; for the MOS
capacitor with an n-type substrate, a negative gate voltage must be applied to create
the hole inversion layer.
n-Channel Enhancement-Mode MOSFET
We will now apply the concepts of an inversion layer charge in a MOS capacitor to
create a transistor.
Transistor Structure
Figure 3.5(a) shows a simpliﬁed cross section of a MOS ﬁeld-effect transistor. The
gate, oxide, and p-type substrate regions are the same as those of a MOS capacitor.
In addition, we now have two n-regions, called the source terminal and drain
terminal. The current in a MOSFET is the result of the ﬂow of charge in the inver-
sion layer, also called the channel region, adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor
interface.

n-channel MOSFET, showing the ﬁeld oxide and polysilicon gate
The channel length L and channel width W are deﬁned on the ﬁgure. The chan-
nel length of a typical integrated circuit MOSFET is less than 1 μm (10−6 m), which
means that MOSFETs are small devices. The oxide thickness tox is typically on the
order of 400 angstroms, or less.
The diagram in Figure 3.5(a) is a simpliﬁed sketch of the basic structure of the
transistor. Figure 3.5(b) shows a more detailed cross section of a MOSFET fabricated
into an integrated circuit conﬁguration. A thick oxide, called the ﬁeld oxide, is
deposited outside the area in which the metal interconnect lines are formed. The gate
material is usually heavily doped polysilicon. Even though the actual structure of a
MOSFET may be fairly complex, the simpliﬁed diagram may be used to develop the
basic transistor characteristics.
Basic Transistor Operation
With zero bias applied to the gate, the source and drain terminals are separated by the
p-region, as shown in Figure 3.6(a). This is equivalent to two back-to-back diodes, as
shown in Figure 3.6(b). The current in this case is essentially zero. If a large enough
positive gate voltage is applied, an electron inversion layer is created at the
oxide–semiconductor interface and this layer “connects” the n-source to the n-drain,

2The usual notation for threshold voltage is VT . However, since we have deﬁned the thermal voltage as
VT = kT/q, we will use VT N for the threshold voltage of the n-channel device.
3The voltage notation vDS and vGS, with the dual subscript, denotes the voltage between the drain (D) and
source (S) and between the gate (G) and source (S), respectively. Implicit in the notation is that the ﬁrst
subscript is positive with respect to the second subscript.
as shown in Figure 3.6(c). A current can then be generated between the source and
drain terminals. Since a voltage must be applied to the gate to create the inversion
charge, this transistor is called an enhancement-mode MOSFET. Also, since the
carriers in the inversion layer are electrons, this device is also called an n-channel
MOSFET (NMOS).
The source terminal supplies carriers that ﬂow through the channel, and the
drain terminal allows the carriers to drain from the channel. For the n-channel
MOSFET, electrons ﬂow from the source to the drain with an applied drain-to-source
voltage, which means the conventional current enters the drain and leaves the source.
The magnitude of the current is a function of the amount of charge in the inversion
layer, which in turn is a function of the applied gate voltage. Since the gate terminal
is separated from the channel by an oxide or insulator, there is no gate current.
Similarly, since the channel and substrate are separated by a space-charge region,
there is essentially no current through the substrate.
Ideal MOSFET Current–Voltage 
Characteristics—NMOS Device
The threshold voltage of the n-channel MOSFET, denoted as VT N, is deﬁned2 as the
applied gate voltage needed to create an inversion charge in which the density is
equal to the concentration of majority carriers in the semiconductor substrate. In
simple terms, we can think of the threshold voltage as the gate voltage required to
“turn on” the transistor.
For the n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET, the threshold voltage is posi-
tive because a positive gate voltage is required to create the inversion charge. If the
gate voltage is less than the threshold voltage, the current in the device is essentially
zero. If the gate voltage is greater than the threshold voltage, a drain-to-source
current is generated as the drain-to-source voltage is applied. The gate and drain
voltages are measured with respect to the source.
Figure 3.7(a) shows an n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET with the source
and substrate terminals connected to ground. The gate-to-source voltage is less than
the threshold voltage, and there is a small drain-to-source voltage. With this bias
conﬁguration, there is no electron inversion layer, the drain-to-substrate pn junction
is reverse biased, and the drain current is zero (neglecting pn junction leakage
currents).
Figure 3.7(b) shows the same MOSFET with an applied gate voltage greater
than the threshold voltage. In this situation, an electron inversion layer is created and,
when a small drain voltage is applied, electrons in the inversion layer ﬂow from the
source to the positive drain terminal. The conventional current enters the drain
terminal and leaves the source terminal. Note that a positive drain voltage creates a
reverse-biased drain-to-substrate pn junction, so current ﬂows through the channel
region and not through a pn junction.
The iD versus vDS characteristics3 for small values of vDS are shown in Fig-
ure 3.8. When vGS < VT N , the drain current is zero. When vGS is greater than VT N,

the channel inversion charge is formed and the drain current increases with vDS.
Then, with a larger gate voltage, a larger inversion charge density is created, and the
drain current is greater for a given value of vDS.
Figure 3.9(a) shows the basic MOS structure for vGS > VT N and a small applied
vDS. In the ﬁgure, the thickness of the inversion channel layer qualitatively indicates
the relative charge density, which for this case is essentially constant along the entire
channel length. The corresponding iD versus vDS curve is also shown in the ﬁgure.
Figure 3.9(b) shows the situation when vDS increases. As the drain voltage
increases, the voltage drop across the oxide near the drain terminal decreases, which
means that the induced inversion charge density near the drain also decreases. The in-
cremental conductance of the channel at the drain then decreases, which causes the
slope of the iD versus vDS curve to decrease. This effect is shown in the iD versus vDS
curve in the ﬁgure.
As vDS increases to the point where the potential difference, vGS −vDS, across
the oxide at the drain terminal is equal to VT N, the induced inversion charge density
at the drain terminal is zero. This effect is shown schematically in Figure 3.9(c). For
this condition, the incremental channel conductance at the drain is zero, which means
that the slope of the iD versus vDS curve is zero. We can write
vGS −vDS(sat) = VT N
(3.1(a))
or
vDS(sat) = vGS −VT N
(3.1(b))
where vDS(sat) is the drain-to-source voltage that produces zero inversion charge
density at the drain terminal.
When vDS becomes larger than vDS(sat), the point in the channel at which the
inversion charge is just zero moves toward the source terminal. In this case, electrons
enter the channel at the source, travel through the channel toward the drain, and then,
at the point where the charge goes to zero, are injected into the space-charge region,
where they are swept by the E-ﬁeld to the drain contact. In the ideal MOSFET, the
drain current is constant for vDS > vDS(sat). This region of the iD versus vDS char-
acteristic is referred to as the saturation region, which is shown in Figure 3.9(d).
As the applied gate-to-source voltage changes, the iD versus vDS curve changes.
In Figure 3.8, we saw that the initial slope of iD versus vDS increases as vGS increases.
Also, Equation (3.1(b)) shows that vDS(sat) is a function of vGS. Therefore, we can

generate the family of curves for this n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET as
shown in Figure 3.10.
Although the derivation of the current–voltage characteristics of the MOSFET
is beyond the scope of this text, we can deﬁne the relationships. The region for
which vDS < vDS(sat) is known as the nonsaturation or triode region. The ideal
current–voltage characteristics in this region are described by the equation

Note that the vDS(sat) voltage is a single point on each of the curves. This point denotes the
transition between the nonsaturation region and the saturation region
In the saturation region, the ideal current–voltage characteristics for vGS > VT N are
described by the equation
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2
(3.2(b))
In the saturation region, since the ideal drain current is independent of the drain-to-
source voltage, the incremental or small-signal resistance is inﬁnite. We see that
r0 = vDS/iD|vGS=const. = ∞
The parameter Kn is sometimes called the transconduction parameter for the
n-channel device. However, this term is not to be confused with the small-signal
transconductance parameter introduced in the next chapter. For simplicity, we will
refer to this parameter as the conduction parameter, which for an n-channel device
is given by
Kn = WμnCox
2L
(3.3(a))
where Cox is the oxide capacitance per unit area. The capacitance is given by
Cox = ϵox/tox
where tox is the oxide thickness and ϵox is the oxide permittivity. For silicon devices,
ϵox = (3.9)(8.85 × 10−14) F/cm. The parameter μn is the mobility of the electrons
in the inversion layer. The channel width W and channel length L were shown in
Figure 3.5(a).
As Equation (3.3(a)) indicates, the conduction parameter is a function of both
electrical and geometric parameters. The oxide capacitance and carrier mobility are
essentially constants for a given fabrication technology. However, the geometry, or
width-to-length ratio W/L, is a variable in the design of MOSFETs that is used to
produce speciﬁc current–voltage characteristics in MOSFET circuits.
We can rewrite the conduction parameter in the form
Kn = k′
n
2 · W
L
(3.3(b))

134
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
where k′
n = μnCox and is called the process conduction parameter. Normally, k′
n
is considered to be a constant for a given fabrication technology, so Equation
(3.3(b)) indicates that the width-to-length ratio W/L is the transistor design
variable.
EXAMPLE 3.1
Objective: Calculate the current in an n-channel MOSFET.
Consider an n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET with the following para-
meters: VT N = 0.4 V, W = 20 μm, L = 0.8 μm, μn = 650 cm2/V–s, tox = 200 Å,
and ϵox = (3.9)(8.85 × 10−14) F/cm. Determine the current when the transistor is bi-
ased in the saturation region for (a) vGS = 0.8 V and (b) vGS = 1.6 V.
Solution: The conduction parameter is determined by Equation (3.3(a)). First,
consider the units involved in this equation, as follows:
Kn =

cm2


ϵox
 F
cm

2L(cm) · tox(cm)
=

V–s = (C/V)
V–s = A
V2
The value of the conduction parameter is therefore
Kn = Wμnϵox
2Ltox
= (20 × 10−4)(650)(3.9)(8.85 × 10−14)
2(0.8 × 10−4)(200 × 10−8)
or
Kn = 1.40 mA/V2
From Equation (3.2(b)), we ﬁnd:
(a) For vGS = 0.8 V,
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2 = (1.40)(0.8 −0.4)2 = 0.224 mA
(b) For vGS = 1.6 V,
iD = (1.40)(1.6 −0.4)2 = 2.02 mA
Comment: The current capability of a transistor can be increased by increasing the
conduction parameter. For a given fabrication technology, Kn is adjusted by varying
the transistor width W.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.1: An NMOS transistor with VT N = 1 V has a drain current iD = 0.8 mA
when vGS = 3V and vDS = 4.5V. Calculate the drain current when: (a) vGS = 2V,
vDS = 4.5 V; and (b) vGS = 3 V, vDS = 1 V. (Ans. (a) 0.2 mA (b) 0.6 mA)

4Using a different threshold voltage parameter for a PMOS device compared to the NMOS device is for
clarity only.
Transistor Structure
Figure 3.11 shows a simpliﬁed cross section of the p-channel enhancement-
mode transistor. The substrate is now n-type and the source and drain areas are
p-type. The channel length, channel width, and oxide thickness parameter deﬁnitions
are the same as those for the NMOS device shown in Figure 3.5(a).
Basic Transistor Operation
The operation of the p-channel device is the same as that of the n-channel device,
except the hole is the charge carrier rather than the electron. A negative gate bias is
required to induce an inversion layer of holes in the channel region directly under the
oxide. The threshold voltage for the p-channel device is denoted as VT P.4 Since the
threshold voltage is deﬁned as the gate voltage required to induce the inversion layer,
then VT P < 0 for the p-channel enhancement-mode device.
Once the inversion layer has been created, the p-type source region is the source
of the charge carrier so that holes ﬂow from the source to the drain. A negative drain
voltage is therefore required to induce an electric ﬁeld in the channel forcing the
holes to move from the source to the drain. The conventional current direction, then,
for the PMOS transistor is into the source and out of the drain. The conventional
current direction and voltage polarity for the PMOS device are reversed compared to
the NMOS device.
Note in Figure 3.11 the reversal of the voltage subscripts. For vSG > 0, the gate
voltage is negative with respect to that at the source. Similarly, for vSD > 0, the
drain voltage is negative with respect to that at the source.
Ideal MOSFET Current–Voltage
Characteristics—PMOS Device
The ideal current–voltage characteristics of the p-channel enhancement-mode device
are essentially the same as those shown in Figure 3.10, noting that the drain current

is out of the drain and vDS is replaced by vSD. The saturation point is given by
vSD(sat) = vSG + VT P. For the p-channel device biased in the nonsaturation region,
the current is given by
iD = Kp

2(vSG + VT P)vSD −v2
SD

(3.4(a))
In the saturation region, the current is given by
iD = Kp(vSG + VT P)2
(3.4(b))
and the drain current exits the drain terminal. The parameter Kp is the conduction
parameter for the p-channel device and is given by
Kp = WμpCox
2L
(3.5(a))
where W, L, and Cox are the channel width, length, and oxide capacitance per unit
area, as previously deﬁned. The parameter μp is the mobility of holes in the hole
inversion layer. In general, the hole inversion layer mobility is less than the electron
inversion layer mobility.
We can also rewrite Equation (3.5(a)) in the form
Kp =
k′
p
2 · W
L
(3.5(b))
where k′
p = μpCox.
For a p-channel MOSFET biased in the saturation region, we have

(3.6)
EXAMPLE 3.2
Objective: Determine the source-to-drain voltage required to bias a p-channel
enhancement-mode MOSFET in the saturation region.
Consideranenhancement-modep-channelMOSFETforwhich Kp = 0.2mA/V2,
VT P = −0.50 V, and iD = 0.50 mA.
Solution: In the saturation region, the drain current is given by
iD = Kp(vSG + VT P)2
or
0.50 = 0.2(vSG −0.50)2
which yields
vSG = 2.08 V
To bias this p-channel MOSFET in the saturation region, the following must apply:
vSD > vSD(sat) = vSG + VT P = 2.08 −0.5 = 1.58 V
Comment: Biasing a transistor in either the saturation or the nonsaturation region
depends on both the gate-to-source voltage and the drain-to-source voltage.

vSD = 3 V; and (b) vSG = 5 V, vSD = 2 V. (Ans. (a) 0.0986 mA, (b) 1.72 mA)
Circuit Symbols and Conventions
The conventional circuit symbol for the n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET is
shown in Figure 3.12(a). The vertical solid line denotes the gate electrode, the verti-
cal broken line denotes the channel (the broken line indicates the device is enhance-
ment mode), and the separation between the gate line and channel line denotes the
oxide that insulates the gate from the channel. The polarity of the pn junction
between the substrate and the channel is indicated by the arrowhead on the body or
substrate terminal. The direction of the arrowhead indicates the type of transistor,
which in this case is an n-channel device. This symbol shows the four-terminal struc-
ture of the MOSFET device.
In most applications in this text, we will implicitly assume that the source and
substrate terminals are connected together. Explicitly drawing the substrate terminal
for each transistor in a circuit becomes redundant and makes the circuits appear more
complex. Instead, we will use the circuit symbol for the n-channel MOSFET shown
in Figure 3.12(b). In this symbol, the arrowhead is on the source terminal and it
indicates the direction of current, which for the n-channel device is out of the source.
By including the arrowhead in the symbol, we do not need to explicitly indicate the
source and drain terminals. We will use this circuit symbol throughout the text except
in speciﬁc applications.
In more advanced texts and journal articles, the circuit symbol of the n-channel
MOSFET shown in Figure 3.12(c) is generally used. The gate terminal is obvious
and it is implicitly understood that the “top” terminal is the drain and the “bottom”
terminal is the source. The top terminal, in this case the drain, is usually at a more
positive voltage than the bottom terminal. In this introductory text, we will use the
symbol shown in Figure 3.12(b) for clarity.

The conventional circuit symbol for the p-channel enhancement-mode
MOSFET appears in Figure 3.13(a). Note that the arrowhead direction on the sub-
strate terminal is reversed from that in the n-channel enhancement-mode device.
This circuit symbol again shows the four terminal structure of the MOSFET device.
The circuit symbol for the p-channel enhancement-mode device shown in Fig-
ure 3.13(b) will be used in this text. The arrowhead is on the source terminal indicating
the direction of the current, which for the p-channel device is into the source terminal.
In more advanced texts and journal articles, the circuit symbol of the p-channel
MOSFET shown in Figure 3.13(c) is generally used. Again, the gate terminal is
obvious but includes the O symbol to indicate that this is a PMOS device. It is
implicitly understood that the “top” terminal is the source and the “bottom” terminal
is the drain. The top terminal, in this case the source, is normally at a higher poten-
tial than the bottom terminal. Again, in this text, we will use the symbol shown in
Figure 3.13(b) for clarity.
Additional MOSFET Structures and Circuit Symbols
Before we start analyzing MOSFET circuits, there are two other MOSFET struc-
tures in addition to the n-channel enhancement-mode device and the p-channel
enhancement-mode device that need to be considered.
n-Channel Depletion-Mode MOSFET
Figure 3.14(a) shows the cross section of an n-channel depletion-mode MOSFET.
When zero volts are applied to the gate, an n-channel region or inversion layer exists
under the oxide as a result, for example, of impurities introduced during device
fabrication. Since an n-region connects the n-source and n-drain, a drain-to-source cur-
rent may be generated in the channel even with zero gate voltage. The term depletion
mode means that a channel exists even at zero gate voltage. A negative gate voltage
must be applied to the n-channel depletion-mode MOSFET to turn the device off.
Figure 3.14(b) shows the n-channel depletion mode MOSFET with a negative
applied gate-to-source voltage. A negative gate voltage induces a space-charge
region under the oxide, thereby reducing the thickness of the n-channel region.
The reduced thickness decreases the channel conductance, which in turn reduces
the drain current. When the gate voltage is equal to the threshold voltage, which is

negative for this device, the induced space-charge region extends completely through
the n-channel region, and the current goes to zero. A positive gate voltage creates an
electron accumulation layer, as shown in Figure 3.14(c) which increases the drain
current. The general iD versus vDS family of curves for the n-channel depletion-
mode MOSFET is shown in Figure 3.15.
The current–voltage characteristics deﬁned by Equations (3.2(a)) and (3.2(b))
apply to both enhancement- and depletion-mode n-channel devices. The only
difference is that the threshold voltage VT N is positive for the enhancement-
mode MOSFET and negative for the depletion-mode MOSFET. Even though the
current–voltage characteristics of enhancement- and depletion-mode devices are
described by the same equations, different circuit symbols are used, simply for
purposes of clarity.
The conventional circuit symbol for the n-channel depletion-mode MOSFET is
shown in Figure 3.16(a). The vertical solid line denoting the channel indicates the
device is depletion mode. A comparison of Figures 3.12(a) and 3.16(a) shows that the
only difference between the enhancement- and depletion-mode symbols is the bro-
ken versus the solid line representing the channel.

A simpliﬁed symbol for the n-channel depletion-mode MOSFET is shown in
Figure 3.16(b). The arrowhead is again on the source terminal and indicates the
direction of current, which for the n-channel device is out of the source. The heavy
solid line represents the depletion-mode channel region. Again, using a different
circuit symbol for the depletion-mode device compared to the enhancement-mode
device is simply for clarity in a circuit diagram.
p-Channel Depletion-Mode MOSFET
Figure 3.17 shows the cross section of a p-channel depletion-mode MOSFET, as well
as the biasing conﬁguration and current direction. In the depletion-mode device, a
channel region of holes already exists under the oxide, even with zero gate voltage.
A positive gate voltage is required to turn the device off. Hence the threshold voltage
of a p-channel depletion-mode MOSFET is positive (VT P > 0).
The conventional and simpliﬁed circuit symbols for the p-channel depletion-
mode device are shown in Figure 3.18. The heavy solid line in the simpliﬁed symbol
represents the channel region and denotes the depletion-mode device. The arrowhead
is again on the source terminal and it indicates the current direction.
Complementary MOSFETs
Complementary MOS (CMOS) technology uses both n-channel and p-channel
devices in the same circuit. Figure 3.19 shows the cross section of n-channel and
p-channel devices fabricated on the same chip. CMOS circuits, in general, are more
complicated to fabricate than circuits using entirely NMOS or PMOS devices. Yet, as
we will see in later chapters, CMOS circuits have great advantages over just NMOS
or PMOS circuits.

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
141
In order to fabricate n-channel and p-channel devices that are electrically equiv-
alent, the magnitude of the threshold voltages must be equal, and the n-channel and
p-channel conduction parameters must be equal. Since, in general, μn, and μp are not
equal, the design of equivalent transistors involves adjusting the width-to-length
ratios of the transistors.
Summary of Transistor Operation
We have presented a ﬁrst-order model of the operation of the MOS transistor. For an
n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET, a positive gate-to-source voltage, greater
than the threshold voltage VT N, must be applied to induce an electron inversion layer.
For vGS > VT N , the device is turned on. For an n-channel depletion-mode device, a
channel between the source and drain exists even for vGS = 0. The threshold voltage
is negative, so that a negative value of vGS is required to turn the device off.
For a p-channel device, all voltage polarities and current directions are reversed
compared to the NMOS device. For the p-channel enhancement-mode transistor,
VT P < 0 and for the depletion-mode PMOS transistor, VT P > 0.
Table 3.1 lists the ﬁrst-order equations that describe the i–v relationships in
MOS devices. We note that Kn and Kp are positive values and that the drain current
iD is positive into the drain for the NMOS device and positive out of the drain for the
PMOS device.

Short-Channel Effects
The current–voltage relations given by Equations (3.2(a)) and (3.2(b)) for the n-channel
device and Equations (3.4(a)) and (3.4(b)) for the p-channel device are the ideal
relations for long-channel devices. A long-channel device is generally one whose
channel length is greater than 2 μm. In this device, the horizontal electric ﬁeld in the
channel induced by the drain voltage and the vertical electric ﬁeld induced by the
gate voltage can be treated independently. However, the channel length of present-
day devices is on the order of 0.2 μm or less.
There are several effects in these short-channel devices that inﬂuence and
change the long-channel current–voltage characteristics. One such effect is a variation
3.1.9

142
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
in threshold voltage. The value of threshold voltage is a function of the channel
length. This variation must be considered in the design and fabrication of these
devices. The threshold voltage also becomes a function of the drain voltage. As the
drain voltage increases, the effective threshold voltage decreases. This effect also
inﬂuences the current–voltage characteristics.
The process conduction parameters, k′
n and k′
p, are directly related to the carrier
mobility. We have assumed that the carrier mobilities and corresponding process
conduction parameters are constant. However, the carrier mobility values are func-
tions of the vertical electric ﬁeld in the inversion layer. As the gate voltage and verti-
cal electric ﬁeld increase, the carrier mobility decreases. This result, again, directly
inﬂuences the current–voltage characteristics of the device.
Another effect that occurs in short-channel devices is velocity saturation. As the
horizontal electric ﬁeld increases, the velocity of the carriers reaches a constant value
and will no longer increase with an increase in drain voltage. Velocity saturation will
lower the VDS(sat) voltage value. The drain current will reach its saturation value at
a smaller VDS voltage. The drain current also becomes approximately a linear func-
tion of the gate voltage in the saturation region rather than the quadratic function of
gate voltage in the long-channel characteristics.
Although the analysis of modern MOSFET circuits must take into account these
short-channel effects, we will use the long-channel current–voltage relations in this
introductory text. We will still be able to obtain a good basic understanding of the op-
eration and characteristics of these devices, and we can still obtain a good basic un-
derstanding of the operation and characteristics of MOSFET circuits using the ideal
long-channel current–voltage relations.
Additional Nonideal 
Current–Voltage Characteristics
The ﬁve nonideal effects in the current–voltage characteristics of MOS transistors
are: the ﬁnite output resistance in the saturation region, the body effect, subthreshold
conduction, breakdown effects, and temperature effects. This section will examine
each of these effects.
Finite Output Resistance
In the ideal case, when a MOSFET is biased in the saturation region, the drain
current iD is independent of drain-to-source voltage vDS. However, in actual
MOSFET iD versus vDS characteristics, a nonzero slope does exist beyond the sat-
uration point. For vDS > vDS(sat), the actual point in the channel at which the in-
version charge goes to zero moves away from the drain terminal (see Figure
3.9(d)). The effective channel length decreases, producing the phenomenon called
channel length modulation.
An exaggerated view of the current–voltage characteristics is shown in Figure 3.20.
The curves can be extrapolated so that they intercept the voltage axis at a point
vDS = −VA. The voltage VA is usually deﬁned as a positive quantity. The slope of the
curve in the saturation region can be described by expressing the iD versus vDS char-
acteristic in the form, for an n-channel device,
iD = Kn[(vGS −VT N)2(1 + λvDS)]
(3.7)
where λ is a positive quantity called the channel-length modulation parameter.
3.1.10

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
143
The parameters λ and VA are related. From Equation (3.7), we have
(1 + λ vDS) = 0 at the extrapolated point where iD = 0. At this point, vDS = −VA,
which means that VA = 1/λ.
The output resistance due to the channel length modulation is deﬁned as
ro =
 ∂iD
∂vDS
−1
vGS=const.
(3.8)
From Equation (3.7), the output resistance, evaluated at the Q-point, is

(3.9(a))
or
ro ∼= [λ IDQ]−1 =
1
λ IDQ
= VA
IDQ
(3.9(b))
The output resistance ro is also a factor in the small-signal equivalent circuit of the
MOSFET, which is discussed in the next chapter.
Body Effect
Up to this point, we have assumed that the substrate, or body, is connected to the
source. For this bias condition, the threshold voltage is a constant.
In integrated circuits, however, the substrates of all n-channel MOSFETs are
usually common and are tied to the most negative potential in the circuit. An exam-
ple of two n-channel MOSFETs in series is shown in Figure 3.21. The p-type

substrate is common to the two transistors, and the drain of M1 is common to
the source of M2. When the two transistors are conducting, there is a nonzero drain-
to-source voltage on M1, which means that the source of M2 is not at the same
potential as the substrate. These bias conditions mean that a zero or reverse-bias
voltage exists across the source–substrate pn junction, and a change in the source–
substrate junction voltage changes the threshold voltage. This is called the body
effect. The same situation exists in p-channel devices.
For example, consider the n-channel device shown in Figure 3.22. To maintain a
zero- or reverse-biased source–substrate pn junction, we must have vSB ≥0. The
threshold voltage for this condition is given by
VT N = VT N O + γ

2φf + vSB −

2φf

(3.10)
where VT N O is the threshold voltage for vSB = 0; γ , called the bulk threshold or
body-effect parameter, is related to device properties, and is typically on the order
of 0.5 V1/2; and φf is a semiconductor parameter, typically on the order of 0.35 V,
and is a function of the semiconductor doping. We see from Equation (3.10) that the
threshold voltage in n-channel devices increases due to this body effect.
The body effect can cause a degradation in circuit performance because of the
changing threshold voltage. However, we will generally neglect the body effect in
our circuit analyses, for simplicity.
Subthreshold Conduction
If we consider the ideal current-voltage relationship for the n-channel MOSFET
biased in the saturation region, we have, from Equation (3.2(b)),
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2
Taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we obtain

iD =

Kn(vGS −VT N)
(3.11)
From Equation (3.11), we see that √id is a linear function of vGS. Figure 3.23 shows
a plot of this ideal relationship.
Also plotted in Figure 3.23 are experimental results, which show that when vGS
is slightly less than VT N, the drain current is not zero, as previously assumed. This
current is called the subthreshold current. The effect may not be signiﬁcant for a
single device, but if thousands or millions of devices on an integrated circuit are
biased just slightly below the threshold voltage, the power supply current will not
be zero but may contribute to signiﬁcant power dissipation in the integrated circuit.
One example of this is a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), as we will see in
Chapter 16.
In this text, for simplicity we will not speciﬁcally consider the subthreshold
current. However, when a MOSFET in a circuit is to be turned off, the “proper”
design of the circuit must involve biasing the device at least a few tenths of a volt
below the threshold voltage to achieve “true” cutoff.
Breakdown Effects
Several possible breakdown effects may occur in a MOSFET. The drain-to-substrate
pn junction may break down if the applied drain voltage is too high and avalanche
multiplication occurs. This breakdown is the same reverse-biased pn junction break-
down discussed in Chapter 1 in Section 1.2.5.

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
145
As the size of the device becomes smaller, another breakdown mechanism,
called punch-through, may become signiﬁcant. Punch-through occurs when the
drain voltage is large enough for the depletion region around the drain to extend com-
pletely through the channel to the source terminal. This effect also causes the drain
current to increase rapidly with only a small increase in drain voltage.
A third breakdown mechanism is called near-avalanche or snapback break-
down. This breakdown process is due to second-order effects within the MOSFET.
The source-substrate-drain structure is equivalent to that of a bipolar transistor. As
the device size shrinks, we may begin to see a parasitic bipolar transistor action with
increases in the drain voltage. This parasitic action enhances the breakdown effect.
If the electric ﬁeld in the oxide becomes large enough, breakdown can also occur
in the oxide, which can lead to catastrophic failure. In silicon dioxide, the electric
ﬁeld at breakdown is on the order of 6 × 106 V/cm, which, to a ﬁrst approximation,
is given by Eox = VG/tox. A gate voltage of approximately 30 V would produce
breakdown in an oxide with a thickness of tox = 500 ˚A. However, a safety margin of
a factor of 3 is common, which means that the maximum safe gate voltage for
tox = 500 ˚A would be 10 V. A safety margin is necessary since there may be defects
in the oxide that lower the breakdown ﬁeld. We must also keep in mind that the input
impedance at the gate is very high, and a small amount of static charge accumulating
on the gate can cause the breakdown voltage to be exceeded. To prevent the accumu-
lation of static charge on the gate capacitance of a MOSFET, a gate protection
device, such as a reverse-biased diode, is usually included at the input of a MOS
integrated circuit.
Temperature Effects
Both the threshold voltage VT N and conduction parameter Kn are functions of tem-
perature. The magnitude of the threshold voltage decreases with temperature, which
means that the drain current increases with temperature at a given VGS. However, the
conduction parameter is a direct function of the inversion carrier mobility, which de-
creases as the temperature increases. Since the temperature dependence of mobility is
larger than that of the threshold voltage, the net effect of increasing temperature is a de-
crease in drain current at a given VGS. This particular result provides a negative feed-
back condition in power MOSFETs. A decreasing value of Kn inherently limits the
channel current and provides stability for a power MOSFET.

MOSFET DC CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
Objective: • Understand and become familiar with the dc analysis
and design techniques of MOSFET circuits.
In the last section, we considered the basic MOSFET characteristics and properties.
We now start analyzing and designing the dc biasing of MOS transistor circuits.
A primary purpose of the rest of the chapter is to continue to become familiar and
comfortable with the MOS transistor and MOSFET circuits. The dc biasing of
MOSFETs, the focus of this chapter, is an important part of the design of ampliﬁers.
MOSFET ampliﬁer design is the focus of the next chapter.
In most of the circuits presented in this chapter, resistors are used in conjunction
with the MOS transistors. In a real MOSFET integrated circuit, however, the resistors
are generally replaced by other MOSFETs, so the circuit is composed entirely of MOS
devices. In general, a MOSFET device requires a smaller area than a resistor. As we
go through the chapter, we will begin to see how this is accomplished and as we ﬁn-
ish the text, we will indeed analyze and design circuits containing only MOSFETs.
In the dc analysis of MOSFET circuits, we can use the ideal current–voltage
equations listed in Table 3.l in Section 3.1.
Common-Source Circuit
One of the basic MOSFET circuit conﬁgurations is called the common-source
circuit. Figure 3.24 shows one example of this type of circuit using an n-channel

enhancement-mode MOSFET. The source terminal is at ground potential and is
common to both the input and output portions of the circuit. The coupling capacitor
CC acts as an open circuit to dc but it allows the signal voltage to be coupled to the
gate of the MOSFET.
The dc equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 3.25(a). In the following dc ana-
lyses, we again use the notation for dc currents and voltages. Since the gate current
into the transistor is zero, the voltage at the gate is given by a voltage divider, which
can be written as
VG = VGS =

R2
R1 + R2

VDD
(3.12)
Assuming that the gate-to-source voltage given by Equation (3.12) is greater
than VT N, and that the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the drain current is
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2
(3.13)
The drain-to-source voltage is
VDS = VDD −ID RD
(3.14)
If VDS > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N , then the transistor is biased in the saturation
region, as we initially assumed, and our analysis is correct. If VDS < VDS(sat), then
the transistor is biased in the nonsaturation region, and the drain current is given by
the more complicated characteristic Equation (3.2(a)).
The power dissipated in the transistor, since there is no gate current, is simply
given by
PT = IDVDS
(3.15)

Objective: Calculate the drain current and drain-to-source voltage of a common-

Assuming the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the drain current is
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2 = (0.1)(2 −1)2 = 0.1 mA
and the drain-to-source voltage is
VDS = VDD −ID RD = 5 −(0.1)(20) = 3 V
The power dissipated in the transistor is
PT = IDVDS = (0.1)(3) = 0.3 mW
Comment: Because VDS = 3 V > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N = 2 −1 = 1 V, the tran-
sistor is indeed biased in the saturation region and our analysis is valid.
The dc analysis produces the quiescent values (Q-points) of drain current and
drain-to-source voltage, usually indicated by IDQ and VDSQ.

Figure 3.26 (a) shows a common-source circuit with a p-channel enhancement-

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.26(a). Assume that R1 = R2 = 50 k,
VDD = 5 V, RD = 7.5 k, VT P = −0.8 V, and Kp = 0.2 mA/V2.
Solution: From the circuit shown in Figure 3.26(b) and Equation (3.16), we have
VG =

R2
R1 + R2

(VDD) =

50
50 + 50

(5) = 2.5 V
The source-to-gate voltage is therefore
VSG = VDD −VG = 5 −2.5 = 2.5 V
Assuming the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the drain current is
ID = Kp(VSG + VT P)2 = (0.2)(2.5 −0.8)2 = 0.578 mA
and the source-to-drain voltage is
VSD = VDD −ID RD = 5 −(0.578)(7.5) = 0.665 V
Since VSD = 0.665 V is not greater than VSD(sat) = VSG + VT P = 2.5 −0.8 =
1.7 V, the p-channel MOSFET is not biased in the saturation region, as we initially
assumed.
In the nonsaturation region, the drain current is given by
ID = Kp

2(VSG + VT P)VSD −V 2
SD

and the source-to-drain voltage is
VSD = VDD −ID RD
Combining these two equations, we obtain
ID = Kp[2(VSG + VT P)(VDD −ID RD) −(VDD −ID RD)2]

or
ID = (0.2)[2(2.5 −0.8)(5 −ID(7.5)) −(5 −ID(7.5))2]
Solving this quadratic equation for ID, we ﬁnd
ID = 0.515 mA
We also ﬁnd that
VSD = 1.14 V
Therefore, VSD < VSD(sat), which veriﬁes that the transistor is biased in the nonsat-
uration region.
Comment: In solving the quadratic equation for ID, we ﬁnd a second solution that
yields VSD = 2.93 V. However, this value of VSD is greater than VSD(sat), so it is not
a valid solution since we assumed the transistor to be biased in the nonsaturation
region.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.4: The transistor in Figure 3.26(a) has parameters VT P = −0.6 V and Kp =
0.2 mA/V2. The circuit is biased at VDD = 3.3 V. Assume R1∥R2 = 300 k. De-
sign the circuit such that IDQ = 0.5 mA and VSDQ = 2.0 V. (Ans. R1 = 885 k,
R2 = 454 k, RD = 2.6 k)
COMPUTER ANALYSIS EXERCISE
PS 3.1: Verify the results of Example 3.4 with a PSpice analysis.
As Example 3.4 illustrated, we may not know initially whether a transistor is
biased in the saturation or nonsaturation region. The approach involves making an
educated guess and then verifying that assumption. If the assumption proves incor-
rect, we must then change it and reanalyze the circuit.
In linear ampliﬁers containing MOSFETs, the transistors are biased in the satu-
ration region.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.5
Objective: Design a MOSFET circuit biased with both positive and negative volt-
ages to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 3.27.
Design the circuit such that IDQ = 0.5 mA and VDSQ = 4 V.
Choices: Standard resistors are to be used in the final design. A transistor with
nominal parameters of k′
n = 80 μA/V2, (W/L) = 6.25, and VT N = 1.2 V is
available.

or
VGS = 2.614 V
Since the gate current is zero, the gate is at ground potential. The voltage at the source
terminal is then VS = −VGS = −2.614 V. The value of the source resistor is found from
RS = VS −V −
IDQ
= −2.614 −(−5)
0.5
or
RS = 4.77 k
The voltage at the drain terminal is determined to be
VD = VS + VDS = −2.614 + 4 = 1.386 V
The value of the drain resistor is
RD = V + −VD
IDQ
= 5 −1.386
0.5
or
RD = 7.23 k
We may note that
VDS = 4 V > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N = 2.61 −1.2 = 1.41 V
which means that the transistor is indeed biased in the saturation region.
Trade-offs: The closest standard resistor values are RS = 4.7 k and RD = 7.5 k.
We may ﬁnd the gate-to-source voltage from
VGS + ID RS −5 = 0
where
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2
Using the standard resistor values, we ﬁnd VGS = 2.622 V, IDQ = 0.506 mA, and
VDSQ = 3.83 V. In this case, the drain current is within 1.2 percent of the design speci-
ﬁcation and the drain-to-source voltage is within 4.25 percent of the design speciﬁcation.
Comment: It is important to keep in mind that the current into the gate terminal is
zero. In this case, then, there is zero voltage drop across the RG resistor.
Design Pointer: In an actual circuit design using discrete elements, we need to
choose standard resistor values that are closest to the design values. In addition, the
discrete resistors have tolerances that need to be taken into account. In the ﬁnal de-
sign, then, the actual drain current and drain-to-source voltage are somewhat differ-
ent from the speciﬁed values. In many applications, this slight deviation from the
speciﬁed values will not cause a problem.

Ex 3.5: For the transistor in the circuit in Figure 3.28, the nominal parameter val-
ues are VT N = 0.6 V and Kn = 0.5 mA/V2. (a) Determine the quiescent values
VGSQ, IDQ, and VDSQ. (b) Determine the range in ID and VDS values for a ±5

VDSQ = 2.724 V; (b) 0.5105 ≤ID ≤0.6314 mA, 2.474 ≤VDS ≤2.958 V)
Now consider an example of a p-channel device biased with both positive and nega-
tive voltages.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.6
Objective: Design a circuit with a p-channel MOSFET that is biased with both neg-
ative and positive supply voltages and that contains a source resistor RS to meet a set
of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit to be designed is shown in Figure 3.29. Design the circuit
such that IDQ = 100 μA, VSDQ = 3 V, and VRS = 0.8 V. Note that VRS is the volt-
age across the source resistor RS. The value of the larger bias resistor, either R1 or
R2, is to be 200 k.
Choices: A transistor with nominal parameter values of Kp = 100 μA/V2 and
VT P = −0.4 V is available. The conduction parameter may vary by ±5 percent.
Solution: Assuming that the transistor is biased in the saturation region, we have
IDQ = Kp(VSG + VT P)2. Solving for the source-to-gate voltage, we ﬁnd the required
value of source-to-gate voltage to be
VSG =

IDQ
Kp
−VT P =

or
VSG = 1.4 V
We may note that the design value of
VSDQ = 3 V > VSDQ (sat) = VSGQ + VT P = 1.4 −0.4 = 1 V
so that the transistor will be biased in the saturation region. 
The voltage at the gate with respect to ground potential is found to be
VG = V + −VRS −VSG = 2.5 −0.8 −1.4 = 0.3 V
With VG > 0, the resistor R2 will be the larger of the two bias resistors, so set
R2 = 200 k. The current through R2 is then
IBias = VG −V −
R2
= 0.3 −(−2.5)
200
= 0.014 mA
Since the current through R1 is the same, we can ﬁnd the value of R1 to be
R1 = V + −VG
IBias
= 2.5 −0.3
0.014
which yields
R1 = 157 k

The source resistor value is found from
RS = VRS
IDQ

0.1
or
RS = 8 k
The voltage at the drain terminal is
VD = V + −VRS −VSD = 2.5 −0.8 −3 = −1.3 V
Then the drain resistor value is found as
RD = VD −V −
IDQ
= −1.3 −(−2.5)
0.1
or
RD = 12 k
Trade-offs: If the conduction parameter Kp varies by ±5%, the quiescent drain cur-
rent IDQ and the source-to-drain voltage VSDQ will change. Using the resistor values
found in the previous design, we ﬁnd the following:
Kp

parameters are VT P = −0.30 V and Kp = 120 μA/V2. (a) Calculate VSG, ID,
and VSD. (b) Determine the variation in ID if the threshold voltage varies by
±5 percent. (Ans. (a) VSG = 1.631 V,
ID = 0.2126 mA,

(b) 0.2091 ≤ID ≤0.2160 mA)

PS 3.2 Verify the circuit design in Example 3.6 with a PSpice simulation. Also
investigate the change in Q-point values with ±10 percent variations in resistor values.
Load Line and Modes of Operation
The load line is helpful in visualizing the region in which the MOSFET is biased.
Consider again the common-source circuit shown in Figure 3.25(b). Writing a
Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation around the drain-source loop results in Equa-
tion (3.14), which is the load line equation, showing a linear relationship between
the drain current and drain-to-source voltage.

and is also plotted in the ﬁgure. The two end points of the load line are determined in
the usual manner. If ID = 0, then VDS = 5 V; if VDS = 0, then ID = 5/20 =
0.25 mA. The Q-point of the transistor is given by the dc drain current and drain-to-
source voltage, and it is always on the load line, as shown in the ﬁgure. A few
transistor characteristics are also shown on the ﬁgure.
If the gate-to-source voltage is less than VTN, the drain current is zero and the
transistor is in cutoff. As the gate-to-source voltage becomes just greater than VTN,
the transistor turns on and is biased in the saturation region. As VGS increases, the
Q-point moves up the load line. The transition point is the boundary between
the saturation and nonsaturation regions and is deﬁned as the point where VDS =
VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N. As VGS increases above the transition point value, the tran-
sistor becomes biased in the nonsaturation region.
EXAMPLE 3.7
Objective: Determine the transition point parameters for a common-source circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.25(b). Assume transistor parameters of
VT N = 1 V and Kn = 0.1 mA/V2.
Solution: At the transition point,
VDS = VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N = VDD −ID RD
The drain current is still
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2
Combining the last two equations, we obtain

Rearranging this equation produces
Kn RD(VGS −VT N)2 + (VGS −VT N) −VDD = 0
or
(0.1)(20)(VGS −VT N)2 + (VGS −VT N) −5 = 0
Solving the quadratic equation, we ﬁnd that
VGS −VT N = 1.35 V = VDS
Therefore,
VGS = 2.35 V
and
ID = (0.1)(2.35 −1)2 = 0.182 mA
Comment: For VGS < 2.35 V, the transistor is biased in the saturation region; for
VGS > 2.35 V, the transistor is biased in the nonsaturation region.

ters described in Exercise Ex 3.6, draw the load line and determine the transition

Problem-Solving Technique: MOSFET DC Analysis
Analyzing the dc response of a MOSFET circuit requires knowing the bias con-
dition (saturation or nonsaturation) of the transistor. In some cases, the bias
condition may not be obvious, which means that we have to guess the bias condi-
tion, then analyze the circuit to determine if we have a solution consistent with our
initial guess. To do this, we can:
1.
Assume that the transistor is biased in the saturation region, in which case
VGS > VT N , ID > 0, and VDS ≥VDS(sat).
2.
Analyze the circuit using the saturation current-voltage relations.
3.
Evaluate the resulting bias condition of the transistor. If the assumed parame-
ter values in step 1 are valid, then the initial assumption is correct. If
VGS < VT N , then the transistor is probably cutoff, and if VDS < VDS(sat), the
transistor is likely biased in the nonsaturation region.
4.
If the initial assumption is proved incorrect, then a new assumption must be
made and the circuit reanalyzed. Step 3 must then be repeated.
Additional MOSFET Conﬁgurations: DC Analysis
There are other MOSFET circuits, in addition to the basic common-source circuits
just considered, that are biased with the basic four-resistor conﬁguration.
However, MOSFET integrated circuit ampliﬁers are generally biased with constant
current sources. Example 3.8 demonstrates this technique using an ideal current source.

Choices: A transistor with nominal values of VT N = 0.8 V, k′

W/L = 3 is available. Assume k′
n varies by ±5 percent.
Solution: The dc equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 3.32(b). Since vi = 0, the
gate is at ground potential and there is no current through RG. We have that

Since VDS = 4.74 V > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N = 2.24 −0.8 = 1.44 V, the transis-
tor is biased in the saturation region, as initially assumed.
Trade-offs: Note that even if k′
n changes, the drain current remains constant. For
76 ≤k′
n ≤84 μA/V2, the variation in VGSQ is 2.209 ≤VGSQ ≤2.281 V and the
variation in VDSQ is 4.709 ≤VDSQ ≤4.781 V. The variation in VDSQ is ±0.87 per-
cent even with a ±5 percent variation in k′
n. This stability effect is one advantage of
using constant current biasing.
Comment: MOSFET circuits can be biased by using constant-current sources,
which in turn are designed by using other MOS transistors, as we will see. Biasing
with current sources tends to stabilize circuits against variations in device or circuit
parameters.

n-Channel Enhancement-Load Device
An enhancement-mode MOSFET connected in a conﬁguration such as that shown in
Figure 3.34 can be used as a nonlinear resistor. A transistor with this connection is
called an enhancement-load device. Since the transistor is an enhancement mode
device, VT N > 0. Also, for this circuit, vDS = vGS > vDS(sat) = vGS −VT N , which
means that the transistor is always biased in the saturation region. The general iD ver-
sus vDS characteristics can then be written as
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2 = Kn(vDS −VT N)2
(3.21)
Figure 3.35 shows a plot of Equation (3.21) for the case when Kn = 1 mA/V2 and

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
If an enhancement-load device is connected in a circuit with another MOSFET
in the conﬁguration shown in Figure 3.36, the circuit can be used as an ampliﬁer or
as an inverter in a digital logic circuit. The load device, ML, is always biased in the
saturation region, and the transistor MD, called the driver transistor, can be biased
in either the saturation or nonsaturation region, depending on the value of the input
voltage. The next example addresses the dc analysis of this circuit for dc input volt-
ages to the gate of MD.
EXAMPLE 3.9
Objective: Determine the dc transistor currents and voltages in a circuit containing
an enhancement load device.
The transistors in the circuit shown in Figure 3.36 have parameters VT N D =
VT N L = 1 V,
KnD = 50 μA/V2, and KnL = 10 μA/V2. Also assume λnD =
λnL = 0. (The subscript D applies to the driver transistor and the subscript L applies
to the load transistor.) Determine VO for VI = 5 V and VI = 1.5 V.
Solution: (VI = 5 V) For an inverter circuit with a resistive load, when the input
voltage is large, the output voltage drops to a low value. Therefore, we assume that
the driver transistor is biased in the nonsaturation region since the drain-to-source
voltage will be small. The drain current in the load device is equal to the drain cur-
rent in the driver transistor. Writing these currents in generic form, we have

Rearranging the terms provides
3V 2
O −24VO + 8 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we obtain two possible solutions:
VO = 7.65 V
or
VO = 0.349 V
Since the output voltage cannot be greater than the supply voltage VDD = 5 V, the
valid solution is VO = 0.349 V.
Also, since VDSD = VO = 0.349 V < VGSD −VT N D = 5 −1 = 4 V, the driver
MD is biased in the nonsaturation region, as initially assumed.
The current can be determined from
ID = KnL(VGSL −VT N L)2 = KnL(VDD −VO −VT N L)2
or
ID = (10)(5 −0.349 −1)2 = 133 μA
Solution: (VI = 1.5 V) Since the threshold voltage of the driver transistor is
VT N = 1 V, an input voltage of 1.5 V means the transistor current is going to be rela-
tively small so the output voltage should be relatively large. For this reason, we will
assume that the driver transistor MD is biased in the saturation region. Equating the cur-
rents in the two transistors and writing the current equations in generic form, we have
IDD = IDL
or
KnD[VGSD −VT N D]2 = KnL[VGSL −VT N L]2
Again, since VGSD = VI and VGSL = VDSL = VDD −VO , then
KnD[VI −VT N D]2 = KnL[VDD −VO −VT N L]2
Substituting numbers and taking the square root, we ﬁnd
√
50[1.5 −1] =
√
10[5 −VO −1]
which yields VO = 2.88 V.
Since VDSD = VO = 2.88 V > VGSD −VT N D = 1.5 −1 = 0.5 V, the driver
transistor MD is biased in the saturation region, as initially assumed.
The current is
ID = KnD(VGSD −VT N D)2 = (50)(1.5 −1)2 = 12.5 μA
Comment: For this example, we made an initial guess as to whether the driver tran-
sistor was biased in the saturation or nonsaturation region. A more analytical ap-
proach is shown following this example.
Computer Simulation: The voltage transfer characteristics of the NMOS inverter
with enhancement load shown in Figure 3.36 were obtained by a PSpice analysis.
These results are shown in Figure 3.37. As the input voltage decreases from its high
state, the output voltage increases, charging and discharging capacitances in the tran-
sistors. The current in the circuit goes to zero when the driver transistor is cutoff. This
occurs when VI = VGSD = VT N = 1 V. At this point, the output voltage is VO = 4 V.
Since there is no current, the capacitances cease charging and discharging so the out-
put voltage cannot get to the full VDD = 5 V value. The maximum output voltage is
VO(max) = VDD −VT N L = 5 −1 = 4 V.

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
When the input voltage is just greater than 1 V, both transistors are biased in the
saturation region as the previous analysis for VI = 1.5 V showed. The output voltage
is a linear function of input voltage as we will see in Equation (3.24).
For an input voltage greater than approximately 2.25 V, the driver transistor is
biased in the nonsaturation region and the output voltage is a nonlinear function of
input voltage.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.9: Consider the NMOS inverter shown in Figure 3.36 with transistor para-
meters described in Example 3.9. Determine the output voltage VO for input volt-
ages (a) VI = 4 V and (b) VI = 2 V. (Ans. (a) 0.454 V, (b) 1.76 V)

fer characteristics, using a PSpice simulation. Use transistor parameters similar to
those in Example 3.9. What are the values of VO for VI = 1.5 V and VI = 5 V?
In the circuit shown in Figure 3.36, we can determine the transition point for the
driver transistor that separates the saturation and nonsaturation regions. The transi-
tion point is determined by the equation
VDSD(sat) = VGSD −VT N D
(3.22)
Again, the drain currents in the two transistors are equal. Using the saturation
drain current relationship for the driver transistor, we have

Again, noting that VGSD = VI and VGSL = VDSL = VDD −VO , and taking the
square root, we have

KnD
KnL
(VI −VT N D) = (VDD −VO −VT N L)
(3.24)
At the transition point, we can deﬁne the input voltage as VI = VIt and the out-
put voltage as VOt = VDSD(sat) = VIt −VT N D. Then, from Equation (3.24), the
input voltage at the transition point is
VIt = VDD −VT N L + VT N D(1 + √KnD/KnL)
1 + √KnD/KnL
(3.25)
If we apply Equation (3.25) to the previous example, we can show that our initial as-
sumptions were correct.
n-Channel Depletion-Load Device
An n-channel depletion-mode MOSFET can also be used as a load device. Consider
the depletion-mode MOSFET with the gate and source connected together shown in
Figure 3.38(a). The current–voltage characteristics are shown in Figure 3.38(b). The
transistor may be biased in either the saturation or nonsaturation regions. The transi-
tion point is also shown on the plot. The threshold voltage of the n-channel depletion-
mode MOSFET is negative so that vDS(sat) is positive.
A depletion-load device can be used in conjunction with another MOSFET, as
shown in Figure 3.39, to create a circuit that can be used as an ampliﬁer or as an
inverter in a digital logic circuit. Both the load device ML and driver transistor MD
may be biased in either the saturation or nonsaturation region, depending on the
value of the input voltage. We will perform the dc analysis of this circuit for a
particular dc input voltage to the gate of the driver transistor.
EXAMPLE 3.10
Objective: Determine the dc transistor currents and voltages in a circuit containing
a depletion load device.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.39. Let VDD = 5 V and assume transistor
parameters of VT N D = 1 V, VT N L = −2 V, KnD = 50 μA/V2, and KnL = 10 μA/V2.

Solution: Assume the driver transistor MD is biased in the nonsaturation region and
the load transistor ML is biased in the saturation region. The drain currents in the two
transistors are equal. In generic form, these currents are

Rearranging the terms produces
5V 2
O −40VO + 4 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we obtain two possible solutions:
VO = 7.90 V
or
VO = 0.10 V
Since the output voltage cannot be greater than the supply voltage VDD = 5 V, the
valid solution is VO = 0.10 V.
The current is
ID = KnL(−VT N L)2 = (10)[−(−2)]2 = 40 μA
Comment: Since VDSD = VO = 0.10 V < VGSD −VT N D = 5 −1 = 4 V, MD is
biased in the nonsaturation region, as assumed. Similarly, since VDSL = VDD −VO =
4.9 V > VGSL −VT N L = 0 −(−2) = 2 V, ML is biased in the saturation region, as
originally assumed.
Computer Simulation: The voltage transfer characteristics of the NMOS inverter
circuit with depletion load in Figure 3.39 were obtained using a PSpice analysis.
These results are shown in Figure 3.40. For an input voltage less than 1 V, the driver
is cut off and the output voltage is VO = VDD = 5 V.

When the input voltage is just greater than 1 V, the driver transistor is biased in
the saturation region and the load device in the nonsaturation region. When the input
voltage is approximately 1.9 V, both transistors are biased in the saturation region. If
the channel length modulation parameter λ is assumed to be zero as in this example,
there is no change in the input voltage during this transition region. As the input volt-
age becomes larger than 1.9 V, the driver is biased in the nonsaturation region and the
load in the saturation region.
EXERCISE PROBLEM

VT N D = 1 V and VT N L = −2 V. (a) Design the ratio KnD/KnL that will produce
an output voltage of VO = 0.25 V at VI = 5 V. (b) Find KnD and KnL if the
transistor currents are 0.2 mA when VI = 5 V. (Ans. (a) KnD/KnL = 2.06
(b) KnL = 50 μA/V2, KnD = 103 μA/V2)
COMPUTER ANALYSIS EXERCISE
PS 3.4: Consider the NMOS circuit shown in Figure 3.39. Plot the voltage trans-
fer characteristics using a PSpice simulation. Use transistor parameters similar to
those in Example 3.10. What are the values of VO for VI = 1.5 V and VI = 5 V?
p-Channel Enhancement-Load Device
A p-channel enhancement-mode transistor can also be used as a load device to form
a complementary MOS (CMOS) inverter. The term complementary implies that
both n-channel and p-channel transistors are used in the same circuit. The CMOS
technology is used extensively in both analog and digital electronic circuits.
Figure 3.41 shows one example of a CMOS inverter. The NMOS transistor is
used as the amplifying device, or the driver, and the PMOS device is the load, which
is referred to as an active load. This conﬁguration is typically used in analog applications.

In another conﬁguration, the two gates are tied together and form the input. This con-
ﬁguration will be discussed in detail in Chapter 16.
As with the previous two NMOS inverters, the two transistors shown in Fig-
ure 3.41 may be biased in either the saturation or nonsaturation region, depending
on the value of the input voltage. The voltage transfer characteristic is most easily
determined from a PSpice analysis.
EXAMPLE 3.11
Objective: Determine the voltage transfer characteristic of the CMOS inverter using
a PSpice analysis.
For the circuit shown in Figure 3.41, assume transistor parameters of VT N = 1 V,
VT P = −1 V, and Kn = Kp. Also assume VDD = 5 V and VG = 3.25 V.
Solution: The voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 3.42. In this case,
there is a region, as was the case for an NMOS inverter with depletion load, in which
both transistors are biased in the saturation region, and the input voltage is a constant
over this transition region for the assumption that the channel length modulation
parameter λ is zero.
Comment: In this example, the source-to-gate voltage of the PMOS device is only
VSG = 1.75 V. The effective resistance looking into the drain of the PMOS device is
then relatively large. This is a desirable characteristic for an ampliﬁer, as we will see
in the next chapter.

BASIC MOSFET APPLICATIONS: SWITCH,
DIGITAL LOGIC GATE, AND AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Examine three applications of MOSFET circuits: a switch
circuit, digital logic circuit, and an ampliﬁer circuit.
MOSFETs may be used to: switch currents, voltages, and power; perform digital logic
functions; and amplify small time-varying signals. In this section, we will examine the
switching properties of an NMOS transistor, analyze a simple NMOS transistor digi-
tal logic circuit, and discuss how the MOSFET can be used to amplify small signals.
NMOS Inverter
The MOSFET can be used as a switch in a wide variety of electronic applications.
The transistor switch provides an advantage over mechanical switches in both speed
and reliability. The transistor switch considered in this section is also called an in-
verter. Two other switch conﬁgurations, the NMOS transmission gate and the CMOS
transmission gate, are discussed in Chapter 16.
Figure 3.45 shows the n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET inverter circuit.
If vI < VT N , the transistor is in cutoff and iD = 0. There is no voltage drop across
RD, and the output voltage is vO = VDD. Also, since iD = 0, no power is dissipated
in the transistor.
If vI > VT N , the transistor is on and initially is biased in the saturation region,
since vDS > vGS −VT N . As the input voltage increases, the drain-to-source voltage

decreases, and the transistor eventually becomes biased in the nonsaturation region.
When vI = VDD, the transistor is biased in the nonsaturation region, vO reaches a
minimum value, and the drain current reaches a maximum value. The current and
voltage are given by
iD = Kn

(3.26)
and
vO = vDD −iD RD
(3.27)
where vO = vDS and vI = vGS.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.12
Objective: Design the size of a power MOSFET to meet the speciﬁcation of a par-
ticular switch application.
The load in the inverter circuit in Figure 3.45 is a coil of an electromagnet that
requires a current of 0.5 A when turned on. The effective load resistance varies be-
tween 8 and 10 , depending on temperature and other variables. A 10 V power sup-
ply is available. The transistor parameters are k′
n = 80 μA/V2 and VT N = 1 V.
Solution: One solution is to bias the transistor in the saturation region so that the
current is constant, independent of the load resistance.
The minimum VDS value is 5 V. We need VDS > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N . If we
bias the transistor at VGS = 5 V, then the transistor will always be biased in the satu-
ration region. We can then write
ID = k′

or

which yields W/L = 781.
The maximum power dissipation in the transistor occurs when the load resis-
tance is 8  and VDS = 6 V. Then
P(max) = VDS(max) · ID = (6) · (0.5) = 3 W
Comment: We see that we can switch a relatively large drain current with essen-
tially no input current to the transistor. The size of the transistor required is fairly
large, which implies a power transistor is necessary. If a transistor with a slightly
different width-to-length ratio is available, the applied VGS can be changed to meet
the speciﬁcation.

vO = 0.2 V when vI = 5 V. (b) What is the power dissipated in the transistor?
(Ans. (a) Kn = 6.15 mA/V2, (b) P = 1.92 mW)

Digital Logic Gate
For the transistor inverter circuit in Figure 3.45, when the input is low and approxi-
mately zero volts, the transistor is cut off, and the output is high and equal to VDD.
When the input is high and equal to VDD, the transistor is biased in the nonsaturation
region and the output reaches a low value. Since the input voltages will be either high
or low, we can analyze the circuit in terms of dc parameters.
Now consider the case when a second transistor is connected in parallel, as shown in
Figure 3.46. If the two inputs are zero, both M1 and M2 are cut off, and VO = 5 V. When
V1 = 5 V and V2 = 0, the transistor M1 turns on and M2 is still cut off. Transistor M1 is
biased in the nonsaturation region, and VO reaches a low value. If we reverse the input
voltages such that V1 = 0 and V2 = 5 V, then M1 is cut off and M2 is biased in the non-
saturation region. Again, VO is at a low value. If both inputs are high, at V1 = V2 = 5 V,
then both transistors are biased in the nonsaturation region and VO is low.

Table 3.2 shows these various conditions for the circuit in Figure 3.46. In a pos-
itive logic system, these results indicate that this circuit performs the NOR logic
function, and, it is therefore called a two-input NOR logic circuit. In actual NMOS
logic circuits, the resistor RD is replaced by another NMOS transistor.
EXAMPLE 3.13
Objective: Determine the currents and voltages in a digital logic gate, for various
input conditions.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.46 with circuit and transistor parameters
RD = 20 k, Kn = 0.1 mA/V2, VT N = 0.8 V, and λ = 0.

Solution: For V1 = V2 = 0, both M1 and M2 are cut off and VO = VDD = 5 V. For

For V1 = 0 and V2 = 5 V, we have VO = 0.29 V and IR = ID2 = 0.236 mA.

ters are: RD = 30 k, VT N = 1 V, and Kn = 50 μA/V2. Determine VO, IR, ID1,

IR = ID1 = 0.153 mA, ID2 = 0 (b) VO = 0.205 V, IR = 0.16 mA, ID1 = ID2 =

This example and discussion illustrates that MOS transistors can be conﬁgured
in a circuit to perform logic functions. A more detailed analysis and design of
MOSFET logic gates and circuits is presented in Chapter 16. As we will see in that
chapter, most MOS logic gate circuits are fabricated by using CMOS, which means
designing circuits with both n-channel and p-channel transistors and no resistors.
MOSFET Small-Signal Ampliﬁer
The MOSFET, in conjunction with other circuit elements, can amplify small time-
varying signals. Figure 3.47(a) shows the MOSFET small-signal ampliﬁer, which is
a common-source circuit in which a time-varying signal is coupled to the gate
through a coupling capacitor. Figure 3.47(b) shows the transistor characteristics and
the load line. The load line is determined for vi = 0.
3.3.3

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
169
We can establish a particular Q-point on the load line by designing the ratio of
the bias resistors R1 and R2. If we assume that vi = Vi sin ωt, the gate-to-source volt-
age will have a sinusoidal signal superimposed on the dc quiescent value. As
the gate-to-source voltage changes over time, the Q-point will move up and down the
line, as indicated in the ﬁgure.
Moving up and down the load line translates into a sinusoidal variation in the
drain current and in the drain-to-source voltage. The variation in output voltage can
be larger than the input signal voltage, which means the input signal is ampliﬁed. The
actual signal gain depends on both the transistor parameters and the circuit element
values.
In the next chapter, we will develop an equivalent circuit for the transistor used
to determine the time-varying small-signal gain and other characteristics of the
circuit.

CONSTANT-CURRENT BIASING
Objective: • Investigate current biasing of MOSFET devices.
As was shown in Figure 3.32, a MOSFET can be biased with a constant-current
source IQ. The gate-to-source voltage of the transistor in this circuit then adjusts
itself to correspond to the current IQ.
We can implement the current source by using MOSFET devices. The circuits
shown in Figures 3.49(a) and 3.49(b) are a ﬁrst step toward this design. The transis-
tors M2 and M3 in Figure 3.49(a) form a current mirror and are used to bias the
NMOS transistor M1. Similarly, the transistors MB and MC in Figure 3.49(b) form a
current mirror and are used to bias the PMOS transistor MA.

The operation and characteristics of these circuits are demonstrated in the
following two examples.
EXAMPLE 3.14
Objective: Analyze the circuit shown in Figure 3.49(a). Determine the bias current IQ1,
the gate-to-source voltages of the transistors, and the drain-to-source voltage of M1.
Assume circuit parameters of IREF1 = 200 μA, V + = 2.5 V, and V −= −2.5 V.
Assume transistor parameters of VT N = 0.4 V (all transistors), λ = 0 (all transis-
tors), Kn1 = 0.25 mA/V2, and Kn2 = Kn3 = 0.15 mA/V2.

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
171
Solution: The drain current in M3 is ID3 = IREF1 = 200 μA and is given by the re-
lation ID3 = Kn3(VGS3 −VT N)2 (the transistor is biased in the saturation region).
Solving for the gate-to-source voltage, we ﬁnd
VGS3 =

ID3
Kn3
+ VT N =
	
0.2
0.15 + 0.4
or
VGS3 = 1.555 V
We note that VGS3 = VGS2 = 1.555 V. We can write
ID2 = IQ1 = Kn2(VGS2 −VT N)2 = 0.15(1.555 −0.4)2
or
IQ1 = 200 μA
The gate-to-source voltage VGS1 (assuming M1 is biased in the saturation region) can
be written as
VGS1 =

IQ1
Kn1
+ VT N =
	
0.2
0.25 + 0.4
or
VGS1 = 1.29 V
The drain-to-source voltage is found from
VDS1 = V + −IQ1RD −(−VGS1)
= 2.5 −(0.2)(8) −(−1.29)
or
VDS1 = 2.19 V
We may note that M1 is indeed biased in the saturation region.
Comment: Since the current mirror transistors M2 and M3 are matched (identical
parameters) and since the gate-to-source voltages are the same in the two transistors,
the bias current, IQ1, is equal to (i.e., mirrors) the reference current, IREF1.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.14: For the circuit shown in Figure 3.49(a), assume circuit parameters of
IREF1 = 120 μA, V + = 3 V, and V −= −3 V; and assume transistor parameters

μA/V2. Determine IQ1 and all gate-to source voltages. (Ans. IQ1 = 60 μA,
VGS1 = 1.495 V, VGS2 = VGS3 = 1.814 V)
We will now consider a current mirror in which the bias current and reference current
are not equal.

We may note that the transistor MA is biased in the saturation region.
Comment: By designing the W/L ratios of the current mirror transistors, we can
obtain different reference current and bias current values.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.15: Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.49(b). Assume circuit parameters
of IREF2 = 0.1 mA, V + = 5 V, and V −= −5 V. The transistor parameters are
the same as given in Example 3.l5. Design the circuit such that IQ2 = 0.2 mA.
Also determine all source-to-gate voltages. (Ans. VSGC = VSGB = 1.18 V,
(W/L)B = 30, VSG A = 1.23 V)
The constant-current source can be implemented by using MOSFETs as shown
in Figure 3.50. The transistors M2, M3, and M4 form the current source. Transistors
M3 and M4 are each connected in a diode-type conﬁguration, and they establish a ref-
erence current. We noted in the last section that this diode-type connection implies
the transistor is always biased in the saturation region. Transistors M3 and M4 are
therefore biased in the saturation region, and M2 is assumed to be biased in the satu-
ration region. The resulting gate-to-source voltage on M3 is applied to M2, and this
establishes the bias current IQ.
Since the reference current is the same in transistors M3 and M4, we can write
Kn3(VGS3 −VT N3)2 = Kn4(VGS4 −VT N4)2

EXAMPLE 3.16
Objective: Determine the currents and voltages in a MOSFET constant-current
source.
For the circuit shown in Figure 3.50, the transistor parameters are: Kn1 =
0.2 mA/V2, Kn2 = Kn3 = Kn4 = 0.1 mA/V2, and VT N1 = VT N2 = VT N3 = VT N4 =
1V.

VGS3 =
	
0.1
0.1[5 −1] + 1
1 +
	
0.1
0.1
= 2.5 V
Since M3 and M4 are identical transistors, VGS3 should be one-half of the bias volt-
age. The bias current IQ is then
IQ = (0.1) · (2.5 −1)2 = 0.225 mA
The gate-to-source voltage on M1 is found from
IQ = Kn1(VGS1 −VT N1)2
or
0.225 = (0.2) · (VGS1 −1)2
which yields
VGS1 = 2.06 V
The drain-to-source voltage on M2 is
VDS2 = (−V −) −VGS1 = 5 −2.06 = 2.94 V
Since VDS2 = 2.94 V > VDS(sat) = VGS2 −VT N2 = 2.5 −1 = 1.5 V, M2 is biased
in the saturation region.
Design Consideration: Since in this example M2 and M3 are identical transistors,
the reference current IREF and bias current IQ are equal. By redesigning the width-to-
length ratios of M2, M3, and M4, we can obtain a speciﬁc bias current IQ. If M2 and

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
175
M3 are not identical, then IQ and IREF will not be equal. A variety of design options
are possible with such a circuit conﬁguration.

MULTISTAGE MOSFET CIRCUITS
Objective: • Consider the dc biasing of multistage or multitransistor
circuits.
In most applications, a single-transistor ampliﬁer will not be able to meet the
combined speciﬁcations of a given ampliﬁcation factor, input resistance, and output
resistance. For example, the required voltage gain may exceed that which can be
obtained in a single-transistor circuit.
Transistor ampliﬁer circuits can be connected in series, or cascaded, as shown
in Figure 3.51. This may be done either to increase the overall small-signal voltage
gain, or provide an overall voltage gain greater than 1, with a very low output resistance.

The overall voltage gain may not simply be the product of the individual ampliﬁca-
tion factors. Loading effects, in general, need to be taken into account.
There are many possible multistage conﬁgurations; we will examine a few here,
in order to understand the type of analysis required.
Multitransistor Circuit: Cascade Conﬁguration
The circuit shown in Figure 3.52 is a cascade of a common-source ampliﬁer followed
by a source-follower ampliﬁer. We will show in the next chapter that the common-
source ampliﬁer provides a small-signal voltage gain and the source-follower has a
low output impedance.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.17
Objective: Design the biasing of a multistage MOSFET circuit to meet speciﬁc
requirements.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.52 with transistor parameters
Kn1 = 500 μA/V2, Kn2 = 200 μA/V2, VT N1 = VT N2 = 1.2 V, and λ1 = λ2 = 0.
Design the circuit such that IDQ1 = 0.2 mA, IDQ2 = 0.5 mA, VDSQ1 = VDSQ2 =
6 V, and Ri = 100 k. Let RSi = 4 k.
Solution: For output transistor M2, we have
VDSQ2 = 5 −(−5) −IDQ2RS2
or
6 = 10 −(0.5)RS2
which yields RS2 = 8 k. Also, assuming transistors are biased in the saturation
region,
IDQ2 = Kn2(KGS2 −VT N2)2
or
0.5 = 0.2(VGS2 −1.2)2

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
177
which yields
VGS2 = 2.78 V
Since VDSQ2 = 6 V, the source voltage of M2 is VS2 = −1 V. With VGS2 =
2.78 V, the gate voltage on M2 must be
VG2 = −1 + 2.78 = 1.78 V
The resistor RD1 is then
RD1 = 5 −1.78
0.2
= 16.1 k
For VDSQ1 = 6 V, the source voltage of M1 is
VS1 = 1.78 −6 = −4.22 V
The resistor RS1 is then
RS1 = −4.22 −(−5)
0.2
= 3.9 k
For transistor M1, we have
IDQ1 = Kn1(VGS1 −VT N1)2
or
0.2 = 0.50(VGS1 −1.2)2
which yields
VGS1 = 1.83 V
To ﬁnd R1 and R2, we can write

then, since the input resistance is speciﬁed to be 100 k, we have

R1
(100)(10) −(0.2)(3.9)
which yields R1 = 383 k. From Ri = 100 k, we ﬁnd that R2 = 135 k.
Comment: Both transistors are biased in the saturation region, as assumed, which is
desired for linear ampliﬁers as we will see in the next chapter.

Figure 3.53 NMOS cascode circuit
DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.18
Objective: Design the biasing of the cascode circuit to meet speciﬁc requirements.
For the circuit shown in Figure 3.53, the transistor parameters are: VT N1 =
VT N2 = 1.2 V, Kn1 = Kn2 = 0.8 mA/V2, and λ1 = λ2 = 0. Let R1 + R2 + R3 =
300 k and RS = 10 k. Design the circuit such that IDQ = 0.4 mA and
VDSQ1 = VDSQ2 = 2.5 V.
Solution: The dc voltage at the source of M1 is
VS1 = IDQ RS −5 = (0.4)(10) −5 = −1 V
Since M1 and M2 are identical transistors, and since the same current exists in the
two transistors, the gate-to-source voltage is the same for both devices. We have
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2
or
0.4 = 0.8(VGS −1.2)2
which yields
VGS = 1.907 V
Then,
VG1 =

or


(5) = 1.907 −1 = 0.907
which yields
R3 = 54.4 k
The voltage at the source of M2 is
VS2 = VDSQ1 + VS1 = 2.5 −1 = 1.5 V
Then,
VG2 =

or

(5) = 1.907 + 1.5 = 3.407 V
which yields
R2 + R3 = 204.4 k
and
R2 = 150 k
Therefore
R1 = 95.6 k
The voltage at the drain of M2 is
VD2 = VDSQ2 + VS2 = 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 V
The drain resistor is therefore
RD = 5 −VD2
IDQ

0.4

Comment: Since VDS = 2.5 V > VGS −VT N = 1.91 −1.2 = 0.71 V, each transis-
tor is biased in the saturation region.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.18: The transistor parameters for the circuit shown in Figure 3.53 are

R2 + R3 = 500 k and RS = 16 k. Design the circuit such that IDQ = 0.25 mA
and VDSQ1 = VDSQ2 = 2.5 V. (Ans. R3 = 50.7 k,
R2 = 250 k,
R1 =
199.3 k, RD = 4 k)
We will encounter many more examples of multitransistor and multistage am-
pliﬁers in later chapters of this text. Speciﬁcally in Chapter 11, we will consider the
differential ampliﬁer and in Chapter 13, we will analyze circuits that form the oper-
ational ampliﬁer.

JUNCTION FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR
Objective: • Understand the operation and characteristics of the pn
junction FET (JFET) and the Schottky barrier junction FET (MESFET),
and understand the dc analysis techniques of JFET and MESFET
circuits.
The two general categories of junction ﬁeld-effect transistor (JFET) are the pn
junction FET, or pn JFET, and the metal-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor
(MESFET), which is fabricated with a Schottky barrier junction.
The current in a JFET is through a semiconductor region known as the channel,
with ohmic contacts at each end. The basic transistor action is the modulation of the
channel conductance by an electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the channel. Since the
modulating electric ﬁeld is induced in the space-charge region of a reverse-biased
pn junction or Schottky barrier junction, the ﬁeld is a function of the gate voltage. Mod-
ulation of the channel conductance by the gate voltage modulates the channel current.
JFETs were developed before MOSFETs, but the applications and uses of the
MOSFET have far surpassed those of the JFET. One reason is that the voltages ap-
plied to the gate and drain of a MOSFET are the same polarity (both positive or both
negative), whereas the voltages applied to the gate and drain of most JFETs must
have opposite polarities. Since the JFET is used only in specialized applications, our
discussion will be brief.
pn JFET and MESFET Operation
pn JFET
A simpliﬁed cross section of a symmetrical pn JFET is shown in Figure 3.54. In the
n-region channel between the two p-regions, majority carrier electrons ﬂow from
the source to the drain terminal; thus, the JFET is called a majority-carrier device.
The two gate terminals shown in Figure 3.54 are connected to form a single gate.
In a p-channel JFET, the p- and n-regions are reversed from those of the n-
channel device, and holes ﬂow in the channel from the source to the drain. The
current direction and voltage polarities in the p-channel JFET are reversed from
3.6.1

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
181
those in the n-channel device. Also, the p-channel JFET is generally a lower-
frequency device than the n-channel JFET, because hole mobility is lower than elec-
tron mobility.
Figure 3.55(a) shows an n-channel JFET with zero volts applied to the gate. If
the source is at ground potential, and if a small positive drain voltage is applied, a
drain current iD is produced between the source and drain terminals. Since the
n-channel acts essentially as a resistance, the iD versus vDS characteristic for small
vDS values is approximately linear, as shown in the ﬁgure.
If a voltage is applied to the gate of a pn JFET, the channel conductance changes.
If a negative gate voltage is applied to the n-channel pn JFET in Figure 3.55, the gate-
to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased. The space-charge region widens, the
channel region narrows, the resistance of the n-channel increases, and the slope of the
iD versus vDS curve, for small vDS, decreases. These effects are shown in Figure 3.55(b).
If a larger negative gate voltage is applied, the condition shown in Figure 3.55(c) can
be achieved. The reverse-biased gate-to-channel space-charge region completely ﬁlls
the channel region. This condition is known as pinchoff. Since the depletion region
isolates the source and drain terminals, the drain current at pinchoff is essentially
zero. The iD versus vDS curves are shown in Figure 3.55(c). The current in the chan-
nel is controlled by the gate voltage. The control of the current in one part of the de-
vice by a voltage in another part of the device is the basic transistor action. The pn
JFET is a “normally on,” or depletion mode, device; that is, a voltage must be applied
to the gate terminal to turn the device off.
Consider the situation in which the gate voltage is zero, vGS = 0, and the drain
voltage changes, as shown in Figure 3.56(a). As the drain voltage increases (posi-
tive), the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased near the drain terminal,
and the space-charge region widens, extending farther into the channel. The channel
acts essentially as a resistor, and the effective channel resistance increases as the
space-charge region widens; therefore, the slope of the iD versus vDS characteristic

decreases, as shown in Figure 3.56(b). The effective channel resistance now varies
along the channel length, and, since the channel current must be constant, the voltage
drop through the channel becomes dependent on position.
If the drain voltage increases further, the condition shown in Figure 3.56(c) can
result. The channel is pinched off at the drain terminal. Any further increase in drain
voltage will not increase the drain current. The iD–vDS characteristic for this condi-
tion is also shown in the ﬁgure. The drain voltage at pinchoff is vDS(sat). Therefore,
for vDS > vDS(sat), the transistor is biased in the saturation region, and the drain cur-
rent for this ideal case is independent of vDS.
MESFET
In the MESFET, the gate junction is a Schottky barrier junction, instead of a pn junc-
tion. Although MESFETs can be fabricated in silicon, they are usually associated
with gallium arsenide or other compound-semiconductor materials.
A simpliﬁed cross section of a GaAs MESFET is shown in Figure 3.57. A thin,
epitaxial layer of GaAs is used for the active region; the substrate is a very high re-
sistivity GaAs material, referred to as a semi-insulating substrate. The advantages of

these devices include: higher electron mobility in GaAs, hence smaller transit time
and faster response; and decreased parasitic capacitance and a simpliﬁed fabrication
process, resulting from the semi-insulating GaAs substrate.
In the MESFET in Figure 3.57, a reverse-bias gate-to-source voltage induces a
space-charge region under the metal gate, which modulates the channel conductance,
as in the case of the pn JFET. If a negative applied gate voltage is sufﬁciently large,
the space-charge region will eventually reach the substrate. Again, pinchoff will
occur. Also, the device shown in the ﬁgure is a depletion mode device, since a gate
voltage must be applied to pinch off the channel, that is, to turn the device off.
In another type of MESFET, the channel is pinched off even at vGS = 0, as
shown in Figure 3.58(a). For this MESFET, the channel thickness is smaller than the
zero-biased space-charge width. To open a channel, the depletion region must be re-
duced; that is, a forward-biased voltage must be applied to the gate–semiconductor
junction. When a slightly forward-bias voltage is applied, the depletion region ex-
tends just to the width of the channel as shown in Figure 3.58(b). The threshold
voltage is the gate-to-source voltage required to create the pinchoff condition.
The threshold voltage for this n-channel MESFET is positive, in contrast to the
negative threshold voltage of the n-channel depletion-mode device. If a larger
forward-bias voltage is applied, the channel region opens, as shown in Figure
3.58(c). The applied forward-bias gate voltage is limited to a few tenths of a volt be-
fore a signiﬁcant gate current occurs.
This device is an n-channel enhancement-mode MESFET. Enhancement-
mode p-channel MESFETs and enhancement-mode pn JFETs have also been fabri-
cated. The advantage of enhancement-mode MESFETs is that circuits can be
designed in which the voltage polarities on the gate and drain are the same. However,
the output voltage swing of these devices is quite small.
Current–Voltage Characteristics
The circuit symbols for the n-channel and p-channel JFETs are shown in Figure 3.59,

The current–voltage characteristics for n-channel and p-channel JFETs are
shown in Figures 3.60(a) and 3.60(b), respectively. Note that the pinchoff voltage VP
for the n-channel JFET is negative and the gate-to-source voltage vGS is usually neg-
ative; therefore, the ratio vGS/VP is positive. Similarly, the pinchoff voltage VP for
the p-channel JFET is positive and the gate-to-source voltage vGS must be positive,
and therefore the ratio vGS/VP is positive.
For the n-channel device, the saturation region occurs when vDS ≥vDS(sat)
where
vDS(sat) = vGS −VP
(3.33)
For the p-channel device, the saturation region occurs when vSD ≥vSD(sat) where

Assume the saturation current is IDSS = 2 mA and the pinchoff voltage is
VP = −3.5 V. Calculate iD and vDS(sat) for vGS = 0, VP/4, and VP/2.

Therefore, for vGS = 0, VP/4, and VP/2, we obtain

From Equation (3.33), we have
vDS(sat) = vGS −VP = vGS −(−3.5)
Therefore, for vGS = 0, VP/4, and VP/2, we obtain
vDS(sat) = 3.5, 2.63, and 1.75 V
Comment: The current capability of a JFET can be increased by increasing the
value of IDSS, which is a function of the transistor width.

ID for VDS > VDS(sat). (Ans. VDS(sat) = 3.3 V, ID = 6.45 mA)
As in the case of the MOSFET, the iD versus vDS characteristic for the JFET
may have a nonzero slope beyond the saturation point. This nonzero slope can be de-

The output resistance will be considered again when we discuss the small-signal
equivalent circuit of the JFET in the next chapter.
Enhancement-mode GaAs MESFETs can be fabricated with current–voltage
characteristics much like those of the enhancement-mode MOSFET. Therefore, for
the ideal enhancement-mode MESFET biased in the saturation region, we can write
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2

For the ideal enhancement-mode MESFET biased in the nonsaturation region,
iD = Kn

where Kn is the conduction parameter and VT N is the threshold voltage, which in this
case is equivalent to the pinchoff voltage. For an n-channel enhancement-mode
MESFET, the threshold voltage is positive.
Common JFET Conﬁgurations: dc Analysis
There are several common JFET circuit conﬁgurations. We will look at a few of
these, using examples, and will illustrate the dc analysis and design of such circuits.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.20
Objective: Design a JFET circuit with a voltage divider biasing circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.61(a) with transistor parameters
IDSS = 12 mA, VP = −3.5 V, and λ = 0. Let R1 + R2 = 100 k. Design the cir-
cuit such that the dc drain current is ID = 5 mA and the dc drain-to-source voltage is
VDS = 5 V.

Therefore,
R2 = 12.6 k
and
R1 = 87.4 k
The drain-to-source voltage is

Therefore,
RD = 10 −VDS −ID RS

We also see that
VDS = 5 V > VGS −VP = −1.24 −(−3.5) = 2.26 V
which shows that the JFET is indeed biased in the saturation region, as initially
assumed.
Comment: The dc analysis of the JFET circuit is essentially the same as that of the
MOSFET circuit, since the gate current is assumed to be zero.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.20: The transistor in the circuit in Figure 3.62 has parameters IDSS = 6 mA,
VP = −4 V, and λ = 0. Design the circuit such that IDQ = 2.5 mA and
VDS = 6 V, and the total power dissipated in R1 and R2 is 2 mW. (Ans.
RD = 1.35 k, R1 = 158 k, R2 = 42 k)
EXAMPLE 3.21
Objective: Calculate the quiescent current and voltage values in a p-channel JFET
circuit.
The parameters of the transistor in the circuit shown in Figure 3.63 are:
IDSS = 2.5 mA, VP = +2.5 V, and λ = 0. The transistor is biased with a constant-
current source.
Solution: From Figure 3.63, we can write the dc drain current as
ID = IQ = 0.8 mA = VD −(−9)
RD
which yields
VD = (0.8)(4) −9 = −5.8 V
Now, assume the transistor is biased in the saturation region. We then have

Then

Again, we see that
VSD = 5.71 V > VP −VGS = 2.5 −1.086 = 1.41 V
which veriﬁes that the transistor is biased in the saturation region, as assumed.
Comment: In the same way as bipolar or MOS transistors, junction ﬁeld-effect tran-
sistors can be biased using constant-current sources.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 3.21: For the p-channel transistor in the circuit in Figure 3.64, the parameters
are: IDSS = 6 mA, VP = 4 V, and λ = 0. Calculate the quiescent values of ID,
VGS, and VSD. Is the transistor biased in the saturation or nonsaturation region?
(Ans. VGS = 1.81 V, ID = 1.81 mA, VSD = 2.47 V, saturation region)
DESIGN EXAMPLE 3.22
Objective: Design a circuit with an enhancement-mode MESFET.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.65(a). The transistor parameters are:
VT N = 0.24 V, Kn = 1.1 mA/V2, and λ = 0. Let R1 + R2 = 50 k. Design the cir-
cuit such that VGS = 0.50 V and VDS = 2.5 V.
Solution: From Equation (3.38(a)) the drain current is
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2 = (1.1)(0.5 −0.24)2 = 74.4 μA
From Figure 3.65(b), the voltage at the drain is
VD = VDD −ID RD = 4 −(0.0744)(6.7) = 3.5 V
Therefore, the voltage at the source is
VS = VD −VDS = 3.5 −2.5 = 1 V
The source resistance is then
RS = VS

or
1.5 =

which yields

and

Again, we see that
VDS = 2.5 V > VGS −VT N = 0.5 −0.24 = 0.26 V
which conﬁrms that the transistor is biased in the saturation region, as initially
assumed.
Comment: The dc analysis and design of an enhancement-mode MESFET circuit is
similar to that of MOSFET circuits, except that the gate-to-source voltage of the
MESFET must be held to no more than a few tenths of a volt.

DESIGN APPLICATION: DIODE THERMOMETER
WITH AN MOS TRANSISTOR
Objective: • Incorporate an MOS transistor in a design application
that enhances the simple diode thermometer design discussed in
Chapter 1.
Speciﬁcations: The electronic thermometer is to operate over a temperature range
of 0 to 100 °F.

Chapter 3 The Field-Effect Transistor
191
Design Approach: The output diode voltage developed in the diode thermometer
in Figure 1.47 is to be applied between the gate–source terminals of an NMOS
transistor to enhance the voltage over the temperature range. The NMOS transistor is
to be held at a constant temperature.
Choices: Assume an n-channel, depletion-mode MOSFET is available with the
parameters k′
n = 80 μA/V2, W/L = 10, and VT N = −1 V.
Solution: From the design in Chapter 1, the diode voltage is given by
VD = 1.12 −0.522
 T


where T is in kelvins.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.69. We assume that the diode is in a
variable temperature environment while the rest of the circuit is held at room
temperature.
From the circuit, we see that VGS = VD, where VD is the diode voltage and not
the drain voltage. We want the MOSFET biased in the saturation region, so
ID = Kn (VGS −VT N)2 = k′

We ﬁnd the output voltage as

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Comment: Figure 3.70(a) shows the diode voltage versus temperature and
Figure 3.70(b) now shows the output voltage versus temperature from the MOSFET
circuit. We can see that the transistor circuit provides a voltage gain. This voltage
gain is the desired characteristic of the transistor circuit.
Discussion: We can see from the equations that the diode current and output voltage
are not linear functions of the diode voltage. This effect implies that the transistor
output voltage is also not a linear function of temperature. We will see a better circuit
design using operational ampliﬁers in Chapter 9.
We can note from the results that VO = VDS > VDS(sat) in all cases, so the tran-
sistor is biased in the saturation region as desired.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, we have considered the physical structure and dc electrical charac-
teristics of the MOSFET.
•
The current in the MOSFET is controlled by the gate voltage. In the nonsatura-
tion bias region of operation, the drain current is also a function of drain voltage,
whereas in the saturation bias region of operation the drain current is essentially
independent of the drain voltage. The drain current is directly proportional to the
width-to-length ratio of the transistor, so this parameter becomes the primary de-
sign variable in MOSFET circuit design.
•
The dc analysis and design techniques of MOSFET circuits were emphasized in
this chapter. The use of MOSFETs in place of resistors was investigated. This
leads to the design of all-MOSFET circuits.
•
Basic applications of the MOSFET include switching currents and voltages, per-
forming digital logic functions, and amplifying time-varying signals. The am-
plifying characteristics will be considered in the next chapter and the digital ap-
plications will be considered in Chapter 16.
•
MOSFET circuits that provide constant-current biasing to other MOSFET cir-
cuits were analyzed and designed. This current biasing technique is used in inte-
grated circuits.

Chapter
In Chapter 3, we described the structure and operation of the FET, in particular the
MOSFET, and analyzed and designed the dc response of circuits containing these
devices. In this chapter, we emphasize the use of the FETs in linear ampliﬁer appli-
cations. Linear ampliﬁers imply that, for the most part, we are dealing with analog
signals. The magnitude of an analog signal may have any value, within limits, and
may vary continuously with respect to time. Although a major use of MOSFETs is in
digital applications, they are also used in linear ampliﬁer circuits. 
We will begin to see how all-transistor circuits, that is, circuits with no resistors,
can be designed. Since MOS transistors are small devices, high-density all-transistor
circuits can be fabricated as integrated circuits.

THE MOSFET AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Investigate the process by which a single-transistor
circuit can amplify a small, time-varying input signal and develop the
small-signal models of the transistor that are used in the analysis of
linear ampliﬁers.
In this chapter, we will be considering signals, analog circuits, and ampliﬁers. A
signal contains some type of information. For example, sound waves produced by a
speaking human contain the information the person is conveying to another person.
A sound wave is an analog signal. The magnitude of an analog signal can take on
any value, within limits, and may vary continuously with time. Electronic circuits
that process analog signals are called analog circuits. One example of an analog cir-
cuit is a linear ampliﬁer. A linear ampliﬁer magniﬁes an input signal and produces
an output signal whose magnitude is larger and directly proportional to the input
signal.
In this chapter, we analyze and design linear ampliﬁers that use ﬁeld-effect tran-
sistors as the amplifying device. The term small signal means that we can linearize
the ac equivalent circuit. We will deﬁne what is meant by small signal in the case of
MOSFET circuits. The term linear ampliﬁers means that we can use superposition so
that the dc analysis and ac analysis of the circuits can be performed separately and
the total response is the sum of the two individual responses.
The mechanism with which MOSFET circuits amplify small time-varying
signals was introduced in the last chapter. In this section, we will expand that
discussion using the graphical technique, dc load line, and ac load line. In the
process, we will develop the various small-signal parameters of linear circuits and
the corresponding equivalent circuits.
Graphical Analysis, Load Lines, 
and Small-Signal Parameters
Figure 4.1 shows an NMOS common-source circuit with a time-varying voltage
source in series with the dc source. We assume the time-varying input signal is sinu-
soidal. Figure 4.2 shows the transistor characteristics, dc load line, and Q-point,
where the dc load line and Q-point are functions of vGS, VDD, RD, and the transistor
parameters. For the output voltage to be a linear function of the input voltage, the
transistor must be biased in the saturation region. (Note that, although we primarily
use n-channel, enhancement-mode MOSFETs in our discussions, the same results
apply to the other MOSFETs.)
Also shown in Figure 4.2 are the sinusoidal variations in the gate-to-source volt-
age, drain current, and drain-to-source voltage, as a result of the sinusoidal source vi.
The total gate-to-source voltage is the sum of VGSQ and vi. As vi increases, the
instantaneous value of vGS increases, and the bias point moves up the load line. A
larger value of vGS means a larger drain current and a smaller value of vDS. For a
negative vi (the negative portion of the sine wave), the instantaneous value of vGS
decreases below the quiescent value, and the bias point moves down the load line. A
smaller vGS value means a smaller drain current and increased value of vDS. Once the

Figure 4.2 Common-source transistor characteristics, dc load line, and sinusoidal variation
in gate-to-source voltage, drain current, and drain-to-source voltage
Q-point is established, we can develop a mathematical model for the sinusoidal, or
small-signal, variations in gate-to-source voltage, drain-to-source voltage, and drain
current.
The time-varying signal source vi in Figure 4.1 generates a time-varying
component of the gate-to-source voltage. In this case, vgs = vi, where vgs is the time-
varying component of the gate-to-source voltage. For the FET to operate as a linear
ampliﬁer, the transistor must be biased in the saturation region, and the instantaneous
drain current and drain-to-source voltage must also be conﬁned to the saturation
region.
When symmetrical sinusoidal signals are applied to the input of an ampliﬁer,
symmetrical sinusoidal signals are generated at the output, as long as the ampliﬁer
operation remains linear. We can use the load line to determine the maximum output
symmetrical swing. If the output exceeds this limit, a portion of the output signal will
be clipped and signal distortion will occur.
In the case of FET ampliﬁers, the output signal must avoid cutoff (iD = 0) and
must stay in the saturation region (vDS > vDS(sat)). This maximum range of output
signal can be determined from the load line in Figure 4.2.
Transistor Parameters
We will be dealing with time-varying as well as dc currents and voltages in this
chapter. Table 4.1 gives a summary of notation that will be used. This notation was

discussed in the Prologue, but is repeated here for convenience. A lowercase letter
with an upper case subscript, such as iD or vGS, indicates a total instantaneous value.
An uppercase letter with an uppercase subscript, such as ID or VGS, indicates a dc
quantity. A lowercase letter with a lowercase subscript, such as id and vgs, indicates
an instantaneous value of an ac signal. Finally, an uppercase letter with a lowercase
subscript, such as Id or Vgs, indicates a phasor quantity. The phasor notation, which
is also reviewed in the Prologue, becomes especially important in Chapter 7 during
the discussion of frequency response. However, the phasor notation will generally be
used in this chapter in order to be consistent with the overall ac analysis.
From Figure 4.1, we see that the instantaneous gate-to-source voltage is
vGS = VGSQ + vi = VGSQ + vgs
(4.1)
where VGSQ is the dc component and vgs is the ac component. The instantaneous
drain current is
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2
(4.2)
Substituting Equation (4.1) into (4.2) produces
iD = Kn[VGSQ + vgs −VT N]2 = Kn[(VGSQ −VT N) + vgs]2
(4.3(a))
or
iD = Kn(VGSQ −VT N)2 + 2Kn(VGSQ −VT N)vgs + Knv2
gs
(4.3(b))
The ﬁrst term in Equation (4.3(b)) is the dc or quiescent drain current IDQ, the
second term is the time-varying drain current component that is linearly related to the
signal vgs, and the third term is proportional to the square of the signal voltage. For
a sinusoidal input signal, the squared term produces undesirable harmonics, or non-
linear distortion, in the output voltage. To minimize these harmonics, we require
vgs ≪2(VGSQ −VT N)
(4.4)
which means that the third term in Equation (4.3(b)) will be much smaller than the
second term. Equation (4.4) represents the small-signal condition that must be satis-
ﬁed for linear ampliﬁers.
Neglecting the v2
gs term, we can write Equation (4.3(b)) as
iD = IDQ + id
(4.5)
Again, small-signal implies linearity so that the total current can be separated into
a dc component and an ac component. The ac component of the drain current is
given by
id = 2Kn(VGSQ −VT N)vgs
(4.6)
The small-signal drain current is related to the small-signal gate-to-source volt-
age by the transconductance gm. The relationship is
gm = id
vgs
= 2Kn(VGSQ −VT N)
(4.7)
The transconductance is a transfer coefﬁcient relating output current to input voltage
and can be thought of as representing the gain of the transistor.
The transconductance can also be obtained from the derivative

which can be written as


Kn IDQ
(4.8(b))
The drain current versus gate-to-source voltage for the transistor biased in the
saturation region is given in Equation (4.2) and is shown in Figure 4.3. The transcon-
ductance gm is the slope of the curve. If the time-varying signal vgs is sufﬁciently
small, the transconductance gm is a constant. With the Q-point in the saturation
region, the transistor operates as a current source that is linearly controlled by vgs. If
the Q-point moves into the nonsaturation region, the transistor no longer operates as
a linearly controlled current source.
As shown in Equation (4.8(a)), the transconductance is directly proportional to
the conduction parameter Kn, which in turn is a function of the width-to-length ratio.
Therefore, increasing the width of the transistor increases the transconductance, or
gain, of the transistor.

Comment: The value of the transconductance can be increased by increasing the

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 4.1: For an n-channel MOSFET biased in the saturation region, the parameters
are k′
n = 100 μA/V2, VT N = 0.6 V, and IDQ = 0.8 mA. Determine the transistor
width-to-length ratio such that the transconductance is gm = 1.8 mA/V. (Ans. 20.25)
AC Equivalent Circuit
From Figure 4.l, we see that the output voltage is
vDS = vO = VDD −iD RD
(4.9)
Using Equation (4.5), we obtain
vO = VDD −(IDQ + id)RD = (VDD −IDQ RD) −id RD
(4.10)
The output voltage is also a combination of dc and ac values. The time-varying
output signal is the time-varying drain-to-source voltage, or
vo = vds = −id RD
(4.11)
Also, from Equations (4.6) and (4.7), we have
id = gmvgs
(4.12)
In summary, the following relationships exist between the time-varying signals
for the circuit in Figure 4.1. The equations are given in terms of the instantaneous
ac values, as well as the phasors. We have
vgs = vi
or
Vgs = Vi
(4.13)
and
id = gmvgs
or
Id = gmVgs
(4.14)
and
vds = −id RD
or
Vds = −Id RD
(4.15)
The ac equivalent circuit in Figure 4.4 is developed by setting the dc sources in
Figure 4.l equal to zero. The small-signal relationships are given in Equations (4.13),
(4.14), and (4.15). As shown in Figure 4.l, the drain current, which is composed of ac
signals superimposed on the quiescent value, ﬂows through the voltage source VDD.
Since the voltage across this source is assumed to be constant, the sinusoidal current
produces no sinusoidal voltage component across this element. The equivalent ac
impedance is therefore zero, or a short circuit. Consequently, in the ac equivalent
circuit, the dc voltage sources are equal to zero. We say that the node connecting RD
and VDD is at signal ground.
Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit
Now that we have the ac equivalent circuit for the NMOS ampliﬁer circuit, (Figure
4.4), we must develop a small-signal equivalent circuit for the transistor.
Initially, we assume that the signal frequency is sufﬁciently low so that any
capacitance at the gate terminal can be neglected. The input to the gate thus appears
as an open circuit, or an inﬁnite resistance. Equation (4.14) relates the small-signal

Figure 4.5 (a) Common-source NMOS transistor with small-signal parameters and
(b) simpliﬁed small-signal equivalent circuit for NMOS transistor
drain current to the small-signal input voltage, and Equation (4.7) shows that the
transconductance gm is a function of the Q-point. The resulting simpliﬁed small-
signal equivalent circuit for the NMOS device is shown in Figure 4.5. (The phasor
components are in parentheses.)
This small-signal equivalent circuit can also be expanded to take into account the
ﬁnite output resistance of a MOSFET biased in the saturation region. This effect, dis-
cussed in the last chapter, is a result of the nonzero slope in the iD versus vDS curve.
We know that
iD = Kn[(vGS −VT N)2(1 + λvDS)]
(4.16)
where λ is the channel-length modulation parameter and is a positive quantity. The
small-signal output resistance, as previously deﬁned, is

or

(4.18)
This small-signal output resistance is also a function of the Q-point parameters.
The expanded small-signal equivalent circuit of the n-channel MOSFET is
shown in Figure 4.6 in phasor notation. Note that this equivalent circuit is a transcon-
ductance ampliﬁer in that the input signal is a voltage and the output signal is a
current. This equivalent circuit can now be inserted into the ampliﬁer ac equivalent
circuit in Figure 4.4 to produce the circuit in Figure 4.7.

EXAMPLE 4.2
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of a MOSFET circuit.
For the circuit in Figure 4.l, assume parameters are: VGSQ = 2.12 V, VDD = 5 V,
and RD = 2.5 k. Assume transistor parameters are: VT N = 1 V. Kn = 0.80
mA/V2, and λ = 0.02 V−1. Assume the transistor is biased in the saturation region.

212
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Solution: The quiescent values are
IDQ ∼= Kn(VGSQ −VT N)2 = (0.8)(2.12 −1)2 = 1.0 mA
and
VDSQ = VDD −IDQ RD = 5 −(1)(2.5) = 2.5 V
Therefore,
VDSQ = 2.5 V > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N = 1.82 −1 = 0.82 V
which means that the transistor is biased in the saturation region, as initially
assumed, and as required for a linear ampliﬁer. The transconductance is
gm = 2Kn(VGSQ −VT N) = 2(0.8)(2.12 −1) = 1.79 mA/V
and the output resistance is
ro = [λIDQ]−1 = [(0.02)(1)]−1 = 50 k
From Figure 4.7, the output voltage is
Vo = −gmVgs(ro∥RD)
Since Vgs = Vi, the small-signal voltage gain is
Av = Vo
Vi
= −gm(ro∥Rd) = −(1.79)(50∥2.5) = −4.26
Comment: The magnitude of the ac output voltage is 4.26 times larger than the mag-
nitude of the input voltage. Hence, we have an ampliﬁer. Note that the small-signal
voltage gain contains a minus sign, which means that the sinusoidal output voltage is
180 degrees out of phase with respect to the input sinusoidal signal.

Ex 4.2: For the circuit shown in Figure 4.1, VDD = 3.3 V and RD = 10 k. The
transistor parameters are VT N = 0.4 V, k′

λ = 0.025 V−1. Assume the transistor is biased such that IDQ = 0.25 mA. (a) Verify
that the transistor is biased in the saturation region. (b) Determine the small-
signal parameters gm and ro. (c) Determine the small-signal voltage gain.
(Ans. (a) VGSQ = 0.716 V and VDSQ = 0.8 V so that VDS > VDS (sat);
(b) gm = 1.58 mA/V, ro = 160 k; (c) −14.9)
Problem-Solving Technique: MOSFET AC Analysis
Since we are dealing with linear ampliﬁers, superposition applies, which means
that we can perform the dc and ac analyses separately. The analysis of the MOSFET
ampliﬁer proceeds as follows:
1.
Analyze the circuit with only the dc sources present. This solution is the dc or
quiescent solution. The transistor must be biased in the saturation region in
order to produce a linear ampliﬁer.
2.
Replace each element in the circuit with its small-signal model, which means
replacing the transistor by its small-signal equivalent circuit.
3.
Analyze the small-signal equivalent circuit, setting the dc source components
equal to zero, to produce the response of the circuit to the time-varying input
signals only.

Figure 4.8 (a) Common-source circuit with PMOS
transistor and (b) corresponding ac equivalent circuit
The previous discussion was for an n-channel MOSFET ampliﬁer. The same basic
analysis and equivalent circuit also applies to the p-channel transistor. Figure 4.8(a)
shows a circuit containing a p-channel MOSFET. Note that the power supply voltage
VDD is connected to the source. (The subscript DD can be used to indicate that the
supply is connected to the drain terminal. Here, however, VDD is simply the usual
notation for the power supply voltage in MOSFET circuits.) Also note the change in
current directions and voltage polarities compared to the circuit containing the
NMOS transistor. Figure 4.8(b) shows the ac equivalent circuit, with the dc voltage
sources replaced by ac short circuits, and all currents and voltages shown are the time-
varying components.
In the circuit of Figure 4.8(b), the transistor can be replaced by the equivalent
circuit in Figure 4.9. The equivalent circuit of the p-channel MOSFET is the same as
that of the n-channel device, except that all current directions and voltage polarities
are reversed.
The ﬁnal small-signal equivalent circuit of the p-channel MOSFET ampliﬁer is
shown in Figure 4.10. The output voltage is
Vo = gmVsg(ro∥RD)

The control voltage Vsg, given in terms of the input signal voltage, is

This expression for the small-signal voltage gain of the p-channel MOSFET
ampliﬁer is exactly the same as that for the n-channel MOSFET ampliﬁer. The
negative sign indicates that a 180-degree phase reversal exists between the ouput and
input signals, for both the PMOS and the NMOS circuit.
We may note that if the polarity of the small-signal gate-to-source voltage is
reversed, then the small-signal drain current direction is reversed. This change of po-
larity is shown in Figure 4.11. Figure 4.11(a) shows the conventional voltage polar-
ity and current directions in a PMOS transistor. If the control voltage polarity is re-
versed as shown in Figure 4.11(b), then the dependent current direction is also
reversed. The equivalent circuit shown in Figure 4.11(b) is then the same as that of
the NMOS transistor. However, the author prefers to use the small-signal equivalent
circuit in Figure 4.9 to be consistent with the voltage polarities and current directions
of the PMOS transistor.
Modeling the Body Effect
As mentioned in Section 3.1.9, Chapter 3, the body effect occurs in a MOSFET in
which the substrate, or body, is not directly connected to the source. For an NMOS
device, the body is connected to the most negative potential in the circuit and will be
at signal ground. Figure 4.12(a) shows the four-terminal MOSFET with dc voltages
and Figure 4.12(b) shows the device with ac voltages. Keep in mind that vSB must be
greater than or equal to zero. The simpliﬁed current-voltage relation is

If an ac component exists in the source-to-body voltage, vSB, there will be an ac
component induced in the threshold voltage, which causes an ac component in the

Including the body effect, the small-signal equivalent circuit of the MOSFET is
shown in Figure 4.13. We note the direction of the current and the polarity of the
small-signal source-to-body voltage. If vbs > 0, then vSB decreases, VT N decreases,
and iD increases. The current direction and voltage polarity are thus consistent.
For φf = 0.35 V and γ = 0.35 V1/2, the value of η from Equation (4.25(b)) is
η ∼= 0.23. Therefore, η will be in the range 0 ≤η ≤0.23. The value of vbs will
depend on the particular circuit.
In general, we will neglect gmb in our hand analyses and designs, but will inves-
tigate the body effect in PSpice analyses.

BASIC TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER
CONFIGURATIONS
Objective: • Discuss the three basic transistor ampliﬁer conﬁgurations.
As we have seen, the MOSFET is a three-terminal device. Three basic single-
transistor ampliﬁer conﬁgurations can be formed, depending on which of the three
transistor terminals is used as signal ground. These three basic conﬁgurations are
appropriately called common source, common drain (source follower), and
common gate.
The input and output resistance characteristics of ampliﬁers are important in
determining loading effects. These parameters, as well as voltage gain, for the three
basic MOSFET circuit conﬁgurations will be determined in the following sections.
The characteristics of the three types of ampliﬁers will then allow us to understand
under what condition each ampliﬁer is most useful.
Initially, we will consider MOSFET ampliﬁer circuits that emphasize discrete
designs, in that resistor biasing will be used. The purpose is to become familiar
with basic MOSFET ampliﬁer designs and their characteristics. In Section 4.7, we
will begin to consider integrated circuit MOSFET designs that involve all-transis-
tor circuits and current source biasing. These initial designs provide an introduc-
tion to more advanced MOS ampliﬁer designs that will be considered in Part 2 of
the text.
4.3
THE COMMON-SOURCE AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Analyze the common-source ampliﬁer and become
familiar with the general characteristics of this circuit.
In this section, we consider the ﬁrst of the three basic circuits—the common-source
ampliﬁer. We will analyze several basic common-source circuits, and will determine
small-signal voltage gain and input and output impedances.

A Basic Common-Source Conﬁguration
Figure 4.14 shows the basic common-source circuit with voltage-divider biasing. We
see that the source is at ground potential—hence the name common source. The sig-
nal from the signal source is coupled into the gate of the transistor through the cou-
pling capacitor CC, which provides dc isolation between the ampliﬁer and the signal
source. The dc transistor biasing is established by R1 and R2, and is not disturbed
when the signal source is capacitively coupled to the ampliﬁer.

Figure 4.15 Small-signal equivalent circuit, assuming coupling capacitor acts as a short circuit
If the signal source is a sinusoidal voltage at frequency f, then the magnitude
of the capacitor impedance is |ZC| = [1/(2π f CC)]. For example, assume that
CC = 10 μF and f = 2 kHz. The magnitude of the capacitor impedance is then 
|ZC| =
1
2π f CC
=
1
2π(2 × 103)(10 × 10−6)
∼= 8 
The magnitude of this impedance is generally much less than the Thevenin resistance
at the capacitor terminals. We can therefore assume that the capacitor is essentially a
short circuit to signals with frequencies greater than 2 kHz. We will also neglect, in
this chapter, any capacitance effects within the transistor.
For the circuit shown in Figure 4.14, assume that the transistor is biased in the sat-
uration region by resistors R1 and R2, and that the signal frequency is sufﬁciently large
for the coupling capacitor to act essentially as a short circuit. The signal source is rep-
resented by a Thevenin equivalent circuit, in which the signal voltage source vi is in
series with an equivalent source resistance RSi. As we will see, RSi should be much less
than the ampliﬁer input resistance, Ri = R1∥R2, in order to minimize loading effects.
Figure 4.15 shows the resulting small-signal equivalent circuit. The small-
signal variables, such as the input signal voltage Vi, are given in phasor form.

We can also relate the ac drain current to the ac drain-to-source voltage, as
Vds = −Id(RD).
Figure 4.16 shows the dc load line, the transition point (that separates the satura-
tion bias region and nonsaturation bias region), and the Q-point, which is in the
saturation region. In order to provide the maximum symmetrical output voltage swing
and keep the transistor biased in the saturation region, the Q-point must be near the
middle of the saturation region. At the same time, the input signal must be small
enough for the ampliﬁer to remain linear.
The input and output resistances of the ampliﬁer can be determined from Fig-
ure 4.15. The input resistance to the ampliﬁer is Ri = R1∥R2. Since the low-frequency
input resistance looking into the gate of the MOSFET is essentially inﬁnite, the input
resistance is only a function of the bias resistors. The output resistance looking back
into the output terminals is found by setting the independent input source Vi equal to
zero, which means that Vgs = 0. The output resistance is therefore Ro = RD∥ro.

Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain and input and output resistances
of a common-source ampliﬁer.

We can now calculate VDS(sat) at the transition point. The subscript t indicates

IDt = 4 = Kn(VGSt −VT N)2 = 1(VGSt −1)2
which yields
VGSt = 3 V
Therefore
VDSt = VGSt −VT N = 3 −1 = 2 V
If the Q-point is in the middle of the saturation region, then VDSQ = 7 V, which
would yield a 10 V peak-to-peak symmetrical output voltage. From Figure 4.17, we

resistor is included in the circuit. However, as shown in the following example, a
source resistor also reduces the signal gain.
The circuit in Figure 4.19 is an example of a situation in which the body effect
should be taken into account. The substrate (not shown) would normally be
connected to the −5 V supply, so that the body and substrate terminals are not at the
same potential. However, in the following example, we will neglect this effect.
The circuit shown in Figure 4.20(a) is a PMOS version of the common-source
ampliﬁer with a source resistor RS included.
EXAMPLE 4.5
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of a PMOS transistor circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 4.20(a). The transistor parameters are
Kp = 0.80 mA/V2, VT P = −0.5 V, and λ = 0. The quiescent drain current is found
to be IDQ = 0.297 mA.
The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4.20(b). To sketch the
small-signal equivalent circuit, start with the three terminals of the transistor, draw in
the transistor equivalent circuit between these three terminals, and then sketch in the
other circuit elements around the transistor.
Solution: The small-signal output voltage is
Vo = +gmVsg RD
Writing a KVL equation from the input around the gate–source loop, we ﬁnd
Vi = −Vsg −gmVsg RS

Comment: The analysis of a PMOS transistor circuit is essentially the same as that
of an NMOS transistor circuit. The voltage gain of a MOS transistor circuit that con-
tains a source resistor is degraded compared to a circuit without a source resistor.
However, the Q-point tends to be stabilized.
Discussion: We mentioned that including a source resistor tends to stabilize the
circuit characteristics against any changes in transistor parameters. If, for exam-
ple, the conduction parameter Kp varies by ±10 percent, we find the following
results.

Common-Source Circuit 
with Source Bypass Capacitor
A source bypass capacitor added to the common-source circuit with a source resistor
will minimize the loss in the small-signal voltage gain, while maintaining the Q-
point stability. The Q-point stability can be further increased by replacing the source
resistor with a constant-current source. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 4.21,
assuming an ideal signal source. If the signal frequency is sufﬁciently large so that
the bypass capacitor acts essentially as an ac short-circuit, the source will be held at
signal ground.
EXAMPLE 4.6
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of a circuit biased with a constant-
current source and incorporating a source bypass capacitor.

Chapter 4 Basic FET Ampliﬁers
225
For the circuit shown in Figure 4.21, the transistor parameters are: VT N = 0.8 V,
Kn = 1 mA/V2, and λ = 0.
Solution: Since the dc gate current is zero, the dc voltage at the source terminal is
VS = −VGSQ, and the gate-to-source voltage is determined from
IDQ = IQ = Kn(VGSQ −VT N)2
or
0.5 = (1)(VGSQ −0.8)2
which yields
VGSQ = −VS = 1.51 V
The quiescent drain-to-source voltage is
VDSQ = VDD −IDQ RD −VS = 5 −(0.5)(7) −(−1.51) = 3.01 V
The transistor is therefore biased in the saturation region.

a source bypass capacitor is included.

The second type of MOSFET ampliﬁer to be considered is the common-drain

the ﬁgure, the output signal is taken off the source with respect to ground and the drain
is connected directly to VDD. Since VDD becomes signal ground in the ac equivalent
circuit, we have the name common drain. The more common name is source follower.
The reason for this name will become apparent as we proceed through the analysis.

Small-Signal Voltage Gain
The dc analysis of the circuit is exactly the same as we have already seen, so we will
concentrate on the small-signal analysis. The small-signal equivalent circuit, assum-
ing the coupling capacitor acts as a short circuit, is shown in Figure 4.27(a). The

circuit, but with all signal grounds at a common point. We are again neglecting the
body effect. The output voltage is
Vo = (gmVgs)(RS∥ro)
(4.30)
Writing a KVL equation from input to output results in the following:
Vin = Vgs + Vo = Vgs + gmVgs(RS∥ro)

Equation (4.31(b)) is written in the form of a voltage-divider equation, in which
the gate-to-source of the NMOS device looks like a resistance with a value of 1/gm.
More accurately, the effective resistance looking into the source terminal (ignoring

small-signal transconductance is therefore
gm = 2Kn(VGSQ −VT N) = 2(4)(2.91 −1.5) = 11.3 mA/V
and the small-signal transistor resistance is
ro ∼= [λIDQ]−1 = [(0.01)(7.97)]−1 = 12.5 k
The ampliﬁer input resistance is
Ri = R1 ∥R2 = 162 ∥463 = 120 k

Comment: The magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain is less than 1. An exam-
ination of Equation (4.33(b)) shows that this is always true. Also, the voltage gain is
positive, which means that the output signal voltage is in phase with the input signal
voltage. Since the output signal is essentially equal to the input signal, the circuit is
called a source follower.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 4.7: The source-follower circuit in Figure 4.26 has transistor parameters
VT N = +0.8 V, Kn = 1 mA/V2, and λ = 0.015 V−1. Let VDD = 10 V, RSi =
200 , and R1 + R2 = 400 k. Design the circuit such that IDQ = 1.5 mA and
VDSQ = 5 V. Determine the small-signal voltage gain. (Ans. RS = 3.33 k,
R1 = 119 k, R2 = 281, k, Av = 0.884)
Although the voltage gain is slightly less than 1, the source follower is an
extremely useful circuit because the output resistance is less than that of a common-
source circuit, as we will show in the next section. A small output resistance is
desirable when the circuit is to act as an ideal voltage source and drive a load circuit
without suffering any loading effects.

nal voltage gain is Av = 0.90.
Choices: A transistor with nominal parameters VT P = −2 V, k′

and λ = 0 is available. 
Solution (dc analysis): From a KVL equation around the source-to-drain loop, we have
VDD = VSDQ + IDQ RS
or
20 = 10 + (2.5)RS
which yields the required source resistor to be RS = 4 k.
Solution (ac design): The small-signal voltage gain of this circuit is the same as that
of a source follower with an NMOS device. From Equation (4.33(a)), we have

We have

or
2.5 = 0.784(VSGQ −2)2
which yields a quiescent source-to-gate voltage of VSGQ = 3.79 V. The quiescent

value of input resistance Ri has minimized the effect of loading due to the output

Input and Output Impedance
The small-signal input resistance Ri as deﬁned in Figure 4.27(b), for example, is the
Thevenin equivalent resistance of the bias resistors. Even though the input resistance
to the gate of the MOSFET is essentially inﬁnite, the input bias resistances do
provide a loading effect. This same effect was seen in the common-source circuits.
4.4.2

232
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
To calculate the small-signal output resistance, we set all independent small-
signal sources equal to zero, apply a test voltage to the output terminals, and measure
a test current. Figure 4.30 shows the circuit we will use to determine the output
resistance of the source follower shown in Figure 4.26. We set Vi = 0 and apply a test
voltage Vx. Since there are no capacitances in the circuit, the output impedance is
simply an output resistance, which is deﬁned as
Ro = Vx
Ix
(4.34)
Writing a KCL equation at the output source terminal produces
Ix + gmVgs = Vx
RS
+ Vx
ro
(4.35)
Since there is no current in the input portion of the circuit, we see that Vgs = −Vx.
Therefore, Equation (4.35) becomes

From Figure 4.30, we see that the voltage Vgs is directly across the current
source gmVgs. This means that the effective resistance of the device is 1/gm. The out-
put resistance given by Equation (4.37) can therefore be written directly. This result
also means that the resistance looking into the source terminal (ignoring ro) is 1/gm,
as previously noted.

Solution: The results of Example 4.7 are: RS = 0.75 k, ro = 12.5 k, and

Comment: The output resistance of a source-follower circuit is dominated by the
transconductance parameter. Also, because the output resistance is very low,
the source follower tends to act like an ideal voltage source, which means that the
output can drive another circuit without signiﬁcant loading effects.

THE COMMON-GATE CONFIGURATION
Objective: • Analyze the common-gate ampliﬁer and become
familiar with the general characteristics of this circuit.
The third ampliﬁer conﬁguration is the common-gate circuit. To determine the
small-signal voltage and current gains, and the input and output impedances, we will
use the same small-signal equivalent circuit for the transistor that was used previ-
ously. The dc analysis of the common-gate circuit is the same as that of previous
MOSFET circuits.
Small-Signal Voltage and Current Gains
In the common-gate conﬁguration, the input signal is applied to the source terminal
and the gate is at signal ground. The common-gate conﬁguration shown in
Figure 4.32 is biased with a constant-current source IQ. The gate resistor RG prevents
the buildup of static charge on the gate terminal, and the capacitor CG ensures that the
gate is at signal ground. The coupling capacitor CC1 couples the signal to the source,
and coupling capacitor CC2 couples the output voltage to load resistance RL.

Figure 4.33 Small-signal equivalent circuit of common-gate ampliﬁer
The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4.33. The small-signal
transistor resistance ro is assumed to be inﬁnite. Since the source is the input termi-
nal, the small-signal equivalent circuit shown in Figure 4.33 may appear to be
different from those considered previously. However, to sketch the equivalent circuit,
we can use the same technique as used previously. Sketch in the three terminals of the

transistor with the source at the input for this case. Then draw in the transistor equiv-
alent circuit between the three terminals and then sketch in the remaining circuit el-
ements around the transistor.
The output voltage is
Vo = −(gmVgs)(RD∥RL)
(4.38)
Writing the KVL equation around the input, we ﬁnd
Vi = Ii RSi −Vgs
(4.39)
where Ii = −gmVgs. The gate-to-source voltage can then be written as
Vgs =
−Vi
1 + gm RSi
(4.40)
The small-signal voltage gain is found to be
Av = Vo
Vi
= gm(RD∥RL)
1 + gm RSi
(4.41)
Also, since the voltage gain is positive, the output and input signals are in phase.
In many cases, the signal input to a common-gate circuit is a current. Figure 4.34
shows the small-signal equivalent common-gate circuit with a Norton equivalent
circuit as the signal source. We can calculate a current gain. The output current Io can
be written

Input and Output Impedance
In contrast to the common-source and source-follower ampliﬁers, the common-gate
circuit has a low input resistance because of the transistor. However, if the input
signal is a current, a low input resistance is an advantage. The input resistance is
deﬁned, using Figure 4.33, as
Ri = −Vgs
Ii
(4.46)
Since Ii = −gmVgs, the input resistance is
Ri = 1

(4.47)
This result has been obtained previously.
We can ﬁnd the output resistance by setting the input signal voltage equal to
zero. From Figure 4.33, we see that Vgs = −gmVgs RSi , which means that Vgs = 0.
Consequently, gmVgs = 0. The output resistance, looking back from the load resis-
tance, is therefore
Ro = RD
(4.48)

EXAMPLE 4.10
Objective: For the common-gate circuit, determine the output voltage for a given
input current.
For the circuits shown in Figures 4.32 and 4.34, the circuit parameters are:
IQ = 1 mA, V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V, RG = 100 k, RD = 4 k, and RL = 10 k.
The transistor parameters are: VT N = 1 V, Kn = 1 mA/V2, and λ = 0. Assume the
input current in Figure 4.34 is 100 sin ωt μA and assume RSi = 50 k.
Solution: The quiescent gate-to-source voltage is determined from
IQ = IDQ = Kn(VGSQ −VT N)2
or
1 = 1(VGSQ −1)2
which yields
VGSQ = 2 V
The small-signal transconductance is
gm = 2Kn(VGSQ −VT N) = 2(1)(2 −1) = 2 mA/V

THE THREE BASIC 
AMPLIFIER CONFIGURATIONS: 
SUMMARY AND COMPARISON
Objective: • Compare the general characteristics of the three basic
ampliﬁer conﬁgurations.

238
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Table 4.2 is a summary of the small-signal characteristics of the three ampliﬁer
conﬁgurations.
The common-source ampliﬁer voltage gain magnitude is generally greater than 1.
The voltage gain of the source follower is slightly less than 1, and that of the
common-gate circuit is generally greater than 1.
The input resistance looking directly into the gate of the common-source and
source-follower circuits is essentially inﬁnite at low to moderate signal frequencies.
However, the input resistance of these discrete ampliﬁers is the Thevenin equivalent
resistance RTH of the bias resistors. In contrast, the input resistance to the common-
gate circuit is generally in the range of only a few hundred ohms.
The output resistance of the source follower is generally in the range of a few
hundred ohms or less. The output resistance of the common-source and common-
gate conﬁgurations is dominated by the resistance RD. In Chapters 10 and 11, we will
see that the output resistance of these conﬁgurations is dominated by the resistance
ro when transistors are used as load devices in ICs.
The speciﬁc characteristics of these single-stage ampliﬁers are used in the
design of multistage ampliﬁers.
4.7
SINGLE-STAGE INTEGRATED 
CIRCUIT MOSFET AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze all-MOS transistor circuits that become the
foundation of integrated circuits.
In the last chapter, we considered three all-MOSFET inverters and plotted the voltage
transfer characteristics. All three inverters use an n-channel enhancement-mode driver
transistor. The three types of load devices are an n-channel enhancement-mode
device, an n-channel depletion-mode device, and a p-channel enhancement-mode de-
vice. The MOS transistor used as a load device is referred to as an active load. We
mentioned that these three circuits can be used as ampliﬁers.
In this section, we revisit these three circuits and consider their ampliﬁer char-
acteristics. We will emphasize the small-signal equivalent circuits. This section
serves as an introduction to more advanced MOS integrated circuit ampliﬁer designs
considered in Part 2 of the text.

Load Line Revisited
In dealing with all-transistor circuits, it will be instructive to consider the equivalent
load lines that we have considered previously in circuits with resistive loads. Before
we deal with the nonlinear load lines or load curves, it may be worthwhile to revisit
the load line concept of a single transistor with a resistive load.
Figure 4.36 shows a single MOSFET with a resistive load. The current–voltage
characteristic of the resistive load device is given by Ohm’s law, or VR = ID RD. This
curve is plotted in the top portion of Figure 4.37. The load line is given by the KVL
equation around the drain-source loop, or VDS = VDD −ID RD, and is superimposed
on the transistor characteristics in the lower portion of Figure 4.37. We may note that
the last term in the load line equation, ID RD, is the voltage across the load device.

We may compare two points on the load device characteristic to the load line.
When ID = 0, VR = 0 on the load characteristic curve denoted by point A. On the
load line, the ID = 0 point corresponds to VDS = VDD, denoted by the point A′. The
maximum current on the load characteristic curve occurs when VR = VDD and is
denoted by point B. On the load line, the maximum current point corresponds to
VDS = 0, denoted by point B′. The load line can be created by taking the mirror
image of the load characteristic curve and superimposing this curve on the plot of
transistor characteristics. We will see this same effect in the following sections.
NMOS Ampliﬁers with Enhancement Load
The characteristics of an n-channel enhancement load device were presented in the last
chapter. Figure 4.38(a) shows an NMOS enhancement load transistor, and Fig-
ure 4.38(b) shows the current–voltage characteristics. The threshold voltage is VT N L.
4.7.2

240
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Figure 4.39(a) shows an NMOS ampliﬁer with enhancement load. The driver
transistor is MD and the load transistor is ML. The characteristics of transistor MD and
the load curve are shown in Figure 4.39(b). The load curve is essentially the mirror
image of the i–v characteristic of the load device, as we discussed in the last section.
Since the i–v characteristics of the load device are nonlinear, the load curve is also
nonlinear. The load curve intersects the voltage axis at VDD −VT N L, which is the
point where the current in the enhancement load device goes to zero. The transition
point is also shown on the curve.
The voltage transfer characteristic is also useful in visualizing the operation of
the ampliﬁer. This curve is shown in Figure 4.39(c). When the enhancement-mode
driver ﬁrst begins to conduct, it is biased in the saturation region. For use as an
ampliﬁer, the circuit Q-point should be in this region, as shown in both Fig-
ures 4.39(b) and (c).
We can now apply the small-signal equivalent circuits to ﬁnd the voltage gain. In
the discussion of the source follower, we found that the equivalent resistance looking
into the source terminal (with RS = ∞) was Ro = (1/gm)∥ro. The small-signal
equivalent circuit of the inverter is given in Figure 4.40, where the subscripts D and
L refer to the driver and load transistors, respectively. We are again neglecting the
body effect of the load transistor.

VDD = 5 V.
Choices: NMOS transistors with parameters VT N = 1 V, k′
n = 60 μA/V2, and λ = 0
are available. The minimum width-to-length ratio is (W/L)min = 1. Tolerances of
±5 percent in the k′

Solution (dc design): Setting the currents in the two transistors equal to each other
(both transistors biased in saturation region), we have
iDD = KnD(vGSD −VT N D)2 = iDL = KnL(vGSL −VT N L)2
From Figure 4.39(a), we see that vGSL = VDD −vO. Substituting, we have

and
vOt = vDSDt = vGSDt −VT N D = 1.36 −1 = 0.36 V

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
The tolerances in the k′
n and VT N parameters will also affect the Q-point. This analy-
sis is left as an end-of-chapter problem.
Comment: These results show that a very large difference is required in the sizes of
the two transistors to produce a gain of 10. In fact, a gain of 10 is about the largest
practical gain that can be produced by an enhancement load device. A larger small-
signal gain can be obtained by using a depletion-mode MOSFET as a load device, as
shown in the next section.
Design Pointer: The body effect of the load transistor was neglected in this analy-
sis. The body effect will actually lower the small-signal voltage gain from that deter-
mined in the example.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 4.11: The bias voltage for the enhancement-load ampliﬁer shown in Figure
4.39(a) is VDD = 3.3 V. The transistor parameters are VT N D = VT N L = 0.4 V,
k′
n = 100 μA/V2, (W/L)L = 1.2, and λ = 0. (a) Design the circuit such that 
the small-signal voltage gain is |Av| = 8. (b) Determine VGSDQ such that the 
Q-point is in the center of the saturation region. (Ans. (a) (W/L)D = 76.8,
(b) VGSDQ = 0.561 V).
NMOS Ampliﬁer with Depletion Load
Figure 4.42(a) shows the NMOS depletion-mode transistor connected as a load device
and Figure 4.42(b) shows the current–voltage characteristics. The transition point is
also indicated. The threshold voltage VTNL of this device is negative, which means that
the vDS value at the transition point is positive. Also, the slope of the curve in the
saturation region is not zero; therefore, a ﬁnite resistance ro exists in this region.
Figure 4.43(a) shows an NMOS depletion load ampliﬁer. The transistor char-
acteristics of MD and the load curve for the circuit are shown in Figure 4.43(b). The
load curve, again, is the mirror image of the i–v characteristic of the load device.
Since the i–v characteristics of the load device are nonlinear, the load curve is also
nonlinear. The transition points for both MD and ML are also indicated. Point A is the
transition point for MD, and point B is the transition point for ML. The Q-point should
be approximately midway between the two transition points.

The dc voltage VGSDQ biases transistor MD in the saturation region at the Q-point.
The signal voltage vi superimposes a time-varying gate-to-source voltage on the dc
value, and the bias point moves along the load curve about the Q-point. Again, both
MD and ML must be biased in their saturation regions at all times.
The voltage transfer characteristic of this circuit is shown in Figure 4.43(c).
Region III corresponds to the condition in which both transistors are biased in the
saturation region. The desired Q-point is indicated.
We can again apply the small-signal equivalent circuit to find the small-signal
voltage gain. Since the gate-to-source voltage of the depletion-load device is held
at zero, the equivalent resistance looking into the source terminal is Ro = ro.

Figure 4.44 Small-signal equivalent circuit of NMOS inverter with depletion load device
The small-signal equivalent circuit of the inverter is given in Figure 4.44, where
the subscripts D and L refer to the driver and load transistors, respectively. We are
again neglecting the body effect of the load device.
The small-signal voltage gain is then
Av = Vo
Vi
= −gmD(roD∥roL)
(4.51)
In this circuit, the voltage gain is directly proportional to the output resistances of the
two transistors.
EXAMPLE 4.12
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of the NMOS ampliﬁer with
depletion load.
For the circuit shown in Figure 4.43(a), assume transistor parameters of
VT N D = +0.8 V, VT N L = −1.5 V, KnD = 1 mA/V2, KnL = 0.2 mA/V2, and λD =
λL = 0.01 V−1. Assume the transistors are biased at IDQ = 0.2 mA.
Solution: The transconductance of the driver is
gmD = 2

KnDIDQ = 2

(1)(0.2) = 0.894 mA/V
Since λD = λL, the output resistances are
roD = roL =
1
λIDQ
=
1
(0.01)(0.2) = 500 k
The small-signal voltage gain is then
Av = −gmD(roD∥roL) = −(0.894)(500∥500) = −224
Comment: The voltage gain of the NMOS ampliﬁer with depletion load is, in
general, signiﬁcantly larger than that with the enhancement load device. The body
effect will lower the ideal gain factor.
Discussion: One aspect of this circuit design that we have not emphasized is the
dc biasing. We mentioned that both transistors need to be biased in their saturation
regions. From Figure 4.43(a), this dc biasing is accomplished with the dc source
VGSDQ. However, because of the steep slope of the transfer characteristics (Fig-
ure 4.43(c)), applying the “correct” voltage becomes difﬁcult. As we will see in the
next section, dc biasing is generally accomplished with current source biasing.

Chapter 4 Basic FET Ampliﬁers

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 4.12: Assume the depletion-load ampliﬁer in Figure 4.43(a) is biased at
IDQ = 0.1 mA. The transistor parameters are KnD = 250 μA/V2,
KnL =
25 μA/V2, VT N D = 0.4 V, VT N L = −0.8 V, and λ1 = λ2 = 0.02 V−1. Determine
the small-signal voltage gain. (Ans. Av = −79.1)
NMOS Ampliﬁer with Active Loads
CMOS Common-Source Ampliﬁer
An ampliﬁer using an n-channel enhancement-mode driver and a p-channel
enhancement mode active load is shown in Figure 4.45(a) in a common-source
conﬁguration. The p-channel active load transistor M2 is biased from M3 and IBias.
This conﬁguration is similar to the MOSFET current source shown in Figure 3.49 in
Chapter 3. With both n- and p-channel transistors in the same circuit, this circuit is
now referred to as a CMOS ampliﬁer. The CMOS conﬁguration is used almost
exclusively rather than the NMOS enhancement load or depletion load devices.
The i–v characteristic curve for M2 is shown in Figure 4.45(b). The source-to-
gate voltage is a constant and is established by M3. The driver transistor characteris-
tics and the load curve are shown in Figure 4.45(c). The transition points of both M1

n = 80 μA/V2, k′
p = 40 μA/V2, (W/L)n = 15,
(W/L)p = 30, and λn = λp = 0.01 V−1. Also, assume IBias = 0.2 mA.

(0.01)(0.2) = 500 k
and M2 are shown. Point A is the transition point for M1 and point B is the transition
point for M2. The Q-point, to establish an ampliﬁer, should be approximately
halfway between points A and B, so that both transistors are biased in their saturation
regions. The voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 4.45(d). Shown on
the curve are the same transition points A and B and the desired Q-point.
We again apply the small-signal equivalent circuits to ﬁnd the small-signal volt-
age gain. With vSG2 held constant, the equivalent resistance looking into the drain of
M2 is just Ro = rop. The small-signal equivalent circuit of the inverter is then as given
in Figure 4.46. The subscripts n and p refer to the n-channel and p-channel transis-
tors, respectively. We may note that the body terminal of M1 will be tied to ground,
which is the same as the source of M1, and the body terminal of M2 will be tied to
VDD, which is the same as the source of M2. Hence, there is no body effect in this
circuit.
The small-signal voltage gain is
Av = Vo
Vi
= −gmn(ron∥rop)
(4.52)
Again for this circuit, the small-signal voltage gain is directly proportional to the
output resistances of the two transistors.

The small-signal voltage gain is then

Comment: The voltage gain of the CMOS ampliﬁer is on the same order of magni-
tude as the NMOS ampliﬁer with depletion load. However, the CMOS ampliﬁer does
not suffer from the body effect.
Discussion: In the circuit conﬁguration shown in Figure 4.45(a), we must again
apply a dc voltage to the gate of M1 to achieve the “proper” Q-point. We will show in
later chapters using more sophisticated circuits how the Q-point is more easily
established with current-source biasing. However, this circuit demonstrates the basic
principles of the CMOS common-source ampliﬁer.

Find the width-to-length ratio of M1 such that the small-signal voltage gain is
Av = −250. (Ans. (W/L)1 = 35.2)
CMOS Source-Follower Ampliﬁer
The same basic CMOS circuit conﬁguration can be used to form a CMOS source-
follower ampliﬁer. Figure 4.47(a) shows a source-follower circuit. We see that for
this source-follower circuit, the active load, which is M2, is an n-channel rather than
a p-channel device. The input signal is applied to the gate of M1 and the output is at
the source of M1.
The small-signal equivalent circuit of this source-follower is shown in 
Figure 4.47(b). This circuit, with two signal grounds, is redrawn as shown in
Figure 4.47(c) to combine the signal grounds.
EXAMPLE 4.14
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain and output resistance of the
source-follower ampliﬁer shown in Figure 4.47(a).
Assume the reference bias current is IBias = 0.20 mA and the bias voltage is
VDD = 3.3 V. Assume that all transistors are matched (identical) with parameters
VT N = 0.4 V, Kn = 0.20 mA/V2, and λ = 0.01 V−1.
We may note that since M3 and M2 are matched transistors and have the same
gate-to-source voltages, the drain current in M1 is ID1 = IBias = 0.2 mA.
Solution (voltage gain): From Figure 4.47(c), we ﬁnd the small-signal output volt-
age to be
Vo = gm1Vgs(ro1∥ro2)
A KVL equation around the outside loop produces
Vi = Vgs + Vo = Vgs + gm1Vgs(ro1∥ro2)

also a characteristic of a source-follower circuit.

Figure 4.48(a) shows a common-gate circuit. We see that in this common-gate
circuit, the active load is the PMOS device M2. The input signal is applied to the
source of M1 and the output is at the drain of M1.

Assume the reference bias current is IBias = 0.20 mA and the bias voltage is

Comment: A voltage gain of Av = +101 is typical of a common-gate ampliﬁer. The

large. Also, a large output resistance of Ro = 250 k is typical of a common-gate

MULTISTAGE AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze multitransistor or multistage ampliﬁers and
understand the advantages of these circuits over single-transistor
ampliﬁers.
In most applications, a single-transistor ampliﬁer will not be able to meet the
combined speciﬁcations of a given ampliﬁcation factor, input resistance, and output
resistance. For example, the required voltage gain may exceed that which can be
obtained in a single-transistor circuit. We will consider, here, the ac analysis of the
two multitransistor circuits investigated in Chapter 3.
Multistage Ampliﬁer: Cascade Circuit

and provides the required output current. The resistor values are those determined in
Section 3.5.1 of the previous chapter.
The midband small-signal voltage gain of the multistage ampliﬁer is determined
by assuming that all external coupling capacitors act as short circuits and inserting

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 4.49. The transistor parameters are
Kn1 = 0.5 mA/V2, Kn2 = 0.2 mA/V2, VT N1 = VT N2 = 1.2 V, and λ1 = λ2 = 0. The
quiescent drain currents are ID1 = 0.2 mA and ID2 = 0.5 mA.

Comment: Since the small-signal voltage gain of the source follower is slightly
less than 1, the overall gain is due essentially to the common-source input stage.
Also, as shown previously, the output resistance of the source follower is small,
which is desirable in many applications.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 4.16: For the cascade circuit shown in Figure 4.49, the transistor and circuit
parameters are given in Example 4.16. Calculate the small-signal output resis-
tance Ro. (The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4.50.) (Ans.

Multistage Ampliﬁer: Cascode Circuit
Figure 4.51 shows a cascode circuit with n-channel MOSFETs. Transistor M1 is
connected in a common-source conﬁguration and M2 is connected in a common-gate
conﬁguration. The advantage of this type of circuit is a higher frequency response,
which will be discussed in Chapter 7. The resistor values are those determined in
Section 3.5.2 of the previous chapter.

increase the frequency bandwidth, as we will see in a later chapter.

EXAMPLE 4.17
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of a cascode circuit.
Consider the cascode circuit shown in Figure 4.51. The transistor parameters are
Kn1 = Kn2 = 0.8 mA/V2, VT N1 = VT N2 = 1.2 V, and λ1 = λ2 = 0. The quiescent
drain current is ID = 0.4 mA in each transistor. The input signal to the circuit is
assumed to be an ideal voltage source.
Solution: Since the transistors are identical and since the current in the two transis-
tors is the same, the small-signal transconductance parameters are

The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4.52. Transistor M1 supplies
the source current of M2 with the signal current (gm1Vi). Transistor M2 acts as a
current follower and passes this current on to its drain terminal. The output voltage is
therefore

BASIC JFET AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Develop the small-signal model of JFET devices and
analyze basic JFET ampliﬁers.
Like MOSFETs, JFETs can be used to amplify small time-varying signals. Initially,
we will develop the small-signal model and equivalent circuit of the JFET. We will
then use the model in the analysis of JFET ampliﬁers.
Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit
Figure 4.53 shows a JFET circuit with a time-varying signal applied to the gate. The
instantaneous gate-to-source voltage is
vGS = VGS + vi = VGS + vgs
(4.53)
where vgs is the small-signal gate-to-source voltage. Assuming the transistor is biased
in the saturation region, the instantaneous drain current is
iD = IDSS

The ﬁrst term in Equation (4.56) is the dc or quiescent drain current IDQ, the second
term is the time-varying drain current component, which is linearly related to the signal
voltage vgs, and the third term is proportional to the square of the signal voltage. As in
the case of the MOSFET, the third term produces a nonlinear distortion in the output
current. To minimize this distortion, we will usually impose the following condition:

Equation (4.57) represents the small-signal condition that must be satisﬁed for JFET
ampliﬁers to be linear.
Neglecting the term v2

Since the transconductance is directly proportional to the saturation current 
IDSS, the transconductance is also a function of the width-to-length ratio of the
transistor.
Since we are looking into a reverse-biased pn junction, we assume that the input
gate current ig is zero, which means that the small-signal input resistance is inﬁnite.
Equation (4.54) can be expanded to take into account the ﬁnite output resistance of a
JFET biased in the saturation region. The equation becomes

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
The small-signal equivalent circuit of the n-channel JFET, shown in Figure 4.54,
is exactly the same as that of the n-channel MOSFET. The small-signal equivalent
circuit of the p-channel JFET is also the same as that of the p-channel MOSFET.
However, the polarity of the controlling gate-to-source voltage and the direction of
the dependent current source are reversed from those of the n-channel device.
Small-Signal Analysis
Since the small-signal equivalent circuit of the JFET is the same as that of the MOS-
FET, the small-signal analyses of the two types of circuits are identical. For illustra-
tion purposes, we will analyze two JFET circuits.

Solution: The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4.58. The output
voltage is

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 4.19: Reconsider the source-follower circuit shown in Figure 4.57 with tran-
sistor parameters IDSS = 8 mA, VP = −3.5 V, and λ = 0.01 V−1. (a) Design the
circuit such that IDQ = 2 mA. (b) Calculate the small-signal voltage gain if RL

gain is reduced by 20 percent from its value for (b). (Ans. (a) RS = 5.88 k,
(b) Av = 0.923, RL = 1.61 k)
In Example 4.19, we chose a value of transconductance and continued through the
design. A more detailed examination shows that both gm and RS depend upon the drain
current IDQ in such a way that the product gmRS is approximately a constant. This means
the small-signal voltage gain is insensitive to the initial value of the transconductance.

DESIGN APPLICATION:
A TWO-STAGE AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Design a two-stage MOSFET circuit to amplify the
output of a sensor.
Speciﬁcations: Assume the resistance R2 in the voltage divider circuit in Figure 4.60
varies linearly as a function of temperature, pressure, or some other variable. The
output of the ampliﬁer is to be zero volts when δ = 0.
Design Approach: The ampliﬁer conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Fig-
ure 4.60. A resistor R1 will be chosen such that the voltage divider between R1 and R2
will produce a dc voltage vI that is negative. A negative gate voltage to M1 then means
that the resistance RS1 does not need to be so large.
Choices: Assume NMOS and PMOS transistors are available with parameters
VT N = 1 V, VT P = −1 V, Kn = Kp = 2 mA/V2, and λn = λp ∼= 0.
Solution (voltage divider analysis): The voltage vI can be written as
vI =

R(1 + δ)
R(1 + δ) + 3R

(10) −5 = (1 + δ)(10)

Solution (DC Design): We will choose ID1 = 0.5 mA and ID2 = 1 mA. The gate-
to-source voltages are determined to be:
0.5 = 2(VGS1 −1)2 ⇒VGS1 = 1.5 V
and
1 = 2(VSG2 −1)2 ⇒VSG2 = 1.707 V
We ﬁnd VS1 = VI −VGS1 = −2.5 −1.5 = −4 V. The resistor RS1 is then
RS1 = VS1 −V −
ID1

Letting VD1 = 1.5 V, we ﬁnd the resistor RD1 to be

We have VS2 = VD1 + VSG2 = 1.5 + 1.707 = 3.207 V. Then

We ﬁnd V2 = −gm1Vgs1RD1 and Vgs1 = Vi/(1 + gm1RS1). We also ﬁnd Vo =
gm2Vsg2RD2 and Vsg2 = −V2/(1 + gm2RS2). Combining terms, we ﬁnd
Vo =

(1 + gm1RS1)(1 + gm2RS2)Vi

[1 + (2)(2)][1 + (2.828)(1.79)]δ
or
Vo = 8.16δ
Comment: Since the low-frequency input impedance to the gate of the NMOS is
essentially inﬁnite, there is no loading effect on the voltage divider circuit.
Design Pointer: As mentioned previously, by choosing the value of R1 to be larger
than R2, the dc voltage to the gate of M1 is negative. A negative gate voltage implies
that the required value of RS1 is reduced and can still establish the required current.
Since the drain voltage at M1 is positive, then by using a PMOS transistor in the
second stage, the source resistor value of RS2 is also reduced. Smaller source
resistances generate larger voltage gains.

In Chapter 2, we saw that the rectifying current–voltage characteristics of the diode
are useful in electronic switching and waveshaping circuits. However, diodes are not
capable of amplifying currents or voltages. As was shown in Chapter 4, the electronic
device that is capable of current and voltage ampliﬁcation, or gain, in conjunction
with other circuit elements, is the transistor. The development of the transistor by
Bardeen, Brattain, and Schockley at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the late 1940s
started the ﬁrst electronics revolution of the 1950s and 1960s. This invention led to
the development of the ﬁrst integrated circuit in 1958 and to the transistor operational
ampliﬁer (op-amp), which is one of the most widely used electronic circuits.
The bipolar transistor, which is introduced in this chapter, is one of the two
major types of transistors. The second type of transistor, the ﬁeld-effect transistor
(FET), was introduced in Chapter 3. These two device types are the basis of modern
microelectronics. Each device type is equally important and each has particular ad-
vantages for speciﬁc applications.

Discuss the physical structure and operation of the bipolar junction transistor.
•
Understand and become familiar with the dc analysis and design techniques
of bipolar transistor circuits.

•
Investigate various dc biasing schemes of bipolar transistor circuits, includ-
ing integrated circuit biasing.
•

BASIC BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR
Objective: • Understand the physical structure, operation, and char-
acteristics of the bipolar junction transistors (BJT), including the npn
and pnp devices.
The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has three separately doped regions and con-
tains two pn junctions.A single pn junction has two modes of operation—forward bias
and reverse bias. The bipolar transistor, with two pn junctions, therefore has four pos-
sible modes of operation, depending on the bias condition of each pn junction, which
is one reason for the versatility of the device. With three separately doped regions, the
bipolar transistor is a three-terminal device. The basic transistor principle is that
the voltage between two terminals controls the current through the third terminal.
Our discussion of the bipolar transistor starts with a description of the basic tran-
sistor structure and a qualitative description of its operation. To describe its operation,
we use the pn junction concepts presented in Chapter 1. However, the two pn junctions
are sufﬁciently close together to be called interacting pn junctions. The operation of
the transistor is therefore totally different from that of two back-to-back diodes.
Current in the transistor is due to the ﬂow of both electrons and holes, hence the
name bipolar. Our discussion covers the relationship between the three terminal cur-
rents. In addition, we present the circuit symbols and conventions used in bipolar
circuits, the bipolar transistor current–voltage characteristics, and ﬁnally, some non-
ideal current–voltage characteristics.
Transistor Structures
Figure 5.1 shows simpliﬁed block diagrams of the basic structure of the two types of
bipolar transistor: npn and pnp. The npn bipolar transistor contains a thin p-region
between two n-regions. In contrast, the pnp bipolar transistor contains a thin n-
region sandwiched between two p-regions. The three regions and their terminal
connections are called the emitter, base, and collector.1 The operation of the device
depends on the two pn junctions being in close proximity, so the width of the base
must be very narrow, normally in the range of tenths of a micrometer (10−6 m).
The actual structure of the bipolar transistor is considerably more complicated
than the block diagrams of Figure 5.1. For example, Figure 5.2 is the cross section of
5.1.1
1The reason for the names emitter and collector for the terminals will become obvious as we go through
the operation of the transistor. The term base refers to the structure of the original transistor.

Chapter 5 The Bipolar Junction Transistor
287
a classic npn bipolar transistor fabricated in an integrated circuit. One important
point is that the device is not symmetrical electrically. This asymmetry occurs
because the geometries of the emitter and collector regions are not the same, and the
impurity doping concentrations in the three regions are substantially different. For
example, the impurity doping concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector may
be on the order of 1019, 1017, and 1015 cm−3, respectively. Therefore, even though
both ends are either p-type or n-type on a given transistor, switching the two ends
makes the device act in drastically different ways.
Although the block diagrams in Figure 5.1 are highly simpliﬁed, they are still
useful for presenting the basic transistor characteristics.
npn Transistor: Forward-Active Mode Operation
Since the transistor has two pn junctions, four possible bias combinations may be ap-
plied to the device, depending on whether a forward or reverse bias is applied to each
junction. For example, if the transistor is used as an amplifying device, the base–emitter
(B–E) junction is forward biased and the base–collector (B–C) junction is reverse
biased, in a conﬁguration called the forward-active operating mode, or simply the
active region. The reason for this bias combination will be illustrated as we look at
the operation of such transistors and the characteristics of circuits that use them.
Transistor Currents
Figure 5.3 shows an idealized npn bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode.
Since the B–E junction is forward biased, electrons from the emitter are injected across

the B–E junction into the base, creating an excess minority carrier concentration in the
base. Since the B–C junction is reverse biased, the electron concentration at the edge
of that junction is approximately zero.
The base region is very narrow so that, in the ideal case, the injected electrons
will not recombine with any of the majority carrier holes in the base. In this case, the
electron distribution versus distance through the base is a straight line as shown in
Figure 5.4. Because of the large gradient in this concentration, electrons that are in-
jected, or emitted, from the emitter region diffuse across the base, are swept across
the base–collector space-charge region by the electric ﬁeld, and are collected in the
collector region creating the collector current. However, if some carrier recombina-
tion does occur in the base, the electron concentration will deviate from the ideal linear
curve, as shown in the ﬁgure. To minimize recombination effects, the width of the
neutral base region must be small compared to the minority carrier diffusion length.
Emitter Current: Since the B–E junction is forward biased, we expect the current
through this junction to be an exponential function of B–E voltage, just as we saw
that the current through a pn junction diode was an exponential function of the forward-
biased diode voltage. We can then write the current at the emitter terminal as
iE = IEO[evBE/VT −1] ∼= IEOevBE/VT
(5.1)
where the approximation of neglecting the (−1) term is usually valid since vBE ≫VT
in most cases.2 The parameter VT is the usual thermal voltage. The emission coefﬁ-
cient n that multiplies VT is assumed to be 1, as we discussed in Chapter 1 in consid-
ering the ideal diode equation. The ﬂow of the negatively charged electrons is
through the emitter into the base and is opposite to the conventional current direction.
The conventional emitter current direction is therefore out of the emitter terminal.

function versus distance for an ideal transistor (no carrier recombination), and is a nonlinear
function versus distance for a real device (with carrier recombination).
2The voltage notation vBE, with the dual subscript, denotes the voltage between the B (base) and E
(emitter) terminals. Implicit in the notation is that the ﬁrst subscript (the base terminal) is positive with
respect to the second subscript (the emitter terminal).
We will assume that the ideality factor n in this diode equation is unity (see Chapter 1).

Chapter 5 The Bipolar Junction Transistor
289
The multiplying constant, IEO, contains electrical parameters of the junction, but
in addition is directly proportional to the active B–E cross-sectional area. Therefore,
if two transistors are identical except that one has twice the area of the other, then the
emitter currents will differ by a factor of two for the same applied B–E voltage.
Typical values of IEO are in the range of 10−12 to 10−16 A, but may, for special tran-
sistors, vary outside of this range.
Collector Current: Since the doping concentration in the emitter is much larger
than that in the base region, the vast majority of emitter current is due to the injection
of electrons into the base. The number of these injected electrons reaching the col-
lector is the major component of collector current.
The number of electrons reaching the collector per unit time is proportional to
the number of electrons injected into the base, which in turn is a function of the B–E
voltage. To a ﬁrst approximation, the collector current is proportional to evBE/VT and
is independent of the reverse-biased B–C voltage. The device therefore looks like a
constant-current source. The collector current is controlled by the B–E voltage; in
other words, the current at one terminal (the collector) is controlled by the voltage
across the other two terminals. This control is the basic transistor action.
We can write the collector current as
iC = ISevBE/VT
(5.2)
The collector current is slightly smaller than the emitter current, as we will show. The
emitter and collector currents are related by iC = αiE. We can also relate the coefﬁ-
cients by IS = αIEO. The parameter α is called the common-base current gain
whose value is always slightly less than unity. The reason for this name will become
clearer as we proceed through the chapter.
Base Current:
Since the B–E junction is forward biased, holes from the base are in-
jected across the B–E junction into the emitter. However, because these holes do not con-
tribute to the collector current, they are not part of the transistor action. Instead, the ﬂow
of holes forms one component of the base current. This component is also an exponential
function of the B–E voltage, because of the forward-biased B–E junction. We can write
iB1 ∝evBE/VT
(5.3(a))
A few electrons recombine with majority carrier holes in the base. The holes that
are lost must be replaced through the base terminal. The ﬂow of such holes is a sec-
ond component of the base current. This “recombination current” is directly propor-
tional to the number of electrons being injected from the emitter, which in turn is an
exponential function of the B–E voltage. We can write
iB2 ∝evBE/VT
(5.3(b))
The total base current is the sum of the two components from Equations (5.3(a))
and (5.3(b)):
iB ∝evBE/VT
(5.4)
Figure 5.5 shows the ﬂow of electrons and holes in an npn bipolar transistor, as
well as the terminal currents.3 (Reminder: the conventional current direction is the
3A more thorough study of the physics of the bipolar transistor shows that there are other current compo-
nents, in addition to the ones mentioned. However, these additional currents do not change the basic prop-
erties of the transistor and can be neglected for our purposes.

same as the ﬂow of positively charged holes and opposite to the ﬂow of negatively
charged electrons.)
If the concentration of electrons in the n-type emitter is much larger than the
concentration of holes in the p-type base, then the number of electrons injected into
the base will be much larger than the number of holes injected into the emitter. This
means that the iB1 component of the base current will be much smaller than the col-
lector current. In addition, if the base width is small, then the number of electrons
that recombine in the base will be small, and the iB2 component of the base current
will also be much smaller than the collector current.
Common-Emitter Current Gain
In the transistor, the rate of ﬂow of electrons and the resulting collector current are an ex-
ponential function of the B–E voltage, as is the resulting base current. This means that
the collector current and the base current are linearly related. Therefore, we can write
iC
iB
= β
(5.5)
or
iB = IBOevBE/VT = iC
β = IS
β evBE/VT
(5.6)
The parameter β is the common-emitter current gain4 and is a key parameter
of the bipolar transistor. In this idealized situation, β is considered to be a constant
for any given transistor. The value of β is usually in the range of 50 < β < 300, but
it can be smaller or larger for special devices.
The value of β is highly dependent upon transistor fabrication techniques and
process tolerances. Therefore, the value of β varies between transistor types and also
between transistors of a given type, such as the discrete 2N2222. In any example or
problem, we generally assume that β is a constant. However, it is important to real-
ize that β can and does vary.
Figure 5.6 shows an npn bipolar transistor in a circuit. Because the emitter is the
common connection, this circuit is referred to as a common-emitter conﬁguration.

current gain and common-emitter current gain parameters are often denoted as αF and βF, respectively.
For ease of notation, we will simply deﬁne these parameters as α and β.

biased and the B–C junction is reverse biased. Using the piecewise linear model of a
pn junction, we assume that the B–E voltage is equal to VBE(on), the junction turn-
on voltage. Since VCC = vC E + iC RC, the power supply voltage must be sufﬁciently
large to keep the B–C junction reverse biased. The base current is established by VBB
and RB, and the resulting collector current is iC = βiB.
If we set VBB = 0, the B–E junction will have zero applied volts; therefore,
iB = 0, which implies that iC = 0. This condition is called cutoff.
Current Relationships
If we treat the bipolar transistor as a single node, then, by Kirchhoff’s current law, we
have
iE = iC + iB
(5.7)
If the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, then
iC = βiB
(5.8)
Substituting Equation (5.8) into (5.7), we obtain the following relationship between
the emitter and base currents:
iE = (1 + β)iB
(5.9)
Solving for iB in Equation (5.8) and substituting into Equation (5.9), we obtain a
relationship between the collector and emitter currents, as follows:
iC =

iE
(5.10)
We can write iC = αiE so
α =

(5.11)
The parameter α is called the common-base current gain and is always slightly
less than 1. We may note that if β = 100, then α = 0.99, so α is indeed close to 1.
From Equation (5.11), we can state the common-emitter current gain in terms of the
common-base current gain:
β =

exponentially related ﬂow of electrons from the emitter into the base where they dif-
fuse across the base region and are collected in the collector region. The collector
current, iC, is independent of the B–C voltage as long as the B–C junction is reverse
biased. The collector, then, behaves as an ideal current source. The collector current
is a fraction α of the emitter current, and the base current is a fraction 1/β of the col-
lector current. If β ≫1, then α ∼= 1 and iC ∼= iE.
EXAMPLE 5.1
Objective: Calculate the collector and emitter currents, given the base current and
current gain.
Assume a common-emitter current gain of β = 150 and a base current of
iB = 15 μA. Also assume that the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode.
Solution: The relation between collector and base currents gives
iC = βiB = (150)(15 μA) ⇒2.25 mA
and the relation between emitter and base currents yields
iE = (1 + β)iB = (151)(15 μA) ⇒2.27 mA
From Equation (5.11), the common-base current gain is
α =
β
1 + β = 150
151 = 0.9934
Comment: For reasonable values of β, the collector and emitter currents are nearly
equal, and the common-base current gain is nearly 1.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.1: An npn transistor is biased in the forward-active mode. The base current is
IB = 8.50 μA and the emitter current is IE = 1.20 mA. Determine β, α, and IC.
(Ans. β = 140.2, α = 0.9929, IC = 1.1915 mA)
pnp Transistor: Forward-Active Mode Operation
We have discussed the basic operation of the npn bipolar transistor. The complemen-
tary device is the pnp transistor. Figure 5.7 shows the ﬂow of holes and electrons in
a pnp device biased in the forward-active mode. Since the B–E junction is forward
biased, the p-type emitter is positive with respect to the n-type base, holes ﬂow from
the emitter into the base, the holes diffuse across the base, and they are swept into the
collector. The collector current is a result of this ﬂow of holes.
Again, since the B–E junction is forward biased, the emitter current is an expo-
nential function of the B–E voltage. Noting the direction of emitter current and the
polarity of the foward-biased B–E voltage, we can write
iE = IEOevE B/VT
(5.13)
where vE B is the voltage between the emitter and base, and now implies that the
emitter is positive with respect to the base. We are again assuming the −1 term in the
ideal diode equation is negligible.
5.1.3

Chapter 5 The Bipolar Junction Transistor
293
The collector current is an exponential function of the E–B voltage, and the di-
rection is out of the collector terminal, which is opposite to that in the npn device. We
can now write
iC = αiE = ISevE B/VT
(5.14)
where α is again the common-base current gain.
The base current in a pnp device is the sum of two components. The ﬁrst com-
ponent, iB1, comes from electrons ﬂowing from the base into the emitter as a result of
the forward-biased E–B junction. We can then write iB1 ∝exp(vE B/VT ). The sec-
ond component, iB2, comes from the ﬂow of electrons supplied through the base ter-
minal to replace those lost by recombination with the minority carrier holes injected
into the base from the emitter. This component is proportional to the number of holes
injected into the base, so iB2 ∝exp(vE B/VT ). Therefore the total base current is
iB = iB1 + iB2 ∝exp(vE B/VT ). The direction of the base current is out of the base
terminal. Since the total base current in the pnp device is an exponential function of
the E–B voltage, we can write
iB = IBOevE B/VT = iC
β = IS
β evE B/VT
(5.15)
The parameter β is also the common-emitter current gain of the pnp bipolar
transistor.
The relationships between the terminal currents of the pnp transistor are exactly
the same as those of the npn transistor and are summarized in Table 5.1 in the next
section. Also the relationships between β and α are the same as given in Equations
(5.11) and (5.12).
Circuit Symbols and Conventions
The block diagram and conventional circuit symbol of an npn bipolar transistor are
shown in Figures 5.8(a) and 5.8(b). The arrowhead in the circuit symbol is always
placed on the emitter terminal, and it indicates the direction of the emitter current.
For the npn device, this direction is out of the emitter. The simpliﬁed block dia-
gram and conventional circuit symbol of a pnp bipolar transistor are shown in
Figures 5.9(a) and 5.9(b). Here, the arrowhead on the emitter terminal indicates that
the direction of the emitter current is into the emitter.

Current–Voltage Characteristics

a pnp bipolar transistor, respectively. The current sources provide the emitter current.
Previously, we stated that the collector current iC was nearly independent of the C–B
voltage as long as the B–C junction was reverse biased. When the B–C junction be-
comes forward biased, the transistor is no longer in the forward-active mode, and the
collector and emitter currents are no longer related by iC = αiE.

Figure 5.13 Transistor current–voltage characteristics of the common-emitter circuit
current, the collector current is nearly equal to iE. These characteristics show that the
common-base device is nearly an ideal constant-current source.
The C–B voltage can be varied by changing the V + voltage (Figure 5.11(a)) or
the V −voltage (Figure 5.11(b)). When the collector–base junction becomes forward
biased in the range of 0.2 and 0.3 V, the collector current iC is still essentially equal
to the emitter current iE. In this case, the transistor is still basically biased in the
forward-active mode. However, as the forward-bias C–B voltage increases, the linear
relationship between the collector and emitter currents is no longer valid, and the col-
lector current very quickly drops to zero.
The common-emitter circuit conﬁguration provides a slightly different set of
current–voltage characteristics, as shown in Figure 5.13. For these curves, the collec-
tor current is plotted against the collector–emitter voltage, for various constant values
of the base current. These curves are generated from the common-emitter circuits
shown in Figure 5.10. In this circuit, the VBB source forward biases the B–E junction
and controls the base current iB. The C–E voltage can be varied by changing VCC.
5Even though the collector current is essentially equal to the emitter current when the B–C junction
becomes slightly forward biased, as was shown in Figure 5.12, the transistor is said to be biased in the
forward-active mode when the B–C junction is zero or reverse biased.
In the npn device, in order for the transistor to be biased in the forward-active
mode, the B–C junction must be zero or reverse biased, which means that VC E must
be greater than approximately VBE(on).5 For VC E > VBE(on), there is a ﬁnite slope
to the curves. If, however, VC E < VBE(on), the B–C junction becomes forward
biased, the transistor is no longer in the forward-active mode, and the collector
current very quickly drops to zero.
Figure 5.14 shows an exaggerated view of the current–voltage characteristics
plotted for constant values of the B–E voltage. The curves are theoretically linear
with respect to the C–E voltage in the forward-active mode. The slope in these char-
acteristics is due to an effect called base-width modulation that was ﬁrst analyzed by
J. M. Early. The phenomenon is generally called the Early effect. When the curves
are extrapolated to zero current, they meet at a point on the negative voltage axis, at
vC E = −VA. The voltage VA is a positive quantity called the Early voltage. Typical

Figure 5.14 Current-voltage characteristics for the common-emitter circuit, showing the
Early voltage and the ﬁnite output resistance, ro, of the transistor
values of VA are in the range 50 < VA < 300 V. For a pnp transistor, this same effect
is true except the voltage axis is vEC.
For a given value of vBE in an npn transistor, if vC E increases, the reverse-bias
voltage on the collector–base junction increases, which means that the width of
the B–C space-charge region also increases. This in turn reduces the neutral base
width W (see Figure 5.4). A decrease in the base width causes the gradient in the
minority carrier concentration to increase, which increases the diffusion current
through the base. The collector current then increases as the C–E voltage increases.

cantly affect the ampliﬁer characteristics of such circuits. This effect is examined

Nonideal Transistor Leakage Currents 
and Breakdown Voltage
In discussing the current–voltage characteristics of the bipolar transistor in the previ-
ous sections, two topics were ignored: leakage currents in the reverse-biased pn junc-
tions and breakdown voltage effects.
Leakage Currents
In the common-base circuits in Figure 5.11, if we set the current source iE = 0, tran-
sistors will be cut off, but the B–C junctions will still be reverse biased. A reverse-
bias leakage current exists in these junctions, and this current corresponds to the
reverse-bias saturation current in a diode, as described in Chapter 1. The direction of
these reverse-bias leakage currents is the same as that of the collector currents. The
term IC BO is the collector leakage current in the common-base conﬁguration, and is
the collector-base leakage current when the emitter is an open circuit. This leakage
current is shown in Figure 5.15(a).
5.1.6
Another leakage current can exist between the emitter and collector with the
base terminal an open circuit. Figure 5.15(b) is a block diagram of an npn transistor
in which the base is an open circuit (iB = 0). The current component IC BO is the nor-
mal leakage current in the reverse-biased B–C pn junction. This current component
causes the base potential to increase, which forward biases the B–E junction and in-
duces the B–E current IC E O. The current component αIC E O is the normal collector
current resulting from the emitter current IC E O. We can write
IC E O = αIC E O + IC BO
(5.19(a))
or
IC E O = IC BO
1 −α
∼= βIC BO
(5.19(b))
This relationship indicates that the open-base conﬁguration produces different char-
acteristics than the open-emitter conﬁguration.

The common-base current–voltage characteristics shown in Figure 5.12 are ideal in
that breakdown is not shown. Figure 5.17 shows the same iC versus vC B character-
istics with the breakdown voltage.

Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Consider the curve for iE = 0 (the emitter terminal is effectively an open cir-
cuit). The collector–base junction breakdown voltage is indicated as BVC BO. This is
a simpliﬁed ﬁgure in that it shows breakdown occurring abruptly at BVC BO. For the
curves in which iE > 0, breakdown actually begins earlier. The carriers ﬂowing
across the junction initiate the breakdown avalanche process at somewhat lower
voltages.
Breakdown Voltage: Common-Emitter Characteristics
Figure 5.18 shows the iC versus vC E characteristics of an npn transistor, for various
constant base currents, and an ideal breakdown voltage of BVC E O. The value of
BVC E O is less than the value of BVC BO because BVC E O includes the effects of the
transistor action, while BVC BO does not. This same effect was observed in the IC E O
leakage current.

The breakdown voltage characteristics for the two conﬁgurations are also dif-
ferent. The breakdown voltage for the open-base case is given by
BVC E O = BVC BO

(5.22)
where n is an empirical constant usually in the range of 3 to 6.
EXAMPLE 5.2
Objective: Calculate the breakdown voltage of a transistor connected in the open-
base conﬁguration.
Assume that the transistor current gain is β = 100 and that the breakdown volt-
age of the B–C junction is BVC BO = 120 V.
Solution: If we assume an empirical constant of n = 3, we have
BVC E O = BVC BO

Chapter 5 The Bipolar Junction Transistor
301
Comment: The breakdown voltage of the open-base conﬁguration is substantially
less than that of the C–B junction. This represents a worst-case condition, which
must be considered in any circuit design.
Design Pointer: The designer must be aware of the breakdown voltage of the spe-
ciﬁc transistors used in a circuit, since this will be a limiting factor in the size of the
dc bias voltages that can be used.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.2: The open-emitter breakdown voltage is BVC BO = 200 V, the current
gain is β = 120, and the empirical constant is n = 3. Determine BVC E O.
(Ans. 40.5 V)
Breakdown may also occur in the B–E junction if a reverse-bias voltage is ap-
plied to that junction. The junction breakdown voltage decreases as the doping con-
centrations increase. Since the emitter doping concentration is usually substantially
larger than the doping concentration in the collector, the B–E junction breakdown
voltage is normally much smaller than that of the B–C junction. Typical B–E junc-
tion breakdown voltage values are in the range of 6 to 8 V.
Test Your Understanding
TYU 5.6 A particular transistor circuit requires a minimum open-base breakdown
voltage of BVC E O = 30 V. If β = 100 and n = 3, determine the minimum required
value of BVC BO. (Ans. 139 V)

DC ANALYSIS OF TRANSISTOR CIRCUITS
Objective: • Understand and become familiar with the dc analysis
and design techniques of bipolar transistor circuits.
We’ve considered the basic transistor characteristics and properties. We can now
start analyzing and designing the dc biasing of bipolar transistor circuits. A primary
purpose of the rest of the chapter is to become familiar and comfortable with the
bipolar transistor and transistor circuits. The dc biasing of transistors, the focus of
this chapter, is an important part of designing bipolar ampliﬁers, the focus of the
next chapter.
The piecewise linear model of a pn junction can be used for the dc analysis of
bipolar transistor circuits. We will ﬁrst analyze the common-emitter circuit and in-
troduce the load line for that circuit. We will then look at the dc analysis of other
bipolar transistor circuit conﬁgurations. Since a transistor in a linear ampliﬁer must
be biased in the forward-active mode, we emphasize, in this section, the analysis and
design of circuits in which the transistor is biased in this mode.

Common-Emitter Circuit
One of the basic transistor circuit conﬁgurations is called the common-emitter
circuit. Figure 5.19(a) shows one example of a common-emitter circuit. The emitter
terminal is obviously at ground potential. This circuit conﬁguration will appear in
many ampliﬁers that will be considered in Chapter 6.

Transistor equivalent circuit is shown within the dotted lines with piecewise linear transistor
parameters.
Figure 5.19(a) shows a common-emitter circuit with an npn transistor, and
Figure 5.19(b) shows the dc equivalent circuit. We will assume that the B–E junction
is forward biased, so the voltage drop across that junction is the cut-in or turn-on
voltage VBE(on). When the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, the col-
lector current is represented as a dependent current source that is a function of the
base current. We are neglecting the reverse-biased junction leakage current and the
Early effect in this case. In the following circuits, we will be considering dc currents
and voltages, so the dc notation for these parameters will be used.
The base current is
IB = VBB −VBE(on)
RB
(5.23)
Implicit in Equation (5.23) is that VBB > VBE(on), which means that IB > 0. When
VBB < VBE(on), the transistor is cut off and IB = 0.
In the collector–emitter portion of the circuit, we can write
IC = βIB
(5.24)
and
VCC = IC RC + VC E
(5.25(a))
or
VC E = VCC −IC RC
(5.25(b))
In Equation (5.25(b)), we are also implicitly assuming that VC E > VBE(on), which
means that the B–C junction is reverse biased and the transistor is biased in the
forward-active mode.

Figure 5.20 Circuit for Example 5.3: (a) circuit and (b) circuit showing current and voltage
values
Considering Figure 5.19(b), we can see that the power dissipated in the transis-
tor is given by
PT = IBVBE(on) + ICVC E
(5.26(a))
In most cases, IC ≫IB and VC E > VBE(on) so that a good ﬁrst approximation of the
power dissipated is given as
PT ∼= ICVC E
(5.26(b))
The principal condition where this approximation is not valid is for a transistor
biased in the saturation mode (discussed later).
EXAMPLE 5.3
Objective: Calculate the base, collector, and emitter currents and the C–E voltage
for a common-emitter circuit. Calculate the transistor power dissipation.
For the circuit shown in Figure 5.19(a), the parameters are: VBB = 4 V, RB =
220 k, RC = 2 k, VCC = 10 V, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and β = 200. Figure 5.20(a)
shows the circuit without explicitly showing the voltage sources.
Solution: Referring to Figure 5.20(b), the base current is found as
IB = VBB −VBE(on)
RB
= 4 −0.7

The collector current is
IC = βIB = (200)(15 μA) ⇒3 mA
and the emitter current is

From Equation (5.25(b)), the collector-emitter voltage is
VC E = VCC −IC RC = 10 −(3)(2) = 4 V
The power dissipated in the transistor is found to be
PT = IBVBE(on) + ICVC E = (0.015)(0.7) + (3)(4) ∼= ICVC E

Comment: Since VBB > VBE(on) and VC E > VBE(on), the transistor is indeed
biased in the forward-active mode. As a note, in an actual circuit, the voltage across
a B–E junction may not be exactly 0.7 V, as we have assumed using the piecewise
linear approximation. This may lead to slight inaccuracies between the calculated
currents and voltages and the measured values. Also note that, if we take the differ-
ence between IE and IC, which is the base current, we obtain IB = 20 μA rather than
15 μA. The difference is the result of roundoff error in the emitter current.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.3: The circuit elements in Figure 5.20(a) are changed to VCC = 3.3 V,
VBB = 2 V, RC = 3.2 k, and RB = 430 k. The transistor parameters are
β = 150 and VBE = 0.7 V. Calculate IB, IC, VC E, and the power dissipated in the
transistor. (Ans. IB = 3.02 μA, IC = 0.453 mA, VC E = 1.85 V, P = 0.838 mW)
Figure 5.21(a) shows a common-emitter circuit with a pnp bipolar transistor, and
Figure 5.21(b) shows the dc equivalent circuit. In this circuit, the emitter is at ground
potential, which means that the polarities of the VBB and VCC power supplies must
be reversed compared to those in the npn circuit. The analysis proceeds exactly as
before, and we can write
IB = VBB −VE B(on)
RB
(5.27)
IC = βIB
(5.28)
and
VEC = VCC −IC RC
(5.29)
We can see that Equations (5.27), (5.28), and (5.29) for the pnp bipolar transis-
tor in the common-emitter conﬁguration are exactly the same as Equations (5.23),
(5.24), and (5.25(b)) for the npn bipolar transistor in a similar circuit, if we properly
deﬁne the current directions and voltage polarities.

Chapter 5 The Bipolar Junction Transistor

In many cases, the pnp bipolar transistor will be reconﬁgured in a circuit so that
positive voltage sources, rather than negative ones, can be used. We see this in the
following example.
EXAMPLE 5.4
Objective: Analyze the common-emitter circuit with a pnp transistor.
For the circuit shown in Figure 5.22(a), the parameters are: VBB = 1.5 V,

The collector current is

RC = V + −VEC

Comment: In this case, the difference between V + and VBB is greater than the tran-
sistor turn-on voltage, or (V + −VBB) > VE B(on). Also, because VEC > VE B(on),
the pnp bipolar transistor is biased in the forward-active mode.
Discussion: In this example, we used an emitter-base turn-on voltage of
VE B(on) = 0.6 V, whereas previously we used a value of 0.7 V. We must keep in
mind that the turn-on voltage is an approximation and the actual base–emitter volt-
age will depend on the type of transistor used and the current level. In most situa-
tions, choosing a value of 0.6 V or 0.7 V will make only minor differences. However,
most people tend to use the value of 0.7 V.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.4: The circuit elements in Figure 5.22(a) are V + = 3.3 V, VBB = 1.2 V,
RB = 400 k, and RC = 5.25 k. The transistor parameters are β = 80 and
VE B(on) = 0.7 V. Determine IB, IC, and VEC. (Ans. IB = 3.5 μA, IC = 0.28 mA,
VEC = 1.83 V)
The dc equivalent circuits, such as those given in Figures 5.19(b) and 5.21(b),
are useful initially in analyzing transistor circuits. From this point on, however, we
will not explicitly draw the equivalent circuit. We will simply analyze the circuit
using the transistor circuit symbols, as in Figures 5.20 and 5.22.

dard transistor. (b) Repeat the analysis for RB = 180 k. (c) Repeat the analysis
for RB = 260 k. What can be said about RB limiting the base current?
Load Line and Modes of Operation
The load line can help us visualize the characteristics of a transistor circuit. For the
common-emitter circuit in Figure 5.20(a), we can use a graphical technique for both
the B–E and C–E portions of the circuit. Figure 5.23(a) shows the piecewise linear
characteristics for the B–E junction and the input load line. The input load line is

obtained from Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation around the B–E loop, written as
follows:
IB = VBB
RB
−VBE
RB
(5.30)
Both the load line and the quiescent base current change as either or both VBB and
RB change. The load line in Figure 5.23(a) is essentially the same as the load line
characteristics for diode circuits, as shown in Chapter 1.
For the C–E portion of the circuit in Figure 5.20(a), the load line is found by
writing Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation around the C–E loop. We obtain
VC E = VCC −IC RC
(5.31(a))
which can be written in the form
IC = VCC
RC
−VC E
RC
= 5 −VC E
2 (mA)
(5.31(b))
Equation (5.31(b)) is the load line equation, showing a linear relationship between
the collector current and collector–emitter voltage. Since we are considering the dc
analysis of the transistor circuit, this relationship represents the dc load line. The ac
load line is presented in the next chapter.
Figure 5.23(b) shows the transistor characteristics for the transistor in Exam-
ple 5.3, with the load line superimposed on the transistor characteristics. The two end
points of the load line are found by setting IC = 0, yielding VC E = VCC = 10 V, and
by setting VC E = 0, yielding IC = VCC/RC = 5 mA.
The quiescent point, or Q-point, of the transistor is given by the dc collector cur-
rent and the collector–emitter voltage. The Q-point is the intersection of the load line
and the IC versus VC E curve corresponding to the appropriate base current. The
Q-point also represents the simultaneous solution to two expressions. The load line is
useful in visualizing the bias point of the transistor. In the ﬁgure, the Q-point shown
is for the transistor in Example 5.3.
As previously stated, if the power supply voltage in the base circuit is smaller
than the turn-on voltage, then VBB < VBE(on) and IB = IC = 0, and the transistor is
in the cutoff mode. In this mode, all transistor currents are zero, neglecting leakage
currents, and for the circuit shown in Figure 5.20(a), VC E = VCC = 10 V.
As VBB increases (VBB > VBE(on)), the base current IB increases and the Q-
point moves up the load line. As IB continues to increase, a point is reached where
the collector current IC can no longer increase. At this point, the transistor is biased
in the saturation mode; that is, the transistor is said to be in saturation. The B–C
junction becomes forward biased, and the relationship between the collector and
base currents is no longer linear. The transistor C–E voltage in saturation, VC E(sat),
is less than the B–E cut-in voltage. The forward-biased B–C voltage is always less
than the forward-biased B–E voltage, so the C–E voltage in saturation is a small pos-
itive value. Typically, VC E(sat) is in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 V.
EXAMPLE 5.5
Objective: Calculate the currents and voltages in a circuit when the transistor is dri-
ven into saturation.
For the circuit shown in Figure 5.24, the transistor parameters are: β = 100, and
VBE(on) = 0.7 V. If the transistor is biased in saturation, assume VC E(sat) = 0.2 V.

308
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Solution: Since +8 V is applied to the input side of RB, the base–emitter junction is
certainly forward biased, so the transistor is turned on. The base current is
IB = VBB −VBE(on)
RB
= 8 −0.7
220
⇒33.2 μA
If we ﬁrst assume that the transistor is biased in the active region, then the collector
current is
IC = βIB = (100)(33.2 μA) ⇒3.32 mA
The collector–emitter voltage is then
VC E = VCC −IC RC = 10 −(3.32)(4) = −3.28 V
However, the collector–emitter voltage of the npn transistor in the common-emitter
conﬁguration shown in Figure 5.24(a) cannot be negative. Therefore, our initial
assumption of the transistor being biased in the forward-active mode is incorrect.
Instead, the transistor must be biased in saturation.
As given in the “objective” statement, set VC E(sat) = 0.2 V. The collector cur-
rent is
IC = IC(sat) = VCC −VC E(sat)
RC
= 10 −0.2

Assuming that the B–E voltage is still equal to VBE(on) = 0.7 V, the base current is

base current, then

Comment: When a transistor is driven into saturation, we use VC E(sat) as another
piecewise linear parameter. In addition, when a transistor is biased in the saturation
mode, we have IC < βIB. This condition is very often used to prove that a transistor
is indeed biased in the saturation mode.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.5: Consider the pnp circuit in Figure 5.22(a). Assume transistor parameters
of VE B(on) = 0.7 V, VEC (sat) = 0.2 V, and β = 110. Assume circuit parameters
of V + = 3.3 V, RC = 5 k, and RB = 150 k. Calculate IB, IC, and VEC for (a)
VBB = 2 V and (b) VBB = 1 V. (Ans. (a) IB = 4 μA, IC = 0.44 mA, VEC = 1.1 V;
(b) IB = 10.7 μA, IC = 0.62 mA, VEC = 0.2 V)
Problem-Solving Technique: Bipolar DC Analysis
Analyzing the dc response of a bipolar transistor circuit requires knowing the
mode of operation of the transistor. In some cases, the mode of operation may not
be obvious, which means that we have to guess the state of the transistor, then
analyze the circuit to determine if we have a solution consistent with our initial
guess. To do this, we can:
1.
Assume that the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode in which case
VBE = VBE(on), IB > 0, and IC = βIB.
2.
Analyze the “linear” circuit with this assumption.
3.
Evaluate the resulting state of the transistor. If the initial assumed parameter val-
ues and VC E > VC E(sat) are true, then the initial assumption is correct. How-
ever, if the calculation shows IB < 0, then the transistor is probably cut off, and
if the calculation shows VC E < 0, the transistor is likely biased in saturation.
4.
If the initial assumption is proven incorrect, then a new assumption must be made
and the new “linear” circuit must be analyzed. Step 3 must then be repeated.
Because it is not always clear whether a transistor is biased in the forward-active
or saturation mode, we may initially have to make an educated guess as to the state
of the transistor and then verify our initial assumption. This is similar to the process
we used for the analysis of multidiode circuits. For instance, in Example 5.5, we as-
sumed a forward-active mode, performed the analysis, and showed that VC E < 0.
However, a negative VC E for an npn transistor in the common-emitter conﬁguration
is not possible. Therefore, our initial assumption was disproved, and the transistor
was biased in the saturation mode. Using the results of Example 5.5, we also see that
when a transistor is in saturation, the ratio of IC to IB is always less than β, or
IC/IB < β
This condition is true for both the npn and the pnp transistor biased in the saturation
mode. When a bipolar transistor is biased in saturation, we may deﬁne
IC
IB
≡βForced
(5.32)
where βForced is called the “forced beta.” We then have that βForced < β.

Another mode of operation for a bipolar transistor is the inverse-active mode.
In this mode, the B–E junction is reverse biased and the B–C junction is forward
biased. In effect, the transistor is operating “upside down”; that is, the emitter is act-
ing as the collector and the collector is operating as the emitter. We will postpone dis-
cussions on this operating mode until we discuss digital electronic circuits later in
this text.
To summarize, the four modes of operation for an npn transistor are shown in
Figure 5.25. The four possible combinations of B–E and B–C voltages determine the
modes of operation. If vBE > 0 (forward-biased junction) and vBC < 0 (reverse-
biased junction), the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode. If both junctions
are zero or reverse biased, the transistor is in cutoff. If both junctions are forward
biased, the transistor is in saturation. If the B–E junction is reverse biased and the
B–C junction is forward biased, the transistor is in the inverse-active mode.

The piecewise linear parameter model of the transistor that we have used in the
dc analysis of transistor circuits is adequate for many applications. Another transis-
tor model is known as the Ebers–Moll model. This model can be used to describe
the transistor in each of its possible operating modes and is used in the SPICE com-
puter simulation program. However, we will not consider the Ebers–Moll model
here.

and IC for: (a) VI = 0.2 V, and (b) VI = 3.6 V. Then, calculate the power dissipated

Voltage Transfer Characteristics
A plot of the voltage transfer characteristics (output voltage versus input voltage)
can also be used to visualize the operation of a circuit or the state of a transistor. The
following example considers both an npn and a pnp transistor circuit.

Figure 5.27 Circuits for Example 5.6; (a) npn circuit and (b) pnp circuit
Solution (npn Transistor Circuit): For VI ≤0.7 V, the transistor Qn is cut off, so that
IB = IC = 0. The output voltage is then VO = V + = 5 V.
For VI > 0.7 V, the transistor Qn turns on and is initially biased in the forward-
active mode. We have
IB = VI −0.7
RB
and
IC = βIB = β(VI −0.7)
RB
Then
VO = 5 −IC RC = 5 −β(VI −0.7)RC
RB
This equation is valid for 0.2 ≤VO ≤5 V. When VO = 0.2 V, the transistor Qn goes
into saturation. When VO = 0.2 V, the input voltage is found from
0.2 = 5 −(120)(VI −0.7)(5)
150
which yields VI = 1.9 V. For VI ≥1.9 V, the transistor Qn remains biased in the sat-
uration region.
The voltage transfer curve is shown in Figure 5.28(a).
Solution (pnp transistor circuit): For 4.3 ≤VI ≤5 V, the transistor Qp is cut off, so
that IB = IC = 0. The output voltage is then VO = 0.
For VI < 4.3 V, the transistor Qp turns on and is biased in the forward-active
mode. We have
IB = (5 −0.7) −VI

and

The output voltage is then

	(5 −0.7) −VI

This equation is valid for 0 ≤VO ≤4.8 V. When VO = 4.8 V, the transistor Qp goes
into saturation.
When VO = 4.8 V, the input voltage is found from
4.8 = (80)(8)
	(5 −0.7) −VI
200

which yields VI = 2.8 V. For VI ≤2.8 V, the transistor Qp remains biased in the sat-
uration mode.

observed from the computer simulation is that the output voltage in the forward-
active mode is not exactly a linear function of input voltage as the hand analysis sug-
gested. In addition, the base-emitter voltage when vI = 1.3 V is vBE = 0.649 V in
the computer analysis results rather than the assumed value of 0.7 V in the hand
analysis. However, the hand analysis gives a good ﬁrst approximation.
Comment: As shown in this example, the voltage transfer characteristics are deter-
mined by ﬁnding the range of input voltage values that biases the transistor in cutoff,
the forward-active mode, or the saturation mode.

V. The transistor parameters are β = 100,
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VC E(sat) = 0.2 V. Plot the voltage transfer characteristics
for 0 ≤VI ≤9 V. (Ans. For 0 ≤VI ≤0.7 V, Qn is cut off, VO = 9 V; For
VI ≥5.1 V, Qn is in saturation, VO = 0.2 V)
COMPUTER ANALYSIS EXERCISE
PS 5.2: Using a PSpice simulation, plot the voltage transfer characteristics of the
circuit shown in Figure 5.27(b). Use a standard transistor. What is the value of vE B
when the transistor is biased in the forward-active region?
Commonly Used Bipolar Circuits: dc Analysis
There are a number of other bipolar transistor circuit conﬁgurations, in addition to the
common-emitter circuits shown in Figures 5.20 and 5.22, that are commonly used.
Several examples of such circuits are presented in this section. BJT circuits tend to be
very similar in terms of dc analysis procedures, so that the same basic analysis approach
will work regardless of the appearance of the circuit. We continue our dc analysis and
design of bipolar circuits to increase our proﬁciency and to become more comfortable
with these types of circuits.
EXAMPLE 5.7
Objective: Calculate the characteristics of a circuit containing an emitter resistor.
For the circuit shown in Figure 5.30(a), let VBE(on) = 0.7 V and β = 75. Note
that the circuit has both positive and negative power supply voltages.
Solution (Q-point values): Writing Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation around the
B–E loop, we have
VBB = IB RB + VBE(on) + IE RE + V −
(5.33)
Assuming the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, we can write
IE = (1 + β) IB. We can then solve Equation (5.33) for the base current:
IB = VBB −VBE(on) −V −
RB + (1 + β)RE
= 1 −0.7 −(−1.8)
560 + (76)(3)
⇒2.665 μA

The collector and emitter currents are
IC = β IB = (75)(2.665 μA) ⇒0.20 mA
and
IE = (1 + β) IB = (76)(2.665 μA) ⇒0.203 mA
From Figure 5.30(b), the collector–emitter voltage is
VC E = V + −IC RC −IE RE −V −= 1.8 −(0.20)(7) −(0.203)(3) −(−1.8)
or
VC E = 1.59 V
Solution (load line): We again use Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the C–E loop.
From the relationship between the collector and emitter currents, we ﬁnd
VC E = (V + −V −) −IC

The load line and the calculated Q-point are shown in Figure 5.31. A few transistor
characteristics of IC versus VC E are superimposed on the ﬁgure.
Comment: Since the C–E voltage is 1.59 V, VC E > VBE(on) and the transistor is
biased in the forward-active mode, as initially assumed. We will see, later in the
chapter, the value of including an emitter resistor in a circuit.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 5.9
Objective: Design a pnp bipolar transistor circuit to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 5.36(a).

β = 60 and VE B(on) = 0.7 V is available.
Solution (ideal Q-point value): Writing the Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation
around the C–E loop, we obtain
V + = IE Q RE + VEC Q

BASIC TRANSISTOR APPLICATIONS
Objective: • Examine three applications of bipolar transistor circuits:
a switch circuit, digital logic circuit, and an ampliﬁer circuit.
Transistors can be used to: switch currents, voltages, and power; perform digital
logic functions; and amplify time-varying signals. In this section, we consider the
switching properties of the bipolar transistor, analyze a simple transistor digital logic
circuit, and then show how the bipolar transistor is used to amplify time-varying
signals.
Switch
Figure 5.44 shows a bipolar circuit called an inverter, in which the transistor in the
circuit is switched between cutoff and saturation. The load, for example, could be a
motor, a light-emitting diode or some other electrical device. If vI < VBE(on), then
iB = iC = 0 and the transistor is cut off. Since iC = 0, the voltage drop across the
load is zero, so the output voltage is vO = VCC. Also, since the currents in the tran-
sistor are zero, the power dissipation in the transistor is zero. If the load were a motor,
the motor would be off with zero current. Likewise, if the load were a light-emitting
diode, the light output would be zero with zero current.
If we let vI = VCC and if the ratio of RB to RC, where RC is the effective resis-
tance of the load, is less than β, then the transistor is usually driven into saturation,
which means that
iB ∼= vI −VBE(on)

In this case, a collector current is induced that would turn on the motor or the LED,
depending on the type of load.
Equation (5.34) assumes that the B–E voltage can be approximated by the turn-
on voltage. This approximation will be modiﬁed slightly when we discuss bipolar
digital logic circuits in Chapter 17.
EXAMPLE 5.11
Objective: Calculate the appropriate resistance values and transistor power dissipa-
tion for the two inverter switching conﬁgurations shown in Figure 5.45.
Speciﬁcations (Figure 5.45(a)): The transistor in the inverter circuit in Figure
5.45(a) is used to turn the light-emitting diode (LED) on and off. The required LED
current is IC1 = 12 mA to produce the speciﬁed output light. Assume transistor pa-
rameters of β = 80, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VC E (sat) = 0.2 V, and assume the diode
cut-in voltage is Vγ = 1.5 V. [Note: LEDs are fabricated with compound semicon-
ductor materials and have a larger cut-in voltage compared to silicon diodes.]
Speciﬁcations (Figure 5.45(b)): The inverter circuit in Figure 5.45(b) uses a pnp
transistor. In this case, one side of the load (for example a motor) can be connected
to ground potential. The required load current is IC2 = 5 A. Assume transistor para-
meters of β = 40,VE B(on) = 0.7 V, and VEC(sat) = 0.2 V.
Solution (Figure 5.45(a)): For vI1 = 0, transistor Q1 is cut off so that IB1 = IC2 = 0
and the LED is also off.
For vI1 = 5 V, we require IC1 = 12 mA and want the transistor to be driven into
saturation. Then
R1 = V + −(Vγ + VC E(sat))
IC1
= 5 −(1.5 + 0.2)

⇒R1 = 275 
We may let IC1/IB1 = 40. Then IB1 = 12/40 = 0.3 mA. Now
RB1 = vI1 −VBE(on)
IB1

The power dissipation in Q1 is

Solution (Figure 5.45(b)): For vI2 = 12 V, transistor Q2 is cut off so that
IB2 = IC2 = 0 and the voltage across the load is zero.
For vI2 = 0, transistor Q2 is to be driven into saturation so that VEC2 =
VEC(sat) = 0.2 V. The voltage across the load is 11.8 V, the current is 5 A, which
means the effective load resistance is 2.36 
If we let IC2/IB2 = 20, then IB2 = 5/20 = 0.25 A. Now
RB2 = V + −VE B(on) −vI2
IB2
= 12 −0.7 −0
0.25
= 45.2 
The power dissipation in transistor Q2 is
P2 = IB2VE B(on) + IC2VEC(sat) = (0.25)(0.7) + (5)(0.2) = 1.175 W
Comment: As with most electronic circuit designs, there are some assumptions that
need to be made. The assumption to let IC/IB = (1/2)β in each case ensures that
each transistor will be driven into saturation even if variations in circuit parameters
occur. At the same time, base currents are limited to reasonable values.
We may note that for the circuit in Figure 5.45(a), a base current of only 0.3 mA
induces a load current of 12 mA. For the circuit in Figure 5.45(b), a base current of
only 0.25 A induces a load current of 5 A. The advantage of transistor switches is that
large load currents can be switched with relatively small base currents.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.11: (a) Redesign the LED circuit in Figure 5.45(a) such that IC1 = 15 mA and
IC1/IB1 = 50 for vI = 5 V. Use the same Q1 transistor parameters given in Exam-
ple 5.11. (b) Redesign the circuit in Figure 5.45(b) such that IC2 = 2 A and
IC2/IB2 = 25 for vI = 0. Use the same Q2 transistor parameters as given in Exam-
ple 5.11. (Ans. (a) R1 = 220 , RB1 = 14.3 k; (b) RB2 = 141 )
When a transistor is biased in saturation, the relationship between the collector
and base currents is no longer linear. Consequently, this mode of operation cannot be
used for linear ampliﬁers. On the other hand, switching a transistor between cutoff
and saturation produces the greatest change in output voltage, which is especially
useful in digital logic circuits, as we will see in the next section.
Digital Logic
Consider the simple transistor inverter circuit shown in Figure 5.46(a). If the input VI
is approximately zero volts, the transistor is cut off and the output VO is high and
equal to VCC. If, on the other hand, the input is high and equal to VCC, the transistor
can be driven into saturation, in which case the output is low and equal to VC E (sat).
Now consider the case when a second transistor is connected in parallel, as
shown in Figure 5.46(b). When the two inputs are zero, both transistors Q1 and Q2
are in cutoff, and VO = 5 V. When V1 = 5 V and V2 = 0, transistor Q1 can be driven
into saturation, and Q2 remains in cutoff. With Q1 in saturation, the output voltage is
VO = VC E(sat) ∼= 0.2 V. If we reverse the input voltages so that V1 = 0 and V2 = 5 V,
then Q1 is in cutoff, Q2 can be driven into saturation, and VO = VC E(sat) ∼= 0.2 V. If
both inputs are high, meaning V1 = V2 = 5 V, then both transistors can be driven into
saturation, and VO = VC E(sat) ∼= 0.2 V.

Table 5.2 shows these various conditions for the circuit in Figure 5.46(b). In a
positive logic system, meaning that the larger voltage is a logic 1 and the lower volt-
age is a logic 0, this circuit performs the NOR logic function. The circuit of Fig-
ure 5.46(b) is then a two-input bipolar NOR logic circuit.

Comment: In this example, we see that whenever a transistor is conducting, the
ratio of collector current to base current is always less than β. This shows that
the transistor is in saturation, which occurs when either V1 or V2 is 5 V.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.12: The transistor parameters in the circuit in Figure 5.46(b) are: β = 40,
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VC E(sat) = 0.2 V. Let RC = 600  and RB = 950 .
Determine the currents and output voltage for: (a) V1 = V2 = 0; (b) V1 = 5 V,
V2 = 0; and (c) V1 = V2 = 5 V. (Ans. (a) The currents are zero, VO = 5 V;

IB2 = 4.53 mA, IC1 = IC2 = 4 mA = IR/2, VO = 0.2 V)
This example and the accompanying discussion illustrate that bipolar transistor
circuits can be conﬁgured to perform logic functions. In Chapter 17, we will see that
this circuit can experience loading effects when load circuits or other digital logic cir-
cuits are connected to the output. Therefore, logic circuits must be designed to mini-
mize or eliminate such loading effects.
Ampliﬁer
The bipolar inverter circuit can also be used to amplify a time-varying signal. Fig-
ure 5.47(a) shows an inverter circuit including a time-varying voltage source vI in
the base circuit. The voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 5.47(b). The
dc voltage source VBB is used to bias the transistor in the forward-active region. The
Q-point is shown on the transfer characteristics.
The voltage source vI introduces a time-varying signal on the input. A change
in the input voltage then produces a change in the output voltage. These time-varying
input and output signals are shown in Figure 5.47(b). If the magnitude of the slope of
the transfer characteristics is greater than unity, then the time-varying output signal
will be larger than the time-varying input signal—thus an ampliﬁer.

For 0.7 ≤vI ≤1.9 V, the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode and the
output voltage is given by
vO = 7.8 −4vI
Now bias the transistor in the center of the active region with an input voltage of
vI = VBB = 1.3 V. The dc output voltage is vO = 2.6 V. The Q-point is shown on the
transfer characteristics.
AC Solution: From vO = 7.8 −4vI , we can ﬁnd the change in output voltage with
respect to a change in input voltage. We ﬁnd
vO = −4vI
The voltage gain is then
Av = vO
vI
= −4
Computer Simulation: A 2 kHz sinusoidal voltage source was placed in the base
circuit of Figure 5.48(a). The amplitude of the time-varying input signal was 0.2 V.
Figure 5.49 shows the output response of the circuit. A sinusoidal signal is superim-
posed on a dc value as we expect. The peak-to-peak output signal is approximately
1.75 V. The time-varying ampliﬁcation factor is then |Av| = 1.75/(2)(0.2) = 4.37.
This value agrees quite well with the hand analysis.
Comment: As the input voltage changes, we move along the voltage transfer
characteristics as shown in Figure 5.50(b). The negative sign occurs because of the
inverting property of the circuit.

Discussion: In this example, we have biased the transistor in the center of the active
region. If the input signal vI is a sinusoidal function as shown in Figure 5.50(b),
then the output signal vO is also a sinusoidal signal, which is the desired response
for an analog circuit. (This assumes the magnitude of the sinusoidal input signal is
not too large.) If the Q-point, or dc biasing, of the transistor were at vI = 1.9 V and
vO = 0.2 V, as in Figure 5.50(c), the output response changes. Shown in the ﬁgure is
a symmetrical sinusoidal input signal. When the input sinusoidal signal is on its pos-
itive cycle, the transistor remains biased in saturation and the output voltage does not
change. During the negative half of the input signal, the transistor becomes biased in
the active region, so a half sinusoidal output response is produced. The output signal
is obviously not a replication of the input signal.
This discussion emphasizes the importance of properly biasing the transistor for
analog or ampliﬁer applications. The primary objective of this chapter, as stated pre-
viously, is to help readers become familiar with transistor circuits, but it is also to en-
able them to design the dc biasing of transistor circuits that are to be used in analog
applications.

the voltage ampliﬁcation is vO/vI = −6.5. Let RB = 80 k, and assume
β = 120 and VBE(on) = 0.7 V. Determine the Q-point values such that the tran-
sistor is biased in the center of the active region. (Ans. For Q-point: vO = 2.6 V,
vI = 1.069 V, IBQ = 4.61 μA; RC = 4.34 k)
The small-signal linear ampliﬁer analysis and design are the primary objectives of
the next chapter.

BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR BIASING
Objective: • Investigate various biasing schemes of bipolar transistor
circuits, including bias-stable biasing and integrated circuit biasing.
As mentioned in the previous section, in order to create a linear ampliﬁer, we must
keep the transistor in the forward-active mode, establish a Q-point near the center of
the load line, and couple the time-varying input signal to the base. The circuit in Fig-
ure 5.47(a) may be impractical for two reasons: (1) the signal source is not connected

Chapter 5 The Bipolar Junction Transistor
331
to ground, and (2) there may be situations where we do not want a dc base current
ﬂowing through the signal source. In this section, we will examine several alternative
biasing schemes. These basic biasing circuits illustrate some desirable and some un-
desirable biasing characteristics. More sophisticated biasing circuits that use addi-
tional transistors and that are used in integrated circuits are discussed in Chapter 10.
Single Base Resistor Biasing
The circuit shown in Figure 5.51(a) is one of the simplest transistor circuits. There
is a single dc power supply, and the quiescent base current is established through the
resistor RB. The coupling capacitor CC acts as an open circuit to dc, isolating
the signal source from the dc base current. If the frequency of the input signal is large
enough and CC is large enough, the signal can be coupled through CC to the base
with little attenuation. Typical values of CC are generally in the range of 1 to 10 μF,
although the actual value depends upon the frequency range of interest (see
Chapter 7). Figure 5.51(b) is the dc equivalent circuit; the Q-point values are indi-
cated by the additional subscript Q.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 5.14
Objective: Design a circuit with a single-base resistor to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 5.51(b).
The circuit is to be biased with VCC = +12 V. The transistor quiescent values are to
be IC Q = 1 mA and VC E Q = 6 V.
Choices: The transistor used in the design has nominal values of β = 100 and
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, but the current gain for this type of transistor is assumed to be in
the range 50 ≤β ≤150 because of fairly wide fabrication tolerances. We will as-
sume, in this example, that the designed resistor values are available.

The various Q-points are plotted on the load line shown in Figure 5.52(b). In this ﬁg-
ure, the collector current scale and load line are ﬁxed. The base current scale changes
as β changes.
Comment: In this circuit conﬁguration with a single base resistor, the Q-point is not
stabilized against variations in β; as β changes, the Q-point varies signiﬁcantly. In
our discussion of the ampliﬁer in Example 5.13 (see Figure 5.50), we noted the
importance of the placement of the Q-point. In the following two examples, we will
analyze and design bias-stable circuits.
Although a value of 1.13 M for RB will establish the required base current, this
resistance is too large to be used in integrated circuits. The following two examples
will also demonstrate a circuit design to alleviate this problem.

between 75 and 150, determine a new value of RC such that the Q-point will always
be in the range 1 ≤VC E Q ≤4 V. What will be the actual range of VC E Q for the new
value of RC? (Ans. For VC E Q = 2.5 V, RC = 4.14 k; (b) 1.66 ≤VC E Q ≤3.33 V)
Voltage Divider Biasing and Bias Stability
The circuit in Figure 5.54(a) is a classic example of discrete transistor biasing.
(IC biasing is different and will be discussed in Chapter 10.) The single bias resistor
RB in the previous circuit is replaced by a pair of resistors R1 and R2, and an emitter
resistor RE is added. The ac signal is still coupled to the base of the transistor through
the coupling capacitor CC.
The circuit is most easily analyzed by forming a Thevenin equivalent circuit
for the base circuit. The coupling capacitor acts as an open circuit to dc. The equiva-
lent Thevenin voltage is
VT H = [R2/(R1 + R2)]VCC
and the equivalent Thevenin resistance is
RT H = R1∥R2

where the symbol ∥indicates the parallel combination of resistors. Figure 5.54(b)

previously considered.
Applying Kirchhoff’s law around the B–E loop, we obtain
VT H = IBQ RT H + VBE(on) + IE Q RE
(5.37)
If the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, then

Writing the Kirchhoff voltage law equation around the B–E loop, we obtain
IBQ =
VT H −VBE(on)
RT H + (1 + β)RE
=
1.79 −0.7
10 + (101)(0.4) ⇒21.6 μA
The collector current is
IC Q = βIBQ = (100)(21.6 μA) ⇒2.16 mA
and the emitter current is
IE Q = (1 + β)IBQ = (101)(21.6 μA) ⇒2.18 mA
The quiescent C–E voltage is then
VC E Q = VCC −IC Q RC −IE Q RE = 10 −(2.16)(2) −(2.18)(0.4) = 4.81 V
These results show that the transistor is biased in the active region.
If the current gain of the transistor were to decrease to β = 50 or increase to
β = 150, we obtain the following results:
The load line and Q-points are plotted in Figure 5.55. The variation in Q-points for
this circuit conﬁguration is to be compared with the variation in Q-point values
shown previously in Figure 5.52(b).
For a 3 : 1 ratio in β, the collector current and collector–emitter voltage change
by only a 1.29 : 1 ratio.
Comment: The voltage divider circuit of R1 and R2 can bias the transistor in its ac-
tive region using resistor values in the low kilohm range. In contrast, single resistor
biasing requires a resistor in the megohm range. In addition, the change in IC Q and
VC E Q with a change in β has been substantially reduced compared to the change
shown in Figure 5.52(b). Including an emitter resistor RE has tended to stabilize the
Q-point. This means that including the emitter resistor helps to stabilize the Q-point
with respect to variations in β. Including the resistor RE introduces negative feed-
back, as we will see in Chapter 12. Negative feedback tends to stabilize circuits.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.15: For the circuit shown in Figure 5.54(a), let VCC = 3.3 V, RE = 500 ,
RC = 4 k, R1 = 85 k, R2 = 35 k, and β = 150. (a) Determine RT H and VT H.
(b) Find IBQ, IC Q, and VC E Q. (c) Repeat part (b) for β = 75. (Ans. (a) RT H =
24.8 k, VT H = 0.9625 V; (b) IBQ = 2.62 μA, IC Q = 0.393 mA, VC E Q = 1.53 V;
(c) IBQ = 4.18 μA, IC Q = 0.314 mA, VC E Q = 1.89 V)
Considering Equation (5.39), the design requirement for bias stability is
RT H ≪(1 + β)RE . Consequently, the collector current is approximately
IC Q ∼= β(VT H −VBE(on))
(1 + β)RE
(5.40)
Normally, β ≫1; therefore, β/(1 + β) ∼= 1, and
IC Q ∼= (VT H −VBE(on))
RE
(5.41)
Now the quiescent collector current is essentially a function of only the dc volt-
ages and the emitter resistance, and the Q-point is stabilized against β variations.
However, if RT H is too small, then R1 and R2 are small, and excessive power is dis-
sipated in these resistors. The general rule is that a circuit is considered bias stable
when
RT H ∼= 0.1(1 + β)RE
(5.42)
DESIGN EXAMPLE 5.16
Objective: Design a bias-stable circuit to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 5.54(a).
Let VCC = 5 V and RC = 1 k. Choose RE and determine the bias resistors R1 and
R2 such that the circuit is considered bias stable and that VC E Q = 3 V.
Choices: Assume the transistor has nominal values of β = 120 and VBE(on) =
0.7 V. We will choose standard resistor values and will assume that the transistor cur-
rent gain varies over the range 60 ≤β ≤180.
Design Pointer: Typically, the voltage across RE should be on the same order of
magnitude as VBE(on). Larger voltage drops may mean the supply voltage VCC has
to be increased in order to obtain the required voltage across the collector-emitter and
across RC.
Solution: With β = 120, IC Q ≈IE Q. Then, choosing a standard value of 0.51 k
for RE, we ﬁnd
IC Q ∼= VCC −VC E Q
RC + RE
=
5 −3
1 + 0.51 = 1.32 mA
The voltage drop across RE is now (1.32)(0.51) = 0.673 V, which is approximately
the desired value. The base current is found to be
IBQ = IC Q
β

Using the Thevenin equivalent circuit in Figure 5.54(b), we ﬁnd
IBQ =

RT H + (1 + β)RE
For a bias-stable circuit, RT H = 0.1(1 + β)RE , or
RT H = (0.1)(121)(0.51) = 6.17 k
Then,
IBQ = 11.0 μA ⇒
VT H −0.7

R1 = 21.3 k
and
R2 = 8.69 k
From Appendix C, we can choose standard resistor values of R1 = 20 k and
R2 = 8.2 k.
Trade-offs: We will neglect, in this example, the tolerance effects of the resistors
(end-of-chapter problems such as Problems 5.18 and 5.40 do include tolerance ef-
fects). We will consider the effect on the transistor Q-point values of the common-
emitter current gain variation.
Using the standard resistor values, we have

and the resulting transistor Q-point values are shown. The collector–emitter voltage
is VC E = 2.80 V, which is close to the design value of 3 V. One reason for the differ-
ence is that the standard-valued resistors are not exactly equal to the design values.
Another reason for the slight difference is that the effective β of the 2N2222 is 157

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 5.16: In the circuit shown in Figure 5.54(a), let VCC = 5 V, RE = 0.2 k,
RC = 1 k, β = 150, and VBE(on) = 0.7 V. Design a bias-stable circuit such that
the Q-point is in the center of the load line. (Ans. R1 = 13 k, R2 = 3.93 k)
Another advantage of including an emitter resistor is that it stabilizes the
Q-point with respect to temperature. To explain, we noted in Figure 1.20 that the
current in a pn junction increases with increasing temperature, for a constant junc-
tion voltage. We then expect the transistor current to increase as the temperature
increases. If the current in a junction increases, the junction temperature increases
(because of I 2R heating), which in turn causes the current to increase, thereby fur-
ther increasing the junction temperature. This phenomenon can lead to thermal
runaway and to device destruction. However, from Figure 5.54(b), we see that as
the current increases, the voltage drop across RE increases. The Thevenin equiva-
lent voltage and resistance are assumed to be essentially independent of tempera-
ture, and the temperature-induced change in the voltage drop across RT H will be
small. The net result is that the increased voltage drop across RE reduces the B–E
junction voltage, which then tends to stabilize the transistor current against in-
creases in temperature.

Positive and Negative Voltage Biasing
There are applications in which biasing a transistor with both positive and negative
dc voltages is desirable. We will see this especially in Chapter 11 when we are dis-
cussing the differential ampliﬁer. Biasing with dual supplies allows us, in some ap-
plications, to eliminate the coupling capacitor and allows dc input voltages as input
signals. The following example demonstrates this biasing scheme.

Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 5.57(a).

For IC Q = 0.5 mA, then IBQ = 0.00625 mA so we can write

We ﬁnd R1 = 18.0 k. Then, from RT H = R1∥R2 = 16.2 k, we ﬁnd R2 = 162 k.
For IC Q = 0.5 mA, then IE Q = 0.506 mA. The KVL equation around the E–C
loop yields
V + = IE Q RE + VEC Q + IC Q RC + V −
or
9 = (0.506)(2) + 7 + (0.50)RC + (−9)
which yields
RC ∼= 20 k
Trade-offs: All resistor values are standard values except for R2 = 162 k. A stan-
dard discrete value of 160 k is available. However, because of the bias-stable de-
sign, the Q-point will not change signiﬁcantly. The change in Q-point values with a
change in transistor current gain β is considered in end-of-chapter problems such as
Problems 5.31 and 5.34.
Comment: In many cases, speciﬁcations such as a collector current level or an
emitter–collector voltage value are not absolute, but are given as approximate values.
For this reason, the emitter resistor, for example, is determined to be 2 k, which is
a standard discrete resistor value. The ﬁnal bias resistor values are also chosen to be
standard values. However, these small changes compared to the calculated resistor
values will not change the Q-point values signiﬁcantly.

Integrated Circuit Biasing
The resistor biasing of transistor circuits considered up to this point is primarily
applied to discrete circuits. For integrated circuits, we would like to eliminate as
many resistors as possible since, in general, they require a larger surface area than
transistors.
A bipolar transistor can be biased by using a constant-current source IQ, as
shown in Figure 5.59. The advantages of this circuit are that the emitter current is
independent of β and RB, and the collector current and C–E voltage are essentially
independent of transistor current gain, for reasonable values of β. The value of RB
can be increased, thus increasing the input resistance at the base, without jeopardiz-
ing the bias stability.
The constant current source can be implemented by using transistors as shown
in Figure 5.60. The transistor Q1 is a diode-connected transistor, but still operates in
the forward-active mode. The transistor Q2 must also operate in the forward-active
mode (VC E ≥VBE(on)).
Current I1 is called the reference current and is found by writing Kirchhoff’s
voltage law equation around the R1–Q1 loop. We have
0 = I1R1 + VBE (on) + V −
(5.43(a))
which yields
I1 = −(V −+ VBE (on))
R1
(5.43(b))
Since VBE1 = VBE2, the circuit mirrors the reference current in the left branch into
the right branch. The circuit of R1, Q1, and Q2 is then referred to as a current mirror.
Summing the currents at the collector of Q1 gives
I1 = IC1 + IB1 + IB2

The B–E voltages of Q1 and Q2 are equal. If Q1 and Q2 are identical transistors and
are held at the same temperature, then IB1 = IB2 and IC1 = IC2. Equation (5.44) can

V −= −3.3 V, and RB = 0. The transistor parameters are β = 60 and VBE(on) =
0.7 V. Design the circuit such that IC Q(QO) = 0.12 mA and VC E Q(QO) = 1.6 V.
What are the values of IQ and I1? (Ans. IQ = 0.122 mA, I1 = 0.126 mA,
R1 = 20.6 k, RC = 20 k)
As mentioned, constant-current biasing is used almost exclusively in integrated
circuits. As we will see in Part 2 of the text, circuits in integrated circuits use a min-
imum number of resistors, and transistors are often used to replace these resistors.
Transistors take up much less area than resistors on an IC chip, so it’s advantageous
to minimize the number of resistors.

which can be solved for VC1 to yield

To ﬁnd VE2, we have
VE2 = VC1 + VE B(on) = −0.482 + 0.7 = 0.218 V

The remaining nodal voltages are

and
VC2 = IC2RC2 −5 = (2.37)(1.5) −5 = −1.45 V
We then ﬁnd that
VC E1 = VC1 −VE1 = −0.482 −(−2.74) = 2.26 V
and that
VEC2 = VE2 −VC2 = 0.218 −(−1.45) = 1.67 V
Comment: These results show that both Q1 and Q2 are biased in the forward-active
mode, as originally assumed. However, when we consider the ac operation of this cir-
cuit as an ampliﬁer in the next chapter, we will see that a better design would increase
the value of VEC2.

Comment: By neglecting base currents, the design of this circuit is straightforward.
A computer analysis using PSpice, for example, will verify the design or show that
small changes need to be made to meet the design speciﬁcations. 
We will see the cascode circuit again in Section 6.9.3 of the next chapter.
One advantage of the cascode circuit will be determined in Chapter 7. The cas-
code circuit has a larger bandwidth than just a simple common-emitter ampliﬁer.

DESIGN APPLICATION: DIODE 
THERMOMETER WITH A BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR
Objective: • Incorporate a bipolar transistor in a design application that
enhances the simple diode thermometer design discussed in Chapter 1.
Speciﬁcations: The electronic thermometer is to operate over a temperature range
of 0 to 100 °F.
Design Approach: The output-diode voltage developed in the diode thermometer
in Figure 1.48 is to be applied to the base–emitter junction of an npn bipolar trans-
istor to enhance the voltage over the temperature range. The bipolar transistor will be
held at a constant temperature.
Choices: Assume an npn bipolar transistor with IS = 10−12 A is available.
Solution: From the design in Chapter 1, the diode voltage is given by
VD = 1.12 −0.522

where T is in kelvins.

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 5.64. We assume that the diode is in a vari-
able temperature environment while the rest of the circuit is held at room tempera-
ture. Neglecting the bipolar transistor base current, we have
VD = VBE + IC RE
(5.49)
We can write
IC = ISeVBE/VT

Comment: Figure 5.65(a) shows the diode voltage versus temperature and Fig-
ure 5.65(b) now shows the output voltage versus temperature from the bipolar transis-
tor circuit. We can see that the transistor circuit provides a voltage gain. This voltage
gain is the desired characteristic of the transistor circuit.
Discussion: We can see from the equations that the collector current is not a linear
function of the base–emitter voltage or diode voltage. This effect implies that the
transistor output voltage is also not exactly a linear function of temperature. The line
drawn in Figure 5.65(b) is a good linear approximation. We will obtain a better cir-
cuit design using operational ampliﬁers in Chapter 9.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, we considered the structure, characteristics, and properties of the
bipolar transistor. Both npn and pnp complementary bipolar transistors can be
formed. The deﬁning transistor action is that the voltage across two terminals
(base and emitter) controls the current in the third terminal (collector).
•
The four modes of operation are: forward-active, cutoff, saturation, and inverse-
active. In the forward-active mode, the B–E junction is forward biased, the B–C
junction is reverse biased, and the collector and base currents are related by the
common-emitter current gain β. When the transistor is cut off, all currents are
zero. In the saturation mode, the collector current is no longer a function of base
current.
•
The dc analysis and design techniques of bipolar transistor circuits were empha-
sized in this chapter. We continued to use the piecewise linear model of the pn
junction in these analyses and designs. Techniques to design a transistor circuit
with a stable Q-point were developed.
•
An introduction to dc biasing of integrated circuits using constant current cir-
cuits was presented.

Chapter
In the previous chapter, we described the structure and operation of the bipolar junc-
tion transistor, and analyzed and designed the dc response of circuits containing these
devices. In this chapter, we emphasize the use of the bipolar transistor in linear am-
pliﬁer applications. Linear ampliﬁers imply that, for the most part, we are dealing
with analog signals. The magnitude of an analog signal may have any value, within
limits, and may vary continuously with respect to time. A linear ampliﬁer then means
that the output signal is equal to the input signal multiplied by a constant, where the
magnitude of the constant of proportionality is, in general, greater than unity.
PREVIEW
In this chapter, we will:
•
Investigate the process by which a transistor circuit can amplify a small, time-
varying input signal, and develop the small-signal models of the transistor
that are used in the analysis of linear ampliﬁers.
•
Discuss the three basic transistor ampliﬁer conﬁgurations.
•
Analyze the common-emitter ampliﬁer and become familiar with the general
characteristics of this circuit.
•
Understand the concept of the ac load line and determine the maximum sym-
metrical swing of the output signal.
•
Analyze the emitter-follower ampliﬁer and become familiar with the general
characteristics of this circuit.
•
Analyze the common-base ampliﬁer and become familiar with the general
characteristics of this circuit.
•
Compare the general characteristics of the three basic ampliﬁer conﬁgurations.
•
Analyze multitransistor or multistage ampliﬁers and understand the advan-
tages of these circuits over single-transistor circuits.
•
Understand the concept of signal power gain in an ampliﬁer circuit.
•
As an application, incorporate bipolar transistors in a design of a multistage
ampliﬁer circuit conﬁguration to provide a speciﬁed output signal power.

ANALOG SIGNALS AND LINEAR AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Understand the concept of an analog signal and the
principle of a linear ampliﬁer.
In this chapter, we will be considering signals, analog circuits, and ampliﬁers. A
signal contains some type of information.  For example, sound waves produced by
a speaking human contain the information the person is conveying to another
person.  A sound wave is an analog signal. The magnitude of an analog signal can
take on any value, within limits, and may vary continuously with time. Electronic
circuits that process analog signals are called analog circuits. One example of an
analog circuit is a linear ampliﬁer. A linear ampliﬁer magniﬁes an input signal and
produces an output signal whose magnitude is larger and directly proportional to the
input signal.
Time-varying signals from a particular source very often need to be ampliﬁed
before the signal is capable of being “useful.” For example, Figure 6.1 shows a sig-
nal source that may be the output of a microphone. The output of the microphone will
need to be ampliﬁed in order to drive the speakers at the output. The ampliﬁer is the
circuit that performs this function. A dc voltage source is also an input to the ampli-
ﬁer. The ampliﬁer contains transistors that must be biased so that the transistors can
act as amplifying devices.
In this chapter, we analyze and design linear ampliﬁers that use bipolar transis-
tors as the amplifying device. The term small-signal means that we can linearize the
ac equivalent circuit. We will deﬁne what is meant by small signal in the case of BJT
circuits. The term linear ampliﬁer means that we can use superposition so that the dc
analysis and ac analysis of the circuits can be performed separately and the total re-
sponse is the sum of the two individual responses.
The mechanism by which BJT circuits amplify small time-varying signals was
introduced in the last chapter. In this section, we will expand that discussion, using
the graphical technique, dc load line, and ac load line. In the process, we will develop
the various small-signal parameters of linear circuits and the corresponding equiva-
lent circuits.
Figure 6.1 suggests that there are two types of analyses of the ampliﬁer that we
must consider. The ﬁrst is a dc analysis because of the applied dc voltage source, and
the second is a time-varying or ac analysis because of the time-varying signal source.

A linear ampliﬁer means that the superposition principle applies. The principle of
superposition states: The response of a linear circuit excited by multiple independent
input signals is the sum of the responses of the circuit to each of the input signals
alone.
For the linear ampliﬁer, then, the dc analysis can be performed with the ac
source set to zero. This analysis, called a large signal analysis, establishes the
Q-point of the transistors in the ampliﬁer. This analysis and design was the primary
objective of the previous chapter. The ac analysis, called a small-signal analysis, can
be performed with the dc source set to zero. The total response of the ampliﬁer cir-
cuit is the sum of the two individual responses.

THE BIPOLAR LINEAR AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Investigate the process by which a single-transistor cir-
cuit can amplify a small, time-varying input signal and develop the
small-signal models of the transistor that are used in the analysis of
linear ampliﬁers.
The transistor is the heart of an ampliﬁer. In this chapter, we will consider bipolar
transistor ampliﬁers. Bipolar transistors have traditionally been used in linear ampli-
ﬁer circuits because of their relatively high gain.
We begin our discussion by considering the same bipolar circuit that was dis-
cussed in the last chapter. Figure 6.2(a) shows the circuit where the input signal vI
contains both a dc and an ac signal. Figure 6.2(b) shows the same circuit where VBB
is a dc voltage to bias the transistor at a particular Q-point and vs is the ac signal that
is to be ampliﬁed. Figure 6.2(c) shows the voltage transfer characteristics that were

developed in Chapter 5. To use the circuit as an ampliﬁer, the transistor needs to be
biased with a dc voltage at a quiescent point (Q-point), as shown in the ﬁgure, such
that the transistor is biased in the forward-active region. This dc analysis or design of
the circuit was the focus of our attention in Chapter 5. If a time-varying (e.g., sinu-
soidal) signal is superimposed on the dc input voltage, VBB, the output voltage will
change along the transfer curve producing a time-varying output voltage. If the time-
varying output voltage is directly proportional to and larger than the time-varying
input voltage, then the circuit is a linear ampliﬁer. From this ﬁgure, we see that if the
transistor is not biased in the active region (biased either in cutoff or saturation), the
output voltage does not change with a change in the input voltage. Thus, we no
longer have an ampliﬁer.
In this chapter, we are interested in the ac analysis and design of bipolar transis-
tor ampliﬁers, which means that we must determine the relationships between the
time-varying output and input signals. We will initially consider a graphical tech-
nique that can provide an intuitive insight into the basic operation of the circuit. We
will then develop a small-signal equivalent circuit that will be used in the mathe-
matical analysis of the ac signals. In general, we will be considering a steady-state,
sinusoidal analysis of circuits. We will assume that any time-varying signal can be
written as a sum of sinusoidal signals of different frequencies and amplitudes
(Fourier series), so that a sinusoidal analysis is appropriate.
We will be dealing with time-varying as well as dc currents and voltages in this
chapter. Table 6.1 gives a summary of notation that will be used. This notation was
discussed in the Prologue, but is repeated here for convenience. A lowercase letter
with an uppercase subscript, such as iB or vBE, indicates total instantaneous values.
An uppercase letter with an uppercase subscript, such as IB or VBE, indicates dc
quantities. A lowercase letter with a lowercase subscript, such as ib or vbe, indicates
instantaneous values of ac signals. Finally, an uppercase letter with a lowercase
subscript, such as Ib or Vbe, indicates phasor quantities. The phasor notation, which
was reviewed in the Prologue becomes especially important in Chapter 7 during the
discussion of frequency response. However, the phasor notation will be generally
used in this chapter in order to be consistent with the overall ac analysis.
Graphical Analysis and ac Equivalent Circuit
Figure 6.3 shows the same basic bipolar inverter circuit that has been discussed, but
now includes a sinusoidal signal source in series with the dc source as was shown in
Figure 6.2(b).

Figure 6.4 Common-emitter transistor characteristics, dc load
line, and sinusoidal variation in base current, collector current,
and collector–emitter voltage
Figure 6.4 shows the transistor characteristics, the dc load line, and the Q-point.
The sinusoidal signal source, vs, will produce a time-varying or ac base current
superimposed on the quiescent base current as shown in the ﬁgure. The time-varying
base current will induce an ac collector current superimposed on the quiescent col-
lector current. The ac collector current then produces a time-varying voltage across
RC, which induces an ac collector–emitter voltage as shown in the ﬁgure. The ac
collector–emitter voltage, or output voltage, in general, will be larger than the sinu-
soidal input signal, so that the circuit has produced signal ampliﬁcation—that is, the
circuit is an ampliﬁer.
We need to develop a mathematical method or model for determining the
relationships between the sinusoidal variations in currents and voltages in the cir-
cuit. As already mentioned, a linear ampliﬁer implies that superposition applies so
that the dc and ac analyses can be performed separately. To obtain a linear ampli-
ﬁer, the time-varying or ac currents and voltages must be small enough to ensure
a linear relation between the ac signals. To meet this objective, the time-varying
signals are assumed to be small signals, which means that the amplitudes of the ac
signals are small enough to yield linear relations. The concept of “small enough,”
or small signal, will be discussed further as we develop the small-signal equivalent
circuits.
A time-varying signal source, vs, in the base of the circuit in Figure 6.3 gener-
ates a time-varying component of base current, which implies there is also a time-
varying component of base–emitter voltage. Figure 6.5 shows the exponential
relationship between base-current and base–emitter voltage. If the magnitudes of
the time-varying signals that are superimposed on the dc quiescent point are small,
then we can develop a linear relationship between the ac base–emitter voltage
and ac base current. This relationship corresponds to the slope of the curve at the
Q-point.

Small Signal
Using Figure 6.5, we can now determine one quantitative deﬁnition of small signal.
From the discussion in Chapter 5, in particular, Equation (5.6), the relation between
base–emitter voltage and base current can be written as
iB = IS

The term [IS/β] · exp(VBE Q/VT ) is the quiescent base current, so we can write
iB = IBQ · exp
vbe

(6.3)
The base current, given in this form, is not linear and cannot be written as an ac
current superimposed on a dc quiescent value. However, if vbe ≪VT , then we can
expand the exponential term in a Taylor series, keeping only the linear term. This
approximation is what is meant by small signal. We then have

(6.4(b))
The sinusoidal base current, ib, is linearly related to the sinusoidal base–emitter volt-
age, vbe. In this case, the term small-signal refers to the condition in which vbe is
sufﬁciently small for the linear relationships between ib and vbe given by Equa-
tion (6.4(b)) to be valid. As a general rule, if vbe is less than l0 mV, then the expo-
nential relation given by Equation (6.3) and its linear expansion in Equation (6.4(a))
agree within approximately 10 percent. Ensuring that vbe < 10 mV is another useful
rule of thumb in the design of linear bipolar transistor ampliﬁers.
If the vbe signal is assumed to be sinusoidal, but if its magnitude becomes
too large, then the output signal will no longer be a pure sinusoidal voltage but will
become distorted and contain harmonics (see box “Harmonic Distortion”).
Harmonic Distortion
If an input sinusoidal signal becomes too large, the output signal may no longer
be a pure sinusoidal signal because of nonlinear effects. A nonsinusoidal output
signal may be expanded into a Fourier series and written in the form
vO(t) = VO + V1 sin(ωt + φ1) + V2 sin(2ωt + φ2) + V3 sin(3ωt + φ3) + · · ·

We see that as (Vπ/VT ) increases, the second and third harmonic terms become

total harmonic distortion value may seem excessive, but as we will see later in
Chapter 12, distortion can be reduced when feedback circuits are used.

The AC Equivalent Circuit
From the concept of small signal, all the time-varying signals shown in Figure 6.4
will be linearly related and are superimposed on dc values. We can write (refer to no-
tation given in Table 6.1)
iB = IBQ + ib
(6.13(a))
iC = IC Q + ic
(6.13(b))
vC E = VC E Q + vce
(6.13(c))
and
vBE = VBE Q + vbe
(6.13(d))
The Base–Emitter Loop: If the signal source, vs, is zero, then the base-emitter loop
equation is
VBB = IBQ RB + VBE Q
(6.14)
Taking into account the time-varying signals, we ﬁnd the base–emitter loop
equation is
VBB + vs = iB RB + vBE
(6.15(a))
or
VBB + vs = (IBQ + ib)RB + (VBE Q + vbe)
(6.15(b))
Rearranging terms, we ﬁnd
VBB −IBQ RB −VBE Q = ibRB + vbe −vs
(6.15(c))
From Equation (6.14), we see that the left side of Equation (6.15(c)) is zero. Equa-
tion (6.15(c)) can then be written as
vs = ibRB + vbe
(6.16)
which is the base-emitter loop equation with all dc term effectively set equal to zero.
The Collector–Emitter Loop: Again, if the signal source, vs, is zero, then the collec-
tor-emitter loop equation is
VCC = IC Q RC + VC E Q
(6.17)
Taking into account the time-varying signals, the collector-emitter loop equation be-
comes
VCC = iC RC + vC E = (IC Q + ic)RC + (VC E Q + vce)
(6.18(a))
Rearranging terms, we ﬁnd
VCC −IC Q RC −VC E Q = icRC + vce
(6.18(b))
From Equation (6.17), we see that the left side of Equation (6.18(b)) is zero. Equa-
tion (6.18(b)) can be written as
icRC + vce = 0
(6.19)
which is the collector–emitter loop equation with all dc terms set equal to zero.
Equations (6.16) and (6.19) relate the ac parameters in the circuit. These equa-
tions can be obtained directly by setting all dc currents and voltages equal to zero, so
the dc voltage sources become short circuits and any dc current sources would

become open circuits. These results are a direct consequence of applying superposi-
tion to a linear circuit. The resulting BJT circuit, shown in Figure 6.7, is called the
ac equivalent circuit, and all currents and voltages shown are time-varying signals.
We should stress that this circuit is an equivalent circuit. We are implicitly assuming
that the transistor is still biased in the forward-active region with the appropriate dc
voltages and currents.
Another way of looking at the ac equivalent circuit is as follows. In the circuit in
Figure 6.3, the base and collector currents are composed of ac signals superimposed
on dc values. These currents ﬂow through the VBB and VCC voltage sources, respec-
tively. Since the voltages across these sources are assumed to remain constant, the
sinusoidal currents do not produce any sinusoidal voltages across these elements.
Then, since the sinusoidal voltages are zero, the equivalent ac impedances are zero,
or short circuits. In other words, the dc voltage sources are ac short circuits in an
equivalent ac circuit. We say that the node connecting RC and VCC is at signal ground.
Small-Signal Hybrid-π Equivalent
Circuit of the Bipolar Transistor
We developed the ac equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6.7. We now need to develop
a small-signal equivalent circuit for the transistor. One such circuit is the hybrid-π
model, which is closely related to the physics of the transistor. This effect will be-
come more apparent in Chapter 7 when a more detailed hybrid-π model is developed
to take into account the frequency response of the transistor.
We can treat the bipolar transistor as a two-port network as shown in Figure 6.8.
The input port is between the base and emitter, and the output port is between the
collector and emitter.
Input Base–Emitter Port
One element of the hybrid-π model has already been described. Figure 6.5 showed
the base current versus base–emitter voltage characteristic, with small time-varying
signals superimposed at the Q-point. Since the sinusoidal signals are small, we can
treat the slope at the Q-point as a constant, which has units of conductance. The in-
verse of this conductance is the small-signal resistance deﬁned as rπ. We can then re-
late the small-signal input base current to the small-signal input voltage by
vbe = ibrπ

The resistance rπ is called the diffusion resistance or base–emitter input resistance.
We see that rπ is a function of the Q-point parameters. Note that this is the same
expression obtained in Equation (6.4(b)).
Output Collector–Emitter Port
We can consider the output terminal characteristics of the bipolar transistor. If we
initially consider the case in which the output collector current is independent of
the collector–emitter voltage, then the collector current is a function only of the
base–emitter voltage, as discussed in Chapter 5. We can then write

The term IS exp(vBE/VT ) evaluated at the Q-point is just the quiescent collector cur-
rent. The term IC Q/VT is a conductance. Since this conductance relates a current in the
collector to a voltage in the B–E circuit, the parameter is called a transconductance
and is written
gm = IC Q
VT
(6.26)
We can then write the small-signal collector current as
ic = gmυbe
(6.27)
The small-signal transconductance is also a function of the Q-point parameters and
is directly proportional to the dc bias current. The variation of transconductance with
quiescent collector current will prove to be useful in ampliﬁer design.

Using these new parameters, we can develop a simpliﬁed small-signal hybrid-π
equivalent circuit for the npn bipolar transistor, as shown in Figure 6.9. The phasor
components are given in parentheses. This circuit can be inserted into the ac equiva-
lent circuit previously shown in Figure 6.7.

also be inserted in the ac equivalent circuit given in Figure 6.7. Either equivalent

Common-Emitter Current Gain
The common-emitter current gain deﬁned in Equation (6.28(c)) is actually deﬁned
as an ac beta and does not include dc leakage currents. We discussed the common-
emitter current gain in Chapter 5. We deﬁned a dc beta as the ratio of a dc collector
current to the corresponding dc base current. In this case leakage currents are in-
cluded. However, we will assume in this text that leakage currents are negligible so
that the two deﬁnitions of beta are equivalent.
The small-signal hybrid-π parameters rπ and gm were deﬁned in Equations (6.22)
and (6.26). If we multiply rπ and gm, we ﬁnd
rπgm =

(6.30)
In general, we will assume that the common-emitter current gain β is a constant for
a given transistor. However, we must keep in mind that β may vary from one device
to another and that β does vary with collector current. This variation with IC will be
speciﬁed on data sheets for speciﬁc discrete transistors.
Small-Signal Voltage Gain
Continuing our discussion of equivalent circuits, we may now insert the bipolar,
equivalent circuit in Figure 6.9, for example, into the ac equivalent circuit in Fig-
ure 6.7. The result is shown in Figure 6.11. Note that we are using the phasor
notation. When incorporating the small-signal hybrid-π model of the transistor
(Figure 6.9) into the ac equivalent circuit (Figure 6.7), it is generally helpful to start
with the three terminals of the transistor as shown in Figure 6.11. Then sketch the
hybrid-π equivalent circuit between these three terminals. Finally, connect the
remaining circuit elements, such as RB and RC, to the transistor terminals. As the cir-
cuits become more complex, this technique will minimize errors in developing the
small-signal equivalent circuit.
The small-signal voltage gain, Av = Vo/Vs, of the circuit is deﬁned as the ratio
of output signal voltage to input signal voltage. We may note a new variable in Figure
6.11. The conventional phasor notation for the small-signal base-emitter voltage is
Vπ, called the control voltage. The dependent current source is then given by gmVπ.
The dependent current gmVπ ﬂows through RC, producing a negative collector–emitter
voltage, or

Figure 6.12 shows the various currents and voltages in the circuit. These include the
sinusoidal signals superimposed on the dc values. Figure 6.12(a) shows the sinusoidal
input voltage, and Figure 6.12(b) shows the sinusoidal base current superimposed on
the quiescent value. The sinusoidal collector current superimposed on the dc quies-
cent value is shown in Figure 6.12(c). Note that, as the base current increases, the
collector current increases.
Figure 6.12(d) shows the sinusoidal component of the C–E voltage superim-
posed on the quiescent value. As the collector current increases, the voltage drop
across RC increases so that the C–E voltage decreases. Consequently, the sinusoidal
component of the output voltage is 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the
input signal voltage. The minus sign in the voltage gain expression represents this
180-degree phase shift. In summary, the signal was both ampliﬁed and inverted by
this ampliﬁer.
Analysis Method: To summarize, the analysis of a BJT ampliﬁer proceeds as shown
in the box “Problem Solving Method: Bipolar AC Analysis.”

Problem-Solving Technique: Bipolar AC Analysis
Since we are dealing with linear ampliﬁer circuits, superposition applies, which
means that we can perform the dc and ac analyses separately. The analysis of the
BJT ampliﬁer proceeds as follows:
1.
Analyze the circuit with only the dc sources present. This solution is the dc or
quiescent solution, which uses the dc signal models for the elements, as listed
in Table 6.2. The transistor must be biased in the forward-active region in
order to produce a linear ampliﬁer.
2.
Replace each element in the circuit with its small-signal model, as shown in
Table 6.2. The small-signal hybrid-π model applies to the transistor although
it is not speciﬁcally listed in the table.
3.
Analyze the small-signal equivalent circuit, setting the dc source components
equal to zero, to produce the response of the circuit to the time-varying input
signals only.

In Table 6.2, the dc model of the resistor is a resistor, the capacitor model is an
open circuit, and the inductor model is a short circuit. The forward-biased diode
model includes the cut-in voltage Vγ and the forward resistance rf .
The small-signal models of R, L, and C remain the same. However, if the signal
frequency is sufﬁciently high, the impedance of a capacitor can be approximated by
a short circuit. The small-signal, low-frequency model of the diode becomes the
diode diffusion resistance rd. Also, the independent dc voltage source becomes a
short circuit, and the independent dc current source becomes an open circuit.

Hybrid-π Equivalent Circuit,
Including the Early Effect
So far in the small-signal equivalent circuit, we have assumed that the collector cur-
rent is independent of the collector–emitter voltage. We discussed the Early effect in
the last chapter in which the collector current does vary with collector–emitter volt-
age. Equation (5.16) in the previous chapter gives the relation

Applying the small-signal equivalent circuit in Figure 6.13 to the ac equivalent

Comment: Comparing this result to that of Example 6.1, we see that ro reduces the
magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain. In many cases, the magnitude of ro is
much larger than that of RC, which means that the effect of ro is negligible.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 6.2: For the circuit in Figure 6.3, assume transistor parameters of β = 150,
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 150 V. The circuit parameters are VCC = 5 V,
VBB = 1.025 V, RB = 100 k	, and RC = 6 k	. (a) Determine the small-signal
hybrid-π
parameters gm, rπ, and ro. (b) Find the small-signal voltage
gain
Av = Vo/Vs. (Ans. (a) gm = 18.75 mA/V, rπ = 8 k	, ro = 308 k	; 
(b) Av = −8.17)
The hybrid-π model derives its name, in part, from the hybrid nature of the pa-
rameter units. The four parameters of the equivalent circuits shown in Figures 6.13(a)
and 6.13(b) are: input resistance rπ (ohms), current gain β (dimensionless), output
resistance ro (ohms), and transconductance gm (mhos).
Input and Output Resistance
Two other parameters that affect the performance of an ampliﬁer are the small-signal
input and output resistances. The determination of these parameters for the simple
circuits that we have considered up to this point is straightforward.
From the hybrid-π equivalent circuit in Figure 6.13(a), the input resistance look-
ing into the base terminal of the transistor, denoted by Rib, is Rib = rπ. To ﬁnd the
output resistance, set all independent sources equal to zero. So, in Figure 6.13(a), we
set Vπ = 0 which implies that gmVπ = 0. A zero-valued current source means an
open circuit. The output resistance looking back into the collector terminal of the
transistor, denoted by Roc, is Roc = ro. These two parameters affect the loading char-
acteristics of the ampliﬁer.
Equivalent Circuit for a pnp Transistor
Up to this point, we have considered only circuits with npn bipolar transistors. How-
ever, the same basic analysis and equivalent circuit also applies to the pnp transistor.
Figure 6.14(a) shows a circuit containing a pnp transistor. Here again, we see the
change of current directions and voltage polarities compared to the circuit containing
the npn transistor. Figure 6.14(b) is the ac equivalent circuit, with the dc voltage
sources replaced by an ac short circuit, and all current and voltages shown are only
the sinusoidal components.

Figure 6.16 Small-signal hybrid-π models of the pnp transistor: (a) original circuit shown in
Figure 6.15 and (b) equivalent circuit with voltage polarities and current directions reversed
The transistor in Figure 6.14(b) can now be replaced by either of the hybrid-π
equivalent circuits shown in Figure 6.15. The hybrid-π equivalent circuit of the pnp
transistor is the same as that of the npn device, except that again all current directions
and voltage polarities are reversed. The hybrid-π parameters are determined by using
exactly the same equations as for the npn device; that is, Equation (6.22) for rπ,
Equation (6.26) for gm, and Equation (6.37) for ro.
We can note that, in the small-signal equivalent circuits in Figure 6.15, if we de-
ﬁne currents of opposite direction and voltages of opposite polarity, the equivalent
circuit model is exactly the same as that of the npn bipolar transistor. Figure 6.16(a)
is a repeat of Figure 6.15(a) showing the conventional voltage polarities and current
directions in the hybrid-π equivalent circuit for a pnp transistor. Keep in mind
that these voltages and currents are small-signal parameters. If the polarity of the

388
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
input control voltage Vπ is reversed, then the direction of the current from the
dependent current source is also reversed. This change is shown in Figure 6.16(b).
We may note that this small-signal equivalent circuit is the same as the hybrid-π
equivalent circuit for the npn transistor.
However, the author prefers to use the models shown in Figure 6.15 because the
current directions and voltage polarities are consistent with the pnp device.
Combining the hybrid-π model of the pnp transistor (Figure 6.15(a)) with the ac
equivalent circuit (Figure 6.14(b)), we obtain the small-signal equivalent circuit
shown in Figure 6.17. The output voltage is given by
Vo = (gmVπ)(ro∥RC)
(6.38)
The control voltage Vπ can be expressed in terms of the input signal voltage Vs using
a voltage divider equation. Taking into account the polarity, we ﬁnd
Vπ = −
Vsrπ
RB + rπ
(6.39)
Combining Equations (6.38) and (6.39), we obtain the small-signal voltage gain:
Av = Vo

(6.40)
The expression for the small-signal voltage gain of the circuit containing a pnp tran-
sistor is exactly the same as that for the npn transistor circuit. Taking into account the re-
versed current directions and voltage polarities, the voltage gain still contains a negative
sign indicating a 180-degree phase shift between the input and output signals.

Comment: We again note the −180° phase shift between the output and input sig-
nals. We may also note that the base resistance RB in the denominator substantially
reduces the magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain. We can also note that placing
the pnp transistor in this conﬁguration allows us to use positive power supplies.

Expanded Hybrid-π Equivalent Circuit1
Figure 6.19 shows an expanded hybrid-π equivalent circuit, which includes two
additional resistances, rb and rμ.
The parameter rb is the series resistance of the semiconductor material between the
external base terminal B and an idealized internal base region B′. Typically, rb is a few
tens of ohms and is usually much smaller than rπ; therefore, rb is normally negligible (a
short circuit) at low frequencies. However, at high frequencies, rb may not be negligible,
since the input impedance becomes capacitive, as we will see in Chapter 7.

*Sections can be skipped without loss of continuity.
The parameter rμ is the reverse-biased diffusion resistance of the base–collector
junction. This resistance is typically on the order of megohms and can normally be
neglected (an open circuit). However, the resistance does provide some feedback be-
tween the output and input, meaning that the base current is a slight function of the
collector–emitter voltage.
In this text, when we use the hybrid-π equivalent circuit model, we will neglect
both rb and rμ, unless they are speciﬁcally included.
Other Small-Signal Parameters 
and Equivalent Circuits
Other small-signal parameters can be developed to model the bipolar transistor or
other transistors described in the following chapters.
One common equivalent circuit model for bipolar transistor uses the h-
parameters, which relate the small-signal terminal currents and voltages of a two-
port network. These parameters are normally given in bipolar transistor data sheets,
and are convenient to determine experimentally at low frequency.
Figure 6.20(a) shows the small-signal terminal current and voltage phasors for a
common-emitter transistor. If we assume the transistor is biased at a Q-point in the
forward-active region, the linear relationships between the small-signal terminal cur-
rents and voltages can be written as
Vbe = hieIb + hreVce
(6.41(a))
Ic = h f eIb + hoeVce
(6.41(b))
These are the deﬁning equations of the common–emitter h-parameters, where the
subscripts are: i for input, r for reverse, f for forward, o for output, and e for common
emitter.

Figure 6.20 (a) Common-emitter npn transistor and (b) the h-parameter model of the
common-emitter bipolar transistor
These equations can be used to generate the small-signal h-parameter equivalent
circuit, as shown in Figure 6.20(b). Equation (6.41(a)) represents a Kirchhoff voltage
law equation at the input, and the resistance hie is in series with a dependent voltage
source equal to hreVce. Equation (6.41(b)) represents a Kirchhoff current law equa-
tion at the output, and the conductance hoe is in parallel with a dependent current
source equal to h f eIb.
Since both the hybrid-π and h-parameters can be used to model the
characteristics of the same transistor, these parameters are not independent. We
can relate the hybrid-π and h-parameters using the equivalent circuit shown in
Figure 6.19. 
We can show the small-signal input resistance hie is
hie = rb + rπ∥rμ ∼= rπ
(6.42)
The parameter h f e is the small-signal current gain and is 
found to be
h f e = gmrπ = β
(6.43)
The small-signal output admittance hoe is given by
hoe ∼= 1
ro
(6.44)
The fourth h-parameter, hre, is called the voltage feedback ratio and can be
written as
hre =

rπ + rμ

(6.45)
The h-parameters for a pnp transistor are deﬁned in the same way as those for
an npn device. Also, the small-signal equivalent circuit for a pnp transistor using
h-parameters is identical to that of an npn device, except that the current directions
and voltage polarities are reversed.
EXAMPLE 6.4
Objective: Determine the h-parameters of a speciﬁc transistor.
The 2N2222A transistor is a commonly used discrete npn transistor. Data for
this transistor are shown in Figure 6.21. Assume the transistor is biased at IC = 1 mA
and let T = 300 K.

392
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Solution: In Figure 6.21, we see that the small-signal current gain h f e is generally in
the range 100 < h f e < 170 for IC = 1 mA, and the corresponding value of hie is
generally between 2.5 and 5 k	. The voltage feedback ratio hre varies between
1.5 × 10−4 and 5 × 10−4, and the output admittance hoe is in the range 8 < hoe <
18 μmhos.
Comment: The purpose of this example is to show that the parameters of a given
transistor type can vary widely. In particular, the current gain parameter can easily
vary by a factor of two. These variations are due to tolerances in the initial semicon-
ductor properties and in the production process variables.
Design Pointer: This example clearly shows that there can be a wide variation in
transistor parameters. Normally, a circuit is designed using nominal parameter val-
ues, but the allowable variations must be taken into account. In Chapter 5, we noted

essentially equivalent to the hybrid-π parameters rπ and ro, respectively, and that
h f e is essentially equal to β. The transistor circuit response is independent of the
transistor model used. This reinforces the concept of a relationship between hybrid-
π parameters and h-parameters. In fact, this is true for any set of small-signal para-
meters; that is, any given set of small-signal parameters is related to any other set of
parameters.
Data Sheet
In the previous example, we showed some data for the 2N2222 discrete transistor.
Figure 6.22 shows additional data from the data sheet for this transistor. Data sheets
contain a lot of information, but we can begin to discuss some of the data at this time.
The ﬁrst set of parameters pertains to the transistor in cutoff. The ﬁrst two para-
meters listed are V(BR)C E O and V(BR)C BO, which are the collector–emitter break-
down voltage with the base terminal open and the collector–base breakdown voltage
with the emitter open. These parameters were discussed in Section 5.1.6 in the last
chapter. In that section, we argued that V(BR)C BO was larger than V(BR)C E O, which is
supported by the data shown. These two voltages are measured at a speciﬁc current
in the breakdown region. The third parameter, V(BR)E BO, is the emitter–base break-
down voltage, which is substantially less than the collector–base or collector–emitter
breakdown voltages.
The current IC BO is the reverse-biased collector–base junction current with
the emitter open (IE = 0). This parameter was also discussed in Section 5.1.6. In
the data sheet, this current is measured at two values of collector–base voltage and
at two temperatures. The reverse-biased current increases with increasing temper-
ature, as we would expect. The current IE BO is the reverse-biased emitter–base
junction current with the collector open (IC = 0). This current is also measured at
a specific reverse-bias voltage. The other two current parameters, IC E X and IBL,
are the collector current and base current measured at given specific cutoff
voltages.
The next set of parameters applies to the transistor when it is turned on. As was
shown in Example 6.4, the data sheets give the h-parameters of the transistor. The
ﬁrst parameter, hFE, is the dc common-emitter current gain and is measured over a
wide range of collector current. We discussed, in Section 5.4.2, stabilizing the
Q-point against variations in current gain. The data presented in the data sheet show
that the current gain for a given transistor can vary signiﬁcantly, so that stabilizing
the Q-point is indeed an important issue.
We have used VC E(sat) as one of the piecewise linear parameters when a tran-
sistor is driven into saturation and have always assumed a particular value in our

with collector current. If the collector current becomes relatively large, then the
collector–emitter saturation voltage also becomes relatively large. The larger
VC E(sat) value would need to be taken into account in large-current situations. The
base–emitter voltage for a transistor driven into saturation, VBE(sat), is also given.

Up to this point in the text, we have not been concerned with this parameter; how-
ever, the data sheet shows that the base–emitter voltage can increase signiﬁcantly
when a transistor is driven into saturation at high current levels.
The other parameters listed in the data sheet become more applicable later in the
text when the frequency response of transistors is discussed. The intent of this short
discussion is to show that we can begin to read through data sheets even though there
are a lot of data presented.
The T-model: The hybrid-pi model can be used to analyze the time-varying char-
acteristics of all transistor circuits. We have brieﬂy discussed the h-parameter model
of the transistor. The h-parameters of this model are often given in data sheets for
discrete transistors. Another small-signal model of the transistor, the T-model, is
shown in Figure 6.23. This model might be convenient to use in speciﬁc applications.
However, to avoid introducing too much confusion, we will concentrate on using the
hybrid-π model in this text and leave the T-model to more advanced electronics
courses.

BASIC TRANSISTOR 
AMPLIFIER CONFIGURATIONS
Objective: • Discuss the three basic transistor ampliﬁer conﬁgura-
tions and discuss the four equivalent two-port networks.
As we have seen, the bipolar transistor is a three-terminal device. Three basic single-
transistor ampliﬁer conﬁgurations can be formed, depending on which of the three
transistor terminals is used as signal ground. These three basic conﬁgurations are
appropriately called common emitter, common collector (emitter follower), and
common base. Which conﬁguration or ampliﬁer is used in a particular application
depends to some extent on whether the input signal is a voltage or current and
whether the desired output signal is a voltage or current. The characteristics of the
three types of ampliﬁers will be determined to show the conditions under which each
ampliﬁer is most useful.
The input signal source can be modeled as either a Thevenin or Norton equiva-
lent circuit. Figure 6.24(a) shows the Thevenin equivalent source that would repre-
sent a voltage signal, such as the output of a microphone. The voltage source vs

Chapter 6 Basic BJT Ampliﬁers
397
represents the voltage generated by the microphone. The resistance RS is called the
output resistance of the source and takes into account the change in output voltage as
the source supplies current. Figure 6.24(b) shows the Norton equivalent source that
would represent a current signal, such as the output of a photodiode. The current
source is represents the current generated by the photodiode and the resistance RS is
the output resistance of this signal source.
Each of the three basic transistor ampliﬁers can be modeled as a two-port
network in one of four conﬁgurations as shown in Table 6.3. We will determine the
gain parameters, such as Avo, Aio, Gmo, and Rmo, for each of the three transistor am-
pliﬁers. These parameters are important since they determine the ampliﬁcation of the
ampliﬁer. However, we will see that the input and output resistances, Ri and Ro, are
also important in the design of these ampliﬁers. Although one conﬁguration shown in
Table 6.3 may be preferable for a given application, any one of the four can be used
to model a given ampliﬁer. Since each conﬁguration must produce the same terminal
characteristics for a given ampliﬁer, the various gain parameters are not independent,
but are related to each other.

If we wish to design a voltage ampliﬁer (preamp) so that the output voltage of a
microphone, for example, is ampliﬁed, the total equivalent circuit may be that shown
in Figure 6.25. The input voltage to the ampliﬁer is given by
vin =
Ri
Ri + RS
· vs
(6.46)
In general, we would like the input voltage vin to the ampliﬁer to be as nearly equal
to the source voltage vs as possible. This means, from Equation (6.46), that we need to
design the ampliﬁer such that the input resistance Ri is much larger than the signal
source output resistance RS. (The output resistance of an ideal voltage source is zero,
but is not zero for most practical voltage sources.) To provide a particular voltage gain,
the ampliﬁer must have a gain parameter Avo of a certain value. The output voltage sup-
plied to the load (where the load may be a second power ampliﬁer stage) is given by
vo =
RL
RL + Ro
· Avovin
(6.47)
Normally, we would like the output voltage to the load to be equal to the
Thevenin equivalent voltage generated by the ampliﬁer. This means that we need
Ro ≪RL for the voltage ampliﬁer. So again, for a voltage ampliﬁer, the output re-
sistance should be very small. The input and output resistances are signiﬁcant in the
design of an ampliﬁer.
For a current ampliﬁer, we would like to have Ri ≪RS and Ro ≫RL. We will
see as we proceed through the chapter that each of the three basic transistor ampliﬁer
conﬁgurations exhibits characteristics that are desirable for particular applications.
We should note that, in this chapter, we will be primarily using the two-port
equivalent circuits shown in Table 6.3 to model single-transistor ampliﬁers. How-
ever, these equivalent circuits are also used to model multitransistor circuits. This
will become apparent as we get into Part 2 of the text.

COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze the common-emitter ampliﬁer and become
familiar with the general characteristics of this circuit.
In this section, we consider the ﬁrst of the three basic ampliﬁers—the common-
emitter circuit. We will apply the equivalent circuit of the bipolar transistor that was
previously developed. In general, we will use the hybrid-π model throughout the text.

If the signal source is a sinusoidal voltage at frequency f, then the magnitude of
the capacitor impedance is |Zc| = [1/(2π f CC)]. For example, assume that CC =
10 μF and f = 2 kHz. The magnitude of the capacitor impedance is then
|Zc| =
1
2π f CC
=
1
2π(2 × 103)(10 × 10−6)
∼= 8 	
(6.48)
The magnitude of this impedance is in general much less than the Thevenin resis-
tance at the capacitor terminals, which in this case is R1∥R2∥rπ. We can therefore as-
sume that the capacitor is essentially a short circuit to signals with frequencies
greater than 2 kHz. We are also neglecting any capacitance effects within the transis-
tor. Using these results, our analyses in this chapter assume that the signal frequency
is sufﬁciently high that any coupling capacitance acts as a perfect short circuit, and is
also sufﬁciently low that the transistor capacitances can be neglected. Such frequen-
cies are in the midfrequency range, or simply at the midband of the ampliﬁer.
The small-signal equivalent circuit in which the coupling capacitor is assumed
to be a short circuit is shown in Figure 6.27. The small-signal variables, such as the

Basic Common-Emitter Ampliﬁer Circuit
Figure 6.26 shows the basic common-emitter circuit with voltage-divider biasing. We
see that the emitter is at ground potential—hence the name common emitter. The sig-
nal from the signal source is coupled into the base of the transistor through the cou-
pling capacitor CC, which provides dc isolation between the ampliﬁer and the signal
source. The dc transistor biasing is established by R1 and R2, and is not disturbed
when the signal source is capacitively coupled to the ampliﬁer.

The circuit in Figure 6.26 is not very practical. The voltage across R2 provides the
base–emitter voltage to bias the transistor in the forward-active region. However, a
slight variation in the resistor value or a slight variation in the transistor characteristics
may cause the transistor to be biased in cutoff or saturation. The next section discusses
an improved circuit conﬁguration.
Circuit with Emitter Resistor
In the last chapter, we found that the Q-point was stabilized against variations in β if an
emitter resistor were included in the circuit, as shown in Figure 6.28. We will ﬁnd a
similar property for the ac signals, in that the voltage gain of a circuit with RE will be
less dependent on the transistor current gain β. Even though the emitter of this circuit
is not at ground potential, this circuit is still referred to as a common-emitter circuit.
Assuming that CC acts as a short circuit, Figure 6.29 shows the small-signal
hybrid-π equivalent circuit. As we have mentioned previously, to develop the
small-signal equivalent circuit, start with the three terminals of the transistor.

in the remaining circuit elements around these three terminals. In this case, we are
using the equivalent circuit with the current gain parameter β, and we are assum-
ing that the Early voltage is inﬁnite so the transistor output resistance ro can be ne-
glected (an open circuit). The ac output voltage is
Vo = −(βIb)RC
(6.52)
To ﬁnd the small-signal voltage gain, it is worthwhile ﬁnding the input resis-
tance ﬁrst. The resistance Rib is the input resistance looking into the base of the tran-
sistor. We can write the following loop equation
Vin = Ibrπ + (Ib + βIb)RE
(6.53)
The input resistance Rib is then deﬁned as, and found to be,
Rib = Vin
Ib
= rπ + (1 + β)RE
(6.54)
In the common-emitter configuration that includes an emitter resistance, the
small-signal input resistance looking into the base of the transistor is rπ plus the
emitter resistance multiplied by the factor (1 + β). This effect is called the resis-
tance reflection rule. We will use this result throughout the text without further
derivation.
The input resistance to the ampliﬁer is now
Ri = R1∥R2∥Rib
(6.55)
We can again relate Vin to Vs through a voltage-divider equation as
Vin =

signal voltage gain is approximately

(6.59)
Equations (6.58) and (6.59) show that the voltage gain for this circuit is less de-
pendent on the current gain β than in the previous circuit (Equation (6.51), which
means that there is a smaller change in voltage gain when the transistor current gain
changes. The circuit designer now has more control in the design of the voltage gain,
but this advantage is at the expense of a smaller gain.
In Chapter 5, we discussed the variation in the Q-point with variations or toler-
ances in resistor values. Since the voltage gain is a function of resistor values, it is
also a function of the tolerances in those values. This must be considered in a circuit
design.

EXAMPLE 6.5
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain and input resistance of a
common-emitter circuit with an emitter resistor.
For the circuit in Figure 6.28, the transistor parameters are: β = 100,
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞.
DC Solution: From a dc analysis of the circuit, we can determine that IC Q =
2.16 mA and VC E Q = 4.81 V, which shows that the transistor is biased in the
forward-active mode.
AC Solution: The small-signal hybrid-π parameters are determined to be

= 1.20 k	
gm = IC Q

0.026 = 83.1 mA/V
and

The input resistance to the base can be determined as
Rib = rπ + (1 + β)RE = 1.20 + (101)(0.4) = 41.6 k	
and the input resistance to the ampliﬁer is now found to be
Ri = R1∥R2∥Rib = 10∥41.6 = 8.06 k	
Using the exact expression for the voltage gain, we ﬁnd
Av =
−(100)(2)
1.20 + (101)(0.4)

If we use the approximation given by Equation (6.59), we obtain
Av = −RC
RE

0.4 = −5.0
Comment: The magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain is substantially reduced
when an emitter resistor is included because of the (1 + β) RE term in the denomi-
nator. Also, Equation (6.59) gives a good ﬁrst approximation for the gain, which
means that it can be used in the initial design of a common-emitter circuit with an
emitter resistor.
Discussion: The ampliﬁer gain is nearly independent of changes in the current gain
parameter β. This fact is shown in the following calculations:

The two-port equivalent circuit along with the input signal source for the common-
emitter ampliﬁer analyzed in this example is shown in Figure 6.30. We can deter-
mine the effect of the source resistance RS in conjunction with the ampliﬁer input
resistance Ri. Using a voltage-divider equation, we ﬁnd the input voltage to the
ampliﬁer is

The actual input voltage to the ampliﬁer Vin is reduced compared to the input signal.
This is called a loading effect. In this case, the input voltage is approximately 94
percent of the signal voltage.

using npn transistors.

Comment: In the previous chapter, we found that including an emitter resistor
provided stability in the Q-point. However, we may note that in the small-signal
analysis, the RE resistor reduces the small-signal voltage gain substantially. There
are almost always trade-offs to be made in electronic design.

PS 6.2: Verify the results of Example 6.6 with a PSpice analysis. Use a standard
transistor.
Circuit with Emitter Bypass Capacitor
There may be times when the emitter resistor must be large for the purposes of dc de-
sign, but degrades the small-signal voltage gain too severely. We can use an emitter
bypass capacitor to effectively short out a portion or all of the emitter resistance as
seen by the ac signals. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 6.36 biased with both
positive and negative voltages. Both emitter resistors RE1 and RE2 are factors in the
dc design of the circuit, but only RE1 is part of the ac equivalent circuit, since CE pro-
vides a short circuit to ground for the ac signals. To summarize, the ac gain stability
is due only to RE1 and most of the dc stability is due to RE2.

Figure 6.36 A bipolar circuit with an emitter resistor and an emitter bypass capacitor
DESIGN EXAMPLE 6.7
Objective: Design a bipolar ampliﬁer to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 6.36
and is to amplify a 12 mV sinusoidal signal from a microphone to a 0.4 V sinusoidal

408
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
output signal. We will assume that the output resistance of the microphone is 0.5 k	
as shown.
Choices: The transistor used in the design has nominal values of β = 100 and
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, but the current gain for this type of transistor is assumed to be in
the range 75 ≤β ≤125 because of tolerance effects. We will assume that VA = ∞.
Standard resistor values are to be used in the ﬁnal design, but we will assume, in this
example, that the actual resistor values are available (no tolerance effects).
Solution (Initial Design Approach): The magnitude of the voltage gain of the am-
pliﬁer needs to be
|Av| = 0.4 V
12 mV = 33.3
From Equation (6.59), the approximate voltage gain of the ampliﬁer is
|Av| ∼= RC
RE1
Noting from the last example that this value of gain produces an optimistically high
value, we can set RC/RE1 = 40 or RC = 40 RE1.
The dc base-emitter loop equation is
5 = IB RB + VBE(on) + IE(RE1 + RE2)
Assuming β = 100 and VBE(on) = 0.7 V, we can design the circuit to produce a
quiescent emitter current of, for example, 0.20 mA. We then have
5 = (0.20)
(101) (100) + 0.70 + (0.20)(RE1 + RE2)
which yields
RE1 + RE2 = 20.5 k	
Assuming IE ∼= IC and designing the circuit such that VC E Q = 4 V, the collector–
emitter loop equation produces
5 + 5 = IC RC + VC E Q + IE(RE1 + RE2) = (0.2)RC + 4 + (0.2)(20.5)
or
RC = 9.5 k	
Then
RE1 = RC
40 = 9.5
40 = 0.238 k	
and RE2 = 20.3 k	.
Trade-offs: From Appendix C,
we will pick standard resistor values of
RE1 = 240 	, RE2 = 20 k	, and RC = 10 k	. We will assume that these resistor
values are available and will investigate the effects of the variation in transistor cur-
rent gain β.
The various parameters of the circuit for three values of β are shown in the fol-
lowing table. The output voltage Vo is the result of a 12 mV input signal.

Figure 6.37 PSpice circuit schematic diagram for Example 6.7
One important point to note is that, the output voltage is less than the design ob-
jective of 0.4 V for a 12 mV input signal. This effect will be discussed further in the
next section involving the computer simulation.
A second point to note is that the quiescent collector current, small-signal volt-
age gain, and output voltage are relatively insensitive to the current gain β. This sta-
bility is a direct result of including the emitter resistor RE1.
Computer Simulation: Since we used approximation techniques in our design, we can
use PSpice to give us a more accurate valuation of the circuit for the standard resistor
values that were chosen. Figure 6.37 shows the PSpice circuit schematic diagram.

Using the standard resistor values and the 2N3904 transistor, the output signal
voltage produced by a 12 mV input signal is 323 mV. A frequency of 2 kHz and ca-
pacitor values of 100 μF were used in the simulation. The magnitude of the output
signal is slightly less than the desired value of 400 mV. The principal reason for the
difference is that the rπ parameter of the transistor was neglected in the design. For a
collector current of approximately IC = 0.2 mA, rπ can be signiﬁcant.
In order to increase the small-signal voltage gain, a smaller value of RE1 is nec-
essary. For RE1 = 160 	, the output signal voltage is 410 mV, which is very close to
the desired value.
Design Pointer: Approximation techniques are extremely useful in an initial elec-
tronic circuit design. A computer simulation, such as PSpice, can then be used to ver-
ify the design. Slight changes in the design can then be made to meet the required
speciﬁcations.

Advanced Common-Emitter Ampliﬁer Concepts
Our previous analysis of common-emitter circuits assumed constant load or collector
resistances. The common-emitter circuit shown in Figure 6.40(a) is biased with a
constant-current source and contains a nonlinear, rather than a constant, collector
resistor. Assume the current–voltage characteristics of the nonlinear resistor are
described by the curve in Figure 6.40(b). The curve in Figure 6.40(b) can be gener-
ated using the pnp transistor as shown in Figure 6.40(c). The transistor is biased at a
constant VE B voltage. This transistor is now the load device and, since transistors are
active devices, this load is referred to as an active load. We will encounter active
loads in much more detail in Part 2 of the text.
Neglecting the base current in Figure 6.40(a), we can assume the quiescent
current and voltage values of the load device are IQ = IC Q and VRQ as shown in Fig-
ure 6.40(b). At the Q-point of the load device, assume the incremental resistance
vR/iC is rc.

Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of a common-emitter circuit
with a nonlinear load resistance.
Assume the circuit shown in Figure 6.40(a) is biased at IQ = 0.5 mA, and the
transistor parameters are β = 120 and VA = 80 V. Also assume that nonlinear small-
signal collector resistance is rc = 120 k	.
Solution: For a transistor current gain of β = 120, IC Q ∼= IE Q = IQ, and the small-
signal hybrid-π parameters are

0.026 = 19.2 mA/V

0.5 = 160 k	
The small-signal voltage gain is therefore
Av = −gm(ro∥rc) = −(19.2)(160∥120) = −1317
Comment: As we will see further in Part 2 of this text, the nonlinear resistor rc is
produced by the I–V characteristics of another bipolar transistor. Because the result-
ing effective load resistance is large, a very large small-signal voltage gain is pro-
duced. A large effective load resistance rc means that the output resistance ro of the
amplifying transistor cannot be neglected; therefore, the loading effects must be
taken into account.

AC LOAD LINE ANALYSIS
Objective: • Understand the concept of the ac load line and calculate
the maximum symmetrical swing of the output signal.
A dc load line gives us a way of visualizing the relationship between the Q-point and
the transistor characteristics. When capacitors are included in a transistor circuit, a
new effective load line, called an ac load line, may exist. The ac load line helps in
visualizing the relationship between the small-signal response and the transistor
characteristics. The ac operating region is on the ac load line.
AC Load Line
The circuit in Figure 6.36 has emitter resistors and an emitter bypass capacitor. The
dc load line is found by writing a Kirchhoff voltage law (KVL) equation around the
collector–emitter loop, as follows:
V + = IC RC + VC E + IE(RE1 + RE2) + V −
(6.61)

Figure 6.43 Circuit for Example 6.9
From the small-signal analysis in Example 6.7, the KVL equation around the
collector–emitter loop is
icRC + vce + ieRE1 = 0
(6.63(a))
or, assuming ic ∼= ie, then
vce = −ic(RC + RE1)
(6.63(b))
This equation is the ac load line. The slope is given by
Slope =
−1
RC + RE1
The ac load line is shown in Figure 6.42. When vce = ic = 0, we are at the Q-point.
When ac signals are present, we deviate about the Q-point on the ac load line.
The slope of the ac load line differs from that of the dc load line because the emitter
resistor RE2 is not included in the small-signal equivalent circuit. The small-signal C–E
voltage and collector current response are functions of the resistor RC and RE1 only.
EXAMPLE 6.9
Objective: Determine the dc and ac load lines for the circuit shown in Figure 6.43.
Assume the transistor parameters are: VE B(on) = 0.7 V, β = 150, and VA = ∞.
DC Solution: The dc load line is found by writing a KVL equation around the C–E
loop, as follows:
V + = IE RE + VEC + IC RC + V −

IE Q = 0.90 mA, and VEC Q = 6.53 V. The Q-point is also plotted in Figure 6.44.
AC Solution: Assuming that all capacitors act as short circuits, the small-signal

The ac load line, written in terms of the E–C voltage, is deﬁned by
vec = −ic(RC∥RL)
The ac load line is also plotted in Figure 6.44.
Comment: In the small-signal equivalent circuit, the large 10 k	 emitter resistor is
effectively shorted by the bypass capacitor CE, the load resistor RL is in parallel with
RC as a result of the coupling capacitor CC2, so that the slope of the ac load line is
substantially different than that of the dc load line.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 6.9: For the circuit in Figure 6.39, let β = 125, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and
VA = 200 V. Plot the dc and ac load lines on the same graph. (Ans. IC Q =
0.840 mA, dc load line, VC E = 10 −IC(7.3); ac load line, Vce = −Ic(1.58))
Maximum Symmetrical Swing
When symmetrical sinusoidal signals are applied to the input of an ampliﬁer, sym-
metrical sinusoidal signals are generated at the output, as long as the ampliﬁer oper-
ation remains linear. We can use the ac load line to determine the maximum output
symmetrical swing. If the output exceeds this limit, a portion of the output signal
will be clipped and signal distortion will occur.

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
EXAMPLE 6.10
Objective: Determine the maximum symmetrical swing in the output voltage of the
circuit given in Figure 6.43.
Solution: The ac load line is given in Figure 6.44. The maximum negative swing in
the collector current is from 0.894 mA to zero; therefore, the maximum possible
symmetrical peak-to-peak ac collector current is
ic = 2(0.894) = 1.79 mA
The maximum symmetrical peak-to-peak output voltage is given by
|vec| = |ic|(RC∥RL) = (1.79)(5∥2) = 2.56 V
Therefore, the maximum instantaneous collector current is
iC = IC Q + 1
2|ic| = 0.894 + 0.894 = 1.79 mA
Comment: Considering the Q-point and the maximum swing in the C–E voltage, the
transistor remains biased in the forward-active region. Note that the maximum in-
stantaneous collector current, 1.79 mA, is larger than the maximum dc collector cur-
rent, 1.33 mA, as determined from the dc load line. This apparent anomaly is due to
the different resistance in the C–E circuit for the ac signal and the dc signal.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 6.10: Reconsider the circuit in Figure 6.38. Let β = 120, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and
VA = ∞. The circuit parameters are given in Exercise Ex 6.7. (a) Plot the dc and ac
load lines on the same graph. (b) Determine the Q-point values. (c) Determine the
maximum symmetrical swing in the output voltage for iC > 0
and
0.5 ≤vC E ≤9 V. (Ans. (b) IC Q = 0.884 mA, VC E Q = 2.9 V; (c) vce = 4.8 V,
peak-to-peak)
Note: In considering Figure 6.42, it appears that the ac output signal is
smaller for the ac load line compared to the dc load line. This is true for a given
sinusoidal input base current. However, the required input signal voltage vs is
substantially smaller for the ac load line to generate the given ac base current.
This means the voltage gain for the ac load line is larger than that for the dc load
line.
Problem-Solving Technique: Maximum Symmetrical Swing
Again, since we are dealing with linear ampliﬁer circuits, superposition applies so
that we can add the dc and ac analysis results. To design a BJT ampliﬁer for max-
imum symmetrical swing, we perform the following steps.
1.
Write the dc load line equation that relates the quiescent values IC Q and VC E Q.
2.
Write the ac load line equation that relates the ac values ic and vce : vce =
−icReq where Req is the effective ac resistance in the collector–emitter circuit.
3.
In general, we can write ic = IC Q −IC(min), where IC(min) is zero or some
other speciﬁed minimum collector current.

Chapter 6 Basic BJT Ampliﬁers
417
4.
In general, we can write vce = VC E Q −VC E(min), where VC E(min) is some
speciﬁed minimum collector-emitter voltage.
5.
The above four equations can be combined to yield the optimum IC Q and
VC E Q values to obtain the maximum symmetrical swing in the output signal.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 6.11
Objective: Design a circuit to achieve a maximum symmetrical swing in the output
voltage.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 6.46a.
The circuit is to be designed to be bias stable. The minimum collector current is
to be IC(min) = 0.1 mA and the minimum collector-emitter voltage is to be
VC E(min) = 1 V.
Choices: Assume nominal resistance values of RE = 2 k	 and RC = 7 k	. Let
RT H = R1∥R2 = (0.1)(1 + β)RE = 24.2 k	. Assume transistor parameters of
β = 120, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞.
Solution (Q-Point): The dc equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6.46(b) and the
midband small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6.46(c).

The ac load line, from Figure 6.46(c), is
Vce = −Ic(RC∥RL) = −Ic(4.12)
These two load lines are plotted in Figure 6.47. At this point, the Q-point is unknown.
Also shown in the ﬁgure are the IC(min) and VC E(min) values. The peak value of the
ac collector current is IC and the peak value of the ac collector–emitter voltage is
VC E.
We can write
IC = IC Q −IC(min) = IC Q −0.1
and
VC E = VC E Q −VC E(min) = VC E Q −1
where IC(min) and VC E(min) were given in the speciﬁcations.
Now
VC E = IC(RC∥RL)
or
VC E Q −1 = (IC Q −0.1)(4.12)
Substituting the expression for the dc load line, we obtain
10 −IC Q(9) −1 = (IC Q −0.1)(4.12)
which yields

which yields

We then ﬁnd

Symmetrical Swing Results: We then ﬁnd the peak ac collector current to be
IC = IC Q −IC(min) = 0.717 −0.1 = 0.617 mA
or a peak-to-peak ac collector current to be 1.234 mA. The peak ac collector-emitter
voltage is
VC E = VC E Q −VC E(min) = 3.54 −1 = 2.54 V
or the peak-to-peak ac collector–emitter voltage is 5.08 V.
Comment: We have found the Q-point to yield the maximum undistorted ac output
signal. However, tolerances in resistor values or transistor parameters may change
the Q-point such that this maximum ac output signal may not be possible without in-
ducing distortion. The effect of tolerances is most easily determined from a computer
analysis.

COMMON-COLLECTOR 
(EMITTER-FOLLOWER) AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Analyze the emitter-follower ampliﬁer and become familiar
with the general characteristics of this circuit.
The second type of transistor ampliﬁer to be considered is the common-collector
circuit. An example of this circuit conﬁguration is shown in Figure 6.49. As seen in
the ﬁgure, the output signal is taken off of the emitter with respect to ground and the
collector is connected directly to VCC. Since VCC is at signal ground in the ac equiva-
lent circuit, we have the name common-collector. The more common name for this
circuit is emitter follower. The reason for this name will become apparent as we
proceed through the analysis.
Small-Signal Voltage Gain
The dc analysis of the circuit is exactly the same as we have already seen, so we
will concentrate on the small-signal analysis. The hybrid-π model of the bipolar

coupling capacitor CC acts as a short circuit, Figure 6.50 shows the small-signal

For the circuit shown in Figure 6.49, assume the transistor parameters are:
β = 100, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 80 V.
Solution: The dc analysis shows that IC Q = 0.793 mA and VC E Q = 3.4 V. The

We may note that

or

Comment: The magnitude of the voltage gain is slightly less than 1. An examination
of Equation (6.68) shows that this is always true. Also, the voltage gain is positive,
which means that the output signal voltage at the emitter is in phase with the input
signal voltage. The reason for the terminology emitter-follower is now clear. The ac
output voltage at the emitter is essentially equal to the ac input voltage.
At ﬁrst glance, a transistor ampliﬁer with a voltage gain essentially of 1 may not
seem to be of much value. However, the input and output resistance characteristics
make this circuit extremely useful in many applications, as we will show in the next
section.

COMPUTER ANALYSIS EXERCISE
PS 6.4: Perform a PSpice simulation on the circuit in Figure 6.49. (a) Determine
the small-signal voltage gain and (b) ﬁnd the effective resistance seen by the
signal source vs.
Input and Output Impedance
Input Resistance
The input impedance, or small-signal input resistance for low-frequency signals,
of the emitter-follower is determined in the same manner as for the common-
emitter circuit. For the circuit in Figure 6.49, the input resistance looking into the
base is denoted Rib and is indicated in the small-signal equivalent circuit shown in
Figure 6.51.
The input resistance Rib was given by Equation (6.66(b)) as
Rib = rπ + (1 + β)(ro∥RE)
Since the emitter current is (1 + β) times the base current, the effective
impedance in the emitter is multiplied by (1 + β). We saw this same effect when
an emitter resistor was included in a common-emitter circuit. This multiplication
by (1 + β) is again called the resistance reflection rule. The input resistance at
the base is rπ plus the effective resistance in the emitter multiplied by the (1 + β)
factor. This resistance reflection rule will be used extensively throughout the
remainder of the text.
Output Resistance
Initially, to ﬁnd the output resistance of the emitter-follower circuit shown in
Figure 6.49, we will assume that the input signal source is ideal and that RS = 0. The
circuit shown in Figure 6.52 can be used to determine the output resistance looking
back into the output terminals. The circuit is derived from the small-signal equivalent

circuit shown in Figure 6.51 by setting the independent voltage source Vs equal to
zero, which means that Vs acts as a short circuit. A test voltage Vx is applied to the out-
put terminal and the resulting test current is Ix. The output resistance, Ro, is given by
Ro = Vx
Ix
(6.69)
In this case, the control voltage Vπ is not zero, but is a function of the applied test
voltage. From Figure 6.52, we see that Vπ = −Vx. Summing currents at the output
node, we have
Ix + gmVπ = Vx

or the output resistance can be written in the form

(6.74)
Equation (6.74) says that the output resistance looking back into the output terminals is
the effective resistance in the emitter, RE∥ro, in parallel with the resistance looking back
into the emitter. In turn, the resistance looking into the emitter is the total resistance in
the base circuit divided by (1 + β). This is an important result and is called the inverse
resistance reﬂection rule and is the inverse of the reﬂection rule looking to the base.
EXAMPLE 6.13
Objective: Calculate the input and output resistance of the emitter-follower circuit
shown in Figure 6.49. Assume RS = 0.
The small-signal parameters, as determined in Example 6.12, are rπ = 3.28 k	,
β = 100, and ro = 100 k	.
Solution (Input Resistance): The input resistance looking into the base was deter-
mined in Example 6.12 as
Rib = rπ + (1 + β)(ro∥RE) = 3.28 + (101)(100∥2) = 201 k	
and the input resistance seen by the signal source Ri is
Ri = R1∥R2∥Rib = 50∥50∥201 = 22.2 k	
Comment: The input resistance of the emitter-follower looking into the base is
substantially larger than that of the simple common-emitter circuit because of the

Chapter 6 Basic BJT Ampliﬁers
425
(1 + β) factor. This is one advantage of the emitter-follower circuit. However, in this
case, the input resistance seen by the signal source is dominated by the bias resistors
R1 and R2. To take advantage of the large input resistance of the emitter-follower
circuit, the bias resistors must be designed to be much larger.
Solution (Output Resistance): The output resistance is found from Equa-
tion (6.74) as
Ro =

∥RE∥ro =
3.28
101

∥2∥100
or
Ro = 0.0325∥2∥100 = 0.0320 k	 ⇒32.0 	
The output resistance is dominated by the ﬁrst term that has (1 + β) in the
denominator.
Comment: The emitter-follower circuit is sometimes referred to as an impedance
transformer, since the input impedance is large and the output impedance is small. The
very low output resistance makes the emitter-follower act almost like an ideal voltage
source, so the output is not loaded down when used to drive another load. Because of
this, the emitter-follower is often used as the output stage of a multistage ampliﬁer.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 6.13: Consider the circuit and transistor parameters described in Exercise
Ex 6.12 for the circuit shown in Figure 6.49. For the case of RS = 0, determine the
output resistance looking into the output terminals. (Ans. Ro = 0.129 	)
We can determine the output resistance of the emitter-follower circuit taking into
account a nonzero source resistance. The circuit in Figure 6.53 is derived from the
small-signal equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6.51 and can be used to ﬁnd Ro. The
independent source Vs is set equal to zero and a test voltage Vx is applied to the output
terminals. Again, the control voltage Vπ is not zero, but is a function of the test
voltage. Summing currents at the output node, we have

Small-Signal Current Gain
We can determine the small-signal current gain of an emitter-follower by using the input
resistance and the concept of current dividers. For the small-signal emitter-follower
equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6.51, the small signal current gain is deﬁned as
Ai = Ie
Ii
(6.80)
where Ie and Ii are the output and input current phasors.
Using a current divider equation, we can write the base current in terms of the
input current, as follows:
Ib =

Writing the load current in terms of Io produces

Combining Equations (6.82) and (6.83), we obtain the small-signal current gain, as

If we assume that R1∥R2 ≫Rib and ro ≫RE, then
Ai ∼= (1 + β)
(6.85)
which is the current gain of the transistor.
Although the small-signal voltage gain of the emitter follower is slightly less
than 1, the small-signal current gain is normally greater than 1. Therefore, the emitter-
follower circuit produces a small-signal power gain.
6.6.3

Chapter 6 Basic BJT Ampliﬁers

Although we did not explicitly calculate a current gain in the common-emitter
circuit previously, the analysis is the same as that for the emitter-follower and in gen-
eral the current gain is also greater than unity.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 6.14
Objective: To design an emitter-follower ampliﬁer to meet an output resistance
speciﬁcation.
Speciﬁcations: Consider the output signal of the ampliﬁer designed in Example 6.7. We
now want to design an emitter-follower circuit with the conﬁguration shown in Figure
6.54 such that the output signal from this circuit does not vary by more than 5 percent
when a load in the range RL = 4 k	 to RL = 20 k	 is connected to the output.
Choices: We will assume that a transistor with nominal parameter values of
β = 100, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 80 V is available.
Discussion: The output resistance of the common-emitter circuit designed in Example
6.7 is Ro = RC = 10 k	. Connecting a load resistance between 4 k	 and 20 k	 will
load down this circuit, so that the output voltage will change substantially. For this rea-
son, an emitter-follower circuit with a low output resistance must be designed to mini-
mize the loading effect. The Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6.55. The
output voltage can be written as
vo =

RL
RL + Ro

· vT H
where vT H is the ideal voltage generated by the ampliﬁer. In order to have vo change
by less than 5 percent as a load resistance RL is added, we must have Ro less than or
equal to approximately 5 percent of the minimum value of RL. In this case, then, we
need Ro to be approximately 200 	.
Initial Design Approach: Consider the emitter-follower circuit shown in Figure 6.54.
Note that the source resistance is RS = 10 k	, corresponding to the output resistance
of the circuit designed in Example 6.7.

The ﬁrst term, with (1 + β) in the denominator, dominates, and if R1∥R2∥RS ∼= RS,
then we have
Ro ∼= rπ + RS

For Ro = 200 	, we ﬁnd
0.2 = rπ + 10
101
or rπ = 10.2 k	. Since rπ = (βVT )/IC Q, the quiescent collector current must be
IC Q = βVT
rπ
= (100)(0.026)
10.2
= 0.255 mA
Assuming IC Q ∼= IE Q and letting VC E Q = 5 V, we ﬁnd
RE = V + −VC E Q −V −
IE Q

0.255
= 19.6 k	
The term (1 + β)RE is
(1 + β)RE = (101)(19.6) ⇒1.98 M	
With this large resistance, we can design a bias-stable circuit as deﬁned in Chapter 5
and still have large values for bias resistances. Let
RT H = (0.1)(1 + β)RE = (0.1)(101)(19.6) = 198 k	
The base current is
IB = VT H −VBE(on) −V −

We ﬁnd R1 = 317 k	 and R2 = 527 k	.
Comment: The quiescent collector current IC Q = 0.255 mA establishes the re-
quired rπ value which in turn establishes the required output resistance Ro.
Trade-offs: We will investigate the effects of a variation in transistor current gain.
In this example, we will assume that the designed resistor values are available.

The Thevenin equivalent resistance is RT H = R1∥R2 = 198 k	 and the
Thevenin equivalent voltage is VT H = 1.244 V. The base current is found by the
KVL equation around the B–E loop. We ﬁnd
IBQ = 1.244 −0.7 −(−5)
198 + (1 + β)(19.6)
The collector current is IC Q = βIBQ and we ﬁnd rπ = (βVT )/IC Q. Finally, the out-
put resistance is approximately
Ro ∼= rπ + RT H∥RS
1 + β
= rπ + 198∥10
1 + β
The values of these parameters for several values of β are shown in the following
table.
From these results, we see that the speciﬁed maximum output resistance of Ro ∼=
200 	 is met only if the current gain of the transistor is at least β = 100. In this de-
sign, then, we must specify that the minimum current gain of a transistor is 100.
Computer Simulation: We again used approximation techniques in our design. For
this reason, it is useful to verify our design with a PSpice analysis, since the computer
simulation will take into account more details than our hand design.
Figure 6.56 shows the PSpice circuit schematic diagram. A 1 mV sinusoidal
signal source is capacitively coupled to the output of the emitter follower. The input
signal source has been set equal to zero. The current from the output signal source
was found to be 5.667 μA. The output resistance of the emitter follower is then
Ro = 176 	, which means that we have met our desired speciﬁcation that the output
resistance should be less than 200 	.

Discussion: From the computer simulation, the quiescent collector current is
IC Q = 0.239 mA compared to the designed value of IC Q = 0.255 mA. The principal
reason for the difference in value is the difference in base-emitter voltage and current
gain between the hand analysis and computer simulation.
The output resistance speciﬁcation is met in the computer simulation. In the
PSpice analysis, the ac beta is 135 and the output resistance is Ro = 176 . This
value correlates very well with the hand analysis in which Ro = 184  for β = 125.

COMMON-BASE AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Analyze the common-base ampliﬁer and become familiar
with the general characteristics of this circuit.
A third ampliﬁer circuit conﬁguration is the common-base circuit. To determine the
small-signal voltage and current gains, and the input and output impedances, we will
use the same hybrid-π equivalent circuit for the transistor that was used previously.
The dc analysis of the common-base circuit is essentially the same as for the
common-emitter circuit.
Small-Signal Voltage and Current Gains
Figure 6.59 shows the basic common-base circuit, in which the base is at signal
ground and the input signal is applied to the emitter. Assume a load is connected to
the output through a coupling capacitor CC2.

Figure 6.60(a) again shows the hybrid-π model of the npn transistor, with the
output resistance ro assumed to be inﬁnite. Figure 6.60(b) shows the small-signal
equivalent circuit of the common-base circuit, including the hybrid-π model of the

small-signal equivalent circuit may look a little strange.

Equations (6.90) and (6.96) indicate that, for the common-base circuit, the
small-signal voltage gain is usually greater than 1 and the small-signal current gain
is slightly less than 1. However, we still have a small-signal power gain. The appli-
cations of a common-base circuit take advantage of the input and output resistance
characteristics.
Input and Output Impedance
Figure 6.61 shows the small-signal equivalent circuit of the common-base conﬁgura-
tion looking into the emitter. In this circuit, for convenience only, we have reversed
the polarity of the control voltage, which reverses the direction of the dependent cur-
rent source.

The resistance looking into the emitter, with the base grounded, is usually deﬁned as
re and is quite small, as already shown in the analysis of the emitter-follower circuit.
When the input signal is a current source, a small input resistance is desirable.
Figure 6.62 shows the circuit used to calculate the output resistance looking
back into the collector terminal. The small-signal resistance ro is included. The inde-
pendent source vs has been set equal to zero. We may deﬁne an equivalent resistance
Req = RS∥RE∥rπ.

(6.101)
If the input resistance RS = 0, then Req = 0 and the output resistance is just
given by Roc = ro. Including a collector resistor and a load resistor, the output resis-
tance looking back into the output terminal is Ro = Roc∥RC∥RL.
Since the output resistance looking back into the collector terminal is very large,
the common-base circuit looks almost like an ideal current source. The circuit is also
referred to as a current buffer.
Discussion
The common-base circuit is very useful when the input signal is a current. We will
see this type of application when we discuss the cascode circuit in Section 6.9.

greater than 1. For the emitter-follower, the voltage gain is slightly less than 1, while
the current gain is greater than 1. For the common-base circuit, the voltage gain is
greater than 1, while the current gain is less than 1.

The input resistance looking into the base terminal of a common-emitter circuit
may be in the low kilohm range; in an emitter follower, it is generally in the 50 to
100 k	 range. The input resistance looking into the emitter of a common-base circuit
is generally on the order of tens of ohms.
The overall input resistance of both the common-emitter and emitter-follower
circuits can be greatly affected by the bias circuitry.
The output resistance of the emitter follower is generally in the range of a few
ohms to tens of ohms. In contrast, the output resistance looking into the collector ter-
minal of the common-emitter and common-base circuits is very high. In addition, the
output resistance looking back into the output terminal of the common-emitter and
common-base circuits is a strong function of the collector resistance. For these cir-
cuits, the output resistance can easily drop to a few kilohms.
The characteristics of these single-stage ampliﬁers will be used in the design of
multistage ampliﬁers.
6.9
MULTISTAGE AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze multitransistor or multistage ampliﬁers and
understand the advantages of these circuits over single-transistor
ampliﬁers.
In most applications, a single transistor ampliﬁer will not be able to meet the
combined speciﬁcations of a given ampliﬁcation factor, input resistance, and output
resistance. For example, the required voltage gain may exceed that which can be
obtained in a single transistor circuit. We also saw an illustration of this effect in
Example 6.14, in which a low output resistance was required in a particular design.
Transistor ampliﬁer circuits can be connected in series, or cascaded, as shown in
Figure 6.65. This may be done either to increase the overall small-signal voltage gain
or to provide an overall voltage gain greater than 1, with a very low output resistance.
The overall voltage or current gain, in general, is not simply the product of the individ-
ual ampliﬁcation factors. For example, the gain of stage 1 is a function of the input re-
sistance of stage 2. In other words, loading effects may have to be taken into account.
There are many possible multistage conﬁgurations; we will examine a few here,
in order to understand the type of analysis required.

Multistage Analysis: Cascade Conﬁguration
In Figure 6.66, the circuit is a cascade conﬁguration of two common-emitter circuits.
The dc analysis of this circuit, done in Example 5.19 of Chapter 5, showed that both
transistors are biased in the forward-active mode. Figure 6.67 shows the small-signal

output resistance ro is inﬁnite.
We may start the analysis at the output and work back to the input, or start at the
input and work toward the output.

(6.102)
The input resistance of the ampliﬁer is
Ri = R1∥R2∥rπ1
which is identical to that of a single-stage common-emitter ampliﬁer. Similarly, the
output resistance looking back into the output terminals is Ro = RC2. To determine
the output resistance, the independent source Vs is set equal to zero, which means that
Vπ1 = 0. Then gm1Vπ1 = 0, which gives Vπ2 = 0 and gm 2Vπ 2 = 0. The output
resistance is therefore RC2. Again, this is the same as the output resistance of a
single-stage common-emitter ampliﬁer.

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
The dc and ac analyses of a multitransistor circuit become more complex com-
pared to those for a single-transistor circuit. In this situation, a computer simulation
of the circuit, without a hand analysis, is extremely useful.
The PSpice circuit schematic is shown in Figure 6.68. The resulting Q-point values
are IC Q1 = 2.54 mA, IC Q2 = 1.18 mA, VEC Q1 = 1.10 V, and VC E Q2 = 1.79 V. The ac
common-emitter current gains are β1 = 173 and β2 = 157.
A 1 μV sinusoidal signal is applied. The sinusoidal voltage at the collector of Q2
is 51 μV and the sinusoidal voltage at the output is 4.79 mV. The overall voltage gain
is then 4790. We will show, in later chapters, that even larger voltage gains can be ob-
tained by replacing the discrete collector resistors with active loads.
Comment: We can see from the Q-point values that the collector–emitter voltage
of each transistor is quite small. This implies that the maximum symmetrical swing
in the output voltage is limited to a fairly small value. These Q-point values can be
increased by a slight redesign of the circuit.
Discussion: The transistors used in this PSpice analysis of the circuit were standard
bipolar transistors from the PSpice library. We must keep in mind that, for the com-
puter simulation to be valid, the models of the devices used in the simulation must
match those of the actual devices used in the circuit. If the actual transistor charac-
teristics were substantially different from those used in the computer simulation, then
the results of the computer analysis would not be accurate.

Multistage Circuit: Darlington Pair Conﬁguration
In some applications, it would be desirable to have a bipolar transistor with a much
larger current gain than can normally be obtained. Figure 6.70(a) shows a multitran-
sistor conﬁguration, called a Darlington pair or a Darlington conﬁguration, that
provides increased current gain.
The small-signal equivalent in which the input signal is assumed to be a current
source, is shown in Figure 6.70(b). We will use the input current source to determine
the current gain of the circuit. To determine the small-signal current gain Ai = Io/Ii,
we see that
Vπ1 = Iirπ1

Therefore,
gm1Vπ1 = gm1rπ1Ii = β1Ii

Then,
Vπ2 = (Ii + β1Ii)rπ2
(6.105)
The output current is
Io = gm1Vπ1 + gm2Vπ2 = β1Ii + β2(1 + β1)Ii
(6.106)
where gm2rπ2 = β2. The overall current gain is then
Ai = Io
Ii
= β1 + β2(1 + β1) ∼= β1β2
(6.107)
From Equation (6.107), we see that the overall small-signal current gain of the
Darlington pair is essentially the product of the individual current gains.
The input resistance is Ri = Vi/Ii. We can write that
Vi = Vπ1 + Vπ2 = Iirπ1 + Ii(1 + β1)rπ2
(6.108)
so that
Ri = rπ1 + (1 + β1)rπ2
(6.109)
The base of transistor Q2 is connected to the emitter of Q1, which means that the
input resistance to Q2 is multiplied by the factor (1 + β1), as we saw in circuits with
emitter resistors. We can write
rπ1 = β1VT
IC Q1
(6.110)
and
IC Q 1 ∼= 1C Q 2
β2
(6.111)
Therefore,
rπ1 = β1
β2VT
IC Q2

= β1rπ2
(6.112)
From Equation (6.109), the input resistance is then approximately
Ri ∼= 2β1rπ2
(6.113)
We see from these equations that the overall gain of the Darlington pair is
large. At the same time, the input resistance tends to be large, because of the β
multiplication.
Multistage Circuit: Cascode Conﬁguration
A slightly different multistage conﬁguration, called a cascode conﬁguration, is
shown in Figure 6.71(a). The input is into a common-emitter ampliﬁer (Q1), which
drives a common-base ampliﬁer (Q2). The ac equivalent circuit is shown in Fig-
ure 6.71(b). We see that the output signal current of Q1 is the input signal of Q2. We
mentioned previously that, normally, the input signal of a common-base conﬁgura-
tion is to be a current. One advantage of this circuit is that the output resistance
looking into the collector of Q2 is much larger than the output resistance of a simple
common-emitter circuit. Another important advantage of this circuit is in the fre-
quency response, as we will see in Chapter 7.

The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 6.72 for the case when the
capacitors act as short circuits. We see that Vπ1 = Vs since we are assuming an ideal
signal voltage source. Writing a KCL equation at E2, we have
gm1Vπ1 = Vπ2

POWER CONSIDERATIONS
Objective: • Analyze the ac and dc power dissipation in a transistor
ampliﬁer and understand the concept of signal power gain.
As mentioned previously, an ampliﬁer produces a small-signal power gain. Since
energy must be conserved, the question naturally arises as to the source of this
“extra” signal power. We will see that the “extra” signal power delivered to a load is
a result of a redistribution of power between the load and the transistor.
Consider the simple common-emitter circuit shown in Figure 6.73 in which
an ideal signal voltage source is connected at the input. The dc power supplied
by the VCC voltage source PCC, the dc power dissipated or supplied to the collec-
tor resistor PRC, and the dc power dissipated in the transistor PQ are given,
respectively, as

Chapter 6 Basic BJT Ampliﬁers
443
PCC = IC QVCC + PBias
(6.120(a))
PRC = I 2
C Q RC
(6.120(b))
and
PQ = IC QVC E Q + IBQVBE Q ∼= IC QVC E Q
(6.120(c))
The term PBias is the power dissipated in the bias resistors R1 and R2. Normally in a
transistor IC Q ≫IBQ, so the power dissipated is primarily a function of the collector
current and collector–emitter voltage.
If the signal voltage is given by
vs = Vp cos ωt
(6.121)
then the total base current is given by
iB = IBQ + Vp
rπ
cos ωt = IBQ + Ib cos ωt
(6.122)
and the total collector current is
iC = IC Q + βIb cos ωt = IC Q + Ic cos ωt
(6.123)
The total instantaneous collector-emitter voltage is
vC E = VCC −iC RC = VCC −(IC Q + Ic cos ωt)RC = VC E Q −IcRC cos ωt
(6.124)
The average power, including ac signals, supplied by the voltage source VCC is
given by

Since the integral of the cosine function over one period is zero, the average power
supplied by the voltage source is the same as the dc power supplied. The dc voltage
source does not supply additional power.

(6.127)
The average power delivered to the load has increased because of the signal source.
This is expected in an ampliﬁer.

or

From Equation (6.129(b)), we can deduce that the average power dissipated in
the transistor decreases when an ac signal is applied. The VCC source still supplies all
of the power, but the input signal changes the relative distribution of power between
the transistor and the load.

DESIGN APPLICATION: AUDIO AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Design a bipolar transistor audio ampliﬁer to meet a set
of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: An audio ampliﬁer is to deliver an average power of 0.1 W to an 8 	
speaker from a microphone that produces a 10 mV peak sinusoidal signal and has a
source resistance of 10 k	.
Design Approach: A direct, perhaps brute force, approach will be taken in this
design. The generalized multistage ampliﬁer conﬁguration that will be designed is
shown in Figure 6.76. An input buffer stage, which will be an emitter-follower
circuit, is to be used to reduce the loading effect of the 10 k	 source resistance. The
output stage will also be an emitter-follower circuit to provide the necessary out-
put current and output signal power. The gain stage will actually be composed of a
2-stage common-emitter ampliﬁer that will provide the necessary voltage gain. We
will assume that the entire ampliﬁer system is biased with a 12 volt power supply.
Solution (Input Buffer Stage): The input buffer stage, an emitter-follower
ampliﬁer, is shown in Figure 6.77. We will assume that the transistor has a current
gain of β1 = 100. We will design the circuit so that the quiescent collector current
is IC Q1 = 1 mA, the quiescent collector-emitter voltage is VC E Q1 = 6 V, and
R1∥R2 = 100 k	.

For a 10 mV peak input signal voltage, the peak voltage at the output of the buffer
stage is now vo1 = 8.92 mV.
We ﬁnd the bias resistors to be R1 = 155 k	 and R2 = 282 k	.
Solution (Output Stage): The output stage, another emitter-follower ampliﬁer cir-
cuit, is shown in Figure 6.78. The 8 	 speaker is capacitively coupled to the output of the
ampliﬁer. The coupling capacitor ensures that no dc current ﬂows through the speaker.
For an average power of 0.1 W to be delivered to the load, the rms value of the
load current is found from PL = i2
L(rms) · RL or 0.1 = i2
L(rms) · 8 which yields
iL(rms) = 0.112 A. For a sinusoidal signal, the peak output current is then

and the peak output voltage is

We will assume that the output power transistor has a current gain of β4 = 50.

which is very close to unity, as we would expect. For a required peak output voltage
of vo = 1.26 V, we then need a peak voltage at the output of the gain stage to be
vo3 = 1.28 V.
Solution (Gain Stage): The gain stage, which will actually be a two-stage
common-emitter ampliﬁer, is shown in Figure 6.79. We will assume that the buffer
stage is capacitively coupled to the input of the ampliﬁer, the two stages of the am-
pliﬁer are capacitively coupled, and the output of this ampliﬁer is directly coupled to
the output stage.

which yields RE2 = 23.1 	.
If we set R3∥R4 = 50 k	, we ﬁnd R3 = 181 k	 and R4 = 69.1 k	.
Comment: We may note that, as with any design, there is no unique solution. In ad-
dition, to actually build this circuit with discrete components, we would need to use
standard values for resistors, which means the quiescent current and voltage values
will change, and the overall voltage gain will probably change from the designed
value. Also, the current gains of the actual transistors used will probably not be
exactly equal to the assumed values. Therefore some slight modiﬁcations will likely
need to be made in the ﬁnal design.
Discussion: We implicitly assumed that we were designing an audio ampliﬁer, but
we have not discussed the frequency response. For example, the coupling capacitors
in the design must be large enough to pass audio signal frequencies. The frequency
response of ampliﬁers will be discussed in detail in Chapter 7.
We will also see in later chapters, in particular Chapter 8, that a more efﬁcient
output stage can be designed. The efﬁciency of the output stage in this design is rel-
atively small; that is, the average signal power delivered to the load is small com-
pared to the average power dissipated in the output stage. However, this design is a
ﬁrst approximation in the design process.

SUMMARY
•
This chapter emphasized the application of bipolar transistors in linear ampliﬁer
circuits. The basic process by which a transistor circuit can amplify a small time-
varying signal was discussed.

450
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
•
The hybrid-π small-signal equivalent circuit of the bipolar transistor was devel-
oped. This equivalent circuit is used in the analysis and design of transistor lin-
ear ampliﬁers.
•
Three basic circuit conﬁgurations were considered: the common-emitter, emitter-
follower, and common-base. These three conﬁgurations form the basic building
blocks for more complex integrated circuits.
•
The common-emitter circuit ampliﬁes both time-varying voltages and currents.
•
The emitter-follower circuit ampliﬁes time-varying currents, and has a large
input resistance and low output resistance.
•
The common-base circuit ampliﬁes time-varying voltages, and has a low input
resistance and large output resistance.
•
Three multitransistor circuits were considered: a cascade conﬁguration of two
common-emitter circuits, a Darlington pair, and a cascode conﬁguration formed
by common-emitter and common-base circuits. Each conﬁguration provides
specialized characteristics such as overall larger voltage gain or an overall larger
current gain.
•
The concept of signal power gain in ampliﬁer circuits was discussed. There is a
redistribution of power within the ampliﬁer circuit.
•
As an application, bipolar transistors were incorporated in the design of a multi-
stage ampliﬁer circuit conﬁguration to provide a speciﬁed output signal power.

Thus far in our linear ampliﬁer analyses, we have assumed that coupling capacitors
and bypass capacitors act as short circuits to the signal voltages and open circuits to
dc voltages. However, capacitors do not change instantaneously from a short circuit
to an open circuit as the frequency approaches zero. We have also assumed that tran-
sistors are ideal in that output signals respond instantaneously to input signals. How-
ever, there are internal capacitances in both the bipolar transistor and ﬁeld-effect
transistor that affect the frequency response. The major goal of this chapter is to de-
termine the frequency response of ampliﬁer circuits due to circuit capacitors and
transistor capacitances.

1In many references, the gain is plotted as a function of the radian frequency ω. All curves in this chapter,
for consistency, will be plotted as a function of cyclical frequency f (Hz). We note that ω = 2π f . The
ampliﬁer gain is also plotted in terms of decibels (dB), where |A|dB = 20 log10 |A|.
7.1
AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Objective: • Discuss the general frequency response characteristics
of ampliﬁers.
All ampliﬁer gain factors are functions of signal frequency. These gain factors in-
clude voltage, current, transconductance, and transresistance. Up to this point, we
have assumed that the signal frequency is high enough that coupling and bypass ca-
pacitors can be treated as short circuits and, at the same time, we have assumed that
the signal frequency is low enough that parasitic, load, and transistor capacitances
can be treated as open circuits. In this chapter, we consider the ampliﬁer response
over the entire frequency range.
In general, an ampliﬁer gain factor versus frequency will resemble that shown in
Figure 7.1.1 Both the gain factor and frequency are plotted on logarithmic scales (the
gain factor in terms of decibels). Three frequency ranges, low, midband, and high,
are indicated. In the low-frequency range, f < fL, the gain decreases as the fre-
quency decreases because of coupling and bypass capacitor effects. In the high-
frequency range, f > fH, stray capacitance and transistor capacitance effects cause
the gain to decrease as the frequency increases. The midband range is the region
where coupling and bypass capacitors act as short circuits, and stray and transistor
capacitances act as open circuits. In this region, the gain is almost a constant. As we
will show, the gain at f = fL and at f = fH is 3 dB less than the maximum midband
gain. The bandwidth of the ampliﬁer (in Hz) is deﬁned as fBW = fH −fL.

Figure 7.1 Ampliﬁer gain versus frequency
For an audio ampliﬁer, for example, signal frequencies in the range of 20 Hz <
f < 20 kHz need to be ampliﬁed equally so as to reproduce the sound as accu-
rately as possible. Therefore, in the design of a good audio ampliﬁer, the frequency
fL must be designed to be less than 20 Hz and fH must be designed to be greater than
20 kHz.

Chapter 7 Frequency Response
471
Equivalent Circuits
Each capacitor in a circuit is important at only one end of the frequency spectrum.
For this reason, we can develop speciﬁc equivalent circuits that apply to the low-
frequency range, to midband, and to the high-frequency range.
Midband Range
The equivalent circuits used for calculations in the midband range are the same as
those considered up to this point in the text. As already mentioned, the coupling and
bypass capacitors in this region are treated as short circuits. The stray and transistor
capacitances are treated as open circuits. In this frequency range, there are no capac-
itances in the equivalent circuit. These circuits are referred to as midband equivalent
circuits.
Low-Frequency Range
In this frequency range, we use a low-frequency equivalent circuit. In this region,
coupling and bypass capacitors must be included in the equivalent circuit and in the
ampliﬁcation factor equations. The stray and transistor capacitances are treated as
open circuits. The mathematical expressions obtained for the ampliﬁcation factor in
this frequency range must approach the midband results as f approaches the midband
frequency range, since in this limit the capacitors approach short-circuit conditions.
High-Frequency Range
In the high-frequency range, we use a high-frequency equivalent circuit. In this re-
gion, coupling and bypass capacitors are treated as short circuits. The transistor and
any parasitic or load capacitances must be taken into account in this equivalent
circuit. The mathematical expressions obtained for the ampliﬁcation factor in this
frequency range must approach the midband results as f approaches the midband fre-
quency range, since in this limit the capacitors approach open-circuit conditions.
Frequency Response Analysis
Using the three equivalent circuits just considered rather than a complete circuit is an
approximation technique that produces useful hand-analysis results while avoiding
complex transfer functions. This technique is valid if there is a large separation
between fL and fH, that is fH ≫fL. This condition is satisﬁed in many electronic cir-
cuits that we will consider.
Computer simulations, such as PSpice, can take into account all capacitances
and can produce frequency response curves that are more accurate than the hand-
analysis results. However, the computer results do not provide any physical insight
into a particular result and hence do not provide any suggestions as to design changes
that can be made to improve a particular frequency response. A hand analysis can
provide insight into the “whys and wherefores” of a particular response. This basic
understanding can then lead to a better circuit design.
In the next section, we introduce two simple circuits to begin our frequency
analysis study. We initially derive the mathematical expressions relating output volt-
age to input voltage (transfer function) as a function of signal frequency. From these
functions, we can develop the response curves. The two frequency response curves
give the magnitude of the transfer function versus frequency and the phase of the
7.1.2
7.1.1

transfer function versus frequency. The phase response relates the phase of the output
signal to the phase of the input signal.
We will then develop a technique by which we can easily sketch the frequency
response curves without resorting to a full analysis of the transfer function. This sim-
pliﬁed approach will lead to a general understanding of the frequency response of
electronic circuits. We will then rely on a computer simulation to provide more
detailed calculations when required.
7.2
SYSTEM TRANSFER FUNCTIONS
Objective: • Derive the system transfer functions of two circuits, de-
velop the Bode diagrams of the magnitude and phase of the transfer
functions, and become familiar with sketching the Bode diagrams.
The frequency response of a circuit is usually determined by using the complex fre-
quency s. Each capacitor is represented by its complex impedance, 1/sC, and each
inductor is represented by its complex impedance, sL. The circuit equations are then
formulated in the usual way. Using the complex frequency, the mathematical expres-
sions obtained for voltage gain, current gain, input impedance, or output impedance
are ratios of polynomials in s.
We will be concerned in many cases with system transfer functions. These will
be in the form of ratios of, for example, output voltage to input voltage (voltage
transfer function) or output current to input voltage (transconductance function). The
four general transfer functions are listed in Table 7.1.
Once a transfer function is found, we can ﬁnd the result of a steady-state sinu-
soidal excitation by setting s = jω = j2π f . The ratio of polynomials in s then
reduces to a complex number for each frequency f. The complex number can be
reduced to a magnitude and a phase.

T(s) = K (s −z1)(s −z2) · · · (s −zm)
(s −p1)(s −p2) · · · (s −pn)
(7.1)
where K is a constant, z1, z2, . . . , zm are the transfer function “zeros,” and
p1, p2, . . . , pn are the transfer function “poles.” When the complex frequency is

equal to a zero, s = zi, the transfer function is zero; when the complex frequency is
equal to a pole, s = pi, the transfer function diverges and becomes inﬁnite. The
transfer function can be evaluated for physical frequencies by replacing s with jω. In
general, the resulting transfer function T( jω) is a complex function, that is, its mag-
nitude and phase are both functions of frequency. These topics are usually discussed
in a basic circuit analysis course.
To introduce the frequency response analysis of transistor circuits, we will
examine the circuits shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. The voltage transfer function for
the circuit in Figure 7.2 can be expressed in a voltage divider format, as follows:

(7.2)
The elements RS and CS are in series between the input and output signals, and the
element RP is in parallel with the output signal. Equation (7.2) can be written in the
form
Vo(s)
Vi(s) =

First-Order Functions
In our hand analysis of transistor circuits in this chapter, we will, in general, limit
ourselves to the consideration of only one capacitance at a time. We will therefore
be dealing with ﬁrst-order transfer functions that, in most cases, will have the
general form of either Equation (7.4) or (7.7). This simpliﬁed analysis will allow us
to present the frequency responses of speciﬁc capacitances and of the transistors

developed by H. Bode, and the resulting diagrams are called Bode plots.
Qualitative Discussion: Initially, we will consider the magnitude of the voltage
transfer function versus frequency. Before we delve into the mathematics, we can
qualitatively determine the general characteristics of this plot. The capacitor CS in
Figure 7.2 is in series between the input and output terminals. This capacitor then
behaves as a coupling capacitor.
In the limit of zero frequency (the input signal is a constant dc voltage), the im-
pedance of the capacitor is inﬁnite (an open circuit). In this case, then, the input sig-
nal does not get coupled to the output terminal so the output voltage is zero. In this
case, the magnitude of the voltage transfer function is zero.
In the limit of a very high frequency, the impedance of the capacitor becomes
very small (approaching a short circuit). In this situation, the magnitude of the
output voltage reaches a constant value given by a voltage divider, or Vo =
[RP/(RP + RS)] · Vi .
We therefore expect the magnitude of the transfer function to start at zero for
zero frequency, increase for increasing frequency, and reach a constant value at a rel-
atively high frequency.

Mathematical Derivation: For the transfer function in Equation (7.4), correspond-
ing to the circuit in Figure 7.2, if we replace s by jω and deﬁne a time constant τs as
τs = (RS + RP)CS, we obtain

(7.10(b))
We can plot each term of Equation (7.10(b)) and then combine the three plots to form
the ﬁnal Bode plot of the gain magnitude.
Figure 7.4(a) is the plot of the ﬁrst term of equation (7.10(b)), which is just a
constant independent of frequency. We may note that, since [RP/(RS + RP)] is less
than unity, the dB value is less than zero.
Figure 7.4(b) is the plot of the second term of Equation (7.10(b)). When
f = 1/2πτS, we have 20log10 (1) = 0. The slopes in Bode plot magnitudes are
described in units of either dB/octave or dB/decade. An octave means that frequency
is increased by a factor of two, and a decade implies that the frequency is increased
by a factor of 10. The value of the function 20 log10(2π f τS) increases by a factor of
6.02 ∼= 6 dB for every factor of 2 increase in frequency, and the value of the function
increases by a factor of 20 dB for every factor of 10 increase in frequency. Hence, we
can consider a slope of 6 dB/octave or 20 dB/decade.
Figure 7.4(c) is the plot of the third term in Equation (7.10(b)). For
f ≪1/2πτS, the value of the function is essentially 0 dB and when f = 1/2πτS,
the value is −3 dB. For f ≫1/2πτS, the function becomes −20 log10(2π f τS), so
the slope becomes −6 dB/octave or −20 dB/decade. A straight-line projection of this
slope passes through 0 dB at f = 1/2πτS. We can then approximate the Bode plot
for this term by two straight line asymptotes intersecting at 0 dB and f = 1/2πτS.
This particular frequency is known as a break-point frequency, corner frequency,
or −3 dB frequency.

Figure 7.5 Bode plot of the voltage transfer function magnitude
for the circuit in Figure 7.2
The complete Bode plot of Equation (7.10(b)) is shown in Figure 7.5. For
f ≫1/2πτS, the second and third terms of Equation (7.10(b)) cancel, and for
f ≪1/2πτS, the large negative dB value from Figure 7.4(b) dominates.
The transfer function given by Equation (7.9) is for the circuit shown in Fig-
ure 7.2. The series capacitor CS is a coupling capacitor between the input and output
signals. At a high enough frequency, capacitor CS acts as a short circuit, and the out-
put voltage, from a voltage divider, is
Vo = [RP/(RS + RP)]Vi
For very low frequencies, the impedance of CS approaches that of an open circuit,
and the output voltage approaches zero. This circuit is called a high-pass network
since the high-frequency signals are passed through to the output. We can now un-
derstand the form of the Bode plot shown in Figure 7.5.

Figure 7.6 Relation between rectangular and polar

The Bode plot of the phase function can be easily developed by recalling the re-
lation between the rectangular and polar form of a complex number. We can write
A + j B = Ke jθ , where K =

A2 + B2 and θ = tan−1(B/A). This relationship is
shown in Figure 7.6.

The net phase of the function T( j f ) is then θ = θ1 + θ2 −θ3.
Since the ﬁrst term, [RP/(RS + RP)], is a positive real quantity, the phase is
θ1 = 0. The second term, ( j2π f τS), is purely imaginary so that the phase is
θ2 = 90◦. The third term is complex so that its phase is θ3 = tan−1(2π f τS). The net
phase of the function is now
θ = 90 −tan−1(2π f τS)
(7.12)

Chapter 7 Frequency Response
477
For the limiting case of f →0, we have tan−1(0) = 0, and for f →∞, we
have tan−1(∞) = 90◦. At the corner frequency of f = 1/(2πτS), the phase is
tan−1(1) = 45◦. The Bode plot of the phase of the function given in Equation (7.11(a))
is given in Figure 7.7. The actual plot as well as an asymptotic approximation is
shown. The phase is especially important in feedback circuits since this can inﬂuence
stability. We will see this effect in Chapter 12.
Bode Plot for Figure 7.3
Qualitative Discussion: Again, we will initially consider the magnitude of the volt-
age function versus frequency. The capacitor CP in Figure 7.3 is in parallel with the
output and then behaves as a load capacitor on the output of a circuit, or may repre-
sent the input capacitance of a follow-on ampliﬁer stage.
In the limit of zero frequency (the input signal is a constant dc voltage), the
impedance of the capacitor is inﬁnite (an open circuit). In this case the output signal
is a constant value given by a voltage divider, or Vo = [RP/(RP + RS)] · Vi .
In the limit of a very high frequency, the impedance of the capacitor becomes
very small (approaching a short circuit). In this situation, the output voltage will be
zero, or the magnitude of the voltage transfer function will be zero.
We therefore expect the magnitude of the transfer function to start at a constant
value for zero and low frequencies, and then decrease toward zero at high
frequencies.
Mathematical Derivation: The transfer function given by Equation (7.7) is for the
circuit that was shown in Figure 7.3. If we replace s by s = jω = j2π f and deﬁne a
time constant τP as τP = (RS∥RP)CP, then the transfer function is

straight line with a slope of −20 dB/decade, or −6 dB/octave. The two asymptotes
meet at the frequency f = 1/2πτP, which is the corner, or 3 dB, frequency for this
circuit. Again, the actual magnitude of the transfer function at the corner frequency
differs from the maximum asymptotic value by 3 dB.
Again, the magnitude of the transfer function given by Equation (7.14) is for
the circuit shown in Figure 7.3. The parallel capacitor CP is a load, or parasitic,
capacitance. At low frequencies, CP acts as an open circuit, and the output voltage,
from a voltage divider, is
Vo = [RP/(RS + RP)]Vi
As the frequency increases, the magnitude of the impedance of CP decreases and ap-
proaches that of a short circuit, and the output voltage approaches zero. This circuit
is called a low-pass network, since the low-frequency signals are passed through to
the output.
The phase of the transfer function given by Equation (7.13) is
Phase = −̸ tan−1(2π f τP)
(7.15)
The Bode plot of the phase is shown in Figure 7.9. The phase is −45 degrees at the
corner frequency and 0 degrees at the low-frequency asymptote, where CP is effec-
tively out of the circuit.

EXAMPLE 7.1
Objective: Determine the corner frequencies and maximum-magnitude asymptotes

For the circuits in Figures 7.2 and 7.3, the parameters are: RS = 1 k,
RP = 10 k, CS = 1 μF, and CP = 3 pF.
Solution: (Figure 7.2) The time constant is
τS = (RS + RP)CS = (103 + 10 × 103)(10−6) = 1.1 × 10−2 s ⇒11 ms

The maximum magnitude is the same as just calculated: 0.909 or −0.828 dB.
Comment: Since the two capacitance values are substantially different, the two time
constants differ by orders of magnitude, which means that the two corner frequencies
also differ by orders of magnitude. Later in this text, we will take advantage of these
differences in our analysis of transistor circuits.

Figure 7.10 Circuit with both a series coupling and a parallel load capacitor
Short-Circuit and Open-Circuit Time Constants
The two circuits shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3 each contain only one capacitor. The
circuit in Figure 7.10 is the same basic conﬁguration but contains both capacitors.
Capacitor CS is the coupling capacitor and is in series with the input and output; ca-
pacitor CP is the load capacitor and is in parallel with the output and ground.

(7.16)
where τS and τP are the same time constants as previously deﬁned.
Although Equation (7.16) is the exact transfer function, it is awkward to deal
with in this form.
We have seen in the previous analysis, however, that CS affects the low-
frequency response and CP affects the high-frequency response. Further, if CP ≪CS
and if RS and RP are of the same order of magnitude, then the corner frequencies of
the Bode plots created by CS and CP will differ by orders of magnitude. (We actually
encounter this situation in real circuits.) Consequently, when a circuit contains both
coupling and load capacitors, and when the values of the capacitors differ by orders
of magnitude, then we can determine the effect of each capacitor individually.
At low frequencies, we can treat the load capacitor CP as an open circuit. To ﬁnd
the equivalent resistance seen by a capacitor, set all independent sources equal to
zero. Therefore, the effective resistance seen by CS is the series combination of RS
and RP. The time constant associated with CS is 
τS = (RS + RP)CS
(7.17)
Since CP was made an open circuit, τS is called an open-circuit time constant. The
subscript S is associated with the coupling capacitor, or the capacitor in series with
the input and output signals.
At high frequencies, we can treat the coupling capacitor CS as a short circuit. The
effective resistance seen by CP is the parallel combination of RS and RP, and the as-
sociated time constant is 
τP = (RS∥RP)CP
(7.18)
which is called the short-circuit time constant. The subscript P is associated with
the load capacitor, or the capacitor in parallel with the output and ground.

Chapter 7 Frequency Response
481
We can now deﬁne the corner frequencies of the Bode plot. The lower corner,
or 3 dB frequency, which is at the low end of the frequency scale, is a function of the
open-circuit time constant and is deﬁned as 
fL =
1
2πτS
(7.19(a))
The upper corner, or 3 dB, frequency, which is at the high end of the frequency
scale, is a function of the short-circuit time constant and is deﬁned as 
fH =
1
2πτP
(7.19(b))
The resulting Bode plot of the magnitude of the voltage transfer function for the cir-
cuit in Figure 7.9 is shown in Figure 7.11.
This Bode plot is for a passive circuit; the Bode plots for transistor ampliﬁers are
similar. The ampliﬁer gain is constant over a wide frequency range, called the mid-
band. In this frequency range, all capacitance effects are negligible and can be
neglected in the gain calculations. At the high end of the frequency spectrum, the
gain drops as a result of the load capacitance and, as we will see later, the transistor
effects. At the low end of the frequency spectrum, the gain decreases because
coupling capacitors and bypass capacitors do not act as perfect short circuits.
The midband range, or bandwidth, is deﬁned by the corner frequencies fL and
fH, as follows:
fBW = fH −fL

We will continue, in the following sections of the chapter, to use the concept of
open-circuit and short-circuit time constants to determine the corner frequencies of
the Bode plots of transistor circuits. An implicit assumption in this technique is that
coupling and load capacitance values differ by many orders of magnitude.

Time Response
Up to this point, we have been considering the steady-state sinusoidal frequency re-
sponse of circuits. In some cases, however, we may need to amplify nonsinusoidal
signals, such as square waves. This situation might occur if digital signals are to be
ampliﬁed. In these cases, we need to consider the time response of the output signals.
In addition, such signals as pulses or square waves may be used in testing the
frequency response of circuits.

(7.22)
Taking the inverse Laplace transform, we ﬁnd the output voltage time response as
vo(t) = K2e−t/τS
(7.23)
If we are trying to amplify an input voltage pulse using a coupling capacitor, the
voltage applied to the ampliﬁer (load) will begin to droop. In this case, we would
need to ensure that the time constant τS is large compared to the input pulse width T.
The output voltage versus time for a square wave input signal is shown in Figure 7.17.
A large time constant implies a large coupling capacitor.
If the cutoff frequency of the transfer function is f3-dB = 1/2πτS = 5 kHz, then
the time constant is τS = 3.18 μs. For a pulse width of T = 0.1 μs, the output volt-
age will droop by only 0.314 percent at the end of the pulse.
Consider, now, the circuit shown in Figure 7.18, which is a repeat of Figure 7.3.
In this case, the capacitor CP may represent the input capacitance of an ampliﬁer. The

FREQUENCY RESPONSE: TRANSISTOR
AMPLIFIERS WITH CIRCUIT CAPACITORS
Objective: • Analyze the frequency response of transistor circuits
with capacitors.
In this section, we will analyze the basic single-stage ampliﬁer that includes circuit
capacitors. Three types of capacitors will be considered: coupling capacitor, load ca-
pacitor, and bypass capacitor. In our hand analysis, we will consider each type of
capacitor individually and determine its frequency response. In the last part of this
section, we will consider the effect of multiple capacitors using a PSpice analysis.
The frequency response of multistage circuits will be considered in Chapter 12
when the stability of ampliﬁers is considered.
Coupling Capacitor Effects
Input Coupling Capacitor: Common-Emitter Circuit
Figure 7.21(a) shows a bipolar common-emitter circuit with a coupling capacitor.
Figure 7.21(b) shows the corresponding small-signal equivalent circuit, with the
transistor small-signal output resistance ro assumed to be inﬁnite. This assumption
is valid since ro ≫RC and ro ≫RE in most cases. Initially, we will use a current–
voltage analysis to determine the frequency response of the circuit. Then, we will use
the equivalent time constant technique.
From the analysis in the previous section, we note that this circuit is a high-pass
network. At high frequencies, the capacitor CC acts as a short circuit, and the input

EXAMPLE 7.3
Objective: Calculate the corner frequency and maximum gain of a bipolar common-
emitter circuit with a coupling capacitor.
For the circuit shown in Figure 7.21, the parameters are: R1 = 51.2 k,
R2 = 9.6 k, RC = 2 k, RE = 0.4 k, RSi = 0.1 k, CC = 1 μF, and VCC =
10 V. The transistor parameters are: VBE(on) = 0.7 V, β = 100, and VA = ∞.
Solution: From a dc analysis, the quiescent collector current is IC Q = 1.81 mA. The
small-signal parameters are gm = 69.6 mA/V and rπ = 1.44 k. 
The input resistance is
Ri = R1 ∥R2∥[rπ + (1 + β)RE]
= 51.2 ∥9.6∥[1.44 + (101)(0.4)] = 6.77 k
and the time constant is therefore
τS = (RSi + Ri)CC = (0.1 × 103 + 6.77 × 103)(1 × 10−6) ⇒6.87 ms
The corner frequency is
fL =

Comment: The coupling capacitor produces a high-pass network. In this circuit, if
the signal frequency is approximately two octaves above the corner frequency, the
coupling capacitor acts as a short circuit.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 7.3: For the circuit shown in Figure 7.21(a), the parameters are: VCC = 3 V,
RSi = 0, R1 = 110 k, R2 = 42 k, RE = 0.5 k, RC = 7 k, and CC =
0.47 μF. The transistor parameters are β = 150, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞.
(a) Determine the expression for and the value of the time constant τS. (b) Deter-
mine the corner frequency and midband voltage gain. (Ans. (a) τS = RiCC =
10.87 ms; (b) fL = 14.6 Hz, Av = −10.84)
Time Constant Technique: In general, we do not need to derive the complete cir-
cuit transfer function including capacitance effects in order to complete the Bode plot
and determine the frequency response. By looking at a circuit with, initially, only one
capacitor, we can determine if the ampliﬁer is a low-pass or high-pass circuit. We can
then specify the Bode plot if we know the time constant and the maximum midband
gain. The time constant determines the corner frequency. The midband gain is found
in the usual way when capacitances are eliminated from the circuit.
This time constant technique yields good results when all poles are real, as will
be the case in this chapter. In addition, this technique does not determine the corner
frequencies due to system zeros. The major beneﬁt of using the time constant ap-
proach is that it gives information about which circuit elements affect the −3 dB fre-
quency of the circuit. A coupling capacitor produces a high-pass network, so the form
of the Bode plot will be the same as that shown in Figure 7.5. Also, the maximum
gain is determined when the coupling capacitor acts as a short circuit, as was as-
sumed in Chapters 4 and 6.
The time constant for the circuit is a function of the equivalent resistance seen
by the capacitor. The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 7.21(b). If we
set the independent voltage source equal to zero, the equivalent resistance seen by
the coupling capacitor CC is (RSi + Ri). The time constant is then
τS = (RSi + Ri)CC
(7.38)
This is the same as Equation (7.35), which was determined by using a current–
voltage analysis.
Output Coupling Capacitor: Common-Source Circuit
Figure 7.22(a) shows a common-source MOSFET ampliﬁer. We assume that the re-
sistance of the signal generator is much less than RG and can therefore be neglected.
In this case, the output signal is connected to the load through a coupling capacitor.
The small-signal equivalent circuit, assuming ro is inﬁnite, is shown in Fig-
ure 7.22(b). The maximum output voltage, assuming CC is a short circuit, is 
|Vo|max = gmVgs(RD∥RL)
(7.39)

Chapter 7 Frequency Response
489
and the input voltage can be written as 
Vi = Vgs + gm RSVgs
(7.40)
Therefore, the maximum small-signal gain is 
|Av|max = gm(RD∥RL)
1 + gm RS
(7.41)
Even though the coupling capacitor is in the output portion of the circuit, the
Bode plot will still be that of a high-pass network, as shown in Figure 7.5. Using the
time constant technique to determine the corner frequency will substantially simplify
the circuit analysis, since we do not speciﬁcally need to determine the transfer
function for the frequency response.
The time constant is a function of the effective resistance seen by capacitor CC,
which is determined by setting all independent sources equal to zero. Since Vi = 0,
then Vgs = 0 and gmVgs = 0, and the effective resistance seen by CC is (RD + RL).
The time constant is then
τS = (RD + RL)CC
(7.42)
and the corner frequency is fL = 1/2πτS.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 7.4
Objective: The circuit in Figure 7.22(a) is to be used as a simple audio ampliﬁer.
Design the circuit such that the lower corner frequency is fL = 20 Hz.

(b) If CC = 0.7 μF, determine the corner frequency. (Ans. (a) RS = 4.08 k,

Output Coupling Capacitor: Emitter-Follower Circuit: An emitter follower with
a coupling capacitor in the output portion of the circuit is shown in Figure 7.23(a).
We assume that coupling capacitor CC1, which is part of the original emitter follower,
is very large, and that it acts as a short circuit to the input signal.
The small-signal equivalent circuit, including the small-signal transistor resis-
tance ro, is shown in Figure 7.23(b). The equivalent resistance seen by the coupling
capacitor CC2 is [Ro + RL], and the time constant is
τS = [Ro + RL]CC2
(7.43)

Comment: Using the time constant technique to ﬁnd the corner frequency is sub-
stantially easier than using the circuit analysis approach.

Chapter 7 Frequency Response

If we combine Equations (7.44) and (7.43), the time constant expression
becomes fairly complicated. However, the current–voltage analysis of this circuit
including CC2 is even more cumbersome. The time constant technique again simpli-
ﬁes the analysis substantially.
EXAMPLE 7.5
Objective: Determine the 3 dB frequency of an emitter-follower ampliﬁer circuit
with an output coupling capacitor.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 7.23(a) with transistor parameters
β = 100, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 120 V. The output coupling capacitance is
CC2 = 1 μF.
Solution: A dc analysis shows that IC Q = 0.838 mA. Therefore, the small-signal
parameters are: rπ = 3.10 k, gm = 32.2 mA/V, and ro = 143 k.
From Equation (7.44), the output resistance Ro of the emitter follower is

From Equation (7.43), the time constant is
τS = [Ro + RL]CC2 = [35.5 + 104](10−6) ∼= 1 × 10−2 s
The 3 dB frequency is then
fL =

2π(10−2) = 15.9 Hz
Comment: Determining the 3 dB or corner frequency is very direct with the time
constant technique.
Computer Veriﬁcation: Based on PSpice, analysis, Figure 7.24 is a Bode plot of the
voltage gain magnitude of the emitter-follower circuit shown in Figure 7.23(a). The
corner frequency is essentially identical to that obtained by the time constant tech-
nique. Also, the asymptotic value of the small-signal voltage gain is Av = 0.988, as
expected for an emitter-follower circuit.

Problem-Solving Technique: Bode Plot of Gain Magnitude
1.
For a particular capacitor in a circuit, determine whether the capacitor is pro-
ducing a low-pass or high-pass circuit. From this, sketch the general shape of
the Bode plot.
2.
The corner frequency is found from f = 1/2 πτ where the time constant is
τ = ReqC. The equivalent resistance Req is the equivalent resistance seen by
the capacitor.
3.
The maximum gain magnitude is the midband gain. Coupling and bypass ca-
pacitors act as short circuits and load capacitors act as open circuits.
Load Capacitor Effects
An ampliﬁer output may be connected to a load or to the input or another ampliﬁer.
The model of the load circuit input impedance is generally a capacitance in parallel
with a resistance. In addition, there is a parasitic capacitance between ground and the
line that connects the ampliﬁer output to the load circuit.
Figure 7.25(a) shows a MOSFET common-source ampliﬁer with a load resis-
tance RL and a load capacitance CL connected to the output, and Figure 7.25(b) shows
the small-signal equivalent circuit. The transistor small-signal output resistance ro is
assumed to be inﬁnite. This circuit conﬁguration is essentially the same as that in
Figure 7.3, which is a low-pass network. At high frequencies, the impedance of CL
decreases and acts as a shunt between the output and ground, and the output voltage
tends toward zero. The Bode plot is similar to that shown in Figure 7.8, with an upper
corner frequency and a maximum gain asymptote.

The equivalent resistance seen by the load capacitor CL is RD∥RL. Since we set
Vi = 0, then gmVsg = 0, which means that the dependent current source does not
affect the equivalent resistance.
The time constant for this circuit is
τP = (RD∥RL)CL

circuit, is

Coupling and Load Capacitors
A circuit with both a coupling capacitor and a load capacitor is shown in Fig-
ure 7.26(a). Since the values of the coupling capacitance and load capacitance differ
by orders of magnitude, the corner frequencies are far apart and can be treated
separately as discussed previously. The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in
Figure 7.26(b), assuming the transistor small-signal resistance ro is inﬁnite.

The Bode plot of the voltage gain magnitude is similar to that shown in Figure
7.11. The lower corner frequency fL is given by
fL =
1
2πτS
(7.47)
where τS is the time constant associated with the coupling capacitor CC, and the
upper corner frequency fH is given by
fH =
1
2πτP
(7.48)
where τP is the time constant associated with the load capacitor CL. It should be
emphasized that Equations (7.47) and (7.48) are valid only as long as the two corner
frequencies are far apart.
Using the small-signal equivalent circuit in Figure 7.26(b), we set the signal
source equal to zero to ﬁnd the equivalent resistance associated with the coupling ca-
pacitor. The related time constant is
τS = [RS + (R1∥R2∥Ri)CC
(7.49)
where
Ri = rπ + (1 + β)RE
(7.50)
Similarly, the time constant related to CL is
τP = (RC∥RL)CL
(7.51)
Since the two corner frequencies are far apart, the gain will reach a maximum
value in the frequency range between fL and fH, which is the midband. We can calcu-
late the midband gain by assuming that the coupling capacitor is a short circuit and
the load capacitor is an open circuit.
Using the analysis techniques from the last chapter, we ﬁnd the magnitude of the
midband gain as follows:

tude; therefore, considering one capacitor at a time is a valid approach.

Later we will show that, for a given load capacitance, this product is essentially a

width in ampliﬁer design.
Bypass Capacitor Effects
In bipolar and FET discrete ampliﬁers, emitter and source bypass capacitors are often
included so that emitter and source resistors can be used to stabilize the Q-point with-
out sacriﬁcing the small-signal gain. The bypass capacitors are assumed to act as
short circuits at the signal frequency. However, to guide us in choosing a bypass
capacitor, we must determine the circuit response in the frequency range where these
capacitors are neither open nor short circuits.
Figure 7.27(a) shows a common-emitter circuit with an emitter bypass capacitor.
The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 7.27(b). We can ﬁnd the small-
signal voltage gain as a function of frequency. Using the impedance reﬂection rule,
the small-signal input current is

The total impedance in the emitter is multiplied by the factor (1 + β). The control
voltage is

and the output voltage is

The form of this transfer function is somewhat different from what we have pre-
viously encountered in that we have both a zero and a pole.
The Bode plot of the voltage gain magnitude has two limiting horizontal
asymptotes. If we set s = jω, we can then consider the limit as ω →0 and the limit
as ω →∞. For ω →0, CE acts as an open circuit; for ω →∞, CE acts as a short
circuit. From Equation (7.59), we have
|Av|ω→0 =

(7.61(a))
and
|Av|ω→∞= gmrπ RC

From these results, we see that for ω →0, RE is included in the gain expression, and
for ω →∞, RE is not part of the gain expression, since it has been effectively
shorted out by CE.
If we assume that the time constants τA and τB in Equation (7.60) differ sub-
stantially in magnitude, then the corner frequency due to τB is

EXAMPLE 7.7
Objective: Determine the corner frequencies and limiting horizontal asymptotes of
a common-emitter circuit with an emitter bypass capacitor.
Consider the circuit in Figure 7.27(a) with parameters RE = 4 k, RC = 2 k,
RS = 0.5 k, CE = 1 μF, V + = 5 V, and V −= −5 V. The transistor parameters
are: β = 100, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and ro = ∞.
Solution: From the dc analysis, we ﬁnd the quiescent collector current as
IC Q = 1.06 mA. The small-signal parameters are gm = 40.77 mA/V, rπ = 2.45 k,
and ro = ∞.
The time constant τA is
τA = RECE = (4 × 103)(1 × 10−6) = 4 × 10−3 s
and the time constant τB is
τB =
RE(RS + rπ)CE
[RS + rπ + (1 + β)RE]
= (4 × 103)(0.5 × 103 + 2.45 × 103)(1 × 10−6)
[0.5 × 103 + 2.45 × 103 + (101)(4 × 103)]
or
τB = 2.90 × 10−5 s
The corner frequencies are then

Comment: Comparing the two limiting values of voltage gain, we see that including
a bypass capacitor produces a large high-frequency gain.
Computer Veriﬁcation: The results of a PSpice analysis are given in Figure 7.29.
The magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain is shown in Figure 7.29(a). The two
corner frequencies are approximately 39 Hz and 5600 Hz, which agree very well
with the results from the time constant analysis. The two limiting magnitudes of 0.49
and 68 also correlate extremely well with the hand analysis results.

very high frequencies, where the capacitor acts as either an open circuit or short

Between the two corner frequencies, the phase changes substantially, approaching
−90 degrees.

Ex 7.7: The circuit shown in Figure 7.27(a) has parameters V + = 10 V,
V −= −10 V, RS = 0.5 k, RE = 4 k, and RC = 2 k. The transistor parame-

The analysis of an FET ampliﬁer with a source bypass capacitor is essentially
the same as for the bipolar circuit. The general form of the voltage gain expression
is the same as Equation (7.60), and the Bode plot of the gain is essentially the same
as that shown in Figure 7.28.
Combined Effects: Coupling and Bypass Capacitors

comes more complex. In many ampliﬁer applications, the circuit is to amplify an

input signal whose frequency is conﬁned to the midband range. In this case, the
actual frequency response outside the midband range is not of interest. The end
points of the midband range are deﬁned to be those frequencies at which the gain de-
creases by 3 dB from the maximum midband value. These endpoint frequencies are
a function of the high- and low-frequency capacitors. These capacitors introduce a
pole to the ampliﬁer transfer function.
If multiple coupling capacitors, for example, exist in a circuit, one capacitor may
introduce the pole that produces the 3 dB reduction in the maximum gain at the low
frequency. This pole is referred to as the dominant pole. A more detailed discussion
of dominant poles is given in Chapter 12. A zero-value time constant analysis can be
used to estimate the dominant pole in a circuit containing multiple capacitors. At this
point in the text, we will determine the frequency response of circuits containing
multiple capacitors with a computer simulation.
As an example, Figure 7.30 shows a circuit with two coupling capacitors and an
emitter bypass capacitor, all of which affect the circuit response at low frequencies.
We could develop a transfer function that includes all the capacitors, but the analysis
of such circuits is most easily handled by computer.
Figure 7.31 is the Bode plot of the voltage gain magnitude for the example
circuit, taking into account the effects of the two coupling capacitors. In this case,
the bypass capacitor is assumed to be a short circuit. The plots consider C1 and C2
individually, as well as together. As expected, with two capacitors both acting at
the same time, the slope is 40 dB/decade or 12 dB/octave. Since the poles are not
far apart, in the actual circuit, we cannot consider the effect of each capacitor
individually.
Figure 7.32 is the Bode plot of the voltage gain magnitude, taking into account
the emitter bypass capacitor and the two coupling capacitors. The plot shows the ef-
fect of the bypass capacitor, the effect of the two coupling capacitors, and the net ef-
fect of the three capacitors together. When all three capacitors are taken into account,
the slope is continually changing; there is no deﬁnitive corner frequency. However,
at approximately f = 150 Hz, the curve is 3 dB below the maximum asymptotic

frequency.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE: 
BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR
Objective: • Determine the frequency response of the bipolar tran-
sistor, and determine the Miller effect and Miller capacitance.
Thus far, we have considered the frequency response of circuits as a function of
external resistors and capacitors, and we have assumed the transistor to be ideal.
However, both bipolar transistors and FETs have internal capacitances that inﬂuence
the high-frequency response of circuits. In this section, we will ﬁrst develop an
expanded small-signal hybrid-π model of the bipolar transistor, taking these
capacitances into account. We will then use this model to analyze the frequency
characteristics of the bipolar transistor.
Expanded Hybrid-π Equivalent Circuit
When a bipolar transistor is used in a linear ampliﬁer circuit, the transistor is biased
in the forward-active region, and small sinusoidal voltages and currents are superim-
posed on the dc voltages and currents. Figure 7.35(a) shows an npn bipolar transistor
in a common-emitter conﬁguration, along with the small-signal voltages and
currents. Figure 7.35(b) is a cross section of the npn transistor in a classic integrated
circuit conﬁguration. The C, B, and E terminals are the external connections to the
transistor, and the C′, B′, and E′ points are the idealized internal collector, base, and
emitter regions.
To construct the equivalent circuit of the transistor, we will ﬁrst consider various
pairs of terminals. Figure 7.36(a) shows the equivalent circuit for the connection be-
tween the external base input terminal and the external emitter terminal. Resistance
rb is the base series resistance between the external base terminal B and the internal
base region B′. The B′–E′ junction is forward biased; therefore, Cπ is the forward-
biased junction capacitance and rπ is the forward-biased junction diffusion resis-
tance. Both parameters are functions of the junction current. Finally, rex is the emitter
series resistance between the external emitter terminal and the internal emitter
region. This resistance is usually very small, on the order of 1 to 2 .
Figure 7.36(b) shows the equivalent circuit looking into the collector terminal.
Resistance rc is the collector series resistance between the external and internal

collector connections, and capacitance Cs is the junction capacitance of the reverse-
biased collector–substrate junction. The dependent current source, gmVπ, is the tran-
sistor collector current controlled by the internal base–emitter voltage. Resistance ro
is the inverse of the output conductance go and is due primarily to the Early effect.
Finally, Figure 7.36(c) shows the equivalent circuit of the reverse-biased B′–C′
junction. Capacitance Cμ is the reverse-biased junction capacitance, and rμ is the
reverse-biased diffusion resistance. Normally, rμ is on the order of megohms and can
be neglected. The value of Cμ is usually much smaller than Cπ; however, because of
a phenomenon known as the Miller effect, Cμ usually cannot be neglected. (We will
consider the Miller effect later in this chapter.)
The complete hybrid-π equivalent circuit for the bipolar transistor is shown in
Figure 7.37. The capacitances lead to frequency effects in the transistor. One result is
that the gain is a function of the input signal frequency. Because of the large number
of elements, a computer simulation of this complete model is easier than a hand
analysis. However, we can make some simpliﬁcations in order to evaluate some
fundamental frequency effects of bipolar transistors.
Short-Circuit Current Gain
We can begin to understand the frequency effects of the bipolar transistor by ﬁrst
determining the short-circuit current gain, after simplifying the hybrid-π model.

mind that the transistor must still be biased in the forward-active region. We will
determine the small-signal current gain Ai = Ic/Ib.

Since gmrπ = β, then the low frequency current gain is just β, as we previously
assumed. Equation (7.67) shows that, in a bipolar transistor, the magnitude and phase
of the current gain are both functions of the frequency.
Figure 7.39(a) is a Bode plot of the short-circuit current gain magnitude. The

rent. At high frequencies, the collector current lags the input current by 90 degrees.

Figure 7.39(a) shows that the magnitude of the small-signal current gain decreases
with increasing frequency. At frequency fT , which is the cutoff frequency, this gain
goes to 1. The cutoff frequency is a ﬁgure of merit for transistors.
From Equation (7.67), we can write the small-signal current gain in the form

Frequency fβ is also called the bandwidth of the transistor. Therefore, from
Equation (7.72(b)), the cutoff frequency fT is the gain–bandwidth product of the tran-
sistor, or more commonly the unity-gain bandwidth. From Equation (7.68), the
unity-gain bandwidth is
fT = βo

(7.73)
Since the capacitances are a function of the size of the transistor, we see again that
high frequency transistors imply small device sizes.
The cutoff frequency fT is also a function of the dc collector current IC, and the gen-
eral characteristic of fT versus IC is shown in Figure 7.40. The transconductance gm is
directly proportional to IC, but only a portion of Cπ is related to IC. The cutoff frequency
is therefore lower at low collector current levels. However, the cutoff frequency also de-
creases at high current levels, in the same way that β decreases at large currents.
The cutoff frequency or unity-gain bandwidth of a transistor is usually speciﬁed
on the device data sheets. Since the low-frequency current gain is also given, the beta
cutoff frequency, or bandwidth, of the transistor can be determined from
fβ = fT

Chapter 7 Frequency Response

The cutoff frequency of the general-purpose 2N2222A discrete bipolar transis-
tor is fT = 300 MHz. For the MSC3130 discrete bipolar transistor, which has a spe-
cial surface mount package, the cutoff frequency is fT = 1.4 GHz. This tells us that
very small transistors fabricated in integrated circuits can have cutoff frequencies in
the low GHz range.
EXAMPLE 7.9
Objective: Calculate the bandwidth fβ and capacitance Cπ of a bipolar transistor.
Consider a bipolar transistor that has parameters fT = 20 GHz at IC = 1 mA,
βo = 120, and Cμ = 0.08 pF.
Solution: From Equation (7.74), we ﬁnd the bandwidth as
fβ = fT

→fβ = 167 MHz
The transconductance is

The Cπ capacitance is determined from Equation (7.73). We have
fT =

2π(Cπ + Cμ)
or
20 × 109 =
38.5 × 10−3
2π(Cπ + 0.08 × 10−12)
which yields Cπ = 0.226 pF.
Comment: Although the value of Cπ may be much larger than that of Cμ, Cμ can-
not be neglected in circuit applications as we will see in the next section.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 7.9: A BJT is biased at IC = 0.15 mA, and has parameters βo = 150,
Cπ = 0.8 pF, and Cμ = 0.012 pF. Determine fβ and fT . (Ans. fβ = 7.54 MHz,
fT = 1.13 GHz)
The hybrid-π equivalent circuit for the bipolar transistor uses discrete or lumped
elements. However, when cutoff frequencies are on the order of fT ∼= 10 GHz and
the transistor is operated at microwave frequencies, other parasitic elements and dis-
tributed parameters must be included in the transistor model. For simplicity, we will
assume in this text that the hybrid-π model is sufﬁcient to model the transistor char-
acteristics up through the beta cutoff frequency.
Miller Effect and Miller Capacitance
As previously mentioned, the Cμ capacitance cannot in reality be ignored. The Miller
effect, or feedback effect, is a multiplication effect of Cμ in circuit applications.

The transistor model is the simplified hybrid-π circuit shown in Figure 7.38
(assuming ro = ∞). Capacitor Cμ is a feedback element that connects the output
back to the input. The output voltage and current will therefore influence the input
characteristics.
The presence of Cμ complicates the analysis. Previously, we could write KCL
equations at the input and output nodes and derive an expression for the current gain.
Here, however, we will approach the problem differently. We will treat capacitor Cμ
as a two-port network and will develop an equivalent circuit, with elements between
the input base and ground and between the output collector and ground. This proce-
dure may appear more complicated, but it will demonstrate the effect of Cμ more
clearly.
Consider the circuit segment between the two dotted lines in Figure 7.41(b). We
can treat this section as a two-port network, as shown in Figure 7.42. The input volt-
age is Vπ and the output voltage is Vo. Also, the input and output currents, I1 and I2,
are deﬁned as shown in the ﬁgure.
Writing KVL equations at the input and output terminals, we now have

output to a Norton equivalent circuit, as shown in Figure 7.43(b).

Figure 7.44 Small-signal equivalent circuit, including the two-port equivalent model of
capictor Cμ
The equivalent circuit in Figure 7.43(b) replaces the circuit segment between the
dotted lines in Figure 7.41(b), and the modiﬁed circuit is shown in Figure 7.44. To
evaluate this circuit, we will make some simplifying approximations.
Typical values of gm and Cμ are gm = 50 mA/V and Cμ = 0.05 pF. From these
values, we can calculate the frequency at which the magnitudes of the two dependent
current sources are equal. If
ωCμVπ = gmVπ
(7.76(a))
then
f =

=
50 × 10−3
2π(0.05 × 10−12) = 1.59 × 1011 Hz ⇒159 GHz
(7.76(b))
Since the frequency of operation of bipolar transistors is far less than 159 GHz, the
current source Isc = jωCμVπ is negligible compared to the gmVπ source.
We can now calculate the frequency at which the magnitude of the impedance of
Cμ is equal to RC∥RL. If

circuits, then

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
If the frequency of operation of the bipolar transistor is very much smaller than
1.59 GHz, then the impedance of Cμ will be much greater than RC∥RL and Cμ can
be considered an open circuit. Using these approximations, the circuit in Figure 7.44
reduces to that shown in Figure 7.45.
The I1 versus Vπ characteristic of the circuit segment between the dotted lines is
I1 = Vπ −Vo
1
jωCμ
= jωCμ(Vπ −Vo)
(7.79)
The output voltage is
Vo = −gmVπ(RC∥RL)
(7.80)
Substituting Equation (7.80) into (7.79), we obtain
I1 = jωCμ[1 + gm(RC∥RL)]Vπ
(7.81)
In Figure 7.45, the circuit segment between the dotted lines can be replaced by
an equivalent capacitance given by
CM = Cμ[1 + gm(RC∥RL)]
(7.82)
as shown in Figure 7.46. Capacitance CM is called the Miller capacitance, and the
multiplication effect of Cµ is the Miller effect.
For the equivalent circuit in Figure 7.46, the input capacitance is now Cπ + CM,
rather than just Cπ if Cμ had been ignored.
EXAMPLE 7.10
Objective: Determine the 3 dB frequency of the current gain for the circuit shown in
Figure 7.46, both with and without the effect of CM.
The circuit parameters are: RC = RL = 4 k, rπ = 2.6 k, RB = 200 k,
Cπ = 0.8 pF, Cμ = 0.05 pF, and gm = 38.5 mA/V.

The Miller capacitance is
CM = Cμ[1 + gm(RC∥RL)] = (0.05)[1 + (38.5)(4∥4)] = 3.9 pF
Taking into account the Miller capacitance, the 3 dB frequency is
f3 –dB =

=
1
2π[(200 × 103)∥(2.6 × 103)][0.8 + 3.9](10−12) ⇒13.2 MHz
Comment: The Miller effect, or multiplication factor of Cμ, is 78, giving a Miller
capacitance of CM = 3.9 pF. The Miller capacitance, in this case, is approximately
a factor of ﬁve larger than Cπ. This means that the actual transistor bandwidth is
approximately six times less than the bandwidth expected if Cμ is neglected.
The Miller capacitance, from Equation (7.82), can be written in the form
CM = Cμ(1 + |Av|)
(7.83)
where Av is the internal base-to-collector voltage gain. The physical origin of the
Miller effect is in the voltage gain factor appearing across the feedback element Cμ.
A small input voltage Vπ produces a large output voltage Vo = −|Av| · Vπ of the op-
posite polarity at the output of Cμ. Thus the voltage across Cμ is (1 + |Av|)Vπ,
which induces a large current through Cμ. For this reason, the effect of Cμ on the
input portion of the circuit is signiﬁcant.
We can now see one of the trade-offs that can be made in an ampliﬁer design.
The tradeoff is between ampliﬁer gain and bandwidth. If the gain is reduced, then the
Miller capacitance will be reduced and the bandwidth will be increased. We will con-
sider this tradeoff again when we consider the cascode ampliﬁer later in the chapter.

Discussion: In Equation (7.80), we assumed that | jωCμ| ≪gm, which is valid even
for frequencies in the 100 MHz range. If jωCμ is not negligible, we can write
gmVπ + Vo


(7.84)
Equation (7.84) implies that a capacitance Cμ should be in parallel with RC and RL
in the output portion of the equivalent circuit in Figure 7.44. For RC = RL = 4 k
and Cμ = 0.05 pF, we indicated that this capacitance is negligible for f ≪1.5 GHz.
However, in special circuits involving, for example, active loads, the equivalent RC
and RL resistances may be on the order of 100 k. This means that the Cμ capaci-
tance in the output part of the circuit is not negligible for frequencies even in the low-
megahertz range. We will consider a few special cases in which Cμ in the output
circuit is not negligible.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 7.10: For the circuit in Figure 7.41(a), the parameters are R1 = 200 k,
R2 = 220 k,
RC = 2.2 k,
RL = 4.7 k,
RE = 1 k, rs = 100 k,
and
VCC = 5 V. The transistor parameters are βo = 100, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, VA = ∞,
and Cπ = 1 pF. Consider the simpliﬁed hybrid-π model of the transistor. (a) De-
termine the midband current gain Ai = Io/Ii. (b) Find the Miller capacitance CM
for (i) Cμ = 0 and (ii) Cμ = 0.08 pF. (c) Determine the upper 3 dB frequency for
(i) Cμ = 0 and (ii) Cμ = 0.08 pF. (Ans. (a)Ai = −30.24; (b) (i) CM = 0 ,
(ii) CM = 4.38 pF; (c) (i) f3dB = 60.2 MHz, (ii) f3dB = 11.2 MHz)
Physical Origin of the Miller Effect
Figure 7.47(a) shows the hybrid-π equivalent circuit of the bipolar transistor with a
load resistor RC connected at the output. Figure 7.47(b) shows the equivalent circuit
with the Miller capacitance. As a ﬁrst approximation, the output voltage is
vo = −gmvπ RC. Assuming sinusoidal signals, Figure 7.48 shows the input signal vπ
and the output signal vo. As we have noted previously, the output signal is 180 de-
grees out of phase with respect to the input signal. In addition, because of the gain,
the magnitude of the output voltage is larger than the input voltage. The difference
between vπ and vo is the voltage across the Cμ capacitor as seen in Figure 7.47(a).

We may write the sinusoidal signals as vπ = Vπe jωt, vo = Voe jωt, and vc =
Vce jωt. The current ic through the capacitor Cμ can be written as
ic = Cμ
dvc
dt
(7.85(a))
Using phasor notation, we ﬁnd
Ic = jωCμVc
(7.85(b))
This current inﬂuences the input impedance looking into the base terminal of the
transistor.
For the two circuits shown in Figures 7.47(a) and 7.47(b) to be equivalent, the
current ic in the two circuits must be the same. From Figure 7.47(b), we can write
iC = CM
dvπ
dt
(7.86(a))
or using phasors, we have
Ic = jωCMVπ
(7.86(b))
For the two capacitor currents in Equations (7.85(b)) and (7.86(b)) to be equal, we
must have
CμVc = CMVπ
(7.87)
From the signals shown in Figure 7.48, we see that Vπ < Vc so that we must
have CM > Cμ. Because of the 180 degree phase shift and voltage gain, the voltage
across Cμ is quite large leading to a relatively signiﬁcant value of capacitor current
ic. In order to have the current in the Miller capacitor CM be the same with a smaller
voltage across CM, the value of CM must be relatively large. This, then, is the physi-
cal origin of the Miller multiplication effect.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE: THE FET
Objective: • Determine the frequency response of the MOS transis-
tor, and determine the Miller effect and Miller capacitance.
We have considered the expanded hybrid-π equivalent circuit of the bipolar transis-
tor that models the high-frequency response of the transistor. We will now develop
the high-frequency equivalent circuit of the FET that takes into account various
capacitances in the device. We will develop the model for a MOSFET, but it also
applies to JFETs and MESFETs.
High-Frequency Equivalent Circuit
We will construct the small-signal equivalent circuit of a MOSFET from the basic
MOSFET geometry, as described in Chapter 3. Figure 7.49 shows a model based on
the inherent capacitances and resistances in an n-channel MOSFET, as well as the
elements representing the basic device equations. We make one simplifying assump-
tion in the equivalent circuit: The source and substrate are both tied to ground.
Two capacitances connected to the gate are inherent in the transistor. These ca-
pacitances, Cgs and Cgd, represent the interaction between the gate and the channel

inversion charge near the source and drain terminals, respectively. If the device is
biased in the nonsaturation region and vDS is small, the channel inversion charge is
approximately uniform, which means that
Cgs ∼= Cgd ∼=

W LCox
where Cox(F/cm2) = ϵox/tox. The parameter ϵox is the oxide permittivity, which for
silicon MOSFETs is ϵox = 3.9ϵo, where ϵo = 8.85 × 10−14 F/cm is the permittivity
of free space. The parameter tox is the oxide thickness in cm.
However, when the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the channel is
pinched off at the drain and the inversion charge is no longer uniform. The value of
Cgd essentially goes to zero, and Cgs approximately equals (2/3)W LCox. As an ex-
ample, if a device has an oxide thickness of 100 Å, a channel length of L = 0.18 μm,
and a channel width of W = 20 μm, the value of Cgs is Cgs ∼= 8.3 fF. The value of
Cgs changes as the device size changes, but typical values are in the tens of femto-
farads range.
The remaining two gate capacitances, Cgsp and Cgdp, are parasitic or overlap
capacitances, so called because, in actual devices, the gate oxide overlaps the source
and drain contacts, because of tolerances or other fabrication factors. As we will see,
the drain overlap capacitance Cgdp lowers the bandwidth of the FET. The parameter
Cds is the drain-to-substrate pn junction capacitance, and rs and rd are the series re-
sistances of the source and drain terminals. The internal gate-to-source voltage con-
trols the small-signal channel current through the transconductance.
The small-signal equivalent circuit for the n-channel common-source MOSFET
is shown in Figure 7.50. Voltage V ′
gs is the internal gate-to-source voltage that con-
trols the channel current. We will assume that the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain
capacitances, Cgs and Cgd, contain the parasitic overlap capacitances. One parame-
ter, ro, shown in Figure 7.50 is not shown in Figure 7.49. This resistance is associated
with the slope of ID versus VDS. In the ideal MOSFET biased in the saturation re-
gion, ID is independent of VDS, which means that ro is inﬁnite. However, ro is ﬁnite
in short-channel-length devices, because of channel-length modulation, and is there-
fore included in the equivalent circuit.
Source resistance rs can have a signiﬁcant effect on the transistor characteristics.
To illustrate, Figure 7.51 shows a simpliﬁed low-frequency equivalent circuit in-
cluding rs but not ro. For this circuit, the drain current is

Equation (7.90) shows that the source resistance reduces the effective transconduc-
tance, or the transistor gain.
The equivalent circuit of a p-channel MOSFET is exactly the same as that of an
n-channel device, except that all voltage polarities and current directions are re-
versed. The capacitances and resistances are the same for both models.
Unity-Gain Bandwidth
As for the bipolar transistor, the unity-gain frequency or bandwidth is a ﬁgure of
merit for the FETs. If we neglect rs, rd, ro, and Cds, and connect the drain to signal
ground, the resulting equivalent small-signal circuit is shown in Figure 7.52. Since
the input gate impedance is no longer inﬁnite at high frequency, we can deﬁne
the short-circuit current gain. From that we can deﬁne and calculate the unity-gain
bandwidth.

fT =

2π(Cgs + Cgd)
(7.97)
The unity-gain frequency or bandwidth is a parameter of the transistor and is inde-
pendent of the circuit.
EXAMPLE 7.11
Objective: Determine the unity-gain bandwidth of an FET. 
Consider an n-channel MOSFET with parameters 
Kn = 1.5 mA/V2,
VT N = 0.4 V, λ = 0, Cgd = 10 fF, and Cgs = 50 fF. Assume the transistor is biased
at VGS = 0.8 V.
Solution: The transconductance is
gm = 2Kn(VGS −VT N) = 2(1.5)(0.8 −0.4) = 1.2 mA/V
From Equation (7.97), the unity-gain bandwidth, or frequency, is
fT =
gm
2π(Cgs + Cgd) =
1.2 × 10−3
2π(50 + 10) × 10−15 = 3.18 × 109 Hz
or
fT = 3.18 GHz
Comment: As with bipolar transistors, high-frequency FETs require small capaci-
tances and a small device size.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 7.11: The parameters of an n-channel MOSFET are Kn = 1.2 mA/V2,
VT N = 0.5 V, λ = 0, Cgd = 8 fF, and Cgs = 60 fF. The unity-gain frequency is
found to be fT = 3 GHz. Determine the transconductance and the bias current of
the MOSFET. (Ans. gm = 1.282 mA/V, IDQ = 0.342 mA)
Typically, values of Cgs for MOSFETs are in the range of 10 to 50 fF and values
of Cgd are typically from 0.1 to 0.5 fF.

518
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
As previously stated, the equivalent circuit is the same for MOSFETs, JFETS,
and MESFETs. For JFETs, and MESFETS, capacitances Cgs and Cgd are depletion
capacitances rather than oxide capacitances. Typically, for JFETs, Cgs and Cgd are
larger than for MOSFETs, while the values for MESFETs are smaller. Also, for
MESFETs fabricated in gallium arsenide, the unity-gain bandwidths may be in the
range of tens of GHz. For this reason, gallium arsenide MESFETs are often used in
microwave ampliﬁers.
Miller Effect and Miller Capacitance
As for the bipolar transistor, the Miller effect and Miller capacitance are factors in
the high-frequency characteristics of FET circuits. Figure 7.53 is a simpliﬁed high-
frequency transistor model, with a load resistor RL connected to the output. We will
determine the current gain in order to demonstrate the impact of the Miller effect.

ter CM is the Miller capacitance and is given by

Equation (7.102) clearly shows the effect of the parasitic drain overlap capaci-
tance. When the transistor is biased in the saturation region, as in an ampliﬁer circuit,

EXAMPLE 7.12
Objective: Determine the Miller capacitance and cutoff frequency of an FET circuit.
The n-channel MOSFET described in Example 7.11 is biased at the same cur-
rent, and a 10 k load is connected to the output.
Solution: From Example 7.11, the transconductance is gm = 1.2 mA/V. The Miller
capacitance is therefore
CM = Cgd(1 + gm RL) = (10)[1 + (1.2)(10)] = 130 fF
From Equation (7.106), the cutoff frequency is

or

Comment: The Miller effect and equivalent Miller capacitance reduce the cutoff
frequency of an FET circuit, just as they do in a bipolar circuit.

Figure 7.56 Common-emitter ampliﬁer
In the last sections, we developed the high-frequency equivalent circuits for the bipo-
lar and ﬁeld-effect transistors. We also discussed the Miller effect, which occurs
when transistors are operating in a circuit conﬁguration. In this section, we will ex-
pand our analysis of the high-frequency characteristics of transistor circuits.
Initially, we will look at the high-frequency response of the common-emitter and
common-source conﬁgurations. We will then examine common-base and common-
gate circuits, and a cascode circuit that is a combination of the common-emitter and
common-base circuits. Finally, we will analyze the high-frequency characteristics of
emitter-follower and source-follower circuits. In the following examples, we will use
the same basic bipolar transistor circuit so that a good comparison can be made be-
tween the three circuit conﬁgurations.
Common-Emitter and Common-Source Circuits
The transistor capacitances and the load capacitance in the common-emitter ampli-
ﬁer shown in Figure 7.56 affect the high-frequency response of the circuit. Initially,
we will use a hand analysis to determine the effects of the transistor on the high-
frequency response. In this analysis, we will assume that CC and CE are short cir-
cuits, and CL is an open circuit. A computer analysis will then be used to determine
the effect of both the transistor and load capacitances.
The high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit of the common-emitter
circuit is shown in Figure 7.57(a) in which CL is assumed to be an open circuit. We
replace the capacitor Cμ with the equivalent Miller capacitance CM as shown in
Figure 7.57(b). From our previous analysis of the Miller capacitance, we can write
CM = Cμ(1 + gm R′
L)
(7.107)
where the output resistance R′
L is ro∥RC∥RL.
The upper 3 dB frequency can be determined by using the time constant tech-
nique. We can write
fH =

where τP = ReqCeq. In this case, the equivalent capacitance is Ceq = Cπ + CM, and
the equivalent resistance is the effective resistance seen by the capacitance, Req =
rπ∥RB∥RS. The upper corner frequency is therefore
fH =

2π[rπ∥RB∥RS](Cπ + CM)

EXAMPLE 7.13
Objective: Determine the upper corner frequency and midband gain of a common-
emitter circuit.
For the circuit in Figure 7.56, the parameters are: V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V,
RS = 0.1 k, R1 = 40 k, R2 = 5.72 k, RE = 0.5 k, RC = 5 k, and RL =

35 pF, and Cμ = 4 pF.
Solution: From a dc analysis, we ﬁnd IC Q = 1.03 mA. The small-signal parameters
are therefore gm = 39.6 mA/V and rπ = 3.79 k.
The Miller capacitance is then
CM = Cμ(1 + gm R′

or
CM = (4)[1 + (39.6)(5∥10)] = 532 pF

Comments: This example demonstrates the importance of the Miller effect. The
feedback capacitance Cμ is multiplied by a factor of 133 (from 4 pF to 532 pF), and
the resulting Miller capacitance CM is approximately 15 times larger than Cπ. The
actual corner frequency is therefore approximately 15 times smaller than it would be
if Cμ were neglected.
PSpice Veriﬁcation: Figure 7.59 shows the results of a PSpice analysis of this
common-emitter circuit. The computer values are: Cπ = 35.5 pF and Cμ = 3.89 pF.
The curve marked “Cπ only” is the circuit frequency response if Cμ is neglected; the
curve marked “Cπ and Cμ only” is the response due to Cπ, Cμ, and the Miller effect.
These curves illustrate that the bandwidth of this circuit is drastically reduced by the
Miller effect.
The corner frequency is approximately 2.5 MHz and the midband gain is 125,
which agree very well with the hand analysis results.

The curves marked “CL = 5 pF” and “CL = 150 pF” show the circuit response
if the transistor is ideal, with zero Cπ and Cμ capacitances and a load capacitance
connected to the output. These results show that, for CL = 5 pF, the circuit re-
sponse is dominated by the Cπ and Cμ capacitances of the transistor. However, if a
large load capacitance, such as CL = 150 pF, is connected to the output, the circuit
response is dominated by the CL capacitance.

The high-frequency response of the common-source circuit is similar to that of
the common-emitter circuit, and the discussion and conclusions are the same.
Capacitance Cπ is replaced by Cgs, and Cμ is replaced by Cgd. The high-frequency
small-signal equivalent circuit of the FET is then essentially identical to that of the
bipolar transistor.
Common-Base, Common-Gate, 
and Cascode Circuits
As we have just seen, the bandwidth of the common-emitter and common-source cir-
cuits is reduced by the Miller effect. To increase the bandwidth, the Miller effect, or
the Cμ multiplication factor, must be minimized or eliminated. The common-base
and common-gate ampliﬁer conﬁgurations achieve this result. We will analyze a
common-base circuit; the analysis is the same for the common-gate circuit.
Common-Base Circuit
Figure 7.61 shows a common-base circuit. The circuit conﬁguration is the same as
the common-emitter circuit considered previously, except a bypass capacitor is
added to the base and the input is capacitively coupled to the emitter.
Figure 7.62(a) shows the high-frequency equivalent circuit, with the coupling
and bypass capacitors replaced by short circuits. Resistors R1 and R2 are then effec-
tively short circuited. Also, resistance ro is assumed to be inﬁnite. Capacitance Cμ,
which led to the multiplication effect, is no longer between the input and output ter-
minals. One side of capacitor Cμ is tied to signal ground.

For the input portion of the circuit, the upper 3 dB frequency is given by

(7.115(a))
where the time constant is
τPμ = [RC∥RL] · Cμ
(7.115(b))
If Cμ is much smaller than Cπ, we would expect the 3 dB frequency fHπ due to
Cπ to dominate the high-frequency response. However, the factor rπ/(1 + β) in the
time constant τPπ is small; therefore, the two time constants may be the same order
of magnitude.
EXAMPLE 7.14
Objective: Determine the upper corner frequencies and midband gain of a common-
base circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 7.61 with circuit parameters V + = 5 V,
V −= −5 V, RS = 0.1 k, R1 = 40 k, R2 = 5.72 k, RE = 0.5 k, RC = 5 k,
and RL = 10 k. (These are the same values as those used for the common-emitter
circuit in Example 7.13.) The transistor parameters are: β = 150, VBE(on) = 0.7 V,
VA = ∞, Cπ = 35 pF, and Cμ = 4 pF.
Solution: The dc analysis is the same as in Example 7.13; therefore, IC Q = 1.03 mA,
gm = 39.6 mA/V, and rπ = 3.79 k. The time constant associated with Cπ is

Comment: The results of this example show that the bandwidth of the common-base
circuit is limited by the capacitance Cμ in the output portion of the circuit. The band-
width of this particular circuit is 12 MHz, which is approximately a factor of four
greater than the bandwidth of the common-emitter circuit in Example 7.14.
Computer Veriﬁcation: Figure 7.63 shows the results of a PSpice analysis of the
common-base circuit. The computer values are Cπ = 35.5 pF and Cμ = 3.89 pF,
which are the same as those in Example 7.13. The curve marked “Cπ only” is the cir-
cuit frequency response if Cμ is neglected. The curve marked “Cπ and Cμ only” in-
cludes the effect of both Cπ and Cμ. As the hand analysis predicted, Cμ dominates
the circuit high-frequency response.
The corner frequency is approximately 13.5 MHz and the midband gain is 25.5,
both of which agree very well with the hand analysis results.

Cascode Circuit
The cascode circuit, as shown in Figure 7.65, combines the advantages of the common-
emitter and common-base circuits. The input signal is applied to the common-emitter
circuit (Q1), and the output signal from the common emitter is fed into the common-
base circuit (Q2). The input impedance to the common-emitter circuit (Q1) is rela-
tively large, and the load resistance seen by Q1 is the input impedance to the emitter
of Q2 and is fairly small. The low output resistance seen by Q1 reduces the Miller
multiplication factor on Cμ1 and therefore extends the bandwidth of the circuit.
Figure 7.66(a) shows the high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit. The
coupling and bypass capacitors are equivalent to short circuits, and resistance ro for
Q2 is assumed to be inﬁnite.

Transistors Q1 and Q2 are biased with essentially the same current; therefore,
rπ1 ∼= rπ2
and
gm1 ∼= gm2
Then
gm1rπ2 = β
which yields
CM1 ∼= 2 Cμ1
(7.118)
Equation (7.118) shows that this cascode circuit greatly reduces the Miller multipli-
cation factor.
The time constant related to Cπ2 involves resistance rπ2/(1 + β). Since this re-
sistance is small, the time constant is small, and the corner frequency related to Cπ2
is very large. We can therefore neglect the effects of Cμ1 and Cπ2 in the center por-
tion of the circuit.
The time constant for the input portion of the circuit is
τPπ = [RS∥RB1∥rπ1](Cπ1 + CM1)
(7.119(a))
where CM1 = 2Cμ1. The corresponding 3 dB frequency is
fHπ =

2πτPπ

Assuming CL acts as an open circuit, the time constant of the output portion of
the circuit, from Figure 7.66, is

and the corresponding corner frequency is

If we compare Equation (7.125) to Equation (7.110) for the common-emitter circuit,
we see that the expression for the midband gain of the cascode circuit is identical to
that of the common-emitter circuit. The cascode circuit achieves a relatively large
voltage gain, while extending the bandwidth.

Solution: Since β is large for each transistor, the quiescent collector current is es-
sentially the same in each transistor and is IC Q = 1.02 mA. The small-signal para-
meters are: rπ1 = rπ2 ≡rπ = 3.82 k and gm1 = gm2 ≡gm = 39.2 mA/V.
From Equation (7.119(a)), the time constant related to the input portion of the
circuit is
τPπ = [RS∥RB1∥rπ1](Cπ1 + CM1)
Since RB1 = R2∥R3 and CM1 = 2Cμ1, then
τPπ = [(0.1)∥20.5∥28.3∥3.82] × 103[35 + 2(4)] × 10−12 ⇒4.16 ns
The corresponding 3 dB frequency is
fHπ =

2πτPπ
=

2π(4.16 × 10−9) ⇒38.3 MHz
From Equation (7.120(a)), the time constant of the output portion of the circuit is
τPμ = [RC∥RL]Cμ2 = [5∥10] × 103(4 × 10−12) ⇒13.3 ns
and the corresponding 3 dB frequency is
fHμ =
1
2πτPμ

Comment: As was the case for the common-base circuit, the 3 dB frequency for the
cascode circuit is determined by capacitance Cμ in the output stage. The bandwidth
of the cascode circuit is 12 Mz, compared to approximately 3 MHz for the common-
emitter circuit. The midband voltage gains for the two circuits are essentially the
same.
Computer Veriﬁcation: Figure 7.67 shows the results of a PSpice analysis of the
cascode circuit. From the hand analysis, the two corner frequencies are 12 Mz and
38.3 MHz. Since these frequencies are fairly close, we expect the actual response to
show the effects of both capacitances. This hypothesis is veriﬁed and demonstrated

in the computer analysis results. The curves marked “Cπ only” and ““Cπ and Cμ
only” are fairly close together, and their slopes are steeper than −6 dB/octave, which
shows that more than one capacitor is involved in the response. At a frequency of
12 MHz, the response curve is 3 dB below the maximum asymptotic gain, and the
midband gain is 120. These values closely agree with the hand analysis results.
The curves marked “CL = 5 pF” and “CL = 150 pF” show the circuit response
if the transistor is ideal and only a load capacitance is included.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 7.15: The cascode circuit in Figure 7.65 has parameters V + = 12 V, V −= 0,
R1 = 58.8 k, R2 = 33.3 k, R3 = 7.92 k, RC = 7.5 k, RS = 1 k, RE =
0.5 k, and RL = 2 k. The transistor parameters are: β = 100, VBE(on) =
0.7 V, VA = ∞, Cπ = 24 pF, and Cμ = 3 pF. Let CL be an open circuit. (a) De-
termine the 3 dB frequencies corresponding to the input and output portions of the
equivalent circuit. (b) Calculate the small-signal midband voltage gain. (c) Corre-
late the results from parts (a) and (b) with a computer analysis. (Ans. (a) fHπ =
7.15 MHz, fHμ = 33.6 MHz, (b) |Av| = 22.5)
Emitter- and Source-Follower Circuits
In this section, we analyze the high-frequency response of the emitter follower. We
will analyze the same basic circuit conﬁguration that we have considered previously.
The results and discussions also apply to the source follower.
Figure 7.68 shows an emitter-follower circuit with the output signal at the
emitter capacitively coupled to a load. Figure 7.69(a) shows the high-frequency
small-signal equivalent circuit, with the coupling capacitors acting effectively as
short circuits.
We will rearrange the circuit so that we can gain a better insight into the circuit
behavior. We see that Cμ is tied to ground potential and also that ro is in parallel with
RE and RL. We may deﬁne
R′
L = RE∥RL∥ro
In this analysis we neglect the effect of CL. Figure 7.69(b) shows a rearrangement of
the circuit.

Since the emitter-follower circuit has a zero and two poles, a detailed analysis of
the circuit is very tedious. From Equations (7.126) and (7.127), we have
Vo = Vπ(yπ + gm)R′

EXAMPLE 7.16
Objective: Determine the frequency of a zero and a pole in the high-frequency
response of an emitter follower.
Consider the emitter-follower circuit in Figure 7.68 with parameters V + = 5 V,
V −= −5 V, RS = 0.1 k, R1 = 40 k, R2 = 5.72 k, RE = 0.5 k, and RL =
10 k. The transistor parameters are: β = 150, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, VA = ∞, Cπ =
35 pF, and Cμ = 4 pF.
Solution: As in previous examples, the dc analysis yields IC Q = 1.02 mA. There-
fore, gm = 39.2 mA/V and rπ = 3.82 k.
From Equation (7.132), the zero occurs at

Comment: The frequencies for the zero and the pole are very high and are not far
apart. This makes the calculations suspect. However, since the frequencies are high,
the emitter follower is a wide-bandwidth circuit.

536
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Computer Veriﬁcation: Figure 7.70 shows the results of a PSpice analysis of the
emitter follower. From the hand analysis, the 3 dB frequency is on the order of
281 MHz. However, the computer results show the 3 dB frequency to be approxi-
mately 400 MHz. We must keep in mind that at these high frequencies, distributed
parameter effects may need to be considered in the transistor to more accurately
predict the frequency response.
Also shown in the ﬁgure is the frequency response due to a 150 pF load capac-
itance. Comparing this result to the common-emitter circuit, for example, we see that
the bandwidth of the emitter-follower circuit is approximately two orders of magni-
tude larger.
High-Frequency Ampliﬁer Design
Our analysis shows that the frequency response, or the high-frequency cutoff point of
an ampliﬁer, depends on the transistor used, the circuit parameters, and the ampliﬁer
conﬁguration.
We also saw that a computer simulation is easier than a hand analysis, particu-
larly for the emitter-follower circuit. However, the parameters of the actual transistor
used in the circuit must be used in the simulation if it is to predict the circuit fre-
quency response accurately. Also, at high frequencies, additional parasitic capaci-
tances, such as the collector–substrate capacitance, may need to be included. This
was not done in our examples. Finally, in high-frequency ampliﬁers, the parasitic
capacitances of the interconnect lines between the devices in an IC may also be a
factor in the overall circuit response.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, the frequency response of transistor circuits was discussed. The ef-
fects due to circuit capacitors, such as coupling, bypass, and load capacitors, were
determined. In addition, expanded equivalent circuits of BJTs and MOSFETs
were analyzed to determine the frequency response of the transistors.
•
A time-constant technique was developed so that Bode plots can be constructed
without the need of deriving complex transfer functions. The high and low cor-
ner frequencies, or 3 dB frequencies, can be determined directly from the time
constants.
•
Coupling and bypass capacitors affect the low-frequency characteristics of a cir-
cuit, while load capacitors affect the high-frequency characteristics of a circuit.
•
The capacitances included in the small-signal equivalent circuits of both the
bipolar and MOS transistors result in reduced transistor gain at high frequencies.
The cutoff frequency is a ﬁgure of merit for the transistor and is deﬁned as the
frequency at which the magnitude of the current gain is unity.
•
The Miller effect is a multiplication of the base–collector or gate–drain capaci-
tance due to feedback between the output and input of the transistor. The band-
width of the ampliﬁer is reduced by this affect.
•
The common-emitter (common-source) ampliﬁer, in general, shows the greatest
reduction in bandwidth due to the Miller effect. The common-base (common-
gate) ampliﬁer has a larger bandwidth because of a smaller multiplication factor.
The cascode conﬁguration, a combination of a common emitter and common
base, combines the advantages of high gain and wide bandwith.
•
As an application, a two-stage BJT ampliﬁer was designed to meet speciﬁed
3 dB frequencies.

In previous chapters, we dealt mainly with small-signal voltage gains, current gains,
and impedance characteristics of linear ampliﬁers. In this chapter, we analyze and
design circuits that must deliver a speciﬁed power to a load. We will, therefore, be
concerned with power dissipation in transistors, especially in the output stage, since
the output stage must deliver the signal power. Linearity in the output signal is still a
priority, however. A ﬁgure of merit for the output stage linearity characteristic is the
total harmonic distortion that is present.
Various classes of power ampliﬁers are deﬁned. The ideal and actual power efﬁ-
ciencies of these classes of ampliﬁers are determined.

POWER AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Describe the concept of a power ampliﬁer.
A multistage ampliﬁer may be required to deliver a large amount of power to a
passive load. This power may be in the form of a large current delivered to a rela-
tively small load resistance such as an audio speaker, or may be in the form of a large
voltage delivered to a relatively large load resistance such as in a switching power
supply. The output stage of the power ampliﬁer must be designed to meet the power
requirements. In this chapter, we are interested only in power ampliﬁers using BJTs
or MOSFETS, and will not consider other types of power electronics that, for exam-
ple, use thyristors.
Two important functions of the output stage are to provide a low output resis-
tance so that it can deliver the signal power to the load without loss of gain and to
maintain linearity in the output signal. A low output resistance implies the use of
emitter-follower or source-follower circuit conﬁgurations. A measure of the linearity
of the output signal is the total harmonic distortion (THD). This ﬁgure of merit is
the rms value of the harmonic components of the output signal, excluding the funda-
mental, expressed as a percentage of the fundamental.
A particular concern in the design of the output stage is to deliver the required
signal power to the load efﬁciently. This speciﬁcation implies that the power dissi-
pated in the transistors of the output stage should be as small as possible. The output
transistors must be capable of delivering the required current to the load, and must be
capable of sustaining the required output voltage.
We will initially discuss power transistors and will then consider several output
stages of power ampliﬁers.
8.2
POWER TRANSISTORS
Objective: • Describe the characteristics of BJT and MOSFET power
transistors, and analyze the temperature and heat ﬂow characteristics
of devices using heat sinks.
In our previous discussions, we have ignored any physical transistor limitations in
terms of maximum current, voltage, and power. We implicitly assumed that the
transistors were capable of handling the current and voltage, and could handle the
power dissipated within the transistor without suffering any damage.
However, since we are now discussing power ampliﬁers, we must be concerned
with transistor limitations. The limitations involve: maximum rated current (on the
order of amperes), maximum rated voltage (on the order of 100 V), and maximum
rated power (on the order of watts or tens of watts).1 We will consider these effects
in the BJT and then in the MOSFET. The maximum power limitation is related to the
1We must note that, in general, the maximum rated current and maximum rated voltage cannot occur at the
same time.

Power BJTs
Power transistors are large-area devices. Because of differences in geometry and
doping concentrations, their properties tend to vary from those of the small-signal
devices. Table 8.1 compares the parameters of a general-purpose small-signal BJT to
those of two power BJTs. The current gain is generally smaller in the power transis-
tors, typically in the range of 20 to 100, and may be a strong function of collector
current and temperature. Figure 8.1 shows typical current gain versus collector cur-
rent characteristics for the 2N3055 power BJT at various temperatures. At high
current levels, the current gain tends to drop off signiﬁcantly, and parasitic resis-
tances in the base and collector regions may become signiﬁcant, affecting the
transistor terminal characteristics.
The maximum rated collector current IC,rated may be related to: the maximum
current that the wires connecting the semiconductor to the external terminals can
handle; the collector current at which the current gain falls below a minimum speci-
ﬁed value; or the current that leads to the maximum power dissipation when the tran-
sistor is in saturation.

Figure 8.2 Typical collector current versus collector–emitter voltage characteristics of a
bipolar transistor, showing breakdown effects
The maximum voltage limitation in a BJT is generally associated with avalanche
breakdown in the reverse-biased base–collector junction. In the common-emitter
conﬁguration, the breakdown voltage mechanism also involves the transistor gain,
as well as the breakdown phenomenon on the pn junction. Typical IC versus VC E
characteristics are shown in Figure 8.2. The breakdown voltage when the base termi-
nal is open circuited (IB = 0) is VC E O. From the data in Figure 8.2, this value is ap-
proximately 130 V.
When the transistor is biased in the active region, the collector current begins to
increase signiﬁcantly before breakdown voltage VC E O is reached, and all the curves
tend to merge to the same collector–emitter voltage once breakdown has occurred.
The voltage at which these curves merge is denoted VC E (sus) and is the minimum
voltage necessary to sustain the transistor in breakdown. From the data in Figure 8.2,
the value of VC E (sus) is approximately 115 V.
Another breakdown effect is called second breakdown, which occurs in a BJT
operating at high voltage and a fairly high current. Slight nonuniformities in current
density produce local regions of increased heating that decreases the resistance of the
semiconductor material, which in turn increases the current in those regions. This
effect results in positive feedback, and the current continues to increase, producing a
further increase in temperature, until the semiconductor material may actually melt,
creating a short circuit between the collector and emitter and producing a permanent
failure.
The instantaneous power dissipation in a BJT is given by
pQ = vC EiC + vBEiB
(8.1)
The base current is generally much smaller than the collector current; therefore, to a
good approximation, the instantaneous power dissipation is
pQ ∼= vC EiC
(8.2)
The average power, which is found by integrating Equation (8.2) over one cycle of
the signal, is

(b) logarithmic scales
The average power dissipated in a BJT must be kept below a speciﬁed maximum
value, to ensure that the temperature of the device remains below a maximum value.
If we assume that the collector current and collector–emitter voltage are dc quanti-
ties, then at the maximum rated power PT for the transistor, we can write
PT = VC E IC
(8.4)
The maximum current, voltage, and power limitations can be illustrated on the
IC versus VCE characteristics, as shown in Figure 8.3. The average power limitation
PT is a hyperbola described by Equation (8.4). The region where the transistor can be
operated safely is known as the safe operating area (SOA) and is bounded by
IC,max, VCE(sus), PT, and the transistor’s second breakdown characteristics curve.
Figure 8.3(a) shows the safe operating area, using linear current and voltage scales;
Figure 8.3(b) shows the same characteristics using logarithmic scales.
The iC–vCE operating point may move momentarily outside the safe operating
area without damaging the transistor, but this depends on how far the Q-point moves
outside the area and for how long. For our purposes, we will assume that the device
must remain within the safe operating area at all times.
EXAMPLE 8.1
Objective: Determine the required current, voltage, and power ratings of a power
BJT.
Consider the common-emitter circuit in Figure 8.4. The parameters are

Solution: For VC E ∼= 0, the maximum collector current is
IC(max) = VCC
RL

8 = 3 A
For IC = 0, the maximum collector–emitter voltage is
VC E(max) = VCC = 24 V
The load line is given by
VC E = VCC −IC RL
and must remain within the safe operating area, as shown in Figure 8.5.

The transistor power dissipation is therefore

The current at which the maximum power occurs is found by setting the derivative of
this equation equal to zero as follows:

2(8) = 1.5 A
The C–E voltage at the maximum power point is
VC E = VCC −IC RL = 24 −(1.5)(8) = 12 V
The maximum power dissipation in the transistor occurs at the center of the load line.
The maximum transistor power dissipation is therefore
PT = VC E IC = 12(1.5) = 18 W
Comment: To ﬁnd a transistor for a given application, safety factors are normally
used. For this example, a transistor with a current rating greater than 3 A, a voltage
rating greater than 24 V, and a power rating greater than 18 W would be required.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 8.1: Consider the common-emitter circuit shown in Figure 8.4. Assume the
transistor has limiting factors of: IC,max = 5 A, VC E(sus) = 30 V, and PT = 25 W.
Neglecting second breakdown effects, determine the minimum RL such that the
Q-point of the transistor stays within the safe operating area for: (a) VCC = 24 V
and (b) VCC = 12 V. In each case, determine the maximum collector current and
maximum transistor power dissipation. (Ans. (a) RL = 5.76 , IC,max = 4.17 A,
PQ,max = 25 W; (b) RL = 2.4 , IC,max = 5 A, PQ,max = 15 W)
Power transistors, which are designed to handle large currents, require large
emitter areas to maintain reasonable current densities. These transistors are usually
designed with narrow emitter widths to minimize the parasitic base resistance,

and may be fabricated as an interdigitated structure, as shown in Figure 8.6. Also,
emitter ballast resistors, which are small resistors in each emitter leg, are usually
incorporated in the design. These resistors help maintain equal currents in each B–E
junction.
Power MOSFETs
Table 8.2 lists the basic parameters of two n-channel power MOSFETs. The drain
currents are in the ampere range and the breakdown voltages are in the hundreds of

discussed for the BJTs.

Power MOSFETs differ from bipolar power transistors both in operating princi-
ples and performance. The superior performance characteristics of power MOSFETs
are: faster switching times, no second breakdown, and stable gain and response
time over a wide temperature range. Figure 8.7(a) shows the transconductance

transconductance is less than the variation in the BJT current gain shown in Figure 8.1.
Power MOSFETs are often manufactured by a vertical or double-diffused
process, called VMOS or DMOS, respectively. The cross section of a VMOS device
is shown in Figure 8.8(a) and the cross section of the DMOS device is shown in
Figure 8.8(b). The DMOS process can be used to produce a large number of closely
packed hexagonal cells on a single silicon chip, as shown in Figure 8.8(c). Also, such
MOSFETs can be paralleled to form large-area devices, without the need of an equiv-
alent emitter ballast resistance to equalize the current density. A single power
MOSFET chip may contain as many as 25,000 paralleled cells.
Since the path between the drain and the source is essentially resistive, the on
resistance rds(on) is an important parameter in the power capability of a MOSFET.
Figure 8.9 shows a typical rds(on) characteristic as a function of drain current. Values
in the tens of milliohm range have been obtained.

Comparison of Power MOSFETs and BJTs
Since a MOSFET is a high input impedance, voltage-controlled device, the drive cir-
cuitry is simpler. The gate of a 10 A power MOSFET may be driven by the output of
a standard logic circuit. In contrast, if the current gain of a 10 A BJT is β = 10, then
a base current of 1 A is required for a collector current of 10 A. However, this
required input current is much larger than the output drive capability of most logic
circuits, which means that the drive circuitry for power BJTs is more complicated.
The MOSFET is a majority carrier device. Majority carrier mobility decreases
with increasing temperature, which makes the semiconductor more resistive. This
means that MOSFETs are more immune to the thermal runaway effects and second
breakdown phenomena experienced in bipolars. Figure 8.7(b) shows typical ID
versus VGS characteristics at several temperatures, clearly demonstrating that at high
current levels, the current actually decreases with increasing temperature, for a given
gate-to-source voltage.
Heat Sinks
The power dissipated in a transistor increases its internal temperature above the
ambient temperature. If the device or junction temperature Tj becomes too high, the
transistor may suffer permanent damage. Special precautions must be taken in pack-
aging power transistors and in providing heat sinks so that heat can be conducted
from the transistor. Figures 8.10(a) and (b) show two packaging schemes, and Fig-
ure 8.10(c) shows a typical heat sink.
To design a heat sink for a power transistor, we must ﬁrst consider the concept
of thermal resistance θ, which has units of °C/W. The temperature difference,
T2 −T1, across an element with a thermal resistance θ is
T2 −T1 = Pθ

where P is the thermal power through the element. Temperature difference is the
electrical analog of voltage, and power or heat flow is the electrical analog of
current.
Manufacturers’ data sheets for power devices generally give the maximum
operating junction or device temperature Tj,max and the thermal resistance from the
junction to the case θjc = θdev−case.2 By deﬁnition, the thermal resistance between the
case and heat sink is θcase−snk, and between the heat sink and ambient is θsnk−amb.
The temperature difference between the device and the ambient can now be
written as follows, when a heat sink is used:
Tdev −Tamb = PD(θdev−case + θcase−snk + θsnk−amb)
(8.6)
where PD is the power dissipated in the device. Equation (8.6) may also be modeled
by its equivalent electrical elements, as shown in Figure 8.11. The temperature
difference across the elements, such as the case and heat sink, is the dissipated
power PD multiplied by the applicable thermal resistance, which is θcase−snk for this
example.
If a heat sink is not used, the temperature difference between the device and
ambient is written as
Tdev −Tamb = PD(θdev−case + θcase−amb)
(8.7)
where θcase−amb is the thermal resistance between the case and ambient.
EXAMPLE 8.2
Objective: Determine the maximum power dissipation in a transistor and determine
the temperature of the transistor case and heat sink.
Consider a power MOSFET for which the thermal resistance parameters are:
θdev−case = 1.75 ◦C/W
θcase−snk = 1 ◦C/W
θsnk−amb = 5 ◦C/W
θcase−amb = 50 ◦C/W
The ambient temperature is Tamb = 30 °C, and the maximum junction or device
temperature is Tj,max = Tdev = 150 °C.

Solution (Maximum Power): When no heat sink is used, the maximum device power
dissipation is found from Equation (8.7) as
PD,max =
Tj,max −Tamb
θdev−case + θcase−amb
= 150 −30
1.75 + 50 = 2.32 W
When a heat sink is used, the maximum device power dissipation is found from
Equation (8.6) as
PD,max =
Tj,max −Tamb
θdev−case + θcase−snk + θsnk−amb
=
150 −30
1.75 + 1 + 5 = 15.5 W
Solution (Temperature): The device temperature is T = 150 °C and the ambient
temperature is Tamb = 30 °C. The heat ﬂow is PD = 15.5 W. The heat sink tempera-
ture (see Figure 8.11) is found from
Tsnk −Tamb = PD · θsnk−amb
or
Tsnk = 30 + (15.5)(5) ⇒Tsnk = 107.5 ◦C
The case temperature is found from
Tcase −Tamb = PD · (θcase−snk + θsnk−case)
or
Tcase = 30 + (15.5)(1 + 5) ⇒T = 123 ◦C
Comment: These results illustrate that the use of a heat sink allows more power to
be dissipated in the device, while keeping the device temperature at or below its
maximum limit.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 8.2: A power BJT is operating with an average collector current of IC = 2 A
and an average collector–emitter voltage of VC E = 8 V. The device parameters are
θdev−case = 3 ◦C/W, θcase−snk = 1 ◦C/W, and θsnk−amb = 4 ◦C/W. The ambient
temperature is 25 ◦C. Determine the temperatures of the (a) device, (b) case, and
(c) heat sink. (Ans. (a) 153 ◦C, (b) 105 ◦C, (c) 89 ◦C)
The maximum safe power dissipation in a device is a function of: (1) the
temperature difference between the junction and case, and (2) the thermal resistance
between the device and the case θdev−case, or
PD,max = Tj,max −Tcase
θdev−case
(8.8)
A plot of PD,max versus Tcase, called the power derating curve of the transistor,
is shown in Figure 8.12. The temperature at which the power derating curve crosses
the horizontal axis corresponds to Tj, max. At this temperature, no additional tempera-
ture rise in the device can be tolerated; therefore, the allowed power dissipation must
be zero, which implies a zero input signal.

570
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
The rated power of a device is generally deﬁned as the power at which the
device reaches its maximum temperature, while the case temperature remains at
room or ambient temperature, that is, Tcase = 25 °C. Maintaining the case at ambient
temperature implies that the thermal resistance between the case and ambient is zero,
or that an inﬁnite heat sink is used. However, an inﬁnite heat sink is not possible.
With nonzero values of θcase−snk and θsnk−amb, the case temperature rises above the
ambient, and the maximum rated power of the device cannot be achieved. This effect
can be seen by examining the equivalent circuit model in Figure 8.11. If the device
temperature is at its maximum allowed value of Tdev = Tj,max, then as Tcase in-
creases, the temperature difference across θdev−case decreases, which means that
the power through the element must decrease.
EXAMPLE 8.3
Objective: Determine the maximum safe power dissipation in a transistor.
Consider a BJT with a rated power of 20 W and a maximum junction tempera-
ture of Tj,max = 175 ◦C. The transistor is mounted on a heat sink with parameters
θcase−snk = 1 ◦C/W and θsnk−amb = 5 ◦C/W.
Solution: From Equation (8.8), the device-to-case thermal resistance is
θdev−case = Tj,max −TOC
PD,rated
= 175 −25
20
= 7.5 ◦C/W
From Equation (8.6), the maximum power dissipation is
PD,max =
Tj,max −Tamb
θdev−case + θcase−snk + θsnk−amb
=
175 −25
7.5 + 1 + 5 = 11.1 W
Comment: The actual maximum safe power dissipation in a device may be less than
the rated value. This occurs when the case temperature cannot be held at the ambient
temperature, because of the nonzero thermal resistance factors between the case and
ambient.

CLASSES OF AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Deﬁne various classes of power ampliﬁers, and investi-
gate the characteristics, including power efﬁciency, of a few of these
ampliﬁers.

572
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Some power ampliﬁers are classiﬁed according to the percent of time the output
transistors are conducting, or “turned on.” Four of the principal classiﬁcations are:
class A, class B, class AB, and class C. These classiﬁcations are illustrated in Fig-
ure 8.15 for a sinusoidal input signal. In class-A operation, an output transistor is
biased at a quiescent current IQ and conducts for the entire cycle of the input signal.
For  class-B operation, an output transistor conducts for only one-half of each sine
wave input cycle. In class-AB operation, an output transistor is biased at a small
quiescent current IQ and conducts for slightly more than half a cycle. In contrast, in
class-C operation an output transistor conducts for less than half a cycle. These
four types of power ampliﬁers use the output transistors as a current source. We will
analyze the biasing, load lines, and power efﬁciency of each class of these power
ampliﬁers.
Another classiﬁcation of power ampliﬁers, including class D, class E, and class
F, uses the output transistors as switches. The output of the ampliﬁer is, in general, a
high-Q resonant RLC circuit. When the switch is closed, current and power are sup-
plied to the output resonant circuit. In the ideal case, when the switch is closed, there
is zero voltage across the switch, and when the switch is open, there is zero current
through the switch. In both cases, the ideal power dissipated in the switch is zero. The
power efﬁciency of these ampliﬁers can then approach 100 percent.
The intent of this chapter is to provide the basic characteristics of a few of these
power ampliﬁers. As usual, there are other types of power ampliﬁers and power elec-
tronics that are beyond the scope of this text, including high-frequency radio-frequency
(RF) circuit design.
Class-A Operation
The small-signal ampliﬁers considered in Chapters 4 and 6 were all biased for
class-A operation. A basic common-emitter conﬁguration is shown in Figure 8.16(a).
The bias circuitry has been omitted, for convenience. Also, in this standard class-A
ampliﬁer conﬁguration, no inductors or transformers are used.

The dc load line is shown in Figure 8.16(b). The Q-point is assumed to be in the
center of the load line, so that VC E Q = VCC/2. If a sinusoidal input signal is applied,
sinusoidal variations are induced in the collector current and collector–emitter volt-
age. The absolute possible variations are shown in the ﬁgure, although values of
vC E = 0 and iC = 2IC Q cannot actually be attained.
The instantaneous power dissipation in the transistor, neglecting the base
current, is
pQ = vC EiC
(8.9)
For a sinusoidal input signal, the collector current and collector-emitter voltage can
be written
iC = IC Q + Ip sin ωt
(8.10(a))
and
vC E = VCC
2
−Vp sin ωt
(8.10(b))
If we consider the absolute possible variations, then Ip = IC Q and Vp = VCC/2.
Therefore, the instantaneous power dissipation in the transistor, from Equa-
tion (8.9), is
pQ = VCC IC Q
2
(1 −sin2 ωt)
(8.11)
Figure 8.16(c) is a plot of the instantaneous transistor power dissipation. Since
the maximum power dissipation corresponds to the quiescent value (see Figure 8.5),
the transistor must be capable of handling a continuous power dissipation of
VCC IC Q/2 when the input signal is zero.
The power conversion efﬁciency is deﬁned as
η = signal load power( ¯PL)
supply power( ¯PS)
(8.12)
where ¯PL is the average ac power delivered to the load and ¯PS is the average power
supplied by the VCC power source(s). For the standard class-A ampliﬁer and

⇒25%
(8.15)
We must keep in mind that the maximum possible conversion efﬁciency may change
when a load is connected to the output of the ampliﬁer. This efﬁciency is relatively
low; therefore, standard class-A ampliﬁers are normally not used when signal powers
greater than approximately 1 W are required.
We must also emphasize that in practice, a maximum signal voltage of VCC/2 and
a maximum signal current of ICQ are not possible. The output signal voltage must be lim-
ited to smaller values in order to avoid transistor saturation and cutoff, and the resulting
nonlinear distortion. The calculation for the maximum possible efﬁciency also neglects
power dissipation in the bias circuitry. Consequently, the realistic maximum conversion
efﬁciency in a standard class-A ampliﬁer is on the order of 20 percent or less.
Design Pointer: In circuit analysis, the maximum power transfer theorem stated that
the load impedance should be matched to the ampliﬁer output impedance, which pro-
vides a 50 percent power conversion efﬁciency. However, in the design of power am-
pliﬁers, this theorem is not practical. For example, if 50 kW is to be delivered to an
antenna, then the circuit would also dissipate 50 kW if the power conversion efﬁ-
ciency were only 50 percent. In general, this amount of power being dissipated in the
ampliﬁer would be unacceptable. Power conversion efﬁciencies as close to 100 per-
cent as possible are desirable in very high power ampliﬁers.
EXAMPLE 8.4
Objective: Calculate the actual efﬁciency of a class-A output stage. 
Consider the common-source circuit in Figure 8.13. The circuit parameters are
VDD = 10 V and RD = 5 k, and the transistor parameters are: Kn = 1 mA/V2,
VT N = 1 V, and λ = 0. Assume the output voltage swing is limited to the range
between the transition point and vDS = 9 V, to minimize nonlinear distortion.
Solution: The load line is given by
VDS = VDD −ID RD
At the transition point, we have
VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N
and
ID = Kn(VGS −VT N)2
Combining these expressions, the transition point is determined from
VDS(sat) = VDD −Kn RDV 2
DS(sat)

575
or
(1)(5)V 2
DS(sat) + VDS(sat) −10 = 0
which yields
VDS(sat) = 1.32 V
To obtain the maximum symmetrical swing under the conditions speciﬁed, we want
the Q-point midway between VDS = 1.32 V and VDS = 9 V, or
VDSQ = 5.16 V
The maximum ac component of voltage across the load resistor is then
vr = 3.84 sin ωt
and the average power delivered to the load is
¯PL = 1
2 · (3.84)2
5
= 1.47 mW
The quiescent drain current is found to be
IDQ = 10 −5.16
5
= 0.968 mA
The average power supplied by the VDD source is
¯PS = VDDIDQ = (10)(0.968) = 9.68 mW
and the power conversion efﬁciency, from Equation (8.12), is
η =
¯PL
PS
= 1.47
9.68 ⇒15.2%
Comment: By limiting the swing in the drain–source voltage, to avoid nonsaturation
and cutoff and the resulting nonlinear distortion, we reduce the output stage power
conversion efﬁciency considerably, compared to the theoretical maximum possible
value of 25 percent for the standard class-A ampliﬁer.

Class-A operation also applies to the emitter-follower, common-base, source-
follower, and common-gate conﬁgurations. As previously stated, the circuits consid-
ered in Figures 8.13 and 8.16(a) are standard class-A ampliﬁers in that no inductors
or transformers are used. Later in this chapter, we will analyze inductively-coupled
and transformer-coupled power ampliﬁers that also operate in the class-A mode. We
will show that, for these circuits, the maximum conversion efﬁciency is 50 percent.
Class-B Operation
Idealized Class-B Operation
Figure 8.18(a) shows an idealized class-B output stage that consists of a comple-
mentary pair of electronic devices. When vI = 0, both devices are off, the bias
currents are zero, and vO = 0. For vI > 0, device A turns on and supplies current to
the load as shown in Figure 8.18(b). For vI < 0, device B turns on and sinks current

from the load as shown in Figure 8.18(c). Figure 8.18(d) shows the voltage transfer
characteristics. The ideal voltage gain is unity.
Approximate Class-B Circuit
Figure 8.19 shows an output stage that consists of a complementary pair of bipolar
transistors. When the input voltage is vI = 0, both transistors are cut off and the output
voltage is vO = 0. If we assume a B–E cut-in voltage of 0.6 V, then the output voltage
vO remains zero as long as the input voltage is in the range −0.6 ≤vI ≤+0.6 V.
If vI becomes positive and is greater than 0.6 V, then Qn turns on and operates as
an emitter follower. The load current iL is positive and is supplied through Qn, and the
B–E junction of Qp is reverse biased. If vI becomes negative by more than 0.6 V, then
Qp turns on and operates as an emitter follower. Transistor Qp is a sink for the load
current, which means that iL is negative.
This circuit is called a complementary push–pull output stage. Transistor Qn
conducts during the positive half of the input cycle, and Qp conducts during the
negative half-cycle. The transistors do not both conduct at the same time.
Figure 8.20 shows the voltage transfer characteristics for this circuit. When
either transistor is conducting, the voltage gain, which is the slope of the curve, is
essentially unity as a result of the emitter follower. Figure 8.21 shows the output
voltage for a sinusoidal input signal. When the output voltage is positive, the npn
transistor is conducting, and when the output voltage is negative, the pnp transistor is
conducting. We can see from this ﬁgure that each transistor actually conducts for
slightly less than half the time. Thus the bipolar push–pull circuit shown in Fig-
ure 8.19 is not exactly a class-B circuit.
We will see that an output stage using NMOS and PMOS transistors will
produce the same general voltage transfer characteristics.

From Figure 8.20, we see that there is a range of input voltage around zero volts where
both transistors are cut off and υO is zero. This portion of the curve is called the dead
band. The output voltage for a sinusoidal input voltage is shown in Figure 8.21. The
output voltage is not a perfect sinusoidal signal, which means that crossover distortion
is produced by the dead band region.

Crossover distortion can be virtually eliminated by biasing both Qn and Qp with
a small quiescent collector current when vI is zero. This technique is discussed in the
next section. The crossover distortion effect can also be minimized with an op-amp
used in a feedback conﬁguration. Op-amps are discussed in Chapter 9 and feedback
is discussed in Chapter 12, so this technique is not discussed here.
EXAMPLE 8.5
Objective: Determine the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the class B comple-
mentary push–pull output stage in Figure 8.19.
A PSpice analysis was performed, which yielded the harmonic content of the
output signal.
Solution: A 1 kHz sinusoidal signal with an amplitude of 2 V was applied to the
input of the circuit shown in Figure 8.19. The circuit was biased at ±10 V. The
transistors used in the circuit were 2N3904 npn and 2N3906 pnp devices. A 1 k
load was connected to the output.
The harmonic content for the ﬁrst nine harmonics is shown in Table 8.3. We see
that the output is rich in odd harmonics with the 3 kHz third harmonic being 18 per-
cent as large as the 1 kHz principal output signal. The total harmonic distortion is
19.7 percent, which is large.

value.

Idealized Power Efﬁciency
If we consider an idealized version of the circuit in Figure 8.19 in which the
base–emitter turn-on voltages are zero, then each transistor would conduct for
exactly one-half cycle of the sinusoidal input signal. This circuit would be an ideal
class-B output stage, and the output voltage and load current would be replicas of the
input signal. The collector–emitter voltages would also show the same sinusoidal
variation.
Figure 8.22 illustrates the applicable dc load line. The Q-point is at zero collec-
tor current, or at cutoff for both transistors. The quiescent power dissipation in each
transistor is then zero.
The output voltage for this idealized class-B output stage can be written
vO = Vp sin ωt
(8.16)
where the maximum possible value of Vp is VCC.
The instantaneous power dissipation in Qn is
pQn = vC EniCn
(8.17)
and the collector current is

for 0 ≤ωt ≤π, and

From Figure 8.22, we see that the collector–emitter voltage can be written as
vC En = VCC −Vp sin ωt
(8.19)

The average power dissipation in transistor Qp is exactly the same as that for Qn,

A plot of the average power dissipation in each transistor, as a function of Vp, is
shown in Figure 8.23. The power dissipation ﬁrst increases with increasing output
voltage, reaches a maximum, and ﬁnally decreases with increasing Vp. We determine
the maximum average power dissipation by setting the derivative of ¯PQn with respect

The actual conversion efﬁciency obtained in practice is less than the maximum
value because of other circuit losses, and because the peak output voltage must
remain less than VCC to avoid transistor saturation. As the output voltage amplitude
increases, output signal distortion also increases. To limit this distortion to an
acceptable level, the peak output voltage is usually limited to several volts below
VCC. From Figure 8.23 and Equation (8.23), we see that the maximum transistor
power dissipation occurs when Vp = 2VCC/π. At this peak output voltage, the con-
version efﬁciency of the class-B ampliﬁer is, from Equation (8.27),

Class-AB Operation
Crossover distortion can be virtually eliminated by applying a small quiescent bias
on each output transistor, for a zero input signal. This is called a class-AB output
stage and is shown schematically in the circuit in Figure 8.24. If Qn and Qp are
matched, then for vI = 0, VBB/2 is applied to the B–E junction of Qn, VBB/2 is
applied to the E–B junction of Qp, and vO = 0. The quiescent collector currents in
each transistor are given by
iCn = iCp = ISeVBB/2VT
(8.31)
As vI increases, the voltage at the base of Qn increases and vO increases. Tran-
sistor Qn operates as an emitter follower, supplying the load current to RL. The out-
put voltage is given by
vO = vI + VBB
2
−vBEn
(8.32)
and the collector current of Qn (neglecting base currents) is
iCn = iL + iCp
(8.33)
Since iCn must increase to supply the load current, vBEn increases. Assuming VBB
remains constant, as vBEn increases, vE Bp decreases resulting in a decrease in iCp.
8.3.3

582
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
As vI goes negative, the voltage at the base of Qp decreases and vO decreases.
Transistor Qp operates as an emitter follower, sinking current from the load. As iCp
increases, vE Bp increases, causing a decrease in vBEn and iCn.
Figure 8.25(a) shows the voltage transfer characteristics for this class-AB output
stage. If vBEn and vE Bp do not change signiﬁcantly, then the voltage gain, or the
slope of the transfer curve, is essentially unity. A sinusoidal input signal voltage and
the resulting collector currents and load current are shown in Figures 8.25(b), (c), and
(d). Each transistor conducts for more than one-half cycle, which is the deﬁnition of
class-AB operation.

(8.35)
The product of iCn and iCp is a constant; therefore, if iCn increases, iCp decreases, but
does not go to zero.
Since, for a zero input signal, quiescent collector currents exist in the output
transistors, the average power supplied by each source and the average power
dissipated in each transistor are larger than for a class-B conﬁguration. This means
that the power conversion efﬁciency for a class-AB output stage is less than that for
an idealized class-B circuit. In addition, the required power handling capability of
the transistors in a class-AB circuit must be slightly larger than in a class-B circuit.
However, since the quiescent collector currents ICQ are usually small compared to the
peak current, this increase in power dissipation is not great. The advantage of elimi-
nating crossover distortion in the class-AB output stage greatly outweighs the slight
disadvantage of reduced conversion efﬁciency and increased power dissipation.
EXAMPLE 8.6
Objective: Determine the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the class AB comple-
mentary push–pull output stage shown in Figure 8.24.
A PSpice analysis was performed, which yielded the harmonic content of the
output signal.
Solution: A 1 kHz sinusoidal signal with an amplitude of 2 V was applied to the
input of the circuit. The bias voltages VBB/2 were varied. The circuit was biased at
±10 V and a 1 k load was connected to the output. Shown in Table 8.4 are the
VBB/2 bias voltages applied, the quiescent transistor currents, and the total harmonic
distortion (THD).

Discussion: With a peak input voltage of 2 V and a 1 k load, the peak load current
is on the order of 2 mA. From the results shown in Table 8.4, the THD decreases as
the ratio of quiescent transistor current to peak load current increases. In other words,
for a given input voltage, the smaller the variation in collector current when the

584
Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
signal is applied compared to the quiescent collector current, the smaller the distor-
tion. However, there is a trade-off. As the quiescent transistor current increases, the
power efﬁciency is reduced. The circuit should be designed such that the transistor
quiescent current is the smallest value while meeting the maximum total harmonic
distortion speciﬁcation.
Comment: We see that the class-AB output stage results in a much smaller THD
value than the class-B circuit, but as with most circuits, there are no uniquely speci-
ﬁed bias voltages.
A class-AB output stage using enhancement-mode MOSFETs is shown in Fig-
ure 8.26. If Mn and Mp are matched, and if vI = 0, then VBB/2 is applied across the
gate–source terminals of Mn and the source–gate terminals of Mp. The quiescent
drain currents established in each transistor are given by

(8.36)
As vI increases, the voltage at the gate of Mn increases and vO increases. Transis-
tor Mn operates as a source follower, supplying the load current to RL. Since iDn must
increase to supply the load current, vGSn must also increase. Assuming VBB remains
constant, an increase in vGSn implies a decrease in vSGp and a resulting decrease in
iDp. As vI goes negative, the voltage at the base of Mp decreases and vO decreases.
Transistor Mp then operates as a source follower, sinking current from the load.

The source-to-gate voltage of Mp is

which means that Mp is cut off and iDn = iL. Finally, the input voltage is
vI = 5 + 2.12 −1.5 = 5.62 V
Comment: Since vI > vO, the voltage gain of this output stage is less than unity, as
expected.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 8.7: Consider the MOSFET class-AB output stage shown in Figure 8.26. The
circuit parameters are VDD = 15 V and RL = 25 . The transistors are matched
with parameters K = 0.25 A/V2 and |VT | = 1.2 V. The quiescent drain currents
are to be 20 percent of the load current when vO = 8 V. (a) Determine VBB and
(b) ﬁnd the small-signal voltage gain Av = dvO/dvI

(ii) vO = 8 V. (Ans. (a) VBB = 3.412 V; (b) (i) Av = 0.927, (ii) Av = 0.934)
Voltage VBB can be established in a MOSFET class-AB circuit by using addi-
tional enhancement-mode MOSFETs and a constant current IBias. This will be con-
sidered in a problem at the end of the chapter.
Class-C Operation
The transistor circuit ac load line, including an extension beyond cutoff, is shown in
Figure 8.27. For class-C operation, the transistor has a reverse-biased B–E voltage
at the Q-point. This effect is illustrated in Figure 8.27. Note that the collector cur-
rent is not negative, but is zero at the quiescent point. The transistor conducts only
when the input signal becomes sufﬁciently positive during its positive half-cycle.
The transistor therefore conducts for less than a half-cycle, which deﬁnes class-C
operation.
Class-C ampliﬁers are capable of providing large amounts of power, with con-
version efﬁciencies larger than 78.5 percent. These ampliﬁers are normally used for
radio-frequency (RF) circuits, with tuned RLC loads that are commonly used in radio

and television transmitters. The RLC circuits convert drive current pulses into sinu-
soidal signals. Since this is a specialized area, we will not analyze these circuits here.

Inductively Coupled Ampliﬁer
Delivering a large power to a load generally requires both a large voltage and a high
current. In a common-emitter circuit, this requirement can be met by replacing
the collector resistor with an inductor, as shown in Figure 8.28(a). The inductor is a
short circuit to a dc current, but acts as an open circuit to an ac signal operating at a
sufﬁciently high frequency. The entire ac current is therefore coupled to the load. We
assume that ωL ≫RL at the lowest signal frequency.
The dc and ac load lines are shown in Figure 8.28(b). We assume that the resis-
tance of the inductor is negligible, and that the emitter resistor value is small. The
quiescent collector–emitter voltage is then approximately VC E Q ∼= VCC. The ac
collector current is
ic = −vce
RL
(8.37)
To obtain the maximum symmetrical output-signal swing, which will in turn
produce the maximum power, we want
IC Q ∼= VCC
RL
(8.38)
For this condition, the ac load line intersects the vC E axis at 2VCC.
The use of an inductor or storage device results in an output ac voltage swing
that is larger than VCC. The polarity of the induced voltage across the inductor may be
such that the voltage adds to VCC, producing an output voltage that is larger than VCC.
The absolute maximum amplitude of the signal current in the load is IC Q; there-
fore, the maximum possible average signal power delivered to the load is

This demonstrates that, in a standard class-A ampliﬁer, replacing the collector resis-
tor with an inductor doubles the maximum possible power conversion efﬁciency.
Transformer-Coupled Common-Emitter Ampliﬁer
The design of an inductively coupled ampliﬁer to achieve high power conversion
efﬁciency may be difﬁcult, depending on the relationship between the supply voltage
VCC and the load resistance RL. The effective load resistance can be optimized by
using a transformer with the proper turns ratio.
Figure 8.29(a) shows a common-emitter ampliﬁer with a transformer-coupled
load in the collector circuit.
The dc and ac load lines are shown in Figure 8.29(b). If we neglect any resis-
tance in the transformer and assume that RE is small, the quiescent collector–emitter
voltage is
VC E Q ∼= VCC
Assuming an ideal transformer, the currents and voltages in Figure 8.29(a) are
related by iL = aiC and v2 = v1/a where a is the ratio of primary to secondary turns,
or simply the turns ratio. Dividing voltages by currents, we ﬁnd

where VCC and ICQ are the maximum possible amplitudes of the sinusoidal signals. If

where Vp is the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal output voltage. The maximum peak
amplitude of the emitter voltage is VCC, so that the maximum peak amplitude of the
output signal is

DESIGN EXAMPLE 8.8
Objective: Design a transformer-coupled emitter-follower ampliﬁer to deliver a
speciﬁed signal power.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 8.30(a), with parameters VCC = 24 V and
RL = 8 . The average power delivered to the load is to be 5 W, the peak amplitude
of the signal emitter current is to be no more than 0.9ICQ, and that of the signal emit-
ter voltage is to be no more than 0.9VCC. Let β = 100.
Solution: The average power delivered to the load is given by Equation (8.46). The
peak output voltage must therefore be
Vp =
	
2RL ¯PL =

2(8)(5) = 8.94 V
and the peak output current is
Ip = Vp
RL
= 8.94
8
= 1.12 A
Since
Ve = 0.9 VCC = aVp
then
a = 0.9 VCC
Vp
= (0.9)(24)
8.94
= 2.42
Also, since
Ie = 0.9IC Q = Ip/a
then
IC Q = 1
0.9 · Ip
a =
1.12
(0.9)(2.42) = 0.514 A
The maximum power dissipated in the transistor, for this class-A operation, is
PQ = VCC IC Q = (24)(0.514) = 12.3 W
so the transistor must be capable of handling this power.
Bias resistors R1 and R2 are found from a dc analysis. The Thevenin equivalent
voltage is
VT H = IBQ RT H + VBE(on)
where
RT H = R1∥R2
and
VT H = [R2/(R1 + R2)] · VCC

Chapter 8 Output Stages and Power Ampliﬁers
591
We also have
IBQ = IC Q
β
= 0.514
100 ⇒5.14 mA
Since VT H < VCC and IBQ ∼= 5 mA, then RT H cannot be unduly large. How-
ever, if RT H is small, then the power dissipation in R1 and R2 becomes unacceptably
high. We choose RT H = 2.5 k, so that
VT H = 1
R1
(RT H)VCC = 1
R1
(2.5)(24) = (5.14)(2.5) + 0.7
Therefore, R1 = 4.43 k and R2 = 5.74 k.
Comment: The average power delivered by VCC (neglecting bias resistor effects) is
¯PS = VCC IC Q = 12.3 W, which means that the power conversion efﬁciency is
η = 5/12.3 ⇒40.7%. The efﬁciency will always be less than the 50% maximum
value, if transistor saturation and distortion are to be minimized.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 8.8: A transformer-coupled emitter-follower ampliﬁer is shown in Fig-
ure 8.30(a). The parameters are: VCC = 18 V, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, β = 100, a = 10,
and RL = 8 . (a) Design R1 and R2 to deliver the maximum power to the load.
The input resistance seen by the vi source is to be 1.5 k. (b) If the peak ampli-
tude of the emitter voltage vE is limited to 0.9VCC, and the peak amplitude of the
emitter current iE is limited to 0.9ICQ, determine the maximum amplitude of the
output signal voltage, and the average power delivered to the load. (Ans. (a) R1 =

(a) Design R1 and R2 for maximum symmetrical swing in the output current and volt-
age. (Let RT H = (1 + β)RE.) (b) If the peak output voltage amplitude is limited to

average power delivered to the load, the average power dissipated in the transistor,
and the power conversion efﬁciency. (Ans. (a) R1 = 39.1 k, R2 = 9.43 k

Objective: • Analyze several circuit conﬁgurations of class-AB power

A class-AB output stage eliminates the crossover distortion that occurs in a class-B

bias to the output transistors. Such circuits are used as the output stage of power

ampliﬁers, as well as the output stage of operational ampliﬁers, and will be discussed
in Chapter 13.
Class-AB Output Stage with Diode Biasing
In a class-AB circuit, the VBB voltage that provides the quiescent bias for the output
transistors can be established by voltage drops across diodes, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.31. A constant current IBias is used to establish the required voltage across the
pair of diodes, or the diode-connected transistors, D1 and D2. Since D1 and D2 are not
necessarily matched with Qn and Qp, the quiescent transistor currents may not be
equal to IBias.
As the input voltage increases, the output voltage increases, causing an in-
crease in iCn. This in turn produces an increase in the base current iBn. Since the
increase in base current is supplied by IBias, the current through D1 and D2, and
hence the voltage VBB, decreases slightly. Since voltage VBB does not remain
constant in this circuit, the relationship between iCn and iCp, as given by Equa-
tion (8.35), is not precisely valid for this situation. The analysis in the previous sec-
tion must therefore be modiﬁed slightly, but the basic operation of this class-AB
circuit is the same.

Assume ISD = 3 × 10−14 A for D1 and D2, ISQ = 10−13 A for Qn and Qp, and
βn = βp = 75. Let RL = 8 . The average power delivered to the load is to be 5 W.
The peak output voltage is to be no more than 80 percent of VCC, and the minimum
value of diode current ID is to be no less than 5 mA.

Therefore,

The supply voltages must then be
VCC = Vp
0.8 = 8.94
0.8 = 11.2 V

For vO = 8.94 V and iL = 1.12 A, the base current is iBn = 14.7 mA, and

and
iCp = ISQevE Bp/VT = (10−13)e0.566/0.026 ⇒0.285 mA
Comment: When the output goes positive, the current in Qp decreases signiﬁcantly,
as expected, but it does not go to zero. There is a factor of approximately 103 differ-
ence in the currents between Qn and Qp.
Design Pointer: If the output signal currents are large, the base currents in the
output transistors may become signiﬁcant compared to the bias current through the
diodes D1 and D2. The change in the diode bias current should be minimized in order
to keep the small-signal voltage gain of the output stage close to unity.

meters are ISD = 1.2 × 10−14 A for the diodes and ISQ = 2 × 10−14 A for the
transistors. (a) Neglecting base currents, determine the value of IBias that induces
quiescent collector currents of IC Q = 1 mA. (b) Assuming βn = βp = 100, deter-
mine iCn, iCp, vBEn, vE Bp, and ID for vO = 1.2 V. (c) Repeat part (b) for vO = 3 V .

Class-AB Biasing Using the VBE Multiplier
An alternative biasing scheme, which provides more ﬂexibility in the design of the
output stage, is shown in Figure 8.32. The bias circuit that provides voltage VBB con-
sists of transistor Q1 and resistors R1 and R2, biased by a constant-current source IBias.
If we neglect the base current in Q1, then

and voltage VBB is
VBB = IR(R1 + R2) = VBE1

Since voltage VBB is a multiplication of the junction voltage VBE1, the circuit is called
a VBE multiplier. The multiplication factor can be designed to yield the required
value of VBB.

Also, the quiescent bias currents iCn and iCp are normally small; therefore, we can
neglect iBn and iBp. Current IBias divides between IR and IC1, satisfying both Equa-
tions (8.48) and (8 50).
As vI increases, vO becomes positive, and iCn and iBn increase, which reduces
the collector current in Q1. However, the logarithmic dependence of IC1, shown in
Equation (8.50), means that VBE1 and, in turn VBB remain essentially constant as the
output voltage changes.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 8.10
Objective: Design a Class-AB output stage using the VBE multiplier circuit to meet
a speciﬁed total harmonic distortion.
Assume the circuit in Figure 8.32, biased at V + = 15 V and V −= −15 V, is the
output stage of an audio ampliﬁer that is to drive another power ampliﬁer whose
input resistance is 1 k. The maximum peak sinusoidal output voltage is to be 10 V
and the total harmonic distortion is to be less than 0.1 percent.
Solution: Standard 2N3904 and 2N3906 transistors are to be used. From the results
of Example 8.6, the THD is a function of the output transistor quiescent currents. For
the basic circuit in Figure 8.24, the THD is found to be 0.097 percent for VBB =
1.346 V, quiescent collector currents of 0.88 mA, and a peak sinusoidal output volt-
age of 10 V.
Figure 8.33 is the PSpice circuit schematic. For a peak output voltage of 10 V,
the peak load current is 10 mA. Assuming β ∼= 100, the peak base current is 0.1 mA.

A bias current of 1 mA is chosen to bias the VBE multiplier. The peak 0.1 mA
base current, then, will not greatly disturb the current through the multiplier
circuit.
We may select IR = 0.2 mA (current through R1 and R2) and IC3 = 0.8 mA. We
then have
R1 + R2 = VBB
IR
= 1.346
0.2
= 6.73 k
For the 2N3904, we ﬁnd that VBE ∼= 0.65 V for a quiescent collector current of
approximately 0.8 mA. Therefore
R2 = VBE3
IR
= 0.65
0.2 = 3.25 k
so that R1 = 3.48 k.
From the PSpice results, we ﬁnd that the voltage at the base of Q1 to be
0.6895 V and the voltage at the base of Q2 to be −0.6961 V, which means that VBB =
1.3856 V. This voltage is slightly greater than the design value of VBB = 1.346 V.
Listed below are the quiescent transistor parameters. The quiescent collector
currents of the output transistors are 1.88 mA, approximately twice the design value
of 0.88 mA. The total harmonic distortion is 0.0356 percent, which is well within
the design speciﬁcation.

Comment: Since the resulting VBB voltage is slightly larger than the design value,
the quiescent output transistor currents are approximately double the design value.
Although the THD speciﬁcation is met, the larger collector currents mean a larger
quiescent power dissipation. For this reason, the circuit may need to be redesigned
slightly to lower the quiescent currents.
Class-AB Output Stage with Input 
Buffer Transistors
The output stage in Figure 8.34 is a class-AB conﬁguration composed of the com-
plementary transistor pair Q3 and Q4. Resistors R1 and R2 and the emitter-follower
transistors Q1 and Q2 establish the quiescent bias required in this conﬁguration.
Resistors R3 and R4, used in conjunction with short-circuit protection devices not
shown in the ﬁgure, also provide thermal stability for the output transistors. The
input signal vI may be the output of a low-power ampliﬁer. Also, since this is an
emitter follower, the output voltage is approximately equal to the input voltage.
8.5.3

Chapter 8 Output Stages and Power Ampliﬁers
597
When the input voltage vI increases from zero, the base voltage of Q3 increases,
and the output voltage vO increases. The load current iO is positive, and the emitter
current in Q3 increases to supply the load current, which causes an increase in the
base current into Q3. Since the base voltage of Q3 increases, the voltage drop across
R1 decreases, resulting in a smaller current in R1. This means that iE1 and iB1 also
decrease. As vI increases, the voltage across R2 increases, and iE2 and iB2 increase. A
net input current iI is then produced, to account for the reduction in iB1 and the
increase in iB2.
The net input current is
iI = iB2 −iB1
(8.51)
Neglecting the voltage drops across R3 and R4 and the base currents in Q3 and Q4, we
have
iB2 = (vI −VBE) −V −

(8.52(a))
and
iB1 = V + −(vI + VE B)

where βn and βp are the current gains of the npn and pnp transistors, respectively. If
V + = −V −, VBE = VE B, R1 = R2 ≡R, and βn = βp ≡β, then combining Equa-
tions (8.52(a)), (8.52(b)), and (8.51) produces

Since the voltage gain of this output stage is approximately unity, the output current is
iO = vO
RL
∼= vI
RL
(8.54)
Using Equations (8.53) and (8.54), we ﬁnd the current gain of this output stage to be
Ai = iO
iI
= (1 + β)R
2RL
(8.55)
With β in the numerator, this current gain should be substantial. A large current gain
is desirable, since the output stage of power ampliﬁers must provide the current
necessary to meet the power requirements.
EXAMPLE 8.11
Objective: Determine the currents and the current gain for the output stage with
input buffer transistors.
For the circuit in Figure 8.34, the parameters are: R1 = R2 = 2 k, RL = 100
, R3 = R4 = 0, and V + = −V −= 15 V. Assume all transistors are matched, with
β = 60 and VBE(npn) = VE B(pnp) = 0.6 V.
Solution: For vI = 0,
iR1 = iR2 ∼= iE1 = iE2 = 15 −0.6
2
= 7.2 mA
Assuming all transistors are matched, the bias currents in Q3 and Q4 are also approx-
imately 7.2 mA, since the base–emitter voltages of Q1 and Q3 are equal and those of
Q2 and Q4 are equal.
Solution: For vI = 10 V, the output current is approximately
iO = vO
RL
∼= 10
0.1 = 100 mA
The emitter current in Q3 is essentially equal to the load current, which means that
the base current in Q3 is approximately
iB3 = 100/61 = 1.64 mA
The current in R1 is
iR1 = 15 −(10 + 0.6)
2
= 2.2 mA
which means that
iE1 = iR1 −iB3 = 0.56 mA
and
iB1 = iE1/(1 + β) = 0.56/61 ⇒9.18 μA
Since Q4 tends to turn off when vO increases, we have
iE2 ∼= iR2 = 10 −0.6 −(−15)
2
= 12.2 mA

Chapter 8 Output Stages and Power Ampliﬁers
599
and
iB2 = iE2/(1 + β) = 12.2/61 ⇒200 μA
The input current is then
iI = iB2 −iB1 = 200 −9.18 ∼= 191 μA
The current gain is then
Ai = iO
iI
= 100
0.191 = 524
From Equation (8.55), the predicted current gain is
Ai = iO
iI
= (1 + β)R
2RL
= (61)(2)
2(0.1) = 610
Comment: Since the current gain determined from Equation (8.55) neglects
base currents in Q3 and Q4, the actual current gain is less than the predicted value, as
expected. The input current of 191 μA can easily be supplied by a low-power
ampliﬁer.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 8.11: Consider the class-AB output stage in Figure 8.34. The parameters are:
V + = −V −= 12 V, R1 = R2 = 250 , RL = 8 , and R3 = R4 = 0. Assume
all transistors are matched, with β = 40 and VBE(npn) = VE B(pnp) = 0.7 V.
(a) For vI = 0, determine iE1, iE2, iB1, and iB2. (b) For vI = 5 V, ﬁnd iO, iE1, iE2, iB1,
iB2, and iI. (c) Using the results of part (b), determine the current gain of the output
stage. Compare this value to that found using Equation (8.55). (Ans. (a) iE1 =
iE2 = 44.1 mA, iB1 = iB2 = 1.08 mA (b) iO = 0.625 A, iE1 = 10.0 mA,
iB1 = 0.244 mA, iE2 = 65.2 mA, iB2 = 1.59 mA, iI = 1.35 mA (c) Ai = 463,
from Equation (8.55) Ai = 641)
Class-AB Output Stage Utilizing 
the Darlington Conﬁguration
The complementary push–pull output stage uses npn and pnp bipolar transistors.
Usually in IC design, the pnp transistors are fabricated as lateral devices with low β
values that are typically in the range of 5 to 10, and the npn transistors are fabricated
as vertical devices with β values on the order of 200. This means that the npn and pnp
transistors are not well matched, as we have assumed in our analyses.
Consider the two-transistor conﬁguration shown in Figure 8.35(a). Assume the
transistor current gains are βn and βp for the npn and pnp transistors, respectively. We
can write
iCp = iBn = βpiBp
(8.56)
and
i2 = (1 + βn)iBn = (1 + βn)βpiBp ∼= βnβpiBp
(8.57)
8.5.4

Part 1
Semiconductor Devices and Basic Applications
Terminal 1 acts as the base of the composite three-terminal device, terminal 2 acts as
the collector, and terminal 3 is the emitter. The current gain of the device is then
approximately βnβp. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 8.35(b). We can use
the two-transistor conﬁguration in Figure 8.35(a) as a single equivalent pnp transistor
with a current gain on the same order of magnitude as that of an npn device.
In Figure 8.36, the output stage uses Darlington pairs to provide the necessary
current gain. Transistors Q1 and Q2 constitute the npn Darlington emitter-follower
that sources current to the load. Transistors Q3, Q4, and Q5 constitute a composite pnp
Darlington emitter follower that sinks current from the load. The three diodes D1, D2,
and D3 establish the quiescent bias for the output transistors.
The effective current gain of the three-transistor conﬁguration Q3–Q4–Q5 is
essentially the product of the three individual gains. With the low current gain of the
pnp device Q3, the overall current gain of the Q3–Q4–Q5 conﬁguration is similar to
that of the Q1–Q2 pair.

Design Pointer: The output devices are to be MOSFETs because of their superior
power characteristics. The low output resistance of the emitter follower transistors
Q1 and Q2 tends to increase switching speed of the output transistors. The voltage
drop across resistor R2 provides the bias to Mn and Mp so that crossover distortion is
minimized.
Choices: MOSFETs with parameters VT N = 0.8 V, VT P = −0.8 V, Kn = Kp =
5 mA/V2, and λ = 0 are available. BJTs with parameters IS1 = IS2 = 10−12 A,
IS3 = IS4 = 2 × 10−13 A, and β = 150 are available. Also diodes with parameters
ISD = 5 × 10−13 A are available.
Solution: For IN P = 0.5 mA, the gate-to-source voltages are found from
IN P = Kn(VGSn −VT N)2
or
0.5 = 5(VGSn −0.8)2
Since the two output transistors are matched, we have
VGSn = VSGp = 1.116 V
If we design for I2 = 2 mA, then the value of resistor R2 is
R2 = 2(1.116)

The voltage across the VBE multiplier circuit is found to be
VM = VBB −2VD = 3.3456 −2(0.5987) = 2.1482 V
We will design the VBE multiplier circuit such that IC3 = (0.9)IBias and IR =
(0.1)IBias. Then
VBE3 = VT ln

 5 × 10−3

Then, for vO = 0, the input voltage vI must be
vI = −VSGP −VE B2 −VE B4 = −1.116 −0.5568 −0.6225
or
vI = −2.295 V
Comment: The required input voltage vI to yield vO = 0 would be designed from
the previous stage of the ampliﬁer. In addition, the circuit required to establish the
IBias current will be considered in Chapter 10. We may notice that, except for IBias,
all the design parameters are independent of the bias voltages V + and V −.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, we analyzed and designed ampliﬁers and output stages capable
of delivering a substantial amount of power to a load.
•
The current, voltage, and power ratings of BJTs and MOSFETs were consid-
ered, and the safe operating area for the transistors was deﬁned in terms of these
limiting parameters. The maximum power rating of a transistor is related to the
maximum allowed device temperature at which the device can operate without
being damaged.
•
Several classes of power ampliﬁers were deﬁned.
•
In a class-A ampliﬁer, the output transistor conducts 100 percent of the time.
The theoretical maximum power efﬁciency for a standard class-A ampliﬁer is 25
percent. This efﬁciency can be theoretically increased to 50 percent by incorpo-
rating inductors and transformers in the circuit.
•
Class-B output stages are composed of complementary pairs of transistors oper-
ating in a push-pull manner. In an ideal class-B operation, each output transistor
conducts 50 percent of the time. For an idealized class-B output stage, the theo-
retical maximum power conversion efﬁciency is 78.5 percent. However, practi-
cal class-B output stages tend to suffer from crossover distortion effects when
the output is in the vicinity of zero volts.
•
The class-AB output stage is similar to the class-B circuit, except that each out-
put transistor is provided with a small quiescent bias and conducts slightly more
than 50 percent of the time. The power conversion efﬁciency of this circuit is less
than that of a class-B circuit, but is substantially larger than that of the class-A
circuit. In addition, the crossover distortion is greatly reduced.
•
As an application, a class-AB output stage using MOSFETs was designed.

PROLOGUE TO
ELECTRONIC DESIGN
PREVIEW
In Part 1, we dealt, for the most part, with discrete electronic circuits; that is, circuits
containing discrete resistors, capacitors, and transistors. The analysis of these funda-
mental circuits provided a basic understanding of circuit operation and characteristics.
Some design discussions were also included to introduce the concept of electronic
circuit design. As part of the design discussion, various tradeoffs were considered.
In Part 2, we will develop, analyze, and design more complex analog electronic
circuits. We will combine and expand the basic circuits considered in Part 1, to form
these more complex circuits. Although, for the most part, we will continue to analyze
and design discrete circuits, these circuits are usually fabricated as integrated cir-
cuits. In this short prologue, we discuss some fundamental aspects of the electronic
design process.
DESIGN APPROACH
The design process can be viewed from two directions, as indicated in Figure PR2.1.
The top-down design process begins with a proposed overall system concept. The whole
system is divided into subsystems, of which one may include the electronics associated
with the project. The electronics is then divided into its own set of subsystems.

Prologue II Prologue to Electronic Design
The top-down approach usually relies on existing technologies and devices,
which means that the electronic subsystems are usually designed with existing ICs.
New or customized ICs may be designed and fabricated for a specialized application,
although this may increase the cost of the system.
The design engineer must be able to evaluate existing design strategies and tech-
nologies to determine if they are able to meet the design or performance objectives.
Insight into the operation and characteristics of basic circuits is essential for circuit
design, and for being able to make appropriate choices in a top-down design process.
The bottom-up design process usually begins in a research laboratory with the
development of new and unique semiconductor materials. Silicon-based devices and
circuits still dominate electronics technology, but compound semiconductors are
gaining importance in specialized applications. These compound semiconductor
materials are being used in the development and design of new discrete devices, such
as high-performance JFETs and improved optoelectronic devices. These new devices
may be incorporated into integrated circuits, which may eventually lead to the devel-
opment of new systems based on the characteristics and properties of the new devices.
SYSTEM DESIGN
Consider a top-down approach in which the design of an electronic circuit or system
begins with a proposed design for a large system, such as a new airplane. Designing
and building such a system may involve hundreds or even thousands of engineers
from the initial concept to the ﬁnal working system. The concept begins with a set of
speciﬁcations or performance objectives. The large total airplane system can be
broken into subsystems, such as those shown in Figure PR2.2.
The speciﬁcations for the electronics subsystem are usually dictated by the
overall system speciﬁcations, which may include such things as size, weight, and
power consumption. Design is an iterative process, and trade-offs are an integral part
of the process, all the way from the overall system to each individual circuit. As work
progresses, the overall system or subsystem speciﬁcations may be reﬁned or
modiﬁed. During the design, issues may arise that were not anticipated and design
trade-offs may be required. For example, there may be trade-offs between airplane
performance and cost. High performance may require very expensive electronics and

higher than expected costs in the development of high-performance engines. Once the
system or subsystem requirements are ﬁnalized, design engineers then evaluate vari-
ous approaches for meeting the design speciﬁcations. There is seldom a unique solu-
tion for a design, and engineering creativity is an integral part of this phase.
Once suitable approaches are selected for an overall subsystem, such as the elec-
tronics subsystem, it may then be broken down into smaller subsystems. For example,
the initial electronics breakdown may include radar systems, voice communications,
and aircraft performance monitoring systems, such as shown in Figure PR2.2. The
speciﬁcations for each subsystem are developed from the overall set of speciﬁcations.
ELECTRONIC DESIGN
A ﬂowchart of the general electronic design process is shown in Figure PR2.3. This
chart can apply to an entire system or to an individual circuit. A set of speciﬁcations
is developed for each electronic system, and then each system is divided into many
simpler circuits. For example, one relatively simple electronic system may be a high
temperature warning indicator. If the temperature of an engine or a particular engine
part becomes greater than some predetermined value, a warning light would go on in
the cockpit.
Initial design approaches are considered and a circuit conﬁguration is proposed,
based on the experience and creativity of the circuit design engineer. This is where
experience in the analysis of many different types of electronic circuits becomes
important. Knowledge of particular characteristics, such as input impedance, output
impedance, gain characteristics, and bandwidth, for many types of circuits, is used to
choose a particular circuit conﬁguration.
Figure PR2.4 shows a block diagram for a particular circuit conﬁguration that
can serve as a starting point for the design of the temperature indicator. The block
showing the ampliﬁer may be further divided to show a proposed conﬁguration for
the circuit. Component values can then be chosen.

The choice of a temperature transducer is based in part on the required temperature
range. The design of the ampliﬁer begins with the anticipated output signal of the
temperature transducer, which in turn implies a required level of input impedance and
signal gain for the ampliﬁer. The necessary stability of the ampliﬁer gain may deter-
mine whether a simple ampliﬁer design may be used, or a more complex ampliﬁer
using feedback may be necessary. In addition, the location of the ampliﬁer on the
aircraft may determine the temperature range over which the ampliﬁer must function.
The comparator compares the ampliﬁer output, which corresponds to a particular
temperature, to a preset value. If the ampliﬁer output is greater than the preset value, the
output of the comparator must then be able to activate the warning light. The voltage
and current levels required to activate the warning light are determined and are incor-
porated into the design of the comparator.
In proposing the initial circuit conﬁguration and component values, the design
engineer may use an intuitive approach based to a large extent on experience. How-
ever, once this initial design is completed, the design must be veriﬁed with a mathe-
matical analysis or computer simulation. The initial design process may include
calculations using simple models for the transistors and circuits. Normally, a more
sophisticated analysis is required to take into account such things as temperature
variations, tolerances in component values, and other parameter variations based on
a particular application.
The circuit performance estimation or simulation is usually a very important
phase of the design process. To validate the ﬁnal design, it is necessary to simulate,
as precisely as possible, the performance of the discrete devices and ICs used in the
design. Simulation models are required for each circuit component in order to predict
the operation and characteristics of the designed circuits. On the basis of these simu-
lation models, trade-offs between technologies and devices may be evaluated to ob-
tain the optimum performance. With improved simulation models, the breadboard
development stage may be eliminated and the design process may proceed directly to
the construction of a prototype circuit. Since the prototype circuit may involve the
fabrication of specialized or customized integrated circuits, this phase of the design
process may be expensive; therefore, costly mistakes in the design must be avoided.
A good circuit simulation may identify potential problems that can be corrected
before the prototype circuit is fabricated.
The prototype circuit is then tested and evaluated. At this point, a minor redesign
may involve only selecting slightly different component values. A more extensive
redesign may require selecting an entirely different circuit conﬁguration in order to
meet the system requirements. Finally, the entire system is constructed from the
operating subsystems.
CONCLUSION
Design involves creativity, and it can be challenging and rewarding. Design is based
on experience. The design process in Part 2 of the text is based on the experience
gained in Part 1. Our design experience should continue to grow as we proceed
through the remainder of this book.

PART
Analog Electronics
Part 1 dealt with basic electronic devices and fundamental circuit conﬁgurations.
Part 2 now deals with more complex analog circuits, including more sophisticated
ampliﬁers.
Chapter 9 introduces the ideal op-amp and related circuits. The op-amp is one of
the most common analog integrated circuits and can be used in a plethora of elec-
tronic applications. IC biasing techniques, which primarily use constant-current
sources, are described in Chapter 10. One of the most widely used ampliﬁer conﬁg-
urations is the differential ampliﬁer, which is analyzed in Chapter 11. Chapter 12
covers the fundamentals of feedback. Feedback is used extensively in analog circuits
to set or control gain values more precisely, and to alter, in a favorable way, input and
output impedance values.
More complex analog integrated circuits, including circuits that form operational
ampliﬁers, are discussed in Chapter 13. These circuits are composed of the fundamen-
tal conﬁgurations, such as the differential ampliﬁer, constant-current biasing, active
load, and output stage, that have been previously analyzed. Then Chapter 14 considers
nonideal effects in operational ampliﬁer circuits, and discusses the effects of these
nonideal characteristics on op-amp circuit performance. Additional integrated circuit
applications and designs are considered in Chapter 15. Such applications include
active ﬁlters, oscillators, and integrated circuit power ampliﬁers.

Chapter
Ideal Operational
Ampliﬁers and
Op-Amp Circuits1
1This chapter, through Section 9.5.5, can easily be studied as a ﬁrst chapter in electronics for those who
wish to cover op-amp circuits ﬁrst.
99
An operational ampliﬁer (op-amp) is an integrated circuit that ampliﬁes the difference
between two input voltages and produces a single output. The op-amp is prevalent in
analog electronics, and can be thought of as another electronic device, in much the
same way as the bipolar or ﬁeld-effect transistor.
The term operational ampliﬁer comes from the original applications of the de-
vice in the early 1960s. Op-amps, in conjunction with resistors and capacitors, were
used in analog computers to perform mathematical operations to solve differential
and integral equations. The applications of op-amps have expanded signiﬁcantly
since those early days.
The main reason for postponing the discussion of op-amp circuits until now is
that we can use a relatively simple transistor circuit to develop the ideal character-
istics of the op-amps, instead of simply stating the ideal parameters as postulates.
Once the ideal properties have been developed, the reader can then be more com-
fortable applying these ideal characteristics in the design of op-amp circuits. Just as
we developed equivalent circuits of transistors that include dependent sources repre-
senting gain factors, we will develop a basic op-amp equivalent circuit with a depen-
dent source that represents the device gain that can be used to determine some of the
nonideal properties of op-amp circuits.
For the most part, this chapter deals with ideal op-amps. Nonideal op-amp
effects are considered in Chapter 14.

THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Discuss and develop the parameters and characteristics
of the ideal operational ampliﬁer, and determine the analysis method
of ideal op-amp circuits.
The integrated circuit operational ampliﬁer evolved soon after development of the
ﬁrst bipolar integrated circuit. The μA-709 was introduced by Fairchild Semicon-
ductor in 1965 and was one of the ﬁrst widely used general-purpose op-amps. The
now classic μA-741, also by Fairchild, was introduced in the late 1960s. Since then,
a vast array of op-amps with improved characteristics, using both bipolar and MOS
technologies, have been designed. Most op-amps are very inexpensive (less than a
dollar) and are available from a wide range of suppliers.
From a signal point of view, the op-amp has two input terminals and one output
terminal, as shown in the small-signal circuit symbol in Figure 9.1(a). The op-amp
also requires dc power, as do all transistor circuits, so that the transistors are biased
in the active region. Also, most op-amps are biased with both a positive and a nega-
tive voltage supply, as indicated in Figure 9.1(b). As before, the positive voltage is
indicated by V + and the negative voltage by V −.

negative supply voltages
There are normally 20 to 30 transistors that make up an op-amp circuit. The
typical IC op-amp has parameters that approach the ideal characteristics. For this
reason, then, we can treat the op-amp as a “simple” electronic device, which means
that it is quite easy to design a wide range of circuits using the IC op-amp.
In this chapter, we develop the ideal set of op-amp parameters and then consider
the analysis and design of a wide variety of op-amp circuits, which will aid in our
understanding of the design process of electronic circuits. We generally assume, in
this chapter, that the op-amp is ideal. In the following chapters, we consider the
differential ampliﬁer, current-source biasing, and feedback, which leads to the
development of the actual operational ampliﬁer circuit in Chapter 13. Once the actual
op-amp circuit is studied, then the source of nonideal characteristics can be under-
stood. The effect of nonideal op-amp parameters is then considered in Chapter 14.
Additional op-amp applications are given in Chapter 15.
Ideal Parameters
The ideal op-amp senses the difference between two input signals and ampliﬁes this
difference to produce an output signal. The terminal voltage is the voltage at a terminal

Figure 9.2 Ideal op-amp equivalent circuit
measured with respect to ground. The ideal op-amp equivalent circuit is shown in
Figure 9.2.
Ideally, the input resistance Ri between terminals 1 and 2 is inﬁnite, which
means that the input current at each terminal is zero. The output terminal of the ideal
op-amp acts as the output of an ideal voltage source, meaning that the small-signal
output resistance Ro is zero.
The parameter Aod shown in the equivalent circuit is the open-loop differential
voltage gain of the op-amp. The output is out of phase with respect to v1 and in
phase with respect to v2. Terminal (1) then is the inverting input terminal, desig-
nated by the “−” notation, and terminal (2) is the noninverting input terminal,
designated by the “+” notation. In the ideal op-amp, the open-loop gain Aod is very
large and approaches inﬁnity.
Since the ideal op-amp responds only to the difference between the two input
signals v1 and v2, the ideal op-amp maintains a zero output signal for v1 = v2. When
v1 = v2 ̸= 0, there is what is called a common-mode input signal. For the ideal op-
amp, the common-mode output signal is zero. This characteristic is referred to as
common-mode rejection.
Because the device is biased with both positive and negative power supplies,
most op-amps are direct-coupled devices (i.e., no coupling capacitors are used on the
input). Therefore, the input voltages v1 and v2 shown in Figure 9.2 can be dc volt-
ages, which will produce a dc output voltage vO.
Another characteristic of the op-amp that must be considered in any design is the
bandwidth or frequency response. In the ideal op-amp, this parameter is neglected.
The frequency response of practical op-amps and other nonideal characteristics are
discussed in Chapters 13 and 14. These nonideal parameters are considered after the
actual operational ampliﬁer circuits are analyzed in Chapter 13.
The ideal op-amp is being considered in this chapter in order to gain an appreci-
ation of the properties and characteristics of op-amp circuits.
Development of the Ideal Parameters
To develop the ideal op-amp parameters, we start with the basic equivalent circuit
shown in Figure 9.2.2 We may note that this equivalent circuit is very similar to the
MOSFET small-signal equivalent circuit. Figure 9.3(a) shows an n-channel
enhancement-mode MOSFET, and Figure 9.3(b) shows the simpliﬁed low-frequency
small-signal equivalent circuit. In our analysis, the transistor small-signal output re-
sistance ro is assumed to be inﬁnite.

the equivalent circuit and ignore any reference to the MOSFET.

RF is a feedback resistor that connects the output back to the input of the ampliﬁer.
This circuit is therefore called a feedback circuit. In this example, we use a single de-
vice (transistor) as the basic ampliﬁer of the op-amp circuit.
Writing a KCL equation at the gate, or inverting, terminal, we obtain

Equation (9.4) shows that the overall voltage gain is the ratio of two external circuit
resistors, which is one result of using an ideal op-amp. The negative sign indicates a
180 degree phase shift between the input and the output, which means that the input to
the transistor corresponds to the inverting terminal of an op-amp. The voltage gain
given by Equations (9.3) and (9.4) is called a closed-loop voltage gain, since feedback
is incorporated into the circuit. Conversely, the voltage gain Aod is an open-loop gain.
Voltage Vgs at the input of the basic ampliﬁer (transistor) is given by Equa-
tion (9.2(b)). Again, if we let the gain gm go to inﬁnity, then Vgs ∼= 0; that is, the volt-
age at the input terminal to the basic ampliﬁer is almost at ground potential. This
terminal is said to be at virtual ground, which is another characteristic that we will
observe in ideal op-amp circuits. The concept of virtual ground will be discussed in
more detail in later sections.
The output resistance of this circuit can be determined from the equivalent cir-
cuit shown in Figure 9.5. The input signal source is set at zero. A KCL equation at the
output node, written in phasor notation, is
Ix = gmVgs +

If the gain gm goes to inﬁnity, then Ro →0. The output resistance of the circuit with
negative feedback included goes to zero. This is also a property of an ideal op-amp
circuit.
A simpliﬁed MOSFET model with a large gain has thus provided the properties
of an ideal op-amp.
Analysis Method
Usually, an op-amp is not used in the open-loop conﬁguration shown in Figure 9.2(a).
Instead, feedback is added to close the loop between the output and the input. In this

chapter, we will limit our discussion to negative feedback, in which the connection
from the output goes to the inverting terminal, or terminal (1). As we will see later,
this conﬁguration produces stable circuits; positive feedback, in which the output is
connected to the noninverting terminal, can be used to produce oscillators.
The ideal op-amp characteristics resulting from our negative feedback analysis
are shown in Figure 9.6 and summarized below.
1. The internal differential gain Aod is considered to be inﬁnite.
2. The differential input voltage (v2 −v1) is assumed to be zero. If Aod is very large
and if the output voltage vO is ﬁnite, then the two input voltages must be nearly
equal.
3. The effective input resistance to the op-amp is assumed to be inﬁnite, so the two
input currents, i1 and i2, are essentially zero.
4. The output resistance Ro is assumed to be zero in the ideal case, so the output
voltage is connected directly to the dependent voltage source, and the output volt-
age is independent of any load connected to the output.
We use these ideal characteristics in the analysis and design of op-amp circuits.
Practical Speciﬁcations
In the previous discussion, we have considered the properties of an ideal op-amp.
Practical op-amps are not ideal, although their characteristics approach those of an
ideal op-amp. Figure 9.7(a) is a more accurate equivalent circuit of an op-amp. Also
included is a load resistance connected to the output terminal. This load resistance
may actually represent another op-amp circuit connected to the output terminal.

Output Voltage Swing
Since the op-amp is composed of transistors biased in the active region by the dc
input voltages V + and V −, the output voltage is limited. When vO approaches V +,
it will saturate, or be limited to a value nearly equal to V +, since it cannot go above
the positive bias voltage. Similarly, when the output voltage approaches V −, it will
saturate at a value nearly equal to V −. The output voltage is limited to
V −+ V < vO < V + −V , as shown in Figure 9.7(b). Figure 9.7(b) is a simpli-
ﬁed voltage transfer characteristic for the op-amp, showing the saturation effect. In
older op-amp designs, such as the 741, the value of V is between 1 and 2 V. We will
see this property in Chapter 13. However, in newer CMOS op-amp designs, the value
of V may be as low as 10 mV.
Output Currents
As we can see from Figure 9.7(a), if the output voltage vO becomes either positive or
negative, a current is induced in the load resistance. If the output voltage is positive,
the load current is supplied by the output of the op-amp. If the output voltage is neg-
ative, then the output of the op-amp sinks the load current. A limitation of practical
op-amps is the maximum current that an op-amp can supply or sink. A typical value
of the maximum current is on the order of ±20 mA for a general-purpose op-amp.
PSpice Modeling
Three general purpose op-amps are included in the PSpice library. The PSpice circuit
simulation uses a macromodel, which is a simpliﬁed version of the op-amp, to model
the op-amp characteristics. For example, the μA-741 op-amp has parameters Ri =
2 M, Ro = 75 , Aod = 2 × 105, and a unity-gain bandwidth of f BW = 1 MHz.
This device is also capable of producing output voltages of ±14 V with dc power
supply voltages of ±15 V. We will see in several examples as to whether these
nonideal parameters affect actual circuit properties.

INVERTING AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of the 
inverting operational ampliﬁer.
One of the most widely used op-amp circuits is the inverting ampliﬁer. Figure 9.8
shows the closed-loop conﬁguration of this circuit. We must keep in mind that the
op-amp is biased with dc voltages, although those connections are seldom explicitly
shown.

Basic Ampliﬁer
We analyze the circuit in Figure 9.8 by considering the ideal equivalent circuit shown
in Figure 9.9. The closed-loop voltage gain, or simply the voltage gain, is deﬁned as 
Av = vO
vI
(9.8)
We stated that if the open-loop gain Aod is very large, then the two inputs v1 and v2
must be nearly equal. Since v2 is at ground potential, voltage v1 must also be
approximately zero volts. We must point out, however, that having v1 be essentially
at ground potential does not imply that terminal (1) is grounded. Rather, terminal (1)
is said to be at virtual ground; that is, it is essentially zero volts, but it does not
provide a current path to ground. The virtual ground concept will be used in the
analysis of ideal op-amp circuits. To repeat this important concept, with terminal 1
being at virtual ground means that terminal 1 is essentially at zero volts, but is not
connected to ground potential.
From Figure 9.9, we can write
i1 = vI −v1
R1
= vI
R1
(9.9)
Since the current into the op-amp is assumed to be zero, current il must ﬂow through
resistor R2 to the output terminal, which means that i1 = i2.
The output voltage is given by 
vO = v1 −i2R2 = 0 −
 vI
R1

R2
(9.10)
Therefore, the closed-loop voltage gain is 
Av = vO
vI
= −R2
R1
(9.11)
For the ideal op-amp, the closed-loop voltage gain is a function of the ratio of two
resistors; it is not a function of the transistor parameters within the op-amp circuit.
Again, the minus sign implies a phase reversal. If the input voltage vI is positive, then,
because v1 is essentially at ground potential, the output voltage vO must be negative,
or below ground potential. Also note that if the output terminal is open-circuited, cur-
rent i2 must ﬂow back into the op-amp. However, since the output impedance for the
ideal case is zero, the output voltage is not a function of this current that ﬂows back
into the op-amp and is not dependent on the load.

We can also determine the input resistance seen by the voltage source vI .
Because of the virtual ground, we have, from Equation (9.9)
i1 = vI/R1
The input resistance is then deﬁned as
Ri = vI
i1
= R1
(9.12)
This shows that the input resistance seen by the source is a function of R1 only, and
is a result of the “virtual ground” concept. Figure 9.10 summarizes our analysis of
the inverting ampliﬁer circuit.
Since there are no coupling capacitors in the op-amp circuit, the input and output
voltages, as well as the currents in the resistors, can be dc signals. The inverting
op-amp can then amplify dc voltages.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.1
Objective: Design an inverting ampliﬁer with a speciﬁed voltage gain.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 9.10.
Design the circuit such that the voltage gain is Av = −5. Assume the op-amp is
driven by an ideal sinusoidal source, vs = 0.1 sin ωt (V), that can supply a maximum
current of 5 μA. Assume that frequency ω is low so that any frequency effects can be
neglected.
Design Pointer: If the sinusoidal input signal source has a nonzero output resis-
tance, the op-amp must be redesigned to provide the speciﬁed voltage gain.
Initial Solution: The input current is given by
i1 = vI
R1
= vs
R1
If i1(max) = 5 μA, then we can write
R1 = vs(max)
i1(max) =

The closed-loop gain is given by
Av = −R2
R1
= −5

Part 2

We then have
R2 = 5R1 = 5(20) = 100 k
Trade-offs: If the signal source has a ﬁnite output resistance and the desired output
voltage is vo = −0.5 sin ωt, the circuit must be redesigned. Assume the output resis-
tance of the source is RS = 1 k.
Redesign Solution: The output resistance of the signal source is now part of the
input resistance to the op-amp. We now write
R1 + RS = vs(max)
i1(max) =
0.1
5 × 10−6 ⇒20 k
Since RS = 1 k, we then have R1 = 19 k. The feedback resistor is then R2 =
5(R1 + RS) = 5(19 + 1) = 100 k.
Comment: The output resistance of the signal source must be included in the design
of the op-amp to provide a speciﬁed voltage gain.

source resistance of 1 k and an input resistance of 19 k. Figure 9.11(b) shows the

a gain of 5 (magnitude) has been achieved and also shows that the output signal is
180 degrees out of phase with respect to the input signal. Finally, the input current is
shown in Figure 9.11(d) with a maximum value of 5 μA. The actual circuit charac-
teristics are not inﬂuenced to any great extent by the nonideal parameters of the
μA-741 op-amp used in the circuit simulation.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 9.1: Design an ideal inverting op-amp circuit such that the voltage gain is
Av = −25. The maximum current in any resistor is to be limited to 10 μA with
the input voltage in the range −25 ≤vI ≤+25 mV. (a) What are the values of R1
and R2? (b) What is the range of output voltage vO? (Ans. (a) R1 = 2.5 k,
R2 = 62.5 k; (b) −0.625 ≤vO ≤0.625 V)
Problem-Solving Technique: Ideal Op-Amp Circuits
1.
If the noninverting terminal of the op-amp is at ground potential, then the
inverting terminal is at virtual ground. Sum currents at this node, assuming
zero current enters the op-amp itself. 
2.
If the noninverting terminal of the op-amp is not at ground potential, then the
inverting terminal voltage is equal to that at the noninverting terminal. Sum
currents at the inverting terminal node, assuming zero current enters the
op-amp itself.
3.
For the ideal op-amp circuit, the output voltage is determined from either step 1
or step 2 above and is independent of any load connected to the output terminal.
Ampliﬁer with a T-Network
Assume that an inverting ampliﬁer is to be designed having a closed-loop voltage
gain of Av = −100 and an input resistance of Ri = R1 = 50 k. The feedback
resistor R2 would then have to be 5 M. However this resistance value is too large
for most practical circuits.
Consider the op-amp circuit shown in Figure 9.12 with a T-network in the feed-
back loop. The analysis of this circuit is similar to that of the inverting op-amp circuit
of Figure 9.10. At the input, we have

The advantage of using a T-network is demonstrated in the following example.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.2
Objective: An op-amp with a T-network is to be designed as a microphone
preampliﬁer.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit conﬁguration to be designed is shown in Figure 9.12.
The maximum microphone output voltage is 12 mV (rms) and the microphone has an
output resistance of 1 k. The op-amp circuit is to be designed such that the maxi-
mum output voltage is 1.2 V (rms). The input ampliﬁer resistance should be fairly
large, but all resistance values should be less that 500 k.
Choices: The ﬁnal design should use standard resistor values. In addition, standard
resistors with tolerances of ±2 percent are to be considered.
Solution: We need a voltage gain of 
|Av| =

The effective R1 must include the RS resistance of the microphone. If we set
R1 = 49 k so that R1,eff = 50 k, then
R2 = R3 = 400 k
and
R4 = 38.1 k
Design Pointer: If we need to use standard resistance values in our design, then,
using Appendix C, we can choose R1 = 51 k so that R1,eff = 52 k, and we can
choose R2 = R3 = 390 k. Then, using Equation (9.18), we have

which yields R4 = 34.4 k. We may use a standard resistor of R4 = 33 k. This
resistance value then produces a voltage gain of Av = −103.6.
Trade-offs: If we consider ±2 percent tolerances in the standard resistor values, the
voltage gain can be written as
Av =
−R2(1 ± 0.02)

Analyzing this equation, we ﬁnd the maximum magnitude as |Av|max = 111.6 or
+7.72 percent, and the minimum magnitude as |Av|min = 96.3 or −7.05 percent.
Comment: As required, all resistor values are less than 500 k. Also the resistance
ratios in the voltage gain expression are approximately equal. As with most design
problems, there is no unique solution. We must keep in mind that, because of resistor
value tolerances, the actual gain of the ampliﬁer will have a range of values.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 9.2: Design an ideal inverting op-amp circuit with a T-network that has a
closed-loop voltage gain of Av = −75 and an input resistance of R = 20 k. The
maximum resistor value is to be limited to 200 k. (Ans. Let R1 = 20 k and
R2 = R3 = 160 k. Then R4 = 21.7 k.)
The ampliﬁer with a T-network allows us to obtain a large gain using reasonably
sized resistors.
Effect of Finite Gain
A ﬁnite open-loop gain Aod, also called the ﬁnite differential-mode gain, affects the
closed-loop gain of an inverting ampliﬁer. We will consider nonideal effects in
9.2.3

op-amps in a later chapter; here, we will determine the magnitude of Aod required to
approach the ideal case.
Consider the inverting op-amps shown in Figure 9.13. As before, we assume an
inﬁnite input resistance at terminals (1) and (2), which means the input currents to the
op-amp are zero.
The current through R1 can be written as
i1 = vI −v1
R1
(9.19)
and the current through R2 is
i2 = v1 −vO
R2
(9.20)
The output voltage is now given by
vO = −Aodv1
so that the terminal (1) voltage can be written as
v1 = −vO
Aod
(9.21)
Combining Equations (9.21), (9.19), and (9.20), and setting i1 = i2, we obtain

Comment: For this case, the open-loop gain must be on the order of at least 103 in
order to be within 1 percent of the ideal gain. If the ideal closed-loop gain changes, a
new value of open-loop gain must be determined in order to meet the speciﬁed re-
quirements. As we will see in Chapter 14, at low frequencies, most op-amp circuits
have gains on the order of 105, so achieving the required accuracy is not difﬁcult.

SUMMING AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of the
summing operational ampliﬁer.
To analyze the op-amp circuit shown in Figure 9.14(a), we will use the superposition
theorem and the concept of virtual ground. Using the superposition theorem, we will
determine the output voltage due to each input acting alone. We will then alge-
braically sum these terms to determine the total output.

Since vI2 = vI3 = 0 and the inverting terminal is at virtual ground, the currents i2

tire current must ﬂow through the feedback resistor RF, as indicated in Figure 9.14(b).

The output voltage is the sum of the three input voltages, with different weighting fac-
tors. This circuit is therefore called the inverting summing ampliﬁer. The number of
input terminals and input resistors can be changed to add more or fewer voltages.
A special case occurs when the three input resistances are equal. When
R1 = R2 = R3 ≡R, then 
vO = −RF
R1
(vI1 + vI2 + vI3)
(9.30)
This means that the output voltage is the sum of the input voltages, with a single
ampliﬁcation factor.
Discussion: Up to this point, we have seen that op-amps can be used to multiply a
signal by a constant and sum a number of signals with prescribed weights. These are
mathematical operations. Later in the chapter, we will see that op-amps can also be
used to integrate and differentiate. These circuits are the building blocks needed to
perform analog computations—hence the original name of operational ampliﬁer. Op-
amps, however, are versatile and can do much more than just perform mathematical
operations, as we will continue to observe through the remainder of the chapter.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.4
Objective: Design a summing ampliﬁer to produce a speciﬁed output signal.
Speciﬁcations: The output signal generated from an ideal ampliﬁer circuit is
vO1 = 1.2 −0.5 sin ωt (V). Design a summing ampliﬁer to be connected to the am-
pliﬁer circuit such that the output signal is vO = 2 sin ωt (V).
Choices: Standard precision resistors with tolerances of ±1 percent are to be used in
the ﬁnal design. Assume an ideal op-amp is available.
Solution: In this case, we need only two inputs to the summing ampliﬁer, as shown
in Figure 9.14. One input to the summing ampliﬁer is the output of the ideal ampli-
ﬁer circuit and the second input should be a dc voltage to cancel the +1.2 V signal
from the ampliﬁer circuit. If the voltage gains of each input to the summing ampliﬁer
are equal, then an input of −1.2 V at the second input will cancel the +1.2 V from the
ampliﬁer circuit.
For a −0.5 V sinusoidal input signal and a desired 2 V sinusoidal output signal,
the summing ampliﬁer gain must be
Av = −RF
R1
=
2
−0.5 = −4
If we choose the input resistances to be R1 = R2 = 30 k, then the feedback resis-
tance must be RF = 120 k.
Trade-offs: From Appendix C, we can choose precision resistor values of
RF = 124 k and R1 = R2 = 30.9 k. The ratio of the ideal resistors is 4.013. Con-
sidering the ±1 percent tolerance values, the output of the summing ampliﬁer is
vO = −RF(1 ± 0.01)
R1(1 ± 0.01)
· (1.2 −0.5 sin ωt) −RF(1 ± 0.01)
R2(1 ± 0.01) · (−1.2)
The dc output voltage is in the range −0.1926 ≤vO(dc) ≤0.1926 V and the peak ac
output voltage is in the range 1.967 ≤vO (ac) ≤2.047 V.
Comment: In this example, we have used a summing ampliﬁer to amplify a time-
varying signal and eliminate a dc voltage (ideally).

output voltage of vO = −3(vI1 + 2vI2 + 0.3vI3 + 4vI4). The maximum resis-
tance is to be limited to 400 k. (b) Using the results of part (a), determine 
vO for (i) vI1 = 0.1 V, vI2 = −0.2 V, vI3 = −1 V, vI4 = 0.05 V; and for

R2 = 60 k,
R4 = 30 k;
(b) (i) vO = +1.2 V, (ii) vO = −1.35 V)

nitude) of three input voltages, i.e., vO = (vI1 + vI2 + vI3)/3. The ampliﬁer is to be
designed such that each input signal sees the maximum possible input resistance
under the condition that the maximum allowed resistance in the circuit is 1 M. (Ans.
R1 = R2 = R3 = 1 M, RF = 333 k)
9.4
NONINVERTING AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of the non-
inverting operational ampliﬁer, including the voltage follower or
buffer.
In our previous discussions, the feedback element was connected between the output
and the inverting terminal. However, a signal can be applied to the noninverting
terminal while still maintaining negative feedback.
Basic Ampliﬁer
Figure 9.15 shows the basic noninverting ampliﬁer. The input signal vI is applied
directly to the noninverting terminal, while one side of resistor R1 is connected to the
inverting terminal and the other side is at ground.
Previously, when v2 was at ground potential, we argued that v1 was also essen-
tially at ground potential, and we stated that terminal (1) was at virtual ground. The
same principle applies to the circuit in Figure 9.15, with slightly different terminol-
ogy. The negative feedback connection forces the terminal voltages v1 and v2 to be
essentially equal. Such a condition is referred to as a virtual short. This condition
exists since a change in v2 will cause the output voltage vO to change in such a way
that v1 is forced to track v2. The virtual short means that the voltage difference
9.4.1

Chapter 9 Ideal Operational Ampliﬁers and Op-Amp Circuits 
639
between v1 and v2 is, for all practical purposes, zero. However, unlike a true short
circuit, there is no current ﬂow directly from one terminal to the other. We use the
virtual short concept, i.e. v1 = v2, as an ideal op-amp characteristic and use this
property in our circuit analysis.
The analysis of the noninverting ampliﬁer is essentially the same as for the
inverting ampliﬁer. We assume that no current enters the input terminals. Since
v1 = v2, then v1 = vI , and current i1 is given by
i1 = −v1
R1
= −vI
R1
(9.31)
Current i2 is given by
i2 = v1 −vO
R2
= vI −vO
R2
(9.32)
As before, i1 = i2, so that
−vI
R1
= vI −vO
R2
(9.33)
Solving for the closed-loop voltage gain, we ﬁnd
Av = vO
vI
= 1 + R2
R1
(9.34)
From this equation, we see that the output is in phase with the input, as expected.
Also note that the gain is always greater than unity.
The input signal vI is connected directly to the noninverting terminal; therefore,
since the input current is essentially zero, the input impedance seen by the source is
very large, ideally inﬁnite. The ideal equivalent circuit of the noninverting op-amp is
shown in Figure 9.16.
Voltage Follower
An interesting property of the noninverting op-amp occurs when R1 = ∞, an open
circuit. The closed-loop gain then becomes
Av = vO
vI
= 1
(9.35)
Since the output voltage follows the input, this op-amp circuit is called a voltage
follower. The closed-loop gain is independent of resistor R2 (except when R2 = ∞),
so we can set R2 = 0 to create a short circuit.

Part 2
Analog Electronics
The voltage-follower op-amp circuit is shown in Figure 9.17. At ﬁrst glance, it
might seem that this circuit, with unity voltage gain, would be of little value. However,
other terms used for the voltage follower are impedance transformer or buffer. The
input impedance is essentially inﬁnite, and the output impedance is essentially zero. If,
for example, the output impedance of a signal source is large, a voltage follower in-
serted between the source and a load will prevent loading effects, that is, it will act as a
buffer between the source and the load.
Consider the case of a voltage source with a 100 k output impedance driving a
1 k load impedance, as shown in Figure 9.18(a). This situation may occur if the
source is a transducer. (We will see an example of this later in the chapter when we
consider a temperature-sensitive resistor, or thermistor, in a bridge circuit.) The ratio
of output voltage to input voltage is
vO

This equation indicates that, for this case, there is a severe loading effect, or attenu-
ation, in the signal voltage.
Figure 9.18(b) shows a voltage follower inserted between the source and the
load. Since the input impedance to the noninverting terminal is usually much greater
than 100 k, then vO ∼= vI and the loading effect is eliminated.

OP-AMP APPLICATIONS 
Objective: • Analyze several ideal op-amp circuits including the
difference ampliﬁer and the instrumentation ampliﬁer.
The summing ampliﬁer is one example of special functional capabilities that can be
provided by the op-amp. In this section, we will look at other examples of op-amp
versatility.
Current-to-Voltage Converter
In some situations, the output of a device or circuit is a current. An example is the
output of a photodiode or photodetector. We may need to convert this output current
to an output voltage.
Consider the circuit in Figure 9.20. The input resistance Ri at the virtual ground
node is
Ri = v1
i1
∼= 0
(9.36)
In most cases, we can assume that RS ≫Ri; therefore, current i1 is essentially equal
to the signal current iS. Then,
i2 = i1 = iS
(9.37)
and
vO = −i2RF = −iS RF

circuit in Figure 9.19. (Ans. vO = 10vI1 + 5vI2)

642
Part 2
Analog Electronics
The output voltage is directly proportional to the signal current, and the feedback re-
sistance RF is the magnitude of the ratio of the output voltage to the signal current.
Voltage-to-Current Converter
The complement of the current-to-voltage converter is the voltage-to-current con-
verter. For example, we may want to drive a coil in a magnetic circuit with a given
current, using a voltage source. We could use the inverting op-amp shown in Figure
9.21. For this circuit,
i2 = i1 = vI
R1
(9.39)
which means that current i2 is directly proportional to input voltage vI and is inde-
pendent of the load impedance or resistance R2. However, one side of the load device
might need to be at ground potential, so the circuit in Figure 9.21 would not be prac-
tical for such applications.

Consider the circuit in Figure 9.22. In this case, one terminal of the load device,
which has an impedance of ZL, is at ground potential. The inverting terminal (1) is
not at virtual ground. From the virtual short concept, v1 = v2. We also note that
v1 = v2 = vL = iL ZL. Equating the currents i1 and i2, we have
vI −iL ZL

(9.45)
which means that the load current is proportional to the input voltage and is inde-
pendent of the load impedance ZL, as long as the output voltage remains between
allowed limits.
We may note that the input resistance seen by the source vI is ﬁnite, and is actu-
ally a function of the load impedance ZL. For a constant iL, a change in ZL produces
a change in vL = v2 = v1, which causes a change in i1. A voltage follower may be
inserted between the voltage source vI and the resistor R1 to eliminate any loading
effects due to a variable input resistance.

Objective: Determine a load current in a voltage-to-current converter.
Consider the circuit in Figure 9.22. Let ZL = 100 , R1 = 10 k, R2 = 1 k,
R3 = 1 k, and RF = 10 k. If vI = −5 V, determine the load current iL and the
output voltage vO.

The output voltage is then
vO = i3R3 + vL = (5.5 × 10−3)(103) + 0.5 = 6 V
We could also calculate i1 and i2 as 
i1 = i2 = −0.55 mA
Comment: In this example, we implicitly assume that the op-amp is not in satura-
tion, which means that the applied dc bias voltage must be greater than 6 V. In
addition, since currents i2 (which is negative) and i3 must be supplied by the op-amp,
we are assuming that the op-amp is capable of supplying 6.05 mA.
Computer Veriﬁcation: The PSpice circuit schematic of the voltage-to-current
converter is shown in Figure 9.23(a). The input voltage was varied between 0 and
−10 V. Figure 9.23(b) shows the current through the 100  load and Figure 9.23(c)

Chapter 9 Ideal Operational Ampliﬁers and Op-Amp Circuits 
645
shows the op-amp output voltage as a function of the input voltage. At approximately
vI = −7.5 V, the op-amp saturates, so the load current and output voltage no longer
increase with input voltage. This result demonstrates that the ideal voltage-to-current
conversion is valid only if the op-amp is operating in its linear region. Figure 9.23(d)
shows the output voltage as a function of load resistance for an input voltage of
vI = −5 V. At a load resistance greater than approximately 900 , the op-amp
saturates. The range over which the op-amp remains linear could be increased by
increasing the bias to ±15 V, for example. 
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 9.5: Consider the voltage-to-current converter shown in Figure 9.22. The load
impedance is ZL = 200  and the input voltage is vI = −3 V. Determine iL and
vO if R1 = 10 k, R2 = 1.5 k, R3 = 3 k, and RF = 20 k. (Ans. iL = 2 mA,
vO = 7.2 V)
Difference Ampliﬁer
An ideal difference ampliﬁer ampliﬁes only the difference between two signals; it re-
jects any common signals to the two input terminals. For example, a microphone sys-
tem ampliﬁes an audio signal applied to one terminal of a difference ampliﬁer, and
rejects any 60 Hz noise signal or “hum” existing on both terminals. The basic op-amp
also ampliﬁes the difference between two input signals. However, we would like to
make a difference ampliﬁer, in which the output is a function of the ratio of resistors,
as we had for the inverting and noninverting ampliﬁers.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.24(a), with inputs vI1 and vI2. To analyze
the circuit, we will use superposition and the virtual short concept. Figure 9.24(b)

A property of the ideal difference ampliﬁer is that the output voltage is zero
when vI1 = vI2. An inspection of Equation (9.50(b)) shows that this condition is
met if

The output voltage is then

(9.52)
which indicates that this ampliﬁer has a differential gain of Ad = R2/R1. This factor
is a closed-loop differential gain, rather than the open-loop differential gain Aod of
the op-amp itself.
As previously stated, another important characteristic of electronic circuits is the
input resistance. The differential input resistance of the differential ampliﬁer can
be determined by using the circuit shown in Figure 9.25. In the ﬁgure, we have

Chapter 9 Ideal Operational Ampliﬁers and Op-Amp Circuits 
647
imposed the condition given in Equation (9.51) and have set R1 = R3 and R2 = R4.
The input resistance is then deﬁned as
Ri = vI
i
(9.53)
Taking into account the virtual short concept, we can write a loop equation, as
follows:
vI = i R1 + i R1 = i(2R1)
(9.54)
Therefore, the input resistance is
Ri = 2R1
(9.55)
DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.6
Objective: Design a difference ampliﬁer with a speciﬁed gain.
Speciﬁcations: Design the difference ampliﬁer with the conﬁguration shown in Fig-
ure 9.24 such that the differential gain is 30. Standard valued resistors are to be used
and the maximum resistor value is to be 500 k.
Choices: An ideal op-amp is available.
Solution: The differential gain is given by
R2
R1
= R4
R3
= 30
From Appendix C, we can use standard resistors of
R2 = R4 = 390 k
and
R1 = R3 = 13 k
These resistor values are obviously less than 500 k and will give an input resistance
of Ri = 2R1 = 2(13) = 26 k.
Trade-offs: Resistor tolerances must be considered as we have in other designs. This
effect is considered in end-of-chapter Problem 9.62. Resistor tolerances also affect
the common-mode rejection ratio, as analyzed in the following example.
Comment: This example illustrated one disadvantage of this differential ampliﬁer
design. It cannot achieve both high gain and high input impedance without using
extremely large resistor values.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 9.6: Consider the difference ampliﬁer in Figure 9.24(a). (a) Design the circuit
with R2 = R4, R1 = R3, and such that the differential voltage gain is Ad = 50.
For input voltages in the range of −50 mV to +50 mV, the maximum current in
R2 is to be limited to 50 μA. (b) Using the results of part (a), what is the maximum
current in R3? (Ans. (a) Set R2 = R4 = 100 k, then R1 = R2 = 2 k; 
(b) 0.49 μA)
In the ideal difference ampliﬁer, the output vO is zero when vI1 = vI2. However,
an inspection of Equation (9.50(b)) shows that this condition is not satisﬁed if
R4/R3 ̸= R2/R1. When vI1 = vI2, the input is called a common-mode input signal.
The common-mode input voltage is deﬁned as
vcm = (vI1 + vI2)/2
(9.56)
The common-mode gain is then deﬁned as 
Acm = vO
vcm
(9.57)
Ideally, when a common-mode signal is applied, vO = 0 and Acm = 0.
A nonzero common-mode gain may be generated in actual op-amp circuits. This
is discussed in Chapter 14.
A ﬁgure of merit for a difference ampliﬁer is the common-mode rejection ratio
(CMRR), which is deﬁned as the magnitude of the ratio of differential gain to
common-mode gain, or
CMRR =

Ad
Acm

(9.58)
Usually, the CMRR is expressed in decibels, as follows: 
CMRR(dB) = 20 log10

(9.59)
Ideally, the common-mode rejection ratio is inﬁnite. In an actual differential ampli-
ﬁer, we would like the common-mode rejection ratio to be as large as possible. 
EXAMPLE 9.7
Objective: Calculate the common-mode rejection ratio of a difference ampliﬁer.
Consider the difference ampliﬁer shown in Figure 9.24(a). Let R2/R1 = 10 and
R4/R3 = 11. Determine CMRR(dB).
Solution: From Equation (9.50(b)), we have
vO = (1 + 10)

vI2 −(10)vI1
or 
vO = 10.0833vI2 −10vI1

The differential-mode input voltage is deﬁned as 
vd = vI2 −vI1

Chapter 9 Ideal Operational Ampliﬁers and Op-Amp Circuits 
649
and the common-mode input voltage is deﬁned as 
vcm = (vI1 + vI2)/2
Combining these two equations produces 
vI1 = vcm −vd
2
(9.61(a))
and 
vI2 = vcm + vd
2
(9.61(b))
If we substitute Equations (9.61(a)) and (9.61(b)) in Equation (9.60), we obtain
vO = (10.0833)

vcm + vd

or 
vO = 10.042vd + 0.0833vcm
(9.62)
The output voltage is also
vO = Advd + Acmvcm
(9.63)
If we compare Equations (9.62) and (9.63), we see that
Ad = 10.042
and
Acm = 0.0833
Therefore, from Equation (9.59), the common-mode rejection ratio, is
CMRR(dB) = 20 log10
10.042
0.0833

= 41.6 dB
Comment: For good differential ampliﬁers, typical CMRR values are in the range of
80–100 dB. This example shows how close the ratios R2/R1 and R4/R3 must be in
order to achieve a CMRR value in that range.
Computer Veriﬁcation: A PSpice analysis was performed on the differential ampli-
ﬁer in this example with a μA-741 op-amp. For input voltages of vI1 = −50 mV and
vI2 = +50 mV, the output voltage is vO = 1.0043 V, which gives a differential
voltage gain of 10.043. For input voltages of vI1 = vI2 = 5 V, the output voltage
is vO = 0.4153 V, which gives a common-mode voltage gain of Acm = 0.4153/5 =
0.0831. The common-mode rejection ratio is then CMRR = 10.043/0.0831 =
120.9 ⇒41.6 dB, which agrees with the hand analysis. This result demonstrates that
at this point, the nonideal characteristics of the μA-741 op-amp do not affect these
results.
EXERCISE PROBLEM

and (b) vI1 = vI2 = +1 V. (c) Determine the common-mode gain. (d) Determine
the CMRR(dB). (Ans. (a) vO = −4.032 V, (b) vO = 0.0323 V, (c) Acm = 0.0323,

Instrumentation Ampliﬁer
We saw in the last section that it is difﬁcult to obtain a high input impedance and a
high gain in a difference ampliﬁer with reasonable resistor values. One solution is to
insert a voltage follower between each source and the corresponding input. However,
a disadvantage of this design is that the gain of the ampliﬁer cannot easily be
changed. We would need to change two resistance values and still maintain equal
ratios between R2/R1 and R4/R3. Optimally, we would like to be able to change the
gain by changing only a single resistance value. The circuit in Figure 9.26, called
an instrumentation ampliﬁer, allows this ﬂexibility. Note that two noninverting
ampliﬁers, A1 and A2, are used as the input stage, and a difference ampliﬁer, A3 is the
second, or amplifying, stage.

We begin the analysis using the virtual short concept. The voltages at the invert-
ing terminals of the voltage followers are equal to the input voltages. The currents and
voltages in the ampliﬁer are shown in Figure 9.27. The current in resistor R1 is then
i1 = vI1 −vI2

The current in resistors R2 is also i1, as shown in the ﬁgure, and the output voltages

resistance R1 in

Since the input signal voltages are applied directly to the noninverting terminals
of A1 and A2, the input impedance is very large, ideally inﬁnite, which is one desir-
able characteristic of the instrumentation ampliﬁer. Also, the differential gain is a
function of resistor R1, which can easily be varied by using a potentiometer, thus pro-
viding a variable ampliﬁer gain with the adjustment of only one resistance.
EXAMPLE 9.8
Objective: Determine the range required for resistor R1, to realize a differential gain
adjustable from 5 to 500.
The instrumentation ampliﬁer circuit is shown in Figure 9.26. Assume that
R4 = 2R3, so that the difference ampliﬁer gain is 2.
Solution: Assume that resistance R1 is a combination of a ﬁxed resistance R1f and a
variable resistance R1v, as shown in Figure 9.28. The ﬁxed resistance ensures that the
gain is limited to a maximum value, even if the variable resistance is set equal to
zero. Assume the variable resistance is a 100 k potentiometer.
From Equation (9.67), the maximum differential gain is
500 = 2

and the minimum differential gain is 
5 = 2


From the maximum gain expression, we ﬁnd that

Substituting this R2 value into the minimum gain expression, we have 
1.5 =
2R2
R1 f + 100 =
249R1 f
R1 f + 100
The resulting value of R1 f is R1 f = 0.606 k, which yields R2 = 75.5 k. 
Comment: We can select standard resistance values that are close to the values cal-
culated, and the range of the gain will be approximately in the desired range.
Design Pointer: An ampliﬁer with a wide range of gain and designed with a
potentiometer would normally not be used with standard integrated circuits in elec-
tronic systems. However, such a circuit might be very useful in specialized test
equipment.

In the op-amp circuits previously considered, the elements exterior to the op-amp

the same general form as before, that is,
vO

Equation (9.70) is the output response of the integrator circuit, shown in Fig-
ure 9.30, for any input voltage vI . Note that if vI(t) is a ﬁnite step function, output
vO will be a linear function of time. The output vO will be a ramp function and will
eventually saturate at a voltage near either the positive or negative supply voltage.
We will use the integrator in ﬁlter circuits, which are covered in Chapter 15.
We will show in Chapter 14 that nonzero bias currents into the op-amp greatly
inﬂuence the characteristics of this circuit. A dc current through the capacitor will
cause the output voltage to linearly change with time until the positive or negative

in parallel with the capacitor to periodically set the capacitor voltage to zero.
The second generalized inverting op-amp uses a capacitor for Z1 and a resistor
for Z2, as shown in Figure 9.31. The impedances are Z1 = 1/sC1 and Z2 = R2, and
the voltage transfer function is

(9.72)
The circuit in Figure 9.31 is therefore a differentiator.
Differentiator circuits are more susceptible to noise than are the integrator cir-
cuits. Input noise ﬂuctuations of small amplitudes may have large derivatives. When
differentiated, these noise ﬂuctuations may generate large noise signals at the output,
creating a poor output signal to noise ratio. This problem may be alleviated by plac-
ing a resistor in series with the input capacitor. This modiﬁed circuit then differenti-
ates low-frequency signals but has a constant high-frequency gain.
EXAMPLE 9.9
Objective: Determine the time constant required in an integrator.
Consider the integrator shown in Figure 9.30. Assume that voltage VC across the
capacitor is zero at t = 0. A step input voltage of vI = −1 V is applied at t = 0. De-
termine the time constant required such that the output reaches +10 V at t = 1 ms.

Nonlinear Circuit Applications
Up to this point in the chapter, we have used linear passive elements in conjunction
with the op-amp. Many useful circuits can be fabricated if nonlinear elements, such
as diodes or transistors, are used in the op-amp circuits. We will consider three sim-
ple examples to illustrate the types of nonlinear characteristics that can be generated
and to illustrate the general analysis technique.
Precision Half-Wave Rectiﬁer
An op-amp and diode are combined as shown in Figure 9.33 to form a precision half-
wave rectiﬁer. For vI > 0, the circuit behaves as a voltage follower. The output volt-
age is vO = vI , the load current iL is positive, and a positive diode current is induced
such that iD = iL. The feedback loop is closed through the forward-biased diode.
The output voltage of the op-amp, vO1, adjusts itself to exactly absorb the forward
voltage drop of the diode.
For vI < 0, the output voltage tends to go negative, which tends to produce neg-
ative load and diode currents. However, a negative diode current cannot exist, so the
diode cuts off, the feedback loop is broken, and vO = 0.
The voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 9.34. The rectiﬁcation is
precise in that, even at small positive input voltages, vO = vI and we do not observe
a diode cut-in voltage.
9.5.6

Chapter 9 Ideal Operational Ampliﬁers and Op-Amp Circuits 
655
A potential problem in this circuit exists for vI < 0. The feedback loop is broken
so that the op-amp output voltage vO1 will saturate near the negative supply voltage.
When vI switches positive, it will take time for the internal circuit to recover, so the
response time of the output voltage may be relatively slow. In addition, for vI < 0
and vO = 0, there is now a voltage difference applied across the input terminals of
the op-amp. Most op-amps provide input voltage protection so the op-amp will not
be damaged in this case. However, if the op-amp does not have input protection, the
op-amp may be damaged if the input voltage is larger than 5 or 6 V.
Log Ampliﬁer
Consider the circuit in Figure 9.35. The diode is to be forward biased, so the input
signal voltage is limited to positive values. The diode current is
iD = IS(evD/VT −1)
(9.73(a))
If the diode is sufﬁciently forward biased, the (−1) term is negligible, and
iD ∼= ISevD/VT
(9.73(b))
The input current can be written
i1 = vI
R1
(9.74)
and the output voltage, since v1 is at virtual ground, is given by
vO = −vD
(9.75)
Noting that i1 = iD, we can write
i1 = vI
R1
= iD = ISe−vO/VT

Equation (9.77(b)) indicates that, for this circuit, the output voltage is proportional
to the log of the input voltage. One disadvantage of this circuit is that the reverse-
saturation current IS is a strong function of temperature, and it varies substantially from
one diode to another. A more sophisticated circuit uses bipolar transistors to eliminate
the IS parameter in the log term. This circuit will not be considered here.

OPERATIONAL TRANSCONDUCTANCE
AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Discuss the operational transconductance ampliﬁer.
The operational ampliﬁers considered up to this point have been voltage ampliﬁers.
The input signal is a voltage and the output signal is a voltage.
Another type of op-amp is an operational transconductance ampliﬁer (OTA). This
op-amp is a voltage-input, current-output ampliﬁer. Its circuit symbol is shown in Fig-
ure 9.38(a) and the equivalent circuit model is given in Figure 9.38(b). For the ideal
OTA, both the input and output impedance is inﬁnite. (The output impedance of an
ideal current source is inﬁnite.) The output current for the ideal circuit can be written as
iO = gmvd
(9.80)
where gm is called the unloaded transconductance, with units of amperes per volt.
The transconductance can be varied by changing the control current in the op-amp
circuit. The OTA can then be used to electronically program functions.

One example of an OTA application is shown in Figure 9.39. This circuit is a
simple voltage-controlled ampliﬁer. The output op-amp is conﬁgured as a current-to-
voltage converter. We see that

where
vd =

470 + 33,000 · vI = 0.014vI
(9.83)
From the OTA circuit, we have
gm = icont

(9.84)
where VT = 0.026 V at room temperature. The control current is given by
icont =
vC
25 k
(9.85)
where vC may be in the range 2 ≤vC ≤10 V. The transconductance of the transcon-
ductance operational ampliﬁer is controlled by the control voltage vC.
Combining equations, we can write the voltage gain as
Av = vO
vI
= 0.269vC
(9.86)
The ampliﬁer shown in Figure 9.39 is then a voltage-controlled voltage ampliﬁer.
The ampliﬁcation factor is a function of the control voltage vC.This circuit can be
used as an amplitude modulator. The vI input may be the carrier signal and the vC
input may be the audio signal.
OTAs can also be used to design voltage-controlled ﬁlters and voltage-
controlled oscillators.

OP-AMP CIRCUIT DESIGN
Objective: • Design several ideal op-amp circuits with given design
speciﬁcations.
Up to this point, we have mainly been concerned with analyzing ideal op-amp
circuits and designing a few basic op-amp circuits. In this section, we will design
three speciﬁc op-amp circuits. We will assume that these circuits will be fabricated
as integrated circuits so that we are not limited to standard resistor values.

Summing Op-Amp Circuit Design
In an inverting summing op-amp, each input is connected to the inverting terminal
through a resistor. The summing op-amp can be designed such that the output is
vO = −a1vI1 −a2vI2 + a3vI3 + a4vI4
(9.87)
where the coefﬁcients ai are all positive. In one design, we could apply voltages vI3
and vI4 to inverter ampliﬁers and use the summing op-amp considered previously.
This design would require three such op-amps. Alternatively, we could use the re-
sults of Exercise TYU 9.8 to design a summing circuit that uses only one op-amp and
is more versatile.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.40. Resistor RC provides more versa-
tility in the design. When we consider nonideal effects, such as bias currents, in
op-circuits, in Chapter 14, we will impose a design constraint on the relationship
between the resistors connected to the inverting and noninverting terminals. In this
section, we will continue to use the ideal op-amp.

To determine the output voltage of our circuit, we use superposition. The inputs
vI1 and vI2 produce the usual outputs, as follows:
vO(vI1) = −RF
R1
vI1
(9.88(a))
and
vO(vI2) = −RF
R2
vI2
(9.88(b))
We then determine the output due to vI3, with all other inputs set equal to zero. We
can write
v2(vI3) =
RB∥RC
RA + RB∥Rc
vI3 = v1(vI3)
(9.89)
Since vI1 = vI2 = 0, the voltage v2(vI3) is the input to a noninverting op-amp with
R1 and R2 in parallel.
Then,
vO(vI3) =

DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.10
Objective: Design a summing op-amp to produce the output
vO = −10vI1 −4vI2 + 5vI3 + 2vI4
The smallest resistor value allowable is 20 k. Consider the circuit in Figure 9.40.
Solution: First we determine the values of resistors R1, R2, and RF, and then we can
determine the noninverting terms. We know that
RF
R1
= 10
and
RF
R2
= 4
Resistor R1 will be the smallest value, so we can set R1 = 20 k. Then,
RF = 200 k

R2 = 50 k

If we choose RA = 80 k, then RB = 200 k, RP = 26.67 k, and RC becomes
RC = 50 k.
Comment: We could change the number of inputs to either the inverting or nonin-
verting terminal, depending on the desired output versus input voltage response.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 9.10: Consider the summing op-amp in Figure 9.40. Let RF = 80 k,
R1 = 40 k, R2 = 20 k, RA = RB = 50 k, and RC = 100 k. (a) Determine
the output voltage in terms of the input voltages. (b) Determine vO for 
(i) vI1 = 0.1 V, vI2 = 0.15 V, vI3 = 0.2 V, vI4 = 0.3 V; and for (ii) vI1 = −0.2 V,
vI2 = 0.25 V, vI3 = −0.1 V, vI4 = 0.2 V. (Ans. (a) vO = −2vI1 −4vI2 +
2.8vI3 + 2.8vI4; (b) (i) vO = 0.6 V, (ii) vO = −0.32 V)
Reference Voltage Source Design
In Chapter 2, we discussed the use of Zener diodes to provide a constant or reference
voltage source. A limitation, however, was that the reference voltage could never be
greater than the Zener voltage. Now, we can combine a Zener diode with an op-amp
to provide more ﬂexibility in the design of reference voltage sources.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.41. Voltage source VS and resistor RS
bias the Zener diode in the breakdown region. The op-amp is then used as a nonin-
verting ampliﬁer. The output voltage is
VO =

1 + R2
R1

VZ
(9.95)
The output current to the load circuit is supplied by the op-amp. A change in the load
current will not produce a change in the Zener diode current; consequently, voltage
regulation is much improved compared to the simple Zener diode voltage source pre-
viously considered.
Since the incremental Zener resistance is not zero, the Zener diode voltage is a
slight function of the diode current. The circuit shown in Figure 9.42 is less affected
by variations in VS, since VS is used only to start up the circuit. The Zener diode be-
gins to conduct when

If VS decreases and diode D1 becomes reverse biased, the Zener diode continues to
conduct; the Zener diode current is then constant. However, if diode D1 is conducting,
the circuit can be designed such that variations in Zener diode current will be small.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.11
Objective: Design a voltage reference source with an output of 10.0 V. Use a Zener
diode with a breakdown voltage of 5.6 V. Assume the voltage regulation will be
within speciﬁcations if the Zener diode is biased between 1–1.2 mA.
Solution: Consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.42. For this example, we need
VO

Therefore,

We know that

RF
If we set IF equal to the minimum bias current, we have
1 mA = 10 −5.6
RF
which means that RF = 4.4 k. If we choose R2 = 30 k, then R1 = 38.17 k.
Resistors R3 and R4 can be determined from Figure 9.43. The maximum Zener
current supplied by VS, R3, and R4 should be no more than 0.2 mA. We set the cur-
rent through D1 equal to 0.2 mA, for VS = 10 V. We then have
V ′

Comment: Voltage VS is used as a start-up source. Once the Zener diode is biased in
breakdown, the output will be maintained at 10.0 V, even if VS is reduced to zero.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 9.11: Consider the op-amp voltage reference circuit in Figure 9.42 with para-
meters given in Example 9.11. Initially set VS = 10 V and then plot, using PSpice,
vO and IF versus VS as VS decreases from 10 to 0 V. Bias the op-amp at ±15 V.
Difference Ampliﬁer and Bridge Circuit Design
A transducer is a device that transforms one form of energy into another form. One
type of transducer uses nonelectrical inputs to produce electrical outputs. For exam-
ple, a microphone converts acoustical energy into electrical energy. A pressure trans-
ducer is a device in which, for example, a resistance is a function of pressure, so that
pressure can be converted to an electrical signal. Often, the output characteristics of
these transducers are measured with a bridge circuit.
Figure 9.44 shows a bridge circuit. Resistance R3 represents the transducer, and
parameter δ is the deviation of R3 from R2 due to the input response of the transducer.
The output voltage vO1 is a measure of δ. If vO1 is an open-circuit voltage, then
vO1 =

R2(1 + δ)
R2(1 + δ) + R1
−

R1 + R2

V +
(9.99)
which reduces to
vO1 = δ
 R1∥R2
R1 + R2

V +
(9.100)
Since neither side of voltage vO1 is at ground potential, we must connect vO1 to
an instrumentation ampliﬁer. In addition, vO1 is directly proportional to supply volt-
age V +; therefore, this bias should be a well-deﬁned voltage reference.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 9.12
Objective: Design an ampliﬁer system that will produce an output voltage of ±5 V
when the resistance R3 deviates by ±1% from the value of R2. This would occur, for
example, in a system where R3 is a thermistor whose resistance is given by
R3 = 200

where T is the absolute temperature. For R3 to vary by ±1% means the temperature
is in the range 225 ≤T ≤375 K.
Consider biasing the bridge circuit at V + = 7.5 V using a 5.6 V Zener diode.
Assume ±10 V is available for biasing the op-amp and reference voltage source, and
that R1 = R2 = 200 k.
Solution: With R1 = R2, from Equation (9.100), we have
vO1 =

For V + = 7.5 V and δ = 0.01, the maximum output of the bridge circuit is vO1 =
0.01875 V. If the output of the ampliﬁer system is to be +5 V, the gain of the instru-
mentation ampliﬁer must be 5/0.01875 = 266.7. Consider the instrumentation
ampliﬁer shown in Figure 9.26. The output voltage is given by Equation (9.67), which
can be written

tiometer, to permit adjustment of the gain.
Comment: The complete design of this instrumentation ampliﬁer is shown in Fig-
ure 9.45. Correlation of the reference voltage source design is left as an exercise.
Design Pointer: The design of fairly sophisticated op-amp circuits is quite straight-
forward when the ideal op-amp parameters are used.

DESIGN APPLICATION: ELECTRONIC
THERMOMETER WITH AN INSTRUMENTATION
AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Design an electronic thermometer with an instrumenta-
tion ampliﬁer to provide the necessary ampliﬁcation.
Speciﬁcations: The temperature range to be measured is 0 to 100 ◦F. The output
voltage is to be in the range of 0 to 5 V with 0 V corresponding to 0 ◦F and 5 V cor-
responding to 100 ◦F.
Design Approach: In Chapter 1, we began a design of an electronic thermometer
using the temperature characteristics of a pn junction diode. Here, we expand on that
design.
Figure 9.48(a) shows a circuit with two diodes, each biased with a constant cur-
rent source. Figure 9.48(b) shows the same circuit, but with the constant current
sources implemented with transistor circuits. The current source circuits were brieﬂy

described and analyzed in Chapter 5. The two diodes, D1 and D2, are assumed to be
matched or identical devices. We also assume that all transistors are matched. Ne-
glecting base currents, we have I1 = IREF1 and I2 = IREF2.
Choices: Ideal matched silicon diodes and bipolar transistors are available. In addi-
tion, ideal op-amps are available.
Solution (Diodes): From Chapter 1, we can write the voltage drops across each
diode as
VD1 = VT ln

(9.101(a))
and
VD2 = VT ln
 I2
IS

(9.101(b))
We may note that, since the two diodes are matched, the reverse-saturation current,
IS, is the same in the two expressions.
The output voltage is deﬁned as the difference between the voltages across the
two diodes, or

perature to degrees Celsius and then to degrees Fahrenheit, we ﬁnd

Solution (Instrumentation Ampliﬁer): Since neither terminal of the output voltage
is at ground potential, we can apply this voltage to an instrumentation ampliﬁer to
obtain a voltage gain. The output of the instrumentation ampliﬁer will be applied to a
summing ampliﬁer in addition to an offset voltage. The objective of the design is to
obtain an output voltage of zero volts at TF = 0 and an output voltage of 5 V at
TF = 100 ◦F.
If the gain of the instrumentation ampliﬁer is A = −129.55, then the output of
the instrumentation ampliﬁer is as follows:
Solution (Output Stage): The offset voltage can be generated by using the nonin-
verting op-amp circuit with a Zener diode, as shown in Figure 9.49. If we use a Zener
diode with a breakdown voltage of 3.60 V and if we set R3/R4 = 0.277, then the
output voltage is VO2 = +4.597 V. Applying the output voltage of the instrumenta-
tion ampliﬁer, VO1, and the offset voltage, VO2, to a summing ampliﬁer with a gain
of −5 as shown in Figure 9.49, we achieve the desired speciﬁcations. That is VO = 0
at TF = 0 and VO = 5 V at TF = 100 ◦F.
Comment: The primary advantage of this system is that the output voltage is a lin-
ear function of temperature.
In Chapter 16, we can apply the analog output voltage VO to an A/D converter
and use a seven-segment display so that the output signal is actually displayed in
terms of degrees Fahrenheit.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, we considered the ideal operational ampliﬁer (op-amp) and var-
ious op-amp applications. The op-amp is a three-terminal device (three signal
terminals) that ideally ampliﬁes only the difference between two input signals.
The op-amp, then, is a high-gain differential ampliﬁer.
•
The ideal op-amp model has inﬁnite input impedance (zero input bias currents),
inﬁnite open-loop differential voltage gain (zero voltage between the two input
terminals), and zero output impedance.
•
Two basic op-amp circuits are the inverting ampliﬁer and the noninverting am-
pliﬁer. For an ideal op-amp, the voltage gain of these circuits is just a function of
the ratio of resistors.
•
Other ampliﬁer conﬁgurations considered were the summing ampliﬁer, voltage
follower, current-to-voltage converter, and voltage-to-current converter.
•
A versatile circuit is the instrumentation ampliﬁer. The input resistance is essen-
tially inﬁnite and the ampliﬁer gain can be varied by changing a single resistor
value.
•
If a capacitor is included as a feedback element, the output voltage is the integral of
the input voltage. If a capacitor is included as an input element, the output voltage
is the derivative of the input voltage. Nonlinear feedback elements, such as diodes
or transistors, produce nonlinear transfer functions such as a logarithmic function.
•
As an application, an electronic thermometer in conjunction with an instrumen-
tation ampliﬁer was designed to yield a given ampliﬁcation.

Chapter
The biasing techniques in Chapters 3 through 6 for FET and BJT ampliﬁers for the
most part used voltage-divider resistor networks. While this technique can be used for
discrete circuits, it is not suitable for integrated circuits. Resistors require relatively
large areas on an IC compared to transistors; therefore, a resistor-intensive circuit
would necessitate a large chip area. Also, the resistor biasing technique uses coupling
and bypass capacitors extensively. On an IC, it is almost impossible to fabricate
capacitors in the microfarad range, as would be required for the coupling capacitors.
Biasing transistors and transistor circuits in ICs is considerably different from
that in discrete transistor designs. Essentially, biasing integrated circuit ampliﬁers in-
volves the use of constant-current sources. In this chapter, we will analyze and de-
sign both bipolar and FET circuits that form these constant-current sources. We will
begin to see for the ﬁrst time in this chapter the use of matched or identical transistor
characteristics as a speciﬁc design parameter. Transistors can easily be fabricated in
ICs with matched or identical parameters. A principal goal of this chapter is to help
the reader understand how matched transistor characteristics are used in design and
to be able to design BJT and MOSFET current source circuits.
Transistors are also used as load devices in ampliﬁer circuits. These transistors,

source, so an initial discussion of active loads is entirely appropriate in this chapter.

BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR CURRENT SOURCES
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of various
bipolar circuits used to provide a constant output current.
As we saw in previous chapters, when the bipolar transistor is used as a linear
amplifying device, it must be biased in the forward-active mode. The bias may be a
current source that establishes the quiescent collector current as shown in Fig-
ure 10.1. We now need to consider the types of circuits that can be designed to
establish the bias current IO. We will discuss a simple two-transistor current-source
circuit and then two improved versions of the constant-current source. We will then
analyze another current-source circuit, known as the Widlar current source. Finally,
we will discuss a multitransistor current source.
Two-Transistor Current Source
The two-transistor current source, also called a current mirror, is the basic build-
ing block in the design of integrated circuit current sources. Figure 10.2(a) shows the
basic current-source circuit, which consists of two matched or identical transistors,
Q1 and Q2, operating at the same temperature, with their base terminals and emitter
terminals connected together. The B–E voltage is therefore the same in the two
transistors. Transistor Q1 is connected as a diode; consequently, when the supply
voltages are applied, the B–E junction of Q1 is forward biased and a reference
current IREF is established. Although there is a speciﬁc relationship between IREF and
VBE1, we can think of VBE1 as being the result of IREF. Once VBE1 is established, it is
applied to the B–E junction of Q2. The applied VBE2 turns Q2 on and generates the
load current IO, which is used to bias a transistor or transistor circuit.
The reference current in the two-transistor current source can be established by
connecting a resistor to the positive voltage source, as shown in Figure 10.2(b). The
reference current is then
IREF = V + −VBE −V −

1In actual circuits, the collector–emitter voltage may decrease to values as low as 0.2 or 0.3 V, and the
circuit will still behave as a constant-current source.
where VBE is the B–E voltage corresponding to the collector current, which is es-
sentially equal to IREF.
Connecting the base and collector terminals of a bipolar transistor effectively
produces a two-terminal device with I–V characteristics that are identical to the iC
versus vBE characteristic of the BJT. For vC B = 0, the transistor is still biased in the
forward-active mode, and the base, collector, and emitter currents are related through
the current gain β. In constant-current source circuits, β is a dc term that is the ratio
of the dc collector current to the dc base current. However, as discussed in Chapter 5,
we assume the dc leakage currents are negligible; therefore, the dc beta and ac beta
are essentially the same. We do not distinguish between the two values.
Current Relationships
Figure 10.2(a) shows the currents in the two-transistor current source. Since VBE
is the same in both devices, and the transistors are identical, then IB1 = IB2 and IC1 = IC2.
Transistor Q2 is assumed to be biased in the forward-active region. If we sum the cur-
rents at the collector node of Q1, we have
IREF = IC1 + IB1 + IB2 = IC1 + 2IB2
(10.2)
Replacing IC1 by IC2 and noting that IB2 = IC2/β, Equation (10.2) becomes
IREF = IC2 + 2 IC2

(10.4)
Equation (10.4) gives the ideal output current of the two-transistor current
source, taking into account the ﬁnite current gain of the transistors. Implicit in Equa-
tion (10.4) is that Q2 is biased in the forward-active region (the base–collector junc-
tion is zero or reverse biased, meaning VC E2 > VBE21) and the Early voltage is
inﬁnite, or VA = ∞. We will consider the effects of a ﬁnite Early voltage later in this
chapter.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 10.1
Objective: Design a two-transistor current source to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit to be designed has the conﬁguration shown in Fig-
ure 10.2(b).Assume that matched transistors are available with parameters VBE(on) =
0.6 V, β = 100, and VA = ∞. The designed output IO is to be 200 μA. The bias volt-
ages are to be V + = 5 V and V −= 0.
Choices: The circuit will be fabricated as an integrated circuit so that a standard
resistor value is not required and matched transistors can be fabricated.

From Equation (10.1), the resistor R1 is found to be

0.204 = 21.6 k
Trade-offs: The design assumes that matched transistors exist. The effect of mis-
matched transistors will be discussed later in this section.
Comment: In this example, we assumed a B–E voltage of 0.6 V. This approximation
is satisfactory for most cases. The B–E voltage is involved in the reference current or
resistor calculation. If a value of VBE(on) = 0.7 V is assumed, the value of IREF or R1
will change, typically, by only 1 to 2 percent.
Design Pointer: We see in this example that, for β = 100, the reference and load
currents are within 2 percent of each other in this two-transistor current source. In
most circuit applications, we can use the approximation that IO ∼= IREF.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.1: The circuit parameters for the two-transistor current source shown in
Figure 10.2(b) are V + = 3 V, V −= −3 V, and R1 = 47 k. The transistor para-
meters are β = 120, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞. Determine IREF, IO, and IB1.
(Ans. IREF = 0.1128 mA, IO = 0.1109 mA, IB1 = 0.9243 μA)
Output Resistance
In our previous analysis, we assumed the Early voltage was inﬁnite, so that rO = ∞.
In actual transistors, the Early voltage is ﬁnite, which means that the collector current
is a function of the collector–emitter voltage. The stability of a load current generated
in a constant-current source is a function of the output resistance looking back into
the output transistor.
Figure 10.3 shows the dc equivalent circuit of a simple transistor circuit biased
with a two-transistor current source. The voltage VI applied to the base of Qo is a dc
voltage. If the value of VI changes, the collector–emitter voltage VC E2 changes since
the B–E voltage of Qo is essentially a constant. A variation in VC E2 in turn changes
the output current IO, because of the Early effect. Figure 10.4 shows that IO versus
VC E2 characteristic at a constant B–E voltage.
The ratio of load current to reference current, taking the Early effect into
account, is

VC E2 = VI −VBEo −V −

EXAMPLE 10.2
Objective: Determine the change in load current produced by a change in collector–
emitter voltage in a two-transistor current source.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.3. The circuit parameters are:
V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V, and R1 = 9.3 k. Assume the transistor parameters are:
β = 50, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 80 V. Determine the change in IO as VC E2
changes from 0.7 V to 5 V.
Solution: The reference current is

Comment: Although in many circuits a 5 percent change in bias current is insigni-
ﬁcant, there are cases, such as digital-to-analog converters, in which the bias current
must be held to very tight tolerances. The stability of the load current can be signiﬁ-
cantly affected by a change in collector–emitter voltage. The stability is a function of
the output impedance of the current source.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.2: Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.3. The circuit parameters are:
V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V, and R1 = 12 k. The transistor parameters are β = 75
and VBE(on) = 0.7 V. The percentage change in load current IO/IO must be no
more than 2 percent for a change in VC E2 from 1 V to 5 V. Determine the mini-
mum required value of Early voltage. (Ans. VA ∼= 200 V)
Integrated Circuit Fabrication
We have assumed in the previous analysis that the two transistors in the current source
circuit are matched or identical. When fabricated as an integrated circuit, the two tran-
sistors will be directly adjacent to each other. The material properties will therefore be
essentially identical, and any ion implant dose and thermal anneal characteristics will
be essentially identical. So, the two adjacent transistors can be very well matched.
There may be some variation in transistor characteristics from one circuit to another
but, again, the characteristics of the adjacent transistors are closely matched. In prac-
tice, the characteristics of Q1 and Q2 may be mismatched by 1 or 2 percent.
Mismatched Transistors
If β ≫1, we can neglect base currents. The current–voltage relationship for the
circuit in Figure 10.2(b) is then
IREF ∼= IC1 = IS1eVBE/VT
(10.9(a))
and
IO = IC2 = IS2eVBE/VT
(10.9(b))

Chapter 10 Integrated Circuit Biasing and Active Loads
693
Here, we are neglecting the Early effect. The parameters IS1 and IS2 contain both the
electrical and geometric parameters of Q1 and Q2. If Q1 and Q2 are not identical, then
IS1 ̸= IS2.
Combining Equations (10.9(a)) and (10.9(b)), we obtain the relationship between
the bias and reference currents, neglecting base currents, as follows:
IO = IREF
 IS2
IS1

(10.10)
Any deviation in bias current from the ideal, as a function of mismatch between Q1
and Q2, is directly related to the ratio of the reverse-saturation currents IS1 and IS2.
The parameter IS is a strong function of temperature. The temperatures of Q1 and Q2
must be the same in order for the circuit to operate properly. Therefore, Q1 and
Q2 must be close to one another on the semiconductor chip. If Q1 and Q2 are not
maintained at the same temperature, then the relationship between IO and IREF is a
function of temperature, which is undesirable.
Also, the parameters IS1 and IS2 are functions of the cross-sectional area of the
B–E junctions. Therefore, we can use Equation (10.10) to our advantage. By using
different sizes of transistors, we can design the circuit such that IO ̸= IREF. This is
discussed further later in this chapter.
Integrated circuit resistors are a function of the resistivity of the semiconductor
material as well as the geometry of the device. Since the geometry of each IC resis-
tor can be individually designed, resistor values are not limited to standard values.
So, IC resistors of any value (within reason) can be fabricated.
Improved Current-Source Circuits
In many IC designs, critical current-source characteristics are the changes in bias
current with variations in β and with changes in the output transistor collector volt-
age. In this section, we will look at two constant-current circuits that have improved
load current stability against changes in β and changes in output collector voltage.
Basic Three-Transistor Current Source
A basic three-transistor current source is shown in Figure 10.5. We again assume that
all transistors are identical; therefore, since the B–E voltage is the same for Q1 and

Q2, IB1 = IB2 and IC1 = IC2. Transistor Q3 supplies the base currents to Q1 and Q2,
so these base currents should be less dependent on the reference current. Also, since
the current in Q3 is substantially smaller than that in either Q1 or Q2, we expect the
current gain of Q3 to be less than those of Q1 and Q2. We deﬁne the current gains of
Q1 and Q2 as β1 = β2 ≡β, and the current gain of Q3 as β3. Summing the currents
at the collector node of Q1, we obtain
IREF = IC1 + IB3
(10.11)
Since
IB1 = IB2 = 2IB2 = IE3
(10.12)
and
IE3 = (1 + β3)IB3
(10.13)
then combining Equations (10.11), (10.12), and (10.13) produces
IREF = IC1 +

(1 + β3) = IC1 +

The reference current is given by

(10.17)
As a ﬁrst approximation, we usually assume that the B–E voltage of Q3 and Q1 are
equal, as indicated in Equation (10.17).
A comparison of Equation (10.16) for the three-transistor current source and
Equation (10.4) for the two-transistor current source shows that the approximation of
IO ∼= IREF is better for the three-transistor circuit. In addition, as we will see in the
following example, the change in load current with a change in β is much smaller in
the three-transistor current source.

Objective: Comparethevariationinbiascurrentbetweenthetwo-andthree-transistor
current-source circuits as a result of variations in β.APSpice analysis is used.
Figure 10.6(a) shows the two-transistor PSpice circuit schematic and Fig-
ure 10.6(b) shows the three-transistor PSpice circuit schematic used in this analysis.

Chapter 10 Integrated Circuit Biasing and Active Loads
695
Solution: In both circuits, the current gain β of all transistors was assumed to be
equal, but the actual value was varied between 20 and 200. Since the change in β is
very large, we cannot use derivatives to determine the changes in bias currents. Stan-
dard 2N3904 transistors were used, which means that the Early voltage is 74 V, and
not inﬁnite as in the ideal circuit. The Early voltage will inﬂuence the actual value of
bias current, but has very little effect in terms of the change in bias current with a
change in current gain.
Figure 10.6(c) shows the bias current versus current gain for both the two-
transistor and three-transistor current-source circuits.
Comment: There is a signiﬁcant decrease in the variation in bias current for the
three-transistor circuit compared to that of the two-transistor circuit. For values of β
greater than approximately 50, there is no perceptible change in bias current for the
three-transistor current mirror.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.3: The parameters of the circuit shown in Figure 10.5 are: V + = 3 V,
V −= −3 V, and R1 = 30 k. The parameters of the transistors Q1 and Q2 are
VBE1,2(on) = 0.7 V and β = 120. The parameters of the transistor Q3 are
VBE3 (on) = 0.6 V and β3 = 80. Assume VA = ∞for all three transistors. Deter-
mine the value of each current shown in the ﬁgure. (Ans. IREF = 0.15667 mA,
IO = 0.15663 mA= IC1 = IC2, 
IB1 = IB2 = 1.3053 μA, 
IE3 = 2.6106 μA,
IB3 = 0.03223 μA)
The output resistance looking into the collector of the output transistor Q2 of the
basic three-transistor current source shown in Figure 10.5 is the same as that of the
two-transistor current source; that is,
dIO
dVC E2
= 1
ro2
(10.18a)
where
ro2 = VA
IO
(10.18b)
This means that, in the three-transistor current source, the change in bias current IO
with a change in VCE2 is the same as that in the two-transistor current-source circuit.
In addition, any mismatch between Q1 and Q2 produces a deviation in the bias
current from the ideal, as given by Equation (10.10).
Cascode Current Source
Current-source circuits can be designed such that the output resistance is much
greater than that of the two-transistor circuit. One example is the cascode circuit
shown in Figure 10.7(a). In this case, if the transistors are matched, then the load and
reference currents are essentially equal.
We may calculate the output resistance Ro by considering the small-signal
equivalent transistor circuits. For a constant reference current, the base voltages
of Q2 and Q4 are constant, which implies these terminals are at signal ground.

The equivalent circuit is then shown in Figure 10.7(b). Since gm2Vbe2 = 0, then
Vbe4 = −Ix(ro2∥rπ4). Summing currents at the output node yields
Ix = gm4Vbe4 +

Combining terms and assuming rπ4 ≪ro2, we ﬁnd
Ro = Vx
Ix

(10.20)
The output resistance has increased by a factor of β compared to the two-transistor
current source, which increases the stability of the current source with changes in
output voltage.
Wilson Current Source
Another conﬁguration of a three-transistor current source, called a Wilson current
source, is shown in Figure 10.8. This circuit also has a large output resistance. Our
analysis again assumes identical transistors, with IB1 = IB2 and IC1 = IC2. The
current levels in all three transistors are nearly the same; therefore, we can assume
that the current gains of the three transistors are equal. Nodal equations at the collec-
tor of Q1 and the emitter of Q3 yield
IREF = IC1 + IB3

and
IE3 = IC2 + 2IB2 = IC2

Rearranging terms, we can solve for the output current,

(10.25)
This current relationship is essentially the same as that of the previous three-
transistor current source.
The difference between the two three-transistor current-source circuits is the
output resistance. In the Wilson current source, the output resistance looking into the
collector of Q3 is Ro ∼= βro3/2, which is approximately a factor β/2 larger than that
of either the two-transistor source or the basic three-transistor source. This means
that, in the Wilson current source, the change in bias current IO with a change in out-
put collector voltage is much smaller.
Output Voltage Swing
If we consider the equivalent circuit in Figure 10.3, we see that the maximum possi-
ble swing in the output voltage is a function of the minimum possible collector–
emitter voltage of Q2. For the two-transistor current source in this ﬁgure, the
minimum value of VC E2 = VC E(sat), which may be on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 V.
For the cascode and Wilson current sources, the minimum output voltage is
VBE + VC E(sat) above the negative power supply voltage, which may be on the
order of 0.7 to 0.9 V. For circuits biased at ±5 V, for example, this increased mini-
mum voltage may not be a serious problem. However, as the voltages decrease in
low-power circuits, this minimum voltage effect may become more serious.
Problem-Solving Technique: BJT Current Source Circuits
1.
Sum currents at the various nodes in the circuit to ﬁnd the relation between
the reference current and the bias current.
2.
To ﬁnd the output resistance of the current source circuit, place a test voltage
at the output node and analyze the small-signal equivalent circuit. Keep in
mind that the reference current is a constant, which may make some of the
base voltages constant or at ac ground.
Widlar Current Source
In the current-source circuits considered thus far, the load and reference currents
have been nearly equal. For a two-transistor current source, such as that shown in
Figure 10.2(a), if we require a load current of IO = 10 μA, then, for V + = 5 V and
V −= −5 V, the required resistance value is
R1 = V + −VBE −V −
IREF
∼= 5 −0.7 −(−5)
10 × 10−6
= 930 k
In ICs, resistors on the order of 1 M require large areas and are difﬁcult to fabricate
accurately. We therefore need to limit IC resistor values to the low kilohm range.
10.1.3

Chapter 10 Integrated Circuit Biasing and Active Loads
699
The transistor circuit in Figure 10.9, called a Widlar current source, meets this
objective. A voltage difference is produced across resistor RE, so that the B–E volt-
age of Q2 is less than the B–E voltage of Q1. A smaller B–E voltage produces a
smaller collector current, which in turn means that the load current IO is less than the
reference current IREF.
Current Relationship
If β ≫1 for Q1 and Q2, and if the two transistors are identical, then
IREF ∼= IC1 = ISeVBE1/VT
(10.26(a))
and
IO = IC2 = ISeVBE2/VT

DESIGN EXAMPLE 10.4
Objective: Design a Widlar current source to achieve speciﬁed reference and load
currents.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit to be designed has the conﬁguration shown in Figure 10.9.
Assume bias voltages of V + = +5 V and V −= −5 V. Assume VBE1 = 0.7 V. De-
sign the circuit such that IREF = 1 mA and IO = 12 μA.
Choices: Assume that matched transistors are available and that base currents can be
neglected. Also assume that IC resistors of any value can be fabricated.

From Equation (10.29), we can determine the difference between the two B–E volt-
ages, as follows:
VBE1 −VBE2 = IO RE = (12 × 10−6)(9.58 × 103) = 0.115 V
Trade-offs: A slight variation in VBE1 and slight tolerance variations in resistor
values will change the current values slightly. These effects are evaluated in end-of-
chapter problems.
Comment: A difference of 115 mV in the B–E voltages of Q1 and Q2 produces
approximately two orders of magnitude difference between the reference and load
currents. Therefore, we can produce a very low bias current using resistors in the
low kilohm range. These resistors can easily be fabricated in an IC. Including the
resistor RE gives the designer additional versatility in adjusting the load to reference
current ratio.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.4: Consider the Widlar current source in Figure 10.9. The bias voltages are
V + = 3 V and V −= −3 V. Design the circuit such that IO = 20 μA and
IREF = 100 μA. Assume VBE1 = 0.6 V and VA = ∞, and neglect base currents.
Determine R1, RE, and VBE2. (Ans. R1 = 54 k, RE = 2.09 k, VBE2 = 0.558 V)
In our analysis of constant-current source circuits, we have assumed a piecewise
linear approximation for the B–E voltage, VBE(on). However, in the Widlar current
source and other current-source circuits, the piecewise linear approximation is not
adequate, since the B–E voltages are not all equal. With the exponential relationship
between collector current and base–emitter voltage, as shown in Equations (10.26(a))
and (10.26(b)), a small change in B–E voltage produces a large change in collector
current. To take this variation into account, either the reverse-biased saturation
current IS or the B–E voltage at a particular collector current must be known.
Also in our analysis, we have assumed that the temperatures of all transistors are
equal. Maintaining equal temperatures is important for proper circuit operation.

EXAMPLE 10.5
Objective: To determine the currents in a Widlar current source circuit.
Assume the Widlar source is biased at V + = +5 V and V −= −5 V, and assume

Solution: The reference current is found to be
IREF = V + −VBE1 −V −

A transcendental equation cannot be solved directly. A computer solution or a trial
and error solution yields
IO ∼= 25.7 μA
Comment: In this case, the difference between the two base–emitter voltages is
IO RE ∼= 103 mV. Again, a relatively small difference in the two base–emitter volt-
ages can produce a relatively large difference between the reference and load currents.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.5: Consider the circuit in Figure 10.10. Assume the reference current is
IREF = 120 μA and assume the transistor parameters are IS1 = IS2 = 2 × 10−16 A.
Neglect base currents. (a) Find VBE1. (b) If IO = 50 μA, determine VBE2 and RE.

(b) RE = 455 , VBE2 = 0.6824 V; (c) IO = 40.4 μA, VBE2 = 0.6768 V)

in Figure 10.9 can be expressed as

where Ro is the output resistance looking into the collector of Q2. This output resis-
tance can be determined by using the small-signal equivalent circuit in Figure 10.11(a).
(Again, we use the phasor notation in small-signal analyses.) The base, collector, and
emitter terminals of each transistor are indicated on the ﬁgure.
First, we calculate the resistance Ro1 looking into the base of Q1. Writing a KCL

ro1 = ∞. For these conditions, Ro1 ∼= 0.026 k = 26 . For a load current of
IO = 12 μA, we ﬁnd rπ2 = 217 k. Resistance Ro1 is in series with rπ2, and since
Ro1 ≪rπ2, we can neglect the effect of Ro1, which means that the base of Q2 is
essentially at signal ground.
Now we determine the output resistance at the collector of Q2, using the simpli-
ﬁed equivalent circuit in Figure 10.11(b). The Norton equivalent of the current
source gm2Vπ2 and resistance ro2 can be transformed into a Thevenin equivalent
circuit, as shown in Figure 10.11(c). Resistances rπ2 and RE are in parallel; therefore,
we deﬁne R′

EXAMPLE 10.6
Objective: Determine the change in load current with a change in collector voltage
in a Widlar current source.
Consider the circuit in Figure 10.9. The parameters are: V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V,
R1 = 9.3 k, and RE = 9.58 k. Let VA = 80 V and β = 100. Determine the
change in IO as VC2 changes by 4 V.

The output resistance of the circuit is

age, is improved in the Widlar current source, compared to the simple two-transistor

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.6: A Widlar current source is shown in Figure 10.9. The parameters are:
V + = 5 V, V −= 0, IREF = 0.70 mA, and IO = 25 μA at VC2 = 1 V. The tran-
sistor parameters are: β = 150, VBE1(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 100 V. Determine
the change in IO when VC2 changes from 1 V to 4 V. (Ans. dIO = 0.176 μA)
Multitransistor Current Mirrors
In the previous current sources, we established a reference current and one load
current. In the two-transistor current source in Figure 10.2(a), the B–E junction of the
diode-connected transistor Q1 is forward biased when the bias voltages V + and V −
are applied. Once VBE is established, the voltage is applied to the B–E junction of Q2,
which turns Q2 on and produces the load current IO.
The B–E voltage of Q1 can also be applied to additional transistors, to generate
multiple load currents. Consider the circuit in Figure 10.12. Transistor QR, which is
the reference transistor, is connected as a diode. The resulting B–E voltage of QR,
established by IREF, is applied to N output transistors, creating N load currents. The
relationship between each load current and the reference current, assuming all
transistors are matched and VA = ∞, is

The collectors of multiple output transistors can be connected together, chang-
ing the load current versus reference current relationship. As an example, the circuit
in Figure 10.13 has three output transistors with common collectors and a load
current IO. We assume that transistors QR, Q1, Q2, and Q3 are all matched. If the
current gain β is very large, the base currents can be neglected, I1 = I2 = I3 = IREF,
and the load current is IO = 3IREF. [Note: This process is not recommended for
discrete devices, since a mismatch between devices will generally cause one device
to carry more current than the other devices.]
Connecting transistors in parallel increases the effective B–E area of the device.
In actual IC fabrication, the B–E area would be doubled or tripled to provide a load
current twice or three times the value of IREF.

Figure 10.15 Generalized current mirror
Rather than drawing each set of parallel output transistors, we can use the circuit
symbols in Figure 10.14. Figure 10.14(a) is the equivalent symbol for two transis-
tors connected in parallel, Figure 10.14(b) is for three transistors in parallel, and
Figure 10.14(c) is for N transistors in parallel. Although the transistors appear to
be multiemitter devices, we are simply indicating devices with different B–E junc-
tion areas.
Ageneralized current mirror is shown in Figure 10.15. We can use pnp transistors
to establish the load currents, as shown in the ﬁgure. Transistors QR1 and QR2 are
connected as diodes. The reference current is established in the branch of the circuit
that has the diode-connected transistors, resistor R1, and bias voltages, and is given by
IREF = V + −VE B(Q R1) −VBE(Q R2) −V −
R1
(10.39)
If β for each transistor is very large, the base current effects can be neglected.
Then the load current IO1 generated by output transistor Q1 is equal to IREF. Likewise,
Q3 generates a load current IO3 equal to IREF. Implicitly, all transistors are identi-
cal, all load transistors are biased in their forward-active region, and all transistor
Early voltages are inﬁnite. Transistor Q2 is effectively two transistors in parallel;
then, since all transistors are identical, IO2 = 2IREF. Similarly, Q4 is effectively
three transistors connected in parallel, which means that the load current is
IO4 = 3IREF.
In the above discussion, we neglected the effect of base currents. However, a
ﬁnite β causes the collector currents in each load transistor to be smaller than IREF
since the reference current supplies all base currents. This effect becomes more
severe as more load transistors are added.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 10.7
Objective: Design a generalized current mirror to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit to be designed has the conﬁguration shown in Fig-
ure 10.15. The bias voltages are V + = +5 V and V −= −5 V. Neglect base currents
and assume VBE = VE B = 0.6 V. Design the circuit such that IO2 = 400 μA. Deter-
mine the other currents and ﬁnd the value for R1.
Solution: For IO2 = 400 μA, we have
IREF = IO1 = IO3 = 200 μA
and
IO4 = 600 μA
Resistor R1 is
R1 = V + −VE B(Q R1) −VBE(Q R2) −V −
IREF
= 5 −0.6 −0.6 −(−5)
0.2
or
R1 = 44 k
Trade-offs: Base currents were neglected in this ideal design. Including the effects
of base currents (a ﬁnite β) will change the current and resistor values slightly.
Comment: If the load and reference currents are to be within a factor of approxi-
mately four of each other, it is more efﬁcient, from an IC point of view, to adjust the
B–E areas of the transistors to achieve the speciﬁed currents rather than use the
Widlar current source with its additional resistors.
Design Pointer: This example demonstrates that a single reference current can be
used to induce multiple load currents, which can be used to bias various stages of a
complex circuit. We will see speciﬁc examples of this technique in Chapter 13 when
we consider actual operational ampliﬁer circuits.

FET CURRENT SOURCES
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of various
MOSFET (and a few JFET) circuits used to provide a constant output
current.
Field-effect transistor integrated circuits are biased with current sources in much the
same way as bipolar circuits. We will examine the relationship between the reference
and load currents, and will determine the output impedance of the basic two-transistor
MOSFET current source. We will then analyze multi-MOSFET current-source cir-
cuits to determine reference and load current relationships and output impedance.
Finally, we will discuss JFET constant-current source circuits.
Basic Two-Transistor MOSFET Current Source
Current Relationship
Figure 10.16 shows a basic two-transistor NMOS current source. The drain and
source terminals of the enhancement-mode transistor M1 are connected, which
means that M1 is always biased in the saturation region. Assuming λ = 0, we can
write the reference current as
IREF = Kn1(VGS −VT N1)2

For the drain current to be independent of the drain-to-source voltage (for
λ = 0), transistor M2 should always be biased in the saturation region. The load
current is then
IO = Kn2(VGS −VT N2)2
(10.42)
Substituting Equation (10.41) into (10.42), we have
IO = Kn2

If M1 and M2 are identical transistors, then VT N1 = VT N2 and Kn1 = Kn2, and Equa-
tion (10.43) becomes
IO = IREF
(10.44)
Since there are no gate currents in MOSFETs, the induced load current is identi-
cal to the reference current, provided the two transistors are matched. The relationship
between the load current and the reference current changes if the width-to-length
ratios, or aspect ratios, of the two transistors change.
If the transistors are matched except for the aspect ratios, we ﬁnd
IO = (W/L)2
(W/L)1
· IREF
(10.45)
The ratio between the load and reference currents is directly proportional to the
aspect ratios and gives designers versatility in their circuit designs.
Output Resistance
The stability of the load current as a function of the drain-to-source voltage is an im-
portant consideration in many applications. The drain current versus drain-to-source
voltage is similar to the bipolar characteristic shown in Figure 10.4. Taking into ac-
count the ﬁnite output resistance of the transistors, we can write the load and refer-
ence currents as follows:
IO = Kn2(VGS −VT N2)2(1 + λ2VDS2)
(10.46(a))
and
IREF = Kn1(VGS −VT N1)2(1 + λ1VDS1)
(10.46(b))
Since transistors in the current mirror are processed on the same integrated
circuit, all physical parameters, such as VTN, μn, Cox, and λ, are essentially identical
for both devices. Therefore, taking the ratio of IO to IREF, we have
IO
IREF
= (W/L)2
(W/L)1
· (1 + λVDS2)
(1 + λVDS1)
(10.47)
Equation (10.47) again shows that the ratio IO/IREF is a function of the aspect
ratios, which is controlled by the designer, and it is also a function of λ and VDS2.
As before, the stability of the load current can be described in terms of the out-
put resistance. Note from the circuit in Figure 10.16 that VDS1 = VGS1 = constant for
a given reference current. Normally, λVDS1 = λVGS1 ≪1, and if (W/L)2 = (W/L)1,
then the change in bias current with respect to a change in VDS2 is

where ro is the output resistance of the transistor. As we found with bipolar current-
source circuits, MOSFET current sources require a large output resistance for excel-
lent stability.
Reference Current
The reference current in bipolar current-source circuits is generally established by
the bias voltages and a resistor. Since MOSFETs can be conﬁgured to act like a
resistor, the reference current in MOSFET current mirrors is usually established by
using additional transistors.
Consider the current mirror shown in Figure 10.17. Transistors M1 and M3 are in
series; assuming λ = 0, we can write,

Trade-offs: As with other designs, slight variations in transistor parameters (k′

exercise TYU 10.5.
Comment: In this design, the output transistor remains biased in the saturation
region for
VDS > VDS(sat) = VGS −VT N = 0.8 −0.4 = 0.4 V
Design Pointer: As with most design problems, there is not a unique solution.
The general design criterion was that M2 was biased in the saturation region over a
wide range of VDS2 values. Letting VGS2 = 0.8 V was somewhat arbitrary. If VGS2
were smaller, the width-to-length ratios of M1 and M2 would need to be larger. Larger
values of VGS2 would result in smaller width-to-length ratios.
The value of VGS3 is the difference between the bias voltage and VGS1. If VGS3
becomes too large, the ratio (W/L)3 will become unreasonably small (much less
than 1). Two or more transistors in series can be used in place of M3 to divide the
voltage in order to provide reasonable W/L ratios (see end-of-chapter problems).

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.8: For the circuit shown in Figure 10.17, the bias voltages are V + = 1.8 V and
V −= −1.8 V, and the transistor parameters are VT N = 0.4 V, k′

and λ = 0. Design the circuit such that IREF = 0.5 mA and IO = 0.1 mA, and that
M2
remains biased in the saturation region for VDS2 ≥0.4 V. (Ans.
(W/L)1 = 62.5, (W/L)2 = 12.5, (W/L)3 = 1.74)
Problem-Solving Technique: MOSFET Current-Source Circuit
1.
Analyze the reference side of the circuit to determine gate-to-source voltages.
Using these gate-to-source voltages, determine the bias current in terms of
the reference current.
2.
To ﬁnd the output resistance of the current source circuit, place a test voltage
at the output node and analyze the small-signal equivalent circuit. Keep in
mind that the reference current is a constant, which may make some of the
gate voltages constant or at ac ground.
Multi-MOSFET Current-Source Circuits
Cascode Current Mirror
In MOSFET current-source circuits, the output resistance is a measure of the stability
with respect to changes in the output voltage. This output resistance can be increased
by modifying the circuit, as shown in Figure 10.18, which is a cascode current
mirror. The reference current is established by including another MOSFET in the
reference branch of the circuit as was done in the basic two-transistor current mirror.
Assuming all transistors are identical, then IO = IREF.
To determine the output resistance at the drain of M4, we use the small-signal
equivalent circuit. Since IREF is a constant, the gate voltages to M1 and M3, and
hence to M2 and M4, are constant. This is equivalent to an ac short circuit. The ac
equivalent circuit for calculating the output resistance is shown in Figure 10.19(a).

The small-signal equivalent circuit is given in Figure 10.19(b). The small-signal
resistance looking into the drain of M2 is rO2.
Writing a KCL equation, in phasor form, at the output node, we have
Ix = gmVgs4 + Vx −(−Vgs4)

Ix + gmro2Ix = Vx
ro4
(10.56)
The output resistance is then
Ro = Vx
Ix

(10.57)
Normally, gmro4 ≫1, which implies that the output resistance of this cascode
conﬁguration is much larger than that of the basic two-transistor current source.
EXAMPLE 10.9
Objective: Compare the output resistance of the cascode MOSFET current source to
that of the two-transistor current source.
Consider the two-transistor current source in Figure 10.17 and the cascode
current source in Figure 10.18. Assume IREF = IO = 100 μA in both circuits, λ =
0.01 V−1 for all transistors, and gm = 0.5 mA/V.
Solution: The output resistance of the two-transistor current source is, from Equa-
tion (10.48(b)),
ro =
1
λIREF
=
1
(0.01)(0.10) ⇒1 M
For the cascode circuit, we have ro2 = ro4 = 1 M. Therefore, the output resistance
of the cascode circuit is, from Equation (10.57),
Ro = ro4 + ro2(1 + gmro4) = 1 + (1)[1 + (0.5 × 10−3)(106)]
or
Ro = 502 M
Comment: The output resistance of the cascode current source is substantially
larger than that of the basic two-transistor circuit. Since dIO ∝1/Ro, the load
current in the cascode circuit is more stable against variations in output voltage.
Design Pointer: Achieving the output resistance of 502 M assumes the transistors
are ideal. In fact, small leakage currents will begin to be a factor in actual output
resistance values, so a value of 502 M may not be achieved in reality.

transistors are identical, with parameters: VT N = 1 V, Kn = 80 μA/V2, and λ =

Wilson Current Mirror
Two additional multi-MOSFET current sources are shown in Figures 10.20(a) and
10.20(b). The circuit in Figure 10.20(a) is the Wilson current source. Note that the
VDS values of M1 and M2 are not equal. Since λ is not zero, the ratio IO/IREF is slightly
different from the aspect ratios. This problem is solved in the modiﬁed Wilson
current source, shown in Figure 10.20(b), which includes transistor M4. For a con-
stant reference current, the drain-to-source voltages of M1, M2, and M4 are held
constant. The primary advantage of these circuits is the increase in output resistance,
which further stabilizes the load current.

If we consider the cascode current mirror in Figure 10.18, we can determine the min-
imum value of VD4, which will inﬂuence the maximum symmetrical swing of the
voltage in the load circuit being biased. The gate voltage of M4 is
VG4 = V −+ VGS1 + VGS3

Assuming matched transistors, VGS1 = VGS2 = VGS4 ≡VGS. We then ﬁnd
VD4(min) = V −+ (VGS + VDS4(sat))
(10.60)

Part 2
Analog Electronics
In considering the simple two-transistor current mirror, the minimum output volt-
age is
VO(min) = V −+ VDS(sat)
(10.61)
If, for example, VGS = 0.75 V and VT N = 0.50 V, then from Equation (10.60),
VD4(min) = 1.0 V above V −, and from Equation (10.61), VO(min) is only 0.25 V
above V −. For bias voltages in the range of ±3.5 V, this additional required voltage
across the output of the cascode current mirror can have a signiﬁcant effect on the
output of the load circuit.
One current mirror circuit that does not limit the output voltage swing as
severely as the cascode circuit, but retains the high output resistance, is shown in Fig-
ure 10.21. Width-to-length ratios of the transistors are shown. Otherwise, the transis-
tors are assumed to be identical.

The transistor pair M3 and M4 acts like a single diode-connected transistor in
creating the gate voltage for M3. By including M4, the drain-to-source voltage of M3
is reduced and is matched to the drain-to-source voltage of M2. Since M5 is one-
fourth the size of M1−M4 and since all drain currents are equal, we have
(VGS5 −VT N) = 2(VGSi −VT N)
(10.62)
where VGSi corresponds to the gate-to-source voltage of M1 −M4.
The voltage at the gate of M1 is
VG1 = VGS5 = (VGS5 −VT N) + VT N
(10.63)
The minimum output voltage at the drain of M1 is
VD1(min) = VG1 −VGS1 + VDS1(sat)
= [(VGS5 −VT N) + VT N] −VGS1 + (VGS1 −VT N)
(10.64)
or
VD1(min) = VGS5 −VT N = 2(VGSi −VT N) = 2VDSi(sat)
(10.65)
If we have VGSi = 0.75 V and VT N = 0.5 V, then VD1(min) = 0.50 V, which is one-
half the value for the cascode circuit. At the same time, the high output resistance is
maintained.

Discussion: In the ideal circuit design in Figure 10.21, the transistors M3 and M4 are
biased exactly at the transition point between the saturation and non-saturation regions.
The analysis has neglected the body effect, so threshold voltages will not be exactly
equal. In an actual circuit design, therefore, the size of M5 will be made slightly smaller
to ensure transistors are biased in the saturation region. This design change then means
that the minimum output voltage increases by perhaps 0.1 to 0.15 V.
Bias-Independent Current Source
In all of the current mirror circuits considered up to this point (both BJT and MOSFET),
the reference current is a function of the applied supply voltages. This implies that
the load current is also a function of the supply voltages. In most cases, the supply
voltage dependence is undesirable. Circuit designs exist in which the load currents
are essentially independent of the bias. One such MOSFET circuit is shown in Fig-
ure 10.22. The width-to-length ratios are given.

This value of resistance R will establish the drain currents ID1 = ID2. These currents

Analog Electronics
These voltages, in turn, can be applied to M5 and M6 to establish load currents IO1
and IO2.
The currents ID1 and ID2 are independent of the supply voltages V + and V −as
long as M2 and M3 are biased in the saturation region. As the difference, V + −V −,
increases, the values of VDS2 and VSD3 increase but the currents remain essentially
constant.
Similar bipolar bias-independent current mirror designs exist, but will not be
covered here.
JFET Current Sources
Current sources are also fundamental elements in JFET integrated circuits. The simplest
method of forming a current source is to connect the gate and source terminals of a
depletion-mode JFET, as shown in Figure 10.23 for an n-channel device. The device
will remain biased in the saturation region as long as
vDS ≥vDS(sat) = vGS −VP = |VP|
(10.69)
In the saturation region, the current is
iD = IDSS

The output resistance looking into the drain is, from Equation (10.70),

(10.71)
This expression for the output resistance of a JFET current source is the same as
that of the MOSFET current source.
EXAMPLE 10.10
Objective: Determine the currents and voltages in a simple JFET circuit biased with
a constant-current source.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.24. The transistor parameters are:
IDSS1 = 2 mA, IDSS2 = 1 mA, VP1 = VP2 = −1.5 V, and λ1 = λ2 = 0.05 V−1.
Determine the minimum values of VS and VI such that Q2 is biased in the saturation
region. What is the value of IO?
Solution: In order for Q2 to remain biased in the saturation region, we must have
vDS ≥|VP| = 1.5 V, from Equation (10.69). The minimum value of VS is then
VS(min) −V −= vDS(min) = 1.5 V
or
VS(min) = 1.5 + V −= 1.5 + (−5) = −3.5 V
From Equation (10.70), the output current is
iD = IO = IDSS2(1 + λvDS) = (1)[1 + (0.05)(1.5)] = 1.08 mA

As a ﬁrst approximation in calculating the minimum value of VI, we neglect the
effect of λ in transistor Q1. Then, assuming Q1 is biased in the saturation region, we

We see that
vGS1 = −0.40 V = VI −VS = VI −(−3.5)
or
VI = −3.90 V
Comment: Since Q1 is an n-channel device, the voltage at the gate is negative with
respect to the source.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 10.10: Consider the JFET circuit in Figure 10.24. The transistor parameters
are: IDSS2 = 0.5 mA, IDSS1 = 0.8 mA, VP1 = VP2 = −2 V, and λ1 = λ2 =
0.15 V−1. Determine the minimum values of VS and VI such that Q2 is biased in
the saturation region. What is the value of IO? What is the output impedance look-
ing into the drain of Q2? (Ans. VS(min) = −3 V, IO = 0.65 mA, VI(min) =
−3.2 V, ro = 1.09 k)
The output resistance of a JFET current source can be increased by using a cas-
code conﬁguration. A simple JFET cascode current source with two n-channel
depletion-mode devices is shown in Figure 10.25. The current–voltage relationship,
assuming Q1 and Q2 are identical, is given by
iD = IDSS(1 + λvDS1) = IDSS


(10.72)
From the circuit, we see that vGS2 = −vDS1. We deﬁne
VDS = vDS1 + vDS2
(10.73(a))
so that
vDS2 = VDS −vDS1
(10.73(b))
From Equation (10.72), we obtain
(1 + λvDS1) =

1 + vDS1

[1 + λ(VDS −vDS1)]
(10.74)
For a given application, the value of VDS will usually be known, and the value
of vDS1 can then be determined. The load current iD can then be calculated by using
Equation (10.72).

We can determine the output resistance by using the small-signal equivalent
circuit of the composite two-transistor conﬁguration, as shown in Figure 10.26(a),
which includes the phasor variables. Since the gate and source of Q1 are connected
together, the small-signal voltage Vgs1 is zero, which means that the dependent
current source gmVgs1 is zero. This corresponds to an open circuit. Figure 10.26(b)
shows the ﬁnal conﬁguration.
The analysis is the same as for the MOSFET cascode circuit in Figure 10.19.
Writing a KCL equation at the output node, we have
Ix = gmVgs2 + Vx −(−Vgs2)

From Equation (10.78), we see that the output resistance relationship for the
JFET cascode current source has the same form as that of the MOSFET cascode
current source.

CIRCUITS WITH ACTIVE LOADS
Objective: • Analyze the dc characteristics of ampliﬁer circuits using
transistors as load devices (active loads).
In bipolar ampliﬁers, such as that shown in Figure 10.28, the small-signal voltage
gain is directly proportional to the collector resistor RC. To increase the gain, we need
to increase the value of RC, but there is a practical limitation. We can show that the
voltage gain (assuming CC acts as a short circuit to the signal frequency) of this
circuit is given by
Av = −gm RC

Assuming the Q-point is in the center of the load line, then
IC Q = VCC
2RC
or
RC = VCC
2IC Q
Substituting into the voltage gain expression, we have
|Av| = VCC
2VT
So for reasonable values of bias voltage, the maximum value of small-signal voltage
gain is essentially ﬁxed.
To get around this limitation, we need a load device that will pass a given current
at a given bias voltage, but which will incrementally resist a change in current better
than the ﬁxed RC. This load device can be a transistor, which will also occupy less
area in an integrated circuit, another advantage of using transistors in place of resis-
tors. In addition, active loads produce a much larger small-signal voltage gain than
discrete resistors, as discussed in Chapter 6.
In Chapter 4, we introduced NMOS enhancement load and depletion load
devices in MOSFET ampliﬁers. This was an introduction to active load devices. In
this section, we consider the dc analysis of a bipolar active load in a simple BJT
circuit and then the dc analysis of a MOSFET active load. Our discussion will
include the voltage gains of these active load circuits. The small-signal analysis of
active load circuits is covered in the next section.
The discussion of active loads here can be considered an introduction. The use
of active loads with differential ampliﬁers is considered in detail in the next chapter.
DC Analysis: BJT Active Load Circuit
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.29. The elements R1, Q1, and Q2 form the
active load circuit, and Q2 is referred to as the active load device for driver transis-
tor Q0. The combination of R1, Q1, and Q2 forms the pnp version of the two-transistor

current mirror. For the dc analysis of this circuit, we will use the dc symbols for the
currents and voltages. The objective of this analysis is to obtain the voltage transfer
function VO versus VI.
The B–E voltage of Q0 is the dc input voltage VI; therefore, the collector current
in Q0 is
IC0 = IS0[eVI /VT ]

1 + VC E0
VAN

(10.79)
where IS0 is the reverse-saturation current, VT is the thermal voltage, and VAN is the
Early voltage of the npn transistor. Similarly, the collector current in Q2 is
IC2 = IS2[eVE B2/VT ]

1 + VEC2
VAP

(10.80)
where VAP is the Early voltage of the pnp transistors.
If we neglect base currents, then
IREF = IC1 = IS1[eVE B1/VT ]

1 + VEC1
VAP

(10.81)
Assuming Q1 and Q2 are identical, then IS1 = IS2 and the Early voltages of
the pnp transistors are equal. Also note that VEC1 = VE B1 = VE B2. We can also as-
sume that VC E ≪VAN and VEC ≪VAP. Combining equations, we ﬁnd the output
voltage is given as

(10.82)
Equation (10.82) is valid as long as Q0 and Q2 remain biased in the forward-active
region, which means that the output voltage must remain in the range
VC E0(sat) < VO < (V + −VEC2(sat))
(10.83)
A sketch of VO versus VI is shown in Figure 10.30. If the circuit is to be used as
a small-signal ampliﬁer, a Q-point must be established, as indicated in the ﬁgure, for
maximum symmetrical swing. Because of the exponential input voltage function, as
given in Equation (10.82), the input voltage range over which both Q0 and Q2 remain
in their active regions is very small. A sinusoidal variation in the input voltage
produces a sinusoidal variation in the output voltage as shown in the ﬁgure.

In addition to the voltage transfer function, we can also consider the load curve.
Figure 10.31 shows the transistor characteristics of the driver transistor Q0 for sev-
eral values of B–E or VI voltages. Superimposed on these curves is the load curve,
which essentially is the IC versus VEC characteristic of the active load Q2 at a con-
stant VE B voltage.
The Q-point shown corresponds to a quiescent input voltage VI Q. From the
curve, we see that as the input changes between VI H and VI L, the Q-point moves up
and down the load curve producing a change in output voltage. Also, as VI increases
to VI2, the driver transistor Q0 is driven into saturation; as VI decreases to VI1, the
load transistor Q2 is driven into saturation.
Voltage Gain: BJT Active Load Circuit
The small-signal voltage gain of a circuit is the slope of the voltage transfer function
curve at the Q-point. For the bipolar circuit with an active load, the voltage gain can
be found by taking the derivative of Equation (10.82) with respect to VI, as follows:

The small-signal voltage gain is a function of the Early voltages and the thermal
voltage. The voltage gain, given by Equation (10.86), relates to the open-circuit
condition. When a load is connected to the output, the voltage gain is degraded, as we
will see in the next section.

Comment: For a circuit with an active load, the magnitude of the small-signal,
open-circuit voltage gain is substantially larger than the resulting gain when a
discrete resistor load is used.
Computer Veriﬁcation: The voltage transfer characteristics of the active load circuit
in Figure 10.29 were determined for a standard 2N3904 transistor as the npn device
and standard 2N3906 transistors as the pnp devices. The circuit was biased at 5 V and
the resistor was set at R = 1k. The transfer curve is shown in Figure 10.32.

The input transition region, during which both Q0 and Q2 remain biased in the
forward-active mode, is indeed very narrow. The slope of the curve, which is the
voltage gain, is found to be −572. The reason for the smaller value compared to
the hand calculation is that the Early voltages of these standard transistors are smaller
than assumed in the previous calculation. The Early voltage of the npn device is 74 V
and that of the pnp devices is only 18.7 V.
Design Pointer: From the transfer characteristics in Figure 10.32, we can see that, for
this circuit, it would be very difﬁcult to apply the required input voltage to bias both
Q0 and Q2 in the active region. This particular circuit, therefore, is not practical as an
ampliﬁer. However, the circuit does demonstrate the basic properties of an active load.
In Chapters 11 and 13, we will see how an active load is applied to actual circuits.

DC Analysis: MOSFET Active Load Circuit
Consider the circuit in Figure 10.33. Transistors M1 and M2 form a PMOS active load
circuit, and M2 is the active load device. We will consider the voltage transfer func-
tion of VO versus VI for this circuit.
The reference current may be written in the form
IREF = Kp1(VSG + VT P1)2(1 + λ1VSD1)
(10.87)
The drain current I2 is
I2 = Kp2 (VSG + VT P2)2 (1 + λ2 VSD2)
(10.88)
If we assume that M1 and M2 are identical, then λ1 = λ2 ≡λp, VT P1 =

Equation (10.89) describes that VO versus VI characteristic of the circuit, provided
that both M0 and M2 remain biased in their saturation regions. Figure 10.34 shows a
sketch of the voltage transfer characteristics. If the circuit is to be used as a small-signal

symmetrical swing. As before, the input transition region in which both M0 and M2 are

biased in the saturation region is quite narrow. Asinusoidal variation in the input voltage
produces a sinusoidal variation in the output voltage as shown in the ﬁgure.
We can also consider the load curve for this device. Figure 10.35 shows the tran-
sistor characteristics of the driver transistor M0 for several values of gate-to-source or
VI voltages. Superimposed on these curves is the load curve, which essentially is the
ID versus VSD characteristic of the active load M2 at a constant VSG voltage.
The Q-point shown corresponds to a quiescent input voltage VIQ. From the
curve, we see that as the input changes between VI H and VI L, the Q-point moves up
and down the load curve producing a change in output voltage. Also, as VI increases
to VI2, the driver transistor M0 is driven into the nonsaturation region; as VI decreases
to VI1, the load transistor M2 is driven into the non-saturation region.
Voltage Gain: MOSFET Active Load Circuit
The small-signal voltage gain of a MOSFET circuit with an active load is also the
slope of the voltage transfer function curve at the Q-point. Taking the derivative of
Equation (10.89) with respect to VI, we obtain
Av = dVO
dVI
= −2Kn(VI −VT N)
IREF(λn + λp)
(10.90)
The transconductance of the driver transistor is gm = 2Kn(VI −VT N). Since M1
and M2 are assumed to be identical, then IO = IREF, and the small-signal transistor
resistances are ron = 1/λn IREF and rop = 1/λpIREF. From Equation (10.90), the
small-signal, open-circuit voltage gain can now be written
Av =
−gm
 1
ron
+ 1
rop
 = −gm(ron∥rop)
(10.91)
In general, the transconductance gm of a MOSFET is less than that of a BJT;
therefore, the voltage gain of a MOSFET ampliﬁer with an active load is less than
that of a BJT ampliﬁer with an active load. However, the active load still produces a
signiﬁcant increase in the voltage gain.

Discussion
In considering the BJT circuit with active load (Figure 10.29) and MOSFET circuit
with active load (Figure 10.33), we could have directly considered the small-signal
analysis without the dc analysis. However, it is important to understand how nar-
row the input transition width is (Figure 10.32) such that the transistors are biased
correctly. For this reason, the use of active loads in discrete circuits is almost im-
possible. The biasing of the circuit with an active load depends to a large extent on
the use of matched transistors. Matched transistors can be achieved on an inte-
grated circuit. So in considering the small-signal analysis in the next section, we
must keep in mind the very narrow range in which the transistors are biased in the
active region.

SMALL-SIGNAL ANALYSIS: 
ACTIVE LOAD CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze the small-signal characteristics of ampliﬁer
circuits with active loads.
The small-signal voltage gain of a circuit with an active load can be determined from
the small-signal equivalent circuit. This is probably the easiest and most direct
method of obtaining the gain of such circuits. Again, the dc analysis of these circuits,
as shown in the previous section, clearly demonstrates the narrow range of input
voltages over which the transistors will remain biased in the active region. The load
curves in Figure 10.31 for the BJT circuit and in Figure 10.35 for the MOSFET
circuit also help in visualizing the operation of these circuits. Even though a small-
signal analysis is extremely useful for determining the voltage gain, we must not lose
sight of the physical operation of these circuits, which is described through the dc
analysis. If the BJTs are not biased in the active region or the MOSFETs are not
biased in the saturation region, the small-signal analysis is not valid.

Small-Signal Analysis: BJT Active Load Circuit
To ﬁnd the small-signal voltage gain of the BJT circuit with an active load, we
must determine the resistance looking into the collector of the active load device.
Figure 10.36 is the small-signal equivalent circuit of the entire active load circuit in
Figure 10.29, which uses pnp transistors. The base, collector, and emitter terminals
of the two transistors are indicated on the ﬁgure.

Figure 10.37 (a) Simple BJT ampliﬁer with active load and load resistance and (b) small-
signal equivalent circuit
In the Q1 portion of the equivalent circuit, there are no independent ac sources to
excite any currents or voltages. Therefore, Vπ1 = Vπ2 = 0, which means that the de-
pendent source gmVπ2 is zero and is equivalent to an open circuit. The resistance
looking into the collector of Q2 is just
Ro = ro2
(10.92)
We will use this equivalent resistance to calculate the small-signal voltage gain of the
ampliﬁer.
Figure 10.37(a) shows a simple ampliﬁer with an active load and the output volt-
age capacitively coupled to passive load RL. The small-signal equivalent circuit,
shown in Figure 10.37(b), includes the load resistance RL, the resistance ro2 of the
active load, and the output resistance ro of the amplifying transistor Q0.

The output voltage is
Vo = −(gm Vπ1)(ro∥RL∥ro2)
(10.93)
Since Vπ1 = Vi, where Vi is the ac input voltage, the small-signal voltage gain is

(10.94)
The small-signal voltage gain can also be written
Av =

(10.95)
where go and go2 are the output conductances of Q0 and Q2, and gL is the load con-
ductance. The transconductance is gm = ICo/VT , the small-signal conductances are
go = ICo/VAN and go2 = ICo/VAP, and the load conductance is gL = 1/RL. There-

(10.96)
If the passive load is an open circuit (RL →∞), the small-signal voltage gain is
identical to that determined from the dc analysis as given by Equation (10.86). If the
load resistance RL is not an open circuit, then the magnitude of the small-signal volt-
age gain is reduced.
EXAMPLE 10.12
Objective: Calculate the small-signal voltage gain of an ampliﬁer with an active
load and a load resistance RL.
For the circuit in Figure 10.37(a), the transistor parameters are VAN = 120 V
and VAP = 80 V. Let VT = 0.026 V and ICo = 0.2 mA. Determine the small-signal
voltage gain for load resistances of RL = ∞, 200 k, and 20 k.

Comment: The small-signal voltage gain is a strong function of the load resistance
RL. As the value of RL decreases, the loading effect becomes more severe.
Design Pointer: If an ampliﬁer with an active load is to drive another ampliﬁer
stage, the loading effect must be taken into account when the small-signal voltage
gain is determined. Also, the input resistance of the next stage must be large in order
to minimize the loading effect.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.12: For the circuit shown in Figure 10.37(a), the transistor parameters are
VAN = 100 V and VAP = 60 V. Let ICo = 0.25 mA. (a) Determine the open-circuit
small-signal voltage gain. (b) Find the value of RL such that the voltage gain is
60 percent of the open-circuit value. (Ans. (a) Av = −1442, (b) RL = 225 k)
The small-signal voltage gain of an active-load circuit can be increased by in-
creasing the effective resistance of the active load. Figure 10.38 shows the same type
of BJT ampliﬁer in which the active load is an “upside down” modiﬁed Widlar cur-
rent source. The small-signal voltage gain can be written in the same form as Equa-

where Ro2 is now the effective resistance looking into the collector of Q2. We ana-
lyzed the output resistance of a Widlar current source in the Section 10.1. In this case,
however, we are including a resistor in the emitter of both transistors Q1 and Q2. We

We may note that, if Q1 and Q2 are matched, then gm1 = gm2 and rπ1 = rπ2 since

Problem-Solving Technique: Active Loads
1.
Ensure that the active load devices are biased in the forward-active mode.
2.
The small-signal analysis of the circuit with an active load then simply in-
volves considering the output resistance looking into the output of the active
load device as well as the equivalent circuit of the amplifying transistor.
Small-Signal Analysis: MOSFET Active Load Circuit
The small-signal voltage gain of a MOSFET ampliﬁer with an active load can also be
determined from the small-signal equivalent circuit. Figure 10.39 is the small-signal
equivalent circuit of the entire MOSFET active load in Figure 10.33. The signal volt-
ages Vsg1 and Vsg2 are zero, since there is no ac excitation in this part of the circuit.
This means that gmVsg2 = 0 and

The parameters go and go2 are the output conductances of M0 and M2, and gL is the
load conductance. This expression for the small-signal voltage gain of a MOSFET
ampliﬁer with active load is the same as that of the BJT ampliﬁer.
A load resistance RL tends to degrade the gain and to cause a loading effect, as it
did in the bipolar circuit with an active load. However, in MOSFET ampliﬁers, the
output may be connected to the gate of another MOSFET ampliﬁer in which the
effective RL is very large.
EXAMPLE 10.13
Objective: Calculate the small-signal voltage gain of an NMOS ampliﬁer with an
active load.
For the ampliﬁer shown in Figure 10.40(a) the transistor parameters are:
λn = λp = 0.01 V−1, VT N = 1 V, and Kn = 1 mA/V2. Assume M1 and M2 are
matched and IREF = 0.5 mA. Calculate the small-signal voltage gain for load resis-
tances of RL = ∞and 100 k.
Solution: Since M1 and M2 are matched, then IO = IREF, and the transconductance is
gm = 2

Kn IREF = 2

(1)(0.5) = 1.41 mA/V
The small-signal transistor conductances are
go = go2 = λIREF = (0.01)(0.5) = 0.005 mA/V
For RL = ∞, Equation (10.101) reduces to
Av =
−gm
go + go2
=
−1.41
0.005 + 0.005 = −141

732

For RL = 100 k (gL = 0.01 mA/V), the voltage gain is
Av =
−gm
go + gL + go2
=
−1.41
0.005 + 0.01 + 0.005 = −70.5
Comment: The magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain of MOSFET ampliﬁers
with active loads is substantially larger than for those with resistive loads, but it is
still smaller than equivalent bipolar circuits, because of the smaller transconductance
for the MOSFET.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 10.13: For the circuit in Figure 10.40(a), the transistor parameters are: λn =
λp = 0.015 V−1, Kn = Kp = 0.10 mA/V2, VT N = 0.5 V, and VT P = −0.5 V. 
Let V + = 5 V and IREF = 0.20 mA. (a) Determine VI Q. (b) Find the open-circuit
small-signal voltage gain. (c) Find the value of RL that results in a voltage gain of
one-half the open-circuit value. (Ans. (a) VI Q = 1.914 V, (b) Av = −47.1, 
(c) RL = 166 k)
Small-Signal Analysis: 
Advanced MOSFET Active Load
The active loads considered in the BJT (Figure 10.37) and MOSFET (Figure 10.40(a))
circuits correspond to the simple two-transistor current mirrors. We may use a more
advanced current mirror with a high output resistance as an active load to increase
the ampliﬁer gain. Figure 10.41(a) shows a MOSFET cascode amplifying stage with
a cascode active load. The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 10.41(b),

where Ro3 is the effective resistance looking into the drain of M3. From our
discussion of the cascode current mirror, we found Ro3 = ro3 + ro4(1 + gmro3)
(Equation (10.57)).
We can assume all transistors are matched so that the currents in all transistors
are equal. Summing currents at D1, we have

(10.102)

For the same transistor parameters given in Example 10.13, the small-signal
voltage gain of this circuit would be 39,762! However, a word of warning is in order.
As we mentioned previously, output resistances in the hundreds of megohm range
are ideal and will, in reality, be limited by leakage currents. For this reason, a voltage
gain of 39,000 in a one-stage ampliﬁer will probably not be achieved. However, the
voltage gain of this ampliﬁer should be substantially larger than the ampliﬁer using a
simple active load.

DESIGN APPLICATION: AN NMOS 
CURRENT SOURCE
Objective: • Design an NMOS current source circuit to provide a
speciﬁed bias current and output resistance.
Speciﬁcations: Design an NMOS current source to provide a bias current of
IQ = 100 μA and an output resistance greater than 20 M. The reference current is
to be IREF = 150 μA. The circuit is to be biased at ±3.3 V and the voltage at the
drain of the current source transistor is to be no smaller than −2.2 V.
Design Approach: A simple two-transistor current source would yield an output
resistance of
Ro = ro =
1
λIQ
=
1
(0.01)(0.1) ⇒1 M
Therefore, to obtain a larger output resistance, a cascode current source is required.
The basic circuit is shown in Figure 10.42. The transistor M5 may actually need to be
two or more transistors in series.
Choices: NMOS transistors are available with the following parameters: VT N =
0.5 V, k′
n = 80 μA/V2, and λ = 0.01 V−1. The minimum width-to-length ratio of
any transistor is to be unity.
Solution: The minimum voltage VD3 is to be −2.2 V. This voltage is given by
VD3 = VGS1 + VDS3(sat) + V −= VGS1 + VGS3 −VT N + V −
Assuming that M1 and M3 are matched, we ﬁnd
VD3 = −2.2 = 2VGS1 −0.5 + (−3.3)

Comment: The very large output resistance of 671 M assumes that we have ideal
MOS transistors. In fact there are leakage currents that, in reality, will lower the out-
put resistance. However, the cascode current source does provide a very high output
resistance that is useful in differential ampliﬁers as we will see in Chapter 11.
10.6 SUMMARY
•
This chapter addressed the biasing of bipolar and FET circuits with constant-
current sources. The current source biasing technique eliminates the need for
resistor-intensive biasing used up to this point.
•
The basic bipolar current source is the simple two-transistor circuit with a resis-
tor to establish the reference current. The basic FET current source is also a sim-
ple two-transistor circuit but includes additional transistors in the reference
portion of the circuit. The relation between the bias current and reference current
was determined.
•
One parameter of interest in the current source circuit is the output resistance,
which determines the stability of the bias current. More sophisticated current-
source circuits, such as the Widlar and Wilson circuits in the BJT conﬁguration
and the Wilson and cascode circuits in the FET conﬁguration, have larger output
resistance parameters and increased bias-current stability.
•
Multitransistor output stages, in both bipolar and FET constant-current circuits,
are used to bias multiple ampliﬁer stages with a single reference current. These
circuits, called current mirrors, reduce the number of elements required to bias
ampliﬁer stages throughout an IC.
•
Both bipolar and MOSFET active load circuits were analyzed. Active loads are
essentially “upside down” current-source circuits that replace the discrete col-
lector and drain resistors. The active loads produce a much larger small-signal
voltage gain compared to discrete resistor circuits.

Chapter
Differential and
Multistage Ampliﬁers
In this chapter, we introduce a special multitransistor circuit conﬁguration called the
differential ampliﬁer, or diff-amp. We have encountered a diff-amp previously in our
discussion of op-amp circuits. However, the diff-amp, in the context of this chapter, is
at the basic transistor level.
The diff-amp is a fundamental building block of analog circuits. It is the input
stage of virtually every op-amp, and is the basis of a high-speed digital logic circuit
family, called emitter-coupled logic, which will be addressed in Chapter 17.
The design of diff-amps for integrated circuits, in general, incorporates current-
source biasing and active loads, which were analyzed in the last chapter. At the end
of this chapter, the reader should be able to design both BJT and MOSFET diff-amps
to meet particular speciﬁcations.
Basic BiCMOS analog circuits are also considered. BiCMOS circuits combine
bipolar and MOS transistors on the same semiconductor chip. The advantages of
the MOSFET’s high input impedance and the bipolar high gain can be utilized in the
same circuit.
Up to this point, we have concentrated primarily on the analysis and design of
single-stage ampliﬁers. However, these circuits have limited gain, input resistance,
and output resistance characteristics. Multistage or cascaded-stage ampliﬁers can be
designed to produce high gain and speciﬁed input and output resistance properties. In
this chapter, we begin to consider these multistage ampliﬁers.

Describe the characteristics and terminology of the ideal differential ampliﬁer.
•

THE DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER
Objective: • Describe the characteristics and terminology of the
ideal differential ampliﬁer.
In Chapters 4 and 6, we discussed the reasons linear ampliﬁers are necessary in ana-
log electronic systems. In these chapters, we analyzed and designed several conﬁgu-
rations of MOSFET and bipolar ampliﬁers. In these circuits, there was one input ter-
minal and one output terminal.
In this chapter, we introduce another basic transistor circuit conﬁguration called
the differential ampliﬁer. This ampliﬁer, also called a diff-amp, is the input stage to
virtually all op-amps and is probably the most widely used ampliﬁer building block
in analog integrated circuits. Figure 11.1 is a block diagram of the diff-amp. There
are two input terminals and one output terminal. Ideally, the output signal is propor-
tional to only the difference between the two input signals.
The ideal output voltage can be written as
vo = Avol(v1 −v2)
(11.1)
where Avol is called the open-loop voltage gain. In the ideal case, if v1 = v2, the out-
put voltage is zero. We only obtain a nonzero output voltage if v1 and v2 are not equal.
We deﬁne the differential-mode input voltage as
vd = v1 −v2
(11.2)
and the common-mode input voltage as
vcm = v1 + v2
2
(11.3)
These equations show that if v1 = v2, the differential-mode input signal is zero and
the common-mode input signal is vcm = v1 = v2.
If, for example, v1 = +10 μV and v2 = −10 μV, then the differential-mode
voltage is vd = 20 μV and the common-mode voltage is vcm = 0. However,
if v1 = 110 μV and v2 = 90 μV, then the differential-mode input signal is still
vd = 20 μV, but the common-mode input signal is vcm = 100 μV. If each pair of
input voltages were applied to the ideal difference ampliﬁer, the output voltage in
each case would be exactly the same. However, ampliﬁers are not ideal, and the
common-mode input signal does affect the output. One goal of the design of differ-
ential ampliﬁers is to minimize the effect of the common-mode input signal.

BASIC BJT DIFFERENTIAL PAIR
Objective: • Describe the characteristics of and analyze the basic

In this section, we consider the basic bipolar difference ampliﬁer or diff-amp. We
introduce the terminology, qualitatively describe the operation of the circuit, and
analyze the dc and small-signal characteristics of the diff-amp.

Figure 11.2 Basic BJT differential-pair conﬁguration
BJT Diff-Amp Operation—Qualitative Description
Figure 11.2 shows the basic BJT differential-pair conﬁguration. Two identical
transistors, Q1 and Q2, whose emitters are connected together, are biased by a constant-
current source IQ, which is connected to a negative supply voltage V −. The collectors
of Q1 and Q2 are connected through resistors RC to a positive supply voltage V +. By
design, transistors Q1 and Q2 are to remain biased in the forward-active region. We
assume that the two collector resistors RC are equal, and that vB1 and vB2 are ideal
sources, meaning that the output resistances of these sources are negligibly small.
11.2.1
Since both positive and negative bias voltages are used in the circuit, the need
for coupling capacitors and voltage divider biasing resistors at the inputs of Q1 and
Q2 has been eliminated. If the input signal voltages vB1 and vB2 in the circuit shown
in Figure 11.2 are both zero, Q1 and Q2 are still biased in the active region by the
current source IQ. The common-emitter voltage vE would be on the order of −0.7 V.
This circuit, then, is referred to as a dc-coupled differential ampliﬁer, so differences
in dc input voltages can be ampliﬁed. Although the diff-amp contains two transistors,
it is considered a single-stage ampliﬁer. The analysis will show that it has character-
istics similar to those of the common-emitter ampliﬁer.
First, we consider the circuit in which the two base terminals are connected
together and a common-mode voltage vcm is applied as shown in Figure 11.3(a). The
transistors are biased “on” by the constant-current source, and the voltage at the
common emitters is vE = vcm −VBE(on). Since Q1 and Q2 are matched or identical,
current IQ splits evenly between the two transistors, and
iE1 = iE2 = IQ

(11.4)
If base currents are negligible, then iC1 ∼= iE1 and iC2 ∼= iE2, and
vC1 = V + −IQ

Figure 11.3 Basic diff-amp with applied common-mode voltage and (b) basic diff-amp 
with applied differential-mode voltage
We see from Equation (11.5) that, for an applied common-mode voltage, IQ splits
evenly between Q1 and Q2 and the difference between vC1 and vC2 is zero.
Now, if vB1 increases by a few millivolts and vB2 decreases by the same amount,
or vB1 = vd/2 and vB2 = −vd/2, the voltages at the bases of Q1 and Q2 are no longer
equal. Since the emitters are common, this means that the B–E voltages on Q1 and Q2
are no longer equal. Since vB1 increases and vB2 decreases, then vBE1 > vBE2, which
means that iC1 increases by I above its quiescent value and iC2 decreases by I
below its quiescent value. This is shown in Figure 11.3(b). A potential difference
now exits between the two collector terminals. We can write

EXAMPLE 11.1
Objective: Determine the quiescent collector current and collector-emitter voltage
in a difference ampliﬁer.
Consider the diff-amp in Figure 11.2, with circuit parameters: V + = 10 V,
V −= −10 V, IQ = 1 mA, and RC = 10 k. The transistor parameters are: β = ∞
(neglect base currents), VA = ∞, and VBE(on) = 0.7 V. Determine iC1 and vCE1 for
common-mode voltages vB1 = vB2 = vCM = 0, −5 V, and +5 V.
Solution: We know that
iC1 = iC2 = IQ
2 = 0.5 mA

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers
757
therefore,
vC1 = vC2 = V + −iC1RC = 10 −(0.5)(10) = 5 V
From vCM = 0, vE = −0.7 V and
vC E1 = vC1 −vE = 5 −(−0.7) = 5.7 V
For vCM = −5 V, vE = −5.7 V and
vC E1 = vC1 −vE = 5 −(−5.7) = 10.7 V
For vCM = +5 V, vE = 4.3 V and
vC E1 = vC1 −vE = 5 −4.3 = 0.7 V
Comment: As the common-mode input voltage varies, the ideal constant current IQ
still splits evenly between Q1 and Q2, but the collector-emitter voltage varies, which
means that the Q-point changes. The variation in Q-point as a function of common-
mode input voltage is shown in Figure 11.4(a). In this example, if vCM were to
increase about +5 V, then Q1 and Q2 would be driven into saturation. This demon-
strates that there is a limited range of applied common-mode voltage over which Q1
and Q2 will remain biased in the forward-active mode.
Figure 11.4(b) shows the Q-point when vCM = 0 and also shows the variation in
iC1 and vCE1 when an 18 mV sinusoidal differential voltage is applied.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.1: The circuit parameters for the differential ampliﬁer shown in Figure
11.2 are V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V, IQ = 0.3 mA, and RC = 20 k. The transistor
parameters are β = 180, VBE(on) 5 0.7 V, and VA = ∞. Determine the voltages
vE, vC1, vC2, vC E1, and vC E2 for (a) v1 = v2 = 0, (b) v1 = v2 = −1 V, 
and (c) v1 = v2 = +1 V. (Ans. (a) vE = −0.7 V, vC1 = vC2 = 2 V, vC E1 =
vC E2 = 2.7 V; (b) vE = −1.7 V, vC1 = vC2 = 2 V, vC E1 = vC E2 = 3.7 V; 
(c) vE = +0.3 V, vC1 = vC2 = 2 V, vC E1 = vC E2 = 1.7 V)
DC Transfer Characteristics
We can perform a general analysis of the differential-pair conﬁguration by using the ex-
ponential relationship between collector current and B–E voltage. To begin, we know that
iC1 = ISevBE1/VT
(11.7(a))
and
iC2 = ISevBE2/VT
(11.7(b))
We assume Q1 and Q2 are matched and are operating at the same temperature, so the
coefﬁcient IS is the same in each expression.
Neglecting base currents and assuming IQ is an ideal constant-current source, we
have
IQ = iC1 + iC2
(11.8)
where iC1 and iC2 are the total instantaneous currents, which may include the signal
currents. We then have
IQ = IS[evBE1/VT + evBE2/VT ]
(11.9)
Taking the ratios of iC1 to IQ and iC2 to IQ, we obtain
iC1
IQ
=
1
1 + e(vBE2−vBE1)/VT
(11.10(a))
and
iC2
IQ
=
1
1 + e−(vBE2−vBE1)/VT
(11.10(b))
From Figure 11.3(b) we see that
vBE1 −vBE2 ≡vd
(11.11)
where vd is the differential-mode input voltage. Equations (11.10(a)) and (11.10(b))
can then be written in terms of vd, as follows:
iC1 =
IQ
1 + e−vd/VT
(11.12(a))
and
iC2 =
IQ
1 + e+vd/VT
(11.12(b))
Equations (11.12(a)) and (11.12(b)) describe the basic current–voltage charac-
teristics of the differential ampliﬁer. If the differential-mode input voltage is zero,
11.2.2

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers
759
then the current IQ splits evenly between iC1 and IC2, as we discussed. However, when
a differential-mode signal vd is applied, a difference occurs between iC1 and iC2
which in turn causes a change in the collector terminal voltage. This is the funda-
mental operation of the diff-amp. If a common-mode signal vCM = vB1 = vB2 is ap-
plied, the bias current IQ still splits evenly between the two transistors.
Figure 11.5 is the normalized plot of the dc transfer characteristics for the
differential ampliﬁer. We can make two basic observations. First, the gain of the dif-
ferential ampliﬁer is proportional to the slopes of the transfer curves about the point
vd = 0. In order to maintain a linear ampliﬁer, the excursion of vd about zero must be
kept small.

Second, as the magnitude of vd becomes sufﬁciently large, essentially all of
current IQ goes to one transistor, and the second transistor effectively turns off. This
particular characteristic is used in the emitter-coupled logic (ECL) family of digital
logic circuits, which is discussed in Chapter 17.
EXAMPLE 11.2
Objective: Determine the maximum differential-mode input signal that can be
applied and still maintain linearity in the differential ampliﬁer.
Figure 11.6 shows an expanded view of the normalized iC1 versus vd character-
istic. A linear approximation that corresponds to the slope at vd = 0 is superimposed
on the curve. Determine vd(max) such that the difference between the linear approx-
imation and the actual curve is 1 percent.

iC1(actual) =

Comment: The differential-mode input voltage must be held to within ±18 mV in
order for the output signal of this diff-amp to be within 1 percent of a linear response.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.2: Consider the dc transfer characteristics shown in Figure 11.5. Determine
the value of the differential-mode input voltage that results in (a) iC1 = 0.25IQ and
(b) iC2 = 0.9IQ. (Ans. (a) vd = −0.02856 V, (b) vd = −0.05713 V)
COMPUTER SIMULATION PROBLEM
PS 11.1 Plot the dc transfer characteristics in Figure 11.5 using a computer
simulation.
We can now begin to consider the operation of the diff-amp in terms of the small-
signal parameters. Figure 11.7 shows the differential-pair conﬁguration with an

applied differential-mode input signal. Note that the polarity of the input voltage at Q1
is opposite to that at Q2. The forward-transconductance gf can be written in terms of
the individual transistor transconductances gm. From Equation (11.13), we have
gf = IQ

IQ/2
VT

2gm
(11.15)
where (IQ/2) is the quiescent collector current in Q1 and Q2. The magnitude of the
small-signal collector current in each transistor is then (gmvd)/2.
Figure 11.7 also shows the linear approximations for the collector currents in
terms of the transistor transconductances gm. The slope of iC1 versus vd is the same
magnitude as that of iC2 versus vd, but it has the opposite sign. This is the reason for
the negative sign in the expression for iC2 versus vd.
We can deﬁne the output signal voltage as
vo = vC2 −vC1
(11.16)
When the output is deﬁned as the difference between the two collector voltages, we
have a two-sided output. From Figure 11.7, we can write the output voltage as
vo = [V + −iC2RC] −[V + −iC1RC] = (iC1 −iC2)RC

the current source is inﬁnite (represented by the dashed line). Using the equivalent

Ad = vo

(11.19)
If the output voltage is the difference between the two collector terminal volt-
ages, then neither side of the output voltage is at ground potential. In many cases, the
output voltage is taken at one collector terminal with respect to ground. The result-
ing voltage output is called a one-sided output. If we deﬁne the output to be vc2, then
from Figure 11.8(b), the signal output voltage is

The differential gain for the one-sided output is then given by

(11.21)
The differential gain for the one-sided output is one-half that of the two-sided output.
However, as we will see in our discussion on active loads, only a one-sided output is
available.
We have assumed that the transistors Q1 and Q2, and the two collector resistors
RC, are matched. The effects of mismatched elements are discussed in the next
section.
Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Analysis
The dc transfer characteristics derived in the last section provide insight into the
operation of the differential ampliﬁer. Assuming we are operating in the linear range,
we can also derive the gain and other characteristics of the diff-amp, using the small-
signal equivalent circuit.
11.2.3

Figure 11.9 shows the small-signal equivalent circuit of the bipolar differential-
pair conﬁguration. We assume that the Early voltage is inﬁnite for the two emitter-
pair transistors, and that the constant-current source is not ideal but can be represented
by a ﬁnite output impedance Ro. Resistances RB are also included. These represent
the output resistance of the signal voltage sources. All voltages are represented by
their phasor components. Since the two transistors are biased at the same quiescent
current, we have
rπ1 = rπ2 ≡rπ

Equation (11.26) includes a ﬁnite output resistance for the current source. We
can see that when a common-mode signal Vcm = Vb1 = Vb2 is applied, the output
voltage is no longer zero.
Differential- and common-mode voltages are deﬁned in Equations (11.2) and
(11.3). Using phasor notation, we can solve these equations for Vb1 and Vb2 in terms
of Vd and Vcm. We obtain

and (11.29(b)) then simply state that the two input signals can be written as the sum
of a differential-mode input signal component and a common-mode input signal

We can write the output voltage in the general form

where Ad is the differential-mode gain and Acm is the common-mode gain. Compar-
ing Equations (11.30) and (11.31), we see that the differential-mode gain is
Ad =

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers
765
and the common-mode gain is
Acm =
−βRC
rπ + RB + 2(1 + β)Ro
(11.32(b))
We again observe that the common-mode gain goes to zero for an ideal current
source in which Ro = ∞. For a nonideal current source, Ro is ﬁnite and the common-
mode gain is not zero for this case of a one-sided output. A nonzero common-mode
gain implies that the diff-amp is not ideal.
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio
The ability of a differential ampliﬁer to reject a common-mode signal is described in
terms of the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The CMRR is a ﬁgure of merit
for the diff-amp and is deﬁned as
CMRR =

Ad
Acm

(11.33)
For an ideal diff-amp, Acm = 0 and CMRR = ∞. Usually, the CMRR is ex-
pressed in decibels, as follows:
CMMRdB = 20 log10


(11.34)
For the diff-amp in Figure 11.2, the one-sided differential- and common-mode

can express the CMRR as

The common-mode gain decreases as Ro increases. Therefore, we see that the CMRR
increases as Ro increases.
EXAMPLE 11.3
Objective: Determine the differential- and common-mode gains and the common-
mode rejection ratio of a diff-amp.
Consider the circuit in Figure 11.2, with parameters: V + = 10 V, V −= −10 V,
IQ = 0.8 mA, and RC = 12 k. The transistor parameters are β = 100 and
VA = ∞. Assume the output resistance looking into the constant-current source is

CMRR|dB = 20 log10 CMRR
which, for this example, becomes
CMRR|dB = 20 log10(389) = 51.8 dB
Comment: The common-mode gain is less than the differential-mode gain, but is
not zero as determined for the ideal diff-amp with an ideal current source. In general,
a common-mode rejection ratio of CMRR|dB > 80 dB is a design goal for a diff-amp.
The aim, then, is to design a better diff-amp than considered in this example.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 11.4
Objective: Design a differential ampliﬁer to meet the speciﬁcations of an experi-
mental system.
Speciﬁcations: Figure 11.10 shows a Hall-effect experiment to measure semicon-
ductor material parameters. A Hall voltage VH, which is perpendicular to both a
current IX and a magnetic ﬁeld BZ, is to be measured by using a diff-amp. The range
of VH is −8 ≤VH ≤+8 mV and the desired range of the diff-amp output signal is to
be −0.8 ≤VO ≤+0.8 V. The probes that make contact to the semiconductor have
an effective resistance of 500 , and each probe has an induced 60 Hz signal with a
magnitude of 100 mV. The diff-amp output 60 Hz signal is to be no larger than
10 mV. Typically, VX = 5 V, so that the quiescent or common-mode voltage of the
Hall probes is 2.5 V.

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers

Choices: The bipolar diff-amp with the conﬁguration in Figure 11.7 is to be de-
signed with bias voltages of ±10 V. The diff-amp transistors are matched with
β = 100 and matched integrated collector resistors of any value can be fabricated.
Assume the transistors in the current source are matched with very large β values,
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = 80 V. A bias current of IQ = 0.5 mA is to be used.
Solution (Differential-Mode Gain): The differential-mode voltage gain requirement is
Ad = Vo
Vd
=
0.8
0.008 = 100
The small-signal parameters are then
rπ = βVT
IC Q

0.25
= 10.4 k
and
gm = IC Q
VT
= 0.25
0.026 = 9.62 mA/V
The differential gain is
Ad =
βRC
2(rπ + RB)
or
100 =
(100)RC
2(10.4 + 0.5)
which means that RC = 21.8 k. We may note that the voltage drop across RC under
quiescent conditions is 5.45 V. With a 2.5 V common-mode input voltage, the quies-
cent collector-emitter voltages of Q1 and Q2 are approximately 3.65 V. The two input
transistors will then remain in the active region.
Solution (Common-Mode Gain): The common-mode voltage gain requirement is
Acm = Vo
Vcm
= 10 mV
100 mV = 0.10
The common-mode gain is given by
|Acm| =
βRC
rπ + RB + 2(1 + β)Ro
or
0.10 =
(100)(21.8)
10.4 + 0.5 + 2(101)Ro
which means that Ro = 108 k. If we consider a simple two-transistor current
source as discussed in the last chapter, the output resistance is Ro = ro = VA/IQ,
where VA is the Early voltage. With IQ = 0.5 mA, then VA = 54 V is the Early
voltage requirement. This speciﬁcation is not difﬁcult to achieve for most bipolar
transistors.

Trade-offs: If the common-mode gain requirement had been more stringent, a
different current source circuit might be required to provide a larger output resistance.
The effects of mismatched devices and elements are considered in the next section.
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: Figure 11.11 shows the circuit used in the
computer simulation for this example. The bias current IQ supplied by the Q3 current
source transistor is 0.568 mA. A 2.5 V common-mode input voltage is applied, a
500  source (probe) resistance is included, and an 8 mV differential-mode input
signal is applied. The differential output signal voltage measured at the collector of
Q2 is 0.84 V, which is just slightly larger than the designed value. The current gains
of the standard 2N3904 transistors used in the computer simulation are larger than
the values of 100 used in the hand analysis and design. A common-mode signal volt-
age of 100 mV replaced the differential-mode signals. The common-mode output
signal is 7.11 mV, which is within the design speciﬁcation.

(b) vo = −0.4 −0.8 sin ωt V)
Two-Sided Output
If we consider the two-sided output of an ideal op-amp and deﬁne the output voltage
as Vo = Vc2 −Vc1, we can show that the differential-mode voltage gain is given by
Ad =
βRC
rπ + RB
(11.36(a))
and the common-mode voltage gain is given by
Acm = 0
(11.36(b))
The result of Acm = 0 for the two-sided output is a consequence of using matched
devices and elements in the diff-amp circuit. We will reconsider a two-sided output
and discuss the effects of mismatched elements.
Effect of RC Mismatch—Two-Sided Output
We assume that RC1 and RC2 are the resistors in the collectors of Q1 and Q2. If the two
resistors are not matched, we assume that we can write RC1 = RC + RC and
RC2 = RC −RC. For simplicity, let RB = 0.
From Figure 11.9, the output voltage for a two-sided output is given by
Vo = Vc2 −Vc1 = (−gmVπ2RC2) −(−gmVπ1RC1)
(11.37)
We also see from the ﬁgure (with RB = 0) that Vπ1 = Vb1 −Ve and Vπ2 = Vb2 −Ve.
Using the expressions for Ve (Equation (11.24), Vb1 (Equation (11.29(a)), and Vb2
(Equation (11.29(b)), we ﬁnd the differential voltage gain as
Ad = gm RC
(11.38)
and the common-mode gain as
Acm = gm(2RC) ·

(11.41)
Effect of gm Mismatch—Two-Sided Output
We can consider the effect of transistor mismatch by considering the effect of a mis-
match in the transconductance gm. We assume gm1 and gm2 are the transconductance
parameters of the two transistors in the diff-amp. We will assume that we can write
gm1 = gm + gm and gm2 = gm −gm. Again, for simplicity, let RB = 0.
Again, from Figure 11.9, the output voltage for a two-sided output is
Vo = Vc2 −Vc1 = (−gm2Vπ2RC) −(−gm1Vπ1RC)
(11.42)
Applying a differential input voltage, we ﬁnd Vπ1 = Vd/2 and Vπ2 = −Vd/2. The
differential voltage gain is then
Ad = Vo
Vd
= gm RC
(11.43)
Applying a common-mode input voltage, we have Vπ1 = Vπ2 = Vcm −Ve. The out-
put voltage is again given by
Vo = Vc2 −Vc1 = (−gm2Vπ2RC) −(−gm1Vπ1RC)
(11.44(a))
or
Vo = (Vcm −Ve)RC(gm1 −gm2)
(11.44(b))
Summing currents at the Ve node in Figure 11.9, we have
Vπ1
rπ1
+ gm1Vπ1 + gm2Vπ2 + Vπ2
rπ2

(11.45)
In general, we have gm ≫1/rπ. Then Equation (11.45) becomes
(Vcm −Ve)(gm1 + gm2) = Ve
Ro
(11.46(a))
or
Ve = Vcm(gm1 + gm2)

The output voltage is then

Noting that gm1 + gm2 = 2gm and gm1 −gm2 = 2(gm), the common-mode gain is

(11.48)
The common-mode rejection ratio now becomes

Differential- and Common-Mode
Gains—Further Observations
For greater insight into the mechanism that causes differential- and common-mode
gains, we reconsider the diff-amp as pure differential- and common-mode signals are
applied.
Figure 11.12(a) shows the ac equivalent circuit of the diff-amp with two sinu-
soidal input signals. The two input voltages are 180 degrees out of phase, so a pure
differential-mode signal is being applied to the diff-amp. We see that vb1 + vb2 = 0.
From Equation (11.24), we ﬁnd ve = 0, so the common emitters of Q1 and Q2 remain
at signal ground. In essence, the circuit behaves like a balanced seesaw. As the base
voltage of Q1 goes into its positive-half cycle, the base voltage of Q2 is in its nega-
tive half-cycle. Then, as the base voltage of Q1 goes into its negative half-cycle, the
base voltage of Q2 is in its positive half-cycle. The signal current directions shown in
the ﬁgure are valid for vb1 in its positive half-cycle.

Figure 11.12 (a) Equivalent ac circuit, diff-amp with applied sinusoidal differential-mode
input signal, and resulting signal current directions and (b) differential-mode half-circuits
Since ve is always at ground potential, we can treat each half of the diff-amp
as a common-emitter circuit. Figure 11.12(b) shows the differential half-circuits,
clearly depicting the common-emitter conﬁguration. The differential-mode charac-
teristics of the diff-amp can be determined by analyzing the half-circuit. In evaluat-
ing the small-signal hybrid-π parameters, we must keep in mind that the half-circuit
is biased at IQ/2.
Figure 11.13(a) shows the ac equivalent circuit of the diff-amp with a pure
common-mode sinusoidal input signal. In this case, the two input voltages are in
phase. The current source is represented as an ideal source IQ in parallel with its out-
put resistance Ro. Current iq is the time-varying component of the source current. As
the two input signals increase, voltage ve increases and current iq increases. Since this
current splits evenly between Q1 and Q2, each collector current also increases. The
output voltage vo then decreases below its quiescent value.
As the two input voltages go through the negative half-cycle, all signal currents
shown in the ﬁgure reverse direction, and vo increases above its quiescent value.

772
Part 2
Analog Electronics
Consequently, a common-mode sinusoidal input signal produces a sinusoidal output
voltage, which means that the diff-amp has a nonzero common-mode voltage gain. If the
value of Ro increases, the magnitude of iq decreases for a given common-mode input sig-
nal, producing a smaller output voltage and hence a smaller common-mode gain.
With an applied common-mode voltage, the circuit shown in Figure 11.13(a) is
perfectly symmetrical. The circuit can therefore be split into the identical common-
mode half-circuits shown in Figure 11.13(b). The common-mode characteristics of the
diff-amp can then be determined by analyzing the half-circuit, which is a common-
emitter conﬁguration with an emitter resistor. Each half-circuit is biased at IQ/2.
The following examples further illustrate the effect of a nonzero common-mode
gain on circuit performance.

EXAMPLE 11.5
Objective: Determine the output of a diff-amp when both differential- and common-
mode signals are applied.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 11.2. Use the transistor and circuit para-
meters described in Example 11.3. Assume that four sets of inputs are applied, as
described in the following table, which also includes the differential- and common-
mode voltages.
Solution: The output voltage is given by Equation (11.31), as follows:
vo = Advd + Acmvcm
From Example 11.3, the differential- and common-mode gains are Ad = 92.3 and
Acm = −0.237. The output voltages for the four sets of inputs are:
Comment: In cases 1 and 2, the common-mode input is zero, and the output is
directly proportional to the differential input signal. Comparing cases 1 and 3 and
cases 2 and 4, we see that the output voltages are not equal, even though the differ-
ential input signals are the same. This shows that the common-mode signal affects
the output. Also, even though the differential signal is doubled, in cases 4 and 3, the
ratio of the output signals is not 2.0. If a common-mode signal is present, the output
is not exactly linear with respect to the differential input signal.
For Case 5, the differential-input voltage is zero, but the output voltage is not
zero, since a common-mode input voltage exists and |Acm| ̸= 0.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.5: Assume a diff-amp has a differential-mode gain of Ad = 150 and a
common-mode rejection ratio of CMMRdB = 50 dB. Assume Acm is positive.
Determine the output voltage if the input voltages are (a) v1 = −10 μV,
v2 = +10 μV and (b) v1 = 190 μV, v2 = 210 μV. (Ans. (a) vo = −3.0 mV, 
(b) vo = −2.905 mV)
As mentioned previously, the common-mode gain is a function of the output
resistance of the current source. If the required common-mode gain needs to be re-
duced, then the current source output resistance must be increased, which may
require the design of a more sophisticated current source.
Problem-Solving Technique: Diff-Amps with Resistive Loads
1.
To determine the differential-mode voltage gain, apply a pure differential-
mode input voltage and use the differential-mode half-circuit in the analysis.
2.
To determine the common-mode voltage gain, apply a pure common-mode
input voltage and use the common-mode half-circuit in the analysis.
Differential- and Common-Mode Input Impedances
The input impedance, or resistance, of an ampliﬁer is as important a property as the
voltage gain. The input resistance determines the loading effect of the circuit on
the signal source. We will look at two input resistances for the difference ampliﬁer:
the differential-mode input resistance, which is the resistance seen by a differential-
mode signal source; and the common-mode input resistance, which is the resis-
tance seen by a common-mode input signal source.
Differential-Mode Input Resistance
The differential-mode input resistance is the effective resistance between the two
input base terminals when a differential-mode signal is applied. A diff-amp with a
pure differential input signal is shown in Figure 11.14. The applicable differential-
mode half-circuits were shown in Figure 11.12(b). For this circuit, we have
vd/2
ib
= rπ
(11.50)
The differential-mode input resistance is therefore
Rid = vd
ib
= 2rπ
(11.51)
Another common diff-amp conﬁguration uses emitter resistors, as shown in
Figure 11.15. With a pure applied differential-mode voltage, similar differential-mode
half-circuits are applicable to this conﬁguration. We can then use the resistance re-
ﬂection rule to ﬁnd the differential-mode input resistance. We have
vd/2
ib
= rπ + (1 + β)RE
(11.52)
11.2.7

Therefore,
Rid = vd
ib
= 2[rπ + (1 + β)RE]
(11.53)
Equation (11.53) implies that the differential-mode input resistance increases sig-
niﬁcantly when emitter resistors are included. We will see that the differential-mode
gain decreases when emitter resistors are included in the same way that the voltage
gain of a common-emitter ampliﬁer decreases when an emitter resistor is included in
the design. However, a larger differential-mode voltage (greater than 18 mV) may be
applied to the diff-amp in Figure 11.15 and the ampliﬁer remains linear.
Common-Mode Input Resistance
Figure 11.16(a) shows a diff-amp with an applied common-mode voltage. The small-
signal output resistance Ro of the constant-current source is also shown. The equiva-
lent common-mode half-circuits were given in Figure 11.13(b). Since the half-cir-
cuits are in parallel, we can write
2Ricm = rπ + (1 + β)(2Ro) ∼= (1 + β)(2Ro)
(11.54)
Equation (11.54) is a ﬁrst approximation for determining the common-mode input
resistance.
Normally, Ro is large, and Ricm is typically in the megohm range. Therefore, the
transistor output resistance ro and the base–collector resistance rμ may need to be
included in the calculation. Figure 11.16(b) shows the more complete equivalent
half-circuit model. For this model, we have
2Ricm = rμ ∥[(1 + β)(2Ro)]∥[(1 + β)ro]

Assume IQ = 0.5 mA, β = 100, and RC = 10 k. Find the differential-mode
voltage gain for (a) RE = 0 and (b) RE = 500 .
Solution: The small-signal transconductance is found to be gm = 9.62 mA/V. We
ﬁnd the differential-mode voltage gain to be (a) for RE = 0:
Ad = gm RC

and (b) for RE = 500 :
Ad =

2(1 + gm RE) =

2[1 + (9.62)(0.5)] = 8.28
Comment: As with any design problem, there are trade-offs. Including an emitter re-
sistor RE decreases the voltage gain but increases the input differential-mode resistance.

BASIC FET DIFFERENTIAL PAIR
Objective: • Describe the characteristics of and analyze the basic
FET differential ampliﬁer.
In this section, we will evaluate the basic FET differential ampliﬁer, concentrating on
the MOSFET diff-amp. As we did for the bipolar diff-amp, we will develop the dc
transfer characteristics, and determine the differential- and common-mode gains. 
Differential ampliﬁers using JFETs are also available. Since the analysis is almost
identical to that for the MOSFET diff-amp, we will only brieﬂy consider the JFET dif-
ferential pair. Afew of the problems at the end of this chapter are based on these circuits.
DC Transfer Characteristics
Figure 11.19 shows the basic MOSFET differential pair, with matched transistors M1
and M2 biased with a constant current IQ. We assume that M1 and M2 are always
biased in the saturation region. 
Like the basic bipolar conﬁguration, the basic MOSFET diff-amp uses both
positive and negative bias voltages, thereby eliminating the need for coupling capacitors
and voltage divider biasing resistors at the gate terminals. Even with vG1 = vG2 = 0,
the transistors M1 and M2 can be biased in the saturation region by the current source IQ.
This circuit, then, is also a dc-coupled diff-amp.

Solution: The reference current can be determined from

Combining these two equations and substituting the parameter values, we obtain
9V 2

which yields
VGS4 = 2.40 V
and
I1 = 0.587 mA
Since M3 and M4 are identical, we also ﬁnd
IQ = 0.587 mA
The quiescent drain currents in Ml and M2 are

The quiescent values of vO1 and vO2 are 
vO1 = vO2 = 10 −ID1RD = 10 −(0.293)(16) = 5.31 V
The maximum common-mode input voltage is the value when M1 and M2 reach
the transition point, or
VDS1 = VDS2 = VDS1(sat) = VGS1 −VT N = 2.71 −1 = 1.71 V
Therefore,
vCM(max) = vO1 −VDS1(sat) + VGS1 = 5.31 −1.71 + 2.71
or
vCM(max) = 6.31 V
The minimum common-mode input voltage is the value when M4 reaches the
transition point, or 
VDS4 = VDS4(sat) = VGS4 −VT N = 2.4 −1 = 1.4 V
Therefore,
vCM(min) = VGS1 + VDS4(sat) −10 = 2.71 + 1.4 −10
or
vCM(min) = −5.89 V
Comment: For this circuit the maximum range for the common-mode input voltage
is −5.89 ≤vCM ≤6.31 V.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 11.8: For the differential ampliﬁer in Figure 11.20, the parameters are:
V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V, R1 = 80 k, and RD = 40 k. The transistor parameters
are λ = 0 and VT N = 0.8 V for all transistors, and Kn3 = Kn4 = 100 μA/V2 and
Kn1 = Kn2 = 50 μA/V2. Determine the range of the common-mode input volt-
age. (Ans. −2.18 ≤vcm ≤3.76 V)
The dc transfer characteristics of the MOSFET differential pair can be deter-
mined from the circuit in Figure 11.19. Neglecting the output resistances of M1 and
M2, and assuming the two transistors are matched, we can write
iD1 = Kn(vGS1 −VT N)2
(11.60(a))
and
iD2 = Kn(vGS2 −VT N)2

where gm is the transconductance of each transistor. The slope of the iD2 characteris-
tic curve at vd = 0 is the same, except it is negative.
We can perform an analysis similar to that in Example 11.2 to determine the
maximum differential-mode input signal that can be applied and still maintain
linearity. If we let IQ = 1 mAand Kn = 1 mA/V2, then for differential input voltages
less than 0.34 V, the difference between the linear approximation and the actual curve
is less than 1 percent. The maximum differential input signal for the MOSFET diff-
amp is much larger than for the bipolar diff-amp. The principal reason is that the gain
of the MOSFET diff-amp, as we will see, is much smaller than the gain of the bipo-
lar diff-amp.
Figure 11.22 is the ac equivalent circuit of the diff-amp conﬁguration, showing
only the differential voltage and signal currents as a function of the transistor
transconductance gm. We assume that the output resistance looking into the current

Differential- and Common-Mode Input Impedances
At low frequencies, the input impedance of a MOSFET is essentially inﬁnite, which
means that both the differential- and common-mode input resistances of a MOSFET
diff-amp are inﬁnite. Also, we know that the differential input resistance of a bipolar
pair can be in the low kilohm range. A design trade-off, then, would be to use a
MOSFET diff-amp with inﬁnite input resistance, and sacriﬁce the differential-mode
voltage gain.
Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Analysis
We can determine the basic relationships for the differential-mode gain, common-
mode gain, and common-mode rejection ratio from an analysis of the small-signal
equivalent circuit.
Figure 11.23 shows the small-signal equivalent circuit of the MOSFET differ-
ential pair conﬁguration. We assume the transistors are matched, with λ = 0 for each
transistor, and that the constant-current source is represented by a ﬁnite output
resistance Ro. All voltages are represented by their phasor components. The two tran-
sistors are biased at the same quiescent current, and gm1 = gm2 ≡gm.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.9: The parameters of the circuit shown in Figure 11.19 are V + = 3 V,
V −= −3 V, IQ = 0.2 mA, and RD = 15 k. Assume M1 and M2 are matched

(a) W/L = 200, (b) gf (max) = 1.0 mA/V)
The value of the common-mode rejection ratio can be increased by increasing
the output resistance of the current source. An increase in the output resistance can
be accomplished by using a more sophisticated current source circuit. Figure 11.24


= 93.7 dB
We increased the common-mode rejection ratio dramatically by using the cascode
current mirror instead of the single two-transistor current source. Note, however, that
the differential-mode voltage gain is unchanged.
To gain an appreciation of the difference in CMRR between 45.3 dB and
93.7 dB, we can reconsider the linear scale. For a CMRRdB = 45.3 dB, the differen-
tial gain is a factor of 185 times larger than the common-mode gain, while for a
CMRRdB = 93.7 dB, the differential gain is a factor of 48,436 times larger than the
common-mode gain.
Two-Sided Output
If we consider the two-sided output of an ideal MOSFET op-amp and deﬁne the out-
put voltage as Vo = Vd2 −Vd1, we can show that the differential-mode voltage gain
is given by
Ad = gm RD
(11.84(a))
and the common-mode voltage gain is given by
Acm = 0
(11.84(b))
The result of Acm = 0 for the two-sided output is a consequence of using matched
devices and elements in the diff-amp circuit. We will reconsider a two-sided output
and discuss the effects of mismatched elements in the next section.
Effect of RD Mismatch—Two-Sided Output
We assume that RD1 and RD2 are the resistors in the drains of M1 and M2. If the two
resistors are not matched, we assume that we can write RD1 = RD + RD and
RD2 = RD −RD. Using the small-signal equivalent circuit in Figure 11.23, we
can ﬁnd
Ad = gm RD

This result is essentially the same as the BJT diff-amp.
Effect of gm Mismatch—Two-Sided Output
We can consider the effect of transistor mismatch by considering the effect of a
mismatch in the transconductance gm. We assume gm1 and gm2 are the transconduc-
tance parameters of the two transistors in the diff-amp. We will assume that we can
write gm1 = gm + gm and gm2 = gm −gm. Again, using the small-signal equiva-
lent circuit shown in Figure 11.23, we ﬁnd the differential-mode voltage gain is
Ad = gm RD
(11.87(a))
and the common-mode gain is
Acm = RD(2gm)

(11.87(b))
The common-mode rejection ratio now becomes

The CMRR of mismatched elements in the MOSFET diff-amp is identical with the
results of mismatched elements in the BJT diff-amp.

exactly the same way as in the MOSFET diff-amp.

of the constant-current source and the small-signal resistances of Q1 and Q2 assumed to

DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER WITH ACTIVE LOAD 
Objective: • Analyze the characteristics of BJT and FET differential
ampliﬁers with active loads.
In Chapter 10, we considered an active load in conjunction with a simple transis-
tor ampliﬁer. Active loads can also be used in diff-amp circuits to increase the
differential-mode gain.
Active loads are essentially transistor current sources used in place of resistive
loads. The transistors in the active load circuit are biased at a Q-point in the forward-
active mode as shown in Figure 11.27. A change in collector current is induced by the
differential-pair, which, in turn, produces a change in the emitter–collector voltage as
shown in the ﬁgure. The relation between the change in current and change in volt-
age is proportional to the small-signal output resistance ro of the transistor. The value
of ro is, in general, much larger than that of a discrete resistive load, so the small-
signal voltage gain will be larger with the active load.

BJT Diff-Amp with Active Load
Figure 11.28 shows a differential ampliﬁer with an active load. Transistors Q1 and Q2
are the differential pair biased with a constant current IQ, and transistors Q3 and Q4
form the load circuit. From the collectors of Q2 and Q4, we obtain a one-sided output. 
If we assume all transistors are matched, then a pure applied common-mode
voltage means that vB1 = vB2 = vCM, and current IQ splits evenly between Q1 and
Q2. Neglecting base currents, I4 = I3 through the current-source circuit and I1 =
I2 = I3 = I4 = IQ/2 with no load connected at the output.

Figure 11.29 BJT differential ampliﬁer with three-
transistor active load and second gain stage
In actual diff-amp circuits, base currents are not zero. In addition, a second
ampliﬁer stage is connected at the diff-amp output. Figure 11.29 shows a diff-amp
with an active load circuit, corresponding to a three-transistor current source, as well
as a second amplifying stage. In general, the common–emitter current gain β is a
function of collector current, as was shown in Figure 6.21(c). However, for simplic-
ity, we assume all transistor current gains are equal, even though the current level in
Q5 is much smaller than in the other transistors. Current IO is the dc bias current from
the gain stage. Assuming all transistors are matched and vB1 = vB2 = vCM, current
IQ splits evenly and I1 = I2. To ensure that Q2 and Q4 are biased in the forward-
active mode, the dc currents must be balanced, or I3 = I4. We see that
IE5 = IB3 + IB4 = I3
β + I4
β
(11.93)
Then
IB5 =
IE5
1 + β =
I3 + I4

(11.94)
If the base currents and IO are small, then
I3 + I4 ∼= IQ
(11.95)

792

Therefore,
IB5 ∼=

β(1 + β)
(11.96)
For the circuit to be balanced, that is, for I1 = I2 and I3 = I4, we must have
IO = IB5 =
IQ
β(1 + β)
(11.97)
Equation (11.97) implies that the second amplifying stage must be designed and
biased such that the direction of the dc bias current is as shown and is equal to the
result of Equation (11.97). To illustrate this condition, we will analyze a second
amplifying stage using a Darlington pair, later in this chapter.
Small-Signal Analysis of BJT Active Load
Figure 11.30 shows a diff-amp with a three-transistor active load circuit. The resis-
tance RL represents the small-signal input resistance of the gain stage. We will assume
that a pure differential-mode input voltage is applied as shown in the ﬁgure. From
previous results, we know that the common-emitter terminals of Q1 and Q2 are at sig-
nal ground. The signal voltage at the base of Q1 produces a signal collector current
i1 = (gmvd)/2, where gm is the transistor transconductance for both Q1 and Q2.
Assuming the base currents are negligible, a signal current i3 = i1 is induced in Q3,
and the current mirror produces a signal current i4 equal to i3. The signal voltage at the
base of Q2 produces a signal collector current i2 = (gmvd)/2, with the direction
shown. The two signal currents, i2 and i4, add to produce a signal current in the load
resistance RL. The discussion is a ﬁrst-order evaluation of the circuit operation.

active load.
The output resistance looking back into the common collector node is Ro =
ro2∥ro4. To minimize loading effects, we need RL > Ro. However, since Ro is gener-
ally large for active loads, we may not be able to satisfy this condition. We can de-
termine the severity of the loading effect by comparing RL and Ro.

EXAMPLE 11.10
Objective: Determine the differential-mode gain of a diff-amp with an active load,
taking loading effects into account.
Consider the diff-amp in Figure 11.30, biased with IQ = 0.20 mA. Assume an
Early voltage of VA = 100 V for all transistors. Determine the open-circuit (RL = ∞)
differential-mode voltage gain, as well as the differential-mode voltage gain when
RL = 100 k.

An inspection of this last equation shows that the external load factor, 1/RL, domi-
nates the denominator term and thus has a tremendous inﬂuence on the gain.
Comment: The open-circuit differential-mode voltage gain, for a diff-amp with an
active load, is large. However, a ﬁnite load resistance RL causes severe loading
effects, as shown in this example. A 100 k load caused almost an order of magni-
tude decrease in the gain.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.10: The diff-amp circuit in Figure 11.30 is biased at IQ = 0.4 mA. The
transistor parameters are β = 120, VA1 = VA2 = 150 V, and VA3 = VA4 = 90 V.
(a) Determine the open-circuit (RL = ∞) differential-mode voltage gain. (b) Find
the differential-mode voltage gain when RL = 250 k. (c) Determine the
differential-mode input resistance. (d) Find the output resistance looking back

MOSFET Differential Ampliﬁer with Active Load
We can use an active load in conjunction with a MOSFET differential pair, as we did
for the bipolar differential ampliﬁer. Figure 11.32 shows a MOSFET diff-amp with
an active load. Transistors M1 and M2 are n-channel devices and form the differential

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers
795
pair biased with IQ. The load circuit consists of transistors M3 and M4, both p-channel
devices, connected in a current mirror conﬁguration. A one-sided output is taken
from the common drains of M2 and M4. When a common-mode voltage of
v1 = v2 = vcm is applied, the current IQ splits evenly between M1 and M2, and
iD1 = iD2 = IQ/2. There are no gate currents; therefore, iD3 = iD1 and iD4 = iD2.
If a small differential-mode input voltage vd = v1 −v2 is applied, then from
Equation (11.66) and (11.67), we can write
iD1 = IQ
2 + id
(11.102(a))
and
iD2 = IQ
2 −id
(11.102(b))
where id is the signal current. For small values of vd, we have id = (gmvd)/2. Since
M1 and M3 are in series, we see that
iD3 = iD1 = IQ
2 + id
(11.103)
Finally, the current mirror consisting of M3 and M4 produces 
iD4 = iD3 = IQ
2 + id
(11.104)
Figure 11.33 is the ac equivalent circuit of the diff-amp with active load, showing the
signal currents. The negative sign for iD2 in Equation (11.102(b)) shows up as a
change in current direction in M2, as indicated in the ﬁgure.
Figure 11.34(a) shows the small-signal equivalent circuit at the drain node of M2
and M4. If the output is connected to the gate of another MOSFET, which is equiva-
lent to an inﬁnite impedance at low frequency, the output terminal is effectively an
open circuit. The circuit can be rearranged by combining the signal grounds at a
common point, as shown in Figure 11.34(b). Then,

DESIGN EXAMPLE 11.11
Objective: Design a MOSFET diff-amp with the conﬁguration in Figure 11.32 to
meet the speciﬁcations of the experimental system in Example 11.4.
Design Approach: We need not only to try to obtain the necessary differential-mode
gain and minimize the common-mode gain in our design, but we must also be
cognizant of the swing in the output voltage. In the circuit in Figure 11.32, if the cor-
responding PMOS and NMOS transistors are matched, then the quiescent value of
VSD4 is equal to VSG4 = VSG3. As the signal output voltage increases, the source-to-
drain voltage of M4 decreases. The minimum value of this voltage such that M4
remains biased in the saturation region is VSD4(min) = VSD4(sat) = VSG + VT P .
This means that the maximum swing in the output voltage is equal to the magnitude
of the threshold voltage of M4. In this example, the maximum swing in the output
voltage is 0.8 V, so that the magnitude of the threshold voltages of the PMOS devices
must be greater than 0.8 V. Assume that NMOS devices are available with the fol-
lowing parameters: VT N = 0.5 V, k′
n = 80 μA/V2, and λn = 0.02 V−1. Assume that

which yields a width-to-length ratio of (W/L)n = 10 for the NMOS differential pair.
Since the width-to-length ratios of the other transistors do not directly affect the gain
of the diff-amp, we may arbitrarily choose width-to-length ratios of 10 for all other
transistors except M5 and M6. The W/L ratio of 10 means that the other devices are
reasonably small and do not lead to a large circuit area.

may choose M4 and M3 to be identical so that the current in the reference portion of

798

the circuit is also 200 μA. Assuming that M5 and M6 are identical, then each transis-
tor must have a gate-to-source voltage of

which yields

Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: The circuit in Figure 11.35 was used in the com-
puter simulation veriﬁcation. In the hand design, the ﬁnite output resistance (lambda
parameter) was neglected in the dc calculations. These parameters became important
in the actual design and in the actual currents developed in the circuit. For
(W/L)5 = (W/L)6 = 0.75, the reference current is IREF = 231 μA and the bias
current is IQ = 208 μA.
The differential-mode voltage gain is approximately 102 so that the signal out-
put voltage is 0.82 V for a differential-mode input signal voltage of 8 mV. The
common-mode output signal is approximately 0.86 mV, which is well within the
speciﬁed 10 mV maximum value.
Design Pointer: The body effect has been neglected in this design. In actual inte-
grated circuits, the differential pair transistors may actually be fabricated within their
own p-type substrate region (for NMOS devices). This p-type substrate region is then
directly connected to the source terminals so that the body effect in the NMOS
differential pair devices can be neglected. 
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.11: Determine IREF, IQ, and Ad of the diff-amp designed in Example 11.11
for the case when the bias voltages are changed to V + = +3 V and V −= −3 V.
(Ans. IREF = IQ = 56.37 μA, Ad = 188)
MOSFET Diff-Amp with Cascode Active Load
The differential-mode voltage gain is proportional to the output resistance looking into
the active load transistor. The voltage gain can be increased, therefore, if the output
resistance can be increased. An increase in output resistance can be achieved by using,
for example, a cascode active load. This conﬁguration is shown in Figure 11.36.
The output resistance Ro was considered in the last section in the discussion
of the cascode current source. As applied to Figure 11.36, the output resistance is
given by
Ro = ro4 + ro6(1 + gmro4) ∼= gmro4ro6

The differential-mode voltage gain is then found to be
Ad = gm(ro2∥Ro) = (0.40)(500∥101000) = 200
Comment: Since Ro ≫ro2, the voltage gain is now essentially equal to Ad = gmro2
which is twice as large as the gain calculated in Example 11.11.

Thus far, we have considered two basic ampliﬁer design technologies: the bipolar
technology, which uses npn and pnp bipolar junction transistors; and the MOS
technology, which uses NMOS and PMOS ﬁeld-effect transistors. We showed that
bipolar transistors have a larger transconductance than MOSFETs biased at the same
current levels, and that, in general, bipolar ampliﬁers have larger voltage gains. We
also showed that MOSFET circuits have an essentially inﬁnite input impedance at
low frequencies, which implies a zero input bias current.
These advantages of the two technologies can be exploited by combining bipo-
lar and MOS transistors in the same integrated circuit. The technology is called
BiCMOS. BiCMOS technology is especially useful in digital circuit design, but also
has applications in analog circuits. In this section, we will examine basic BiCMOS
analog circuit conﬁgurations.
Basic Ampliﬁer Stages
A bipolar multitransistor circuit previously studied is the Darlington pair conﬁgura-
tion. Figure 11.38(a) shows a modiﬁed Darlington pair conﬁguration, in which the
bias current IBIAS, or some equivalent element, is used to control the quiescent

current in Q1. This Darlington pair circuit is used to boost the effective current gain
of bipolar transistors. There is no comparable conﬁguration in FET circuits.
A potentially useful BiCMOS circuit is shown in Figure 11.38(b). Transistor Q1
in the Darlington pair is replaced with a MOSFET. The advantages of this conﬁgura-
tion are an inﬁnite input resistance, and a large transconductance due to the bipolar
transistor Q2.
To analyze the circuit, we consider the small-signal equivalent circuit shown in
Figure 11.39. We assume that ro = ∞in both transistors.
The output signal current is 
Io = gm1Vgs + gm2Vπ
(11.111)
We see that
Vi = Vgs + Vπ
(11.112)
and
Vπ = gm1Vgsrπ
(11.113)
Combining Equations (11.112) and (11.113) produces
Vgs =
Vi
1 + gm1rπ
(11.114)
From Equation (11.111), the output current can now be written
Io = gm1Vgs + gm2(gm1rπ)Vgs = (gm1 + gm2gm1rπ)Vgs
(11.115)
Substituting Equation (11.114) into (11.115), we obtain
Io = gm1(1 + gm2rπ)
(1 + gm1rπ)
· Vi = gc
m · Vi
(11.116)
where gc
m is the composite transconductance. Since gm2 of the bipolar transistor
is usually at least an order of magnitude greater than gm1 of the MOSFET, the
composite transconductance is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that
of the MOSFET alone. We now have the advantages of a large transconductance and
an inﬁnite input resistance.
A bipolar cascode circuit is shown in Figure 11.40(a); a corresponding BiCMOS
conﬁguration is shown in Figure 11.40(b). The output resistance of the cascode
circuit is very high, as we saw in Chapter 10. Also, the cascode ampliﬁer has a wider

frequency bandwidth than the common-emitter circuit, since the input resistance
looking into the emitter of Q2 is very low, thereby minimizing the Miller multiplica-
tion effect. This effect was observed in Chapter 7.
Again, the advantage of the BiCMOS circuit is the inﬁnite input resistance of
M1. The equivalent resistance looking into the emitter of a bipolar transistor is much
less than the resistance looking into the source of a MOSFET; therefore, the fre-
quency response of a BiCMOS cascode circuit is superior to that of an all-MOSFET
cascode circuit.
Current Sources
In our previous discussions of constant-current sources, we mentioned that cascode
current sources increase the output resistance, as well as the stability of the bias
current. Figure 11.41 shows a bipolar cascode conﬁguration in which the output
resistance is Ro ∼= βro4. The bias current in this circuit is much more stable against
variations in output voltage than the basic two-transistor current source.
A BiCMOS double cascode constant-current source is shown in Figure 11.42.
The small-signal equivalent circuit for determining output resistance is shown in

Figure 11.43(a). The gate voltage to M6 and the base voltages to Q2 and Q4 are
constants, equivalent to signal ground. Also, since Vπ2 = 0, then gm6Vπ2 = 0, and
the equivalent circuit can be rearranged as shown in Figure 11.43(b).
The output resistance of this circuit is extremely large. A detailed analysis shows
that the output resistance is given approximately by
Ro ∼= (gm6ro6)(βro4)
(11.117)
The output resistance is increased by a factor (gmro6) compared to the bipolar cascode
circuit in Figure 11.41. If a bipolar transistor were to be used in place of M6, then a re-
sistance rπ6 would be connected across the terminals indicated by Vgs6. This resistance
would effectively eliminate the multiplying constant (gm6ro6), and the output resis-
tance would be essentially the same as that of the circuit in Figure 11.41. The BiCMOS
circuit, then, increases the output resistance compared to an all-bipolar circuit.
BiCMOS Differential Ampliﬁer
A basic BiCMOS differential ampliﬁer, with a constant-current source bias and a
bipolar active load, is shown in Figure 11.44. Again, the primary advantages are
the inﬁnite input resistance and the zero input bias current. One disadvantage of a
MOSFET input stage is a relatively high offset voltage compared to that of a bipolar
input circuit. Offset voltages occur when the differential-pair input transistors are
mismatched. In Chapter 14, we will examine the effect of offset voltages, as well as
nonzero bias currents, in op-amp circuits. 
We will consider additional BiCMOS op-amp circuits in Chapter 13, when we
discuss the analysis and design of full op-amp circuits.

GAIN STAGE AND SIMPLE OUTPUT STAGE 
Objective: • Analyze an example of a gain stage and output stage of
a multistage ampliﬁer.
A diff-amp, including those previously discussed, is the input stage of virtually all
op-amps. The second op-amp stage, or gain stage, is often a Darlington pair conﬁg-
uration, and the third, or output, stage is normally an emitter follower.

Figure 11.46 shows a BJT diff-amp with a three-transistor active load, a Darlington
pair connected to the diff-amp output, and a simple emitter-follower output stage.

The differential-pair transistors are biased with a Widlar current source at a bias
current IQ. We noted previously that, for the diff-amp dc currents to be balanced, we
must have

In order for IO = IB5, we must require that IC7 = IQ. This means that the emitter
resistors of Q10 and Q11 should have the same value. Transistor Q11 also acts as an
active load for the Darlington pair gain stage. 
Transistor Q8 and resistor R4 form the simple emitter-follower output stage. The
emitter-follower ampliﬁer minimizes loading effects because its output resistance is
small.
Ideally, when the diff-amp input is a pure common-mode signal, the output vo is
zero. The combination of Q7 and Q11 allows the dc level to shift. By slightly chang-
ing the bias current IC7, we can vary voltages VEC7 and VC E11 such that vo = 0. The
small variation of IC7 required to achieve the necessary dc level shift will not signif-
icantly change the balance between IO and IB5. As we will see in later chapters, other
forms of level shifters could also be used.
Input Impedance, Voltage Gain, 
and Output Impedance
The input resistance of the Darlington pair determines the loading effect on the basic
diff-amp. In addition, the gain of the Darlington pair affects the overall gain of the
op-amp circuit, and the output resistance of the emitter follower determines any load-
ing effects on the output signal.
Figure 11.47(a) is the ac equivalent circuit of the Darlington pair, where RL7 is
the effective resistance connected between the collector of Q7 and signal ground.
Figure 11.47(b) shows the simple hybrid-π model of the Darlington pair. We see that
the equivalent circuits for Q6 and Q7 have been effectively turned upside down
compared to the transistors in Figure 11.47(a).

tion (11.120), we obtain
Vb6 = Ib6rπ6 + rπ7(1 + β)Ib6
(11.123)
The input resistance is therefore

RL7
(11.130)
In Figure 11.46, we see that resistance RL7 is the parallel combination of the
resistance looking into the collector of Q11 and the resistance looking into the base of
Q8. From Chapter 10, the resistance looking into the collector of Q11 is
Rc11 = ro11(1 + gm11R′
E)
(11.131)

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers
809
where R′
E = rπ11∥R3. The resistance looking into the base of Q8 is
Rb8 = rπ8 + (1 + β)R4 .
(11.132)
Equations (11.131) and (11.132) indicate that resistances Rc11 and Rb8 are large,
which means that the effective resistance RL7 is also large.
EXAMPLE 11.13
Objective: Calculate the input resistance and the small-signal voltage gain of a
Darlington pair.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 11.46, with parameters IC7 = IQ =
0.2 mA, IC8 = 1 mA, R4 = 10 k, and R3 = 0.2 k. Assume β = 100 for all tran-
sistors, and the Early voltage for Q11 is 100 V.
Solution: The input resistance, given by Equation (11.126), is
Ri = 2(1 + β)βVT
IQ
= 2(101)(100)(0.026)
0.2
⇒2.63 M
The small-signal voltage gain is a function of RL7, which in turn is a function of Rc11
and Rb8. We can ﬁnd that
rπ11 = βVT /IQ = (100)(0.026)/0.2 = 13 k
such that
R′
E = 13∥0.2 = 0.197 k
Also
gm11 = IQ/VT = 0.2/0.026 = 7.69 mA/V
and
ro11 = VA/IQ = 100/0.2 = 500 k
Therefore,
Rc11 = ro11(1 + gm11R′
E) = 500 [1 + (7.69)(0.197)] ⇒1.26 M
We can determine that
rπ8 = βVT /IC8 = (100)(0.026)/1 = 2.6 k
Then
Rb8 = rπ8 + (1 + β)R4 = 2.6 + (101)(10) ⇒1.01 M
Consequently, resistance RL7 is
RL7 = Rc11∥Rb8 = 1.26∥1.01 = 0.561 M

Comment: The input resistance of the Darlington pair is in the megohm range,
which should minimize severe loading effects on the diff-amp. In addition, the small-
signal gain is large because of the active load (Q11) and the large input resistance of
the emitter-follower output stage.
EXERCISE PROBLEM

current gain of the Darlington pair, Ic7/Ib6. Use the parameters described in
Example 11.13. (Ans. (101)(100) = 1.01 × 104)

(11.133)
where Z is the equivalent impedance, or resistance, in the base of Q8. In this case,
Z = Rc11∥Rc7, where Rc7 is the resistance looking into the collector of Q7. Because
of the factor (1 + β) in the denominator, the output resistance of the emitter follower
is normally small, as previously determined.
EXAMPLE 11.14
Objective: Calculate the output resistance of the circuit in Figure 11.46.
Consider the same circuit and transistor parameters described in Example 11.13.
Assume the Early voltage of Q7 is 100 V.
Solution: From Example 11.13, we have that Rc11 = 1.26 M and rπ8 = 2.6 k.
We can then determine that
Rc7 = VA

a Darlington pair emitter-follower output stage in which the output resistance is on
the order of 100 .

A BJT diff-amp with an active load can produce a small-signal differential-
mode voltage gain on the order of 103, and the Darlington pair can also provide a
voltage gain on the order of 103. Since the emitter follower has a gain of essentially
unity, the overall voltage gain of the op-amp circuit is on the order of 106. This value
is typical for the low-frequency, open-loop gain of op-amp circuits.

SIMPLIFIED BJT OPERATIONAL 
AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT
Objective: • Analyze a simpliﬁed multistage bipolar ampliﬁer.
An operational ampliﬁer (op-amp) is a multistage circuit composed of a differential
ampliﬁer input stage, a gain stage, and an output stage. In this section, we will
consider a simpliﬁed BJT op-amp circuit.

812
Part 2
Analog Electronics
Although active load devices increase the gain of an ampliﬁer, in this discussion,
we will consider resistive loads, in order to simplify the analysis and design. For the
bipolar circuit, all component values are given; we will analyze both the dc and ac
circuit characteristics.
Figure 11.49. depicts a simple bipolar operational ampliﬁer. The differential
ampliﬁer stage is biased with a Widlar current source, and a one-sided output is
connected to the Darlington pair gain stage. An emitter bypass capacitor CE is
included to increase the small-signal voltage gain. The output stage is an emitter
follower. In general, we want the dc value of the output voltage to be zero when the
input voltage is zero. To accomplish this, we need to insert a dc level shifting circuit
between the voltage vO3 and the output voltage vO.

Objective: Analyze the dc characteristics of the bipolar op-amp circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 11.49. Neglect base currents and, as a simpliﬁcation,
assume VBE(on) = 0.7 V for all transistors except Q8 and Q9 in the Widlar circuit.

The bias current IQ is determined from
IQ R2 = VT ln
 I1

and is
IQ = 0.4 mA

Chapter 11 Differential and Multistage Ampliﬁers
813
The collector currents are then
IC1 = IC2 = 0.2 mA
The dc voltage at the collector of Q2 is
VO2 = 10 −IC2RC = 10 −(0.2)(20) = 6 V
With these circuit parameters, the common-mode input voltage is limited to the range
−8.6 ≤vCM ≤6 V, which will keep all transistors biased in the forward-active mode.
The current IR4 is determined to be
IR4 = VO2 −2VBE(on)
R4
= 6 −1.4
11.5
= 0.4 mA
Since base currents are assumed negligible, the current IR5 is IR5 ∼= IR4.
The dc voltage at the collectors of Q3 and Q4 is then
VO3 = 10 −IR5R5 = 10 −(0.4)(5) = 8 V
This shows us that the dc voltage VO3 is midway between the 10 V supply voltage
and the dc input voltage VO2 = 6 V to Q3. This allows a maximum symmetrical
swing in the time-varying voltage at vo3.
Transistor Q5 and resistor R6 form the dc voltage level shifting function. Since
R3 = R2, we have
IR6 = IQ = 0.4 mA
The dc voltage at the base of Q6 is found to be
VB6 = VO3 −VBE(on) −IR6R6 = 8 −0.7 −(0.4)(16.5) = 0.7 V
This relationship produces a zero dc output voltage when a zero differential-mode
voltage is applied at the input.
Finally, current IR7 is
IR7 = vo −(−10)
R7
= 10
5 = 2 mA
Comment: The dc analysis of this simpliﬁed op-amp circuit proceeds in much the
same way as in previous examples. We observe that all transistors are biased in
the forward-active mode.

resistances to the Darlington pair Ri2 and to the output stage Ri3 are indicated in Figure
11.49. The one-sided differential-mode voltage gain of the diff-amp is given by
Ad1 = Vo2
vd
= gm
2 (RC∥Ri2)
where Ri2 is the input resistance of the Darlington pair, as follows:
Ri2 = rπ3 + (1 + β)rπ4
where
rπ4 = βVT /IR4 = (100)(0.026)/0.4 = 6.5 k
and
rπ3 ∼= β2VT /IR4 = (100)2(0.026)/0.4 = 650 k
Therefore,
Ri2 = 650 + (101)(6.5) = 1307 k
The transistor transconductance is
gm = IQ

The gain of the differential ampliﬁer stage is therefore


[20∥1307] = 75.8
Since the load resistance Ri2 ≫RC, there is no signiﬁcant loading effect of the sec-
ond stage on the diff-amp stage.
From previous results, we know the voltage gain of the Darlington pair is given by
A2 =

(R5∥Ri3)
where
Ri3 = rπ5 + (1 + β)[R6 + rπ6 + (1 + β)R7]
We ﬁnd that
rπ5 = βVT /IR6 = (100)(0.026)/0.4 = 6.5 k
and
rπ6 = βVT /IR7 = (100)(0.026)/2 = 1.3 k
Therefore
Ri3 = 6.5 + (101)[16.5 + 1.3 + (101)(5)] ⇒52.8 M
Since Ri3 ≫R5, the output stage does not load down the gain stage, and the small-
signal voltage gain is approximately

The combination of Q5 and Q6 forms an emitter follower, and the gain of the output
stage is
A3 = vo/vo3 ∼= 1
The overall small-signal voltage gain is therefore
Ad = Ad1 · A2 · A3 = (75.8)(38.5)(1) = 2918
Comment: From our previous discussion, we know that the overall gain can be
increased substantially by using active loads. Yet, the analysis of this simpliﬁed
circuit provides some insight into the design of multistage circuits, as well as the
overall small-signal voltage gain of op-amp circuits.
Computer Correlation: A PSpice analysis was performed on the bipolar op-amp
circuit in Figure 11.49. The dc output voltage from this analysis was VO =
−0.333 V, rather than the desired value of zero. This occurred because the B–E volt-
ages were not exactly 0.7 V, as assumed in the hand analysis. A zero output voltage
can be obtained by slightly adjusting R6. The differential voltage gain was
Ad = 2932, which agrees very well with the hand analysis.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 11.16: Consider the simple bipolar op-amp circuit in Figure 11.49 with circuit
and transistor parameters given in Exercise Problem Ex11.15. Determine the
input resistances Ri2 and Ri3, and the differential-mode voltage gain Ad = vo/vd.
(Ans. Ri2 = 870 k, Ri3 = 21.0 M, Ad = 11,729)
Problem-Solving Technique: Multistage Circuits
1.
Perform the dc analysis of the circuit to determine the small-signal parame-
ters of the transistors. In most cases BJT base currents can be neglected. This
assumption will normally provide sufﬁcient accuracy for a hand analysis.
2.
Perform the ac analysis on each stage of the circuit, taking into account the
loading effect of the following stage. (In many cases, previous results of
small-signal analyses can be used directly.)
3.
The overall small-signal voltage gain or current gain is the product of the
gains of the individual stages as long as the loading effect of each stage is
taken into account.

DIFF-AMP FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Objective: • Analyze the frequency response of the differential
ampliﬁer.
In Chapter 7, we considered the frequency responses of the three basic ampliﬁer
conﬁgurations. In this section, we will analyze the frequency response of the differ-
ential ampliﬁer. Since the diff-amp is a linear circuit, we can determine the frequency

response due to: (a) a pure differential-mode input signal, (b) a pure common-mode
input signal, and (c) the total or net result, using superposition.
Due to Differential-Mode Input Signal
Consider the basic bipolar diff-amp shown in Figure 11.50(a). The input is a pure
differential-mode input signal. We know from Equation (11.24) that the small-signal
voltage ve is at signal ground when a differential-mode input signal is applied. To
determine the frequency response, we evaluate the equivalent common-emitter half-
circuit in Figure 11.50(b).

(11.135)
where CM is the equivalent Miller capacitance given by
CM = Cμ(1 + gm RC)
(11.136)
Equation (11.136) implies that, if the value of RC is fairly large, the Miller
capacitance will signiﬁcantly affect the bandwidth of the differential ampliﬁer.

Due to Common-Mode Input Signal
Figure 11.51(a) shows the basic diff-amp with a pure common-mode input signal.
The circuit is symmetrical, which means that resistors RB, resistors RC, and the tran-
sistors are effectively in parallel. Figure 11.51(b) is the small-signal equivalent
circuit, with the constant-current source replaced by its output resistance Ro and
capacitance Co.

Equation (11.139(b)) shows that there is a zero in the common-mode gain. To
explain, capacitor Co is in parallel with Ro, and it acts as a bypass capacitor. At very
low frequency, Co is effectively an open circuit and the common-mode signal “sees”
Ro. As the frequency increases, the impedance of the capacitor decreases and Ro is
effectively bypassed; hence, the zero in Equation (11.139(b)). The frequency ana-
lysis of an emitter bypass capacitor also showed the presence of a zero in the voltage
gain expression.
The common-mode gain frequency response is shown in Figure 11.52. The
frequency of the zero is
fz =
1
2π RoCo
(11.140)
Since the output resistance Ro of a constant-current source is normally large, a small
capacitance Co can result in a small fz. For frequencies greater than fz, the common-
mode gain increases at the rate of 6 dB/octave.

Equation (11.139(b)) also shows that there is a pole associated with the
common-mode gain. Rearranging the terms in that equation, we see that the fre-

The denominator of Equation (11.142) is very large, because of the term (1 + β)Ro.
This implies that Req is small, which means that the frequency fp of the pole is very large.
The differential-mode gain is shown in Figure 11.53. The frequency response of
the common-mode rejection ratio is found by combining Figures 11.52 and 11.53,
and is shown in Figure 11.54.

EXAMPLE 11.17
Objective: Determine the zero and pole frequencies in the common-mode gain.
Consider a diff-amp biased with a constant-current source. The output resistance
is Ro = 10 M and the output capacitance is Co = 1 pF. Assume the circuit and
transistor parameters are RB = 0.5 k, rπ = 10 k, and β = 100.
Solution: In the common-mode gain, the frequency of the zero is
fz =

2π(10 × 106)(1 × 10−12) ⇒15.9 kHz

or
Req = 51.98 
The frequency of the pole is therefore
fP =
1
2π(51.98)(1 × 10−12) ⇒3.06 GHz
Comment: The frequency of the zero in the common-mode gain is fairly low, while
the frequency of the pole is extremely large. The relatively low frequency of the zero
justiﬁes neglecting the effect of Cπ and Cμ. The CMRR frequency response is shown
in Figure 11.54, where fz is the zero frequency of the common-mode gain and fH is
the upper 3 dB frequency of the differential-mode gain.

constant current source is Co = 0.2 pF. (Ans. fz = 79.6 kHz, fp = 15.3 GHz)

With Emitter-Degeneration Resistors
Figure 11.55 shows a bipolar diff-amp with two resistances RE connected in the
emitter portion of the circuit. One effect of including an emitter resistor is to reduce
the voltage gain, so the presence of these resistors is termed emitter degeneration.
In Chapter 7, we found that an emitter-follower circuit, which includes an emit-
ter resistance, is a wide-bandwidth ampliﬁer. Therefore, one effect of resistors RE
is an increase in the bandwidth of the differential ampliﬁer. We rely on a computer
simulation to evaluate emitter degeneration effects.

Figure 11.56 PSpice results for frequency response 
of diff-amp with emitter-degeneration
Figure 11.56 shows the frequency response of a one-sided differential-mode
gain, obtained from a PSpice analysis for four RE resistance values. The diff-amp
is biased at IQ = 0.5 mA and the RC resistors are RC = 30 k. The transistor
capacitances are Cπ = 34.6 pF and Cμ = 4.3 pF. As the emitter degeneration in-
creases, the differential-mode voltage gain decreases, but the bandwidth increases, as
previously indicated. The ﬁgure-of-merit for ampliﬁers, the gain-bandwidth product,
is approximately a constant for the results shown in Figure 11.56.
With Active Load
Figure 11.57 shows a bipolar diff-amp with an active load and a single input at v1.
The base and collector junctions of Q3 are connected together, and a one-sided out-
put is taken at vO2.
With the connection of Q3, the equivalent load resistance in the collector of Q1
is on the order of rπ/(1 + β). This small resistance minimizes the Miller multiplica-
tion factor in Q1. Also, with the base of Q2 at ground potential, one side of Cμ2 is
grounded, and the Miller multiplication in Q2 is zero. Therefore, we expect the band-
width of the diff-amp with an active load to be relatively wide. At high frequencies,
however, the effective impedance in the collector of Q1 also includes the input

Figure 11.58 PSpice results for frequency response 
of diff-amp with active load and single-sided input
capacitances of Q3 and Q4. These additional capacitances also affect the frequency
response of the diff-amp, potentially narrowing the bandwidth.
Again, we rely on a computer analysis to determine the frequency characteristics
of the diff-amp with an active load. Figure 11.58 shows the results of the computer
simulation. The diff-amp is biased at IQ = 0.5 mA, and the Early voltage of each
transistor is assumed to be 80 V. The transistor capacitances are Cπ = 34.6 pF for
each transistor, Cμ = 3.8 pF in Q1 and Q2, and Cμ = 7 pF and 5.5 pF in Q3 and Q4,
respectively.
The low-frequency voltage gain is 1560 and the upper 3 dB frequency is 64 kHz.
The large gain is as expected for an active load ampliﬁer, but the 3 dB frequency is
lower than expected. However, the gain–bandwidth product for the active load diff-
amp is approximately four times that of the diff-amp shown in Figure 11.55. The
increased gain–bandwidth product implies a reduced Miller multiplication factor in
the active load diff-amp, as predicted.

DESIGN APPLICATION: A CMOS DIFF-AMP
Objective: • Design a CMOS diff-amp with an output gain stage to
meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: Design a CMOS diff-amp with an output stage. The magnitude of
voltage gain of each stage is to be at least 600. Bias currents are to be IQ = IREF =
100 μA, and biasing of the circuit is to be V + = 2.5 V and V −= −2.5 V.
Design Approach: The circuit to be designed has the conﬁguration shown in Fig-
ure 11.59. The diff-amp has NMOS amplifying transistors and a PMOS active load.
The diff-amp is biased with a cascode current source to provide a large output resis-
tance. The gain stage is a PMOS transistor in a common source conﬁguration that
also has an active load.

We will assume that several sets of transistors are matched. In particular, we will
assume that M1 to M4, M11, and M12 are matched; M7 and M8 are matched; M5 and M6
are matched; and M9 and M10 are matched.

We will also, somewhat arbitrarily, make the width-to-length ratios of all other tran-

gate-to-source voltages of M1 and M3 are found from
IREF = 100 = 80
2 (45)(VGS1 −0.5)2

The second stage voltage gain is then
A2 = −0.849(1000∥851,000) = −849
Solution (Overall Voltage Gain): Since there is no loading of the second stage on
the diff-amp circuit, the overall voltage gain is
Av = Ad A2 = (600)(−849) = −5.094 × 105
Comment: We may note that the ampliﬁer we have just designed is an all MOSFET
circuit. The circuit contains no resistors. An all-transistor circuit is one of the advan-
tages of MOS transistors.
We may also note that a large voltage gain can be obtained from a circuit using
active loads.

SUMMARY
•
The ideal transistor differential ampliﬁer ampliﬁes only the difference between
two input signals.
•
The differential-mode input voltage is deﬁned as the difference between the two
input signals and the common-mode input voltage is deﬁned as the average of
the two input signals.
•
When a differential input voltage is applied, one transistor of the differential pair
turns on more than the second transistor of the differential pair so that the cur-
rents become unbalanced, producing a signal output voltage.
•
A common-mode output signal is generated when the output resistance of the
current source is ﬁnite rather than ideally inﬁnite.
•
The common-mode rejection ratio, CMRR, is deﬁned in terms of decibels as
CMRRdB = 20 log10 |Ad/Acm|, where Ad and Acm are the differential-mode volt-
age gain and common-mode voltage gain, respectively.
•
Differential ampliﬁers are usually designed with active loads to increase the
differential-mode voltage gain.
•
BiCMOS circuits may be designed to incorporate the best parameters and char-
acteristics of BJTs and MOSFETs in the same circuit.
•
A BJT Darlington pair is typically used as a second stage in a BJT diff-amp. The
input impedance is large, which tends to minimize loading effects on the diff-amp,
and the effective current gain of the pair is the product of the individual gains.
•
As an application, a CMOS diff-amp with an output gain stage was designed to
meet a set of speciﬁcations.

Chapter
851
Previously, we found that the small-signal voltage gain and other characteristics of
BJT and MOSFET circuit ampliﬁers are functions of, for example, the bipolar cur-
rent gain and the MOSFET conduction parameter. In general, these transistor para-
meters vary with temperature and have a range of values for a given type of transistor,
because of processing and material property tolerances. These parameter variations
mean that the Q-point, voltage gain, and other circuit properties can vary from one
circuit to another, and can be functions of temperature.
Transistor circuit characteristics can be made essentially independent of the
individual transistor parameters by using feedback. The feedback process takes a
portion of the output signal and returns it to the input to become part of the input
excitation. We previously encountered feedback in our study of ideal op-amps and
op-amp circuits. For example, resistors are connected between the output and input
terminals of an ideal op-amp to form a feedback network. The voltage gain of these
ideal circuits is a function only of the ratio of resistors and not of any individual tran-
sistor parameters. In this chapter, we formally study feedback and feedback circuits.

•
Introduce feedback concepts and discuss, in general terms, advantages and
disadvantages of using feedback in electronic circuits.

characteristics of the feedback system.

ﬁers, and transresistance feedback ampliﬁers.

feedback circuits can be stabilized.

INTRODUCTION TO FEEDBACK
Objective: • Introduce feedback concepts and discuss, in general
terms, a few advantages and disadvantages of using feedback in
electronic circuits.
Feedback is used in virtually all ampliﬁer systems. Harold Black, an electronics en-
gineer with the Western Electric Company, invented the feedback ampliﬁer in 1928
while searching for methods to stabilize the gain of ampliﬁers for use in telephone re-
peaters. In a feedback system, a signal that is proportional to the output is fed back to
the input and combined with the input signal to produce a desired system response.
As we will see, external feedback is used deliberately to achieve particular system
beneﬁts. However, feedback may be unintentional and an undesired system response
may be produced.
We have already seen examples of feedback in previous chapters, although the
term feedback may not have been used. For example, in Chapters 3 and 5 we intro-
duced resistors at the emitter of BJT common-emitter circuits and at the source of
MOSFET common-source circuits to stabilize the Q-point against variations in tran-
sistor parameters. This technique introduces negative feedback in the circuit. An
increase in collector or drain current produces an increase in the voltage across
these resistors which produces a decrease in the base-emitter or gate-source voltage.
The decrease in these device voltages tends to reduce or oppose the change in col-
lector or drain current. Opposition to change is suggested by use of the term negative
feedback.
Feedback can be either negative or positive. In negative feedback, a portion of
the output signal is subtracted from the input signal; in positive feedback, a portion
of the output signal is added to the input signal. Negative feedback, for example,
tends to maintain a constant value of ampliﬁer voltage gain against variations in tran-
sistor parameters, supply voltages, and temperature. Positive feedback is used in the
design of oscillators and in a number of other applications. In this chapter, we will
concentrate on negative feedback.
Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Negative Feedback
Before we actually get into the analysis and design of feedback circuits, we will list
some of the advantages and disadvantages of negative feedback. Although these
characteristics and properties of negative feedback are not obvious at this point, they
are listed here so that the reader can anticipate these results during the derivations
and analysis.
Advantages
1.
Gain sensitivity. Variations in the circuit transfer function (gain) as a result of
changes in transistor parameters are reduced by feedback. This reduction in
sensitivity is one of the most attractive features of negative feedback.
2.
Bandwidth extension. The bandwidth of a circuit that incorporates negative
feedback is larger than that of the basic ampliﬁer.
12.1.1

3.
Noise sensitivity. Negative feedback may increase the signal-to-noise ratio if
noise is generated within the feedback loop.
4.
Reduction of nonlinear distortion. Since transistors have nonlinear character-
istics, distortion may appear in the output signals, especially at large signal
levels. Negative feedback reduces this distortion.
5.
Control of impedance levels. The input and output impedances can be in-
creased or decreased with the proper type of negative feedback circuit.
Disadvantages
1.
Circuit gain. The overall ampliﬁer gain, with negative feedback, is reduced
compared to the basic ampliﬁer used in the circuit.
2.
Stability. There is a possibility that the feedback circuit may become unstable
(oscillate) at high frequencies.
These advantages and disadvantages will be further discussed as we develop the
feedback theory.
In the course of our discussion, we will analyze several feedback circuits, in both
discrete and op-amp circuit conﬁgurations. First, however, we will consider the ideal
feedback theory and derive the general characteristics of feedback ampliﬁers. In this
section, we discuss the ideal signal gain, gain sensitivity, bandwidth extension, noise
sensitivity, and reduction of nonlinear distortion of a generalized feedback ampliﬁer.
Use of Computer Simulation
Conventional methods of analysis that have been used in the previous chapters apply
directly to feedback circuits. That is, the same dc analysis techniques and the same
small-signal transistor equivalent circuits apply directly to feedback circuits in this
chapter. However, in the analysis of feedback circuits, several simultaneous equa-
tions can be obtained, the time involved may be quite long and the probability of in-
troducing errors may become almost certain.
Therefore, computer simulation of feedback circuits may prove to be very use-
ful and is used fairly often throughout this chapter. As always, a word of warning is
in order concerning computer simulation. Computer simulation does not replace
basic understanding. It is important for the reader to understand the concepts and
characteristics of the basic types of feedback circuits. Computer simulation is used
only as a tool for obtaining speciﬁc results.
12.2
BASIC FEEDBACK CONCEPTS
Objective: • Analyze and obtain the transfer function of the ideal
feedback system, and determine a few characteristics (advantages) of
the feedback system.
Figure 12.1 shows the basic conﬁguration of a feedback ampliﬁer. In the diagram, the
various signals S can be either currents or voltages. The circuit contains a basic
ampliﬁer with an open-loop gain A and a feedback circuit that samples the output

Figure 12.1 Basic conﬁguration of a feedback ampliﬁer
signal and produces a feedback signal Sf b. The feedback signal is subtracted from the
input source signal, which produces an error signal Sε. The error signal is the input
to the basic ampliﬁer and is the signal that is ampliﬁed to produce the output signal.
The subtraction property produces the negative feedback.
Implicit in the diagram in Figure 12.1 is the assumption that the input signal is
transmitted through the ampliﬁer only, none through the feedback network, and that the
output signal is transmitted back through the feedback network only, none through the
ampliﬁer. Also, there are no loading effects in the ideal feedback system. The feedback
network does not load down the output of the basic ampliﬁer, and the basic ampliﬁer
and feedback network do not produce a loading effect on the input signal source. In
actual feedback circuits, these assumptions and conditions are not entirely accurate.
We will see later how nonideal conditions change the characteristics of actual feedback
circuits with respect to those of the ideal feedback network.

1In this chapter, β is the feedback transfer function, rather than the transistor current gain. The parameter
hFE will be used as the transistor current gain. Normally, hFE indicates the dc current gain and h f e indi-
cates the ac current gain. However, as usual, we neglect any difference between the two parameters and
assume hFE = h f e.
Ideal Closed-Loop Signal Gain
From Figure 12.1, the output signal is
So = ASε
(12.1)
where A is the ampliﬁcation factor, and the feedback signal is
Sf b = βSo
(12.2)
where β in this case is the feedback transfer function.1 At the summing node, we
have
Sε = Si −Sf b
(12.3)
where Si is the input signal. Equation (12.1) then becomes
So = A(Si −βSo) = ASi −β ASo
(12.4)
Equation (12.4) can be rearranged to yield the closed-loop transfer function, or
gain, which is
Af = So
Si
=
A
(1 + β A)
(12.5)
As mentioned, signals Si, So, Sf b, and Sε can be either currents or voltages; how-
ever, they do not need to be all voltages or all currents in a given feedback ampliﬁer.
12.2.1

In other words, there may be a combination of current and voltage signals in the same
circuit.
Equation (12.5) can be written
Af =
A
(1 + β A) =
A
1 + T
(12.6)
where T = β A is the loop gain. For negative feedback, we assume T to be a pos-
itive real factor. We will see later that the loop gain can become a complex func-
tion of frequency, but for the moment, we will assume that T is positive for neg-
ative feedback. We will also see that in some cases the gain will be negative
(180 degree phase difference between input and output signals) which means that
the feedback transfer function β will also be a negative quantity for a negative
feedback circuit.
Combining Equations (12.1) and (12.2), we obtain the loop gain relationship
T = Aβ = Sf b
Sε
(12.7)
Normally, the error signal is small, so the expected loop gain is large. If the loop gain
is large so that β A ≫1, then, from Equation (12.6), we have
Af ∼=
A
β A = 1
β
(12.8)
and the gain or transfer function of the feedback ampliﬁer essentially becomes a
function of the feedback network only.
The feedback circuit is usually composed of passive elements, which means
that the feedback amplifier gain is almost completely independent of the basic
amplifier properties, including individual transistor parameters. Since the feed-
back amplifier gain is a function of the feedback elements only, the closed-loop
gain can be designed to be a given value. This property was demonstrated in
Chapter 9, where we showed that the closed-loop gain of ideal op-amp circuits is
a function of the feedback elements only. The individual transistor parameters
may vary widely, and may depend on temperature and frequency, but the feedback
amplifier gain is constant. The net results of negative feedback is stability in the
amplifier characteristics.
In general, the magnitude and phase of the loop gain are functions of frequency,
and they become important when we discuss the stability of feedback circuits.
EXAMPLE 12.1
Objective: Calculate the feedback transfer function β, given A and Af.
Case A. Assume that the open-loop gain of a system is A = 105 and the
closed-loop gain is Af = 50.
Solution: From Equation (12.5), the closed-loop gain is
Af =
A
(1 + β A)
or
50 =
105
1 + β(105)
which yields β = 0.01999 or 1/β = 50.025.
Chapter 12 Feedback and Stability
855

Case B. Now assume that the open-loop gain is A = −105 and the close-loop
gain is Af = −50.
Solution: Again, from Equation (12.5), the closed-loop gain is
Af =
A
(1 + β A)
or
−50 =
−105
1 + β(−105)
which yields β = −0.01999 or 1/β = −50.025.
Comment: From these typical parameter values, we see that Af ∼= 1/β, as Equa-
tion (12.8) predicts. We also see that if the open-loop gain A is negative, then the
closed-loop gain Af and feedback transfer function β will also be negative for a neg-
ative feedback network.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.1: (a) The open-loop gain of an ampliﬁer is A = 5 × 104 and the closed-loop
gain is Af = 50. (i) What is the feedback transfer function? (ii) What is the ratio of
Af to 1/β? (b) Repeat part (a) for A = 100 and Af = 20. (Ans. (a) (i) 0.01998,
(ii) 0.9990; (b) (i) 0.04, (ii) 0.80)
Assuming a large loop gain, the output signal, from Equation (12.5), becomes
So =

(12.9)
Substituting Equation (12.9) into (12.3), we obtain the error signal,

(12.10)
With a large loop gain, the error signal decreases to almost zero. We will see this
result again as we consider speciﬁc feedback circuits throughout the chapter.
Gain Sensitivity
As previously stated, if the loop gain T = β A is very large, the overall gain of the
feedback ampliﬁer is essentially a function of the feedback network only. We can
quantify this characteristic.
If the feedback transfer function β is a constant, then taking the derivative of Af
with respect to A, from Equation (12.5), produces

Equation (12.12) shows that the percent change in the closed-loop gain Af is
less than the corresponding percent change in the open-loop gain A by the factor
(1 + β A). The change in open-loop gain may result from variations in individual
transistor parameters in the basic ampliﬁer.
EXAMPLE 12.2
Objective: Calculate the percent change in the closed-loop gain Af, given a change
in the open-loop gain A.
Using the same parameter values as in Example 12.1, we have A = 105,
Af = 50, and β = 0.01999. Assume that the change in the open-loop gain is
d A = 104 (a 10 percent change).
Solution: From Equation (12.12), we have
d Af =
Af
(1 + β A) · d A
A =
50
[1 + (0.01999)(105)] · 104
105 = 2.5 × 10−3
The percent change is then
d Af
Af
= 2.5 × 10−3
50
= 5 × 10−5 ⇒0.005%
compared to the 10 percent change assumed in the open-loop gain.
Comment: From this example, we see that the resulting percent change in the
closed-loop gain is substantially less than the percent change in the open-loop gain.
This is one of the principal advantages of negative feedback.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.2: (a) Consider a general feedback system with parameters A = 5 × 105
and Af = 50. If the magnitude of A decreases by 15 percent, what is the new
value of Af and what is the corresponding percent change in Af ? (b) Repeat
part (a) if A = 100 and Af = 20. (Ans. (a) Af = 49.99912, −1.76 × 10−3 %;
(b) Af = 19.318, −3.41%)
From Equation (12.12), the change in Af is reduced by the factor (1 + β A) com-
pared to the change in A. The term (1 + β A) is called the desensitivity factor.
Bandwidth Extension
The ampliﬁer bandwidth is a function of feedback. Assume the frequency response
of the basic ampliﬁer can be characterized by a single pole. We can then write
A(s) =
Ao
1 + s
ωH
(12.13)
where Ao is the low-frequency or midband gain, and ωH is the upper 3 dB or corner
frequency.

Figure 12.2 Open-loop and closed-loop gain versus frequency, illustrating 
bandwidth extension
The closed-loop gain of the feedback ampliﬁer can be expressed as
Af (s) =
A(s)
(1 + β A(s))
(12.14)
where we assume that the feedback transfer function β is independent of frequency.
Substituting Equation (12.13) into Equation (12.14), we can write the closed-loop
gain in the form
Af (s) =
Ao
(1 + β Ao) ·
1
1 +
s
ωH(1 + β Ao)
(12.15)
From Equation (12.15), we see that the low-frequency closed-loop gain is smaller
than the open-loop gain by a factor of (1 + β Ao), but the closed-loop 3 dB frequency
is larger than the open-loop value by a factor of (1 + β Ao).
If we multiply the low-frequency open-loop gain Ao by the bandwidth (3 dB fre-
quency) ωH, we obtain AoωH, which is the gain–bandwidth product. The product of
the low-frequency closed-loop gain and the closed-loop band-width is
Ao
(1 + β Ao)[ωH(1 + β Ao)] = AoωH
(12.16)
Equation (12.16) states that the gain-bandwidth product of a feedback ampliﬁer
is a constant. That is, for a given circuit, we can increase the gain at the expense of a
reduced bandwidth, or we can increase the bandwidth at the expense of a reduced
gain. This property is illustrated in Figure 12.2.

EXAMPLE 12.3
Objective: Determine the bandwidth of a feedback ampliﬁer.
Consider a feedback ampliﬁer with an open-loop low-frequency gain of
Ao = 104, an open-loop bandwidth of ωH = (2π)(100) rad/s, and a closed-loop
low-frequency gain of Af (0) = 50.
Solution: From Equation (12.15), the low-frequency closed-loop gain is
Af (0) =
Ao
(1 + β Ao)
or
50 =
104
(1 + β Ao)

which yields
(1 + β Ao) = 104
50 = 200
From Equation (12.15), the closed-loop bandwidth is
ωf H = ωH(1 + β Ao) = (2π)(100)(200) = (2π)(20 × 103)
Comment: The bandwidth increases from 100 Hz to 20 kHz as the gain decreases
from 104 to 50.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.3: (a) A feedback ampliﬁer has an open-loop low-frequency gain of
AO = 5 × 104, an open-loop bandwidth of ωH = (2π)(5) rad/s, and a closed-
loop low-frequency gain of Af (0) = 80. Determine (i) β and (ii) the closed-loop
bandwidth. (b) Using the results of part (a), if β is reduced by 50 percent,
determine the percent change in (i) Af (0) and (ii) ωf H? (Ans. (a) (i) β = 0.01248,
(ii) ωf H = (2π)(3.125 × 103) rad/s; (b) (i) +100%, (ii) −50%)
Noise Sensitivity
In any electronic system, unwanted random and extraneous signals may be present in
addition to the desired signal. These random signals are called noise. Electronic
noise can be generated within an ampliﬁer, or may enter the ampliﬁer along with the
input signal. Negative feedback may reduce the noise level in ampliﬁers; more accu-
rately, it may increase the signal-to-noise ratio. More precisely, feedback can help
reduce the effect of noise generated in an ampliﬁer, but it cannot reduce the effect
when the noise is part of the input signal.
The input signal-to-noise ratio is deﬁned as
(SNR)i = Si
Ni
= vi
vn
(12.17)
where Si = vi is the input source signal and Ni = vn is the input noise signal. The
output signal-to-noise ratio is
(SNR)o = So
No
= ATi Si
ATnNi
(12.18)
where the desired output signal is So = ATi Si and the output noise signal is No =
ATnNi. The parameter ATi is the ampliﬁcation factor that multiplies the source signal,
and the parameter ATn is the ampliﬁcation factor that multiplies the noise signal. A
large signal-to-noise ratio allows the signal to be detected without any loss of infor-
mation. This is a desirable characteristic.
The following example compares the signal and noise ampliﬁcation factors,
which may or may not be equal.

Figure 12.3 Four ampliﬁer conﬁgurations with different input noise sources
EXAMPLE 12.4
Objective: Determine the effect of feedback on the source signal and noise signal
levels.
Consider the four possible ampliﬁer conﬁgurations shown in Figure 12.3. The
ampliﬁers are designed to provide the same output signal voltage. Determine the
effect of the noise signal vn.
Solution (Figure 12.3(a)): Two open-loop ampliﬁers are in a cascade conﬁguration,
and the noise signal is generated between the two ampliﬁers. The output voltage is
voa = A1A2vi + A2vn = 100vi + 10vn
Therefore, the output signal-to-noise ratio is
So
No
= 100vi
10vn
= 10 Si
Ni
Solution (Figure 12.3(b)): Two open-loop ampliﬁers are in a cascade conﬁguration,
and the noise is part of the input signal. The output voltage is
vob = A1A2vi + A1A2vn = 100vi + 100vn
Therefore, the output signal-to-noise ratio is
So
No
= 100vi
100vn
= Si
Ni
Solution (Figure 12.3(c)): Two ampliﬁers are in a feedback conﬁguration, and the
noise signal is generated between the two ampliﬁers. The output voltage is
voc = A1A2vε + A2vn
and the feedback signal is
vf b = βvoc
860
Part 2
Analog Electronics

Then,
vε = vi −vf b = vi −βvoc
therefore,
voc = A1A2(vi −βvoc) + A2vn
or
voc =
A1A2
(1 + β A1A2) · vi +
A2
(1 + β A1A2) · vn ∼= 100vi + 0.1vn
The output signal-to-noise ratio is
So
No

0.1vn

Ni
Solution (Figure 12.3(d)): A basic feedback conﬁguration, and the noise is part of
the input signal. The output voltage is
vod =
A1A2
(1 + β A1A2)(vi + vn) ∼= 100vi + 100vn
Therefore, the output signal-to-noise ratio is
So
No
= 100vi
100vn
= Si
Ni
Comment: Comparing the four conﬁgurations, we see that Figure 12.3(c) produces
the largest output signal-to-noise ratio. This conﬁguration may occur when ampliﬁer
A2 is an audio power-ampliﬁer stage, in which large currents can produce excessive
noise, and when ampliﬁer A1 corresponds to a low-noise preampliﬁer, which provides
most of the voltage gain.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.4: (a) Consider the circuit shown in Figure 12.3(a). Assume A1 = 100
and A2 = 10. Determine the output signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the input
signal-to-noise ratio. (b) Consider the circuit shown in Figure 12.3(c). Assume
A1 = 104, A2 = 10, and β = 0.001. Determine the output signal-to-noise ratio
in terms of the input signal-to-noise ratio. (Ans. (a) So/No = 100(Si/Ni),
(b) So/No = 104(Si/Ni))
We must emphasize that the increased signal-to-noise ratio due to feedback occurs
only in speciﬁc situations. As indicated in Figure 12.3(d), when noise is effectively
part of the ampliﬁer input signal, the feedback mechanism does not improve the ratio.
Reduction of Nonlinear Distortion
Distortion in an output signal is caused by a change in the basic ampliﬁer gain or a
change in the slope of the basic ampliﬁer transfer function. The change in gain is a
function of the nonlinear properties of bipolar and MOS transistors used in the basic
ampliﬁer.

Assume the basic ampliﬁer, or open-loop, transfer function is as shown in Fig-
ure 12.4(a), which shows changes in gain as the input signal amplitude changes. The
gain values are shown on the ﬁgure. When this ampliﬁer is incorporated in a feed-
back circuit with a feedback transfer function of β = 0.099, the resulting closed-loop
transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 12.4(b). This transfer function also has
changes in gain but, whereas the open-loop gain changes by a factor of 2, the closed-
loop gain changes by only 1 percent and 2 percent, respectively. A smaller change in
gain means less distortion in the output signal of the negative feedback ampliﬁer.

IDEAL FEEDBACK TOPOLOGIES
Objective: • Analyze the four ideal feedback circuit conﬁgurations and
determine circuit characteristics including input and output resistances.
There are four basic feedback topologies, based on the parameter to be ampliﬁed (volt-
age or current) and the output parameter (voltage or current). The four feedback circuit
categories can be described by the types of connections at the input and output of circuit.
The four types of connections are shown in Figure 12.5. The four connections are
referred to as: series–shunt (voltage ampliﬁer), shunt–series (current ampliﬁer),
series–series (transconductance ampliﬁer), and shunt–shunt (transresistance ampliﬁer).
The ﬁrst term refers to the connection at the ampliﬁer input, and the second term refers
to the connection at the output. Also, the type of connection determines which parame-
ter (voltage or current) is sampled at the output and which parameter is ampliﬁed. The
connections also determine the feedback ampliﬁer characteristics—in particular, the
input and output resistances. The resistance parameters become an important circuit
property, when, for example, we consider voltage ampliﬁers versus current ampliﬁers.
Chapter 12 Feedback and Stability
863
In this section, we will determine the ideal transfer functions and the ideal input
and output resistances of each of the four feedback topologies. In later sections, we
will compare actual versus ideal feedback circuit characteristics.
As a note, the ideal topologies are small-signal equivalent circuits; therefore,
phasor notation is used throughout this analysis.
Series–Shunt Conﬁguration
The conﬁguration of an ideal series–shunt feedback ampliﬁer is shown in Fig-
ure 12.6. The circuit consists of a basic voltage ampliﬁer with an input resistance Ri

Figure 12.6 Ideal series–shunt feedback topology
and an open-loop voltage gain Av. The feedback circuit samples the output voltage
and produces a feedback voltage Vf b, which is in series with the input signal voltage
Vi. In this ideal conﬁguration, the input resistance to the feedback circuit is inﬁnite;
therefore, there is no loading effect on the output of the basic ampliﬁer due to the
feedback circuit.
Voltage Vε is the difference between the input signal voltage and the feedback
voltage and is called an error signal. The error signal is ampliﬁed in the basic voltage
ampliﬁer. We can recognize the series connection on the input and the shunt connec-
tion of the output for this conﬁguration.
The feedback circuit is a voltage-controlled voltage source and is an ideal volt-
age ampliﬁer. The feedback circuit samples the output voltage and provides a feed-
back voltage in series with the source voltage. For example, an increase in the output
voltage produces an increase in the feedback voltage, which in turn decreases the
error voltage due to the negative feedback. Then, the smaller error voltage is ampli-
ﬁed producing a smaller output voltage, which means that the output signal tends to
be stabilized.
If the output of the feedback network is an open circuit, then the output volt-
age is
Vo = AvVε
(12.19)
and the feedback voltage is
Vf b = βVo = βvVo
(12.20)
Parameter βv is the voltage feedback transfer function, which is the ratio of the feed-
back voltage to the output voltage. The notation is similar to the voltage gain Av,
which is also the ratio of two voltages.
The error voltage, assuming the source resistance RS is negligible, is
Vε = Vi −Vf b
(12.21)
Combining Equations (12.19), (12.20), and (12.21), we ﬁnd the closed-loop voltage
transfer function is
Avf = Vo
Vi
=
Av
(1 + βv Av)
(12.22)
Equation (12.22) is the closed-loop voltage gain of the feedback ampliﬁer, and it has
the same form as the ideal feedback transfer function given by Equation (12.5).

Figure 12.7 Ideal series–shunt feedback conﬁguration for determining output resistance
The input resistance including feedback is denoted by Ri f . Starting with Equa-
tion (12.21), using Equations (12.19) and (12.20), we ﬁnd that

Equation (12.25) shows that a series input connection results in an increased
input resistance compared to that of the basic voltage ampliﬁer. A large input resis-
tance is a desirable property of a voltage ampliﬁer. This eliminates loading effects on
the input signal source.
The output resistance of the feedback circuit can be determined from the equiv-
alent circuit in Figure 12.7. The input signal voltage source is set equal to zero
(a short circuit), and a test voltage is applied to the output terminals.

Figure 12.8 Equivalent circuit of the series–shunt feedback circuit or voltage ampliﬁer
Equation (12.28) shows that a shunt output connection results in a decreased
output resistance compared to that of the basic voltage ampliﬁer. A small output
resistance is a desirable property of a voltage ampliﬁer. This eliminates loading ef-
fects on the output signal when an output load is connected.
The equivalent circuit of this feedback voltage ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 12.8.

EXAMPLE 12.5
Objective: Determine the input resistance of a series input connection and the out-
put resistance of a shunt output connection for an ideal feedback voltage ampliﬁer.
Consider a series–shunt feedback ampliﬁer in which the open-loop gain is
Av = 105 and the closed-loop gain is Avf = 50. Assume the input and output resis-
tances of the basic ampliﬁer are Ri = 10 k and Ro = 20 k, respectively.
Solution: The ideal closed-loop voltage transfer function is, from Equation (12.22),
Avf =
Av
(1 + βv Av)
or
(1 + βv Av) = Av
Avf
= 105
50 = 2 × 103
From Equation (12.25), the input resistance is
Ri f = Ri(1 + βv Av) = (10)(2 × 103) k ⇒20 M
and, from Equation (12.28), the output resistance is
Rof =
Ro
(1 + βv Av) =

2 × 103 k ⇒10 
Comment: With a series input connection, the input resistance increases drastically,
and with a shunt output connection, the output resistance decreases substantially,
with negative feedback. These are the desired characteristics of a voltage ampliﬁer.

Shunt–Series Conﬁguration
The conﬁguration of an ideal shunt–series feedback ampliﬁer is shown in Fig-
ure 12.9. The circuit consists of a basic current ampliﬁer with an input resistance Ri
and an open-loop current gain Ai. The feedback circuit samples the output current
and produces a feedback current If b, which is in shunt with an input signal current Ii.
In this ideal conﬁguration, the feedback circuit does not load down the basic ampli-
ﬁer output; therefore, the load current Io is not affected.
12.3.2
Chapter 12 Feedback and Stability
867
Current Iε is the difference between the input signal current and the feedback
current and is the error signal. The error signal is ampliﬁed in the basic current
ampliﬁer. We can recognize the shunt connection on the input and the series connec-
tion on the output for this conﬁguration.
This circuit is a current-controlled current source and is an ideal current ampliﬁer.
The feedback circuit samples the output current and provides a feedback signal in shunt
with the signal current. An increase in output current produces an increase in feedback
current, which in turn decreases the error current. The smaller error current is then
ampliﬁed, producing a smaller output current and stabilizing the output signal.
The input source shown is a Norton equivalent circuit; it could be converted to a
Thevenin equivalent circuit.
If the output is essentially a short circuit, then the output current is
Io = Ai Iε
(12.29)
and the feedback current is
If b = βIo = βi Io
(12.30)
The parameter βi is the feedback current transfer function. The input signal current,
assuming RS is large, is
Ii = Iε + If b

Figure 12.10 Ideal shunt–series feedback conﬁguration for determining output resistance
The form of the equation for the current transfer function of the current ampli-
ﬁer (shunt–series connection) is the same as that for the voltage transfer function of
the voltage ampliﬁer (series–shunt connection). We will show that this will be the
same for the two feedback connections yet to be discussed.
The input resistance of the shunt–series conﬁguration is Ri f . Starting with Equa-
tion (12.31), using Equations (12.29) and (12.30), we ﬁnd that
Ii = Iε + If b = Iε + βi Io = Iε + βi(Ai Iε)
(12.33(a))

Iε =

Equation (12.35) shows that a shunt input connection decreases the input resistance
compared to that of the basic ampliﬁer. A small input resistance is a desirable property
of a current ampliﬁer, to avoid loading effects on the input signal current source.
The output resistance of the feedback circuit can be determined from the equiv-
alent circuit in Figure 12.10. The input signal current is set equal to zero (an open
circuit) and a test current is applied to the output terminals. Since the input signal
current source is assumed to be ideal we have RS = ∞.

resistance compared to that of the basic ampliﬁer. A large output resistance is a
desirable property of a current ampliﬁer, to avoid loading effects on the output signal
due to a load connected to the ampliﬁer output.
The equivalent circuit of this feedback current ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 12.11.

EXAMPLE 12.6
Objective: Determine the input resistance of a shunt input connection and the out-
put resistance of a series output connection, for a feedback current ampliﬁer.
Consider a shunt–series feedback ampliﬁer in which the open-loop gain is
Ai = 105 and the closed-loop gain is Ai f = 50. Assume the input and output resis-
tances of the basic ampliﬁer are Ri = 10 k and Ro = 20 k, respectively. 
Solution: The ideal closed-loop current transfer function, from Equation (12.32), is
Ai f =
Ai
(1 + βi Ai)
or
(1 + βi Ai) = Ai
Ai f
= 105
50 = 2 × 103
From Equation (12.35), the input resistance is
Ri f =
Ri
(1 + βi Ai) =
10
2 × 103 k ⇒5 
and from Equation (12.38), the output resistance is
Rof = (1 + βi Ai)Ro = (2 × 103)(20) k ⇒40 M
Comment: With a shunt input connection, the input resistance decreases drastically,
and with a series output connection, the output resistance increases substantially,
assuming negative feedback. These are the desired characteristics of a current ampliﬁer.

The feedback samples a portion of the output current and converts it to a voltage. This
feedback circuit can therefore be thought of as a voltage-to-current ampliﬁer.

Part 2
Analog Electronics
The circuit consists of a basic ampliﬁer that converts the error voltage to an
output current with a gain factor Ag and that has an input resistance Ri. The feedback
circuit samples the output current and produces a feedback voltage Vf b, which is in
series with the input signal voltage Vi.
Assuming the output is essentially a short circuit, the output current is
Io = AgVε
and the feedback voltage is
Vf b = βz Io
where βz is called a resistance feedback transfer function, with units of resistance.
The input signal voltage, neglecting the effect of RS, is
Vi = Vε + Vf b
Combining these equations, as we have in previous analyses, yields the closed-loop
current-to-voltage transfer function,
Ag f = Io
Vi

Ag
(1 + βz Ag)
(12.39)
The units of the transfer function given by Equation (12.39) are amperes/volt, or
conductance. We may note that the term βzAg is dimensionless. This particular feed-
back circuit is therefore called a transconductance ampliﬁer.

given by Equation (12.25), which shows that with this conﬁguration, the input resis-
tance increases compared to that of the basic ampliﬁer. The output resistance for the

VOLTAGE (SERIES–SHUNT) AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze op-amp and discrete transistor circuit examples
of series–shunt (voltage) feedback ampliﬁers.
In this section, we will analyze an op-amp and a discrete circuit representation of
the series–shunt feedback conﬁguration. Since the series–shunt circuit is a voltage
ampliﬁer, we will derive the transfer function relating the output signal voltage to
the input signal voltage. For the ideal conﬁguration, this function is shown in
Equation (12.22) and is
Avf =
Av
(1 + βv Av)
where Av is the basic ampliﬁer voltage gain and βv is the voltage feedback transfer
function. We found that, in this feedback conﬁguration, the input resistance increases
and the output resistance decreases compared to the basic ampliﬁer values.
Op-Amp Circuit Representation
Figure 12.16 shows a noninverting op-amp circuit, which is an example of the
series–shunt conﬁguration. The input signal is the input voltage Vi, the feed-back
voltage is Vf b, and the error signal is the voltage Vε. Since the shunt output samples
the output voltage, the feedback voltage is a function of the output voltage.
In the ideal feedback circuit, the ampliﬁcation factor Av is very large; from
Equation (12.22), the transfer function is then
Avf = Vo

We can take a ﬁnite ampliﬁer gain into account by considering the equivalent

Vo = AvVε

The voltage transfer function for the noninverting op-amp circuit has the same form
as that for the ideal series–shunt conﬁguration, assuming the input resistance Ri is
very large.
We may note in this case that the voltage gain Av of the basic ampliﬁer is posi-
tive and that the feedback transfer function βv is also positive, so that the loop gain
T = βv Av is positive for negative feedback.
We can now derive the expression for the input resistance Ri f . We see from the
ﬁgure that Vε = Ii Ri, Vo = AvVε, and Vi = Vε + Vf b. The approximate feedback
voltage is given by Equation (12.47). Therefore, the input voltage is

The expression for the input resistance for the op-amp circuit has the same form
as that for the ideal series input connection, as given in Equation (12.25). In the
ideal case in which the gain is Av = ∞, the input resistance of the noninverting
op-amp is also infinite. However, if the gain is finite, the input resistance will also
be finite.
EXAMPLE 12.7
Objective: Determine the expected input resistance of the noninverting op-amp
circuit.
Consider the noninverting op-amp in Figure 12.16, with parameters Ri = 50 k,
R1 = 10 k, R2 = 90 k, and Av = 104.

βv =

The input resistance is therefore
Ri f = Ri(1 + βv Av) = (50)[1 + (0.10)(104)]
or
Ri f ∼= 50 × 103 k = 50 M
Comment: Even with a moderate differential input resistance Ri to the op-amp, the
closed-loop input resistance Ri f is very large, because of the series input feedback
connection.

(ii) Vε = 9.999 μV; (c) (i) Af = 4.99995, (ii) Vε = 0.99999 μV)
The analysis results for the noninverting op-amp circuit are consistent with the
ideal series–shunt feedback characteristics.
Discrete Circuit Representation
Figures 12.18(a) and (b) show the basic emitter-follower and source-follower circuits,
which we examined in previous chapters. These are examples of discrete-circuit
series–shunt feedback topologies. The input signal is the voltage vi, the error signal
is the base-emitter voltage in the emitter follower and the gate-source voltage in the
source follower, and the feedback voltage is equal to the output voltage, which
means that the feedback transfer function is βv = 1.
The small-signal equivalent circuit of the emitter follower is shown in Fig-
ure 12.18(c). Since we have already analyzed the emitter-follower circuit, we will
simply state the results here. The small-signal voltage gain is

Even though the magnitude of the emitter-follower voltage gain is slightly less
than unity, this circuit is a classic example of a series–shunt feedback conﬁguration,
which represents a voltage ampliﬁer.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 12.8
Objective: Design a feedback ampliﬁer to amplify the output signal of a micro-
phone to meet a set of speciﬁcations.
Speciﬁcations: The output signal from the microphone is 10 mV and the output
signal from the feedback ampliﬁer is to be 0.5 V in order to drive a power ampliﬁer
that in turn will drive the speakers. The nominal output resistance of the microphone
is RS = 5 k and the nominal input resistance of the power ampliﬁer is RL = 75 .
Choices: An op-amp with parameters Ri = 10 k, Ro = 100 , and a low-frequency
gain of Av = 104 is available. [Note: In this simple design, neglect frequency
response.]
Solution (Design Approach): Since the source resistance is fairly large, an ampliﬁer
with a large input resistance is required to minimize loading at the input. Also, since
the load resistance is low, an ampliﬁer with a low output resistance is required
to minimize loading at the output. To satisfy these requirements, a series–shunt feed-
back conﬁguration, or voltage ampliﬁer, should be used.

2Reminder: In this chapter, the parameter hFE is used as the transistor current gain to avoid confusion
with β, which is used as the feedback transfer function. Again, we assume that the dc and ac current gains
are equal; therefore, hFE = h f e = gmrπ .

The closed-loop voltage gain must be Avf = 0.5/0.01 = 50. For the ideal case,
Avf = 1/βv, so the feedback transfer function is βv = 1/50 = 0.02. The loop gain is
then
T = βv Av = (0.02)(104) = 200
Referring to Table 12.1, we expect the input resistance to be
Ri f ∼= (10)(200) k →2 M
and the output resistance to be
Rof ∼= (100/200)  = 0.5 
These input and output resistance values will minimize any loading effects at the
ampliﬁer input and output terminals.
If we use the noninverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration in Figure 12.16, then we have
1
βv
= 1 + R2
R1
= 50
and
R2
R1
= 49
The feedback network loads the output of the ampliﬁer; consequently, we need
R1 + R2 to be much larger than Ro. However, the output resistance of the feedback
network is in series with the input terminals, so extremely large values of R1 and R2
will reduce the actual signal applied to the op-amp because of voltage divider action.
Initially, then, we choose R1 = 1 k and R2 = 49 k.
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: The circuit in Figure 12.19 was used in a PSpice
analysis of the voltage ampliﬁer. A standard 741 op-amp was used in the circuit. For a
10 mV input signal, the output signal was 499.6 mV, for a gain of 49.96. This result is
within 0.08 percent of the ideal designed value. The input resistance Ri f was found to
be approximately 580 M and the output resistance Rof was determined to be
approximately 0.042 . The differences between the measured input and output
878
Part 2

resistances compared to the predicted values are due to the differences between the
actual μA-741 op-amp parameters and the assumed parameters. However, the mea-
sured input resistance is larger than predicted and the measured output resistance is
smaller than predicted, which is desired and more in line with an ideal op-amp circuit.
Comment: An almost ideal feedback voltage ampliﬁer can be realized if an op-amp
is used in the circuit.

CURRENT (SHUNT–SERIES) AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze op-amp and discrete transistor circuit examples
of shunt–series (current) feedback ampliﬁers.
In this section, we will analyze an op-amp and a discrete circuit representation of the
shunt–series feedback ampliﬁer. The shunt–series circuit is a current ampliﬁer; there-
fore, we must derive the output current to input current transfer function. For the
ideal conﬁguration, this function is given in Equation (12.32):
Ai f =
Ai
(1 + βi Ai)
where Ai is the basic ampliﬁer current gain and βi is the current feedback transfer
function. For this ampliﬁer, the input resistance decreases and the output resistance
increases compared to the basic ampliﬁer values.

The feedback current is If b, the error signal is the current Iε, and the output signal

previously stated. Resistance RS is the output resistance of the current source and is
normally large. If RS ≫Ri f , then I ′

circuit in Figure 12.21. The parameter Ai is the open-loop current gain. We have
Io = Ai Iε
(12.61)
and
Iε = I ′
i −If b ∼= Ii −If b
(12.62)
therefore,
Io = Ai(Ii −If b)
(12.63)
If we again assume that V1 is at virtual ground, voltage Vo is given by
Vo = −If bRF
(12.64)
We can then write
I1 = −Vo

Equation (12.69) does not have the same form as the ideal shunt–series feedback
transfer function. This is common in many discrete transistor feedback circuits. The
reason is that resistor RE introduces loading effects that are not present in the ideal
conﬁguration. Typically, then, the transfer functions of actual discrete circuits are not
the same as for the ideal case.

Figure 12.24 (a) Example of a discrete transistor shunt–series feedback circuit and 
(b) ac equivalent circuit
Figure 12.24(b) shows the ac equivalent circuit, in which all capacitors act as short
circuits. With the shunt input connection, the input signal current is essentially Ii (as-
suming RS is large), the feedback current is If b, and the error signal is Iε. The signal
emitter current Ie is directly proportional to the load current Io, and the feedback
current is directly proportional to Ie, demonstrating that this series output connection
samples the output current Io.
[Note: It may be argued that, even though Ie is related to the output current Io, the
output current is not part of the feedback circuit. In particular, the output resistance
ro2 of Q2 is not within the feedback network. For this reason, the output connection
may be thought of as a shunt connection with the output signal being a voltage at the
emitter of Q2. However, we are assuming the output signal is a current so we will
treat this circuit as a shunt-series ampliﬁer.]
The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 12.25. We assume that the
small-signal output resistance ro of each transistor is inﬁnite. We could derive the
expression for the closed-loop current gain by writing and solving a set of simulta-
neous nodal equations. However, as with most discrete transistor feedback circuits,
the transfer function cannot be arranged exactly in the ideal form without several
approximations. For this circuit, then, we rely on a computer analysis to provide the
required results.

EXAMPLE 12.9
Objective: Determine the closed-loop current gain and input resistance of a discrete
shunt–series transistor feedback circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 12.24(a), with transistor parameters hFE = 100
and VA = ∞. Assume the source resistance is RS = 10 M. The capacitors are large
enough to act as short circuits to the signal currents.
Solution: A PSpice analysis shows that the closed-loop current gain is
Ai f = Io/Ii = 9.58
The input resistance Ri f is deﬁned as the ratio of the signal voltage at the base of Q1
to the input signal current. The PSpice results show that Ri f = 134 . This low input
resistance is expected for the shunt input connection.
Comment: The PSpice analysis shows that the closed-loop current gain increases
from 9.58 to 10.2 as the transistor current gain hFE increases from 100 to 1000. This
result again demonstrates a principal characteristic of feedback circuits, which is that
the transfer function is relatively insensitive to changes in the individual transistor
parameters.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 12.9: Consider the common-base circuit in Figure 12.23(a), with transistor
parameters hFE = 80, VE B(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞. Assume the transistor is
biased at IC Q = 0.5 mA. Redesign the circuit such that the closed-loop current
gain is greater than 0.95. (Ans. RE(min) = 1.30 k, and V +(min) = 1.36 V)
From the small-signal equivalent circuit in Figure 12.25, we ﬁnd that the output
resistance Rof looking into the collector of Q2 is very large. If ro of Q2 is assumed to
be inﬁnite, then Rof is also inﬁnite. We expect a large output impedance for the se-
ries output connection of this feedback circuit.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 12.10
Objective: Design a feedback ampliﬁer to provide a given current gain.
Speciﬁcations: Assume that a signal current source has a nominal output resistance
of RS = 10 k and that the ampliﬁer will drive a nominal load of RL = 50 . A cur-
rent gain of 10 is required.
884
Part 2
Analog Electronics

Choices: An op-amp with the same characteristics described in Example 12.8 is
available.
Solution (Design Approach): An ampliﬁer with a low input resistance and a large
output resistance is required, to minimize loading effects at the input and output. For
these reasons, a shunt–series feedback conﬁguration, or current ampliﬁer, will be
used.
The closed-loop gain is
Ai f = 10 ∼= 1/βi
and the feedback transfer function is βi = 0.1.
The dependent open-loop voltage source of the op-amp, as shown in Figure 12.17,
can be transformed to an equivalent dependent open-loop current source, as shown in
Figure 12.9. We ﬁnd that
Ai = Av Ri/Ro
Using the parameters speciﬁed for the op-amp, we ﬁnd Ai = 106. The loop gain for
the shunt–series conﬁguration is
Aiβi = (106) (0.1) = 105
Referring to Table 12.1, we expect the input resistance to be
Ri f = 10/105 k →0.1 
and the output resistance to be
Rof = (100)(105)  →10 M
These resistance values will minimize any loading effects at the ampliﬁer input and
output.
For the shunt–series conﬁguration in Figure 12.20, we have
1
βi
= 1 + RF
R1
= 10
or
RF/R1 = 9
For our purposes, R1 must be fairly small, to avoid a loading effect at the output.
However, R1 must not be too small, to avoid large currents in the ampliﬁer. There-
fore, we choose R1 = 1 k and RF = 9 k.
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: Figure 12.26 shows the circuit used in the
computer simulation. A standard μA-741 op-amp was used in the circuit. The current
gain was found to be exactly 10.0. The input resistance Ri f looking into the op-amp
with feedback was found to be 0.056 , which compares favorably to the predicted
value of 0.1 . The output resistance seen by the load resistor was found to be
approximately 200 M. This value is on the order of 20 times larger than the
predicted value, but is closer to the ideal value. The differences between predicted
and measured values are due to the differences in assumed op-amp parameters and
the μA-741 op-amp parameters.
Comment: This design also produces an almost ideal feedback current ampliﬁer, if
reasonable values of feedback resistors are used.

where Ag is the basic ampliﬁer transconductance gain and βz is the resistance feed-
back transfer function. We found that with this feedback conﬁguration, both the input
and output resistances increase compared to the basic ampliﬁer values.
Op-Amp Circuit Representation
The op-amp circuit in Figure 12.27 is an example of the series–series feedback
conﬁguration. The input signal is the input voltage Vi, the feedback voltage is Vf b,
and the error signal is the voltage Vε. The series output connection samples the out-
put current, which means that the feedback voltage is a function of the output current.

from Equation (12.39), the transfer function is

very large, we can write that
Io = Vf b
RE

(12.73)
Also,
Vε = Vi −Vf b = Vi −IoRE
(12.74)
Substituting Equation (12.74) into Equation (12.73) yields
Io = hFE Ag(Vi −IoRE)
(12.75)
which can be rearranged to yield the closed-loop transfer function,
Ag f = Io

(12.76)
which has the same form as that of the ideal theory. In this example, we see that in
this feedback network, the transistor current gain is part of the basic ampliﬁer gain.
Discrete Circuit Representation
Figure 12.29 shows a single bipolar transistor circuit that is an example of a series–
series feedback conﬁguration. This circuit is similar to those evaluated in Chapters
5 and 6. The input signal is the input voltage vi, the feedback voltage is vf b, and the
error signal is the base–emitter voltage. The series output connection samples the
output current; therefore, the feedback voltage is a function of the output current.
The small-signal equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 12.30. The Early voltage
of the transistor is assumed to be inﬁnite. The output current can be written

Again, the closed-loop transfer function of the discrete transistor feedback

ing on the input. If both RC and rπ become large, then Equation (12.80) changes to
the ideal form, where the feedback transfer function is βz = −RE and the basic
ampliﬁer transconductance is Ag = −gm.
EXAMPLE 12.11
Objective: Determine the transconductance gain of a transistor feedback circuit.

Solution: From a dc analysis of the circuit, the quiescent values are IC Q =
0.983 mAand VC E Q = 5.08 V. The transistor small-signal parameters are found to be

Comment: The circuit in Figure 12.29 is an example of a series–series feedback
topology, even though in many cases we treat this circuit as a voltage ampliﬁer.
When an emitter resistor is included, the small-signal voltage gain decreases,
because of the feedback effect of RE. However, the transconductance and voltage
gain become insensitive to the transistor parameters, also a result of the feedback
effect of RE. A 100 percent increase in the transistor current gain hFE produces a 0.5
percent change in the closed-loop voltage gain.

The input resistance Ri f of the series input feedback connection includes RE
multiplied by (1 + hFE), where hFE is the transistor current gain. The input resis-
tance increases signiﬁcantly because of the series connection.
The output resistance of a series output feedback connection is usually very
large. However, resistance RC reduces the output resistance and introduces a loading

effect. The reduced output resistance demonstrates that discrete transistor feedback
circuits do not conform exactly to ideal feedback circuits. Nevertheless, overall cir-
cuit characteristics improve when feedback is used.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 12.12
Objective: Design a driver ampliﬁer to supply current to an LED.
Speciﬁcations: The available voltage source is variable from 0 to 5 V and has an
output resistance of 200 . The required diode current is 10 mA when the maximum
input voltage is applied. The required closed-loop transconductance gain is then
Ag f = Io/Vi = (10 × 10−3)/5 →2 mS.
Choices: An op-amp with the characteristics described in Example 12.8 and a BJT
with hFE = 100 are available.
Solution (Design Approach): To minimize loading effects on the input, an ampliﬁer
with a large input resistance is required; to minimize loading effects on the output,
a large output resistance is required. For these reasons, a series–series feedback
conﬁguration, or transconductance ampliﬁer, is selected.
The closed-loop gain is
Ag f = 2 × 10−3 ∼= 1/βz
and the resistance feedback transfer function is
βz = 500 
The dependent open-loop voltage source of the op-amp, as shown in Figure 12.17,
can be transformed to an equivalent dependent op-loop transconductance source for
the transconductance ampliﬁer, as shown in Figure 12.12. We ﬁnd that
Ag = Av/Ro
The parameters speciﬁed for the op-amp yield
Ag = 100 A/V
The loop gain for the series–series conﬁguration is
Agβz = (100)(500) = 5 × 104
Referring to Table 12.1, the expected input resistance is
Ri f = (10)(5 × 104) k →500 M
and the expected output resistance is
Rof = (100)(5 × 104)  →5 M
These input and output resistances should minimize any loading effects at the ampli-
ﬁer input and output.
For this example, we may use the ampliﬁer conﬁguration shown in Figure 12.27,
in which the load resistor RL is replaced by an LED. In the ideal case,
βz = RE = 500 

Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: Figure 12.32 shows the circuit used in the
computer simulation. Again, a standard μA-741 op-amp was used in the circuit and
a standard diode was used in place of an LED. When the input voltage reached 5 V,
the current through the diode was 10.0 mA, which was the design value. The input
resistance Ri f was found to be approximately 2400 M and the output resistance
Rof was found to be approximately 60 M. Both of these values are larger than pre-
dicted because of the differences in the assumed op-amp parameters and those of the
μA-741 op-amp.
Comment: Again, an almost ideal feedback circuit can be designed by using an 
op-amp.

TRANSRESISTANCE (SHUNT–SHUNT)
AMPLIFIERS
Objective: • Analyze op-amp and discrete transistor circuit examples
of shunt–shunt (transresistance) feedback ampliﬁers.
In this section, we will analyze an op-amp and a discrete circuit representation of the
shunt–shunt feedback ampliﬁer. The shunt-shunt circuit is a transresistance ampli-
ﬁer; therefore, we must derive the output voltage to input current transfer function.
For the ideal conﬁguration, this function is given by Equation (12.40) as
Azf =
Az
(1 + βg Az)
where Az is the basic ampliﬁer transresistance gain, and βg is the feedback transfer
function. With this feedback connection, both the input and output resistance
decrease compared to the basic ampliﬁer values.
Op-Amp Circuit Representation
Figure 12.33(a) shows the basic inverting op-amp circuit that we analyzed in Chapter 9.
We treated this as a voltage ampliﬁer whose voltage gain is Av = −Vo/Vi. However,
this circuit is actually an example of a shunt–shunt conﬁguration. The deﬁning input
signal is the input current Ii.
Figure 12.33(b) shows the same circuit without the input resistance. From this
conﬁguration, we see the input shunt connection. The input current splits between the
feedback current If b and the error current Iε. The shunt output connection samples
the output voltage; therefore, the feedback current is a function of the output voltage.
In the ideal feedback circuit, the ampliﬁcation factor Az is very large, and the
transresistance transfer function is, from Equation (12.40),

Comparing Equation (12.82) to Equation (12.81), we see that the feedback
transfer function for the ideal inverting op-amp circuit is
βg = −1
R2
(12.83)
We can take a ﬁnite ampliﬁer gain into account by considering the equivalent
circuit in Figure 12.34. The parameter Az is the open-loop transresistance gain fac-
tor, and is negative since the error current Iε is considered to be positive entering the
inverting terminal. We can write Vo = Az Iε = −|Az| Iε, Iε = Ii −If b, and Vo =

(12.85)
This feedback circuit is one example in which the open-loop gain of the basic am-
pliﬁer, Az = Vo/Iε, is negative. The feedback transfer function, βg = −1/R2, is also
negative, but the loop gain T = Azβg is positive for this negative feedback circuit.
The transresistance transfer function for the inverting op-amp circuit has the
same form as that for the ideal shunt–shunt conﬁguration. In addition, since V1 is at
virtual ground, the input resistance including feedback, Ri f , is essentially zero, and
we have shown that the output resistance with feedback, Rof , is very small. These
small resistance values are a result of the shunt–shunt conﬁguration. Therefore, our
analysis of the inverting op-amp circuit produces results consistent with ideal
shunt–shunt feedback characteristics.
The inverting ampliﬁer circuit in Figure 12.33 is most often thought of as a volt-
age ampliﬁer. The input current Ii is directly proportional to the input voltage Vi,
which means that the voltage transfer function (gain) and transresistance transfer
function have the same characteristics. Even though we are usually concerned with
the voltage gain, the inverting ampliﬁer is an example of a shunt–shunt feedback
topology which is a transresistance ampliﬁer.

Figure 12.35 shows a single bipolar transistor circuit, which is an example of a
shunt–shunt feedback conﬁguration. The input signal current is ii, the feedback current
is i f b, and the error signal current is iε and is the signal base current. The shunt output

The closed-loop transresistance gain for the single-transistor feedback circuit
cannot be put into the ideal form, as given in Equation (12.40), without further
approximations. In an ideal feedback circuit, the feedback network does not load the
basic ampliﬁer. Also, the forward transmission occurs entirely through the basic am-
pliﬁer. However, in a discrete transistor feedback circuit, these ideal assumptions are
not entirely valid; therefore, the form of the transfer function is usually not exactly
the same as that of the ideal conﬁguration.
We may assume that the feedback resistor is fairly large, which means that the
feedback does not drastically perturb the circuit. We may then assume
hFE = gmrπ ≫(rπ/RF)
If we also assume that RC ≪RF and rπ ≪RF, then Equation (12.91) reduces to
Azf = Vo

(12.92)
Consequently, the feedback transfer function is approximately
βg ∼= −1
RF
(12.93)
Equation (12.93) demonstrates that the approximate value of the feedback transfer
function depends only on a resistance value.
Although the actual closed-loop transfer function does not ﬁt the ideal form, the
magnitude of that function depends less on the individual transistor parameters than
does the open-loop gain. This characteristic is one of the general properties of feed-
back circuits.
Also, since the input current is proportional to the input voltage, we can use this
circuit as a voltage ampliﬁer.
EXAMPLE 12.13
Objective: Determine the transresistance and voltage gain of a single-transistor
shunt–shunt feedback circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 12.37(a). The transistor parameters are: hFE = 100,
VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞. Since the input signal current is directly proportional
to the input voltage, the voltage gain of this shunt–shunt conﬁguration has the same
general properties as the transresistance transfer function.
As with many circuits considered in this chapter, several capacitors are included.
In the circuit in Figure 12.37(a), R1 and CC2 may be removed. Resistor RF can be
used for biasing, and the circuit can be redesigned to provide the same feedback
properties.
896
Part 2
Analog Electronics

Solution: By including CC2 in the circuit, the feedback is a function of the ac signal
only, which means that the transistor quiescent values are not affected by feedback. 
The quiescent parameters are found to be IC Q = 0.492 mA and VC E Q = 5.08 V, and
the small-signal parameters are rπ = 5.28 k and gm = 18.92 mA/V.
In the small-signal equivalent circuit, which is shown in Figure 12.37(b), the
Thevenin equivalent input source is converted to a Norton equivalent circuit. Writing
a KCL equation at the output, we obtain
Vo
10 + (18.9)Vπ + Vo −Vπ
82

A KCL equation at the input yields
Ii = Vπ
10 + Vπ
4.96 + Vπ
5.28 + Vπ −Vo
82
Combining these two equations and eliminating Vπ, we ﬁnd the small-signal trans-
resistance gain, which is
Azf = Vo
Ii
= −65.87 k
Since this unit of gain is not as familiar as voltage gain, we determine the volt-
age gain from
Ii = Vi/RS = Vi/10

Therefore,

= −(65.8)(0.10) = −6.587
If the current gain hFE of the transistor decreases from 100 to 75, the transistor
quiescent values change slightly to IC Q = 0.478 mA and VC E Q = 5.22 V. The small-
signal parameters become rπ = 4.08 k and gm = 18.4 mA/V.
The closed-loop small-signal voltage gain then becomes
Vo/Vi = −6.41
Comment: With a 25 percent decrease in the transistor current gain hFE, the
closed-loop voltage gain decreases by only 2.6 percent. If no feedback were
present, the voltage gain would be directly proportional to hFE. The ideal closed-
loop voltage gain of the feedback circuit, which is determined as hFE approaches
inﬁnity, is
Av(hFE →∞) = −RF/RS = −7.20
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: Additional results of a PSpice analysis are
shown in Figure 12.38. The magnitude of the voltage gain is plotted as a function of
the transistor current gain hFE, for three values of feedback resistance. The results
for RF = 82 k agree very well with the results from the hand analysis. As RF
increases to 160 k, there is less feedback, and the magnitude of the voltage gain
increases. However, the variation in the closed-loop gain is substantially greater as
the transistor gain changes. In contrast, when RF decreases to 47 k, there is in-
creased feedback, and the magnitude of the voltage gain decreases. However, there
is very little variation in closed-loop gain as the transistor gain changes. In all
cases, as the gain of the transistor increases, there is less change in closed-loop
gain. This result demonstrates the need for a large gain in the basic ampliﬁer in the
feedback network.

gain function, the input and output resistance expressions for the single-transistor
feedback circuit cannot be put in exactly the same form as that for the ideal conﬁgu-
ration. However, the same general characteristics are obtained; that is, both input and
output resistances decrease, predicted by the ideal case.

Solution: Input Resistance: The small-signal equivalent circuit for calculating the

Output Resistance: The small-signal equivalent circuit for calculating the output

Comment: The input resistance with no feedback would be rπ = 5.28 k. The
shunt input feedback connection has lowered the input resistance to Ri f = 0.443 k.
Similarly, the output resistance with no feedback would be RC = 10 k. The shunt
output feedback connection has lowered the output resistance to Rof = 1.75 k. The
decrease in both the input and output resistances agrees with the ideal feedback theory.

the discrete transistor feedback circuit all tend to approach the ideal values if additional

may adversely affect the circuit frequency response.
Since negative feedback is desired, there must be an odd number of negative gain
stages. As the number of stages increases, the open-loop gain increases, and the circuit

LOOP GAIN
Objective: • Derive the loop gain of ideal and practical feedback
circuits.
In previous sections, the loop gain T was easily determined for circuits involving
ideal op-amps. For discrete transistor circuits, however, the loop gain usually cannot
be obtained directly from the closed-loop transfer function. As we will see later in

this chapter, loop gain is an important parameter in the stability of a feedback circuit;
we will describe a number of techniques for determining the loop gain.
Basic Approach
The general feedback network was shown in Figure 12.1 and is repeated in Fig-
ure 12.42(a). To ﬁnd the loop gain, set the source Si equal to zero, and break the
feedback loop at some point. Figure 12.42(b) shows a feedback network in which
the loop is broken at the ampliﬁer input and a test signal St is applied at this point.
The ampliﬁer output signal is So = ASt, and the feedback signal is
Sf b = βSo = AβSt
The return signal Sr, which was previously the error signal, is now −Sf b (the minus
sign indicates negative feedback). Therefore,

The ratio of the return signal Sr to the test signal St is the negative of the loop gain
factor.
As the feedback loop is broken, the conditions that existed prior to the loop
being broken must remain unchanged. These conditions include: maintaining the
same transistor biasing and maintaining the same impedance at the return point. An
equivalent impedance must therefore be inserted at the point where the loop is
broken. This is shown in Figure 12.43. Figure 12.43(a) shows the ampliﬁer input

tion after the loop is broken. A test voltage Vt is applied, and a load impedance Rin is
inserted at the output of the broken loop. The return voltage is then measured at this
output terminal. The loop gain is found to be

similar to the one considered in Examples 12.13 and 12.14. The feedback loop is bro-
ken at the input to the transistor, at the point marked X. The small-signal equivalent
circuit is shown in Figure 12.44(b). A test voltage is applied to the base of the tran-
sistor and the equivalent load resistance rπ is connected at the return point. The input
signal current is set equal to zero.

hFE = 100, VBE(on) = 0.7 V, and VA = ∞. From Example 12.13, the quiescent
collector current is IC Q = 0.492 mA, and the resulting small-signal parameters are
rπ = 5.28 k and gm = 18.9 mA/V.
Solution: The equivalent resistance is
Req = RS∥R1∥R2∥rπ = (10)∥(51)∥(5.5)∥(5.28) = 2.04 k
From Equation (12.99(b)), the loop gain is

If the transistor current gain hFE increases to 1000, then IC Q = 0.541 mA,
rπ = 48.1 k, and gm = 20.81 mA/V. The new value of Req becomes 3.10 k and
the loop gain is T = 6.78.
Comment: Since the loop gain is a function of the basic ampliﬁer gain, we expect
this parameter to change as the transistor current gain changes. Also, since no capac-
itance effects were considered, the loop gain is a positive, real number that corre-
sponds to negative feedback.

mine the loop gain T. (Ans. T = 2.75)

Computer Analysis
The loop gain can also be determined from a computer analysis of the feedback
circuit. In Example 12.16, we demonstrate a direct approach to determining the loop
gain. First, we consider the circuit analyzed in the last example, to correlate the
results of a computer analysis to those of a hand analysis. Then, we determine the
loop gain of a feedback circuit when taking capacitance effects into account.
EXAMPLE 12.16
Objective: Determine the loop gain factor for a feedback circuit, using a computer
simulation analysis.
Consider the circuit in Figure 12.44(a).
Solution: We determine the loop gain factor by using the circuit in Figure 12.45, in
which the loop is effectively broken at the base of the transistor. The circuit condi-
tions, however, must remain unchanged from those prior to breaking the loop. This
includes maintaining the same bias currents in the transistor and terminating the
broken loop with the proper impedance.

Figure 12.45 Feedback circuit with the loop effectively broken, for determining the loop
gain from a computer analysis
A large inductance is inserted in the transistor base connection, to act as a short
circuit for dc signals, so that the proper dc bias can be maintained on the transistor,
and to act as an open circuit for ac signals, so that the loop appears to be broken for
the ac signal. A test voltage Vt is applied to the base of the transistor through a cou-
pling capacitor, and a load resistance Rp is connected through a coupling capacitor at
the return point. These coupling capacitors act as short circuits to the ac signals, but
as open circuits to dc signals, so that the dc bias is not disturbed by these elements.
From the computer simulation, the loop gain for a transistor current gain of
hFE = 100 is
T = −Vr/Vt = 5.04

For a current gain of 1000, the loop gain is T = 9.37. These values differ slightly
from the hand analysis results in Example 12.15. The slight difference arises because
the quiescent collector currents determined in the hand analysis and the computer
analysis are not quite the same, leading to different values of gm and rπ.
Comment: The analysis of this circuit is straightforward. In the next example, we
demonstrate another advantage of a computer analysis.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.16: Consider the feedback circuit described in Exercise Problem Ex 12.15.
Determine the loop gain from a PSpice analysis.
When capacitances are part of the feedback circuit, the phase of the loop gain
becomes a factor in determining whether the feedback is negative or positive.
Figure 12.46 shows a three-stage ampliﬁer with feedback. Each stage is the same as
the circuit given in Figure 12.44(a). For an odd number of stages at low frequency, the
loop gain is a positive, real quantity, and negative feedback is applied. The coupling
and emitter bypass capacitors are assumed to be very large, and capacitors C1, C2, and
C3 between the stages can represent either load capacitances or transistor input capac-
itances. As the frequency increases, the magnitude of the loop gain decreases, because
of decreasing capacitor impedances, and the phase of the loop gain also changes.
EXAMPLE 12.17
Objective: Determine the magnitude and phase of the loop gain of a multistage
feedback circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 12.46, with parameters: RS = 10 M, RA = 51 k,
RB = 5.5 k, RF = 82 k, RC = 10 k, and C = 100 pF. The transistor current
gains are assumed to be hFE = 15, which keeps the overall gain fairly small.

Solution: The loop is broken at the base of Q1, and the ratio of the return signal to
the test signal is measured by the same technique shown in Figure 12.45.
The magnitude of Vr/Vt versus frequency is shown in Figure 12.47(a). The
magnitude of loop gain drops off with frequency, as expected, and is equal to unity at
approximately 5.5 MHz.

Figure 12.47 (a) Bode plot of loop gain magnitude for three-stage feedback ampliﬁer, from
Example 12.17; (b) phase of the return signal for the three-stage ampliﬁer
The phase of the return signal is shown in Figure 12.47(b). Since the loop gain is
given by T = −Vr/Vt, then the phase of the loop gain is ̸ T = −180◦+ ̸ Vr −̸ Vt
where the −180◦corresponds to the minus sign. Since the phase of the input signal
was set to zero, then the phase of the loop gain is ̸ T = −180◦+ ̸ Vr . At low
frequencies, where the phase of the return signal is approximately +180◦, the phase
of the loop gain is essentially zero, corresponding to negative feedback. At approxi-
mately f = 2.5 MHz, the phase of the return signal is zero so that the phase of the
loop gain is −180◦, which corresponds to positive feedback.
Comment: For this circuit, the loop gain magnitude is greater than unity at the
frequency at which the phase of T is −180 degrees. As discussed in the next section,
this condition means that the circuit is unstable and will oscillate.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.17: Consider the feedback circuit in Figure 12.16, with the equivalent
circuit given in Figure 12.17. Break the feedback loop at an appropriate point, and
derive the expression for the loop gain. (Ans. T = Av/[1 + R2/(R1∥Ri)])
A hand analysis of the three-stage ampliﬁer just considered would be tedious,
especially taking the frequency response into account. In this case, a computer analy-
sis is more suitable.

STABILITY OF THE FEEDBACK CIRCUIT
Objective: • Determine the stability criteria of feedback circuits.
In negative feedback, a portion of the output signal is subtracted from the input signal
to produce the error signal. However, as we found in the last section, this subtraction
property, or the loop gain, may change as a function of frequency. At some frequen-
cies, the subtraction may actually be addition; that is, the negative feedback may
become positive, producing an unstable system. In this section, we will examine the
stability of feedback circuits.
The Stability Problem
The basic feedback conﬁguration is shown in Figure 12.1, and the ideal closed-loop
transfer function is given by Equation (12.5), which is repeated here:
Af = So
Si
=
A
(1 + β A)
(12.5)
The open-loop gain is a function of the individual transistor parameters and
capacitances, and is therefore a function of frequency. The closed-loop gain can then
be written as
Af (s) =
A(s)
(1 + β A(s)) =
A(s)
1 + T(s)
(12.100)
where T(s) is the loop gain. For physical frequencies, s = jω, and the loop gain is
T( jω), which is a complex function. The loop gain can be represented by its magni-
tude and phase, as follows:
T( jω) = |T( jω)|̸ φ
(12.101)
The closed-loop gain can be written
Af ( jω) =
A( jω)
1 + T( jω)
(12.102)
The stability of the feedback circuit is a function of the loop gain T( jω). If the
loop gain magnitude is unity when the phase is 180 degrees, then T( jω) = −1 and
the closed-loop gain goes to inﬁnity. This implies that an output will exist for a

zero input, which means that the circuit will oscillate. If we are trying to build a
linear amplifier, an oscillator is considered an unstable circuit. We will show that
if |T( jω)| < 1 when the phase is 180 degrees, the system is stable, whereas if
|T( jω)| ≥1 when the phase is 180 degrees, the system is unstable. To study the sta-
bility of feedback circuits, we must therefore analyze the frequency response of the
loop gain factor.

well as the effective Miller capacitance. The Miller capacitance and Miller effect

gain phase is shown in Figure 12.51(b). Again the phase of the output current is in
phase with the input current at low frequency. This phase relation is a direct result of
the way the directions of current were deﬁned. At high frequencies, the output cur-
rent becomes 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the input current.

If we assume an ideal feedback ampliﬁer, the loop gain is

(12.116)
where the feedback transfer function β is assumed to be independent of frequency.
For op-amp feedback circuits, we can determine the feedback transfer function β, as
previously shown, and the basic ampliﬁer characteristics are assumed to be known.

Nyquist Stability Criterion
In the last section, we saw that a feedback system can become unstable. Several
methods can be used to determine whether a system is stable or unstable. The method
we will consider is called the Nyquist stability criterion. This method not only
determines if a system is stable, it also indicates the degree of system stability.
To apply this method, we must plot a Nyquist diagram, which is a polar plot
of the loop gain factor T( jω). The loop gain, which is a complex function, can be
written in terms of its magnitude and phase, T( jω) = |T( jω)|̸ φ, as shown in Equa-
tion (12.101). The Nyquist diagram is a plot of the real and imaginary components of
T( jω) as the frequency ω varies from minus inﬁnity to plus inﬁnity. Although nega-
tive frequencies have no physical meaning, they are not mathematically excluded in
the loop gain function. The polar plot for negative frequencies, as we will see, is the
complex conjugate of the polar plot for positive frequencies.
The loop gain for a two-pole ampliﬁer is, from Equation (12.113),
T( jω) =
β Aio

1 + j ω
ω1
 
1 + j ω

(12.118)
where ω1 and ω2 are the upper 3 dB radian frequencies of the ﬁrst and second stages,

The Nyquist plot of Equation (12.119) is shown in Figure 12.54. At ω = 0, the
magnitude of T( jω) is β Aio and the phase is zero. As ω increases, the magnitude
decreases and the phase is negative. From Equation (12.119), we see that for nega-
tive values of ω, the magnitude also decreases, but the phase becomes positive. This
means that the loop gain function for negative frequencies is the complex conjugate
of the loop gain function for positive frequencies, and the real axis is the axis of
symmetry. As ω approaches +∞, the magnitude approaches zero and the phase
approaches −180 degrees.

Figure 12.55(a) shows one possible Nyquist plot. For ω = 0, the magnitude is β Ao
and the phase is zero. As ω increases in the positive direction, the magnitude decreases
and the phase becomes negative. As the Bode plot in Figure 12.53 shows, the phase goes
through −90 degrees, then through −180 degrees, and ﬁnally approaches −270 degrees
as the magnitude approaches zero. This same effect is shown in the Nyquist diagram.
The plot approaches the origin and is tangent to the imaginary axis as ω →∞. Again,
the plot for negative frequencies is the mirror image of the positive frequency plot about
the real axis.

Another possible Nyquist plot for the three-pole loop gain function is shown in
Figure 12.55(b). The basic plot is the same as that in Figure 12.55(a), except that the
position of the point (−1, 0) is different. At the frequency at which the phase is −180
degrees, the curve crosses the negative real axis. In Figure 12.55(a), |T( jω)| < 1 when
the phase is −180 degrees, whereas in Figure 12.55(b), |T( jω)| > 1 when the phase is
−180 degrees. The Nyquist diagram encircles the point (−1, 0) in Figure 12.55(b), and
this has particular signiﬁcance for stability. For this treatment of a three-pole ampliﬁer,
the Nyquist criterion for stability of the ampliﬁer can be stated as follows: “If the
Nyquist plot encircles or goes through the point (−1, 0), the ampliﬁer is unstable.”
Using the criterion, a simpler test for stability can be used in most cases. If
|T( jω)| ≥1 at the frequency at which the phase is −180 degrees, then the ampliﬁer
is unstable. This simpler test allows us to use the Bode plots considered previously,
instead of explicitly constructing the Nyquist diagram.

In this case, the three poles all occur at the same frequency. Determine the stability
of the ampliﬁer for β = 0.20 and β = 0.02.

which yields
f180 = 1.73 × 105 Hz
The magnitude of the loop gain at this frequency for, β = 0.20, is then
|T( f180)| = (0.20)(100)
8
= 2.5
For β = 0.02, the magnitude is
|T( f180)| = (0.020)(100)

Comment: The loop gain magnitude at the frequency at which the phase is −180
degrees is 2.5 when β = 0.20 and 0.25 when β = 0.02. The system is therefore un-
stable for β = 0.20 and stable for β = 0.02.

Determine the value of β at which the ampliﬁer becomes unstable. (Ans.
β = 0.0667)
We can also consider the stability of the feedback system in terms of Bode plots.
The Bode plot of the loop gain magnitude from the previous example is shown in
Figure 12.56(a), for β = 0.20 and β = 0.02. The low-frequency loop gain magni-
tude is dependent on β, but the 3 dB frequency is the same in both cases. Since
the three poles all occur at the same frequency, the magnitude of T( f) decreases at
the rate of −18 dB/octave at the higher frequencies. The frequencies at which
|T( f )| = 1 are indicated on the ﬁgure.

The phase of the loop gain function is shown in Figure 12.56(b). The two
frequencies at which |T( f )| = 1, for the two values of β, are also indicated. We see
that |φ| > 180◦at |T( f )| = 1, when β = 0.20. This is equivalent to |T( f )| > 1 when
φ = −180◦, which makes the system unstable. However, |φ| < 180◦at |T( f )| = 1,
when β = 0.02, so the feedback circuit is stable for this feedback transfer factor.
Phase and Gain Margins
From the discussion in the previous section, we can determine whether a feedback
ampliﬁer is stable or unstable by examining the loop gain as a function of frequency.
This can be done from a Nyquist diagram or from the Bode plots. We can also use
this technique to determine the degree of stability of a feedback ampliﬁer.
At the frequency at which the loop gain magnitude is unity, if the magnitude of the
phase is less than 180 degrees, the system is stable. This is illustrated in Figure 12.57.
The difference (magnitude) between the phase angle at this frequency and 180 degrees
is called the phase margin. The loop gain can change due, for example, to temperature

variations, and the phase margin indicates how much the loop gain can increase and still
maintain stability. A typical desired phase margin is in the range of 45 to 60 degrees.
A second term that describes the degree of stability is the gain margin, which is
also illustrated in Figure 12.57. This function is deﬁned to be |T( jω)| in decibels at
the frequency where the phase is −180 degrees. This value is usually expressed in dB
and also gives an indication of how much the loop gain can increase and still main-
tain stability.

Objective: Determine the required feedback transfer function β to yield a speciﬁc
phase margin, and determine the resulting closed-loop low-frequency gain.

Determine the value of β that yields a phase margin of 45 degrees.
Solution: A phase margin of 45 degrees implies that the phase of the loop gain is
−135 degrees at the frequency at which the magnitude of the loop gain is unity. The

Since the three poles are far apart, the frequency at which the phase is −135 degrees
is approximately equal to the frequency of the second pole, as shown in Figure 12.53.

Comment: For this value of β, if the frequency is greater than 5 × 104 Hz, the loop
gain magnitude is less than unity. If the frequency is less than 5 × 104 Hz, the phase
of the loop gain is |φ| < 135◦(phase margin of 45 degrees). These conditions imply
that the system is stable.

FREQUENCY COMPENSATION
Objective: • Consider frequency compensation techniques, methods
by which unstable feedback circuits can be stabilized.
In the previous section, we presented a method for determining whether a feedback
system is stable or unstable. In this section, we will discuss a method for modifying
the loop gain of a feedback ampliﬁer, to make the system stable. The general tech-
nique of making a feedback system stable is called frequency compensation.
Basic Theory
One basic method of frequency compensation involves introducing a new pole in the
loop gain function, at a sufﬁciently low frequency that |T( f )| = 1 occurs when
|φ| < 180◦. As an example, consider the Bode plots of a three-pole loop gain magni-
tude and phase given in Figure 12.58 and shown by the solid lines. In this case, when
the magnitude of the loop gain is unity, the phase is nearly −270 degrees and the
system is unstable.
If we introduce a new pole fPD at a very low frequency, and if we assume that
the original three poles do not change, the new Bode plots of the magnitude and
phase will be as shown by the dotted lines in Figure 12.58. In this situation, the
12.10.1

919
magnitude of the loop gain becomes unity when the phase is |φ| < 180◦, and the sys-
tem is stable. Since the pole is introduced at a low frequency and since it dominates
the frequency response, it is called a dominant pole. This fourth pole can be intro-
duced by adding a fourth stage with an extremely large input capacitance. Though
not practical, this method demonstrates the basic idea of stabilizing a circuit.
EXAMPLE 12.20
Objective: Determine the dominant pole required to stabilize a feedback system.

Insert a dominant pole, assuming the original poles do not change, such that the
phase margin is at least 45 degrees.
Solution: By inserting a dominant pole, we change the loop gain function to

We assume that fP D ≪104 Hz. A phase of −135 degrees, giving a phase margin of
45 degrees, occurs approximately at f135 = 104 Hz.

Problem-Solving Technique: Frequency Compensation
1.
To stabilize a circuit, insert a dominant pole or move an existing pole to a
dominant pole position (see next section). Assume that the dominant pole fre-
quency is small. Determine the frequency of the resulting loop gain function
to achieve the required phase margin.
2.
Set the magnitude of the loop gain function equal to unity at the frequency
determined in step 1 to ﬁnd the required dominant pole frequency.
3.
To actually achieve the required dominant pole frequency in the circuit, a
number of techniques are available (for example, see Miller compensation).
One disadvantage of this frequency compensation method is that the loop gain
magnitude, and in turn the open-loop gain magnitude, is drastically reduced over a
very wide frequency range. This affects the closed-loop response of the feedback
ampliﬁer. However, the advantage of maintaining a stable ampliﬁer greatly outweighs
the disadvantage of a reduced gain, demonstrating another trade-off in design criteria.
Closed-Loop Frequency Response
Inserting a dominant pole to obtain the open-loop characteristics (dotted lines, Figure
12.58) is not as extreme or devastating to the circuit as it might ﬁrst appear. Ampli-
ﬁers are normally used in a closed-loop conﬁguration, for which we brieﬂy consid-
ered the bandwidth extension, in Section 12.2.3.
12.10.2

Part 2

Chapter 12 Feedback and Stability

For the region in which the frequency response is characterized by the dominant
pole, the open-loop ampliﬁer gain is
A( f ) =
Ao
1 + j
f
fP D
(12.122)
where Ao is the low-frequency gain and fPD is the dominant-pole frequency. The
feedback ampliﬁer closed-loop gain can be expressed as
Af ( f ) =
A( f )
(1 + β A( f ))
(12.123)
where β is the feedback transfer ratio, which is assumed to be independent of fre-
quency. Substituting Equation (12.122) into (12.123), we can write the closed-loop
gain as
Af ( f ) =
Ao
(1 + β Ao) ×
1
1 + j
f
fP D(1 + β Ao)

The 
term 
Ao/(1 + β Ao)
is 
the 
closed-loop 
low-frequency 
gain, 
and
fP D(1 + β Ao) = fC is the 3 dB frequency of the closed-loop system.
Figure 12.59 shows the Bode plot of the gain magnitude for the open-loop para-
meters Ao = 106 and fP D = 10 Hz, at several feedback transfer ratios. As the
closed-loop gain decreases, the bandwidth increases. As previously determined, the
gain–bandwidth product is essentially a constant.

EXAMPLE 12.21
Objective: Determine the shift in the 3 dB frequency when an ampliﬁer is operated
in a closed-loop system.
Consider an ampliﬁer with a low-frequency open-loop gain of Ao = 106 and
an open-loop 3 dB frequency of fP D = 10 Hz. The feedback transfer ratio is
β = 0.01.
Solution: The low-frequency closed-loop gain is
Af (0) =
Ao
(1 + β Ao) =
106
1 + (0.01)(106)
∼= 100

From Equation (12.124), the closed-loop 3dB frequency is
fC = fP D(1 + β Ao) = (10)[1 + (0.01)(106)]
or
fC ∼= 105 Hz = 100 kHz
Comment: Even though the open-loop 3 dB frequency is only 10 Hz, the closed-
loop bandwidth is extended to 100 kHz. This effect is due to the fact that the
gain–bandwidth product is a constant.

Miller Compensation
As previously discussed, an op-amp consists of three stages, with each stage
normally responsible for one of the loop gain poles. Assume, for purposes of discus-
sion, that the ﬁrst pole fP1 is created by the capacitance effects in the second gain
stage. Instead of adding a fourth dominant pole to achieve a stable system, we can
move pole fP1 to a low frequency. This can be done by increasing the effective input
capacitance to the gain stage.
Previously in Chapter 7, we determined that the effective Miller input capaci-
tance to a transistor ampliﬁer is a feedback capacitance multiplied by the magnitude
of the gain of the ampliﬁer stage. We can use this Miller multiplication factor to
stabilize a feedback system. The three-stage op-amp circuit is shown in Figure 12.60.
The second stage, an inverting ampliﬁer, has a feedback capacitor connected
between the output and input. This capacitor CF is called a compensation capacitor.
The effective input Miller capacitance is
CM = CF(1 + A)
(12.125)
Since the gain of the second stage is large, the equivalent Miller capacitance will
normally be very large. The pole introduced by the second stage is approximately
fP1 =
1
2π R2CM

where R2 is the effective resistance between the ampliﬁer input node and ground.
Resistance R2, then, is the parallel combination of the input resistance to the ampli-
ﬁer and the output resistance of the diff-amp stage.
EXAMPLE 12.22
Objective: Determine the pole of the gain stage that includes a feedback capacitor.
Consider a gain stage with an ampliﬁcation A = 103, a feedback capacitor
CF = 30 pF, and a resistance R2 = 5 × 105 .
Solution: The effective input Miller capacitance is
CM = CF(1 + A) ∼= (30)(1000) pF = 3 × 10−8 F
The dominant-pole frequency is therefore
fP1 =
1
2π R2 CM
=
1
2π(5 × 105)(3 × 10−8) = 10.6 Hz
Comment: The pole of the second stage can be moved to a signiﬁcantly lower
frequency by using the Miller effect.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 12.22: The loop gain function of an ampliﬁer is described in Exercise
Ex 12.20. To stabilize the circuit, the ﬁrst pole at fP1 = 103 Hz is to be moved by
introducing a compensation capacitor. Assume the other two poles remain ﬁxed.
Determine the frequency to which the ﬁrst pole must be moved to achieve a phase
margin of 45◦. (Ans. fP D = 194 Hz)
The effect of moving pole fP1, using the Miller compensation technique, is
shown in Figure 12.61. We assume at this point that the other two poles fP2 and fP3

Figure 12.61 Bode plots of loop gain for three-stage ampliﬁer, before (solid curves) and after
(dotted curves) incorporating Miller compensation capacitor: (a) magnitude and (b) phase

are not affected. Moving the pole fP1 to f ′
P1 means that the frequency at which
|T( f )| = 1 is lower, and that the phase is |φ| < 180◦, which means that the ampli-
ﬁer is stabilized.
A detailed analysis of the system using Miller compensation shows that pole fP2
does not remain constant; it increases. This phenomenon is called pole-splitting. The
increase in fP2 is actually beneﬁcial, because it increases the phase margin, or the
frequency at which a particular phase margin is achieved.

SUMMARY
•
combined with the input signal. In negative feedback, a portion of the output
signal is subtracted from the input signal. In positive feedback, a portion of the
output signal is added to the input signal.
•
An important advantage of negative feedback is that the closed-loop ampliﬁer
gain is essentially independent of individual transistor parameters and is a func-
tion only of the feedback elements.
•
Negative feedback increases bandwidth, may increase the signal-to-noise ratio,
reduces nonlinear distortion, and controls input and output impedance values at
the expense of reduced gain magnitude.
•
There are four basic feedback topologies. A series input connection is used when
the input signal is a voltage, and a shunt input connection is used when the input
signal is a current. A series output connection is used when the output signal is a
current, and a shunt output connection is used when the output signal is a voltage.
•
The loop gain factor of a feedback ampliﬁer is deﬁned as T = Aβ, which is
dimensionless and where A is the gain of the basic ampliﬁer and β is the feed-
back factor. The loop gain is a function of frequency and is complex when the
input capacitance of each transistor stage is taken into account.
•
A three-stage negative feedback ampliﬁer is guaranteed to be stable when, at the
frequency for which the phase of the loop gain is −180 degrees, the magnitude
of loop gain is less than unity.
•
A common technique of frequency compensation utilizes the Miller multiplica-
tion effect by incorporating a feedback capacitor across, usually, the second
stage of the ampliﬁer.
•
As an application, a MOSFET feedback circuit was designed.

Thus far, we have considered basic circuit conﬁgurations, such as the common emitter,
emitter follower, and diff-amp, among others. We have discussed the basic concepts in
design and analysis, including biasing techniques, frequency response, and feedback
effects. In this chapter, we combine basic circuit conﬁgurations to form larger analog
circuits that are fabricated as integrated circuits. Operational ampliﬁers are used
extensively in electronic systems, so we concentrate on several conﬁgurations of
operational ampliﬁer circuits.
We introduced the ideal op-amp in Chapter 9. Now, we analyze and design the
circuitry of the op-amp, to determine how the various circuit conﬁgurations can be
combined to form a nearly ideal op-amp.

GENERAL OP-AMP CIRCUIT DESIGN
Objective: • Discuss the general design philosophy of an operational
ampliﬁer circuit.
An operational ampliﬁer, in general, is a three-stage circuit, as shown in Figure 13.1,
and is fabricated as an integrated circuit. The ﬁrst stage is a differential ampliﬁer,
the second stage provides additional voltage gain, and the third stage provides cur-
rent gain and low output impedance. A feedback capacitor is often included in the
second stage to provide frequency compensation as discussed in the last chapter. In
some cases, in particular with MOSFET op-amp circuits, only the ﬁrst two stages
are used.

Figure 13.1 General block diagram of an operational ampliﬁer
We have on numerous occasions made reference to the op-amp. In Chapter 9,
we analyzed and designed op-amp circuits using the ideal op-amp model. In
Chapter 10, we introduced current-source biasing and introduced the active load.
The differential amplifier, using current source biasing and active loads was
considered in Chapter 11. We also introduced the bipolar Darlington pair in
Chapter 11, which is often used as a second gain stage. Previously, in Chapter 8,
we considered the class-AB output stage that is often used in operational ampli-
fier circuits. These individual building blocks will now be combined to form the
operational amplifier.
In Chapter 9, as mentioned, we analyzed and designed ideal op-amp circuits.
Practical operational ampliﬁers, as we will see in this chapter, exhibit characteristics
that deviate from the ideal characteristics. Once we have analyzed these practical
op-amp circuits and determined some of their nonideal properties, we will then con-
sider, in the next chapter, the effect of these nonideal characteristics on the op-amp
circuits.
General Design Philosophy
All stages of the operational ampliﬁer circuit are direct coupled. There are no cou-
pling capacitors and there are also no bypass capacitors. These types of capacitors
would require extremely large areas on the IC chip and hence are impractical. In ad-
dition, resistors whose values are over approximately 50 k are avoided in ICs, since
they also require large areas and introduce parasitic effects. Op-amp circuits are de-
signed with transistors having matching characteristics.
13.1.1

We may begin to design a simple bipolar operational ampliﬁer by using the
knowledge gained in the previous chapters. Figure 13.2 shows the general conﬁgu-
ration of the circuit. The ﬁrst stage will be a differential pair, Q1 and Q2, biased with
a Widlar current source, Q3, Q4, and R2, and using a three-transistor active load.
Assuming matched transistors, we expect the dc voltage at the collector of Q6 to be
two base-emitter voltage drops below the positive bias voltage. Therefore, the
Darlington pair, Q8 and Q9, that forms the second stage should be properly biased.
The bias current for Q8 is supplied by the Widlar current source, Q4, Q10, and R3. The
output stage is the complementary push–pull, emitter-follower conﬁguration of Q11
and Q12. The crossover distortion is eliminated by including the diodes D1 and D2.
The emitter-follower conﬁguration provides low output resistance so that the op-amp
can drive a load with minimal loading effect. By changing the value of R3 slightly,
the current through Q10 and Q8 can be changed, which will change the collector–
emitter voltages across these transistors. This part of the circuit then acts as a dc
voltage shifter such that the output voltage, vO, can be set equal to zero for zero
input voltages.
From results that we have derived previously, we expect the differential-mode
voltage gain of the ﬁrst stage to be in the range of 102–103, depending on the speciﬁc
transistor parameters and the voltage gain of the second stage to also be the range of
102–103. The voltage gain of the output stage, an emitter follower, is essentially
unity. The overall voltage gain of the op-amp circuit is then expected to be in the
range of 104–106. From our study in Chapter 9, this magnitude of voltage gain is
required for the circuit to act essentially as an ideal op-amp.
The same op-amp conﬁguration can be designed with MOS transistors. In
general, as we have seen, BJT circuits have higher voltage gains, whereas MOSFET
circuits have higher input resistances. So, whether a bipolar or MOSFET design is
used depends to a large extent on the speciﬁc application of the op-amp.

Circuit Element Matching
Integrated circuit design is based directly on the ability to fabricate transistors on a
chip that have nearly identical characteristics. In the analysis of current mirrors in
Chapter 10 and differential ampliﬁers in Chapter 11, we assumed that transistors in a
given circuit were matched. Transistors are matched when they have identical
parameters. For bipolar transistors, the parameters are IS, β, and VA. Recall that IS
includes the electrical parameters of the semiconductor material as well as the cross-
sectional area (geometry) of the base-emitter junction. For NMOS transistors, the
parameters are VT N, Kn, and λn, and for PMOS transistors, the same corresponding
parameters must be identical. Again, recall that the parameter Kn contains semicon-
ductor parameters as well as the width-to-length (geometry) of the transistor.
The absolute parameter values of transistors on an IC chip may vary substan-
tially (on the order of ±25 percent) from one IC chip to the next because of process-
ing variations. However, the variation in parameter values of adjacent or nearby
transistors on a given IC chip are usually within a fraction of a percent. In general,
much of an ampliﬁer design is based on the ratio of transistor parameters and on the
ratio of resistor values rather than on the absolute values. For this reason, the opera-
tional ampliﬁers described in this chapter can be fabricated as ICs, but are almost
impossible to fabricate with discrete circuit elements.

A BIPOLAR OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT
Objective: • Describe and analyze the dc and ac characteristics of
the classic 741 bipolar operational ampliﬁer circuit.
The 741 op-amp has been produced since 1966 by many semiconductor device
manufacturers. Since then, there have been many advances in op-amp design, but the
741 is still a widely used general-purpose op-amp. Even though the 741 is a fairly old
design, it still provides a useful case study to describe the general circuit conﬁgura-
tion and to perform a detailed dc and small-signal analysis. From the ac analysis, we
determine the voltage gain and the frequency response of this circuit.
Circuit Description
Figure 13.3 shows the equivalent circuit of the 741 op-amp. For easier analysis, we break
the overall circuit down into its basic circuits and consider each one individually.

Figure 13.3 Equivalent circuit, 741 op-amp
As with most op-amps, this circuit consists of three stages: the input differential
ampliﬁer, the gain stage, and the output stage. Figure 13.3 also shows a separate bias
circuit, which establishes the bias currents throughout the op-amp. Like most op-
amps, the 741 is biased with both positive and negative supply voltages. This elimi-
nates the need for input coupling capacitors, which in turn means that the circuit is
also a dc ampliﬁer. The dc output voltage is zero when the applied differential input
signal is zero. Typical supply voltages are V + = 15 V and V −= −15 V, although
input voltages as low as ±5 V can be used.
Input Diff-Amp
The input diff-amp stage is more complex than those previously covered. The input
stage consists of transistors Q1 through Q7, with biasing established by transistors Q8
through Q12. The two input transistors Q1 and Q2 act as emitter followers, which
results in a high differential input resistance. The differential output currents from Q1
and Q2 are the inputs to the common-base ampliﬁer formed by Q3 and Q4, which
provides a relatively large voltage gain.
Transistors Q5, Q6, and Q7, with associated resistors R1, R2, and R3, form the
active load for the diff-amp. A single-sided output at the common collectors of Q4
and Q6 is the input signal to the following gain stage.
The dc output voltage at the collector of Q6 is at a lower potential than the inputs
at the bases of Q1 and Q2. As the signal passes through the op-amp, the dc voltage
level shifts several times. By design, when the signal reaches the output terminal, the

dc voltage should be zero if a zero differential input signal is applied. The two null
terminals on the input stage are used to make appropriate adjustments to accomplish
this design goal. The “null technique” and the corresponding portion of the circuit
will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.
The dc current biasing is initiated through the diode-connected transistors Q12
and Q11 and resistor R5. Transistors Q11 and Q10, with resistor R4, form a Widlar
current source that establishes the bias currents in the common-base transistors Q3
and Q4, as well as the current mirror formed by Q9 and Q8.
Transistors Q3 and Q4 are lateral pnp devices, which refers to the fabrication
process and the geometry of the transistors. Lateral pnp transistors provide added
protection against voltage breakdown, although the current gain is smaller than in
npn devices.
Figure 13.4(a) shows a basic common-emitter differential pair used as the input
to a diff-amp. If the input voltage V1 were to be connected to a supply voltage of
15 V, with V2 at ground potential, then the B–E junction of Q2 would be reverse bi-
ased by approximately 14.3 V. Since the breakdown voltage of an npn B–E junction
is typically in the range of 3–6 V, transistor Q2 in Figure 13.4(a) would probably
enter breakdown and suffer permanent damage.

By comparison, Figure 13.4(b) shows the input stage of the 741 op-amp with the
same input voltages. The B–E junctions of Q1 and Q3 are forward biased, which means
that the series combination of B–E junctions of Q2 and Q4 is reverse biased by approx-
imately 13.6 V. The breakdown voltage of a lateral pnp B–E junction is typically on the
order of 50 V, which means that for this input voltage polarity, the B–E junction of Q4
provides the necessary breakdown protection for the input diff-amp stage.
Gain Stage
The second, or gain, stage consists of transistors Q16 and Q17. Transistor Q16 operates
as an emitter follower; therefore, the input resistance of the gain stage is large. As
previously discussed, a large input resistance to the gain stage minimizes loading
effects on the diff-amp stage.
Transistor Q13 is effectively two transistors connected in parallel, with common
base and emitter terminals. The area of Q13A is effectively one-fourth the area of Q12,

and the area of Q13B is effectively three-fourths that of Q12. Transistor Q13B provides
the bias current for Q17 and also acts as an active load to produce a high-voltage gain.
Transistor Q17 operates in a common-emitter conﬁguration; therefore, the voltage at
the collector of Q17 is the input signal to the output stage. The signal undergoes
another dc level shift as it goes through this gain stage.
The 741 is internally compensated by the feedback capacitor C1 connected
between the output and input terminals of the gain stage. This Miller compensation
technique assures that the 741 op-amp forms stable feedback circuits.
Output Stage
The output stage of an op-amp should provide a low output resistance, as well as a
current gain, if it is to drive relatively large load currents. The output stage is there-
fore a class-AB circuit consisting of the complementary emitter-follower pair Q14
and Q20.
The output of the gain stage is connected to the base of Q22, which operates as
an emitter follower and provides a very high input resistance; the gain stage therefore
suffers no signiﬁcant loading effects due to the output stage. Transistor Q13A provides
a bias current for Q22, as well as for Q18 and Q19, which are used to establish a qui-
escent bias current in the output transistors Q14 and Q20. Transistors Q15 and Q21 are
referred to as short-circuit protection devices. These transistors are normally off;
they conduct only if the output is inadvertently connected to ground, resulting in a
very large output current. We will consider the characteristics of the output stage in
Section 13.2.2.
An abbreviated data sheet for the 741 is shown in Table 13.1. During our
discussions in this chapter, we will compare our analysis results to the values in the
table. A more complete data sheet for the 741 op-amp is given in Appendix B.

DC Analysis
In this section, we will analyze the dc characteristics of the 741 op-amp to determine
the dc bias currents. We assume that both the noninverting and inverting input termi-
nals are at ground potential, and that the dc supply voltages are V + = 15 V and
V −= −15 V. As an approximation, we assume VBE = 0.6 V for npn transistors and
VE B = 0.6 V for pnp transistors. In most dc calculations, we neglect dc base
currents, although we include base current effects in a few speciﬁc cases.
13.2.2

Bias Circuit and Input Stage
Figure 13.5 shows the bias circuit and input stage portion of the 741 circuit. The
reference current, which is established in the bias circuit branch composed of Q12,
Q11, and R5, is
IREF = V + −VE B12 −VBE11 −V −
R5
(13.1)
Transistors Q11 and Q10 and resistor R4 form a Widlar current source. Therefore, IC10
is determined from the relationship
IC10R4 = VT ln
 IREF
IC10

(13.2)
where VT is the thermal voltage and Q10 and Q11 are assumed to be matched transistors.
Neglecting base currents, IC8 = IC9 = IC10. The quiescent collector currents in
Q1 through Q4 are then
IC1 = IC2 = IC3 = IC4 = IC10
2
(13.3)
Assuming the dc currents in the input stage are exactly balanced, the dc voltage at the
collector of Q6, which is the input to the second stage, is the same as the dc voltage
at the collector of Q5. We can write
VC6 = VBE7 + VBE6 + IC6R2 + V −
(13.4)
As previously discussed, the dc level shifts through the op-amp.

EXAMPLE 13.1
Objective: Calculate the dc currents in the bias circuit and input stage of the
741 op-amp.
The bias circuit and input stage are shown in Figure 13.5.

IC10

By trial and error, we ﬁnd that IC10 = 19 μA. The bias currents in the input stage
are then
IC1 = IC2 = IC3 = IC4 = 9.5 μA
From Equation (13.4), the voltage at the collector of Q6 is
VC6 = VBE7 + VBE6 + IC6R2 + V −= 0.6 + 0.6 + (0.0095)(1) + (−15)
or
VC6 ∼= −13.8 V
Comment: The bias currents in the input stage are quite small; the input base
currents at the noninverting and inverting terminals are generally in the nanoampere
range. Small bias currents mean that the differential input resistance is large.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.1: Consider the input stage and bias circuit of the 741 op-amp shown in
Figure 13.5. The resistor R5 is changed to R5 = 25 k, and the bias voltages
are V + = 5 V and V −= −5 V. Let VBE(on) = VE B(on) = 0.6 V and neglect
base currents. Determine the currents IREF, IC10, IC1, and IC2. (Ans. IREF =
0.352 mA, IC10 = 16 μA, IC1 = IC2 = 8 μA)
The transistor current gain of the lateral pnp transistors Q3, Q4, Q8, and Q9 may
be relatively small, which means that the base currents in these transistors may not
be negligible. To determine the effect of the base currents, consider the expanded
input stage shown in Figure 13.6. The base currents in the npn transistors are still
assumed to be negligible. Current IC10 establishes the base currents in Q3 and Q4,
which then establish the emitter currents designated as I. At the Q8 collector,
we have

Even if the pnp transistor base currents are not negligible, the bias currents in Q1 and
Q2 are, from Equation (13.6), very nearly
I = IC10

(13.7)
This bias current is essentially the same as originally assumed in Equation (13.3).
Gain Stage
Figure 13.7 shows the reference portion of the bias circuit and the gain stage. The
reference current is given by Equation (13.1). Transistors Q12 and Q13 form a current
mirror, and Q13B has a scale factor 0.75 times that of Q12. Neglecting base currents,
current IC13B is then
IC13B = 0.75IREF
(13.8)
The emitter current in Q16 is the sum of the base current in Q17 and the current in R9,
as follows:

0.72 mA. From Equation (13.8), the collector current in Q17 is

or

Comment: The small bias current in Q16, in conjunction with the resistor R9, ensures
that the input resistance to the gain stage is large, which minimizes loading effects on
the diff-amp stage. The small bias current in Q16 also means that the base current in
Q16 is negligible, as assumed in the dc analysis of the input stage.

Output Stage
Figure 13.8 shows the basic output stage of the 741 op-amp. This is a class-AB con-
ﬁguration, discussed in Chapter 8. The IBias is supplied by Q13A, and the input signal
is applied to the base of Q22, which operates as an emitter follower. The combination
of Q18 and Q19 establishes two B–E voltage drops between the base terminals of Q14
and Q20, causing the output transistors to be biased slightly in the conducting state.
This VBB voltage produces quiescent collector currents in Q14 and Q20. Biasing both
Q14 and Q20 “on” with no signal present at the input ensures that the output stage will
respond linearly when a signal is applied to the op-amp input.

The collector of Q13A has a scale factor of 0.25 times that of Q12. Neglecting base
currents, current IC13A is
IC13A = 0.25IREF = IBias

current in Q22 is also equal to IBias. The collector current in Q18 is

(13.11)
Therefore,
IC19 = IBias −IC18
(13.12)
EXAMPLE 13.3
Objective: Calculate the bias currents in the output stage of the 741 op-amp.
Consider the output stage shown in Figure 13.8. Assume the reverse saturation
currents of Q18 and Q19 are IS = 10−14 A, and the reverse saturation currents of Q14
and Q20 are IS = 3 × 10−14 A. Neglect base currents.

Solution: The reference current, from Example 13.1, is IREF = 0.72 mA. Current
IC13A is then
IC13A = (0.25)IREF = (0.25)(0.72) = 0.18 mA ∼= IBias
If we assume VBE19 = 0.6 V, then the current in R10 is
IR10 = VBE19
R10
= 0.6
50 = 0.012 mA
The current in Q19 is
IC19 ∼= IE19 = IC13A −IR10 = 0.18 −0.012 = 0.168 mA
For this value of collector current, the B–E voltage of Q19 is
VBE19 = VT ln
 IC19

devices, the base current in Q19 is
IB19 = IC19
βn
= 168 μA
200
= 0.84 μA
The current in Q18 is now
IC18 ∼= IE18 = IR10 + IB19 = 12 + 0.84 = 12.84 μA
The B–E voltage of Q18 is therefore
VBE18 = VT ln
 IC18

= 0.545 V
The voltage difference VBB is thus
VBB = VBE18 + VBE19 = 0.545 + 0.612 = 1.157 V
Since the output transistors Q14 and Q20 are identical, one-half of VBB is across each
B–E junction. The quiescent currents in Q14 and Q20 are
IC14 = IC20 = ISe(VBB/2)/VT = 3 × 10−14e(1.157/2)/0.026
or
IC14 = IC20 = 138 μA
Comment: Using the piecewise linear approximation of 0.6 V for the B–E junction
voltage does not allow us to determine the quiescent currents in Q14 and Q20. For a
more accurate analysis, the exponential relationship must be used, since the base–
emitter areas of the output transistors are larger than those of the other transistors, and
because the output transistors are biased at a low quiescent current.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.3: Calculate the bias currents IC13A, IR10, IC19, IC18, and IC14 in the output
stage of the 741 op-amp for IREF = 0.50 mA, V + = 5 V, and V −= −5 V. All
other parameters are the same as described in Example 13.3. (Ans. IC13A =
0.125 mA, IR10 = 0.012 mA, IC19 = 0.113 mA, IC18 = 12.565 μA, IC14 =
0.113 mA)
Chapter 13 Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
959

As the input signal vI increases, the base voltage of Q14 increases since the VBB
voltage remains almost constant. The output voltage increases at approximately the
same rate as the input signal. As vI decreases, the base voltage of Q20 decreases, and
the output voltage also decreases, again at approximately the same rate as the input
signal. The small-signal voltage gain of the output stage is essentially unity.
Short-Circuit Protection Circuitry
The output stage includes a number of transistors that are off during the normal
operation of the ampliﬁer. If the output terminal is at a positive voltage because of an
applied input signal, and if the terminal is inadvertently shorted to ground potential,
a large current will be induced in output transistor Q14. A large current can produce
sufﬁcient heating to cause transistor burnout.
The complete output stage of the 741, including the short-circuit protection
devices, is shown in Figure 13.9. Resistor R6 and transistor Q15 limit the current in Q14
in the event of a short circuit. If the current in Q14 reaches 20 mA, the voltage drop
across R6 is 540 mV, which is sufﬁcient to bias Q15 in the conducting stage. As Q15
turns on, excess base current into Q14 is shunted through the collector of Q15. The base
current into Q14 is then limited to a maximum value, which limits the collector current.

The maximum current in Q20 is limited by components R7, Q21, and Q24, in much
the same way as just discussed. A large output current will result in a voltage drop
across R7, which will be sufﬁcient to bias Q21 in its conducting state. Transistors Q21
and Q24 will shunt excessive output current away from Q20, to protect this output
transistor.

Small-Signal Analysis
We can analyze the small-signal voltage gain of the 741 op-amp by dividing it into
its basic circuits and using results previously obtained.
Input Stage
Figure 13.10 shows the ac equivalent circuit of the input stage with a differential
voltage vd applied between the input terminals. The constant-current biasing at the
base of Q3 and Q4 means that the effective impedance connected to the base terminal
of Q3 and Q4 is ideally inﬁnite, or an open circuit. Resistance Ract1 is the effective
resistance of the active load and Ri2 is the input resistance of the gain stage.

where ICQ is the quiescent collector current in each of the transistors Q1 through Q4,
and ro4 is the small-signal output resistance looking into the collector of Q4. Using ro4
as the resistance looking into the collector of Q4 neglects the effective resistance in the
emitter of Q4. This effective resistance is simply the resistance looking into the emit-
ter of Q2, which is normally very small. The minus sign in the voltage gain expression
results from the applied signal voltage polarity and resulting current directions.

The effective resistance of the active load is given by
Ract1 = ro6 [1 + gm6(R2∥rπ6)]
(13.14)
as determined in Chapter 10 for the output resistance of a Widlar current source.

Objective: Determine the small-signal differential voltage gain of the 741 op-amp
input stage.
Assume npn transistor gains of βn = 200 and Early voltages of VA = 50 V.
Solution: The quiescent collector currents were determined previously in this chap-
ter. The input resistance to the gain stage is found from Equations (13.15) and
(13.16), as follows:

Therefore,

Also,

Consequently,
Ri2 = rπ16 + (1 + βn)R′

We develop the small-signal voltage gain using Figure 13.11 directly. The input

(13.17)
where Ri2 is the input resistance to the gain stage. The base current into Q17 is

R9 + [rπ17 + (1 + βn)R8] × ie16
(13.18)
where ie16 is the emitter current from Q16. The output voltage is
vo2 = −ic17(Ract2 ∥Ri3∥Ro17)
(13.19)

where ic17 is the ac collector current in Q17 and Ro17 is the output impedance looking
into the collector of Q17. Combining Equations (13.17), (13.18), and (13.19), we get
the following expression for the small-signal voltage gain:
Av2 = vo2
vo1
= −βn(1 + βn)R9(Ract2 ∥Ri3∥Ro17)
Ri2{R9 + [rπ17 + (1 + βn)R8]}
(13.20)
The effective resistance of the active load is the resistance looking into the
collector of Q13B, or
Ract2 = ro13B =
VA
IC13B
(13.21)
The input resistance of the output stage can be determined from the ac equiva-
lent circuit in Figure 13.12. In this ﬁgure, we assume that the pnp output transistor
Q20 is active and the npn output transistor Q14 is cut off. A load resistor RL is also
included. Transistor Q22 operates as an emitter follower, which means that the input
resistance is
Ri3 = rπ22 + (1 + βp)[R19∥R20]
(13.22)
Resistance R19 is the series combination of the resistance looking into the emitters of
Q19 and Q18, and the resistance looking into the collector of Q13A. The effective
resistance of the combination of Q18 and Q19 is small compared to R13A; therefore,
R19 ∼= R13A = ro13A =
VA
IC13A
(13.23)
The output transistor Q20 is also an emitter follower; therefore,
R20 = rπ20 + (1 + βp)RL

EXAMPLE 13.5
Objective: Determine the small-signal voltage gain of the second stage of the 741
op-amp.
Assume the current gains of the pnp transistors are βp = 50 and the gains of the
npn transistors are βn = 200. Also assume the Early voltage is 50 V for all transistors
and the load resistance connected to the output is RL = 2 k. The dc quiescent
currents were determined previously.
Solution: First, we calculate the various resistances. To begin,
rπ20 = βpVT
IC20
= (50)(0.026)
0.138
= 9.42 k
which means that
R20 = rπ20 + (1 + βp)RL = 9.42 + (51)(2) ∼= 111 k
Also,
R19 = ro13A =
VA
IC13A
= 50
0.18 = 278 k
and
rπ22 = βpVT
IC13A
= (50)(0.026)
0.18
= 7.22 k
The input resistance to the output stage is therefore
Ri3 = rπ22 + (1 + βp)[R19 ∥R20] = 7.22 + (51)[278 ∥111] ⇒4.05 M
The effective resistance of the active load is
Ract2 =
VA
IC13B
= 50
0.54 = 92.6 k
and the output resistance Ro17 is
Ro17 ∼= VA
IC17
= 50
0.54 = 92.6 k
This calculation neglects the very small value of R8 in the emitter.
From Equation (13.20), the small-signal voltage gain is as follows (all resis-
tances are given in kilohms):
Av2 = −βn(1 + βn)R9(Ract2∥Ri3∥Ro17)
Ri2{R9 + [rπ17 + (1 + βn)R8]}
= −(200)(201)(50)(92.6∥4050∥92.6)
4070{50 + [9.63 + (201)(0.1)]}
or
Av2 = −285
Comment: The voltage gain of the second stage is fairly large, again because an
active load is used and because there is no severe loading effect from the output stage.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.5: Repeat Example 13.5 assuming Early voltages of VA = 100 V.
(Ans. A2 = −562)
Overall Gain
In calculating the voltage gain of each stage, we took the loading effect of the
following stage into account. Therefore, the overall voltage gain is the product of the
individual gain factors, or
Av = Ad Av2Av3
(13.25)
where Av3 is the voltage gain of the output stage. If we assume that Av3 ≈1, as pre-
viously discussed, then the overall gain of the 741 op-amp is
Av = Ad Av2Av3 = (−636)(−285)(1) = 181,260
(13.26)
Typical voltage gain values for the 741 op-amp are in the range of 200,000. The
value determined in our calculations illustrates the magnitude of voltage gains that
can be obtained in op-amp circuits.
Output Resistance
The output resistance can be determined by using the ac equivalent circuit in Fig-
ure 13.13. In this case, we assume the output transistor Q20 is conducting and Q14 is
cut off. The same basic result is obtained if Q14 is conducting and Q20 is cut off.

We again rely on results obtained previously for output resistances of basic ampliﬁer
stages.
The output resistance is
Ro = R7 + Re20
(13.27)
where
Re20 = rπ20 + Re22∥Rc19
(1 + βp)
(13.28)
Previously we argued that the series resistance due to Q18 and Q19 is small compared
to Rc13A, so that Rc19 ∼= Rc13A. We also have
Re22 = rπ22 + Rc17∥Rc13B
(1 + βp)
(13.29)
where
Rc13B = ro13B
and
Rc17 = ro17[1 + gm17(R8∥rπ17)]
The output resistance of the op-amp is then found by combining all the resistance
terms.
EXAMPLE 13.6
Objective: Calculate the output resistance of the 741 op-amp.
Consider the output stage conﬁguration in Figure 13.13. Assume the output cur-
rent is Ic20 = 2 mA and all other bias currents are as previously determined.
Solution: Using βn = 200, βp = 50, and VA = 50 V, we ﬁnd the following:
rπ17 = 9.63 k
rπ22 = 7.22 k
rπ20 = 0.65 k
gm17 = 20.8 mA/V
ro17 = 92.6 k
ro13B = 92.6 k
Then,
Rc17 = ro17[1 + gm17(R8∥rπ17)] = 92.6[1 + (20.8)(0.1∥9.63)] = 283 k
and
Re22 = rπ22 + Rc17∥Rc13B
(1 + βp)
= 7.22 + 283∥92.6
51
= 1.51 k
Also,
Rc19 ∼= Rc13A = ro13A =
VA
IC13A
= 50
0.18 = 278 k
Therefore
Re20 = rπ20 + Re22∥Rc19
(1 + βp)
= 0.65 + 1.51∥278
51
= 0.0422 k ⇒42.2 
Consequently, the output resistance is
Ro = R7 + Re20 = 22 + 42.2 = 64.2 
Chapter 13 Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
967

Comment: We showed previously that the output resistance of an emitter-follower
circuit is low. For comparison, typical output resistance values for the 741 op-amp
are 75 . This correlates well with our analysis.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.6: Repeat Example 13.6 assuming Early voltages of VA = 100 V. (Ans.
Ro = 90.9 )
Frequency Response
The 741 op-amp is internally compensated by the Miller compensation technique to
introduce a dominant low-frequency pole. From Miller’s theorem, the effective input
capacitance of the second gain stage is
Ci = C1(1 + |Av2|)
(13.30)
The dominant low-frequency pole is
fP D =
1
2π ReqCi
(13.31)
where Req is the equivalent resistance between the second-stage input node and
ground, and is
Req = Ro1∥Ri2
(13.32)
Here Ri2 is the input resistance of the gain stage and Ro1 is the output resistance of the
diff-amp stage. From Figure 13.10, we see that
Ro1 = Ract1∥ro4
(13.33)
EXAMPLE 13.7
Objective: Determine the dominant-pole frequency of the 741 op-amp.
Use appropriate results from previous calculations.
Solution: Previously, we determined that |Av2| = 285, which means that the effec-
tive input capacitance is
Ci = C1(1 + |Av2|) = (30)(1 + 285) = 8580 pF
The gain stage input resistance was found to be Ri2 = 4.07 M. We ﬁnd
Ro1 = Ract1∥ro4 = 7.18∥5.26 = 3.04 M
The equivalent resistance is then
Req = Ro1∥Ri2 = 3.04∥4.07 = 1.74 M
Finally, the dominant-pole frequency is
fP D =
1
2π ReqCi
=
1
2π(1.74 × 106)(8580 × 10−12) = 10.7 Hz
Comment: The very large equivalent input capacitance Ci justiﬁes neglecting any
other capacitance effects at the gain stage input.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.7: Repeat Example 13.7 assuming Early voltages of VA = 100 V. See
Exercise Problems Ex 13.4, Ex 13.5, and Ex 13.6. (Ans. 3.88 Hz)
If all other poles of the op-amp circuit are at very high frequencies, then the
unity-gain bandwidth is
fT = Ao fP D
(13.34)
Using our results, we ﬁnd that
fT = (181,260)(10.7) ∼= 1.9 MHz
(13.35)
A typical unity-gain bandwidth value for the 741 op-amp is 1 MHz. With all the
approximations and assumptions, such as the value of reverse saturation current and
Early voltage, used in the calculations, a factor of two between the actual and pre-
dicted cutoff frequency is not signiﬁcant.
If the frequencies of the other poles of the 741 op-amp are greater than 1.9 MHz,
the phase margin is 90 degrees. This phase margin ensures that any closed-loop am-
pliﬁer circuit using the 741 op-amp will be stable for any feedback transfer function.
Problem-Solving Technique: Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
1.
DC analysis. The bias portion of the op-amp circuit must be identiﬁed. A
reference current must be determined and then the bias currents in the indi-
vidual building blocks of the overall circuit can be determined.
2.
AC analysis. The small-signal properties of the building blocks of the overall
circuit can be analyzed individually, provided that the loading effects of
follow-on stages are taken into account.

CMOS OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
Objective: • Describe and analyze the dc and ac characteristics of
CMOS operational ampliﬁer circuits.
The 741 bipolar op-amp is a general-purpose op-amp capable of sourcing and sink-
ing reasonably large load currents. The output stage is an emitter follower capable of
supplying the necessary load current, with a low output resistance to minimize load-
ing effects.
In contrast, most CMOS op-amps are designed for speciﬁc on-chip applications
and are only required to drive capacitive loads of a few picofarads. Most CMOS
op-amps therefore do not need a low-resistance output stage, and, if the op-amp in-
puts are not connected directly to the IC external terminals, they also do not need
electrostatic input protection devices.
In this section, we consider four designs of a CMOS op-amp. Initially we con-
sider a simple CMOS design to begin to understand the basic concepts of a CMOS
op-amp. We then analyze a three-stage CMOS op-amp with a complementary push-
pull output stage. The third CMOS op-amp is a more sophisticated design, called a
folded cascode op-amp. Finally, we consider a current-mirror CMOS op-amp. In
each case, we will do a dc analysis/design and a small-signal analysis/design.
MC14573 CMOS Operational Ampliﬁer Circuit
Circuit Description
An example of an all-CMOS op-amp is the MC14573, for which a simpliﬁed circuit
diagram is shown in Figure 13.14. The p-channel transistors M1 and M2 form the
input differential pair, and the n-channel transistors M3 and M4 form the active load.
The diff-amp input stage is biased by the current mirror M5 and M6, in which the
reference current is determined by an external resistor Rset.
The second stage, which is also the output stage, consists of the common-source-
connected transistor M7. Transistor M8 provides the bias current for M7 and acts as the
active load. An internal compensation capacitor C1 is included to provide stability.
DC Analysis
Assuming transistors M5 and M6 are matched, the reference and input-stage bias
currents are given by
Iset = IQ = V + −V −−VSG5
Rset
(13.36)

The reference current and source-to-gate voltage are also related by
Iset = Kp5(VSG5 + VT P)2
(13.37)
where VT P and Kp5 are the threshold voltage and conduction parameter of the
p-channel transistor M5.

n = 100 μA/V2,

p = 40 μA/V2, and circuit parameters of V + = 5 V, V −= −5 V, and Rset = 225 k.
Assume transistor width-to-length ratios of 6.25 for M3 and M4, and 12.5 for all other
transistors.

⇒40.4 μA
The quiescent drain currents in M7 and M8 are then also 40.4 μA, and the currents in
M1 through M4 are 20.2 μA.
Comment: The quiescent bias currents can be changed easily by changing the external
resistor Rset. Transistors M5, M6, and M8 are identical, so the currents in these three
devices are equal since the source-to-gate voltages are the same. The width-to-length
ratio of M7 is twice that of M3 and M4, which means the current in M7 is twice that in
M3 and M4. However, this is consistent with the current-source transistor currents.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.8: Repeat Example 13.8 assuming transistor width-to-length ratios of
(W/L)3,4 = 10 for transistors M3 and M4, and W/L = 20 for all other transistors.
Let Rset = 150 k. (Ans. IREF = IQ = ID7 = ID8 = 60.74 μA, ID1 −ID4 =

Small-Signal Analysis
The small-signal differential voltage gain of the input stage can be written as
Ad = gm (ro2 ∥ro4 ) = 2Kp1IDQ1 (ro2 ∥ro4 ) = 2Kp1IQ (ro2 ∥ro4 )
(13.38)
where ro2 and ro4 are the output resistances of M2 and M4, respectively. The input
impedance to the second stage is essentially inﬁnite; therefore, there is no loading
effect due to the second stage. If we assume that the parameter λ is the same for all
transistors, then
ro2 = ro4 =
1
λID
(13.39)
where ID, which is the quiescent drain current in M2 and M4, is ID = IQ/2.
The magnitude of the gain of the second stage is
Av2 = gm7 (ro7∥ro8)
(13.40)
where
gm7 = 2

Kn7ID7
and
ro7 = ro8 = 1/λID7
Equation (13.40) implies that there is no loading effect due to an external load con-
nected at the output.

Finally, the overall voltage gain magnitude of the op-amp is
Av = Ad Av2 = (176)(197) = 34,672
Comment: The calculated overall voltage gain is 91 dB, which correlates very well
with typical values of 90 dB, as listed in the data sheet for the MC14573 op-amp. The
open-loop gain of a CMOS op-amp is generally less than that of a bipolar op-amp,
but the use of active loads provides acceptable results.

Three-Stage CMOS Operational Ampliﬁer
Figure 13.15 shows a three-stage CMOS op-amp circuit. The differential input stage
consists of the differential pair M1 and M2 with active load transistors M3 and M4. The
input stage is biased with the constant-current source M10 and M11. As shown in Chap-
ter 10, the reference current can be established with additional NMOS transistors.
The output of the input stage is connected to the common-source ampliﬁer con-
sisting of M5. The transistor M9 establishes the bias current IQ2 and also acts as the
active load for the common-source ampliﬁer.
13.3.2
Chapter 13 Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
973

Transistors M6 and M7 form the complementary push–pull output stage. Tran-
sistor M8 acts as a resistor and provides a potential difference between the gates of
the output transistors to minimize crossover distortion in the output signal.
Example width-to-length ratios of the transistors in the CMOS op-amp circuit
are shown in the ﬁgure. These ratios will be used in the following example.
EXAMPLE 13.10
Objective: Determine the dc and ac characteristics of a three-stage CMOS op-amp.
Consider the three-stage CMOS op-amp shown in Figure 13.15. The NMOS
transistor parameters are VT N = 0.7 V, k′
n = 80 μA/V2, λn = 0.01 V−1, and the
PMOS transistor parameters are VT P = −0.7 V, k′
p = 40 μA/V2, λp = 0.015 V−1.
Assume the reference current is IREF = 160 μA.
Solution (DC Analysis): Since M9, M10, and M11 are matched transistors, then
IQ1 = IQ2 = IREF = 160 μA.
Transistors M3 and M4 are matched so that in the quiescent condition, VSG3 =
VSD3 = VSD4. Since VSG5 = VSD4 and since the current in M5 is twice as large as that
in M4, the width-to-length ratio of M5 must be twice as large as that of M3 and M4.
If we provide dc biases of VGS6 = VSG7 = 0.85 V to the output transistors, then
the dc quiescent current in the output transistors will be

Solution (AC Analysis): Since there is no loading effect between stages of the
CMOS op-amp, we can write the overall differential voltage gain as
Av = Ad1A2A3
where the gains Ad1, A2, and A3 are the voltage gains of each individual stage. Since
the output stage is a source-follower circuit, we can write that A3 ∼= 1.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.10: (a) Calculate the differential voltage gains of the ﬁrst and second stages,
and the overall voltage gain of the three-stage CMOS op-amp in Figure 13.15 if
(W/L)1,2 = 22.5 and IREF = 200 μA. All other parameters are the same as given
in Example 13.10. (b) Recalculate (W/L)8 if the quiescent current in the output

Folded Cascode CMOS Operational 
Ampliﬁer Circuit
As we have mentioned previously, the voltage gain of an ampliﬁer can be increased
by using a cascode conﬁguration. In its simplest form, the conventional cascode
conﬁguration consists of two transistors in series, as shown in Figure 13.16(a). The

transistor M1 is the common-source amplifying device whose current is determined
by the input voltage. This current is the input signal to M2, which is connected in a
common-gate conﬁguration. The output is taken off the drain of the cascode tran-
sistor. The circuit in Figure 13.16(b) has a slightly different conﬁguration. The dc
current I1 in M1 is determined by the input voltage. The dc current in M2 is the
difference between the bias current IQ and I1.
The ac current in the conventional cascode circuit of Figure 13.16(a) is through
both transistors and the dc power supply. The ac current in the cascode circuit in Fig-
ure 13.16(b) is through both transistors and ground as indicated in the ﬁgure. The ac
current in M2 of this circuit is equal in magnitude but in the opposite direction to M1.
Thus the current is said to be folded back and the circuit in Figure 13.16(b) is called
a folded cascode circuit.
The folded cascode conﬁguration can be applied to the diff-amp as shown in
Figure 13.17. The transistors M1 and M2 are the differential pair, as usual, and tran-
sistors M5 and M6 are the cascode transistors. Transistors M7–M10 form a modiﬁed
Wilson current mirror acting as an active load. This conﬁguration was discussed in
Chapter 10.
Assuming that transistors M3, M4, and M11–M13 are all matched, then the dc cur-
rents in M1 and M2 are IREF/2 and those in M3 and M4 are IREF. This means that the
dc currents in the cascode transistors M5 and M6 are IREF/2.

Figure 13.17 CMOS folded cascode ampliﬁer

If a differential-mode input voltage is applied, then ac currents are induced in the
differential pair as shown in the ﬁgure. The ac current in M1 ﬂows through M6 to the
output. The ac current in M2 ﬂows through M5 and is induced in M8 by the current-
mirror action of the active load. From previous work on diff-amps, the differential-
mode voltage gain is
Ad = gm1(Ro6∥Ro8)
(13.41)
where
Ro8 = gm8(ro8ro10)
(13.42(a))
and
Ro6 = gm6(ro6)(ro4∥ro1)
(13.42(b))
We may note that we are neglecting the body effect. Normally the substrates
of all NMOS devices are tied to V −and the substrates of all PMOS devices are tied
to V +.

Comment: This example shows that very high differential-mode voltage gains can
be achieved in a folded cascode CMOS circuit. In actual circuits, the output resis-
tances may be limited by leakage currents so the very ideal values may not be realiz-
able. However, substantially higher differential-mode voltage gains can be achieved
in the folded cascode conﬁguration than in the simpler diff-amp circuits.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.11: Assume the reference current in the folded cascode circuit shown in
Figure 13.17 is IREF = 50 μA. Assume the transistor parameters are the same
as given in Example 13.11. Determine the differential-mode voltage gain.
(Ans. ∼= 64,000)
CMOS Current-Mirror Operational Ampliﬁer Circuit
Another CMOS op-amp circuit is shown in Figure 13.18. The differential pair is
formed by M1 and M2. The induced ac currents from these transistors drive transis-
tors M3 and M4, which are the inputs of two current mirrors with a current multipli-
cation factor B. The current output of M5 is then induced in M8 by the current-mirror
action of M7 and M8. The output signal currents then have a multiplication factor B.
The differential-mode voltage gain is then given by
Ad = vo
vd
= Bgm1(ro6∥ro8)
(13.43)
The factor of B in the gain expression of Equation (13.43) may be slightly mislead-
ing. Recall that the individual transistor output resistance is inversely proportional to
the drain current. If the current in the output transistors increases by the factor B, then

Ro = ro6∥ro8 decreases by the factor B so the differential-mode voltage gain remains
unchanged.
The advantage of the current-mirror op-amp is an increase in the gain–bandwidth
product. The dominant-pole frequency will be determined by the parameters at the
output node. The dominant-pole frequency is given by
fpd =
1
2π Ro(CL + Cp)
(13.44)
where Ro is the output resistance, CL is the load capacitance, and Cp is the sum of all
other capacitances at the output node. If Ro decreases by the factor B, then the dominant-
pole frequency increases by the same factor B. The gain–bandwidth product is
GBW = Ad · fpd
(13.45)
Since Ad is now independent of B and fpd increases by B, then the gain–bandwidth
product increases by B.
Further analysis of this circuit shows that the phase margin decreases with in-
creasing B.As a practical limit, the maximum value of B is limited to approximately 3.
CMOS Cascode Current-Mirror Op-Amp Circuit
As we have already seen, the differential-mode gain can be increased by adding cas-
code transistors in the output portion of the circuit. Figure 13.19 shows the same
current-mirror conﬁguration considered previously but with cascode transistors
added to the output. Transistors M9–M12 are the cascode transistors. The differential-
mode voltage gain is given by

BiCMOS OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
Objective: • Describe and analyze the dc and ac characteristics of
BiCMOS operational ampliﬁer circuits.
As discussed in Chapter 11, BiCMOS circuits combine the advantages of bipolar and
MOSFET devices in the same circuit. One advantage of MOSFETs is the very high
input impedance. Therefore, when MOSFETs form the input differential pair of an
op-amp, the input bias currents are extremely small. However, the equivalent noise
of the input stage may be greater than for an all-BJT op-amp.
In this section, we will examine two BiCMOS op-amp circuits. The ﬁrst is a vari-
ation of the folded cascode conﬁguration analyzed in the last section and the second is
Chapter 13 Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
981

the CA3140 BiCMOS op-amp. Since we previously fully analyzed the folded cas-
code circuit, we will discuss, here, the advantages of using the BiCMOS technology.
Many features of the CA3140 BiCMOS op-amp are similar to those of the 741.
Therefore, we will not analyze this op-amp in as great a detail as we did the 741. In-
stead, we will concentrate on some of its unique features.
BiCMOS Folded Cascode Op-Amp
Figure 13.20 shows an example of a BiCMOS folded cascode op-amp. The cascode
transistors, Q5 and Q6, are now bipolar devices, replacing n-channel MOSFETs.
The small-signal voltage gain expression for this circuit is identical to that of the
all-CMOS design. We have mentioned that the dominant-pole frequency is deter-
mined by the circuit parameters at the output node because of the very large output
resistance. Nondominant-pole frequencies are then a function of the parameters at
the other circuit nodes. In particular, one node of interest is at the drain of an input
transistor and emitter of a cascode transistor. The nondominant-pole frequency can
be written as

where gm6 is the transconductance of the cascode transistor Q6 and Cp6 is the effec-
tive capacitance at this node. Since the transconductance of a bipolar is usually
greater than that of a MOSFET, this 3 dB frequency is larger for the BiCMOS circuit
than for the all-CMOS design. This result means that the phase margin of the
BiCMOS op-amp circuit is larger than that of the all-CMOS op-amp.
CA3140 BiCMOS Circuit Description
Figure 13.21 shows the basic equivalent circuit of the CA3140 op-amp. Like the 741,
this op-amp consists of three basic stages: the input differential stage, the gain stage, and

the output stage. Also shown in the ﬁgure are: the bias circuit, which establishes the dc
bias currents in the op-amp; and a section referred to as a dynamic current sink, which
will be explained later. Typical supply voltages are V + = 15 V and V −= −15 V.
Input Diff-Amp
The input differential pair consists of p-channel transistors M9 and M10, and transis-
tors Q11 and Q12 form the active load for the diff-amp. A single-sided output at the
collector of Q12 is the input signal to the following gain stage. Two offset null termi-
nals are also shown, and will be discussed in the next chapter.
MOS transistors are very susceptible to damage from electrostatic charge. For 
example, electrostatic voltage can be inadvertently induced on the gate of a MOSFET
during routine handling. These voltages may be great enough to induce breakdown in
the gate oxide, destroying the device. Therefore, input protection against electrostatic
damage is provided by the Zener diodes D3, D4, and D5. If the gate voltage becomes
large enough, these diodes will provide a discharge path for the electrostatic charge,
thus protecting the gate oxide from breakdown.
The dc current biasing is initiated in the bias circuit. The elements labeled D1
and D2 are diode-connected transistors. Transistor Q1 and diode D1 are matched,
which forces the currents in the two branches of the bias circuit to be equal. The cur-
rent is determined from Q7, R1, and M8. The combination of Q6 and Q7 makes the
bias current essentially independent of the power supply voltages.
Gain Stage: The second stage consists of Q13 connected in a common-emitter
conﬁguration. The cascode conﬁguration of transistors Q3 and Q4 provides the bias
current for Q13, in addition to acting as the active load. Since Q3 and Q4 are connected
in a cascode conﬁguration, the resistance looking into the collector of Q4 is very high.
Output Stage: The basic output stage consists of the npn transistors Q17 and Q18.
During the positive portion of the output voltage cycle, Q18 acts as an emitter fol-
lower, supplying a load current. During the negative portion of the output voltage
cycle, Q16 sinks current from the load. As the output voltage decreases, the source-
to-gate voltage on the p-channel M21 MOSFET increases, producing a larger current
in D6 and R7 so that the base voltage on Q16 increases. The increase B–E voltage of
Q16 allows increased load current sinking. Short-circuit protection is provided by the
combination of R11 and Q19. If a sufﬁciently large voltage is developed across R11,
Q19 turns on and shunts excess base current away from Q17.
An abbreviated data sheet for the CA3140 op-amp is in Table 13.2. As before,
we will compare the results of our analysis to the values listed in the table.

CA3140 DC Analysis
In this section, we will determine the dc bias currents in the CA3l40 op-amp. As pre-
viously stated, we will concentrate on the features that are unique to the CA3140
compared to the 741.
13.4.3

The basic bias circuit is shown in Figure l3.22. The current mirror consisting of
Q1 and D1 ensures that the two branch currents I1 and I2 are equal, since Q1 and D1
are matched. The p-channel MOSFET M8 is to operate in the saturation region, so
that we must have
VSD > VSG −|VT P|
(13.50)
From the ﬁgure, we see that
VSG = VSD + VD
(13.51)
or
VSD = VSG −VD
(13.52)
Combining Equations (13.52) and (13.50) yields
VSG −VD > VSG −|VT P|
(13.53)
which implies that |VT P| > VD. In other words, for M8 to remain biased in the saturation
region, the magnitude of the threshold voltage must be greater than the diode voltage.
From the left branch of the bias circuit, we see that the current can be written
I2 ∼= IR1 = VSG −VBE7
R1
(13.54)
and from the right branch, we have
I1 = Kp(VSG −|VT P|)2
(13.55)
Since I1 = I2, a simultaneous solution of Equations (13.54) and (13.55) determines
the currents and voltages in this bias circuit.
EXAMPLE 13.12
Objective: Determine the currents and voltages in the bias circuit of the
CA3140 op-amp.
Consider the bias circuit in Figure 13.22, with parameters: V + = 15 V, V −=
−15 V, and R1 = 8 k. Assume transistor parameters of VBE(npn) = VE B(pnp) =
0.6 V for the bipolars, and Kp = 0.2 mA/V2 and |VT P| = 1.4 V for the MOSFET M8.
Solution: Set I1 = I2. Then, from Equations (13.54) and (13.55), we ﬁnd
VSG = 2.49 V
and
I1 = I2 = 0.236 mA
The voltage at the collector of Q6 is
VC6 = VSG8 + V −= 2.49 −15 = −12.5 V
and the voltage at the collector of Q7 is
VC7 = V + −VE B1 −VE B6 = 15 −0.6 −0.6 = 13.8 V
Therefore, the collector–base junctions of both Q6 and Q7 are reverse biased by
13.8 −(−12.5) = 26.3 V, and both Q6 and Q7 are biased in the active region.
Comment: The nominal bias current listed in Table 13.2 is 200 μA, which correlates
well with our calculated value of 236 μA. As long as the B–C junctions of Q6 and Q7
remain reverse biased, the bias currents remain constant. This means that the bias
current is independent of V + and V −over a wide range of voltages.

The PSpice analysis, using IS = 2 × 10−15 A for the BJTs shows that the cur-
rents in the two branches of the current source are essentially 220 μA. This compares
very favorably with the 236 μA obtained by the hand analysis.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.12: (a) Assume the bias circuit of the CA3140 op-amp circuit shown in
Figure 13.22 has supply voltages of V + = 5 V and V −= −5 V. Let R1 = 10 k.
The transistor parameters are VT P = −0.8 V and Kp = 0.15 mA/V2 for M8; and
VBE7(on) = VE B6 = 0.6 V for the bipolars. Find the currents I1 and I2; and the
voltages VSG8, VC7, VC6, VC B7, and VBC6. (b) Using the results of part (a),
determine the minimum supply voltages that will still maintain the bipolar tran-
sistors biased in the forward active region. Assume V + = −V −. (Ans. (a) I1 =
I2 = 0.1028 mA, VSG8 = 1.628 V, VC7 = 3.8 V, VC6 = −3.37 V, VC B7 = VBC6 =
7.17 V; (b) V + = −V −= 1.414 V)
Transistors Q1 through Q6 and diode D1 in Figure 13.21 are all matched, which
means that IC5 = IC4 ∼= 200 μA. The current in D2 establishes the diode voltage that
also biases Q14 and Q15. The nominal value of IC18 is 2 mA.
CA3140 Small-Signal Analysis
We analyze the small-signal voltage gain of the CA3140 op-amp by dividing the con-
ﬁguration into its basic circuits and using results previously obtained.
Input Stage
From the results in Chapter 11, the small-signal differential voltage gain can be written
Ad =

2KpIQ5(ro10∥Ract1∥Ri2)
(13.56)
where IQ5 is the bias current supplied by Q2 and Q5. Resistance ro10 is the output
resistance looking into the drain of M10, Ract1 is the effective resistance of the active
load, and Ri2 is the input resistance of the gain stage.
EXAMPLE 13.13
Objective: Calculate the small-signal differential voltage gain of the CA3140 op-
amp input stage. Assume a bias current of IQ = 0.2 mA.
Assume a conduction parameter value of Kp = 0.6 mA/V2 for M10, an npn
bipolar current gain of βn = 200, and a bipolar Early voltage of VA = 50 V.
Solution: The input resistance to the gain stage is Ri2 = rπ13; therefore,
Ri2 = rπ13 = βnVT
IC13
= (200)(0.026)
0.20
= 26 k
Resistances ro10 and Ract1 are normally in the hundreds of kilohms or megohm range,
so the small value of Ri2 dominates the parallel resistance value in the gain expres-
sion. We then have
Ad ∼=

2KpIQ5(Ri2) =

2(0.6)(0.2)(26) = 12.7
Comment: The low input resistance of the gain stage severely loads the input stage,
which in turn results in a relatively low voltage gain for the input stage.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 13.13: Repeat Example 13.13 for the case when Kp = 1 mA/V2 for M10 and
when the Early voltage of a bipolar transistor is VA = 120 V. All other circuit and
transistor parameters are the same as given in Example 13.13. (Ans. Ad = 16.4)
Gain Stage
The magnitude of the small-signal voltage gain for the second stage is
|Av2| = gm13(ro13∥Ro4∥Ri3)
(13.57)
where Ri3 is the input resistance of the output stage and Ro4 is the output resistance of
the cascode conﬁguration of Q3 and Q4. Transistor Q17, which is the input transistor
of the output stage, is connected as an emitter follower, which means that Ri3 is typ-
ically in the megohm range. Similarly, the output resistance Ro4 of the cascode con-
ﬁguration is typically in the megohm range.
The voltage gain of the second stage is then approximately
|Av2| ∼= gm13ro13
(13.58)
EXAMPLE 13.14
Objective: Calculate the small-signal voltage gain of the second stage of the
CA3140 op-amp.
Assume an Early voltage of VA = 50 V for Q13.
Solution: The transconductance is
gm13 = IC13
VT
= 0.20
0.026 = 7.69 mA/V
and the output resistance is
ro13 = VA
IC13
= 50
0.20 = 250 k
The voltage gain is therefore
|Av2| = gm13ro13 = (7.69)(250) = 1923
Comment: The second stage of the CA3l40 operational ampliﬁer provides the
majority of the voltage gain.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 13.14: Assume the gain stage of the CA3140 op-amp is modiﬁed to include
an emitter resistor, as shown in Figure 13.23. Let λ = 0.02 V−1 for M10. Assume
all other transistor parameters are the same as those in Example 13.13. If the tran-
sistor bias currents in M10 and Q12 are 100 μA and the current in Q13 is 200 μA,
determine the new value of the small-signal differential voltage gain of the input
stage. (Ans. 69.1)

Overall Gain
Since we have taken the loading effects of each following stage into account, the
overall voltage gain is the product of the individual gain factors, or
Av = Ad Av2Av3
(13.59)
where Av3 is the voltage gain of the output stage. If we assume that Av3 ∼= 1 for the
emitter-follower output stage, then the overall gain of the CA3140 op-amp is
Av = Ad Av2Av3 = (12.7)(1923)(1) = 24,422
(13.60)
Typical values of the gain of the CA3140 op-amp are in the area of 100,000;
thus, our calculations give a somewhat smaller value.
Frequency Response
The CA3140 op-amp is internally compensated by the Miller compensation tech-
nique to introduce a dominant pole, as was done in the 741 op-amp. The feedback
capacitor C1 is 12 pF and is connected between the collector and the base of Q13, as
shown in Figure 13.20. From Miller’s theorem, the effective input capacitance of the
second stage is
Ci = C1(1 + |Av2|)
(13.61)
The low-frequency dominant pole is
fP D =
1
2π ReqCi
(13.62)
where Req is the equivalent resistance between the second-stage input node and
ground. Since this resistance is dominated by the input resistance to Q13, we have
Req ∼= Ri2 = rπ13
(13.63)
EXAMPLE 13.15
Objective: Determine the dominant-pole frequency and unity-gain bandwidth of the
CA3140 op-amp.
Again, we will use results from previous calculations.
Solution: Previously, we determined that |Av2| = 1923; therefore, the effective
input capacitance is
Ci = C1(1 + |Av2|) = 12(1 + 1923) = 23,088 pF
The gain stage input resistance is
Ri2 = rπ13 = 26 k
which means that
fP D ∼=
1
2π Ri2Ci
=
1
2π(26 × 103)(23,088 × 10−12) = 265 Hz
Finally, the unity-gain bandwidth is
fT = fP D Av = (265)(24,422) ⇒6.47 MHz
Comment: This unity-gain bandwidth value compares favorably with typical values
of 4.5 MHz listed in the data sheet.

JFET OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
Objective: • Describe the characteristics of two hybrid JFET opera-
tional ampliﬁer circuits.
The advantage of using MOSFETs as input devices in a BiCMOS op-amp is that ex-
tremely small input bias currents can be achieved. However, MOSFET gates con-
nected to outside terminals of an IC must be protected against electrostatic damage.
Typically, this is accomplished by using back-biased diodes on the input, as was
shown in Figure 13.21. Unfortunately, the input op-amp bias currents are then dom-
inated by the leakage currents in the protection diodes, which means that the small
input bias currents cannot be fully realized. JFETs as input devices also offer the ad-
vantage of low input currents, and they do not need electrostatic protection devices.
Input gate currents in a JFET are usually well below 1 nA, and are often on the order
of 10 pA. In addition, JFETs offer greatly reduced noise properties.
In this section, we will examine two op-amp conﬁgurations using JFETs as input
devices. Since the analysis is essentially identical to that given in the last two sec-
tions, we will limit ourselves to a general discussion of the circuit characteristics.
Hybrid FET Op-Amp, LH002/42/52 Series
Figure 13.24 is a simpliﬁed circuit diagram of an LH002/42/52 series op-amp, which
uses a pair of JFETs for the input differential pair. Note that the general layout of the
circuit is essentially the same as that of the 741 op-amp.
The input diff-amp stage consists of transistors J1, J2, Q3, and Q4; J1 and J2 are
n-channel JFETs operating in a source-follower conﬁguration. The differential output
13.5.1
Chapter 13 Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
989

signal from J1 and J2 is the input to the common-base ampliﬁer formed by Q3 and Q4,
which provides a large voltage gain. Transistors Q5, Q6, and Q7 form the active load
for the input stage.
The gain stage is composed of Q16 and Q17 connected in a Darlington pair
conﬁguration. This stage also includes a 30 pF compensation capacitor. The output
stage consists of the complementary push–pull emitter-follower conﬁguration of Q14
and Q20. Transistors Q14 and Q20 are biased slightly “on” by diodes Q10 and Q19, to
minimize crossover distortion. Transistors Q15 and Q21 and the associated 27  and
22  resistors provide the short-circuit protection.
An abbreviated data sheet for an LH0042C op-amp is shown in Table 13.3. Note
the very large differential-mode input resistance and the low input bias current.

Hybrid FET Op-Amp, LF155 Series
Another example of a JFET op-amp is the LF155 BiFET op-amp. A simpliﬁed circuit
diagram showing the input stage is in Figure 13.25. The input BiFET op-amp stage
13.5.2

consists of p-channel JFETs J1 and J2 biased by the bipolar transistor Q1. The active
load for the input diff-amp consists of the p-channel JFETs J3 and J4, for which
VGS = 0.
A two-sided output from the input diff-amp stage is connected to a second diff-
amp stage consisting of Darlington pairs Q7 through Q10. The second, or gain, stage
is biased by bipolar transistor Q5. The cascode conﬁguration of J5 and Q2 form the
active load for the gain stage.
The circuit has a common-mode feedback loop in the bias circuit. The base of Q6
is connected to the collector of Q5. If the drain voltages of J1 and J2 increase, the
Darlington second stage drives the base voltage of Q6 higher. The current in Q6 then
increases, reducing the drain currents in J1 and J2, since IC1 is a constant current.
Smaller drain currents cause the voltages at the J1 and J2 drains to decrease, which
then stabilizes the drain voltages.
JFET J6 is connected as a current source, which establishes a reference current in
Q3, Q4, and J6. This reference current then produces the bias currents in the current
mirrors Q4–Q5 and Q1–Q2–Q3.
In this BiFET op-amp, we see the advantages of incorporating both JFET and
bipolars in the same circuit. The JFET input devices provide a very high input im-
pedance, normally in the range of 1012 . The current-connected transistor J6 allows
the reference bias current to be controlled without the use of a resistor. Incorporating
bipolar transistors in the second stage takes advantage of their higher transconduc-
tance values compared to JFETs, to produce a high second-stage gain.

DESIGN APPLICATION: A TWO-STAGE CMOS
OP-AMP TO MATCH A GIVEN OUTPUT STAGE
Objective: • Design a two-stage CMOS op-amp that will match
the output stage in Figure 8.38 that was the design application in
Chapter 8.
Speciﬁcations: A two-stage CMOS op-amp is to match the output stage designed
and shown in Figure 8.38. The small-signal differential-voltage gain of the diff-amp
stage is to be 300, and the bias currents are to be IQ = 200 μA and IREF = 400 μA.
The dc voltage at the output of the second stage is to be −2.295 V, in order to match
the output stage in Figure 8.38.
Design Approach: The diff-amp circuit to be designed has the conﬁguration shown
in Figure 13.26. The input devices are PMOS and the active load contains NMOS de-
vices so that the dc value of output voltage will be negative.

If we assume the minimum width-to-length ratio of a MOSFET is unity, then
we can show that six transistors are required in place of M9. The total voltage drop
across the six transistors is 30 −1.47 = 28.53 V. The voltage drop across each
transistor is then VSG9 = 28.53/6 V. The width-to-length ratios are then found

which yields (W/L)9 = 1.42 for each of the six transistors.
Solution (Second Stage—DC Design): The transistor M5 must match M7, so
(W/L)5 = 45. Since the current in M6 is twice as large as in M3, then the width-to-
length of M6 must be twice that of M3 and M4, or (W/L)6 = 90.
The resistors R1 and R2 are used to produce the required dc output voltage. Since
λn = λp, then VSD5 = VDS6. If we choose VSD5 = VDS6 = 3 V, then V1 + V2 =
24 V. In order for vO = −2.295 V, then V1 = 14.3 V and V2 = 9.7 V. The re-

Comment: Achieving the required dc output voltage of −2.295 V will be difﬁcult
because of device and circuit element tolerances. A circuit similar to the one to be
discussed in the design application of Chapter 14 would be required to provide for
offset voltage compensation.

SUMMARY
•
, we combined various basic circuit conﬁgurations to form
larger operational ampliﬁer circuits. In general, an op-amp circuit consists of
a diff-amp input stage, a second gain stage, and an output stage. The design of
integrated circuit operational ampliﬁer circuits depends on the use of matched
devices.
•
The LM741 op-amp is a widely used, general-purpose, bipolar op-amp. This
circuit serves as a good case study for a detailed discussion of the circuit
design, including a discussion of the input stage design, the Darlington pair
gain stage, and a class-AB complementary output stage with the protection
circuitry.
•
A detailed dc analysis of each stage of the 741 was performed to determine the
dc currents and voltages. A detailed small-signal analysis determined the gain of
each stage and the overall small-signal voltage gain. The calculated results agree
well with the typical values given in data sheets.
•
In many cases, all-CMOS operational ampliﬁer circuits require only two stages.
These circuits typically drive only low capacitive loads on an IC chip, so the low

In this chapter

output impedance of a third stage is not required. The voltage gain of CMOS
ampliﬁers is generally smaller than that of typical bipolar op-amps, but CMOS
op-amps are useful in specialized on-chip applications.
•
An all-CMOS folded cascode operational ampliﬁer was found to have a very
high differential-mode voltage gain. An all-CMOS current-mirror operational
ampliﬁer was found to have an increased gain–bandwidth product.
•
The bias current in a BiCMOS op-amp was found to be independent of bias volt-
age over a wide range of applied bias voltages.
•
As an application, a two-stage CMOS op-amp was designed to match a given
output stage.

Nonideal Effects in

1009
Chapter 9 introduced the ideal operational ampliﬁer and covered a few of its many
applications. In the previous chapter, we analyzed actual operational ampliﬁer cir-
cuits, including the classic 741 op-amp. From these discussions, we can identify
sources of nonideal properties in actual op-amps. In particular, we consider the
effects of a ﬁnite open-loop gain, reconsider the frequency response, consider the source
and effects of offset voltage, and consider the source and effects of input bias currents.
Although nonideal effects could have been introduced in Chapter 9, that discus-
sion would have been less meaningful since the source of any nonideal effect would
not have been completely understood at that time. In particular, the reason for a very
low dominant-pole frequency in the basic ampliﬁer would have been a mystery.
Therefore, the discussion of nonideal effects in op-amp circuits has been postponed
until now.

PRACTICAL OP-AMP PARAMETERS
Objective: • Deﬁne and discuss various practical op-amp parameters.
In ideal op-amps, we assume, for example, that the differential voltage gain is inﬁnite,
the input resistance is inﬁnite, and the output resistance is zero. In practical op-amp
circuits, these ideal parameter values are not realized. In this section, we deﬁne some of
the practical op-amp parameters that will be considered in detail throughout the chapter.
We will discuss and analyze the effect of these nonideal parameters in op-amp circuits.
Practical Op-Amp Parameter Deﬁnitions
Input voltage limits. Two input voltage limitations must be considered—a dc input
voltage limit and a differential signal input voltage. All transistors in the input diff-amp
stage must be properly biased, so there is a limit in the range of common-mode input
voltage that can be applied and still maintain the proper transistor biasing. The maxi-
mum differential input signal voltage that can be applied and still maintain linear cir-
cuit operation is limited primarily by the maximum allowed output signal voltage.
Output voltage limits. The output voltage of the op-amp can never exceed the
limits of the dc supply voltages. In practice, the difference between the bias voltage
and the maximum output voltage depends on the design of the output stage. In older
designs, this difference was on the order of 1 to 2 volts. In newer designs, this differ-
ence can be on the order of millivolts. If Vout = Av · Vin (where Av is the overall volt-
age gain) is greater than the bias voltage, then the output voltage would saturate and
would no longer be a linear function of the input voltage.
Output current limitation. The maximum current out of or into the op-amp is
determined by the current ratings of the output transistors. Practical op-amp circuits
cannot source or sink an inﬁnite amount of current.
Finite open-loop voltage gain. The open-loop gain of the ideal op-amp is as-
sumed to be inﬁnite. In practice, the open-loop gain of any op-amp circuit is always
ﬁnite. This nonideal parameter value will affect circuit performance.
Input resistance. The input resistance Ri is the small-signal resistance between
the inverting and noninverting terminals when a differential voltage is applied. Ide-
ally, this parameter is inﬁnite, but, especially for BJT circuits, this parameter is ﬁnite.
Output resistance. The output resistance is the Thevenin equivalent small-signal
resistance looking back into the output terminal of the op-amp measured with respect
to ground. The ideal output resistance is zero, which means there is no loading effect
at the output. In practice, this value is not zero.
Finite bandwidth. In the ideal op-amp, the bandwidth is inﬁnite. In practical
op-amps, the bandwidth is ﬁnite because of capacitances within the op-amp circuit.
Slew rate. The slew rate is deﬁned as the maximum rate of change in output volt-
age per unit of time. The maximum rate at which the output voltage can change is
also a function of capacitances within the op-amp circuit.
Input offset voltage. In an ideal op-amp, the output voltage is zero for zero dif-
ferential input signal voltage. However, mismatches between input devices, for
example, may create an output voltage with zero input. The input offset voltage is the
applied differential input voltage required to induce a zero output voltage.
14.1.1

Input bias currents. In an ideal op-amp, the input current to the op-amp circuit
is assumed to be zero. However, in practical op-amps, especially with BJT input
devices, the input bias currents are not zero.
The cause of these nonideal op-amp parameters will be discussed in the follow-
ing sections, as well as the effect these nonideal parameters have on op-amp circuit
performance. A few other nonideal parameters will be considered in the last section
of the chapter.
Table 14.1 lists a few of the nonideal parameter values for three of the op-amps
considered in the previous chapter. We will refer to this table as we discuss each of
the nonideal parameters.
Input and Output Voltage Limitations
For linear circuit operation, all BJTs in an op-amp circuit must be biased in the
forward-active region and all MOSFETs must be biased in the saturation region. For
these reasons, there are limitations to the range of input and output voltages in
op-amp circuits.
Figure l4.1(a) shows the simple all-BJT op-amp circuit discussed at the begin-
ning of Chapter 13 and Figure 14.1(b) shows the all-CMOS folded cascode op-amp
circuit discussed in the last chapter. We will use these two circuits to discuss the input
and output voltage limitations.
Input Voltage Limitations
Assume that in the BJT circuit of Figure 14.1(a) we apply a common-mode input
voltage such that vcm = v1 = v2. As vcm increases, the base–collector voltages of Q1
and Q2 decrease, since the collector voltages are ﬁxed at two base–emitter voltage
drops below V +. If we assume the minimum base–collector voltage is zero so that
the transistor is still biased in the active mode, then the maximum value of vcm is
vcm(max) = V + −2VE B(on).
As vcm decreases, the collector–emitter voltage of Q3 decreases. If we again as-
sume the minimum base–collector voltage is zero, or the minimum collector–emitter
voltage is VBE(on), then, taking into account the base–emitter voltage of the input
transistors, the minimum value of vcm is vcm(min) = V −+ 2VBE(on). So the maxi-
mum range of vcm is within approximately 1.4 V of each bias voltage.

circuit

The same range of common-mode input voltage can be found for the all-MOSFET
diff-amp in Figure 14.1(b). In this case, all MOSFETs must be biased in the satura-
tion region. We can again deﬁne the common-mode input voltage as vcm = v1 = v2.
Now, as vcm increases, VSD of M11 decreases. The minimum value of VSD is
VSD11(sat) = VSG11 + VT P11. The maximum value of vcm is then vcm(max) =
V + −[VSG1 + (VSG11 + VT P11)]. The gate-to-source voltages can be determined
from the transistor parameters and currents.
As vcm decreases, the source-to-drain voltage of the input transistors decreases.
Assuming that M3 and M4 are matched to M13, then the drain-to-source voltage of
these transistors is equal to VGS13. The minimum common-mode input voltage is
then vcm(min) = V −+ [VGS11 + (VSG1 + VT P1) −VSG1]. The VSG1 terms cancel,
so vcm(min) = V −+ [VGS11 + VT P1].
Output Voltage Limitations
As the output voltage of the BJT circuit in Figure 14.1(a) increases or decreases, the
collector–emitter voltages of the output transistors change. Again, assuming the min-
imum base–collector voltage is zero for a BJT biased in the forward active region,
then the maximum output voltage is vO(max) = V + −[VE B8(on) + VBE11(on)].
The minimum output voltage is similarly found to be vO(min) = V −+ [VBE4(on) +
VE B12(on)].
For the all-CMOS circuit in Figure 14.1(b), the maximum output voltage
is vO(max) = V + −[(VSG8 + VT P8) + VSG10]. The minimum output voltage is
vO(min) = V −+ [(VGS6 −VT N6) + VGS13].

14.2
FINITE OPEN-LOOP GAIN
Objective: • Analyze the effect of ﬁnite open-loop gain.
In the ideal op-amp, the open-loop gain is inﬁnite, the input differential resistance is
inﬁnite, and the output resistance is zero. None of these conditions exists in actual
operational ampliﬁers. In the last chapter, we determined that the open-loop gain and
input differential resistance may be large but ﬁnite, and the output resistance may be
small but nonzero. In this section, we will determine the effect of a ﬁnite open-loop
gain and input resistance on both the inverting and noninverting ampliﬁer character-
istics. We will then calculate the output resistance.
In this section, we limit our discussion of the ﬁnite open-loop gain to low fre-
quency. In the next section, we consider the effect of ﬁnite gain as well as the
frequency response of the ampliﬁer.

EXAMPLE 14.1
Objective: Determine the minimum open-loop voltage gain to achieve a particular
accuracy.
A pressure transducer produces a maximum dc voltage signal of 2 mV and has
an output resistance of RS = 2 k. The maximum dc current from the transducer is
to be limited to 0.2 μA. An inverting ampliﬁer is to be used in conjunction with the
transducer to produce an output voltage of −0.10 V for a 2 mV transducer signal.
The error in the output voltage cannot be greater than 0.1 percent. Determine the
minimum open-loop gain of the ampliﬁer to meet this speciﬁcation.

Solution: We must ﬁrst determine the resistor values to be used in the inverting am-
pliﬁer. The source resistor is in series with R1, so let
R′
1 = R1 + RS
The minimum input resistance is found from the maximum input current as
R′
1(min) =
vi
ii(max) = 2 × 10−3
0.2 × 10−6 = 10 × 103  = 10 k

ACL = vO
vi
=
−0.10
2 × 10−3 = −50 = −RF
R′
1
The required value of the feedback resistor is then RF = 500 k.
For the voltage gain to be within 0.1 percent, the minimum gain (magnitude) is
49.95. Using Equation (14.4), we can determine the minimum value of the open-loop
gain. We have

which yields AOL(min) = 50,949.
Comment: If the open-loop gain is greater than the value of AOL(min) = 50,949,
then the error in the voltage gain will be less than 0.1 percent.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.1: Consider an inverting ampliﬁer in which the op-amp open-loop gain is
AOL = 2 × 105 and the ideal closed-loop ampliﬁer gain is ACL (∞) = −40.
(a) Determine the actual closed-loop gain. (b) Repeat part (a) if the open-loop gain is
AOL = 5 × 104. (c) What is the percent change between the magnitudes of the actual
gains from part (a) to part (b)? (Ans. (a) −39.9918, (b) −39.9672, (c) −0.0615%)
In the limit as AOL →∞, the closed-loop gain is equal to the ideal value,
designated ACL(∞), which for the inverting ampliﬁer is
ACL(∞) = −R2
R1
(14.5)
as previously determined. Equation (14.4) is then
ACL =
ACL(∞)
1 + 1 −ACL(∞)
AOL
(14.6)
To determine the variation in closed-loop gain with changes in open-loop gain,
we take the derivative of ACL with respect to AOL. We ﬁnd

= ACL(∞)(1 −ACL(∞))
[AOL + (1 −ACL(∞))]2

(14.9)
Equation (14.9) relates the percent change in the closed-loop gain of the invert-
ing ampliﬁer as the result of a change in open-loop gain. Open-loop gain variations
occur when individual transistor parameters change from one circuit to another or
with temperature.
From Equation (14.9), we see that changes in closed-loop gain become smaller
as the open-loop gain becomes larger.
Noninverting Ampliﬁer Closed-Loop Gain
Figure 14.3 shows the equivalent circuit of the noninverting ampliﬁer with a ﬁnite
open-loop gain. Again, the open-loop input differential resistance is assumed to be
inﬁnite. The analysis proceeds in much the same way as in the previous section.

Equation (14.16) yields the fractional change in the closed-loop gain of the non-
inverting ampliﬁer as a result of a change in the open-loop gain. The result for the
noninverting ampliﬁer is very similar to that for the inverting ampliﬁer.
Inverting Ampliﬁer Closed-Loop Input Resistance
The closed-loop input resistance Ri f of the inverting ampliﬁer is deﬁned in Fig-
ure 14.4(a), and it includes the effect of feedback. The equivalent circuit, including a
ﬁnite open-loop gain AOL, ﬁnite open-loop input differential resistance Ri, and
nonzero output resistance Ro, is shown in Figure 14.4(b).

ampliﬁer, with a ﬁnite open-loop gain, ﬁnite open-loop input resistance, and nonzero
output resistance. In the limit as AOL →∞, we see that 1/Ri f →∞, or Ri f →0,
which means that v1 →0, or v1 is at virtual ground. This is a characteristic of an
ideal inverting op-amp.
EXAMPLE 14.2
Objective: Determine the closed-loop input resistance at the inverting terminal of an
inverting ampliﬁer.
Consider an inverting ampliﬁer with a feedback resistor R2 = 10 k, and an op-
amp with parameters AOL = 105 and Ri = 10 k. Assume the output resistance Ro
of the op-amp is negligible.
Solution: If Ro = 0, then Equation (14.20) becomes

(14.21)
The closed-loop input resistance is then Ri f ∼= 0.1 .
Comment: The closed-loop input resistance of the inverting ampliﬁer is a very
strong function of the ﬁnite open-loop gain. Equation (14.21) shows that the open-
loop input resistance Ri essentially does not affect the closed-loop input resistance.

A nonzero closed-loop input resistance Ri f in conjunction with a ﬁnite open-
loop input resistance Ri implies that the signal current into the op-amp is not zero, as
assumed in the ideal case. From Figure 14.4(b), we see that

that Ri f →∞, which is a property of the ideal noninverting ampliﬁer.

tance of Ri = 10 k in a noninverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration with resistor values of

Comment: As expected, the closed-loop input resistance of the noninverting ampli-
ﬁer is very large. Equation (14.32) shows that the input resistance is dominated by
the term Ri(1 + AOL). The combination of a large Ri and large AOL produces an
extremely large input resistance, as predicted by ideal feedback theory.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.3: For a noninverting ampliﬁer, the resistances are R2 = 99 k and
R1 = 1 k. The op-amp properties are: AOL = 104, Ri = 40 k, and Ro = 0.
Determine the closed-loop input resistance. (Ans. Ri f = 4.04 M)
Nonzero Output Resistance
Since the ideal op-amp has a zero output resistance, the output voltage is independent
of the load impedance. The op-amp acts as an ideal voltage source and there is no
loading effect. An actual op-amp circuit has a nonzero output resistance, which
means that the output voltage, and therefore the closed-loop gain, is a function of the
load impedance.
Figure 14.6 is the equivalent circuit of both an inverting and noninverting am-
pliﬁer and is used to ﬁnd the output resistance. The op-amp has a ﬁnite open-loop
gain AOL, a nonzero output resistance Ro, and an inﬁnite input resistance Ri. To de-
termine the output resistance, we set the independent input voltages equal to zero. A

In most op-amp circuits, the open-loop output resistance Ro is on the order of
100 . Since AOL is normally much larger than (1 + R2/R1), the closed-loop output
resistance can be very small. Output resistance values in the milliohm range are
easily attained.
EXAMPLE 14.4
Objective: Determine the output resistance of an op-amp circuit.
Computer Simulation Solution: Figure 14.7 shows an inverting ampliﬁer circuit
with a standard 741 op-amp. One method of determining the output resistance is to
measure the output voltage for two different values of load resistance connected to
the output. Then, treating the ampliﬁer as a Thevenin equivalent circuit with a ﬁxed
source in series with an output resistance, the output resistance can be determined.
A 1 mV signal was applied. For a 10  load, the output voltage is 0.999837 mV, and
for a 20  load, the output voltage is 0.9999132 mV. This gives an output resistance
of 1.53 m.
Comment: As mentioned, the output resistance of a voltage ampliﬁer with negative
feedback can be very small. The ideal output resistance is zero, but a practical
op-amp circuit can have an output resistance in the milliohm range.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Objective: • Analyze the open-loop and closed-loop frequency
response.
In the previous chapter, we considered the basic op-amp frequency response. Fre-
quency compensation was included as a means of stabilizing the circuit. In this section,
we will consider the bandwidth and the transient response of the closed-loop ampliﬁer.
When a step function is applied at the op-amp input, the output voltage cannot
change instantaneously with time because of capacitance effects within the op-amp
circuit. The maximum rate at which the output changes with time is called the slew
rate. We will determine the factors that limit the slew rate.
Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Frequency Response
The frequency response of the open-loop gain can be written as
AOL( f ) =
AO
1 + j
f
fP D
(14.37)
14.3.1
Chapter 14 Nonideal Effects in Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
1023

where AO is the low-frequency open-loop gain and fP D is the dominant-pole
frequency. Figure 14.8 shows the Bode plot of the open-loop gain magnitude. The
dominant-pole frequency fP D is shown as well as the unity-gain bandwidth fT .
We showed previously that the unity-gain bandwidth is
fT = fP D AO
(14.38)
and is also called the gain–bandwidth product. Equation (14.38) assumes that addi-
tional poles of the open-loop frequency response occur at higher frequencies than fT .
Figure 14.9 shows a noninverting ampliﬁer. In our discussion on feedback
theory in Chapter 12, we found that, assuming ideal feedback, the closed-loop gain
ACL can be written
ACL =
AOL
(1 + β AOL)
(14.39)
where β is the feedback transfer function. For the noninverting ampliﬁer, this feed-
back transfer function is
β =
1
1 + R2
R1
(14.40)
Combining Equations (14.37), (14.40) and (14.39), we ﬁnd the expression for
the closed-loop gain as a function of frequency, as follows:
ACL( f ) =

Since in most cases AO ≫ACLO, the bandwidth of the closed-loop system is

Equation (14.44) applies to the inverting, as well as the noninverting, ampliﬁer in
which ACLO is the magnitude of the closed-loop gain. We have seen this same band-
width extension for negative feedback several times previously.

EXAMPLE 14.5
Objective: Determine the unity-gain bandwidth and the maximum closed-loop gain
for a speciﬁed closed-loop bandwidth.
An audio ampliﬁer system is to use an op-amp with an open-loop gain of AO =
2 × 105 and a dominant-pole frequency of 5 Hz. The bandwidth of the audio system
is to be 20 kHz. Determine the maximum closed-loop gain for the audio ampliﬁer.
Solution: The unity-gain bandwidth is found as
fT = fP D AO = (5)(2 × 105) = 106 Hz ⇒1 MHz
Since the gain–bandwidth product is a constant, we have
f3-dB · ACL = fT
where f3-dB is the closed-loop bandwidth and ACL is the closed-loop gain. The max-
imum closed-loop gain is then
ACL =
fT
f3-dB
=

20 × 103 = 50
Comment: If the closed-loop gain is less than or equal to 50, then the required band-
width of 20 kHz for the audio ampliﬁer will be realized.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.5: An op-amp with open-loop parameters of AOL = 2 × 105
and
fP D = 5 Hz is connected in a noninverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration with a low-
frequency closed-loop gain of ACLO = 30. An input voltage signal of
vI = 100 sin (2π ft) μV is applied. (a) What is the closed-loop bandwidth?
(b) What is the low-frequency output voltage? (c) Determine the peak amplitude of
the output voltage if the frequency of the signal is (i) f = 5 kHz, (ii) f = 50 kHz,
and (iii) f = 200 kHz. (Ans. (a) f3-dB = 33.3 kHz; (b) vO = 3 sin (2π ft) mV;
(c) (i) ∼= 3 mV, (ii) 1.663 mV, (iii) 0.493 mV)
Slew Rate
Implicit in the frequency response analysis for the closed-loop ampliﬁer is the
assumption that the sinusoidal input signals are small. If a large sinusoidal signal or
step function is applied to an op-amp circuit, the input stage can be overdriven and
the small-signal model will no longer apply.
Figure 14.11 shows a simpliﬁed op-amp circuit. If a large step voltage (greater
than 120 mV) is applied at v2 with v1 held at ground potential, then Q2 is effectively
cut off, which means iC2 ∼= 0 and iC1 ∼= IQ. The entire bias current is switched to Q1.
Since iC3 ∼= iC1, then iC3 ∼= IQ; since Q3–Q4 form a current mirror, then we also
have iC4 ∼= IQ.
The base current into Q5 is very small; therefore, the current through the compen-
sation capacitor C1 is iO = iC4 = IQ. Since the voltage gain of the emitter-follower
output stage is essentially unity, the capacitor current can be written as
iO = C1
d(vO −vO1)
dt
(14.47)
14.3.3
1026
Part 2

The gain of the second stage is large, which means that vO1 ≪vO. Equa-
tion (14.47) then becomes
iO ∼= C1
dvO

(14.48)
or
dvO

(14.49)
The maximum current through the compensation capacitor is limited to the bias cur-
rent IQ; consequently, the maximum rate at which the output voltage can change is
also limited by the bias current IQ.
The maximum rate of change of the output voltage is the slew rate of the
op-amp, the units of which are usually given as volts per microsecond. From Equa-
tion (14.49), we have
Slew rate (SR) =
dvO


max

C1
(14.50)
Although the rate of change in output voltage can be either positive or negative, the
slew rate is deﬁned as a positive quantity.
Figure 14.12 shows the slew-rate limited response of an op-amp voltage follower
to a rectangular input voltage pulse. Note the trapezoidal shaped output response. The
time needed to reach the full-scale response is approximately VO(max)/SR.
EXAMPLE 14.6
Objective: Calculate the slew rate of the 741 op-amp.
From the previous chapter, the bias current in the 741 op-amp is IQ = 19 μA
and the internal frequency compensation capacitor is C1 = 30 pF.
Solution: From Equation (14.50), the slew rate is
SR = IQ
C1
= 19 × 10−6
30 × 10−12 = 0.63 × 106 V/s ⇒0.63 V/μs
Comment: The partial data sheet in Table 14.1 for the 741 op-amp lists the typical
slew rate as 0.7 V/μs, which is in close agreement with our calculated value.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.6: A 0.5 V input step function is applied at t = 0 to a noninverting ampli-
ﬁer with a closed-loop gain of 8. The slew rate of the op-amp is 1.25 V/μs.
Determine the output voltage at (a) (i) t = 2 μs, (ii) t = 4 μs, and (iii) t = 6 μs.
(b) At what time does the output reach its full scale response? (Ans. (a) (i) 2.5 V,
(ii) 4 V, (iii) 4 V; (b) 3.2 μs)
Typical slew-rate values for the CA3140 BiCMOS and LH0042C BiFET
op-amps are also given in Table 14.1. The BiCMOS circuit has a typical slew rate of
9 V/μs, and the BiFET op-amp has a typical value of 3 V/μs. The slew rates are
larger in the FET op-amps because the bias currents are larger than in the 741 circuit
and the gain of the FET input stage is smaller than that of the 741 input stage.
The slew rate is directly related to the unity-gain bandwidth. To explain, the
unity-gain bandwidth is directly proportional to the dominant-pole frequency, or
fT ∝fP D. In turn, the dominant-pole frequency is inversely proportional to ReqC1,
where Req is the equivalent resistance at the node of the second stage input and C1 is
the compensation capacitance. The equivalent resistance Req is a function of the sec-
ond stage input resistance and the diff-amp stage output resistance, both of which are
inversely proportional to IQ. Then,
fT ∝fP D ∝

(14.51)
where IQ/C1is the slew rate. Equation (14.51) shows that the slew rate is directly
proportional to the unity-gain bandwidth.
Now consider what happens when a sinosoidal input signal is applied, for ex-
ample, to the noninverting ampliﬁer shown in Figure 14.9. If vI = Vp sin ωt, then
vO(t) = VP


sin ωt = Vpo sin ωt
(14.52)
where Vpo is the ideal peak value of the sinusoidal output voltage.
The rate at which the output voltage changes is

= ωVpo cos ωt
(14.53)
Therefore, the maximum rate of change is ωVpo. Figure 14.13 shows two sinusoidal
waveforms of the same frequency but different peak amplitudes. The maximum rate of

Figure 14.13 Two sinusoidal waveforms of the same frequency with different peak voltages,

change, or slope, occurs as the curves cross the zero axis. The waveform with the larger
peak value has a larger maximum slope. Curve a in Figure 14.13 has a maximum slope
corresponding to the slew rate; curve b, with a smaller peak value, has a maximum
slope less than the slew rate. If the maximum slope, ωVpo, is greater than the slew rate
SR, then the op-amp is slew-rate-limited and the output signal is distorted.
Thus, the maximum frequency at which the op-amp can operate without being
slew-rate-limited is a function of both the frequency and peak amplitude of the signal.
We have that
ωmaxVpo = 2π fmaxVpo = SR
(14.54(a))
or
fmax =
SR
2πVpo
(14.54(b))
As the output voltage peak amplitude increases, the maximum frequency at which
slew-rate-limiting occurs decreases. The full-power bandwidth (FPBW) is the fre-
quency at which the op-amp output becomes slew-rate-limited. The FPBW is the
fmax frequency from Equation (l4.54(b)), or
FPBW =
SR
2πVpo
(14.55)
The full-power bandwidth can be considerably less than the small-signal bandwidth.
EXAMPLE 14.7
Objective: Determine the small-signal bandwidth of an ampliﬁer and the full-power
bandwidth that will produce an undistorted output voltage.
Consider an ampliﬁer with a unity-gain bandwidth of fT = 1 MHz and a low-
frequency closed-loop gain of ACLO = 10. Assume the op-amp slew rate is
SR = 1 V/μs and the desired peak output voltage is Vpo = 10 V.
Solution: The small-signal closed-loop bandwidth is, from Equation (14.44),
f3-dB =
fT
ACLO
= 106

The full-power bandwidth, based on slew-rate limitation, from Equations (14.54(b))
and (14.55), is
fmax = FPBW =
SR
2πVpo
= (1 V/μs)(106μs/s)
2π(10)
⇒15.9 kHz
Comment: The full-power bandwidth, or the actual maximum frequency at which
the system can be operated and still produce a large, undistorted output signal, is
considerably smaller than the bandwidth under small-signal nonslew-rate-limiting
conditions.

bandwidth for a peak undistorted output voltage of (a) 0.25 V, (b) 2 V, and (c) 8 V.

OFFSET VOLTAGE
Objective: • Deﬁne and analyze sources and effects of offset voltage.
In Chapter 11, we analyzed the basic difference ampliﬁer, which is the input stage of the
op-amp. In that analysis, we assumed the input differential-pair transistors to be identi-
cal, or matched. If the two input devices are mismatched, the currents in the two branches
of the diff-amp are unequal and this affects the diff-amp dc output voltage. In fact, the
internal circuitry of the entire op-amp usually contains imbalances and asymmetries, all
of which can cause a nonzero output voltage for a zero input differential voltage.
The output dc offset voltage is the measured open-loop output voltage when
the input voltage is zero. This conﬁguration is shown in Figure 14.14. The input dc
offset voltage is deﬁned as the input differential voltage that must be applied to the
open-loop op-amp to produce a zero output voltage. This conﬁguration is shown in
Figure 14.15. The input offset voltage is the parameter most often speciﬁed and is
usually referred to simply as the offset voltage.
Offset voltage values have a statistical distribution among op-amps of the same
type, and the offset voltage polarity may vary from one op-amp to another. The offset
voltage speciﬁcation for an op-amp is the magnitude of the maximum offset voltage
for a particular type of op-amp. The offset voltage is a dc value, generally in the range
of 1 to 2 mV for bipolar op-amps, although some op-amps may have offset voltages
in the range of 5 to 10 mV. Further, the maximum offset voltage speciﬁcation for a
precision op-amp may be as low as 10 μV.
In this section we will analyze offset voltage effects in the input diff-amp stage
and will then consider various techniques used to compensate for offset voltage.
Input Stage Offset Voltage Effects
Several possible mismatches in the input diff-amp stage can produce offset voltages.
We will analyze offset voltage effects in two bipolar input stages and in a MOSFET
input diff-amp circuit.
Basic Bipolar Diff-Amp Stage
A basic bipolar diff-amp is shown in Figure 14.16. The differential pair is biased with
a constant-current source. If Q1 and Q2 are matched, then for v1 = v2 = 0, IQ splits
evenly between the two transistors and iC1 = iC2. If a two-sided output is deﬁned as

voltage

the difference in voltage between the two collector terminals, then vO = 0 when the
transistors are matched and the collector resistors are matched, which means that
the offset voltage is zero.
The collector currents can be written as
iC1 = IS1evBE1/VT
(14.56(a))
and
iC2 = IS2evBE2/VT
(14.56(b))
where IS1 and IS2 are related to the reverse-saturation currents in the B–E junctions
and are functions of the electrical and geometric transistor properties. If the two tran-
sistors are exactly matched, then IS1 = IS2; if there is any mismatch in the electrical
or geometric parameters, then IS1 ̸= IS2.
The input offset voltage is deﬁned as the input differential voltage required to
produce a zero output voltage, or in this case to produce iC1 = iC2. Figure 14.17
shows the iC versus vBE characteristics of two unmatched transistors. Slightly dif-
ferent B–E voltages must be applied to produce equal collector currents that will
result in a zero output voltage in the diff-amp.
For iC1 = iC2, we have
IS1evBE1/VT = IS2evBE2/VT
(14.57)
or
e(vBE1−vBE2)/VT = IS2
IS1
(14.58)
We deﬁne the offset voltage as
vBE1 −vBE2 ≡VOS
Since v1 −v2 = vBE1 −vBE2, then the offset voltage VOS is the differential
input voltage that must be applied to produce iC1 = iC2.
Equation (14.58) can then be written as
eVOS/VT = IS2

Objective: Calculate the offset voltage in a bipolar diff-amp for a given mismatch

Consider the diff-amp in Figure 14.16 with transistor parameters IS1 = 10−14 A
and IS2 = 1.05 × 10−14 A.

= 0.00127 V ⇒1.27 mV
Comment: A 5 percent difference in IS for Q1 and for Q2 produces an offset volt-
age of 1.27 mV. Since the offset voltage is deﬁned as a positive quantity, if in the pre-
vious example IS1 were 5 percent larger than IS2, the offset voltage would also be
1.27 mV.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.8: Consider the bipolar diff-amp in Figure 14.16. For Q1, assume
IS1 = 2 × 10−15 A. If the offset voltage is VOS = 2 mV, what is the percent dif-
ference in the value of IS2 compared to IS1? (Ans. 8 percent)
It should be cautioned that the offset voltage in this example is one component
of the offset voltage for the entire op-amp. For example, if the two collector resistors
are not equal, then the two-sided output voltage vO will not be zero even if the two
transistors are identical. Nevertheless, the calculation provides information on one
source of offset voltage, as well as the resulting magnitude of VOS.
Bipolar Active Load Diff-Amp Stage
Figure 14.18 shows a bipolar diff-amp with a simple two-transistor active load. As
before, this input stage is biased with a constant-current source. If Q1 and Q2 are
matched and if Q3 and Q4 are matched, then IQ splits evenly between Q1 and Q2 for
v1 = v2, and the E–C voltages of Q3 and Q4 are equal. The one-sided dc output volt-
age vO will therefore be one E–B voltage below V +.
If, however, Q3 and Q4 are not exactly matched, then iC1 and iC2 may not be
equal since the active load inﬂuences the split in the bias current, even if Q1 and
Q2 are matched. This effect is caused by a ﬁnite Early voltage. Taking the Early
voltages into account, but neglecting base currents, we can write the collector
currents as
iC1 = iC3 = IS1(evBE1/VT )

If we assume that Q1 and Q2 are matched, then IS1 = IS2 ≡IS and VA1 =
VA2 ≡VAN . Assume that Q3 and Q4 are slightly mismatched, so that IS3 ̸= IS4 but
still assume that VA3 = VA4 ≡VAP. For v1 = v2, we have vBE1 = vBE2; also,
vE B3 = vE B4 = vEC3 ≡vE B. Taking the ratio of Equations (14.60(a)) and (14.60(b))
produces

Since Q3 is connected as a diode, vC E1 is a constant for a given bias current and
supply voltage, which means that the left side of Equation (14.62) is a constant. If
IS3 = IS4, then vC E2 = vC E1 and vEC4 = vE B = vEC3. However, if IS3 ̸= IS4, then the
collector–emitter voltages on Q2 and Q4 must change. If, for example, IS3 > IS4, then
vEC4 must increase and vC E2 must decrease in order to keep Equation (14.62) balanced.
If, on the other hand, IS4 > IS3, then vC E2 must increase and vEC4 must decrease. A
decrease in vEC4 means that Q4 may be driven into saturation by the mismatch.

EXAMPLE 14.9
Objective: Calculate the change in output voltage for a given mismatch in the active
load transistors.
Consider the diff-amp in Figure 14.18 with V + = 10 V. Assume that Q1 and Q2
are matched with vBE1 = vBE2 = 0.6 V, and assume that vE B3 = vE B4 = vEC3 =
0.6 V. Let IS3 = 1.05IS4. Also assume that VAN = VAP = 50 V.
Solution: Since vE B3 = 0.6 V = vBE1, then for v1 = v2 = 0,
vC E1 = V + = 10 V
The left side of Equation (14.62) is therefore
1 + vC E1

1 + vE B

We have that

or
vC E2 = 10.6 −vEC4
Equation (14.62) then becomes
1.186 = 1.05
1 + 10.6 −vEC4
50
1 + vEC4
50
which yields
vEC4 = 1.94 V
Comment: A 5 percent difference between the properties of Q3 and Q4 produces a
change from 0.6 to 1.94 V in the E–C voltage of Q4.
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: A PSpice analysis of the offset voltage effects in
the active load diff-amp was performed. The two input terminals are at ground
potential.
Using IS = 5 × 10−15 A for all transistors, the PSpice analysis shows that
vE B3 = 0.654 V rather than the assumed value of 0.6 V. Also, vEC4 is 1.19 V rather
than equal to vE B3. This occurs because the circuit is slightly unbalanced; that is, iC1
includes the base currents of Q3 andQ4, and iC4 does not. When Q3 and Q4 are not
matched and IS3 = 1.05IS4 = 5.25 × 10−15 A, then vEC4 increases to 2.51 V, com-
pared to 1.94 V from the hand analysis. If, however, IS3 = 0.95IS4 = 4.75 × 10−15 A,
then Q4 goes into saturation.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 14.9: Consider the active load bipolar diff-amp stage in Figure 14.18. Assume
the circuit and transistor parameters are as given in Example 14.9. Using Equa-
tions (14.60(a)) and (14.60(b)), determine the offset voltage VOS = |vBE2 −vBE1|
such that vEC3 = vEC4 and vC E1 = vC E2. (Ans. 1.27 mV)
1034
Part 2
Analog Electronics

An offset voltage that will slightly change iC1 and iC2 will allow the E–C volt-
age of Q4 to be adjusted back to its original value.
As shown in actual op-amp circuits, resistors are usually included in the emitters
of the active load transistors. By producing a slight imbalance in the two resistor val-
ues, we can change the ratio of iC1 to iC2, causing a change in the output voltage. This
is discussed in the next section when offset voltage null adjustment is discussed.
MOSFET Diff-Amp Stage
Figure 14.19 shows a basic MOSFET diff-amp in which the differential pair is biased
with a constant-current source. If M1 and M2 are matched, then for v1 = v2 = 0, IQ
splits evenly between the two transistors and iD1 = iD2. Since a two-sided output is
the voltage difference between the two drain terminals, then for this symmetrical
situation, vO = 0 and the offset voltage is zero.

and
iD2 = Kn2(vGS2 −VT N2)2
(14.63(b))
As previously stated, the conduction parameters Kn1 and Kn2 are functions of
the electrical and geometric properties of the two transistors, and the threshold volt-
ages VT N1 and VT N2 are also functions of the transistor electrical properties. If there
is a mismatch in electrical or geometric parameters, then we may have Kn1 ̸= Kn2
and VT N1 ̸= VT N2.
As with the bipolar diff-amp, the input offset voltage is deﬁned as the input dif-
ferential voltage that must be applied to produce a zero output voltage, or
VOS = vGS1 −vGS2
(14.64)
When the offset voltage is applied, iD1 = iD2 = IQ/2; when the two drain resistors
are equal, then vO = 0. Solving Equations (14.63(a)) and (14.63(b)) for vGS1 and
vGS2 and substituting the results into Equation (14.64), we ﬁnd

Comment: A 5 percent difference in conduction parameter values between the input
MOS transistors produces an offset voltage of 24.1 mV.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.10: Assume the MOSFET diff-amp shown in Figure 14.19 is biased with a
current IQ = 150 μA. Let VT N1 = VT N2. Assume the nominal conduction para-
meter value is Kn = 50 μA/V2. Determine the maximum variation Kn such that
the offset voltage is limited to VOS = 20 mV. (Ans. Kn = 1.63 μA/V2)
Comparing the results of Examples 14.8 and 14.10 shows that typically the
offset voltage for a MOSFET diff-amp is substantially larger than that of a bipolar
diff-amp. The difference can be explained by comparing Equation (14.71) for the
MOSFET diff-amp and Equation (14.59(b)) for the bipolar diff-amp. The offset volt-
age for the MOSFET diff-amp is directly proportional to the percent change in
conduction parameter values, whereas the offset voltage for the bipolar diff-amp is
proportional to the logarithm of the percent change in the IS current parameters. In
addition, the offset voltage for the MOSFET pair is proportional to

IQ/Kn = VGS −VT N
which is typically in the range of 0.3–2 V. In contrast, the offset voltage for the bipo-
lar pair is proportional to
VT ∼= 26 mV
which is substantially smaller than (VGS −VT N). Thus, a MOSFET diff-amp inher-
ently displays a higher input offset voltage than a bipolar pair for the same level of
mismatch.
Partial data sheets showing some of the nonideal characteristics for the op-amps
considered in the last chapter are in Table 14.1. The 741 op-amp, an all-bipolar
circuit, has a maximum input offset voltage of 3 mV. The CA3140, which has a
MOSFET input differential pair, has a maximum input offset voltage of 15 mV;
and the LH0042C, which has a JFET input differential pair, has a maximum input
offset voltage of 20 mV. This supports our conclusion that op-amps with FET input
transistors have substantially larger input offset voltages than the all-bipolar cir-
cuit discussed.
Offset Voltage Compensation
In many applications, especially those for which the input signal is large compared to
the offset voltage VOS, the effect of the offset voltage is negligible. However, there are
14.4.2
Chapter 14 Nonideal Effects in Operational Ampliﬁer Circuits
1037

situations in which it is necessary to compensate for, or “null out,” the offset voltage.
Two such methods are: (a) an externally connected offset compensation network,
and (2) an operational ampliﬁer with offset-null terminals.
External Offset Compensation Network
Figure 14.20 shows a simple network for offset voltage compensation in an inverting
ampliﬁer. The resistive voltage divider of R4 and R5, in conjunction with poten-
tiometer R3, is used to make voltage adjustments of either polarity at the noninvert-
ing terminal to cancel the effects of VOS. If R5 ≪R4, then the compensating voltage
applied to the noninverting terminal can be in the millivolt range, which is typical of
offset voltage values.

Consider the compensation network in Figure 14.20 with R5 = 100 , R4 =

Comment: For this particular circuit, the compensation voltage range is −15 mV
to +15 mV. A larger resistance R5 will increase the offset voltage compensation
range, and a smaller resistance R5 will increase the sensitivity of offset voltage
compensation.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.11: Consider the compensation network in Figure 14.20. Assume V + = 10 V,
V −= −10 V, R3 = 100 k, and R4 = 100 k. Design R5 such that the circuit
can compensate for an offset voltage of VOS = 5 mV. (Ans. 50 )
Figure 14.21 shows a compensation network that can be used with a noninverting
op-amp circuit. The same R4–R5 voltage divider is used with the potentiometer R3.
Typically, R5 is on the order of 100  and R4 on the order of 100 k. If V + = 15 V

and V −= −15 V, then the compensation voltage is again in the range of −15 mV to
+15 mV.
The voltage gain of the noninverting ampliﬁer becomes a function of the com-
pensation network. Since R5 ≪R4, then the gain of the ampliﬁer, to a good approx-
imation, is

(14.72)
Since R5 is small, Equation (14.72) shows that the gain is not a strong function of the
compensation network; however, it may still need to be taken into account.
Offset-Null Terminals
Many op-amps, including the 741 bipolar and the CA3140 BiCMOS circuits studied
in Chapter 13, include a pair of external offset-null terminals, which are used to com-
pensate for the offset voltage. Figure 14.22 shows a basic bipolar input diff-amp stage,
including a pair of offset-null terminals. An external potentiometer Rx is connected
between these terminals, and the wiper arm is connected to supply voltage V −.
If the wiper arm of Rx is centered, then R1 and R2 will each have a resistance
Rx/2 connected in parallel. When the wiper arm is moved off center, then R1 and R2
will each have a different resistance connected in parallel, and an asymmetry will be
introduced into the circuit. This asymmetry in turn introduces an offset voltage,
which cancels the input offset voltage effects. In practice, to adjust for offset voltage
effects, the op-amp is connected in a feedback conﬁguration with the input differen-
tial voltage set equal to zero. The wiper arm of potentiometer Rx is then adjusted
until the output voltage becomes zero.

mismatch and the adjustment can make iC1 = iC2. Similarly, a deliberate mismatch
between R′

Objective: Determine the required difference between R′
1 and R′
2, and the value of x
in the potentiometer to compensate for a mismatch between active load transistors
Q3 and Q4 in the diff-amp in Figure 14.22.
Assume that IQ = 200 μA, which means that we want iC1 = iC2 = 100 μA. Let
IS3 = 10−14 A and IS4 = 1.05 × 10−14 A. Also assume R1 = R2 = 1 k and
Rx = 100 k.

Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: Figure 14.23 is the circuit used in PSpice simu-
lation. The values of RX and RY were varied to simulate a change in the variable x in
the potentiometer in the circuit in Figure 14.22. The output voltage vO is taken off the
common collectors of Q1 and Q3. This voltage would correspond to the input volt-
age of a second stage.
A change in the values of RX and RY causes a slight change in the currents in the
two sides of the circuit. A change in current causes a change in the collector–emitter
voltages of Q1 and Q3, or a change in the output voltage. Figure 14.24 shows the out-
put voltage as a function of x, or as a function of the position of the potentiometer.
The results show that a change of approximately 0.7 V is possible for this range in
potentiometer setting. This change in voltage would represent a large change in input
voltage for the second stage, which in turn would cause a large change in the dc value
of the output voltage. The dc output voltage could therefore be set to zero by adjust-
ing the potentiometer setting.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 14.12: Consider the diff-amp in Figure 14.22 with a pair of offset-null ter-
minals. Let R1 = R2 = 1 k. Let Rx be a 100 k potentiometer. Assume IQ =
100 μA and IS3 = 10−14 A. If the wiper arm on the potentiometer is adjusted such
that 25 k is in parallel with R1 and 75 k is in parallel with R2, determine the

14.5
INPUT BIAS CURRENT
Objective: • Deﬁne and analyze effects of input bias currents.
The input currents to an ideal op-amp are zero. In actual operational ampliﬁers, how-
ever, the input bias currents are not zero. If the input stage consists of a pair of npn
transistors, as shown in Figure 14.25(a), the bias currents enter the input terminals.
However, if the input state consists of a pair of pnp transistors, as shown in Fig-
ure l4.25(b), the bias currents leave the input terminals.
If the input diff-amp consists of a pair of JFETs, the input bias currents are nor-
mally much smaller than those in a bipolar differential pair. A MOSFET input dif-
ferential pair, generally, must include protection devices as discussed in Chapter 13,
so the input bias currents are also not zero even in this case.
For op-amps with a bipolar input stage, the input bias currents may be as high as
10 μA and as low as a few nanoamperes. For op-amps with an FET input stage, the
bias currents may be as low as a few picoamperes. Table 14.1 lists the typical input
bias current. For the 741 op-amp it is 30 nA, and for the FET input op-amps it is in
the low picoampere range.

Bias Current Effects
Figure 14.26 schematically shows an op-amp with input bias currents. If the input
stage is symmetrical, with all corresponding elements matched, then IB1 = IB2.
However, if the input transistors are not exactly identical, then IB1 ̸= IB2. The input
bias current is then deﬁned as the average of the two input currents, or 
IB = IB1 + IB2

The algebraic sign of the offset current is usually not important, just as the offset
voltage polarity is not critical. The typical input offset current is on the order of
10 percent of the input bias current, although data sheets may list larger values. The
typical and maximum input offset currents for the three op-amps analyzed in the last
chapter are given in Table 14.1.
Figure 14.27 shows an op-amp and associated resistors for a zero input voltage.
Even if IB2 ̸= 0, the noninverting terminal is still at zero volts, or VY = 0. From the
virtual ground concept, we have VX = 0, which means that the current in R1 must be
zero. Bias current IB1 is therefore supplied by the output of the op-amp and ﬂows
through R2, producing an output voltage. If, for example, IB1 = 5 μA and R2 =
100 k, then vO = 0.5 V, which is unacceptable in most applications. Smaller input
bias currents and a smaller feedback resistor will reduce the bias current effects.
Bias Current Compensation
The effect of bias currents in op-amp circuits can be minimized with a simple com-
pensation technique. Consider the circuit in Figure 14.28. We determine vO as a
function of IB1 and IB2 using superposition. For IB2 = 0, then VY = VX = 0, and the
output voltage due to IB1 is
vO(IB1) = IB1R2
(14.78(a))
For IB1 = 0, we ﬁnd
VY = −IB2R3 = VX
Since
vO = (1 + R2/R1)VX
the output voltage due to IB2 is
vO(IB2) = −IB2R3

1 + R2

(14.78(b))

and (14.78(b)), or



(14.81)
Equation (14.81) can be rearranged as follows:
R3 =

R1 + R2

(14.82)
Equation (14.82) shows that R3 should be made equal to the parallel combination
of R1 and R2, to eliminate the effect of equal input bias currents.
If R3 = R1∥R2 and if the bias currents are not equal, then from Equation (14.79),
we have
vO = R2 (IB1 −IB2) = R2IOS
(14.83)
Since the input offset current is normally a fraction of the input bias current,
Equation (14.83) shows that the bias current effect can be reduced by making
R3 = R1∥R2.
EXAMPLE 14.13
Objective: Determine the bias current effect in an op-amp circuit, with and without
bias current compensation.
Consider the op-amp circuits in Figures 14.27 and 14.28. Let R1 = 10 k and
R2 = 100 k. Assume IB1 = 1.1 μA and IB2 = 1.0 μA.
Solution: For the op-amp circuit in Figure 14.27, the output voltage due to the bias
currents is
vO = IB1R2 = (1.1 × 10−6)(100 × 103) = 0.11 V
For the circuit in Figure 14.28, we design R3 such that
R3 = R1∥R2 = 10∥100 = 9.09 k
Then, from Equation (14.83), we ﬁnd
vO = R2(IB1 −IB2) = (100 × 103)(1.1 −1.0) × 10−6 = 0.010 V
Comment: Even if the input offset current is not zero, the effect of the input bias
currents can be reduced substantially by incorporating resistor R3.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 14.13: For the op-amp circuit shown in Figure 14.28, the parameters are
R1 = 20 k and R2 = 120 k. (a) Let IB1 = IB2 = 0.8 μA. (i) Can R3 be ad-
justed such that vO = 0? (ii) If so, what is the value of R3? (b) Repeat part (a) if
IB1 = 0.75 μA and IB2 = 0.85 μA. (Ans. (a) R3 = 17.14 k, (b) R3 = 15.13 k)
Usually the effect of bias currents in op-amp circuits is signiﬁcant only for cir-
cuits with large resistor values. For these situations, an op-amp with an FET input
stage may be necessary.

ADDITIONAL NONIDEAL EFFECTS
Objective: • Discuss and analyze additional nonideal effects.
Two additional nonideal effects in op-amps are: temperature effects and common-
mode rejection ratio. We will look at each of these in this section.
Temperature Effects
Individual transistor parameters are functions of temperature. For bipolar transistors,
the collector current is
iC = ISevBE/VT
(14.84)
where both IS and VT are functions of temperature. We expect the open-loop gain to
vary with temperature, but as we saw in Section 14.2, the fractional change in the
closed-loop gain is orders of magnitude less than the fractional change in the open-
loop gain. This then makes the closed-loop gain very insensitive to temperature
variations.
Offset Voltage Temperature Coefﬁcient
Since the electrical properties of transistors are functions of temperature, the input
offset voltage is also a function of temperature. The rate of change of offset voltage
with temperature is deﬁned as the temperature coefﬁcient of offset voltage, or
input offset voltage drift, and is given by
TCvOS = dVOS
dT
(14.85)
For a bipolar diff-amp input stage, the offset voltage, from Equation (14.59(b)), is
VOS = VT ln(IS2/IS1)
14.6.1

The temperature variations of the IS parameters cancel; therefore, the offset voltage
is directly proportional to the thermal voltage VT, which in turn is directly propor-
tional to temperature. From Equation (14.59(b)), the temperature coefﬁcient is then
TCvOS = VOS
T
(14.86)
where T is the absolute temperature. Thus, for VOS = 1 mV, the temperature coefﬁ-
cient is TCvOS = 1 mV/300 K ⇒3.3 μV/◦C. A change of 10 ◦C will therefore
result in an offset voltage change of approximately 33 μV. The temperature coefﬁ-
cients of offset voltage listed in Table 14.1 are in the range of 10 to 15 μV/°C.
Consequently, the offset voltage compensation techniques discussed previously
are completely effective at only one temperature. As the device temperature drifts in
either direction from the temperature at which the compensation network was de-
signed, the offset voltage effect is not completely compensated. However, the offset
voltage drift is substantially less than the initial offset voltage, so offset voltage com-
pensation is still desirable.
Input Offset Current Temperature Coefﬁcient
The input bias currents are functions of temperature. For example, the input bias cur-
rent of a bipolar input stage has the same functional dependence as the collector
current, as given by Equation (14.84). If the input devices are not matched, then an
input offset current IOS exists, which is also a function of temperature. The input
offset current temperature coefﬁcient is dIOS/dT. For the 741 op-amp, the maximum
value given in Table 14.1 is 0.5 nA/°C. If the input offset current becomes a problem
in a particular design, then a JFET of MOSFET input stage op-amp may be required.
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio
We considered the common-mode gain (Acm) and common-mode rejection ratio
(CMRR) of the difference ampliﬁer in Chapter 11. Since a diff-amp is the op-amp
input stage, any common-mode signal produced at the input stage will propagate
through the op-amp to the output. Therefore, the CMRR of the op-amp is essentially
the same as the CMRR of the input diff-amp.
Figure 14.30(a) shows the open-loop op-amp with a pure differential-mode input
signal. The differential-mode gain Ad is the same as the open-loop gain AOL. Figure
14.30(b) shows the open-loop op-amp with a pure common-mode input signal.

DESIGN APPLICATION: AN OFFSET VOLTAGE
COMPENSATION NETWORK
Objective: • Design an offset voltage compensation network for a
CMOS diff amp.
Speciﬁcations: An offset voltage compensation network is to be designed at the
active load of a CMOS diff-amp.
Design Approach: An offset voltage compensation network with the conﬁguration
shown in Figure 14.31 is to be designed. Assume both a 5 percent and 2 1
2 percent dif-
ference in conduction parameters between M1 and M2. This mismatch will demon-
strate how the network can compensate for an offset voltage.
Choices: For both M1 and M2, assume parameters VT N = 0.5 V, W/L = 20, and
λn = 0.02 V−1. For M1, assume k′
n1 = 80 μA/V2 and for M2, assume (i) k′
n2 =
76 μA/V2 and then (ii) k′
n2 = 78 μA/V2. A 50 k center-tapped potentiometer is
available.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, nonideal effects in op-amp circuits, such as ﬁnite open-loop gain,
offset voltage, and bias currents, were considered.
•
A ﬁnite open-loop ampliﬁer gain results in the magnitudes of the inverting am-
pliﬁer and noninverting ampliﬁer gain being smaller than the ideal values.
•
A ﬁnite open-loop ampliﬁer gain plus ﬁnite input ampliﬁer resistance and
nonzero output resistance results in nonideal op-amp input and output resistance
values.
•
The practical op-amp circuit has a ﬁnite bandwidth. With negative feedback, the
gain–bandwidth product is essentially constant, so an op-amp circuit with nega-
tive feedback has a reduced gain magnitude but an increased small-signal
bandwidth.
•
Slew rate is deﬁned as the maximum rate at which the op-amp output signal can
change per unit time. In general, the slew rate is limited by the internal fre-
quency compensation capacitor. The slew rate is also a function of the bias cur-
rent in the input diff-amp stage.
•
An input offset voltage means that the output voltage is not zero when the input
signal voltages are zero. One source of an offset voltage is a mismatch in the dif-
ferential pair transistor parameters and/or mismatches in active load transistor para-
meters. Typically, an offset voltage of a few millivolts may occur in a bipolar cir-
cuit, whereas an offset voltage of tens of millivolts may occur in a MOSFET circuit.
•
Input bias currents to an op-amp may range from a few picoamperes for FET input
transistors to as high as a few microamperes for some bipolar input transistors.
•
Techniques for offset voltage compensation and input bias current compensation
were analyzed.
•
As an application, an offset voltage compensation network was designed for a
CMOS diff-amp.

In Chapter 9, we introduced the ideal operational ampliﬁer and analyzed and designed
basic op-amp circuits. In this chapter, we consider additional applications and designs
of op-amp and comparator circuits that may be fabricated as integrated circuits.
A comparator is essentially an op-amp operated in an open-loop conﬁguration with
either a high or low saturated output signal.
Circuits to be considered include active ﬁlters, oscillators, Schmitt trigger cir-
cuits, integrated circuit power ampliﬁers, and voltage regulators.
A general goal of this chapter is to increase our skill at designing electronic
circuits to meet particular speciﬁcations and to perform particular functions.
PREVIEW
In this chapter, we will:
•
Analyze and design active ﬁlters that transmit desired frequency components
of an input signal and attenuate undesired frequency components.
•
Analyze and design oscillators that provide sinusoidal signals at speciﬁed
frequencies.
•
Analyze and design various Schmitt trigger circuits.
•
Analyze and design multivibrator circuits that provide signals with particular
waveforms.
•
Analyze and design IC power ampliﬁers that usually consist of high-gain
small-signal ampliﬁers in cascade with an output stage.
•
Analyze and design voltage regulators that establish a relatively constant dc
voltage generated from an ac signal source.
•
As an application, design an active bandpass ﬁlter to meet a set of speciﬁcations.

ACTIVE FILTERS
Objective: • Analyze and design active ﬁlters that transmit desired
frequency components of an input signal and attenuate undesired fre-
quency components.
An important application of an op-amp is the active ﬁlter. The word ﬁlter refers to
the process of removing undesired portions of the frequency spectrum. The word
active implies the use of one or more active devices, usually an operational ampliﬁer,
in the ﬁlter circuit. As an example of the application of op-amps in the area of active
ﬁlters, we will discuss the Butterworth ﬁlter. There are many types or classiﬁcations
of ﬁlters. However, the objective here is to concentrate mainly on a single type
(Butterworth) in order to demonstrate the use of op-amps in ﬁlter design. Additional
types of ﬁlters are discussed in other references.
Two advantages of active ﬁlters over passive ﬁlters are:
1.
The maximum gain or the maximum value of the transfer function may be
greater than unity.
2.
The loading effect is minimal, which means that the output response of the ﬁlter
is essentially independent of the load driven by the ﬁlter.
Active Network Design
From our discussions of frequency response in Chapter 7, we know that RC networks
form ﬁlters. Figure 15.1(a) is a simple example of a coupling-capacitor circuit. The
voltage transfer function for this circuit is
T(s) = Vo(s)
Vi(s) =

The Bode plot of the voltage gain magnitude |T( jω)| is shown in Figure 15.1(b). The
circuit is called a high-pass ﬁlter.
Figure 15.2(a) is another example of a simple RC network. Here, the voltage
transfer function is

follower
The Bode plot of the voltage gain magnitude |T( jω)| for this circuit is shown in
Figure 15.2(b). This circuit is called a low-pass ﬁlter.
Although these circuits both perform a basic ﬁltering function, they may suffer
from loading effects, substantially reducing the maximum gain from the unity value
shown in Figures 15.1(b) and 15.2(b). Also, the cutoff frequencies fL and fH may
change when a load is connected to the output. The loading effect can essentially be
eliminated by using a voltage follower as shown in Figure 15.3. In addition, a nonin-
verting ampliﬁer conﬁguration can be incorporated to increase the gain, as well as
eliminate the loading effects.
These two ﬁlter circuits are called one-pole ﬁlters; the slope of the voltage gain
magnitude curve outside the passband is 6 dB/octave or 20 dB/decade. This charac-
teristic is called the rolloff. The rolloff becomes sharper or steeper with higher-order
ﬁlters and is usually one of the speciﬁcations given for active ﬁlters.
Two other categories of ﬁlters are bandpass and band-reject. The desired ideal
frequency characteristics are shown in Figure 15.4.

General Two-Pole Active Filter
Consider Figure 15.5 with admittances Y1 through Y4 and an ideal voltage follower.
We will derive the transfer function for the general network and will then apply spe-
ciﬁc admittances to obtain particular ﬁlter characteristics.
15.1.2
A KCL equation at node Va yields
(Vi −Va)Y1 = (Va −Vb)Y2 + (Va −Vo)Y3
(15.3)
A KCL equation at node Vb produces
(Va −Vb)Y2 = VbY4
(15.4)
From the voltage follower characteristics, we have Vb = Vo. Therefore, Equa-
tion (15.4) becomes
Va = Vb
Y2 + Y4
Y2


Y2 + Y4

(15.5)
Substituting Equation (15.5) into (15.3) and again noting that Vb = Vo, we have

= Vo
Y2 + Y4
Y2

(Y1 + Y2 + Y3)
(15.6)
Multiplying Equation (15.6) by Y2 and rearranging terms, we get the following
expression for the transfer function:
T(s) = Vo(s)
Vi(s) =
Y1Y2
Y1Y2 + Y4(Y1 + Y2 + Y3)
(15.7)
To obtain a low-pass ﬁlter, both Y1 and Y2 must be conductances, allowing the
signal to pass into the voltage follower at low frequencies. If element Y4 is a capaci-
tor, then the output rolls off at high frequencies.
To produce a two-pole function, element Y3 must also be a capacitor. On the
other hand, if elements Y1 and Y2 are capacitors, then the signal will be blocked at
low frequencies but will be passed into the voltage follower at high frequencies, re-
sulting in a high-pass ﬁlter. Therefore, admittances Y3 and Y4 must both be conduc-
tances to produce a two-pole high-pass transfer function.

Figure 15.6 General two-pole low-pass ﬁlter
Two-Pole Low-Pass Butterworth Filter
To form a low-pass ﬁlter, we set Y1 = G1 = 1/R1, Y2 = G2 = 1/R2, Y3 = sC3, and
Y4 = sC4, as shown in Figure 15.6. The transfer function, from Equation (15.7),
becomes
T(s) = Vo(s)
Vi(s) =
G1G2
G1G2 + sC4(G1 + G2 + sC3)
(15.8)
15.1.3
At zero frequency, s = jω = 0 and the transfer function is
T(s = 0) = G1G2
G1G2
= 1
(15.9)
In the high-frequency limit, s = jω →∞and the transfer function approaches zero.
This circuit therefore acts as a low-pass ﬁlter.
A Butterworth ﬁlter is a maximally ﬂat magnitude ﬁlter. The transfer func-
tion is designed such that the magnitude of the transfer function is as ﬂat as possible
within the passband of the ﬁlter. This objective is achieved by taking the derivatives
of the transfer function with respect to frequency and setting as many as possible
equal to zero at the center of the passband, which is at zero frequency for the low-
pass ﬁlter.
Let G1 = G2 ≡G = 1/R. The transfer function is then

obtain
T( jω) =
1
1 + jωτ4(2 + jωτ3) =
1
(1 −ω2τ3τ4) + j(2ωτ4)
(15.11)
The magnitude of the transfer function is therefore
|T( jω)| = [(1 −ω2τ3τ4)2 + (2ωτ4)2]−1/2
(15.12)

(15.15)
Equation (15.15) is satisﬁed when 2τ4 = τ3, or
C3 = 2C4
(15.16)
For this condition, the transfer magnitude is, from Equation (15.12),
|T| =

(15.17)
The 3 dB, or cutoff, frequency occurs when |T| = 1/

C4 = 0.707C
(15.20(a))
and
C3 = 1.414C
(15.20(b))
The two-pole low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter is shown in Figure 15.7(a). The Bode
plot of the transfer function magnitude is shown in Figure 15.7(b). From Equa-

of 2τ4 = τ3 produces the maximally ﬂat transfer characteristics of the Butterworth
ﬁlter.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.1
Objective: Design a two-pole low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter for an audio ampliﬁer
application.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit with the conﬁguration shown in Figure 15.7(a) is to be
designed such that the bandwidth is 20 kHz.
Choices: An ideal op-amp is available and standard-valued resistors and capacitors
must be used.

2π(20 × 103) = 7.96 × 10−6
If we let R = 100 k, then C = 79.6 pF, which means that C3 = 1.414C = 113 pF
and C4 = 0.707C = 56.3 pF.
Trade-offs: Standard-valued 100 k resistors can be used. Standard-valued C3 =
120 pF and C4 = 56 pF capacitors can be used. For these elements, a bandwidth of
20.1 kHz is obtained.
Comment: These resistance and capacitance values are generally too large to be fab-
ricated conveniently on an IC. Instead, discrete resistors and capacitors, in conjunc-
tion with the IC op-amp, would need to be used.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.1: Design a two-pole low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter with a bandwidth of
25 kHz. The largest capacitor value to be used is 50 pF. (Ans. Set C3 = 50 pF,
then C4 = 25 pF, R = 180 k)

Two-Pole High-Pass Butterworth Filter
To form a high-pass filter, the resistors and capacitors are interchanged from those
in the low-pass filter. A two-pole high-pass Butterworth filter is shown in Fig-
ure 15.8(a). The analysis proceeds exactly the same as in the last section, except
that the derivative is set equal to zero at s = jω = ∞. Also, the two capacitors are
set equal to each other. The 3 dB or cutoff frequency can be written in the general

Higher-Order Butterworth Filters
The ﬁlter order is the number of poles and is usually dictated by the application
requirements. An N-pole active low-pass ﬁlter has a high-frequency rolloff rate of
N × 6 dB/octave. Similarly, the response of an N-pole high-pass ﬁlter increases at a
rate of N × 6 dB/octave, up to the cutoff frequency. In each case, the 3 dB frequency
is deﬁned as

Figure 15.9(a) shows a three-pole low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter. The three resistors
are equal, and the relationship between the capacitors is found by taking the ﬁrst and
second derivatives of the voltage gain magnitude with respect to frequency and set-
ting those derivatives equal to zero at s = jω = 0. Figure 15.9(b) shows a three-pole
high-pass Butterworth ﬁlter. In this case, the three capacitors are equal and the rela-
tionship between the resistors is also found through the derivatives.
Higher-order ﬁlters can be created by adding additional RC networks. However,
the loading effect on each additional RC circuit becomes more severe. The usefulness
of active ﬁlters is realized when two or more op-amp ﬁlter circuits are cascaded to

produce one large higher-order active ﬁlter. Because of the low output impedance of
the op-amp, there is virtually no loading effect between cascaded stages.
Figure 15.10(a) shows a four-pole low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter. The maximally ﬂat
response of this ﬁlter is not obtained by simply cascading two two-pole ﬁlters. The rela-
tionship between the capacitors is found through the ﬁrst three derivatives of the trans-
fer function. The four-pole high-pass Butterworth ﬁlter is shown in Figure 15.10(b).
Higher-order ﬁlters can be designed but are not considered here. Bandpass and
band-reject ﬁlters use similar circuit conﬁgurations.
Switched-Capacitor Filter
The results of Example 15.1 demonstrated that discrete resistors and capacitors may
be needed in active ﬁlters, since the required resistance and capacitance values are
too large to be conveniently fabricated on a monolithic IC chip. Large-value resistors
(R > 10 k) require a large chip area, and the absolute-value tolerance is difﬁcult to
maintain. In addition, the maximum capacitance for a monolithic IC capacitor is
approximately 100 pF, which is also limited by the large chip area required and the
absolute-value tolerance. In these cases, accurate RC time constants may be difﬁcult
to maintain.

Conventional active ﬁlters usually combine an IC op-amp and discrete resistors
and capacitors. However, even with discrete resistors and capacitors, standard com-
ponents may not be available for the design of a speciﬁc cutoff frequency. Design ac-
curacy for a speciﬁc cutoff frequency may therefore have to be sacriﬁced.
Switched-capacitor ﬁlters have the advantage of an all-IC circuit. The ﬁlter
uses small capacitance values and realizes large effective resistance values by using
a combination of capacitors and MOS switching transistors.
The Basic Principle of the Switched Capacitor
Figure 15.11 shows a simple circuit in which voltages V1 and V2 are applied at the
terminals of a resistance R. The current in the resistor is
I = V1 −V2
R
(15.27(a))
The resistance is therefore
R = V1 −V2
I
(15.27(b))
Since the current is the rate of charge ﬂow, Equation (15.27(b)) states that the resis-
tance is a voltage difference divided by the rate of charge ﬂow. We use this basic
deﬁnition in switched-capacitor circuits.
The circuit in Figure 15.12(a) consists of two MOSFETs and a capacitor. A two-
phase clock provides complementary but nonoverlapping φ1 and φ2 gate pulses, as
shown in Figure 15.12(b). When a clock pulse is high, the corresponding transistor
turns on; when the gate pulse is low, the transistor is off.

When φ1 goes high, M1 turns on and capacitor C charges up to V1. When φ2 goes
high, M2 turns on and capacitor C discharges to V2 (assuming V1 > V2). The amount
of charge transferred during this process is Q = C(V1 −V2) and the transfer occurs
during one clock period TC. The equivalent current is then

Using this technique, we can simulate an equivalent resistance by alternately
charging and discharging a capacitor between two voltage levels. A large equivalent
resistance can be simulated by using a small capacitance and an appropriate clock fre-
quency. The circuit in Figure 15.12(a) is therefore called a switched-capacitor circuit.
EXAMPLE 15.2
Objective: Determine the clock frequency required to simulate a speciﬁc resistance.
Consider the switched-capacitor circuit in Figure 15.12(a). Assume a capaci-
tance of C = 20 pF. Determine the clock frequency required to simulate a 1 M
resistance.
Solution: From Equation (15.29), we ﬁnd that
fC =
1
C Req
=

(20 × 10−12)(106) ⇒50 kHz
Comment: A very large resistance can be readily simulated by a small capacitance
and a reasonable clock frequency.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.2: Consider the switched-capacitor circuit in Figure 15.12(a). (a) If the
clock frequency is fC = 100 kHz and C = 1.2 pF, what is the value of the simu-
lated resistance? (b) A 50 M resistor is to be simulated using a clock frequency
of fC = 50 kHz. What is the required value of capacitor? (Ans. (a) Req = 8.33 M,
(b) C = 0.4 pF)
Various classes of active ﬁlters, such as low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and
band-reject circuits, can be implemented by the switched-capacitor technique, which
then results in an all-capacitor ﬁlter circuit.

and the cutoff frequency is

(15.31)
If a 10 kHz cutoff frequency is required and if CF = 10 pF, then the RF resistance
required is approximately 1.6 M. In addition, if a gain of −10 is desired, then re-
sistance R1 must be 160 k.
The equivalent switched-capacitor ﬁlter is shown in Figure 15.13(b). The
transfer function is still given by Equation (15.30), where RFeq = 1/( fCC2) and
R1eq = 1/( fCC1). The transfer function is then

The low-frequency gain is −C1/C2, which is just the ratio of two capacitances,
and the 3 dB frequency is
f3 dB = ( fCC2)/(2πCF)
which is also proportional to the ratio of two other capacitances. For MOS IC ca-
pacitance values of approximately 10 pF, the ratio tolerance is on the order of 0.1
percent. This means that switched-capacitor filter characteristics can be precisely
controlled.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.3
Objective: Design a one-pole low-pass switched capacitor ﬁlter to meet a set of
speciﬁcations.
Specifications: The circuit with the configuration shown in Figure 15.13(b) is to
be designed such that the low-frequency gain is −1 and the cutoff frequency is
1 kHz.
Choices: An ideal op-amp is available and standard-valued capacitors are to be used.
Solution: From Equation (15.32), the low-frequency gain is −(C1/C2), and the ca-
pacitance ratio must be (C1/C2) = 1. From Equation (15.32), the cutoff frequency is
f3 dB = fCC2
2πCF
If we set the clock frequency to fC = 10 kHz, then
C2
CF
= 2π f3 dB
fC
= 2π(103)
10 × 103 = 0.628
Trade-offs: We can use standard-valued capacitors C1 = C2 = 75 pF. We would
need CF = C2/0.628 = 75/0.628 = 119.4 pF. A standard-valued capacitor CF =
120 pF can be used.
Comment: Since the low-frequency gain and cutoff frequency are both functions of
capacitor ratios, the absolute capacitor values can be designed for compatibility with
IC fabrication.

EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.3: For the switched-capacitor circuit in Figure 15.13(b), the parameters
are: C1 = 30 pF, C2 = 5 pF, and CF = 12 pF. The clock frequency is 100 kHz.
Determine the low-frequency gain and the cutoff frequency. (Ans. −C1/C2 =
−6, f3 dB = 6.63 kHz)
This discussion of switched-capacitor ﬁlters is a short introduction to the topic
and is intended only to show another application of operational ampliﬁers. Switched-
capacitor ﬁlters are “sampled-data systems”; that is, the analog input signal is not
transmitted through the circuit as a continuous signal but passes through the system
as a series of pulses. The equivalent resistance given by Equation (15.29) is valid
only for clock frequencies much greater than the analog input signal frequency.
Switched-capacitor systems can be analyzed and designed by z-transform techniques.

OSCILLATORS
Objective: • Analyze and design oscillators that provide sinusoidal
signals at speciﬁed frequencies.
In this section, we will look at the basic principles of sine-wave oscillators. In our study
of feedback in Chapter 12, we emphasized the need for negative feedback to provide a
stable circuit. Oscillators, however, use positive feedback and, therefore, are actually
nonlinear circuits in some cases. The analysis and design of oscillator circuits are di-
vided into two parts. In the ﬁrst part, the condition and frequency for oscillation are
determined; in the second part, means for amplitude control is addressed. We consider
only the ﬁrst step in this section to gain insight into the basic operation of oscillators.

Chapter 15 Applications and Design of Integrated Circuits
1075
Basic Principles for Oscillation
The basic oscillator consists of an ampliﬁer and a frequency-selective network
connected in a feedback loop. Figure 15.14 shows a block diagram of the fundamen-
tal feedback circuit, in which we are implicitly assuming that negative feedback is
employed. Although actual oscillator circuits do not have an input signal, we initially
include one here to help in the analysis. In previous feedback circuits, we assumed
the feedback transfer function β was independent of frequency. In oscillator circuits,
however, β is the principal portion of the loop gain that is dependent on frequency.
For the circuit shown, the ideal closed-loop transfer function is given by
Af (s) =
A(s)

Figure 15.14 Block diagram of the fundamental feedback circuit
and the loop gain of the feedback circuit is
T(s) = A(s)β(s)
(15.34)
From our discussion of feedback in Chapter 12, we know that the loop gain T(s)
is positive for negative feedback, which means that the feedback signal vf b subtracts
from the input signal vs. If the loop gain T(s) becomes negative, then the feedback
signal phase causes vf b to add to the input signal, increasing the error signal vε. If
T(s) = −1, the closed-loop transfer function goes to inﬁnity, which means that the
circuit can have a ﬁnite output for a zero input signal.
As T(s) approaches −1, an actual circuit becomes nonlinear, which means that
the gain does not go to inﬁnity. Assume that T(s) ≈−1 so that positive feedback
exists over a particular frequency range. If a spontaneous signal (due to noise) is cre-
ated at vs in this frequency range, the resulting feedback signal vf b is in phase with
vs, and the error signal vε is reinforced and increased. This reinforcement process
continues at only those frequencies for which the total phase shift around the feed-
back loop is zero. Therefore, the condition for oscillation is that, at a speciﬁc fre-
quency, we have
T( jωo) = A( jωo)β( jωo) = −1
(15.35)
The condition that T( jωo) = −1 is called the Barkhausen criterion.
Equation (15.35) shows that two conditions must be satisﬁed to sustain
oscillation:
1.
The total phase shift through the ampliﬁer and feedback network must be
N × 360◦, where N = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
2.
The magnitude of the loop gain must be unity.

1076
Part 2
Analog Electronics
In the feedback circuit block diagram in Figure 15.14, we implicitly assume
negative feedback. For an oscillator, the feedback transfer function, or the frequency-
selective network, must introduce an additional 180 degree phase shift such that the
net phase around the entire loop is zero. For the circuit to oscillate at a single fre-
quency ωo, the condition for oscillation, from Equation (15.35), should be satisﬁed at
only that one frequency.
Phase-Shift Oscillator
An example of an op-amp oscillator is the phase-shift oscillator. One conﬁguration
of this oscillator circuit is shown in Figure 15.15. The basic ampliﬁer of the circuit is
the op-amp A3, which is connected as an inverting ampliﬁer with its output con-
nected to a three-stage RC ﬁlter. The voltage followers in the circuit eliminate load-
ing effects between each RC ﬁlter stage.

Figure 15.15 Phase-shift oscillator circuit with voltage-follower buffer stages
The inverting ampliﬁer introduces a −180 degree phase shift, which means that
each RC network must provide 60 degrees of phase shift to produce the 180 degrees
required of the frequency-sensitive feedback network in order to produce positive
feedback. Note that the inverting terminal of op-amp A3 is at virtual ground; there-
fore, the RC network between op-amps A2 and A3 functions exactly as the other two
RC networks. We assume that the frequency effects of the op-amps themselves occur
at much higher frequencies than the response due to the RC networks. Also, to aid in
the analysis, we assume an input signal (vI ) exists at one node as shown in the ﬁgure.
The transfer function of the ﬁrst RC network is
v1 =

(15.39)
From Equation (15.35), the condition for oscillation is that |T( jωo)| = 1 and the
phase of T( jωo) must be 180 degrees. When these requirements are satisﬁed, then
vO will equal (vI ) and a separate input signal will not be required.

must equal zero. Since the numerator is purely imaginary, the denominator must
become purely imaginary, or

Equation (15.43) implies that if the magnitude of the inverting ampliﬁer gain is
greater than 8, the circuit will spontaneously begin oscillating and will sustain
oscillation.
EXAMPLE 15.4
Objective: Determine the oscillation frequency and required ampliﬁer gain for a
phase-shift oscillator.
Consider the phase-shift oscillator in Figure 15.15 with parameters C = 0.1 μF

Comment: Higher oscillation frequencies can easily be obtained by using smaller
capacitor values.

C = 408 pF, R2 = 80 k)

As required, each RC network introduces a 60 degree phase shift, but they each also
introduce an attenuation factor of ( 1

The two voltage followers in the circuit in Figure 15.15 need not be included in
a practical phase-shift oscillator. Figure 15.16 shows a phase-shift oscillator without
the voltage-follower buffer stages. The three RC network stages and the inverting
ampliﬁer are still included. The loading effect of each successive RC network
complicates the analysis, but the same principle of operation applies. The analysis
shows that the oscillation frequency is

Wien-Bridge Oscillator
Another basic oscillator is the Wien-bridge circuit, shown in Figure 15.17. The cir-
cuit consists of an op-amp connected in a noninverting conﬁguration and two RC net-
works connected as the frequency-selecting feedback circuit.
Again, we initially assume that an input signal exists at the noninverting termi-
nals of the op-amp. Since the noninverting ampliﬁer introduces zero phase shift, the
frequency-selective feedback circuit must also introduce zero phase shift to create
the positive feedback condition.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.5
Objective: Design a Wien-bridge circuit to oscillate at a speciﬁed frequency.
Speciﬁcations: Design the Wien-bridge oscillator shown in Figure 15.17 to oscillate
at fo = 20 kHz.
Choices: An ideal op-amp is available and standard-valued resistors and capacitors
are to be used.
Solution: The oscillation frequency given by Equation (15.52(b)) yields
RC =
1
2π fo
=
1
2π(20 × 103) = 7.96 × 10−6
A 10 k resistor and 796 pF capacitor satisfy this requirement. Since the ampliﬁer
resistor ratio must be R2/R1 = 2, we could, for example, have R2 = 20 k and
R1 = 10 k, which would satisfy the requirement.
Trade-offs: Standard-valued resistors R1 = 10 k and R2 = 20 k. In place of the
ideal 796 pF capacitor, a standard-valued capacitor C = 800 pF can be used. The os-
cillation frequency would then be fo = 19.9 kHz. Element tolerance values should
also be considered.
Comment: As usual in any electronic circuit design, there is no unique solution.
Reasonably sized component values should be chosen whenever possible.
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: A Computer simulation was performed using
the circuit in Figure 15.18(a). Figure 15.18(b) shows the output voltage versus time.
Since the ratio of resistances is R2/R1 = 22/10 = 2.2, the overall gain is greater than
unity so the output increases as a function of time. This increase shows the oscillation
nature of the circuit. Another characteristic of the circuit is shown in Figure 15.18(c).
A 1 mV sinusoidal signal was applied to the input of R1 and the output voltage mea-
sured as the frequency was swept from 10 kHz to 30 kHz. The resonant nature of the
circuit is observed. The oscillation frequency and the resonant frequency are both at
approximately 18.2 kHz, which is below the design value of 20 kHz.

Additional Oscillator Conﬁgurations
Oscillators that use transistors and LC tuned circuits or crystals in their feedback
networks can be used in the hundreds of kHz to hundreds of MHz frequency range.
Although these oscillators do not typically contain an op-amp, we include a brief
discussion of such circuits for completeness. We will examine the Colpitts, Hartley,
and crystal oscillators.
Colpitts Oscillator
The ac equivalent circuit of the Colpitts oscillator with an FET is shown in Fig-
ure 15.19. A circuit with a BJT can also be designed. A parallel LC resonant circuit
is used to establish the oscillator frequency, and feedback is provided by a voltage
divider between capacitors C1 and C2. Resistor R in conjunction with the transistor
provides the necessary gain at resonance. We assume that the transistor frequency
response occurs at a high enough frequency that the oscillation frequency is deter-
mined by the external elements only.
Figure 15.20 shows the small-signal equivalent circuit of the Colpitts oscillator.
The transistor output resistance ro can be included in R. A KCL equation at the out-
put node yields

where gm R is the magnitude of the gain. Equation (15.61) states that to initiate
oscillations spontaneously, we must have gm R > (C2/C1).
Hartley Oscillator
Figure 15.21 shows the ac equivalent circuit of the Hartley oscillator with a BJT.
An FET can also be used. Again, a parallel LC resonant circuit establishes the oscil-
lator frequency, and feedback is provided by a voltage divider between inductors L1
and L2.
The analysis of the Hartley oscillator is essentially identical to that of the
Colpitts oscillator. The frequency of oscillation, neglecting transistor frequency
effects, is
ωo =
1
√(L1 + L2)C
(15.62)
Equation (15.62) also assumes that rπ ≫1/(ωC2).
Crystal Oscillator
A piezoelectric crystal, such as quartz, exhibits electromechanical resonance charac-
teristics in response to a voltage applied across the crystal. The oscillations are very
stable over time and temperature, with temperature coefﬁcients on the order of 1 ppm
per ◦C. The oscillation frequency is determined by the crystal dimensions. This
means that crystal oscillators are ﬁxed-frequency devices.
The circuit symbol for the piezoelectric crystal is shown in Figure 15.22(a), and
the equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 15.22(b). The inductance L can be as high as
a few hundred henrys, the capacitance Cs can be on the order of 0.001 pF, and the

capacitance Cp can be on the order of a few pF. Also, the Q-factor can be on the order
of 104, which means that the series resistance r can be neglected.

Equation (15.63) indicates that the crystal has two resonant frequencies, which are
very close together. At the series-resonant frequency fs, the reactance of the series
branch is zero; at the parallel-resonant frequency fp, the reactance of the crystal
approaches inﬁnity.
Between the resonant frequencies fs and fp, the crystal reactance is inductive,
so the crystal can be substituted for an inductance, such as that in a Colpitts oscilla-
tor. Figure 15.23 shows the ac equivalent circuit of a Pierce oscillator, which is sim-
ilar to the Colpitts oscillator in Figure 15.19 but with the inductor replaced by the
crystal. Since the crystal reactance is inductive over a very narrow frequency range,
the frequency of oscillation is also conﬁned to this narrow range and is quite constant
relative to changes in bias current or temperature. Crystal oscillator frequencies are
usually in the range of tens of kHz to tens of MHz.

SCHMITT TRIGGER CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze and design various Schmitt trigger circuits.
In this section, we will analyze another class of circuits that utilize positive feedback.
The basic circuit is commonly called a Schmitt trigger, which can be used in the
class of waveform generators called multivibrators. The three general types of
multivibrators are: bistable, monostable, and astable. In this section, we will examine
the bistable multivibrator, which has a comparator with positive feedback and has
two stable states. We will discuss the comparator ﬁrst, and will then describe various
applications of the Schmitt trigger.
Comparator
The comparator is essentially an op-amp operated in an open-loop conﬁguration, as
shown in Figure 15.24(a). As the name implies, a comparator compares two voltages

Figure 15.24 (a) Open-loop comparator and (b) voltage transfer characteristics, open-loop

to determine which is larger. The comparator is usually biased at voltages +VS and
−VS, although other biases are possible.
The voltage transfer characteristics, neglecting any offset voltage effects, are
shown in Figure 15.24(b). When v2 is slightly greater than v1, the output is driven to
a high saturated state VH; when v2 is slightly less than v1, the output is driven to a low
saturated state VL. The saturated output voltages VH and VL may be close to the sup-
ply voltages +VS and −VS, respectively, which means that VL may be negative. The
transition region is the region in which the output voltage is in neither of its satura-
tion states. This region occurs when the input differential voltage is in the range
−δ < (v2 −v1) < +δ. If, for example, the open-loop gain is 105 and the difference
between the two output states is (VH −VL) = 10 V, then
2δ = 10/105 = 10−4 V = 0.1 mV
The range of input differential voltage in the transition region is normally very small.
One major difference between a comparator and op-amp is that a comparator need
not be frequency compensated. Frequency stability is not a consideration since the com-
parator is being driven into one of two states. Since a comparator does not contain a fre-
quency compensation capacitor, it is not slew-rate-limited by the compensation capaci-
tor as is the op-amp. Typical response times for the comparator output to change states
are in the range of 30 to 200 ns. An expected response time for a 741 op-amp with a slew
rate of 0.7 V/μs would be on the order of 30 μs, which is a factor of 1000 times greater.
Figure 15.25 shows two comparator conﬁgurations along with their voltage
transfer characteristics. In both, the input transition region width is assumed to be
negligibly small. The reference voltage may be either positive or negative, and the
output saturation voltages are assumed to be symmetrical about zero. The crossover
voltage is deﬁned as the input voltage at which the output changes states.
Two other comparator conﬁgurations, in which the crossover voltage is a func-
tion of resistor ratios, are shown in Figure 15.26. Input bias current compensation is
also included in this ﬁgure. From Figure 15.26(a), we use superposition to obtain

proportional to the amount of light incident on the photodetector. During the night,
vI < VREF, and vO is on the order of VS = +15 V; the transistor turns on. The cur-
rent in the relay switch then turns the street lights on. During the day, the light inci-
dent on the photodetector produces an output signal such that vI > VREF. In this case,
vO is on the order of −VS = −15 V, and the transistor turns off.
Diode D1 is used as a protection device, preventing reverse-bias break-down in
the B–E junction. With zero output current, the relay switch is open and the street
lights are off. At dusk and dawn, vI = VREF.
The open-loop comparator circuit in Figure 15.27(a) may exhibit unacceptable
behavior in response to noise in the system. Figure 15.27(a) shows the comparator
circuit, with a variable light source, such as clouds causing the light intensity to ﬂuc-
tuate over a short period of time. A variable light intensity would be equivalent to a
noise source vn in series with the signal source vI . If we assume that vI is increasing
linearly with time (corresponding to dawn), then the total input signal v′
I versus time
is shown in Figure 15.27(b). When v′
I > VREF, the output switches low; when
v′
I < VREF, the output switches high, producing a chatter effect in the output signal
as shown in Figure 15.27(c). This effect would turn the street lights off and on over a
relatively short time period. If the amplitude of the noise signal increases, the chatter
effect becomes more severe. This chatter can be eliminated by using a Schmitt trigger.
Basic Inverting Schmitt Trigger
The Schmitt trigger or bistable multivibrator uses positive feedback with a loop-
gain greater than unity to produce a bistable characteristic. Figure 15.28(a) shows
one conﬁguration of a Schmitt trigger. Positive feedback occurs because the
feedback resistor is connected between the output terminal and noninverting input
terminal. Voltage v+, in terms of the output voltage, can be found by using a voltage
divider equation to yield

Voltage v+ does not remain constant; rather, it is a function of the output voltage.
Input signal vI is applied to the inverting terminal.
Voltage Transfer Characteristics
To determine the voltage transfer characteristics, we assume that the output of the
comparator is in one state, namely vO = VH, which is the high state. Then
v+ =

R1
R1 + R2

VH
(15.67)
As long as the input signal is less than v+, the output remains in its high state. The
crossover voltage occurs when vI = v+ and is deﬁned as VT H. We have
VT H =

R1
R1 + R2

VH
(15.68)
When vI is greater than VT H, the voltage at the inverting terminal is greater than that
at the noninverting terminal. The differential input voltage (vI −VT H) is ampliﬁed
by the open-loop gain of the comparator, and the output switches to its low state, or
vO = VL. Voltage v+ then becomes
v+ =

R1
R1 + R2

VL
(15.69)
Since VL < VH, the input voltage vI is still greater than v+, and the output re-
mains in its low state as vI continues to increase. This voltage transfer characteristic
is shown in Figure 15.28(b). Implicit in these transfer characteristics is the assump-
tion that VH is positive and VL is negative.

Now consider the transfer characteristic as vI decreases. As long as vI is larger
than v+ = [R1/(R1 + R2)]VL , the output remains in its low saturation state. The
crossover voltage now occurs when vI = v+ and is deﬁned as VT L. We have
VT L =

R1
R1 + R2

VL
(15.70)
As vI drops below this value, the voltage at the noninverting terminal is greater than
that at the inverting terminal. The differential voltage at the comparator terminals is
ampliﬁed by the open-loop gain, and the output switches to its high state, or
vO = VH. As vI continues to decrease, it remains less than v+; therefore, vO remains
in its high state. This voltage transfer characteristic is shown in Figure 15.28(c).
Complete Voltage Transfer and Bistable Characteristics
The complete voltage transfer characteristics of the Schmitt trigger in Figure 15.28(a)
combine the characteristics in Figures 15.28(b) and 15.28(c). These complete char-
acteristics are shown in Figure 15.28(d). As shown, the crossover voltages depend on
whether the input voltage is increasing or decreasing. The complete transfer charac-
teristics therefore show a hysteresis effect. The width of the hysteresis is the differ-
ence between the two crossover voltages VT H and VT L.
The bistable characteristic of the circuit occurs around the point vI = 0, at
which the output may be in either its high or low state. The output remains in either
state as long as vI remains in the range VT L < vI < VT H . The output switches states
only if the input increases above VT H or decreases below VT L.
EXAMPLE 15.6
Objective: Determine the hysteresis width of a particular Schmitt trigger.
Consider the Schmitt trigger in Figure 15.28(a), with parameters R1 = 10 k
and R2 = 90 k. Let VH = 10 V and VL = −10 V.
Solution: From Equation (15.68), the upper crossover voltage is
VT H =

R1 + R2

VH =

VT L =

R1
R1 + R2

VL =

10
10 + 90

(−10) = −1 V
The hysteresis width is therefore (VT H −VT L) = 2 V.
Comment: The hysteresis width can be designed to be larger or smaller for speciﬁc
applications by adjusting the voltage divider ratio of R1 and R2.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.6: Consider the comparator circuit in Figure 15.28(a). Assume high and
low saturated output voltages of +9 V and −9 V, respectively. Design the circuit
such that the crossover voltages are ±0.5 V. The minimum resistance is to be
10 k. (Ans. Set R1 = 10 k, then R2 = 170 k)

1090
Part 2
Analog Electronics
The complete voltage transfer characteristics in Figure 15.28(d) show the in-
verting characteristics of this particular Schmitt trigger. When the input signal be-
comes sufﬁciently positive, the output is in its low state; when the input signal is
sufﬁciently negative, the output is in its high state. Since the input signal is applied to
the inverting terminal of the comparator, this characteristic is as expected.
Additional Schmitt Trigger Conﬁgurations
A noninverting Schmitt trigger can be designed by applying the input signal to the
network connected to the comparator noninverting terminal. Also, both crossover
voltages of a Schmitt trigger circuit can be shifted in either a positive or negative di-
rection by applying a reference voltage. We will study these general circuit conﬁgu-
rations, the resulting voltage transfer characteristics, and an application of a Schmitt
trigger circuit in this section.
Noninverting Schmitt Trigger Circuit
Consider the circuit in Figure 15.29(a). The inverting terminal is held essentially at
ground potential, and the input signal is applied to resistor R1, which is connected to
the comparator noninverting terminal. Voltage v+ at the noninverting terminal then
becomes a function of both the input signal vI and the output voltage vO. Using
superposition, we ﬁnd that

If vI is negative, and the output is in its low state, then vO = VL (assumed to be neg-
ative), v+ is negative, and the output remains in its low saturation state. Crossover
voltage vI = VT H occurs when v+ = 0 and vO = VL, or, from Equation (15.71),

When v+ > 0, the output switches to its high saturation state.
The lower crossover voltage vI = VT L occurs when v+ = 0 and vO = VH. From
Equation (15.71), we have
0 = R2 VT L + R1 VH
(15.75(a))
which can be written
VT L = −

Since VH > 0, then VT L < 0.
The complete voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 15.29(b). We
again note the hysteresis effect and the bistable characteristic around vI = 0. With vI
sufﬁciently positive, the output is in its high state; with vI sufﬁciently negative,
the output is in its low state. The circuit thus exhibits the noninverting transfer
characteristic.
Schmitt Trigger Circuits with Applied Reference Voltages
The switching voltage of a Schmitt trigger is deﬁned as the average value of VT H and
VT L. For the two circuits in Figure 15.28(a) and 15.29(a), the switching voltages
are zero, assuming VT L = −VT H . In some applications, the switching voltage must
be either positive or negative. Both crossover voltages can be shifted in either a
positive or negative direction by applying a reference voltage.
Figure 15.30(a) shows an inverting Schmitt trigger with a reference voltage
VREF. The complete voltage transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 15.30(b).

Schmitt Trigger Application
Let us reconsider the street light control in Figure 15.27(a), which included a noise
source. Figure 15.32(a) shows the same basic circuit, except that a Schmitt trigger is
used instead of a simple comparator.
The input signal vI is again assumed to increase linearly with time. The total
input signal v′
I is vI with the noise signal superimposed, as shown in Figure 15.32(b).
At time t1, the input signal becomes greater than the switching voltage VS. The out-
put, however, does not switch, since v′
I < VT H. This means that the input signal is
less than the upper crossover voltage. At time t2, the input signal becomes larger than
the crossover voltage, or v′
I > VT H, and the output signal switches from its high to
its low state. At time t3, the input signal drops below VS, but the output does not
switch states since v′
I > VT L. This means that the input signal remains greater than

in the output voltage response results directly from the hysteresis effect in the
Schmitt trigger characteristics.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.7
Objective: Design a Schmitt trigger circuit for the photodetector switch circuit.
Speciﬁcations: The Schmitt trigger circuit with the conﬁguration shown in Figure
15.32(a) is to be designed such that the switching voltage is VS = 2 V and the hys-
teresis width is 60 mV. Assume VH = 5 V and VL = −5 V.
Choices: An ideal comparator is available and standard-valued resistors are to be
used in the ﬁnal design.
Solution: The Schmitt trigger circuit is the inverting type, for which the voltage
transfer characteristics are shown in Figure 15.30(b). From Equations (15.77(a)) and
(15.77(b)), the hysteresis width is
VT H −VT L =

which yields R2/R1 = 165.7. We can ﬁnd the reference voltage from Equation
(15.76), which can be rewritten to obtain

Resistor values of R1 = 100  and R2 = 16.57 k will satisfy the requirements. The
crossover voltages are thus VT H = 2.03 V and VT L = 1.97 V.

1094

Trade-offs: If we use standard-valued resistors R1 = 120  and R2 = 20 k, the
hysteresis width is

Resistor tolerances will also affect the results, but will not be considered here.
Comment: In this case, the output chatter effect is eliminated for noise signals with
amplitudes lower than 30 mV. The hysteresis width can be adjusted up or down to ﬁt
speciﬁc application requirements in which the noise signal is larger or smaller than
that given in this example.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.7: Redesign the street light control circuit shown in Figure 15.32(a) such
that the switching voltage is VS = 1 V and the hysteresis width is 100 mV. As-
sume VH = +10 V and VL = −10 V. Also, ﬁnd R such that I = 200 μA when
vO = VH. Assume VBE(on) = 0.7 V and Vγ = 0.7 V, and assume the relay
switch resistance is 100 . (Ans. R2/R1 = 199, VREF = 1.005 V, R = 42.9 k)
Schmitt Triggers with Limiters
In the Schmitt trigger circuits we have thus far considered, the open-loop saturation
voltages of the comparator may not be very precise and may also vary from one
comparator to another. The output saturation voltages can be controlled and made
more precise by adding limiter networks.
A direct approach at limiting the output is shown in Figure 15.33. Two back-to-
back Zener diodes are connected between the output and ground. Assuming the two
diodes are matched, the output is limited to either the positive or negative value of
(Vγ + VZ), where Vγ is the forward diode voltage and VZ is the reverse Zener volt-
age. Resistor R is chosen to produce a speciﬁed current in the diodes.

Another Schmitt trigger with a limiter is shown in Figure 15.34(a). If we assume that
vI = 0 and vO is in its high state, then D2 is on and D1 is off. Neglecting currents in the
100 k resistor, we have v2 = +Vγ , where Vγ is the forward diode voltage. We can write
vO −v2
1
= v2 −(−VREF)
1
(15.80)
Solving for vO yields
vO = VREF + 2Vγ
(15.81)
which means that the output voltage can be controlled and can be designed more
accurately. The ideal hysteresis characteristics for this Schmitt trigger are shown in
Figure 15.34(b). As vI increases or decreases, a small current ﬂows in the 100 k
resistor, producing a nonzero slope in the voltage transfer characteristics. The slope
is on the order of 1/100, which is quite small.

NONSINUSOIDAL OSCILLATORS 
AND TIMING CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze and design multivibrator circuits that provide
signals with particular waveforms.
Many applications, especially digital electronic systems, use a nonsinusoidal square-
wave oscillator to provide a clock signal for the system. This type of oscillator is
called an astable multivibrator. In other applications, a single pulse of known height
and width is used to initiate a particular set of functions. This type of oscillator is
called a monostable multivibrator. First, we will examine the Schmitt trigger con-
nected as an oscillator. Then we will analyze the 555 timer circuit. Although used ex-
tensively in digital electronic systems, these circuits are included here as comparator
circuit applications.
Schmitt Trigger Oscillator
The Schmitt trigger can be used in an oscillator circuit to generate a square-wave out-
put signal. This is accomplished by adding an RC network to the negative feedback
loop of the Schmitt trigger as shown in Figure 15.35. As we will see, this circuit has
no stable states. It is therefore called an astable multivibrator.
Initially, we set R1 and R2 equal to the same value, or R1 = R2 ≡R. We assume
that the output switches symmetrically about zero volts, with the high saturated out-
put denoted by VH = VP and the low saturated output denoted by VL = −VP. If vO
is low, or vO = −VP, then v+ = −( 1
2)VP. When vX drops just slightly below v+, the
output switches high so that vO = +VP and v+ = +( 1
2)VP. The RXCX network sees
a positive step-increase in voltage, so capacitor CX begins to charge and voltage vX
starts to increase toward a ﬁnal value of VP.
The general equation for the voltage across a capacitor in an RC network is
vX = vFinal + (vInitial −vFinal) e−t/τ
(15.82)
where vInitial is the initial capacitor voltage at t = 0, vFinal is the ﬁnal capacitor volt-
age at t = ∞, and τ is the time constant. We can now write
vX = VP +

or
vX = VP −3VP

where τx = RXCX . Voltage vX increases exponentially with time toward a final
voltage VP. However, when vX becomes just slightly greater than v+ = +( 1
2)VP ,
the output switches to its low state of vO = −VP and v+ = −( 1
2)VP . The RXCX
network sees a negative step change in voltage, so capacitor CX now begins to
discharge and voltage vX starts to decrease toward a final value of −VP. We can
now write
vX = −VP +

where t1 is the time at which the output switches to its low state. The capacitor voltage
then decreases exponentially with time. When vX decreases to v+ = −( 1
2)VP, the out-
put again switches to its high state. The process continues to repeat itself, which means
that this positive-feedback circuit oscillates producing a square-wave output signal.
Figure 15.36 shows the output voltage vO and the capacitor voltage vX versus time.

(15.85)
Solving for t1, we ﬁnd that
t1 = τx ln 3 = 1.1RXCX
(15.86)
From a similar analysis using Equation (15.84(b)), we ﬁnd that the difference
between t2 and t1 is also 1.lRXCX; therefore, the period of oscillation T is
T = 2.2RXCX
(15.87)
and the frequency of oscillation is
f = 1
T =

2.2RXCX
(15.88)
As an example of an application of this circuit, a variable frequency oscillator is
created by letting RX be a variable resistor.
The duty cycle of the oscillator is deﬁned as the percentage of time that the out-
put voltage vO is in its high state. For the circuit just considered, the duty cycle is
50 percent, as seen in Figure 15.36. This is a result of the symmetrical output volt-
ages +VP and −VP. If asymmetrical output voltages are used, then the duty cycle
changes from the 50 percent value.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.8
Objective: Design a Schmitt trigger oscillator for a speciﬁed frequency.
Speciﬁcations: Assume that an ideal comparator is available. Use standard-valued
resistors and capacitors in the ﬁnal design.

Consider the oscillator in Figure 15.35. Design the circuit to oscillate at

2.2(103) = 4.55 × 10−4
If CX = 0.1 μF, then RX = 4.55 k.
Trade-offs: Using standard-valued elements with values of CX = 0.082 μF and
RX = 5.6 k produces an oscillation frequency of 990 Hz, within 1% of the speci-
ﬁed value. If element tolerance values are taken into account, a potentiometer may
have to be used to produce the 1000 Hz oscillation frequency.
Comment: A larger frequency of oscillation can easily be obtained by using a
smaller capacitor value.

put voltages are +10 V and −5 V. R1 = R2 = 20 k, RX = 50 k, and CX =
0.01 μF. Determine the frequency of oscillation and the duty cycle. Sketch

Monostable Multivibrator
A monostable multivibrator has one stable state, in which it can remain indeﬁnitely
if not disturbed. However, a trigger pulse can force the circuit into a quasi-stable state
for a deﬁnite time, producing an output pulse with a particular height and width. The
circuit then returns to its stable state until another trigger pulse is applied. The mono-
stable multivibrator is also called a one-shot.
A monostable multivibrator is created by modifying the Schmitt trigger oscilla-
tor as shown in Figure 15.37. A clamping diode D1 is connected in parallel with CX.
In the stable state, the output is high and voltage vX is held low by the conducting
diode D1.

The trigger circuit is composed of the capacitor C, resistor R3, and diode D2,
and is connected to the noninverting terminal of the comparator. The value of R3 is
chosen to be much larger than R1, so that voltage vY is determined primarily by a
voltage divider of R1 and R2. We then have
vY ∼=

R1
R1 + R2

VP ≡βVP
(15.89)
where VP is the sum of the forward and breakdown voltages of DZ1 and DZ2, or
VP = (Vγ 1 + VZ2). This voltage is the positive saturated output voltage.
The circuit is triggered by a negative-going step voltage applied to capacitor C.
This action forward-biases diode D2 and pulls the voltage vY below vX. Since the
comparator then sees a larger voltage at the inverting terminal, the output switches to
its low state of
vO = −VP = −(Vγ 2 + VZ1)
Voltage vY then becomes
vY ∼= −

R1
R1 + R2

VP ≡−βVP
(15.90)
causing D2 to become reverse biased, thus isolating the oscillator circuit from the
input triggering network. The negative-step change in vO causes voltage vX to de-
crease exponentially with a time constant of τx = RXCX toward a ﬁnal value of
−VP. Diode D1 is reverse biased during this time. When vX drops just below the
value of vY given by Equation (15.90), the output switches back to its positive satu-
rated value of +VP. The capacitor voltage vX then starts to increase exponentially
toward a ﬁnal value of +VP. When vX reaches Vγ , diode D1 again becomes forward
biased, vX is clamped at Vγ , and the output remains in its high state.
The waveforms of vO and vX versus time are shown in Figure 15.38. After the
output has switched back to its high state, the capacitor voltage vX must return to its
quiescent value of vX = Vγ . This implies that there is a recovery time of (T ′ −T)
during which the circuit should not be retriggered.
For t > 0, voltage vX can be written in the same general form as Equation (15.82),
as follows:
vX = −VP + (Vγ −(−VP))e−t/τx

width is then
T = τx ln

(15.92)
If we assume Vγ ≪VP and if we let R1 = R2 such that β = 1/2, then the pulse
width is T = 0.69τx. We can show that for Vγ ≪VP and β = 1/2, the recovery time
is (T ′ −T) = 0.4τx. There are alternative circuits with shorter recovery times, but
we will not consider them here.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.9
Objective: Design a monostable multivibrator to produce a given pulse width.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit with the conﬁguration shown in Figure 15.37 is to be de-
signed to produce an output pulse that is 1 μs wide. Assume parameters of VP = 10 V,
Vγ = 0.7 V and R1 = R2 = 20 k.
Choices: Assume an ideal comparator is available. Use standard-valued element val-
ues in the ﬁnal design.
Solution: Since Vγ ≪VP and R1 = R2, then from Equation (15.92), we have
T = 0.69τx
or
τx = RXCX =
T
0.69 =

0.69 = 1.45 μs
If RX = 10 k, then CX = 145 pF.
Trade-offs: Using standard-valued elements of RX = 10 k and CX = 150 pF pro-
duces a pulse width of 1.035 μs. Element tolerances must also be taken into account
in the ﬁnal design.
Comment: In actual monostable multivibrator ICs, RX and CX are external elements
to allow for variable times.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 15.9: For the monostable circuit shown in Figure 15.37, the parameters are:

the value of RX that will result in a 50 μs output pulse. (b) Using the results of part
(a), ﬁnd the recovery time. (Ans. (a) RX = 3.09 k (b) 47.9 μs)
The 555 Circuit
The 555 monolithic integrated circuit timer was ﬁrst introduced by Signetics
Corporation in 1972 in bipolar technology. It quickly became an industry standard
for timing and oscillation functions. Many manufacturers produce a version of a
555 IC, some in CMOS technology. The 555 is a general-purpose IC that can be used
15.4.3

Chapter 15 Applications and Design of Integrated Circuits
1101
The RS ﬂip-ﬂop is a digital circuit that will be considered in detail in a later
chapter. Here, we will describe only the basic digital function of the ﬂip-ﬂop, so that
the operation of the 555 timer can be explained. When the input R is high and input
S is low, output ¯Q is high. The complementary state occurs when R is low and S is
high, producing a low ¯Q output. If both R and S are low, then output ¯Q remains in
its previous state.
Comparator 1 is called the threshold comparator, which compares its input
with an internal voltage reference set at ( 2
3)V + by the voltage divider R3, R4, and R5.
When the input level exceeds this reference level, the threshold comparator output
goes high, producing a high output at ﬂip-ﬂop terminal ¯Q. This turns the discharge
transistor on and an external timing capacitor (not shown in this ﬁgure) starts to
discharge.

555 can operate in both astable and monostable modes, with timing pulses ranging
from microseconds to hours. It also has an adjustable duty cycle and can generally
source or sink output currents up to 200 mA.

The internal control voltage node is connected to an external terminal. This pro-
vides external control of the reference level, should the timing period need to be
modiﬁed. When not in active use, this terminal should be bypassed to ground with a
0.01 μF capacitor, to improve the circuit’s noise immunity.
Comparator 2, called the trigger comparator, compares its input trigger voltage
to an internal voltage reference set to ( 1
3)V + by the same voltage divider as before.
When the output trigger level is reduced below this reference level, the trigger com-
parator output goes high, causing the RS ﬂip-ﬂop to reset. Output ¯Q goes low and the
discharge transistor turns off. This comparator triggers on the leading edge of a negative-
going input pulse.
The output stage of the 555 IC is driven by output ¯Q of the RS ﬂip-ﬂop. This
output is usually a totem-pole push–pull circuit, or a simple buffer, and is generally
capable of sourcing or sinking 200 mA.
An external reset input to the RS ﬂip-ﬂop overrides all other inputs and is used
to initiate a new timing cycle by turning the discharge transistor on. The reset input
must be less than 0.4 V to initiate a reset. When not actively in use, the reset terminal
should be connected to V + to prevent a false reset.
Monostable Multivibrator
A monostable multivibrator, also called a one-shot, operates by charging a timing
capacitor with a current set by an external resistance. When the one-shot is triggered,
the charging network cycles only once during the timing interval. The total timing
interval includes the recovery time needed for the capacitor to charge up to the
threshold level.
The external circuitry and connections for the 555 to be used as a one-shot mul-
tivibrator are shown in Figure 15.40. With a high voltage V + applied to the trigger
input, the trigger comparator output is low, the ﬂip-ﬂop output ¯Q is high, the dis-
charge transistor is turned on, and the timing capacitor C is discharged to nearly
ground potential. The output of the 555 circuit is then low, which is the quiescent
state of the one-shot.

Figure 15.40 The 555 circuit connected as a monostable multivibrator
When a negative-going pulse is applied to the trigger input, the output of the
trigger comparator goes high when the trigger pulse drops below ( 1
3)V +. Output ¯Q
goes low, which means that the output of the 555 goes high, and the discharge tran-
sistor turns off. The output of the 555 remains high even if the trigger pulse returns
to its initial high value, because the reset input to the ﬂip-ﬂop is still low. The timing

1104
Part 2

capacitor charges up exponentially toward a ﬁnal value of V + through resistor R.
The capacitor voltage is given by
v(t) = V +(1 −e−t/RC)
(15.93)
When v(t) = ( 2
3)V +, the threshold comparator output goes high, resetting the ﬂip-
ﬂop. Output ¯Q then goes high and the output of the 555 goes low. The high output at
¯Q also turns on the discharge transistor, allowing the timing capacitor to discharge to
near zero volts. The circuit thus returns to its quiescent state.
The width of the output pulse is determined from Equation (15.93). If we set
v(t) = ( 2
3)V + and t = T , then
2
3

V + = V + (1 −e−T/RC)
(15.94)
Solving for T , we have
T = RC ln(3) = 1.1 RC
(15.95)
The width of the output pulse is a function of only the external time constant
RC; it is independent of the supply voltage V + and any internal circuit parameters.
The triggering input pulse must be of a shorter duration than T . The output pulse
height is a function of V + as well as of the internal circuitry. For a bipolar 555, the
output pulse amplitude is approximately 1.7 V below supply voltage V +.
When the output is high and the timing capacitor is charging, another trigger
input pulse will have no effect on the circuit. If desired, the circuit can be reset
during this period by applying a low input to the reset terminal. The output will
return to zero and will remain in this quiescent state until another trigger pulse is
applied.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.10
Objective: Design a 555 IC as a monostable multivibrator to produce a speciﬁed
output pulse width.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit with the conﬁguration shown in Figure 15.40 is to be
designed to produce an output pulse width of 100 μs.
Choices: A 555 circuit is available. The ﬁnal design is to use standard-valued
elements.
Consider the circuit in Figure 15.40. Let C = 15 nF.
Solution: Using Equation (15.95), we ﬁnd that
R =
T
1.1C =
100 × 10−6
(1.1)(15 × 10−9) ⇒6.06 k
Trade-offs: Using standard-valued element values of C = 12 nF and R = 7.5 k
will produce an output pulse with a width of 99 μs. Element tolerances also need to
be taken into account.
Comment: To a very good approximation, the pulse width is a function of only the
external resistor and capacitance values. A wide range of pulse widths can be ob-
tained by changing these component values.

Astable Multivibrator
Figure 15.41 shows a typical external circuit connection for the 555 operating as an
astable multivibrator, also called a timer circuit or clock. The threshold input and
trigger input terminals are connected together. In the astable mode, the timing capac-
itor C charges through RA = RB until v(t) reaches ( 2
3)V +. The threshold compara-
tor output then goes high, forcing the ﬂip-ﬂop output ¯Q to go high. The discharge
transistor turns on, and the timing capacitor C discharges through RB and the dis-
charge transistor. The capacitor voltage decreases until it reaches ( 1
3)V +, at which
point the trigger comparator switches states and sends ¯Q low. The discharge transis-
tor turns off, and the timing capacitor begins to recharge. When v(t) reaches the
threshold level of ( 2
3)V +, the cycle repeats itself.

The duty cycle is deﬁned as the percentage of time the output is high during one
period of oscillation. During the charging time TC, the output is high; during the dis-
charging time, the output is low. The duty cycle is therefore
Duty cycle = TC
T × 100% = RA + RB
RA + 2RB
× 100%
(15.103)
Equation (15.103) shows that the duty cycle for this circuit is always greater than
50 percent. The duty cycle approaches 50 percent for RA ≪RB and 100 percent for
RB ≪RA. Alternative circuits can provide duty cycles of less than 50 percent.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.11
Objective: Design the 555 IC as an astable multivibrator for a speciﬁed frequency
and duty cycle.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit with the conﬁguration in Figure 15.41 is to be designed
such that the frequency is 50 kHz and the duty cycle is 75 percent.
Choices: A 555 IC circuit is available. A capacitor with a value of C = 1 nF is also
available.
Solution: The frequency of oscillation, as given by Equation (15.102), is

RA + 2RB
which yields
RA = 2RB
(15.105)
Combining Equations (15.104) and (15.105), we ﬁnd that
RA = 14.5 k
and
RB = 7.23 k

Chapter 15 Applications and Design of Integrated Circuits
1107
Trade-offs: If standard-valued resistors are required, then RA = 13 k and RB =
7.5 k would provide a frequency of 51.5 kHz and a duty cycle of 73.2 percent.
Comment: A wide range of oscillation frequencies can be obtained by changing the
resistance and capacitance values.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.11: The 555 IC is connected as an astable multivibrator. Let RA = 20 k,
RB = 80 k, and C = 0.01 μF. Determine the frequency of oscillation and the
duty cycle. (Ans. f = 802 Hz, duty cycle = 55.6%)
Other Applications
When the 555 is connected in the monostable mode, an external signal applied to the
control voltage terminal will change the charging time of the timing capacitor and the
pulse width. If the one-shot is triggered with a continuous pulse train, the output
pulse width will be modulated by the external signal. This circuit is known as a pulse
width modulator (PWM).
A pulse position modulator can also be developed using the astable mode.
A modulating signal applied to the control voltage terminal will vary the pulse position,
which will be controlled by the modulating signal in a manner similar to the PWM.
Finally, a linear ramp generator can be constructed, again using the 555 mono-
stable mode. The normal charging pattern of the timing capacitor is exponential
because of the RC circuit. If resistor R is replaced by a constant current source, a
linear ramp will be generated.

sist of high-gain small-signal ampliﬁers in cascade with an output stage.
Most IC power ampliﬁers consist of a high-gain small-signal ampliﬁer cascaded with

negative feedback incorporated on the chip, while others use a current gain output
stage and negative feedback external to the chip. We consider three examples of IC
power ampliﬁers in this section.
LM380 Power Ampliﬁer
The LM380 is a popular ﬁxed-gain power ampliﬁer capable of an ac power output up
to 5 W. Figure 15.42 is a simpliﬁed circuit diagram of the ampliﬁer. The input stage
is a Darlington pair conﬁguration composed of Q1 through Q4 and an active load
formed by Q5 and Q6.

The input stage is biased by currents through resistors R1A, R1B, and R2. Tran-
sistor Q3 is biased by a current from power supply V +, through the diode-connected
transistor Q10 and resistors R1A and R1B. Transistor Q4 is biased by a current from
the output terminal through R2. For zero input voltages, the currents in Q3 and Q4
are nearly equal. Assuming matched input transistors and neglecting base currents,
we ﬁnd that
IC3 = V + −3VE B

and
IC4 = VO −2VE B

Since IC3 = IC4, we can ﬁnd the quiescent output voltage by combining Equa-
tions (15.106) and (15.107), or

The quiescent output voltage is approximately half the power supply voltage,
which allows for a maximum output voltage swing and for maximum power to be de-
livered to a load. The feedback from the output to the emitter of Q4, through R2, sta-
bilizes the quiescent output voltage at this value.
The output signal of the diff-amp is the input signal to the base of Q12, which is
connected in a common-emitter conﬁguration in which Q11 acts as an active load.
The output signal from the collector of Q12 is the input to the class-AB output stage,
and capacitor CF provides frequency compensation.
The class-AB complementary push-pull emitter-follower output stage comprises
transistors Q7, Q8, and Q9 and diodes D1 and D2. Transistor Q7, which is the npn
half of the push-pull output stage, sources current to the load. Transistors Q8 and Q9
operate as a composite pnp transistor, with the overall current gain equal to the prod-
uct of the current gains of each transistor. This composite transistor is the pnp half of
the push-pull output stage sinking current from the load. Diodes D1 and D2 provide
the quiescent bias for class-AB operation.
The closed-loop gain is determined from the ac equivalent circuit in Figure 15.43.
A differential-input voltage is applied at the input, with Vid/2 applied at the nonin-
verting terminal and −Vid/2 applied at the inverting terminal. An external bypass ca-
pacitor is connected at the node between R1A and R1B, putting this node at signal
ground. The second stage and output stage are represented by ampliﬁer A. The input
impedance is assumed to be large, which means that the input current is assumed to
be negligible.

Since the input stage is an emitter-follower conﬁguration, the signal voltage is
approximately +Vid/2 at the emitter of Q4 and is approximately −Vid/2 at the emit-
ter of Q3. Comparing the resistor values of R3 and R1B, we see the signal current
in R1B is negligible. The signal current in Q3 is equal to that in R3, and the current-
mirror conﬁguration of Q5 and Q6 implies that the current in Q6 is also Vid/R3.

Equation (15.110) shows that the LM380 has a ﬁxed gain of approximately 50.
The LM380 is designed to operate in the range of 12–22 V from a single supply
V +. The value of V + depends on the power requirements. Figure 15.44 shows the
relationship between device dissipation, output power, and supply voltage for an 8 
load. As the output signal increases, harmonic distortion in the sinusoidal signal in-
creases because the output transistor is approaching the saturation region. The lines
marked 3% and 10% are the points at which harmonic distortion reaches 3% and
10%, respectively.

EXAMPLE 15.12
Objective: Determine the output voltage and conversion efﬁciency for an LM380
power ampliﬁer.
The required power for an 8  is to be 4 W, with minimum distortion in the out-
put signal.

Chapter 15 Applications and Design of Integrated Circuits
1111
Solution: From the curves in Figure 15.44, for an output of 4 W, minimum distortion
occurs when the supply voltage is a maximum, or V + = 22 V. For 4 W to be deliv-
ered to the 8  load, the peak output signal voltage is determined by
¯PL = 4 = V 2
P
2RL
= V 2
P
2(8)
which yields VP = 8 V.
The power dissipated in the device is 3 W, which means that the conversion
efﬁciency is 4/(3 + 4) →57 percent.
Comment: A reduction in the harmonic distortion means that the conversion efﬁ-
ciency is less than the theoretical value of 78.5 percent for the class-B output stages.
However, a conversion efﬁciency of 57 percent is still substantially larger than would
be obtained in any class-A ampliﬁer.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.12: The supply voltage to an LM380 power ampliﬁer, as shown in Fig-
ure 15.42, is 12 V. With a sinusoidal input signal, an average output power of 1 W
must be delivered to an 8  load. (a) Determine the peak output voltage and peak
output current. (b) When the output voltage is at its peak value, calculate the
instantaneous power being dissipated in Q7. (Ans. (a) VP = 4 V, Ip = 0.5 A
(b) PQ = 4 W)
PA12 Power Ampliﬁer
The basic circuit diagram of the PA12 amplifier is shown in Figure 15.45. The
input signal to the class-AB output stage is from a small-signal high-gain op-amp.
The power supply voltages are in the range of 10 ≤VS ≤50 V, the peak output
current is in the range −15 ≤IL ≤+15 A, and the maximum internal power dis-
sipation is 125 W. The output stage is a class-AB configuration using npn and pnp
Darlington pair transistors. The bias for the output transistors is established by the
VBE multiplier circuit composed of R1, R2, and Q4. Also, external feedback is
required.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 15.13
Objective: Design the supply voltage required in the PA12 power ampliﬁer to meet
a speciﬁc conversion efﬁciency.
Speciﬁcations: The circuit with the conﬁguration in Figure 15.45 has a load resis-
tance of 10 . The required average power delivered to the load is 20 W. Determine
the power supply voltage such that the conversion efﬁciency is 50 percent.
Choices: The circuit shown in Figure 15.45 is available.
Solution: For an average of 20 W delivered to the load, the peak output voltage is
Vp =

and the peak load current is
Ip = Vp
RL

10 = 2 A
Assuming an ideal class-B condition, for a 50 percent conversion efﬁciency, the
average power supplied by each VS source must be 20 W. If we neglect power dissi-
pation in the bias circuit, the average power supplied by each source is 
PS = VS

and the required supply voltage is then
VS = π RL PS
Vp

Trade-offs: The required power supply must also be able to deliver the required cur-
rent. For a power of 20 W delivered to the 10  load, the load current (rms value) by
itself is 1.41 A.
Comment: The actual conversion efﬁciency for class-AB operation is less than
50 percent. This reduced conversion efﬁciency ensures that harmonic distortion in
the output signal is not severe.
Computer Simulation Veriﬁcation: A computer simulation analysis of the circuit in
Figure 15.45 was performed. The supply voltages were set at ±31.4 V and the input si-
nusoidal signal was adjusted so that the peak sinusoidal output voltage was 19.7 V

across a 10  load resistor. For these settings, the bias supply currents were 1.971 A. The
average power delivered by the supply voltage sources is 39.4 W, so that the conversion
efﬁciency is 49.25 percent, which is just slightly below the design value of 50 percent.

(Ans. (a) (i) Vp = 14.14 V, Ip = 0.707 A; (ii) VS = 22.2 V; (b) (i) Vp = 12.65 V,
Ip = 1.58 A; (ii) VS = 19.9 V)
Bridge Power Ampliﬁer
Figure 15.46 shows a bridge power ampliﬁer that uses two op-amps. Ampliﬁer A1 is
connected in a noninverting conﬁguration; A2 is connected in an inverting conﬁgura-
tion. The magnitudes of the two gains are equal to each other. The load, such as an
audio speaker, is connected between the two output terminals and is ﬂoating. A
sinusoidal input signal produces output voltages vo1 and vo2, which are equal in mag-
nitude but 180 degrees out of phase. The voltage across the load is therefore twice as
large as it would be if produced from a single op-amp.

VOLTAGE REGULATORS
Objective: • Analyze and design voltage regulators that establish a
relatively constant dc voltage generated from an ac signal source.
Another class of analog circuits that is used extensively in electronic systems is
the voltage regulator. We briefly considered constant-voltage circuits, or voltage
regulators, when we studied diode circuits and when we considered ideal op-amp
circuits in Chapter 9. In this section, we will discuss examples of IC voltage
regulators.
Basic Regulator Description
A voltage regulator is a circuit or device that provides a constant voltage to a load.
The output voltage is controlled by the internal circuitry and is relatively independent
of the load current supplied by the regulator.
A basic diagram of a voltage regulator is shown in Figure 15.47. It consists of
three basic parts: a reference voltage circuit; an error ampliﬁer, which is part of a
feedback circuit; and a current ampliﬁer, which supplies the required load current.
The reference voltage circuit produces a voltage that is essentially independent of
both supply voltage V + and temperature. As shown in the basic circuit of Figure
15.47, a fraction of the output voltage is fed back to the error ampliﬁer which,
through negative feedback, maintains the feedback voltage at a value equal to the ref-
erence voltage.

Figure 15.47 Basic circuit diagram of a voltage regulator
Since the regulator output voltage is derived from the reference voltage, any
variation in that reference voltage, as the power supply voltage V + changes, also af-
fects the output voltage. Line regulation is deﬁned as the ratio of the change in out-
put voltage to a given change in the input supply voltage, or
Line regulation = Vo
V +
(15.111)
Line regulation is one ﬁgure of merit of voltage regulators. In many cases, the refer-
ence voltage circuit contains one or more Zener diodes. Line regulation is then a
function of the Zener diode resistance and the effective resistance of the circuit bias-
ing the diode.

Chapter 15 Applications and Design of Integrated Circuits
1115
Output Resistance and Load Regulation
The ideal voltage regulator is equivalent to an ideal voltage source in that the output
voltage is independent of the output current and any output load impedance. In actual
voltage regulators, however, the output voltage is a slight function of output current.
This dependence is related to the output resistance of the regulator. 
The output resistance is deﬁned as the rate of change of output voltage with out-
put current, or
Rof = −VO
IO
(15.112)
The change in VO and IO is caused by a change in the load resistance RL. Every-
thing else in the circuit remains constant. The negative sign in Equation (15.112)
results from the voltage polarity and current direction, as shown in Figure 15.47. An
increase in IO produces a decrease in VO; therefore, the output resistance Rof is pos-
itive. The output resistance of a voltage regulator should be small, so that a change in
output current IO will result in only a small change in output voltage VO.
The notation Rof for the output resistance of the voltage regulator is the same as
the term for the output resistance of a feedback circuit. This is appropriate since volt-
age regulators use feedback.
A second ﬁgure-of-merit for voltage regulators is load regulation. Load regulation
is deﬁned as the change in output voltage between a no-load current condition and a full-
load current condition. Load regulation can be expressed as a percentage, or
Load regulation = VO(NL) −VO(FL)
VO(NL)
× 100%
(15.113)
where VO(NL) is the output voltage for a zero-load current condition and VO(FL) is
the output voltage for a full-load or maximum load current condition.
In some applications, a zero-load current is impractical, and a load current that
is approximately 1 percent of the full-load current is used as the no-load condition.
In most cases, this condition provides an adequate deﬁnition for load regulation.
EXAMPLE 15.14
Objective: Determine the output resistance and load regulation of a voltage regulator.
Assume the output voltage of a regulator is 5.0 V for a load current of 5 mA, and
is 4.96 V for a load current of 1.5 A.
Solution: If we assume that the output voltage decreases linearly with load current,
then the output resistance is

The load regulation is then

Comment: The output resistance of a voltage regulator is usually not constant at all
load currents, but the values are typically in the milliohm range. Also, a load regula-
tion of 0.8% is typical of many voltage regulators.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.14: The reference voltage for a constant-voltage source is established by
the simple combination of V +, R1, and DI , as shown in the regulator circuit in
Figure 15.48. If the Zener diode resistance is RZ = 10  and the zero-current
diode voltage is VZo = 5.6 V, determine the line regulation of the voltage regula-
tor. Assume an ideal op-amp. (Ans. 0.454%)

Simple Series-Pass Regulator
Figure 15.49 shows a simple voltage regulator that includes an error ampliﬁer (com-
parator) and series-pass transistors. The series-pass transistors, which are connected
in a Darlington emitter-follower conﬁguration, form the current ampliﬁer. A resistive
voltage divider allows a portion of the output voltage to be fed back to the error am-
pliﬁer. The closed-loop feedback system acts to maintain this fraction of the output
voltage at a value equal to the reference voltage.

Since the output of the feedback circuit is a shunt connection, the output resis-

Rof =

(15.115)
where Ro is the output resistance of the open-loop system and T is the loop gain.
From feedback theory, the closed-loop and open-loop gains are related by
ACL = AOL

Combining Equation (15.115) and (15.116), we can write the closed-loop output

(15.117)
From the circuit in Figure 15.49, the closed-loop gain is
ACL = VO

(15.118)
The open-loop output resistance is the output resistance of the series-pass tran-
sistors, which are operating in an emitter-follower conﬁguration. From previous
results, we can write
Ro = rπ2 + Ro1
(1 + β2)
(15.119)
where
Ro1 = rπ1 + Roa
(1 + β1)
(15.120)
in which Roa is the output resistance of the error ampliﬁer. If the current in Q2 is
essentially equal to IO and if β1 and β2 are large, then combining Equations (15.119)
and (15.120) yields
Ro ∼= 2VT

Since the product β1β2 is large, the second term in Equation (15.121) is generally

current, the output resistance may be unacceptably high.
The basic deﬁnition of output resistance is given in Equation (15.112). Using

a change of only 10−4 percent in output for a 10 percent change in current is a good
load regulation value.

Positive Voltage Regulator
In this section, we will analyze an example of a three-terminal positive voltage regu-
lator fabricated as an IC. The equivalent circuit, shown in Figure 15.51, is part of the
LM78LXX series, in which the XX designation indicates the output voltage of
the regulator. For example, an LM78L08 is an 8 V regulator.
Basic Circuit Description
Once the bias current is established, Zener diode D2 provides the basic reference
voltage. Transistors Q15 and Q16 and diode D1 form a start-up circuit that applies
the initial bias to the reference voltage circuit. As the voltage across D2 reaches the
Zener voltage, transistor Q15 turns off, since the B–E voltage goes to zero (D1 and
D2 are identical) and, the start-up circuit is then effectively disconnected from the
reference voltage circuit.

Analog Electronics
The reference portion of the circuit is composed of Zener diode D2 and transis-
tors Q3, Q2, and Q1, which are used for temperature compensation. The temperature
compensation aspects of the circuit are discussed later in this section. Zener diode D2
is biased by the current-source transistor Q4. The temperature-compensated portion
of the reference voltage at the node between R1 and R2 is applied to the base of Q7,
which is part of the error ampliﬁer.
The bias current in Q4 is established by the current in Q5, which is a multiple-
collector, multiple-emitter transistor. Transistor Q5 is biased by the current in Q3,
which is controlled by the Zener voltage across D2 and the B–E junction voltages of
Q3, Q2, and Q1. Consequently, the bias currents in the reference portion of the
circuit become almost independent of the input supply voltage. This in turn means
that the reference voltage, and thus the output voltage are essentially independent of
the power supply voltage. The overall result is very good line regulation.
The error ampliﬁer is the differential pair Q7 and Q8, biased by Q6 and R6. The
error ampliﬁer output is the input to the base of Q9, which is connected as an emitter
follower and forms part of the drive for the series-pass transistors. The series-pass
output transistors Q10 and Q11 are connected in a Darlington emitter-follower
conﬁguration.
A fraction of the output voltage, determined by the voltage divider R12 and R13,
is fed back to the base of Q8, which is the error-ampliﬁer inverting terminal. If the
output voltage is slightly below its nominal value, then the base voltage at Q8 is
smaller than that at Q7, and the current in Q7 becomes a larger fraction of the total
diff-amp bias current. The increased current in Q7 induces a larger current in Q10,
which in turn produces a larger current in Q11 and increases the output voltage to the
proper value. The opposite process occurs if the output voltage is above its nominal
value.
EXAMPLE 15.16
Objective: Determine the bias current, temperature-compensated reference voltage,
and required resistor R12 in a particular LM78LXX voltage regulator.
Consider the voltage regulator circuit in Figure 15.51. Assume Zener diode volt-
ages of VZ = 6.3 V and transistor parameters of VBE(npn) = VE B(pnp) = 0.6 V.
Design R12 such that VO = 8 V.
Solution: The bias current, neglecting base currents, is found as
IC3 = IC5 = VZ −3VBE(npn)
R3 + R2 + R1
=
6.3 −3(0.6)
0.576 + 3.4 + 3.9 = 0.571 mA
The temperature-compensated portion of the reference voltage, which is the input to
the base of Q7, is
VB7 = IC3R1 + 2VBE(npn) = (0.571)(3.9) + 2(0.6) = 3.43 V
From the voltage divider network, we have

which yields
R12 = 2.97 k
Comment: The voltage divider of R12 and R13 is internal to the IC. This means the
output voltage of a voltage regulator is ﬁxed.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 15.16: Consider the voltage regulator circuit shown in Figure 15.51 with Zener
diode voltages of VZ = 5.6 V. Assume transistor parameters of VBE(npn) =
VE B(pnp) = 0.6 V, neglect base currents, and let the resistor in the emitter of Q4 be
R4 = 100 . (a) Determine the bias currents IC3 and IC4, and the temperature-
compensated portion of the reference voltage VB7. (b) Determine R12 such that
VO = 5 V. (Ans. (a) IC3 = 0.482 mA, IC4 = 0.213 mA, VB7 = 3.08 V (b) R12 =
1.39 k)
Temperature Compensation
Zener diodes with breakdown voltages greater than approximately 5 V have positive
temperature coefﬁcients, and forward-biased pn junctions have negative temperature
coefﬁcients. The magnitude of the temperature coefﬁcients in the two devices is
nearly the same.
For a given increase in temperature, VZ2 increases by V and each B–E voltage
decreases by V , which means that IC3 in Figure 15.51 increases by approximately
IC3 ∼=
4V
R1 + R2 + R3
(15.124)
The total voltage across the B–E junctions of Q1 and Q2 decreases by approximately
2V, and the change in voltage at the base of Q7 is
VB7 ∼= IC3R1 −2V = 4V

R1
R1 + R2 + R3

−2V ∼= 0
(15.125)
This indicates that the voltage divider across R1 effectively cancels any
temperature variation. The input signal to the error ampliﬁer is thus temperature
compensated.
Protection Devices
Transistors Q13 and Q14 and resistor R3 in the regulator in Figure 15.51 provide ther-
mal protection. From the results of Example 15.16, the B–E voltage of Q14 is ap-
proximately 330 mV, which means that both Q14 and Q13 are effectively cut off. As
the temperature increases, the combination of a negative B–E temperature coefﬁcient
and an increase in IC3 causes Q14 to begin conducting, which in turn causes Q13 to
conduct. The current in Q13 shunts current away from the output series-pass transis-
tors and produces thermal shutdown.
Output current limiting is provided by transistor Q12 and resistor R11, as we saw
previously in op-amp output stages. The combination of resistors R14 and R15 and
diodes D3 and D4 produces what is called a foldback characteristic. The vast ma-
jority of the power dissipated in the regulator is usually due to the output current, or
PD ∼= (V + −VO)IO
(15.126)

1122
Part 2
Analog Electronics
The output current limit, to prevent power dissipation from reaching its maximum
value PD(max), is given by
IO(max) = PD(max)
V + −VO
(15.127)
A current-limiting characteristic of the type described by Equation (15.127) will pro-
tect the regulator and allow the maximum output current possible. This type of cur-
rent limiting is called foldback current limiting.
Three-Terminal Regulator
The three-terminal voltage regulator is designed with an output voltage set at a pre-
determined value; external feedback elements and connections are not required.
Figure 15.52 shows the basic circuit conﬁguration of a three-terminal regulator. In
some applications, capacitors may be inserted across the input and output terminals.
The lead inductance between the voltage supply and regulator may cause stability
problems. The capacitor across the input terminals is used only if the power supply
and regulator are separated by a few centimeters. The load capacitor may improve the
response of the regulator to transient changes in load current.

cent of the design speciﬁcation, the bandwidth is within 0.53 percent of the design
speciﬁcation, and the maximum gain is within 2.6 percent of the design speciﬁcation.

15.8 SUMMARY
•
This chapter has presented several applications of op-amps and comparators that
may be fabricated as integrated circuits.
•
An active ﬁlter uses an active device, such as an op-amp, so as to minimize the
effect of loading on the frequency characteristics of the ﬁlter. As an example of
an active ﬁlter, Butterworth ﬁlter design was considered.
•
A switched-capacitor ﬁlter offers the advantage of an all-IC conﬁguration, since
this ﬁlter uses small capacitance values in conjunction with MOS switching
transistors that simulate large resistance values.
•
The basic principles of oscillation are: (1) the net phase through the ampliﬁer
and feedback network must be zero and (2) the magnitude of loop gain must be
unity. For an oscillator to function, the loop gain of a feedback network must
provide sufﬁcient phase shift to produce positive feedback. A phase-shift oscil-
lator, Wien-bridge oscillator, and discrete transistor oscillators were considered.
•
A comparator is essentially an op-amp operated in an open-loop conﬁguration.
The output signal is either a high or low saturated voltage.
•
A Schmitt trigger uses a comparator with positive feedback, which produces a
hysteresis in the voltage transfer characteristics. This circuit, with its hysteresis
characteristic, can eliminate the chatter effect in an output signal during switch-
ing applications in which noise is superimposed on the input signal. Astable and
monostable multivibrators were considered.
•
Examples of IC power ampliﬁers and voltage regulators were analyzed.
•
As an application, an active bandpass ﬁlter to meet a set of speciﬁcations was
designed.

Prologue to Digital
Electronics
PREVIEW 
Several basic digital electronics concepts are common to the remaining chapters of
this text. These principles, which are usually covered in an introductory course in
computer logic design, are reviewed brieﬂy in this prologue.
In a digital system, information is represented solely in discrete or quantized
form. Normally, only two discrete states are used, denoted as logic 0 and logic 1. The
algebra applicable to the binary system was invented by George Boole (1815–1864)
and is known as Boolean algebra. We do not use Boolean algebra directly in this text;
however, some familiarity with it is beneﬁcial in the analysis and design of digital in-
tegrated circuits. We will be directly concerned with basic Boolean operations and
the corresponding logic gates.
Several techniques have been developed to aid in the reduction of Boolean ex-
pressions to a minimum set of variables. One common technique is the Karnaugh
map. Though not used directly in this text, this technique is helpful in designing dig-
ital systems.
LOGIC FUNCTIONS AND LOGIC GATES
The three basic logic or Boolean operations are: NOT, AND, and OR. These opera-
tions can be described using a truth table. 
The truth table and logic gate symbol for the NOT function is shown in
Figure PR3.1(a). The bar over the output variable indicates the NOT function, or the
complement. Since only two states of a variable are permitted, if A = 0, then ¯A = 1.
The small circle at the output of the logic gate indicates a logic inversion. As depicted
by the ﬁgure, this logic gate is also called an inverter.
Figure PR3.1(b) shows the truth table, logic gate symbol, and Boolean expres-
sion for the AND function. A logic 1 is produced at the output only when both inputs
are a logic 1; otherwise, the output is a logic 0.
The truth table, logic gate symbol, and Boolean expression for the OR operation
are shown in Figure PR3.1 (c). In this case, a logic 1 output is produced if either
A = 1 or B = 1, or if both inputs are a logic 1. 
Two other commonly used logic functions are the NAND and NOR. The NAND
function is the complement of the AND operation, and the NOR function is the com-
plement of the OR operation. The truth tables and logic gate symbols for these func-
tions are shown in Figure PR3.2. Again, the small circle at the output of each logic
gate indicates a logic inversion. 
Finally, two additional logic functions useful in digital design are the exclu-
sive-OR function and the exclusive-NOR function. Although these logic functions
can be derived from a combination of the basic functions, they have their own logic
1141

1142
Prologue III Prologue to Digital Electronics
gate symbols. The truth tables, logic gate symbols, and Boolean expressions for
these operations are shown in Figure PR3.3. In the exclusive-OR operation, the
output becomes a logic 1 when either A = 1 or B = 1, but not when both are a
logic 1. The output of the exclusive-NOR is the complement of the exclusive-OR
function. 
In the following sections of this prologue, we brieﬂy describe the basic logic
functions and logic gates with two input variables, although more than two are
possible. In practice, the number of input variables is generally limited to a maxi-
mum of four because of transistor size and input capacitance effects.

LOGIC LEVELS
The logic 0 and logic 1 states in a digital circuit are represented by two distinct volt-
age values. In this text, we use positive logic, which means that the more positive
voltage represents the logic 1 state and the more negative voltage represents the
logic 0 state. The actual voltages may be either positive or negative. Figure PR3.4
shows three possible output voltage combinations that represent positive logic. The
condition represented in Figure PR3.4(a) is the most common, although we will see
examples of the conditions represented in Figure PR3.4(c). The logic 0 level shown
in Figure PR3.4(a) may actually be zero volts in some cases.

NOISE MARGIN
In an ideal digital system, logic 1 would be represented by a well-deﬁned voltage
level VO H and logic 0 would be represented by a well-deﬁned voltage level VOL. In
actual digital systems, however, the voltage values representing the two logic states
may change as a result of any number of factors, including variations in temperature,
circuit fabrication tolerances, loading effects, and noise.
At the input to a digital circuit, a range of voltages can represent each of the two
binary states as illustrated in Figure PR3.5. The amplitude levels that pass through a

shown in the ﬁgure. We consider noise margins in more detail in the next two chap-
ters when we analyze speciﬁc circuits.
PROPAGATION DELAY TIMES 
AND SWITCHING TIMES
The switching characteristics of logic gates are generally described by propagation
delay times. Standard deﬁnitions of digital circuit delay times are illustrated in Fig-
ure PR3.6. Propagation delay times from input to output, denoted τP H L and τPL H, are
deﬁned between the 50 percent points of the input and output pulse waveforms.
In addition, high-to-low and low-to-high transition times at the output of a logic
gate are deﬁned as the times between the 10 and 90 percent points and are denoted
τH L and τL H.

Part 2 of the text dealt with analog electronic circuits. Part 3 now deals with digital
electronics, another important category of electronics.
Chapter 16 examines ﬁeld-effect transistor digital circuits. MOSFET digital cir-
cuits have revolutionized digital electronics, with CMOS technology producing
high-density, low-power digital circuits. Initially, we brieﬂy consider the NMOS
inverter and NMOS logic gates. We then analyze the basic CMOS inverter and then
develop CMOS logic gates. Finally, we analyze FET shift registers and ﬂip-ﬂops and
then discuss some basic A/D and D/A converters.
Bipolar digital circuits are considered in Chapter 17. We initially examine
emitter-coupled logic, which is primarily used in specialized high-speed applica-
tions. We then brieﬂy consider the basic aspects of transistor-transistor logic (TTL),
which was the mainstay of logic design for many years. Low-power Schottky TTL
circuits are analyzed in order to obtain a good comparison between FET and bipolar
digital technologies.

This chapter presents the basic concepts of MOSFET digital integrated circuits,
which is the most widely used technology for the fabrication of digital systems. The
small transistor size and low power dissipation of CMOS circuits allows for a high
level of integration for logic and memory circuits. JFET logic circuits are very spe-
cialized and are therefore not considered here.
A discussion of NMOS logic circuits will serve as an introduction to the analy-
sis and design of digital systems. This technology, although old, deals with only one
type of transistor (n-channel) and therefore makes the analysis more straightforward
than dealing with two types of transistors in the same circuit. This discussion will
also serve as a baseline to point out advantages of CMOS technology.
Initially, we consider basic digital logic circuits such as NOR and NAND gates,
and then discuss additional logic circuits such as ﬂip ﬂops, shift registers, and adders.
Finally, we consider memories, and then A/D and D/A converters.

NMOS INVERTERS
Objective: • Analyze and design NMOS inverters.
The inverter is the basic circuit of most MOS logic circuits. The design techniques
used in NMOS logic circuits are developed from the dc analysis results for the
NMOS inverter. Extending the concepts developed from the inverter to NOR and
NAND gates is then direct. Alternative inverter load elements are compared in terms
of power consumption, packing density, and transfer characteristics.
n-Channel MOSFET Revisited
We studied the structure, operation, and characteristics of MOS transistors in
Chapter 3. In this section, we will quickly review the n-channel MOSFET character-
istics, emphasizing speciﬁc properties important in digital circuit design.
The simpliﬁed n-channel MOSFET that we have considered is shown in Figure
16.1(a). A more detailed view of the n-channel MOSFET is shown in Figure 16.1(b).
The active transistor region is the surface of the semiconductor and comprises heav-
ily doped n source and drain regions and the p-type channel region. The channel
length is L and the channel width is W. The body, or substrate, is a single-crystal sil-
icon wafer, which is the starting material for circuit fabrication and provides physi-
cal support for the integrated circuit.
In an integrated circuit, all n-channel transistors are fabricated in the same 
p-type substrate material. The substrate is connected to the most negative potential in
the circuit, which for digital circuits is normally at ground potential or zero volts.
However, the source terminal of many transistors will not be at zero volts, which
means that a reverse-biased pn junction will exist between the source and substrate.
When the source and body terminals are not at the same potential, the threshold volt-
age of the transistor becomes a function of the source-to-body voltage. This body
effect must then be taken into account in determining logic levels in digital circuits.

Current–Voltage Relation
The current–voltage characteristics of the n-channel MOSFET are functions of both
the electrical and geometric properties of the device. When the transistor is biased in
the nonsaturation region, for vGS ≥VT N and vDS ≤(vGS −VT N), we can write
iD = Kn

2(vGS −VT N)vDS −v2
DS

(16.1(a))
In the saturation region, for vGS ≥VT N and vDS ≥(vGS −VT N), we have
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2
(16.1(b))
The transition point separates the nonsaturation and saturation regions and is the
drain-to-source saturation voltage, which is given by
vDS = vDS(sat) = vGS −VT N
(16.2)
The term (1 + λvDS) is sometimes included in Equation (16.1(b)) to account for
channel length modulation and the ﬁnite output resistance. In most cases, it has little
effect on the operating characteristics of MOS digital circuits. In our analysis, the
term λ is assumed to be zero unless otherwise stated.
The parameter Kn is the NMOS transistor conduction parameter and is given by
Kn =

(16.3)
The electron mobility μn and oxide capacitance Cox are assumed to be constant for
all devices in a particular IC.
The current–voltage characteristics are directly related to the channel width-to-
length ratio, or the size of the transistor. In general, in a given IC, the length L is
ﬁxed, but the designer can control the channel width W.
Since the MOS transistor is a majority carrier device, the switching speed of
MOS digital circuits is limited by the time required to charge and discharge the ca-
pacitances between device electrodes and between interconnect lines and ground.
Figure 16.2 shows the signiﬁcant capacitances in a MOSFET. The capacitances Csb
and Cdb are the source-to-body and drain-to-body n+p junction capacitances. The
total input gate capacitance, to a ﬁrst approximation, is a constant equal to

ness. The parameter Cox also appears in the expression for the conduction parameter.

Small Geometry Effects
The current–voltage relationships given by Equations (16.1(a)), (16.1(b)), and (16.2)
are ﬁrst-order approximations that apply to “long” channel devices. The tendency in
device design is to make the devices as small as possible, which means the channel
length is being reduced to values substantially smaller than 1 μm. The corresponding
channel widths are also being reduced. As the channel length is reduced, several ef-
fects alter the current–voltage characteristics. First, the threshold voltage becomes a
function of the geometry of the device and is dependent on the channel length. This
effect must be taken into account in the design of the transistor. Second, carrier
velocity saturation reduces the saturation-mode current below the current value pre-
dicted by Equation (16.1(b)). The current is no longer a quadratic function of gate-
to-source voltage, and tends to become a linear function of voltage. Channel length
modulation means that the current tends to be larger than that predicted by the ideal
equation. Third, the electron mobility is a function of the gate voltage so that the cur-
rent tends to be smaller than the predicted value as the gate-to-source voltage in-
creases. All of these effects complicate the analysis considerably.
We can, however, determine the basic operation and behavior of MOSFET logic
circuits by using the ﬁrst-order equations. We will use these ﬁrst-order equations in
our design of logic circuits. To determine the effect of small device size, a computer
simulation may be performed in which the appropriate device models are incorpo-
rated in the simulation.
NMOS Inverter Transfer Characteristics
Since the inverter is the basis for most logic circuits, we will describe the NMOS
inverter and will develop the dc transfer characteristics for three types of inverters
with different load devices. This discussion will introduce voltage transfer functions
and will deﬁne the maximum and minimum logic levels.
NMOS Inverter with Resistor Load
Figure 16.3(a) shows a single NMOS transistor connected to a resistor to form an
inverter. The transistor characteristics and load line are shown in Figure 16.3(b),
along with the parametric curve separating the saturation and nonsaturation regions.
We determine the voltage transfer characteristics of the inverter by examining the
various regions in which the transistor can be biased.
When the input voltage is less than or equal to the threshold voltage, or
vI ≤VT N , the transistor is cut off, iD = 0, and the output voltage is vO = VDD. The
maximum output voltage is deﬁned as the logic 1 level. As the input voltage becomes

just greater than VT N, the transistor turns on and is biased in the saturation region.
The output voltage is then
vO = VDD −iD RD
(16.5)
where the drain current is given by
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2 = Kn(vI −VT N)2
(16.6)
Combining Equations (16.5) and (16.6) yields
vO = VDD −Kn RD(vI −VT N)2
(16.7)
which relates the output and input voltages as long as the transistor is biased in the
saturation region.
As the input voltage increases, the Q-point of the transistor moves up the load
line. At the transition point, we have
VOt = VIt −VT N
(16.8)
where VOt and VIt are the drain-to-source and gate-to-source voltages, respectively,
at the transition point. Substituting Equation (16.8) into (16.7), we determine the
input voltage at the transition point from
Kn RD(VIt −VT N)2 + (VIt −VT N) −VDD = 0
(16.9)
As the input voltage becomes greater than VIt, the Q-point continues to move up
the load line, and the transistor becomes biased in the nonsaturation region. The drain
current is then

saturation and nonsaturation bias regions of the transistor. The ﬁgure shows that
the minimum output voltage, or the logic 0 level, for a high input decreases with in-
creasing load resistance, and the sharpness of the transition region between a low
input and a high input increases with increasing load resistance.
It should be noted that a large resistance is difficult to fabricate in an IC. A
large resistor value in the inverter will limit current and power consumption as
well as provide a small VOL value. But it would also require a large chip area if
fabricated in a standard MOS process. To avoid this problem MOS transistors
can be used as load devices, replacing the resistor, as discussed in subsequent
paragraphs.
EXAMPLE 16.1
Objective: Determine the transition point, minimum output voltage, maximum
drain current, and maximum power dissipation of an NMOS inverter with resistor
load.
Speciﬁcations: Consider the circuit in Figure 16.3(a) with parameters VDD = 2.5 V
and RD = 20 k. The transistor parameters are VT N = 0.5 V and Kn = 0.3 mA/V2.
Solution: The input voltage at the transition point is found from Equation (16.9).
We have
(0.3)(25)(VIt −0.5)2 + (VIt −0.5) −2.5 = 0
which yields
VIt −0.5 = 0.515 V
or
VIt = 1.015 V
The output voltage at the transition point is
VO t = VIt −VT N = 1.015 −0.5 = 0.515 V
When vI is high at vI = 2.5 V, the output voltage is found from Equation (16.11).
We ﬁnd
vO = 2.5 −(0.3(25)[2(2.5 −0.5)vO −v2
O]
which yields the output low level as
vO = VOL = 82.3 mV
The maximum drain current in the inverter occurs when vO = VOL and is found to be
iD,max = 2.5 −0.0823
25
⇒96.7 μA
The maximum power dissipated in the inverter is 
PD,max = iD,max · VDD = (0.0967)(2.5) = 0.242 mW
Comment: The level of VOL is less than the threshold voltage VT N; therefore, if
the output of this inverter is used to drive a similar inverter, the driver transistor of the
load inverter would be cut off and its output would be high, which is the desired
condition. We will compare the maximum drain currents and maximum power dissi-
pations of the three basic NMOS inverters.

Figure 16.5 (a) NMOS inverter with saturated load and (b) driver transistor characteristics
and load curve
An n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET with the gate connected to the drain can
be used as a load device in an NMOS inverter. This device conﬁguration was ana-
lyzed in Chapter 3. We found that, when vGS = vDS ≥VT N , the transistor always
operates in the saturation region. The drain current is given by
iD = Kn(vGS −VT N)2 = Kn(vDS −VT N)2
(16.12)
We continue to neglect the effect of the output resistance and the λ parameter.
Figure 16.5(a) shows an NMOS inverter with the enhancement load device. The
driver transistor parameters are denoted by VT N D and K D, and the load transistor pa-
rameters are denoted by VT N L and KL. The substrate connections are not shown. In
the following analysis, we neglect the body effect and we assume all threshold volt-
ages are constant. These assumptions do not seriously affect the basic analysis, nor
the inverter characteristics.
The driver transistor characteristics and the load curve are shown in Figure 16.5(b).
When the inverter input voltage is less than the driver threshold voltage, the driver is
cut off and the drain currents are zero. From Equation (16.12), we have
iDL = 0 = KL(vDSL −VT N L)2
(16.13)

1154
Part 3
Digital Electronics
From Figure 16.5(a), we see that vDSL = VDD −vO, which means that
vDSL −VT N L = VDD −vO −VT N L = 0
(16.14(a))
The maximum output voltage is then
vO,max ≡VO H = VDD −VT N L
(16.14(b))
For the enhancement-load NMOS inverter, the maximum output voltage, which is
the logic 1 level, does not reach the full VDD value. This cutoff point is shown in the
load curve in Figure 16.5(b).
As the input voltage becomes just greater than the driver threshold voltage
VT N D, the driver transistor turns on and is biased in the saturation region. In
steady-state, the two drain currents are equal since the output will be connected to the
gates of other MOS transistors. We have iDD = iDL, which can be written as
K D(vGSD −VT N D)2 = KL(vGSL −VT N L)2
(16.15)
Equation (16.15) is expressed in terms of the individual transistor parameters. In
terms of the input and output voltages, the expression becomes
K D(vI −VT N D)2 = KL(VDD −vO −VT N L)2
(16.16)
Solving for the output voltage yields
vO = VDD −VT N L −

K D
KL
(vI −VT N D)
(16.17)
As the input voltage increases, the driver Q-point moves up the load curve and
the output voltage decreases linearly with vI .
At the driver transition point, we have
vDSD(sat) = vGSD −VT N D
or
VOt = VIt −VT N D
(16.18)
Substituting Equation (16.18) into (16.17), we ﬁnd the input voltage at the transition

(16.19)
As the input voltage becomes greater than VIt, the driver transistor Q-point con-
tinues to move up the load curve and the driver becomes biased in the nonsaturation
region. Since the driver and load drain currents are still equal, or iDD = iDL, we now
have

Figure 16.6 Voltage transfer characteristics of NMOS inverter with saturated
load, using parameters from Example 16.2 and for three aspect ratios.
Figure 16.6 shows the voltage transfer characteristics of this inverter for three
K D-to-KL ratios. The ratio K D/KL is the aspect ratio and is related to the width-to-
length parameters of the driver and load transistors.
The line, given by Equation (16.18), separating the driver saturation and nonsat-
uration regions is also shown in the ﬁgure. We see that the minimum output voltage,
or the logic 0 level, for a high input decreases with an increasing K D/KL ratio. As
the width-to-length ratio of the load transistor decreases, the effective resistance
increases, which means that the general behavior of the transfer characteristics is
the same as for the resistor load. However, the high output voltage is
VO H = VDD −VT N L
When the driver is biased in the saturation region, we ﬁnd the slope of the trans-
fer curve, which is the inverter gain, by taking the derivative of Equation (16.17)
with respect to vI . We see that
dvO/dvI = −

K D/KL
When the aspect ratio is greater than unity, the inverter gain magnitude is greater than
unity. A logic circuit family with an inverter transfer curve that exhibits a gain greater
than unity for some region is called a restoring logic family. Restoring logic is so
named because logic signals that are degraded for some reason in one circuit can be
restored by the gain of subsequent logic circuits.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 16.2
Objective: Design an NMOS inverter to meet a set of speciﬁcations and determine
the power dissipation in the inverter.
Speciﬁcations: The NMOS inverter with saturated load shown in Figure 16.5(a) is
to be designed such that vO = 0.1 V when vI = 2.0 V. The circuit is biased at
VDD = 2.5 V. (Neglect the body effect.)

Choices: Transistors are available with parameters VT N = 0.5 V and k′

Solution: The maximum output voltage (deﬁned as a logic 1), neglecting the body
effect, is
VO H = VDD −VT N L = 2.5 −0.5 = 2.0 V
For vI = 2.0 V, the driver is biased in the nonsaturation region and the load is al-
ways biased in the saturation region. Setting the two drain currents equal to each
other, we ﬁnd, using Equation (16.21),
K D[2(2.0 −0.5)(0.1) −(0.1)2] = KL(2.5 −0.1 −0.5)2

PD,max = iD,max · VDD = (0.18)(2.5) = 0.45 mW
Comment: In the NMOS inverter with enhancement-mode load, a relatively large
difference in sizes of the driver and load transistors is required to produce a relatively
low output voltage VOL. The load transistor width-to-length ratio cannot be reduced
substantially, so the maximum power dissipation cannot be substantially reduced
from the 0.45 mW.

NMOS Inverter with Depletion Load
Depletion-mode MOSFETs can also be used as load elements in NMOS inverters.
Figure 16.7(a) shows the NMOS inverter with depletion load. The gate and source
of the depletion-mode transistor are connected together. The driver transistor is
still an enhancement-mode device. As before, the driver transistor parameters are
VT N D(VT N D > 0) and K D, and the load transistor parameters are VT N L(VT N L < 0)
and KL. Again, the substrate connections are not shown. The fabrication process
for this inverter is slightly more complicated than for the enhancement-load in-
verter, since the threshold voltages of the two devices are not equal. However, as
we will see, the advantages of this inverter make the extra processing steps worth-
while. This inverter has been the basis of many microprocessor and static memory
designs.
The current–voltage characteristic curve for the depletion load, neglecting the
body effect, is shown in Figure 16.7(b). Since the gate is connected to the source,
vGSL = 0, and the Q-point of the load is on this particular curve.
The driver transistor characteristics and the ideal load curve are shown in
Figure 16.7(c). When the inverter input is less than the driver threshold voltage, the
driver is cut off and the drain currents are zero. From Figure 16.7(b), we see that for

iD = 0, the drain-to-source voltage of the load transistor must be zero; therefore,
vO = VDD for vI ≤VT N D. An advantage of the depletion-load inverter over the
enhancement-load inverter is that the high output voltage, or the logic 1 level, is at
the full VDD value.
As the input voltage becomes just greater than the driver threshold voltage
VT N D, the driver turns on and is biased in the saturation region; however, the load is
biased in the nonsaturation region. The Q-point lies between points A and B on the
load curve shown in Figure 16.7(c). We again set the two drain currents equal, or
iDD = iDL, which means that
K D[vGSD −VT N D]2 = KL

(16.22)
Writing Equation (16.22) in terms of the input and output voltages yields
K D[vI −VT N D]2 = KL[2(−VT N L)(VDD −vO) −(VDD −vO)2]
(16.23)
This equation relates the input and output voltages as long as the driver is biased in
the saturation region and the load is biased in the nonsaturation region.
There are two transition points for the NMOS inverter with a depletion load:
one for the load and one for the driver. These are points B and C, respectively, in
Figure 16.7(c). The transition point for the load is given by
vDSL = VDD −VOt = vGSL −VT N L = −VT N L
(16.24(a))
or
VOt = VDD + VT N L
(16.24(b))
Since VT N L is negative, the output voltage at the transition point is less than VDD.
The transition point for the driver is given by
vDSD = vGSD −VT N D
or
VOt = VIt −VT N D
(16.25)
When the Q-point lies between points B and C on the load curve, both devices
are biased in the saturation region, and
K D(vGSD −VT N D)2 = KL(vGSL −VT N L)2
(16.26(a))
or

K D

(vI −VT N D) = −VT N L

Equation (16.26(b)) demonstrates that the input voltage is a constant as the Q-point
passes through this region. This effect is also shown in Figure 16.7(c); the load curve
between points B and C lies on a constant vGSD curve. (This characteristic will
change when the body effect is taken into account.)
For an input voltage greater than the value given by Equation (16.26(b)), the dri-
ver is biased in the nonsaturation region while the load is biased in the saturation re-
gion. The Q-point is now between points C and D on the load curve in Figure 16.7(c).

This equation implies that the relationship between the input and output voltages are
not linear in this region.
Figure 16.8 shows the voltage transfer characteristics of this inverter for three
values of K D/KL. Also shown are the loci of transition points for the load and driver
transistors as given by Equations (16.24(b)) and (16.25), respectively.
DESIGN EXAMPLE 16.3
Objective: Design an NMOS inverter to meet a set of speciﬁcations and determine
the power dissipation in the inverter.
Speciﬁcations: The NMOS inverter with depletion load shown in Figure 16.7(a) is
to be designed such that vO = VOL = 0.10 V when vI = 2.5 V. The circuit is biased
at VDD = 2.5 V. (Neglect the body effect.)
Choices: Transistors are available with process conduction parameters of
k′
n = 100 μA/V2. The driver transistor threshold voltage is VT N D = 0.5 V and the
load transistor threshold voltage is VT N L = −1 V.
Solution: For vI = 2.5 V, the driver transistor is biased in the nonsaturation region
and the load transistor is biased in the saturation region. Using Equation (16.27(b),
we ﬁnd
K D[2(2.5 −0.5)(0.1) −(0.1)2] = KL[0 −(−1)]2

The maximum power dissipation in the inverter is

Comment: A relatively low output voltage VOL can be produced in the NMOS
inverter with depletion load, even when the load and driver transistors are not vastly
different in size. The power dissipation in this inverter is also substantially less than
in the enhancement-load inverter since the aspect ratio is smaller.
Design Consideration: The static analysis of the three types of NMOS inverters
clearly demonstrates the advantage of the depletion load inverter. The size of the dri-
ver transistor is smaller for a given load device size to produce a given low output
state. This allows a greater number of inverters to be fabricated in a given chip area.
In addition, since the power dissipation is less, more inverters can be fabricated on a
chip for a given total power dissipation.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.3: The depletion-load NMOS inverter shown in Figure 16.7(a) is biased at
VDD = 3 V. The transistor parameters are k′
n = 100 μA/V2, VT N D = 0.4 V,
VT N L = −0.8 V, (W/L)D = 6, and (W/L)L = 2. (a) Determine vO for vI = 3 V.

sistors. (Ans. (a) vO = 0.0414 V; (b) iD,max = 0.064 mA, PD,max = 0.192 mW; 
(c) driver: VI t = 0.862 V, VO t = 0.462 V; load: VI t = 0.862 V, VO t = 2.2 V)

NMOS inverters with the substrates of all transistors tied to ground. A nonzero
source-to-body voltage will then exist in the load devices. In fact, the source terminal
of the depletion load can increase to VDD. The threshold voltage equation, including
the body effect, must be used in the circuit calculations for the load transistor. This
signiﬁcantly complicates the equations for the voltage transfer calculations, making
them very cumbersome for hand analyses.
EXAMPLE 16.4
Objective: Determine the change in the high output voltage of an NMOS inverter
with enhancement load, taking the body effect into account.
Consider the NMOS inverter with enhancement load in Figure 16.9(a). The tran-
sistor parameters are VT N DO = VT N LO = 0.5 V and K D/KL = 16. Assume the in-
verter is biased at VDD = 2.5 V, assume the body effect coefﬁcient is γ = 0.5 V1/2,
and let φf p = 0.365 V.
Solution: When vI < VT N DO, the driver is cut off and the output goes high. From
Equation (16.14(b)), the maximum output voltage is
vO,max = VO H = VDD −VT N L
where VT N L is given by
VT N L = VT N LO + γ
	
2φf p + VSB −

2φf p

From Figure 16.9(a), we see that VSB = vO. Therefore, Equation (16.14(b)) can
be written as
vO,max = VDD −

VT N LO + γ
	
2φf p + vO,max −

2φf p


Deﬁning vO,max ≡VO H , we have
VO H −2.427 = −0.5

0.73 + VO H
Squaring both sides and rearranging terms yields
V 2
O H −5.1044VO H + 5.7088 = 0
Consequently, the maximum output voltage, or the logic 1 level, is
VO H = 1.655 V
Comment: Neglecting the body effect, the logic 1 output level is
VO H = VDD −VT N LO = 2.5 −0.5 = 2.0 V
The body effect, then, can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the logic high state of the NMOS
inverter with enhancement load. These results also impact the inverter noise margins.
The source and body terminals of the depletion load device in the NMOS in-
verter shown in Figure 16.9(b) are not at the same potential when the output goes
high. However, when the driver is cut off, the drain-to-source voltage of the depletion
device must be zero in order that vO,max = VO H = VDD.
Computer Simulation: A computer analysis of the inverters in Figure 16.9 was
performed, neglecting the body effect and taking the body effect into account. The
parameters are VDD = 5 V, VT N DO = 0.8 V for the driver transistors, VT N LO = 0.8 V

1162
Part 3
Digital Electronics
for the saturated load transistor, and VT N LO = −2 V for the depletion load transistor.
The body effect coefﬁcient was assumed to be γ = 0.9 V1/2.
The body effect changes the voltage transfer characteristics of both the enhance-
ment load and depletion load inverters. Figure 16.10(a) shows the voltage transfer
characteristics for the enhancement load inverter. For vI = 0, the output voltage is
3.15 V when the body effect is taken into account. This compares to 4.2 V when the
body effect is neglected.
Figure 16.10(b) shows the voltage transfer characteristics for the depletion load
inverter. The output voltage is 5 V in the high state, which is independent of the body
effect. However, the characteristics during the transition region are a function of the
body effect.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.4: Repeat Example 16.4 for the case when the body effect coefﬁcient is
γ = 0.3 V1/2. (Ans. VO H = 1.781 V)

NMOS LOGIC CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze and design NMOS logic gates.
NMOS logic circuits are formed by combining driver transistors in parallel, series, or
series–parallel combinations to produce a desired output logic function.
NMOS NOR and NAND Gates
The NMOS NOR logic gate contains additional driver transistors connected in
parallel. Figure 16.11 shows a two-input NMOS NOR logic gate with a depletion
load. If A = B = logic 0, then both MDA and MDB are cut off and vO = VDD. If
A = logic 1 and B = logic 0, then MDB is cut off and the NMOS inverter conﬁgura-
tion with ML and MDA is the same as previously considered, and the output voltage
goes low. Similarly, if A = logic 0 and B = logic 1, we again have the same inverter
conﬁguration.
If A = B = logic 1, then both MDA and MDB turn on and the two driver tran-
sistors are effectively in parallel. The value of the output voltage now changes
slightly. Figure 16.12 shows the NOR gate when both input voltages are a logic 1.
From our previous analysis, we can assume that the two driver transistors are biased

output voltage becomes slightly smaller when both inputs are high.

Objective: Determine the low output voltage of an NMOS NOR circuit.

Solution: If, for example, A = logic 1 = 2.5 V and B = logic 0, then MDA is biased

Comment: An NMOS NOR gate must be designed to achieve a speciﬁed VOL out-
put voltage when only one input is high. This will give the largest logic 0 value.
When more than one input is high, the output voltage is smaller than the speciﬁed
VOL value, since the effective width-to-length ratio of the composite driver transistor
increases.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.5: Consider the two-input NMOS NOR logic gate shown in Figure 16.11. Let
VDD = 1.8 V. Assume transistor parameters of k′
n = 100 μA/V2, VT N D = 0.4 V,
VT N L = −0.6 V, (W/L)D = 5, and (W/L)L = 1. Neglect the body effect.
(a) Determine VOL when: (i) A = logic 1, B = logic 0, and (ii) A = B = logic 1.
(b) Calculate the power dissipation in the circuit for the input condition given
in part (a). (Ans. (a) (i) vO = 26 mV, (ii) vO = 12.9 mV; (b) For (i) and (ii),
P = 32.4 μW)
The NMOS NAND logic gate contains additional driver transistors connected in
series. Figure 16.13 shows a two-input NMOS NAND logic gate with a depletion
load. If both A = B = logic 0, or if either A or B is a logic 0, at least one driver is cut
off, and the output is high. If both A = B = logic 1, then the composite driver of the
NMOS inverter conducts and the output goes low.
Since the gate-to-source voltages of MDA and MDB are not equal, determining
the actual voltage VOL of a NAND gate is difﬁcult. The drain-to-source voltages of
MDA and MDB must adjust themselves to produce the same current. In addition, if
the body effect is also included, the analysis becomes even more difﬁcult. Since the
two driver transistors are in series, a good approximation assumes that the width-to-
length ratio of the drivers must be twice that of a single driver in an NMOS inverter
to achieve a given VOL value.
The composite width-to-length ratios of the driver transistors in the two-input
NMOS NOR and NAND gates are shown schematically in Figure 16.14. For the
NOR gate, the effective width doubles; for the NAND gates, the effective length
doubles.

(W/L)D = 8, and (W/L)L = 1. Neglect the body effect.
Solution: If either A or B is a logic 0, then vO = logic 1 = 2.5 V.
If A = B = logic 1 = 2.5 V, then both driver transistors are driven in the non-
saturation region and the output goes low. As a good approximation, we will assume
the effective length of the driver transistor doubles. Then, using Equation (16.27(b)),

The output voltage is found to be vO = 21.5 mV.
This output voltage is the same value that would be obtained for a simple
inverter with (W/L)D = 4 and (W/L)L = 1.
Comment: If an N-input NMOS NAND logic gate were to be fabricated then the
width-to-length ratio of the drivers would need to be N times that of a single driver in
an NMOS inverter to achieve a given value of VOL. The increase in the required area
of the driver transistors in a NAND logic gate means that logic gates with more than
three or four inputs are not attractive.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.6: Repeat Example 16.6 for a three-input NMOS NAND logic gate with
depletion load with (W/L)L = 1 and (a) (W/L)D = 12 and (b) (W/L)D = 4.
(Ans. (a) vO = 21.5 mV, (b) vO = 65.3 mV)
NMOS Logic Circuits
The series–parallel combination of drivers can be expanded to synthesize more com-
plex logic functions. Consider the circuit in Figure 16.15. We can show that the
Boolean output function is
f = (A · B + C)
Also, the individual transistor width-to-length ratios shown produce an effective
K D/KL ratio of 4 for an effective single inverter when only MDA and MDB are con-
ducting, or only MDC is conducting. The actual complexity of the Boolean function
is limited since the required width-to-length ratios of individual transistors may be-
come unreasonably large.
Two additional logic functions are the exclusive-OR and exclusive-NOR.
Figure 16.16 shows a circuit conﬁguration that produces the exclusive-OR function.

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits

If A = B = logic 1, a path exists from the output to ground through drivers MDA and
MDB, and the output goes low. Similarly, if A = B = logic 0, which means that
¯A = ¯B = logic 1, a path exists from the output to ground through the drivers MD ¯B
and MD ¯A, and the output again goes low. For all other input logic signal combina-
tions, the output is isolated from ground so the output goes high.
Fanout
An NMOS inverter or NMOS logic gate must be capable of driving more than one
load, as shown in Figure 16.17. It is assumed that each load is identical to the driver
logic circuit. The number of identical-load circuits connected to the output of a dri-
ver logic circuit is deﬁned as the fanout. For MOS logic circuits, the inputs to the
load circuits are the oxide-insulated gates of the MOS transistors; therefore, the static
loading caused by multiple driver loads is so small that the dc transfer curve is
essentially identical to a no-load condition. The dc characteristics of MOS logic
circuits are unaffected by the fanout to other MOS logic inputs. However, the load
capacitance due to a large fanout seriously degrades the switching speed and propa-
gation delay times. Consequently, maintaining the propagation delay time below a
speciﬁed maximum value determines the fanout of MOS digital circuits.

CMOS INVERTER
Objective: • Analyze and design CMOS inverters.
Complementary MOS, or CMOS, circuits contain both n-channel and p-channel
MOSFETs. As we will see, the power dissipation in CMOS logic circuits is much
smaller than in NMOS circuits, which makes CMOS very attractive. We brieﬂy re-
view the characteristics of p-channel transistors, and will then analyze the CMOS in-
verter, which is the basis of most CMOS logic circuits. We will examine the CMOS
NOR and NAND gates and other basic CMOS logic circuits, covering power dissi-
pation, noise margin, fanout, and switching characteristics.
p-Channel MOSFET Revisited
Figure 16.20 shows a simpliﬁed view of a p-channel MOSFET. The p- and n-regions
are reversed from those in an n-channel device. Again, the channel length is L and the
channel width is W. Usually in any given fabrication process, the channel length is
the same for all devices, so the channel width W is the variable in logic circuit design.
Normally, in an integrated circuit, more than one p-channel device will be fabri-
cated in the same n-substrate so the p-channel transistors will exhibit a body effect.
The n-substrate is connected to the most positive potential. The source terminal may

The parameter Nd is the n-substrate doping concentration and φf n is a potential re-
lated to the substrate doping. The parameter γ is the body effect coefﬁcient.
Current–Voltage Relation
The current–voltage characteristics of the p-channel MOSFET are functions of both
the electrical and geometric properties of the device. When the transistor is biased in
the nonsaturation region, we have vSD ≤vSG + VT P. Therefore,
iD = Kp

(16.31(a))
In the saturation region, we have vSD ≥vSG + VT P, which means that
iD = Kp(vSG + VT P)2
(16.31(b))
The gate potential is negative with respect to the source. For the p-channel
transistor to conduct, we must have vGS < VT P, where VT P is negative for an
enhancement-mode device. We also see that vSG > |VT P| when the p-channel device
is conducting.
In most cases, the channel length modulation factor λ has very little effect on the
operating characteristics of MOS digital circuits. Therefore, the term λ is assumed to
be zero unless otherwise stated.
The transition point, which separates the nonsaturation and saturation bias
regions, is given by
vSD = vSD(sat) = vSG + VT P

As before, the hole mobility μp and oxide capacitance Cox are assumed to be
constant for all devices. The hole mobility in p-channel silicon MOSFETs is approx-
imately one-half the electron mobility μn in n-channel silicon MOSFETs. This
means that a p-channel device width must be approximately twice as large as that of
an n-channel device in order that the two devices be electrically equivalent (that is,
that they have the same conduction parameter values).
Small Geometry Effects
The same small geometry effects apply to the p-channel devices as we discussed for
the n-channel devices in Section 16.1.1. As with the NMOS inverters and logic cir-
cuits, we can use Equations (16.31(a)), (16.31(b)), and (16.32) as ﬁrst-order equa-
tions in the design of CMOS logic circuits. The basic operation and behavior of
CMOS logic circuits can be predicted using these ﬁrst-order equations.
DC Analysis of the CMOS Inverter
The CMOS inverter, shown in Figure 16.21, is a series combination of a p-channel
and an n-channel MOSFET. The gates of the two MOSFETs are connected together
to form the input and the two drains are connected together to form the output. Both
transistors are enhancement-mode devices. The parameters of the NMOS are de-
noted by Kn and VT N, where VT N > 0, and the parameters of the PMOS are denoted
by Kp and VT P, where VT P < 0.

Figure 16.22 shows a simpliﬁed cross section of a CMOS inverter. In this
process, a separate p-well region is formed within the starting n-substrate. The
n-channel device is fabricated in the p-well region and the p-channel device is
fabricated in the n-substrate. Although other approaches, such as an n-well in a
p-substrate, are also used to fabricate CMOS circuits, the important point is that
the processing is more complicated for CMOS circuits than for NMOS circuits.

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits

However, the advantages of CMOS digital logic circuits over NMOS circuits justify
their use.
Voltage Transfer Curve
Figure 16.23 shows the transistor characteristics for both the n- and p-channel de-
vices. We can determine the voltage transfer characteristics of the inverter by evalu-
ating the various transistor bias regions. For vI = 0, the NMOS device is cut off,
iDN = 0, and iDP = 0. The PMOS source-to-gate voltage is VDD, which means that
the PMOS is biased on the curve marked B in Figure 16.23(b). Since the only
point on the curve corresponding to iDP = 0 occurs at vSDP = 0 = VDD −vO, the
output voltage is vO = VDD. This condition exists as long as the NMOS transistor is
cut off, or vI ≤VT N .
For vI = VDD, the PMOS device is cut off, iDP = 0, and iDN = 0. The NMOS
gate-to-source voltage is VDD and the NMOS is biased on the curve marked A in
Figure 16.23(a). The only point on the curve corresponding to iDN = 0 occurs at
vDSN = vO = 0. The output voltage is zero as long as the PMOS transistor is cut off,
or vSGP = VDD −vI ≤|VT P|. This means that the input voltage is in the range
VDD −|VT P| ≤vI ≤VDD.

Figure 16.24 shows the voltage transfer characteristics generated thus far for
the CMOS inverter. The more positive output voltage corresponds to a logic 1,
or VO H = VDD, and the more negative output voltage corresponds to a logic 0, or
VOL = 0. When the output is in the logic 1 state, the NMOS transistor is cut off;
when the output is in the logic 0 state, the PMOS transistor is cut off.
Ideally, the current in the CMOS inverter in either steady-state condition is zero,
which means that, ideally, the quiescent power dissipation is zero. This result is the at-
tractive feature of CMOS digital circuits. In actuality, CMOS inverter circuits exhibit a
small leakage current in both steady-state conditions, due to the reverse-biased pn junc-
tions. However, the power dissipation may be in the nanowatt range rather than in the
milliwatt range of NMOS inverters. Without this feature, VLSI would not be possible.
When the input voltage is just greater than VT N, or
vI = vGSN = V +
T N
the NMOS begins to conduct and the Q-point falls on the curve marked C in 
Figure 16.23(a). The current is small and vDSN ∼= VDD, which means that the NMOS
is biased in the saturation region. The PMOS source-to-drain voltage is small, so the
PMOS is biased in the nonsaturation region. Setting iDN = iDP, we can write

Relating the gate-to-source and drain-to-source voltages in each transistor to the inverter
input and output voltages, respectively, we can rewrite Equation (16.34) as follows:

On the basis that VT P is negative for an enhancement-mode PMOS, Equa-
tions (16.37(b)) and (16.38(b)) are plotted in Figure 16.25. We determine the input
voltage at the transition points by setting the two drain currents equal to each other
when both transistors are biased in the saturation region. The result is
Kn(vGSN −VT N)2 = Kp(vSGP + VT P)2
(16.39)
With the gate-to-source voltages related to the input voltage, Equation (16.39) becomes
Kn(vI −VT N)2 = Kp(VDD −vI + VT P)2
(16.40)
For this ideal case, the output voltage does not appear in Equation (16.40), and the input
voltage is a constant, as long as the two transistors are biased in the saturation region.

Comment: The two voltage transfer curves are shown in Figure 16.27. These ﬁgures
depict another advantage of CMOS technology, that is CMOS circuits can be biased
over a relatively wide range of voltages.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.7: The CMOS inverter in Figure 16.21 is biased at VDD = 2.1 V, and the
transistor threshold voltages are VT N = −VT P = 0.4 V. Sketch the voltage trans-
fer curve and show the critical voltages as in Figure 16.26 for (a) Kn/Kp = 1,
(b) Kn/Kp = 0.5, and (c) Kn/Kp = 2. (Ans. (a) VIt = 1.05 V, VO Pt = 1.45 V,
VONt = 0.65 V; (b) VIt = 1.16 V, VO Pt = 1.56 V, VONt = 0.76 V; (c) VIt =
0.938 V, VO Pt = 1.338 V, VONt = 0.538 V)
Transistor Sizing
We may note that both voltage transfer curves shown in Figure 16.27 are symmetri-
cal about the switching point VDD/2. This effect is a direct consequence of the fact
that the NMOS and PMOS transistors are matched: that is, Kn = Kp and
VT N = |VT P|. In general, the process conduction parameters, k′
n and k′
p, are not
equal. Therefore, in order for the two transistors to be matched, we must adjust the
width-to-length ratios. In order for Kn = Kp, we have k′
n(W/L)n = k′
p(W/L)p. In
general, k′
p < k′
n, so we must have (W/L)p > (W L)n. The PMOS device must be
larger than the NMOS device to make the two devices electrically equivalent.
CMOS Inverter Currents
When the CMOS inverter input voltage is either a logic 0 or a logic 1, the current in
the circuit is zero, since one of the transistors is cut off. When the input voltage is in

the range VT N < vI < VDD −|VT P|, both transistors are conducting and a current
exists in the inverter.
When the NMOS transistor is biased in the saturation region, the current in the
inverter is controlled by vGSN and the PMOS source-to-drain voltage adjusts such
that iDP = iDN . This condition is demonstrated in Equation (16.34). We can write
iDN = iDP = Kn(vGSN −VT N)2 = Kn(vI −VT N)2
(16.44(a))
Taking the square root yields

iDN =

iDP =

(16.44(b))
As long as the NMOS transistor is biased in the saturation region, the square root of
the CMOS inverter current is a linear function of the input voltage.
When the PMOS transistor is biased in the saturation region, the current in the
inverter is controlled by vSGP and the NMOS drain-to-source voltage adjusts such
that iDP = iDN . This condition is demonstrated in Equation (16.42). Using Equa-
tion (16.43), we can write that
iDN = iDP = Kp(VDD −vI + VT P)2
(16.45(a))
Taking the square root yields

iDN =

iDP =

Kp(VDD −vI + VT P)
(16.45(b))
As long as the PMOS transistor is biased in the saturation region, the square root of
the CMOS inverter current is also a linear function of the input voltage.
Figure 16.28 shows plots of the square root of the inverter current for two values
of VDD bias. These curves are quasi-static characteristics in that no current is diverted
into a capacitive load. At the inverter switching point, both transistors are biased in
the saturation region and both transistors inﬂuence the current. At the switching point,
the actual current characteristic does not have a sharp discontinuity in the slope. The
channel length modulation parameter λ also inﬂuences the current characteristics at
the peak value. However, the curves in Figure 16.28 are excellent approximations.
Power Dissipation
In the quiescent or static state, in which the input is either a logic 0 or a logic 1, power
dissipation in the CMOS inverter is virtually zero. However, during the switching
cycle from one state to another, current ﬂows and power is dissipated. The CMOS

inverter and logic circuits are used to drive other MOS devices for which the input
impedance is a capacitance. During the switching cycle, then, this load capacitance
must be charged and discharged.
In Figure 16.29(a), the output switches from its low to its high state. The input is
switched low, the PMOS gate is at zero volts, and the NMOS is cut off. The load ca-
pacitance CL must be charged through the PMOS device. Power dissipation in the
PMOS transistor is given by

Figure 16.29(b). The PMOS device is cut off, the NMOS transistor conducts, and the

Equation (16.52) shows that the power dissipated in a CMOS inverter is directly pro-
portional to the switching frequency and to V 2
DD. The drive in digital IC design is
toward lower supply voltages, such as 3 V or less.
The power dissipation is proportional to V 2
DD. In some digital circuits, such as
digital watches, the CMOS logic circuits are biased at VDD = 1.5 V, so the power
dissipation is substantially reduced.
EXAMPLE 16.8
Objective: Calculate the power dissipation in a CMOS inverter.
Consider a CMOS inverter with a load capacitance of CL = 2 pF biased at
VDD = 5 V. The inverter switches at a frequency of f = 100 kHz.

Part 3
Digital Electronics
Solution: From Equation (16.52), power dissipation in the CMOS inverter is
P = f CLV 2
DD = (105)(2 × 10−12)(5)2 ⇒5 μW
Comment: Previously determined values of static power dissipation in NMOS in-
verters were on the order of 500 μW; therefore, power dissipation in a CMOS
inverter is substantially smaller. In addition, in most digital systems, only a small
fraction of the logic gates change state during each clock cycle; consequently, the
power dissipation in a CMOS digital system is substantially less than in an NMOS
digital system of similar complexity.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.8: A CMOS inverter is biased at VDD = 3 V. The inverter drives an effec-
tive load capacitance of CL = 0.5 pF. Determine the maximum switching fre-
quency such that the power dissipation is limited to P = 0.10 μW. (Ans. f =
22.2 kHz)
Noise Margin
The word “noise” means transient, unwanted variations in voltages or currents. In dig-
ital circuits, if the magnitude of the noise at a logic node is too large, logic errors can
be introduced into the system. However, if the noise amplitude is less than a speciﬁed
value, called the noise margin, the noise signal will be attenuated as it passes through
a logic gate or circuit, while the logic signals will be transmitted without error.
Noise signals are usually generated outside the digital circuit and transferred
to logic nodes or interconnect lines through parasitic capacitances or inductances.
The coupling process is usually time dependent, leading to dynamic conditions in
the circuit. In digital systems, however, the noise margins are usually deﬁned in
terms of static voltages.
Noise Margin Deﬁnition
For static noise margins, the type of noise usually considered is called series-voltage
noise. Figure 16.30 shows two inverters in series in which the output of the second is
connected back to the input of the ﬁrst. Also included are series-voltage noise sources
δVL and δVH. This type of noise can be developed by inductive coupling. The input
voltage levels are indicated by H (high) and L (low). The noise amplitudes δVL and
δVH can be different, and the polarities may be such as to increase the low output and
reduce the high output. The noise margins are deﬁned as the maximum values of δVL
and δVH at which the inverters will remain in the correct state.
The actual deﬁnitions of the noise margins NML and NMH are not unique. In ad-
dition other types of noise, other than series-voltage source noise, may be present in
the system. Dynamic noise sources also complicate the issue. However, in this text,
in order to provide some measure of noise margin in a logic circuit, we will use the
unity-gain approach to determine the logic threshold levels VI L and VI H and the cor-
responding noise margins.

pected logic 1 and logic 0 output voltages of the inverter are VO H and VOL, respec-

as the points at which

(16.53)
For vI ≤VI L, the inverter gain magnitude is less than unity, and the output
changes slowly with a change in the input voltage. Similarly, for vI ≥VI H, the out-
put again changes slowly with input voltage since the gain magnitude is less than
unity. However, when the input voltage is in the range VI L < vI < VI H , the gain
magnitude is greater than one, and the output signal changes rapidly. This region is
called the undeﬁned range. If the input voltage is inadvertently pushed into this
range by a noise signal, the output may change logic states, and a logic error could be
introduced into the system. The corresponding output voltages at the unity-gain
points are denoted VO HU and VOLU, where the last subscript U signiﬁes the unity-
gain values.
The noise margins are deﬁned as
NML = VI L −VOLU
(16.54(a))
and
NMH = VO HU −VI H

Figure 16.32 shows the general voltage transfer function of a CMOS inverter.

For vI ≤VI L and vI ≥VI H, the gain is less than unity and the output changes slowly

the inverter gain is greater than unity, and the output signal changes rapidly with a
change in the input voltage. This is the undeﬁned range.

EXAMPLE 16.9
Objective: Determine the noise margins of a CMOS inverter.
Consider a CMOS inverter biased at VDD = 3.3 V. Assume the transistors are
matched with Kn = Kp and VT N = −VT P = 0.4 V.
Solution: From Equation (16.41), the input voltage at the transition points, or the in-
verter switching point, is 1.65 V. Since Kn = Kp, VI L is, from Equation (16.61),
VI L = VT N + 3
8 (VDD + VT P −VT N) = 0.4 + 3
8 (3.3 −0.4 −0.4) = 1.3375 V
Point VI H is, from Equation (16.67),
VI H = VT N + 5
8 (VDD + VT P −VT N) = 0.4 + 5
8 (3.3 −0.4 −0.4) = 1.9625 V

1182
Part 3

The output voltages at points VI L and VI H are determined from Equations
(16.60) and (16.66), respectively. They are
VO HU = 1
2[2VI L + VDD −VT N −VT P]
= 1
2[2(1.3375) + 3.3 −0.4 + 0.4] = 2.9875 V
and
VOLU = 1
2[2VI H −VDD −VT N −VT P]
= 1
2[2(1.9625) −3.3 −0.4 + 0.4] = 0.3125 V
The noise margins are therefore
NML = VI L −VOLU = 1.3375 −0.3125 = 1.025 V
and
NMH = VO HU −VI H = 2.9875 −1.9625 = 1.025 V
Comment: The results of this example are shown in Figure 16.32. Since the two
transistors are electrically identical, the voltage transfer curve and the resulting
critical voltages are symmetrical. Also, (VO H −VO HU) = 0.3125 V, which is less
than |VT P|, and (VOLU −VOL) = 0.3125 V, which is less than VT N. As long as the
input voltage remains within the limits of the noise margin, no logic error will be
transmitted through the digital system.

CMOS LOGIC CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze and design static CMOS logic gates.
Large-scale integrated CMOS circuits are used extensively in digital systems, in-
cluding watches, calculators, and microprocessors. We will look at the basic CMOS
NOR and NAND gates, and will then analyze more complex CMOS logic circuits.
Since there is no clock signal applied to these logic circuits, they are referred to as
static CMOS logic circuits.
Basic CMOS NOR and NAND Gates
In the basic or classical CMOS logic circuits, the gates of a PMOS and an NMOS are
connected together, and additional PMOS and NMOS transistors are connected in se-
ries or parallel to form speciﬁc logic circuits. Figure 16.33(a) shows a two-input
CMOS NOR gate. The NMOS transistors are in parallel and the PMOS transistors
are in series.
If A = B = logic 0, then both MN A and MN B are cut off, and the current in the
circuit is zero. The source-to-gate voltage of MP A is VDD but the current is zero;
therefore, vSD of MP A is zero. This means that the source-to-gate voltage of MP B is
also VDD. However, since the current is zero, then vSD of MP B is also zero. The out-
put voltage is therefore vO = VDD = logic 1.
If the input signals are A = logic 1 = VDD and B = logic 0 = 0 V, then the
source-to-gate voltage of MP A is zero, and the current in the circuit is again zero. The
gate-to-source voltage of MN A is VDD but the current is zero, so vDS of MN A is zero
and vO = 0 = logic 0. This result also holds for the other two possible input condi-
tions, since at least one PMOS is cut off and at least one NMOS is in a conducting
state. The NOR logic function is shown in the truth table of Figure 16.33(b).

Digital Electronics
A two-input CMOS NAND logic gate is shown in Figure 16.34(a). In this case,
the NMOS transistors are in series and the PMOS transistors are in parallel. If
A = B = logic 0, the two NMOS devices are cut off and the current in the circuit is
zero. The source-to-gate voltage of each PMOS device is VDD, which means that
both PMOS transistors are in a conducting state. However, since the current is zero,
vSD for both MP A and MP B is zero and vO = VDD. This result applies if at least one
input is a logic 0.
If the input signals are A = B = logic 1 = VDD, then both PMOS transistors are
cut off, and the current in the circuit is zero. With A = logic 1, MN A is in a conduct-
ing state; however, since the current is zero, then vDS of MN A is zero. This means that
the gate-to-source voltage of MN B is also VDD and MN B is also in a conducting state.
However, since the current is zero, then vDS of MN B is zero, and vO = logic 0 = 0 V.
The NAND logic function is shown in the truth table in Figure 16.34(b).
In both the CMOS NOR and NAND logic gates, the current in the circuit is
essentially zero when the inputs are in any quiescent state. Only very small reverse-
bias pn junction currents exist. The quiescent power dissipation is therefore essen-
tially zero. Again, this is the primary advantage of CMOS circuits.
Transistor Sizing
CMOS Inverter
We brieﬂy discussed in Section 16.3.2 the sizing of transistors in the CMOS inverter
in terms of symmetrical transfer curves. Other factors involved in the sizing of tran-
sistors are, for example, switching speed, power, area, and noise margin.
Since the standby power is very small in a CMOS inverter, the sizing can be based
on switching speed. We will specify that the switching time in the pull-up mode
should be the same as the switching time in the pull-down mode. Figure 16.35(a)
shows the effective CMOS inverter in the pull-down mode. The PMOS is cutoff and
the load capacitance is discharged through the NMOS device. The switching time is
therefore a function of the current capability of the NMOS transistor. Figure 16.35(b)
shows the effective CMOS inverter in the pull-up mode. The NMOS is cutoff and the

load capacitance is charged through the PMOS device. The switching time is a func-
tion of the current capability of the PMOS transistor.
Assuming that VT N = |VT P|, equal switching times then implies that the con-

The width-to-length ratio of the PMOS device must be approximately twice as large
as that of the NMOS device to obtain equal switching times.
In any given technology, the channel lengths of the NMOS and PMOS devices
are the same. Therefore the channel widths are sized to the desired value. We can
write that Wn = W and Wp = 2W, where Wn and Wp are the channel widths of the
NMOS and PMOS devices, respectively, and W is a standard width.
CMOS Logic Gates
We can now consider the sizing of transistors in the basic CMOS NAND and NOR
logic gates. We will specify, again, equal pull-up and pull-down switching times, and
we want the same switching times as the CMOS inverter with a load capacitance CL.
We will use the effective 2:1 ratio between PMOS and NMOS sizes from the CMOS
inverter.
Consider the two-input CMOS NOR gate shown in Figure 16.33. Assume a load
capacitance CL is connected to the output. In the worst case during a pull-down op-
eration, only one NMOS device will be turned on. To achieve the same switching
time as the CMOS inverter, the NMOS channel widths should be Wn = W. If both
NMOS devices are turned on, the effective channel width will be doubled (see Fig-
ure 16.14(a)) and the switching time will be shorter.
During a pull-up operation, both PMOS devices must be turned on. Since the
PMOS devices are in series, the effective channel length doubles (see Figure 16. 14(b)).
Therefore, to maintain the same effective width-to-length ratio, the channel widths
must be doubled. We must therefore have Wp = 2(2W) = 4W.

Now consider the two-input NAND logic gate shown in Figure 16.34. Again, as-
sume a load capacitance CL is connected to the output. In the worst case during a
pull-up operation, only one PMOS device will be turned on. This is equivalent to the
CMOS inverter, so the channel width should be Wp = 2W. If both PMOS devices are
turned on, the effective channel width is doubled and the switching time will be
shorter.
During the pull-down operation, both NMOS devices must be turned on. Again,
since the NMOS devices are in series, the effective channel length doubles. There-
fore to maintain the same effective width-to-length ratio, the channel widths must be
doubled. We must therefore have Wn = 2(W) = 2W .
The results of the transistor sizing for the CMOS inverter, and CMOS NOR and
NAND gates are shown in Figure 16.36.
EXAMPLE 16.10
Objective: Determine the transistor width-to-length ratios of a three-input CMOS
NAND logic gate.
Symmetrical switching times are desired and the switching times should corre-
spond to the basic CMOS inverter.
Solution: There are three p-channel transistors in parallel for the three-input CMOS
NAND gate. The worst case is when only one PMOS device is on in the pull-up
mode. This corresponds to the basic CMOS inverter, so the effective width should be
Wp = 2W.
There are three n-channel transistors in series for the three-input CMOS NAND
gate. All three transistors must be turned on in the pull-down mode. For three tran-
sistors in series, the effective channel length triples. Therefore, to keep the effective
NMOS width equal to W, we must have Wn = 3(W) = 3W .

The results are shown in Figure 16.37.
Comment: As the number of inputs to a basic CMOS logic gate increases, the size
of the transistors must increase. The increased area of the transistors means that the
effective input capacitance increases so that switching times of cascaded logic gates
will increase.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.10: Determine the transistor sizes of a 3-input CMOS NOR logic gate.
Symmetrical switching times are desired and the switching times should corre-
spond to the basic CMOS inverter. (Ans. Wp = 6W, Wn = W)
Complex CMOS Logic Circuits
Just as with NMOS logic designs, we can form complex logic gates in CMOS, which
avoids connecting large numbers of NOR, NAND, and inverter gates to implement
the logic function. There are formal methods that can be used to implement the logic
circuit. However, we can use the knowledge gained in the analysis and design of the
NOR and NAND circuits.

design by considering the NMOS portion of the circuit. To implement a basic OR
(NOR) function, the n-channel transistors are in parallel (Figure 16.33) and to im-
plement a basic AND (NAND) function, the n-channel transistors are in series (Fig-
ure 16.34). We will consider whether the function or its complement is generated at
the end of the design.
Solution (NMOS Design): In the overall function, we note the logic OR between the
functions AB and C(D + E), so that the NMOS devices used to implement AB will
be in parallel with the NMOS devices used to implement C(D + E). There is a logic
AND between the inputs A and B, so that the NMOS devices with these inputs will
be in series. Finally, the NMOS devices with the D and E inputs will be in parallel
and this combination will be in series with the NMOS device with the C input. The
NMOS implementation of the function is shown in Figure 16.39.
Solution (PMOS Design): The arrangement of the PMOS devices is complementary
to that of the NMOS devices. PMOS devices that perform the basic OR function are
in series and PMOS devices that perform the basic AND function are in parallel. We
then see that the PMOS devices used to implement AB will be in series with the de-
vices used to implement C(D + E). The two PMOS devices with the A and B inputs
will be in parallel. The two PMOS devices with the D and E inputs will be in series
and in turn will be in parallel with the PMOS device with the C input. The completed
circuit is shown in Figure 16.40.

Final Solution: By considering various inputs, we may note that the output signal of
the circuit shown in Figure 16.40 is actually the complement of the desired signal.
We may then simply add a CMOS inverter to the output to obtain the desired
function.
Comment: As mentioned, there are formal ways in which to design circuits. How-
ever, in many cases, these circuits can be designed by using the knowledge and intu-
ition gained from previous work. The width-to-length ratios of the various transistors
can be determined as we have done in previous examples.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.11: Design the width-to-length ratios of the transistors in the static CMOS
logic circuit of Figure 16.40. Symmetrical switching times are desired and the
switching times should correspond to the basic CMOS inverter. (Ans. All NMOS
devices, Wn = 2W; Wp(MP A) = Wp(MP B) = Wp(MPC) = 4W ; Wp(MP D) =
Wp(MPE) = 8W )
Another example of a CMOS logic gate is the exclusive-OR or XOR. The logic
function can be written as
FX O R = ¯AB + A ¯B
(16.70)
We have noticed that the output of the CMOS gates is actually the complement of the
input signal. We can therefore write
¯FX O R = FX N O R = ¯A ¯B + AB
(16.71)
Assuming that input signals A, B, ¯A, and ¯B are available, Figure 16.41 shows a
CMOS static implementation of the logic function.
We may note that ¯A ¯B as well as AB means two NMOS devices in series and two
PMOS devices in parallel. The OR function means the combination of NMOS

devices is in parallel and the combination of PMOS devices is in series. This design
is shown in the ﬁgure. In considering the truth table for the exclusive-OR function,
we may note that the output of the circuit in Figure 16.41 is indeed the exclusive-OR
function. In the design of CMOS logic gates, then, we should actually design the
complement of the desired function.
In the PMOS portion of the design, there should be an electrical connection be-
tween the drains of MP A and MP B. This connection is shown as a dotted line, but is
not actually required. The only pull-up conditions are for A = ¯B = 0 and for
¯A = B = 0, which are achieved without this connection.
Fanout and Propagation Delay Time
Fanout
The term fanout refers to the number of load gates of similar design connected to the
output of a driver gate. The maximum fanout is the maximum number of load gates
that may be connected to the output. Since the CMOS logic gate will be driving other
CMOS logic gates, the quiescent current required to drive the other CMOS gates is
essentially zero. In terms of static characteristics, the maximum fanout is virtually
limitless.
However, each additional load gate increases the load capacitance that must be
charged and discharged as the driver gate changes state, and this places a practical
limit on the maximum allowable number of load gates. Figure 16.42 shows a con-
stant current charging a load capacitance. The voltage across the capacitance is
vO = 1
CL

The load capacitance CL is proportional to the number N of load gates and to the

The propagation delay time, which is proportional to the switching time, in-
creases as the fanout increases. The propagation delay time could be reduced by in-
creasing the size of the driver transistor. However, in any given driver logic circuit
and load logic circuit, the sizes of the devices are generally ﬁxed. Consequently, the
maximum fanout is limited by the maximum acceptable propagation delay time. 
Propagation delay times are typically measured with a speciﬁed load capaci-
tance. The average propagation delay time of a two-input CMOS NOR gate (such as
an SN74HC36) is 25 ns, measured with a load capacitance of CL = 50 pF. Since the
input capacitance is CI = 10 pF, a fanout of ﬁve would produce a 50 pF load capac-
itance. A fanout larger than ﬁve would increase the load capacitance, and would also
increase the propagation delay time above the speciﬁed value.

Propagation Delay Time
Although the propagation delay time of the CMOS inverter can be determined by
analytical techniques, it can also be determined by computer simulation. This is espe-
cially true when more complex CMOS logic circuits are considered. Using the appro-
priate transistor models in the simulation, the transient response can be produced.
Obtaining an accurate transient response depends on using the correct transistor para-
meters. Some computer simulation problems in the end-of-chapter problems deal
with propagation delay times. However, we will not go into detail here.

CLOCKED CMOS LOGIC CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze and design clocked CMOS logic gates.
The CMOS logic circuits considered in the previous section are called static circuits.
One characteristic of a static CMOS logic circuit is that the output node always has a
low-resistance path to either ground or VDD. This implies that the output voltage is
well deﬁned and is never left ﬂoating.
Static CMOS logic circuits can be redesigned with an added clock signal while
at the same time eliminating many of the PMOS devices. In general, the PMOS de-
vices must be larger than NMOS devices. Eliminating as many PMOS devices as
possible reduces the required chip area as well as the input capacitance. The low-
power dissipation of the CMOS technology, however, is maintained.
Clocked CMOS circuits are dynamic circuits that generally precharge the out-
put node to a particular level when the clock is at a logic 0. Consider the circuit in
Figure 16.43. When the clock signal is low, or CLK = logic 0, MN1 is cut off and
the current in the circuit is zero. Transistor MP1 is in a conducting state, but since
the current is zero, then vO1 charges to VDD. A high input to the CMOS inverter
means that vO = 0. During this phase of the clock signal, the gate of MP2 is
precharged.
During the next phase, when the clock signal goes high, or CLK = logic 1, tran-
sistor MP1 cuts off and MN1 is biased in a conducting state. If input A = logic 0, then
MN A is cut off and there is no discharge path for voltage vO1; therefore, vO1 remains
charged at vO1 = VDD. However, if CLK = logic 1 and A = logic 1, then both MN1
and MN A are biased in a conducting state, providing a discharge path for voltage vO1.
As vO1 is pulled low, output signal vO goes high.

Figure 16.44 Clocked CMOS logic circuit: (a) AND function and (b) OR function
The quiescent power dissipation in this circuit is essentially zero, as it was in the
standard CMOS circuits. A small amount of power is required to precharge output
vO1, if it had been pulled low during the previous half clock cycle.
The single NMOS transistor MN A in Figure 16.43 can be replaced by a more
complex NMOS logic circuit. Consider the two circuits in Figure 16.44. When
CLK = logic 0, then MN1 cuts off and MP1 is in its conducting state in both circuits;
then, vO1 is charged to vO1 = VDD and vO = 0. For the circuit in Figure 16.44(a),
when CLK = logic 1, voltage vO1 is discharged to ground or pulled low only when
A = B = logic 1. In this case, vO goes high. The circuit in Figure 16.44(a) performs
the AND function. Similarly, the circuit in Figure 16.44(b) performs the OR
function.
The advantage of the precharge technique is that it avoids the use of extensive pull-
up networks: Only one PMOS and one NMOS transistor are required. This leads to an
almost 50 percent savings in silicon area for larger circuits, and a reduction in capaci-
tance resulting in higher speed. In addition, the static or quiescent power dissipation is
essentially zero, so the circuit maintains the characteristics of CMOS circuits.

The AND and OR logic transistors MN A and MN B in Figures 16.44(a) and
16.44(b) can be replaced by a generalized logic network as indicated in Figure 16.45.
The box marked f is an NMOS pull-down network that performs a particular logic
function f (X) of n variables, where X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn). The NMOS circuit is a
combination of series–parallel interconnections of n transistors. When the clock sig-
nal goes high, the CMOS inverter output is the logic function f (X).
The set of X inputs to the logic circuits f is derived from the outputs of other
CMOS inverters and clocked logic circuits. The means that when CLK = logic 0, the
outputs of all CMOS inverters are a logic 0 during the precharge cycle. As a result, all
n variables X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) are a logic 0 during the precharge cycle. During this
time, all NMOS transistors are cut off, which guarantees that output vO1 can be
precharged to VDD. There can then be only one possible transition at each node during
the evaluation phase. The output of the CMOS buffer may change from a 0 to a 1.
An example of a cascaded domino CMOS circuit is shown in Figure 16.46. Dur-
ing the precharge cycle, in which CLK = logic 0, nodes 1 and 3 are charged high and
nodes 2 and 4 are low. Also during this time, the inputs A, B, and C are all a logic 0.
During the evaluation phase, in which CLK = logic 1, if A = C = logic 1 and
B = logic 0, then node 1 remains charged high, f1 = logic 0, and node 3 discharges
through MNC causing f2 to go high. However, if, during the evaluation phase,
A = B = logic 1 and C = logic 0, then node 1 is pulled low causing f1 to go high,
which in turn causes node 3 to go low and forces node 4 high. This chain of actions
thus leads to the term domino circuit.

TRANSMISSION GATES
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of NMOS
and CMOS transmission gates.
Transistors can act as switches between driving circuits and load circuits. Transistors
used to perform this function are called transmission gates. We will examine NMOS and
CMOS transmission gates, which can also be conﬁgured to perform logic functions.
NMOS Transmission Gate
The NMOS enhancement-mode transistor in Figure 16.47(a) is a transmission gate
connected to a load capacitance CL, which could be the input gate capacitance of a
MOS logic circuit. In this circuit, the transistor must be bilateral, which means it
must be able to conduct current in either direction. This is a natural feature of MOS-
FETs. Terminals a and b are assumed to be equivalent, and the bias applied to the
transistor determines which terminal acts as the drain and which terminal acts as the
source. The substrate must be connected to the most negative potential in the circuit,
which is usually ground. Figure 16.47(b) shows a simpliﬁed circuit symbol for the
NMOS transmission gate that is used extensively.
We assume that the NMOS transmission gate is to operate over a voltage range
of zero-to-VDD. If the gate voltage φ is zero, then the n-channel transistor is cut off
and the output is isolated from the input. The transistor is essentially an open switch.
If φ = VDD, vI = VDD, and vO is initially zero, then terminal a acts as the drain
since its bias is VDD, and terminal b acts as the source since its bias is zero. Current en-
ters the drain from the input, charging up the capacitor. The gate-to-source voltage is
vGS = φ −vO = VDD −vO
(16.75)
As the capacitor charges and vO increases, the gate-to-source voltage decreases. The
capacitor stops charging when the current goes to zero. This occurs when the gate-
to-source voltage vGS becomes equal to the threshold voltage VT N. The maximum
output voltage occurs when vGS = VT N , therefore, from Equation (16.75), we have
vGS(min) = VT N = VDD −vO(max)
(16.76(a))
or
vO(max) = VDD −VT N

where VT N is the threshold voltage taking into account the body effect.
Equation (16.76(b)) demonstrates one disadvantage of an NMOS transmission
gate. A logic 1 level degrades, or attenuates, as it passes through the transmission gate.
However, this may not be a serious problem for many applications.
Figure 16.48 shows the quasi-static output voltage versus input voltage of the
NMOS transmission gate. As seen in the ﬁgure, when vI = VDD, the output voltage
is vO = VDD −VT N as we have discussed. For input voltages in the range vI <
VDD −VT N , the ﬁgure demonstrates that vO = vI . In this range of input voltages,
the gate-to-source voltage is still greater than the threshold voltage. However, in
steady-state, the current must be zero through the capacitor. In this case, the current
becomes zero when the drain-to-source voltage is zero, or when vO = vI .
Now consider the situation in which φ = VDD, vI = 0, and vO = VDD −VT N
initially. Terminal b then acts as the drain and terminal a acts as the source. The gate-
to-source voltage is
vGS = φ −vI = VDD −0 = VDD
(16.77)
The value of vGS is a constant, and the capacitor discharges as current enters the NMOS
transistor drain. The capacitor stops discharging when the current goes to zero. Since
vGS is a constant at VDD, the drain current goes to zero when the drain-to-source volt-
age is zero, which means that the capacitor completely discharges to zero. This implies
that a logic 0 is transmitted unattenuated through the NMOS transmission gate.
Using an NMOS transmission gate in a MOS circuit may introduce a dynamic
condition. Figure 16.49 shows a cross section of the NMOS transistor in the trans-
mission gate conﬁguration. If vI = φ = VDD, then the load capacitor charges to

EXAMPLE 16.12
Objective: Estimate the rate at which the output voltage vO in Figure 16.49 de-
creases with time when the NMOS transmission gate transistor is in its off state.
Assume the capacitor is initially charged to vO = 2.9 V. Let CL = 0.2 pF and as-
sume the reverse-biased pn junction leakage current is a constant at iL = 100 pA.
Solution: The voltage across the capacitor can be written as
vO = −1

where K1 = vO(t = 0) = 2.9 V is the initial condition. Therefore,

0.2 × 10−12 = −500 V/s ⇒−0.5 V/ms
Therefore, in this example, the capacitor would completely discharge in 5.8 ms.
Comment: Even though the NMOS transmission gate may introduce a dynamic con-
dition into a circuit, this gate is still useful in clocked logic circuits in which a clock
signal is periodically applied to the NMOS transistor gate. If, for example, the clock
frequency is 25 kHz, the clock pulse period is 40 μs, which means that the output
voltage would decay by only approximately 0.7 percent during a clock period.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.12: The threshold voltage of the NMOS transmission gate transistor in Figure
16.47(a) is VT N = 0.4 V. Determine the output voltage vO for: (a) vI = φ = 2.5 V;
(b) vI = 1.8 V, φ = 2.5 V; (c) vI = 2.3 V, φ = 2.5 V; and (d) vI = 2.5 V,
φ = 1.5 V. Neglect the body effect. (Ans. (a) vO = 2.1 V, (b) vO = 1.8 V,
(c) vO = 2.1 V, (d) vO = 1.1 V)
EXAMPLE 16.13
Objective: Determine the output of an NMOS inverter driven by a series of NMOS
transmission gates.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 16.50. The NMOS inverter is driven by
three NMOS transmission gates in series. Assume the threshold voltages of the
NMOS transmission gate transistors and the NMOS driver transistor are
vO = VDD −VT N . When φ = 0, the NMOS device turns off and the input and out-
put become isolated.
The capacitor voltage reverse biases the pn junction between terminal b and
ground. A reverse-biased pn junction leakage current begins to discharge the capaci-
tor, and the circuit does not remain in a static condition. This circuit is now dynamic
in that the high output does not remain constant with time.

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits

VT N = 0.4 V, and the threshold voltage of the load transistor is VT N L = −0.6 V. Let
K D/KL = 3 for the inverter. Determine vO for vI = 0 and vI = 2.5 V
Solution: The three NMOS transmission gates in series act as an AND/NAND func-
tion. If vI = 0 and A = B = C = logic 1 = 2.5 V, the gate capacitance to driver MD
becomes completely discharged, which means that vO1 = vO2 = vO3 = 0. Driver
MD is cut off and vO = 2.5 V.
If vI = 2.5 V and A = B = C = logic 1 = 2.5 V, the three transmission gates
are biased in their conducting state, and the gate capacitance of MD becomes
charged. For transistor MN A, the current becomes zero when the gate-to-source volt-
age is equal to the threshold voltage, or, from Equation (16.76(b)),
vO1 = VDD −VT N = 2.5 −0.4 = 2.1 V
Transistors MN B and MNC also cut off when the gate-to-source voltages are equal to
the threshold voltage; therefore
vO2 = vO3 = VDD −VT N = 2.5 −0.4 = 2.1 V
This result shows that the drain-to-source voltages of MN B and MNC are also
zero. A threshold voltage drop is lost in the first transmission gate, but additional
threshold voltage drops are not lost in subsequent NMOS transmission gates in
series.
For a voltage of vO3 = 2.1 V applied to the gate of MD, the driver is biased in
the nonsaturation region and the load is biased in the saturation region. From
iDD = iDL, we have
K D

2(vO3 −VT N)vO −v2
O

= KL[−VT N L]2
The output voltage is found to be vO = 35.7 mV.
If any one of the transmission gate voltages, A or B or C, switches to a logic 0, then
vO3 will begin to discharge through a reverse-biased pn junction in the transmission
gates, which means that vO will increase with time.
Comment: In this example, the inverter is again in a dynamic condition; that is,
when any transmission gate is cut off, the output voltage changes with time. How-
ever, this type of circuit can be used in clocked digital systems.

NMOS Pass Networks
As integrated circuit technology advances, one emphasis is on increased circuit den-
sity. The maximum number of circuit functions per unit area is determined either by
power dissipation density or by the area occupied by transistors and related devices.
One form of NMOS circuit logic that minimizes power dissipation and maximizes
device density is called pass transistor logic. Pass transistor circuits use minimum-
sized transistors, providing high density and high operating speed. The average power
dissipation is due only to the switching power consumed by the driver circuits in charg-
ing and discharging the pass transistor control gates and driving the pass network inputs.
In this section, we present a few examples of NMOS pass transistor logic cir-
cuits. Consider the circuit in Figure 16.52. To determine the output response, we ex-
amine the conditions listed in Table 16.1 for the possible states of the input signals A
and B. We assume that a logic 1 level is VDD volts. In states 1 and 2, transmission
gate MN2 is biased in its conducting state. For state 1, ¯A = logic 1 is transmitted to
the output so f = logic 1′, where the logic 1′ level is (VDD −VT N ). The logic 1 level
is attenuated by one threshold voltage drop. For state 2, A = logic 0 is transmitted
16.6.2

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits
1199
unattenuated to the output. In states 3 and 4, transmission gate MN1 is biased in its
conducting state. The A = logic 0 for state 3 is transmitted unattenuated to the out-
put, and A = logic 1 for state 4 is attenuated during transmission; therefore, f =
logic 1′. The output is thus the exclusive-NOR function.
Another example of an NMOS pass transistor logic circuit is shown in Fig-
ure 16.53. The output response as a function of the input gate controls A and B is
shown in Table 16.2. This circuit is a multiplexer; that is, for a speciﬁc set of gate con-
trols, the input signals Pi are individually passed to the output. By using both normal
and inverted forms of A and B, four inputs can be controlled with just two variables.
A potential problem of NMOS pass transistor logic is that the output may be left
ﬂoating in a high impedance state and charged high. Consider the circuit shown in
Figure 16.54. If, for example, ¯B = C = logic 0 and A = logic 1, then f = logic 1′,
which is the logic 1 level attenuated by VT N. When A is switched to logic 0, the out-
put should be low, but there may not be a discharge path to ground, and the output
may retain the logic 1′ stored at the output capacitance.
The NMOS pass network must be designed to avoid a high impedance output by
passing a logic 0 whenever a 0 is required at the output. A logic network that per-
forms the logic function f = A + ¯B · C, as indicated in Figure 16.54, is shown in
Figure 16.55. The complementary function ¯f = ¯A · (B + ¯C) attached at the output
node drives the output to a logic 0 whenever f = 0.

Figure 16.56 (a) CMOS transmission gate and (b) simpliﬁed circuit symbol
CMOS Transmission Gate
A CMOS transmission gate is shown in Figure 16.56(a). The parallel combination
of NMOS and PMOS transistors, with complementary gate signals, allows the input
signal to be transmitted to the output without the threshold voltage attenuation. Both
transistors must be bilateral; therefore, the NMOS substrate is connected to the most
negative potential in the circuit and the PMOS substrate is connected to the most pos-
itive potential (usually, ground and VDD, respectively). Figure 16.56(b) shows a fre-
quently used simpliﬁed circuit symbol for the CMOS transmission gate.
We again assume that the transmission gate is to operate over a voltage range of
zero-to-VDD. If the control voltages are φ = 0 and ¯φ = VDD, then both the NMOS
and PMOS transistors are cut off and the output is isolated from the input. In this
state, the circuit is essentially an open switch.
If φ = VDD, ¯φ = 0, vI = VDD, and vO is initially zero, then for the NMOS de-
vice, terminal a acts as the drain and terminal b acts as the source, whereas for the
PMOS device, terminal c acts as the drain and terminal d acts as the source. Current
enters the NMOS drain and the PMOS source, as shown in Figure 16.57(a), to charge
the load capacitor. The NMOS gate-to-source voltage is

PMOS transistors
and the PMOS source-to-gate voltage is
vSGP = vI −¯φ = VDD −0 = VDD
(16.78(b))
As with the NMOS transmission gate, when vO = VDD −VT N , the NMOS transis-
tor cuts off and iDN = 0 since VGSN = VT N . However, since the source-to-gate volt-
age of the PMOS device is a constant at vSGP = VDD, the PMOS transistor continues
to conduct. The drain current iDP goes to zero when the PMOS source-to-drain volt-
age goes to zero, or vSDP = 0. This means that the load capacitor CL continues to
charge through the PMOS device until the output and input voltages are equal, or in
this case, vO = vI = VDD.
Consider what happens if φ = VDD, ¯φ = 0, vI = 0, and vO = VDD initially. For
the NMOS device, terminal a acts as the source and terminal b acts as the drain,
whereas for the PMOS device, terminal c acts as the source and terminal d acts as the
drain. Current enters the NMOS drain and the PMOS source, as shown in Figure
16.57(b), to discharge the capacitor. The NMOS gate-to-source voltage is
vGSN = φ −vI = VDD −0 = VDD
(16.79(a))
and the PMOS source-to-gate voltage is
vSGP = vO −¯φ = vO −0 = vO
(16.79(b))
When vSGP = vO = |VT P|, the PMOS device cuts off and iDP goes to zero. How-
ever, since vGSN = VDD, the NMOS transistor continues conducting and capacitor
CL completely discharges to zero.
Using a CMOS transmission gate in a MOS circuit may introduce a dynamic con-
dition. Figure 16.58 shows the CMOS transmission gate with simpliﬁed cross sections
of the NMOS and PMOS transistors. If φ = 0 and ¯φ = VDD, then the input and output
are isolated. If vO = VDD, then the NMOS substrate-to-terminal b pn junction is
reverse biased and capacitance CL can discharge, as it did in the NMOS transmission
gate. If, however, vO = 0, then the PMOS terminal c-to-substrate pn junction is reverse
biased and capacitance CL can charge to a positive voltage. This circuit is therefore
dynamic in that the output high or low conditions do not remain constant with time.

CMOS Pass Networks
CMOS transmission gates may also be used in pass network logic design. CMOS
pass networks use NMOS transistors to pass 0’s, PMOS transistors to pass 1’s, and
CMOS transmission gates to pass a variable to the output. An example is shown in
Figure 16.59. One PMOS transistor is used to transmit a logic 1, while transmis-
sion gates are used to transmit a variable that may be either a logic 1 or a logic 0. We
can show that for any combination of signals, a logic 1 or logic 0 is deﬁnitely passed
to the output.

SEQUENTIAL LOGIC CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze and understand the characteristics of shift reg-
isters and various ﬂip-ﬂop designs.
In the logic circuits that we have considered in the previous sections, such as NOR and
NAND logic gates, the output is determined only by the instantaneous values of the
input signals. These circuits are therefore classiﬁed as combinational logic circuits.

Figure 16.60 Dynamic shift register with NMOS inverters and transmission gates
Another class of circuits is called sequential logic circuits. The output depends
not only on the inputs, but also on the previous history of its inputs. This feature gives
sequential circuits the property of memory. Shift registers and ﬂip-ﬂops are typical
examples of such circuits. We will also brieﬂy consider a full-adder circuit. The char-
acteristic of these circuits is that they store information for a short time until the
information is transferred to another part of the system.
In this section, we introduce a basic shift register and the basic concept of a ﬂip-
ﬂop. These circuits can become very complex and are usually described with logic
diagrams. We will also introduce a CMOS full adder circuit in terms of its logic
diagram and then provide the transistor implementation of this logic function. Addi-
tional information can be found in more advanced texts.
Dynamic Shift Registers
A shift register can be formed from transmission gates and inverters. Figure 16.60
shows a combination of NMOS transmission gates and NMOS depletion-load in-
verters. The clock signals applied to the gates of the NMOS transmission gates must
be complementary, nonoverlapping pulses. The effective capacitances at the gates of
MD1 and MD2 are indicated by the dotted connections to CL1 and CL2.
16.7.1
If, for example, CL1 is initially uncharged when vO1 = 0 and if vI = VDD when
φ1 = VDD, then a logic 1′ = VDD −VT N voltage should exist at vO1 at the end of
clock pulse φ1. The capacitance of CL1 charges through MN1 and the driving circuit
of vI . The effective RC time constant must be sufﬁciently small to achieve this charg-
ing effect. As vO1 goes high, vO2 goes low, but the low is not transmitted through
MN2 as long as φ2 remains low.
Figure 16.61 is used to determine the operation of this circuit and the voltages at
various times. For simplicity, we assume that VDD = 5 V and VT N = 1 V for the
NMOS drivers and transmission gate transistors.
At t = t1, vI = φ1 = 5 V, vO1 charges to vDD −VT N = 4 V, and vO2 goes low. At
this time, MN2 is still cut off, which means that the values of vO3 and vO4 depend on
the previous history. At t = t2, φ1 is zero, MN1 is cut off, but vO1 remains charged. At
t = t3, φ2 is high, and the logic 0 at vO2 is transmitted to vO3, which forces vO4 to 5 V.
The input signal vI = 5 V at t = t1 has thus been transmitted to the output; therefore,

1204
Part 3
Digital Electronics
vO4 = vI = 5 V at t = t3. The input signal is transmitted, or shifted, from the input to
the output during one clock cycle, making this circuit one stage of a shift register.
At t = t4, vI = 0, and φ1 = 5 V, so that vO1 = 0 and vO2 = 5 V. Since φ2 = 0,
MN2 is cut off, and vO2 and vO3 are isolated. At t = t5, φ2 = 5 V, so that vO3 charges
to VDD −VT N = 4 V, and vO4 goes low (logic 0). At t = t6, both NMOS transmis-
sion gates are cut off, and the two inverters remain in their previous states. It is im-
portant that φ1 and φ2 do not overlap, or the signal would propagate through the
whole chain at once and we would no longer have a shift register.
In the dynamic condition of NMOS transmission gates, the high output voltage
across the output capacitance does not remain constant with time; it discharges
through the transmission gate transistor. This same effect applies to the shift register
in Figure 16.60. For example, from Figure 16.61, at t = t2, vO1 = 4 V, φ1 = 0, and
MN1 is cut off. Voltage vO1 will start to decay and vO2 will begin to increase. To pre-
vent logic errors from being introduced into the system, the clock signal period T
must be small compared to the effective RC discharge time constant. The circuit in
Figure 16.60 is therefore called a dynamic shift register.
A dynamic shift register formed in a CMOS technology is shown in Figure 16.62.
Operation of this circuit is very similar to that of the dynamic NMOS shift register,
except for the voltage levels. For example, when vI = φ1 = VDD, then vO1 = VDD
and vO2 = 0. When φ2 goes high, then vO3 goes to zero, vO4 = VDD, and the input
signal is shifted to the output during one clock period.

Figure 16.63 NMOS R–S ﬂip-ﬂop
R–S Flip-Flop
Flip-ﬂops are bistable circuits usually formed by cross-coupling two NOR gates.
Figure 16.63 shows an R–S ﬂip-ﬂop using NMOS NOR logic gates with depletion
loads. As shown, M1, M2, and M3 form one NOR gate, and M4, M5, and M6 form the
second. The outputs of the two NOR circuits are connected back to the inputs of the
opposite NOR gates.
If we assume that S = logic 1 and R = logic 0, then M1 is biased in its con-
ducting state and output ¯Q is forced low. The inputs to both M4 and M5 are low, so
output Q goes high to a logic 1 = VDD. Transistor M2 is then also biased in a con-
ducting state. The two outputs Q and ¯Q are complementary and, by deﬁnition, the
ﬂip-ﬂop is in the set state when Q = logic 1 and ¯Q = logic 0.
If S returns to logic 0, then M1 turns off, but M2 remains turned on so ¯Q remains
low and Q remains high. Therefore, when S goes low, nothing in the circuit can force
a change and the ﬂip-ﬂop stores this particular logic state.
When R = logic 1 and S = logic 0, then M4 turns on so output Q goes low.
With S = Q = logic 0, then both M1 and M2 are cut off and ¯Q goes high. Transistor
M5 turns on, keeping Q low when R goes low. The ﬂip-ﬂop is now in the reset state.
If both S and R inputs were to go high, then both outputs Q and ¯Q would go low.
However, this would mean that the outputs would not be complementary. Therefore,
a logic 1 at both S and R is considered to be a forbidden or nonallowed condition. If
both inputs go high and then return to logic 0, the state of the ﬂip-ﬂop is determined
by whichever input goes low last. If both inputs go low simultaneously, then the out-
puts will ﬂip into one state or the other, as determined by slight imbalances in tran-
sistor characteristics.
Figure 16.64 shows an R–S ﬂip-ﬂop using CMOS NOR logic gates. The outputs
of the two NOR gates are connected back to the inputs of the opposite NOR gates to
form the ﬂip-ﬂop.
If S = logic 1 and R = logic 0, then MN1 is turned on, MP1 is cut off, and ¯Q goes
low. With ¯Q = R = logic 0, then both MN3 and MN4 are cut off, both MP3 and MP4
are biased in a conducting state so that the output Q goes high. With Q = logic 1, MN2
is biased on, MP2 is biased off, and the ﬂip-ﬂop is in a set condition. When S goes low,
MN1 turns off, MN2 remains conducting, so the state of the ﬂip-ﬂop does not change.

Digital Electronics
When S = logic 0 and R = logic 1, then output Q is forced low, output ¯Q goes
high, and the ﬂip-ﬂop is in a reset condition. Again, a logic 1 at both S and R is con-
sidered to be a forbidden or a nonallowed condition, since the resulting outputs are
not complementary.
D Flip-Flop
A D-type ﬂip-ﬂop is used to provide a delay. The logic bit on the D input is trans-
ferred to the output at the next clock pulse. This ﬂip-ﬂop is used in counters and shift
registers. The basic circuit is similar to the CMOS dynamic shift register in Fig-
ure 16.62, except that additional circuitry makes the D ﬂip-ﬂop a static circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 16.65. The CMOS inverter composed of MN2 and
MP2 is driven by a CMOS transmission gate composed of MN1 and MP1. A second
CMOS inverter, MN3 and MP3, is connected in a feedback conﬁguration. If vI =
high, then vO1 goes high when the transmission gate is conducting, and output vO,
which is the input to the feedback inverter, goes low.
When the CMOS transmission gate turns off, the pn junction in the MN1 trans-
mission gate transistor is reverse biased. In this case, however, voltage vO1 is not sim-
ply across the gate capacitance of inverter MN2–MP2. Transistor MP3 is biased in a
conducting state, so the reverse-biased pn junction leakage current IL is supplied
through MP3, as indicated in Figure 16.65. Since this leakage current is small, the
source-to-drain voltage of MP3 will be small, and vO1 will remain biased at essen-
tially VDD. The circuit will therefore remain in this static condition.
Similarly, when vO1 is low and vO is high, the pn junction in the MP1 transmis-
sion gate transistor is reverse biased and transistor MN3 is biased on. Transistor MN3
sinks the pn junction leakage current I ′
L, and the circuit remains in this static condi-
tion until changed by a new input signal through the transmission gate.

The circuit shown in Figure 16.66 is a master–slave conﬁguration of a D ﬂip-
ﬂop. When clock pulse φ is high, transmission gate TG1 is conducting, and data D
goes through the ﬁrst inverter, which means that Q′ = ¯D. Transmission gate TG2 is
off, so data stops at Q′. When clock pulse φ goes low, then TG3 turns on, and the
master portion of the ﬂip-ﬂip is in a static conﬁguration. Also when φ goes low, TG2
turns on, the data are transmitted through the slave portion of the ﬂip-ﬂop, and the
output is Q = ¯Q′ = D. The data present when φ is high are transferred to the output
of the ﬂip-ﬂop during the negative transition of the clock pulse. The various signals
in the D ﬂip-ﬂop are shown in Figure 16.67.
Additional circuitry can be added to the D ﬂip-ﬂop in Figure 16.66 to provide a
set and reset capability.
CMOS Full-Adder Circuit
One of the most widely used building blocks in arithmetic processing architectures
is the one-bit full-adder circuit. We will ﬁrst consider the logic diagram from the
Boolean function and then consider the implementation in a conventional CMOS
design.
Assuming that we have two input bits to be added plus a carry signal from a pre-
vious stage, the sum-out and carry-out signals are deﬁned by the following two
Boolean functions of three input variables A, B, and C.
Sum-out = A ⊕B ⊕C
= ABC + A ¯B ¯C + ¯A ¯BC + ¯AB ¯C
(16.80(a))
Carry-out = AB + AC + BC
(16.80(b))
The logic diagrams for these functions are shown in Figure 16.68. As we have seen
previously, the implementation at the transistor level can be done with fewer transis-
tors than would be used if all the NOR and NAND gates were actually connected as
shown in the logic diagram.
Figure 16.69 is a transistor-level schematic of the one-bit full-adder circuit im-
plemented in a conventional CMOS technology. We can understand the basic design
from the logic diagram. For example, we may consider the NMOS portion of the
carry-out signal. We see that transistors MN A1 and MN B1 are in parallel, to perform
the basic OR function, and these transistors are in series with transistor MNC1, to per-
form the basic AND function. These three transistors form the NMOS portion of the
design of the two gates labeled G1 and G2 in Figure 16.68. We also have transistors
MN A2 and MN B2 in series, to perform the basic AND function of gate G3. This set of
16.7.4

1208
Part 3

two transistors is in parallel with the previous three transistors, and this conﬁguration
performs the basic OR function of gate G4. This output signal goes through an in-
verter to become the ﬁnal carry-out signal.
We can go through the same discussion for the design of the NMOS portion of
the sum-out signal. The PMOS design is then the complement of the NMOS design.
As mentioned, the total number of transistors in the ﬁnal design is considerably less
than would have occurred if the basic OR and AND gates shown in the logic diagram
were actually incorporated in the design.

one type of memory, considered in this chapter, and deﬁne a class of digital elec-
tronic circuits that are just as important as the logic gates.
A memory cell is a circuit, or in some cases just a single device, that can store a
bit of information. A systematic arrangement of memory cells constitutes a memory.
The memory must also include peripheral circuits to address and write data into the
cells as well as detect data that are stored in the cells.
In this section, we deﬁne the various types of semiconductor memories, discuss
the memory organization, and brieﬂy consider address decoders. In the next section,
we analyze in detail some of the basic memory cells and brieﬂy discuss sense
ampliﬁers.
Classiﬁcations of Memories
Two basic types of semiconductor memory are considered. The ﬁrst is the random
access memory (RAM), a read–write memory, in which each individual cell can be
addressed at any particular time. The access time to each cell is virtually the same.
Implicit in the deﬁnition of the RAM is that both the read and write operations are
permissible in each cell with also approximately the same access time. Both static
and dynamic RAM cells are considered.
A second class of semiconductor memory is the read-only memory (ROM).
The set of data in this type of memory is generally considered to be ﬁxed, although
in some designs the data can be altered. However, the time required to write new data
is considerably longer than the read access time of the memory cell. A ROM may be
used, for example, to store the instructions of a system operating program.
A volatile memory is one that loses its data when power is removed from the cir-
cuit, while nonvolatile memory retains its data even when power is removed. In gen-
eral, a random access memory is a volatile memory, while read-only memories are
nonvolatile.
Random Access Memories
Two types of RAM are the static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). A sta-
tic RAM consists of a basic bistable ﬂip-ﬂop circuit that needs only a dc current or
voltage applied to retain its memory. Two stable states exist, deﬁned as logic 1 and
logic 0. A dynamic RAM is an MOS memory that stores one bit of information as
charge on a capacitor. Since the charge on the capacitor decays with a ﬁnite time con-
stant (milliseconds), a periodic refresh is needed to restore the charge so that the
dynamic RAM does not lose its memory.
The advantage of the SRAM is that this circuit does not need the additional com-
plexity of a refresh cycle and refresh circuitry, but the disadvantage is that this circuit
is fairly large. In general, SRAM requires six transistors. The advantage of a DRAM
is that it consists of only one transistor and one capacitor, but the disadvantage is the
required refresh circuitry and refresh cycles.
Read-Only Memories
There are two general types of ROM. The ﬁrst is programmed either by the manu-
facturer (mask programmable) or by the user (programmable, or PROM). Once the
ROM has been programmed by either method, the data in the memory are ﬁxed and
cannot be altered. The second type of ROM may be referred to as an alterable ROM
in that the data in the ROM may be reprogrammed if desired. This type of ROM may
16.8.1

1210
Part 3
Digital Electronics
be called an EPROM (erasable programmable ROM), EEPROM (electrically
erasable PROM), or ﬂash memory. As mentioned, the data in these memories can be
reprogrammed although the time involved is much longer than the read access time.
In some cases, the memory chip may actually have to be removed from the circuit
during the reprogramming process.
Memory Architecture
The basic memory architecture has the conﬁguration shown in Figure 16.70. The ter-
minal connections may include inputs, outputs, addresses, and read and write con-
trols. The main portion of the memory involves the data storage. A RAM memory
will have all of the terminal connections mentioned, whereas a ROM memory will
not have the inputs and the write controls.
A typical RAM architecture, shown in Figure 16.71, consists of a matrix of stor-
age bits arranged in an array with 2M columns and 2N rows. The array may be square,
in which case M and N are equal. This particular array may be only one of several on
a single chip. To read data stored in a particular cell within the array, a row address is
inputted and decoded to select one of the row lines. All of the cells along this row are
activated. A column address is also inputted and decoded to select one of the
columns. The one particular memory cell at the intersection of the row and column
addressed is then selected. The logic level stored in the cell is routed down a bit line
to a sense ampliﬁer.
Control circuits are used to enable or select a particular memory array on a chip
and also to select whether data are to be read from or written into the memory cell.
Memory chips or arrays are designed to be paralleled so that the memory capacity
can be increased. The additional lines needed to address parallel arrays are called
chip select signals. If a particular chip or array is not selected, then no memory cell
is addressed in that particular array. The chip select signal controls the tristate output
of the data-in and data-out buffers. In this way, the data-in and data-out lines to and
from several arrays may be connected together without interfering with each other.

Address Decoders
The row and column decoders in Figure 16.71 are essential elements in all memories.
Access time and power consumption of memories may be largely determined by the
decoder design. Figure 16.72 shows a simple decoder with a two-bit input. The
decoder uses NAND logic circuits, although the same type of decoder may be
implemented in NOR gates. The input word goes through input buffers that generate
the complement as well as the signal.

Another example of the direct implementation of a decoder is shown in
Figure 16.73. Figure 16.73(a) shows a pair of NMOS input buffer-inverters, and 
Figure 16.73(b) shows a ﬁve-input NOR logic address decoder circuit using NMOS
enhancement-mode drivers and a depletion load. A pair of input-buffer inverters is
required for each input address line. The input signal is then required to drive only an
inverter, while the buffer-inverter pair can be designed to drive the remainder of the
logic circuits. The output of the NOR decoder goes high only when all inputs are a
logic 0. The NOR gate in Figure 16.73(b) would decode the address word 00110 and
select the seventh row or column for a read or write operation. (Note: An input of
00000 is used to address the ﬁrst row or column.)
As the size of the memory increases, the length of the address word must
increase. For example, a 64-K (where 1 K = 1024 bits) memory whose cells are

1212
Part 3
Digital Electronics
arranged in a square array would require an 8-bit word for the row address and
another 8-bit word for the column address. As the word size increases, the decoder
becomes more complex, and the number of transistors and power dissipation may
become large. In addition, the total capacitance of MOS decoder transistors and
interconnect lines increase so that propagation delay times may become signiﬁcant.
The number of transistors required to design a decoder may be reduced by using a
two-stage decoder using both NOR and NAND gates. These circuits may be found in
more advanced textbooks on digital circuits.

RAM MEMORY CELLS
Objective: • Analyze and design random-access-memory (RAM) cells
In this section, we consider two designs of an NMOS static RAM (SRAM), one
design of a CMOS static RAM, and one design of a dynamic RAM (DRAM). We
also consider examples of sense ampliﬁers and read/write circuitry. This section is
intended to present the basic concepts used in memory cell design. More advanced
designs can again be found in advanced texts on digital circuits.
NMOS SRAM Cells
A static RAM cell is designed by cross-coupling the inputs and outputs of two
inverters. In the case of an NMOS design, the load devices may be either depletion-
mode transistors or polysilicon resistors, as shown in Figure 16.74. In either case, the

inputs and outputs of the two inverters are cross-coupled to form a basic ﬂip-ﬂop. If
transistor M1 is turned on, for example, the output Q is low, which means that tran-
sistor M2 is cut off. Since M2 is cut off, the output ¯Q is high, ensuring that M1 is
turned on. Thus, we have a static situation as long as the bias voltage VDD is applied
to the circuit.
To access (read or write) the data contained in the memory cell, two NMOS
transmission gate transistors, MA and MB, connect the memory cell to the comple-
mentary bit lines. When the word line signal or row select signal is low, both trans-
mission gate transistors are cut off and the memory cell is isolated or in a standby
condition. The data stored in the cell remain stored as long as power is applied to the
cell. When the row select or word line signal goes high, the memory cell is then con-
nected to the complementary data lines so that the data in the cell can be read or new
data can be written into the cell.
One critical parameter in the design of RAM cells is power dissipation. As we
will see in the following example, this is one situation in which incorporating a high-
valued resistor as a load device improves the design. A lightly doped polysilicon load
resistor is formed by ion implantation, which can accurately dope the polysilicon to
produce the designed resistance value.

Comment: We see that the SRAM with the resistive load dissipates 10 times less
power than the SRAM with the depletion-load device. Thus, for a given allowed
power dissipation per chip, the memory with the resistive load could be 10 times
larger than that using the depletion load device.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 16.14: A 16-K NMOS static RAM cell using a resistor load is to be designed.
Each cell is to be biased at VDD = 2.5 V. Assume transistor parameters as de-
scribed in Example 16.14. The entire memory is to dissipate no more than
125 mW in standby. Design the value of R in each cell to meet this speciﬁcation.
(Ans. R = 0.82 M)
Since the value of the load resistance R is, in general, very large, the memory must
be designed so that the resistor R is not required to be a pull-up device. We will see
this type of design later. The resistors can actually be fabricated on top of the NMOS
transistors by a double-polysilicon technology, so that the cell with resistor load de-
vices can be very compact, resulting in a high-density memory.
CMOS SRAM Cells
The basic six-transistor CMOS SRAM cell is shown in Figure 16.75. The inputs and
outputs of the two CMOS inverters are cross-coupled so that the circuit will be in one
of two static conditions. For example, if ¯Q is low, then MN1 is cut off so that Q is
high, which in turn means that MP2 is cut off, ensuring that ¯Q remains low. The two
NMOS transmission gate transistors again connect the basic memory cell to the
complementary data lines.

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits

The traditional advantages of CMOS technology include low static power dissi-
pation, superior noise immunity to either bipolar or NMOS, wide operating temper-
ature range, sharp transfer characteristics, and wide voltage supply tolerance.
CMOS is inherently lower power than NMOS, since conducting paths between
power and ground do not arise when the circuit is in one logic state or the other. In
standard CMOS, the p- and n-channel devices in the memory cell and in the periphery
circuits are in series and on at the same time only during switching. Current is, there-
fore, drawn only during switching. This makes SRAMs and CMOS extremely low
power in standby, when there are only surface, junction, and channel leakage currents.
A more complete circuit of the CMOS static RAM is shown in Figure 16.76,
which includes PMOS data line pull-up transistors on the complementary bit lines. If
all word line signals are zero, then all pass transistors are turned off. The two data
lines with the relatively large column capacitances are charged up by the column
pull-up transistors, MP3 and MP4, to the full VDD voltage.

Digital Electronics
To determine the (W/L) ratios of the transistors in a typical CMOS SRAM cell,
two basic requirements must be taken into consideration. First, the read operation
should not destroy the information stored in the cell, and second, the cell should
allow for the modiﬁcation of the data stored during a write operation. Consider a read
operation in which a logic 0 (Q = 0 and ¯Q = VDD) is stored in the cell. The voltage
levels in the cell and on the data lines just prior to the read operation are shown in
Figure 16.77. Transistors MP1 and MN2 are turned off while transistors MN1 and MP2
are biased in the nonsaturation region.
Immediately after the word select signal is applied to the pass transistors MA and
MB, the voltage on the ¯D data line will not change signiﬁcantly, since the pass tran-
sistor MB is actually not conducting and no current ﬂows. On the opposite side of the
cell, current will ﬂow through MA and MN1 so that the voltage on the D data line will
drop and the voltage Q will increase above its initial zero value. The key design point
is that Q must not become larger than the threshold voltage of MN2, so that MN2 re-
mains cut off during the read phase. This will ensure that there is not a change in the
data stored in the cell.
At the initial time the cell is addressed, we can assume that the D bit line remains
at approximately VDD, since the line capacitance cannot change instantaneously. The
pass transistor MA is biased in the saturation region and the transistor MN1 is biased
in the nonsaturation region. Setting the drain currents through MA and MN1 equal,
we have
KnA(VDD −Q −VT N)2 = Kn1[2(VDD −VT N)Q −Q2]
(16.81)
Setting Q = Qmax = VT N as our design limit, then from Equation (16.81), we ﬁnd
the relation between the transistor width-to-length ratios to be
(W/L)nA
(W/L)n1

(VDD −2VT N)2
(16.82)
Assumingthat VDD = 3 Vand VT N = 0.5 V,weﬁndthat(W/L)nA/(W/L)n1 < 0.56.
So the width-to-length of the pass transistor should be approximately one-half that of

the NMOS device in the memory cell. By symmetry, the same condition applies to
the transistors MN2 and MB.
We now need to consider the write operation. Assume that a logic 0 is stored and
we want to write a logic 1 into the memory cell. Figure 16.78 shows the initial volt-
age levels in the CMOS SRAM cell when the cell is ﬁrst addressed at the beginning
of the write cycle. Transistors MP1 and MN2 are initially turned off, and MN1 and
MP2 are biased in the nonsaturation region. The cell voltages are Q = 0 and
¯Q = VDD just before the pass transistors are turned on. The data line D is held at
VDD and the complementary data line ¯D is forced to a logic 0 value by the write cir-
cuitry. We may assume that ¯D = 0 V for analysis purposes. The voltage Q will
remain below the threshold voltage of MN2 because of the condition given by Equa-
tion (16.82). Consequently, the voltage at Q is not sufﬁcient to switch the state of the
memory cell. To switch the state of the cell, the voltage at ¯Q must be reduced below
the threshold voltage of MN1, so that MN1 will turn off. When ¯Q = VT N , then MB is
biased in the nonsaturation region and MP2 is biased in the saturation region. Equat-
ing drain currents, we have

tor is one-half that of the NMOS in the memory cell, and if we assume that the width-
to-length of the PMOS in the memory cell is 0.7 that of the pass transistor, then the
width-to-length of the PMOS in the cell should be approximately 0.35 that of the NMOS
in the memory cell.

SRAM Read/Write Circuitry
An example of a read/write circuit at the end of a column is shown in Figure 16.79.
We may consider the write portion of the circuit as shown in Figure 16.80(a). We
may note that if the column is not selected, then M3 is cut off and the two data lines
are held at their precharged value of VDD. When X = Y = 1, then the one-bit cell
shown is addressed. If ¯W = 1 then the write cycle is deselected and both M1 and M2
are cut off. For ¯W = 0 and D = 1, M1 is cut off and M2 is turned on so that the ¯D
data line is pulled low while the D data line remains high. The logic 1 is then written
into the cell. For ¯W = 0 and D = 0, the D data line is pulled low and the ¯D data line
is held high so that logic 0 is written into the cell.

Figure 16.79 Complete circuit diagram of a CMOS RAM cell with write and read circuitry

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits
1219
Figure 16.80(b) shows the NMOS cross-coupled sense ampliﬁer that is in the
complete circuit of Figure 16.79. This circuit does not generate an output signal, but
rather ampliﬁes the small difference in the data bit lines. Suppose that a logic 1 is to
be read from the memory cell. When the cell is addressed, the D bit line is high and
the ¯D bit line voltage begins to decrease. This means that when the M3 transistor
turns on, the M2 transistor turns on harder than M1 so that the ¯D bit line voltage is
pulled low and the M1 transistor will eventually turn off.
Figure 16.80(c) shows the differential ampliﬁer that senses the output of the
memory cell. Note that this sense ampliﬁer is connected to the bit lines through a
couple of pass transistors, as seen in Figure 16.79. If the input signal to the pass tran-
sistors is also a function of the column select signal, then this conﬁguration enables
the use of one main sense ampliﬁer to read the data out of several columns, one at a
time. When the clock signal is zero, the M3 transistor in the differential ampliﬁer is
cut off and the common source node of M1 and M2 is pulled high, which means the
output voltage is pulled high. When a memory cell is selected and the clock goes
high, M3 turns on. If a logic 1 level is to be read, then D remains high and the ¯D line

voltage decreases. This means that the M2 transistor will turn off and the output volt-
age remains high. If a logic 0 is to be read, then the D line voltage decreases and ¯D
remains high. The transistor M1 will turn off while M2 is turned on so that the output
voltage goes low.
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) Cells
The CMOS RAM cell just considered requires six transistors and ﬁve lines connect-
ing each cell, including the power and ground connections. A substantial area, then,
is required for each memory cell. If the area per cell could be reduced, then higher-
density RAM arrays would be possible.
In a dynamic RAM cell, a bit of data is stored as charge on a capacitor, where the
presence or absence of charge determines the value of the stored bit. Data stored as
charge on capacitors cannot be retained indeﬁnitely, since leakage currents will even-
tually remove the stored charge. Thus the name dynamic refers to the situation in
which a periodic refresh cycle is required to maintain the stored data.
One design of a DRAM cell is the one-transistor cell that includes a pass tran-
sistor MS plus a storage capacitor CS, shown in Figure 16.81. Binary information is
stored in the form of zero charge on CS (logic 0) and stored charge on CS (logic 1).
The cell is addressed by turning on the pass transistor via the word line signal WL
and charges are transferred into or out of CS on the bit line BL. The storage capaci-
tor is isolated from the rest of the circuit when MS is off, but the stored charge on CS
decreases because of the leakage current through the pass transistor. This effect was
discussed in detail in Section 16.6 during the analysis of the NMOS pass transistor.
As a result of this leakage, the cell must be refreshed regularly to restore its original
condition.
16.9.4
An example of a sense ampliﬁer to detect the charge stored in the memory cell
is shown in Figure 16.82. On one side of the ampliﬁer is a memory cell that either
stores a full charge or is empty, depending on the binary value of the data. On the
other side of the ampliﬁer is a reference cell with a reference or dummy storage ca-
pacitor CR that is one-half the value of the storage capacitor. The charge on CR will
then be one-half the logic 1 charge on CS. A cross-coupled dynamic latch circuit is
used to detect the small voltage differences and to restore the signal levels. The ca-
pacitors CD and CDR represent the relatively large parasitic bit line and reference bit
line capacitances.
In the standby mode, the bit lines on both sides of the sense ampliﬁer are
precharged to the same potential. During the read cycle, both the WL and D–WL

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits
1221
address signals go high allowing the charges in the cells to be redistributed along the
bit lines. After the charge equalization and since the charge in the dummy cell is half
the full charge, then v1 < v2 when the memory cell is empty or a logic 0, and v1 > v2
when the memory cell is full or a logic 1. The sense ampliﬁer detects and ampliﬁes
the voltage difference between the bit lines, and will latch at the logic level stored in
the basic memory cell.

Figure 16.83 An NMOS 16 × 1 mask-programmable ROM
ROM and PROM Cells
We consider two types of ROMs. The ﬁrst example is a mask-programmed ROM, in
which contacts to devices are selectively included or excluded in the ﬁnal manufac-
turing process to obtain the desired memory pattern. Figure 16.83 shows an example
of an NMOS 16 × 1 mask-programmed ROM. Enhancement-mode NMOS transis-
tors are fabricated in each of the 16 cell positions (the substrate connections are
omitted for clarity). However, gate connections are fabricated only on selected tran-
sistors. The transistors M1–M4 are column-select transistors and M0 is a depletion-
mode load device.
The inputs X O, X1, YO, and Y1 are the row- and column-select signals. If, for
example, X O = ¯X1 = ¯YO = Y1 = 1, then the M12 transistor is addressed. Transis-
tors M12 and M3 turn on with this address, forcing the output to a logic 0. If the
address changes, for example, to ¯X O = X1 = ¯YO = ¯Y1 = 1, then the transistor M23
is addressed. However, this transistor does not have a gate connection and consequently
never turns on, so the output is a logic 1.
The mask-programmed memory discussed is only a 16 × 1-bit ROM, while a
more useful memory would contain many more bits. Memories can be organized in
any desired manner, such as a 2048 × 8 for a 16-K memory. This ROM is a non-
volatile memory, since the data stored are not lost when power is removed.
The second example of a ROM is a user-programmed ROM. The data pattern is
deﬁned by the user after the ﬁnal manufacture rather than during the manufacture.

Figure 16.84 A bipolar fuse-linked user-programmable ROM
One speciﬁc type is shown schematically in Figure 16.84. A small fuse is in series
with each emitter and can be selectively “blown” or left in place by the user. If, for
example, the fuse in Q00 is left in place and this transistor is addressed by
X O = X1 = YO = Y1 = 1, then Q00 turns on, raising the data line voltage at the
emitter of Q00. The inverter N1 is enabled, making the output a logic 0. If the fuse is
blown in this transistor, then the input to the inverter is a logic 0, so the output is a
logic 1.
The polysilicon fuse in the emitter of an npn bipolar transistor has a fairly low
resistance, so with the fuse in place and at low currents, there is very little voltage
drop across the fuse. When the current through the fuse is increased to the 20 to
30 mA range, the heating of the polysilicon fuse causes the temperature to increase.
The silicon oxidizes, forming an insulator that effectively opens the path between the
data line and the emitter. The bipolar ROM circuit with the fuses either in place or
“blown” form a permanent ROM that is not alterable and is also nonvolatile.

EPROM and EEPROM Cells
An EPROM transistor is shown in Figure 16.85. The device has a double gate, with
gate 1 being a “ﬂoating gate” that has no electrical contact. Gate 2 is used for cell
selection, taking the role of the single gate of an MOS transistor.
Operation of this EPROM cell relies on being able to store charge on the ﬂoat-
ing gate. Initially, we assume no charge on the ﬂoating gate so that with gate 2, drain,
and source grounded, the potential of gate 1 is also zero. As the voltage on gate 2 in-
creases, the gate 1 voltage rises also, but at a lower rate as determined by the capac-
itive divider. The net effect of this is to effectively raise the threshold voltage of this
MOSFET as seen from gate 2. However, when the gate 2 voltage is raised sufﬁciently
(approximately twice the normal threshold voltage), a channel forms. Under these
conditions, the device provides a stored logic 0 when used in the NOR array.
To write a logic 1 into this cell, both gate 2 and drain are raised to about 25 V
while the source and substrate remain at ground potential. A relatively large drain
current ﬂows because of normal device conduction characteristics. In addition, the
high ﬁeld in the drain–substrate depletion region results in avalanche breakdown of
the drain–substrate junction, with a considerable additional ﬂow of current. The high
ﬁeld in the drain depletion region accelerates electrons to high velocity such that a
small fraction traverse the thin oxide and become trapped on gate 1. When the gate 2
and drain potentials are reduced to zero, the negative charge on gate 1 forces its po-
tential to approximately −5 V. If the gate 2 voltage for reading is limited to +5 V,
then a channel never forms. Thus a logic 1 is stored in the cell.
Gate 1 is completely surrounded by silicon dioxide (SiO2), an excellent insula-
tor, so charge can be stored for many years. Data can be erased, however, by expos-
ing the cells to strong ultraviolet (UV) light. The UV radiation generates
electron–hole pairs in the SiO2 making the material slightly conductive. The negative
charge on the gate can then leak off, restoring the transistor to its original uncharged
condition. These EPROMs must be assembled in packages with transparent covers so

the silicon chip may be exposed to UV radiation. One disadvantage is that the entire
memory must be erased before any reprogramming can be done. In general, repro-
gramming must also be done on specialized equipment; therefore, the EPROM must
be removed from the circuit during this operation.
In the EEPROM, each individual cell can be erased and reprogrammed without
disturbing any other cell. The most common form of EEPROM is also a ﬂoating gate
structure; one example is shown in Figure 16.86(a). The memory transistor is similar
to an n-channel MOSFET, but with a physical difference in the gate insulator region.
Charge may exist on the ﬂoating gate that will alter the threshold voltage of the de-
vice. If a net positive charge exists on the ﬂoating gate, the n-channel MOSFET is
turned on, whereas if zero or negative charge exists on the ﬂoating gate, the device is
turned off.
The ﬂoating gate is capacitively coupled to the control gate with the tunnel oxide
thickness less than 200 Å. If 20V is applied to the control gate while keeping VD = 0,
electrons tunnel from the n+-drain region to the ﬂoating gate as demonstrated in
Figure 16.86(b). This puts the MOSFET in the enhancement mode with a threshold
voltage of approximately 10 V, so the device is effectively off. If zero volts is applied
to the control gate and 20 V is applied to the drain terminal, then electrons tunnel
from the ﬂoating gate to the n+-drain terminal as demonstrated in Figure 16.86(c).
This leaves a net positive charge on the ﬂoating gate that puts the device in the de-
pletion mode with a threshold voltage of approximately −2 V, so the device is effec-
tively on. If all voltages are kept to within 5 V during the read cycle, this structure can
retain its charge for many years.

DATA CONVERTERS
Objective: • Discuss the basic concepts in A/D and D/A converters.
Most physical signals exist in analog form. These signals include, for example, audio
or speech and the output of transducer circuits. Some analog signal processing, such
as amplifying the output of a microphone prior to the connection to speakers, may
occur. However, digital signal processing may be required to convert an analog sig-
nal into digital form prior to transmission of the signal to a satellite receiver, for ex-
ample. Therefore, analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters are
an important class of integrated circuits.
Basic A/D and D/A Concepts
In this section, we brieﬂy consider a few basic concepts used in A/D and D/A con-
versions. Figure 16.87 shows the block diagram representations of A/D and D/A
converters. An analog signal vA is applied to the input of the A/D converter and the
output is an N-bit digital signal that can be represented as
vD = b1
21 + b2
22 + b3
23 + · · · + bN
2N
(16.85)
where b1, b2, etc. are the bit coefﬁcients that are either a 1 or 0. The bit b1 is the most
signiﬁcant bit (MSB) and the bit bN is the least signiﬁcant bit (LSB). The input to the
D/A converter is the N-bit digital signal and the output is an analog signal v′
A. Ideally,
the output analog signal v′
A is an exact replication of the input analog signal vA.
16.11.1
The analog signal is to be converted to a digital form as indicated in Equa-
tion (16.85). Consider, for example, an analog signal represented by a voltage in the
range 0 ≤vA ≤5 V. Assume the digital signal is a 6-bit word. The 6-bit word repre-
sents 64 discrete values. The analog signal will then be divided into 64 values, with
each bit representing 5 V/64 = 0.078125 V. The analog-to-digital conversion can be
visualized in Figure 16.88.
When the analog input voltage is, for example, vA =
5
64 V, the digital output is
000001 and when the analog input voltage is vA = 2( 5
64) V, the digital output is
000010. However, we see that when the input is in the range 1
2( 5
64) < vA < 3
2( 5
64) V,
the digital output is constant at vD = 000001. There is an inherent quantization error
in the A/D conversion. A larger number of bits in the digital signal reduces the quan-
tization error, but requires a more complex circuit.
The same effect occurs at the output of the D/A converter. Since the digital input
signal exists in discrete steps or increments, the output signal will also occur in
discrete steps or increments. An example is shown in Figure 16.89. The output signal

ﬁlter to smooth out the signal to produce the dotted signal v′′

sired result is that the signal v′′
A be as close to the original signal vA as possible.
Digital-to-Analog Converters
We will consider a few basic D/A converters to gain an appreciation of the techniques
used in these circuits.
Weighted-Resistor 4-Bit D/A
A simple circuit for a 4-bit D/A converter was shown in Chapter 9 in Figure P9.37.
This circuit is repeated here in Figure 16.90 for convenience. The circuit is a sum-
ming ampliﬁer and includes a reference voltage VR, four weighted input resistors,
four switches, and an op-amp with a feedback resistor. With RF = 10 k, we ﬁnd
the output voltage to be

Figure 16.91 Example of a current switch in the MSB position in a weighted resistor of D/A
converter
One factor that determines the accuracy of the circuit is the precision of the
weighted input resistors and the feedback resistor. As the number of bits increases,
the size of the weighted input resistance increases for the lesser signiﬁcant bits. The
accuracy for large resistance values becomes more difﬁcult to maintain. The size of
this D/A converter is in general limited to a 4-bit input.
Another factor that determines the accuracy of the D/A circuit is the precision of the
switches. An example of a current switch, showing only the MSB, is shown in Figure
16.91. If the bit b1 is a logic 1 (>VBias), then QB1 is turned on and Q R is turned off so
that the current IR is switched through QB1. This current becomes a component of the
current through the feedback resistor. If b1 is a logic 0 (<VBias), then QB1 is turned off
and Q R is turned on so that the current is switched to ground. Because of the virtual
ground, we may note that the collector voltages of QB1 and Q R are essentially identical.
For the circuit to operate properly, the base-emitter voltage of all the transistors
must be the same. Since the currents are smaller for the lesser signiﬁcant bits, the
base–emitter areas must be reduced in order to maintain the same current density.
The type of circuit shown in Figure 16.91 then requires a wide range of base–emitter
areas in the same way that it requires a wide range of weighted resistor values.
R–2R Ladder Network D/A
A circuit that eliminates the wide spread in weighted input resistor values in the
previous circuit is an R–2R ladder resistive network. Consider the circuit shown in
Figure 16.92. Assuming the switches are ideal, the current in each resistor is a
constant because of the virtual ground concept.
Consider node X in the circuit. We can note that the resistance denoted as RX is
RX = 2R. This same resistance occurs at every node in the circuit as indicated on the
ﬁgure. Therefore, the current entering each node splits evenly as shown at node X.
We have that IN−1 = 1
2 IN−2. This effect again occurs at every node in the circuit.
Therefore, we have
I1 = 2I2 = 4I3 = · · · = 2N−2IN−1 = 2N−1IN
(16.87)
Setting the feedback resistance to RF = R, we have the output voltage given by

The circuit in Figure 16.92 requires only two resistance values. These resistance
values can then be held to tight tolerances.
There are a variety of D/A converter designs that will not be pursued in this text.
This short discussion provides a brief introduction to D/A design.
Analog-to-Digital Converters
As in the previous section, we will consider a few basic A/D converters to gain an ap-
preciation of the techniques used in these circuits.
Parallel or Flash A/D
The fastest A/D converter, and perhaps simplest in concept, is the parallel A/D or
ﬂash converter. Figure 16.93 shows a 3-bit ﬂash A/D converter. The analog input sig-
nal vA is applied to seven comparators at the noninverting terminals. A reference
voltage is applied to a resistive ladder network. The outputs of the ladder network are
applied to the inverting terminals of the comparators.
The total resistance in the ladder network is 8R so VREF/8R represents 1 LSB in
terms of current. The smallest output voltage is
v1 = VREF
8R

(16.90)
which represents 1 1
2 LSB.
If the analog input is vA < 1
2 LSB, the output of all comparators will be low. If
the analog input is 1
2 LSB < vA < 1 1
2 LSB, the output of the ﬁrst comparator goes
high. As the analog input voltage increases, the outputs of additional comparators
go high. The combinational logic network then produces the desired 3-bit output
word. We can note that a complete conversion is obtained during one clock period.
A disadvantage of the ﬂash A/D converter is that the number of resistors and
comparators increases rapidly as the desired number of output bits increases. We
see that 2N resistors and 2N −1 comparators are required. Thus, for a 10 bit word,

1024 resistors and 1023 comparators are required. However, 10-bit resolution A/D
ﬂash converters have been fabricated as ICs.
Counting A/D
A second type of A/D converter is the counting converter. This system contains a
comparator, a counter, and a D/A converter in a feedback conﬁguration as shown in
Figure 16.94(a). Additional control circuitry is not shown for simplicity.
Initially the output of the counter is set equal to zero and the output of the D/A
converter is set to vO = 1
2 LSB. When an analog input voltage vA is applied, the out-
put of the comparator is high (unless vA < 1
2 LSB), which enables the counter. Then
for each clock pulse, the output of the counter increases by one, producing an N-bit
digital output. When the output of the D/A becomes just greater than the analog
input voltage, the output of the comparator goes low and the counter is disabled. The
N-bit digital output then corresponds to the analog input signal.
Figure 16.94(b) shows the timing diagram of a counting converter for a 4-bit
digital output. Assume that the analog input signal is in the range 0 ≤vA ≤5 V.
A 1 LSB then corresponds to 5
16 V.
Assume the analog input signal is vA = 5.2( 5
16) V. The initial output of the D/A,
as mentioned, is a 1
2 LSB offset voltage. By including the offset voltage, the maximum

quantization error will then be ± 1
2 LSB. We see from Figure 16.94(b) that after the
ﬁfth clock pulse, the output of the D/A is
vO = 1

(16.91)
which is larger than vA. The counter then stops counting and the digital output is 0101.
We can note that the digital output corresponds to 5( 5
16) V, which is within 1
2 LSB of
the analog input signal.
To complete the conversion process, the clock must go through its complete
cycle, which for a 4-bit output is 16 clock periods.
Dual-Slope A/D
Another type of A/D conversion scheme is the dual-slope A/D converter shown in
Figure 16.95(a). This type of converter is found in high-resolution data acquisition
systems, for example, since 20-bit conversions can be achieved.

Digital Electronics
From Figure 16.95(a), at t = 0, the reset switch S1 opens and a negative input
signal (−v′
A) is applied to the integrator. The input signal v′
A is a sampled portion of
the analog signal vA and hence is a constant during the conversion process. The out-
put vO1 of the integrator is a positive linear signal as shown in the timing diagram in
Figure 16.95(b). The slope of the signal is proportional to the value of v′
A. This por-
tion of the conversion process continues for a ﬁxed time T1, at which time the counter
has reached its maximum value and overﬂows.
At this time, the input switch S2 changes to a positive input reference voltage
VREF. The output of the integrator starts at the peak output voltage reached at T1 and
now has a negative slope. The counter has been reset and is now counting. The count-
ing stops when the output voltage vO1 reaches zero.

A by

The output of the counter is then the digital equivalent of v′
A.
The output of the dual-slope A/D converter is independent of the actual values of
R and C and hence is very accurate. The disadvantage of this data converter is that it
is a fairly slow system. The time T1 requires 2N clock pulses and the maximum pos-
sible time T2 would also require 2N clock pulses. For example, a 12-bit A/D con-
verter would require a total of 8192 clock pulses. This corresponds to a conversion
time of 8.2 ms for a 1 MHz clock.
16.12 DESIGN APPLICATION: A STATIC CMOS
LOGIC GATE
Objective: • Design a static CMOS logic gate to implement a speciﬁc
logic function.
Speciﬁcations: A static CMOS logic gate is to be designed that implements the
function of a three-input odd-parity checker. The output is to be high when an odd
number of inputs are high. The size of each transistor is to be determined so that the
switching speed is the same as that of a basic CMOS inverter with Wn = W and
Wp = 2W. A minimum number of transistors are to be used in the NMOS pull-down
and PMOS pull-up portions of the circuit.
Choices: We will assume that input signals A, B, and C as well as the complements
¯A, ¯B, and ¯C are available.
Solution (Logic Function): The output of the logic gate is to be high when one
input is high or when all three inputs are high. The output is to be high, for exam-
ple, when the inputs are A = 1 and B = C = 0. The output would be high, then,
for A ¯B ¯C = 1. Considering the other possibilities, the logic function can be 
written as
F = A ¯B ¯C + ¯AB ¯C + ¯A ¯BC + ABC

Solution (NMOS Pull-Down): Figure 16.96(a) shows the basic NMOS pull-down
portion of the logic gate derived from the logic function given in Equation (16.94).
However, we may note that the two transistors at the bottom of the ﬁrst two columns
have a common input of ¯C and the two transistors at the bottom of the last two
columns have a common input of C. The two transistors with common inputs can be
combined into a single transistor. The ﬁnal design of the NMOS pull-down portion
of the logic gate is shown in Figure 16.96(b).
In order for the NMOS portion of the circuit to be in the pull-down mode, three
NMOS devices in series must be turned on. In order for this circuit to be equivalent
to the NMOS in the CMOS inverter, each NMOS device must have a width of
Wn = 3W.
Solution (PMOS Pull-Up): Figure 16.97(a) shows the basic PMOS pull-up
portion of the logic gate. This circuit is the complement of the NMOS circuit
shown in Figure 16.96(a). We may note that two transistors on the right side of the
circuit have common inputs C and ¯C. Each pair of transistors is effectively in
series and hence can be replaced by a single transistor. The resulting circuit is
shown in Figure 16.97(b). The complete three-input odd-parity checker circuit
is then the combination of Figures 16.96(b) and 16.97(b) along with a CMOS
inverter on the output.
Comment: The basic logic circuit can be derived from the logic function.
However, as we have seen, some simplifications can be made in the design. These
simplifications can also be obtained from simplifications in the basic logic
function also.

SUMMARY
•
In this chapter, NMOS and CMOS digital logic circuits were analyzed and
designed. These circuits include basic logic gates, shift registers, ﬂip-ﬂops, and
memories.
•
The NMOS inverter is the basis of NMOS logic circuits. The quasi-static voltage
transfer characteristics of NMOS inverters with resistive-load, enhancement-
load, and depletion-load devices were generated.
•
The basic NMOS NOR and NAND logic gates were analyzed. More sophisti-
cated logic functions can be implemented by combining driver transistors in par-
allel and series combinations.
•
The CMOS inverter is the basis of CMOS logic circuits. The quasi-static voltage
transfer characteristics were generated. For the CMOS circuit, the quiescent
power dissipation is essentially zero when the input is in either logic state.
•
The basic CMOS NOR and NAND logic gates were analyzed. More sophisti-
cated CMOS logic circuits were also analyzed and designed. Transistor width-to-
length ratios were designed to provide equal current drive in the NMOS pull-
down and PMOS pull-up portions of the circuit.
•
CMOS clocked logic circuits can be designed to reduce the number of required
PMOS devices. A generalized NMOS logic circuit is inserted between clocked
PMOS and NMOS devices. The advantage of low static power dissipation is
maintained.
•
Sequential logic circuits, such as shift registers, ﬂip-ﬂops, and a full one-bit
adder, were analyzed.

Chapter 16 MOSFET Digital Circuits
1235
•
A whole classification of circuits called memories was considered. In the
NMOS SRAM, static power is continuously dissipated in the cell, which lim-
its the size of the memory because of the total chip power limitation. The pri-
mary advantage of a CMOS SRAM is that there is essentially no static power
dissipation. The size of a CMOS memory is limited primarily by chip area
requirements.
•
Read-only-memory (ROM and PROM) contains ﬁxed data that are implemented
by the manufacturer or by the user. In both cases, the data cannot be altered.
EPROM and EEPROM cells contain MOSFETs with ﬂoating gates that can be
either charged or left uncharged by the user depending on whether logic 1 or a
logic 0 is to be stored.
•
The basic concepts used in A/D and D/A converters were discussed. A few
examples of D/A converter circuits and A/D converter systems were analyzed.
•
As an application, a static CMOS logic circuit to implement a speciﬁc logic func-
tion is designed.

Bipolar Digital
Circuits
1255
In the previous chapter, we presented the basic concepts of MOSFET logic circuits.
In this chapter, we discuss the basic principles of bipolar logic circuits. We initially
consider emitter-coupled logic (ECL). This technology is based on the differential
ampliﬁer and is used in specialized high-speed applications.
Prior to the emergence of MOS digital technology, the bipolar digital family of
transistor–transistor logic (TTL) circuits was used extensively. TTL and low-power
Schottky TTL logic circuits are analyzed. The basic concepts of BiCMOS logic cir-
cuits are presented. 
Bipolar digital circuits are now used less frequently because of their relatively
large power requirements.

EMITTER-COUPLED LOGIC (ECL)
Objective: • Analyze the basic emitter-coupled logic circuits
The emitter-coupled logic (ECL) circuit is based on the differential ampliﬁer circuit,
which we studied in Chapter 11 in the context of linear ampliﬁers. In digital applica-
tions, the diff-amp is driven into its nonlinear region. The transistors are either cut off
or in the active region. Saturation is avoided in order to minimize switching times
and propagation delay times. ECL circuits have the shortest propagation delay times
of any bipolar digital technology.
Differential Ampliﬁer Circuit Revisited
Consider the basic diff-amp circuit in Figure 17.1. For a linear diff-amp, the differ-
ence between the two input voltages is small and both transistors remain biased
in the active region at all times. The relationship between collector currents and
base–emitter voltages for Q1 and Q2 can be written1
iC1 = ISevBE1/VT
(17.1(a))
and
iC2 = ISevBE2/VT
(17.1(b))
where Q1 and Q2 are assumed to be matched and parameter IS is the same for both
devices. The current–voltage transfer curves are shown in Figure 17.2.
In digital applications, the difference between the two input voltages is large,
which means that one transistor remains biased in its active region while the opposite

transistor is cut off. For example, if vBE1 = vBE2 + 0.12, then the ratio of iC1 and
iC2 is
iC1
iC2
= evBE1/VT
evBE2/VT = e(vBE1−vBE2)/VT = e0.12/0.026 = 101
(17.2)
When the base–emitter voltage of Q1 is 120 mV greater than the base–emitter volt-
age of Q2, the collector current of Q1 is 100 times that of Q2; for all practical
purposes, Q1 is on and Q2 is cut off.
Conversely, if v1 is less than v2 by at least 120 mV, then Q1 is effectively cut off and
Q2 is on. The difference ampliﬁer, when operating as a digital circuit, operates as a cur-
rent switch. When v1 > v2 by at least 120 mV, it switches an approximately constant
current through RE to Q1; when v2 > v1 by at least 120 mV, the current goes to Q2.
EXAMPLE 17.1
Objective: Calculate the currents and voltages in the basic differential ampliﬁer
circuit used as a digital circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 17.1. Assume that V + = 2.5 V, V −= −2.5 V,
RC1 = RC2 ≡RC = 5 k, RE = 6 k, and v2 = 0. Neglect base currents in the dc
analysis.
Solution: For v1 = v2 = 0, both transistors are on. Assume a base–emitter turn-on
voltage of 0.7 V; then vE = −0.7 V and
iE = vE −V −
RE
= −0.7 −(−2.5)
6
= 0.3 mA
Assuming Q1 and Q2 are matched, we have iC1 = iC2 = iE/2 so that iC1 = iC2 =
0.15 mA. Then
vO1 = vO2 = V + −iC RC = 2.5 −(0.15)(5) = 1.75 V
Both Q1 and Q2 are biased in the active region.
Now let v1 = −0.5 V. Since the base voltage of Q1 is less than the base voltage
of Q2 by more than 120 mV, then Q1 is cut off and Q2 is on. In this case,
vE = v2 −VBE(on) = −0.7 V and iE = 0.3 mA, as before. However, iC1 = 0 and
iC2 = iE = 0.3 mA, so that
vO1 = V + = 2.5 V
and
vO2 = V + −iC2RC = 2.5 −(0.3)(5) = 1.0 V
For 
v1 = +0.5 V, 
Q1
is 
on 
and 
Q2
is 
cut 
off. 
For 
this 
case,
vE = v1 −VBE(on) = 0.5 −0.7 = −0.2 V and the current iE is
iE = iC1 = vE −V −
RE
= −0.2 −(−2.5)
6
= 0.383 mA
Then
vO1 = V + −iC1RC = 2.5 −(0.383)(5) = 0.585 V
and
vO2 = V + = 2.5 V

1258
Part 3
Digital Electronics
Comment: For the three conditions given, transistors Q1 and Q2 are biased either in
cutoff or in the active region. In terms of digital applications, output vO2 is in phase
with input v1 and output vO1 is 180 degrees out of phase.
When biased on, transistor Q1 conducts slightly more heavily than Q2 when it
is conducting. To obtain symmetrical complementary outputs, RC1 should therefore
be slightly smaller than RC2.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.1: Consider the differential ampliﬁer circuit in Figure 17.1 biased at V + =
1.8 V, V −= −1.8 V, and v2 = 0. Assume VBE(on) = 0.7 V and neglect base
currents. (a) Design the circuit such that iE = 0.11 mA and vO1 = vO2 = 1.45 V
when v1 = 0. (b) Using the results of part (a), determine iE, vO1, and vO2 for (i)
v1 = +0.5 V and (ii) v1 = −0.5 V. (c) Using the results of parts (a) and (b), cal-
culate the power dissipated in the circuit for (i) v1 = +0.5 V and (ii) v1 = −0.5 V.
(Ans. (a) RE = 10 k, RC = 6.364 k; (b) (i) iE = 0.16 mA, vO1 = 0.782 V,
vO2 = 1.8 V; (ii) iE = 0.11 mA, vO1 = 1.8 V, vO2 = 1.10 V; (c) (i) P =0.576 mW,
(ii) P = 0.396 mW)
Basic ECL Logic Gate
Basic ECL Logic Gate
A basic two-input ECL OR/NOR logic circuit is shown in Figure 17.3. The two input
transistors, Q1 and Q2, are connected in parallel. On the basis of the differential
ampliﬁer, if both vX and vY are less than the reference voltage VR (by at least
120 mV), then both Q1 and Q2 are cut off, while the reference transistor Q R is biased
on its active region. In this situation, the output voltage vO1 is greater than vO2. If
either vX or vY becomes greater than VR, then Q R turns off and vO2 becomes larger
than vO1. The OR logic is at the vO2 output and the NOR logic is at the vO1 output.
An advantage of ECL gates is the availability of complementary outputs, precluding
the need for separate inverters to provide the complementary outputs.
One problem with the OR/NOR circuit in Figure 17.3 is that the output voltage
levels differ from the required input voltage levels; the output voltages are not

compatible with the input voltages. The mismatch arises because ECL circuit
transistors operate between their cutoff and active regions, requiring that the
base–collector junctions be reverse biased at all times. We see that a logic 1 voltage
of the output is VO H = V +. If this voltage were to be applied to either the vX or vY
input, then either Q1 or Q2 would turn on and the collector voltage vO1 would
decrease below V +; the base–collector voltage would then become forward biased
and the transistor would go into saturation. Emitter-follower circuits are added to
provide outputs that are compatible with the inputs of similar gates.
ECL Logic Gate with Emitter Followers
In the ECL circuit in Figure 17.4, emitter followers are added to the OR/NOR outputs,
and supply voltage V + is set equal to zero. The ground and power supply voltages are
reversed because analyses show that using the collector–emitter voltage as the output re-
sults in less noise sensitivity. If the forward current gain of the transistors is on the order
of 100, then the dc base currents may be neglected with little error in the calculations.
If either vX or vY is a logic 1 (deﬁned as greater than VR by at least 120 mV), then
the reference transistor Q R is cut off, iC R = 0, and vO2 = 0. Output transistor Q3 is bi-
ased in the active region, and vO R = vO2 −VBE(on) = −0.7 V. If both vX and vY are
a logic 0 (deﬁned as less than VR by at least 120 mV), then both Q1 and Q2 are cut off,
vO1 = 0, and vNOR = 0 −VBE(on) = −0.7 V. The largest possible voltage that can
be achieved at either output is −0.7 V; therefore, −0.7 V is deﬁned as the logic 1 level.
In the following example, we will determine the currents and the logic 0 values
in the basic ECL gate.

Objective: Calculate current, resistor, and logic 0 values in the basic ECL logic gate.
Consider the circuit in Figure 17.4. Determine RC1 and RC2 such that when Q1
and Q2 are conducting, the B–C voltages are zero.
Solution: Let vX = vY = −0.7 V = logic 1 > VR such that Q1 and Q2 are on. We
ﬁnd that
vE = vX −VBE(on) = −0.7 −0.7 = −1.4 V

and the current is
iE = iCxy = vE −V −
RE
= −1.4 −(−5.2)
1.18
= 3.22 mA
In order for the B–C voltages of Q1 and Q2 to be zero, voltage vO1 must be −0.7 V.
Therefore
RC1 = −vO1
ICxy
= 0.7
3.22 = 0.217 k
The NOR output logic 0 value is then
vNOR = vO1 −VBE(on) = −0.70 −0.7 = −1.40 V
Input voltages vX and vY are greater than VR in a logic 1 state and less than VR
in a logic 0 state. If VR is set at the midpoint between the logic 0 and logic 1 levels,
then
VR = −0.7 −1.40
2
= −1.05 V
When Q R is on, we have
vE = VR −VBE(on) = −1.05 −0.7 = −1.75 V
and
iE = iC R = vE −V −
RE
= −1.75 −(−5.2)
1.18
= 2.92 mA
For vO2 = −0.7 V, we ﬁnd that
RC2 = −vO2
iC2
= 0.7
2.92 = 0.240 k
The OR logic 0 value is therefore
vOR = vO2 −VBE(on) = −0.7 −0.7 = −1.40 V
Comment: For symmetrical complementary outputs, RC1 and RC2 are not equal. If
RC1 and RC2 become larger than the designed values, transistors Q1, Q2, and Q R
will be driven into saturation when they are conducting.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.2: Using the results of Example 17.2, calculate the power dissipated in the
circuit in Figure 17.4; for: (a) vx = vy = logic 1, and (b) vx = vy = logic 0. (Ans.
(a) P = 45.5 mW (b) P = 43.9 mW)
The Reference Circuit
Another circuit is required to provide the reference voltage VR. Consider the com-
plete two-input ECL OR/NOR logic circuit shown in Figure 17.5. The reference cir-
cuit consists of resistors R1, R2, and R5, diodes D1 and D2, and transistor Q5. The
reference portion of the circuit can be speciﬁcally designed to provide the desired

DESIGN EXAMPLE 17.3
Objective: Design the reference portion of the ECL circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 17.5. The reference voltage VR is to be −1.05 V.
Solution: We know that
vB5 = VR + VBE(on) = −1.05 + 0.7 = −0.35 V = −i1R1
Since there are two unknowns, we will choose one variable. Let R1 = 0.25 k.
Then,
i1 = 0.35
0.25 = 1.40 mA
Since this current is on the same order of magnitude as other currents in the circuit,
the chosen value of R1 is reasonable. Neglecting base currents, we can now write
i1 = i2 = 0 −2Vγ −V −
R1 + R2
where Vγ is the diode turn-on voltage and is assumed to be Vγ = 0.7 V. We then
have
1.40 = −1.4 −(−5.2)
R1 + R2
which yields
R1 + R2 = 2.71 k
Since R1 = 0.25 k, resistance R2 is R2 = 2.46 k.

Also, we know that
i5 = VR −V −

If we let i5 = i1 = i2 = 1.40 mA, then
R5 = VR −V −

Comment: As with any design, there is no unique solution. The design presented
will provide the required reference voltage to the base of Q R.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.3: The reference circuit in Figure 17.5 is to be redesigned with V + = 0 and
V −= −3.3 V. The reference voltage is to be VR = −1.0 V and the currents are to
be i1 = i2 = i5 = 0.5 mA. (Ans. R1 = 0.6 k, R2 = 3.2 k, R5 = 4.6 k)
ECL Logic Circuit Characteristics
In this section, we will determine the power dissipation, fanout, and propagation
delay times for the ECL logic gate. We will also examine the advantage of using a
negative power supply.
Power Dissipation
Power dissipation is an important characteristic of a logic circuit. The power dissi-
pated in the basic ECL logic gate in Figure 17.5 is given by
PD = (iCxy + iC R + i5 + i1 + i3 + i4)(0 −V −)
(17.3)
EXAMPLE 17.4
Objective: Calculate the power dissipated in the ECL logic circuit.
Consider the circuit in Figure 17.5. Let vX = vY = −0.7 V = logic 1.
Solution: From our previous analysis, we have iCxy = 3.22 mA, iC R = 0, i5 =
1.40 mA, and i1 = 1.40 mA, and the output voltages are vOR = −0.7 V and vNOR =
−1.40 V. The currents i3 and i4 are
i3 = vOR −V −
R3
= −0.7 −(−5.2)
1.5
= 3.0 mA
and
i4 = vNOR −V −
R4
= −1.40 −(−5.2)
1.5
= 2.53 mA
The power dissipation is then
PD = (3.22 + 0 + 1.40 + 1.40 + 3.0 + 2.53)(5.2) = 60.0 mW
Comment: This power dissipation is signiﬁcantly larger than that in NMOS and
CMOS logic circuits. The advantage of ECL, however, is the short propagation delay
times, which can be less than 1 ns.
17.1.3

Chapter 17 Bipolar Digital Circuits
1263
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.4: Assume the maximum currents in Q3 and Q4 of the ECL circuit in
Figure 17.5 are to be 1.0 mA. (a) What are the required values of R3 and R4?
(b) Using the results of part (a), calculate the new power dissipated in the circuit
for vX = vY = −0.7 V. (Ans. (a) R3 = R4 = 4.5 k, (b) P = 40.8 mW)
Propagation Delay Time
The major advantage of ECL circuits is their small propagation delay time, on the
order of 1 ns or less. The two reasons for the short propagation delay times are:
(1) the transistors are not driven into saturation, which eliminates any charge storage
effects; and (2) the logic swing in the ECL logic gate is small (about 0.7 V), which
means that the voltages across the output capacitances do not have to change as much
as in other logic circuits. Also, the currents in the ECL circuit are relatively large,
which means that these capacitances can charge and discharge quickly. However, the
trade-offs for the small propagation delay time are higher power dissipation and
smaller noise margins.
ECL circuits are very fast, and they require that special attention be paid to trans-
mission line effects. Improperly designed ECL circuit boards can experience ringing
or oscillations. These problems have less to do with the ECL circuits than with the
interconnections between the circuits. Care must therefore be taken to terminate the
signal lines properly.
Fanout
Figure 17.6 shows the emitter-follower output stage of the OR output of an ECL
circuit used to drive the diff-amp input stage of an ECL load circuit. When vO R is a
logic 0, input load transistor Q′
1 is cut off, effectively eliminating any load current
from the driver output stage. With vO R at a logic 1 level, the input load transistor is

on and an input base current i′
L exists. (Up to this point, we have neglected dc base
currents; however, they are not zero.) The load current must be supplied through Q3,
whose base current is supplied through RC2. As the load current iL increases with the
addition of more load circuits, a voltage drop occurs across RC2 and the output volt-
age decreases. The maximum fanout is determined partially by the maximum ampli-
tude that the output voltage is allowed to drop from its ideal logic 1 value.
EXAMPLE 17.5
Objective: Calculate the maximum fanout of an ECL logic gate, based on dc load-
ing effects.
Consider the circuit in Figure 17.6. Assume the current gain of the transistors is
β = 50, which represents a worst-case scenario. Assume that the logic 1 level at the
OR output is allowed to decrease by 50 mV at most from a value of −0.70 V to
−0.75 V.
Solution: From the ﬁgure, we see that
i′
E = vOR −VBE(on) −V −

The input base current to the load transistor is

The total load current is therefore iL = Ni′

iB3 = i3 + iL

RC2

(17.4)
Also, from the ﬁgure we see that
i3 = vOR −V −
R3
= −0.75 −(−5.2)

= 2.967 mA
From Equation (17.4), the maximum fanout for this condition is
2.967 + N(0.0623)
51
= 0 −(−0.75 + 0.7)
0.24
which yields N = 122. The value of N must be rounded to the next lower integer.
Comment: This maximum fanout is based on dc conditions and is unrealistic. In
practice, the maximum fanout for ECL circuits is determined by the propagation
delay time. Each load circuit increases the load capacitance by approximately 3 pF.
A maximum fanout of about 15 is usually recommended to keep the propagation
delay time within speciﬁed limits.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
*Ex 17.5: If the fanout for the situation described in Example 17.5 is limited to
N = 10, how much does the OR output change from the no-load value of
−0.70 V? (Ans. vOR = −0.7170 V)

The Negative Supply Voltage
In classic ECL circuits, it is common practice to ground the positive terminal of the
supply voltage, reducing the noise signals at the output terminal. Figure 17.7(a) shows
an emitter-follower output stage with the supply voltage VCC in series with a noise
source Vn. The noise signal may be induced by the effect of switching currents inter-
acting with parasitic inductances and capacitances. The output voltage is measured
with respect to ground; therefore, if the positive terminal of VCC is grounded, voltage
Vo is taken as the output voltage. If the negative terminal of VCC is at ground, then V ′
o
is the output voltage.
To determine the effect of the noise voltage at the output, we assume that Q R is
cut off, and we evaluate the small-signal hybrid-π equivalent circuit shown in Fig-
ure 17.7(b).

Comment: The effect of noise on the collector–emitter output voltage Vo is much

the positive terminal of VCC is grounded. The noise insensitivity gained with a
negative power supply may be critical in a logic circuit with a low noise margin.
EXERCISE PROBLEM

the resistance R3 = 4.5 k. (Ans. Vo = −0.00621Vn, V ′
o = 0.9938Vn)
Voltage Transfer Characteristics
The voltage transfer curve indicates the circuit characteristics during transition
between the two logic states. The voltage transfer characteristics can also be used to
determine the noise margins.
DC Analysis
A good approximation of the voltage transfer characteristics can be derived from the
piecewise linear model of the two input transistors and the reference transistor.
Consider the ECL gate in Figure 17.5. If inputs vX and vY are a logic 0, or −1.40 V,
then Q1 and Q2 are cut off and vNOR = −0.7 V. The reference transistor Q R is on
and, as previously seen, iE = iC2 = 2.92 mA, vB3 = −0.70 V, and vOR = −1.40 V.
As long as vX = vY remains less than VR −0.12 = −1.17 V, the output voltages do
not change from these values. During the interval when the inputs are within 120 mV
of reference voltage VR, the output voltage levels vary.
When vX = vY = VR + 0.12 = −0.93 V, then Q1 and Q2 are on and Q R is off.
At this point, iE = iC1 = 3.03 mA, vB4 = −0.657 V, and vNOR = −1.36 V. As
determined previously, when vX = vY = −0.7 V, vNOR = −1.40 V. The voltage
transfer curves are shown in Figure 17.8.
Noise Margin
For the ECL gate, we deﬁne the threshold logic levels VI L and VI H as the points of
discontinuity in the voltage transfer curves. These values are VI L = −1.17 V and

VI H = −0.93 V. The high logic level is VO H = −0.7 V and the low logic value is
VOL = −1.40 V.
The noise margins are deﬁned as
NMH = VO H −VI H
(17.5(a))
and
NML = VI L −VOL
(17.5(b))
Using the results from Figure 17.8, we ﬁnd that NMH = 0.23 V and NML = 0.23 V.
The noise margins for the ECL circuit are considerably lower than those calculated
for NMOS and CMOS circuits.
Test Your Understanding
TYU 17.1 For the ECL logic gate shown in Figure 17.3, the bias voltages are
V + = 1.8 V, V −= −1.8 V , and VR = 0.75 V. Assume VBE(on) = 0.7 V and neglect
base currents. (a) Determine RE and RC2 such that iE = 0.8 mA and vO2 = 1.1 V
when vX = vY = logic 0 < VR. (b) Find RC1 such that vO1 = 1.1 V when vX =
vY = 1.1 V. What is iE for this case? (Ans. (a) RE = 2.31 k, RC2 = 0.875 k;
(b) iE = 0.951 mA, RC1 = 0.736 k)
TYU 17.2 Redesign the ECL circuit in Figure 17.4 such that the logic 0 values at the
vOR and vNOR terminals are −1.5 V. The maximum value of iE is to be 2.5 mA, and
the maximum values of i3 and i4 are to be 2.5 mA. The bias voltages are as shown.
Determine all resistor values and the value of VR. (Ans. RE = 1.52 k, RC1 =
320 , VR = −1.1 V, RC2 = 358 , R3 = R4 = 1.8 k)
17.2
MODIFIED ECL CIRCUIT CONFIGURATIONS
Objective: • Analyze and design modiﬁed emitter-coupled logic
circuits
The large power dissipation in the basic ECL logic gate makes this circuit impracti-
cal for large-scale integrated circuits. Certain modiﬁcations can simplify the circuit
design and decrease the power consumption, making the ECL more compatible with
integrated circuits.
Low-Power ECL
Figure 17.9(a) shows a basic ECL OR/NOR logic gate with reference voltage VR and
a positive voltage supply. We can make the output voltage states compatible with the
input voltages, eliminating the need for the emitter-follower output stages. In some
applications, both complementary outputs may not be required. If, for example, only
the OR output is required, then we can eliminate resistor RC1. Removing this resis-
tor does not reduce the circuit power consumption, but it eliminates one element.
Figure 17.9(b) shows the modiﬁed ECL gate. For vX = vY = logic 1 > VR,
transistors Q1 and Q2 are turned on and Q R is off. The output voltage is vOR = VCC.
17.2.1

1268
Part 3
Digital Electronics
For vX = vY = logic 0 < VR, then Q1 and Q2 are off and Q R is on. The currents are
iE = VR −VBE(on)
RE
∼= iC R
(17.6)
and the output voltage is
vOR = VCC −iC R RC2
(17.7)
If the resistance values of RE and RC2 vary from one circuit to another because of
fabrication tolerances, then current iE and the logic 0 output voltage will vary from
one circuit to another.
To establish a well-deﬁned logic 0 output, we can insert a Schottky diode in
parallel with resistor RC, as shown in Figure 17.10. If the two inputs are a logic 0,
then Q1 and Q2 are off and Q R is on. For this condition, we want the Schottky diode
to turn on. The output will then be vOR = VCC −Vγ , where Vγ is the turn-on volt-
age of the Schottky diode. This logic 0 output voltage is a well-deﬁned value. If the
diode turns on, then current iR is limited to iR(max) = Vγ /RC. Since we must have
iE > iR(max), the diode current is iD = iE −iR(max).
As usual, we design the reference voltage to be the average of the logic 1 and logic
0 values. The voltage VR is then VR = VCC −Vγ /2. We may assume Vγ = 0.4 V.

biased by 0.2 V. When Q R is conducting, its collector voltage is VCC −Vγ , which
means that the B–C junction is now forward-biased by 0.2 V and the transistor is biased
slightly in saturation. However, this slight saturation bias does not degrade the switch-
ing of Q R, so the fast switching characteristics of the ECL circuit are retained.
EXAMPLE 17.7
Objective: Analyze the modiﬁed ECL logic gate.
Consider the circuit in Figure 17.10 with parameters VCC = 1.7 V and RE =
RC = 8 k. Assume the diode and transistor piecewise linear parameters are
Vγ = 0.4 V and VBE(on) = 0.7 V.
Solution: The output voltage values are
vOR = logic 1 = VCC = 1.7 V
and
vOR = logic 0 = VCC −Vγ = 1.7 −0.4 = 1.3 V
For the output voltages to be compatible with the inputs, the reference voltage VR
must be the average of the logic 1 and logic 0 values, or VR = 1.5 V. If vX = vY =
logic 0 = 1.3 V, then Q R is on. Therefore,
iE = VR −VBE(on)
RE
= 1.5 −0.7
8
⇒100 μA
The maximum current in RC is
iR(max) = Vγ
RC
= 0.4
8 ⇒50 μA
and the current through the diode is
iD = iE −iR(max) = 100 −50 = 50 μA
For vX = vY = logic 0, the power dissipation is P = iEVCC, or
P = iEVCC = (100)(1.7) = 170 μW
For vX = vY = logic 1 = 1.7 V, we have
iE = vX −VBE(on)
RE
= 1.7 −0.7
8
⇒125 μA
Therefore, the power dissipation for this condition is
P = iEVCC = (125)(1.7) = 213 μW
Comment: If the resistance values of RE and RC were to change by as much as
±20 percent as a result of manufacturing tolerances, for example, the currents would
still be sufﬁcient to turn the Schottky diode on when Q R is on. This means that the
logic 0 output is well deﬁned. Also, the power dissipation in this ECL gate is consid-
erably less than that in the classic ECL OR/NOR logic circuit. The reduced power is
a result of fewer components, lower bias voltage, and smaller currents.

the two transistors. We can therefore replace Q′
2 and Q′′
2 by a single multiemitter
transistor.
In Figure 17.13, the multiemitter transistor QO is part of the driver circuit. The
operation of the circuit is as follows:
• vx = vy = logic 1 = 1.7 V: The two input transistors Q1 and Q2 are on, Q R
is off, and vO = 1.7 V. Since the base voltage of QO is higher than the base
voltages of Q′
R and Q′′
R, then QO is conducting, Q′
R and Q′′
R are off, and
v′
E = v′′
E = 1.7 −0.7 = 1.0 V. The currents i′
E and i′′
E ﬂow through the emit-
ters of QO. The output voltages are v′
O = v′′
O = 1.7 V.
• vx = vy = logic 0 = 1.3 V: For this case, the two input transistors Q1 and
Q2 are off, Q R is on, and vO = 1.3 V. The output transistor QO is off and
both Q′
R and Q′′
R are on. The output voltages are then v′
O = v′′
O = 1.3 V.
The two load circuits in Figure 17.13 each have only a single input, which limits
the circuit functionality. The versatility of the circuit can be further enhanced by
making the load transistor Q′
R a multiemitter transistor. This is shown in Fig-
ure 17.14. For simplicity, we show only a single input transistor to each of the two

driver circuits. The operation of this circuit for various combinations of input volt-
ages is as follows.
• v1 = v2 = logic 0 = 1.3 V: The two input transistors Q1 and Q2 are off and
the two reference transistors Q R1 and Q R2 are on. This means that
vO1 = vO2 = 1.3 V and both output transistors QO1 and QO2 are off. Both
emitters of Q′
R are forward biased, currents iE1 and iE2 ﬂow through Q′
R, and
the output voltage is v′
O = logic 0 = 1.3 V.
• v1 = 1.7 V, v2 = 1.3 V: For this case, Q1 is on, Q R1 is off, Q2 is off, and Q R2
is on. The output voltages are vO1 = 1.7 V and vO2 = 1.3 V. This means that
QO1 is on and QO2 is off. With QO1 on, current iE1 ﬂows through QO1 and
no current ﬂows in emitter E1. With QO2 off, emitter E2 is forward biased,
current iE2 ﬂows through Q′
R, and the output voltage is v′
O = logic 0 = 1.3 V.
• v1 = 1.3 V, v2 = 1.7 V: This case is the complement of the one just dis-
cussed. Here, QO1 is off and QO2 is on. This means that iE1 ﬂows through
emitter E1 of Q′
R, and iE2 ﬂows through QO2. The output voltage is
v′
O = logic 0 = 1.3 V.
• v1 = v2 = 1.7 V: The two input transistors Q1 and Q2 are on, the two refer-
ence transistors Q R1 and Q R2 are off, and vO1 = vO2 = 1.7 V. This means that
both QO1 and QO2 are on and Q′
R is off. Currents iE1 and iE2 ﬂow through
QO1 and QO2, respectively, and the output voltage is v′
O = logic 1 = 1.7 V.

These results are summarized in Table 17.1, which shows that this circuit
performs the AND logic function. A more complicated or sophisticated logic func-
tion can be performed if multiple inputs are used in the driver circuits.
In integrated circuits, resistors RE are replaced by current sources using transis-
tors. Replacing resistors with transistors in integrated circuits usually results in
reduced chip area.
Series Gating
Series gating is a bipolar logic circuit technique that allows complex logic functions
to be performed with a minimum number of devices and with maximum speed.
Series gating is formed by using cascode stages.
Figure 17.15(a) shows the basic emitter-coupled pair, and Figure 17.15(b) shows
a cascode stage, also referred to as two-level series gating. Reference voltage VR1 is
approximately 0.7 V greater than reference voltage VR2. The input voltages vx and vy
must also be shifted approximately 0.7 V with respect to each other.
As an example, we use the multiemitter load circuit from Figure 17.14 as part of
a cascode conﬁguration as shown in Figure 17.16. Transistors QO1, QO2, and QO3

represent the output transistors of three ECL driver circuits. We assume a logic 1 level
of 2.5 V and a logic 0 level of 2.1 V. The 0.4 V logic swing results from incorporat-
ing a Schottky diode in each output stage.
With three input signals, there are eight possible combinations of input states.
We will only consider two combinations here:
•
A = B = C = logic 0 = 2.1 V: In this case, transistors QO1 and QO2 are off
and transistor Q1 is off. This means that current IQ ﬂows through Q2 and
Q R, and vO = logic 0 = 2.1 V.
•
A = C = 2.1 V, B = 2.5 V: Transistors QO1 and Q1 are off, QO2 is on, and
current IQ ﬂows through Q2 and QO2. Since Q1 is off, no current is available to
ﬂow through Q R, even though QO1 is off. The output is vO = logic 1 = 2.5 V.
For the output voltage vO to be a logic 1, no current must ﬂow through Q R. This
occurs when both QO1 and QO2 are on, or when a B–E junction of Q R is turned on
but no current is available through Q1 or Q2. We can show that this circuit performs
the logic of function
(A AND C) OR (B AND ¯C)
(17.8)
We are now beginning to integrate logic functions into a circuit rather than using
separate, distinct logic gates. This reduces the number of devices required, as well as
the propagation delay time.
Another example of series gating is shown in Figure 17.17. A negative supply
voltage is again used. The operation of the circuit is as follows.
•
vx = vy = logic 0 = −0.4 V: Transistors Q1, Q4, and Q7 are on, current IQ
ﬂows through Q7 and Q4, the diode turns on, and the output voltage is
−0.4 V.
•
vx = −0.4 V, vy = 0: Transistors Q1, Q4, and Q6 are on, current IQ ﬂows
through Q6 and Q1 to ground, and current IQ2 ﬂows through Q4 and the

resistor. The output voltage is vO = −RC IQ2 = −(1)(0.05) = −0.05 V.
This voltage is not sufﬁcient to turn the Schottky diode on. Although it is not
zero volts, the voltage still represents a logic 1.
•
vx = 0, vy = −0.4 V: Transistors Q2, Q3, and Q7 are on, current IQ ﬂows
through Q7 and Q3 to ground, and current IQ1 ﬂows through Q2 and the
resistor. Again, vO = −0.05 V = logic 1.
•
vx = vy = logic 1 ∼= 0 V: Transistors Q2, Q3, and Q6 are on, IQ ﬂows
through Q6, Q2, and the Schottky diode, and output voltage is vO =
−0.4 V = logic 0.
These results are summarized in Table 17.2, in which the logic levels are given.
The results show that the circuit performs the exclusive-OR logic function.
Propagation Delay Time
ECL is the fastest bipolar logic technology. Bipolar technology can produce small,
very fast transistors with cutoff frequencies in the range of 3 to 15 GHz. Logic gates
that use these transistors are so fast that interconnect line delays tend to dominate the
propagation delay times. Minimizing these interconnect delays involves minimizing
the metal lengths and using sufﬁcient current drive capability.
Speed is derived from low-signal logic swings, nonsaturating logic, and the abil-
ity to drive a load capacitance. Figure 17.18 is the emitter-follower output stage

As an example, if VS = 0.4 V and IQ = 250 μA, then for a minimum fall time
of τF = 0.8 ns, the maximum load capacitance is CL(max) = 0.625 pF. This calcu-
lation shows that the load capacitance must be minimized to realize short propaga-
tion delay times.

TRANSISTOR–TRANSISTOR LOGIC
Objective: • Analyze transistor–transistor logic circuits
The bipolar inverter is the basic circuit from which most bipolar saturated logic cir-
cuits are developed, including diode–transistor logic (DTL) and transistor–transistor
logic (TTL). However, the basic bipolar inverter suffers from loading effects.
Diode–transistor logic combines diode logic (Chapter 2) and the bipolar inverter to
minimize loading effects. Transistor–transistor logic, which evolved directly from
DTL, provides reduced propagation delay times, as we will show.
In DTL and TTL circuits, bipolar transistors are driven between cutoff and satu-
ration. Since the transistor is being used essentially as a switch, the current gain is not
as important as in ampliﬁer circuits. Typically, for transistors used in these circuits,
the current gain is assumed to be in the range of 25 to 50. These transistors need not
be fabricated to as tight a tolerance as that of high-gain ampliﬁer transistors.
Table 17.3 lists the piecewise linear parameters used in the analysis of bipolar
digital circuits, along with their typical values. Also included is the pn junction diode
turn-on voltage Vγ . Generally, the B–E voltage increases as the transistor is driven
into saturation, since the base current increases. When the transistor is biased in the
saturation region, the B–E voltage is VBE(sat), where VBE(sat) > VBE(on).
Basic Diode–Transistor Logic Gate
The basic diode–transistor logic (DTL) gate is shown in Figure 17.20. The circuit is
designed such that the output transistor operates between cutoff and saturation. This
provides the maximum output voltage swing, minimizes loading effects, and pro-
duces the maximum noise margins. When Qo is in saturation, the output voltage is
vO = VC E(sat) ∼= 0.1 V and is deﬁned as logic 0 for the DTL circuit. As we will see,
the basic DTL logic gate shown in Figure 17.20 performs the NAND logic function.
Basic DTL NAND Circuit Operation
If both input signals vX and vY are at logic 0, then the two input diodes DX and DY
are forward biased through resistor R1 and voltage source VCC. The input diodes

conduct, and voltage v1 is clamped to a value that is one diode drop above the input
voltage. If vX = vY = 0.1 V and Vγ = 0.7 V, then v1 = 0.8 V. Diodes D1 and D2
and output transistor Qo are nonconducting and are off. If D1 and D2 were conduct-
ing, then voltage vB would be −0.6 V for Vγ = 0.7 V. However, no mechanism
exists for vB to become negative and still have a forward-biased diode current. Thus,
the current in D1 and D2, the current in Qo, and the voltage vB are all zero. Since Qo
is cut off, then the output voltage is vO = VCC. This is the largest possible output
voltage and is therefore deﬁned as the logic 1 level. This same condition applies as
long as at least one input is at logic 0.
When both vX and vY are at logic 1, which is equal to VCC, both DX and DY are
cut off. Diodes D1 and D2 become forward biased, output transistor Qo is driven into
saturation, and vO = VC E(sat), which is the smallest possible output voltage and is
deﬁned as the logic 0 level.
This circuit is a two-input DTL NAND logic gate. However, the circuit is not
limited to two inputs. Additional input diodes may be included to increase the fan-in.
EXAMPLE 17.8
Objective: Determine the currents and voltages in the DTL logic circuit.
Consider the DTL circuit in Figure 17.20. Assume the transistor parameters are
as given in Table 17.3 and let β = 25.
Solution: Let vX = vY = logic 0 = 0.1 V. For this case,
v1 = vX + Vγ = 0.1 + 0.7 = 0.8 V
and
i1 = VCC −v1
R1
= 5 −0.8
4
= 1.05 mA
Since diodes D1 and D2 and output transistor Qo are nonconducting, we assume that
current i1 divides evenly between the matched diodes DX and DY . In this case, the
currents i2 = iB = iC = 0 and the output voltage is vO = 5 V = logic 1.
If vX = 0.1 V and vY = 5 V, or vX = 5 V and vY = 0.1 V, then the output tran-
sistor is still cut off and vO = 5 V = logic 1.
If vX = vY = logic 1 = 5 V, it is impossible for input diodes DX and DY to be
forward biased. In this case, diodes D1 and D2 and the output transistor are biased
on, which means that, starting at ground potential at the emitter of Qo, v1 is
v1 = VBE(sat) + 2Vγ = 0.8 + 2(0.7) = 2.2 V
Voltage v1 is clamped at this value and cannot increase. We see that DX and DY are
indeed reverse biased and turned off, as assumed.
Currents i1 and i2 are
i1 = i2 = VCC −v1
R1
= 5 −2.2
4
= 0.70 mA
and current iR is
iR = VBE(sat)
RB
= 0.8
10 = 0.08 mA
The base current into the output transistor is then
iB = i2 −iR = 0.70 −0.08 = 0.62 mA

Chapter 17 Bipolar Digital Circuits
1279
Since the circuit is to be designed such that Qo is driven into saturation, the collector
current is
iC = VCC −VC E(sat)
RC
= 5 −0.1
4
= 1.23 mA
Finally, the ratio of collector to base current is
iC
iB
= 1.23
0.62 = 1.98 < β
Comment: Since the ratio of the collector current to base current is less than β, the
output transistor is biased in the saturation region. Since the output transistor is biased
between cutoff and saturation, the maximum swing between logic 0 and logic 1 is
obtained.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.8: Consider the basic DTL circuit in Figure 17.20 with circuit and transis-
tor parameters given in Example 17.8. Assume no load is connected to the output.
Calculate the power dissipated in the circuit for (a) vX = vY = 5 V and (b) vX =
vY = 0. (Ans. (a) P = 9.625 mW, (b) P = 5.375 mW)
Minimum β
To ensure that the output transistor is in saturation, the common-emitter current gain
β must be at least as large as the ratio of collector current to base current. For exam-
ple 17.8, the minimum β, or βmin, is 1.98. If the common-emitter current gain were
less than 1.98, then Qo would not be driven into saturation, and the currents and volt-
ages in the circuit would have to be recalculated. A current gain greater than 1.98
ensures that Qo is driven into saturation for the given circuit parameters and for the
no-load condition.
Pull-Down Resistor
In the basic DTL NAND logic circuit in Figure 17.20, a resistor RB is connected
between the base of the output transistor and ground. This resistor is called a pull-
down resistor, and its purpose is to decrease the output transistor switching time as it
goes from saturation to cutoff. As previously discussed, excess minority carriers
must be removed from the base before a transistor can be switched to cutoff. This
base charge removal produces a current out of the transistor base terminal until the
transistor is turned off. Without the pull-down resistor, this reverse base current
would be limited to the reverse-bias leakage current in diodes D1 and D2, resulting
in a relatively long turn-off time. The pull-down resistor provides a path for the
reverse base current.
The base charge can be removed more rapidly if the value of RB is reduced. The
larger the reverse base current, the shorter the transistor turn-off time. However, a
trade-off must be made in choosing the value of RB. A small RB provides faster
switching, but lowers the base current to the transistor in the on state by diverting
some drive current to ground. A lower base current reduces the circuit drive capability,
or maximum fanout.

The Input Transistor of TTL
Figure 17.21(a) shows a basic DTL circuit with one input diode DX and one offset
diode D1. The structure of these back-to-back diodes is the same as an npn transistor,
as indicated in Figure 17.21(b). The base–emitter junction of Q1 corresponds to
input diode DX and the base–collector junction corresponds to offset diode D1.
17.3.2
In isoplanar integrated circuit technology, the emitter of a bipolar transistor is
fabricated in the base region. More emitters can then be added in the same base region
to form a multiemitter, multi-input device. Figure 17.22(a) shows a simpliﬁed cross
section of a three-emitter transistor, which is used as the input device in a TTL circuit.
Figure 17.22(b) shows the basic TTL circuit with the multiemitter input transistor.
This circuit performs the same NAND operation as its DTL counterpart. The
multiemitter transistor reduces the silicon area required, compared to the DTL input
diodes, and it increases the switching speed. Transistor Q1 assists in pulling output
transistor Qo out of saturation and into cutoff during a low-to-high transition of the

output voltage. Pull-down resistor RB in Figure 17.21(b) is no longer necessary, since
the excess minority carriers in the base of Qo use transistor Q1 as a path to ground.
The operation of input transistor Q1 is somewhat unconventional. In Fig-
ure 17.23(a), if either or both of the two inputs to Q1 are in a low state, the
base–emitter junction is forward biased through R1 and VCC. The base current enters
Q1, and the emitter current exits the speciﬁc emitter connected to the low input.
Transistor action forces the collector current into Q1, but the only steady-state col-
lector current in this direction is a reverse-bias saturation current out of the base of
Qo. The steady-state collector current of Q1 is usually much smaller than the base
current, implying that Q1 is biased in saturation.
If at least one input is low such that Q1 is biased in saturation, then from Fig-
ure 17.23(a), we see that the base voltage of Q1 is
vB1 = vX + VBE(sat)
(17.11)
and the base current into Q1 is
iB1 = VCC −vB1
R1
(17.12)
If the forward current gain of Q1 is βF, then Q1 will be in saturation as long as
iC1 < βFiB1.
The collector voltage of Q1 is
vC1 = vX + VC E(sat)
(17.13)
If both vX and VC E(sat) are approximately 0.1 V, then vC1 is small enough for the
output transistor to cut off and vO = VCC = logic 1.

Figure 17.23 TTL circuit (a) with at least one input low and (b) with all inputs high
If all inputs are high, vX = vY = 5 V, as shown in Figure 17.23(b), then the
base–emitter junctions of the input transistor are reverse biased. Base voltage vB1
increases, which forward-biases the B–C junction of Q1 and drives output transistor
Qo into saturation. Since the B–E junction of Q1 is reverse biased and the B–C junc-
tion is forward biased, Q1 is biased in the inverse-active mode. In this bias mode, the
roles of the emitter and collector are interchanged.

1282
Part 3
Digital Electronics
When input transistor Q1 is biased in the inverse-active mode, base voltage
vB1 is
vB1 = VBE(sat)Qo + VBC(on)Q1
(17.14)
where VBC(on) is the B–C junction turn-on voltage. We assume that the B–C junc-
tion turn-on voltage is equal to the B–E junction turn-on voltage. The terminal
current relationships for Q1 are therefore
iE X = iEY = βRiB1
(17.15)
and
iC1 = iB1 + iE X + iEY = (1 + 2βR)iB1
(17.16)
where βR is the inverse-active mode current gain of each input emitter of the input
transistor.
Since a bipolar transistor is not symmetrical, the inverse and forward current
gains are not equal. The inverse current gain is generally quite small, usually less
than one. In Figure 17.23(b), the input transistor has a fan-in of two. Transistor Q1
may be considered as two separate transistors with their bases and collectors con-
nected. For simplicity, when all inputs are high, we assume that current iE R splits
evenly between the input emitters.
The inverse-active mode current into the emitters of Q1 is not desirable, since this
is a load current that must be supplied by a driver logic circuit when its output voltage
is in its high state. Because of the transistor action, these currents tend to be larger than
the reverse saturation currents of DTL circuit input diodes. The major advantage of
TTL over DTL is faster switching of the output transistor from saturation to cutoff.
If all inputs are initially high and then at least one input switches to the logic 0
state, 0.1 V, the B–E junction of Q1 becomes forward biased and base voltage vB1
becomes approximately 0.1 + 0.7 = 0.8 V. Collector voltage vC1 is held at 0.8 V as
long as output transistor Qo remains in saturation. At this instant in time, Q1 is
biased in the forward-active mode. A large collector current into Q1 can exist, which
pulls the excess minority carrier charge out of the base of Qo. A large reverse
base current from Qo will very quickly pull the output transistor out of saturation. In
the TTL circuit, the action of the input transistor reduces the propagation delay time
compared to that of DTL logic circuits. For example, the propagation delay time is
reduced from approximately 40 ns in a DTL NAND gate to approximately 10 ns in
an equivalent TTL circuit.
Basic TTL NAND Circuit
We can improve the circuit performance of the simple TTL circuit in Figure 17.23 by
adding a second current gain stage. The resulting basic TTL NAND circuit is shown
in Figure 17.24. In this circuit, both transistors Q2 and Qo are driven into saturation
when vX = vY = logic 1. When at least one input switches from high to low, input
transistor Q1 very quickly pulls Q2 out of saturation and pull-down resistor RB
provides a path for the excess charge in Qo, which means that the output transistor
can turn off fairly quickly.
DC Current–Voltage Analysis
The analysis of the TTL circuit is very similar to that of the DTL circuit, as demon-
strated in the following example.

EXAMPLE 17.9
Objective: Calculate the currents and voltages for the basic TTL NAND circuit.
Consider the TTL circuit in Figure 17.24. Assume the piecewise linear transistor
parameters are as listed in Table 17.3. Assume the forward current gain is
βF ≡β = 25 and the inverse current gain of each input emitter is βR = 0.1.
Solution: For vX = vY = 0.1 V, Q1 is biased in saturation and
vB2 = vX + vC E(sat) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 V
which means that Q2 and Qo are both cut off. The base voltage vB1 is then
vB1 = vX + vBE(sat) = 0.1 + 0.8 = 0.9 V
and current i1 is
i1 = VCC −vB1
R1
= 5 −0.9
4
= 1.03 mA
This current ﬂows out of the input transistor emitters. Since Q2 and Qo are cut off,
all other currents are zero and the output voltage is vO = 5 V.
If vX = vY = 5 V, then the input transistor is biased in the inverse active mode.
The base voltage vB1 is
vB1 = VBE(sat)Qo + VBE(sat)Q2 + VBC(on)Q1
= 0.8 + 0.8 + 0.7 = 2.3 V
and the collector voltage vC2 is
vC2 = VBE(sat)Qo + VC E(sat)Q2 = 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9 V
The currents are

Comment: As mentioned, the analysis of the basic TTL circuit is essentially the
same as that of the DTL circuit. The magnitudes of currents and voltages in the basic
TTL circuit are also very similar to the DTL results.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.9: The parameters of the TTL NAND circuit in Figure 17.24 are:
R1 = 12 k, R2 = 4 k, RB = 2 k, and RC = 6 k. Assume βF ≡β = 25
and βR = 0.1 (for each input emitter). For a no-load condition, determine the 
base and collector currents in each transistor for: (a) vX = vY = 0.1 V and 
(b) vX = vY = 5 V. (Ans. (a) i1 = iB1 = 0.342 mA, iC1 ∼= 0, iB2 = iC2 = 0,
iBo = iCo = 0; (b) i1 = iB1 = 0.225 mA, iB2 = |iC1| = 0.27 mA, i2 = iC2 =
1.025 mA, iBo = 0.895 mA, iCo = 0.8167 mA)
TTL Output Stages and Fanout
The propagation delay time can be improved by replacing the output collector resis-
tor with a current source.
When the output changes from low to high, the load capacitance must be
charged by a current through the collector pull-up resistor. The total load capacitance
is composed of the input capacitances of the load circuits and the capacitances of
the interconnect lines. The associated RC time constant for a load capacitance
of 15 pF and a collector resistance of 4 k is 60 ns, which is large compared to the
propagation delay time of a commercial TTL circuit.
Totem-Pole Output Stage
In Figure 17.25, the combination of Q3, D1, and Qo forms an output stage called a
totem pole. Transistor Q2 forms a phase splitter, because the collector and emitter
voltages are 180 degrees out of phase. If vX = vY = logic 1, input transistor Q1 is
17.3.4

Chapter 17 Bipolar Digital Circuits
1285
biased in the inverse-active mode, and both Q2 and Qo are driven into saturation.
The voltage at the base of Q3 is
vB3 = VC2 = VBE(sat)Qo + VC E(sat)Q2
(17.17)
which is on the order of 0.9 V, and the output voltage is approximately 0.1 V. The
difference between the base voltage of Q3 and the output voltage is not sufﬁcient to
turn Q3 and D1 on. The pn junction offset voltage associated with D1 must be included
so that Q3 is cut off when the output is low. For this condition, the saturation output
transistor discharges the load capacitance and pulls the output low very quickly.
If vX = vY = logic 0, then Q2 and Qo are cut off, and the base voltage to Q3
goes high. The transistor Q3 and diode D1 turn on so that the output load capacitance
can be charged and the output goes high. Since Q3 acts like an emitter follower, the
output resistance is small so that the effective RC time constant to charge the load
capacitance is now very small.
Fanout
Logic gates are not operated in isolation, but are used to drive other similar type logic
gates to implement a complex logic function. Figure 17.26 shows the TTL NAND
gate with a totem-pole output stage connected to N identical TTL NAND gates. The
maximum fanout is deﬁned as the maximum number of similar-type logic circuits
that can be connected to the logic gate output without affecting proper circuit opera-
tion. For example, the output transistor Qo must remain in saturation when the output
goes low to its logic 0 value. For a given value of β, there is then a maximum allow-
able load current, and therefore a maximum allowable number of load circuits that
can be connected to the output. As another condition, the output transistor is usually
rated for a maximum collector current. For an output low condition, the current iLL
is the load current that Qo must sink from the load circuits.

EXAMPLE 17.10
Objective: Calculate the maximum fanout for the output low condition.
Let β = 25 for the output transistor.
Solution (Transistor QO to remain in saturation): In Example 17.9, we calculated
the base current into Qo as iBo = 2.57 mA. The output voltage is vO = 0.1 V so that

B1 = 0.1 + 0.8 = 0.9 V. Each individual load current is then

The maximum collector current in Qo is

LL1
The maximum fanout, N, is then found as
N = βiBo
i′
LL1
= (25)(2.57)
1.025
= 62.7
The number of load circuits must be an integer, so we round to the next lower integer,
or N = 62.
With 62 load circuits connected to the output, the collector current would be
iCo = Ni′
LL1 = (62)(1.025) = 63.55 mA
which is a relatively large value. In most cases, the output transistor has a maximum
rated collector current that may limit the maximum fanout.
Solution (Maximum rated output current): If the maximum rated collector current
of the output transistor is iCo(rated) = 20 mA, then the maximum fanout is deter-
mined by
iCo(rated) = Ni′
LL1
or
N = iCo(rated)
i′
LL1
=
20
1.025 = 19.5 →19
Comment: In the ﬁrst solution, the resulting fanout of 62 is not realistic since the
output transistor current is excessive. In the second solution, a maximum fanout of
19 is more realistic. However, another limitation in terms of proper circuit operation
is propagation delay time. For a large number of load circuits connected to the out-
put, the output load capacitance may be quite large which slows down the switching
speed to unacceptably large values. The maximum fanout, then, may be limited by
the propagation delay time speciﬁcation.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.10: The TTL circuit shown in Figure 17.25 is redesigned such that R1 =
12 k, R2 = 4 k, R3 = 100 , and RB = 2 k. Assume that βF ≡β = 25 and
βR = 0.1 (for each input emitter). Calculate the fanout for vX = vY = 3.6 V
under the condition that (a) the output transistor must remain in saturation and 
(b) the maximum collector current of the output transistor is limited to 12 mA.
(Ans. (a) N = 65, (b) N = 35)

Chapter 17 Bipolar Digital Circuits
1287
Again, Figure 17.26 shows the TTL circuit with N identical load circuits and the
inputs in their low state. The input transistor is biased in saturation, and both Q2 and
Qo are cut off, causing base voltage vB3 and the output voltage to go high. The input
transistors of the load circuits are biased in the inverse-active mode, and the load
currents are supplied through Q3 and D1. In this circuit, the input transistors of the
load gates are one-input NAND (inverter) gates, to illustrate the worst-case or maxi-
mum load current under the high input condition. Since the load current is supplied
through Q3, a base current into Q3 must be supplied from VCC through R2. As the
load current increases, the base current through R2 increases, which means that volt-
age vB3 decreases because of the voltage drop across R2. Assuming the B–E voltage
of Q3 and the diode voltage across D1 remain essentially constant, the output volt-
age vO decreases from its maximum value.
A reasonable fanout of 10 or 15 for the high output condition means that the load
current will be small, base current iB3 will be very small, and the voltage drop across
R2 will be negligible. The output voltage will then be approximately two diode drops
below VCC. For typical TTL circuits, the logic 1 = VO H value is on the order of
3.6 V, rather than the 5 V previously determined.
Modiﬁed Totem-Pole Output Stage
Figure 17.27 shows a modiﬁed totem-pole output stage in which transistor Q4 is used
in place of a diode. This has several advantages. First, the transistor pair Q3 and Q4
provides greater current gain, which in turn increases the fanout capability of this
circuit in its high state. Second, the output impedance in the high state is lower than
that of the single transistor, decreasing the switching time. Third, the base–emitter
junction of Q3 fulﬁlls the function of diode D1; therefore, the diode is no longer
needed to provide a voltage offset. In integrated circuits, the fabrication of transistors
is no more complex than the fabrication of diodes.
When the output is switched to its low state, resistor R4 provides a path to ground
for the minority carriers that must be pulled out of the base of Q3 to turn the transistor

off. Note that when the output is low, with Q2 and Qo in saturation, the voltage at the
base of Q4 is approximately 0.9 V, which is sufﬁcient to bias Q4 in its active region.
However, the voltage at the emitter of Q4 is only approximately 0.2 V, which means that
the current in Q4 is very small and does not add signiﬁcantly to the power dissipation.
Tristate Output
The output impedances of the totem-pole output TTL logic circuits considered thus far
are extremely low when the output voltage is in either the high or low state. In memory
circuit applications, situations arise in which the outputs of many TTL circuits must be
connected together to form a single output. This creates a serious loading situation,
demanding that all other TTL outputs be disabled or put into a high impedance state, as
shown symbolically in Figure 17.28. Here, G1 and G3 are disconnected from the out-
put; the output voltage vO then measures only the output of logic gate G2.

Figure 17.29 TTL circuit with tristate output stage
The TTL circuit in Figure 17.29 may be used to put the logic output into a high
impedance state. When ¯D = 5 V, the state of input transistor Q1 is controlled by
inputs vX and vY . Under these circumstances, diode D2 is always reverse biased and
the circuit function is the NAND function already considered.
When ¯D is driven to a logic 0 state of 0.1 V, the low voltage at the emitter of Q1
ensures that both Q2 and Qo are cut off, and the low voltage applied to D2 means that
D2 is forward biased. The voltage at the base of Q4 is approximately 0.8 V, which
means that Q3 is also cut off. In this condition, then, both output transistors Q3 and
Qo are cut off. The impedance looking back into transistors that are cut off is
normally in the megohm range. Therefore, when TTL circuits are paralleled to
increase the capability of a digital system, the tristate output stage is either enabled
or disabled via the ¯D select line. The output stage on only one TTL circuit may be
enabled at any one time.

SCHOTTKY TRANSISTOR–TRANSISTOR LOGIC
Objective: • Analyze and design Schottky and low-power Schottky
transistor–transistor logic circuits
The TTL circuits considered thus far drive the output and phase-splitter transistors
between cutoff in the high output state and saturation in the low output state. The
input transistor is driven between saturation and the inverse-active mode. Since the
propagation delay time of a TTL gate is a strong function of the storage time of
the saturation transistors, a nonsaturation logic circuit would be an advantage. In the
Schottky clamped transistor, the transistor is prevented from being driven into deep
saturation and has a storage time of only approximately 50 ps.
Schottky Clamped Transistor
The symbol for the Schottky clamped transistor, or simply the Schottky transistor, is
shown in Figure 17.30(a); its equivalent conﬁguration is given in Figure 17.30(b).
In this transistor, a Schottky diode is connected between the base and collector of an
npn bipolar transistor. Two characteristics of the Schottky diode are: a low turn-on
voltage and a fast-switching time. When the transistor is in its active region, the base–
collector junction is reverse biased, which means that the Schottky diode is reverse
biased and effectively out of the circuit. The Schottky transistor then behaves like a
normal npn bipolar transistor. As the Schottky transistor goes into saturation, the

base–collector junction becomes forward biased, and the base–collector voltage is
effectively clamped at the Schottky diode turn-on voltage, which is normally between
0.3 and 0.4 V. The excess base current is shunted through the diode, and the basic npn
transistor is prevented from going deeply into saturation.
Figure 17.31 shows the equivalent circuit of the Schottky transistor with desig-
nated currents and voltages. Currents iC and iB are the collector and base currents,
respectively, of the Schottky transistor, while i′
C and i′
B are the collector and base
currents, respectively, of the internal npn transistor.
The three deﬁning equations for the Schottky transistor are

C = iD + iC

iB = i′

(17.19)
and
i′
C = βi′

(17.20)
Equation (17.20) is appropriate since the internal transistor is clamped at the
edge of saturation. If iC < βiB, then the Schottky diode is forward biased, iD > 0,
and the Schottky transistor is said to be in saturation. However, the internal transis-
tor is only driven to the edge of saturation in this case.
Combining Equations (17.19) and (17.20), we ﬁnd that
iD = iB −i′

Solution: For iC = 2 mA, the internal collector current is, from Equation (17.22(b)),

and the internal base current is

Repeating the calculations for iC = 20 mA, we obtain
i′
C = 20.2 mA
i′
B = 0.808 mA
iD = 0.192 mA
Comment: For a relatively small collector current into the Schottky transistor, the
majority of the input base current is shunted through the Schottky diode. As the
collector current into the Schottky transistor increases, less current is shunted through
the Schottky diode and more current ﬂows into the base of the npn transistor.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.11: Consider the Schottky clamped transistor in Figure 17.32. Assume
β = 15, VBE(on) = 0.7 V and Vγ (SD) = 0.3 V. (a) For no load, iL = 0, ﬁnd the
currents iD, i′
B, and i′

(b) i′
C = 13.166 mA, i′
B = 0.878 mA, iD = 1.122 mA; (c) iL ∼= 28 mA)
Since the internal npn bipolar transistor is not driven deeply into saturation, we
assume that the B–E junction voltage remains equal to the turn-on voltage, or vBE =
VBE(on). If the Schottky transistor is biased in saturation, then the C–E voltage is
vC E = VC E(sat) = VBE(on) −Vγ (SD)
(17.23)
where Vγ (SD) is the turn-on voltage of the Schottky diode. Assuming parameter
values of VBE(on) = 0.7 V and Vγ (SD) = 0.3 V, the collector–emitter saturation
voltage of a Schottky transistor is VC E(sat) = 0.4 V. When the Schottky transistor is
at the edge of saturation, then iD = 0, iC = βiB, and vC E = VC E(sat).
Schottky TTL NAND Circuit
Figure 17.33 shows a Schottky TTL NAND circuit in which all of the transistors
except Q3 are Schottky clamped transistors. The connection of Q4 across the
base–collector of Q3 prevents this junction from becoming forward biased, ensuring
that Q3 never goes into saturation. Another difference between this circuit and the
standard TTL circuit is that the pull-down resistor at the base of output transistor Qo
has been replaced by transistor Q5 and two resistors. This arrangement is called a

squaring network, since it squares, or sharpens, the voltage transfer characteristics
of the circuit.
Device Q2 is prevented from conducting until the input voltage is large enough
to turn on both Q2 and Qo simultaneously. Recall that the passive pull-down resistor
on the TTL circuit provided a pathway for removing stored charge in the base of the
output transistor, when the output transistor was turned off from the saturated state.
Transistor Q5 now provides an active pull-down network that pulls Qo out of satura-
tion more quickly.
This is one example of a circuit in which the piecewise linear model of a tran-
sistor fails to provide an adequate solution for the circuit analysis. With the piecewise
linear model, Q5 would apparently never turn on. However, because of the exponen-
tial relationship between collector current and base-emitter voltage, transistor Q5
does turn on and does help pull Qo out of saturation during switching.
The two Schottky diodes between the input terminals and ground act as clamps
to suppress any ringing that might occur from voltage transitions. The input diodes
clamp any negative undershoots at approximately −0.3 V.
The dc current–voltage analysis of the Schottky TTL circuit in Figure 17.33 is
similar to that for the standard TTL circuit. One minor difference is that when the
inputs are high and the input transistor is in the inverse-active mode, the B–C
forward bias voltage is 0.3 V, because of the Schottky diode connected between the
base and collector junctions.
The major difference between the Schottky circuit and standard TTL circuits is
the quantity of excess minority carrier storage in the transistors when they are driven
into or near saturation. The internal npn transistor of the Schottky clamped transistor
is held at the edge of saturation, and the resulting propagation delay time is on the
order of 2 to 5 ns, compared to a nominal 10 to 15 ns for standard TTL circuits.
A slight difference between the Schottky and standard TTL circuits is the value
of the output voltage in the logic 0 state. The low output voltage of a standard TTL
circuit is in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 V, while the Schottky transistor low output

saturation voltage, VOL, is approximately 0.4 V. The output voltage in the logic 1
state is essentially the same for both types of logic circuits.
Low-Power Schottky TTL Circuits
The Schottky TTL circuit in Figure 17.33 and the standard TTL circuit dissipate
approximately the same power, since voltage and resistance values in the two circuits
are similar. The advantage of the Schottky TTL circuit is the reduction in propagation
delay time by a factor of 3 to 10.
Propagation delay times depend on the type of transistors (Schottky clamped or
regular) used in the circuit, and on the current levels in the circuit. The storage time
of a regular transistor is a function of the reverse base current that pulls the transistor
out of saturation. Also, the transistor turn-on time depends on the current level charg-
ing the base–emitter junction capacitance. A desirable trade-off can therefore be made
between current levels (power dissipation) and propagation delay times. Smaller
current levels lead to lower power dissipation, but at the expense of increased prop-
agation delay times. This trade-off has been successful in commercial applications,
where very short propagation delay times are not always necessary, but reduced
power requirements are always an advantage.
A low-power Schottky TTL NAND circuit is shown in Figure 17.34. With few
exceptions, these circuits do not use the multiemitter input transistor of standard TTL
circuits. Most low-power Schottky circuits use a DTL type of input circuit, with
Schottky diodes performing the AND function. This circuit is faster than the classic
multiemitter input transistor circuit, and the input breakdown voltage is also higher.
The dc analysis of the low-power Schottky circuit is identical to that of DTL
circuits.

EXAMPLE 17.12
Objective: Calculate the power dissipation in a low-power Schottky TTL circuit.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 17.34. Assume the Schottky diode turn-on
voltage is Vγ (SD) = 0.3 V and the transistor parameters are: VBE(on) = 0.7 V,
VC E(sat) = 0.4 V, and β = 25.
Solution: For the low input condition, vX = vY = 0.4 V and v1 = 0.4 + 0.3 =
0.7 V. Current i1 is
i1 = VCC −v1
R1
= 5 −0.7
20
= 0.215 mA
Since Q2 and Qo are cut off with a no-load condition, all other currents in the circuit
are zero. The power dissipation for the low input condition is therefore
PL = i1(VCC −vX) = (0.215) · (5 −0.4) = 0.989 mW
For the high input condition, vX = vY = 3.6 V, voltage v1 is
v1 = VBE(on)Qo + VBE(on)Q2 = 0.7 + 0.7 = 1.4 V
and voltage vC2 is
vC2 = VBE(on)Qo + VC E(sat)Q2 = 0.7 + 0.4 = 1.1 V
The currents are then
i1 = VCC −v1
R1
= 5 −1.4
20
= 0.18 mA
and
i2 = VCC −vC2
R2
= 5 −1.1
8
= 0.488 mA
When vC2 = 1.1 V and vO = 0.4 V, transistor Q4 is at the edge of turn-on, how-
ever, since there is no voltage drop across R4, Q4 has negligible emitter current. For
a no-load condition, all other currents are zero. Therefore, the power dissipation for
the high input condition is
PH = (i1 + i2)VCC = (0.18 + 0.488) · 5 = 3.34 mW
Comment: The power dissipation in this low-power Schottky TTL circuit is approxi-
mately a factor of ﬁve smaller than in the Schottky or standard TTL logic gates. The
propagation delay time in the low-power Schottky circuit is approximately 10 ns,
which compares closely with the propagation delay time for a standard TTL circuit.
EXERCISE PROBLEM
Ex 17.12: Assume the low-power Schottky TTL circuit in Figure 17.34 is
redesigned such that R1 = 40 k and R2 = 12 k, and all other circuit parame-
ters remain the same. The transistor and diode parameters are: VBE(on) = 0.7 V,
VC E(sat) = 0.4 V, β = 25, and Vγ (SD) = 0.3 V. Assuming no load, determine
the base and collector currents in each transistor, and the power dissipation in the
gate, for: (a) vX = vY = 0.4 V, and (b) vX = vY = 3.6 V. (Ans. (a) iB2 =
iC2 = iBo = iCo = iB5 = iC5 = 0, 
iB3 = iC3 = iB4 = iC4 = 0, 
P = 495 μW
(b) iB2 = 90 μA, iC2 = 325 μA, iB4 = iC4 = iB3 = iC3 = 0, iB5 ∼= iC5 ∼= 0,
iBo = 415 μA, iCo = 0, P = 2.08 mW)

Diodes D5 and D6 are called speedup diodes. As we showed in the dc analysis,
these diodes are reverse biased when the inputs are in either a static logic 0 or a logic 1
mode. When at least one input is in a logic 0 state, the output is high, and Q3 and Q4
tend to turn on, supplying any necessary load current. When both inputs are switched
to their logic 1 state, Q2 turns on and vC2 decreases, forward biasing D5 and D6.
Diode D5 helps to pull charge out of the base of Q3, turning this transistor off more
rapidly. Diode D6 helps discharge the load capacitance, which means that output
voltage vO switches low more rapidly.
Advanced Schottky TTL Circuits
The advanced low-power Schottky circuit possesses the lowest speed–power product
with a propagation delay time short enough to accommodate a large number of digital
applications, while still maintaining the low power dissipation of the low-power
Schottky family of logic circuits. The major modiﬁcation lies in the design of the input
circuitry. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 17.35. The input circuit contains a pnp
transistor Q1, a current ampliﬁcation transistor Q2, and a Schottky diode D2 from the
base of Q3 to the input. Diode D2 provides a low-impedance path to ground when the
input makes a high-to-low transition. This enhances the inverter switching time. The
current driver transistor Q1 provides a faster transition when the input goes from low
to high than if a Schottky diode input stage were used. Transistor Q1 provides the
switch element that steers current from R1 either to Q2 or the input source.
When vX = 0.4 V, the E–B junction of Q1 is forward biased, and Q1 is biased in
its active region. The base voltage of Q2 is approximately 1.1 V; Q2, Q3, and Q5 are cut
off; and the output voltage goes high. Most of the current through R1 goes to ground
through Q1, so very little current sinking is required of the driver output transistor. When

BiCMOS DIGITAL CIRCUITS
Objective: • Analyze BiCMOS digital logic circuits
As we have discussed previously, BiCMOS technology combines bipolar and CMOS
circuits on one IC chip. This technology combines the high-input-impedance, low-
power characteristics of CMOS with the high-current drive characteristics of bipolar
circuits. If the CMOS circuit has to drive a few other similar CMOS logic circuits,
the current drive capability is not a problem. However, if a circuit has to drive a
relatively large capacitive load, bipolar circuits are preferable because of the rela-
tively large transconductance of BJTs.
We consider a BiCMOS inverter circuit and then a simple example of a BiCMOS
digital circuit. This section is intended only to introduce this technology.
BiCMOS Inverter
Several BiCMOS inverter conﬁgurations have been proposed. In each case, npn
bipolar transistors are used as output devices and are driven by a quasi-CMOS
inverter conﬁguration. The simplest BiCMOS inverter is shown in Figure 17.36(a).
The output stage of the npn transistors is similar to the totem-pole output stage of the
TTL circuits that were considered in Section 17.3.
When the input voltage vI of the BiCMOS inverter in Figure 17.36(a) is low,
the transistors MN and Q2 are cut off. The transistor MP is turned on and provides
base current to Q1 so that Q1 turns on and supplies current to the load capacitance.
The load capacitance charges and the output voltage goes high. As the output voltage
goes high, the output current will normally become very small, so that MP is driven
17.5.1

into its nonsaturation region and the drain-to-source voltage will become essentially
zero. The transistor Q1 will essentially cut off and the output voltage will charge to
a maximum value of approximately vO(max) = VDD −VBE(on).
When the input voltage vI goes high, MP turns off, eliminating any bias current
to Q1, so Q1 is also off. The two transistors MN and Q2 turn on and provide a
discharge path for the load capacitance so the output voltage goes low. In steady
state, the load current will normally be very small, so MN will be biased in the
nonsaturation region. The drain-to-source voltage will become essentially zero. The
transistor Q2 will be essentially off and the output voltage will discharge to a mini-
mum value of approximately vO(min) ∼= VBE(on).
One serious disadvantage of the inverter in Figure 17.36(a) is that there is no
path through which base charge from the npn transistors can be removed when they
are turning off. Thus, the turn-off time of the two npn transistors can be relatively
long. A solution to this problem is to include pull-down resistors, as shown in the cir-
cuit in Figure 17.36(b). Now, when the npn transistors are being turned off, the stored
base charge can be removed to ground through R1 or R2. An added advantage of this
circuit is, that when vI goes high and the output goes low, the very small output cur-
rent through MN and R2 means the output voltage is pulled to ground potential. Also,
as vI goes low and the output goes high, the very small load current means that the
output is pulled up to essentially VDD through the resistor R1. We may note that the
two npn output transistors are never on at the same time.
Other circuit designs incorporate other transistors that aid in turning transistors
off and increasing switching speed. However, these two examples have demonstrated
the basic principle used in BiCMOS inverter circuit designs.
BiCMOS Logic Circuit
In BiCMOS logic circuits, the logic function is implemented by the CMOS portion of
the circuit and the bipolar transistors again act as a buffered output stage providing the

necessary current drive. One example of a BiCMOS logic circuit is shown in Figure
17.37. This is a two-input NOR gate. As seen in the ﬁgure, the CMOS conﬁguration
is the same as the basic CMOS NOR logic gate considered previously. The two npn
output transistors and the R1 and R2 resistors have the same conﬁguration and pur-
pose as was seen in the BiCMOS inverter.
Other BiCMOS logic circuits are designed in a manner similar to that shown for
the BiCMOS NOR gate.

DESIGN APPLICATION: A STATIC ECL GATE
Objective: • Design a static ECL gate to implement a speciﬁc logic

Y = (A + B)(C + D). The circuit is to be designed using constant current sources
and the total power dissipation is to be no more than approximately 1 mw.
Design Approach: A modiﬁed static ECL gate with a Schottky diode similar to the
circuit conﬁguration in Figure 17.10 is to be designed.

Solution (DC Circuit Design): There are four basic currents in the circuit. Assum-
ing that each bias current IQ is equal to the reference current IREF, then from the total
power dissipation, we ﬁnd
PT = 1 = IT VCC = 4IQ(1.7)

When either of the reference transistors Q R1 or Q R2 is turned on, we would like the
currents in R2 and D1 to be equal. Assuming the Schottky diode turn-on voltage to
be Vγ = 0.4 V, we then ﬁnd
R2 =

logic 1 output voltages). The resistance R3 is then found from

Comment: The entire circuit will be fabricated as an integrated circuit, so standard-
valued resistors are not required in the design.
Solution (Basic Conﬁguration): The circuit in Figure 17.10 performs the OR logic
function. To implement the AND logic function, we can effectively tie the outputs of
two OR logic gates together. Figure 17.38 shows the logic gate conﬁguration. We can
show that the output Y is indeed the logic function desired.

SUMMARY
•
This chapter presented the analysis and design of bipolar digital logic circuits,
which were historically the ﬁrst logic circuit technology used in digital systems.
•
Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) is used in specialized high-speed applications. The
basic ECL gate has the same conﬁguration as the differential ampliﬁer, but tran-
sistors are switched between cutoff and the active region. Avoiding driving tran-
sistors into saturation keeps the propagation delay time to a minimum.
•
The classical ECL gate uses the diff-amp conﬁguration in conjunction with
emitter-follower output stages and a reference voltage circuit. Both NOR and
OR outputs are available.
•
Modiﬁed ECL logic gates can be designed with reduced power dissipation.
•
The analysis of diode-transistor logic (DTL) circuits introduced saturating bipo-
lar logic circuits and their characteristics.
•
The input transistor of the transistor–transistor logic (TTL) circuit is driven
between saturation and the inverse active mode. This transistor reduces the
switching time by quickly pulling charge out of the base of a saturated transis-
tor. The totem-pole output stage was introduced in order to increase the
switching speed of the output stage.
•
The Schottky clamped transistor has a Schottky diode between the base and col-
lector of an npn transistor, thus preventing the transistor from being driven deep
into saturation. The propagation delay time of Schottky TTL, then, is shorter
than that of regular TTL.
•
Low-power Schottky TTL has the same basic conﬁguration as the DTL circuit.
Resistor values are increased so as to reduce the currents, which in turn reduce
the power dissipated per circuit.
•
BiCMOS circuits incorporate the best characteristics of both the CMOS and
bipolar technologies. One example is a basic CMOS inverter that drives a bipo-
lar output stage. The high input impedance and low power dissipation of the
CMOS design is coupled with the high current drive capability of a bipolar out-
put stage. An example of a BiCMOS NOR logic circuit was considered.
•
As an application, a static ECL logic gate to implement a speciﬁc logic function
was designed.

Single N-Channel Enhancement Mode Field Effect Transistor
General Description
Features
These  N-channel  enhancement  mode  power  field
effect  transistors  are  produced  using  National’s
proprietary, high cell density, DMOS technology. 
This very high density process has been especially 
tailored to minimize on-state resistance, provide 
superior switching performance, and withstand high 
energy pulses in the avalanche and commutation 
modes. These devices are particularly suited to  low 
voltage applications such as laptop computer power 
management and other battery powered circuits 
where fast switching, low in-line power loss, and 
resistance to transients are needed.
• 7.0 A, 30 V. RDS(ON) = 0.03 Ω
• Rugged internal source-drain diode can eliminate
   the need for an external Zener diode transient
   suppressor
• High density cell design (3.8 million/in2) for
   extremely low RDS(ON)
• High power and current handling capability in a
   widely used surface mount package
• Critical DC electrical parameters specified at
   elevated temperature

LM741 Operation Amplifier
General Description
The LM741 series are general purpose operational amplifiers
which feature improved performance over industry standards
like the LM709. They are direct, plug-in replacements for the
709C, LM201, MC1439 and 748 in most applications. The
amplifiers offer many features which make their application
nearly foolproof: overload protection on the input and output,
no latch-up when the common mode range is exceeded as well
as freedom from oscillations.
The LM741C/LM741E are identical to the LM741/LM741A
except that the LM741C/LM741E have their performance
guaranteed over a 0 °C to +70 °C temperature range, instead
of –55 °C to +125 °C.

Standard Resistor 
and Capacitor Values
In this appendix, we list standard component values, which are used for selecting
resistor and capacitor values in designing discrete electronic circuits and systems. Low-
power carbon and ﬁlm resistors with 2 percent to 20 percent tolerances have a standard
set of values and a standard color-band marking scheme. These tabulated values may
vary from one manufacturer to another, so the tables should be considered as typical.
C.1
CARBON RESISTORS
Standard resistor values are listed in Table C.1. The lightface type indicates 2 percent and
5 percent tolerance values; the boldface type indicates 10% tolerance resistor values.

Discrete carbon resistors have a standard color-band marking scheme, which
makes it easy to recognize resistor values in a circuit or a parts bin, without having to
search for a printed legend. The color bands start at one end of the resistor, as shown
in Figure C.1. Two digits and a multiplier digit determine the resistor value. The ad-
ditional color bands indicate the tolerance and reliability. The digit and multiplier
color-code is given in Table C.2.
For example, the ﬁrst three color bands of a 4.7 k resistor are yellow, violet,
and red. The ﬁrst two digits are 47 and the multiplier is 100. The ﬁrst three color
bands on a 150 k resistor are brown, green, and yellow.

Ten percent tolerance carbon resistors are available in the following power
ratings: 1
4, 1
2, 1, and 2 W.
C.2
PRECISION RESISTORS (ONE PERCENT
TOLERANCE)
Metal-ﬁlm precision resistors can have tolerance levels in the 1
2 percent to 1 percent
range. These resistors use a four-digit code printed on the resistor body, rather than
the color-band scheme. The ﬁrst three digits denote a value, and the last digit is the
multiplier for the number of zeros. For example, 2503 denotes a 250 k resistor, and
2000 denotes a 200  resistor. If the resistor’s value is too small to be described in
this way, an R is used to indicate the decimal point; for example, 37R5 is a 37.5 
resistor, and 10R0 is a 10.0  resistor.
The standard values typically range from 10  to 301 k. Standard values in
each decade are given in Table C.3.

One percent resistors are often used in applications that require excellent stabil-
ity and accuracy; a small adjustable trimmer resistor may be connected in series to
the 1 percent resistor to set a precise resistance value. It is important to realize that
1 percent resistors are only guaranteed to be within 1 percent of their rated value
under a speciﬁed set of conditions. Resistance variations due to temperature or hu-
midity changes, and operation at full rated power can exceed the 1 percent tolerance.
C.3
CAPACITORS
Typical capacitor values for 10 percent tolerance capacitors from one manufacturer
are listed in Table C.4. The range of capacitance values for the ceramic-disk capaci-
tor is approximately 10 pF to 1 μF.

An accessible approach to learning through clear writing and practical pedagogy has become 
the hallmark of Microelectronics: Circuit Analysis and Design by Donald Neamen. Now in 
its fourth edition, the text builds upon its strong pedagogy and tools for student assessment 
with key updates as well as revisions that allow for ﬂ exible coverage of op-amps. 
Key Features of the Fourth Edition 
Flexible Presentation of Key Topics
Revisions have given the text a level of ﬂ exibility such that ideal op-amps (Chapter 9) can be 
presented as the ﬁ rst topic in electronics; either MOS or Bipolar transistors can be studied as the 
ﬁ rst transistor type; and digital electronics can be covered before analog electronics. This ﬂ exibility 
allows instructors to present topics in whatever order makes the most sense for their students.
New Problems and Text Updates
The fourth edition features a substantial number of new problems. This includes: over 45 percent 
new exercise and Test Your Understanding problems; over 45 percent new end-of-chapter problems; 
and over 70 percent new open-ended design problems and computer simulation problems. In addition, 
coverage of circuit voltage levels and device parameters was updated to more closely match real 
world electronics.
Goal-Oriented Pedagogy
A Preview section introduces each chapter and correlates with learning objectives that head each 
section. Worked examples reinforce the theoretical concepts being developed; all examples are 
followed by exercises to immediately test learning. Test Your Understanding problems are integrated 
at the end of each section to provide additional practice. Problem solving techniques guide students 
through analyzing and solving a problem. 
Focus on Design in the Real World
Students are taught good design by incorporating design exercises that help students get a feel for 
how the design process works in the real world. Each chapter includes a Design Application that 
leads students through the design and development of an electronic thermometer. The various 
characteristics and properties of circuits are explained as the student moves through the analysis. 
Design Pointers appear in examples and throughout the text to help students with tricky design 
issues, and Design Problems are featured in most problem sets.
Computer Tools
Because computer analysis and computer-aided design are signiﬁ cant factors in professional 
electronic design, the text contains a large number of new computer simulation problems. 
These appear both throughout the chapter and at the end of each chapter.
Learning and Teaching Technologies
The website for Microeletronics features tools for students and teachers. Professors can beneﬁ t 
from McGraw-Hill’s COSMOS electronic solutions manual. COSMOS enables instructors to generate 
a limitless supply of problem material for assignment, as well as transfer and integrate their own 
problems into the software. In addition, the website boasts PowerPoint slides, an image library, 
the complete Instructor’s Solution Manual (password protected), data sheets, laboratory manual, 
and links to other important websites. You can ﬁ nd the site at www.mhhe.com/neamen
