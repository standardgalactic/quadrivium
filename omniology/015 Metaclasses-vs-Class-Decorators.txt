Pros and Cons
Class Decorator
Metaclass
easier to understand
harder to understand
can stack decorators
can only specify a single metaclass
subclasses do not "inherit" decorator
subclasses "inherit" parent metaclass
can decorate classes in an 
inheritance chain with different 
decorators
only a single custom metaclass (or 
subclasses thereof, using multiple 
inheritance) can be in play in an 
inheritance chain
