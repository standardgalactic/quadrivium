Making  
the cover
Editor Nick‚Äôs original brief ‚Äì ‚Äòone of those secret 
agent-style encoded messages‚Äô ‚Äì was wonderfully 
evocative and seemed simple enough in principle, 
but in practice, this proved one of our most 
difficult cover treatments to execute.
Maintaining the clarity of the exposed cover 
lines in the body of the text (printed on the thick, 
Pantone red insert card) was an editorial challenge 
in itself, but nudging and tweaking that copy to 
accommodate our Ô¨Çuted foil headline resulted 
in¬†several rounds of reÔ¨Ånements.
Equally, creating the die cut to punch out the 
cover lines should have been simple enough, but 
as with any additional manufacturing process, 
the need for absolute accuracy ‚Äì 5mm error either 
way would make the cover lines illegible ‚Äì led to 
palpable levels of anxiety in the art department.  
Left and below: Areas to be 
die cut needed to be simple 
and subtle enough not to 
threaten the structural 
integrity of the cover; so we 
slightly rounded the corners 
of each lozenge to reduce 
the chance of torn edges.

MARK WYNNE 
Nick and Mark worked so closely on this 
cover, they brought to (Mark‚Äôs) mind the epic 
Spice Girls smash, Two Become One (which 
Mark has only just discovered is about sex). 
Below: While this schematic 
shows two separate layers, 
the two different foils are 
actually laid on one plate 
‚Äì the Ô¨Çuted effect on the 
headline (right) is achieved 
by embossing once the foil 
plate has been printed.

KEEP IN TOUCH WITH‚Ä¶
Quit your job. It‚Äôs a pretty empowering statement: if 
you‚Äôre not creatively rewarded, feel like you can‚Äôt reach 
your full potential, or are generally under-appreciated, 
don‚Äôt just sit there and take it: make 2018 the year to 
make your dreams a reality.
When we put a tweet out asking for stories of people 
who had done just that, the response was overwhelming. 
We explore the topic in detail this month, part of an issue 
dedicated to making those new year‚Äôs resolutions count for 
something. Whether it‚Äôs Ô¨Ånally launching that side project 
that‚Äôs been on the back-burner, tackling your stress levels to 
Ô¨Ånd a better work-life balance, or landing a massive client 
as a portfolio centrepiece ‚Äì it‚Äôs up to you to make it happen.
Our rather special collectable cover is all about making 
a promise to yourself: a pledge to make 2018 your best year 
ever. The speciÔ¨Åcs, of course, are up to you ‚Äì we‚Äôve provided 
some suggestions, and some advice to get you started ‚Äì but 
only you know what your list of goals looks like.
As our video proÔ¨Åle demonstrates, sometimes there‚Äôs no 
substitute for unswerving passion and hard graft: the co-
founders of Bristol-based studio Fiasco threw themselves 
into business seven years ago with no prior experience 
whatsoever, and ended up with a BAFTA and a D&AD 
Pencil within their Ô¨Årst few years of business.
It may not work out all the time, but you can learn from 
that too. In a one-oÔ¨Ä special feature, we‚Äôve replaced our 
regular behind-the-scenes project diaries at the back of the 
mag with private diaries instead, in which Marian Bantjes 
and Michael Johnson share creative concepts for clients 
that never made it oÔ¨Ä the drawing board, but are still 
inspiring pieces of work in their own right.
Next month, we bring you our hotlist of illustrators to 
watch this year ‚Äì an invaluable reference guide for your 
next¬†big commission or collaboration. See you then!

BRAIN POWER
Mental health considerations are increasingly 
moving¬†focus away from body performance, 
and¬†towards the brain-body connection instead
TRENDS
N
euroscientist Dr Tara Swart, founder of The Unlimited 
Mind,¬†teaches techniques to achieve mental reliance and 
peak brain performance. She focuses on Ô¨Åve fundamentals 
of¬†neuroscience: rest, which examines the sleep best for your 
brain;¬†fuel, looking at foods that are brain boosting; hydrate, which 
ensures¬†enough water is consumed to allow proper neuron function; 
oxygenate, which encompasses the types of exercise that boost 
brains for successful ageing; and simplify, which takes in mindfulness 
in the form of meditation, yoga, mindful eating and mindful walking.
Brain-optimising products, services and experiences are coming 
to the fore in the form of nootropic consumables, tech add-ons and 
tailored exercise regimes. Brands are working with neuroscientists to 
infuse their products with brain-optimising features. Using technology, 
and natural and synthetic chemicals, innovative designers are creating 
products and services that enable us to program efficiency and 
optimisation into our cognitive activities.
Dr Swart has recently been offering an overnight experience called 
the Brain Power Package. It includes a menu of nutrient-rich meals, 
mindfulness sessions, heated marble Ô¨Çoors claimed to help neutralise 
the effects of electromagnetic interference on the brain-body system, 
blackout blinds to aid sleep, treatment sessions, a series of talks on topics 
from the science of the brain to politics, sleep pods for power napping, 
and a Brain Lab where guests can learn to develop mental resilience. 
Created by food technologist Angus Brown, and developed in 
collaboration with neuroscientist Dr Andrew Scholey, Arepa is a 
juice-based drink containing L-theanine, as well as other supposedly 
mind-enhancing ingredients, such as pine extract. The fruit of four years‚Äô 
development at New Zealand's The FoodBowl food innovation centre, 
the apple and blackcurrant Ô¨Çavoured drink is said to stimulate alpha 
brain waves, claimed to boost creativity and reduce depression.
Developed in collaboration with neuroscientists, Brain.FM is an 
artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence music composer that delivers tailored musical 
treatments claimed to affect cognitive activity. The musical vibrations 
promote one of Ô¨Åve cognitive states: focus, relax, meditation, nap and 
sleep, and are said to complement the brain's natural frequencies.
HeadStrong is a new Equinox group Ô¨Åtness class that combines brain 
and body training to push physical and mental boundaries in a four-part 
‚Äòactive regeneration‚Äô workout. Described as the intersection between 
high intensity and mindful movement, the 60-minute class has four 
key¬†sections, each with a customised soundscape. 
California-based start-up HVMN believes humans can be quantiÔ¨Åed, 
optimised and upgraded. It designs and develops products that enhance 
key biometrics relating to our cognitive, physical and metabolic output. 
Its Nootrobox comprises four products ‚Äì¬†Rise, Kado-3, Sprint and Yawn 
‚Äì¬†that focus on key aspects of brain health and performance with the 
aim of providing a sophisticated way to nourish our sophisticated brains.

A
iming to combine bright 
clean walls with lots 
of¬†colour and texture, 
Robin Eisenberg created her LA 
home studio in her two-bedroom 
apartment in early 2017. It‚Äôs the 
Ô¨Årst time the artist and illustrator 
has had her own studio space, 
and¬†she absolutely loves it. 
‚ÄúI genuinely get to so excited 
about working every day,‚Äù she 
says.¬†‚ÄúI love being in spaces that 
feel¬†vibrant and lived in, but also 
calming and organised. Being at 
my¬†desk makes me feel like my 
brain is¬†happy and focused.‚Äù
That focus can also have its 
downsides, however, as Eisenberg 
admits she is sometimes ‚Äúnot as 
present‚Äù as she‚Äôd like to be in other 
parts of her life. A collection of 
objects given to her by her parents 
and husband remind her of ‚Äúlife 
outside of art‚Äù (1). ‚ÄúThe geode Lady 
Cave is by Chaparral Studio and 
I¬†am so in love with it,‚Äù she says. 
A sample of pins (2) she‚Äôs 
collected over the past couple 
of¬†years also keeps her inspired. 
‚ÄúWhen I Ô¨Årst moved back to LA 
in¬†2015 after being away for a few 
years, I¬†discovered the pin-making 
world and was inspired to start 
making my own pins and selling 
them. Starting a shop and meeting 
other pin makers was so exciting, 
and it really changed a lot of things 
for me as an artist,‚Äù she says.
One wall of Eisenberg‚Äôs studio 
is¬†adorned with her own art (3). 
‚ÄúI¬†like having my work up behind 
me, it kind of makes me feel like 
my¬†drawings have my back while 
I‚Äôm working on new stuff,‚Äù she grins.
She also enjoys having her 
books and piano (4) close by. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm 
ever having a moment of frustration 
with a project, I‚Äôll take a break and 
play the piano, and I always feel 
calmer afterwards,‚Äù she says.¬†
Eisenberg‚Äôs coloured pencils (5) 
were a gift from one of her closest 
friends, and although the leopard 
is¬†actually a case, she doesn‚Äôt keep 
anything in it. ‚ÄúI just like having a 
leopard on my desk,‚Äù she shrugs. 
VIBRANT YET CALMING

AMERICAN DREAM
Josh Peter, who is heading up O Street‚Äôs new Denver division, 
reveals¬†why the Scottish studio has decided to cross the pond
NEW VENTURES
uring a trip to the US supported 
by Scottish Development 
International, O Street found that 
Denver, Colardo was a booming place for 
new businesses, start-ups and tech. The 
team liked it so much they decided to set 
up a studio there. We asked Josh Peter how 
this new venture will work in practice‚Ä¶
Why were you drawn to Denver?
Denver has a vibrant arts culture, a great 
climate and is one of the craft beer capitals 
in the world, making it an amazing Ô¨Åt for 
our expertise. With the population rapidly 
growing, the culture out here is fresh. It 
feels¬†like it‚Äôs just getting started.
 
How will the studios work together?
When our UK studio is winding down its 
day, our US studio is just getting started, 
meaning the former can easily hand work 
off to the latter. We‚Äôve retooled our meeting 
schedule to accommodate a designated 
time of 4pm GMT and 9am MST. It‚Äôs going 
smoothly so far, but we‚Äôre just getting started.
At the moment, it‚Äôs the UK studio that‚Äôs 
doing the lion‚Äôs share of the work but we 
envision it becoming 50/50 as the US family 
grows. The early creative stages of projects 
will be cross-studio and collaborative, and for 
quality control, it‚Äôs likely that one studio will 
then see the project through to production. 
As for managing, it‚Äôs communication, 
communication, communication.
What are the risks and the beneÔ¨Åts of 
setting up a new studio in the US? 
The obvious risks are upfront business 
costs, though we‚Äôve managed to keep 
these relatively lean so far. The beneÔ¨Åts 
are¬†limitless: new opportunities, new clients, 
higher fees and the opportunity to have 
a¬†real cultural impact on a new place.
What are the main differences between 
US¬†and European (or UK) design? 
The States is such a massive place, it‚Äôs not 
really fair to paint the whole industry here 
with one brush. However, there does seem 
to be an approach being championed more 
obviously in European design studios at 
the moment: a depth of strategic thought 
paired with a strong aesthetic sensibility. 
The¬†O¬†Street approach is to begin every 
project with a focus on research, the end 
users‚Äô needs and Ô¨Ånding design solutions 
that yield results. We Ô¨Ånish those projects 
by¬†making sure we have created something 
that looks and feels beautiful.
How do you think US clients will Ô¨Ånd your 
approach compares to US agencies?
The tradition of Swiss modernism runs deep 
on the European side of the Atlantic. Even an 
offbeat studio like ours will impress American 
clients with the care and thoughtfulness we 
bring to their design needs.
What are your plans for future growth? 
We plan to grow how we always have: 
doing good work while being ourselves. 
Our goal is to pick up steam until we have 
a few designers working for us in Denver, 
then repeat the process in another city. 
With¬†the US studio currently in a co-working 
space, we‚Äôre yet to see how that will work 
out physically ‚Äì but we‚Äôre excited about this 
modern era of re-evaluating workspaces.

or the second year 
running, Us By Night 
‚Äì formerly known as 
OFFF By Night ‚Äì took over a vast 
warehouse space in Antwerp with 
giant LED screens, artisan food 
stalls, an array of ping pong tables 
and retro games, and of course a 
three-day programme of inspiring 
talks from some of the world‚Äôs 
most exciting creatives‚Ä¶ 
Diverse topics ranged from 
multi-sensory VR experiences, to 
Aaron Duffy‚Äôs ‚Äò10¬†signs you‚Äôre an 
advertophile‚Äô ‚Äì but a sentiment 
shared by many speakers was the 
value of creative experimentation, 
and how to create an environment 
in which it‚Äôs possible, and more 
importantly, fruitful.
 ‚ÄúTesting out new technologies 
can inspire you,‚Äù was CATK‚Äôs take. 
Notable for its surreal combinations 
of organic shapes and colours, the 
Berlin-based agency demonstrated 
one such experiment in action: 
Shrooms, a psychedelic feast for the 
eyes that got a round of applause 
from the assembled crowd.
CATK‚Äôs Ô¨Årst major commercial 
project came in 2012, working with 
Wolff Olins on the new Windows 
8 packaging. Despite the huge 
corporate nature of the client, the 
Ô¨Ånal illustrations were all freeform 
creative experiments.
Meanwhile, for Nike Lab‚Äôs 
Ryan Belmont, innovation and 
experimentation is the order of 
the day every day. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like being 
back in college,‚Äù he grinned. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just playing, seeing what 
works.‚Äù One fascinating example 
was an installation at Milan Design 
Week dedicated to the theme 
of movement, which featured 
everything from high-tech motion-
capture technology to a lo-Ô¨Å stack 
of shoeboxes, arranged into a 
sweeping, dynamic curve. 
Belmont also showcased Nike 
Lab‚Äôs collaboration with a small 
group of fashion students from top 
design colleges, which expresses

some of Nike‚Äôs material innovations 
through costume design and dance.
Diversity of style is another likely 
byproduct of experimental spirit. As 
Jonathan Zawada revealed in his 
talk, his illustrations have evolved 
enormously over the course of his 
career. He‚Äôs even pledged to never 
let the client dictate the look and 
feel of a piece, valuing creativity 
over cash ‚Äì if they don‚Äôt like it, 
he¬†won‚Äôt charge so long as he 
can¬†use it for his own purposes.
In fact, for almost three years 
Zawada decided to stop working 
commercially almost entirely in 
order to focus on oil painting 
experiments in Los Angeles. He‚Äôs 
since moved back to a remote part 
of his native Australia so he can do 
the kind of work he loves without 
the constraints of LA‚Äôs cost of living. 
‚ÄùI have a system underpinning 
the way I make work ‚Äì a system for 
curiosity, to explore ideas,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúOften, it‚Äôs about designing without 
intent. Creating an environment to 
mess around in, not consciously 
visualising the outcome.‚Äù
Animator Saiman Chow, when 
discussing the lack of consistency in 
his practice, shrugged that he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot 
wired that way‚Äù ‚Äì in no small part 
because of his ADHD.
‚ÄúI look for new challenges,‚Äù he 
explained. As a teenager, Chow‚Äôs 
family emigrated from Hong Kong 
to LA following the Tiananmen 
Square massacre. Adaptation was 
tough, and themes of social isolation 
permeate much of his work.
‚ÄúIn school, the most fun I had 
was huddled in the corner painting,‚Äù 
he recalled. Like Zawada, Chow had 
a epiphany: he decided to focus on 
himself and consciously dial back 
the commercial work. ‚ÄúMoney is 
not¬†my motivation,‚Äù he insisted.
Mario Hugo, co-founder of New 
York-based creative agency Hugo 
& Marie, mischievously described 
his own creative direction process 
as like drink-driving. ‚ÄúMy thinking is 
cyclical, disorganised and spiralling,‚Äù 
Clockwise

conference 
chairs for rugs

of his creative 
experiments;

white acted as

for creativity.
he confessed. Like Zawada, he is 
prickly about client intervention: 
‚ÄúI¬†want to explore things that I want 
to explore, not the things my clients 
want me to do,‚Äù he shrugged.
 Boutique Swiss agency Studio 
Feixen has its own system to aid 
freedom of expression: ‚ÄúWe think in 
games,‚Äù explained co-founder Felix 
Pf√§ffli. ‚ÄúOur process doesn‚Äôt lead to 
one outcome, but a set of rules that 
govern many outcomes.‚Äù
One example was an education 
project that explored how a group 
of people can design something 
truly collaboratively. One group 
established a system whereby half 
of them would try to write the word 
‚Äòplay‚Äô using a grid of paper titles, 
while the other half tried to destroy 
it by ripping them up. A second 
group turned the creative process 
into a dance, passing shapes and 
colours around between them.
As all these examples attest, 
formulaic thinking and box-ticking 
will get you nowhere creatively.

L
ately, I‚Äôve been thinking about thinking. 
Almost every weekday morning, I walk 
down the hill from home to the Baxter and 
Bailey studio in central Brighton. It‚Äôs a lovely walk, 
downhill all the way (and consequently less lovely on 
the homeward leg), and is a half-hour window to get 
my thoughts in order before diving into the emails, 
phone calls, catch-ups, discussions and the demands 
of the studio day. Every morning for the past week, 
I‚Äôve walked past the same flyposter. It appears to be 
promoting a gallery show and it says this, in glitchy 
and distressed uppercase typography: KEEP 
MOVING, STOP THINKING.
The poster achieved exactly half of its stated aim, 
in that I did indeed keep moving. But what it failed 
to¬†convince me to do was to stop thinking. In fact, it 
did the opposite. And what it made me¬†start¬†thinking 
was: ‚ÄòGet off my case, glitchy typographic poster, 
we¬†need more thinking not less.‚Äô In fact, other than 
perhaps JUMP IN THIS POOL OF LAVA or POP 
YOUR HEAD INSIDE THIS JUICER, I can‚Äôt think of 
many all-caps commands that are more guaranteed 
to keep me moving very fast in the opposite direction 
while thinking very hard.
KEEP MOVING, STOP THINKING is all very well 
if you‚Äôre running away from bees or the Terminator. 
And while it‚Äôs true that in this industry, the ability 
to¬†move ‚Äì to develop, to evolve, to move forwards 
towards a solution, to relentlessly pursue an idea ‚Äì 
are¬†all vitally important attributes, what we really 
need are thinkers. The best designers are thinking 
designers. All of my design heroes (and I‚Äôm guessing 
some of yours too) are thinkers. Some are conceptual 
thinkers with one foot in the fine art or craft camps 
‚Äì people like Alan Fletcher, Tibor Kalman, Jim 
Sutherland, Vaughan Oliver or Paula Scher. And some 
are more commercial thinkers, always with an eye 
on¬†the brand or the system ‚Äì people like Michael 
Johnson, Michael Bierut or Margaret Calvert. 
What¬†unites this disparate bunch of genii is a 
thoughtfulness in their work: they make brainy, 
deep¬†work that means something to them, their 
clients and their clients‚Äô audiences.
And while I‚Äôm as easily seduced by a beautiful 
aesthetic as the next fickle designer (and just as likely 
to exclaim: ‚ÄòOoh, just look at that fluoro spot colour 
and foil detailing!‚Äô), the design work that really 
delights me is the stuff that‚Äôs clearly been thought 
about. When I see thoughtful, clever or intelligent 
work, the reaction isn‚Äôt quite, ‚ÄòI wish I‚Äôd¬†done¬†that‚Äô, 
but more: ‚ÄòI wish I‚Äôd¬†thought¬†of that.‚Äô
When we founded Baxter and Bailey five years 
ago, we decided straight away to build a thoughtful 
business. The first thing we did, before buying a Mac 
or a chair or a bookshelf or a bag of coffee beans, was 
to sit down for a day in a borrowed Covent Garden 
meeting room and design a thoughtful business plan. 
We thought hard about client sectors that we already 
enjoyed working in or had good track record in, and 
we actively avoided sectors we didn‚Äôt like. We thought 
hard about mistakes we‚Äôd made in our design pasts 
and made firm commitments not to repeat them.
When thinking about and writing this business 
plan, we also tried to ensure that the design business 
we were creating allowed us to be thoughtful outside 
of the studio too. Dom and I were both already dads 
by this point and consequently were becoming 
experts in dad jokes and dad 
dancing, and were in¬†danger 
of¬†developing an irrational 
fondness for fleeces. So we 
committed to think hard about 
ways in which our business 
could be ambitious, brave and 
brilliant while allowing us to 
be good parents too. We were 
keen not to fall into all of those 
classic design studio shabby 
habits: habitual late hours, 
weekend working, neglectful 
parenting. And while this 
thoughtful approach doesn‚Äôt 
always work perfectly in 
practice ‚Äì I‚Äôm typing this on 
a¬†Sunday afternoon ‚Äì we‚Äôre 
giving out-of-hours thoughtfulness our best shot.
In recent years, as the studio has grown, this 
thoughtful approach is still embedded in our DNA 
and informs how we look out for great new designers. 
We‚Äôre firm believers that good designers are thinking 
designers. I‚Äôd go a bit further, and say that designers 
who think deeply and widely about their work are 
already strategists in the broadest sense. They think 
about how the work meets the brief, how clearly it 
will communicate, how well it marries up with the 
brand strategy or aims or ambitions. And, if they‚Äôre 
really good, they‚Äôll think about all of this carefully 
and make it look brilliant too. And if they‚Äôre nice 
people with excellent taste in¬†biscuits too, we‚Äôre sold.
Maybe it‚Äôs time for a flyposting campaign of our 
own. I can see it now: clean, clear, bold and brilliant 
all-caps typography. Not a glitch or a distressed 
texture in sight. And the copy? KEEP MOVING BY 
ALL MEANS, BUT FOR GAWD‚ÄôS SAKE, THINK!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very easy when you‚Äôre running 
a¬†small studio to become completely 
consumed by the job you‚Äôre working 
on. Often weeks go by in a relentless 
pursuit for perfection as everything 
else is put on hold. One thing I‚Äôve learnt 
over the last few years, is that your 
best¬†work rarely comes from working 
in¬†this way. In 2018, I would like to 
remember to take a step back, even 
when the pressure is on. If something 
isn‚Äôt working, not to force it ‚Äì and to 
give myself the time to make sure it‚Äôs 
right. To try and ensure this happens, 
I‚Äôm moving our daily studio catch ups 
to the end of the day ‚Äì the idea being 
that this should act as a consistent 
reminder to go home and rest.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor me, this January marks surviving 
two years of self-employment. Working 
as a freelancer can be somewhat feast 
or famine ‚Äì either I‚Äôm too busy for side 
projects, or I‚Äôm spending my quieter 
periods trying to drum up more work, 
feeling guilty at the prospect of 
spending a couple of days learning 
something new. Entering year two with 
regular clients and a more consistent 
workÔ¨Çow feels like a good time for 
some creative resolutions ‚Äì to learn 
some of the other Adobe CC apps that 
I¬†already pay for, practise hand 
lettering more and improve my 
photography skills. I also need to 
just¬†pick up a pencil or pen and draw 
more, even if no one sees it but me.‚Äù

E  
very year, I make the 
same new year‚Äôs 
resolution: to stop 
biting my nails. I then badly 
paint my poor stubs for about a week until my boyfriend complains 
of the smell of nail polish remover and I have an excuse to give in. 
This year, I‚Äôm not bothering with the facade. I‚Äôve Ô¨Ånally accepted that 
biting my nails is linked to anxiety, and if I‚Äôve got any hope of growing 
them, I‚Äôd better address the underlying issue instead. 
Like many creatives, I‚Äôm a perfectionist, and this urge for perfection 
is both a blessing and a curse. While it means I strive to do the best job 
I possibly can, sometimes I completely lose perspective. My nightmares 
are made of misplaced apostrophes, misspelt names and unchecked 
facts. Just the thought of a past mistake is enough to send me on a spiral 
of despair, and while I know I‚Äôm good at my job, all it takes is one error 
and I‚Äôll disregard a whole project as a failure. 
That creative drive also means I get obsessed easily. I get so gripped 
by an idea that I Ô¨Ånd it hard to think or talk about anything else. The 
problem for me comes when my sleep is disturbed ‚Äì that‚Äôs my red 
Ô¨Çag, and I have to remind myself to do something about it before the 
obsession quickly becomes sleep itself. How many hours did I get 
last night? Why did I wake up at 3am? Can I get away with cancelling 
everything until I get a solid 
eight hours? (Sorry people with 
young children, but some of us 
are still chasing that dream.)
The more I talk about this, the more I Ô¨Ånd that it‚Äôs not just me. I‚Äôve 
also come to realise that while some of my best ideas have been in the 
middle of the night, I‚Äôm perfectly capable of thinking and creating 
during working hours, as long as I‚Äôm well-rested. A surplus of ideas is 
useless if you‚Äôre too tired to execute them properly.
I think we all need to remember that however important we think 
our work is, a job is just a job. It‚Äôs not worth losing sleep over. It‚Äôs not 
worth working yourself to the bone and neglecting everything and 
everyone else, not worth feeling the need to check your emails outside 
of¬†work hours. Most of all, it‚Äôs not worth neglecting yourself. 
That‚Äôs why this year, my new year‚Äôs resolution is to make a conscious 
eÔ¨Äort to tackle my anxiety head on, and give myself both the time and 
space to do so, regardless of the state of my nails. I‚Äôm determined to take 
more care of myself, to take a step back when I feel things getting on top 
of me, to prioritise a good night‚Äôs sleep and to Ô¨Ånd more time to do the 
things I¬†love, outside of work. I urge you to do the same.   
How are you going to take better care of yourself this year? Tweet your

‚ÄúThis is a fantastic example of concept-driven 
branding. Whoever came up with the snout 
lockup, I tip my hat to you for keeping a 
strong playful element without that godawful 
illustration. Bravo. I also love the animation 
application of the logo to give the sense of 
space. This is a really solid rebrand and the 
application of it is gorgeous. One thing I was 
interested to see is whether the design team 
would change the jingle to match the dropping 
of the .com ‚Äòmoooonpig dot com‚Äô. (Sorry if 
that‚Äôs now looping in your head.) Interestingly, 
they have dropped the ‚Äò.com‚Äô and replaced it 
with a whistle. I‚Äôm unsure how this will pan 
out, and whether they will drop all the spoken 
words for the tonal melody of it all, so it 
currently seems a bit unÔ¨Ånished.‚Äù
‚ÄúWorking with Moonpig‚Äôs creative director 
James Turner and his in-house design team, 
my own team and I adopted an ‚Äòinside-out‚Äô 
approach to this rebrand. Basing ourselves 
in Moonpig‚Äôs office, surrounded by its weird 
and wonderful products, we quickly got 
to understand the company, its customers 
and culture. We interpreted Moonpig‚Äôs 
new positioning into a simple idea: ‚ÄòLife is 
more light-hearted on the moon.‚Äô With this 
thinking at the core, we were able to entice 
people into our weightless world. A key part 
of this was the commission of a bespoke font 
by Face37 in three styles: lift, wobble and 
shake. To create more stretch to the visual 
identity we designed a fun app icon ‚Äì our 
pig‚Äôs snout ‚Äì based on the two ‚ÄòO‚Äôs, and an 
extended version of the logotype, to interact 
with its signature jingle.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never minded the charmingly kitsch original 
brand of Moonpig. Yes, it wasn‚Äôt particularly 
sophisticated, but it still tried to convey a sense 
of joy and wonder for gift giving. But like many 
dot-com era brands, its identity aged, and to 
keep up with modern gift-focused outlets 
such as Not On The High Street and Etsy, it 
desperately needed to be updated. The rebrand 
shoots for the moon and nails it ‚Äì striking a 
fantastic balance between sophistication and 
playfulness. It‚Äôs charming, clever and modern, 
allowing it to sit with other gift sites easily. 
The playful typography, the soft pastel colours, 
the snout icon ‚Äì all exemplify the joyful sense 
of gift giving in an incredibly simple manner. 
More importantly, it transitions Moonpig from 
a last-minute, quick-Ô¨Åx solution for cards into 
the go-to place for gift giving.‚Äù

ATYPI IDENTITY

Entrusted with the design of the 2017 identity for Montreal-
based typography conference ATypi, graphic designer Julien 
H√©bert took the opportunity to challenge the traditional 
conventions of type design. Channelling Montreal‚Äôs ‚Äúmultiple 
personalities‚Äù, H√©bert pulled together a wide variety of 
loud typefaces and beautiful custom lettering to create 
a¬†joyful¬†typographic tapestry.
‚ÄúThe design had to convey Montreal‚Äôs dualities, quirkiness 
and boldness,‚Äù recalls H√©bert. ‚ÄúI wanted each element of the 
identity to feel special, while maintaining a common graphic 
language. As the communications leading to the event were 
numerous and published over very long period, it was crucial 
to create a Ô¨Çexible system that wasn‚Äôt redundant.‚Äù

web-based illustrations for an article on forced marriage ‚Äì 
entitled ‚ÄòI am too young to marry you‚Äô ‚Äì he worked closely 
with the IRC team to bring to life an interview in Rumbek 
with¬†‚ÄòRachel‚Äô and her 13-year-old daughter ‚ÄòHelena‚Äô.
‚ÄúI broke the story down into three events: the treatment of 
the young girl as a commodity, the threat of violence she had 
to endure and the Ô¨Ånal homecoming,‚Äù explains Blow. ‚ÄúI wanted 
to convey a strong sense of place, which involved researching 
and absorbing the South Sudanese landscape. I also wanted 
the young girl to be identiÔ¨Åed quickly and graphically, so the 
use of a wedding dress was simple and effective.‚Äù

THE SCARY¬†ROOM
SPIN/ADVENTURES IN TYPOGRAPHY 2
by Unit Editions 
www.spin.co.uk
London design studio Spin embarked on 
a¬†journey into typography‚Äôs darkest recesses 
in the second issue of Spin/Adventures in 
Typography, aiming to promote an interest 
in experimental design and typography.
‚ÄúOur aesthetic approach was driven by 
play, trial and error, and a desire to go into 
what we call ‚Äòthe scary room‚Äô,‚Äù says Spin‚Äôs 
Tony Brook. ‚ÄúThat said, we hoped to make 
it¬†enjoyable to engage with.‚Äù
Making the physical experiments 
work¬†was challenging at times, he admits. 
‚ÄúWe¬†didn‚Äôt really have a clear idea of where 
we were heading.‚Äù However, these are 
his favourite parts of the Ô¨Ånal publication. 
‚ÄúIt¬†was so exciting and kind of hilarious to 
see them coming together,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúThey 
are reassuringly unexpected and weird.‚Äù

CRAFTY BRANDING 
FIERCE & NOBLE IDENTITY
by Halo 
www.wearehalo.co.uk
Bristol studio Halo was approached to create a strategy, name, brand identity 
and packaging for a new craft brewery in St Werburghs, Bristol. The name 
‚Äì Fierce & Noble ‚Äì represents the brewery team‚Äôs Ô¨Åerce independence and 
respect for the heritage of the craft, while the bold creative, custom type and 
bespoke patterns reÔ¨Çect the local vibrancy of its location.
‚ÄúThe product needed to jump out on bar and shelf,‚Äù explains Halo design 
director Andy German. ‚ÄúAnd what with the brewery being in a creative vibrant 
area of Bristol with other craft breweries in it, it made sense for the building to 
stand out and be seen. The main pattern for the brand was based around the 
ampersand we made ‚Äì my eyes went a bit fuzzy creating this one.‚Äù

UPS AND DOWNS
WHAT IS BIPOLAR DISORDER?
by Uncle Ginger 
www.uncleginger.com
 
Commissioned by TED-Ed ‚Äì TED‚Äôs youth 
and education initiative ‚Äì UK animation 
studio Uncle Ginger created an animation 
responding to the script by Helen M. Farrell, 
‚ÄòWhat is Bipolar Disorder?‚Äô 
‚ÄúWe wanted to Ô¨Ånd a way to aid 
the script by simply and sensitively 
communicating the disorder to people with 
little knowledge of it, without oversimplifying 
or belittling the huge effect it has on so 
many people on a daily basis,‚Äù explains 
Uncle Ginger co-founder Hugh Cowling.
‚ÄúWe looked initially at ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s 
medical journal and book cover design 
for the way they intimately communicate 
subject matter that‚Äôs both poignant and 
complex,‚Äù adds co-founder Owen Gent. 
The pair quickly discovered that by 
limiting themselves to just shape, colour, 
motion and sound, there was very little to 
hide behind. ‚ÄúEach tiny detail had to be 
just¬†right,‚Äù says Cowling.  
ENCRYPTED TYPE

When IBM Systems Magazine asked 
Sawdust to illustrate an article about a 
paradigm shift in the industry ‚Äì from 
selective encryption, to simply encrypting 
everything ‚Äì the duo looked to the cyber 
world for inspiration. ‚ÄúWe were asked 
to visualise the text ‚ÄòParadigm Shift to 
Pervasive Encryption‚Äô in a way that spoke 
to the written piece,‚Äù recalls designer Rob 
Gonzalez. ‚ÄúWe liked the idea of super 
computers and giant servers being the 
typography ‚Äì who wouldn‚Äôt?‚Äù
Finding a balance between image 
and type, proved challenging. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Ô¨Åne 
line and often what can happen is one 
becomes compromised by the other,‚Äù 
adds designer Jonathan Quainton. ‚ÄúThat 
balance is always a challenge to get right.‚Äù¬†

She says that one of the biggest dangers 
of staying at a studio too long is becoming

FEBRUARY 2018
01   
KNOW YOUR GOAL
Promotions don‚Äôt just occur 
with time anymore. You must clearly 
demonstrate how you meet the 
requirements of a new role ‚Äì so¬†make 
sure you know where you want to 
be and exactly what that position 
entails, and then look to take on more 
responsibility in your current job. 
02 
CHANGE HOW THE 
STUDIO WORKS
One of the best ways to prove your 
value is to make your studio more 
eÔ¨Écient or save the team money. 
Pay aention to processes, and look 
to other departments or studios for 
inspiration. As well as saving resources, 
streamlining workÔ¨Çow also shows an 
understanding of the bigger picture.
03   
SEEK FEEDBACK
You‚Äôll need to get your 
boss on side for a promotion, so 
book a meeting to Ô¨Ånd out what you 
need to do to get to a higher level 
within your studio. Ask about your 
manager‚Äôs objectives, too, so you can 
focus on helping them be successful. 
Communication is key, so¬†seek 
feedback from your boss as well 
as¬†other team members.
04  
DEMONSTRATE 
COMMITMENT
Striking a home-life balance is 
important, but if a crucial project 
deadline is looming, volunteering to 
work late ‚Äì or simply to take on more 
work or help in an area outside your 
normal job role ‚Äì shows commitment. 
(Just make sure working late doesn‚Äôt 
become expected.)
05  
USE YOUR 
INITIATIVE
Don‚Äôt sit around waiting to be told 
what to do ‚Äì if you can see a way to 
help a project or add value, suggest 
it. A well-timed ‚ÄòI noticed that [certain 
task] needs doing ‚Äì I‚Äôll do that now‚Äô 
will¬†go further than you might think.

that interest you and aim for the ones 
whose work, philosophy and overall 
approach you genuinely admire. ‚ÄúReal 
enthusiasm and shared passions will 
come across and increase the chances of a 
great Ô¨Åt,‚Äù she points out. ‚ÄúSo¬†who do you 
really want to¬†work for, and why?‚Äù
She continues. ‚ÄúAlso, don‚Äôt be shy ‚Äì try 
getting in touch directly with the people 
you admire for an informal chat. A 
personal connection or recommendation 
of some sort always helps. Just remember: 
don‚Äôt act like a stalker.‚Äù 
Koto senior brand strategist Tom 
Moloney agrees that asking people you 
admire for career advice is a good move. 
‚ÄúAsk your mates and colleagues who they 
rate; where they‚Äôve worked; who they 
know. Just don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm thinking about 
moving on‚Ä¶‚Äô Ô¨Årst,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúAlso, get 
your shit together ‚Äì your CV, website, 
portfolio; whatever it is. There‚Äôs no 
shortcut. Just start doing it.‚Äù
Moloney took the opportunity to 
refocus his career by moving to Koto in 
September, after six years at NB Studio. 
‚ÄúIt¬†was a combination of things: a very 
personal desire for a new challenge, and 
a¬†professional ambition to focus on brand 
strategy,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúBy moving to Koto, 
I was able to achieve both of these.‚Äù
He agrees that when it comes to 
knowing it‚Äôs time to move on from your 
current role, there are warning signs to 
watch out for. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not looking 
forward to going to work the majority of 
the time, or your motivation is dropping 
and you know that you‚Äôre not giving the 
role or your work your best eÔ¨Äort, then 
it‚Äôs¬†time to move on,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut that 
doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs easy to leave 
somewhere, or to Ô¨Ånd a new job.‚Äù
This is especially true if you‚Äôve been 
out of the job-seeking game for a while, 
or¬†you‚Äôve been too comfortable in one 
role¬†for too long. Many long-serving 
employees report a creeping uneasiness 
about the transferable value of their 
speciÔ¨Åc skills. If¬†you feel like this, it‚Äôs 
a¬†clear sign that you‚Äôre in danger of 
becoming institutionalised ‚Äì and the 
only¬†way to tackle it is to initiate change.
START YOUR OWN STUDIO
If you‚Äôre not feeling fully satisÔ¨Åed in your 
current position, another option is to start 
your own studio ‚Äì which is exactly what 
Studio Texture founder Stuart Youngs did 
in March 2017. Previously a partner at 
brand consultancy Purpose, he launched 
Texture for one reason: autonomy. 
‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs crucial for studios to 
explore, experiment and take risks in 
pursuit of progress,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our 
creativity and ability to innovate that 
makes us attractive to clients. But to 
pioneer takes time, investment and an 
awful lot of practice. In my experience, 
that‚Äôs more difficult to do in a studio with 
bigger overheads and demands, where 
failure is often not an option.‚Äù
In his new role, Youngs is no longer 
accountable to a board. He has sole 
accountability to his family, team and 
clients. And although he admits this is far 
more pressure, he can now move faster 
and is free to make mistakes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 
sharpened the mind and, interestingly, 
made me more purposeful,‚Äù he reÔ¨Çects.   
So what about Brexit? Given our 
current political and economical 
backdrop, is there an argument for staying 
secure in a role ‚Äì even if it isn‚Äôt creatively 
satisfying anymore? Not according to 
Youngs. ‚ÄúThe age of security has long 
since gone,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe world is moving 
too fast for that. Today, it‚Äôs essential to be 
looking to tomorrow.‚Äù
For Youngs, the single biggest industry 
threat faced by designers who want to get 
a new job is fear, and the paralysis it 
perpetuates. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt aÔ¨Äord to sit still 
and hope,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI believe we‚Äôre on the 
cusp of the biggest transformation our 
industry has ever seen. We‚Äôre about to 
enter the age, not just of artiÔ¨Åcial

intelligence, but the more profound 
augmented intelligence. The consequence 
is even more pressure on creativity and 
ideas; on originality and distinction ‚Äì 
where the machines can‚Äôt compete.‚Äù
That said, don‚Äôt feel you have to move 
jobs for the sake of it. ‚ÄúNobody should feel 
uncomfortable just from being in a studio 
for a long period of time,‚Äù he points out. 
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre challenged, progressing and 
fulÔ¨Ålled, you should stay put. The grass 
isn‚Äôt greener. Promise.‚Äù
And don‚Äôt move purely for money. 
‚ÄúIf¬†you‚Äôre moving for money, you‚Äôre 
missing the point. Move for opportunity. 
Money will follow if you pick the right 
opportunities and you‚Äôll be much happier.‚Äù 
GET A PROMOTION
Of course, you don‚Äôt have to change 
studios to Ô¨Ånd new opportunities. 
Your¬†studio might not be advertising 
new¬†job roles, but if you can make yourself 
invaluable to the team, you‚Äôre in a strong 
position to negotiate a promotion. 
Reiss Hinds started at multi-
disciplinary design agency BLUP on 
a¬†three-month placement as a junior 
designer. During that time, he paid 
attention to the daily process and 
workÔ¨Çows used by his directors. ‚ÄúEmail 
was the biggest one,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúWe were 
going back and forth so many times for 
alterations, so instead I suggested that we 
use Basecamp as our project management 
tool. It‚Äôs cut down our email time and kept 
all client services projects in one place.‚Äù
He continues: ‚ÄúI tried to provide my 
directors with as much value as possible 
‚Äì no job was too large for me to tackle. 
When my three months came to an end, 
I¬†suggested that there was a need in the 
business for someone to help streamline 
and execute on brand strategy, for both 
our clients and for Studio BLUP‚Äôs brand.‚Äù
His advice? ‚ÄúFind a gap in either the 
market or in someone else‚Äôs business 
that¬†you know you can enhance, and 

INDUSTRY ISSUES
01   
GO FREELANCE 
If it‚Äôs really time to move on 
from your current job but you can 
Ô¨Ånd the right opportunity, then one 
option is to go freelance. Get yourself 
a website, business cards and separate 
business bank account, and once 
you‚Äôve got some clients you‚Äôre good to 
go. (For more info, read Four Routes 
into Freelance Life, see CA .)
02 
TAKE ON SHIFTS  
Your favourite local agency 
might not be hiring ‚Äì but they might 
occasionally need holiday cover or 
extra resource for a big project. If 
you can become a trusted freelancer 
through shi work, you‚Äôll be Ô¨Årst in line 
when a suitable position does come 
up. And if nothing else, you‚Äôll have 
broadened your portfolio. 
03   
SET UP YOUR OWN 
CREATIVE BUSINESS
Not sure about going it alone? Then 
pool your resources and set up a 
collective or studio. With the laer 
option it‚Äôs a good idea to seek out a 
business partner with complementary 
skills to yours ‚Äì and make sure you 
draw up a contract, too.
04  
DO SOME PRO  
BONO WORK
Charity work can be a good way to 
balance an unsatisfactory day job. If 
you pick the right project, it‚Äôll give you 
valuable experience and develop your 
portfolio, making you more employable 
when that perfect job does come up. 
So think about where you want to be, 
and look for a local pro bono project 
that might help you get there.

in¬†return you could end up becoming 
the next big creative in your space.‚Äù
MOVE CLIENT-SIDE
Sometimes Ô¨Ånding a better job involves 
playing the long game, as creative 
entrepreneur Simon Waterfall explains. 
The former D&AD president Ô¨Årst started 
talking to Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia 
in 2014. Three years later, it took Waterfall 
‚Äì who‚Äôs co-founded a number of leading 
digital studios and consultancies, 
including Poke, Fray, Social Suicide and 
Deepend ‚Äì a total of 29 interviews over 
six¬†months to land his new job as creative 
director of Samara, Airbnb‚Äôs recently 
launched design and innovation studio. 
That many interviews might have put 
oÔ¨Ä other candidates, but not Waterfall. 
So¬†why was he so committed to moving 
client-side at Airbnb? ‚ÄúI was looking for 
a¬†very simple thing: I wanted to change 
the world,‚Äù he explains. 
‚ÄúHow many places, people or brands 
can do that? Where are they? What do 
they do? Have they done it before? When 
you address these points, there are only 
a¬†handful of companies ‚Äì and most are in 
Silicon Valley,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúWorking 
inside means you‚Äôre already in charge of 
the biggest asset: the community and 
audience you want to change.‚Äù
When you‚Äôre aiming for the stars, like 
Waterfall, reaching your goals isn‚Äôt going 
to happen overnight. He says you have to 
be prepared to really grind ‚Äì and advises 
being patient. ‚ÄúBig dreams need time to 
solidify,‚Äù he reasons. 
And he agrees that the biggest industry 
threat to designers isn‚Äôt the likes of Brexit 
and a Ô¨Çailing economy, but simply sitting 
still. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the tiny, almost unnoticeable 
threats that are the real killer,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúMurder by Powerpoint; death by 
meetings about meetings. Don‚Äôt go 
quiet,¬†my friends: scream into the page 
and tear it up. Good luck 2018.‚Äù

Some raise a smile, others eyebrows, but 
one thing‚Äôs for sure: Wilfrid Wood‚Äòs 
sculptures are never boring...
W I L F R I D  W O O D _ London-born Wilfrid grew up in rural Sussex, before studying 
graphics at Central St Martins. After a stint in publishing, he trained as a ‚Äòheadbuilder‚Äô 
for satirical TV show Spitting Image, then set up shop as a freelance sculptor, now 
based in Hackney Wick. His work is provocative and playful in equal measure, and 
some pieces may cause offence to some readers. See more at www.wilfridwood.com

who doesn‚Äôt? Any situation can be 
enhanced with an element of nudity.  
Nude nude nude. See, I can‚Äôt stop 
saying it now.
You have an artistic family, and you 
said in your Something Good talk 
that it was hard to Ô¨Ånd your own 
voice. How did you go about it?
I read an interview with the actor 
Michael Douglas, son of Kirk 
Douglas, who said ‚Äòthe children 
of famous parents tend to be slow 
developers‚Äô. I found it reassuring. 
The artists in my family weren‚Äôt 
exactly famous, but they were well 
known within their Ô¨Åelds. They 
were strong personalities and had 
traditional views about how art 
should be done. At college, I was 
very bunged up with these received 
ideas. I envied people whose parents 
were accountants, who weren‚Äôt 
hamstrung by artistic convention. 
I tried to be a designer, then an 
illustrator, and for a while I wrote 
a lot of stories ‚Äì none of which 
amounted to anything. Aged 30 
I¬†started sculpting, which released 
me. Even so, it‚Äôs only over the last 
few years that I feel I‚Äôm doing 
what¬†I¬†really want to.
How did you carve a niche for 
yourself as a satirical sculptor? 
There were painters and designers 
and illustrators in my family, but no 
sculptors. I think that‚Äôs one of the 
reasons I‚Äôve always liked doing 3D 
stuÔ¨Ä, because it was diÔ¨Äerent. 
The satirical bit is inÔ¨Çuenced 
by my time at Spitting Image, plus 
my tendency to try and make jokes. 
Now I think of myself as more of a 
portrait artist: I‚Äôm mainly drawing 
and sculpting real people I¬†know 
rather than celebrities.
are celebrities, making use of his 
experience crafting political puppets 
for satirical TV show Spitting Image, 
but increasingly they are the result of 
private commissions. In other words, 
people who want to be sculpted, and 
are happy to pay for the privilege.
One thing‚Äôs certain: of all the 
talks at Bristol‚Äôs Something Good 
festival in October, Wood was 
certainly the most memorable ‚Äì so 
we were curious to Ô¨Ånd out more... 
What did Spitting Image teach you 
about the craft of caricature ‚Äì any 
lessons you still apply today?
It was a panicky and hilarious job, 
with tight deadlines, burning hot 
glue, noxious gases and puppets 
with squints. I had no technical 
background and barely knew how 
to drill a hole. I mainly Ô¨Åtted up 
eyeballs and blinks ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt very 
creative ‚Äì although I did go on to 
make a few heads and animals. 
I got my best practical tip a couple 
of months ago. I was watching an 
interview from the ‚Äô80s with my 
old boss Roger Law. He simply said 
that it‚Äôs not the eyes, or the nose, or 
any other features that are the key 
to getting the likeness of someone. 
It‚Äôs¬†the overall shape of the head.
Many of your sculptures feature 
nudity, usually in a comic way, and 
your experience of sourcing life-
drawing models on Grindr was a 
particularly memorable anecdote. 
What‚Äôs the fascination?
Nudity is something you can get 
away with in art that you can‚Äôt in 
everyday life. The only legitimate 
way most people get to stare at live 
naked bodies is a life drawing class.
We‚Äôre all nude, but cover it up 
with clothes! Of course I love nudity, 
W 
ilfrid Wood 
doesn‚Äôt shy away 
from a bit of 
artistic nudity, 
as the piece on 
the previous page 
attests. ‚ÄúIn all 
my¬†glory,‚Äù was 
the coy one-line response to our 
request  for a self-portrait image.
His portfolio includes some more 
sexualised curiosities too, that may 
not be to everyone‚Äôs taste: Trainer 
Fetish features a teenager playing

rent boys, sex dolls and BDSM.

other people they follow. You follow 
classy people, you‚Äôre shown classy 
stuÔ¨Ä. That‚Äôs basically it, isn‚Äôt it?
Most of Instagram is crap, but 
there‚Äôs so much there that if even 
one per cent of it is brilliant, that‚Äôs 
enough. I‚Äôve bought art, met people 
and been commissioned from it.
You also quoted Victor Hugo: 
‚ÄúThe Ô¨Çesh is the surface of the 
unknown.‚Äù Besides your subjects‚Äô 
appearance, how much attention 
do you pay to personality and 
behaviour in your work?
That quote kind of sums up what 
I‚Äôm¬†trying to do. Or it could say, 
‚ÄòDoes the Ô¨Çesh tell you something 
about the person inside, or can it 
be¬†equally misleading?‚Äô 
How much can you deduce 
by looking at someone?¬†If a mass 
murderer walked past you in the 
street, would you notice? When 
you look at your lover, what are you 
seeing? Presumably it‚Äôs not their 
essence; their soul ‚Äì that‚Äôs supposed 
to be intangible. 
Do people end up with the face 
they deserve? Why do we associate 
beauty with truth? I love these types 
of questions. We all love looking at 
people; we are insatiably curious.
Do you have a favourite type of 
caricature, either visually or the 
‚Äòworld‚Äô the person occupies, such 
as¬†politics, music or Ô¨Ålm?  
As an artist who does portraits, 
I¬†should be able to tackle anyone. 
Slightly strange faces are the most 
attractive to me, but any face can 
look strange from certain aspects. 
Sports people are great to sculpt: 
they‚Äôre usually Ô¨Åt, slightly weird 
and manically focused, which is an 
amusing character trait to portray. 
I think my Michael Phelps is one 
of¬†my best, but only because he‚Äôs 
such a brilliant subject.
COMPUTERARTS.CREATIVEBLOQ.COM

What‚Äôs your usual process when 
creating a new sculpture? 
Getting reference these days is a 
piece of piss: type it into Google. If 
it‚Äôs a private individual I‚Äôm sculpting, 
I photograph them, then do some 
drawing, sometimes make a rough 
maquette, and go on to make the 
Ô¨Ånished thing from polymer clay. 
I don‚Äôt do loads of drawings, a 
lot of the development goes into 
the actual sculpture. One annoying 
thing is when the maquette turns 
out to be more immediate and 
dynamic than the Ô¨Ånished thing. 
I¬†want the Ô¨Ånished thing to look 
fresh, but not slap-dash.
You said in your talk: ‚ÄúWhen you 
think the world‚Äôs run out of ideas, 
there‚Äôs always something nutty 
on Instagram.‚Äù How do you get 
the¬†most from the platform?
I love Instagram. You follow people

I¬†can‚Äôt tell from your portrait.‚Äô I was 
pleased to have frustrated him.
What was the hardest satirical 
sculpture you‚Äôve worked on?
In general, I Ô¨Ånd women more 
difficult than men. Pretty women 
are particularly tricky because they 
are by deÔ¨Ånition somewhat bland 
and symmetrical. Men generally 
have bolder features. 
I also assume that women are 
more sensitive about their looks; 
sexist of me I know. A good female 
friend asked me the other day¬†how 
I¬†know that. It‚Äôs a good question. 
I¬†don‚Äôt know it: I assume it.
Have you ever had a strong 
negative¬†reaction from a subject? 
I actually get disappointingly little 
feedback from my subjects. I¬†imagine 
famous people would see¬†me as a 
potential pain in the ass,¬†so don‚Äôt 
like¬†to comment. 
Sometimes when I draw people 
the model is clearly disappointed.  
Recently I drew a guy with very 
Have you ever been tempted 
to¬†caricature President Trump?
Trump is both too easy and too 
difficult to caricature. What can 
I add? There have been hundreds 
of brilliant cartoons about him. 
To most reasonable people Trump 
is weird. No one needs another 
caricature pointing this out. The 
more some people are lampooned, 
the stronger they get. 
Do you feel any responsibility to 
provide a critical, satirical voice 
on¬†particular issues?
I don‚Äôt have a clear feeling for 
politics, and certainly don‚Äôt feel 
any responsibility to comment. 
I usually sit on the fence and am 
equally convinced by both sides of 
the argument. To be honest, I hate 
political ranting in any direction. 
My sculptures aren‚Äôt direct 
political satire. A while ago I sculpted 
Angela Merkel, just for fun. I gave 
her a broad grin. A friend of mine 
who is very political said, ‚ÄòBut what 
do you actually think of Merkel?

prominent nostrils. I happen to like 
prominent nostrils, but that‚Äôs beside 
the point. I possibly exaggerated 
them a bit. And when he saw the 
drawing he said, ‚ÄòThe nose is awful.‚Äô
 There is often a conÔ¨Çict of 
interest between what the artist 
and the sitter are looking for 
in a portrait. The artist wants 
a dramatic, atmospheric or 
characterful drawing. The sitter 
often wants simply to look attractive. 
If I sense a conÔ¨Çict looming, then 
I make it clear to the sitter that I am 
not a portraitist who Ô¨Çatters. If they 
want a beautiÔ¨Åed representation, 
they should go elsewhere.
Finally, what advice would you give 
to an artist or illustrator looking 
to make a name for themselves in 
satirical drawing or sculpture? 
Who would try and make a name for 
themselves in satirical drawing or 
sculpture? About eight people a year? 
It‚Äôs not really a thing to get into, 
is¬†it? I‚Äôd probably trot out some clich√© 
like, ‚ÄòDraw from nature.‚Äô

hat would you like 
to¬†achieve in 2018? 
To kick-start that 
passion project 
you‚Äôve been dreaming of? Leave 
your full-time job and go freelance? 
Learn a¬†new skill? Publish your 
Ô¨Årst book? Start your own studio? 
Sell your designs on Etsy? 
We all have a dream, and 
everyone‚Äôs is diÔ¨Äerent. But perhaps 
the more important question is: 
what are you doing about it? A new 
year is the perfect time to come up 
with a plan, and start actively 
working to achieving it. 
So what‚Äôs stopping you? Well, for 
many people, quite a lot actually: 
The mortgage. Self-doubt. Low 
energy. The seeming unavailability 
of hours in a day. The demands of 
children, or parents. Lack of skills 
or experience. Feeling that you‚Äôre 
too old, or too young.
But while these are all genuine, 
real-world issues, they shouldn‚Äôt be 
the death knell for your ambitions.
Over the next few pages, we‚Äôll 
walk you through some of the most 
common challenges in pursuing 
your dreams, suggest ways to 
overcome them, and hear from 
creatives who‚Äôve done just that. 
CHALLENGE ONE: 
FIND THE TIME 
Let‚Äôs deal with the most common 
issue Ô¨Årst: Ô¨Ånding the time. 
Whenever you want to achieve 
something outside your main 
working hours, the clock always 
seems to be against you. Between 
the office, your commute and daily 
household life, there never seems 
to¬†be a spare minute.
Are things that bad, though? 
Shane Mielke, creative director 
and¬†author of Launch It ‚Äì a book 
of¬†career advice for creatives ‚Äì 
suggests your time might not be 
as¬†limited as you think. 
‚ÄúTake an honest look at your 
day,‚Äù he advises. ‚ÄúFind things you 
might be wasting time on that are 
less important than your goal, or 
that you could be doing more 
efficiently. Things like social media, 
video games, commuting and 
inefficient work habits can all suck 
bits of time from our lives. If you 
can free up 30 minutes every day, 
that adds up to 180 plus hours in a 
year. Excuses are just excuses.‚Äù
Gavin Strange, who works at 
Aardman in Bristol by day and 
pursues multiple fascinating side 
projects by night, oÔ¨Äers an example 
of how that might look in practice. 
‚ÄúFor me, I Ô¨Ånd a routine that I try 
and stick to during the weekdays,‚Äù 
he explains. ‚ÄúI Ô¨Ånish work at 6pm 
and then come home, eat dinner 
with my wife, watch a 30-minute 
TV episode (anything longer eats 
into the night too much) and then 
get cracking on ‚Äòround two‚Äô, as I call 
it. Sometimes, when things get 
really busy, I get up an hour early 
before work to squeeze in extra 
passion projects, or get cracking 
on¬†my lunch hour.‚Äù
That might sound like a tough 
regime, But Strange ‚Äì whose 
self-published book Do Fly serves 
as a motivational tract for creatives 
‚Äì sees it more as a matter of 
creating good habits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about 
Ô¨Ånding the right pattern for you, 
or¬†adapting how you already work,‚Äù 
he¬†explains. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no right or 
wrong way to do it. The hardest 
part is starting, but once you‚Äôve got 
a tiny bit of momentum, it gets 
better and better.‚Äù
CHALLENGE TWO:  
FIND THE ENERGY
But what if you do manage to eke 
out some extra hours, only to Ô¨Ånd 
you don‚Äôt have sufficient energy to 
use them productively? 
‚ÄúI think the amount of energy 
you have ‚Äì or you think you have 
‚Äì relates to the amount of passion 
you have invested in your goals,‚Äù 
says Ariana DeLuca, a New 
York-based art director. ‚ÄúThis is 
why I called my side project The 
Passionate Project (see page 67), 
because making it was like falling 
in love. I was so excited, I had great 
energy, I had butterÔ¨Çies. I was 
getting home from work and I was 
staying up till 3am. To get on the 
‚ÄúI found the initial few months gruelling to 
say the least... but I‚Äôm now working more 
Ô¨Çexibly and creatively than I was before‚Äù

For some, having a baby might 
be a good reason not to leave 
the Ô¨Ånancial security of a 
full-time job. But for ShefÔ¨Åeld-
based illustrator and designer 
Lisa Maltby, it was actually the 
catalyst to do so.
She‚Äôd been working at a 
design agency and things had 
been going well, she recalls. 
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm a real ideas and 
creative person, and there 
wasn‚Äôt a lot of opportunity to 
push ideas as much as I wanted 
to. I didn‚Äôt feel as challenged as 
I did when I Ô¨Årst began.‚Äù
So just a few months after 
having her second child, she 
thought to herself: ‚ÄòLife‚Äôs too 
short.‚Äô ‚ÄúI think kids make you 
feel like that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey 
bring this fresh sense of life, 
where they‚Äôre limitless in their 
imaginations, and you kind of 
want some of that too.‚Äù
After striking out on her own, 
she hasn‚Äôt looked back since. 
‚ÄúI found the initial few months 
gruelling to say the least, 
working on four hours‚Äô sleep 
and going to meetings with 
baby puke down my back,‚Äù 
she says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve since gone 
on to have some amazing 
commissions and opportunities, 
and I‚Äôm now working more 
Ô¨Çexibly and creatively.‚Äù
And that‚Äôs important to 
her psychologically as well 
as Ô¨Ånancially. ‚ÄúMy creativity 
has always been part of my 
self-expression, as well as 
wanting it to be a career,‚Äù she 
stresses. ‚ÄúSo it was almost my 
way of survival: that I wasn‚Äôt 
just knee-deep in nappies, 
that I had something else.‚Äù

computer and create this, and 
know I was doing something 
I¬†absolutely loved, gave me that 
extra shot of energy.‚Äù 
Carolyn Porter, a graphic 
designer from Minnesota, tells a 
similar tale. Her love of old-time 
handwriting propelled her to create 
her own font, which mimicked the 
script of a real-life wartime letter. 
That project subsequently spun 
into a book, Marcel‚Äôs Letters: A 
Font And The Search for One 
Man‚Äôs Fate, which she based on the 
research she‚Äôd done into the letter‚Äôs 
original author. ‚ÄúI think if you Ô¨Ånd 
a project that you‚Äôre passionate 
about, you just have to be relentless 
and tenacious about bringing that 
project to life,‚Äù says Porter. ‚ÄúIt may 
not be fast, it‚Äôs not going to be easy. 
But it‚Äôs ultimately worth it, and you 
just need to be tenacious.‚Äù
CHALLENGE THREE: 
LIFE GETTING IN THE WAY
All this can be easier said than 
done, of course, as life has a habit 
of getting in the way. A child or 
family member gets sick. The roof 
starts leaking. You‚Äôre handed a 
huge project at work and have to 
work later hours than usual. 
The solution? Accept that life is 
not perfect, sure‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt give 
up, and try to Ô¨Ånd new ways to 
hang on to your goals. 
‚ÄúSometimes life or other projects 
are more important,‚Äù says Mielke. 
‚ÄúIn life, you have to go where the 
Ô¨Åres are at. But that doesn‚Äôt mean 
you can‚Äôt still play mental tetris 
with, say, the logistics of a side 
project, in those moments of the 
day that don‚Äôt have your complete 
attention: when you‚Äôre working 
out, in the bathroom, on your 
commute. The¬†organisation and 
planning of a¬†project or goal is the 
foundation and support of the 
physical action of the idea.‚Äù
And when things get sticky, 
Strange stresses one key word: 
positivity. ‚ÄúJust approaching 
everything you do with a positive 
mind state can work wonders,‚Äù 
he¬†enthuses. ‚ÄúIt presents obstacles 
as opportunities, which helps 
immensely when it‚Äôs 1.30am and 
you‚Äôre not sure if you can succeed. 
You need all these little boosts to 
help you through all of your 
creative endeavours.‚Äù
CHALLENGE FOUR: 
FIND THE MONEY
Sometimes, your dreams don‚Äôt just 
demand your time and energy; 
they need a bit of seed money too. 
You might need some cash, for 
example, to pay for that course, 
print your own book or magazine, 
or to get you through the Ô¨Årst few 
months of going freelance. 
The most obvious approach is 
to¬†start watching the pennies and 
save up a nest egg. That‚Äôs not  a 
particularly fun prospect, but make 
a few lifestyle sacriÔ¨Åces and keep a 
careful eye on your budget, and it 
After Ô¨Åve years working at design 
agencies across Yorkshire, people 
thought Amy Kilner was crazy to 
chuck in her job and go back to 
college. But the 24-year-old from 
Rotherham was adamant. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never 
completed my design degree because 
I got a design job in my second year 
and left uni,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúBut as 
I got older, I realised I needed to go 
back and Ô¨Ånish it.‚Äù 
She eventually did so, funding 
herself through a mix of student 
loans and freelancing. And as an 
unexpected byproduct, she ended 
up selling a piece of her student  
work to superstar DJ Fatboy Slim. 
‚ÄúIt was a typography project for 
my course,‚Äù Kilner explains. ‚ÄúThe brief 
was to create a poster based on song 
lyrics, anything we wanted. I chose the 
words to Eat, Sleep, Rave, Repeat. 
When I‚Äôd completed it, I posted it on 
Instagram, tagged it, and didn‚Äôt think 
any more about it.‚Äù
A few days later, the star‚Äôs manager 
emailed to ask if he could buy the 
illustration. Kilner agreed, and then 
the DJ himself emailed, requesting a 
signed copy to display in his home 
alongside artwork by Banksy, 
Chemical X and Jimmy Cauty. ‚ÄúI was 
like, ‚ÄòOh my God, this is not real!‚Äô‚Äù
It‚Äôs one of many successes she‚Äôs 
had since returning to education, 
convincing her she‚Äôs made the right 
decision. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken the normal 
career route,‚Äù she admits, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs got 
me to where I am, and I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd never completed my design degree 
because I got a design job in my second 
year, but I realised I needed to Ô¨Ånish it‚Äù

should be achievable. Plus of 
course, if you‚Äôre foregoing that nice 
bottle of¬†wine or subscription to 
Sky, it‚Äôs only going to help you Ô¨Ånd 
that extra time you need to pursue 
your creative goals.
 But what if you‚Äôre impatient 
to¬†get started right now? That 
shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, says 
Mielke, it‚Äôs just a case of which part 
of your plan you get started on. 
‚ÄúGoogle is free, and so research and 
planning costs you nothing other 
than time,‚Äù he points out. ‚ÄúSo 
switch gears to a part of your plan 
that might be more organisational 
and can be done during free time at 
night or on weekends. For example, 
if you‚Äôre wanting to self-publish a 
book about your favourite design 
topic, there‚Äôs nothing stopping you 
from researching how to get your 
book on Amazon, or making a list 
of possible printers who might 
print your physical book.‚Äù
Of course, saving is not the 
only¬†solution to money issues. 
Alternatively, you could visit the 
bank and see whether they can 
oÔ¨Äer you a loan, or equity release 
on your home. If they say no, try 
another bank or building society. 
We‚Äôre still in an era of quantitative 
easing, and you might be surprised 
how willing Ô¨Ånancial institutions 
are to lend to anybody with a track 
record of having a regular income 
and good credit score.
Another source of potential 
cash¬†might be crowdfunding. 
Lisa¬†Maltby, a Sheffield-based 
illustrator proÔ¨Åled on page 61, 
used¬†Kickstarter to Ô¨Ånance her 
‚Äòdisgustingly distinguished recipe 
book‚Äô for children, The Glorious 
Book of Curious Cocktails. She 
managed to raise ¬£5,600, although 
creatives commonly ask for, and 
often get, larger sums. Be warned, 
though: even free money doesn‚Äôt 
come for free, and you‚Äôll probably 
have to do a lot of hustling in order 
to meet your target. 
‚ÄúRunning a Kickstarter was like 
having another child; it was quite 
a¬†challenge,‚Äù recalls Maltby. ‚ÄúI have 
a wide network of people I‚Äôm 
connected with, so I was able to 
push for a few things, pull a few 
strings. But even then it was really 
tricky to get articles about the 
campaign published, to get people 
to share it on social media. You are 
your own campaign, so you‚Äôve got 
to fully drive it all the time. I got 
the funding, which is amazing, but 
this sort of campaign is not to be 
taken lightly. It‚Äôs really hard work.‚Äù
CHALLENGE FIVE: 
BUILD A STRONG NETWORK
Even if you consider yourself a 
self-starter, the success of your 
creative dream often lies in the 
hands of other people. So having 
a¬†strong network of contacts will 
help enormously, whether you‚Äôre 
seeking work as a new freelancer, 
looking for the right partner for a 
collaboration, or¬†searching for a 
mentor as you develop your skills 
in¬†a new creative Ô¨Åeld.
Building up a decent list of 
contacts you can rely on doesn‚Äôt 
just happen by accident, though. 
Getting out there and introducing 
yourself to people, both on social 
media and in the real world, 
Rose Waterson may have been a 
talented illustrator, but she wasn‚Äôt 
really aware of it. The Ô¨Åne art graduate 
and freelancer lacked conÔ¨Ådence in 
her work, and didn‚Äôt expect to attract 
clients outside of her hometown of 
Brighton. So it was something of a 
surprise when she got a call from Nike. 
It all stemmed from a logo and 
poster she had designed for a group in 
Brighton called Girls Can‚Äôt DJ. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd 
posted it on their Instagram account. 
And then later on, they‚Äôd done an 
interview with Nike about women in 
the music business,‚Äù she says.
When Nike saw Waterson‚Äôs work 
on the group‚Äôs Instagram, it was a case 
of good timing; the brand had just 
decided to collaborate with seven 
female artists to promote their new 
workout pants line, Nike Pant Studio. 
So the company got in touch and 
commissioned her for the campaign. 
‚ÄúIt was about three days before the 
deadline,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey contacted 
me on a Monday and wanted my 
illustration on a Thursday. It was very 
last minute but I managed to do it 
somehow. The campaign came out 
about a month and a half later; the 
whole thing was quite swift.‚Äù 
Working for Nike has raised 
Waterson‚Äôs proÔ¨Åle and been a big boost 
to her self-conÔ¨Ådence, she says; plus 
it‚Äôs taught her two main lessons. 
‚ÄúFirstly, the importance of Instagram. 
I‚Äôve always used it, but I‚Äôve realised the 
power it has now, and the difference 
it can make if you invest in it. And 
secondly, you never know who your 
contacts are going to be. I had no idea 
that this DJ group had any connection 
to Nike, which is a bit mental if you 
think about it.‚Äù

at¬†things like creative events 
and¬†meetups, is¬†essential. 
Kate Moorhouse, a graphic 
designer from Manchester, very 
quickly learned the importance 
of¬†networking when she went 
freelance. ‚ÄúI heard about a meetup 
group based in Sheffield and 
Manchester called Freelance Folk 
and popped down to see what it 
was all about,‚Äù she explains. 
‚ÄúI¬†immediately got a friendly 
response from everyone. It felt like 
we were all in the same boat: 
Ô¨Ånding our way, making the same 
mistakes. And it was nice to chat to 
like-minded people from diÔ¨Äerent 
industries. Everyone had diÔ¨Äerent 
disciplines, but the freelance side 
was common to us all.‚Äù 
It wasn‚Äôt just a psychological 
boost: the group helped her Ô¨Ånd 
work, too, she adds. ‚ÄúI met the 
founder, Katy Carlisle, at one of her 
Squarespace workshops and she 
asked me to redesign the logo for 
the group. In return, she helped me 
with some Squarespace support. 
Since then, whenever I go to the 
group, I meet someone new who 
I¬†can either work for or work with. 
I‚Äôve also collaborated with other 
freelancers from there, and I¬†feel 
it‚Äôs¬†a really natural way for us to 
work together.‚Äù
CHALLENGE SIX: 
FIND COLLABORATORS
If your creative dream for 2018 
involves collaboration, then its 
success will live and die on whether 
you choose the right partner. 
Tennessee illustrator Tammy 
Coron, who recently teamed up 
with Apple game developer Chris 
Language to create game design 
resource www.dayoftheindie.com, 
oÔ¨Äers some pointers. 
‚ÄúFinding someone you trust and 
being honest with each other are 
vital,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons 
Chris and I work so well together is 
because we speak our minds: we‚Äôre 
honest and open with each other. 
‚ÄúWe also share responsibilities 
and understand situations where 
one of us needs more time to focus 
on something else, without guilt 
from the other. And the best thing 
about our partnership is that we 
encourage and push each other to 
reach just past our abilities, in order 
to level-up our skills.‚Äù
CHALLENGE SEVEN: 
PROMOTE YOURSELF
Whether it‚Äôs launching a passion 
project or your services as a 
Dutch designer Frank Suyker originally 
set out to be a business leader, but got 
interested in design and video production, 
and ended up ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù becoming an 
art director. Currently working for Orange 
Pearl in the Netherlands, he offers some 
advice for developing your creative career.
EXPECT CURVEBALLS
For those who know their end game, great! 
For those who don‚Äôt know (and that‚Äôs a 
lot of us), just go with the Ô¨Çow and let life 
surprise you with a curveball. You never 
know where you might end up.
DIVE DEEP
If you‚Äôre really interested in a topic, don‚Äôt 
hold yourself back from diving deeper. 
Learn everything you can Ô¨Ånd about it. 
And then... forget it (I learned that one 
from the master, James Victore). Only then 
will you have the opportunity to create 
something that comes from the heart.
LEARN FROM OTHERS
There is so much information online. 
On every subject you want to learn more 
about, there is a website, a video, a 
forum. When you hit a wall, there‚Äôs always 
someone who‚Äôs hit that wall before you 
did, and then shared their experience.
SKILLS AREN‚ÄôT EVERYTHING
You can apply for jobs even if you don‚Äôt 
have all the knowledge. You can learn on 
the job too. A good Ô¨Åt with the culture of 
the company and the strive to go all out is 
much more valuable to employers. 
KEEP LEARNING
When you stop learning, you get overtaken 
by those who are more eager. Never give 
up. Keep going. Be the best you can be.

In September 2016, Ariana 
DeLuca, an art director based 
in New York, was looking for a 
photographer. ‚ÄúI wanted to reach 
out to someone new, so I put the 
word out,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúBut I was 
getting a lot of responses from 
men that didn‚Äôt sit right. I didn‚Äôt 
feel comfortable with anyone 
who responded. And I thought to 
myself: I‚Äôd really love to work 
with another female creative, 
who has similar goals and 
ambitions to me. But nothing 
like that existed.‚Äù
DeLuca couldn‚Äôt think of an 
easy way to Ô¨Ånd new female 
creatives she didn‚Äôt already 
know, who were also eager to 
create and connect. ‚ÄúThen I 
thought: this should exist, why 
don‚Äôt I just make it?‚Äù 
So that‚Äôs exactly what she 
did. She got in contact with 
photographer and conceptual 
artist Heather Leigh Cullum 
‚Äì who she knew through a 
mutual friend ‚Äì and in February 
2017, they launched a new group 
for women called The Passionate 
Project. Its mission is to help 
‚Äòfemale creatives who want to 
collaborate on projects, 
strengthen their portfolios, 
and network.‚Äô
DeLuca has done all of this 
outside her full-time agency job, 
but despite the hard work and 
long hours, she‚Äôs loved every 
minute. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs great to take 
a risk and to open up new doors 
and meet people, and just help 
each other out,‚Äù she smiles. 
People marvel at her energy 
and constantly ask her ‚ÄòHow do 
you Ô¨Ånd the time?‚Äô, she says. But 
rather than basking in the glory, 
she urges others to follow her 
lead and pursue their own 
passion project. 
‚ÄúI just tell people: ‚ÄòYou can 
do the same thing,‚Äô‚Äù she says. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about working hard, 
Ô¨Ånding the thing you love and 
going forward. I try to be really 
encouraging and tell people to 
go for it. Push through those 
doubts and those fears, grind 
it out, and you‚Äôll get there.‚Äù

Shanti Sparrow was working as a 
designer in a little boutique studio 
in Sydney. She enjoyed her job and 
found much of the work fulÔ¨Ålling. 
But something was missing, she 
just didn‚Äôt know what. So she 
decide to take a year off travelling, 
in order to work out what it was.
She used her savings to rent a 
Ô¨Çat in New York and stayed for six 
months. ‚ÄúWhen I arrived, I didn‚Äôt 
want to get straight into work,‚Äù she 
recalls. ‚ÄúI was so exhausted I just 
wanted to absorb New York, have 
some fun and just sleep.‚Äù 
Eventually she started doing bits 
of freelancing for her old employer. 
‚ÄúIt worked out really well for their 
timeline,‚Äù she notes, ‚Äúbecause I 
could do it overnight, they could go 
to sleep and then when they woke 
up, it would be done.‚Äù
After half a year in the US, she 
then spent another six months 
going around Europe and Japan, 
visiting 17 countries in total.

freelancer, promoting yourself 
is¬†key. That means not just 
networking with other creatives, 
but sharing your work more widely, 
on platforms such as Instagram, 
Pinterest, Behance and Dribbble. 
This may sound obvious, but New 
York-based designer and lecturer 
Shanti Sparrow has seen the 
positive eÔ¨Äects Ô¨Årst-hand. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a designer for nine 
years, but my freelancing outside 
of¬†my main job has actually only 
kicked oÔ¨Ä in the last two,‚Äù explains 
Sparrow (see left). ‚ÄúIt was only 
when I started releasing my work 
onto social media channels that it 
happened. I was started to get 
contacted internationally, whereas 
before it tended to be people I knew 
through people I knew. But now it‚Äôs 
anybody who Googled a magazine 
and my thing came up, and they‚Äôre 
in China and want me to make 
them something.‚Äù
There‚Äôs a lot of noise online, 
of¬†course, and just posting stuÔ¨Ä 
doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôll get 
attention, so it pays to get creative. 
For example, Rotherham-based 
designer Amy Kilner (see page 62), 
launched an Instagram feed called 
@thedesignÔ¨Åx this year, and it‚Äôs 
become a roaring success. 
‚ÄúThe way you get followers on 
Instagram is by getting your work 
featured on other pages,‚Äù she 
explains. So she essentially took 
the same idea and reversed it. 
‚ÄúI¬†launched my own page to help 
other creatives, and it just blew up,‚Äù 
she explains. ‚ÄúThere are now 
around 40,000 posts on Instagram 
using the hashtag and I‚Äôve got more 
than 18,000 followers on it. I‚Äôve got 
these brand ambassadors 
promoting it, and it‚Äôs just growing. 
It‚Äôs still a work in progress but I‚Äôm 
doing something right.‚Äù
CHALLENGE EIGHT: 
ACCEPT IT‚ÄôS NOT LINEAR
As the saying goes, ‚ÄòMan plans, 
God laughs‚Äô. In other words: 
whatever scheme you have to boost 
your career and achieve your 
dreams in 2018 may very well go 
astray. But that‚Äôs not a reason to 
not bother trying at all, more a 
realisation that you‚Äôre going to have 
to stay nimble, accept challenges 
head on and hope to enjoy as much 
of the ride as possible. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this assumption that 
when you‚Äôre an adult you get 
everything locked down and 
sorted,‚Äù says Strange. ‚ÄúNo way! 
I¬†think these times are the most 
exciting; you‚Äôre more wise to the 
world and can make changes even 
more easily. It‚Äôs about being open 
and receptive to change, and eager 
to¬†identify when something isn‚Äôt 
working for you and then making 
a¬†change. It‚Äôs a never-ending 
process of analysis, assessment 
and¬†action!‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôd always been the mother hen of 
every studio I‚Äôd been at, and I loved 
the idea of being in graphic design, but 
without all the deadlines and clients‚Äù
S H A N T I S PA R R O W G R A P H I C D ES I G N ER , 
IL LU ST R ATO R A N D L EC T U R ER
‚ÄúAfter going to Barcelona and 
Tokyo, I‚Äôll never see colour in the 
same way again.‚Äù
On return to Australia, though, 
she still struggled for a time to 
work out why her career wasn‚Äôt 
sitting right. Then, Ô¨Ånally, it all 
fell into place, when she saw an 
ad for graphic design mentors at 
Shillington back in New York. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôd always been the mother 
hen of every studio I‚Äôd been at, 
I was always training juniors,‚Äù she 
explains. ‚ÄúAnd I loved the idea of 
still being in graphic design, but 
without the deadlines and clients.‚Äù
She‚Äôs now found the perfect 
work balance, combining a job as a 
lecturer for Shillington with design 
freelancing. And she thinks she‚Äôd 
never have got there without the 
perspective gained from travelling. 
‚ÄúI took that time in New York to 
focus on me,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúAnd 
after that, eventually, everything 
started to make sense.‚Äù

  JUNIOR DESIGNER MANUAL 
HOW TO FOLLOW 
BRAND GUIDELINES
In the last of our series aimed at junior designers, we examine 
how to interpret and follow clients‚Äô brand guidelines
WORDS: Tom May
¬†T
he idea of following brand guidelines 
is something that doesn‚Äôt get a lot of 
attention on most design courses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve 
never come across an intern or graduate 
who understands the fundamentals of 
brand guidelines,‚Äù says Ellie Pearson, senior 
designer and studio manager at Cambridge-
based agency Mobas. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not their fault: 
they weren‚Äôt told about it, and neither was I.‚Äù ¬†  
The concept itself, though, is quite simple. 
Clients provide designers with a detailed 
outline of their preferred colours, fonts, logos 
and so on, and how each are to be used. But 
what students are often taken aback by is the 
sheer range of things they cover. 
‚ÄúI was surprised at Ô¨Årst by the complexity 
and depth of brand guidelines,‚Äù recalls Jess 
Dutton, junior designer at Mobas. ‚ÄúFor some 
larger clients, they‚Äôre incredibly extensive. 
You¬†think of brands having one or two primary 
colours, but I didn‚Äôt know they could have 
secondary colours too.‚Äù Dutton was also 
surprised by the distinctions between internal 
and external colours for collateral that will be 
used for staÔ¨Ä and for customers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot more 
complex than meets the eye,‚Äù she says.
And this complexity means you need to 
spend a lot of time digesting them. ‚ÄúI always 
make sure I‚Äôve gone through the brand 
guidelines from start to Ô¨Ånish, and that I have 
a¬†clear understanding of the look and feel of 
the existing brand, before I start a project,‚Äù says 
Joe Bembridge, junior designer at MacclesÔ¨Åeld 
design consultancy Brandon. 
Tom Tennant, a¬†motion graphics designer 
at¬†Gramercy Park Studios in London, tells a 
similar tale. ‚ÄúI spend as much time as possible 
studying the guidelines, as it‚Äôs really helpful to 
be on the same page as your client,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúEven reading the parts that aren‚Äôt relevant to 
what you‚Äôre doing can give you more insight 
into the brand. After all, it‚Äôs there to help.‚Äù
STICKING TO THE RULES
Laura Wynn-Owen, junior designer at Nelson 
Bostock Group in London, notes that 
guidelines are usually handed over without 
being talked through, so they can be open to 
your own interpretation. ‚ÄúBut in our case, there 
are usually brand teams on hand to answer any 
questions,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere may also be brand 
sites that give access to assets, guidelines and 
best practice examples.‚Äù
As the word ‚Äòguidelines‚Äô suggests, these are 
not immutable rules. But pushing back on 
them should be a last resort, not a default, 
believes Andrius Petravicius, digital designer 
at¬†Hampshire design agency Superrb. ‚ÄúI usually 
wouldn‚Äôt push back on brand guidelines, as in 
most cases, you can still be creative and work 
around them,‚Äù he reasons. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done so on 
occasions, though, when I felt like the 
guidelines weren‚Äôt working well visually and 
I¬†knew they could be improved upon.‚Äù

HOW TO BEND THE RULES
JUNIOR DESIGNER AT BRANDON, JOE BEMBRIDGE, EXPLAINS HOW THE TEAM 
EXPERIMENTED WITH BRANDING GUIDELINES FOR VLERICK BUSINESS SCHOOL
In most cases 
you¬†can still 
be¬†creative and 
work around 
brand guidelines
EXECUTIVE EDUCATION
‚ÄúWithin this series of 
brochures promoting Vlerick 
Business School‚Äôs Executive 
Education programme, we 
had to both retain the 
V-pattern but also anchor 
the logotype within it. This 
pushed the boundaries of 
the original identity system 
as the logotype usually sits 
in one of the four corners 
of the page.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is a pocket-sized prospectus 
for potential students at career 
fairs. One of the school‚Äôs brand 
drivers is vitality and the use of the 
vibrant coloured V-patterns helped 
us stand out again the competition 
as being something different. The 
logotype is anchored alongside one 
of the V-patterns within one of the 
four corner points. In terms of the 
inside spread, we also locked the 
logotype up in one of the four 
corner points, and used the 
transparency of the V-pattern to 
bleed over the photographic image. 
All told, it‚Äôs a very complex 
V-pattern and one that we review 
each year with the school‚Äôs internal 
marketing team and all external 
brand partners to ensure there‚Äôs as 
much quality control as possible. 
We use a trafÔ¨Åc light review 
system to highlight what we ask 
people to avoid doing (red), what 
might be ambiguous and slightly 
breaks a rule (amber; the Executive 
Education piece is one such 
example) and what are great 
examples of brand use for the 
school (green). This really helps 
everyone to understand how to 
best use the identity across Ô¨Çat 
graphics, moving image and event 
experiences. We even used the 
guidelines when we branded a 
Xerox photocopier for the school!‚Äù

HOW TO ADAPT TO GUIDANCE
RORY BERRY, JUNIOR DESIGNER AT SUPERRB, OUTLINES HOW VERY 
DIFFERENT GUIDELINES INFLUENCED THREE CLIENT PROJECTS
AMY‚ÄôS KITCHEN
‚ÄúThe marketing team at 
Amy‚Äôs Kitchen were very 
clear about the story they 
wanted tell through the 
website, but the business 
had evolved tremendously 
since the original branding 
was done, so their old 
guidelines weren‚Äôt up to 
date. Other than the logo, we 
had pretty much free reign 
on the look and feel, but had 
to keep it true to the ethos 
of the brand. As we were 
nearing the launch, the team 
rolled this new style out 
across their other channels, 
so things were tight.‚Äù
AWESOME INC
‚ÄúIn terms of guidance, Awesome 
Inc provided us with a logo and 
a colourway, which we had to 
stick to. As part of the brief they 
also expressed a desire for the 
site to have a fun, animated feel 
to reÔ¨Çect their unique style and 
ethos. From there, it was down 
to interpretation. The nature of 
their work is very eclectic so we 
decided to go for a fairly clean 
wrapper to make the most of 
their portfolio. Given that 
they‚Äôre an animation studio, 
it was also important to make 
sure the animations on the 
website were really slick, but 
at times, we had to rein it in 
and remember that showcasing 
the work was the priority.‚Äù

document, but we did try to push it a bit, 
and¬†bring in some extra tints and colours, plus 
we created a kind of illustrative classic style 
that they‚Äôd not really used before. It Ô¨Åtted in 
with their branding but it moved it on a little 
bit, and¬†they were happy with it. If you can do 
that, that‚Äôs ideal, although it does obviously 
depend on the client and the brief.‚Äù
USING SYSTEMS
Normally, though, your job is simply to 
understand and internalise the brand 
guidelines, as well as work within a reliable 
system to ensure they‚Äôre adhered to. Such 
systems will vary from studio to studio, but 
will¬†normally be largely based on common 
sense. ‚ÄúAt Moras, we have a huge printed folder 
with details of all brand guidelines that we 
work on in the studio, which is also accessible 
on our server,‚Äù explains Dutton. ‚ÄúI go through 
and manually double-check colours, as well 
as¬†doing an InDesign check that shows all 
the¬†typefaces used, so you can easily weed 
out¬†any that shouldn‚Äôt be there. Plus, we 
have¬†an internal artworker in the team who 
checks everything against guidelines and 
specs¬†before it‚Äôs sent back to the client.‚Äù
Adherence to brand guidelines may also be 
integrated into the software itself. ‚ÄúAt Superrb 
we use Sketch, which allows us to set up 
reusable colour palettes and typography styles,‚Äù 
says Petravicius. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve also been using InVision‚Äôs 
Craft plugin for Sketch quite a lot lately; this 
lets you create branding libraries with all brand 
assets, styles and symbols. I‚Äôm also really 
excited about a new tool from InVision called 
Design System Manager, which seems like 
a¬†powerful system for creating, managing and 
scaling design libraries.‚Äù
The most important thing, adds Pearson, is 
that if there‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt understand 
‚Äì and there probably will be ‚Äì ask. ‚ÄúBrand 
guidelines can be incredibly technical,‚Äù she 
says. ‚ÄúOne of our animal health clients has 
a¬†lock up at the bottom of all designs that 
requires a mathematical formula to work out 
the right height and width for the exact 
document you‚Äôre working on. A junior or intern 
has little hope of understanding that, so they 
should always seek help if they‚Äôre unsure.‚Äù 
FIVE TIPS FOR 
BRAND CONSISTENCY
DESIGNERS SHARE FIVE TIPS ON 
FOLLOWING BRAND GUIDELINES
1¬†
DO YOUR RESEARCH
‚ÄúSome big brands make their guidelines 
available on issuu.com,‚Äù says Jess Dutton, 
junior designer at Mobas. ‚ÄúLook for a brand 
you know and like, and read their style sheet. 
You‚Äôll change your perspective, gain an 
understanding of the design process, and 
realise what goes into creating something.‚Äù
2¬†
STAY CREATIVE
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let brand guidelines hold you 
back on your creativity,‚Äù says Joe Bembridge, 
junior designer at Brandon. ‚ÄúThese guides 
are put in place not to limit creativity, but 
to help a brand stay recognisable and 
consistent,‚Äù he points out. ‚ÄúBut if you do 
go against the guidelines, make sure you 
have a valid reason for doing so.‚Äù
3¬†
MAKE SUGGESTIONS
‚ÄúIf you feel something could be 
improved, suggest that to the client, or even 
make a concept variation to show how a 
brand could look with your improvements,‚Äù 
says Andrius Petravicius, digital designer at 
Superrb. ‚ÄúYet if the client insists you follow 
their guidelines, don‚Äôt ignore them.‚Äù 
4¬†
HARNESS SOFTWARE 
‚ÄúTo make sure I follow the guidelines 
carefully, I‚Äôll take a screengrab of the most 
important parts: the colour references, font, 
and point sizes,‚Äù says Tom Tennant, motion 
graphics designer at Gramercy Park Studios. 
‚ÄúI also Ô¨Ånd it helps to copy the brand colours 
into whichever software you‚Äôre using so you 
have a palette that‚Äôs easily accessible.‚Äù   
5¬†
ASK QUESTIONS
‚ÄúRaise any questions you have as soon 
as possible, rather than when you‚Äôre midway 
through the work,‚Äù advises Laura Wynn-
Owen, junior designer at Nelson Bostock 
Group. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôre unsure 
about, ask. Even senior designers need 
guidance. There are no stupid questions 
when it comes to brand guidelines.‚Äù
Brand guidelines 
can be incredibly 
technical, always 
seek help if 
you‚Äôre unsure
MEGAMUNDEN
‚ÄúIn terms of developing brand 
guidelines, this project was very 
collaborative. MegaMunden is 
an illustrator, so when he was 
working up logo comps, he 
shared some options early 
on so we could decide which 
would work best for web. It 
was important that the site 
incorporated his signature 
style, therefore we got him to 
illustrate a lot of the incidental 
elements, such as background 
icons, arrows and footer lock 
up. By kicking the brand back 
and forth, we arrived at 
something which felt natural 
to him and that we knew would 
work seamlessly across a wide 
range of media.‚Äù

BUILD A SUCCESSFUL 
STUDIO FROM SCRATCH
Despite initially having no clients, cash or business 
experience, the co-founders of Fiasco have built an award- 
winning studio at the heart of Bristol‚Äôs creative scene
VIDEO INSIGHT
 S 
even years ago, Ben Steers and 
Jason Smith set up Fiasco in Bristol 
with no design agency experience, 
or much design experience at all to 
speak of, during one of the biggest 
global recessions in living memory ‚Äì a move 
that peers at the time described as ‚Äúmental‚Äù. 
After three short years, they won a BAFTA. 
Two years later, a D&AD Pencil. Now, through 
sister company thread, they‚Äôre also running a 
successful series of design events to bring the 
South West‚Äôs creative community together. 
Here, Steers and Smith reveal how they did it...
How did get you Fiasco off the ground?
Jason Smith: I was chefÔ¨Ång at one point, taking 
calls in the kitchen to arrange meetings. I was 
working, like, Ô¨Åve jobs. But we had so much 
energy, and loved it. We kept persisting, doing 
collaborative work ‚Äì for free ‚Äì that helped us 
grow a circle of friends in Bristol and the South 
West and produce a portfolio, and without it, 
things would have been a hell of a lot harder.
Ben Steers: We really did start from scratch. 
Other co-founders think we‚Äôre mental. They‚Äôve 
come from another agency, or have a design 
background, so have a portfolio of clients or 
a certain level of experience.
Neither of us had had a full-time job at a 
design agency. No business experience. We 
didn‚Äôt know how to run an agency, or what the 
dynamics, or structure, of a typical agency was. 
But because we were so young and na√Øve, there 
were no restrictions. I guess that was a strength; 
we went into everything with open arms.
We said ‚Äòyes‚Äô to everything, and worried about 
the rest later. Then slowly started to reÔ¨Åne who 
we were as a company, and the type of work we 
wanted to be doing, as well as how we work with 
our clients. That‚Äôs taken a long time to do. 
JS: When we started, it was just us running 
accounts, marketing, business development 
and then actually doing the work. Because we 
 
were forced to wear so many hats, we had to 
learn very quickly on the job.
BS: We were in an incubator space to begin 
with, surrounded by other start-ups. Naturally, 
start-ups need branding, as well as all the 
standard business collateral stuff. 
For us, it was perfect ‚Äì we were getting 
nurtured as a business through this incubator 
[run by the University of the West of England ‚Äì 
UWE ‚Äì with a 50 per cent subsidy on rent], but 
also had the opportunity to work with other small 
businesses that needed design services, but 
didn‚Äôt have huge budgets. It was an important 
platform for us. Those people put a lot of trust 
and faith in us, not having any experience or 
much of a portfolio to fall back on. 
What was your breakthrough project?
BS: There‚Äôs been a few at different stages. 
The Ô¨Årst was with a production company called 
Somethin‚Äô Else: an online game for Channel 
4, which came off the back of some freelance 
illustration work I‚Äôd been doing. 
We were commissioned to create a whole 
set of characters, furniture and environments. 
At the time, Channel 4 knocking on our door 
was a massive deal. It was a landmark moment, 
and the game won a Children‚Äôs BAFTA a year 
later. For a company of our size, going into 
our third year of business, it was pretty big.  
JS: It also made us aware of the importance 
of social media. Our Ô¨Årst conversations with 
Somethin‚Äô Else happened through Twitter. 
BS: In the early days it‚Äôs really important to 
get yourself out there. You don‚Äôt know whose 
phone is going to get that notiÔ¨Åcation or pick 
up on that tweet. We also started working 
with Penguin Random House off the back of a 
tweet: someone within Penguin was looking for 
a design/dev team to help with some sites for 
some of their authors. We saw that, got in touch, 
and heard nothing for months. Then one day 
we got an email asking us to create an website

JASON SMITH 
AND BEN STEERS
Co-founders
Senior designer Jason 
(pictured) and creative 
director Ben met at Deviate 
magazine in Bristol. Jason 
fell in love with the city after 
moving there in 2004, while 
Ben arrived later, having 
studied in Plymouth and 
worked in London.
HOW TO LEARN ON THE FLY
In our Ô¨Årst video, co-founders Ben Steers and 
Jason Smith (pictured) share how they grew 
Fiasco from two inexperienced guys with a 
couple of laptops into an award-winning studio.

Left: Fiasco‚Äôs website for

won several awards ‚Äì 
including a D&AD Pencil.
Below: The site was 
carefully optimised 
across all devices, to 
minimise distractions 
for readers.
for a series called Gods and Warriors. Not a 
huge job, but again, an ‚Äòin‚Äô with a really reputable 
brand. Off the back of that, we did the design and 
build for The Snowman and the Snowdog site, 
which led to the Pelican website. 
It was a long, at points arduous, stressful job, 
but we ended up with a beautiful product that 
won a series of awards, including a D&AD pencil. 
JS: We‚Äôd just had our Ô¨Åfth birthday. It was great 
going to the awards ceremony; it drummed home 
that every winner is just a fantastic original idea.
What is it about Bristol that excites you both? 
BS: There‚Äôs something quite tangible about the 
atmosphere here; something in the air that‚Äôs 
quite special. It comes from the industrial history 
that the city has. There‚Äôs this DIY ethic, people 
just go out there and make it for themselves.
JS: Summer is like being on holiday every 
day: countless festivals, arts and culture. 
Plus we‚Äôve seen a lot of young companies 
like ourselves grow up in Bristol with us. There‚Äôs 
deÔ¨Ånitely a sense of community and friendship. 
BS: A few years ago, we set up a series of events 
called thread to champion the local creative 
community, bringing people together for talks 
and workshops in an informal, comfortable way. 
We started in a small bar with about 100 people, 
and now do 220-230 people quarterly. We‚Äôve 
set up a separate sister company to run it. And 
last October we put on a design festival called 
Something Good, with an amazing response.
Where do you recruit talent from?
JS: Our last two recruits are from Manchester 
and London. There seems to be a real movement 
at the moment ‚Äì due to rising house prices, or 
desire for better quality of life ‚Äì for people to 
move out of London. Many are coming to Bristol.
We also have open lines of communication 
with the local unis. Our studio manager Marj is 
a UWE graduate, and came on board last March.
According to your website, you only work with 
brands you respect. How do you gauge that? 
BS: For us, it‚Äôs more about respecting the people 
within the brand. By no means do we always get 
it right. It‚Äôs like interviewing for a job. You don‚Äôt 
really know that person until you‚Äôre three, six, 
12 months into the job. You have to try and do 
due diligence early on, then give it a go.
JS: Respect and trust are closely intertwined. 
We don‚Äôt work for people, we work with them. 
And to collaborate, we need to trust each other. 
BS: It‚Äôs like a marriage. If trust isn‚Äôt there, things 
start to rock. We bring clients on board from the 
beginning ‚Äì we don‚Äôt just go away, and come 
back with a big ‚Äòta-da!‚Äô moment. We constantly 
update them, which helps build that trust.

TOM GRANT
Creative
Tom works on a broad 
range¬†of creative projects, 
from branding to web 
design¬†to animation. After 
graduating from Liverpool 
John Moores, he worked 
at¬†various Manchester 
agencies before moving 
to¬†Bristol two¬†years ago.
KEEP YOUR SKILLS FRESH
In our second video, creative Tom Grant reveals 
how the eight-person studio handles such a range 
of multi-disciplinary projects ‚Äì and how Fiasco 
encourages the whole team to stay sharp.
WATCH THE VIDEO NOW AT  
www.bit.ly/ca275-Ô¨Åasco
Above and right: For 
its brand overhaul of 
Bristol cultural hub 
The Tobacco Factory, 
Fiasco was inspired by 
the building‚Äôs original 
industrial roots.
1. Create an outlet 
A weekly email with an area named ‚ÄòJust for 
fun‚Äô gives the Fiasco team an excuse to 
experiment and learn new skills, says 
creative Tom Grant. ‚ÄúIt just gives us a 
small window to go away and learn to do 
something different,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt makes you 
feel like you‚Äôre developing and progressing.‚Äù
2. Aim high 
Although Fiasco collaborates with others 
when client work requires skills outside 
the in-house remit, Grant stresses that it‚Äôs 
good to push existing team members. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 
always nice to try and get there yourself,‚Äù he 
says. ‚ÄúCreating work that‚Äôs a little outside 
your comfort zone is the way you improve 
and avoid stagnation.‚Äù
3. Get stuck in
Grant has been experimenting with 
animation for the newsletter, and has been 
getting tips from his colleague, who‚Äôs ‚Äúa 
bit of a whizz in After Effects.‚Äù However, he 
says, often the best way to get your head 
around a programme is just to get stuck in. 
‚ÄúHave a play and make a few mistakes and 
Ô¨Ågure out how everything works.‚Äù
4. Foster a family culture
‚ÄúWe do weekends away and go out 
for dinner and lunch, everyone gets 
along,‚Äù says Grant. ‚ÄúI think it deÔ¨Ånitely 
helps just having people that have got 
your back and are willing to push you.‚Äù 
This sense of unity encourages the team to 
create. ‚ÄúWhen you see someone else doing 
a piece of work that you think, ‚ÄòWow, that‚Äôs 
amazing,‚Äô you want to do be doing that. It 
keeps you striving to do better.‚Äù
5. Set aside time
Recognising that experimentation and 
learning takes time, Fiasco sets aside 
time each week to experiment with new 
programmes. That knowledge can then 
be applied to future projects. ‚ÄúIt breaks up 
what we are doing and gives us another 
element to our skill set,‚Äù explains Grant.
Nurturing a talented creative 
‚Äòfamily‚Äô takes time, says Tom 
Grant, creative at Fiasco

NATASHA FIELD 
Account manager
While studying English at 
UWE, Natasha discovered 
a¬†passion for design and 
switched her degree. She 
found a route in via account 
management at a London-
based digital agency, then 
a¬†larger ad agency, before 
moving back to Bristol.
MIX BUSINESS AND PLEASURE
In our third video, account manager Natasha 
Field reveals why a small, friendly studio suits 
her more than a large agency ‚Äì and how Fiasco‚Äôs 
‚Äòfamily‚Äô vibe translates to client relationships.
WATCH THE VIDEO NOW AT  
www.bit.ly/ca275-Ô¨Åasco
1. Build trust
‚ÄúI treat every client relationship like 
I would a friendship in terms of good 
communication and trust,‚Äù says Natasha 
Field, account manager at Fiasco. ‚ÄúWhen 
clients trust us and we trust them, it helps 
move the project along.‚Äù Plus if something 
does go wrong, it‚Äôll be easier to resolve.
2. Act human 
In the past, Field sometimes felt she 
wasn‚Äôt being herself when talking to 
clients. ‚ÄúThe way I spoke to them wasn‚Äôt 
very human and seemed robotic, and 
I wasn‚Äôt building relationships because 
that‚Äôs not how you build relationships.‚Äù She 
advises remembering that everyone has 
good days and bad days: ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre having 
a bad day, you can just be there to talk.‚Äù
3. Don‚Äôt burn bridges
Fiasco was recently re-hired for a client 
they‚Äôd worked for Ô¨Åve years previously, 
suggesting that sometimes you might 
have to wait to bear the fruits of your 
good relationships. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know when 
a project comes in whether or not that‚Äôs 
going to lead to more work,‚Äù she says. The 
lesson? Every client is worth investing in. 
4. Be Ô¨Çexible
‚ÄúEach client is different in the way they 
work, so some need a bit more explanation, 
whereas some just let us run with it and 
won‚Äôt need so many face-to-face meetings,‚Äù 
says Field. ‚ÄúYou have to Ô¨Çexible in how that 
client wants or needs to work.‚Äù 
5. Immerse yourself
A good account manager should be an 
extension of the client, and be able to 
pre-empt their feedback, adds Field. ‚ÄúThe 
only way to do this is immerse yourself so 
that you understand them ‚Äì who they, what 
they do and their core values.‚Äù
Account manager Natasha 
Field¬†reveals how to nurture 
your¬†client relationships

In our fourth video, recent UWE Bristol illustration

Bristol‚Äôs Ô¨Årst major

Something Good, 
which was reviewed 
in CA issue 273.
1. Don‚Äôt underestimate self-promotion
The year before Marj Newnham applied for 
an internship at Fiasco, she sent the studio 
a pop-up rocket Christmas card. She didn‚Äôt 
hear anything back, but when she went for 
an interview she was pleased to be able to 
point out her card, still stuck on the wall. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always good to send out some feelers, 
because you never know when it‚Äôll come 
back around to help you,‚Äù she says.
2. Make yourself indispensable 
Marj left her previous job in the hope that 
her internship would lead onto full-time 
employment. It was a bit of a leap of faith 
she says, but she tried hard to impress 
throughout the internship ‚Äúso they couldn‚Äôt 
let me go,‚Äù and her efforts paid off.
3. Find transferable skills
As well as managing the studio, Marj 
is also heavily involved in organising 
Fiasco‚Äôs regular series of speaker-led 
events ‚Äì thread ‚Äì as well as its annual 
design festival, Something Good, which 
launched in October 2017. 
‚ÄúAt uni, I organised the degree shows 
and Ô¨Ånal exhibition, so I could draw on 
that for experience,‚Äù she explains. 
As long as you‚Äôve got a strong idea 
of what you‚Äôre trying to achieve, she adds, 
it‚Äôs surprising how many of your skills 
will be transferable.

GENUINE GEM
Marian Bantjes 
In 2014, I was contacted to design the cover 
for an annual event in Switzerland called 
BaselWorld, which attracts jewellers and 
high-end watchmakers.
I started with some drawings of patterns 
based on jewels, and then worked them up 
into colour options. They liked these, but 
asked that more watch parts, or reference 
to watches, be used.
One of my favourites used refracting 
gems as a watch face. I later repurposed 
this for a carpet design, without the watch. 
For some reason these were not working 
for them, so I tried again. The intention for 
this was to use foil on a matte background.
Ultimately, none of these were used, 
and they printed a plain black cover with 
a gold band across it. Go Ô¨Ågure.
02 Another of Bantjes‚Äô 
jewellery-inspired 
geometric patterns.
03-04 Bantjes started 
experimenting with 
colour in the patterns.
05-06 As the idea 
developed, more 
explicit references 
to watch components 
were added alongside 
the gemstones, and 
she tried different 
colour combinations.

UNCANNY VALLEY
David Fern√°ndez Huerta 
These early sketches for Monument Valley 2  
(www.monumentvalleygame.com) show my 
experiments with giving the game a landscape 
instead of a portrait orientation, as well as adding 
more detail to the architecture than was seen in 
the original game. 
I also played around with the idea of zooming 
in on levels, as opposed to the ‚Äòworld on a single 
screen‚Äô framing that we used in the Ô¨Årst Monument 
Valley. Other sketches include further exploration 
of  non-player characters, as I tried to create the 
feeling of being in a bustling village or town.
My sketchbook for this project is Ô¨Ålled with 
lots of experiments with different character 
designs and styles, including the ‚Äòadult and child‚Äô 
relationship that would later develop into the core 
theme for the entire game.

REBRAND SWIFTLY CANNED
As Michael Johnson recalls, his studio‚Äôs logo for the world‚Äôs biggest 
type foundry was rolled¬†out, but then promptly rolled back in again
In the very early nineties (1993 I think?), we were asked to design the 
logo for Monotype ‚Äì cue great excitement ‚Äì and it was adopted, only 
to be replaced literally within months because of a complete change 
of ownership. At the time, it seemed like the roof had fallen in.
STILL A SORE POINT

Michael set up multi-

MODERN ART
Michael Johnson 
If my Ô¨Åle dates are correct, we originally proposed 
this idea back in 2003, to an ad agency who had asked 
us for help with an approach to Tate Britain. 
The idea was: ‚ÄòWhere British art comes to life‚Äô. 
We imagined a family returning from a visit, and 
recreating Singer Sargents, drowning Ophelias 
and Richard Longs in their back garden using 
everyday objects, such as toys.
Personally, I always really loved this idea ‚Äì but 
I suspect it was never even shown to the client.

  VISUALISE A CLASSIC SONG 
DATA IS EVERYWHERE
Valentina D‚ÄôEÔ¨Ålippo
Interest in how we conceptualise, understand 
and visualise information has fuelled my 
practice. I use data as a raw material from 
which I Ô¨Ånd my perspective and express what 
resonates with me, while hoping that others 
will Ô¨Ånd it compelling, too.
My personal interest in data visualisation 
took off more than 10 years ago, when working 
on my thesis for a postgraduate degree in 
visual communication. By exploring bias in 
gender cues that children receive through 
visual stereotypes, I started to collect and 
visualise data. Since then, I have continued to 
explore the world through data by collecting, 
deconstructing and mapping information. 
Data can be found all around us, in where 
we go, what we consume, touch, read, watch or 
hear. My latest self-initiated project explores 
the application of dataviz techniques to music 
‚Äì giving form to what we hear, imagine and feel 
while listening to a song. OddityViz is also a 
tribute to an extraordinary artist, David Bowie. 
DECONSTRUCT THE SONG
David Bowie left us with a constellation of 
intersecting worlds, loaded with material for 
celebration, consideration and interpretation. 
From the start of the project, it quickly

became apparent that it was necessary 
to limit the scope and focus to one song.
What would Space Oddity look like turned 
into images or through data visualisation? This is 
what I and data researcher Miriam Quick set out 
to explore in OddityViz. We extracted musical 
data from the track and visualised it in a set of 
10 engraved records, paired with large-scale 
prints and projections that draw from the song‚Äôs 
fragmented interstellar world.
Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the song 
differently ‚Äì by instrumentation, rhythm, 
melody, harmony, lyrics, structure or the 
underlying story. Rather than abstract 
soundscapes, the records become a visual 
system to understand how Bowie masterfully 
crafted Major Tom‚Äôs journey. 
TURN AUDIO INTO VISUAL
Our intention was not to create an alternative 
visual score but to make the experience of 
listening to a song more ‚Äòvisible‚Äô. By breaking 
down its core components and piecing them 
back together, we can end up with a deeper 
understanding of our initial experience. 
We can think of traditional music notation as 
a kind of visualisation: pitch height corresponds 
to vertical height on the stave and the type 
of note describes the tempo. This system 
was created for musicians to perform. As you 
learn how to read it, the language becomes 
meaningful and legible. In a similar way, our 
visual encoding needed clear annotation, 
a key and writing to surface the insights. 
FIND THE RIGHT FORMAT
The range of outcomes ‚Äì computational 
animations, large-scale posters, engraved 
discs and a window installation ‚Äì allowed us 
to experiment with how to best encode the 
narrative. It took months of exploration and 
many hours of listening to the song on repeat 
and sketching out ideas. A turning point that 
deÔ¨Åned most of the visual language was 
deciding to experiment with a new medium, 
creating sculptural data-objects. 
The vinyl record was an obvious reference. 
From Edison‚Äôs phonograph to today‚Äôs vinyl 
records, music has been encoded through a 
series of grooves that spiral to the centre of the 
circular disc. Applying a similar logic, I wanted 
the musical data to be engraved. This decision 
forced me to work with no colour, using white on 
black, which also recalls the light of the stars in 
the darkness of space. The format also deÔ¨Åned 
the system to encode the data ‚Äì time around the 
circumference becomes a universal axis that 
allows comparison across visualisations. 
Given the constraints of laser cutting and 
etching on records, a minimal, bold design was 
imperative. Simple geometry and shapes were 
used to encode sounds ‚Äì evoking the nature 
of each individual instrument ‚Äì and narrative 
patterns. Ground Control was represented 
by a square ‚Äì a familiar, safe, angular shape 
that represents a point of stability on Earth ‚Äì 
while Major Tom was a circle, a more human 
character, who becomes one with the cosmos.
This visual investigation was then brought 
to life with animation, in a freer attempt to 
‚ÄúSimple shapes 
were used to 
encode sounds 
and narrative 
patterns‚Äù

link various aspects of the deconstruction 
to the actual music. Collaborating with Mike 
Brondbjerg, a talented generative artist, we 
created a moving image including a generative 
portrait of Bowie and a series of sequences, 
which Mike coded in processing, and others 
that I animated in After Effects.
MAKE THE VISION HAPPEN
When approaching a new project, I Ô¨Ånd it 
helpful to set out a strong creative direction to 
guide me through the design process and limit 
the decisions I will have to make later on. On 
the other hand, not knowing where I am going 
excites me and I like to allow the subject to 
inform the creative process. 
Moods and inspiration for this project 
included a variety of visual references from 
popular culture to experimental music notation 
resources and the Voyager Golden Records. 
Space Oddity comes with a wealth of visual 
inspiration to draw on from this very interesting 
period in popular culture. 
One of the discs, Trip, references Kubrick‚Äôs 
2001 Space Odyssey which was one of the main 
inspirations for this song. This record stands out 
from the rest due to its use of a distinct visual 
language ‚Äì emoji. Rather than being driven by 
data, it utilises illustration and images that 
loosely code for text and incorporates visual 
metaphors from the movie.
Thanks to the support of Wieden+Kennedy, 
we were able to exhibit the project in London 
to mark the Ô¨Årst anniversary of Bowie‚Äôs death. 
Since then, it has been on the road, with mini 
installations and talks across the world from 
London to Milan, to Minneapolis. The project 
also won an Information is Beautiful Award.

any of our members are 
represented by agencies, 
but we also have many that 
aren‚Äôt, as well as agent members, 
who abide by our ethical code 
of conduct, and work hard to 
secure a richer industry through 
a great plethora of talent.¬†
Many illustrators ask us: is 
it essential to have an agent in 
order to be successful?¬†To answer 
this question, we sought the 
insight of two AOI members who 
are currently thriving in their 
careers, with and without agents.
Shotopop (represented 
by¬†Bernstein & Andriulli, Val√©rie 
Oualid and Jacky Winter) tells us 
how working with an agent is all 
about communication‚Ä¶
 
Shotopop: Although we are 
represented by three agencies, 
they each cover very diÔ¨Äerent 
regions of the world, so luckily 
there‚Äôs no overlap or difficulty. 
We‚Äôre always very transparent 
in what we do and who we work 
with; for us it‚Äôs all about being 
open and honest.
Our agents are like part of our 
studio. If we didn‚Äôt have them, 
we‚Äôd need to employ people in 
their place. They complement 
and strengthen us, and we can‚Äôt 
fault them. Pros include getting 
awesome projects to work on 
and not having to worry about 
contracts and red tape.
An agent isn‚Äôt someone who 
tells us what to do, they represent 
our interests. If you end up with 
an agent that starts giving you 
feedback, or comes between 
you and the client, you should 
reconsider the relationship.
 
Meanwhile, Luisa Rivera 
shares¬†how being unrepresented 
can allow you to¬†be more  
self-sufficient‚Ä¶
LR: Not having an agent has 
allowed me freedom because I 
am more in control of my own 
practice. I have learned a lot in 
the process: how to negotiate, 
manage a project, and create a 
more personal relationship with 
my clients. The cons are practical 
because you end up doing more 
work (that is, more admin).
I try to network and showcase 
myself as much as I can, either via 
email, Ô¨Ånding blogs to feature my 
work or on social media. I show 
Ô¨Ånished illustrations but also 
my process, because that helps 
others to understand my method. 
When¬†I manage my commissions, 
I prioritise projects or clients that 
are meaningful to me.¬†
Communications have shifted 
in the last Ô¨Åve years, allowing 
illustrators to engage more 
directly with art directors, so 
having an agent nowadays isn‚Äôt 
mandatory. It will help if you want 
to focus on the creative side, and 
especially if you decide to work 
within certain industries like 
advertising. However, like in any 
relationship, you should Ô¨Ånd a 
good Ô¨Åt: someone you trust and 
who understands your work.

and don‚Äôt know where to start,

FEBRUARY 2017
I grew up in a big old house in Yonkers, 
New York. My parents, both artists/
designers, had their studios on the top 
Ô¨Çoor along with their archives, and to my 
endless delight, shelves of magazines. 
They had every issue of Graphis; stacks 
of the beautifully designed Avant Garde 
and Eros; Pogo comics; old Esquire mags 
(with covers photographed by their 
friend Carl Fischer), and of course, the 
New Yorker and New York Magazines. 
I used to spend hours up there, burning 
all of it into my brain, but the real reason 
I returned to the shelves time and time 
again as a kid was for MAD Magazine.
Ah, MAD! My parents had every issue, 
from its debut as a comic book to when 
it switched to the now-classic magazine 
format (issue 24), up to the then-present 
day (1976). I read every issue front to back 
‚Äì memorising every word, every drawing, 
every pun, every twisted illustration. 
What made MAD so great? Well, in 
my mind then, as now: everything.
First of all, the logo was incredible: 
three intricate, circus-style letterforms 
Ô¨Ålled with tiny characters drawn by 
Sergio Aragon√©s running around in 
a bacchanalian frenzy. It was like a 
Hieronymus Bosch inside that logo.
Then there were the covers, featuring 
the inimitable Alfred E. Newman. I soaked 
up every absurd situation he got himself 
into, whether he was impossibly eating 
sweetcorn, or swimming with Bruce, the 
shark from Jaws. And each cover always 
said ‚Äòour price xx¬¢ cheap,‚Äô even as the price 
went up over the years (I‚Äôve always wanted 
to put that on a proposal).
MAD was full of unforgettable details. 
The masthead listed the contributors as 
‚Äòthe usual gang of idiots,‚Äô a phrase I still 
use to this day to describe my friends, 
family and team ‚Äì much to their chagrin. 
Its movie and television parodies were 
Ô¨Çawlessly punny (favourites included Star 
Blecch, The Putrid Family, and M*I*S*H 
M*O*S*H), and each issue ended with the 
MAD Fold-in: a brilliant illustration drawn 
by Al Jaffee that asked a loaded question 
and, when folded just so, revealed an anti-
establishment jab as an answer.
MAD FOR IT
Emily Oberman ‚Äì a multi-disciplinary 
designer and partner at Pentagram ‚Äì 
discusses what her childhood love for MAD 
magazine has taught her about humour, 
silliness and going against the grain. 
MAD was a class-clown masterclass: 
I learned about drawing from Mort Drucker 
(my dad loved Mort‚Äôs line work) and about 
absurdist humour from Don Martin. MAD 
showed me the joy of language, as wry 
parody, political nose-thumbing and sheer 
nonsensical gibberish ran rampant on 
every page in equal measure. From sound 
effects like FWAK, SHTOINK, and GLINK 
to the oft-used furshlugginer ‚Äì a fake 
Yiddish word for something old, battered, 
and junky (as in ‚ÄòI better Ô¨Ånish this 
furshlugginer essay on time‚Äô) ‚Äì absolutely 
nothing was off limits.
But the biggest thing that MAD 
magazine gave me, the thing that I carry 
every day, which permeates my life both 
as a designer and as a person, is that it‚Äôs 
okay (that it‚Äôs great, really) to be funny, 
subversive, outspoken, silly and smart. 
And that you can be all of those things 
at once, if you want. I‚Äôm glad I live in a 
MAD world. I‚Äôm a better weirdo for it.
