Making  
the cover
Editor Nick’s original brief – ‘one of those secret 
agent-style encoded messages’ – was wonderfully 
evocative and seemed simple enough in principle, 
but in practice, this proved one of our most 
difficult cover treatments to execute.
Maintaining the clarity of the exposed cover 
lines in the body of the text (printed on the thick, 
Pantone red insert card) was an editorial challenge 
in itself, but nudging and tweaking that copy to 
accommodate our ﬂuted foil headline resulted 
in several rounds of reﬁnements.
Equally, creating the die cut to punch out the 
cover lines should have been simple enough, but 
as with any additional manufacturing process, 
the need for absolute accuracy – 5mm error either 
way would make the cover lines illegible – led to 
palpable levels of anxiety in the art department.  
Left and below: Areas to be 
die cut needed to be simple 
and subtle enough not to 
threaten the structural 
integrity of the cover; so we 
slightly rounded the corners 
of each lozenge to reduce 
the chance of torn edges.

MARK WYNNE 
Nick and Mark worked so closely on this 
cover, they brought to (Mark’s) mind the epic 
Spice Girls smash, Two Become One (which 
Mark has only just discovered is about sex). 
Below: While this schematic 
shows two separate layers, 
the two different foils are 
actually laid on one plate 
– the ﬂuted effect on the 
headline (right) is achieved 
by embossing once the foil 
plate has been printed.

Editor’s letter

KEEP IN TOUCH WITH…
Quit your job. It’s a pretty empowering statement: if 
you’re not creatively rewarded, feel like you can’t reach 
your full potential, or are generally under-appreciated, 
don’t just sit there and take it: make 2018 the year to 
make your dreams a reality.
When we put a tweet out asking for stories of people 
who had done just that, the response was overwhelming. 
We explore the topic in detail this month, part of an issue 
dedicated to making those new year’s resolutions count for 
something. Whether it’s ﬁnally launching that side project 
that’s been on the back-burner, tackling your stress levels to 
ﬁnd a better work-life balance, or landing a massive client 
as a portfolio centrepiece – it’s up to you to make it happen.
Our rather special collectable cover is all about making 
a promise to yourself: a pledge to make 2018 your best year 
ever. The speciﬁcs, of course, are up to you – we’ve provided 
some suggestions, and some advice to get you started – but 
only you know what your list of goals looks like.
As our video proﬁle demonstrates, sometimes there’s no 
substitute for unswerving passion and hard graft: the co-
founders of Bristol-based studio Fiasco threw themselves 
into business seven years ago with no prior experience 
whatsoever, and ended up with a BAFTA and a D&AD 
Pencil within their ﬁrst few years of business.
It may not work out all the time, but you can learn from 
that too. In a one-oﬀ special feature, we’ve replaced our 
regular behind-the-scenes project diaries at the back of the 
mag with private diaries instead, in which Marian Bantjes 
and Michael Johnson share creative concepts for clients 
that never made it oﬀ the drawing board, but are still 
inspiring pieces of work in their own right.
Next month, we bring you our hotlist of illustrators to 
watch this year – an invaluable reference guide for your 
next big commission or collaboration. See you then!

BRAIN POWER
Mental health considerations are increasingly 
moving focus away from body performance, 
and towards the brain-body connection instead
TRENDS
N
euroscientist Dr Tara Swart, founder of The Unlimited 
Mind, teaches techniques to achieve mental reliance and 
peak brain performance. She focuses on ﬁve fundamentals 
of neuroscience: rest, which examines the sleep best for your 
brain; fuel, looking at foods that are brain boosting; hydrate, which 
ensures enough water is consumed to allow proper neuron function; 
oxygenate, which encompasses the types of exercise that boost 
brains for successful ageing; and simplify, which takes in mindfulness 
in the form of meditation, yoga, mindful eating and mindful walking.
Brain-optimising products, services and experiences are coming 
to the fore in the form of nootropic consumables, tech add-ons and 
tailored exercise regimes. Brands are working with neuroscientists to 
infuse their products with brain-optimising features. Using technology, 
and natural and synthetic chemicals, innovative designers are creating 
products and services that enable us to program efficiency and 
optimisation into our cognitive activities.
Dr Swart has recently been offering an overnight experience called 
the Brain Power Package. It includes a menu of nutrient-rich meals, 
mindfulness sessions, heated marble ﬂoors claimed to help neutralise 
the effects of electromagnetic interference on the brain-body system, 
blackout blinds to aid sleep, treatment sessions, a series of talks on topics 
from the science of the brain to politics, sleep pods for power napping, 
and a Brain Lab where guests can learn to develop mental resilience. 
Created by food technologist Angus Brown, and developed in 
collaboration with neuroscientist Dr Andrew Scholey, Arepa is a 
juice-based drink containing L-theanine, as well as other supposedly 
mind-enhancing ingredients, such as pine extract. The fruit of four years’ 
development at New Zealand's The FoodBowl food innovation centre, 
the apple and blackcurrant ﬂavoured drink is said to stimulate alpha 
brain waves, claimed to boost creativity and reduce depression.
Developed in collaboration with neuroscientists, Brain.FM is an 
artiﬁcial intelligence music composer that delivers tailored musical 
treatments claimed to affect cognitive activity. The musical vibrations 
promote one of ﬁve cognitive states: focus, relax, meditation, nap and 
sleep, and are said to complement the brain's natural frequencies.
HeadStrong is a new Equinox group ﬁtness class that combines brain 
and body training to push physical and mental boundaries in a four-part 
‘active regeneration’ workout. Described as the intersection between 
high intensity and mindful movement, the 60-minute class has four 
key sections, each with a customised soundscape. 
California-based start-up HVMN believes humans can be quantiﬁed, 
optimised and upgraded. It designs and develops products that enhance 
key biometrics relating to our cognitive, physical and metabolic output. 
Its Nootrobox comprises four products – Rise, Kado-3, Sprint and Yawn 
– that focus on key aspects of brain health and performance with the 
aim of providing a sophisticated way to nourish our sophisticated brains.

A
iming to combine bright 
clean walls with lots 
of colour and texture, 
Robin Eisenberg created her LA 
home studio in her two-bedroom 
apartment in early 2017. It’s the 
ﬁrst time the artist and illustrator 
has had her own studio space, 
and she absolutely loves it. 
“I genuinely get to so excited 
about working every day,” she 
says. “I love being in spaces that 
feel vibrant and lived in, but also 
calming and organised. Being at 
my desk makes me feel like my 
brain is happy and focused.”
That focus can also have its 
downsides, however, as Eisenberg 
admits she is sometimes “not as 
present” as she’d like to be in other 
parts of her life. A collection of 
objects given to her by her parents 
and husband remind her of “life 
outside of art” (1). “The geode Lady 
Cave is by Chaparral Studio and 
I am so in love with it,” she says. 
A sample of pins (2) she’s 
collected over the past couple 
of years also keeps her inspired. 
“When I ﬁrst moved back to LA 
in 2015 after being away for a few 
years, I discovered the pin-making 
world and was inspired to start 
making my own pins and selling 
them. Starting a shop and meeting 
other pin makers was so exciting, 
and it really changed a lot of things 
for me as an artist,” she says.
One wall of Eisenberg’s studio 
is adorned with her own art (3). 
“I like having my work up behind 
me, it kind of makes me feel like 
my drawings have my back while 
I’m working on new stuff,” she grins.
She also enjoys having her 
books and piano (4) close by. “If I’m 
ever having a moment of frustration 
with a project, I’ll take a break and 
play the piano, and I always feel 
calmer afterwards,” she says. 
Eisenberg’s coloured pencils (5) 
were a gift from one of her closest 
friends, and although the leopard 
is actually a case, she doesn’t keep 
anything in it. “I just like having a 
leopard on my desk,” she shrugs. 
VIBRANT YET CALMING

AMERICAN DREAM
Josh Peter, who is heading up O Street’s new Denver division, 
reveals why the Scottish studio has decided to cross the pond
NEW VENTURES
uring a trip to the US supported 
by Scottish Development 
International, O Street found that 
Denver, Colardo was a booming place for 
new businesses, start-ups and tech. The 
team liked it so much they decided to set 
up a studio there. We asked Josh Peter how 
this new venture will work in practice…
Why were you drawn to Denver?
Denver has a vibrant arts culture, a great 
climate and is one of the craft beer capitals 
in the world, making it an amazing ﬁt for 
our expertise. With the population rapidly 
growing, the culture out here is fresh. It 
feels like it’s just getting started.
 
How will the studios work together?
When our UK studio is winding down its 
day, our US studio is just getting started, 
meaning the former can easily hand work 
off to the latter. We’ve retooled our meeting 
schedule to accommodate a designated 
time of 4pm GMT and 9am MST. It’s going 
smoothly so far, but we’re just getting started.
At the moment, it’s the UK studio that’s 
doing the lion’s share of the work but we 
envision it becoming 50/50 as the US family 
grows. The early creative stages of projects 
will be cross-studio and collaborative, and for 
quality control, it’s likely that one studio will 
then see the project through to production. 
As for managing, it’s communication, 
communication, communication.
What are the risks and the beneﬁts of 
setting up a new studio in the US? 
The obvious risks are upfront business 
costs, though we’ve managed to keep 
these relatively lean so far. The beneﬁts 
are limitless: new opportunities, new clients, 
higher fees and the opportunity to have 
a real cultural impact on a new place.
What are the main differences between 
US and European (or UK) design? 
The States is such a massive place, it’s not 
really fair to paint the whole industry here 
with one brush. However, there does seem 
to be an approach being championed more 
obviously in European design studios at 
the moment: a depth of strategic thought 
paired with a strong aesthetic sensibility. 
The O Street approach is to begin every 
project with a focus on research, the end 
users’ needs and ﬁnding design solutions 
that yield results. We ﬁnish those projects 
by making sure we have created something 
that looks and feels beautiful.
How do you think US clients will ﬁnd your 
approach compares to US agencies?
The tradition of Swiss modernism runs deep 
on the European side of the Atlantic. Even an 
offbeat studio like ours will impress American 
clients with the care and thoughtfulness we 
bring to their design needs.
What are your plans for future growth? 
We plan to grow how we always have: 
doing good work while being ourselves. 
Our goal is to pick up steam until we have 
a few designers working for us in Denver, 
then repeat the process in another city. 
With the US studio currently in a co-working 
space, we’re yet to see how that will work 
out physically – but we’re excited about this 
modern era of re-evaluating workspaces.

Peter (second from right) 
is returning to his native 
America to set up the 
new studio.

OFFF By Night – took over a vast 
warehouse space in Antwerp with 
giant LED screens, artisan food 
stalls, an array of ping pong tables 
and retro games, and of course a 
three-day programme of inspiring 
talks from some of the world’s 
most exciting creatives… 
Diverse topics ranged from 
multi-sensory VR experiences, to 
Aaron Duffy’s ‘10 signs you’re an 
advertophile’ – but a sentiment 
shared by many speakers was the 
value of creative experimentation, 
and how to create an environment 
in which it’s possible, and more 
importantly, fruitful.
 “Testing out new technologies 
can inspire you,” was CATK’s take. 
Notable for its surreal combinations 
of organic shapes and colours, the 
Berlin-based agency demonstrated 
one such experiment in action: 
Shrooms, a psychedelic feast for the 
eyes that got a round of applause 
from the assembled crowd.
CATK’s ﬁrst major commercial 
project came in 2012, working with 
Wolff Olins on the new Windows 
8 packaging. Despite the huge 
corporate nature of the client, the 
ﬁnal illustrations were all freeform 
creative experiments.
Meanwhile, for Nike Lab’s 
Ryan Belmont, innovation and 
experimentation is the order of 
the day every day. “It’s like being 
back in college,” he grinned. 
“We’re just playing, seeing what 
works.” One fascinating example 
was an installation at Milan Design 
Week dedicated to the theme 
of movement, which featured 
everything from high-tech motion-
capture technology to a lo-ﬁ stack 
of shoeboxes, arranged into a 
sweeping, dynamic curve. 
Belmont also showcased Nike 
Lab’s collaboration with a small 
group of fashion students from top 
design colleges, which expresses

At Antwerp’s second Us By Night festival, Nick Carson was struck by the 
inspiring results that freeform creative experimentation can yield

some of Nike’s material innovations 
through costume design and dance.
Diversity of style is another likely 
byproduct of experimental spirit. As 
Jonathan Zawada revealed in his 
talk, his illustrations have evolved 
enormously over the course of his 
career. He’s even pledged to never 
let the client dictate the look and 
feel of a piece, valuing creativity 
over cash – if they don’t like it, 
he won’t charge so long as he 
can use it for his own purposes.
In fact, for almost three years 
Zawada decided to stop working 
commercially almost entirely in 
order to focus on oil painting 
experiments in Los Angeles. He’s 
since moved back to a remote part 
of his native Australia so he can do 
the kind of work he loves without 
the constraints of LA’s cost of living. 
”I have a system underpinning 
the way I make work – a system for 
curiosity, to explore ideas,” he said. 
“Often, it’s about designing without 
intent. Creating an environment to 
mess around in, not consciously 
visualising the outcome.”
Animator Saiman Chow, when 
discussing the lack of consistency in 
his practice, shrugged that he’s “not 
wired that way” – in no small part 
because of his ADHD.
“I look for new challenges,” he 
explained. As a teenager, Chow’s 
family emigrated from Hong Kong 
to LA following the Tiananmen 
Square massacre. Adaptation was 
tough, and themes of social isolation 
permeate much of his work.
“In school, the most fun I had 
was huddled in the corner painting,” 
he recalled. Like Zawada, Chow had 
a epiphany: he decided to focus on 
himself and consciously dial back 
the commercial work. “Money is 
not my motivation,” he insisted.
Mario Hugo, co-founder of New 
York-based creative agency Hugo 
& Marie, mischievously described 
his own creative direction process 
as like drink-driving. “My thinking is 
cyclical, disorganised and spiralling,” 
Clockwise  
from left:  
Us By Night’s 
Living Room 
stage replaced 
traditional 
conference 
chairs for rugs 
and sofas; one 
of the giant LED 
screens, and 
ping pong table; 
festival branding; 
Jonathan Zawada 
showing some 
of his creative 
experiments; 
two cars painted 
white acted as 
freeform canvases 
for creativity.
he confessed. Like Zawada, he is 
prickly about client intervention: 
“I want to explore things that I want 
to explore, not the things my clients 
want me to do,” he shrugged.
 Boutique Swiss agency Studio 
Feixen has its own system to aid 
freedom of expression: “We think in 
games,” explained co-founder Felix 
Pfäffli. “Our process doesn’t lead to 
one outcome, but a set of rules that 
govern many outcomes.”
One example was an education 
project that explored how a group 
of people can design something 
truly collaboratively. One group 
established a system whereby half 
of them would try to write the word 
‘play’ using a grid of paper titles, 
while the other half tried to destroy 
it by ripping them up. A second 
group turned the creative process 
into a dance, passing shapes and 
colours around between them.
As all these examples attest, 
formulaic thinking and box-ticking 
will get you nowhere creatively.

and how he envisions life. He describes it as “a journal 
on my quest to ﬁnd and create beauty, which is 
perhaps my biggest obsession.” 
Aristizábal sees Instagram as a great way to gain 
an audience who engage directly with his art and 
experiments. It also allows him to discover talented 
artists and inspirational feeds.
“I believe I’m a very moody person, and these 
swings are reﬂected in my work and subsequently 
in my feed,” he admits. “I can trace moments of joy, 
sadness, confusion, and curiosity just by looking at 
the colours and themes of my Instagram account.”

L
ately, I’ve been thinking about thinking. 
Almost every weekday morning, I walk 
down the hill from home to the Baxter and 
Bailey studio in central Brighton. It’s a lovely walk, 
downhill all the way (and consequently less lovely on 
the homeward leg), and is a half-hour window to get 
my thoughts in order before diving into the emails, 
phone calls, catch-ups, discussions and the demands 
of the studio day. Every morning for the past week, 
I’ve walked past the same flyposter. It appears to be 
promoting a gallery show and it says this, in glitchy 
and distressed uppercase typography: KEEP 
MOVING, STOP THINKING.
The poster achieved exactly half of its stated aim, 
in that I did indeed keep moving. But what it failed 
to convince me to do was to stop thinking. In fact, it 
did the opposite. And what it made me start thinking 
was: ‘Get off my case, glitchy typographic poster, 
we need more thinking not less.’ In fact, other than 
perhaps JUMP IN THIS POOL OF LAVA or POP 
YOUR HEAD INSIDE THIS JUICER, I can’t think of 
many all-caps commands that are more guaranteed 
to keep me moving very fast in the opposite direction 
while thinking very hard.
KEEP MOVING, STOP THINKING is all very well 
if you’re running away from bees or the Terminator. 
And while it’s true that in this industry, the ability 
to move – to develop, to evolve, to move forwards 
towards a solution, to relentlessly pursue an idea – 
are all vitally important attributes, what we really 
need are thinkers. The best designers are thinking 
designers. All of my design heroes (and I’m guessing 
some of yours too) are thinkers. Some are conceptual 
thinkers with one foot in the fine art or craft camps 
– people like Alan Fletcher, Tibor Kalman, Jim 
Sutherland, Vaughan Oliver or Paula Scher. And some 
are more commercial thinkers, always with an eye 
on the brand or the system – people like Michael 
Johnson, Michael Bierut or Margaret Calvert. 
What unites this disparate bunch of genii is a 
thoughtfulness in their work: they make brainy, 
deep work that means something to them, their 
clients and their clients’ audiences.
And while I’m as easily seduced by a beautiful 
aesthetic as the next fickle designer (and just as likely 
to exclaim: ‘Ooh, just look at that fluoro spot colour 
and foil detailing!’), the design work that really 
delights me is the stuff that’s clearly been thought 
about. When I see thoughtful, clever or intelligent 
work, the reaction isn’t quite, ‘I wish I’d done that’, 
but more: ‘I wish I’d thought of that.’
When we founded Baxter and Bailey five years 
ago, we decided straight away to build a thoughtful 
business. The first thing we did, before buying a Mac 
or a chair or a bookshelf or a bag of coffee beans, was 
to sit down for a day in a borrowed Covent Garden 
meeting room and design a thoughtful business plan. 
We thought hard about client sectors that we already 
enjoyed working in or had good track record in, and 
we actively avoided sectors we didn’t like. We thought 
hard about mistakes we’d made in our design pasts 
and made firm commitments not to repeat them.
When thinking about and writing this business 
plan, we also tried to ensure that the design business 
we were creating allowed us to be thoughtful outside 
of the studio too. Dom and I were both already dads 
by this point and consequently were becoming 
experts in dad jokes and dad 
dancing, and were in danger 
of developing an irrational 
fondness for fleeces. So we 
committed to think hard about 
ways in which our business 
could be ambitious, brave and 
brilliant while allowing us to 
be good parents too. We were 
keen not to fall into all of those 
classic design studio shabby 
habits: habitual late hours, 
weekend working, neglectful 
parenting. And while this 
thoughtful approach doesn’t 
always work perfectly in 
practice – I’m typing this on 
a Sunday afternoon – we’re 
giving out-of-hours thoughtfulness our best shot.
In recent years, as the studio has grown, this 
thoughtful approach is still embedded in our DNA 
and informs how we look out for great new designers. 
We’re firm believers that good designers are thinking 
designers. I’d go a bit further, and say that designers 
who think deeply and widely about their work are 
already strategists in the broadest sense. They think 
about how the work meets the brief, how clearly it 
will communicate, how well it marries up with the 
brand strategy or aims or ambitions. And, if they’re 
really good, they’ll think about all of this carefully 
and make it look brilliant too. And if they’re nice 
people with excellent taste in biscuits too, we’re sold.
Maybe it’s time for a flyposting campaign of our 
own. I can see it now: clean, clear, bold and brilliant 
all-caps typography. Not a glitch or a distressed 
texture in sight. And the copy? KEEP MOVING BY 
ALL MEANS, BUT FOR GAWD’S SAKE, THINK!

“It’s very easy when you’re running 
a small studio to become completely 
consumed by the job you’re working 
on. Often weeks go by in a relentless 
pursuit for perfection as everything 
else is put on hold. One thing I’ve learnt 
over the last few years, is that your 
best work rarely comes from working 
in this way. In 2018, I would like to 
remember to take a step back, even 
when the pressure is on. If something 
isn’t working, not to force it – and to 
give myself the time to make sure it’s 
right. To try and ensure this happens, 
I’m moving our daily studio catch ups 
to the end of the day – the idea being 
that this should act as a consistent 
reminder to go home and rest.”
“For me, this January marks surviving 
two years of self-employment. Working 
as a freelancer can be somewhat feast 
or famine – either I’m too busy for side 
projects, or I’m spending my quieter 
periods trying to drum up more work, 
feeling guilty at the prospect of 
spending a couple of days learning 
something new. Entering year two with 
regular clients and a more consistent 
workﬂow feels like a good time for 
some creative resolutions – to learn 
some of the other Adobe CC apps that 
I already pay for, practise hand 
lettering more and improve my 
photography skills. I also need to 
just pick up a pencil or pen and draw 
more, even if no one sees it but me.”

E  
very year, I make the 
same new year’s 
resolution: to stop 
biting my nails. I then badly 
paint my poor stubs for about a week until my boyfriend complains 
of the smell of nail polish remover and I have an excuse to give in. 
This year, I’m not bothering with the facade. I’ve ﬁnally accepted that 
biting my nails is linked to anxiety, and if I’ve got any hope of growing 
them, I’d better address the underlying issue instead. 
Like many creatives, I’m a perfectionist, and this urge for perfection 
is both a blessing and a curse. While it means I strive to do the best job 
I possibly can, sometimes I completely lose perspective. My nightmares 
are made of misplaced apostrophes, misspelt names and unchecked 
facts. Just the thought of a past mistake is enough to send me on a spiral 
of despair, and while I know I’m good at my job, all it takes is one error 
and I’ll disregard a whole project as a failure. 
That creative drive also means I get obsessed easily. I get so gripped 
by an idea that I ﬁnd it hard to think or talk about anything else. The 
problem for me comes when my sleep is disturbed – that’s my red 
ﬂag, and I have to remind myself to do something about it before the 
obsession quickly becomes sleep itself. How many hours did I get 
last night? Why did I wake up at 3am? Can I get away with cancelling 
everything until I get a solid 
eight hours? (Sorry people with 
young children, but some of us 
are still chasing that dream.)
The more I talk about this, the more I ﬁnd that it’s not just me. I’ve 
also come to realise that while some of my best ideas have been in the 
middle of the night, I’m perfectly capable of thinking and creating 
during working hours, as long as I’m well-rested. A surplus of ideas is 
useless if you’re too tired to execute them properly.
I think we all need to remember that however important we think 
our work is, a job is just a job. It’s not worth losing sleep over. It’s not 
worth working yourself to the bone and neglecting everything and 
everyone else, not worth feeling the need to check your emails outside 
of work hours. Most of all, it’s not worth neglecting yourself. 
That’s why this year, my new year’s resolution is to make a conscious 
eﬀort to tackle my anxiety head on, and give myself both the time and 
space to do so, regardless of the state of my nails. I’m determined to take 
more care of myself, to take a step back when I feel things getting on top 
of me, to prioritise a good night’s sleep and to ﬁnd more time to do the 
things I love, outside of work. I urge you to do the same.   
How are you going to take better care of yourself this year? Tweet your

“This is a fantastic example of concept-driven 
branding. Whoever came up with the snout 
lockup, I tip my hat to you for keeping a 
strong playful element without that godawful 
illustration. Bravo. I also love the animation 
application of the logo to give the sense of 
space. This is a really solid rebrand and the 
application of it is gorgeous. One thing I was 
interested to see is whether the design team 
would change the jingle to match the dropping 
of the .com ‘moooonpig dot com’. (Sorry if 
that’s now looping in your head.) Interestingly, 
they have dropped the ‘.com’ and replaced it 
with a whistle. I’m unsure how this will pan 
out, and whether they will drop all the spoken 
words for the tonal melody of it all, so it 
currently seems a bit unﬁnished.”
“Working with Moonpig’s creative director 
James Turner and his in-house design team, 
my own team and I adopted an ‘inside-out’ 
approach to this rebrand. Basing ourselves 
in Moonpig’s office, surrounded by its weird 
and wonderful products, we quickly got 
to understand the company, its customers 
and culture. We interpreted Moonpig’s 
new positioning into a simple idea: ‘Life is 
more light-hearted on the moon.’ With this 
thinking at the core, we were able to entice 
people into our weightless world. A key part 
of this was the commission of a bespoke font 
by Face37 in three styles: lift, wobble and 
shake. To create more stretch to the visual 
identity we designed a fun app icon – our 
pig’s snout – based on the two ‘O’s, and an 
extended version of the logotype, to interact 
with its signature jingle.”
MATTHEW HAUKE

“I never minded the charmingly kitsch original 
brand of Moonpig. Yes, it wasn’t particularly 
sophisticated, but it still tried to convey a sense 
of joy and wonder for gift giving. But like many 
dot-com era brands, its identity aged, and to 
keep up with modern gift-focused outlets 
such as Not On The High Street and Etsy, it 
desperately needed to be updated. The rebrand 
shoots for the moon and nails it – striking a 
fantastic balance between sophistication and 
playfulness. It’s charming, clever and modern, 
allowing it to sit with other gift sites easily. 
The playful typography, the soft pastel colours, 
the snout icon – all exemplify the joyful sense 
of gift giving in an incredibly simple manner. 
More importantly, it transitions Moonpig from 
a last-minute, quick-ﬁx solution for cards into 
the go-to place for gift giving.”

TYPOGRAPHIC TAPESTRY
ATYPI IDENTITY
by Julien Hébert 
www.julienhebert.net
Entrusted with the design of the 2017 identity for Montreal-
based typography conference ATypi, graphic designer Julien 
Hébert took the opportunity to challenge the traditional 
conventions of type design. Channelling Montreal’s “multiple 
personalities”, Hébert pulled together a wide variety of 
loud typefaces and beautiful custom lettering to create 
a joyful typographic tapestry.
“The design had to convey Montreal’s dualities, quirkiness 
and boldness,” recalls Hébert. “I wanted each element of the 
identity to feel special, while maintaining a common graphic 
language. As the communications leading to the event were 
numerous and published over very long period, it was crucial 
to create a ﬂexible system that wasn’t redundant.”

which helps those affected by the world’s worst humanitarian 
crises. Briefed via his agent Handsome Frank to produce three 
web-based illustrations for an article on forced marriage – 
entitled ‘I am too young to marry you’ – he worked closely 
with the IRC team to bring to life an interview in Rumbek 
with ‘Rachel’ and her 13-year-old daughter ‘Helena’.
“I broke the story down into three events: the treatment of 
the young girl as a commodity, the threat of violence she had 
to endure and the ﬁnal homecoming,” explains Blow. “I wanted 
to convey a strong sense of place, which involved researching 
and absorbing the South Sudanese landscape. I also wanted 
the young girl to be identiﬁed quickly and graphically, so the 
use of a wedding dress was simple and effective.”

it enjoyable to engage with.”
Making the physical experiments 
work was challenging at times, he admits. 
“We didn’t really have a clear idea of where

CRAFTY BRANDING 
FIERCE & NOBLE IDENTITY
by Halo 
www.wearehalo.co.uk
Bristol studio Halo was approached to create a strategy, name, brand identity 
and packaging for a new craft brewery in St Werburghs, Bristol. The name 
– Fierce & Noble – represents the brewery team’s ﬁerce independence and 
respect for the heritage of the craft, while the bold creative, custom type and 
bespoke patterns reﬂect the local vibrancy of its location.
“The product needed to jump out on bar and shelf,” explains Halo design 
director Andy German. “And what with the brewery being in a creative vibrant 
area of Bristol with other craft breweries in it, it made sense for the building to 
stand out and be seen. The main pattern for the brand was based around the 
ampersand we made – my eyes went a bit fuzzy creating this one.”

responding to the script by Helen M. Farrell, 
‘What is Bipolar Disorder?’ 
“We wanted to ﬁnd a way to aid 
the script by simply and sensitively 
communicating the disorder to people with 
little knowledge of it, without oversimplifying 
or belittling the huge effect it has on so 
many people on a daily basis,” explains 
Uncle Ginger co-founder Hugh Cowling.
“We looked initially at ‘60s and ‘70s 
medical journal and book cover design 
for the way they intimately communicate 
subject matter that’s both poignant and 
complex,” adds co-founder Owen Gent. 
The pair quickly discovered that by 
limiting themselves to just shape, colour, 
motion and sound, there was very little to 
hide behind. “Each tiny detail had to be 
just right,” says Cowling.  
ENCRYPTED TYPE
IBM ILLUSTRATION
by Sawdust 
www.madebysawdust.co.uk
 
When IBM Systems Magazine asked 
Sawdust to illustrate an article about a 
paradigm shift in the industry – from 
selective encryption, to simply encrypting 
everything – the duo looked to the cyber 
world for inspiration. “We were asked 
to visualise the text ‘Paradigm Shift to 
Pervasive Encryption’ in a way that spoke 
to the written piece,” recalls designer Rob 
Gonzalez. “We liked the idea of super 
computers and giant servers being the 
typography – who wouldn’t?”
Finding a balance between image 
and type, proved challenging. “It’s a ﬁne 
line and often what can happen is one 
becomes compromised by the other,” 
adds designer Jonathan Quainton. “That 
balance is always a challenge to get right.”

STEFANO SAUCES BRANDING
by lg2 
www.lg2.com
Montreal-based agency lg2 took an original 
approach to its branding of the ﬁrst ready-to-
eat products from well-known chef Stefano 
Faita and his partner Michele Forgione. 
Featuring a jovial, energetic caricature of 
Faita, the identity gives each sauce a unique 
typographic treatment – with nutritional and 
legal information presented in an unusual 
vertical fashion outside the shape.
“It was a major challenge to differentiate the 
brand in this type of category, where all brands 
merge into one,” says David Kessous, creative 
director at lg2. “The concept’s originality 
produced a real, appealing identity and 
packaging that leaps out.”

ould your current role be holding you 
back? What do you want from your 
job this year? Progression? New skills? 
More experience under your belt? Maybe 
you’re motivated by the prospect of a pay 
rise, or recognition from your peers. 
No job is perfect. But if you’re no longer 
being creatively challenged at work, or feel 
that your skills aren’t being fully utilised 
or appreciated – or you’re just not giving it 
your all anymore – we have good news: 
there’s never been a better time to quit.

sticking one to your boss after Christmas. 
These are politically and economically

“Whilst the market is far more 
complex than it used to be,” begins 
Stuart Youngs, “it’s still comparatively 
small and there are so many more ways 
to discover who’s interesting through 
blogs, social media, magazines and 
awards, for example.”

GO TO EVENTS
The best way to scope out 
the competition, though, is real life 
networking. “We’re an industry awash

is to get to them and get chaing. 
You’ll learn and you’ll connect.”

work across more projects, experience a

She says that one of the biggest dangers 
of staying at a studio too long is becoming 
too comfortable, and not being creatively 
challenged. “Too much of the same 
routine can lead to complacency and, 
at worst, stagnation,” she says. “It’s better 
to always feel just a little bit scared. Doing 
unfamiliar things may be daunting, 
but it’s also incredibly motivating. If 
you don’t have enough new challenges 
or opportunities coming your way, try 
to create them. But if that doesn’t work, 
it might be time to move on.”

INDUSTRY ISSUES
FEBRUARY 2018
01   
KNOW YOUR GOAL
Promotions don’t just occur 
with time anymore. You must clearly 
demonstrate how you meet the 
requirements of a new role – so make 
sure you know where you want to 
be and exactly what that position 
entails, and then look to take on more 
responsibility in your current job. 
02 
CHANGE HOW THE 
STUDIO WORKS
One of the best ways to prove your 
value is to make your studio more 
eﬃcient or save the team money. 
Pay aention to processes, and look 
to other departments or studios for 
inspiration. As well as saving resources, 
streamlining workﬂow also shows an 
understanding of the bigger picture.
03   
SEEK FEEDBACK
You’ll need to get your 
boss on side for a promotion, so 
book a meeting to ﬁnd out what you 
need to do to get to a higher level 
within your studio. Ask about your 
manager’s objectives, too, so you can 
focus on helping them be successful. 
Communication is key, so seek 
feedback from your boss as well 
as other team members.
04  
DEMONSTRATE 
COMMITMENT
Striking a home-life balance is 
important, but if a crucial project 
deadline is looming, volunteering to 
work late – or simply to take on more 
work or help in an area outside your 
normal job role – shows commitment. 
(Just make sure working late doesn’t 
become expected.)
05  
USE YOUR 
INITIATIVE
Don’t sit around waiting to be told 
what to do – if you can see a way to 
help a project or add value, suggest 
it. A well-timed ‘I noticed that [certain 
task] needs doing – I’ll do that now’ 
will go further than you might think.

that interest you and aim for the ones 
whose work, philosophy and overall 
approach you genuinely admire. “Real 
enthusiasm and shared passions will 
come across and increase the chances of a 
great ﬁt,” she points out. “So who do you 
really want to work for, and why?”
She continues. “Also, don’t be shy – try 
getting in touch directly with the people 
you admire for an informal chat. A 
personal connection or recommendation 
of some sort always helps. Just remember: 
don’t act like a stalker.” 
Koto senior brand strategist Tom 
Moloney agrees that asking people you 
admire for career advice is a good move. 
“Ask your mates and colleagues who they 
rate; where they’ve worked; who they 
know. Just don’t say, ‘I’m thinking about 
moving on…’ ﬁrst,” he laughs. “Also, get 
your shit together – your CV, website, 
portfolio; whatever it is. There’s no 
shortcut. Just start doing it.”
Moloney took the opportunity to 
refocus his career by moving to Koto in 
September, after six years at NB Studio. 
“It was a combination of things: a very 
personal desire for a new challenge, and 
a professional ambition to focus on brand 
strategy,” he explains. “By moving to Koto, 
I was able to achieve both of these.”
He agrees that when it comes to 
knowing it’s time to move on from your 
current role, there are warning signs to 
watch out for. “If you’re not looking 
forward to going to work the majority of 
the time, or your motivation is dropping 
and you know that you’re not giving the 
role or your work your best eﬀort, then 
it’s time to move on,” he says. “But that 
doesn’t mean that it’s easy to leave 
somewhere, or to ﬁnd a new job.”
This is especially true if you’ve been 
out of the job-seeking game for a while, 
or you’ve been too comfortable in one 
role for too long. Many long-serving 
employees report a creeping uneasiness 
about the transferable value of their 
speciﬁc skills. If you feel like this, it’s 
a clear sign that you’re in danger of 
becoming institutionalised – and the 
only way to tackle it is to initiate change.
START YOUR OWN STUDIO
If you’re not feeling fully satisﬁed in your 
current position, another option is to start 
your own studio – which is exactly what 
Studio Texture founder Stuart Youngs did 
in March 2017. Previously a partner at 
brand consultancy Purpose, he launched 
Texture for one reason: autonomy. 
“I believe it’s crucial for studios to 
explore, experiment and take risks in 
pursuit of progress,” he explains. “It’s our 
creativity and ability to innovate that 
makes us attractive to clients. But to 
pioneer takes time, investment and an 
awful lot of practice. In my experience, 
that’s more difficult to do in a studio with 
bigger overheads and demands, where 
failure is often not an option.”
In his new role, Youngs is no longer 
accountable to a board. He has sole 
accountability to his family, team and 
clients. And although he admits this is far 
more pressure, he can now move faster 
and is free to make mistakes. “It’s 
sharpened the mind and, interestingly, 
made me more purposeful,” he reﬂects.   
So what about Brexit? Given our 
current political and economical 
backdrop, is there an argument for staying 
secure in a role – even if it isn’t creatively 
satisfying anymore? Not according to 
Youngs. “The age of security has long 
since gone,” he says. “The world is moving 
too fast for that. Today, it’s essential to be 
looking to tomorrow.”
For Youngs, the single biggest industry 
threat faced by designers who want to get 
a new job is fear, and the paralysis it 
perpetuates. “We can’t aﬀord to sit still 
and hope,” he says. “I believe we’re on the 
cusp of the biggest transformation our 
industry has ever seen. We’re about to 
enter the age, not just of artiﬁcial

intelligence, but the more profound 
augmented intelligence. The consequence 
is even more pressure on creativity and 
ideas; on originality and distinction – 
where the machines can’t compete.”
That said, don’t feel you have to move 
jobs for the sake of it. “Nobody should feel 
uncomfortable just from being in a studio 
for a long period of time,” he points out. 
“If you’re challenged, progressing and 
fulﬁlled, you should stay put. The grass 
isn’t greener. Promise.”
And don’t move purely for money. 
“If you’re moving for money, you’re 
missing the point. Move for opportunity. 
Money will follow if you pick the right 
opportunities and you’ll be much happier.” 
GET A PROMOTION
Of course, you don’t have to change 
studios to ﬁnd new opportunities. 
Your studio might not be advertising 
new job roles, but if you can make yourself 
invaluable to the team, you’re in a strong 
position to negotiate a promotion. 
Reiss Hinds started at multi-
disciplinary design agency BLUP on 
a three-month placement as a junior 
designer. During that time, he paid 
attention to the daily process and 
workﬂows used by his directors. “Email 
was the biggest one,” he recalls. “We were 
going back and forth so many times for 
alterations, so instead I suggested that we 
use Basecamp as our project management 
tool. It’s cut down our email time and kept 
all client services projects in one place.”
He continues: “I tried to provide my 
directors with as much value as possible 
– no job was too large for me to tackle. 
When my three months came to an end, 
I suggested that there was a need in the 
business for someone to help streamline 
and execute on brand strategy, for both 
our clients and for Studio BLUP’s brand.”
His advice? “Find a gap in either the 
market or in someone else’s business 
that you know you can enhance, and 

INDUSTRY ISSUES
01   
GO FREELANCE 
If it’s really time to move on 
from your current job but you can 
ﬁnd the right opportunity, then one 
option is to go freelance. Get yourself 
a website, business cards and separate 
business bank account, and once 
you’ve got some clients you’re good to 
go. (For more info, read Four Routes 
into Freelance Life, see CA .)
02 
TAKE ON SHIFTS  
Your favourite local agency 
might not be hiring – but they might 
occasionally need holiday cover or 
extra resource for a big project. If 
you can become a trusted freelancer 
through shi work, you’ll be ﬁrst in line 
when a suitable position does come 
up. And if nothing else, you’ll have 
broadened your portfolio. 
03   
SET UP YOUR OWN 
CREATIVE BUSINESS
Not sure about going it alone? Then 
pool your resources and set up a 
collective or studio. With the laer 
option it’s a good idea to seek out a 
business partner with complementary 
skills to yours – and make sure you 
draw up a contract, too.
04  
DO SOME PRO  
BONO WORK
Charity work can be a good way to 
balance an unsatisfactory day job. If 
you pick the right project, it’ll give you 
valuable experience and develop your 
portfolio, making you more employable 
when that perfect job does come up. 
So think about where you want to be, 
and look for a local pro bono project 
that might help you get there.

in return you could end up becoming 
the next big creative in your space.”
MOVE CLIENT-SIDE
Sometimes ﬁnding a better job involves 
playing the long game, as creative 
entrepreneur Simon Waterfall explains. 
The former D&AD president ﬁrst started 
talking to Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia 
in 2014. Three years later, it took Waterfall 
– who’s co-founded a number of leading 
digital studios and consultancies, 
including Poke, Fray, Social Suicide and 
Deepend – a total of 29 interviews over 
six months to land his new job as creative 
director of Samara, Airbnb’s recently 
launched design and innovation studio. 
That many interviews might have put 
oﬀ other candidates, but not Waterfall. 
So why was he so committed to moving 
client-side at Airbnb? “I was looking for 
a very simple thing: I wanted to change 
the world,” he explains. 
“How many places, people or brands 
can do that? Where are they? What do 
they do? Have they done it before? When 
you address these points, there are only 
a handful of companies – and most are in 
Silicon Valley,” he continues. “Working 
inside means you’re already in charge of 
the biggest asset: the community and 
audience you want to change.”
When you’re aiming for the stars, like 
Waterfall, reaching your goals isn’t going 
to happen overnight. He says you have to 
be prepared to really grind – and advises 
being patient. “Big dreams need time to 
solidify,” he reasons. 
And he agrees that the biggest industry 
threat to designers isn’t the likes of Brexit 
and a ﬂailing economy, but simply sitting 
still. “It’s the tiny, almost unnoticeable 
threats that are the real killer,” he says. 
“Murder by Powerpoint; death by 
meetings about meetings. Don’t go 
quiet, my friends: scream into the page 
and tear it up. Good luck 2018.”

Some raise a smile, others eyebrows, but 
one thing’s for sure: Wilfrid Wood‘s 
sculptures are never boring...
W I L F R I D  W O O D _ London-born Wilfrid grew up in rural Sussex, before studying 
graphics at Central St Martins. After a stint in publishing, he trained as a ‘headbuilder’ 
for satirical TV show Spitting Image, then set up shop as a freelance sculptor, now 
based in Hackney Wick. His work is provocative and playful in equal measure, and 
some pieces may cause offence to some readers. See more at www.wilfridwood.com

who doesn’t? Any situation can be 
enhanced with an element of nudity.  
Nude nude nude. See, I can’t stop 
saying it now.
You have an artistic family, and you 
said in your Something Good talk 
that it was hard to ﬁnd your own 
voice. How did you go about it?
I read an interview with the actor 
Michael Douglas, son of Kirk 
Douglas, who said ‘the children 
of famous parents tend to be slow 
developers’. I found it reassuring. 
The artists in my family weren’t 
exactly famous, but they were well 
known within their ﬁelds. They 
were strong personalities and had 
traditional views about how art 
should be done. At college, I was 
very bunged up with these received 
ideas. I envied people whose parents 
were accountants, who weren’t 
hamstrung by artistic convention. 
I tried to be a designer, then an 
illustrator, and for a while I wrote 
a lot of stories – none of which 
amounted to anything. Aged 30 
I started sculpting, which released 
me. Even so, it’s only over the last 
few years that I feel I’m doing 
what I really want to.
How did you carve a niche for 
yourself as a satirical sculptor? 
There were painters and designers 
and illustrators in my family, but no 
sculptors. I think that’s one of the 
reasons I’ve always liked doing 3D 
stuﬀ, because it was diﬀerent. 
The satirical bit is inﬂuenced 
by my time at Spitting Image, plus 
my tendency to try and make jokes. 
Now I think of myself as more of a 
portrait artist: I’m mainly drawing 
and sculpting real people I know 
rather than celebrities.
are celebrities, making use of his 
experience crafting political puppets 
for satirical TV show Spitting Image, 
but increasingly they are the result of 
private commissions. In other words, 
people who want to be sculpted, and 
are happy to pay for the privilege.
One thing’s certain: of all the 
talks at Bristol’s Something Good 
festival in October, Wood was 
certainly the most memorable – so 
we were curious to ﬁnd out more... 
What did Spitting Image teach you 
about the craft of caricature – any 
lessons you still apply today?
It was a panicky and hilarious job, 
with tight deadlines, burning hot 
glue, noxious gases and puppets 
with squints. I had no technical 
background and barely knew how 
to drill a hole. I mainly ﬁtted up 
eyeballs and blinks – it wasn’t very 
creative – although I did go on to 
make a few heads and animals. 
I got my best practical tip a couple 
of months ago. I was watching an 
interview from the ’80s with my 
old boss Roger Law. He simply said 
that it’s not the eyes, or the nose, or 
any other features that are the key 
to getting the likeness of someone. 
It’s the overall shape of the head.
Many of your sculptures feature 
nudity, usually in a comic way, and 
your experience of sourcing life-
drawing models on Grindr was a 
particularly memorable anecdote. 
What’s the fascination?
Nudity is something you can get 
away with in art that you can’t in 
everyday life. The only legitimate 
way most people get to stare at live 
naked bodies is a life drawing class.
We’re all nude, but cover it up 
with clothes! Of course I love nudity, 
W 
ilfrid Wood 
doesn’t shy away 
from a bit of 
artistic nudity, 
as the piece on 
the previous page 
attests. “In all 
my glory,” was 
the coy one-line response to our 
request  for a self-portrait image.
His portfolio includes some more 
sexualised curiosities too, that may 
not be to everyone’s taste: Trainer 
Fetish features a teenager playing 
with himself while sniffing one of 
his shoes, and other subjects include 
rent boys, sex dolls and BDSM.
But much of his less risqué work 
is pure caricature – some subjects

other people they follow. You follow 
classy people, you’re shown classy 
stuﬀ. That’s basically it, isn’t it?
Most of Instagram is crap, but 
there’s so much there that if even 
one per cent of it is brilliant, that’s 
enough. I’ve bought art, met people 
and been commissioned from it.
You also quoted Victor Hugo: 
“The ﬂesh is the surface of the 
unknown.” Besides your subjects’ 
appearance, how much attention 
do you pay to personality and 
behaviour in your work?
That quote kind of sums up what 
I’m trying to do. Or it could say, 
‘Does the ﬂesh tell you something 
about the person inside, or can it 
be equally misleading?’ 
How much can you deduce 
by looking at someone? If a mass 
murderer walked past you in the 
street, would you notice? When 
you look at your lover, what are you 
seeing? Presumably it’s not their 
essence; their soul – that’s supposed 
to be intangible. 
Do people end up with the face 
they deserve? Why do we associate 
beauty with truth? I love these types 
of questions. We all love looking at 
people; we are insatiably curious.
Do you have a favourite type of 
caricature, either visually or the 
‘world’ the person occupies, such 
as politics, music or ﬁlm?  
As an artist who does portraits, 
I should be able to tackle anyone. 
Slightly strange faces are the most 
attractive to me, but any face can 
look strange from certain aspects. 
Sports people are great to sculpt: 
they’re usually ﬁt, slightly weird 
and manically focused, which is an 
amusing character trait to portray. 
I think my Michael Phelps is one 
of my best, but only because he’s 
such a brilliant subject.

What’s your usual process when 
creating a new sculpture? 
Getting reference these days is a 
piece of piss: type it into Google. If 
it’s a private individual I’m sculpting, 
I photograph them, then do some 
drawing, sometimes make a rough 
maquette, and go on to make the 
ﬁnished thing from polymer clay. 
I don’t do loads of drawings, a 
lot of the development goes into 
the actual sculpture. One annoying 
thing is when the maquette turns 
out to be more immediate and 
dynamic than the ﬁnished thing. 
I want the ﬁnished thing to look 
fresh, but not slap-dash.
You said in your talk: “When you 
think the world’s run out of ideas, 
there’s always something nutty 
on Instagram.” How do you get 
the most from the platform?
I love Instagram. You follow people 
you like, and it suggests you look at

I can’t tell from your portrait.’ I was 
pleased to have frustrated him.
What was the hardest satirical 
sculpture you’ve worked on?
In general, I ﬁnd women more 
difficult than men. Pretty women 
are particularly tricky because they 
are by deﬁnition somewhat bland 
and symmetrical. Men generally 
have bolder features. 
I also assume that women are 
more sensitive about their looks; 
sexist of me I know. A good female 
friend asked me the other day how 
I know that. It’s a good question. 
I don’t know it: I assume it.
Have you ever had a strong 
negative reaction from a subject? 
I actually get disappointingly little 
feedback from my subjects. I imagine 
famous people would see me as a 
potential pain in the ass, so don’t 
like to comment. 
Sometimes when I draw people 
the model is clearly disappointed.  
Recently I drew a guy with very 
Have you ever been tempted 
to caricature President Trump?
Trump is both too easy and too 
difficult to caricature. What can 
I add? There have been hundreds 
of brilliant cartoons about him. 
To most reasonable people Trump 
is weird. No one needs another 
caricature pointing this out. The 
more some people are lampooned, 
the stronger they get. 
Do you feel any responsibility to 
provide a critical, satirical voice 
on particular issues?
I don’t have a clear feeling for 
politics, and certainly don’t feel 
any responsibility to comment. 
I usually sit on the fence and am 
equally convinced by both sides of 
the argument. To be honest, I hate 
political ranting in any direction. 
My sculptures aren’t direct 
political satire. A while ago I sculpted 
Angela Merkel, just for fun. I gave 
her a broad grin. A friend of mine 
who is very political said, ‘But what 
do you actually think of Merkel?

prominent nostrils. I happen to like 
prominent nostrils, but that’s beside 
the point. I possibly exaggerated 
them a bit. And when he saw the 
drawing he said, ‘The nose is awful.’
 There is often a conﬂict of 
interest between what the artist 
and the sitter are looking for 
in a portrait. The artist wants 
a dramatic, atmospheric or 
characterful drawing. The sitter 
often wants simply to look attractive. 
If I sense a conﬂict looming, then 
I make it clear to the sitter that I am 
not a portraitist who ﬂatters. If they 
want a beautiﬁed representation, 
they should go elsewhere.
Finally, what advice would you give 
to an artist or illustrator looking 
to make a name for themselves in 
satirical drawing or sculpture? 
Who would try and make a name for 
themselves in satirical drawing or 
sculpture? About eight people a year? 
It’s not really a thing to get into, 
is it? I’d probably trot out some cliché 
like, ‘Draw from nature.’

W
hat would you like 
to achieve in 2018? 
To kick-start that 
passion project 
you’ve been dreaming of? Leave 
your full-time job and go freelance? 
Learn a new skill? Publish your 
ﬁrst book? Start your own studio? 
Sell your designs on Etsy? 
We all have a dream, and 
everyone’s is diﬀerent. But perhaps 
the more important question is: 
what are you doing about it? A new 
year is the perfect time to come up 
with a plan, and start actively 
working to achieving it. 
So what’s stopping you? Well, for 
many people, quite a lot actually: 
The mortgage. Self-doubt. Low 
energy. The seeming unavailability 
of hours in a day. The demands of 
children, or parents. Lack of skills 
or experience. Feeling that you’re 
too old, or too young.
But while these are all genuine, 
real-world issues, they shouldn’t be 
the death knell for your ambitions.
Over the next few pages, we’ll 
walk you through some of the most 
common challenges in pursuing 
your dreams, suggest ways to 
overcome them, and hear from 
creatives who’ve done just that. 
CHALLENGE ONE: 
FIND THE TIME 
Let’s deal with the most common 
issue ﬁrst: ﬁnding the time. 
Whenever you want to achieve 
something outside your main 
working hours, the clock always 
seems to be against you. Between 
the office, your commute and daily 
household life, there never seems 
to be a spare minute.
Are things that bad, though? 
Shane Mielke, creative director 
and author of Launch It – a book 
of career advice for creatives – 
suggests your time might not be 
as limited as you think. 
“Take an honest look at your 
day,” he advises. “Find things you 
might be wasting time on that are 
less important than your goal, or 
that you could be doing more 
efficiently. Things like social media, 
video games, commuting and 
inefficient work habits can all suck 
bits of time from our lives. If you 
can free up 30 minutes every day, 
that adds up to 180 plus hours in a 
year. Excuses are just excuses.”
Gavin Strange, who works at 
Aardman in Bristol by day and 
pursues multiple fascinating side 
projects by night, oﬀers an example 
of how that might look in practice. 
“For me, I ﬁnd a routine that I try 
and stick to during the weekdays,” 
he explains. “I ﬁnish work at 6pm 
and then come home, eat dinner 
with my wife, watch a 30-minute 
TV episode (anything longer eats 
into the night too much) and then 
get cracking on ‘round two’, as I call 
it. Sometimes, when things get 
really busy, I get up an hour early 
before work to squeeze in extra 
passion projects, or get cracking 
on my lunch hour.”
That might sound like a tough 
regime, But Strange – whose 
self-published book Do Fly serves 
as a motivational tract for creatives 
– sees it more as a matter of 
creating good habits. “It’s about 
ﬁnding the right pattern for you, 
or adapting how you already work,” 
he explains. “There’s no right or 
wrong way to do it. The hardest 
part is starting, but once you’ve got 
a tiny bit of momentum, it gets 
better and better.”
CHALLENGE TWO:  
FIND THE ENERGY
But what if you do manage to eke 
out some extra hours, only to ﬁnd 
you don’t have sufficient energy to 
use them productively? 
“I think the amount of energy 
you have – or you think you have 
– relates to the amount of passion 
you have invested in your goals,” 
says Ariana DeLuca, a New 
York-based art director. “This is 
why I called my side project The 
Passionate Project (see page 67), 
because making it was like falling 
in love. I was so excited, I had great 
energy, I had butterﬂies. I was 
getting home from work and I was 
staying up till 3am. To get on the 
“I found the initial few months gruelling to 
say the least... but I’m now working more 
ﬂexibly and creatively than I was before”

For some, having a baby might 
be a good reason not to leave 
the ﬁnancial security of a 
full-time job. But for Shefﬁeld-
based illustrator and designer 
Lisa Maltby, it was actually the 
catalyst to do so.
She’d been working at a 
design agency and things had 
been going well, she recalls. 
“But I’m a real ideas and 
creative person, and there 
wasn’t a lot of opportunity to 
push ideas as much as I wanted 
to. I didn’t feel as challenged as 
I did when I ﬁrst began.”
So just a few months after 
having her second child, she 
thought to herself: ‘Life’s too 
short.’ “I think kids make you 
feel like that,” she says. “They 
bring this fresh sense of life, 
where they’re limitless in their 
imaginations, and you kind of 
want some of that too.”
After striking out on her own, 
she hasn’t looked back since. 
“I found the initial few months 
gruelling to say the least, 
working on four hours’ sleep 
and going to meetings with 
baby puke down my back,” 
she says. “But I’ve since gone 
on to have some amazing 
commissions and opportunities, 
and I’m now working more 
ﬂexibly and creatively.”
And that’s important to 
her psychologically as well 
as ﬁnancially. “My creativity 
has always been part of my 
self-expression, as well as 
wanting it to be a career,” she 
stresses. “So it was almost my 
way of survival: that I wasn’t 
just knee-deep in nappies, 
that I had something else.”

  BEST YEAR EVER 
computer and create this, and 
know I was doing something 
I absolutely loved, gave me that 
extra shot of energy.” 
Carolyn Porter, a graphic 
designer from Minnesota, tells a 
similar tale. Her love of old-time 
handwriting propelled her to create 
her own font, which mimicked the 
script of a real-life wartime letter. 
That project subsequently spun 
into a book, Marcel’s Letters: A 
Font And The Search for One 
Man’s Fate, which she based on the 
research she’d done into the letter’s 
original author. “I think if you ﬁnd 
a project that you’re passionate 
about, you just have to be relentless 
and tenacious about bringing that 
project to life,” says Porter. “It may 
not be fast, it’s not going to be easy. 
But it’s ultimately worth it, and you 
just need to be tenacious.”
CHALLENGE THREE: 
LIFE GETTING IN THE WAY
All this can be easier said than 
done, of course, as life has a habit 
of getting in the way. A child or 
family member gets sick. The roof 
starts leaking. You’re handed a 
huge project at work and have to 
work later hours than usual. 
The solution? Accept that life is 
not perfect, sure… but don’t give 
up, and try to ﬁnd new ways to 
hang on to your goals. 
“Sometimes life or other projects 
are more important,” says Mielke. 
“In life, you have to go where the 
ﬁres are at. But that doesn’t mean 
you can’t still play mental tetris 
with, say, the logistics of a side 
project, in those moments of the 
day that don’t have your complete 
attention: when you’re working 
out, in the bathroom, on your 
commute. The organisation and 
planning of a project or goal is the 
foundation and support of the 
physical action of the idea.”
And when things get sticky, 
Strange stresses one key word: 
positivity. “Just approaching 
everything you do with a positive 
mind state can work wonders,” 
he enthuses. “It presents obstacles 
as opportunities, which helps 
immensely when it’s 1.30am and 
you’re not sure if you can succeed. 
You need all these little boosts to 
help you through all of your 
creative endeavours.”
CHALLENGE FOUR: 
FIND THE MONEY
Sometimes, your dreams don’t just 
demand your time and energy; 
they need a bit of seed money too. 
You might need some cash, for 
example, to pay for that course, 
print your own book or magazine, 
or to get you through the ﬁrst few 
months of going freelance. 
The most obvious approach is 
to start watching the pennies and 
save up a nest egg. That’s not  a 
particularly fun prospect, but make 
a few lifestyle sacriﬁces and keep a 
careful eye on your budget, and it 
After ﬁve years working at design 
agencies across Yorkshire, people 
thought Amy Kilner was crazy to 
chuck in her job and go back to 
college. But the 24-year-old from 
Rotherham was adamant. “I’d never 
completed my design degree because 
I got a design job in my second year 
and left uni,” she explains. “But as 
I got older, I realised I needed to go 
back and ﬁnish it.” 
She eventually did so, funding 
herself through a mix of student 
loans and freelancing. And as an 
unexpected byproduct, she ended 
up selling a piece of her student  
work to superstar DJ Fatboy Slim. 
“It was a typography project for 
my course,” Kilner explains. “The brief 
was to create a poster based on song 
lyrics, anything we wanted. I chose the 
words to Eat, Sleep, Rave, Repeat. 
When I’d completed it, I posted it on 
Instagram, tagged it, and didn’t think 
any more about it.”
A few days later, the star’s manager 
emailed to ask if he could buy the 
illustration. Kilner agreed, and then 
the DJ himself emailed, requesting a 
signed copy to display in his home 
alongside artwork by Banksy, 
Chemical X and Jimmy Cauty. “I was 
like, ‘Oh my God, this is not real!’”
It’s one of many successes she’s 
had since returning to education, 
convincing her she’s made the right 
decision. “I haven’t taken the normal 
career route,” she admits, “but it’s got 
me to where I am, and I’m happy.”
“I’d never completed my design degree 
because I got a design job in my second 
year, but I realised I needed to ﬁnish it”

should be achievable. Plus of 
course, if you’re foregoing that nice 
bottle of wine or subscription to 
Sky, it’s only going to help you ﬁnd 
that extra time you need to pursue 
your creative goals.
 But what if you’re impatient 
to get started right now? That 
shouldn’t be a problem, says 
Mielke, it’s just a case of which part 
of your plan you get started on. 
“Google is free, and so research and 
planning costs you nothing other 
than time,” he points out. “So 
switch gears to a part of your plan 
that might be more organisational 
and can be done during free time at 
night or on weekends. For example, 
if you’re wanting to self-publish a 
book about your favourite design 
topic, there’s nothing stopping you 
from researching how to get your 
book on Amazon, or making a list 
of possible printers who might 
print your physical book.”
Of course, saving is not the 
only solution to money issues. 
Alternatively, you could visit the 
bank and see whether they can 
oﬀer you a loan, or equity release 
on your home. If they say no, try 
another bank or building society. 
We’re still in an era of quantitative 
easing, and you might be surprised 
how willing ﬁnancial institutions 
are to lend to anybody with a track 
record of having a regular income 
and good credit score.
Another source of potential 
cash might be crowdfunding. 
Lisa Maltby, a Sheffield-based 
illustrator proﬁled on page 61, 
used Kickstarter to ﬁnance her 
‘disgustingly distinguished recipe 
book’ for children, The Glorious 
Book of Curious Cocktails. She 
managed to raise £5,600, although 
creatives commonly ask for, and 
often get, larger sums. Be warned, 
though: even free money doesn’t 
come for free, and you’ll probably 
have to do a lot of hustling in order 
to meet your target. 
“Running a Kickstarter was like 
having another child; it was quite 
a challenge,” recalls Maltby. “I have 
a wide network of people I’m 
connected with, so I was able to 
push for a few things, pull a few 
strings. But even then it was really 
tricky to get articles about the 
campaign published, to get people 
to share it on social media. You are 
your own campaign, so you’ve got 
to fully drive it all the time. I got 
the funding, which is amazing, but 
this sort of campaign is not to be 
taken lightly. It’s really hard work.”
CHALLENGE FIVE: 
BUILD A STRONG NETWORK
Even if you consider yourself a 
self-starter, the success of your 
creative dream often lies in the 
hands of other people. So having 
a strong network of contacts will 
help enormously, whether you’re 
seeking work as a new freelancer, 
looking for the right partner for a 
collaboration, or searching for a 
mentor as you develop your skills 
in a new creative ﬁeld.
Building up a decent list of 
contacts you can rely on doesn’t 
just happen by accident, though. 
Getting out there and introducing 
yourself to people, both on social 
media and in the real world, 
Rose Waterson may have been a 
talented illustrator, but she wasn’t 
really aware of it. The ﬁne art graduate 
and freelancer lacked conﬁdence in 
her work, and didn’t expect to attract 
clients outside of her hometown of 
Brighton. So it was something of a 
surprise when she got a call from Nike. 
It all stemmed from a logo and 
poster she had designed for a group in 
Brighton called Girls Can’t DJ. “They’d 
posted it on their Instagram account. 
And then later on, they’d done an 
interview with Nike about women in 
the music business,” she says.
When Nike saw Waterson’s work 
on the group’s Instagram, it was a case 
of good timing; the brand had just 
decided to collaborate with seven 
female artists to promote their new 
workout pants line, Nike Pant Studio. 
So the company got in touch and 
commissioned her for the campaign. 
“It was about three days before the 
deadline,” she recalls. “They contacted 
me on a Monday and wanted my 
illustration on a Thursday. It was very 
last minute but I managed to do it 
somehow. The campaign came out 
about a month and a half later; the 
whole thing was quite swift.” 
Working for Nike has raised 
Waterson’s proﬁle and been a big boost 
to her self-conﬁdence, she says; plus 
it’s taught her two main lessons. 
“Firstly, the importance of Instagram. 
I’ve always used it, but I’ve realised the 
power it has now, and the difference 
it can make if you invest in it. And 
secondly, you never know who your 
contacts are going to be. I had no idea 
that this DJ group had any connection 
to Nike, which is a bit mental if you 
think about it.”

at things like creative events 
and meetups, is essential. 
Kate Moorhouse, a graphic 
designer from Manchester, very 
quickly learned the importance 
of networking when she went 
freelance. “I heard about a meetup 
group based in Sheffield and 
Manchester called Freelance Folk 
and popped down to see what it 
was all about,” she explains. 
“I immediately got a friendly 
response from everyone. It felt like 
we were all in the same boat: 
ﬁnding our way, making the same 
mistakes. And it was nice to chat to 
like-minded people from diﬀerent 
industries. Everyone had diﬀerent 
disciplines, but the freelance side 
was common to us all.” 
It wasn’t just a psychological 
boost: the group helped her ﬁnd 
work, too, she adds. “I met the 
founder, Katy Carlisle, at one of her 
Squarespace workshops and she 
asked me to redesign the logo for 
the group. In return, she helped me 
with some Squarespace support. 
Since then, whenever I go to the 
group, I meet someone new who 
I can either work for or work with. 
I’ve also collaborated with other 
freelancers from there, and I feel 
it’s a really natural way for us to 
work together.”
CHALLENGE SIX: 
FIND COLLABORATORS
If your creative dream for 2018 
involves collaboration, then its 
success will live and die on whether 
you choose the right partner. 
Tennessee illustrator Tammy 
Coron, who recently teamed up 
with Apple game developer Chris 
Language to create game design 
resource www.dayoftheindie.com, 
oﬀers some pointers. 
“Finding someone you trust and 
being honest with each other are 
vital,” she says. “One of the reasons 
Chris and I work so well together is 
because we speak our minds: we’re 
honest and open with each other. 
“We also share responsibilities 
and understand situations where 
one of us needs more time to focus 
on something else, without guilt 
from the other. And the best thing 
about our partnership is that we 
encourage and push each other to 
reach just past our abilities, in order 
to level-up our skills.”
CHALLENGE SEVEN: 
PROMOTE YOURSELF
Whether it’s launching a passion 
project or your services as a 
Dutch designer Frank Suyker originally 
set out to be a business leader, but got 
interested in design and video production, 
and ended up “accidentally” becoming an 
art director. Currently working for Orange 
Pearl in the Netherlands, he offers some 
advice for developing your creative career.
EXPECT CURVEBALLS
For those who know their end game, great! 
For those who don’t know (and that’s a 
lot of us), just go with the ﬂow and let life 
surprise you with a curveball. You never 
know where you might end up.
DIVE DEEP
If you’re really interested in a topic, don’t 
hold yourself back from diving deeper. 
Learn everything you can ﬁnd about it. 
And then... forget it (I learned that one 
from the master, James Victore). Only then 
will you have the opportunity to create 
something that comes from the heart.
LEARN FROM OTHERS
There is so much information online. 
On every subject you want to learn more 
about, there is a website, a video, a 
forum. When you hit a wall, there’s always 
someone who’s hit that wall before you 
did, and then shared their experience.
SKILLS AREN’T EVERYTHING
You can apply for jobs even if you don’t 
have all the knowledge. You can learn on 
the job too. A good ﬁt with the culture of 
the company and the strive to go all out is 
much more valuable to employers. 
KEEP LEARNING

  BEST YEAR EVER 
FEBRUARY 2018
In September 2016, Ariana 
DeLuca, an art director based 
in New York, was looking for a 
photographer. “I wanted to reach 
out to someone new, so I put the 
word out,” she recalls. “But I was 
getting a lot of responses from 
men that didn’t sit right. I didn’t 
feel comfortable with anyone 
who responded. And I thought to 
myself: I’d really love to work 
with another female creative, 
who has similar goals and 
ambitions to me. But nothing 
like that existed.”
DeLuca couldn’t think of an 
easy way to ﬁnd new female 
creatives she didn’t already 
know, who were also eager to 
create and connect. “Then I 
thought: this should exist, why 
don’t I just make it?” 
So that’s exactly what she 
did. She got in contact with 
photographer and conceptual 
artist Heather Leigh Cullum 
– who she knew through a 
mutual friend – and in February 
2017, they launched a new group 
for women called The Passionate 
Project. Its mission is to help 
‘female creatives who want to 
collaborate on projects, 
strengthen their portfolios, 
and network.’
DeLuca has done all of this 
outside her full-time agency job, 
but despite the hard work and 
long hours, she’s loved every 
minute. “I think it’s great to take 
a risk and to open up new doors 
and meet people, and just help 
each other out,” she smiles. 
People marvel at her energy 
and constantly ask her ‘How do 
you ﬁnd the time?’, she says. But 
rather than basking in the glory, 
she urges others to follow her 
lead and pursue their own 
passion project. 
“I just tell people: ‘You can 
do the same thing,’” she says. 
“It’s all about working hard, 
ﬁnding the thing you love and 
going forward. I try to be really 
encouraging and tell people to 
go for it. Push through those 
doubts and those fears, grind 
it out, and you’ll get there.”

Shanti Sparrow was working as a 
designer in a little boutique studio 
in Sydney. She enjoyed her job and 
found much of the work fulﬁlling. 
But something was missing, she 
just didn’t know what. So she 
decide to take a year off travelling, 
in order to work out what it was.
She used her savings to rent a 
ﬂat in New York and stayed for six 
months. “When I arrived, I didn’t 
want to get straight into work,” she 
recalls. “I was so exhausted I just 
wanted to absorb New York, have 
some fun and just sleep.” 
Eventually she started doing bits 
of freelancing for her old employer. 
“It worked out really well for their 
timeline,” she notes, “because I 
could do it overnight, they could go 
to sleep and then when they woke 
up, it would be done.”
After half a year in the US, she 
then spent another six months 
going around Europe and Japan, 
visiting 17 countries in total. 
“It was amazing,” she smiles.

  BEST YEAR EVER 
freelancer, promoting yourself 
is key. That means not just 
networking with other creatives, 
but sharing your work more widely, 
on platforms such as Instagram, 
Pinterest, Behance and Dribbble. 
This may sound obvious, but New 
York-based designer and lecturer 
Shanti Sparrow has seen the 
positive eﬀects ﬁrst-hand. 
“I’ve been a designer for nine 
years, but my freelancing outside 
of my main job has actually only 
kicked oﬀ in the last two,” explains 
Sparrow (see left). “It was only 
when I started releasing my work 
onto social media channels that it 
happened. I was started to get 
contacted internationally, whereas 
before it tended to be people I knew 
through people I knew. But now it’s 
anybody who Googled a magazine 
and my thing came up, and they’re 
in China and want me to make 
them something.”
There’s a lot of noise online, 
of course, and just posting stuﬀ 
doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get 
attention, so it pays to get creative. 
For example, Rotherham-based 
designer Amy Kilner (see page 62), 
launched an Instagram feed called 
@thedesignﬁx this year, and it’s 
become a roaring success. 
“The way you get followers on 
Instagram is by getting your work 
featured on other pages,” she 
explains. So she essentially took 
the same idea and reversed it. 
“I launched my own page to help 
other creatives, and it just blew up,” 
she explains. “There are now 
around 40,000 posts on Instagram 
using the hashtag and I’ve got more 
than 18,000 followers on it. I’ve got 
these brand ambassadors 
promoting it, and it’s just growing. 
It’s still a work in progress but I’m 
doing something right.”
CHALLENGE EIGHT: 
ACCEPT IT’S NOT LINEAR
As the saying goes, ‘Man plans, 
God laughs’. In other words: 
whatever scheme you have to boost 
your career and achieve your 
dreams in 2018 may very well go 
astray. But that’s not a reason to 
not bother trying at all, more a 
realisation that you’re going to have 
to stay nimble, accept challenges 
head on and hope to enjoy as much 
of the ride as possible. 
“There’s this assumption that 
when you’re an adult you get 
everything locked down and 
sorted,” says Strange. “No way! 
I think these times are the most 
exciting; you’re more wise to the 
world and can make changes even 
more easily. It’s about being open 
and receptive to change, and eager 
to identify when something isn’t 
working for you and then making 
a change. It’s a never-ending 
process of analysis, assessment 
and action!” 
“I’d always been the mother hen of 
every studio I’d been at, and I loved 
the idea of being in graphic design, but 
without all the deadlines and clients”
S H A N T I S PA R R O W G R A P H I C D ES I G N ER , 
IL LU ST R ATO R A N D L EC T U R ER
“After going to Barcelona and 
Tokyo, I’ll never see colour in the 
same way again.”
On return to Australia, though, 
she still struggled for a time to 
work out why her career wasn’t 
sitting right. Then, ﬁnally, it all 
fell into place, when she saw an 
ad for graphic design mentors at 
Shillington back in New York. 
“I’d always been the mother 
hen of every studio I’d been at, 
I was always training juniors,” she 
explains. “And I loved the idea of 
still being in graphic design, but 
without the deadlines and clients.”
She’s now found the perfect 
work balance, combining a job as a 
lecturer for Shillington with design 
freelancing. And she thinks she’d 
never have got there without the 
perspective gained from travelling. 
“I took that time in New York to 
focus on me,” she explains. “And 
after that, eventually, everything 
started to make sense.”

  JUNIOR DESIGNER MANUAL 
HOW TO FOLLOW 
BRAND GUIDELINES
In the last of our series aimed at junior designers, we examine 
how to interpret and follow clients’ brand guidelines
WORDS: Tom May
 T
he idea of following brand guidelines 
is something that doesn’t get a lot of 
attention on most design courses. “I’ve 
never come across an intern or graduate 
who understands the fundamentals of 
brand guidelines,” says Ellie Pearson, senior 
designer and studio manager at Cambridge-
based agency Mobas. “But it’s not their fault: 
they weren’t told about it, and neither was I.”    
The concept itself, though, is quite simple. 
Clients provide designers with a detailed 
outline of their preferred colours, fonts, logos 
and so on, and how each are to be used. But 
what students are often taken aback by is the 
sheer range of things they cover. 
“I was surprised at ﬁrst by the complexity 
and depth of brand guidelines,” recalls Jess 
Dutton, junior designer at Mobas. “For some 
larger clients, they’re incredibly extensive. 
You think of brands having one or two primary 
colours, but I didn’t know they could have 
secondary colours too.” Dutton was also 
surprised by the distinctions between internal 
and external colours for collateral that will be 
used for staﬀ and for customers. “It’s a lot more 
complex than meets the eye,” she says.
And this complexity means you need to 
spend a lot of time digesting them. “I always 
make sure I’ve gone through the brand 
guidelines from start to ﬁnish, and that I have 
a clear understanding of the look and feel of 
the existing brand, before I start a project,” says 
Joe Bembridge, junior designer at Macclesﬁeld 
design consultancy Brandon. 
Tom Tennant, a motion graphics designer 
at Gramercy Park Studios in London, tells a 
similar tale. “I spend as much time as possible 
studying the guidelines, as it’s really helpful to 
be on the same page as your client,” he says. 
“Even reading the parts that aren’t relevant to 
what you’re doing can give you more insight 
into the brand. After all, it’s there to help.”
STICKING TO THE RULES
Laura Wynn-Owen, junior designer at Nelson 
Bostock Group in London, notes that 
guidelines are usually handed over without 
being talked through, so they can be open to 
your own interpretation. “But in our case, there 
are usually brand teams on hand to answer any 
questions,” she says. “There may also be brand 
sites that give access to assets, guidelines and 
best practice examples.”
As the word ‘guidelines’ suggests, these are 
not immutable rules. But pushing back on 
them should be a last resort, not a default, 
believes Andrius Petravicius, digital designer 
at Hampshire design agency Superrb. “I usually 
wouldn’t push back on brand guidelines, as in 
most cases, you can still be creative and work 
around them,” he reasons. “I’ve done so on 
occasions, though, when I felt like the 
guidelines weren’t working well visually and 
I knew they could be improved upon.”
Karl Doran of Manchester design agency 
Flow Creative concurs. “We did some work 
recently for Arts Council England,” he says. 
“They had a fairly detailed brand guidelines

HOW TO BEND THE RULES
JUNIOR DESIGNER AT BRANDON, JOE BEMBRIDGE, EXPLAINS HOW THE TEAM 
EXPERIMENTED WITH BRANDING GUIDELINES FOR VLERICK BUSINESS SCHOOL
In most cases 
you can still 
be creative and 
work around 
brand guidelines
EXECUTIVE EDUCATION
“Within this series of 
brochures promoting Vlerick 
Business School’s Executive 
Education programme, we 
had to both retain the 
V-pattern but also anchor 
the logotype within it. This 
pushed the boundaries of 
the original identity system 
as the logotype usually sits 
in one of the four corners 
of the page.”
“This is a pocket-sized prospectus 
for potential students at career 
fairs. One of the school’s brand 
drivers is vitality and the use of the 
vibrant coloured V-patterns helped 
us stand out again the competition 
as being something different. The 
logotype is anchored alongside one 
of the V-patterns within one of the 
four corner points. In terms of the 
inside spread, we also locked the 
logotype up in one of the four 
corner points, and used the 
transparency of the V-pattern to 
bleed over the photographic image. 
All told, it’s a very complex 
V-pattern and one that we review 
each year with the school’s internal 
marketing team and all external 
brand partners to ensure there’s as 
much quality control as possible. 
We use a trafﬁc light review 
system to highlight what we ask 
people to avoid doing (red), what 
might be ambiguous and slightly 
breaks a rule (amber; the Executive 
Education piece is one such 
example) and what are great 
examples of brand use for the 
school (green). This really helps 
everyone to understand how to 
best use the identity across ﬂat 
graphics, moving image and event 
experiences. We even used the 
guidelines when we branded a 
Xerox photocopier for the school!”

HOW TO ADAPT TO GUIDANCE
RORY BERRY, JUNIOR DESIGNER AT SUPERRB, OUTLINES HOW VERY 
DIFFERENT GUIDELINES INFLUENCED THREE CLIENT PROJECTS
AMY’S KITCHEN
“The marketing team at 
Amy’s Kitchen were very 
clear about the story they 
wanted tell through the 
website, but the business 
had evolved tremendously 
since the original branding 
was done, so their old 
guidelines weren’t up to 
date. Other than the logo, we 
had pretty much free reign 
on the look and feel, but had 
to keep it true to the ethos 
of the brand. As we were 
nearing the launch, the team 
rolled this new style out 
across their other channels, 
so things were tight.”
AWESOME INC
“In terms of guidance, Awesome 
Inc provided us with a logo and 
a colourway, which we had to 
stick to. As part of the brief they 
also expressed a desire for the 
site to have a fun, animated feel 
to reﬂect their unique style and 
ethos. From there, it was down 
to interpretation. The nature of 
their work is very eclectic so we 
decided to go for a fairly clean 
wrapper to make the most of 
their portfolio. Given that 
they’re an animation studio, 
it was also important to make 
sure the animations on the 
website were really slick, but 
at times, we had to rein it in 
and remember that showcasing 
the work was the priority.”

document, but we did try to push it a bit, 
and bring in some extra tints and colours, plus 
we created a kind of illustrative classic style 
that they’d not really used before. It ﬁtted in 
with their branding but it moved it on a little 
bit, and they were happy with it. If you can do 
that, that’s ideal, although it does obviously 
depend on the client and the brief.”
USING SYSTEMS
Normally, though, your job is simply to 
understand and internalise the brand 
guidelines, as well as work within a reliable 
system to ensure they’re adhered to. Such 
systems will vary from studio to studio, but 
will normally be largely based on common 
sense. “At Moras, we have a huge printed folder 
with details of all brand guidelines that we 
work on in the studio, which is also accessible 
on our server,” explains Dutton. “I go through 
and manually double-check colours, as well 
as doing an InDesign check that shows all 
the typefaces used, so you can easily weed 
out any that shouldn’t be there. Plus, we 
have an internal artworker in the team who 
checks everything against guidelines and 
specs before it’s sent back to the client.”
Adherence to brand guidelines may also be 
integrated into the software itself. “At Superrb 
we use Sketch, which allows us to set up 
reusable colour palettes and typography styles,” 
says Petravicius. “I’ve also been using InVision’s 
Craft plugin for Sketch quite a lot lately; this 
lets you create branding libraries with all brand 
assets, styles and symbols. I’m also really 
excited about a new tool from InVision called 
Design System Manager, which seems like 
a powerful system for creating, managing and 
scaling design libraries.”
The most important thing, adds Pearson, is 
that if there’s something you don’t understand 
– and there probably will be – ask. “Brand 
guidelines can be incredibly technical,” she 
says. “One of our animal health clients has 
a lock up at the bottom of all designs that 
requires a mathematical formula to work out 
the right height and width for the exact 
document you’re working on. A junior or intern 
has little hope of understanding that, so they 
should always seek help if they’re unsure.” 
FIVE TIPS FOR 
BRAND CONSISTENCY
DESIGNERS SHARE FIVE TIPS ON 
FOLLOWING BRAND GUIDELINES
1 
DO YOUR RESEARCH
“Some big brands make their guidelines 
available on issuu.com,” says Jess Dutton, 
junior designer at Mobas. “Look for a brand 
you know and like, and read their style sheet. 
You’ll change your perspective, gain an 
understanding of the design process, and 
realise what goes into creating something.”
2 
STAY CREATIVE
“Don’t let brand guidelines hold you 
back on your creativity,” says Joe Bembridge, 
junior designer at Brandon. “These guides 
are put in place not to limit creativity, but 
to help a brand stay recognisable and 
consistent,” he points out. “But if you do 
go against the guidelines, make sure you 
have a valid reason for doing so.”
3 
MAKE SUGGESTIONS
“If you feel something could be 
improved, suggest that to the client, or even 
make a concept variation to show how a 
brand could look with your improvements,” 
says Andrius Petravicius, digital designer at 
Superrb. “Yet if the client insists you follow 
their guidelines, don’t ignore them.” 
4 
HARNESS SOFTWARE 
“To make sure I follow the guidelines 
carefully, I’ll take a screengrab of the most 
important parts: the colour references, font, 
and point sizes,” says Tom Tennant, motion 
graphics designer at Gramercy Park Studios. 
“I also ﬁnd it helps to copy the brand colours 
into whichever software you’re using so you 
have a palette that’s easily accessible.”   
5 
ASK QUESTIONS
“Raise any questions you have as soon 
as possible, rather than when you’re midway 
through the work,” advises Laura Wynn-
Owen, junior designer at Nelson Bostock 
Group. “If there’s anything you’re unsure 
about, ask. Even senior designers need 
guidance. There are no stupid questions 
when it comes to brand guidelines.”
Brand guidelines 
can be incredibly 
technical, always 
seek help if 
you’re unsure
MEGAMUNDEN
“In terms of developing brand 
guidelines, this project was very 
collaborative. MegaMunden is 
an illustrator, so when he was 
working up logo comps, he 
shared some options early 
on so we could decide which 
would work best for web. It 
was important that the site 
incorporated his signature 
style, therefore we got him to 
illustrate a lot of the incidental 
elements, such as background 
icons, arrows and footer lock 
up. By kicking the brand back 
and forth, we arrived at 
something which felt natural 
to him and that we knew would 
work seamlessly across a wide 
range of media.”

BUILD A SUCCESSFUL 
STUDIO FROM SCRATCH
Despite initially having no clients, cash or business 
experience, the co-founders of Fiasco have built an award- 
winning studio at the heart of Bristol’s creative scene
VIDEO INSIGHT
 S 
even years ago, Ben Steers and 
Jason Smith set up Fiasco in Bristol 
with no design agency experience, 
or much design experience at all to 
speak of, during one of the biggest 
global recessions in living memory – a move 
that peers at the time described as “mental”. 
After three short years, they won a BAFTA. 
Two years later, a D&AD Pencil. Now, through 
sister company thread, they’re also running a 
successful series of design events to bring the 
South West’s creative community together. 
Here, Steers and Smith reveal how they did it...
How did get you Fiasco off the ground?
Jason Smith: I was chefﬁng at one point, taking 
calls in the kitchen to arrange meetings. I was 
working, like, ﬁve jobs. But we had so much 
energy, and loved it. We kept persisting, doing 
collaborative work – for free – that helped us 
grow a circle of friends in Bristol and the South 
West and produce a portfolio, and without it, 
things would have been a hell of a lot harder.
Ben Steers: We really did start from scratch. 
Other co-founders think we’re mental. They’ve 
come from another agency, or have a design 
background, so have a portfolio of clients or 
a certain level of experience.
Neither of us had had a full-time job at a 
design agency. No business experience. We 
didn’t know how to run an agency, or what the 
dynamics, or structure, of a typical agency was. 
But because we were so young and naïve, there 
were no restrictions. I guess that was a strength; 
we went into everything with open arms.
We said ‘yes’ to everything, and worried about 
the rest later. Then slowly started to reﬁne who 
we were as a company, and the type of work we 
wanted to be doing, as well as how we work with 
our clients. That’s taken a long time to do. 
JS: When we started, it was just us running 
accounts, marketing, business development 
and then actually doing the work. Because we 
 
were forced to wear so many hats, we had to 
learn very quickly on the job.
BS: We were in an incubator space to begin 
with, surrounded by other start-ups. Naturally, 
start-ups need branding, as well as all the 
standard business collateral stuff. 
For us, it was perfect – we were getting 
nurtured as a business through this incubator 
[run by the University of the West of England – 
UWE – with a 50 per cent subsidy on rent], but 
also had the opportunity to work with other small 
businesses that needed design services, but 
didn’t have huge budgets. It was an important 
platform for us. Those people put a lot of trust 
and faith in us, not having any experience or 
much of a portfolio to fall back on. 
What was your breakthrough project?
BS: There’s been a few at different stages. 
The ﬁrst was with a production company called 
Somethin’ Else: an online game for Channel 
4, which came off the back of some freelance 
illustration work I’d been doing. 
We were commissioned to create a whole 
set of characters, furniture and environments. 
At the time, Channel 4 knocking on our door 
was a massive deal. It was a landmark moment, 
and the game won a Children’s BAFTA a year 
later. For a company of our size, going into 
our third year of business, it was pretty big.  
JS: It also made us aware of the importance 
of social media. Our ﬁrst conversations with 
Somethin’ Else happened through Twitter. 
BS: In the early days it’s really important to 
get yourself out there. You don’t know whose 
phone is going to get that notiﬁcation or pick 
up on that tweet. We also started working 
with Penguin Random House off the back of a 
tweet: someone within Penguin was looking for 
a design/dev team to help with some sites for 
some of their authors. We saw that, got in touch, 
and heard nothing for months. Then one day 
we got an email asking us to create an website

for a series called Gods and Warriors. Not a 
huge job, but again, an ‘in’ with a really reputable 
brand. Off the back of that, we did the design and 
build for The Snowman and the Snowdog site, 
which led to the Pelican website. 
It was a long, at points arduous, stressful job, 
but we ended up with a beautiful product that 
won a series of awards, including a D&AD pencil. 
JS: We’d just had our ﬁfth birthday. It was great 
going to the awards ceremony; it drummed home 
that every winner is just a fantastic original idea.
What is it about Bristol that excites you both? 
BS: There’s something quite tangible about the 
atmosphere here; something in the air that’s 
quite special. It comes from the industrial history 
that the city has. There’s this DIY ethic, people 
just go out there and make it for themselves.
JS: Summer is like being on holiday every 
day: countless festivals, arts and culture. 
Plus we’ve seen a lot of young companies 
like ourselves grow up in Bristol with us. There’s 
deﬁnitely a sense of community and friendship. 
BS: A few years ago, we set up a series of events 
called thread to champion the local creative 
community, bringing people together for talks 
and workshops in an informal, comfortable way. 
We started in a small bar with about 100 people, 
and now do 220-230 people quarterly. We’ve 
set up a separate sister company to run it. And 
last October we put on a design festival called 
Something Good, with an amazing response.
Where do you recruit talent from?
JS: Our last two recruits are from Manchester 
and London. There seems to be a real movement 
at the moment – due to rising house prices, or 
desire for better quality of life – for people to 
move out of London. Many are coming to Bristol.
We also have open lines of communication 
with the local unis. Our studio manager Marj is 
a UWE graduate, and came on board last March.
According to your website, you only work with 
brands you respect. How do you gauge that? 
BS: For us, it’s more about respecting the people 
within the brand. By no means do we always get 
it right. It’s like interviewing for a job. You don’t 
really know that person until you’re three, six, 
12 months into the job. You have to try and do 
due diligence early on, then give it a go.
JS: Respect and trust are closely intertwined. 
We don’t work for people, we work with them. 
And to collaborate, we need to trust each other. 
BS: It’s like a marriage. If trust isn’t there, things 
start to rock. We bring clients on board from the 
beginning – we don’t just go away, and come 
back with a big ‘ta-da!’ moment. We constantly 
update them, which helps build that trust.

TOM GRANT
Creative
Tom works on a broad 
range of creative projects, 
from branding to web 
design to animation. After 
graduating from Liverpool 
John Moores, he worked 
at various Manchester 
agencies before moving 
to Bristol two years ago.
KEEP YOUR SKILLS FRESH
In our second video, creative Tom Grant reveals 
how the eight-person studio handles such a range 
of multi-disciplinary projects – and how Fiasco 
encourages the whole team to stay sharp.

Above and right: For 
its brand overhaul of 
Bristol cultural hub 
The Tobacco Factory, 
Fiasco was inspired by 
the building’s original 
industrial roots.
1. Create an outlet 
A weekly email with an area named ‘Just for 
fun’ gives the Fiasco team an excuse to 
experiment and learn new skills, says 
creative Tom Grant. “It just gives us a 
small window to go away and learn to do 
something different,” he says. “It makes you 
feel like you’re developing and progressing.”
2. Aim high 
Although Fiasco collaborates with others 
when client work requires skills outside 
the in-house remit, Grant stresses that it’s 
good to push existing team members. “It’s 
always nice to try and get there yourself,” he 
says. “Creating work that’s a little outside 
your comfort zone is the way you improve 
and avoid stagnation.”
3. Get stuck in
Grant has been experimenting with 
animation for the newsletter, and has been 
getting tips from his colleague, who’s “a 
bit of a whizz in After Effects.” However, he 
says, often the best way to get your head 
around a programme is just to get stuck in. 
“Have a play and make a few mistakes and 
ﬁgure out how everything works.”
4. Foster a family culture
“We do weekends away and go out 
for dinner and lunch, everyone gets 
along,” says Grant. “I think it deﬁnitely 
helps just having people that have got 
your back and are willing to push you.” 
This sense of unity encourages the team to 
create. “When you see someone else doing 
a piece of work that you think, ‘Wow, that’s 
amazing,’ you want to do be doing that. It 
keeps you striving to do better.”
5. Set aside time
Recognising that experimentation and 
learning takes time, Fiasco sets aside 
time each week to experiment with new 
programmes. That knowledge can then 
be applied to future projects. “It breaks up 
what we are doing and gives us another 
element to our skill set,” explains Grant.
Nurturing a talented creative 
‘family’ takes time, says Tom 
Grant, creative at Fiasco

NATASHA FIELD 
Account manager
While studying English at 
UWE, Natasha discovered 
a passion for design and 
switched her degree. She 
found a route in via account 
management at a London-
based digital agency, then 
a larger ad agency, before 
moving back to Bristol.
MIX BUSINESS AND PLEASURE
In our third video, account manager Natasha 
Field reveals why a small, friendly studio suits 
her more than a large agency – and how Fiasco’s 
‘family’ vibe translates to client relationships.
WATCH THE VIDEO NOW AT  
www.bit.ly/ca275-ﬁasco
1. Build trust
“I treat every client relationship like 
I would a friendship in terms of good 
communication and trust,” says Natasha 
Field, account manager at Fiasco. “When 
clients trust us and we trust them, it helps 
move the project along.” Plus if something 
does go wrong, it’ll be easier to resolve.
2. Act human 
In the past, Field sometimes felt she 
wasn’t being herself when talking to 
clients. “The way I spoke to them wasn’t 
very human and seemed robotic, and 
I wasn’t building relationships because 
that’s not how you build relationships.” She 
advises remembering that everyone has 
good days and bad days: “If they’re having 
a bad day, you can just be there to talk.”
3. Don’t burn bridges
Fiasco was recently re-hired for a client 
they’d worked for ﬁve years previously, 
suggesting that sometimes you might 
have to wait to bear the fruits of your 
good relationships. “You don’t know when 
a project comes in whether or not that’s 
going to lead to more work,” she says. The 
lesson? Every client is worth investing in. 
4. Be ﬂexible
“Each client is different in the way they 
work, so some need a bit more explanation, 
whereas some just let us run with it and 
won’t need so many face-to-face meetings,” 
says Field. “You have to ﬂexible in how that 
client wants or needs to work.” 
5. Immerse yourself
A good account manager should be an 
extension of the client, and be able to 
pre-empt their feedback, adds Field. “The 
only way to do this is immerse yourself so 
that you understand them – who they, what 
they do and their core values.”

FIND A ROUTE INTO DESIGN
In our fourth video, recent UWE Bristol illustration 
graduate Marj Newnham reveals how she ﬁrst 
got a foot in the door at Fiasco, putting her 
organisation skills to good use to help the studio 
and its sister company thread run smoothly.

Bristol’s ﬁrst major 
design festival, 
Something Good, 
which was reviewed 
in CA issue 273.
1. Don’t underestimate self-promotion
The year before Marj Newnham applied for 
an internship at Fiasco, she sent the studio 
a pop-up rocket Christmas card. She didn’t 
hear anything back, but when she went for 
an interview she was pleased to be able to 
point out her card, still stuck on the wall. 
“It’s always good to send out some feelers, 
because you never know when it’ll come 
back around to help you,” she says.
2. Make yourself indispensable 
Marj left her previous job in the hope that 
her internship would lead onto full-time 
employment. It was a bit of a leap of faith 
she says, but she tried hard to impress 
throughout the internship “so they couldn’t 
let me go,” and her efforts paid off.
3. Find transferable skills
As well as managing the studio, Marj 
is also heavily involved in organising 
Fiasco’s regular series of speaker-led 
events – thread – as well as its annual 
design festival, Something Good, which 
launched in October 2017. 
“At uni, I organised the degree shows 
and ﬁnal exhibition, so I could draw on 
that for experience,” she explains. 
As long as you’ve got a strong idea 
of what you’re trying to achieve, she adds, 
it’s surprising how many of your skills 
will be transferable.

GENUINE GEM
Marian Bantjes 
In 2014, I was contacted to design the cover 
for an annual event in Switzerland called 
BaselWorld, which attracts jewellers and 
high-end watchmakers.
I started with some drawings of patterns 
based on jewels, and then worked them up 
into colour options. They liked these, but 
asked that more watch parts, or reference 
to watches, be used.
One of my favourites used refracting 
gems as a watch face. I later repurposed 
this for a carpet design, without the watch. 
For some reason these were not working 
for them, so I tried again. The intention for 
this was to use foil on a matte background.
Ultimately, none of these were used, 
and they printed a plain black cover with 
a gold band across it. Go ﬁgure.
02 Another of Bantjes’ 
jewellery-inspired 
geometric patterns.
03-04 Bantjes started 
experimenting with 
colour in the patterns.
05-06 As the idea 
developed, more 
explicit references 
to watch components 
were added alongside 
the gemstones, and 
she tried different 
colour combinations.

UNCANNY VALLEY
David Fernández Huerta 
These early sketches for Monument Valley 2  
(www.monumentvalleygame.com) show my 
experiments with giving the game a landscape 
instead of a portrait orientation, as well as adding 
more detail to the architecture than was seen in 
the original game. 
I also played around with the idea of zooming 
in on levels, as opposed to the ‘world on a single 
screen’ framing that we used in the ﬁrst Monument 
Valley. Other sketches include further exploration 
of  non-player characters, as I tried to create the 
feeling of being in a bustling village or town.
My sketchbook for this project is ﬁlled with 
lots of experiments with different character 
designs and styles, including the ‘adult and child’ 
relationship that would later develop into the core 
theme for the entire game.

REBRAND SWIFTLY CANNED
As Michael Johnson recalls, his studio’s logo for the world’s biggest 
type foundry was rolled out, but then promptly rolled back in again
In the very early nineties (1993 I think?), we were asked to design the 
logo for Monotype – cue great excitement – and it was adopted, only 
to be replaced literally within months because of a complete change 
of ownership. At the time, it seemed like the roof had fallen in.

MODERN ART
Michael Johnson 
If my ﬁle dates are correct, we originally proposed 
this idea back in 2003, to an ad agency who had asked 
us for help with an approach to Tate Britain. 
The idea was: ‘Where British art comes to life’. 
We imagined a family returning from a visit, and 
recreating Singer Sargents, drowning Ophelias 
and Richard Longs in their back garden using 
everyday objects, such as toys.
Personally, I always really loved this idea – but 
I suspect it was never even shown to the client.

  VISUALISE A CLASSIC SONG 
DATA IS EVERYWHERE
Valentina D’Eﬁlippo
Interest in how we conceptualise, understand 
and visualise information has fuelled my 
practice. I use data as a raw material from 
which I ﬁnd my perspective and express what 
resonates with me, while hoping that others 
will ﬁnd it compelling, too.
My personal interest in data visualisation 
took off more than 10 years ago, when working 
on my thesis for a postgraduate degree in 
visual communication. By exploring bias in 
gender cues that children receive through 
visual stereotypes, I started to collect and 
visualise data. Since then, I have continued to 
explore the world through data by collecting, 
deconstructing and mapping information. 
Data can be found all around us, in where 
we go, what we consume, touch, read, watch or 
hear. My latest self-initiated project explores 
the application of dataviz techniques to music 
– giving form to what we hear, imagine and feel 
while listening to a song. OddityViz is also a 
tribute to an extraordinary artist, David Bowie. 
DECONSTRUCT THE SONG
David Bowie left us with a constellation of 
intersecting worlds, loaded with material for 
celebration, consideration and interpretation.

became apparent that it was necessary 
to limit the scope and focus to one song.
What would Space Oddity look like turned 
into images or through data visualisation? This is 
what I and data researcher Miriam Quick set out 
to explore in OddityViz. We extracted musical 
data from the track and visualised it in a set of 
10 engraved records, paired with large-scale 
prints and projections that draw from the song’s 
fragmented interstellar world.
Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the song 
differently – by instrumentation, rhythm, 
melody, harmony, lyrics, structure or the 
underlying story. Rather than abstract 
soundscapes, the records become a visual 
system to understand how Bowie masterfully 
crafted Major Tom’s journey. 
TURN AUDIO INTO VISUAL
Our intention was not to create an alternative 
visual score but to make the experience of 
listening to a song more ‘visible’. By breaking 
down its core components and piecing them 
back together, we can end up with a deeper 
understanding of our initial experience. 
We can think of traditional music notation as 
a kind of visualisation: pitch height corresponds 
to vertical height on the stave and the type 
of note describes the tempo. This system 
was created for musicians to perform. As you 
learn how to read it, the language becomes 
meaningful and legible. In a similar way, our 
visual encoding needed clear annotation, 
a key and writing to surface the insights. 
FIND THE RIGHT FORMAT
The range of outcomes – computational 
animations, large-scale posters, engraved 
discs and a window installation – allowed us 
to experiment with how to best encode the 
narrative. It took months of exploration and 
many hours of listening to the song on repeat 
and sketching out ideas. A turning point that 
deﬁned most of the visual language was 
deciding to experiment with a new medium, 
creating sculptural data-objects. 
The vinyl record was an obvious reference. 
From Edison’s phonograph to today’s vinyl 
records, music has been encoded through a 
series of grooves that spiral to the centre of the 
circular disc. Applying a similar logic, I wanted 
the musical data to be engraved. This decision 
forced me to work with no colour, using white on 
black, which also recalls the light of the stars in 
the darkness of space. The format also deﬁned 
the system to encode the data – time around the 
circumference becomes a universal axis that 
allows comparison across visualisations. 
Given the constraints of laser cutting and 
etching on records, a minimal, bold design was 
imperative. Simple geometry and shapes were 
used to encode sounds – evoking the nature 
of each individual instrument – and narrative 
patterns. Ground Control was represented 
by a square – a familiar, safe, angular shape 
that represents a point of stability on Earth – 
while Major Tom was a circle, a more human 
character, who becomes one with the cosmos.
This visual investigation was then brought 
to life with animation, in a freer attempt to 
“Simple shapes 
were used to 
encode sounds 
and narrative 
patterns”

link various aspects of the deconstruction 
to the actual music. Collaborating with Mike 
Brondbjerg, a talented generative artist, we 
created a moving image including a generative 
portrait of Bowie and a series of sequences, 
which Mike coded in processing, and others 
that I animated in After Effects.
MAKE THE VISION HAPPEN
When approaching a new project, I ﬁnd it 
helpful to set out a strong creative direction to 
guide me through the design process and limit 
the decisions I will have to make later on. On 
the other hand, not knowing where I am going 
excites me and I like to allow the subject to 
inform the creative process. 
Moods and inspiration for this project 
included a variety of visual references from 
popular culture to experimental music notation 
resources and the Voyager Golden Records. 
Space Oddity comes with a wealth of visual 
inspiration to draw on from this very interesting 
period in popular culture. 
One of the discs, Trip, references Kubrick’s 
2001 Space Odyssey which was one of the main 
inspirations for this song. This record stands out 
from the rest due to its use of a distinct visual 
language – emoji. Rather than being driven by 
data, it utilises illustration and images that 
loosely code for text and incorporates visual 
metaphors from the movie.
Thanks to the support of Wieden+Kennedy, 
we were able to exhibit the project in London 
to mark the ﬁrst anniversary of Bowie’s death. 
Since then, it has been on the road, with mini

are currently thriving in their 
careers, with and without agents.
Shotopop (represented 
by Bernstein & Andriulli, Valérie 
Oualid and Jacky Winter) tells us 
how working with an agent is all 
about communication…
 
Shotopop: Although we are 
represented by three agencies, 
they each cover very diﬀerent 
regions of the world, so luckily 
there’s no overlap or difficulty. 
We’re always very transparent 
in what we do and who we work 
with; for us it’s all about being 
open and honest.
Our agents are like part of our 
studio. If we didn’t have them, 
we’d need to employ people in 
their place. They complement 
and strengthen us, and we can’t 
fault them. Pros include getting 
awesome projects to work on 
and not having to worry about 
contracts and red tape.
An agent isn’t someone who 
tells us what to do, they represent 
our interests. If you end up with 
an agent that starts giving you 
feedback, or comes between 
you and the client, you should 
reconsider the relationship.
 
Meanwhile, Luisa Rivera 
shares how being unrepresented 
can allow you to be more  
self-sufficient…
LR: Not having an agent has 
allowed me freedom because I 
am more in control of my own 
practice. I have learned a lot in 
the process: how to negotiate, 
manage a project, and create a 
more personal relationship with 
my clients. The cons are practical 
because you end up doing more 
work (that is, more admin).
I try to network and showcase 
myself as much as I can, either via 
email, ﬁnding blogs to feature my 
work or on social media. I show 
ﬁnished illustrations but also 
my process, because that helps 
others to understand my method. 
When I manage my commissions, 
I prioritise projects or clients that 
are meaningful to me. 
Communications have shifted 
in the last ﬁve years, allowing 
illustrators to engage more 
directly with art directors, so 
having an agent nowadays isn’t 
mandatory. It will help if you want 
to focus on the creative side, and 
especially if you decide to work 
within certain industries like 
advertising. However, like in any 
relationship, you should ﬁnd a 
good ﬁt: someone you trust and 
who understands your work.

FEBRUARY 2017
I grew up in a big old house in Yonkers, 
New York. My parents, both artists/
designers, had their studios on the top 
ﬂoor along with their archives, and to my 
endless delight, shelves of magazines. 
They had every issue of Graphis; stacks 
of the beautifully designed Avant Garde 
and Eros; Pogo comics; old Esquire mags 
(with covers photographed by their 
friend Carl Fischer), and of course, the 
New Yorker and New York Magazines. 
I used to spend hours up there, burning 
all of it into my brain, but the real reason 
I returned to the shelves time and time 
again as a kid was for MAD Magazine.
Ah, MAD! My parents had every issue, 
from its debut as a comic book to when 
it switched to the now-classic magazine 
format (issue 24), up to the then-present 
day (1976). I read every issue front to back 
– memorising every word, every drawing, 
every pun, every twisted illustration. 
What made MAD so great? Well, in 
my mind then, as now: everything.
First of all, the logo was incredible: 
three intricate, circus-style letterforms 
ﬁlled with tiny characters drawn by 
Sergio Aragonés running around in 
a bacchanalian frenzy. It was like a 
Hieronymus Bosch inside that logo.
Then there were the covers, featuring 
the inimitable Alfred E. Newman. I soaked 
up every absurd situation he got himself 
into, whether he was impossibly eating 
sweetcorn, or swimming with Bruce, the 
shark from Jaws. And each cover always 
said ‘our price xx¢ cheap,’ even as the price 
went up over the years (I’ve always wanted 
to put that on a proposal).
MAD was full of unforgettable details. 
The masthead listed the contributors as 
‘the usual gang of idiots,’ a phrase I still 
use to this day to describe my friends, 
family and team – much to their chagrin. 
Its movie and television parodies were 
ﬂawlessly punny (favourites included Star 
Blecch, The Putrid Family, and M*I*S*H 
M*O*S*H), and each issue ended with the 
MAD Fold-in: a brilliant illustration drawn 
by Al Jaffee that asked a loaded question 
and, when folded just so, revealed an anti-
establishment jab as an answer.
MAD FOR IT
Emily Oberman – a multi-disciplinary 
designer and partner at Pentagram – 
discusses what her childhood love for MAD 
magazine has taught her about humour, 
silliness and going against the grain. 
MAD was a class-clown masterclass: 
I learned about drawing from Mort Drucker 
(my dad loved Mort’s line work) and about 
absurdist humour from Don Martin. MAD 
showed me the joy of language, as wry 
parody, political nose-thumbing and sheer 
nonsensical gibberish ran rampant on 
every page in equal measure. From sound 
effects like FWAK, SHTOINK, and GLINK 
to the oft-used furshlugginer – a fake 
Yiddish word for something old, battered, 
and junky (as in ‘I better ﬁnish this 
furshlugginer essay on time’) – absolutely 
nothing was off limits.
But the biggest thing that MAD 
magazine gave me, the thing that I carry 
every day, which permeates my life both 
as a designer and as a person, is that it’s 
okay (that it’s great, really) to be funny, 
subversive, outspoken, silly and smart. 
And that you can be all of those things 
at once, if you want. I’m glad I live in a 
MAD world. I’m a better weirdo for it.
