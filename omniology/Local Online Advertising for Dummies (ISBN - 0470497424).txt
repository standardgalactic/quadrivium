Dedication
Court Cunningham: I want to dedicate this book to all small business 
owners, the hardest working people I know.
Stephanie Brown: This book is dedicated to the people and the dogs I 
ignored during the researching and writing of it. (You know who you are.) 
I also dedicate this book to my mother, Helga Olsson, and my stepmother, 
Ruth Brown, whose examples have always taught me to persevere.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Court Cunningham: A large number of people on the Yodle team played 
signifi cant roles in creating this book — not the least of which was Cam 
Lay — who was instrumental in helping to organize the content of this book, 
leveraged his own marketing background to give us another set of eyes for 
each and every chapter, and arduously provided the fi rst round of edits. 
Additional content contributors from Yodle included Joseph Sievers, Michael 
Baker, Arpan Jhaveri, Milind Mehere, and the invaluable John Switzer. Finally, 
I want to thank the Yodle Marketing team members who provided further 
feedback including Kara Silverman, Herman Mallhi, Allyse Coughlin, and 
Alisa Adler — as well as our Senior Director of Marketing, Joel Laffer, who 
encouraged me to do this book in the fi rst place.
Stephanie Brown: It would be a sin not to acknowledge the two people who 
worked tirelessly (and occasionally feverishly) to bring the best out in this 
book: Editorial Assistant David Idema, whose wry humor makes this a fun 
read, and Yodle’s Cam Lay, whose steady support and gentle task-mastering 
got us through. Eat your peas!

Introduction
N
ot long ago, the Internet came along and changed everything. Or at 
least it changed the way a lot of things get done, including how con-
sumers look for and find local businesses.
With the rise of the Internet as the primary way consumers connect with 
local businesses, a huge number of tools and techniques have emerged 
for local businesses to better capture those consumers and turn them into 
customers. Not only do these businesses seem to have done so almost over-
night, but the smartest companies and Web consultants have already tried 
them, refined them, and came up with new ones. In other words, the Internet 
marketing tool kit is big, and getting a whole lot bigger every day.
Understandably, this whole Internet phenomenon can seem pretty complex, 
even intimidating, to local business owners who’ve relied for years on tra-
ditional advertising channels and methods. In reality, all the Web does is 
greatly accelerate the speed that traditional marketing concepts can now be 
applied and responded to by eager customers and prospects.
In Local Online Advertising For Dummies, we look at how local businesses can 
put online marketing to profitable use. We break down the subject into man-
ageable, understandable chunks. By reading this book, you’ll become com-
fortable with the big picture of the online marketing process and with how 
each of its parts contributes to the whole. Most important, you’ll be ready to 
put many of those elements to work for your own business — and to be hap-
pily surprised by the results they bring you.
About This Book
You don’t have to read this book from front to back. Rather, think of it as a 
sort of library from which you can extract and examine only the pieces that 
interest you. You’ll find that (for the most part) the discussions in each 
chapter — and in each section within each chapter — are self-contained.
Of course, we wouldn’t mind at all if you did read everything in order. Local 
online advertising is one of those subjects that has a natural build to it, so 
going with the logical flow isn’t a bad idea. But, hey — it’s your book now, 
and you can read it however you want.

2
Local Online Advertising For Dummies 
In any case, this book isn’t a textbook; it’s a reference, or a guide. This book’s 
purpose is to give you a basic introduction to local online advertising, from 
which you can then go on to more sophisticated sources, if necessary.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use a few conventions throughout this book to make things easier for you:
 
✓ We use italics for emphasis and to set off a particular term that we 
define.
 
✓ We use a computerese font to highlight Web addresses (or URLs), such 
as www.dummies.com.
Also, 99.99 percent of what we talk about in the book applies to both PC and 
Mac users. The very few references made to Microsoft applications aren’t 
exclusionary; Mac users can use versions of the same applications.
What You Don’t Have to Read
Here and there throughout this book, you see sidebars — text boxes that are 
separate from the regular content and feature a gray background. Sidebars 
include information that’s related to the content in the chapter but is also 
independent of it. The bottom line is that you don’t have to read them, and 
your understanding of the chapter’s subject matter won’t suffer if you don’t. 
Then again, if you do read them, you may discover something new. We leave 
the choice up to you.
Another thing you can safely skip without worrying about it is the occasional 
paragraphs with a Technical Stuff icon beside them. Big surprise, this is stuff 
for tech-minded readers. The geekier you are, the more likely you’ll value these 
pieces. The geekier you aren’t, the less likely you’ll care. And that’s just fine.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing a book like this, it’s difficult to know how broad and deep each 
reader’s existing knowledge is. We figure it’s pretty safe to assume that you 
know the rudiments of computer use and that you’ve had some experience 
with the Internet, which also means you’re probably familiar with search 
engines. Beyond those givens, this book assumes that you’re more or less a 
novice when it comes to local online advertising.

3
 Introduction
Of far greater importance, however, is our assumption that as the owner of a 
business, you’re nobody’s fool. Sure, online marketing may be a new concept, 
but we’re sure you have the fundamentals of business down cold. You know 
your market. You know your products and services inside and out. You know 
what kind of customers you sell to and what kinds of prospects you hope to 
turn into customers. And you understand profit and loss, competition, and 
the importance of investing your assets wisely. On all those scores, you’re an 
expert. So we don’t define universal business terms you already know.
How This Book Is Organized
We organized the chapters in this book into five parts. Each chapter is 
broken into sections, which are broken into sub-sections, and even into sub-
sub-sections.
We compiled this book that way so that you can, with very little effort, get as 
much (or as little) information you need at any particular moment. Zip, zop, 
and you’re there. If only the rest of life was so easy.
The following sections briefly describe what the five parts in this book cover.
Part I: Getting Started with 
Local Online Advertising
This part gives you an overall picture of local online advertising: Why it’s 
become such a major tool for local businesses to generate more new and 
repeat customers, the evolution of search engines as they relate to local busi-
nesses, and the kind of pre-planning that the online space requires to be used 
successfully.
Part II: Setting the Foundation for 
Local Online Advertising Success
Here you discover the importance of building a quality Web site for your 
business, including whether you should handle this task or get outside help. 
We also explore the concept of landing pages, the range of interactive tools 
available, and the factors that go into analyzing the results of your online 
marketing efforts.

Local Online Advertising For Dummies 
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part 
of Local Online Advertising
This is really the nuts and bolts of the book. We look, in some detail, at 
search engine advertising and the elements of a successful e-mail campaign. 
You also find out how to employ techniques, such as advertising in banner 
ads, directories, and sponsorships. We also discuss the uses of social media 
(such as Facebook) and how public relations can help drive traffic to your 
Web site.
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers 
Coming Back
Winning over prospects and turning them into paying customers is no easy 
task. After you do it, how do you make them repeat customers? We answer 
that question by examining several ways to keep your business at the top of 
customers’ minds and to reward them for their loyalty. We conclude with a 
discussion of database marketing — that is, how to use the customer data you 
collect to sharpen your online marketing campaigns.
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you’ve read through other parts of the book before coming to the Part 
of Tens, you’ll have been exposed to a lot of information. In this part, we 
provide you with lists of ten do’s and don’ts. This part makes for a handy 
resource that you can refer to quickly whenever the need arises.
Icons Used in This Book
At times in the course of this book, we separate certain points to broaden 
your understanding of a particular subject by placing an icon next to that 
paragraph.
 
Occasionally we give you a little hard-won, real-world insight into how to 
apply the tool or technique we’re discussing. Consider each of these icons as 
a sort of “If we were you, we’d . . .” piece of advice.

5
 Introduction
 
This icon is a friendly reminder of a specific point that we want to make sure 
you keep in mind as you proceed in your reading.
 
Take heed of a Warning: This can prevent you from doing something that 
could get you into trouble (primarily, legal trouble).
 
For those who like to delve into every technical detail, Technical Stuff icons 
may be of interest. For the rest, they’re eminently skippable.
Where to Go from Here
You’re ready to use this book, and the Table of Contents or index is the best 
place to start. Find the section or topic that interests you and jump right to 
that page. Or just turn the page and start with Chapter 1. We leave the deci-
sion up to you. Either way, we hope you enjoy — and profit by — what you 
find in this book.

C
all us stuffy old traditionalists, but we think the best 
place to begin is always at the beginning. To get 
started, Chapter 1 provides an overview of the online 
marketing world as it currently exists, including things like 
search engine marketing, identifying your best prospective 
customers, planning how best to reach and motivate them, 
and the importance of measuring your results.
Chapter 2 gets a bit more specific about the tools (and 
advertising venues) that the Web makes available to you. 
Chapter 3 talks about the importance of formulating an 
online advertising plan that makes sense for your business 
and then dives into choosing the kind of strategies that 
help you bring that plan to life.

B
ack in the 1920s and ’30s, Willie Sutton robbed a lot of banks. When 
asked why, he responded, “Because that’s where the money is.” Sutton 
may have been a criminal, but it’s hard to argue with his logic. Which brings 
us to the 21st century, and you, your customers, and why you should adver-
tise your business online — because that’s where the customers are.
In this chapter, we give you some background on the online world and 
explain some of the general forces that fuel it. In the succeeding chapters, we 
break down what you as a small business owner need to know about Internet 
marketing in general and about local online advertising in particular.
Understanding Online Consumer Trends
More and more consumers spend more and more time online, and the num-
bers of households that are online has steadily increased.
But more important is how much consumers are online and how they’ve 
adopted Internet usage as part of their daily routine much faster than anyone 
could have predicted. For instance:

10
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Ninety-four million American adults use the Internet every day (that’s 
nearly one-third of the total U.S. population).
 
✓ Sixty-three percent of those folks access search sites every day.
 
✓ Sixty-four percent of Americans use Internet search as the primary way 
they search for local businesses.
Given these numbers, the conclusion is fairly obvious: If someone is search-
ing around the ’Net for local goods and services and your business isn’t 
represented there, that customer is going to click with someone else. That 
customer could have been and should have been yours.
With Internet transactions generating so much business, you probably 
assume that small business owners (and local businesses) all over America 
are already all over the ’Net. But guess what? They’re not . . . yet.
 
The U.S. Small Business Administration reports that of the 24 million small 
companies it keeps tabs on, only 44 percent are currently using Web pages to 
advertise their goods and services. (And when you remove the top ten or so 
metropolitan markets, that percentage of current small-business Web advertis-
ers drops like a rock.) Bottom line: A whole lot of room is left for a savvy small 
business owner like you to make your business’s presence felt on the Web.
So what can explain this rather odd situation in which customers are hanging 
out someplace that small business advertisers aren’t? Undoubtedly, one huge 
reason is that to most people, the idea Internet marketing seems just too 
complicated. Intimidating, even. Best left to the experts, whoever they may 
be. We’re the first to admit that Internet marketing can be a pretty complex 
undertaking. The ’Net has its own rules, its own customs and secrets, and 
above all, its own technology. And the latter changes constantly.
What does local really mean?
Oddly enough, defining local as in local busi-
ness isn’t all that easy. For instance, that fast-
food franchise just down the road may be 
affiliated with a multi-national corporation, but 
at the same time, it’s a long-established part 
of the town’s business community, so is it local 
or not?
We’d say yes. For our purposes, the definition 
we use throughout this book is that a business 
is local if
 ✓ It does the lion’s share of its business either 
on its own premises or at a customer’s 
home, office, showroom, plant, and so on.
 ✓ When it uses online tools and techniques, it 
uses them to generate offline sales.
Some pretty obvious examples are contractors; 
professional service providers such as accoun-
tants, attorneys, architects (plus others that don’t 
begin with an A); local retailers; and many more.

11
 Chapter 1: Online: It’s Where Your Customers Are
But, as with any big and complex subject, the secret to understanding the 
Internet — and finding out how to put it to work for your business — is a 
matter of breaking it into smaller, manageable, digestible chunks. And sud-
denly, Internet marketing isn’t all that complicated anymore.
The Rise of the Search Engine
Before any sane businesspeople go to the time, trouble, and expense of 
establishing a Web site for their companies, the logical question they ask is: 
Just exactly who’s going to find it, and how will they get there?
The answer is largely the search engine. Although search engine sounds very 
mechanical, it’s actually just a pathway that customers can follow to find 
your business’s Web site. Essentially, the offline Yellow Pages is a search 
engine. So is the local newspaper’s Classifieds section. As opposed to those 
resources, which help customers sift through a few dozen or so choices, 
Internet search engines nearly instantly navigate through the millions of busi-
nesses that maintain Web sites.
How search engines actually find and index Web sites is pretty complex, and 
we save the technical details for Chapters 7 and 8. But here’s a hint: Search 
engines use things like spiders and crawlers (and maybe one or two things 
that go bump in the night).
Google, the big kahuna of search engines
Of the major search engines operating, Google (www.google.com) is by 
far the largest, with Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), and Bing (www.bing.com) 
coming in second and third.
We discuss these and other search engine providers in greater detail 
throughout this book. All you really need to know right now is that Google 
didn’t grab its enormous share of the market just because it has a funny, 
catchy name. Over the last decade or so, Google has been the biggest innova-
tor in the search engine space, and today it continues to pretty much define 
the category by setting the standards and making the rules that the competi-
tion then has to adopt in order to stay in the game. Proving, once again, that 
it’s good to be the king.

12
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
Customers use search engines to find you
Millions of companies throughout the United States, both large and small, 
do at least some of their business on the Web. A search engine is what keeps 
finding any one company from becoming a needle-in-a-haystack proposition. 
In fact, search engines make successfully finding any one of them pretty 
darned easy. (Just ask your kids.)
 
The crucial bottom line is this: According to data for 2008 compiled by the Pew 
Research Center, 85 percent of Web site visits (or hits) originated through one 
search engine or another. That’s how completely indispensable search engines 
are for any business that wants to have a profitable presence on the Internet.
Local Search: The Latest Search Frontier
Perhaps you’re thinking, “I run a small, local business. Search engines are 
for big companies that get business from all over. I’ll never get found stuck 
somewhere in the middle of all those folks.”
Search engines are important to your business because the hottest area on 
the Web is local search. Local search is pretty much exactly what it sounds 
like: local people looking for local goods and services. Of course, local people 
have always been looking for local goods and services. What’s changed is 
how they search. That is, on the Web. The defining characteristic of local 
search is that the people who use it have local intent.
That probably sounds pretty broad, and it is. Local search is broad because 
customers with local intent can use search engines in various ways to find 
what they’re after:
 
✓ They can search for, say, roofer — and because the more sophisticated 
engines instantly identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the com-
puter the searcher is using, some local roofer listings may well appear 
on the results list.
 
 Google Maps is a leader in this technique, which you notice when you 
type a search term and a local map appears with a bunch of local busi-
nesses listed beside it.
 
✓ They can use geographical identifiers, such as dermatologists davenport IA, 
and they’ll get (surprise) listings of dermatologists in Davenport, Iowa.
 
✓ They can shorthand the process by typing the business descriptor fol-
lowed by a zip code, such as plumbers 46256. Local search still works.
In any case, the key development here is that the major search engines, such 
as Google and Yahoo!, realized very quickly that local search was becoming 

13
 Chapter 1: Online: It’s Where Your Customers Are
the Next Big Thing — an enormous untapped market for their services, 
spread over the 15 million local businesses that operate across America. So 
these search engines are very busy expanding their capability to render local-
market search results and adding to the ways those businesses can quickly 
and efficiently get themselves listed — and found — online.
The result of all this has been what people with MBAs call a positive feedback 
loop (see Figure 1-1). People go on the Internet and look for local businesses. 
Early on, they find a few. Then, local business owners and search engine 
programmers realize that local people are looking for local businesses on 
the ’Net. So more and more businesses start putting themselves there, and 
search engines provide more local listings. And so on, and so on.
Another factor that’s driving local search is the increasing popularity of 
smart phones and PDAs that give you Internet access in the palm of your 
hand. People tend to use these amazing gizmos a lot when they’re out and 
about, so it’s only natural that they use their phones to find the nearest res-
taurant, antique store, or shoe repair shop. With local search, you can easily 
do just that.

Big demand + Tiny supply = Pay dirt
Before diving into local search, the Googles, Yahoo!s, and Bings of the world 
took a look at the sort of numbers that follow and drew the logical conclu-
sion, that is, that small business is potentially huge business. Consider the 
following:
 
✓ In 2008, 82 percent of consumers used search engines to find local ser-
vices (up from 74 percent in 2007). That translates to 1.3 billion local 
searches every month.
 
✓ Sixty-four percent go to the Internet as their primary means of finding 
a local merchant. But only 26 percent of local small businesses have 
invested any time or effort in advertising online.
 
✓ Americans consume 35 percent of their media (news, entertainment, and 
so on) online, but only 7 percent of total national ad dollars are spent 
online.
What we see here then is the tremendous opportunity gap that exists, though 
it can hardly be counted on to stay like this forever. That’s why thinking 
about and establishing your online presence now is a very good thing. (And 
of course, so was picking up this book.) In fact, a number of new search 
engine options have popped up to cater specifically to local businesses, 
which only expands the gap between the number of marketing venues and 
the number marketers who have so far taken the plunge.
Take a site like www.hotels.com. Yes, Hotels.com is a national site, but it 
depends on local hotel/motel/bed and breakfast/quaint, country-inn owners 
to provide it with content, which it then showcases on its site. Fandango 
(www.fandango.com) does roughly the same thing with local movie theaters 
across the country. Per usual, a bunch of other dot coms use this very effec-
tive business model.
Thinking local: It’s only natural
People living in Toledo don’t look for a plumber in Cleveland. They’re look-
ing for a local plumber who can get there in a hurry to fix whatever’s leaking, 
clogged, or making funny noises.
 
And what local-searching customers everywhere know — and that a whole lot 
of small businesses don’t seem yet to fully grasp — is that the Internet is likely 
to give them much more information about a local company than any other 
resource. Even a full-page ad in the local Yellow Pages or newspaper would 
find it difficult to hold all the information about a local business that a Web 
site can.

15
 Chapter 1: Online: It’s Where Your Customers Are
Further, ask yourself this: With traditional print advertising, how can you 
tell how many people have seen your ad, much less acted on it as a result? 
Answer: You can’t. But with a Web site (or for that matter, an online adver-
tising or e-mail campaign), you can find out exactly how many people have 
seen it and contacted you because of it. That means you can quantify exactly 
how much you’re spending to get each customer who calls you — and can 
keep refining your site to make it even more efficient as often as you want (as 
opposed to a phonebook listing that sits unchangeably frozen for a year).
 
A third of all search engine queries contain a zip code or a city or state name, 
such as taxidermists 43112 or florists Spokane. Perhaps more important, how-
ever, and regardless of whether a customer tacks on a zip code or a city or 
state name, 43 percent of search engine users are looking for a local business 
from whom to buy offline (that is, at the business’s physical location).
Lest you think that those numbers don’t necessarily add up to much at the 
end of the day, consider this: In one recent month alone, Google reported 
11,345 searches (or as Web savvy folks like to say, impressions) for various 
searches related to veterinarians in San Jose. So either Northern California is 
in the grip of a major hairball epidemic, or local people in general are search-
ing for small businesses in a big, big way.
Don’t let your competition take your customers
If your competition maintains a marketing pres-
ence online and you don’t, it probably means 
one of two things:
 ✓ You don’t know they’re online.
 ✓ You know but don’t particularly care.
If you don’t know whether they’re online, that’s 
easy to find out. Use a search engine (just like 
their customers do — nudge, nudge) and see 
what your competitors are up to. But if you do 
know you have competitors on the Internet but 
haven’t done anything about it, we’re going to 
go out on a limb here and guess that that means 
one of two things:
 ✓ You think this whole Internet thing is just a 
passing fad.
 ✓ You want to get into Web marketing, but 
don’t have the time or expertise.
You can’t think the first one because if you’ve 
read anything in this chapter so far, you realize 
that the sheer volume of Web usage is stagger-
ing. So we’re up against the time and expertise 
obstacles. As we mention in the Introduction, 
you can do a number of things on your own to 
create a Web presence that doesn’t cost an 
arm and a leg or require any particular com-
puter expertise. And as we also mention, many 
outside consultants and companies create Web 
sites and online advertising campaigns for busi-
nesses large and small, and can do it not only 
expertly but at surprisingly little expense.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
We’ve made a number of distinctions so far between local search and the con-
ventional Yellow Pages. But there is one important respect in which they are 
very similar: Customers use them at the moment of relevance. For example, 
you don’t look through the Yellow Pages for lawn care companies until you 
actually need a lawn care company. The same goes for local online search. 
Simply put, the moment of relevance comes about when need meets need-
fulfillment. And at that critical, highly sales-message-receptive moment, a 
potential customer can use all the information about you she can get to make 
you her source or supplier of choice. This is precisely the kind of persuasive, 
in-depth information that only a Web site can give.
Methods You Can Use to Advertise 
Online and Their Benefits
In this chapter, we take a look only at the proverbial tip of the local-online-
advertising iceberg. Even so, you probably already realize that success 
requires the use of a variety of tools and tactics used in combination.
Here are a few of them:
 
✓ Pay-per-click (PPC) online advertising, which is a way to enhance 
how your business appears in search engine listings and to give you an 
instantaneous read on your listing’s effectiveness.
 
✓ Search engine optimization (SEO), which involves adjusting and design-
ing your Web site to make it more search engine friendly and increase 
your position in the organic section of the search engines.
 
✓ Company landing pages — pages that people come to directly when 
they do a search using particular keywords and then click the link 
posted from the search engine. The landing page takes them straight 
to the information specified by the keywords they’ve used to find you, 
without making them navigate to that information through your home 
page, which they might find too complicated to pursue.
 
✓ E-mail blasts that let recipients download, say, a coupon and thereby 
helps you start a relationship with them.
 
✓ Social networking sites like Facebook that can be used to generate 
interest in your business.
 
This may all sound a little intimidating at this early stage, but take heart. None of 
the tools and tactics are all that complicated by themselves. The real trick — or 
art, if you want to get fancy about it — is deciding how to combine them to 
create the most effective (and cost-effective) advertising campaign for your 
business.

17
 Chapter 1: Online: It’s Where Your Customers Are
 
Despite what may at the moment seem like a lot of work on your end, try 
always to keep this in mind: Unlike many forms of traditional advertising meth-
ods, online advertising is completely measurable in real (or near-real) time. 
That means you can find out almost instantly how well your efforts work, 
which parts perform better than others, what kind of customers you attract, 
and what specifically about your advertising catches their attention. Best of 
all, because your online advertising is something you can alter on virtually a 
moment’s notice, you can change, refine, or otherwise tinker with it as soon as 
your measurements tell you what to do more of and what to leave behind.
Going beyond search engines
Earlier in this chapter, we mention the three biggest and best-known search 
engines operating: Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. Any (or all) of them can be a 
really cost-effective way to advertise locally and bring customers to your 
business who are looking actively for the kind of products and services 
you offer.
Although your online efforts may well begin with the big three search 
engines, the marketing opportunities provided by the Internet certainly don’t 
end there. In fact, those other opportunities are vast. For instance, a lot of 
smaller, more localized search engines operate on the same principles as the 
three biggies but can offer greater efficiencies for your business. And you can 
use non-search ways to reach potential customers, too. We touch on e-mail 
(Chapter 10) and social-media marketing (Chapter 13), but you may also want 
to explore the use of banner advertising (Chapter 12), online PR opportuni-
ties (Chapter 14), industry-specific directories (Chapter 11), and so on.
 
Each of these possible tactics has its own nuances and strengths, and you’re 
probably best off trying a variety of them to see which ones generate the best 
results for your company.
Targeting the right prospects
Any business worth its salt has a lot of potential customers, but those poten-
tial customers aren’t all created equal. What you want to find are those pros-
pects who are the most motivated and ready to act, the most financially able 
to buy what you’re selling, and the most likely to become long-term custom-
ers. And one of the great things about having lots of online options is that 
they let you directly zero in on the cream of the crop.

18
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
With search engines, you can narrow your advertising efforts to specific zip 
codes, towns, or cities or to location-specific key phrases (such as people 
living near the strip mine). Banner advertising lets you put your name and 
message on other people’s sites, sites that tend to attract the same kinds of 
customers you want to reach, demographically, by topic of interest, or by 
some other criterion important to you. And those are just a couple options. If 
you read on, match the profiles of your target prospects to the marketing tac-
tics we discuss and see which promises to provide the best fit for your needs.
Turning clicks into new customers
Regardless of how you attract prospects to your Web site — via search, 
e-mail, banner ads, and so on — the real trick is getting them to take action 
when they’re there. As the tacky expression goes, you’re after engagement, 
not just eyeballs!
For a local business, turning clicks into customers means using the online 
medium to close an offline sale. Maybe your site lets them schedule a mas-
sage with an online form, request a construction quote via a Live Chat fea-
ture, or contact your limo service right from the Web page with a special 
tracking phone number. The possibilities are pretty much endless.
You discover everything you need to know to qualify prospects and convert 
them into customers in the chapters that follow.
Taking an active role in optimizing results
In the days before online advertising, you had basically two ways to mea-
sure the effectiveness of the medium you were using: anecdotally or by pure 
hunch. Hardly scientific, to say the least. But online advertising lets you 
optimize your results. You can measure how many people are coming from 
where, and what it is that’s tickling their fancy or leaving it woefully untick-
led. And then you can do something about it, now!
Maybe you want to change a keyword or phrase, use different colors, put the 
elements on your site in a different order, or replace the picture of grandma 
with your dog Buster looking playful. Whatever. The point is that you can 
fine-tune your message (and your medium) until the cows come home — and 
see exactly which changes most benefit your return on investment (ROI).
Whether you do this or have outside professional help, optimizing results 
means taking a much more active role in your advertising than ever before. 
And being better and more quickly rewarded for it, too.

M
any years ago, a wise, old marketer lamented, “I know that half my 
advertising dollars are wasted — I just don’t know which half.”
And that was true enough then because major advertising media, such as 
newspaper, TV, and radio, were very hard to track. You just couldn’t know 
who was reading, watching, or listening, or what sort of immediate effect 
your ads had. You had to wait for sales figures to roll in, and even those usu-
ally didn’t tell much about what in your ads moved the sales needle.
Although technology has made tracking mass-media advertising somewhat 
easier and more precise — and although those media are still essential for 
many national brands — they remain something of a gray area as far as 
assessing their actual, immediate effects.
Enter online advertising, which offers local businesses — and an increasing 
number of national ones — an extremely cost-efficient, trackable, and tweak-
able way to reach customers. The variety of communication techniques (or 
tactics) available to an online advertiser means a local business can try sev-
eral tactical combinations and quickly determine which one works best.
This chapter gives you an overview of the pros, cons, and unique character-
istics of each of these online tactics so that you can put together an online 
advertising plan that will generate the biggest bang for your buck. We explore 
many of the subjects here in greater detail later in this book, but this chapter 
is a great starting point.

As you read over the options, think about which ones are most likely to reach 
and persuade your current customers as well as help you to recruit a grow-
ing bunch of new ones.
Getting Your Business Found 
Where People Are Looking
Advertising makes sense only in media outlets in which your customers are 
both present and engaged. That may sound obvious, but often, this truism is 
forgotten in the whirl of doing business.
A classic example is the Yellow Pages. People who break out the phone book 
and thumb to the Yellow Pages category they’re interested in are certainly 
present and engaged. They’re on a specific mission, such as looking for the 
nearest bowling alley. Today’s Internet Yellow Pages (IYP) play the same role 
that their paper counterparts always have — and, not surprisingly, they’re 
doing so somewhat at the expense of the paper version, as shown in Figure 2-1.
 
Figure 2-1: 
The use 
of paper

Pages has

in propor-
tion to the

Search engines represent another place where people go to find exactly what 
they’re after. (They search for bowling alleys as opposed to stuff to do.) This 
is exactly why pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is so widely used today. And 
search engine optimization (SEO) efforts accomplish much of the same thing.

21
 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
However, online advertising also contains an important exception to the Be 
Exactly Where They’re Looking for You rule. You can think of that rule as the 
Be Exactly Where They Don’t Think They’re Looking for You, But Actually 
Kind of Are. To explain, we have to back up a step.
The online world is packed with market niches. Blogs deal with just about 
any subject or issue you can imagine. And with other social media, such as 
Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, and Twitter, people hang out with folks who 
are just like them in terms of their interests.
People who frequent social media aren’t consciously looking for business 
advertising. In fact, one of the joys of social media for many individuals is 
probably the expectation that they won’t be exposed to advertising there.
But more and more, they’re mistaken because savvy marketers have found 
subtle ways to sell themselves and their wares where people socialize online. 
Doing this right is tricky, but it’s very possible and online advertisers are get-
ting pretty darned good at it.
In a rather lumpy nutshell is where things stand: Online advertising is good 
at reaching audiences that are specifically interested in finding what you 
have to sell (via search engines, IYP, and the like) and audiences that simply 
stumble across you (via Facebook and YouTube, for instance) where they’re 
not expecting to find advertising but are nevertheless susceptible to learning 
about businesses like yours.
In other words, online advertising presents an extremely broad variety of 
venues, tactics, and tools that marketers can use to build business.
That said, we look more closely at the direct channel that leveraging search 
engines represents.
Leveraging search engines for success
As we emphasize in Chapter 1, people use search engines now more than 
ever before to find local businesses. So, as a local business, your first — and 
most important — step is to make sure you can be found there.
The Big Three in the search engine world are Google, Yahoo!, and most 
recently, Bing (formerly MSN Search). Because they’ve all recognized the 
huge potential that local searches hold, they’ve poured a lot of resources 
into local search features and capabilities. On such goal is to integrate local 
search results into their regular search engine pages, which is excellent news 
for you.

22
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
Here are three basic ways to market your business through a search engine:
 
✓ Organically
 
✓ With local listings
 
✓ Via pay-per-click
Figure 2-2 shows a typical search results page. (Note that the organic listings 
would appear below the local listings, and so aren’t shown in the figure.)
Keywords (the word or phrase you enter in a search engine) play a major role 
in all three search engine options. Quite simply, no search occurs until some-
one enters something into the engine’s Search field — and that “something” 
is the keywords or phrases that people use to find you, no matter which 
approach you use to make your site appear on the results pages.
Each method of promoting your business with search engines has advan-
tages and disadvantages — and you discover a lot more about them through-
out this book. For the moment, suffice it to say that there isn’t just one 
answer, so using multiple approaches is usually the best option; that includes 
two — or even all three — of these online tools.

 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
Getting found organically
Organic listings (as in unpaid search engine results) are the most common 
kind of search engine results that people encounter online. Why the most 
common? Because each Web site that shows up in organic listings is found 
automatically by the search engine based on the keywords that appear on 
the site.
Search engines, such as Google, create their organic listings automatically by 
using programs — dubbed crawlers or spiders (which we refer to as simply 
spiders throughout this book for clarity) — to search the Web. (Spider? Web? 
How clever those search engine people are, eh?) Then you search through 
what the spiders have found.
Spider-based search engines consist of three primary elements:
 
✓ Spider: The spider visits a Web page, reads it, and then follows links to 
other pages within the site, which is why people refer to the site as spi-
dered or crawled. The spider then returns to the site on a regular basis, 
such as every month or two, to look for further changes.
 
✓ Index: Everything the spider finds goes into the second part of the index 
(or catalog), which is like an unbelievably huge book that contains a 
copy of every Web page the spider finds. If a Web page changes, the 
index updates with new information.
 
 Time is a factor: It can sometimes take a while before new pages or 
changes that the spider finds are added to the index. Thus, a Web page 
may have been spidered, but not yet indexed. And until the Web page is 
added, people can’t find it on that the search engine.
 
✓ Search engine software: The program sifts through the millions of pages 
recorded in the index to find matches to a search and then ranks them 
in order of what it believes to be the most relevant.
How do spider-based search engines determine relevance when confronted 
with hundreds of millions of Web pages to sort through? They follow a set 
of rules built into a computer program, which computer geeks would call an 
algorithm. This is sort of the black-box part of the search because exactly 
how a particular search engine’s algorithm works is a closely kept trade 
secret. However, all the major search engines’ algorithms focus on two basic 
criteria: location and frequency — particularly the location and frequency of 
keywords on a given Web page:
 
✓ Location: Web pages that have a search term(s) at or near the top of the 
page, such as in the headline or in the first few paragraphs of body text, 
are assumed as highly relevant to the topic at hand and give the Web 
site an advantage in how it’s ultimately listed relative to competing sites. 
Search engines assume that any truly relevant page will mention key-
words right at the beginning, which is usually a pretty safe assumption.

24
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Frequency: A search engine analyzes how often keywords appear in 
relation to other words on a Web page. Those with a higher frequency 
of keywords are usually deemed more relevant than Web pages with 
a lower frequency of those keywords, and they’re thus treated more 
kindly in the listing hierarchy.
What if you change your Web site in some way? The search engines will even-
tually find these changes, but what you’ve changed — your page titles, body 
copy, or other elements — can affect how your site is then listed.
Using local search listings
To better capture local search traffic, the large search engines have created 
special areas to cater to the local searcher. Two examples are Google Maps 
(http://maps.google.com) and Yahoo! Local (http://local.yahoo.
com). And the best thing is that with most of these sites, at least some level 
of local listings are free. All you need to do is upload basic information about 
your business to the search engine’s computers and then your site appears 
within organic search results. Simply go to Google’s Local Business Center 
(http://google.com/localbusinesscenter) or the Basic Listing sec-
tion of Yahoo! (http://listings.local.yahoo.com/basic.php).
Google, Yahoo!, and Bing feature these local listings next to a handy local 
map that has pins or flags sticking out of it. The letter or number on the pin 
that represents your site corresponds to the letter or number attached to 
your Web site address in the results list. In the case of Google, click that map 
and you’re served up even more local listings, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
Getting listed locally isn’t always as easy as you might think; it can actually get 
downright frustrating. Why? Because the number of local businesses that want 
to be found via local search is expanding like crazy, and search engine provid-
ers are overwhelmed by the demand. So getting where you want to be often 
takes longer than you want. And there simply isn’t much you can do about it 
but be patient.
 
Although always subject to change, the local search arms of the major search 
engines are
 
✓ Google Maps: http://maps.google.com
 
✓ Yahoo! Local: http://local.yahoo.com
 
✓ Bing Maps: http://www.bing.com/maps
 
✓ AOL Local Search: http://localsearch.aol.com

Running pay-per-click ads
Pay-per-click (PPC) is simply search engine advertising, and it requires that 
you pay to get your ad into a high-visibility position. With most search 
engines, that ad position is at the top of the first page of search results 
and/or alongside them. You’ve almost certainly seen PPC ads when you’ve 
searched, and maybe you’ve wondered: How come those folks get such a 
prominent, almost impossible-to-miss spot? Answer: Because they pay for it.
Putting the pay-to-play aspect aside, however, here are two good reasons to 
use PPC ads:
 
✓ They’re upfront and personal. Because people using search engines 
are primed and ready to find a business like yours, you can’t do better 
than to put yourself (or really, your Web address) right in front of them. 
Buying PPC space means your ad has a better chance of not getting 
buried on some later page where only the most curious searcher will see 
your listing.
 
 When weighing the option of using a PPC ad, keep in mind that several 
studies show just how impatient search engine users really are. As a 
general rule, searchers don’t go deeper into the listings than the first 
half of the first page! So if your listing appears on a page much deeper 
than that, you’re in search engine Siberia.

26
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
 As a result of showing up in a highly visible spot in the listing results, 
PPC ads (unsurprisingly) are extremely effective at generating qualified 
clicks — which, of course, is the whole idea.
 
✓ You get what you pay for. Before you run away shrieking at the thought 
of laying out money for a search engine ad, consider one very important 
fact: Done correctly, PPC ads can be extremely cost-effective because 
you pay only when someone actually clicks your ad and thus becomes 
a legitimate prospect. And producing legitimate prospects is exactly 
your goal.
 
 Another PPC benefit is that it tells you on a nearly real-time basis how 
many clicks you’re getting, and that, in turn, lets you do a little seat-of-
the-pants market research. Does one version of your PPC ad generate 
more clicks in a day (or week or month) than another version? Will yet 
another version do even better? You can find out easily and then take 
that lesson to the proverbial bank.
 
 Unlike organic searches (which leave you at the mercy of spiders and 
your keyword strategy), PPC is eminently controllable and even kind of 
scientific. If you want to be the first rank for a certain keyword, you usu-
ally can (if even just for one day) so that you can test it, but you have to 
pay top dollar for the privilege. Then you can take the ad down the very 
next day and use whatever knowledge that experiment gave you.
We explore all the PPC nooks and crannies in Chapter 9. But for now, we 
describe the basic concepts so you can start thinking about whether PPC is 
something your business might find beneficial.
First, with all major search engines, the actual cost-per-click (CPC) is based 
on an auction market. This simply means that the more a business is willing 
to pay for a click, the higher its ad will appear in the search engine’s paid list-
ings section — and consequently, it’s likely to get more clicks.
The net result of all this is that the CPC for a local business can run from a 
few cents to several dollars. And how fast and to what extent those individual 
expenditures add up is largely the result of decisions you make.
That said, you need to be aware of the basic PPC mechanics:
 
✓ Develop a keyword portfolio: Decide which search terms you want to 
use to trigger the appearance of your ad in the search results. (Note: 
The capitalization of search terms doesn’t matter.) If you’re a dentist in 
New York City, you might settle on terms like dentist in manhattan, teeth 
cleaning in midtown, and dental office nyc open saturdays (assuming, of 
course, that you are open on Saturdays).

27
 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
 
✓ Write ad copy: When people type one of your keywords, your PPC ad 
shows up, but it needs to contain more than just your Web address if PPC 
is going to be a worthwhile investment. Use this ad copy space to say 
something of interest about your business. The available space here is 
limited, so your copy can’t be very long — and therein lies the challenge.
 
✓ Decide whether to use campaign options: Most search engines offer all 
sorts of nifty add-ons to help you target the right people. For instance, 
you may want to target people who search for dental office nyc (potential 
patients) but not those who search for dental office jobs nyc (potential 
employees). (Again, the capitalization of search terms doesn’t matter.) 
You can also target a certain radius around a particular zip code, and 
that’s just for starters. The search engine you want to use can give you a 
full list of the campaign options it offers.
 
✓ Bid and budget: As we mention earlier, PPC ads are usually auction-
based, so you have to bid the amount you’re potentially willing to pay 
for each click, which is your max bid. Note: The max bid isn’t how much 
you necessarily will pay (your final, accepted cost-per-click will often 
be much lower), it just represents your personal ceiling — and it gets 
the process started. For example, say the most that a competitor is will-
ing to pay for a click on a particular keyword is $1 whereas your max 
bid is $2. You get the top spot for $1.01 per click (not $2 per click). In 
essence, your max bid simply gets you into the game. When you have 
your CPC nailed down, search engines also usually let you determine the 
maximum amount you want to spend per day — which is really handy if 
you’re on a strict budget.
 
✓ Get it live: This is the most exciting — and commonly the scariest — 
part of PPC. After you get your ad together and your CPC nailed down, 
it only takes a mouse click to make your ad go live. That’s right: One 
teensy little click, and you’re out there for the whole world to see. The 
immediacy that’s baked into today’s technology may give you a split 
second’s worth of yikes just before you go public. But then you’re done. 
For now.
 
✓ Measure, learn, optimize, repeat: This book has one recurring theme: 
Always test what you’ve done to figure out the best way to market and 
advertise your business. All the preconceptions, opinions, and inten-
tions you might have are liable to get blown to pieces when they come 
up against real, hard data. You have to prepare for that — and to be 
willing to accept what the data tells you. Maybe a keyword you thought 
would be a surefire traffic-builder turns out to be a total dud. Maybe 
you’re getting a fair number of clicks, but not getting any business. Don’t 
worry, this happens to even the savviest marketers. Even if your cam-
paign’s working great and bringing in leads hand-over-fist, you always 
have room for improvement. And one of the best, most immediate ways 
on the whole wide Internet to sharpen your marketing skills is to step 
into the PPC advertising arena.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
In case you’re worried that those CPCs could soon start adding up to serious 
money, keep the following in mind: You decide how many keywords you bid 
on, what your maximum bid is for each keyword, and how much you spend 
per day. Additionally, whatever money you do spend may replace what you 
may already be spending on far less efficient and effective advertising vehicles 
(like say, newspaper ads) because the cost of each click by a motivated poten-
tial customer represents a possible sale. And the size of that sale will often 
dwarf the few pennies (or even dollars) you’ve spent to attract that customer.
 
Similar to the rules that apply to choosing what sites to serve up to searchers 
for particular keywords and phrases for an organic search, search engines 
running PPC ads insist that those keywords and phrases are legitimately and 
thoroughly relevant to your landing page or Web site content. If they’re not, 
search engine employees won’t come to your house and flog you — they’ll just 
refuse for all eternity to run your ad.
And that, dear reader, is pay-per-click (at least for the moment). We know it 
may sound terrifyingly complicated just now, but you can console yourself 
with the fact that hundreds of thousands of local businesses use PPC every 
day without anyone’s head (or budget) exploding.
Understanding the Quality Score
Although the way the search engines order 
their PPC ads is technically the result of an auc-
tion system, it isn’t just a simple Top Spot Goes 
to the Top Bidder system. For instance, if you’re 
a plumber in St. Paul and (for some strange 
reason) want to show up when people search 
for tattoo parlors in Los Angeles, you probably 
aren’t going to show up on top — or anywhere 
else, for that matter — regardless of how much 
money you’re willing to shell out.
Why? Because the ad doesn’t agree with the 
search terms. Google calls this the Quality 
Score. The Quality Score gets thrown into 
the mix with an advertiser’s PPC bid, and out 
comes that person’s ad position. Don’t even try 
to figure it out. But do know the following two 
things:
 ✓ Search engines want to make (lots and lots) 
of money.
 ✓ Search engines want to give their search-
ers meaningful, relevant results (which will 
wind up making them even more money).
Those two things being the case, pretend you’re 
the hypothetical plumber and your search 
engine listing popped up in front of people 
looking to get a little ink on their arms in L.A. 
Nobody’s going to click your ad because, well, 
you’re a plumber. And if you don’t get clicks, the 
search engines aren’t going to make money — 
and as far as they’re concerned, that’s a low 
Quality Score.

Seeing how you look in Yellow
That trusty old standby, the printed Yellow Pages, has been around for over 
100 years, but time marches on. And the recent advent of the Internet has 
convinced the good people who publish the Yellow Pages that their business 
model has a lot to gain by embracing the Web.
Enter the Internet Yellow Pages (IYP). Today’s IYP include www.yellow.com, 
www.yellowpages.com, www.superpages.com, www.dexknows.com, 
and many other online counterparts to the printed phone books. Figure 2-4 
shows a typical IYP listing, and Figure 2-5 correlates the IYP with its paper 
counterparts.
 
Figure 2-4:

IYP enjoy reasonably high user volumes (though individually they still lag far 
behind Google from a market-share perspective). And it’s worth noting that 
a good deal of IYP’s traffic actually comes from organic searches on Google 
and other search engines, not just from customers navigating directly to the 
IYP Web address.
The good news about IYP is that the most basic listings are usually free. That 
being said, larger, premium listings are definitely not free and vary dramati-
cally in cost, depending on the market you’re in. Moreover, the usability side 
of IYP has some pretty heavy-duty bad news too . . .

Many IYPs are flat and static, which makes them seem kind of dusty com-
pared to the vibrant search engine world they compete with. IYP are orga-
nized by category and return results in alphabetical listing and based on 
whether you’ve purchased a premium listing. Some IYP, such as Yellowpages.
com, are moving toward an auction-based system that returns results based 
on relevance and price, which makes them stronger competitors to the 
search engines over time.
The price is right — where to claim 
free IYP and directory listings
Many IYP and Internet directories provide at 
least some basic listing free of charge. Here 
are some links where you can claim those free

 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
So should you advertise on the IYP? Absolutely. As we said, basic listings are 
often free, and you can potentially get equally qualified traffic, usually for a 
lower price than you get on the search engines. The hassle is that with so 
many of them, organizing a media buy across four or five IYPs and setting up 
your listings is time-consuming. If you do decide to go the IYP route, it may 
make sense to find out which IYPs serve your geographic area and have the 
most traffic for your type of business. The general rule is that the top IYP for 
a given area is almost always the one associated with the local phone com-
pany’s printed book.
Getting listed on directories
Although roughly similar to IYPs, local directories are indigenous to the 
online environment and are often richer in content than IYPs. The content of 
local directories usually consists of a local business’s name, phone number, 
hours of operation, ongoing promotions, and so on. Yelp, Citysearch, and 
other local online directories are particularly powerful for lifestyle-type busi-
nesses, such as salons, restaurants, and spas (see Figure 2-6). They may often 
include value-added information as well, such as user ratings and reviews. In 
a sense, directories can be considered mini-search engines, but without the 
same algorithm and screening process that search engines apply.

Directory advertising can, should, and often will be a superb lead generator. 
The only fly in the ointment is that you’ll find yourself going head to head 
with dozens of your local competitors.
This isn’t necessarily a big drawback because the really nifty thing about 
directories is that you can choose from so many different kinds, representing 
virtually all the different ways that people look for local businesses. Still, you 
obviously have to put your best foot (and face) forward, competitively speak-
ing, if you’re going to attract the best prospective customers.
Here are some of the best-known names in directory advertising:
 
✓ Online lifestyle guides: Augment their localized listings with things 
like maps and customer reviews; many also offer a share feature to add 
value to their sites. Some examples are:
 
• Citysearch: http://citysearch.com
 
• Yelp: www.yelp.com
 
• MerchantCircle: www.merchantcircle.com
 
• Insider Pages: www.insiderpages.com
 
• Business.com: www.business.com
 
• Local.com: www.local.com
 
✓ Online classified ads: For products and services ranging from electron-
ics to pet sitting to plumbing to legal services. Check out the following, 
which is a busy, busy place:
 
• Craiglist: www.craigslist.org
 
✓ Local listings by area: One such example is Oodle, which pulls together 
and organizes millions of local listings from all over the Web and then 
presents them by area:
 
• Oodle: www.oodle.com
 
✓ Vertical directories: Feature information about a specific type of prod-
uct, service, or business keyed to local markets. Check out the following 
examples:
 
• Hotels.com: www.hotels.com
 
• BookFinder.com: www.bookfinder.com
 
• Florists.com: www.florists.com
 
✓ Local media online: Local newspaper, radio, and TV sites typically host 
directories offering free listings to local businesses.
 
• The local NBC affiliate in (Dallas/Fort Worth): www.nbcdfw.com
 
• Wild 94.9, a radio station in San Francisco: www.wild949.com

 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
In short, directories are loaded with potential for driving people to your Web 
site, and thus to your local business. They really do deserve some serious 
checking out.
Lead aggregators
Lead aggregators generate qualified leads — either by phone or via the 
Web — for local businesses by grouping those businesses into user-friendly 
categories that consumers use to find the products and services they’re 
after. In a sense, they create one-site shopping. One popular example is 
ServiceMagic, which is a lead aggregator focused on providing homeowners 
with listings of contractors — from plumbers and painters to cabinet makers 
and cleaning services, as shown in Figure 2-7. After finding out about the con-
sumer’s need, the lead are then sent to multiple contractors.

As with just about everything else having to do with online advertising, lead 
aggregators have pros and cons that you need to consider before deciding to 
list your business with them:
 
✓ Pros: Because a local business pays only when it actually gets a lead, 
you don’t risk paying for non-results. Aggregators can work really well 
for some categories but not so wonderfully for others; their strength is 
in finding companies that do simple, home-based jobs, such as a lock-
smith or an electrician.

34
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Cons: A given lead can be passed to multiple merchants at the same 
time, creating a race among merchants to get to that consumer before 
anyone else does (survival of the fastest). Consequently, a consumer 
may get overwhelmed with calls from lead-receiving merchants and get 
annoyed with the whole process.
Driving Direct Navigation Traffic
Direct navigation comes about in three ways:
 
✓ A customer types your business Web site URL directly into the address 
bar in the browser.
 
✓ A customer clicks a link on a listing, profile, or another business site and 
is taken to your site.
 
✓ A customer clicks a link in a promotional e-mail.
Look for affinity Web sites to share links — an affinity site has a logical con-
nection to your site due to a common interest. So, if you own a plumbing 
business, you might want to look for a site maintained by a local building 
contractor and ask to have your Web address included in that Web site con-
tent. People do this all the time.
Other sites to consider partnering up with include
 
✓ Trade associations
 
✓ The Better Business Bureau (BBB)
 
✓ Your local Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau
 
✓ Local newspapers that run local business directories
You can use each of these options to help create visibility for your business 
by joining them, getting listed on them, advertising on them, supplying key 
content to them, or creating some other sort of natural connection. Properly 
selected, the sites you partner with will provide a good way to steer targeted 
traffic to your Web site and build your brand awareness in the community.
You can also put a link to your Web site in promotional e-mails that you send 
to existing and potential customers. Using e-mail is a pretty broad subject, 
which we cover in Chapter 10. For now, just be aware that e-mail campaigns 
can generate a lot of Web site traffic at very little (if any) cost.

Going viral with blogs
Viral advertising — word of mouth that spreads through the Internet — is 
cheap, easy to implement, and can be highly effective.
Those blogs that you hear so much about are the key viral vehicle for local 
businesses. (A blog, short for Web log, is a Web page made up of posts, 
shown in chronological order. Readers of the blog can post comments, which 
the original poster or other can reply to.) As an advertiser, you can use blogs 
in one of two ways:
 
✓ Add a business blog to your Web site to share your company’s exper-
tise, build additional Web traffic, and connect with potential customers. 
A business blog can also improve your search engine rankings (more on 
that later).
 
✓ Start posting to blogs or even ask a particular blog administrator to 
occasionally mention you in his blog. In either case, present yourself as 
an expert in your field — and don’t forget to include a link to your site.
 
Use blogs only if your target audience uses them and then use only those 
blogs that are relevant to you both. Don’t get carried away and promote your-
self on a blog that focuses on nothing to do with your business. You won’t just 
come off looking silly, you’ll likely be branded a shameless marketer, or worse, 
an Internot (or leper) — and find yourself ostracized.
Using social networks
Another mode of viral advertising is social networking. Ever hear of 
Facebook, MySpace, or Twitter? Of course you have.
A decade or so ago, the big thing in business was to participate in network-
ing events. A bunch of professionals would get together someplace to make 
small talk, eat shrimp, and forge connections with each other — connections 
they’d presumably capitalize on down the road. Well, social networking on 
the Internet is based on the same idea, except it isn’t just about business, and 
you can do it in front of a computer while wearing your pajamas.
Despite the overall social nature of social networks, more and more busi-
nesses are discovering that these networks are great places to find out what 
people think and thereby capture the mood of the market, so to speak. And a 
lot of these networkers like to give their personal reviews and ratings of what 
other people are selling or otherwise making available — a few good reviews 
can be worth a few dozen ads.

36
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
Small wonder then that businesses are increasingly looking at social net-
works as a good place to demonstrate their expertise, engage existing cus-
tomers on a personal level, and drive qualified leads to their Web sites.
The big social networks are Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, 
LinkedIn, and Friendster. Figure 2-8 shows an example of the Yodle busi-
ness’s Facebook page. You can reach customers through Facebook in the 
following ways:
 
✓ You can advertise on Facebook and target your audience by demograph-
ics, interests, and lifestyles.
 
✓ You can create your own Facebook page where you offer and share busi-
ness information. Or you can advertise an event and then invite your 
fellow Facebookers to attend.
 
✓ You can put a link on your Web site that takes visitors to your Facebook 
page to read more about the nice, down-to-earth person behind the 
business.

 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
Using other free media vehicles
Free media sites like YouTube and Flickr make viral marketing campaigns 
extremely easy to implement for any business, including local ones. For 
example, you can:
 
✓ Participate in chat rooms and on message boards, both of which are 
good ways to spread the word subtly that you and your business are 
worth knowing. Prime spots for this sort of thing are:
 
• Google Groups: http://groups.google.com
 
• About.com: www.about.com
 
• Yahoo! Groups: http://groups.yahoo.com
 
• Open Directory Project (dmoz): www.dmoz.org
 
✓ Put your TV commercial on YouTube (www.youtube.com) — and 
maybe only on YouTube and not on TV at all — and prominently feature 
your Web address somewhere in it.
 
✓ Host a photo gallery of your latest work. A stone masonry company, for 
example, could post pictures of its latest patio or decorative stonewall 
installation on Flickr (www.flickr.com), maybe accompanied by a How 
To discussion board.
 
✓ Add a Forward to a Friend feature in your e-mail promotions.
 
These all create opportunities to position yourself (and your business) as the 
local expert, and at the very least, begin to increase online awareness.
Twitter — home of the tweets
Twitter currently occupies a social network 
niche all its own. (Though probably not for long 
with copycats out there.) Twitter is essentially 
an online message site that covers a million 
topics, based on the simple question: “What are 
you doing now?” Twitter is also a bit of a word 
game because each message (or tweet) can 
be no more than 140 characters long (including 
spaces!). An example might be: Doing pastel 
drawing of a lighthouse on rocky coast. May get 
framed, give to Dad, born Maine, turning sixty. A 
good idea? Just tacky? Opine. It’s both harder 
than it looks and lots of fun.
Local businesses are finding a comfortable spot 
among tweeters (those posting messages). To

Going from Offline to Online: 
A Lesson in Cross-Pollination
Although your overall marketing effort may lean heavily on online advertis-
ing to create momentum and growth for your business, don’t do so at the 
expense of a fully rounded effort. The fact is that offline advertising tactics 
can be integrated quite smoothly with online tactics to extend your advertis-
ing investment. Here are some examples of how this kind of cross-pollination 
can work:
 
✓ Direct mail can be enhanced with online offer fulfillment. In other 
words, the mail that shows up at a consumer’s home provides your Web 
address as where to go to receive a special discount (or whatever it is 
you’re offering). This can be an extremely powerful marketing combina-
tion for use with existing customers.
 
✓ The knowledge you gain from using pay-per-click advertising — ads 
that generate the most interest in your products or services — can be 
applied to your offline marketing and make it less a case of hit-or-miss 
than one of hit-and-hit.
 
✓ Networking offline can help you move people into an online network that 
you have a continuing presence on.
The number of ways you can get offline efforts to stimulate online activity 
is pretty much unlimited. And it’s a strategy that no clever local business 
should ignore.
Using Facebook in the real world
Check out the “Social Media Marketing 
Case Study: Using Facebook to Promote a 
Professional Photography Business” article 
at The Caffeinated Blog for a good example 
of how one business harnessed the energy of 
Facebook to boost his local business. You can

a-professional-photography-
business.html
What makes this particular example so interest-
ing is that the business owner became socially 
entwined with his potential customers by using 
Facebook, and his repeated exchanges with 
them gave him a serious leg up on his local 
competitors. And that’s just smart marketing.

 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
Getting Seen with Banner Advertising
A Web banner, or banner ad, is simply a form of display advertising that you 
place on someone else’s Web page. This type of ad is meant to attract traffic 
to the advertiser’s Web site and offers a link to take people there.
Banner ads are usually either wide and short, or tall and narrow. That’s why 
they’re called banners. And they’re usually placed on pages that have inter-
esting content, whether informational or editorial.
Because they’re traditionally more about establishing a brand than about gen-
erating a direct response, banner ads can be a particularly powerful tool for 
attracting new customers to local businesses that offer high-value products or 
services. Car dealerships, law firms, and medical offices looking to build aware-
ness and/or relationships (rather than just constructing a sales funnel) are 
prime examples. The theory is that if you spend enough time creating a very 
positive image for a brand, the mega-sale will follow sooner or later.
On a local level, consider placing banner ads on the local newspaper’s Web 
site (in the Entertainment or Business section, for instance) and on other affin-
ity sites. One example: A bicycle shop places a banner ad on the local cycling 
clubs’ Web sites and on the sports pages of the local community sites.
Moving Out with Mobile Advertising
Mobile ads are messages formatted to appear on company Web sites that 
provide mobile services, such as cellphones and PDAs (Personal Digital 
Assistants), or ads that can show up directly on someone’s iPhone or smart-
phone as either text or image ads. As a local business, you’re interested pri-
marily in the direct-to-device option.
Mobile search — and consequently, mobile advertising — came to be 
because search engine providers and mobile network service providers 
(Verizon, T-Mobile, and so on) realized that people running around with 
their cellphones and PDAs wanted to do local searches. (Say your car went 
phlooey on the road; you want to use your cellphone to find a local tow 
truck.) Mobile searches were a no-brainer.
In the industry, mobile search is more formally referred to as searching with 
local intent — and it’s become obvious that mobile device users are just bris-
tling with that intent.

40
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
Say a cellphone or PDA user launches a local search on Google (or one of the 
other search engines). Among the things that will pop up are ads, such as the 
ones we discuss earlier in this chapter in the “Running pay-per-click ads” sec-
tion. But here, the super-important key fact is that the searchers are out and 
about, right now. Odds are, at this very moment, they’re searching for some-
thing with immediate local relevance to them (like the aforementioned tow 
truck). Otherwise, they wouldn’t be searching at all.
This means that the sales trigger is just waiting to be pulled — and smart 
local business find a way to capitalize on that immediacy. Some offer ads 
that, when clicked, notify the mobile user of a special, limited-time sale, a 
free giveaway, or the option of being connected directly to your business 
phone — which can all happen immediately.
Movie reviews, maps, menus, store locations, and hours of operation are per-
fect items to put just one simple click away on millions of mobile phones. A 
great case in point: Someone searching for Thai restaurants sees your mobile 
ad, clicks to find out your location and read your menu, and then gets con-
nected directly to your take-out number. How cool (not to mention, profit-
able) is that?
Earlier in this chapter, we discuss how traditional pay-per-click advertising 
can be a relatively cost-effective sort of expense, and mobile PPC is largely 
the same in those regards. And if you decide to go the click-to-call-your-
business-right-now route, you use something known as pay-per-call. You 
don’t bid against anyone; you just pay a few dollars for each call that some-
one makes to your location through your mobile ad.
Here’s a biggie, though: Most major search engines let you do the same sort 
of geo-targeted mobile ads that you can do with your primary online search 
engine ads. Plus Google Mobile, Yahoo! Mobile, and Bing Mobile can help you 
seamlessly extend your desktop-targeted campaign to local mobile users.
As you might expect, lots of new and simple resources have sprung up in the 
mobile marketplace to help put your business front and center with consum-
ers on the go. These include
 
✓ Bango: http://bango.com
 
✓ mobileStorm: www.mobilestorm.com
 
✓ Mobile Visions: www.mobilemarketing.net
 
Local businesses that can benefit most from mobile search include restau-
rants, laundromats, movie theaters, florists, taxicab companies, salons, lock-
smiths, and similar businesses.

 Chapter 2: Engaging Your Advertising Arsenal
Mixing and Matching Your Methods
Unless you have scads of time on your hands — and what local business 
owner does? — you’re going to have to pick and choose among the possible 
online advertising techniques available. But nowhere is it written that you 
can use only one. You may be best served to slip two, three, or more arrows 
into your online quiver — the better to leave no prospective customer 
unreached. Test them and see. If two of the three methods are producing rea-
sonable results and the third is a flop, swap it out and try a fourth.
Before you make any decisions about which online advertising routes to 
follow, you have to get the current, competitive lay of the land. And that’s 
best done by conducting your own research.
Your starting point is to determine who your online competitors are. To do 
this, get online and punch in the keywords and phrases that reflect the goods 
and/or services that your business offers. You may be surprised to see what 
comes up. You may be even more surprised to see what doesn’t. (You’ll be 
very happy to discover that one of your major competitors hasn’t put her 
business online.)
Also try to identify which sites of any (respectable) kind target the same 
sort of buyers that you want to reach. Then, backtrack to see just what their 
online efforts consist of. This not only gives you some insights into the kinds 
of things that your target consumers respond to, but it also gives you a list of 
sites where they congregate — and with whom you might be able to link up 
to promote your business.
In a similar vein, check out your competitors’ sites to see whose links they 
provide on their sites. Is one of your fellow local florists including a link to 
Flowerworld Magazine on his site? (There’s really no such magazine.) Then 
contact FM to see whether you can get a link on its site if you put its link on 
yours. The lesson here is that everyone is looking for ways to cross-sell, and 
the number of possible, tactical ways to do that is almost unlimited.
Finally . . . surf’s up! Go online and surf local sites, directories, and social net-
works. Find out what advertisers in all categories are doing — and even take 
note of which tactics make you want to act. You might just be surprised.
After you determine that you want to use online advertising tools A, B, and C, 
don’t forget to track the results of each to the extent you can. Does changing 
A make it a little more effective? Why do you suppose B is outperforming C? 
You’d considered putting tool D to work, and maybe now’s the time, and so 
on. One of the great things about online advertising is that it makes this kind of 
mixing, matching, and adjusting so easy. And ultimately, you will find the right 
marketing mix . . . the happy one that you can ride all the way to the bank.

Planning Your Online 
Advertising Campaign
In This Chapter
▶ Coming up with a solid advertising plan
▶ Deciding how to position your business
▶ Establishing your goals and expectations
▶ Adopting the right strategies
▶ Designing your time and action plan
▶ Establishing your budget
▶ Figuring out your return on investment
W
hat does effective local advertising take, first and foremost? One 
word: Planning.
And why could that pose a problem for you? Because local business owners 
tend to be doers, not methodical analysts and strategists. Analyzing and 
strategizing tend to not be in the average independent go-getter’s genes. But 
you can become those things — at least in the advertising arena — and, as 
we demonstrate in this chapter, you’ll find it isn’t all that hard to do.
At bottom, planning requires asking the right questions before you start run-
ning any kind of advertising, whether online or offline. And planning will save 
you a lot of headaches, false starts, and wasted effort and resources down 
the line. Plus, planning will reward you with what you’re ultimately after — 
more customers and more sales.
Planning also requires banishment of one all-too-common impulse, namely, 
bouncing from one marketing idea of the week to another in hopes that the 
law of averages will eventually produce a silver bullet. That approach just 
doesn’t work. Worse, that approach promises nothing but confusion for you 
and your customers while wearing you down (and out) in a hurry. This chap-
ter helps you resist the temptation to resort to that kind of reflexive spur-of-
the-momentness and instead to start applying some good old, tried-and-true 
strategic discipline.

44
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
The payoff is that you will come up with a solid advertising plan. And that 
plan will be more than smart and effective enough to last you a long time.
Making a Pact to Plan
Your first step toward building an effective advertising effort is to figure out 
exactly who the audience for your product or service really is. Decide what 
sort of customers your product or service appeals to, what benefits of the 
product or service will move those people to act, and what’s the best way to 
communicate those benefits to those same folks.
The answers to those questions lead to your company’s unique selling propo-
sition (USP): The factor or consideration presented by a seller as the reason 
that one product or service is different from and better than that of the com-
petition. When you have that, you’re well on your way.
After you have your USP, you need to understand just how your customers 
buy your product or service. That may sound like an odd step, but it really 
isn’t — and your answer will help you determine how best to reach them 
(that is, which online tactics to use) and to move them (that is, what actions 
you want them to take as a result of your advertising).
The fact is how people buy varies by the kind of business you’re in. For 
example:
 
✓ If you own a local pizzeria, you probably aren’t too concerned with the 
quality of the leads you generate; you just want as many people as pos-
sible to come in for a slice. Recognizing that, you may want to consider an 
online advertising mix that includes listings on Yelp and Citysearch. Here 
customers can post reviews and ratings, and you can post directions to 
your location and a mobile ad campaign that promotes, say, a 10 percent 
discount to customers who are looking for a place to have lunch.
 
✓ If you’re a local dentist, you don’t want a lot of walk-ins; you want people 
to make an appointment before they show up at your office. In a case 
like that, you might consider a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign that drives 
people to your Web site where they can get your phone number or fill 
out a form to schedule an appointment, or you can list on an Internet 
Yellow Pages (IYP) site.
The moral of the story is that no matter what kind of business you own, your 
advertising mix is going to be dictated largely by your customers’ routine 
behavior with regard to your business. Your advertising mix is the old hand-
in-glove thing — and it’s important.

45
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
Positioning Your Business for Success
Before you can establish a local online advertising plan, you need a few key 
marketing basics in place. After you have that, you’ll know that you know 
what you need to know (follow that?), and your plan will be grounded firmly 
in reality and primed for success.
 
Although most of these basics hold true for traditional media advertising, the 
beauty of online advertising is that you can test it quickly and affordably — 
and make adjustments to your mix or your message in almost real time.
Here are the six building-block tasks that any serious marketer has to tackle:
 
1. Define your target market.
 
 Look at who you’re currently doing most of your business with and then 
figure out why they do business with you and what it is about them and 
their needs that are unique.
 
2. Write a paragraph that defines your target market.
 
 This helps you keep your customers’ unique characteristics in the front 
of your mind. Write what you think they want out of life and how your 
offering fits into their plans.
 
3. Identify your value proposition.
 
 Determine what your business does best — and why customers should 
choose your business over any of your competitors. This is where your 
USP comes in.
 
 If you honestly don’t know what it is about your business in particular 
that appeals to your customers, call a few and ask. You’re likely to get 
good, actionable answers. Your customers might even come away from 
your call feeling flattered that you sought their valuable opinions.
 
4. Create your key messages.
 
 Create a list of several compelling benefits that give people a reason 
to deal with you rather than with that guy across town and then look 
for ways to incorporate those benefits into your online advertising — 
whether via a PPC ad, an e-newsletter, or a blog entry.
 
5. Analyze your competition.
 
 Make sure you know who (and what) you’re competing against. How 
and where do your competitors advertise? What are their strengths and 
weaknesses? How can your business be competitive with theirs?

46
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
 
 A great way to do this is by searching for one of the services you offer. 
Do your competitors appear in the paid listings? If so, do their ads con-
tain an offer? Are they listed with the local IYP or do they maintain a 
Facebook page? In the same vein, search one of the major engines for 
your competitor’s name. The results show you where they have an 
advertising presence. Pay particular attention to any places you hadn’t 
yet thought of but that also make good sense for you.
 
6. Research your market online.
 
 Research can consume valuable time, but it’s time well spent because 
the better you understand your customers’ online behaviors, the more 
effective an online advertiser you are.
 
 Start by searching the major and the local search engines with keywords 
that best represent your business. That simple act produces a lot of 
search results, but that’s the goal. Now, follow up those results and see 
where they take you.
 
 Chances are the keywords will bring up a big, messy mix of IYP listings, 
local sites, blogs, social networks, local search results, and more. As you 
chase down each, make your own assessment of their potential to drive 
business. Does the content reflect what your business is about? Do the 
keywords take you to places where businesses like yours are discussed 
and where you might participate in the discussion? Would your cus-
tomers search the way you just did, or would they not dig as deep? Are 
some of your best customers on Facebook or LinkedIn?
After you do these six steps, you’re definitely closing in on what your ad mix 
should be. You’re also about to figure out (if you haven’t already) precisely 
how to position your local business to attract qualified local customers. And 
when you’ve done that, you can start establishing some informed, realistic, 
attainable, and maintainable marketing goals for your company, which is half 
the battle.
Setting Your Goals and Expectations
Imagine that you’re on an airplane. Your advertising planning starts with a 
view from 30,000 feet of what you want your advertising to achieve. You have 
to clearly identify your goals, assess honestly how many of those goals you 
can realistically afford to accomplish and in what time frame, and then set 
your expectations accordingly.
 
You can easily get carried away and decide that you want to accomplish eight 
things in two months for $38. You’re far better off starting with limited goals, 
an ample time horizon, and a good deal of budgetary padding built in to your 
estimate of just how much reaching those goals will cost. If you get where you 

47
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
intend to with this plan, you then have a base of success from which to launch 
your next phase. And odds are you’ll learn some helpful lessons along the way 
that you can use to make that next phase even more effective.
Begin with a clear accounting of your objectives, such as:
 
✓ Generate new customers
 
✓ Expand into new geographic markets
 
✓ Announce a new product or service
 
✓ Drive more repeat business
 
✓ Support your current customers more effectively
 
✓ Become the area’s premier provider of whatever it is you provide
 
✓ Create more local visibility and improve your company’s image
 
You don’t have to pick only one objective — as long as you don’t ask your 
advertising to do too many things simultaneously. That will only muddy your 
message.
To keep up the airplane analogy, you descend quickly to 10,000 feet. (The air 
sickness bags are in the seat pocket in front of you.) Take a look at your goals 
from an operational point of view, and understand what it will take to sup-
port and accomplish them.
Say your goal is to generate new customers. If you’re a plumber, getting 
new customers might involve getting your phone to ring as often as pos-
sible. Because you spend most of your day under somebody’s sink and you 
may not have a retail location to handle walk-ins, your phone (or answering 
system) is probably your best way to capture new customer leads.
If you own a salon, on the other hand, with a reception staff always on duty, 
getting new customers might involve a combination of incoming phone calls, 
walk-ins, and online advertisements, such as fliers or booking appointments.
 
Whatever kind of business you run, knowing how your customers consume is 
the key to achieving the goals you’ve set — and the key to getting the maxi-
mum results every day, from the online advertising you run.
Knowing what will happen
After you establish your goals and figure out how your operation best 
meshes with them, be aware of what online advertising does for you. Because 
online advertising is different than traditional advertising, going online means 
changing the way you think.

48
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
Does that sound a little scary? It isn’t. Just keep the following in mind:
 
✓ Online advertising can automate a lot of what you’ve traditionally 
been personally responsible for. For example, using online forms 
means you no longer have to be physically present to help a customer 
schedule an appointment.
 
✓ Online advertising is fluid. Unlike print advertising, you can start and 
stop your online campaigns almost at will, and you can test, measure, 
and refine them on an ongoing (and almost immediate) basis until you 
find your most effective marketing mix.
 
✓ Online advertising requires that you stay involved and take an active 
role in the details of your advertising campaign. This isn’t set-it-and-
forget-it stuff; this is getting in up to your waist, elbow, or some other 
upper body part . . . and staying there.
 
✓ Online advertising can typically generates some pretty healthy 
response rates and return on investments (ROIs). These often far 
exceed those that conventional print ads, direct mail pieces, and trade 
shows can give you. Be ready to handle that new bump in the number of 
prospective customers.
 
✓ Online advertising usually costs less to develop and place (or view) 
than conventional advertising. As a result, you may find that you 
suddenly have more money to work with than you used to.
Setting reasonable expectations of success
The other kind of expectation is the dollars-and-cents kind. That means figur-
ing out just what sort of increase in business you can realistically anticipate 
enjoying. Realistically is the keyword here. It’s far better (at least psychologi-
cally) to have modest expectations and be proved wrong than to have super-
ambitious ones and come up short.
Far be it for us to tell you what these expectations should be. (After all, we 
hardly know you, much less your business situation.) For argument’s sake, 
say that you’re looking for online advertising to increase your customer traf-
fic by 10 percent over the first three months. That’s probably not a crazy 
number, generally speaking. If that’s what happens, congratulations. Ten 
percent might not be enough to fund that Ferrari you’ve had your eye on, but 
you’re onto something. That percentage tells you to keep going — maybe 
invest a little more effort and expense in your efforts and see how far that 
level of online activity generates.
On the other hand, if you come up short on that hypothetical 10 percent, 
your expectations were too high, or your online methods were too few or too 
weak, or both. And that’s also valuable because those can be adjusted easily. 

49
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
In short, let the market — and the results it brings you — guide you in answer-
ing the time-honored question: What do I do now?
Identifying Strategies for Success
We realize this may sound elementary, but it’s also hard-as-titanium true: In 
advertising, everyone’s goal is sales related, whether you aim to bring new 
people in the door or to get existing customers to buy more of what you’re 
selling. The question then becomes, how will your online advertising deliver 
the results you’re after?
If you just opened a pet grooming shop, your immediate priority will prob-
ably be to generate leads that can then drive sales. In other words, lead gen-
eration. But if you’re a kitchen and bath remodeler who’s been in business 
for years, you may simply want to grow more business from the customer 
base you already have. In other words, lead nurturing. Finally, you may want 
to obtain the contact information (name and e-mail address, at least) of the 
people who respond to your online advertising. In other words, lead capture.
Lead generation
Lead generation, referred to in the hallowed halls of marketing as lead gen, is 
pretty much what it sounds like: The creation (or generation) of interest or 
inquiries into a business’ products or services by prospective new custom-
ers. In less formal terms, lead generation means walking into your office one 
morning and finding ten new e-mails from people you don’t know who want 
information about or from your company.
Online lead generation has great appeal for local businesses like yours 
because it lets you
 
✓ Determine your pricing on a per-lead basis.
 
✓ Choose the product or service you want to tell prospects about.
 
✓ Select the geographical area(s) that your business is interested in farming.
 
✓ Control the number of leads that come in each month, which assists in 
budgeting your time and resources.
 
✓ Pay only for the traffic and leads received (which is particularly true 
with PPC search engine ads).
If your calendar currently has a lot of holes in it and you need to drum up 
business fast, lead gen is a good way to grow your business rather quickly. 
That can, in turn, increase your ROI and put more business on the books.

How do you actually generate the leads you want? Employ one or more of 
the highly cool online tactics that you can read about in Chapters 7–13. 
Ultimately, all online advertising has some form of lead generation as its goal. 
And if the tactics you decided to use at first aren’t doing the job, you’re not 
necessarily doing something wrong; you may just not be doing something 
sufficiently right yet.
Your approach to lead generation needs to be the same as with any advertis-
ing endeavor. Set aside a reasonable budget to test a given technique — and 
then see if it works. If that technique works, great. If not, change or refine the 
technique. This is hardly rocket science, although it might seem like it 
at times.
Lead gen becomes a truly successful effort when your conversion skills 
(which is a fancy way of saying your ability to sell) are polished enough 
to “convert” those leads into actual buyers at a high rate. If you’re under-
equipped in some way to follow through on the leads you get, throttle back 
on the incoming leads, sift those leads down to the super-best ones — or, we 
suggest respectfully, polish your skills.
Lead capture
Lead capture usually happens at the same time as — or right after — lead 
generation and before lead nurturing. You’re using online advertising that 
prospects respond to. If their responses don’t already give you contact infor-
mation, find a way to get it. That’s the capture phase and then you can go on 
to nurture (or yeah, okay, schmooze) them.
Leads can be captured via phone, or increasingly via Web site. So you don’t 
necessarily need to put up a site for lead capture, but you’re almost certain 
to increase leads, traffic, and sales, if you do. In Chapters 4 and 5, we discuss 
a lead capture page on your Web site, or a landing page. This page appears 
when a potential customer clicks your online ad or the link to your business 
that they find on a search engine. This page usually displays content that’s 
a logical extension of the ad or link, but more important, it can (and should) 
offer a variety of calls to action that will get people to respond and give you 
their contact information in the process.
So now you’ve captured a prospect’s contact information. Great. Time to 
follow up. You can safely assume that people who just gave you their info 
expect to hear from you. Don’t leave them hanging — make contact.
 
People who have willingly given you their names and contact information con-
stitute leads that are about as high-quality as leads can get. They’re your birds 
in the hand.

51
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
Lead nurturing
Lead nurturing is the process of building relationships with qualified pros-
pects to grow them into buyers at some point. As you know, a lot of leads just 
aren’t sales-ready yet. Those leads need some gentle prodding, persuading, 
and a little TLC. It’s either that or just throwing them away, which doesn’t 
feed the proverbial bulldog.
When does lead nurturing make sense?
 
✓ When you’re selling a big-ticket item. Almost always, the bigger the 
price tag, the longer it takes a prospective buyer to hand over the cash.
 
✓ When repeat business is a strong driver of your sales. In other words, 
when you have actual buyers in hand, you want to keep nurturing that 
relationship so they’ll come back and buy again.
 
✓ When your opt-in e-mail list grows. Figuring out a way to do lead nur-
turing on a broad scale increases your chances of expanding your sales.
Here’s a pretty basic example of a lead nurturing program that’s designed to 
instill trust in your business and position it as the best, most expert place for 
your nurturees to do business:
Asking for the opt-in
You’ve undoubtedly seen call, click, or visit 
on a lot of Web sites. The invitation to click is 
often displayed on or near a button that you’re 
expected to click. When people click that 
button, they generally get whooshed to a page 
asking them to fill in their contact information. 
In return for doing that, they get something from 
the site sponsor (a discount, a case history, a 
bobble-head doll — something). And the spon-
sor, of course, now knows how to contact them 
and start revving them up for a sale.
Most contact info pages also ask the visi-
tor to opt-in to your e-mail program. This just 
means that the visitor is giving you permission 
to send him e-mails. Without that permission, 
you can potentially be in a whole stewpot of 
trouble. (Chapter 10 goes into the gory details 
of the penalties that can be imposed on you for 
e-mailing without permission.)
So there’s no reason not to ask for a visitor’s 
opt-in permission at the same time you get her 
name, e-mail address, and any other reason-
able identifying information you need. (Hint: 
Asking for blood type generally sends the 
wrong message.)

52
Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
Day 1: Prospects opt-in on your Web site for you to contact them.
Day 2: You e-mail a welcome to these prospects.
Day 28: You e-mail them a recent customer success story.
Day 42: You e-mail them a recent article of interest you found on the 
Internet; it’s an article that puts a product or service like yours in a good 
light.
Day 63: You e-mail them a touching-base note, a “Hi, how are things with 
you” kind of message.
Day 80: You e-mail them a discount offer on something you sell.
Day 85: The prospect calls you: Voilà! You have a qualified lead.
“Wow,” you say, “That’s a long stretch of nurturing.” But think about it: None 
of the steps are difficult to do, and over time, you may get to the point where 
you already have everything (except the customer success story and Internet 
article) in the can, ready to be sent off almost automatically. And the time 
frame for the nurturing stage can shrink (or expand) depending on how much 
a sale is worth. If you’re selling a bicycle, the nurturing stage will be shorter. 
If you’re selling an RV, this stage could easily run a lot longer.
Is lead nurturing really worth it? Yep. One study reports that lead nurturing 
programs can increase a business’s sales opportunities by an average of 20 
percent. (Don’t take our word for it? Read the Marketo article at http://
pages2.marketo.com/real-roi-wp.html.) Plus, this stage can improve 
your closing ratios, strengthen your sales pipeline, shorten your overall sales 
cycle, and enhance the overall image of your business in the marketplace. So, 
like we said, the answer is yep.
Creating a Time and Action Plan
Okay, now comes the creative part because now is when you take all that 
useful stuff we cover earlier in this chapter and put it to work in a time and 
action plan. You decide what time frame you want to work with and what you 
want to accomplish at different points along that timeline. And then you write 
that plan.
The nearby sidebar, “A sample time and action plan,” shows an example plan 
for the fictional landscaping service owner Leo.

 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
A sample time and action plan
We created a sample plan that can be used as a 
guide in creating a plan for your own business. 
Of course, the actual objectives and tactics for 
your own plan will vary based on your specific 
needs. Moreover, your own plan will likely be 
significantly more detailed.
Leo’s Landscaping — Your bushes are our 
business!
Primary goal: To become the preferred land-
scaping service in the Tri-City area.
Objective One: Increase new customers and 
sales for the residential side of the business.
1.  PPC advertising: Use Google AdWords to 
promote key residential landscaping services 
and our statues and fountains specialty.
 
 Measure results by the number of people 
who click each ad, the number of people 
who convert on the Web site (call or fill out 
a form to schedule an appointment), the 
number of people who hire us, where the 
best leads come from, and the new cus-
tomer cost.
 2. Lead aggregators: Sign up with a lead 
aggregator such as ServiceMagic to buy 
leads they generate online.
 
 Measure results by looking at the number 
of new customers gained through these 
leads and dividing by the cost for leads 
(customer acquisition cost).
Objective Two: Develop programs that increase 
repeat sales and word-of-mouth referrals.
 1. Current customers: Start creating a cus-
tomer opt-in database (names and e-mail 
addresses) by offering discounts to custom-
ers who provide their contact information. 
E-mail a coupon as a thank you. Do main-
tenance with new sign-ons every month. 
Begin a “Gardening Tips” newsletter for 
customers who provide e-mail addresses.
 
 Measure results by getting 100 new names.
 2. Prospects: Create a Facebook page for 
Leo’s Landscaping. Use a Facebook event 
to invite fans to participate in an online 
drawing for a free plant.
 
 Measure results by the number of new 
names and e-mail addresses gathered on 
the Web site.
 3. Brainstorm further ideas: Survey current 
customers online for feedback on quality 
and variety of Leo’s services, customer 
relations skill, employees’ knowledge and 
so on.
Objective Three: Develop a commercial client 
base.
 1. PPC advertising: Add keywords and cam-
paigns to Google AdWords account to pro-
mote key commercial landscaping services 
including our special on year-long mainte-
nance contracts.
 
 Measure results by the number of people 
who click each ad, the number of people 
who convert on the Web site (call or fill out 
a form to schedule an appointment), the 
number of people who hire us, where the 
best leads come from, and the new cus-
tomer cost.
 2. LinkedIn presence: Solicit recommenda-
tions, participate in relevant Q&A forums, 
and lead discussion groups on relevant 
topics to establish professional credibility.
 
 Measure results by the number of contacts 
established and the number of recommen-
dations received.

Part I: Getting Started with Local Online Advertising 
When you write a time and action plan to achieve a particular goal or out-
come, stick to a few disciplines:
 
✓ Clarify your goal: Can you conjure up a visual picture of the expected 
outcome? How will you know if and when you’ve reached your goal? 
What about your goal makes it measurable? What constraints are you 
working under: time, money, and other resources?
 
✓ Write a list of actions: Focus on generating and writing as many ideas 
and options as possible. Have paper with you so you can jot ideas as 
they come to you; when doing this, don’t edit yourself — no one ever 
has to see this list but you, and you never know what amazingly great 
idea might just pop up if you let it.
 
✓ Analyze, prioritize, and (now) edit: Looking at the list of actions you 
put together, ask: Which are absolutely necessary? Are these neces-
sary steps also likely to be the most effective ones? If not, do these 
steps at least set the stage for some truly effective steps down the line? 
(They can be valuable in either case.) Which, if any, action items can be 
dropped from your plan without significantly affecting the outcome? Be 
honest and then cross them off.
 
✓ Organize your action list into a plan: Decide which order to take your 
action steps. Recognize whether some action will require some prelimi-
nary steps before it can be put into place; this could affect the overall 
order of your actions. Then rearrange actions that make for a better flow.
 
 Look at the plan one last time: Can it be simplified even further? If so, do 
it; you’ll end up saving some time and effort down the road.
 
✓ Live by a calendar: Figure out what you need to do to accomplish 
each action and then plot them on a calendar. Don’t give yourself more 
(or less) time than you’ll realistically need; too much time can make you 
complacent whereas too little time can make you crazy. Pledge 
that you’ll meet those calendar dates; if you’ve planned properly (and 
realistically), this is all manageable.
 
✓ Review your plan regularly and monitor your progress: How far have 
you actually progressed toward you goal to date? Has new knowledge or 
situation change intervened that might require adjusting the plan? Make 
any necessary adjustments to your plan to take that new information 
or change in circumstances into account, or to simply speed your prog-
ress. Scrapping the whole plan isn’t an adjustment (just in case you were 
wondering).

 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
Establishing a Realistic Budget
Back in the olden days — before Al Gore invented the Internet and a menu 
was something you found only in restaurants — most businesses operated 
with an advertising budget of 2–5 percent of the previous year’s gross sales. 
Determining budgets were easy that way, even though it was very hard to 
measure results.
Now the Internet is nearly taken for granted. Businesses have a lot more 
flexibility to set their budgets at whatever level they believe necessary to be 
successful — and to measure the results of each of their advertising expen-
ditures against their spending. If the world isn’t a brave new one, it’s at least 
more efficient.
Determining the right amount to spend
Your first budget is probably the hardest to come up with, but it’s worth the 
effort. This budget gives you something to analyze the results of your online 
advertising against and lets you see easily where your advertising campaigns 
will need to be refined. By the next business year, you’ll have actual results 
on which to base your budget that you didn’t the first time — and your time 
and action plan will be that much more effective.
For your first budget, your best initial step is to do a breakdown of the costs 
you can reasonably associate with each of the tactics you want to use. For 
instance, if you plan to send a monthly e-newsletter, factor in the cost of your 
time. And don’t forget to also factor in the cost of creating and distributing it 
(all while knowing that as your list of customers grows during the year, those 
costs will grow, too).
 
Even with a tight budget, you can generate, capture, and nurture leads 
because of online advertising’s built-in cost-effectiveness. If you can afford to 
spend more, you can choose among high-ticket items (like a really first-class 
Web site) and other tactics that are (almost) free. That gives you a lot of flex-
ibility to customize your plan — and your expenditures. Remember, too, that 
multiple expenditures to your message through the various online vehicles 
you use will have a cumulative effect: The more prospects see of you (within 
reason), the better they’ll remember you and the better your chances of clos-
ing sales. And keep in mind that the efficiencies of online advertising make this 
kind of message repetition possible at just about any budget level.

56

Determining your potential return on 
investment (ROI)
At this point in the planning process, keep a close eye on three metrics 
(which is just fancy talk for numbers):
 
✓ Cost per lead = Cost from marketing effort ÷ Number of qualified leads 
generated
 
 For example, if Bob’s banner ads cost $500 and generated 50 leads, his 
CPL is $10 (500 ÷ 50 = 10)
 
✓ Cost per acquisition = Revenue from marketing effort ÷ Cost from mar-
keting effort
 
 For example, if the 50 leads Bob gets turn into 10 sales, his CPA is $50 
(500 ÷ 10 = 50)
 
✓ Return on investment = Revenue from marketing effort – Cost from mar-
keting effort ÷ Cost from marketing effort
 
 For example, if the 10 sales Bob earns result in $1,000 in revenue, his ROI 
is 100 percent (1,000 – 500 ÷ 500 = 1 or 100 percent)
CPL
Cost per lead (CPL) expresses the cost of bringing a lead in your door. This 
usually requires some action on the part of the lead-to-be: opting-in on your 
Web site, phoning you, filling out an online form, and so on. Now, generating 
that lead costs you something. The cost of maintaining your site, the cost of 
getting your phone number in front of the person, or the time it takes to har-
vest the information from the online form and turn it into data for later use.
Measuring your CPL is important. Otherwise, you’re giving without receiving, 
which may be a nice, virtuous thing to do, but it doesn’t help your bottom 
line.
CPA
Cost per acquisition (CPA) expresses the cost of actually acquiring a new 
customer. Measure your CPA because spending money on advertising that 
isn’t converting leads into new customers for your business is simply a waste 
of time.
ROI
Return on investment (ROI) typically expresses the rate at which you recover 
your investment in online advertising. Why is this important? Simple (and 
critical): Your ROI tells you whether your online advertising plan is working. 
If you spend $1,000 on advertising, you want at least $1,001 coming back to 
you — otherwise, what’s the point?

57
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Online Advertising Campaign
Sure, that’s oversimplified. But even at such an elementary level, you have to 
think about your cost of goods and the dollars-and-cents value of your time 
in view of the margins you’re hoping to realize. You need either lower costs 
or higher profits — and generally both — to produce a hefty margin. Figure 
out realistically what your costs and your profits are likely to be, and your 
ROI won’t hand you any nasty surprises.
How the numbers all come together
 
You might reasonably conclude that CPA could potentially be so important 
to your planning that there’s really no reason to use CPL. To which we say, 
unequivocally: yes — and no. Customer acquisition can take an ungodly 
amount of time, so you may have to wait quite a while before you can calcu-
late your CPA. In the meantime, CPL — measuring the more immediate collec-
tion of leads — can be extremely helpful in its own right.
Here’s how all three of these factors intertwine. Say you’re a dermatologist. 
You may find you can generate a much lower CPL by using PPC ads than by 
using banner ads. However, you may also find that banner advertising gener-
ates a lower CPA overall (meaning that you’re getting more leads from your 
PPC ads, but your banner ads are pulling in more leads that actually turn into 
patients). Does that mean you go lighter on the PPC front? Or heavier on the 
banner ads? Probably both. However, the last metric, ROI, is really the most 
important metric because not all customers (or patients) are equal, and some 
may end up providing you a lot more revenue and profit.
Pretty simple, eh? All these acronyms look like alphabet soup, but it’s really 
just good old-fashioned, outlay-versus-intake business practice. And we 
assume that’s something you already have nailed down. For some more 
handy examples on how to handle some of this marketing math, check out 
Chapter 6.

W
hen people get interested, even excited, about 
what they’ve seen in your online advertising, 
where should they go? Your Web site, where prospective 
customers can learn all about the products and/or services 
you sell as well as get a firm sense of your company’s 
personality. Without a Web site, even the best online 
advertising plan leads nowhere.
Chapter 4 delves into the questions you need to ask

The Key to Online 
Advertising Success
In This Chapter
▶ Asking questions before building
▶ Understand your site’s role in your strategy
▶ Creating your framework for success
▶ Setting the right look and feel
▶ Walking the line between information and promotion
You know the old saying, “The eyes are the windows to the soul”? Well, 
your Web site is the window to your business. For many people, your 
Web site is the first thing they see when they connect with you — and first 
impressions count.
Your site is the primary fulfillment vehicle for all your online advertising 
because it’s where people come to find out more about you, take advantage 
of an offer you’ve made, or sign up for a newsletter. Most important, the site 
is where you begin — then continue — to convert prospects into customers. 
If your Web site is effective, you’re golden. If it’s not, you’ll waste money on 
your entire online advertising program.
Think of your site as the halfway point between your advertising and your 
front door. And that site has to be good enough to get prospects to pick up 
the phone and call you. (Or maybe even to rouse themselves out of their 
chairs and into their cars to come to your place of business.) Done properly, 
your Web site establishes your business’s credibility and allows your pros-
pects to gather information about you. And that information should be the 
same as your best salesperson would give them in a face-to-face encounter — 
except it’s available on your site 24/7.

62
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
In this chapter, you discover exactly what it takes to get an effective Web site 
built and to keep it current, relevant, and compelling.
Asking the Right Questions before 
Building Begins
Virtually all your online advertising tactics — your pay-per-click (PPC) and 
banner ads, your local listings, your Facebook pages, and whatever else — 
either link directly to or at least feature a link to your site. Savvy Internet 
users expect this. They expect to be whisked to your URL to read more about 
your business, to find contact information, and to take advantage of special 
offers — something that both entices and enables them to take some action 
or in some other way, engage with your business.
But before we talk about how to create an effective marketing Web site, you 
need to resolve one pivotal question: Is it better to build your Web site or to 
get professional help?
Unlike, say, putting together a bicycle for your child, building a Web site 
involves enough moving parts and pieces that completely doing it yourself 
is only one of three options — plus a fourth approach that isn’t DIY (do-it-
yourself) at all. Before we list them, though, here we explain what a few of 
those parts and pieces are:
 
✓ The template: The template is the basis, or foundation, that your Web 
site is built on. (Some business owner decide, mistakenly we think, to try 
building their sites without one. Although technically possible, we defi-
nitely don’t recommend this unless you happen to have some serious 
Web-design chops.) Most of these templates are predesigned, but you 
can customize them however you like. All you need to do is add your 
own content — and you’re on your way.
 
 Practically speaking, a template is really just a kind of frame. The ele-
ments of a Web site, such as logos, copy, graphics, and so on, are placed 
in the different inner frames as desired. These internal spaces can usu-
ally be expanded and contracted to fit the stuff that goes in them.
 
 Maybe the designer — who could well be you — wants a big central area 
for the body copy. Done. Then three smaller spaces where pictures or 
illustrations will go. Got it. Then narrower, horizontal spaces at the top 
and bottom of the page for the logo, contact information, and legal dis-
claimers. Okay. And so on, until the page is (tastefully) filled. An exam-
ple of a basic template is shown in Figure 4-1, and how that template 
might then be filled is shown in Figure 4-2.

63
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
 
Figure 4-1: 
A template 
provides a 
framework 
into which 
the text 
and visual 
elements of 
each Web 
page are 
placed.
 
 
✓ Hosting: Obviously, after a site is designed fully, it’s somehow has to 
be put up on the Web for any and all to access it. Hosting is the process 
of getting the site online. Through hosting, you get the site placed on a 
third party’s computer server (where the site then resides) from which 
it can then be called up by users who enter the Web site’s URL or click 
a link from an ad or an e-mail. This can get a little tricky and is usually 
given to someone well-versed in computer skills to get it done (for a fee, 
of course — usually $10–$50 a month).
 
✓ Maintenance and updating: No matter how wonderfully designed and 
executed a Web site may be, it isn’t completely immune from mystery 
gremlins that occasionally make it start acting funny, or even stop acting 
at all. Making the necessary fix isn’t usually all that hard, but finding the 
problem — often buried somewhere deep in the site’s code — can be a 
real challenge. Consequently, a site owner is nearly always best advised 
to put a real expert on the case.

64

Figure 4-2: 
By adjusting 
the size of 
the spaces 
in the 
template, 
you can 
customize it 
to accom-
modate the 
elements 
you want 
the page to 
include.
 
 
 Updating the material on a site is generally a lot easier than holding the 
aforementioned gremlins at bay — which is a good thing because updat-
ing a Web site is something that is done periodically, no matter how sol-
idly the site is running. A business’s product line changes as do its prices 
and policies. On the technical side, sites have to be able to respond to 
improvements that search engines make in their own mechanics; plus, 
new engines may appear on the scene to which a site has to be made 
compatible. Sometimes you just need to freshen the site with new graph-
ics to keep it looking as current as your competitors’ sites. If you choose 
to update the site, pick a vendor that has easy-to-use editing tools so that 
you can update your site as quickly and easily as you can update your 
Facebook page. We list vendors, later in this chapter, that have strong 
tools to help the novice create and maintain attractive sites.
 
 A local business owner often can do these maintenance and updat-
ing jobs (if they’ve selected the right Web site management tool), but 
making even a simple update incorrectly (say, by accidentally changing 
or erasing code) might break the whole site. Here again, the best advice 
may be to put an expert at the helm.

65
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
Reviewing your Web site building options
If you’ve followed along so far, you’re armed with an understanding of all that 
needs to be accomplished to get a Web site up and running (and to keep it 
that way). Here we look at the available options:
 
✓ Doing it 100 percent DIY, without even so much as a template: Unless 
you’re a Web site programming and design wizard, we don’t recommend 
the 100 percent DIY approach. For most business owners, the time, 
hassle, and learning curve are too steep.
 
✓ Creating a DIY Web site with a template: A local business owner can 
find a good number of free or low-cost, good and thoroughly workable 
templates (many of which you’ll find listed in the section, “Finding a 
template that best fits your Web site”). This is a credible option for folks 
who have a tight budget, little spare time, or both. However, this option 
still leaves you with a lot of things to do on your own (like hosting and 
maintenance) that you may simply lack the skills for.
 
✓ Having a Web site built for you based on a template: You can hire an 
outside Web site company (or an independent consultant) to do your 
site design based on a template you like; after the site is done, this same 
outside resource takes care of the hosting. You’re still often left holding 
the reins as far as maintenance and updating are concerned, but you 
have an expertly designed Web site that works properly and reliably. 
For a lot of local businesses, this approach represents the best balance 
between cost, time, and results.
 
✓ Having a fully custom Web site built for you: This is pretty much the 
soup-to-nuts approach. This option is almost always pain-free for a 
business owner, and consequently, it’s the most costly of the options. 
Actually, here are three sub-methods of getting a custom site built. Each 
may entail a different level of expense (research to find the one that best 
fits your budget). These sub-methods are
 
• Use an agency or an experienced independent professional. Of these 
two, the independent pro will probably be the more costly. But 
either way, you’ll wind up with a high-quality, high-performance site. 
Be aware, however, that not all custom builders are as competent at 
building in the right lead capture and conversion methodologies for 
small businesses as they are at designing, and you may find that you 
need still other experts to handle these deeper functions.
 
• Use a Web design firm that specializes in providing turnkey Web 
site solutions for local businesses. These firms can do absolutely 
everything, including building your site, registering your URL, host-
ing, providing ongoing maintenance, updating, and sending you a 
nice card for the holidays. Yes, this is the Rolls-Royce approach, 
and it’s a terrific option for those local businesses that can afford 
it. You can, however, usually buy somewhat smaller packages of 
services from these folks if you’re willing to, say, handle all future 
updating — and that can save you some marginal expense.

• Use a local online advertising firm that specializes in providing exten-
sive Web site services to small business clients. Note the word clients. 
That’s because although these firms can be very good at what they 
do, most of them won’t build and maintain a site unless you also 
engage them to do your online advertising. (We delve deeper into 
local online advertising agencies in Chapter 9.) For now, just be 
aware that where your costs shake out in this kind of combined 
arrangement can fall almost anywhere on the price spectrum.
Finding a template that 
best fits your Web site
The possible templates available for your Web site design range from the 
fairly simple to the fairly complex, and their price points ride the same curve.
Basic templates
Basic Web site templates are ready-made designs that can accommodate 
pretty much any Web site design. Most of the companies that offer them have 
large portfolios of templates for you to choose from based on your profes-
sion. And nearly all the templates allow for not-too-difficult customization 
with regard to your text, graphics, and logo. These companies can also help 
you choose your own domain (your URL), get it registered, and bonus, they 
may even do so at no cost. What’s more, they can generally take care of your 
site’s hosting for a monthly cost of about $10–$50.
The cost of basic templates will likely run from free (yes!) up to around $500. 
Not surprisingly, the more you pay, the higher template quality you get and 
the more customizable it will be.
Some of the companies that offer basic Web site templates are
 
✓ Template Monster: These folks have one of the largest portfolios of 
small business templates for you to choose from. Their templates are 
reasonably priced, from $50–$100. (www.templatemonster.com)
 
✓ Dreamweaver Graphics: These inexpensive and easy-to-use Web site 
templates are based on Adobe Dreamweaver software and range from 
$20–$75 each. These templates make it pretty simple to house your 
graphics, text, and logo as well as to change them, if the need arises. 
Helpfully, business owners who are new to this whole template thing 
can dive in with a Starter Series. (www.dreamweavergraphics.net)
 
✓ Homestead: This company has a portfolio of over 2,000 templates and 
offers three tiers of Web site packages, ranging from a Starter Package 
for $4.99 per month to a Platinum Package for $49.99 per month. (www.
homestead.com)

 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
 
✓ Weebly: Offers an easy-to-use tool in which you can create your own 
site for free and include a variety of multimedia elements, such as photo 
galleries and video. (www.weebly.com)
High-end designs — template and otherwise
Today’s high-end designs are a good deal more sophisticated than basic ones 
and are typically done on a case-by-case custom basis by a professional Web 
site designer or design team (whether they start from a template or from 
scratch). These specialists base the design of your site on your personal 
objectives, and they’re in frequent contact to make sure the site design is in 
line with your expectations. You can include elements, such as video, exten-
sive photo galleries, e-commerce capabilities, appointment request forms, 
and so on. And the sites produced by these companies may also incorpo-
rate coding that can improve your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts 
(which we cover in Chapter 8). Finally, your design people remain available 
to you to handle any changes to the site that you want or need to make down 
the road.
Some of these high-end template providers are
 
✓ dzine it: This company builds customized Web sites for businesses of 
all types and sizes, and it offers various packages that range from what 
Budget 1 to specialized sites that are super-sophisticated and priced 
accordingly. (www.dzineit.net)
 
✓ Web.com: Builds Web sites for individuals and businesses of all indus-
tries and automatically optimizes the site for search engines. You can 
contact them for a free consultation to get a quote based on your spe-
cific needs. (www.web.com)
 
✓ Officite: This Web site design firm specializes in producing custom 
Web sites for medical practices. The Web sites it creates typically allow 
patients to make appointments through appointment request forms and 
to view educational videos. Officite also includes Site Editor, a standby 
utility that lets business owners easily make changes to the site, any 
time they like. These custom sites run from a few hundred dollars to a 
few thousand, depending on the number of features that are involved. 
(www.officite.com)
 
✓ GNC Web Creations: Another excellent custom Web site design com-
pany, GNC tailors its services to small businesses. GNC even has an 
Internet marketing consultant on board to ensure that its small business 
clients generate maximum traffic. GNC can also give you a well-practiced 
hand in creating your business’s brand identity, which usually includes 
logo design, typeface guidelines, and other proprietary elements.

Local online advertising companies
We include local online adverting companies because even though they typi-
cally specialize in developing advertising plans for small and mid-sized local 
businesses, they usually also do Web site development. The primary focus in 
all cases though is increasing the visibility of a client’s site, including making 
sure that the site shows up prominently in search engine results.
Here are some local online advertising companies (we delve a little more into 
these in Chapter 9):
 
✓ Yodle: www.yodle.com
 
✓ ReachLocal: www.reachlocal.com
 
✓ OrangeSoda: www.orangesoda.com
 
✓ WebVisible: www.webvisible.com
Thinking it through
The fact of the matter is unless you’re really eager to create the Web site, 
don’t. A big range of alternative options are available — and odds are that 
more than one of them will suit your budget.
Assuming (safely, we think) that you aren’t already a professional Web 
designer, your decision as to which approach to take depends on three 
things:
 
✓ The time you can put into the project
 
✓ The budget you have to work with
 
✓ Your understanding of just how high-end your site really needs to be
For example, if you just opened a locksmith business, a simple DIY-with-
template site may be more than adequate to get you started. But if you’re a 
plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills with a reputation to uphold, consider having 
a site built for you. In either case, make a realistic assessment of the end-
product you need.
 
Before sitting down with a Web consultant, bounce around the Internet and 
finding other business’ Web pages that appeal to you. Print them, take them 
with you, and say, “Kind of like this, with a little bit of that.” You can also find 
some glossy magazine ads that you like the look of to take with you. (Print ads 
are often a close cousin to Web pages, design-wise.) Either approach is miles 
better than showing up empty-handed and telling the consultant something 
like, “I want it to be symphonic, yet tubular,” and expecting the poor designer 
to figure out what on earth you’re talking about.

69
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
Finding a professional Web designer
Finding the professional Web site help you need really isn’t all that difficult. 
Ad agencies are usually listed in the phone book as are Web development 
companies. But being the enlightened soul that you are, you’re best off using 
a search engine.
You can also see who designed your competitors’ Web sites, which is becom-
ing increasingly easy as more and more developers are signing their work 
somewhere on the site (most commonly in the footer at the bottom of one or 
more pages). You can also get recommendations as to Web professionals from 
people in your local trade associations who may be using those profession-
als. Today, you can even find regional associations of Web professionals, and 
they’re often listed on search engines and/or in Web provider directories.
After you find a few potential designers and/or developers, ask to see the 
sites they’ve designed or built for others. And by all means, ask for refer-
ences and then contact those references before you hire them.
Web provider directories
Here are a few Web provider directories to get you started, whether you’re 
looking for a full-service company or individual specialists, such as designers:
 
✓ Web designer directories:
 
• Web Design Directory: www.designdir.net
 
• WebDesign Finders: http://webdesignfinders.net
 
• Web Site Design Directory: www.web-designers-directory.org

Understanding Your Site’s Role 
in Your Overall Strategy
Imagine it’s spring, things are blooming, everything smells nice, and most 
important, it’s prom time. If you own a limousine service, prom is pretty 
much to you what taxes are to accountants: Big and competitive.

70
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
Say a high school senior wants to hire a limo to chauffeur him and his date 
to the prom. He immediately goes to the Internet, fires up a search engine, 
and — lo and behold — your business comes up first in the local listings. 
Perfect! This young hero clicks through to your site. And then . . . well, just 
what happens is the reason you need to understand the role of your site in 
your overall strategy.
Your Web site is integral to your online advertising success. If the advertis-
ing tactics we discuss in Chapter 2 are the spokes of a wheel, your Web site 
is the hub — the central point where everything comes together and your 
crucial lead capture (a concept we discuss in Chapter 3) takes place. This 
state of affairs in which all the components of your online advertising work 
together — enmeshed and in sync — is integrated marketing, and that’s what 
makes the whole of your efforts greater than the sum of its parts.
Even in a small local business, your Web site has to succeed on a number 
of levels if the online advertising dollars you spend are going to bear fruit. 
Why? Because what’s the point of working (and spending) hard-to-drive, well-
qualified prospects to a site that then disappoints them or fails to instill con-
fidence in your company? Lose those folks at this pivotal point, and they’ll 
likely never come back — and your entire advertising effort will have been 
reduced to sound and fury, signifying nothing.
That being the case, here are three things your Web site needs to accomplish 
if your online advertising is going to be successful:
 
✓ Catch and hold attention: From the headline, to the photos, to the 
fonts, to the design and the copy, everything about your site has to be 
made appealing to the audience you’re after. If you’re that limo company 
owner, show a picture of your white, 47-foot-long Hummer. If you’re a 
landscaper, show a photograph of your latest work when the grass is 
green and the flowers are in bloom. This is the same with all the other 
elements of your site; they have to tell visitors, “Wow, you’ve come to 
the right place!”
 
✓ Instill confidence: Engage your customers with what you have to offer, 
and give them great confidence in your abilities. Some of the things that 
nearly always instill confidence are before-and-after photos, testimonials 
from satisfied customers, favorable reviews, and the logos of trade asso-
ciation you’re affiliated with. (You can find more on this in Chapter 5.) Make 
it immediately clear what you can do for them — in short, sell them on 
the benefits of doing business with you. (After all, no one’s really going 
to care why you went into the awning business; they just want to know 
that your products are great at keeping them out of the sun.) Provide 
useful information that’s easy for visitors to find — and make it as inter-
esting as you possibly can.

71
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
 
✓ Get visitors to take action: Here’s where the proverbial rubber meets 
the hypothetical road because you want your prospects to take some 
concrete action — whether it’s calling you, signing up for an e-newsletter, 
or booking an appointment online. Whatever the action is that you’ve 
convinced them to take, you’ve moved them one step closer to becoming 
real, dollars-and-cents-spending customers.
Having a conversion strategy
A conversion strategy is — prepare to be shocked — the strategy you use to 
convert your site visitors into leads and your leads into sales. Determining 
what conversion strategy you want to use starts with identifying your Web 
site’s primary goal. What’s the one overriding action you want people to take 
upon visiting your site? To call you? Fill out an online form? Subscribe to a 
newsletter? Come to your location? Answer that question, and everything 
else starts to fall into place because your answer will direct you straight to
 
✓ Using a clear call-to-action (CTA) strategy: A CTA is simply a prompt for 
prospects to take a specific action, and you need to put CTAs throughout 
your site. Say you want your site’s visitors to fill out a form; put that form 
(or at least links to it) on most or all your pages. Doing so is like dropping 
baited fishhooks off the side of a boat: The more of them you put in the 
water, the better your chances are of a catching what you’re after.
 
✓ Making it easy for people to take the desired action: Don’t make visi-
tors to your site jump through hoops to take the action you want them 
to take. Asking for too much information or placing too many demands 
on their patience (like making them go from one page to another to 
another to complete a form) will turn them off and send them away.
 
 Say you’re an electrician and you want your site to generate sales leads, 
which in turn requires visitors to fill in a form with their contact infor-
mation. Put that form on every page of your site (rather than making 
your prospects have to navigate to it) and keep the information you ask 
for both simple and brief (pretty much just their name, phone number, 
and e-mail address).
 
✓ Providing an offer to reward their action: Offer visitors something 
of value as an enticement to act. This could be a free consultation, a 
special discount on a product or service, or even a zippy, free T-shirt. 
Whatever the prize is, the bigger and better your offer, the greater the 
likelihood that your prospects will act and that you’ll boost your conver-
sion rate.

72
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
 One tried-and-true method of enhancing the perceived value of an 
offer is to tag it with an actual value. For example, if you own a day spa 
that offers Swedish massages and you want to offer prospects a free 
20-minute session, express it as Sign Up Now for Your Free Massage — a 
$40 Value! rather than just Sign Up for Your Free Massage. Forget about 
trying to fathom the psychology of it all — doing this just works.
Knowing what to measure and why
Knowledge is power, and you’d be amazed how much knowledge about your 
customers and your market you can gather from your Web site. You can, for 
instance, figure out where your prospects are coming from, how they’re find-
ing you, and even what they do while they’re actually on your site. When you 
know these important things, you can use what you find out to make your 
site — and your ad spending — even more effective.
We discuss tracking, measuring, and reporting in Chapter 6, but for now, you 
need a broad sense of just what — and how much — your Web site can tell 
you. Namely, your site can help you
 
✓ Identify what your users like (and dislike) about your site: Web analyt-
ics tells you which pages on your site get the most traffic as well as the 
site’s most common entry and exit pages. You can then use this data 
to refine and optimize your site. Knowing the most common exit page 
is especially useful because it poses the simple question: Why? How 
can that page be made more interesting, more compelling, and a better 
gateway to other pages on your site? Solving just the exit page problem 
alone can do wonders for your site’s effectiveness.
 
✓ Find out where your traffic comes from and why: Are search engines 
your site’s biggest source of traffic? Or are you benefiting from unsus-
pected on-ramps from other, complementary Web sites? Or maybe 
you’re getting a bunch of folks from one of the local industry blogs. 
Whatever you discover will help you make your primary source of traf-
fic one to exploit even further and spur you to make your secondary 
sources more productive.
 
✓ Determine whether your lead generation efforts are working: Did your 
last e-mail blast produce the number of form completions you were 
hoping for? Is the new online form you’re using to get people to sign up 
for a free estimate converting prospects into leads? Or are more people 
contacting you by phone after visiting your site? Answer questions like 
these, and you’ll know what to fix and what to leave as is.
 
✓ Evaluate the effectiveness of your online advertising: If, for instance, 
you’re spending a lot on search engine ads and keyword buys, you want 
to know which ones are performing for you and which aren’t. Here again, 
Web analytics ride to the rescue and point you toward better ads or key-
words, or at least a smarter allocation of your advertising dollars.

73
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
 
Having even a rough idea of the sort of measurements you want to take before 
your site is built makes taking those measurements easier down the line. For 
example, you can design and arrange your site’s content into independent 
chunks, or modules, each of which are relatively simple to measure to find out 
whether it’s working hard or sleeping on the job. In the latter case, swap in 
better, more productive modules without doing a major site overhaul.
Creating a Framework for Success
Creating a strong and effective local business Web site is often a lot like 
designing and writing a sales brochure. In either case, start by figuring out 
what you want to say and how to portray your product or service offering in 
the best light. Then, group these thoughts and ideas into logical categories of 
information and arrange them within the space you have. Finally, add color 
and graphical elements like your logo, prominently display your address and 
phone number somewhere, and you’re pretty much done.
One difference between a brochure and a Web site though, is that the latter is 
subject to certain conventions that users expect from any site they visit and 
will automatically expect from yours. For example:
 
✓ Clicking the company’s logo will (almost always) take you back to 
the home page. That doesn’t mean you don’t also include a Home link 
on the pages of your site, just that you better make sure visitors can go 
home via the logo route as well.
 
✓ Business Web sites almost always have an About page that allows 
users to read about the company whose site they’re visiting.
 
✓ Sites generally have a Contact Us page, and those that don’t, need one. 
You want to give prospects as many access routes to your business as 
possible, so consider some sort of Contact Us page a must.
Of course, certain attributes are unique to the online medium, and interactiv-
ity is one of the most important. By letting users interact directly with the 
business behind the site — and/or with other users via a live chat — they 
become significantly more involved in the site, and that can only be good for 
business.
The following sections take a closer look at the elements that comprise an effec-
tive local business Web site and show how each of them needs to function.
Selecting, registering, and hosting a URL
Domain names, or URLs (Web addresses), provide the identity of a Web site. 
Each one is unique, and at this point, a lot of the best names have already 

74
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
been taken — which means that choosing your URL might be harder than 
you’d think.
Ideally, you want to pick a URL that’s the same as your business’s name, or 
a shortened version of it. Failing that, a URL that’s extremely representative 
of your business is okay, though not great. (Dora’s Pets, for example, would 
love to use www.doraspets.com, but could probably make do with www.
doraspetstore.com.) Go too far beyond that, and no one will associate 
your site with your business and then, what’s the point?
 
Make your URL easy to say, spell, type, read, and above all, remember. For 
example, www.socks.com is good (though probably not available), but www.
fuzzythingsinsideyourshoes.com is silly.
You also have to decide what you want your top-level domain name to 
be. This is the name extension or suffix that each site has attached to it. 
Everyone wants the old standby .com as their extension, but it may not be 
available for your URL. That’s why you see more and more sites that end in 
.net, .org, .us, or even .biz. The suffix really isn’t that big a deal as long 
as you can somehow impress on the public consciousness that your site has 
a different extension than .com.
After you settle on the domain name you want to use, you need to find out 
whether it’s available. When you have an available URL in hand, you’re 
almost home free. All you need to do is register it and get it hosted, neither 
of which is particularly tough. Register simply means taking ownership of 
the URL, which generally costs from $10–$30 a year. Hosting, meanwhile, is 
the process of retaining space on a server that provides connectivity to the 
Internet.
And the really great news is that a lot of domain-name registrar companies 
can handle the name-checking, registration, and hosting jobs for you, and 
they don’t charge you very much for the service (figure around $13 a month 
for the whole package). Some of the better registrar/hosts are
 
✓ Register.com: www.register.com
 
✓ GoDaddy.com: www.godaddy.com
 
✓ Network Solutions: www.networksolutions.com
 
✓ Active-Domain: www.active-domain.com
 
✓ Domainmonster.com: www.domainmonster.com
 
✓ FatCow Web Hosting: www.fatcow.com
 
✓ FastDomain.com: http://hosting.fastdomain.com
 
✓ Lunarpages: www.lunarpages.com

75
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
Mapping out your information
When you have a URL, you’re ready to start conceiving your Web site. Start 
by developing an outline that’s an overview of the pages within a Web site, 
or a site map. This may sound like a pain, but it keeps you organized and on 
track, both of which you can’t afford not to be.
Finding the perfect URL
Here are some things to know and keep in mind 
when you set out on the Great URL Hunt:
 ✓ Keep your URL short and sweet.
 ✓ Make it memorable; don’t use hyphens or 
numbers unless you’re being held at gun-
point.
 ✓ Although it’s important to pick a URL (if pos-
sible) that’s built on or around your com-
pany name, it’s okay to think beyond your 
name and if possible, to snap up additional 
URLs that may drive business your way. For 
example, if you’re Joe’s Pizza, you’re going 
to want joespizza.com (or .net or 
.biz). But if calzones are a specialty 
you’re known for, you might also want to 
register joescalzones.com. Even if 
you don’t use this alternative right away, it 
may come in handy for a special promotion 
at a later date.
 ✓ Don’t forget the social sites. For instance, 
you could also register on Facebook (maybe 
with something like www.facebook.
com/joespizza). Be aware though that 
Facebook requires a business to have 1,000 
fans before it’ll give you a URL, and some 
other social sites have similar restrictions.
 ✓ If someone improperly — repeat, 
improperly — owns the URL you want and 
that URL is logically connected to your 
business, you can initiate legal action, 
preferably with an attorney who’s familiar 
with Internet-related law. (When the Web 
first started exploding, several dastardly 
squatters bought thousands of domain 
names that other companies would natu-
rally want, hoping to extort huge amounts 
of money from them to get the URLs back. 
Laws were passed quickly saying that 
individuals couldn’t legitimately register a 
trademarked company or product name.)
 ✓ Because registering domains is pretty 
inexpensive to do, consider protecting 
yourself against competition by owning 
as many top-level variations as you can; 
for instance, not just luckyplumbing.
com, but also luckyplumbing.org, 
luckyplumbing.net, and lucky 
plumbing.biz.
 ✓ Consider buying disparaging variations of 
your domain name. A really disgruntled 
customer might register joespizza 
sucks.com — or some other painful and 
embarrassing URL twist. But you can beat 
them to it, provided you can imagine your-
self in their place and just for a moment, 
think like a Neanderthal. Then register what 
you come up with.
 ✓ Including your service, city, or other rele-
vant keywords in your domain name (such 
as joespizzadenver.com) can help 
boost your search engine optimization 
(SEO), a subject we dive into in Chapter 8.

The site map includes a list of each section you want on the site (more on 
this in a bit), along with a description of the content that will appear on each 
page. This map also describes, in as much detail as you can muster, what fea-
tures — such as video or a sign-up form — will go on the site and where.
It’s important that your site map is accessible from somewhere on the site, 
acting as a sort of Table of Contents. Most folks put their site map in the form 
of an outline, with the pages arranged by topic and include a link to the site 
map in the footer of the home page. This gives visitors a good overall picture 
of how the site is organized and clearly defines what resources the Web site 
has to offer. Figure 4-3 shows an example of a site map.

The home page
Your home page is your Web site’s front door; it’s where people will arrive 
when they enter your URL into their browser. The home page’s primary pur-
pose is to present a strong sense of what your business is all about. Need we 
add that, consequently, it’s very important to get the execution of your home 
page 100 percent right?
Typically, visitors to your home page find
 
✓ Your company logo
 
✓ A brief description of what your business does (which is sometimes also 
referred to as your elevator pitch)
 
✓ A menu-type section that lays out the major content areas of your site 
(such as Products, News and Events, Contact Us, and so on)
 
✓ Plenty of links to content within your site so visitors can get easily to 
where they want to go

77
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
In essence, you can think of your home page as the crossroads of your site, 
the central point from which all roads lead to somewhere interesting and 
informative that makes visitors want to be customers. Figure 4-4 shows an 
example of a well-designed home page.

Landing pages
Because local business Web sites focus primarily on generating leads, set 
up pages for people who clicked through to your site from your (stunningly 
effective) online advertising. These are the pages that visitors coming to you 
from online advertising will land on, hence the term landing pages. You can 
consider them the side doors into your site, and like the side doors in most 
houses, they get a lot of traffic passing through them. An example of a land-
ing page is shown in Figure 4-5.
 
Figure 4-5: 
A typical 
landing 
page.
 

79
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
What makes landing pages distinct from your home page is that they’re the 
logical extension of the ad that your prospects rode in on. So although your 
home page gives a good overview of your business’s many attributes and 
abilities, a landing page gets right to a specific point. Landing pages also typi-
cally provide visitors with an opportunity — usually via some kind of sign-up 
form through which they can take you up on some kind of offer — to convert 
themselves into leads.
Here’s an example: You’re a dentist who specializes in teeth whitening, and 
one of your PPC keywords is teeth whitening. When someone clicks your PPC 
ad, it only makes sense to bring her directly to the page on your site that gives 
specific information about teeth whitening rather than make her navigate to 
that information from your home page. Your landing page might even include a 
first-visit offer of some kind to motivate these prospects to take action.
Nine times out of ten, a landing page is about one product or service that you 
provide, and in that sense, it’s the real meat-and-potatoes of your business. 
So, if you’re a local hardware store, one landing page might be about the 
array of tools you have for sale, one about the equipment you rent out, and 
one about the lawnmower tune-up service you provide.
Because landing pages are so important — not only for lead capture but also 
from an organic search standpoint — we talk a lot more about them in Chapter 5.
The About page
The About (or sometimes About Us) page is a fixture on most business Web 
sites, and for good reason. Remember that you want your Web site to create 
and solidify a relationship with a customer. Therefore, spend some time 
establishing your credibility and creating rapport with your prospect — and 
the About page is where to do it.
This is particularly true when you’re focused on selling a service because 
that usually entails a long-term relationship with a customer than the simple 
(and often quicker) product sale. In either case, relationship-building is 
important, which is why you use your About page to tell folks who the 
owners of your business are, how long you’ve been doing what you do, and 
how you view the value of the product or service you provide. You can also 
use this space to show pictures of you and your staff. Here you become an 
actual person for visitors to feel good about dealing with.
The Product or Services page
The Products or Services page presents specific descriptions of what you 
offer. If you’re a dentist, your Services page (which you might choose to call 
Dental Procedures) would most likely include details about cleanings, com-
posite fillings, veneers, bonding, crowns, and so on. If you’re a power-tool 
dealer, on the other hand, your Products page would probably include a 
roster of the Black and Decker, Skil, and DeWalt tools you carry. You might 
also use your Product or Services page to tell prospects about your delivery 
procedures and any guarantees or warranties you provide.

The Testimonials page
Having a Testimonials page is optional, but it can be highly effective in estab-
lishing your business’s credibility. Ask your satisfied customers (of whom 
you no doubt have legions) to scribble down some nice things they have to 
say about your company that you can then post (with permission, of course) 
on your site to convince new prospects that folks just like them have found 
you a great source of whatever it is you’re a great source of. The more testi-
monial you can put on your site, the better. They just work.
A Gallery or Portfolio page
A Gallery or Portfolio page is a near-must for service businesses whose work 
has a highly visual aspect to it. Are you a bathroom and kitchen remodeler? 
Put up before and after photos of some of your jobs. Ditto for landscapers, 
house painters, and even dentists. Before and after images can make an 
extremely powerful and memorable point — and also do wonders for your 
credibility.
The Contact page
A Contact (or Contact Us) page is essential, no matter what you’re selling. 
Include your phone number, your physical and e-mail addresses, and a short 
contact form where the prospect can provide his name, phone number, and 
e-mail address. The Contact page gives people a variety of ways to reach you, 
and that makes it a rock-solid must. Figure 4-6 shows how a Contact page 
might appear.
The footer
The footer is the content that appears at the bottom of each page of your 
Web site (refer to the earlier figures in this chapter — each sample page 
includes a footer at the bottom). Here most users expect the fine print, such 
as legal information about terms and conditions, privacy policies, and so on. 
Most footers provide immediate links or shortcuts to other areas of the site.
Inclusion of these links or shortcuts can be a big help to prospects who want 
to burrow into your site without scrolling up the page to the standard menus. 
Commonly, the links/shortcuts provided in the footer are
 
✓ Customer Service
 
✓ Satisfaction Guarantee
 
✓ Terms and Conditions
 
✓ Privacy Policy
 
✓ Site Map

81
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
The footer is also where a lot of Web designers and developers leave their 
signatures as a link that connects to their own Web sites, just in case visitors 
want to, you know, hire them or something.

The privacy policy
Most businesses put their privacy policy in the footer, although some feel 
it’s important enough to have its own page. In either case, having a privacy 
policy has become increasingly important as more and more disreputable 
people have figured out how to use a company’s Web site to grab the 
addresses of innocent folks whom they can then harass.
Your privacy policy discloses how you plan to use any customer data that 
you collect from prospects while converting them into leads. This includes 
information you get from e-mail sign-ups or any other online forms that you 
use. For example, if you collect someone’s e-mail address, let that person 
know you won’t share it willy-nilly with other parties. Helpfully, several pri-
vacy policy generators can supply you with a free policy language that’s been 
well-established as sound and effective. A couple of these are
 
✓ Direct Marketing Association: www.dmaresponsibility.org/PPG
 
✓ FreePrivacyPolicy.com: www.freeprivacypolicy.com
Do your customers have your number?
For many local businesses — especially one- or 
two-person operations — you may be tempted 
not to put a contact phone number on the Web 
site and just provide an e-mail address instead. 
Posting a phone number means that someone 
has to be available to take incoming calls, 
which can be a bit labor-intensive.
Resist this temptation. For every good reason 
you may have to omit a phone number, you 
have a whole bunch of prospective customers 
who’d rather talk to you than use e-mail. And 
they have their reasons:
 ✓ A phone call that someone makes is relatively 
anonymous. She doesn’t have to give you her 
name, so you can’t bother her in the future.
 ✓ Businesses that are exceptionally slow in 
responding to e-mail inquiries have given 
e-mail use a bad name. People are on your 
site now, they’re interested now, they have 
a question now, and they may even be 
ready to buy now. Respond a week or even 
a day later, and that train may have already 
left the station.
 ✓ People like using the phone because some-
times their questions are too complicated 
to state properly in written form, and it’s 
going to take a conversation with you to get 
them answered fully. (Plus, a conversation 
is a great way to start building a prospect’s 
trust and confidence in you.)
In a nutshell, the phone is your friend, and you 
may just be shafting yourself if you take it out 
of the mix. The moral: Make sure your phone 
number is prominently displayed on your site.

 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
Setting the Mood: The Right 
Look and Feel
Your business competes for every potential customer in your market — and 
so does your Web site. That means your site had better look like a prime 
contender — no sloppy graphics, shabby layouts, typos (especially typos!), 
or poor color choices. Any of those just look, frankly, awful — and makes you 
look unprofessional at best.
Your site has also to feel right, which means welcoming, yet highly efficient. 
The average consumer is savvy and short on time. So you have to make it 
easy for her to learn more about your business and your specific products 
and services. The Golden Rule is to design your Web site from your custom-
er’s perspective, not from yours — and that means making it extremely clear, 
logical, and easy to use.
Look and feel basics
The following points can help you decide how your site needs to look and work:
 
✓ Think of your logo as a jumping-off point. What does your logo say 
about your business? What colors does it use? What personality does 
it convey? If your business is a person, would that person be friendly? 
Aggressive? Sophisticated? Down to earth? Does your logo reflect that? If 
not, get help — fast.
 
✓ Use color wisely. If you already have a great logo, chances are it has 
some colors in it, and if so, you’re probably well on your way to figuring 
out what colors to use throughout your Web site. Follow that impulse 
because the right colors can help tie together your site nicely. If your 
logo is black and white, pick some other suitable colors; it makes a 
world of difference. Imagine what sort of colors your customers want. A 
law firm might go for grays and dark blues to suggest solidity and trust-
worthiness, whereas a florist might opt for bright, vibrant colors to sug-
gest beauty, health, and growth. And so on. Oh — and people have used 
black type on a white (or very, very light) background for eons because 
it’s eminently legible. Don’t force your customers to read, blue type on a 
purple background, or you run the risk of making your customers, quite 
literally, sick.
 
✓ A picture says a thousand words. Imagery has long been known to com-
municate with great power, so use photos or illustrations to enrich and 
enliven the information you present. Not only are pictures often more 
involving than language, they also allow would-be customers to visualize 
how well a particular product or service will serve them in reality.

84
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
✓ Keep it easy on the eyes! Like the black-text-on-white-background rule, 
some things just work and other things just don’t. Serif fonts (the ones 
with little hooks and swirls hanging off the characters) read very well 
only if they’re large, whereas sans-serif fonts (the letters without any 
doodads) are easy to read in any size. Don’t use too many different fonts 
or font sizes on your site pages. Establish a simple hierarchy of sizes, 
depending on the importance of the words, and use two different fonts 
at most. For instance, decide that your headline (the copy at the top of 
the page that announces what the page is about) will always be the larg-
est size, the subheads that set off sections will be the next largest, and 
the body text will be the smallest font size.
 
✓ Make contact information clearly visible. Make sure your site’s visitors 
can contact you easily. Give them your e-mail address, your business 
phone and fax numbers, your physical address (and mailing address 
if it’s different), and any other relevant information (like your store or 
phone-answering hours). And make sure this information is highly vis-
ible on — and easily accessible from — every page of your site.
 
✓ Add a personal touch. Include photos of your office, your staff, and your 
company mascot. (Hint: Weasels make lousy company mascots.) On the 
other hand, don’t go overboard. The point is to put a face behind the 
name, without getting too chummy. This is one of those subjective areas 
where you recognize the right balance when you’ve struck it.
Common Web site design mistakes
Make sure you avoid the following mistakes when you’re planning and design-
ing your site’s look and feel:
 
✓ Don’t get addicted to glitz. In a nutshell, don’t put in anything that gets 
in the way of the sale or otherwise causes confusion, especially if it’s 
gratuitous. Graphically speaking, the best advice we can offer is when in 
doubt, leave it out.
 
✓ Don’t be too formal. Use every day, conversational language. The more 
relaxed prospects feel on your site, the greater the chance they’ll buy 
from you. Remember that the Internet is a two-way medium. Hold up 
your end of the conversation by writing the same way that you speak — 
and don’t, as grandmothers everywhere used to say, put on airs.
 
✓ Don’t be too folksy. Adopting an aw-shucks tone may help you sell a 
jackknife, but not orthodontia. Write as you speak, but also as your 
customers speak.
 
✓ Don’t be long-winded. Make your sentences short, punchy, and to-the-
point. Use bullets whenever possible. Try to make the reader’s eye flow 
down the page rather than across it. People’s eyes are naturally drawn 
to text that’s set apart from the rest.

85
 Chapter 4: Building a Great Web Site
 
✓ Don’t be disorganized. Place important information at the top of the 
page, such as calls to action, promotions, or other key information. Put 
the good stuff too far down and you may as well leave it out altogether.
 
✓ Don’t jam in too much information on any one page. You can add as 
many pages as you want to your Web site. Spread out the information 
you present into readable, comprehensible chunks.
 
✓ Don’t be indirect. This is no place to get cagey. Make sure that custom-
ers can easily find the information they’re after by using clear menus, 
site maps, and section/page titles. Don’t hide your offer — or hide the 
vehicle that people can use to respond to it — in some easy-to-overlook 
place.
 
✓ Don’t be unbalanced. Too many graphics can frustrate a reader’s 
thirst for information. Too much text can put him into a stupor. As in 
all things, so the ancient Greeks told us, the Golden Mean is what you 
should strive for — a nice, workable, attractive balance.
 
✓ Don’t let your Web site content get old. You’ll often run across a busi-
ness site in which it’s obvious that no one’s refreshed the content since it 
was first put up. Talk about looking irrelevant. Revisit your own site regu-
larly and see what needs updating. (Then, of course, actually update it.) 
That gives your customers a reason to keep checking to see what’s new.
Striking the Perfect Balance between 
Information and Promotion
To be truly good, a Web site has to be both informational and promotional. 
Where do you draw the line between the two? Well, it isn’t an exact science, 
but some ways of looking at are
 
✓ The information you present must be useful and actionable:
 
• Useful means that information is useful to the customer. Useful really 
amounts to saying that something has a benefit.
 
 You can easily get benefits confused with features. Say you sell 
home theatre equipment. One of the things your Web site talks 
about is that all the audio and video cables you sell have gold-
plated connectors. That’s a feature. But what sort of benefit does 
gold plating provide? The answer is that gold is an extraordinarily 
good conductor of electricity — so it gives superior clarity to 
audio and video signals. See? Gold plating is the feature. Better 
clarity is the benefit.

86
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
 Some sellers of products or services think that just stating the fea-
tures of what they offer is enough. However, until you carry this a 
step further by stating what benefit that feature creates, your infor-
mation isn’t really useful.
 
• Actionable means that the information must be something that cre-
ates interest on the prospect’s part to do something — and therefore, 
to get involved with your local business. Touting gold-plated cables 
that make for clearer signals is just academic unless you carry 
them, sell them, and have them in stock for immediate delivery 
(or can get them in quickly). If you do, your customers now have 
something they can act on: They can stop in and pick up some of 
those great cables or maybe even have you install them.
 
✓ The promotion you use to induce action must be relevant.
 
 Promotion is simply what sellers of goods or services use to inspire 
potential customers to act. Promotion is usually an offer of some kind 
that customers can take advantage of if they act — and act soon. But 
that offer must be relevant to the consumer. Buy a Set of Gold-Plated 
Cables and Receive a Free Squirrel Pelt won’t induce much activity. On 
the other hand, Buy a Set of Gold-Plated Cables Online Today and Get 
20% Off is a winner because it’s highly relevant.
When in doubt, keep the obvious in mind: Getting something for nothing or at 
a substantial savings is always relevant — so much so that any other kind of 
offer doesn’t even come close. People like money. Give them some of yours 
(or something that has monetary value) and they’ll give you some of theirs. 
If you want people to take a specific action, put a relevant offer — usually a 
monetary one — on your site to induce exactly that action.
Maybe you think that much of what’s in this section is too elementary to 
need saying, much less explaining. Remember what we warn about earlier in 
this chapter: When you step into online marketing, your Web site can easily 
end up as an endless empty canvas that you fill with any and all kinds of self-
serving ego food. That’s absolutely the wrong approach, but it happens far 
too often. (One telltale sign that you’ve gone over the edge is if your About 
page runs longer than your Products page.)
 
The key is to stay disciplined. What’s the benefit of what you sell and how 
can you induce people to buy it? If virtually every page of your Web site isn’t 
answering one of those two questions, look at that page again. Odds are you’ll 
find it’s just cluttering the canvas.

n Chapter 4, we describe how to create an effective Web site for your busi-
ness. But just having a site doesn’t get you very far. What you actually put 
on the site has to work hard if you’re going to succeed at converting visitors 
into customers.
Among the hardest working Web site elements are landing pages. We talk 
a bit about these little gems in Chapter 4, but here, we look at exactly what 
makes them tick and succeed. And why are they that important? Because 
although not a lot has officially been published on the matter, in our experi-
ence working with thousands of small businesses, landing pages can increase 
conversion rates by 8–10 percent over the rates generated by home pages 
alone. (In case you’re keeping score, that increase represents nearly double 
the normal home page rate.) And who can overlook the potential to land up 
to twice as much business with relatively little effort?
But that’s just the start. Several other, commonly used site elements can play 
a big part, too. These range from the lowly-but-ever-potent coupon, to chats, 
to online video. Getting these site elements up and working doesn’t take all 
that much time or expense, but their combined effect can be amazing. In fact, 
you could actually double your conversion rate (again!) after you get your 
site running on all its various and hyper-effective cylinders.

88
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
The key is that every site element you use has to go toward engaging your 
prospects. Engage them, and you can convert them. Convert them, and you 
can get them to buy whatever you’re selling. Before you can cross that par-
ticular goal line, you need to capture some specific information from them. 
We discuss just what that information is and then describe the ways you can 
use it to (hurrah, hurrah) close the deal.
Implementing Proven Landing 
Page Techniques
When any technology has been around long enough, it becomes apparent 
through use that some ways of working with that technology are effective 
and others aren’t. Bundle together the things that work, and you have what 
stuffy folks refer to as best practices.
Defining landing page and home page
A landing page is a type of Web page that someone automatically goes to 
when they click an online ad or type in a URL they discovered elsewhere. 
Landing pages are designed to be highly relevant to whatever messaging got 
the consumer to the site in the first place. (See Figure 5-1 for an example.)
 
Figure 5-1: 
A landing 
page gives 
your Web 
site visitors 
immediate 
access to 
the informa-
tion they’re 
after.
 

89
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
The logic behind landing pages is pretty unassailable. Something about your 
ad — some language, some offer, and so on — motivated consumers to visit 
your site, and the landing page they come to picks up right where the ad left 
off. The subject is the same but is explained in greater detail. The page seam-
lessly continues the train of thought that the ad sparked, and that in turn, 
keeps customers right on track to where you want to take them.
A home page is usually the main page — or, as the techies would say, the 
highest level — of a Web site. The home page offers a global view of the 
entire site, which makes it a sort of visual table of contents. Visitors to your 
home page use the links they find there to get to more specific sub-pages of 
the site. The home page, therefore, is the central point from which all paths 
lead to somewhere else, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Simple. The home page is about familiarizing visitors with your business as 
a whole. A landing page is about converting customers who want to know 
about a single facet of your business that attracted their attention when they 
saw it in one of your ads. The former is general. The latter is specific.

A home 
page is the 
hub of a 
Web site.

Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
Using the power of landing pages
Landing pages are consistently effective at increasing conversions for several 
reasons:
 
✓ Specificity and relevance: A visitor who follows a link in (or from) an 
ad — be it a traditional media ad, search ad, banner ad, or some other 
kind — immediately hits the landing page and finds exactly what she’s 
looking for right off the bat. Because that page gives specific information 
about whatever initially spurred the visit, it’s highly relevant to the visi-
tor. She gets the info in an instant — no muss, no fuss — and that leads 
to increased conversions.
 
✓ Simplicity: Because landing pages are so specific, they can also be very 
concise, which tends to keep a visitor’s eyes on the prize (the prize in 
this case is the call to action). The page aims a visitor straight at the 
conversion method — the call or click — you want him to use. A home 
page has lots of stuff on it, and that equals a lot of potential for distrac-
tion. But a landing page has but one thought in its head, a thought that 
can’t be mistaken or easily veered from. All that’s left is for the visitor to 
take the action you’ve specified on the page, and many visitors do.
 
✓ Easy to test and optimize: The elements of a good landing page are so 
specific and so few, it’s a simple matter to test them and then to swap 
out what isn’t working particularly well for something more effective. 
Analytical tools, which we discuss in Chapter 6, can tell you exactly 
which elements on the page are pulling their weight in generating 
conversions. You can even track the number of phone calls the page 
inspires. And as you find out more, you can consistently improve your 
page — and, of course, your return on investment (ROI). Among the 
elements you can test are
 
• Different headlines
 
• Different graphics, including photos
 
• Different offers; for example, Buy One, Get One Free; Free Shipping; 
or 40% Off
Understanding the elements of 
the landing page experience
The elements that make a truly effective landing page are

91
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
 
✓ The call to action: Every landing page needs to tell the visitor how he 
can act now. A good call to action
 
• Uses verbs that suggest the action you want the reader to take, 
such as call, buy, visit, read, sign up, and the like.
 
• Adds the subject of the offer and a benefit of that offer. Call Now 
for Our Time-Saving Widgets, for instance, touches all the bases: 
Widgets is the subject, Time-Saving is the benefit, Call Now is the 
action the reader’s being asked to take.
 
• Imparts a sense of urgency that makes readers want to act now 
instead of tomorrow or next week, such as Offer Expires Tomorrow 
(assuming the offer actually does expire tomorrow) often works well.
 
✓ Value messaging: Every landing page needs to explain clearly, even 
bluntly, the value of your business and/or your offer. (See the discussion 
of your unique selling proposition [USP] in Chapter 3.) State what makes 
you unique, or at least special enough to make readers want to act on 
your offer and start engaging with your company. For example:
 
• Are you the fastest or cheapest?
 
• Is the quality of your products or services superior to your com-
petitors’ quality?
 
• Have you been in business longer than your competitors, and as a 
result, are you smarter, more experienced, more professional than 
they are?
 
• Do you provide some sort of added value (say, a free rosebush 
with the purchase of six 50-pound bags of mulch)?
 
• Are you #1 in your market in terms of sales, customer satisfaction, 
and repeat business?
 
✓ The reason to buy: Every landing page should tell visitors what’s in it 
for them, namely, the features and benefits of what you sell. We provide 
a feature versus benefit distinction in Chapter 4, but Table 5-1 offers a 
quick refresher.

92
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
✓ Trust and credibility incidentals: Every landing page is an opportunity 
to overcome buyer skepticism and build trust. A common way to accom-
plish this is by including quick (but glowing) customer testimonials, rel-
evant awards, or professional accreditations, such as:
 
• If you’re a member of the Better Business Bureau, add their logo to 
your pages.
 
• If you won the Best in Town award from your local newspaper, say 
so on your landing pages.
 
• If you’ve been around for 10, 20, 30, 50 years, or more, say so.
Please note that we call these things incidentals because they result from 
your being in business while not actually being a part of your business. But 
that doesn’t mean they aren’t important.
Engaging Customers with 
Two-Way Communication
Most traditional advertising media provide one-way communication. The 
TV or radio talks, you listen, end of story. Print ads are equally one-sided. 
The result is that consumers can’t really participate in the conversation and 
engage with the brand.
That’s one key reason why online advertising can be so effective: It really is 
a two-way street, and your customers can participate in whatever you have 
going on. Maybe they take part in a poll or a survey you run, use your special 
calculator to figure out something complicated, post to a bulletin or a blog, 
or engage in real-time chat.
Understanding and implementing chat
Chat allows two or more Web users to communicate with each other in real time 
with text. Chat usually takes one of two forms: Live chat and proactive chat.
Live chat
Live chat is often used for sales and customer support. A customer types a 
question into a space on the Web site and gets an answer back right away. 
(The reason for the speedy response is that companies usually have a knowl-
edgeable person or two ready to field chat inquiries.) Among the benefits of 
live chat is that the customer doesn’t have to leave the Web site to ask his 
questions. He doesn’t have to pick up the phone or physically visit the com-
pany’s location. Three other nice benefits are

93
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
 
✓ Quicker answers than with e-mail: E-mails (and voicemails) pile up 
quickly on the company’s side of things, and the traffic jams that result 
can mean that forward progress becomes very sloooowww. But chat 
gets answered much faster. Type in a one-sentence question, and the 
answer returns at the speed of typing.
 
✓ A paper trail: The conversations a customer has with a business’s rep-
resentative compile on the screen. At any point, the customer (or the 
representative) can save or print the entire conversation and have a 
record in writing.
 
✓ Personalizes the business: Chat goes a long way in letting customers 
know you care about them and their interests in what you sell. They 
ask, you answer. They ask more, you answer more. And so it goes. 
Conversation — even if it’s just in the form of text — puts a personality 
on the business, and what better way to engage a prospect and start 
building that all-important relationship with them?
Figure 5-3 shows what a typical chat window looks like.
 
Figure 5-3: 
You and 
your 
customers

window that 
appears on 
your Web 
site.
 
Proactive chat
Here’s how proactive chat works. A prospect dabbles on your Web site when 
a pop-up appears that invites him to chat. He doesn’t have to perform any 
action; the opportunity to converse is just presented to him, all ready to go. 
(Think of it like the old Operators Are Standing By . . . message you used to 
hear on commercials except in this case, the operator initiates the interac-
tion.) The pop-up is usually accompanied by a small chat window that floats 
within the browser window and lets the customer decide whether to accept 
or reject the chat.

94
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
Proactive chat might seem a little too pushy, but it’s no more intrusive than 
what a salesperson does in a typical brick-and-mortar store. In that case, a 
customer wanders through the store, the salesperson approaches and asks, 
“Can I help you?” The customer either says, “Yes, I have a question about . . .” 
or, “No thanks, just looking.” Just like in the brick-and-mortar world, after the 
salesperson talks with the customer online, good things can easily happen.
Raising your conversion rate with chat
When you get customers involved in either kind of chat, your conversion 
rates can rise significantly. Here’s why:
 
✓ The captive audience factor: The longer visitors engage in a helpful dia-
logue, the less likely they are to abruptly leave your Web site — and the 
greater the opportunity for you to initiate or close a sale.
 
✓ Generation of sales leads: A chatting customer is a lead, pure and 
simple. In the course of the conversation, you discover the nature and 
intensity of his interest. From there, it’s a small step to asking that cus-
tomer if you can get back to him later with more information he might 
find interesting. If he says “Sure,” voila! You have a live one.
The wonders of chat
Making use of two-way conversation has some 
big benefits. Forrester Research, a company 
that conducts technology and market research 
for major corporations, created a sample 
company with an instant two-way commu-
nication chat system to respond to Web site 
customers who wanted product information. 
Approximately 75 percent of the chat interac-
tions that occurred represented contact with 
the company that wouldn’t have otherwise hap-
pened via phone or e-mail.
Companies with Web sites that include only 
a phone number and an e-mail address often 
discover that their Internet customers are 
impatient with those communication methods. 
According to another Forrester report, 25 per-
cent of those intending to complete an appli-
cation for an insurance quote abandoned the 
idea because they didn’t feel that a call or an 
e-mail to the company would give them enough 
information to justify applying. Fast as it can be, 
e-mail is apparently considered by many con-
sumers to be too slow, whereas phone contact 
is seen as too hit or miss when it comes to 
reaching the person with the right information.
Put together these two views, and you can see 
why chat can be a particularly effective way 
to go — though that doesn’t mean that every 
business can benefit from it. A two-person 
locksmith shop, for instance, is likely to have 
people out on calls a good deal of the time, so 
they aren’t available to chat. On the other hand, 
a large beauty salon probably has a reception 
staff, any of whom could be the business’s des-
ignated chatter.

✓ Plucking customers from the depths of confusion: Getting a prospec-
tive customer straight on the benefit of your product or service does 
you both a favor. The prospective customer comes away a lot more 
informed and, probably, a little grateful. In the course of your conversa-
tion, not only can you potentially do some real business, but the pros-
pect can also alert you as to any problems she’s having with your Web 
site — problems that you can then promptly fix to make future, site-
based interactions with other customers more productive.
Letting the pros set up a chat feature
Chatting may be simple, but setting up the mechanics (such as the computer 
coding) isn’t. The good news is that it isn’t expensive to get a chat feature up 
and running. In some cases, doing so is even free.
Some chat providers worth checking out are
 
✓ BlastChat: www.blastchat.com
 
✓ Olark: www.olark.com
 
✓ ClickAndChat.com: www.clickandchat.com
 
✓ WebsiteAlive: www.websitealive.com
 
✓ Activa Live Chat: www.activalive.com
 
Helpful and productive as chat can be, here’s the downside: Someone has 
to man it. If your organization doesn’t have a designated chatter — an office 
manager maybe, or someone who’s nearly always on a computer — the whole 
immediacy thing disappears, and your chat feature becomes just another 
bottleneck. If you’re planning to use chat, make sure you have a plan in place 
to support it.
Using proper chat etiquette
Like just about everything else in life, chat has its own rules of the road. 
Which is to say, chat demands the proper behavior (although it can be done 
with your mouth open and your elbows on the desk, so there’s two thing you 
don’t have to worry about).
The tips that follow can help you communicate via chat more effectively and 
by doing so, convert more prospects into paying customers:
 
✓ Use a businesslike screen name and avatar: Funky, funny screen names 
are fine for casual conversations with your friends, but a business envi-
ronment requires seriousness. Don’t use Zoltan the Crusher of Worlds, 
just use Phil (assuming your name is Phil). The same goes for any avatars 

96

(a photo or other graphic that shows next to your screen name) you use. 
Sorry, exploding ninjas are out. Something related to your business is the 
way to go. Figure 5-4 shows several business-appropriate avatars, assuming 
you have a photography business, fruit stand, or landscaping business.

✓ Introduce yourself: At the start of any chat, introduce yourself by name. 
Giving your title — if you have one — is always a good idea, too. This 
is really no different than what you do when you initiate a phone call. 
For example, “Hi, this is Larry Levine from Levine Limousine Service” is 
good, whereas just saying, “Hi there” doesn’t cut it.
 
✓ Don’t SHOUT: Some people think that WRITING EVERYTHING IN 
UPPERCASE is a surefire way to get attention, and it is — if you want 
people to think you’re an idiot. Writing in uppercase is considered 
shouting, hyper-aggressive, and rude. Unless you’re warning of an immi-
nent missile attack, keep your messages in sentence case.
 
✓ Avoid jargon, slang, and abbreviations: Here again, what flies in your 
personal correspondence doesn’t necessarily work in business chats. 
Jargon, slang, and abbreviations may just make you seem unprofessional 
or worse, if the customer isn’t in on the lingo — and can make the whole 
conversation way too confusing. On the other hand, if the customer 
starts slinging the slang, feel free to indulge in it. In that case, you’ll 
come across as seriously cool. But let the customer lead; otherwise, 
dare to be (a little) dull.
 
✓ Don’t use custom fonts, text sizes, and colors: We don’t want to burst 
your balloon on this, but message text in 22-point hot-pink italic doesn’t 
look good and it isn’t easily readable. This is no place to get overly cre-
ative or make your customer put on shades to cut the glare coming off 
your fonts. Just stick to standard type/size/color messaging fonts.
 
✓ Don’t end the conversation without asking for business: Don’t assume 
that just because you think the chat is over, your customer does. At 
some point in the conversation, you customer may need a few minutes 
to compose her next response, so don’t go bowling. Stay at your com-
puter until you’re absolutely sure the chat has ended. The best way 
to do that is to summarize the discussion that’s gone before, identify 
any action items that have come up, ask the other person whether she 
has any more questions, and then ask for business! That doesn’t mean 
asking the prospect whether you can deliver the truckload of wet con-
crete tomorrow at noon, but it does mean asking whether she wants to 
make an appointment for a store visit or maybe even a consultation at 

97
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
her home or business. You want to walk away from the conversation 
with something that brings you closer to a sale. Oh, and whether the 
prospect accepts or refuses, remember to thank her for her time.
 
✓ Monitor your company’s live chat conversations: If someone in your 
company other than you engages in business chats, review those 
conversations for purposes of quality control. This isn’t spying. This 
is making sure that your business is properly and professionally rep-
resented. Happily, most chat software applications let you store and 
retrieve transcripts; some of them even send these transcripts to you 
automatically via e-mail.
Effectively Using Interactive Elements
One proven way to inspire action, improve customer conversion rates, and 
boost sales is by using interactive goodies (or bells and whistles). These can 
run the gamut from the purely functional to the fun and flashy, though the 
two most common are
 
✓ Online coupons: Coupons may seem like a throwback, but they still 
work very hard and very well. Apparently, the get-something-for-nothing-
or-at-least-for-less impulse is coded into human DNA. This is excellent 
news for anyone who’s selling anything.
 
✓ Online video: You can offer visitors an immersive multimedia experi-
ence that creates interest in and spurs involvement with your business. 
Plus, putting this kind of thing together can be fun.
Your first response to going the goodies route might be that they’re bound 
to be too expensive or too complicated for a local business to use. Fear not: 
You’ll find that these online technologies are well within the reach of even 
the most budget-conscious local business.
Online coupons
As more and more value-seeking Americans join the online community, the 
use of online coupons — like the one shown in Figure 5-5 — is rising exponen-
tially. Coupon use helps incline people to try new products or services and 
most important, to cheerfully turn over their e-mail addresses and other con-
tact information to the company offering the coupon.
In this brave new Internet world, businesses are also finding new and effec-
tive ways to put coupons to work. Often businesses send consumers a 
coupon by e-mail that they can then print out and take to a store. Coupons 
delivered in banner ads are another new wrinkle, and not unexpectedly, cou-
pons are now showing up on mobile devices.

Ah, the power of coupons
Here are a few items you need to consider 
while you ponder the possible use of coupons 
for your local business:
 ✓ Experian Simmons (the Bible of the adver-
tising industry) reports that 87 percent of all 
shoppers use coupons.
 ✓ According to The Nielsen Company, an 
independent marketing research firm, 95 
percent of shoppers like coupons and 60 
percent actively seek them out.
 ✓ Since 2005, online coupon usage has grown 
39 percent, according to Experian Simmons 
Research and Coupons, Inc.
 ✓ The Wall Street Journal reports that 
coupon use rises sharply when the nation’s 
economy declines.
Here are a couple more interesting little tidbits 
from Experian Simmons:
 ✓ Nearly 58 percent of online coupon users 
believe that the businesses offering coupons 
care about keeping them as customers.
 ✓ More than 70 percent of online coupon 
users say they’d be willing to provide their 
e-mail addresses and their first and last 
names to a business offering a coupon 
worth $2 or more.
 ✓ More than 70 percent of online coupon 
users say they’re more likely to open an 
e-mail if a coupon is offered, and 64 per-
cent are more likely to click a banner ad or 
search a listing if they know that the Web 
site is offering a coupon.

99
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
Businesses that use online coupons have a lot of good, practical reasons to 
do so. Here are six of them:
 
✓ Online coupons can expand a business’s marketing area. This occurs 
because consumers will travel significant distances to redeem them 
(provided they see the coupons as valuable).
 
✓ Coupons help entice new customers that have been shopping at com-
petitors’ sites. Consumers will readily break with their routine shopping 
patterns to take advantage of a good coupon offer.
 
✓ Coupons attract new residents of an area. People who’ve just moved 
in are usually in high-consumption mode and are on the lookout for 
local product and service resources. Not only can coupons turn a newly 
arrived customer into a long-term one, but they can also help reactivate 
former customers if a business gives them a solid, value-rich reason to 
reconsider their earlier defection.
 
✓ Coupons often have a ripple effect. A customer who redeems a coupon 
for product or service A may consequently become sufficiently pleased 
with a local business to also buy products or services B and C — at full-
profit margin — in the future.
 
✓ Coupons build online traffic. Consumers come to know that a business 
routinely offers coupons, so they keep returning to the business’s Web 
site, and pretty obviously, the greater the traffic, the greater the poten-
tial for additional sales.
 
✓ Online coupons are highly measurable. You can relatively easily track 
the number of coupons that people have downloaded (and the number 
of those that have been used) and then judge the effectiveness of the 
offer. Coupon offers that haven’t done as well as expected can then be 
refined to perform better next time.
Online video
Using online video to connect with and engage your customers is exactly the 
kind of thing — innovative, creative, and even a tad aggressive — that makes 
local businesses survive and thrive. Additionally, by posting your videos on 
sites like YouTube, you can get links to your site that can help search engine 
optimization (more on YouTube in Chapter 13 and SEO in Chapter 8). As an 
example of a Web site utilizing video, see Figure 5-6.

Figure 5-6:

done online

a visitor’s 
experience 
with your 
Web site.
 
Before you mentally tick off all the reasons why online video won’t work for 
your business, take a close look at the reasons it will:
 
✓ Video shows you’re real: We aren’t talking Hollywood here. For local 
businesses, slick and polished production quality won’t bring you 
customers because the secret in this case is to be real. A simple, down-
to-earth production that lets customers really see you as the earnest 
company that you are is precisely what generates a personal connection 
between you and your customers.
 
 Different experts recommend different lengths for a short-form video, 
but don’t let that confuse you. A good guideline is to aim between 30 
seconds and 3 minutes long. Your video needs to be long enough to pro-
vide customers with specific information to act on, but not so long that 
you bore them. Just remember: You don’t need to say everything in one 
little video.
 
✓ Video doesn’t cost much to make: Local business owners can create 
effective videos and upload them to the Internet for just a few hundred 
dollars. Maybe you have a small handheld video camera that you use 
to capture the cute things your kids do. If not, you can usually rent (or 
borrow) one. That’s virtually all you need.
 
 Although you can easily point a video camera and hit the Record button, 
a lot more is involved in making an acceptable video. If you have any 
doubts about your ability as a filmmaker, you’re better off having it done 
by someone with experience. Otherwise, you’re likely to wind up with a 
piece that’s pretty embarrassing.

101
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
Armed with your trusty video camera, here are five ways you can produce 
videos that are truly worth producing — and that can significantly move your 
sales needle:
 
✓ Use product demonstrations: Say your business sells lawn care prod-
ucts. Now, a lot of insecticides and weed-control stuff has to be used 
just right to do their job and produce a lush, beautiful lawn. The proper 
application of your products is a perfect subject for a video. (Better yet, 
you could make one application video for each of the kinds of lawn prod-
ucts you sell and then let visitors to your Web site view the video that 
demonstrates the specific product they’re interested in.) In any case, 
providing this kind of show-and-tell instruction is likely to make a pros-
pect much more likely to buy the product he needs from you. After all, 
you’ve already done him a service — and demonstrated that you really 
know your stuff.
 
✓ Record your people: A short video that introduces your staff and briefly 
profiles them can be an invaluable tool for establishing not just a comfort-
able familiarity with your employees, but trust in your company as well.
 
✓ Spotlight your evangelists: Are you lucky enough to have the kind of 
special customers who sing your praises to their friends and colleagues? 
Most businesses do. If so, plant them in front of your camera and ask 
them to talk. Obviously, you have to ask them very nicely to help you 
out, but if they’re already big fans of your business, getting them to 
agree shouldn’t be difficult. Even if they punctuate their onscreen com-
ments with a lot of “ers” and “uhs,” don’t worry. Those can always be 
edited out later to make almost anyone sound brilliantly articulate.
 
✓ Record special events you’re involved in: Does your business partici-
pate in fundraisers? Do you own a bookstore that puts on a Mystery 
Night every other Thursday? Do you sponsor a float in your town’s 
annual Fourth of July parade? Great. Use video to share those events 
with your online visitors. As a bonus, your thoroughly winning personal-
ity also shines through — plus, you get brownie points for being a such 
a solid, reputable citizen.
 
✓ Show prospects just what it is that you do: Swimming pool owners 
will be very interested in seeing how your pool maintenance business 
accomplishes all the scheduled maintenance tasks that you perform. Dog 
owners will enjoy being walked step-by-step through the dog grooming 
techniques your pet store offers. And so on. You probably won’t have to 
look far for inspiration either. Just take the most common questions you 
get from your customers and turn the answers into videos to put on your 
Web site. Here again, you establish your expertise and build trust. This 
can be a great way to differentiate yourself from your competitors.
 
 Putting subjects like these into a Web-based video presentation isn’t 
expensive, difficult, or particularly time-consuming. But it is a way to put 
the video medium to work for you, promoting your business, establish-
ing customer relationship, and generating increased sales.

102
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
Of course, not everyone’s a Fellini-in-waiting. Maybe you already wonder 
why the videos you shot on your last vacation came out too dark or too 
light, or the horizon was always crooked, or the sound was all muffled. And 
maybe that’s making you think, “I’m really not up to this.”
Pre-think and pre-plan
Shoestring budgets can produce impressive results, but only if you give the 
deal a little quality thinking before you take off the lens cap:
 
✓ Try to see the finished video in your mind. Are green trees in the back-
ground, an office setting, a blank wall, or a street in your town? Forage 
around in your head for what feels right, and odds are you’ll know it 
when you hit on it.
 
✓ Decide whether you’ll hand-hold the camera. A little (make that very 
little) movement in the camera’s visual can be a nice effect. People who 
make documentaries do it all the time because it creates a certain genu-
ineness and immediacy. If you think your video’s going to suggest that 
you were shooting during an earthquake, use a tripod.
 
✓ Make sure you know your camera and its settings. Try it out at home. 
Record video of your family, your dog, a car going by, or the clouds in 
the sky. Figure out how to gauge the proper exposure (although most 
video cameras do this automatically). Listen to the sound quality you’re 
getting. Is it too faint? Then move in. Is it muffled and hard to under-
stand? Then, again, either move in or hook up a cheap microphone to 
that little input found on most video cameras and extend the cord so the 
mic is closer to the audio source.
 
✓ Don’t go nuts with zooming in and out, or panning side to side. The 
object is to make a simple, credible presentation about your company 
and what it does, not to induce nausea.
 
✓ Figure out ahead of time how you’ll edit your footage. Most home com-
puters have at least a simple video-editing program built into them. A lot 
of inexpensive editing software is also available. Remember: As with all 
things highly technical, when in doubt, ask your kids how to do it.
Getting someone else to do it
Admittedly, everything so far about video may sound just a little too intimi-
dating. Okay; no problem. You can usually find a local videographer or video 
company located in your zip code. (Hey, here’s a wacky idea: You could 
search for one on the Internet!) On the other hand, even a good, experienced 
amateur is probably more than up to the job.
If you decide that only a professional will do, however, some great resources 
are out there. Companies like TurnHere, Jivox, and SpotMixer specialize in 
producing video for local and small businesses, and offer reliable turnkey 
solutions for video projects in a variety of formats and durations. They also 
tend to be modestly priced and excellent at giving you fast turnaround from 

103
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
planning, to shooting, to editing, to uploading onto the Web. Not incidentally, 
your video will end up looking and sounding really good.
Some quality providers include
 
✓ TurnHere: These folks can send one of their pros to your location to 
shoot custom videos. (www.turnhere.com)
 
✓ ByteCaster.com: They also shoot custom videos and are very reason-
ably priced (around $395 for a video that runs a minute or so in length). 
(www.bytecaster.com)
 
✓ Jivox: Jivox combines stock footage with your own still photographs to 
make interesting composite videos and offers some services to get your 
videos distributed as well. (www.jivox.com)
 
✓ SpotMixer: They offer the same kind of stock-and-stills video composites 
as Jivox. (www.spotmixer.com)
 
✓ Adfare: Adfare specializes in combining stock footage with your own 
video footage, which can work out very nicely. (www.adfare.com)
Hiring a pro won’t cost you all that much money, especially considering they 
use their own equipment and editing facilities, so you’re saved that expense. 
What’s more, any decent video provider can upload the video onto your 
Web site.
And the best part of all? You come up with the idea, they sweat the details — 
and all’s right with the world.
Capturing Customer Information
One of the things we keep hammering on is that in order to create customers, 
you first have to capture leads. Here are two basic ways to do that with your 
Web site:
 
✓ Use online forms (including, almost always, e-mail opt-in)
 
✓ Use virtual phone services
Online forms
Presenting Web site visitors with an online form to fill out is a proven and 
highly effective method of lead capture. The subject of the form can be any-
thing from a simple Contact Us message to the acceptance of an offer (Sign 
Up and Get Your Dog’s First Grooming — Free!), to a request for a price 
quote. The specifics of the offer almost don’t matter, as long as it’s appropri-
ate to your business.

104
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
What does matter, though, is that you capture the information you need. One 
mistake that some local businesses make is to ask for too much information 
from visitors. Start asking for things like waist size and last vacation spot, 
and things can start getting a little creepy — and can promptly send pros-
pects heading for the exit. On the other hand, you obviously need to gather 
enough information to make the prospect reachable later.
Generally speaking, the most common form fields that local businesses ask 
prospects to fill in are
 
✓ Name
 
✓ E-mail address (and opt-in check box)
 
✓ Phone number
 
✓ The best time to call
 
As we discuss in much greater detail in Chapter 10, include an opt-in device 
when you ask for an e-mail address. The way the law currently stands, you can 
e-mail someone one time whether he opted in or not. But after that one gimme, 
you can send e-mails only if you’ve already (and provably) obtained their per-
mission. A lot of folks get tripped up on this, so it pays to be picky here.
Figure 5-7 shows a typical online form.
 
Figure 5-7: 
An online 
form is an 
excellent 
way to cap-
ture leads.
 
You can also ask prospects a few other questions to further enhance the 
quality of your leads or otherwise help you better gauge their level of inter-
est. A caterer, for example, might ask, “How many people will be attending 
your event?” A guitar teacher could ask, “Which days or nights are you avail-
able for lessons?” A bath remodeler may want to know, “What budget range 
do you have in mind for the job?” And so on.
 
Thou shalt not ask too many questions, or thy prospects shall run away.

105
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
One other very important field you want to include, however, is a place for 
your prospects to leave their comments or questions (typically called — 
what else? — a Comments box). Many people will use it, and what they write 
can give you some very useful information as to who they are and what 
they’re looking for. You can then address their needs and/or questions per-
sonally when you contact them — a great way to demonstrate that you are, 
indeed, paying attention to them as individuals.
Virtual phone services
Probably since its invention, the phone has been a primary tool for captur-
ing leads with good reason. A conversation remains the best way to build 
rapport with customers. They not only get information, but they also get a 
sense of your winning personality and what you’d be like to work with. You 
get a sharper sense of what your customers are interested in and what their 
common questions and concerns are.
But a lot of smaller businesses just don’t have enough staff available to take 
calls all day. For these companies, virtual phone services can be a tremen-
dous help. No matter what the size of your business, they can turn your 
humble little telephone into a rip-snorting, data-gathering colossus.
A virtual phone service simply provides a remarkably easy and affordable way 
to accomplish phone-based online lead capture. (You don’t even need to buy 
any additional hardware.) When you sign up for the service, you immediately 
get your own toll-free or local-area-code number; this becomes your front 
door. To really get the most out of such a service, you can sign up for mul-
tiple numbers, each of which can be used to track incoming calls from differ-
ent parts of your Web site or keyed to different offers you’ve put there. This, 
in turn, helps you measure just how well your site is performing and to make 
improvements as needed.
Most virtual phone services offer other features as well. Probably the most 
popular of these are call logs that give you a complete record of who called, 
who they asked for, the number they used, the date and time the call was 
made, the call’s duration and even, in some cases, what the result of the 
transaction was.
If someone called for a free quote but didn’t leave a message, you have her 
number, and you can call her right back. You can listen to a recording of 
what was said on a given customer call (although the laws in your state may 
restrict this in some cases). You can have all calls coming from your Web site 
seamlessly routed to your cellphone, so you don’t miss a single opportunity. 
In other words, no prospect is left to simply wander off.

Closing the Deal
After you’ve managed to generate qualified leads from the forms and phone 
numbers on your Web site, the natural question becomes how do you turn 
your potential customers into paying customers? In other words, how can 
you close the deal?
The simple answer: Be thoroughly professional, conscientious, efficient, 
knowledgeable, and polite in handling all the interactions that you have 
with any prospect. Fall down here, and all is lost (or at least that potential 
customer is). Whether it’s in the promptness of the Thank You message 
you send when someone completes an online form or in how you answer an 
incoming call, realize that you are your business. You have to be at your best.
A few handy, time-tested rules for how best to handle the leads that come to 
you from your Web site follow:
 
✓ Say thanks: Use a confirmation page. This is the page your prospect sees 
within your Web site very soon after she’s submitted one of the forms 
on your site. This confirms that you’ve received the form — and criti-
cally, it’s where you do what Mom always insisted on: Say thank you. 
Perhaps you say, “Thank you for your interest,” “Thanks for setting up an 
appointment,” or “Thanks and expect a call back from us within 24 hours.” 
Whatever. But manners are important, and no more so than right here, at 
the very beginning of the relationship you’re trying to cultivate.
 
✓ Use auto-responders: An auto-responder is simply an e-mail that’s sent 
automatically when a prospect fills out a form. What she gets back from 
you is an e-mail (in addition to a confirmation page that appears on your 
site). Your auto-response will generally say something like, “Thank you, 
we’ll get back to you soon” just like a confirmation page, but an auto-
responder is often used for other things, too, such as sending an Out of 
Office reply. Auto-response e-mails can also be generated to confirm the 
receipt of a comment or a question that was received on your Web site.

107
 Chapter 5: When You’ve Hooked Your Customers, Reel ’Em In!
 
 Confirmation pages and auto-responses are usually created from within 
your Web site design or as an option in your e-mail program. In either 
case, the content of your reply is almost always written beforehand, so 
you don’t have to come up with something original each time you get a 
completed form or an e-mail. This prefabricated response just sits on 
your computer and shoots out when something comes in. In the case of 
a response to a completed form, however, you can create different 
responses to different types of input from the prospect. If, for example, 
he’s selected the I Want to Make an Appointment check box, your mes-
sage can be written to say, “I’ll call you very soon to set up an appoint-
ment at your convenience.” Or if he’s asked a question on the form, you 
could have a response that says, “Thanks for your question. I’ll be in 
touch shortly to answer it and any other questions you may have.” The 
more personalized and individualized your response appears to be, the 
more likely you are to win over the prospect.
 
✓ Answer your e-mail: A growing stack of unanswered e-mails can bury 
you in more ways than one. How quickly you get back to a prospect 
goes a long way toward shaping her perception of your professionalism. 
So respond to form submissions and e-mail inquiries now. Delay and 
you give your prospects time to reconsider or worse, to go browsing 
through your competitors’ sites while waiting to hear back from you. 
Also know that frequent Internet users have become trained to expect a 
response in less than 24 hours; they may tolerate one that comes up to 
48 hours later, but after that, your name officially becomes mud, if it’s 
remembered at all.
 
✓ Answer the phone: Here’s a scary thought: An April 2006 survey by 
Fastcall411 of 5,000 local businesses showed that two-thirds of incoming 
calls went unanswered. A study by market research firm Synovate found 
that four out of five Americans regard immediate availability by phone 
as an important or the most important factor when selecting a local ser-
vice provider. Put together those two factoids, and it quickly becomes 
clear that someone has to be available to answer your phone. Don’t rely 
on voicemail to bail you out because statistics show that getting a voice-
mail makes potential customers far less likely to send their business to 
the offending company.
 
✓ Reply to your voicemail: The only time that using voicemail is less than 
a hanging offense is when it’s used to field calls that come in after busi-
ness hours. For that eventuality, keep your automatic greeting short so 
that callers don’t get frustrated and hang up. And of course, when you 
get back to business each morning, check your voicemail messages and 
respond to them promptly.
Following these pieces of advice shouldn’t be hard for any local business 
to do. None of them is really anything more than common sense. Taken 
together, they can definitely help drive your conversion rate ever upward.

F
or generations, the people who ran advertising in conventional media 
(broadcast and print) knew that one ad generated business, and one 
didn’t — but they didn’t know why. Even today, the why of conventional 
advertising remains at least partially shrouded in mystery. (Spooky music 
goes here.)
But that is decidedly not the case with online advertising in general and Web 
sites in particular. That’s because the tactics — and the content — of Web 
sites, and of the online advertising that drives traffic to them, can be changed 
so quickly, it’s possible to figure out which elements trigger (or fail to trigger) 
a given response from consumers.
The primary tool that makes this incredibly useful new magic possible is Web 
analytics, which we discuss in this chapter.
Using Cutting-Edge Reporting Tools
Web analytics is the process of gathering and analyzing the behavior of visi-
tors to a Web site. Like any kind of analysis worth its salt, the results of Web 
analytics are shown in the form of tables, charts, and graphs. An example of 
how results can be displayed is shown in Figure 6-1.

Most importantly, using Web analytics enables a business, local or otherwise, 
to attract more Web site visitors, create new customers and retain existing 
ones, and increase the dollar volume that each customer spends.
It’s the immediacy of the Internet itself that allows the feedback you get from 
your Web site traffic to be gathered and measured in a flash. Not surprisingly, 
the actual doing of this requires tracking. And tracking is what Web analytics 
is all about.

111
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
Although this chapter deals with Web analytics in significant detail, pay-
per-click (PPC) analytics is a more complex subject than most other kinds. 
Metrics such as maximum cost-per-click, click-through rate, and a basketful 
of other considerations merit their own discussion, which is exactly what 
we give them in Chapter 7. You can read even more in Web Analytics For 
Dummies (Pedro Sostre and Jennifer LeClaire).
Web analytics in a nutshell
As a local business, you have goals for your Web site. You want visitors to 
request more information about your products or services, sign up for your 
e-mail newsletters, download a coupon you put on the site, or contact you 
by phone. In any and all of these cases, your overriding goal is to generate 
and capture leads — and to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
investments that you made (and will make) in your site to get those leads.
Web analytics helps you accomplish all that by enabling you to
 
✓ Measure and maximize your ROI.
 
• Identify which referral sources (search engines, banner ads, blog 
entries, and so on) generate the most new leads and the most new 
revenue.
 
• Determine how (and how well) your online efforts are keeping up 
with your overall business goals.
 
• Make sound and timely decisions as to which of those efforts are 
producing the results you want and which aren’t, with an eye to 
retaining the former and jettisoning the latter in favor of something 
more productive.
 
✓ Better target your advertising efforts.
 
• Define your visitor groups by the content they read, the actions 
they take, and even the referral sources they come from.
 
• Show which of these visitor groups are most likely to be converted 
into customers or subscribers.
 
✓ Optimize your conversion rates.
 
• Use click-path tracking to maximize the rate at which your Web 
site’s visitors convert into customers or subscribers. (Click-path 
refers to the breadcrumb trail that visitors to your site leave behind 
them, in that it tells you where they started out, and the links they 
subsequently clicked to get them to where they ended up.)
 
• Apply the results of your analyses to help you adjust the content of 
your site and the navigational paths that you built in.

112
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
That’s a lot of stuff, eh? Make that a lot of good, useful, actionable stuff that 
can help you get your business exactly where you want it to go.
Right about now, you’re probably thinking, “Yeah, but this whole analytics 
thing has got to cost a bundle.” Au contraire. As competition in the Web ana-
lytics field has grown, costs have fallen. You can even find some very effec-
tive free options.
Then there’s the learning curve. Web analytics has one. You need to figure 
out how to analyze the data that comes in if you’re going to get the most out 
of it. The good news is that the curve isn’t all that steep and that the rewards 
for climbing it are well worth the effort. (You do want to make more money in 
less time, don’t you?)
And one more good, if sort of intangible, thing: It just feels really good to step 
out of the dark about what is and isn’t working for you. It’s empowering. (Oh, 
and did we mention the making more money part?)
Where the magic of metrics comes in
Here are all the things that Web analytics tools can help your measure — in 
other words, the metrics — and why you should care:
 
✓ Visits: The number of distinct user sessions that take place, which is 
fancy talk for how many times your Web site is visited. A lot of what you 
need to know flows from this number.
 
✓ Unique visitors: The number of user sessions that originate from differ-
ent computers, from which you can pretty safely deduce the number of 
different people who are visiting your site. This isn’t necessarily a true 
1:1 ratio, however. Although people who visit your site more than once 
will usually do so from the same computer, the analytics tool can only 
identify computers’ Internet protocol (IP) addresses, so it’s like finding 
out which house on your block you’re hearing noise from, but not know-
ing exactly how many people are inside it. Still, just knowing how many 
repeat visits you’re getting from a single computer is useful information 
in itself because it indicates that folks are visiting your Web site multiple 
times, and that means you’re doing something right.
 
✓ Page view: The total number of distinct Web pages downloaded — that 
is, the number of pages that are actually being seen by visitors on their 
computer screens.
 
✓ Page views per visit: The number of pages viewed divided by the total 
number of visits. This is important because the more pages seen, the 
longer a given user is on your site. If people leave after viewing only 
one or two pages, that’s a pretty clear sign that your content is too little 
or too dull to hold their attention or to make them come back again — 
which tells you that your content’s in need of a fix.

113
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
 
✓ Time of day: When you know what times people are visiting your site, 
you can make a highly educated guess as to whether they’re doing so 
from home or from work. This information might be useful in knowing 
what kind of psychological state they’re in when they visit: relaxed at 
home, or pressed for time at the office.
 
✓ Day of week: This is another piece of data that can give you insight into 
patterns of visitor behavior. For instance, it seems fairly common for 
people to visit Web sites on weekends, and then make a purchase on 
Mondays. And the advantage of knowing on what days and at what times 
you’re getting the most visitors to your site is that you then have a clear 
indication of the best day or time to post a new offer or other promo-
tion, or even just to freshen up your content.
 
✓ Entry pages: Generally speaking, your home page will be the most fre-
quent entry point onto your site. The second most common are the land-
ing pages that people arrive at by clicking on the URL where you put in 
an ad or that appears on some other site. Lesson here: Your home page 
and all your landing pages better be in great shape.
 
✓ Referrers: The Web sites or the other pages or sites that provided a link 
to your site.
 
✓ Search engines: Which search engines brought up a link to your site in 
the search results they generated. If you’re paying an appreciable sum for 
PPC ads on a search engine that isn’t producing much, stop doing that.
 
✓ Search terms: The words that a user entered into a search engine to find 
your site. Obviously, this is a critical thing to know for a few reasons:
 
• Search terms can help inform you as to the products and services 
that potential customers are most interested in, which is data you 
can leverage across other aspects of your marketing program.
 
• Search terms can help you discover where your local custom-
ers are coming from, in the sense that if someone searches for 
salon in midtown manhattan, there is a good chance that Midtown 
Manhattan is where that potential customer is located (or works or 
will be visiting).
 
• Popular search terms where people find you organically can help 
inform you what keywords you should be bidding on for your pay-
per-click (PPC) campaign.
 
✓ Conversion rate: Typically expressed as a percentage of site visitors 
who actually took an action (such as completing an online form, sending 
an e-mail to you, signing up for your newsletter) versus the number of 
visitors who showed up and didn’t do anything. Pay the closest possible 
attention your conversion rate. It’s your bottom line talking.
Metrics tell you an astounding number of things. They focus you on what 
you’re doing right and doing wrong, where you’re wasting money, and where 

114
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
you’ve invested wisely, who your customers are (and aren’t), and where your 
next and best opportunities lie.
Choosing a Web analytics provider
The first step in putting Web analytics to work involves choosing a software 
provider. The second step is to lift a few lines of code from that application 
and plug them into your Web site. Don’t worry, most software providers 
make sure it’s pretty easy to do.
A variety of Web analytic tools are available from a number of quality com-
panies. And, as we mention earlier, several of these tools are free yet robust 
enough to serve any business well, be it local or large.
Table 6-1 gives several good, inexpensive options for Web analytic providers.

The following list describes the Web analytics providers given in Table 6-1:
 
✓ Google Analytics: The free analytics tool that Google offers is simply 
today’s best free analytic tool for any local business. It’s very easy to 
set up and use. It offers basic analysis and reporting functions, which 
are capable of collecting standard metrics such as page views, unique 
visitors, time spent on the Web site, and the percentage of visitors who 
abandon your site rather than continue on to other pages. What’s more — 
and terrific — is that Google Analytics (GA) runs on its own server, 
which is to say, it’s hosted. That means you don’t need to apply any 
in-house manpower to keep it up and running. All you do need to do is 
add some code to your Web pages, and Google walks you through that 
process step by step.

115
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
 
 Because it’s the leader of the pack, we view many of the subjects 
discussed in this chapter through a Google Analytics lens.
 
✓ Yahoo! Web Analytics: The Yahoo! folks are no slouches when it comes 
to the free analytic tools they offer. Like GA, Yahoo! Web Analytics can 
give you valuable insights in to the demographics and the interest level 
of your Web site visitors. It also gives you powerful and flexible dash-
boards (a jargon-y way of saying control panels), market segmentation 
tools, and campaign management features. And, like GA, it’s very easy to 
implement.
 
✓ Woopra: Yes, it does kind of sound like a certain daytime talk show 
host, but actually, it’s a great alternative to GA. Of course, it hasn’t yet 
captured the sort of market share that GA enjoys, but that’s because 
it’s a relative newcomer to the field. Woopra is particularly useful for 
less-trafficked Web sites and blogs because in addition to offering all the 
standard metrics that GA does, it also has two really nifty features that 
can really only be applied to noncongested sites:
 
• Real-time visitor analysis that tells you exactly which source a cur-
rent visitor came from, the page of your site that he’s now on, and 
the path through your site that he followed to get to that page.
 
• Even more nifty is Woopra’s built-in chat tool; this little gem 
lets you pop-up messages to a given site visitor while she’s on 
the site, and start a real-time conversation. (Prompted chat is 
explained in Chapter 5.) Maybe you think this sounds a little 
creepy. These Woopra-ites would seem to be onto something 
here that could be huge.
 
✓ CrazyEgg: GA offers an overlay tool, and CrazyEgg offers a more 
advanced version of the same thing. An overlay tool gives you the ability 
to literally see where people are clicking on a Web page, and the results 
can be depicted on a heat map (a picture of a Web page with a transpar-
ent layer positioned over it). This layer registers clicks that occur on the 
various links, buttons, and other widgets on the page; the ones that get 
the most clicks appear in red (a hot spot), while those least clicked are 
shown in blue or have no color at all. This can tell you volumes about 
what’s working on a page and what isn’t. It can be so effective, it almost 
isn’t fair. CrazyEgg offers a free version of this tool that gives a local 
business great insights into where visitors are going — and not going — 
on the Web site. There’s also a fancier, paid version available.
 
✓ Enquisite: If you want much more detailed information about your 
regular search engine traffic and your PPC traffic, you really should 
take a look at Enquisite. It’s an inexpensive tool for business owners 
who spend a lot of time and effort attracting Web site visitors from the 
search engine realm, and it allows you to do some great analysis that 
can help you improve the ROI of your online advertising.

Because many of the tools from these resources are free, there’s no reason 
why you can’t use more than one of them in combination. Let your specific 
needs be your guide in building your own personal Web analytics arsenal. 
What fun.
Understanding Key Metrics
As a local business owner who maintains a Web site, you need to keep your 
eye on only a few key metrics, but those few merit very close attention 
because they tell the tale on whether or not your online advertising program 
is doing its job.
Those key metrics (as expressed in nontechnical parlance) are
 
✓ Where are your site visitors coming from?
 
✓ What content are they consuming when they arrive at your site?
 
✓ Which offers are they most likely to take advantage of?
 
✓ What does it cost to get new customers?
 
✓ What is your lead-to-sales ratio?
Where are your customers coming from?
Knowing where your Web site traffic is coming from will help you refine your 
whole online advertising plan. For example, if it turns out that you’re getting 
a lot of visitors from searches that people do on Google or Yahoo!, that tells 
you to further cement your relationship with those sites, and to try forging a 
relationship with similar sites (such as www.bing.com).
On the other hand, if you find that you’re getting a lot of traffic from search 
engines based on particular search terms that don’t reflect your business 
goals, you’ll want to spend some time optimizing your site for other search 
terms. (If you own a dry cleaning service, for instance, you don’t necessarily 
want to come popping up in search engine results when someone searches 
for dirty sheets.)
The metrics that are most relevant to sources are
 
✓ Referring keyword data: Checking your referring keyword data lets 
you infer the intent of your site visitors, understand how they typically 
search for the kind of products or services you offer, and determine 
whether you’re getting the kind of traffic you think you should be.

117
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
 
 This data isn’t complicated. It simply tells you what keywords and 
phrases people have used in searching the Web, seeing your URL, and 
clicking it to arrive at your site. When you see how people are actually 
finding you, it becomes relatively easy to figure out which keywords and 
phrases generate the highest conversion rates for your business. Figure 6-2 
shows a sample referring keyword report from Google Analytics.
 
Figure 6-2: 
A referring 
keyword 
report tells 
you which 
keywords 
and phrases 
bring 
visitors to 
your site.
 
 
 Having this information is particularly important if you’re spending a lot 
of effort and/or money on search engine optimization (SEO, which we talk 
extensively about in Chapter 8) because it makes no sense to use a lot of 
resources optimizing a Web site for keywords that fail to convert leads. 
For example, say you own a hair salon and you’re optimizing your site 
on an ongoing basis for three sets of keywords — haircuts, hair removal, 
and makeup. All three of these drive a similar volume of traffic to your 
site. However, your Web analytics tells you that people who clicked after 
searching haircuts and hair removal are far more engaged with your site 
(they download coupons, sign up for you newsletter, and view a log of 
pages), but those who click makeup don’t. As a logical business owner, 
what do you do? Simple. You stop focusing on makeup keyword from your 
PPC plan, saving time and potentially money overall or using your existing 
resources to optimize on new, more effective keywords.
 
✓ Top referring sites: As shown in Figure 6-3, here’s the metric that tells 
you what other sites are sending traffic your way. Now look closely: 
Which of them are generating the most leads? Are you surprised at 
which sites are referring business to you? Do you have an existing 
relationship with each top referring site — and, if not, should you?

118
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
 Knowing which sites are sending you traffic can really help you steer your 
online advertising dollars into the most productive channels. If a particu-
lar site sends you 50 unique visitors per day, and 25 percent of those con-
vert (or take some positive action including filling out a form, signing up 
for a newsletter, or making an appointment), you’re in great shape. And 
that should make you consider upping your spend on that site to increase 
your exposures, click-throughs, and conversions even further. On the 
other hand, if a site is sending you 100 unique visitors per month but none 
of them convert, what’s the point? Better to shift dollars away from the 
dud site toward a bigger presence on a productive one.
 
Figure 6-3: 
A top-
referring 
site report 
makes clear

send you 
the most

likely 
visitors.
 
What content are visitors consuming?
When you know where visitors to your site came from, the next logical ques-
tions are: What specific pages on your site are they visiting, and how well are 
your home and landing pages working? You know that you have lots of ter-
rific stuff on your site, but are people going for that or for something else you 
never really expected would get much attention?
To keep your Web site running productively, you need to know what’s work-
ing and what’s not. To find out, take a close look at these metrics:
 
✓ Site content popularity: A lot of Web pros say that only about 20 per-
cent of any given Web site’s content gets consumed. Ah, but which 20 
percent? Maybe people are heading straight for the page with your 

119
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
product’s specifications. Or maybe they’re making a beeline for your 
photo gallery. Or maybe it’s your coupon offer that’s generating the most 
readership. Who knows? Well, armed with your site content popularity 
data, you do. Then comes the next step. When you know where your site 
visitors go, make sure that you provide can’t-miss links to those pages 
throughout the site, particularly on your home page. You might even want 
to feature a mention of that super-popular content in your advertising.
 
 A report on site content–popularity will usually present the data in sepa-
rate pieces, such as
 
• Top content: Shows you which of your Web pages are the most 
popular. You can then optimize those pages for even higher 
readership performance.
 
• Content by title: Gives you the most popular content views by page 
title, thus enabling you to spiff up the rest of the content on that 
high-traffic page.
 
• Content drilldown: Gives you a look at the content views by direc-
tory, which, in turn, lets you determine the most common patterns 
of user activity.
 
• Top landing pages: Shows which of your pages visitors land on the 
most. With this knowledge, you can optimize those pages. This 
data can also enhance your ability to figure out which of your 
online ads (or maybe your social network efforts) are delivering 
the best customers to your site.
 
• Top exit pages: Provides you with which of your pages is the most 
common place for visitors to exit your site. This metric can help 
you decide whether something in particular is wrong with that 
page and then fix it; it can also teach you more about visitors’ gen-
eral patterns of activity on the site.
 
• Site overlay: Shows you which areas of your site are most often 
clicked.
 
 Every one of these metrics can help you optimize your site for more 
visits, longer visits, and more productive visits. And they’re usually pre-
sented in a form that makes them easy to understand.
 
✓ Bounce rate and time on site: It’s just a given that not all visitors to 
your site are going to like what they find there. Maybe they don’t think 
it’s relevant, maybe they find it confusing, or maybe they just don’t 
go for the monkey motif. In any case, bounce rate is the percentage of 
entries on each page that resulted in an exit from the site, without the 
visitor’s having clicked any deeper into the content.

120
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
 Whatever the reason for a particular visitor’s departure, knowing your 
bounce rate (or abandons) is very useful as a measure of how well a site 
page delivers its message. (See Figure 6-4.) Here are a couple of exam-
ples of how to put bounce rates to work:
 
• Say you offer dog walking services, and the majority of the visitors 
who come to your site using search terms like dog walking then 
exit your site as soon as they arrive at your dog walking landing 
page. There’s something distressingly wrong with that page that 
needs to be fixed.
 
• It’s possible that visitors have stayed around long enough to read 
your content, absorb it, and evaluate it; this is where the time on 
site metric comes in handy because it tells you how well your site 
engages visitors. If they’re spending a long time on a page only 
to then fly the coop, odds are your content just isn’t compelling 
enough and needs to be punched up.

Which offers are visitors clicking with?
One of the best things about using Web analytics is that you track how well 
a particular offer or other incentive is doing in the real world. Is what you’re 
offering leading to conversions? At what rate? Web analytics can give you the 
answers to those questions — and to the more important one: How can you 
do even better?

121
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
The time-honored, tried-and-true way to test the effectiveness of any given 
offer is to make it compete against another offer. The same thing goes for 
other kinds of inducements (such as free estimates) that can help you cross-
sell and up-sell visitors to your site, or even softer incentives (such as com-
parison charts between your products and your competitors’). In a sense, 
these are all offers, and they can all be tested against other contenders.
 
It’s natural enough to interpret this advice as “test offer A against offer B.” 
Certainly, that keeps things manageable, but soon you’ll want to test the 
winner of A versus B against offer C — and so on. If you can, you’re better off 
simultaneously testing several alternatives because that will teach you more 
in less time. You might even find that although you definitely want to extend 
the most productive offer on your site, whatever came in second (or even 
third) might be worth including, too. Doing that couldn’t hurt (provided the 
offers don’t somehow cancel each other out), and it just might give your con-
version rate a nice upward nudge.
Here are some of the kinds of offers that local businesses commonly use and 
that can easily be tested against one another:
 
✓ Percent discount: Straight percent-off or buy one month of dog walking, 
get one free offers nearly always drive lead capture; note, though, that 
they tend to have the most effect with customers who are in a “buy now” 
mode rather than with those who are just browsing.
 
✓ Sales demo or appointment: This can be a high-risk offer because it will 
chew up a chunk of your valuable time, but it can also work very well 
when your potential customer is already primed to buy.
 
✓ Free estimate or consultation: Like the demo/appointment approach, 
this one can use up some time. Similarly, though, it can be just what a 
prospect needs if he’s teetering on the edge of making a purchase. This 
is particularly effective for products or services where a certain level 
of education is required on the part of potential clients or customers 
before they become clients or customers (such as legal services, medi-
cal procedures, and so on).
 
✓ Sweepstakes: This tactic can quickly build your volume of leads, but 
those leads might be of lesser quality than those you get some other 
way. One sure-fire way to make sweepstakes more effective is have them 
relate to your product or service (a spa can give away free facials, a 
bed and breakfast can give away a free getaway package). Sure, you’re 
still giving away something for free, but you’re also getting someone to 
try what you have to offer, and with luck, they’ll become repeat (and 
paying) customers. A possible negative is that some states regulate 
sweepstakes pretty tightly, so make sure to stay in strict compliance 
with whatever laws apply.

122
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
 
✓ How-to guides: These can be a great way to educate consumers and 
give them a good feeling about your business. The guides don’t have to 
be especially complicated; something as simple as “How to determine 
which perennial flower seeds you should plant when” can be more than 
sufficient.
 
Ideally, whatever offer(s) you’re testing should also be included in the adver-
tising that you’re using to drive traffic to your Web site, and each offer should 
run for the same duration, just to keep things fair.
You might well be wondering how you can test multiple offers at the same 
time on the same Web site. The simplest way is to create different landing 
pages, each of which contains a different offer. You can split an e-mail com-
munication, with half the recipients getting one offer, half getting the other, 
and the link on each version leading to its own corresponding landing page. 
You could also field more than one PPC ad, each touting a different offer, to 
drive traffic to the pertinent landing page. (You can read all about such tech-
niques in E-Mail Marketing For Dummies, by John Arnold.)
It’s terrific to have an offer start generating strong consumer interest in your 
business. Just keep in mind that interest by itself isn’t really what you’re 
after. Conversions are the goal. So, the metric that truly counts here is which 
offer produced the most positive, actionable responses from prospective cus-
tomers at the most efficient cost. Sound familiar? Yep, it’s our old friend, the 
conversion rate. Maybe one of your offers beat out all the others in its ability 
to induce your Web site visitors to fill out a form, call your business, or opt-in 
to your e-newsletter. Well, there’s your winner.
Even your also-ran offers can teach you something, though. Look closely at 
them and the mechanics behind them. Were the offers too stingy? Were they 
so complicated that they couldn’t be explained in simple terms? Did it take 
too much navigation to find them on your site? Was there something in the 
way the offers were expressed that wasn’t compelling enough or that came 
off as too haughty — or conversely, too needy and desperate? You can fix 
any of those things. Then throw those new and improved versions back out 
there — and see how they fare this time around.
What does it cost to get new customers?
You want to bring in the most customers at the most efficient cost. The more 
formal way to say that is that you’re looking for the lowest cost per acquisi-
tion. Your overall cost per acquisition (CPA) is what you get when you divide 
your total acquisition expenses by your total number of new customers. How 
simple is that?

123
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
Well, the calculation is simple, and so is counting up your new customers. 
The more complicated element is figuring out just what your acquisition 
expenditures really are.
For example, if in one year, you spend $2,000 on a print ad in your local news-
paper or on a Yellow Pages display ad and you acquire 20 new customers, 
that’s a CPA of $100. If, on the other hand, you spend $2,000 on a PPC ad cam-
paign for that same year and acquire 200 new customers, your CPA is $10. 
However, those might not be your only costs. How much did someone charge 
you to create your newspaper ad? How much did it cost you to maintain your 
Web site over that year? For that matter, what was the initial cost of having 
your Web site built, and how many years has the site been up? So what’s the 
amortized yearly cost of your site’s development?
How much is a customer worth?
We stress the importance of measuring your CPA 
whenever possible because it’s one of the best 
metrics that you can use to determine whether 
the marketing you’re doing is actually worth the 
time, effort, resources, and blood, sweat, and 
tears you’re putting into it. The other side of that 
particular coin is determining just how much a 
new customer is actually worth to you.
Say you’re a cosmetic surgeon who specializes 
in rhinoplasty, and the average nose job goes 
for $6,000. When you take out the direct costs 
associated with performing each nose job, 
you’re left with $3,000 of gross profit. In busi-
ness circles, this gross profit is often referred 
to as the contribution.
The whole deal looks like this:
Revenue ($6,000) – Direct costs ($3,000) = 
Contribution ($3,000)
Except that’s not necessarily the whole deal. 
There might be other factors that you should 
think about when coming up with the true value 
of a client. Two of the most common of these 
factors are
 ✓ Future sales: Say that, on average, one out 
of two of your patients will come back for a 
facelift, and that the contribution for a face-
lift is $2,000. That means that the benefit to 
you of acquiring a new nose-job patient has 
a 50 percent chance of being significantly 
bigger than just the initial nose job itself. 
And, not surprisingly, there’s a simple for-
mula for that, too:
 
 Contribution from a facelift ($2,000) × 
Probability of a facelift for nose job patient 
(50%) = Additional contribution from the 
nose job patient ($1,000)
 ✓ Referrals from the client (patient): Say that 
you’re a really good cosmetic surgeon and 
that on average, one of every two of your 
prior nose-job patients refers another nose-
job patient to you. That works out to be
 
 50% of nose jobs done × Contribution from 
each referred nose job ($3,000) = $1,500 
additional contribution from the original, 
referring nose-job patient
What you’d have is the contribution from the 
original direct sale ($3,000), plus the value of the 
future sale ($1,000), plus the value of the referred 
sale ($1,500), for a potential lifetime nose-job 
client value of $5,500, as opposed to the initially 
assumed $3,000. And because, seen as a whole, 
the contribution is higher, you can technically 
afford a higher CPA and still be profitable.

The point is that some acquisition costs are easy to put your finger on, but 
others are less obvious. It takes some time (and probably some good documen-
tation of what you paid to whom for what) to get all your costs totaled. The 
good news is that after you do that, the result of your customer-conversion-cost 
calculation will probably give you a crystal clear idea of where to keep spending 
your money as well as where to pull back or pull out.
 
Think very hard before you spend advertising dollars in a medium where 
results can’t be reliably measured — say, like those ads that some businesses 
stick all over the town’s lamp posts. Similarly, don’t continue to advertise in a 
medium where use you can’t justify in any measurable way.
 
What, then, is the goal here? Obviously, it’s to generate the lowest CPA you pos-
sibly can. But there’s another, long-term goal: to get that cost at least a little bit 
lower each and every year. Otherwise, you’re not really making any progress. 
You should use this year’s cost-analysis results to make next year’s results even 
better. Tweak your Web site to make whatever’s working work harder. Figure out 
whether there are other, better-chosen keywords you could be using in your PPC 
ads. Make your e-mails punchier. And keep doing it over and over.
Ultimately, you’ll have an online advertising campaign that squeezes every 
nickel. You’ll spend ad money with amazing effectiveness and efficiency. 
You will, in short, be bringing in each customer for a fraction of what you 
used to spend.
What is your lead-to-sales ratio?
An example will help demonstrate how to arrive at your lead-to-sales ratio, 
why it’s important, and how some of the other metrics we’ve already dis-
cussed will come into play.
If you send an e-mail aimed at your target audience, you can determine 
exactly how many people saw it and then clicked through to your Web site. 
You can also figure out how many people actually became a lead via that 
e-mail and even see how many were then converted.
Say that your statistics for a given month are
 
✓ Cost of the monthly e-mail blast: $500
 
✓ Click-through number: 100
 
✓ Leads generated: 25
 
✓ Cost per lead: $20
 
✓ Lead conversion rate: 25%
 
✓ Sales generated: 5
 
✓ Lead-to-sales ratio: 20%

125
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
Now look inside these numbers:
 
✓ Of the 100 people who looked at your e-mail and then clicked through to 
your Web site, 25 filled out a form they found on your site or called you 
as a result of the e-mail.
 
✓ You calculate your cost per lead by dividing your total cost ($500) by 
the number of leads you got (25); in our example, that comes to $20 per 
lead. The lower this number, the better.
 
✓ The lead conversion rate is the result of dividing the number of folks 
who clicked through to your Web site from the e-mail into the number of 
leads that group generated; in this case, that’s 25 ÷ 100, or 25%.
 
✓ Finally, if 5 of those 25 new conversions actually bought your product or 
service, your lead-to-sales ratio is 5 ÷ 25, or 20%.
Okay, 20% isn’t bad — but it could always be better. The key is to increase 
your lead-to-sales ratio, which, technically speaking, you could do in either 
of two ways: Decrease your number of leads, but get more sales from that 
smaller group of people (not a good idea), or increase both your number of 
leads and the percentage of sales that you get from that larger number. In the 
latter case, you would have something that people with an MBA call a grow-
ing business.
 
The neat thing about breaking down the lead-to-sales calculations this way is 
that you can see each of the moving parts. You can monitor these numbers 
continuously and systematically, and steadily make smarter and smarter deci-
sions as to where and how to spend your advertising dollars.
Optimizing for Improved Results
So here’s kind of a scary-sounding word: optimization. All optimization really 
means is the process of making something better. And, using the metrics 
we discuss earlier in this chapter, you can make your Web site better in any 
number of ways, at virtually no cost.
You do this by continually testing the various elements that appear on your 
site to determine which could use some improvement. Then you make the 
improvements. Then you test the improvements. Not too complicated, really. 
What you’re doing is optimizing your site to optimize your results.
Testing what, exactly? It’s usually not a big thing. Maybe you move your con-
tact information from the right side of the page to the left so that it’s easier to 
find. Or put in a big red Download button to make it obvious what you want 
people to do. Or make your call to action (say, to complete a form) more vis-
ible or better phrased.

126
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
Whatever the specifics, Web site optimization involves trying and testing, 
and then drawing solid, evidence-backed conclusions. Every conclusion you 
act on improves the performance of your site.
The reasons you want to bother with testing is because it allows you to
 
✓ Increase conversion rates and sales by identifying the content and con-
tent combinations that best drive conversions and increase your ROI.
 
✓ Improve landing page performance by making it more interesting and 
compelling and thus reducing the number of people who exit the site at 
that critical point without going further.
 
✓ Generate more leads by streamlining your online lead-generation forms 
to make them easier to find, understand, and fill out.
 
✓ Increase the time visitors spend on your site by continually making it 
more informative, attractive, and engaging.
 
✓ Eliminate guesswork from site alterations by basing your changes on 
the real-world empirical data you get from actual visitors.
Split testing
We talk a good deal about testing the elements of your Web site to find out 
which are working and which aren’t. But, how exactly you should do that 
deserves some explanation.
The typical method is split testing (or A/B testing). You probably remem-
ber high school science classes and the whole idea of comparing a control 
something-or-other against alternatives. Well, that’s essentially what split 
testing is. Say you want to test the headline on one of your landing pages to 
see whether what you’re using now is as effective as it might be. The one you 
already have in place is your control. Then you swap that out for a different 
headline on the same landing page, leaving every other element on the page 
as is. Then you do a split run — for instance, when one visitor clicks onto 
the landing page, he sees Headline A (the current one), and the next person 
who clicks on sees Headline B (the alternate). You let this split run go on for 
an appreciable amount of time, maybe two weeks or longer. Then you com-
pare results: One headline will outperform the other in terms of increased 
response rate or of some other outcome you have as your goal. And that’s 
your winner.
We simplify here in the sense that you’ll probably want to split test Headlines 
A, B, C, and maybe even D at the same time, and there’s no reason you can’t. 
Doing so can save you a lot of time, and the general concept remains the 
same.

127
 Chapter 6: Analyzing Results for Long-Term Gains
Testing page elements
When you think about it, you optimize other aspects of your business all 
the time. You paint your showroom a new bright color. You freshen a floor 
display. You improve your own computer system to give you more informa-
tion, faster.
Optimizing your Web site represents exactly the same kind of beneficial 
tinkering except that it takes place in the online realm rather than the 
physical one.
The following steps outline the process you use to test Web pages:
 
1. Choose the pages you want to test.
 
 Your Web analytics point out areas of your site that are underperform-
ing, so you then aim your efforts at these specific pages or elements.
 
2. Decide what elements to test.
 
 Look at an underperforming page. Why do you think it’s falling short? 
You don’t have solid data yet on specifics, so you need to hypothesize a 
little. Ask yourself these questions:
 
• Considering your site’s traffic sources, does it seem like the page 
matches up with the expectations that visitors would have? Does 
the page give them what you can surmise they’re looking for? Did 
you make an offer in an ad that isn’t clearly contained on the land-
ing page?
 
• Could you improve the continuity (or flow) from one page to 
another? Do all the pages look and feel like they’re part of the same 
site? Would using the headline from your PPC ad as the landing 
page headline make for a smoother transition from ad to site?
 
• What’s missing from the page? Is there enough content there to 
pay off the visit? Or is there so much content that it’s likely to be 
putting people off?
 
• How well is the page organized? Is the information on the page 
organized in a way that can be easily followed and digested by a 
stranger?
 
 Several elements on any given page might call for testing, such as the 
headline, images, text, layout, and so on. Just make sure to test only one 
element at a time; otherwise, you’ll never know for sure which change 
did the trick.
 
3. Test and measure performance.
 
 When your test is up and running, start monitoring the data you’re 
getting from your site visitors. Are people spending more time on 
the revised Page X than they did on the old Page X? Are more people 

128
Part II: Setting the Foundation for Local Online Advertising Success 
filling out the form on Page Y than they did before? Are you using a long 
enough time frame (a week, two weeks, a month) to make your determi-
nation? If the answer to questions like these are yes, you can consider 
your Web site now firmly improved.
 
4. Start the process over again.
 
 What’s the next thing that could use some optimization?
For example, say you’re a landscaper, and your Web analytics tells you that 
your Gardening Tips page is underperforming. It’s the page that invites visi-
tors to opt-in to receive tips from you via e-mail, but most people are aban-
doning your site at that page. You take a good hard look at the page and 
come up with a few possible reasons why it’s not capturing users’ interest. 
Maybe the headline “Gardening Advice” is too passive, and you realize that 
your call to action is pretty far down the page, too. You decide to test two 
new headlines: “Stop Killing Your Plants” and “How to Grow a Green Thumb.” 
Bingo! The “Green Thumb” headline starts creating more opt-ins. Nice work. 
Now you try moving the call to action higher up on the page so people don’t 
have to scroll down to find it. Double bingo! You’re now getting opt-ins from 
nearly half the people who visit that page. Isn’t optimization fun?
 
Google offers a fee tool — the Website Optimizer (www.google.com/
websiteoptimizer) — that automates testing and makes it easy for you 
to fix troubled landing pages and put the new-and-improved ones up on your 
site. It’s definitely worth taking a look at.
 
Optimization doesn’t have to be complicated or difficult. It requires noth-
ing more, really, than the application of good old common sense, and it’s 
something that the world’s biggest advertisers do every day because they’ve 
made a corporate commitment to leaving no stone unturned in their drive to 
create more and more business for themselves. It’s the same kind of commit-
ment you should make. It isn’t hard, and it pays dividends, putting more of 
your business’s future and fate firmly in your own hands — exactly where it 
belongs.

Doing the Advertising 
Part of Local Online 
Advertising

In this part . . .
A
dvertising has always been an essential part of doing 
business. As a successful local business, you’re 
almost certainly doing some kind of advertising — probably 
just not the online kind (yet). Online or offline, the basic 
principle remains the same: People have to know about 
you before they can bring their business to you.
This part covers a lot of ground, but that’s only because it’s 
all pivotal stuff that any serious online advertiser needs to 
take to heart and put to use. As you no doubt will.
Chapter 7 discusses — and Chapters 8 and 9 go further to 
explain — one of the cornerstones of advertising, search 
engine marketing. Chapter 10 gets into the important 
subject of using business e-mail. Chapter 11 explores the 
use of directories and lead aggregators. Chapter 12 talks 
about banner ads and online classified ads.
Then we step a bit outside the box, as Chapter 13 
describes the marketing uses of social networks, such as 
Facebook and MySpace. Chapter 14 examines the ways in 
which online public relations efforts can come nicely into 
play. Chapter 15 closes out with a discussion of how you 
can augment your online advertising efforts by experience 
from your offline advertising channels and vice versa.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the differences between organic and paid search
▶ Capitalizing on consumers’ search behavior
▶ Establishing and integrating a combined search strategy
H
ere’s a secret: At its heart, local online advertising isn’t all that compli-
cated. In fact, mastering two key elements of the process is enough to 
get you up and running and pointed toward success. Those two elements are 
a good Web site and a solid handle on the use of search engines, because a 
Web site gives people a rewarding place to go, and search engines give them 
a way to get there.
In this chapter, we discuss searching organically and paid search engine mar-
keting so that you clearly understand how they work and how well they can 
serve your business goals.
Understanding Organic and Paid Search
How do you look for information? You search the Internet, right? According 
to Marketing Sherpa, almost 134 million people in the U.S. regularly use 
search engines when looking for information online. That’s the good news. 
Of those 134 million, 63 percent look only at the first page of search engine 
results. That’s the bad news.
The objective for any ambitious marketer is to make sure your ad shows on 
that first page. And to do that, you need to put a number of search engine 
strategies to work for your business. Taken together, these strategies for paid 
search and organic search are search marketing.

132
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Both organic and paid searches aim at getting highly qualified visitors to 
your Web site — and that means getting your site to rank near the top 
on search engine results pages when people type in the keywords you’ve 
chosen. Although either form of search, done correctly, can get you prime 
exposure on search engines, using both options may well be the most sen-
sible and effective path for local businesses.
Organic search results
As we discuss in Chapter 2, organic (or natural) listings appear as a result of 
decisions that a search engine makes with its proprietary algorithms. The 
way to influence your placement or rank in an organic search is search engine 
optimization (SEO). (We deal with the actual nuts and bolts of SEO in Chapter 8, 
but what follows gives you a pretty good idea of how it works and what it can 
accomplish.)
SEO lets you actively direct the way your site is listed — and, consequently, 
the ranking it receives — by giving search engines exactly what they’re look-
ing for. They’re looking for relevance to the user’s search term so that they 
provide a useful consumer experience. The best way to understand SEO is 
to ask yourself, “How do I make it easy for Google to find my site when a 
consumer types in something relevant to my business?” Fine-tuning both the 
content and coding of your Web site will help. When the engines see your site 
as relevant, they place it among the top organic results when people search 
for the kind of products or services you offer.
Organic search is such a valuable advertising tactic; many search engine 
surveys and studies show that users are more likely to click organic search 
results than paid listings. Why?
 
✓ Organic listings are unbiased and not bought. As a result, users trust 
these results more than paid listings.
 
✓ People view organic search results as more permanent than paid ones. 
Paid listings remain in the results only when paid for, whereas organic 
listings remain ranked until the search engine changes its algorithm or 
ranking methodology.
That might make you think that SEO needs to be at the core of your overall 
online advertising plan. After all, the process is free (assuming you do it). 
And we just said that the organic results it produces are, in key respects, 
preferred by search engine users. So does that mean you can fold up the 
tent on this chapter and move on to something else? No. Because one of the 
major downsides of SEO for local businesses is that it isn’t always a winnable 
proposition.

133
 Chapter 7: Demystifying Search Engine Marketing
For instance, say you’re a locksmith. If someone types locksmiths into 
Google, he’ll find that the overwhelming majority of the organic search 
results on the first page don’t show local businesses because locksmiths is 
just too broad a keyword; it produces a lot of category killers, such as direc-
tories, Internet Yellow Pages (IYP), and industry associations. These are sites 
that contain so much relevant keyword content that they tend to win out 
over any local competition for the same keywords. Figure 7-1 shows what a 
search results page like this looks like.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The top sev-
eral results 
when 
searching 
for lock-
smiths are 
category 
killers.
 
You can try to localize your SEO efforts by attaching a geographic modifier to 
your keyword (such as locksmiths.denver), and Google would then dutifully 
produce just the organic results for Denver-based locksmiths. (See Figure 7-2.) 
Even then, any single Denver locksmith is likely to find it difficult to compete 
successfully with directories, IYP, and so on for a high-visibility ranking.
However, we do have one way you can relatively easily compete organically. 
The advent of local listings that come with those nifty little maps attached 
nearly always show up at the top portion of the organic results whenever 
someone searches with local intent (meaning she used a specific geographic 
modifier, such as a town, suburb, or zip code, along with her keyword or 
phrase). Additionally, some of the search engines have started serving local 
listing results using your computer’s IP address. After all, if someone in 
Denver is locked out of his car, he’ll want to find the locksmith located clos-
est to the parking lot he’s stuck in. And when a local mapped listing gives 
that to him, his search is over.

Paid search advertising
The vast majority of search engine users never venture further than the first 
page of their search results, and getting an organic, non-specifically localized 
listing to show up on the first page is a pitched battle that is often difficult 
for businesses to win. Put together those two factors, and it’s pretty obvious 
that there has to be another way to ensure a high-visibility search engine 
presence. This is when paid searches enter the picture.
Do a Google or Yahoo! search and right off the bat, you notice a special type 
of listings situated around the organic results that appear on the page. These 
are paid listings (or sponsored or pay-per-click [PPC] listings), and they get 
their prominent position because someone paid to have them appear when 
someone types a specified keyword into a search engine. Also notice that 
these paid ads occupy space either at the top of the page or along the right 
side. Either location makes them almost impossible to miss — which is the 
whole idea.
To get accustomed to the idea of paying for search engine listings, you need 
to understand the tremendous advantages that paid search gives to local 
businesses:
 
✓ Paid search engine ads appear almost immediately, which means you 
can quickly start driving traffic to your site. You don’t have to wait for 
your SEO efforts to get up to speed.
 
✓ With paid search advertising, you pay only for results. No matter how 
many times your ad is displayed, there’s no cost to you until it’s clicked.

135
 Chapter 7: Demystifying Search Engine Marketing
 
✓ By tracking the results that your paid search advertising produces, you 
can easily figure out whether the business you’re getting from your 
ad(s) justifies the expense.
 
✓ Paid search is a great testing tool. You can run several different paid ads 
simultaneously and then determine which offers and messages work 
best. You can also (and easily) test the effectiveness of your keywords, 
your product offerings, your ad headlines and sales copy, and even your 
price points.
Understanding How Consumers 
Rate Search Results
As you enter the wonderful world of search marketing, you need to under-
stand how search users actually view a search engine results page. Generally 
speaking, well-ranked organic listings are more likely to be clicked by users 
than sponsored listings.
“Inside the Mind of the Searcher,” a 2004 study by Enquiro, showed nearly 80 
percent of the test subjects initially skipped over all sponsored listings and 
dove straight into the top organic results. Not only that, but in most cases, 
their eyes never went back to the sponsored listings. A 2009 study found 
much the same thing: Organic results still generate the majority of clicks. 
(Figure 7-3 shows a heat map that illustrates how people typically view a 
search engine results page.) Some industry gurus come at it a slightly differ-
ent way, suggesting that 70–75 percent of actual clicks are organic listings 
and only 20–25 percent are sponsored ones.
Given the super-high, super-visible position that paid listings get, paid search 
may strike you as counter-intuitive. But arguably, searches all come down 
to trust. Many users know that the ads near the top and right are, well, ads 
whereas they seem to perceive highly ranked organic listings as having mer-
ited their position on the page. Merit apparently indicates trustworthiness to 
these users — and that’s enough to get them confidently clicking away.
People who click organic results are more likely to be researching or brows-
ing, whereas people who click paid listings tend to be ready to buy now. In 
fact, according to new research, 82 percent of the money spent as a result of 
search engine listings comes from paid listings.
 
Don’t overestimate the importance of this distinction. Your best bet is to use 
both organic and paid search, to cover all your bases.

136

Figure 7-3: 
You can tell 
which list-
ings people 
view the 
most.
 
What is it about a particular result listing — whether organic or paid — that 
most often captures the click? In a word, relevance. Optimized Web site titles 
and descriptions are consistently identified as the top items that induce 
people to click one result over another. Of course, a listing generally has 
more pieces to it than just those, so here’s how the overall hierarchy usually 
shakes out, in order of decreasing relevance to search engine users:
 
✓ The wording of the title and description: The same keywords people 
enter into their query show up here in boldface type (as shown in 
Figure 7-4).
 
✓ Offers and product information: Features, prices, special offers, prod-
uct comparisons, reviews, and the like.
 
✓ Consumer reviews: Almost two-thirds (62 percent) of consumers read 
online merchant reviews and 82 percent say it impacts their purchase 
decisions.
 
✓ Known and trusted business names and vendors: Household names are 
the leaders of the pack.
 
✓ Promises of added value: Percentage discounts, free shipping, and so on.
 
✓ The ability to book online: Register for an appointment or sign up for a 
free consultation.
 
✓ Trustworthy-sounding URLs: Use a short URL with your name in it, such as 
www.davesautoservice.com instead of www.cheapcarrepairs.com.
When you’re striving for success, you simply have no choice but to sharpen 
and fine-tune the way your business’s search listings appear — at least if you 
expect to get stellar marketing results.

Pairing Organic Search with Paid Search
Making organic search work well for your business, whether exclusively or 
with paid ads, requires some serious competence in the SEO department. So 
if your SEO skills aren’t well-honed, relying on organic search will likely mean 
settling, with the exception of those trusty local listings, for a weak search 
engine presence.
Ultimately, the argument for using both search engine tools is just too strong 
to ignore. Consider that leveraging organic results and paid search ads 
together will bring you
 
✓ More traffic: Although searchers go straight to the organic results first 
80 percent of the time, 60 percent of searchers click paid ads at least 
sometimes, and 12 percent click them either always or most of the time. 
Leave paid search ads out of your online marketing plan, and you’re sac-
rificing a lot of traffic.
 
✓ Better click-through rates: Recent research shows that Web sites listed 
at the top of both the organic and paid search results commonly enjoy 
a click-through rate that’s three times greater than Web sites appearing 
at or near the top of organic results alone. Experts attribute this to a 
second opinion effect: People who see a Web site appear in both paid and 
organic listings think that makes the site (and the business behind it) 
much more credible.
 
✓ Greater penetration: When you arrive at the right keywords and key-
word combinations, you rank well in organic search results. PPC can 
spring into action almost instantaneously. And even though it comes 
with a price tag, PPC can be turned on and off as needed, depending on 
your budget and any special promotions you want to put a big effort 
behind.
 
✓ More productive use of keywords: Several tools are available (such 
as the Google Keyword Tool and Wordtracker) that let you do key-
word research before you do any SEO or PPC work. As you make your 
keywords better and better, and thus improve your organic search 
rankings, you gain knowledge that can make your PPC response rates 
improve, too.

138
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Increased visibility: When your business’s name appears in either 
PPC or high-ranking organic search results, people see you. Using both 
approaches means they see twice as much of you. Remember, just 
because people don’t click your listings every time doesn’t mean you’re 
doing something wrong; at the very least, you have visibility for your 
company that you wouldn’t have enjoyed otherwise. You never know 
when your name will spontaneously pop up in someone’s mind at a later 
date thanks to the exposure you got in search engine results.
Among the ways you can use organic and paid search to create a unified 
and well-balanced strategy is to refine your keywords. We note earlier in this 
chapter that the primo keywords you arrive at through SEO can and should 
then be put into your PPC ads, but the reverse is true as well. You can run a 
short-term paid search campaign with the keywords you’re considering using 
for your SEO and get a fast read as to which ones get the highest response 
rate. You can then use those keywords to optimize your Web site and conse-
quently improve the results you get from organic search.
Another method is frequency. For success with paid and organic search, make 
sure that you sprinkle your best keywords liberally throughout your Web site. 
The more frequently (within reason) they appear, the better position you get 
through organic search. Search engines use frequency to determine what posi-
tion you get among the other PPC listings that appear in your category.
 
Although the frequency with which keywords appear on your Web site has 
a big impact on the search engine ranking you get, don’t go nuts. Slipping 
keywords into every other sentence makes it painful for readers to try to 
hack their way through your copy. (And they may well thank you for that 
by bailing out.) So, where your keywords fit naturally, great — by all means, 
put them in. But where they aren’t a natural fit, do your readers a favor and 
leave them aside.

Optimization

▶ Understanding how search engines do what they do
▶ Applying optimization to all aspects of your Web site
▶ Deciding whether to tackle optimization yourself
U
sing search engines to attract visitors to your local business is a theme 
that runs throughout this book. There’s a good reason for that: In all 
likelihood, more people will come to your Web site from a search engine than 
from any other source. Upwards of 80 percent of computer users visit search 
engines regularly, so indisputably, those engines represent the mother lode 
of potential customers for your local business.
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice that helps you take advan-
tage of how search engines organize content in the organic results of the 
search engine results page (SERP). This organization happen automatically 
as an outcome of an algorithm (a program employed by the search engines), 
which means that you don’t pay to get your Web site listed as you do when 
you run pay-per-click ads — see Chapter 9.
Essentially, search engines are trying to find the most relevant and most useful 
content for consumers who are searching. SEO done well, is the art of helping 
search engines be more effective and finding useful content. SEO done poorly 
attempts to trick the search engine into listing a Web site. In the long run, if 
a Web page does not provide value to the consumer, it will ultimately fail in 
its SEO efforts in that it clogs up the SERP with useless clutter — something

search engine companies have thousands of engineers trying to figure out 
how to avoid. Create useful content and structure in a way that is search 
friendly, and you will achieve higher search engine rankings and SEO suc-
cess. And that’s what this chapter is all about.
 
Getting click-throughs from organic search results can enhance your ROI 
(return on investment) because there’s no direct cost charged to your adver-
tising budget. Plus, of the 80 percent of computer users who use search 
engines, 75–80 percent of those tend to click an organic listing first, rather 
than a paid one. (We discuss some of the reasons for this habit in Chapter 7.)
Boil down these ideas, and you get this simple two-part formula: Search 
engines are critically important for driving people to your site. And practicing 
SEO is one of the primary ways your site achieves the greatest visibility on 
those search engines’ lists.
Leveraging Local Search Listings 
for Easy Visibility
Here comes a curve ball. The first subject we address in this SEO chapter 
is local search, a kind of search that doesn’t rely on SEO in the strict sense. 
However, local search is still a form of optimization, and looking at this type 
of search now — before we get into the details of real SEO — makes sense.
With local searches, you get the kind of optimization that helps maximize 
your overall presence and visibility on the Web; with SEO, the goal is to get 
better and better rankings among the organic listings that appear in search 
engine results.
We know that the distinction between these optimization goals is subtle, 
which we hope to clarify for you in this section. First, know three key things 
about local search:
 
✓ It’s (almost always) free.
 
✓ It takes relatively little effort on your part.
 
✓ For many searches it actually gives you a better position than all other 
regular organic listings that appear on the same results page.
That last point is where the optimization we’re talking about comes into play.

Your (nearly) top-dog status
Figure 8-1 shows the Google search results page for a search with local intent 
(in this case, roofer in denver). The hierarchy — from top to bottom — on 
such a page is pay-per-click (PPC) ads, local listings, and then organic list-
ings. But how, you ask, do you get yourself that nice, fat position with a 
local listing for your business? And why would search engines think it’s 
a good idea to give local listings such special treatment (and for free, 
no less)?
The how part is easy. Search engines obtain local listings, not through crawl-
ing around Web sites looking for useful keywords, but through information 
that you submit directly to the engines. A key part of that information is your 
location, including city, state, and zip code. That’s all the search engines 
really need in order to know that you belong in their local search results. 
Therefore, by submitting your location information, in effect, you are optimiz-
ing your exposure on the Web.
 
Because you furnish information directly to the search engines, you provide 
them with everything they need to give you a spot in their prominent local list-
ings. Your business doesn’t even need a Web site to get this preferential treat-
ment. Yes, you read that right. The information you fill in on the search engine 
form is enough in itself to get you into the local search game.
Regarding why local search results are given such prominence, the answer is 
that, like most of us, search engines want to be loved. Each engine wants to 
be everyone’s primary go-to resource because it can make more money that 
way. The major search engines realize that a huge and growing percentage of 
their users is looking primarily for local listings. Hence, they give those list-
ings a super-visible spot.
So, yes, local search really is one of those rare situations where everybody 
wins.
 
Before you start jumping up and down and shouting “Eureka! I’ve found the 
holy grail of search engine strategies and don’t need to know anything about 
SEO!” stop and consider that, first, you’re scaring the cat and, second, you’re 
leaving a whole lot of potential customers floating around beyond the reach of 
your online net. You should view local listings as additions to your SEO efforts 
if you really want to get the most out of organic search. In other words, local 
search should definitely be in the mix, but it can’t be the mix.

Counting the reasons to hook up 
with local searches
Local listings get preferential placement; getting listed takes relatively little 
effort on your part; and the number of people who use the major search 
engines as their means of finding local businesses is steadily growing. Yep, 
local listings are very cool things. So cool, in fact, that you’d be woefully 
remiss not to put them to work for your business. Here are some more 
reasons why:
 
✓ Invested time and effort is minimal: Local listings increase your busi-
ness’s visibility and traffic, and they can do it with relatively little effort 
on your part. Just fill out the search engine form, and you’re officially in 
the game. You don’t have to do any Web site optimization (which, we 
admit, can chew up some of your valuable time).
 
✓ Local listings find qualified customers: Thanks to the nature of local 
listings and the information you provide when creating your listing, 
odds are excellent that you’ll attract customers who live, work, or oth-
erwise hang out in the geographic area you serve — which can be a big 
help in generating repeat business.
 
 Anyone who’s looking for a business like yours in your locality is also 
probably ready to contact you right now. If your listing doesn’t show up 
on that person’s local search, you’re just kissing their business goodbye 
and driving them straight into the arms of a competitor.

143
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
 
✓ You can reach mobile searchers: Local listings display on cell phones 
and PDAs for the benefit of mobile consumers.
 
✓ Tracking results is simple: Even though local listings are less sophisti-
cated than some other online advertising techniques, the major search 
engines can provide you with some robust reporting tools to help you 
track results. For example, you can tell how many customers are finding 
you through local search and what keywords they’re using to find you.
 
✓ You can supply more than your location: In addition to posting your 
address and phone number in a local listing, you can include your hours 
of operation, photos and videos, and even online coupons. Some search 
engines charge a small fee for these fancier extras, but Google does not. 
An example of a Google form that lets you add extra elements is shown 
in Figure 8-2.

How to go local
Getting a local listing to show up prominently on a results page is very easy. 
You simply fill out a brief online form, and you’re off to the races.
You get the form directly from the search engines you want your listing to 
appear on. (You can find a listing of search engine links in Chapter 2.) The 
simple stuff that you enter is your name, your company’s name, and its 
address, phone number, and e-mail address.

144
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
The most important information that you enter is a description of your busi-
ness; the words you use to describe what the business offers help trigger 
the appearance of your listing on a search engine results page. The words in 
your description combined with the address information you enter create the 
hooks that will snag a search engine’s attention when a searcher enters some 
combination of those words and location as search terms.
 
Be careful with how your description presents your business. Keep your 
description brief, straightforward, and objective. Give the search engines the 
facts — just the facts. Search engines won’t accept a description that sounds 
too much like an advertisement. The minute you start sliding in adjectives 
(such as best, most experienced, lowest-priced, and so on), you’re probably just 
asking for trouble. If the search engines see advertising lingo, they smell spam, 
and they reject your listing.
When the type of business you’re in has many competitors whose descrip-
tions are similar, not all of the companies show up on any single search 
results page. Most search engines do a kind of random sampling of local 
listings to come up with the 5, 8, 10, or more selections that they list on any 
given page. Consequently, if the same user types exactly the same geographic 
modifier(s) again three seconds later, he’ll probably get a different mix of 
local listings.
 
Can you give your company a leg up in the round-robin local search process in 
addition to simply claiming your listing? Some experts say that including reviews 
you receive from customers or clients will give you a certain degree of prece-
dence, but that’s not a hard and fast rule. Remember that your listing will appear 
on a regular basis. And it’s not as if you’re paying for the privilege, right?
Describe yourself in 25 words (or so)
Here’s an example of how the description sec-
tion of a local search listing form might function. 
Suppose that you sell and install car stereo sys-
tems, and you figure your primary service area 
is northwest Tulsa. On the description line of the 
form, you enter: Brand-name car stereo electron-
ics and speakers sold and installed at two loca-
tions in northwest Tulsa. Your business might be 
found and listed if someone searches for
 ✓ car stereo tulsa: You have a good chance of 
popping up with this combination of terms 
unless Tulsa has an inordinately large 
number of car stereo businesses.
 ✓ car speakers oklahoma or car stereo 
installation eastern OK: With these combi-
nations, your ranking won’t be quite as high 
because a larger area (the state) is part of 
the search term.

Looking at local listing providers
Each of the major search engines has a somewhat different way of serving 
businesses that apply for inclusion in their local search results. The upcom-
ing sections tell you how each of today’s leading local search providers 
handles and presents the listings it posts.
Google Local Search
Not surprisingly, Google is considered by many to have the most powerful 
local search engine, in part because Google integrates a large and sophisti-
cated map alongside the local search results. The map has overlaid balloon 
icons that show the exact locations of the local businesses listed. Click a bal-
loon, and a larger balloon pops up showing that business’ full address and 
phone number, plus links (when applicable) to the company’s Web site, to 
customer reviews, and to driving directions.
If Google has already indexed your site automatically on the basis of your 
address and phone number, chances are you’ve already appeared in Google 
Local Search results (without those handy extra links). If that level of vis-
ibility is enough to satisfy you, you really don’t have to do anything else. If 
you want to explicitly add your company to Google Local Search, you do that 
through the Google Local Business Center at www.google.com/local/add. 
You need to have a Google account to post your listing, but you can open one 
completely free of charge.
Yahoo! Local Search
Yahoo! Local Search also provides a map pinpointing the local businesses 
listed, but it’s neither as large nor as sophisticated as the Google maps. 
Figure 8-3 shows a typical local results map on Yahoo!
Yahoo! and Google also have a different way of handling reviews. Google dis-
plays only pre-existing reviews that it gathers from other sites (for example, a 
site specializing in restaurant reviews), but Yahoo! lets anyone with a Yahoo! ID 
create a review directly on the local listing page where the business appears.
Yahoo! offers a basic, free service that provides you with a local listing. As long 
as you have (or get) a Yahoo! ID, you can add your local listing to their search 
engine, whether or not you currently have a Web site. If you don’t have an ID, 
Yahoo! also offers a free, five-page Web site just for signing up, which you can 
do at http://listings.local.yahoo.com/signup/create_1.php.
Yahoo! also offers an enhanced local listing for $9.95 a month; fork over that 
fee and you can include more detailed information, links to your coupons, and 
so on. And the fee will, in most cases, guarantee preferential placement in the 
local results (provided, of course, that your listing is sufficiently relevant to 
the search terms a user enters). You can find more information about these 
enhanced listings at http://listings.local.yahoo.com/#enhanced.

Bing Local Search
Formerly known as MSN.com, Bing is similar to Google in that your business 
already has an excellent chance of appearing in Bing Local Search results. 
But Bing goes about gathering companies’ information in a slightly different 
way. The folks at Bing get most of their information about a particular busi-
ness from local telephone records, so, if you have a valid business telephone 
listing in the White Pages or Yellow Pages, you’ll show up on Bing Local 
Search. Of course, you can (and should) also explicitly add and categorize 
your company, and it costs you nothing to do it. You can learn more about 
Bing’s Local Search program at the Bing Local Business Center, http://

Understanding How Search 
Engines Organize Content
We mention SEO in earlier chapters, but that just got your toes damp. Now 
we’re talking up-to-your-eyeballs immersion — or at least waist-level 
wading — to get you on track to optimize your business’s Web presence.
To get a handle on SEO, you need to understand exactly how search engines 
find and categorize the content that shows up in their non-local-search 
organic listings.

147
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
First, they crawl
Search engines rely on proprietary, automated software agents called spiders, 
crawlers, robots, and just plain bots. For simplicity’s sake, we refer to all these 
agents collectively as robots. These robots are the seekers of content on the 
Internet, and the content they find on individual Web pages plays a key role 
in how search engines operate.
The robots may be smart little critters, but they’re not human beings. They 
don’t see pictures. They can’t appreciate graphs. The only thing they can do 
is read what’s on a Web page, and further, they can read and understand only 
the text that’s laid out in a format that’s already been tuned to their needs. 
The process of tuning all your Web site’s pages to the needs of the various 
search engines is the core, the sine qua non, the beating heart of any success-
ful SEO strategy.
Robots primarily look for links. After all, the whole idea behind the Internet 
is that related pages and sites should be linked together, and robots simply 
follow that paradigm. Robots will find the important content within your site 
if (and, generally speaking, only if) other credible, reputable Web sites link to 
it. This process is referred to as building reciprocal links with other topically 
similar sites, and it enables people to reach your site with a click. A majority 
of the SEO game involves linking up with reciprocal sites (a subject we deal 
with in greater detail in the later section “External linking strategies”).
So, a robot is crawling around Site A where it finds a link to Site B. It follows 
that link and looks around Site B, absorbing the (properly formatted) text 
that Site B has to offer, including links to yet other sites. In the process, it 
reports to its search engine the URLs of the sites that it visits (and can under-
stand). These URLs show up in that search engine’s organic listings.
Then, they index
Search engines take all the goodies (URLs and key text) that the robots bring 
back and create an index or database. Each search engine has its own rules 
and algorithms that it uses to evaluate and score the information that its 
robots collect. After the search engine finds, evaluates, and deems your Web 
site worthy under its rules, it includes your Web site in the index. Therefore, 
your site is available to appear in the organic results when a searcher enters 
the relevant keywords in her query.
The search engine takes a searcher’s query and, at the speed of a finger snap, 
goes through a series of steps to determine which sites are the most relevant 
to that particular search. Those sites appear in the search results, which, 
considering the roughly three bazillion Web sites on the Net, is a pretty nifty 
accomplishment.

148
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Next, they rank
Even the highly relevant site listings that the search engine gleans from its 
index don’t just appear willy-nilly on the search results page. They’re ranked 
according to that search engine’s own particular, private, top-secret criteria.
We can’t know the top-secret criteria for sure, but Table 8-1 shows what we 
deduce as characteristics of ranking criteria from each of the three major 
search engines’ observable behavior.

Engine
Rank
Observations
Google
1st
Regarded by many to be the most accurate in terms of 
relevance; good at weeding out duplicate and irrelevant 
sites; favors off-page SEO (optimization based on links 
from well-established third-party sites) in determining 
rankings; good at filtering out sites built to artificially 
boost rankings (a form of spam)
Disappearing ink: A major search engine taboo
Did you ever play with disappearing ink when 
you were a kid? You’d write something in blue 
or black ink on a white piece of paper, and 
your writing was legible — but not for long. In 
10 minutes or so, the ink had magically disap-
peared into the paper.
A Web page equivalent of that funky old novelty 
is hidden text, and the people who use it are 
almost invariably spammers. In fact, the prac-
tice of using hidden text is often called search 
engine spam. The text is hidden by making it the 
same color as the background; human readers 
can’t see it, but search engine robots can. The 
robots simply register the fact that text is on the 
page and report the content back to the search 
engine whence they came.
What the spammer is trying to do is fool the 
search engine into thinking that a Web site has 
content that it really doesn’t have. For example, 
a site that sells used farm equipment adds 
hidden text about new farm equipment even 
though the site contains nothing readable (by 
humans) about new merchandise. And (use 
your imagination) some spammers get a lot 
more dastardly than that.
The bottom line is that hidden text can make a 
search engine’s results look un-useful and can 
ultimately degrade its overall performance and 
reputation. So the use of hidden text has — 
thankfully — been made illegal.
Good old disappearing ink, on the other hand, is 
probably still available out there. Somewhere.

2nd
Criticized by some as less accurate than Google or as 
aggressive at filtering out potentially deceptive sites; 
favors on-page SEO (optimization based on a site’s own

rankings; uses paid-inclusion listings, which can create

MSN)
3rd
Newer to the game than Google and Yahoo!; favors 
on-page SEO (like Yahoo!); some experts claimed that 
MSN wasn’t as good as Google or Yahoo! at avoiding 
spam sites or obviously artificial ones; however, all the 
changes to Bing with the new release make broad gen-
eralizations difficult at this point.
Making Your Site SEO Friendly
SEO helps search engines determine what your site and its pages are about, 
where they fit in the engine’s index, and how prominent a ranking they 
deserve. The better and more polished your (or your consultant’s) SEO skills, 
the greater the rewards. SEO can eventually get your business a place among 
the search engines’ most liked and list-worthy sites.
SEO is — and has to be — an ongoing, all-touching kind of strategy. Very little 
of a Web site’s content and structure can’t be optimized. Then, after a time, 
you revisit and re-optimize. When done correctly, your SEO efforts focus on 
everything from your content and tags to your links and filenames to your 
site map and coding. You can consider all these elements of your Web site as 
oars rowing in the same direction. They all represent the same unique and 
important subject: your business.
 
SEO greases the wheels of commerce and makes the cash register ring. You 
simply, truly, seriously can’t afford to ignore it. Similar to the considerations 
regarding your business Web site that we discuss at length in Chapter 4, the 
SEO process is something you (probably) shouldn’t tackle on your lonesome. 
Unless you’ve built your own site and can bring some serious optimization 
chops to the table, you’ll benefit immensely from the assistance of a profes-
sional SEO consultant. We think you’ll understand why we make this rec-
ommendation as we present the major elements that come into play in any 
search engine optimization strategy.

Selecting keywords
Consider this message carved in stone: Keywords form the nucleus of any 
proper SEO effort, and carefully selecting the right keywords is absolutely 
critical to your success.
The process for selecting keywords has two parts:
 
✓ Creating a list of possible keywords. Review your site content to iden-
tify which keywords (word combinations and phrases) describe the 
main categories of your business. Write down every relevant keyword 
under each category you find. Expand the list by including all of your 
brand and product names, as well as plurals and synonyms for each 
word or phrase on your initial list. Also, remember to think like your 
customers: How might your customers ask for your product or service?
 
✓ Narrowing the list to the best keywords. Delete generic keywords on 
your list that could relate to a wide spectrum of products or services; 
and because one-word keywords are likely to be too generic, try using 
two- or three-word phrases. Also, delete keywords that aren’t closely 
related to your primary landing page themes. (See Chapter 5 for more 
about landing pages.)
Maybe you think this selection process sounds easy, but it isn’t. It’s not 
exactly astrophysics either; we help you take the steps that turn plain old, 
average, everyday words into big, bright search engine signposts.
Creating a keyword list
Start by putting yourself in your customers’ shoes. It’s probably safe to 
assume that they see your business somewhat differently than you do. After 
all, you’re on the inside; you know the jargon; you know what’s really impor-
tant and what isn’t.
But your customers only know that they need the kind of product or ser-
vice your business offers. Consequently, the words they pump into a search 
engine are probably simple, basic, down-to-earth, and, in the eyes of insid-
ers (that’s you), amateurish. Your customers choose different, non-jargony 
words because they’re on the outside of your business. Time for you to think 
like an outsider, too.
Suppose that you’re an optician. As someone familiar with an optician’s 
business, you might search for diopter, astigmatism, or flexible titanium alloy 
temples. But your average customer is probably going to look for glasses, eye 
tests, or contact lenses.

151
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
 
Your prospective customers aren’t professionals in your field. They go for the 
simple, direct, painfully obvious words to describe your products or services.
Fortunately, you don’t have to fly blind to come up with a list of the keywords 
your customers might choose. Basic research can get you on your way to 
building a solid keyword list. You can
 
✓ Take advantage of excellent sites where you find free keyword tools, 
including
 
• Wordtracker: Helps you identify the keywords you need to rise 
above your competitors in the search engine rankings. (www.
wordtracker.com)
 
• Google Keyword Tool: Offers you an easy way to generate a list of 
relevant keywords and phrases. (https://adwords.google.
com/select/KeywordToolExternal)
 
✓ Find out what keyword tags your competitors are using; you’ll find them 
through the source code link on their Web sites, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 
✓ If you already use keywords, check your site analytics to find out which 
words work best to drive traffic to your site.

Combine the words you find through your research into a large list of poten-
tial keywords for your site. The list no doubt contains many more keywords 
than you can actually use, but that’s okay. Doing the research helps build a list 
of qualified words to choose from. The following list gives an example of the 
potential keywords for a plumber in Brooklyn, New York:
24 7 plumber greenpoint
24 7 plumbing service park slope
24 hour maintenance plumber brooklyn ny

Narrowing your keyword list
When you’re ready to take the plunge into selecting your own keywords from 
the vast pool of possibilities, consider these important strategies:
 
✓ Avoid broad keywords: The more general and generic a keyword, the 
harder it will be for that keyword to produce a respectable rank on a 
search results page. Using the keyword veterinarian is fine if you person-
ally have 300 clinics scattered around the country. But if you have only 
one and it’s located just outside Cleveland, you’ll rank a lot higher by 
using veterinarian shaker heights or veterinarian 44120 instead. If you 
offer a not-too-common service (such as boarding), you can include that 
specific in your keywords, too. The combination veterinarian boarding 
44120 should work nicely.

153
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
 
✓ Avoid vague keywords: Some keywords can have alternative meanings, 
so beware. A person searching for pipe repair might be looking for a 
plumber, someone to clean a pipe organ, or fix an antique briar smoking 
pipe. So if you run a plumbing business specializing in repair, try using 
kitchen pipe repair or bathroom pipe repair as a keyword combination to 
attract the right searchers.
 
✓ Use keyword modifiers: Use modifiers that allow your pages to be found 
under a variety of searches and give you a higher ranking. Table 8-2 shows 
various modifiers — some obvious and others not so — that you might 
consider using.

Adjusting site structure
Search engines use cues from you to determine how best to index your site 
for Web searchers. These cues usually include everything from what you 
name your Web pages to how they’re linked together to how a searcher 
might be expected to navigate from one page to another. The net result is 
that how your Web site is structured affects its ability to attract the attention 
of search engines and influences how good a ranking it gets in the search 
results.
Pay attention to the names you give your site’s pages. Don’t give your pages 
generic, computer-geek names like page1.html. Instead, use filenames that 
include the keywords you’re trying to rank with. So, if your page is about 
Chicago florists, name the page chicago-florists.html. Assigning meaningful 
page names is the sort of little tweak that can make a meaningful difference in 
your search engine rankings.

Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Filling up your footers
In the footer section of your Web site, including anchor text links to impor-
tant pages on your site is a good idea. Anchor text is the visible, clickable 
text in a hyperlink. For example, rather than using Click here, which tells 
the search engines nothing, a plumber might use anchor text such as 
Troubleshooting Common Household Plumbing Problems. Such links help tell 
search engines what the linked to page are about. (Just be careful not to 
overdo it and look like you’re trying to stuff keywords that have no real 
purpose into the footer.) The footer is also a great place to include your full 
contact information, including your phone number, and company information 
like privacy policies, terms of use, and so on. This kind of link helps search 
engines tie your Web site to a certain location and helps you rank better in 
localized searches.
 
A lot of things in life are annoying, but right up near the top of the list are Web 
sites that make finding the business contact information about as easy as find-
ing cattle in Manhattan. If a customer needs help now, don’t make them truck 
through a bunch of links or pages to find your phone number. By the time they 
do find it, chances are they won’t be in a pleasant mood — and won’t be much 
fun to talk to. Put your business contact information in the footer so it’s avail-
able from any page.
Including site maps
A site map is a page within your Web site that clearly lays out the hierarchy 
of your site. Think of the site map as a sort of outline of your site’s content. 
Having a clear site map readily available makes navigating your site easier for 
both visitors and search engine robots alike.
A good free tool that can create an effective site map for you is available at 
www.xml-sitemaps.com. After the tool completes the creation part, you 
simply upload the site map file to your Web site and put a link to it on each of 
your pages.
Making good use of tags
Web site tags fall into four basic categories, each of which has a potential to 
affect your site’s SEO positively:
 
✓ Meta tags: Each page on your site should have unique meta tags that 
encapsulate — briefly and precisely — what the content of that page is 
about. You can use up to 10 keywords in a meta tag, but don’t repeat the 
same word over and over or the whole meta tag gets watered down into 
uselessness, and search engines ignore them. A good meta tag example 
is shown in Figure 8-5.

155
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
 
✓ Meta descriptions: A meta description is a short summary of each 
page’s content, and each page should have its own unique summary. 
(See Figure 8-5.) Meta tags contain the keywords that help your site 
get noticed, but perhaps more importantly meta descriptions contain 
the copy that will often show up verbatim on a search engine’s results 
page (depending on the exact search). This copy can often have a huge 
impact on whether or not a searcher ultimately clicks on your listing 
in the organic results. You usually draw the meta description text from 
copy that already exists within your site; it can be up to a few sentences 
in length and will include your keywords within it.
 
✓ Title tags: Each page on your site should have its own unique title tag 
of 65 characters or less (no cheating), and the title should include two 
or three keywords that you want to be ranked by. Figure 8-6 shows a 
sample title tag.
 
✓ Alt tags: Search engines can’t read images that you use on your site, but 
they can read the alt text that’s associated with each image. This alt tag 
is simply a label that you hang on each of your site’s images. It describes 
(with the inclusion of some keywords) what that image shows. Alt tags 
can help both organic search as well as when someone searches spe-
cifically for images (on Google for instance you can do this at http://
images.google.com). Figure 8-7 is an example of a good alt tag.

At the risk of sounding like we’re pulling the old bait-and-switch routine on 
you, we need to tell you that as widely used as tags have been in the past, 
they’re becoming less and less important to search engines themselves. At one 
time, search engines relied heavily on tags to order their search results. But 
they’ve become victims of too many unscrupulous people who use tags to try 
to game the search engine system. (Google, for one, is good and sick of this 
play, and many experts suggest that they are on the verge of implementing 
a little doohickey that will make most tags irrelevant to the ordering of their 
search results.) Nevertheless, tags are still very important to the businesses 
that appear in search results because tags are often, in essence, the copy that 
searchers see as part of each local listing. To boil it down: Tags today mean 
less to the search engines themselves but remain highly important to the search-
ers who use the engines and to the local businesses whose listings they find.
Page optimization
Like your site as a whole, each page of your site can and should be optimized 
because such optimization has a lot to do with how well you’ll be ranked. 
Search engines just love fresh and unique content — so much so that their 
robots routinely cruise your site to see whether you’ve done something new. 
As always, the more relevant your content is to your keywords, the better.

157
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
When you set about optimizing each page, keep these things in mind:
 
✓ Sprinkle — don’t drench — your site with keywords. Include your key-
words throughout your site’s content — but don’t go crazy. Write natu-
rally and don’t try to stuff 10 pounds of whatever into a five-pound bag. 
Ditto on a per-page basis: Repeating your keywords over and over on a 
page is annoying to readers. Search engines are smart enough to realize 
what you’re trying to do — and will penalize you in the rankings.
 
✓ Favor specific phrases over single keywords. Forget about trying to 
rank well for globally applicable, one-word keywords (such as dentist). 
Getting properly noticed by using single keywords runs the short gamut 
from incredibly difficult to completely impossible. Concentrate instead 
on two- or three-word phrases (such as family dentist Philadelphia or 
dental veneers 19104), and you’ll get better rankings and better-qualified 
visitors.
 
✓ Limit the number of keyword phrases used on any one page. Be aware 
that search results are based on a number of factors, a primary one 
being the relevance of those results to the terms the searcher is using. 
If you’re targeting 10, 20, or 30 search terms per page, your page loses 
focus and really winds up not being about anything. A better SEO prac-
tice is to concentrate on just one or two phrases per page. For this prac-
tice, less is invariably more.
 
✓ Keep your content fresh. Remember that the robots are out there, look-
ing and feasting. Give them something new and tasty to feed on.
 
✓ Mind the look and position of keywords. Put your keywords in bold 
or italicized type, as search engines will give these more importance. 
(Again, don’t go crazy with keyword repetition, or the page will look, 
well, awful.) Generally, the higher your keywords appear on the page, 
the better the score you’ll get from a search engine.
 
✓ Break down your content. Use headlines, sub-headlines, and bullet 
points to present your page content. Don’t think narrative stream, think 
chunks. Include your keywords in these elements, too, because that will 
only help your ranking.
 
✓ Avoid borrowed content. Search engines have a way of remembering 
everything — including content they’ve seen on another Web site. If that 
same content suddenly shows up, word for word, on yours, they won’t 
turn you over to the authorities, but they may decide to dock your rank-
ings big time.
Figure 8-8 illustrates how keywords can be used effectively — but judiciously — 
on a sample Web page.

Internal linking strategies
Linking to the other pages within your Web site is a good way to help both 
visitors and robots find their way around. Such links are often found within 
anchor text, and are descriptive so that the links seem to occur naturally. The 
links themselves blend in with the message presented in the anchor text.
For example, having this anchor text (with link) on your Web site
Check out our many plumbing services and let us know how we can 
help you.
is much better than having
Click here to see our plumbing services.
Also, links that appear within a block of text tend to have higher search-
ranking value than links that are isolated. Like keywords, the higher a link 
appears on the page, the more weight search engines give it.

159
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
External linking strategies
Search engine rankings are a lot like a popularity contest. If your site is linked 
to by several credible third-party sites, a search engine will think you never 
have trouble getting a prom date, and they’ll give you a nice healthy spot in 
their rankings. To gain the right kind of popularity, these other sites must 
be credible. A credible third-party site is one that has an identifiable brand 
name (Wikipedia, The New York Times, and so on), strong organic rankings of 
its own, lots of traffic, and plenty of inbound links.
 
Getting linked to by spam sites, for example, can actually harm your site’s 
reputation — and your rank. So, to protect your site’s reputation and its 
search engine rankings, you’ll want to have your Web site linked to from as 
many other quality (what we call credible) sites as possible.
How exactly do you pull off this linking magic? Here are a few ideas:
 
✓ Have excellent content. Build a Web site with content so interesting, 
unique, or indispensable that other sites will want to link to you. It really 
is a case of “if you build it, they will come.” Remember that those other 
folks want to make their sites interesting, unique, or indispensable, too, 
and they’ll be looking for links that make them look good. Some easily 
implementable ideas for content formats include videos, blogs, or a tip 
of the day. (See Chapter 5 for more on online video and Chapter 13 for a 
discussion on blogs.)
 
✓ Ask. (There’s a wild and crazy idea.) Go to the owner of another, related 
site, and simply ask to add a link for your site on his or her site. The 
price for this link will likely be a reciprocal link on your site — but, hey, 
fair’s fair.
 
✓ Submit press releases to some of the many PR sites. Just make sure 
that your release actually contains some news of real interest. (No one 
will care, for example, that your basset hound just had puppies.) But 
when you’ve recently become a dealership for some new product, done 
a service job of note, or won a commendation or award, submit that 
information. PR folks eat up that stuff.
 
✓ Submit your Web site to the directories that list companies like yours.
 
✓ Participate in blogs, and link back to your site from your signature. 
You’d be amazed how many clicks you can get from doing this — and 
the search engines will duly note your link, as well.
 
For super, double-good rankings, make sure to include your target keywords 
in the link that other people put on their site. Search engines will see it and 
give you points for your keywords, thus killing the proverbial two birds with 
one link.

160
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Domain names and URLs
Search engines like domain names that include keywords within them. So, 
if you’re trying to get rankings for the keyword phrase Phoenix Electricians, 
www.phoenixelectricians.com would be a better, stronger URL than 
www.wiredelectricians.com. Even if your primary URL won’t comfort-
ably accommodate a keyword or two, you can always register a secondary 
URL designed to house your targeted words nicely.
Looking at Rankings with 
the Proper Perspective
After your Web site is built, optimized, and online, your next step is to sit 
down. Breathe deeply. Put your feet up. And be patient.
Neither Rome nor Des Moines was built in a day, and so it is with getting 
search engines to list you. Back when search engines were new and only a 
few intrepid souls had figured out how to use them, a listing would appear 
in no time at all. Today, the wait for a decent listing position can be weeks, 
months, even (gasp) a year or more. Because search engines favor great 
content and inbound links so much and getting those things takes time, it’s 
important to understand that SEO is, by definition, a gradual process.
You may also experience delayed gratification because of the pecking order. 
Your site may well show up within a few weeks but fall on page 73 of the 
listings where no one will ever find you. Slowly, you’ll climb as other sites 
fall off. Maybe a little more optimization can help you leapfrog some sites 
between you and the top, but even that takes time.
Here are a few things you can do while you’re waiting:
 
✓ Search your own keywords on the various search engines. See 
whether your local competitors have a decent position in the rankings. 
This exercise gives you a real-world understanding of exactly what 
you’re up against (which may not be much of a comfort, but it’s better 
than not knowing, right?)
 
✓ Add new content to your site on an aggressive, ongoing basis. Think 
about how you might incorporate tips, case studies, reviews, or other 
new elements that will spice up the information on your site and keep 
the robots interested. When these added features repeat your keywords, 
extra search engine brownie points will probably come your way.

161
 Chapter 8: Getting Web Traffic for Free
 
✓ Don’t kid yourself. If you were smart enough to figure out a foolproof 
way to rocket yourself up to the top of the listings, you’d be smart 
enough to pull off a massive Swiss bank heist and wouldn’t need a Web 
site to begin with. No, Virginia, there are no shortcuts. The major search 
engines have already seen many scams and have cut the scammers off at 
the knees. (Anyone who tells you he can successfully cheat the system 
is pulling your leg.)
 
✓ Don’t take it personally. How well your Web site ranks has little to 
do with how well you run your business and do your job. Ranking is 
a reflection of how good your site is on its own and in relation to your 
competition’s sites. More accurately, ranking really reflects how good a 
bunch of search engine people you’ve never met (and never will) think 
your site is. In times of distress, repeat to yourself 20 times in rapid suc-
cession: “Pffft. What do they know?” When it comes down to your busi-
ness and your industry, the answer is: A whole lot less than you do.
Getting Help Optimizing Your Web Site
Here’s that pesky subject again: Should you or should you not get SEO help 
from a professional? This question is as relevant to SEO as it is to the initial 
building of your site. (See Chapter 5 for that lengthy discussion.)
In either case, put the question into context before you make a decision. The 
two most meaningful contextual issues are
 
✓ Time: How much do you have? Maybe you run a busy dental practice 
and, between seeing patients and doing paperwork, you barely have 
time for lunch much less for noodling with SEO. If so, get a pro.
 
 On the other hand, maybe your business is small and seasonal. In that 
case, going the DIY route may make perfect sense.
 
✓ Expertise: Do you have it or not? If you have a lot of experience with com-
puters and the Internet, you could be a great candidate for handling your 
own SEO. If you don’t, you’re probably not — so put a pro on the case.
Some DIY resources
Deciding to go with DIY SEO doesn’t mean that you have to do it all alone. 
Here are some great resources to help you get started:

Using an SEO professional: Some tips
If you decide to go with an outside SEO consultant, proceed with caution. 
You’ll find a lot of consultants and companies offering SEO services so do 
your research — your due diligence — before you sign up with any SEO pro-
fessional. You should
 
✓ Ask for references and examples of work they’ve done for other busi-
nesses. And when you get references, call them.
 
✓ Ask how much experience they have working with businesses in your 
industry. After all, you want to pay them to make (and keep) your Web 
site optimized, not to start learning about your business, industry, and 
customers from the ground up.
 
✓ Ask them how long they’ve been in the SEO business. And confirm the 
answer you get. (Hint: If the answer is “Since 1947,” move on.)
 
✓ Ask what type of service and periodic reporting to expect. Also, find 
out whom you can speak to if you have questions or problems.
 
✓ Ask how they gauge success. Do they measure success by good rank-
ings? Number of clicks? Conversion rates? It matters because you don’t 
want to work with someone whose definition of success is markedly dif-
ferent from your own.
 
✓ Ask them if they require that you sign a contract and find out what 
the terms of that contract are. How long is the contract term? What’s 
their cancellation policy? Are there any money-back guarantees? If the 
answers make you queasy, step out for some air. And keep going.
 
Don’t let the number and tone of the questions you need answered strike you 
with fear and loathing regarding the use of SEO professionals. We believe 
that some very good consultants and companies can take a great weight off 
your shoulders while earnestly and efficiently fostering your success. Here 
are some great resources for finding the kind of SEO consultant or company 
you’re really looking for:

The Nuts and Bolts of Search 
Engine Advertising
In This Chapter
▶ Picking your advertising strategy
▶ Setting up a paid search account
▶ Determining how much to bid for keywords
▶ Writing ads that generate leads and sales
▶ Tracking results and refining your efforts
▶ Deciding whether to implement search engine advertising yourself
T
hink of search engine marketing as a friendly two-headed creature. One 
head is organic listings (see Chapter 8), which are the non-paid, just-
sort-of-happen-when-you-set-up-your-site-right listings that make up the vast 
majority of search engine results. The more effectively you optimize and 
refine your Web site, the higher the rank that search engines will give your 
listing on their search engine results pages (SERPs). The other head is paid 
search advertising (or pay-per-click [PPC] ads or sponsored listings), which is 
what this chapter is all about.
Paid search advertising is the crown jewel of search — and rightly so — 
because it’s one of the fastest and most effective ways to bring customers 
who are ready to buy straight to your Web site. Paid search is fast because, 
after you set a ceiling on the amount you’ll spend per click and per day, if 
that ceiling is high enough to make you competitive with others bidding 
on the same keywords, your ad will appear immediately among the most 
prominent listings on a SERP. (Organic listings, on the other hand, will often 
rise in the rankings much more slowly as your optimization efforts take 
hold.) As for effectiveness, paid search allows you to specifically target 
people searching for the exact products and services you offer in the exact 
location you offer them. Additionally, paid search allows you to specifi-
cally tailor your message depending on the exact keyword the consumer 
searched for. How’s that for effective?

166
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Sponsored listings have a couple other things going for them, too. They’re 
extremely easy to measure, so you can keep track, on a nearly real-time basis, 
of how well your investment performs. You can also tweak your listings for 
better and better performance as often as you like.
Using a Proven Strategy 
for Small Business
Organic listings are great, but you face long odds of getting ranked among your 
top competitors on a SERP unless your optimization efforts have been sharp-
ened to a fine edge. That’s why you should seriously — and we mean seriously — 
consider coupling your organic listings with a paid search campaign.
Paid search has the following benefits:
 
✓ Low initial risk: If you have reservations about paying for a search 
engine listing, you can dip your toe in the water by allocating a modest 
initial investment to see what happens. If your Web site starts buzzing 
and your phone starts ringing, great. Invest more in paid search adver-
tising. On the other hand, if the results are pretty anemic, you can either 
work on improving your listing to make it more compelling or go back to 
relying on organic listings alone.
 
✓ Control: With paid search, you can control exactly which search queries 
(or keywords) you want the appearance of your ad(s) to be triggered by, 
and depending on your budget, you can also control how high up on the 
SERP your ad appears. In any case, you completely decide the maximum 
amount you’re willing to pay for each click and the total amount you’re 
willing to spend each day. Paid search also lets you control exactly what 
your ad says.
 
✓ Speed: Search engines post your paid listing about as quickly as it took to 
type this sentence, and you can remove your ad just as quickly. Speed is a 
major distinguishing factor between paid and organic search. In the latter 
case, even the best search engine optimization (SEO — see Chapter 8 for 
more information) efforts can take weeks, even months, to pay off.
 
✓ Measurability: The major search engines’ (Google, Yahoo!, and Bing) 
paid search platforms produce a ton of data on everything from how 
many impressions and clicks you’re receiving on a specific keyword, to 
how much each keyword costs, to the average position your ad gets on 
the page for each keyword that searchers use. You can also track how 
many people (again, on a keyword basis) fill out forms, claim coupons, 
or contact you by phone or e-mail, turning themselves into leads. That 
gives you a way to figure out your cost-per-lead (CPL), which in turn 
helps you figure out your return on investment (ROI). (For more on how 
to calculate CPL, ROI, and other handy metrics, see Chapter 6.)

167
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
 
✓ Highly qualified traffic: Studies routinely show that although the lion’s 
share of clicks go to organic listings, all clicks aren’t created equal. 
People who click sponsored listings are far more primed to buy. With 
paid listings, you sell to folks who have their hands on their wallets. 
(The fact that this may make it a little difficult for them to type shouldn’t 
concern you.)
Following a Step-by-Step 
Guide to Paid Search
Done on a basic level, running a paid search campaign is surprisingly easy. 
Doing it on the most advanced level, however, pretty much takes either 
a degree in differential calculus or a highly excellent and comprehensive 
resource like Google AdWords For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Howie Jacobson.
In this chapter, we give you a solid understanding of the all-important basics: 
how paid search advertising works and the simple tools you need to get 
started. Like most things having to do with search engines, the first and fore-
most provider of paid search listings is Google. When you understand the 
mechanics of Google AdWords, you’ll know just about all you really need to 
know about basic paid search. So we spend a lot of time looking through the 
Google AdWords lens; from there, you get a good sense of how other major 
search engines like Yahoo! and Bing do it, too.
When it comes to paid search, the single most important factor is relevance, 
meaning that each of your paid listings must relate tightly to your keywords, 
your ad copy, and your landing page. Done right, the flow from one to the 
next will be seamless. The simple truth is that relevance is about good old-
fashioned marketing.
For example, if someone searches for teeth whitening and you serve him up 
ad copy that talks about teeth pulling, he’s probably not going to click your 
ad. That can’t be blamed on Google or a search engine algorithm; it’s just that 
potential customers are, by nature, looking for ad copy that is both relevant 
to their search and that makes it easy for them to recognize that relevance. 
Give them those two things, and they’ll be disposed to buy. Don’t do it, and 
they’ll be disposed to flee.
Setting up an account
Getting an account set up with one of the major search engines is easy. Go 
to the main site and navigate to the ad department, where you’ll find the 
instructions you need to get up and running with a paid search account.

168
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Of course, the major search engines are in constant competition for your 
advertising dollar and will try to entice you into their own corral with slightly 
different features and tools. Here’s a look at some of the things they offer:
 
✓ Google AdWords: There’s no way around the fact that Google is the king 
of PPC. Not only does Google provide sponsored listings on its search 
pages, but the Google Search Network also supplies paid search ads to 
second-tier search engines, such as Ask.com and AOL, and its Content 
Network does the same for subject-specific sites such as WebMD and 
HGTV.com. Google AdWords offers the Keyword Tool, which lets sub-
scribers see exactly how often Web users search for a particular word 
or phrase, and then provides an estimate of the cost-per-click (CPC) for 
that word or phrase. AdWords give you other tools, too. Content Match, 
for example, allows subscribers to broaden their marketing reach within 
Gmail and other sites that have signed on with Google to share PPC 
advertising space, whereas Geo-Targeting lets you specifically target 
those customers who are looking for local services. (www.google.com/
adwords)
 
✓ Yahoo! Search Marketing (YSM): This may stand in the shadow of 
the Google colossus, but YSM is still an important player in the search 
engine field and shouldn’t be ignored. Yahoo! offers its set of tools to 
help you manage your paid listings, including one that forecasts the 
number of clicks you’ll receive based on your maximum CPC. (http://
advertising.yahoo.com/smallbusiness/ysm)
 
✓ Microsoft adCenter: The father of Bing, MSN takes a somewhat different 
approach than the other two and lets its users select the target-audience 
demographics (such as location, household income, age, educational 
level, and so on) that they especially want to cater to. (Demographic 
targeting has been the foundation of the conventional advertising indus-
try since, oh, forever.) (http://advertising.microsoft.com/
search-content-advertising)
After you sign up with one or more of these search engines, you take the fol-
lowing steps before launching your account. We address these steps through-
out this chapter, but for now, here’s a very general overview (see Figure 9-1 
for a visual representation of these steps as seen from the viewpoints of busi-
nesses, consumers, and the metrics you use to measure it all):
 
1. Select your keywords and match type.
 
 See the sidebar, “The match game,” for more about match types.
 
2. Organize the keywords into campaigns and ad groups.
 
3. Write your ad copy.
 
4. Create a relevant landing page for each ad.
 
5. Most important, attend to your new customers.

Developing a keyword portfolio
Keywords are what searchers type into a search engine to find you. When 
selecting keywords you want to be found with its critically important that 
you think like a consumer, not like a business owner.
 
Your customers are people, and a lot of folks aren’t so good at typing, spelling, 
grammar, punctuation, and so on. To be on the safe side and get as many ad-
clickers as you can, consider bidding on keyword aberrations that take these 
innocent mistakes into account.
Google’s Quality Score
When figuring out just how relevant a certain 
paid listing is to a given search query — and 
therefore, how prominent a position that list-
ing will get — Google factors in a Quality 
Score. Admittedly, the Quality Score is sort 
of an intangible factor, but it’s very important 
nonetheless.
Other major search engines have their own ver-
sions of the Quality Score, which kind of serves 
as an equalizer to the auction-based ad place-
ments so that the results that appear toward 
the top are relevant, even though they’re paid 
for. If that wasn’t the case, the highest bidder 
would always get the best position, and you’d 
see some icky sites at the top of a given SERP. 
Eventually, users would revolt and use another 
search engine, and the offending engine would 
lose money.
So Google (and the others) also gives ads a kind 
of bonus for their degree of relevance. The idea 
is that a high Quality Score entitles a listing to a 
higher ranking on a Google SERP than a given 
bid amount (with a lower Quality Score) would 
warrant. Some of the factors that go into the 
awarding of a specific Quality Score are
 ✓ Your click-through rate (CTR), meaning 
what percentage of people who see your 
ad are actually clicking it.
 ✓ The structure of your ad groups, or how 
your keywords are organized. (We dive 
deeper into the subject of ad groups later 
in this chapter.)
 ✓ The relevance of your ad copy to the key-
word searched. This is a judgment call on 
Google’s part, and although it knows what 
its reasons are for making a specific deter-
mination, those reasons are deliberately 
kept undisclosed so advertisers can’t easily 
game the system.
 ✓ The relevance of your landing page to the 
keyword searched (another factor whose 
calculation method Google keeps pretty 
close to its vest). But worth mentioning is 
that Google will stop running your ads if it 
determines that your landing page’s rel-
evance falls short.
To demonstrate how a Quality Score works, 
take the teeth whitening example from earlier 
in this chapter. Obviously a query for teeth whit-
ening is dead-on in relevance. But what about 
teeth cleaning, elective dentistry, or brighter 
smile? They’re all relevant, kind of. But surely 
they aren’t all equally relevant. And that’s what 
the Quality Score sorts. Google uses all the fac-
tors described in the preceding list and arrives 
at an order of relevance.

 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
Choosing the keywords you’re willing to pay for in a sponsored listing is 
really no different than choosing them for your unpaid, organic listing. In 
both cases, you need to
 
✓ Identify your target audience: Who are you trying to reach? Which of 
these people are the most likely to buy soon? Where do they perform 
searches — at home, at work, or both? As the owner of an ongoing local 
business, you can probably intuit a lot of this. But, particularly where 
you’re looking to expand the breadth of your customer base, let your 
imagination do some of the work. Imagine who your new target is. Is she 
well-educated, part of mid-to-senior-level management, into sports, into 
cooking, into bird-watching? Or is she probably none (or only a few) 
of those things? In any case, try to create a three-dimensional persona 
for her in your head — then, with your innate smarts, take an educated 
guess as to what search terms someone like that would be likely to use. 
(Truth be told, it’s not just important that you do this, it’s also kind of fun.)
 
✓ Brainstorm: What are all the formal/informal/colloquial/technical ways 
to describe your service or product? How do customers phrase what 
they’re looking for when they call your business on the phone or email 
you? Brainstorm and write down as many keywords as you can possibly 
think of that your target audience might use to get to you. Don’t edit 
that list — at least not yet. Come back to it later and see whether the 
keywords you already have inspire you to come up with still more. Then, 
don’t edit those either. You probably won’t bid on them all, but doing this 
kind of mental core dump will shortly prove to be an important step.
 
✓ Review your log files: The Web server that hosts your site keeps log files 
of each and every visitor who comes to your Web site, and these files 
can be invaluable. Analyze this data using a log file analyzer or basic Web 
analytics (some places you can do this include www.weblogexpert.
com, www.sawmill.net, or www.splunk.com) to find out which search 
engine(s) your visitors came from, what keywords they used, what time 
of day and which day they visited, what browser they used, and so on. 
These are all highly good and illuminating things to know.
 
✓ Research and analyze the top-ranked sites in your category: Put each 
of your keyword candidates (see the earlier Brainstorm bullet) into a 
major search engine. What appears? Anything useful? Eventually, a word 
here and a word there will generate results that include highly ranked 
sites. Now, go to those sites and look at their meta tags (which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 8; these are usually the title, description, and keyword 
tags) by following these steps:
 
1. With the site you wish to view loaded in your browser, choose View➪
Source (Internet Explorer) or View➪Page Source (Mozilla Firefox).
 
2. In the code that appears, find <meta name = “description”> 
or <meta name = “keywords”> and look at the keywords and 
phrases located within the quotation marks.

172
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
 If these top-ranked sites have good keywords that apply to your busi-
ness as well, add those keywords to your list. If they’re already on your 
list, circle or highlight them. These are definite keepers.
 
✓ Research and analyze your direct competition: A lot of the top-ranked 
sites aren’t going to affect your own business all that much. Either they 
serve a different locality or their goods and services are at a different 
price point or quality level than yours. What you really want to know is 
what keywords your direct competition is using. Back to the meta tags 
you go. What are the title, description, and keywords you find there? 
And what’s in there that you, too, can use?
Metadata is, in effect, in the public domain because its purpose is to inform 
search engines’ robots as to the subject matter of the site. So, unless a key-
word is an individual’s name or a trademarked word or phrase, feel free to 
use it.
Testing your keywords
Use one of the commercially available keyword tools both to identify addi-
tional promising keywords and to get rid of some of your turkeys. Two of the 
most popular keyword research tools are
 
✓ Google AdWords Keyword Tool: Type one of your keyword candidates 
into the text box and then out comes the number of searches for that 
word that Google has counted to date. This tool also takes an educated 
stab at providing you with other associated keywords, including combi-
nations and permutations of them. (http://adwords.google.com/
select/KeywordToolExternal)
 
✓ Wordtracker: This tool offers a large number of keyword phrases that 
are related to the keywords you enter into the text box. Wordtracker 
also comes in two versions: free (http://freekeywords.
wordtracker.com) and paid (http://wordtracker.com). The 
free one gives you up to 100 related search phrases, which helps you 
determine the most popular keyword phrases currently being used to 
find products and services like yours in search engine queries. If you’re 
going to be administering a significant PPC campaign, use the paid 
version, which you can do on a monthly or annual subscription basis. 
Because the PPC universe is constantly shifting, today’s best keywords 
won’t necessarily be tomorrow’s, and you want to be able to use a good 
keyword tool again and again.
The last step in building a keyword list (for either organic search engine opti-
mization or a PPC program) is to sort and filter your list. This means subject-
ing each of your prospective keywords to at least two different filters:

173
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
 
✓ Relevance: If a keyword is too broad or ambiguous, traffic will be unpre-
dictable and will most likely surface higher in the buying funnel. (That’s 
fancy talk for the tire-kicking stage.) If the keyword is specific enough, 
though, the people who enter it are probably more likely to buy.
 
• For instance, surgeon is too broad, whereas rhinoplasty surgeon is 
nice and specific (assuming you do nose jobs).
 
• If you’re selling tankless water heaters, just using water heaters is 
likely to be too broad, so tankless water heaters is definitely the 
way to go.
 
✓ Popularity: This can be looked at as search volume combined with 
popularity amongst advertisers. Some keywords may have such a high 
frequency of being used in searches and are so valuable to advertis-
ers (hence, high CPC bids), it’d take an enormous budget to get and 
maintain a highly ranked position among the other PPC ads that those 
words bring up on the page. But how can you know just how popular 
a given keyword is? Google to the rescue. Its Keyword Tool can give 
you an estimate of both the average CPC that that keyword will require 
for your listing to show up on the first page of a SERP as well as the 
number of clicks you can expect, which is another way of indicating its 
value to advertisers and search volume, respectively. Then, armed with 
that information, you can decide whether to play. For the details, go to 
http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal.
 
 For example, if you’re bidding on NYC dentist, good luck. Your competi-
tion is going to be stiff and (probably) awash with loose cash. On the 
other hand, upper west side family dentist is almost certain to be less 
popular (because it’s far more specific) — and thus, less costly to com-
pete for. Additionally, due to the specificity of the keyword, those less 
expensive clicks are much more likely to actually turn into new patients. 
Double good!
Organizing your keywords
After you determine what keywords you want to bid on, decide how you want 
the search engines to match them to the user queries that come in. To do 
that, you have to get your keywords organized. (We go more deeply into this 
later in this chapter, but the subject deserves some attention here as well.)
To organize your keywords, you need some (figurative) baskets. Take your 
master keyword list and start breaking down the keywords into individual 
baskets, or what Google calls ad groups. After you load these baskets, write 
highly targeted ad copy that incorporates each basketful of keywords. And 
the better job you do of this, the higher your CTR, Quality Score, and conver-
sion rate — and the lower your cost-per-conversion — and new customer.

174
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Here’s how to sort your keywords:
 
1. Separate your keywords into groups based on product or service.
 
2. Break out these groups further on the basis of similarities in language/
wording. Remember to keep then as targeted as possible.
 
3. Create a group of negative keywords.
 
 These are words that although closely associated with those on your 
final keeper list are also associated with the kind of queries you don’t 
want.
 
 You don’t want these keywords because they’re highly unlikely to bring 
you any conversions, and you’ll just end up paying for pointless clicks. 
For a plumber, these might include supplies, training, class, classes, certi-
fication, or (the ever popular) water.
Preempt the possibility of coming up in the results for these undesirable 
words by registering them into the search engine’s do not use list. On Google, 
for example, you can add negative keywords within your ad groups by click-
ing on the keywords tab and scrolling down to the Negative Keywords field. 
(We cover ad groups in the “Organizing your account” section, later in this 
chapter.)
The match game
No matter how thoroughly you’ve thought 
through your keyword choices, searchers 
throw words into a query that don’t quite match 
your keywords. Search engines have seen this 
happen a couple billion times, so most paid 
search platforms include match types that 
allow you to choose how the engines should 
handle your ad in the event that one of these 
near-miss queries comes in. Generally, these 
match-types options are
 ✓ Broad: Your ad is shown for search que-
ries that Google (for instance) deems to 
be semantically related to your keywords. 
This is the default option. For example, if 
your keyword phrase is bankruptcy lawyer, 
Google would still bring up your ad in 
response to queries for bankruptcy, lawyer, 
lawyer for bankruptcy, filing for bankruptcy, 
and going bankrupt.
 ✓ Phrase: This filter requires that the search 
query contain the entire keyword phrase 
in order. For the bankruptcy lawyer exam-
ple, the ad in question would show up for 
say, bankruptcy lawyer in Phoenix or best 
bankruptcy lawyer, but not for lawyer 
for bankruptcy or Cleveland lawyer for 
going bankrupt.
 ✓ Exact: Ads are shown only for queries that 
match keywords exactly. So if your key-
word phrase is bankruptcy lawyer, only a 
query for bankruptcy lawyer will do. Even a 
variation as slight as bankruptcy lawyer in 
Portland won’t cut it.

175
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
Organizing your account
Three levels of organization are required for your paid search account on 
Google — the account, campaigns, and ad groups — and each level gives you 
different ways to control your advertising. The account is where you have 
control over user-defined administrative items like login, billing information, 
and global spending limits.
The campaign
The campaign is the largest organizational unit in your Google AdWords 
account. At the campaign level, you set your daily budget, your geographic 
and language targeting, and your Google network distribution preferences 
(we talk more about these in the “Network distribution” sidebar). If you want 
to keep all these settings the same across all your paid advertising, you need 
only one campaign. This is another way of saying that each unique combina-
tion of settings requires an additional campaign.
Setting a daily budget
When you set your daily budget in the campaign section, Google does its 
best — which is generally very good — to see that your ads display when and 
where they’ll be most effective without exceeding that budget. Two things 
are important to know here:
 
✓ A given day’s budget isn’t a hard cap. Some days you’ll exceed it by a 
little, and some days you’ll fall a little short.
 
✓ In any given billing period, Google doesn’t charge you more than the 
number of days times your daily budget.
Targeting locations
What locations should you target? As a general rule, target at least the entire 
area that your business serves. If you plan to start expanding your business’s 
reach, you can add on more (usually contiguous) areas. In any case, Google 
lets you select your targets on a country, state, metro area, city, or even zip 
code basis, so your aim can get pretty precise.
You may wonder how search engines determine which users are where? 
Simple. The Internet service providers (ISPs) maintain Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses showing the approximate physical location of every computer that 
logs on to the Internet. (We know that may sound a little creepy, but this is 
really no more sinister than the government knowing your mailing address, 
and no one seems to have a problem with that.)
Anyway, this data is just that precise. So if you target, say, a small city or 
group of cities that extends just a few miles from a central, specified point, 
your ad will nevertheless be seen by users whose actual physical locations 
are a bit outside that range. Many Web advertisers actually set up their 

176
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
targeting in the opposite way: They’ll specify an area that’s larger than their 
actual target market to ensure that they have all their targets covered — and 
any extra, non-targeted users they happen to pick up in the process are just 
considered gravy.
 
Another way to target your audience geographically is to include geographic 
modifiers in your keywords. So a local dentist who runs the keyword phrase 
dentist in Montpelier may well have his ad run nationally on Google, though it 
will appear only when someone types that exact keyword phrase from wher-
ever she happens to be at the time. A simpler way to express this, perhaps, is 
to say that the tactic allows users who are themselves located nationwide to 
see listings that are essentially local. (A local limo service, for example, might 
well be eager to reach people who will be flying into the local market and will 
need transportation from the airport when they arrive. In other words, they’re 
not here yet, but soon will be.)
The ad group
An ad group is a list of keywords associated with certain ad variations. In gen-
eral, create a group of any keywords that logically share the same ad. Each 
ad group is then assigned to a campaign.
For example, say that Saratoga National Golf Club (in Saratoga Springs, NY) 
uses PPC ads to attract wedding business to its location. Two of its ad groups 
are Saratoga Weddings and Golf-Themed Weddings. Some of the keywords in 
the first ad group might include saratoga springs weddings, wedding receptions 
saratoga, wedding venues saratoga, and wedding locations saratoga springs 
NY. The second ad group might include golf weddings saratoga, saratoga golf 
course weddings, and golf course wedding sites saratoga springs. The two ad 
groups are similar enough to rationally belong to the same owner, yet differ-
ent enough to attract business in two distinct ways.
Which keywords should share an ad? Well, an ad group needs to contain 
keywords that are very closely related in meaning and that can be assumed 
to answer queries that have similar intent, as shown in the following ad 
examples. What’s more, whenever searchers use one of your keywords and 
phrases in their query, that word or phrase appears automatically in your 
ad in bold. This makes it easier for users to scan for those ads that best rep-
resent what they’re after — and research shows, significantly increases the 
odds that a given ad will get clicked.

Landing pages
Because we discuss landing pages in detail in Chapter 5, in this chapter, we 
only make a couple points regarding the relationship of these pages to paid 
search. Ideally, each separate piece of ad copy you use needs to send search-
ers to a different landing page, and this is especially advisable if each ver-
sion of your ad copy is different enough in subject matter to demand its own 
more-thorough explanation. (If on the other hand, all the versions of your 
copy address the same subject but are worded differently, routing a visitor 
who clicks any of the ad versions to the same landing page is sufficient.)
 
Most important, however, is that any landing page — and the ad copy that 
leads to it — needs to contain as many of your keywords as you can include. 
This accomplishes two things:
 
✓ Increases your Quality Score and therefore helps lower your CPC.
 
✓ Improves your conversion rate.

178
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Why? Because the more consistent and seamless the transition from a key-
word query, to your ad copy, to the corresponding landing page, the easier it 
is to establish relevance throughout the whole chain of communication, and 
the more effective it will be in convincing a prospect to become a customer.
Writing effective ad copy
Effective ad copy doesn’t just drive up your CTR (and consequently, your 
Quality Score), it also helps separate the qualified leads you want from the 
unqualified ones you don’t. (Qualified meaning leads with the right geo-
graphic location, set of needs, financial ability to buy from you, and so on.)
Here’s the rub: The character limits placed on ad copy are tight. Google, for 
instance, allows you just 25 characters for a headline and 70 characters for 
the copy itself, with the latter prohibited from running longer than two lines. 
So guess what? You have to work hard to say the most you can in the most 
efficient way you can. This is likely to require some work; as you scribble 
copy, edit it to its essence, see if it still makes sense — then crumple it up 
and start over. (You’ll get better and better at it as you go.) If you really want 
to make the most of your paid search advertising, each of your ads needs to 
present a unique value proposition regarding your product or service, and 
do so in a unique way. Just settling for some bland, generic-sounding copy is 
going to bring subpar results.
Optimizing your Quality Score
We mention earlier in this chapter that the 
biggest factors that influence an ad’s Quality 
Score are CTRs, ad copy, and landing-page 
relevance. Optimizing these elements is impor-
tant. Here a few guidelines as to how you can 
accomplish that:
 ✓ Optimize ad group structure: Use small, 
tightly focused ad groups with just a few 
keywords in each.
 ✓ Optimize copy: Create compelling ad copy 
that contains keyword phrases and that is 
likely to be clicked.
 ✓ Optimize landing pages: Your landing 
pages need to repeat text from your ad 
copy (especially the keywords in that copy). 
Also, do everything you can to ensure that 
each landing page loads quickly, and that 
it has enough text content to give a visitor 
a solid understanding of the subject being 
addressed.

179
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
 
Your ad headlines are the most important elements to get right. Research 
based on heat maps shows that searchers’ eyes spend more time on headlines 
than on any other part of the ad. Headlines have to grab attention and contain 
information that helps to pre-qualify your prospects.
Also critical is your call to action. What exactly do you want the readers of 
your ad to do? Buy? Call? Drive to your place of business? Whatever your call 
to action is, you have to ask searchers to do it — and give them some kind of 
incentive to follow through. This is usually a coupon or a promotional offer 
(such as Call Now and Save 10% or Buy One, Get One Free), but other unique 
selling propositions, such as The Area’s Only Authorized Dealer of Smedley 
Lawn Tractors, may also work well.
Keep all your ad copy as keyword-rich as possible, and concentrate on the 
tightly focused language groups (your baskets) that you came up with 
beforehand.
You can also determine what display URL to use in your ad. Folks often forget 
that they can add, after the slash in their URLs, keywords that link to a spe-
cific landing page(s). Because a URL is shown in bold type in an ad, so will 
the words you add to it. For instance, rather than just using a display URL of 
www.deaverdental.com, try www.deaverdental.com/teethwhitening. 
As the saying goes, every little bit helps.
Network distribution
We note earlier in this chapter that one of the 
settings you can choose at the campaign level 
is whether you want your paid ads to be distrib-
uted to the Google Search Network and Content 
Network. By using the Search Network, your 
ad will appear in response to appropriate que-
ries made on AOL, EarthLink, CompuServe, 
Shopping.com, ATT.net, and Ask.com, among 
other places. The Content Network by con-
trast places your ads on relevant non-search 
sites like About.com, The New York Times, and 
HowStuffWorks.
Going onto the networks does involve some 
incremental cost, but only in the sense that you’re 
paying for clicks, and the networks will — or at 
least should — generate more clicks. (The good 
news here is that network bids are set at the 
ad group level.) And because, extensive as it 
is, the traffic quality generated by the networks 
(particularly the Content Network) usually isn’t 
as high as that of the traffic that comes directly 
from plain, old Google, the cost included is 
nominal. That’s why a lot of small businesses 
balance the extra cost against the wider expo-
sure and figure, reasonably enough, “Okay, 
sure, why not?” And if your budget allows, you 
probably should, too.
You also have a safety net because when 
you’re on the networks, you can always test to 
find out how much additional traffic they actu-
ally bring you. If the amount and quality of that 
traffic doesn’t seem to be worth the incremen-
tal cost to you, you can always bail out.

180
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Check out your competitors’ ads for ideas. Look at their ads and see how you 
can differentiate from them. You may find that some of the language they use 
is indispensable — for instance, lawn tractors — but some is language you 
can use that they don’t or can’t, such as exclusive Smedley dealer.
Another tip is to write in camel case — capitalizing the first letter of every 
word you use. This makes your copy stand out more and commands more 
attention.
Naturally enough, each search ad provider has its editorial guidelines that 
you’re required to follow, or risk having your ad rejected. Check each 
provider’s Web site for their ad guidelines. A few of the most common 
guidelines are
 
✓ Only one exclamation point is allowed in ad copy and none in the 
headline.
 
✓ You can’t include Click Here.
 
✓ You can’t use superlatives (best, most, highest, and so on) unless that 
claim is supported by a third-party reference on the landing page.
 
✓ You can’t use any foul or offensive language, or any drug-related 
content.
 
✓ You can’t use excessive capitalization, but camel case is both permitted 
and common.
 
✓ Only certain information can be included in the ad (for example, Google 
allows ad copy to include a phone number, whereas Bing does not).
Write a variety of ads per ad group. The search engines give you the option 
to have them automatically favor (in terms of number of appearances) the 
ads that generate higher CTRs. The following examples show a poorly written 
ad and a well-written one.
Poorly written ad

Why that ad fails:
 
✓ Too many exclamation points, and in the wrong place (the headline)
 
✓ Too many capital letters
 
✓ Very generic in content

Make sure that the URL you include in your ad leads to a landing page that 
has a direct logical connection to at least the first two-thirds of your ad copy. 
Also, although a good idea is to use different variables in your copy and then 
test to see which versions are earning you the most clicks, give each variation 
a statistically significant length of time to run before you make a judgments as 
to its effectiveness. (For most businesses, for example, a 48-hour run isn’t long 
enough.)
Managing your bids
When time start bidding on a given keyword, concentrate on two things:
 
✓ Setting your initial bid
 
✓ Optimizing your bids
Setting your initial bid
Although you may ultimately use testing, measuring, and various optimizing 
techniques to determine your initial bids for a keyword, we assume here that 
this is your very first venture into keyword bidding, and so we concentrate 
on the universal basics.
A few different philosophies float around in the Web as to how you should 
set your initial bid. Three of the most prominent are
 
✓ Just do what Google tells you to do: Google can estimate what your bid 
would have to be to earn first page placement. That criterion makes sense 
because most search users never make it past the first page of search 
results. On the one hand, this is a reasonably sound basis from which to 
get a good ballpark figure for your initial bid. On yet another hand, going 
this route, in effect, puts the auctioneer (Google) in the position of offer-
ing bidding advice — and this auctioneer makes more money from higher 
bids. So is this approach helpful? Yes. Impartial? Uh, not so much.

182
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Be very conservative: This approach can be summed up as bid low 
and see what happens. If, as a result of this method, your ad gets poor 
position and hardly ever gets clicked, you can start raising your bids 
until you hit that magic point where you’re happy both with the number 
of clicks you’re getting and with the amount of money those clicks are 
costing you. Here are two possible downsides:
 
• This approach is hard to budget because it may or may not actu-
ally cost you more than you planned on.
 
• If you get a crummy position and a paltry number of clicks, you’ve 
wasted money.
 
✓ Be aggressive: Some paid search experts insist that bidding high very 
early in the process has a substantial benefit. Their thinking runs like 
this: A high bid brings a high position, a high position leads to a good 
CTR, a good CTR earns a higher Quality Score, and a good Quality Score 
lets you lower your subsequent bids and still get excellent placement. 
To which we say, maybe, maybe not. Google, for one, throws cold water 
on this idea, claiming that when it assigns a Quality Score, it normalizes 
for position. Yet many people nevertheless swear by this approach. Our 
best advice is that if you adopt this strategy, establish and closely moni-
tor your daily spending caps; otherwise, you can burn through a lot of 
money in no time at all.
Optimizing your bids
Like optimizing your Web site and your paid and unpaid search engine 
listings, optimizing your bid strategy is largely a matter of trial and error. 
You test approach A against approach B, and then test the winner against 
approach C. A couple of general truths to keep in mind when you consider 
changing your bids are
 
✓ Increasing your bid on a keyword will usually also increase your CPL.
 
✓ Conversely, lowering your bid will generally lower your CPL, but it will 
also (probably) lower your SERP position, hence your visibility, hence 
the number of clicks you get and leads you gather.
 
Bid optimization on a keyword basis is nearly always a tradeoff between traffic 
volume on the one hand and profitability on the other. To optimize then is to 
find the balance between the two that best suits you and your business.
Before you can effectively optimize your bid strategy, understand clearly and 
fully the various steps that make up a paid search campaign. These are core 
principles:
 
1. Consumers search for products or services in your category and are pre-
sented with your ad (each of these ad presentations is an impression).
 
2. When a consumer sees your ad, she decides whether to click it.

183
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
 
 The more people who click, the higher your CTR.
 
3. Clicking brings the consumer to your landing page, where she decides 
whether she wants to take any further action.
 
 Examples of this action could be filling out an online form or contacting 
your business by phone or e-mail. Consumers who take such an action 
become leads, and the percentage of your total visitors who become 
leads is your conversion rate.
 
4. You and/or your employees turn as many of these leads as possible into 
actual paying customers.
 
 The success level you have in doing this is your sales rate or close rate.
After you have a grasp of these steps, it becomes much easier to figure out 
what the root causes of a specific performance problem are. For instance:
 
✓ Problem: Not enough impressions
 
• Root causes: Not enough search volume in the area you’re target-
ing, keyword portfolio isn’t broad enough, or bids are too low, 
resulting in poor position on SERP
 
✓ Problem: Impressions are sufficient, but not enough clicks
 
• Root cause: Ineffective ad copy
 
✓ Problem: Impressions and click rates are good, but not enough leads
 
• Root cause: Landing page conversion is weak
 
✓ Problem: Leads are sufficient, but not enough sales
 
• Root causes: The leads are weak or just not sufficiently interested 
in your products, services, or offers; or poor lead handling
 
✓ Problem: Volume of leads is good, but they are too expensive to generate
 
• Root causes: Bids are too high, CPC is too high, or Quality Score is 
too low; or landing page conversion is inefficient
Tracking and refining results
The simple — and perhaps, obvious — fact is that you can’t test what you 
don’t track. Fortunately, you can track just about everything. The challenge 
is to identify the things you want to track when you’re running a paid search 
campaign. This tells you which elements of your campaign are working well 
and which aren’t. That, in turn, tells you which approaches are worth your 
investment and which are simply a waste of money.

184
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
The elements of a paid search campaign you’re most likely to need to 
track are
 
✓ Conversions: This is the single most important metric because it’s the 
last step before an actual sale. Conversions can be tracked in several 
ways, including:
 
• Actions taken: When a user takes a desirable action on your Web 
site (for instance, downloading a newsletter or submitting a con-
tact form), you can generally track that event back to the specific 
keyword and ad text that brought that user to your site. Keeping 
records of these two source elements over time tells you which 
ads and keywords do you the most good and therefore deserve 
more of your resources in the bidding stage.
 
• Conversion values: If you have multiple conversion pages and/or 
use multiple conversion events (usually offers of some sort) on 
your Web site, you can track each page’s or event’s performance 
versus its cost to you.
 
✓ Web site behavior: These metrics tell you about the behavior of your 
site’s visitors after they get there, such as
 
• Pages per visit
 
• Bounce rate; this is people who leave the site after viewing only 
one page
 
• Time spent on the site
 
 If you can’t directly tie behavior on your site to actual conversions 
because those conversions tend to happen off-site, you can still use the 
traffic metrics listed previously to get a good idea of which keywords are 
generating the best behavior happening on your site. As always, keep 
the productive keywords and lose (or alter) the unproductive ones.
 
✓ Queries: The keywords people use to arrive at your paid ad and then, 
hopefully, to come to your Web site. Among the important query 
metrics are
 
• Session logging: Web analytics can tell you which keywords were 
queried and then induced people who used those words to visit 
your site. Knowing this helps you refine your keywords as well 
drop those that result in unproductive queries. (For example: You 
run a catering business, and one of your keywords is catering jobs. 
The metrics subsequently tell you that many of the queries using 
catering jobs fall off your site quickly, and you deduce that those 
folks are looking for employment, not catering services, and drop 
that keyword.)
 
• Google’s Search Query Performance report: If you’re using AdWords, 
this report shows you (among other metrics) every query that gen-
erated a click. Here again, you can use this information to weed out 
unproductive, though clicked, keywords to improve your CTRs.

185
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
 
When you use tracking to test one paid ad against another, don’t mix apples 
and oranges — you aren’t going to learn much unless the competing ads are 
similar enough that you can determine the exact factors that create good or 
poor results. For example, you might want to test a percentage savings offer 
against an actual dollar-amount savings offer to see which one results in more 
clicks. On the other hand, testing great prices versus prompt service tells you 
pretty much nothing. (However, if you’re testing keyword against keyword, 
testing prices against service might make sense.)
 
One of the biggest challenges for local businesses that want to use online 
tracking is that many people looking for local businesses aren’t going to fill out 
an online form. Instead, they’re going to travel to the company’s place of busi-
ness or call them on the phone. So the problem becomes how to tie an offline 
action to an online behavior. The situation gets even stickier with paid search 
in which you really want to trace conversions back to the actual keyword 
that was searched and that then brought each lead to your door. Sadly, no 
easy way exists to do this, but the situation isn’t entirely hopeless. Some local 
online advertising companies (such as www.yodle.com) use advanced algo-
rithms that essentially timestamp clicks and phone calls, giving local business 
owners a way to identify a presumptive correlation between ad clicks and 
offline response. Small businesses can adopt a somewhat more cumbersome 
version of this technique on their own if they use a virtual phone service (as 
we discuss in Chapter 5). Metrics tell these businesses when individual clicks 
occurred, whereas the phone service tells them when calls were made. This 
approach is far from perfect, but it’s better than nothing.
Finding and Using Resources 
for DIY and Outsourcing
As with Web site creation (see Chapter 4), a small business owner who 
wants to get into PPC campaign management has a fundamental choice: To 
do it yourself or to hire outside help. And as with site-building, the decision 
regarding PPC campaign management largely comes down to how much time 
and expertise the business owner has.
Getting a paid search campaign up and running the right way can require a 
significant chunk of your time. Although much of this effort generally comes 
at the front-end of the process, keeping track of your bids and your metrics 
on a frequent and regular basis can chew up valuable hours as well. (Google 
AdWords For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Howie Jacobson can be a valuable 
resource for determining just how much time and effort a well-run campaign 
is likely to require.)

186
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Tempted as you might be to set up your campaign and then leave it on auto-
pilot, you really can’t afford to. Unless you keep a daily (or even several times 
a day) eye on your bids, your PPC budget can quickly spin out of control.
Meanwhile, the expertise question is pretty much self-explanatory. Either you 
have significant experience in online marketing or you don’t. Resources like 
the aforementioned book (not to mention this one!) can help you acquire a 
lot of the necessary knowledge, but reading about doing something and actu-
ally doing it are often quite different things.
So the DIY versus getting outside help question remains. To help you decide, 
the following sections describe the kinds of professional service providers 
you need to check out before arriving at your final answer.
Don’t feel even the slightest embarrassment about getting outside help with 
your paid search engine advertising. Just consider how long this chapter is 
and keep in mind that it’s only an overview of the subject. The details of paid 
search could fill several books.
 
Chapter 20 of this book lists several questions you need to ask a potential 
vendor before hiring him.
A number of great service providers are out there who can take a lot of the 
paid search burden off your shoulders. Because a thorough examination of 
each of their individual rosters of services would likely make you nod off, we 
simply categorize the different types of help you can get:
 
✓ Independent consultants (including small agencies)
 
✓ Internet Yellow Pages (IYP) companies
 
✓ Full-service local online advertising companies
 
✓ Technology platforms
The following sections take a brief look at each.
Independent consultants or agencies
To get a feel for just how many consultants and small agencies offer search 
engine marketing (SEM) services, just Google (or Yahoo or Bing) SEM agency 
for small businesses or SEM consultant. Don’t be surprised to find a veritable 
sea of them. (If nothing else, the sheer volume of vendors at loose in the 
world gives you a good idea of just how important a tool SEM is in today’s 
grand scheme of things.)
 
Although many — even most — of these agencies and consultants are highly 
reputable, we’re sure a few less-than-straight-up players appear, too. Always 
ask for references and then follow up on them.

187
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
The upside of retaining one of these companies to help with SEM is that they’ll 
help you with SEM. One of the possible pitfalls, however, is that having some-
one else run your SEM program is just about as labor-intensive as it would be 
for you to do so. That means that many vendors aren’t convinced easily to 
work for anyone without a hefty budget. Don’t lose heart: There may well be 
some kind of arrangement possible that won’t break your personal bank.
Yellow Pages companies
A few years ago, many Yellow Pages companies simply offered SEM services 
as a kind of secondary revenue source to supplement their primary, paper-
based Yellow Pages business. Back then, their paid search offerings usually 
consisted of so-called click bundles in which they’d charge a preset price for a 
preset number of clicks. While some of these were a great value, the potential 
problems arose in that some clicks are much better than others for a local 
business — and at times, (so the critics said) some of the Yellow Pages pack-
ages might supply the volume of clicks promised without too much regard to 
the quality of those clicks.
Over time, reality struck. More and more people started using search engines 
to find goods and services. As a steadily increasing number of local busi-
nesses started clamoring for quality SEM solutions to get themselves in front 
of the growing legion of online searchers, many Yellow Pages companies 
altered their approach.
The result is that several Yellow Pages companies have either developed 
their own robust and sophisticated SEM operations or formed alliances with 
local online advertising firms that can provide their Yellow Pages client base 
with extensive search marketing services.
That leaves you with this bottom line: If your local business is still commit-
ted to advertising in the print Yellow Pages because it’s still a good source of 
quality leads for you, it can make good financial and hassle-avoiding sense 
to buy all your advertising services and placements from one company. That 
way you can just carry on with your paper Yellow Pages’ campaign and sup-
plement it with the Yellow Pages’ SEM solution. Doing so makes for a certain 
efficiency, and that may well translate into overall savings.
However, be careful with this approach. Because although a Yellow Pages 
company may put a fancier, tech-sounding name on what they offer, that 
doesn’t necessarily mean they’re offering a great package. So you have to 
sniff around. Ask questions. You may find a great deal, or you may find not 
much in the way of real help. Before you do any of that though, check out all 
the options that are available in your area.

Full-service local online 
advertising companies
Full-service companies specialize in helping local businesses get found 
online. In many cases, they offer relatively sophisticated solutions that 
involve at least some level of automation to optimize their efforts (and serve 
their accounts) efficiently. One of the primary benefits of working with these 
companies is that they often have their own built-in distribution networks 
that extend a local business’s reach and exposure well beyond that of the 
three major search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Bing).
Most local online advertising firms give local businesses the ability to track 
their local search performance (that is, the number of clicks and calls they 
get, as well as the dollars spent), and many also provide a virtual phone ser-
vice that permits call recording and tracking. The tracking feature is particu-
larly nice in that it lets you know not only how many calls are coming in, but 
also what the quality of those calls is (meaning, are these calls turning into 
actual business?). Many local online advertising companies also offer ample 
SEO services.
Because the local online advertising company field is a relatively young 
industry, the competitive landscape changes constantly. Nonetheless, as this 
book is written, the major players in the arena include (in alphabetical order)
 
✓ Local Marketers: www.localmarketers.com
 
✓ OrangeSoda: www.orangesoda.com
 
✓ ReachLocal: www.reachlocal.com
 
✓ WebVisible: www.webvisible.com
 
✓ Yodle: www.yodle.com
 
 Disclosure time: One of this book’s authors is a Yodle guy, but Yodle is a 
biggie in the field, so fair’s fair, right?
Using a local online advertising company can be an excellent decision for a 
local business owner who simply doesn’t have the time (or can’t afford to put 
in the time) necessary to run a paid search campaign properly. As a bonus, 
the fact that most online advertising companies use automation to assist in 
the setup and optimization of online campaigns means they can often have 
you up and running in a as little as a few days. As to cost, because these com-
panies have very efficient operations and are designed specifically to help 
local businesses, they’re eminently aware that modest budgets don’t have to 
be an obstacle to the success of paid local search campaigns.

189
 Chapter 9: The Nuts and Bolts of Search Engine Advertising
Technology platforms
A few, recently emerged companies offer technology platforms (essentially 
software that integrates with your paid search accounts) to help local busi-
ness owners more easily run, measure, and optimize their campaigns. The 
biggest benefit that comes from using one of these platforms is that you save 
the cost of having someone else manage your paid search campaign for you 
while still getting help in the form of automated advice and bid management 
as well as powerful tracking and reporting capabilities. The obvious flipside 
is that you still run your own campaign.
If you have a burning desire to run your own campaign, check out a few of 
these platform companies. Some of them offer free trials, so you can decide 
whether you like the platform before you start paying for it.
Clickable (www.clickable.com) is probably the best-known technology 
platform company. To find other platforms, just let Google be your guide.

Saying It with E-Mail
In This Chapter
▶ Gathering e-mail addresses for your mailing list
▶ Creating e-mails that get and hold attention
▶ Getting professional help with your e-mail campaign
▶ Measuring the effectiveness of your e-mail campaign
▶ Avoiding legal pitfalls
You will — or you have already — put a considerable effort into building 
your company’s Web site. And, via modern wonders, such as search 
engines, people will manage to find you.
But not all the people you want to reach will come to your site from a search 
engine, which is where e-mail comes in — big time.
You may, in fact, find that your site gets more conversions (which occur when 
your visitor takes concrete action, such as scheduling an appointment online 
or calling a number listed on your Web page) from the links in your e-mail 
messages than through search engines. After all, e-mail is more personal than 
search ads, while offering more onscreen “real estate” to sell your company’s 
goods and services. We also discuss how you can use metrics — which is a 
dressy way of saying measurements — to find out which source your Web site 
visits come from.
In any case, your e-mails can create significant Web site traffic — if they’re 
planned and executed well. And we show you just how to do those things 
very well in this chapter.
Building the All-Important Address List
Obviously, you can’t send e-mails until you have a list of addresses to send 
them to. (And we can almost hear you say, “Well, duh.”)

192
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
The first step in your e-mail marketing program is to build a permission-
based e-mail address list of your prospects and customers. Permission-based 
means that your addressees have given you explicit permission to e-mail 
them; they can do this by physically filling out a card or form at your place of 
business, or by entering their e-mail addresses on your Web site. Either way, 
you have a record of them giving you permission to send messages.
After you build a list that’s big enough to justify sending e-mail blasts (or 
mass mailings), you can expect that list to grow by an additional 5–10 percent 
each year as new customers find you via word of mouth, search engines, or 
even the phone book.
Now, 5–10 percent a year may not sound all that impressive, but when you 
consider that it reflects relationships you actually established, it’s invaluable. 
The people on your e-mail list are highly qualified potential buyers and con-
sequently, are more likely to respond to the messages you send.
 
In this chapter, we often discuss the importance of getting permission from 
your e-mail addressees before you send them anything. We can’t stress this 
point enough because failure to get the required permission can actually 
result in all sorts of unpleasant, government-imposed penalties and punish-
ments. You can find much more on this subject in the section, “CAN-SPAM 
Compliance and the Opt-In,” but we advise you to keep it in mind while you 
read this chapter and create your address list.
Finding the value of your e-mail list
Many small businesses find that their permission-based e-mail address data-
base generates cost-savings and increases their return on investment (ROI) 
that far exceeds their initial expectations. Why? These businesses use their 
e-mail list to
 
✓ Open an additional and reliable channel for reaching their customers
 
✓ Increase their sales with little effort and at minimal cost
 
✓ Significantly reduce their customer acquisition costs (the cost of creating 
a customer who actually buys from your business)
 
✓ Allow them to easily measure the impact of their marketing campaigns 
and, incidentally, to sniff out — and capitalize on — trends and prefer-
ences among their customers more quickly than ever before
 
✓ Boost their customer participation and retention rates (the rates at 
which customers return to do more business with you)
 
✓ Attract and retain customers at far lesser cost-per-person than they 
could by using direct mail (plus, no paper cuts)

193
 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
Creating the address list
You have three options (well, two-and-a-half) when it comes to compiling 
your database of e-mail addresses: create your own list, buy a list, or both.
Creating a do-it-yourself list
As a small business, it may actually be easier (and far cheaper) for you to 
obtain your customers’ e-mail addresses than it is for a Fortune 500 com-
pany. The people you do business with probably comprise a manageably 
sized universe — that is, dozens or hundreds, not millions.
These people are also doing business with you because they want to. In other 
words, they’ve shown that they trust you, which makes it likely that they’ll give 
you their e-mail information. But you have to do one critical thing first: Ask.
You can give those folks an incentive to say yes in several ways. If you’re 
starting a list from scratch, tell your customers that you’re introducing a 
new, exclusive e-mail program that will periodically provide them with one or 
more of the following:
 
✓ Special limited-time discounts available only to them.
 
✓ Useful information: For example, if you own a doggie spa, you could 
offer the convenience of regular doggie care reminders, such as letting 
them know when Tinkerbell needs her teeth cleaned.
 
✓ A new product or service.
Why bother with an e-mail campaign?
If some skeptic asks you why you’re involved in 
“this whole e-mail thing,” you might find these 
facts to be a very eloquent answer:
 ✓ The number of e-mail users is projected 
to rise to 1.6 billion by 2011. (The Radicati 
Group, October 2007)
 ✓ As a direct result of receiving e-mail, 67 
percent of respondents researched a spe-
cific offer. (Epsilon, 2009)
 ✓ Sixty-three percent of those respondents 
clicked a link in the e-mail to learn more. 
(Epsilon, October 2008)
 ✓ Forty-four percent of e-mail users said 
e-mail inspired at least one online purchase; 
and 41 percent said it prompted at least one 
offline purchase. (JupiterResearch, “The 
Social and Portable Inbox,” 2008)
 ✓ Sixty-six percent of those surveyed had 
made a purchase because of a marketing 
message received via e-mail. (ExactTarget, 
“2008 Channel Preference Survey,” 2008)
 ✓ E-mail’s ROI in 2008 was $43.52 for every $1 
spent on it. (DMA, 2008)

194
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ The opening of a new location, or the expansion of your current 
business.
 
✓ Customer testimonials.
 
✓ An invitation to take part in a survey.
 
The important thing to keep in mind is that you know your customers. And 
that means you probably also know precisely what sort of inducement they’ll 
be most interested in — and that’s the one you need to offer.
In any case, if you’ve properly read your customers’ needs and wants and 
offered something they’re really interested in as a reward for signing up for 
your list, hand them a simple sign-up card (like the one shown in Figure 10-1) 
to fill in with their e-mail addresses if they’re physically present at your loca-
tion or give them a way to subscribe on your Web site.
 
Figure 10-1: 
A typical 
sign-up card 
for custom-
ers who visit 
your place 
of business.
 
You can also get a lot of names and addresses from your Web site. Just 
include a check box on your site for a visitor to give you the necessary per-
mission to contact him and then give him a space to enter his e-mail address 
if he wants to receive future valuable and informative mailings. You can also 
ask for his name to personalize the e-mails that will follow.
But how do you drive potential customers to the sign-up page on your site? 
You really have only two options:
 
✓ You can put the sign-up section right on the home page. A home page, 
as shown in Figure 10-2, is the page visitors first come to when they type 
your Web address.
 
✓ You can put something on the home page that acts as an inducement 
to go to a separate sign-up page. This can be modest offer for, say, a 
coupon or for more information on a subject that you mention on the 
home page.

195
 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
Including a place on your Web site for people to fill in their e-mail addresses — 
and thus knowingly give you permission to send them messages — is a pretty 
simple step. Just include whatever sort of offer you want to, uh, offer, either 
by putting it into a different typeface or in a special box, with a clickable 
Subscribe link below it that takes customers to a sign-up page. Some people 
insist on putting this right on the home page, but that runs the considerable 
risk of looking a little too aggressive (or greedy, pushy, and desperate). If you 
use a professional Web designer, just tell her that you want your site to con-
tain an address-gathering page and let the designer take it from there.
 
Figure 10-2: 
A typical 
e-mail opt-in 
section.
 
An e-mail opt-in
So, because you can give customers a sign-up card in person or let them sub-
scribe via your Web site, it’s really pretty easy to generate your own quality 
list of e-mail addresses. And, with any luck at all, it’s a list that will just keep 
getting longer.
 
After you compile your list, protect it. Do not sell or distribute the names for 
others to use (or, just as likely, misuse) unless you’ve already given your cus-
tomers fair notice on your Web site or on some other sign-up document that 
you intend to pass their information along. Selling e-mail addresses without 
permission isn’t just tacky, it’s illegal.

196
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Going with the pros
You can rent e-mail lists from companies, and those lists can be honed to 
target the customers of specific business types, to reflect a particular demo-
graphic profile (such as age or gender), or even to reach a specific zip code.
Many of these companies can also handle the mailing details — for a fee, of 
course. Two such list-rental companies are CityTwist (http://citytwist.
com) and infoUSA (http://infousa.com), though you can find many others.
This option can be a very good way to go, or it can turn into a screech-
ing nightmare. A reputable list-renter is extremely careful to ensure that 
every person whose address it provides has given his permission to receive 
e-mails. This keeps you on the right side of the law and can save you an enor-
mous amount of time. On the other hand, using a slapped-together list, where 
few, if any, of the addressees have given permission for e-mails is just asking 
for a threatening letter from the Feds. And you can’t duck it by blaming the 
list-renter because the offending e-mails go out with your name on them.
The best ways to make sure your experience with a list-renter is a good, 
clean, and legal one are to
 
✓ Insist on getting a guarantee in writing from the list company that all 
the names they provide have agreed to receive mailings from third 
parties, such as you.
 
✓ Ask the offering company how and where it acquired the names and 
addresses you want to rent. If its answer sounds fishy, it’s best to walk 
away.
 
✓ Never use bulk lists (often offered on CD-ROM). These typically contain 
names of people who haven’t agreed to receive unsolicited e-mails, who 
have long since changed their e-mail addresses, or who are, alas, dead; 
in the case of people who haven’t consented to unsolicited mailings, 
they can complain to your Internet service provider (ISP), who can then 
promptly shut down your account (ouch!).
 
✓ Manage your expectations. Based on the personal experience of many 
list-renters, your response rate from a third-party list is likely to be 
pretty low (2 percent or less on average). Considering the relatively non-
targeted nature of such lists, that should come as no great surprise.
Don’t let the pitfalls we note here deter you, however, from the idea of rent-
ing an e-mail list. Like any business, this one has its share of bad apples — 
but also big bushels full of good ones. And those can save you a lot of time in 
getting together an address list.
The expense? Figure the cost of renting a list ranges from $50–$150 for every 
thousand names you get.

197
 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
Combining the two
You could use a reputable list-rental company to get you started and then 
gradually phase out that relationship as your own, home-grown list gets 
longer.
 
First and foremost, determine whether your rental list is driving better quali-
fied customers to your business and whether the cost of that list is producing 
a strong return on your investment (ROI). If so, why shut it off? After all, some 
attrition occurs with any list, so continually replenishing it with new names 
just makes good business sense.
On the other hand, if the opt-in device on your Web site does a great job of 
growing a qualified list and driving a strong ROI, you may decide it’s simply 
no longer worth it to pay for a rented list.
Ultimately, using metrics to figure out what’s working — and what isn’t — 
is the easiest way to decide where and how to invest your money wisely.
Creating an Effective E-Mail Blast
After you compile (or rent) a good-sized collection of permitted addresses 
(sorry to keep harping, but it really is that important), what’s the next step? 
Easy: You have to actually send them e-mail.
 
For a small business, the window for sending your first mailing is no more 
than six months. After that, your list of addresses can turn pretty stale. People 
change e-mail addresses, forget who you are, or forget they ever consented to 
getting e-mails from you in the first place — none of which is good.
In reality, you’re best off sending your first e-mail message as soon as possi-
ble, thereby striking while the proverbial iron is plenty hot. Even after about 
three months that iron definitely has cooled.
We get pretty specific about content in some of the sections that follow, but a 
few quick and tidy guidelines for composing your e-mail blast message are
 
✓ Make it fresh.
 
✓ Make it brief.
 
✓ Make it interesting.
 
✓ Make it actionable.
In other words, give your e-mail recipients a powerful reason to open your 
e-mail — and then give them something interesting to do after it’s opened — 
rather than to automatically hit the dreaded Delete button.

A lot of things can work. For instance, offering tips can be a very effective door 
(and e-mail) opener. If you’re say, a landscaper, you could send an e-mail that 
presents Five Easy Ways to a Healthier Lawn, or maybe Three Kinds of Weeds 
That Will Happily Eat Your House, or some other piece of advice that your 
average e-mail recipient would be nuts not to open, read, and heed.
And although giving your mailings something that compels prospects to open 
them is important, it’s even more critical now, with so much junk mail and 
spam clogging so many inboxes.
We break down the structure of an e-mail into two pieces: what your recipi-
ents see when your message shows up in their e-mail inboxes and what they 
find when they actually open the message.
Considering what customers 
see in their inboxes
The parts of an e-mail that a recipient sees in her inbox are collectively 
known as the header, as shown in Figure 10-3. These parts include the From 
and Subject lines as well as the date the e-mail is received. The date hardly 
requires any explanation, but the other parts definitely do.
Creating an effective “from” line
Your first hurdle comes right off the bat: Identifying yourself in a way that 
swiftly moves your recipients from seeing your message to actually opening it.
Obviously, you want the From line to clearly identify you and/or your com-
pany as the e-mail sender. You don’t have a whole lot of ways to jazz up, say, 
Ferguson Kitchens or Muffins by Meghan, so don’t waste your time trying.
 
Because you have a local business that’s accustomed to dealing with people 
on a by-name basis, a really nice, personal touch is to add your name to your 
company’s; for example, Eddie@PremierCleaners.com. See? Already 
you’re on your way to starting a conversation rather than just giving a blunt 
company ID.
 
Unless you’ve rented a list of e-mail addresses from a third party, you’re not 
coming into folks’ inboxes as a total stranger. They know who you are. They 
willingly signed up to be on your list and they’re expecting to hear from you. 
So just make sure they know that it is you when you come calling.
 
Never try to hide your real company name behind some seemed-really-clever-
at-the-time pseudonym. So if you’re Carlton Mufflers, for instance, don’t make 
your e-mail appear to come from Mr. BoomVroom (unless you’re also pre-
pared to be thought of as Mr. HalfWit). It’s just embarrassing . . . and it’ll make 
your recipients think you’re untrustworthy.

Writing great subject lines
Here the plot really starts to thicken. What can you say to make your recipi-
ent say, “Ooh, I’ve just gotta see what this is about” — and click to open your 
e-mail?
Here again, don’t get cagey or cute. You literally have just one second to 
set the hook, so if you’re offering a special sale or discount, just say it. For 
example, This Week: 2 Shirts for the Price of 1 is miles better than Have I Got 
a Deal For You!
Whatever you say, make it about him, your prospect or customer, not you. 
People, whether they admit it, want to know what’s in it for them. And when 
you consider how much spam and other junk getting delivered to people 
every single day, it’s obvious that you have to say something that communi-
cates, “Hey, this one really is worth opening.”

What makes one subject line work well whereas another one is completely 
ignored? Here are some pointers that many successful e-mail marketers treat 
as musts:
 
✓ Keep Subject lines short and simple. Fewer than ten words is good, and 
fewer than five is better still.
 
✓ Focus on the benefits that are important to your reader rather than on 
the features that are important to you.
 
✓ Avoid using you in the Subject line, even though it is about the recipi-
ent. You is used to death by spammers. Better to use the “imperative 
case,” as in “Get A Free Donut Now” or “Win This Big Fluffy Thing.” (One 
slightly odd note: Although using “you” is generally avoided by the pros, 
“your” shows up fairly often in their work. What a difference a letter 
makes, huh? Go figure.)
 
✓ Avoid using two other spam flags: Exclamation points and words 
ALL IN CAPS.
A few more pieces of advice that many e-mail pros swear by are
 
✓ Don’t use blank subject lines or Re:.
 
✓ Capitalize the first letter of each word, even prepositions (such as all, 
for, through), conjunctions (but, or, and), and articles (a, an, the). For 
example: “Take A Flight To And From The South Of France.”
Table 10-1 lists some hypothetical Subject lines that will and won’t work to 
get people to read the message.

Composing your message
After you persuade your reader to open your e-mail with descriptive From 
and Subject lines, you need to write the content of the message. The follow-
ing sections break down the parts of the content section (that is, the message 

201
 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
in the body of the e-mail) and provide tips for writing effective marketing 
messages.
Writing the key elements in the content section
The content of a marketing message can be broken down into the following 
key elements (see Figure 10-4):
 
✓ The masthead: This is the information that appears at the very top of 
your e-mail so that your customer sees it first. The general rule of thumb 
for mastheads is that your logo goes in the upper-left corner, and your 
phone number and Web address go in the upper right.
 
✓ The body: This is the element that follows the masthead and con-
tains the substantive part of your message. The body requires a bal-
ance between the amount of text you use and the number and size of 
any images you include; as for the text (or copy) itself, be aware that 
most e-mail readers simply scan your message rather than read every 
word, so make your copy easy to process by using short sentences 
and devices, such as headlines, sub-headlines, bullet points, and, by all 
means, a background color light enough to make dark copy read easily.
 
✓ The footer: This is the space at the bottom of the e-mail page where you 
should display your phone number, your physical mailing address, and 
your Web address even if you’ve already included them in the masthead 
of your e-mail’s masthead; the repetition never hurts and often helps 
boost your response rate. Figure 10-4 shows several common elements 
of a proper footer.

Call to action

202
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ The call to action: Even though this element shows up last on our list, 
it’s actually number one in importance because this is where you tell 
your readers exactly what you want them to do. Sign up for a catalog? 
Buy something? Take advantage of a special deal? Whatever it is and 
whether it shows up at the top (which is preferable), in the middle, or at 
the bottom of your e-mail, it has to be there — made visually impossible 
to miss or to be misunderstood.
 
In most cases, an effective e-mail presents the call to action and then directs 
readers to a Web site link that takes them directly to a landing page you’ve 
created. (A landing page is where people arrive when they click an online ad or 
search listing. The landing page is designed to be highly relevant to the e-mail, 
ad, or search listing that prompted the reader to visit your site.) Importantly, 
responding to your call to action brings these visitors straight to the specific 
information about your offer without making them through menus and links 
on your home page.
To learn more about creating highly effective landing pages, please see 
Landing Page Optimization For Dummies by Mike and Martin Harwood.
The landing page could let customers print an e-coupon or head to your 
online merchandise shop, or it could provide them with a form to give you 
their postal mailing addresses so you can send them your quarterly catalog. 
In any case, you’ll likely actually close the sale on the landing page.
“Okay, fine,” you say, “But I really don’t want to spend time creating a sepa-
rate page just for people to land on. They can get to the info well enough 
through my home page.” Sure. But they can also get impatient, confused, and 
frustrated — and then just give up and go somewhere else (like your com-
petitor’s Web site). Why take that chance?
Writing effective marketing e-mail messages
Think of the following three rules as carved in granite or some other Igneous 
rock for writing effective marketing messages:
 
✓ Make the content valuable to the reader: If you accomplish nothing 
else in your e-mail, make crystal clear what’s in it for them.
 
✓ Be direct: No need to beat around the bush; just say, “Here’s a bush.”
 
✓ Be concise: Write plainly and keep your messages to the point. Try not 
to say “utilize conversational devices in a communicative way” when 
you can just say “talk.”
 
Your recipient has precious little time (a few minutes at most) to spend on 
your message. Say it simply, say it informatively, and then stop writing.

203
 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
And, as with your Subject line, don’t go over the top. Superlatives (such as 
Our Biggest Sale Ever) and exclamation points don’t scream “buy me,” they 
just scream. Avoid them and settle for being your nice, calm, professional, 
credible self.
A lot of e-mail experts all seem to agree on some critical basics for the 
content section:
 
✓ Use strong, direct action and value words: For example, Save, Get, 
Learn, Buy, or Call.
 
✓ Don’t use multiple punctuation marks or symbols: For example, ***, 
$$$, ###, and especially not !!!.
 
✓ Don’t use LOTS OF CAPITAL LETTERS: It comes across at best, as 
shouting; at worst, as desperation.
 
✓ Use short, punchy sentences, and bulleted lists (like this one) to make 
for easy reading.
 
✓ Create a sense of urgency: For example, For a Very Limited Time, 3 Days 
Only, Available Only until Midnight, June 12th.
 
✓ Use powerful, colorful, and descriptive adjectives: For example, amaz-
ing instead of special, huge instead of big, wonderful instead of nice, 
unmatched instead of low, immediately instead of fast.
 
✓ Proofread your copy for misspellings, grammar, punctuation, and 
other miskates.
 
Keep in mind that your e-mails reach people who already know at least a little 
about who you are and what you do (otherwise, they wouldn’t have signed up 
to hear from you). So don’t use this valuable opportunity to bore them with 
how many centuries you’ve been in business or that your Great Uncle Donald 
(rest his soul) founded the shop and passed it on to your father Louis, who 
passed it on to you and your brothers Hewey and Dewey. Because, know what? 
Your readers won’t stick around long enough to be bored. They’ll be gone.
 
When people encounter your e-mail messages, it should feel a lot like it does 
when they encounter you personally. If you’re the homespun type, make your 
e-mails homespun. If you come off as an always-on-the-cutting-edge kind of 
person, your e-mails need to reflect that.
Choosing between plain text and HTML
The previous two sections describe the elements of an e-mail message and 
provide tips for writing effective marketing messages. This section discusses 
how the message looks — that is, whether you should use plain text or go the 
bells-and-whistles HTML route. Here, briefly, is the difference:

204
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Plain-text messages are ordinary, unformatted e-mail messages that are 
readable as textual material without much processing. Most of the day-
to-day, conversational e-mails you send from your home computer are 
plain-text messages.
 
✓ HTML (HyperText Markup Language) messages use the same language 
as Web pages to allow the display of rich media content in the e-mail 
message. This means you can write messages that contain all kinds of 
razzly-dazzly stuff like links, images, film clips, and interactive forms.
Some e-mailers like to use plain-text messages (refer to Figure 10-4) and 
maintain no significant difference in readership rates occurs between plain-
text e-mails and those done in HTML. These folks, however, are a minority. 
Most e-mail pros rely on research showing that HTML readership is over-
whelmingly greater than that generated by plain-text formats. So you have 
two schools of thought in the plain text versus HTML debate, but the HTML 
school has about 50 times more students.
 
That lopsided preference, however, doesn’t change the fact that using HTML 
has several downsides:
 
✓ It’s typically more expensive to produce.
 
✓ It requires more bandwidth (the amount of data a given computer can 
successfully download all at once).
 
✓ It often carries viruses.
 
✓ It may not always reproduce properly on the screen of every e-mail 
recipient because some e-mail programs simply don’t show graph-
ics unless the sender’s address is already on the recipient’s approved 
sender list.
The plain-text crowd also argues that e-mail is about content, not design, and 
that given the possibility of technical problems we describe in the preceding 
list, not everyone can or even wants to receive HTML e-mail.
 
To satisfy both sides, most e-mail service providers (ESPs) send multi-part 
format e-mails that let the recipient choose either plain-text or HTML versions. 
(The subject of ESPs is discussed in the “Getting Professional Help with Your 
E-Mail Campaign” section, found later in this chapter.)
The ability to make two versions available is made possible through the use 
of MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), an Internet standard for for-
matting e-mails. With MIME, e-mails are sent in both plain-text and HTML for-
mats, and the recipient’s own, pre-specified e-mail client preferences dictate 
which version automatically shows up on his screen.

205
 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
 
If you’re not working with an ESP though, you’re probably best off sending 
plain-text e-mails at least initially to make sure everyone gets the message. You 
can always branch out into HTML later as you become more familiar with your 
recipients’ tastes and technological capabilities, and as your own computer 
skills expand.
Getting Professional Help with 
Your E-Mail Campaign
Creating your own e-mail mailing list — and having total ownership and con-
trol over it — may sound appealing. But it can become extremely cumber-
some and time-consuming (not to mention, frustrating) to manage.
Unless you have an automated system in-house linked to both your Web 
site and your databases, you’ll have to make all necessary changes manu-
ally (such as removing Mrs. Brown’s address at her request). And when we 
discuss metrics (measurements of effectiveness) in the following section, you 
see that that beast alone can be a killer for a non-specialist to handle. Which 
leaves you with your best option: Don’t do it yourself. Use an ESP instead.
Finding the right tone and look
Personality in print, whether in an e-mail or in 
some other form, is a function not just of what 
you say, but how you say it and what it looks 
like.
For example, starting a message with Hello (not 
that you really should) is completely different 
than starting with Dear, Sir (which you defi-
nitely shouldn’t). The first says “I have some-
thing to share with you;” the other just says, “I 
want something from you.” Which one do you 
suppose is going to get a more welcome recep-
tion from your reader? The challenge here is to 
find that fertile middle ground between being 
overly familiar and overly formal. Let your usual 
(charming) personality be your guide.
The look of your message is also important. 
If you make your message look as “stiff” as a 
business letter or report, you may as well not 
send it at all. On the other hand, gluing together 
a whole bunch of different, boxy chunks, each 
in a different color and with a different type-
face, looks like a ransom note. In the former 
case, you appear too boring to bother with; 
in the later, you come off as too silly to take 
seriously.
Want to know what your e-mails should look 
like? Well, we suggest you start with the kind of 
e-mails that appeal to you when you open them. 
Try figuring out why they have that appeal. Then 
go from there.

206
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
ESPs are companies whose whole reason for being is to make effective e-mail 
campaigns possible for the average local (and even larger than local) busi-
ness owner. And the service options they can offer are so various and cost-
effective that it just doesn’t make financial sense not to use one. After all, you 
specialize in what you do, not in e-mail technology. So let them specialize in 
their field — which starts with saving you a whole hopper-full of headaches.
Just about any reputable ESP can do the following:
 
✓ Provide templates, either for free or at low cost that you can customize 
with your own logo, photographs, and colors.
 
✓ Handle the actual mass-sending of e-mails.
 
✓ Help you get the white listing seal of approval. (ESPs can’t work for 
black-listed clients.)
 
✓ Ensure high delivery rates.
 
✓ Help you with multi-part formatting of your e-mails.
 
✓ Personalize the content.
 
✓ Host your chosen images.
 
✓ Handle unsubscribes.
 
✓ Generate custom reports, including the metrics you want.
 
✓ Help ensure that your e-mail campaigns are compliant with CAN-SPAM. 
(For more information, see the section, “CAN-SPAM Compliance and the 
Opt-In,” later in this chapter.)
Highly useful though they are, selecting an ESP can be tricky. A search online 
quickly demonstrates that ESPs vary in their sophistication, from the simplis-
tic to the complex.
 
Your best bet is to demo a few vendors to see what works for you and what 
doesn’t. Any competent and reputable ESP has some sort of test-flight pro-
gram you can take advantage of, and if one doesn’t offer that, look elsewhere.
Don’t be afraid of what you don’t know. No one expects you to be an e-mail 
expert (otherwise, why would you need them?). So ask questions and see 
how much guidance and expertise the ESP is willing and able to share. More 
is better — and will make you that much more comfortable with your ulti-
mate partner choice.
 
In any case, shop around to make sure you’re getting the features you need at 
a price that makes sense for your business. Table 10-2 shows some of today’s 
most popular ESPs, along with a few helpful details about each one. And, of 
course, many more companies can be found — where else? — on the Internet.

Using Metrics to Gauge Your Success
As with any medium, you can never know how well e-mail works for you if 
you don’t track it. This doesn’t mean that you have to tie every e-mail you 
send to the specific dollar amount it costs you to drive a customer through 
the door (unless that’s what you want to know). But identifying what your 
e-mail program’s objectives are and then measuring against them to deter-
mine your actual success are keys to using the program to your maximum 
benefit.
Your goals in using metrics can be as simple or as complex as you want — 
anything from achieving a 50-percent open rate (which we discuss in the fol-
lowing list) for a particular offer to tracking every conversion to the penny 
with the objective of reaching an ROI of say, 5:1.
The basic e-mail marketing metrics are as follows:
 
✓ Deliverability: The number of e-mails actually delivered (not including 
those that were bounced or otherwise filtered).
 
✓ Open rate: The number of e-mails actually opened (which is significant 
in that it both validates the e-mail addresses used and indicates at least 
some level of interest on your recipient’s part).
 
✓ Click-through rate (CTR): Tells you not only how many people have 
opened your e-mail, but how many have then gone on to click one of the 
links you provided (say, to your landing page).
 
✓ Conversion rate: The number of unique e-mails that resulted in a con-
version (after clicking a provided link, the recipient took some further 
action). This is similar to the CTR, but because it involves even more 
action on the recipient’s part, it’s considered an even more significant 
measure of a customer’s interest in buying.
 
✓ Unsubscribe rate: Tells you how many of your subscribers have opted 
out (jumped ship) and asked to be taken off your e-mail list. At best, this 
is due to a lack of interest; at worst, you did something that didn’t sit 
well with them.
 
✓ Return on marketing investment (ROMI): The revenue actually gener-
ated by your e-mail campaign. This is usually calculated by dividing the 
incremental revenue attributable to your e-mail effort by the total cost 
of producing that effort.
 
Using metrics obviously can tell you a lot about what you’re accomplish-
ing with your e-mail efforts. But, as they like to say on TV, “Don’t try this at 
home.” Doing the necessary diagnostics to deliver quality metrics — not to 
mention coming up with the mega-geek-class algorithms that make the whole 
process possible — is something best left to a professional e-mail company.

 Chapter 10: Saying It with E-Mail
CAN-SPAM Compliance and the Opt-In
There is one primary source of potential trouble for anyone who markets 
their business via e-mail, and there are two things about it that demand your 
close attention: It’s federal law, and it’s a doozy.
The federal CAN-SPAM Act (your own joke goes here) of 2003 essentially 
rewrote the rules of e-mail marketing to inhibit spamming — that lovely 
practice of indiscriminately sending unsolicited e-mail messages. (Recent 
Congressional amendments have, however, somewhat loosened the 
opt-in requirements; for an explanation of that wrinkle, a good source is www.
marketingsherpa.com/sample.cfm?contentID=2555). In any case, 
CAN-SPAM compliance is a tricky beast. Here are a few of the mandates that 
apply most directly to the small business owner:
 
✓ Misrepresentation: Don’t try and lure your e-mail recipient into opening 
your e-mail with false information in the Subject line or misrepresent 
who’s sending the e-mail.
 
✓ Company address: Your e-mail must include your company’s physical 
address; P.O. boxes are not acceptable.
 
✓ Disclosure: If you’re sending a commercial e-mail to people who haven’t 
asked to receive it, you must state that the e-mail is an advertisement, 
using precisely that word. Of course, if your recipients have already 
opted in, you’re exempt from this rule, no matter how advertising-like 
your message may be.
When in doubt, test it!
One of the best things about the e-mail medium 
is that it allows you to do a lot of testing — with 
minimal effort — to find out what works and 
what just flat out doesn’t. Here, too, your ESP 
can prove very helpful.
For example, say you’re going to send 100 
e-mails promoting the same deal or offering the 
same information. You can send 50 with one 
subject line and 50 with another subject line. 
Unless the two lines are really, really similar, 
you get a very quick read on which one works 
better because it gets the greater response.
Or you can try two (or more) different layouts, 
color schemes, or typefaces. Or try personal-
izing one group and not personalizing the other. 
As long as you only use two variables in a single 
test, you’ll probably be surprised what a differ-
ence the little things can make.
Do enough of these tests — and take the results 
to heart, even if they don’t quite line up with 
your initial expectations — and you can quickly 
become a very effective e-mail marketer.

210
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Unsubscribe: Recipients must be able to unsubscribe easily from your 
e-mail; you must then remove them from your mailing list within ten 
days of their request.
 
✓ E-mail sharing: You can’t share the e-mail address of a person who has 
unsubscribed from your list.
 
✓ E-mail harvesting: You can’t collect non-permitted e-mail addresses 
from other sources or randomly generate e-mail addresses.
Fun, huh? But it does address (no pun intended) a serious problem — 
spamming — that’s been giving the whole e-mail marketing world a black eye 
for several years now. So it’s not like Congress is saying “Eat your peas” just 
for the heck of it. And who knows? It might actually do the trick.
 
The bottom line is that compliance with CAN-SPAM is simple: Just do what it 
says. Include a valid unsubscribe method that requires only one click to acti-
vate, promptly unsubscribe people when they ask you to, present your physi-
cal mailing address in your messages, don’t steal e-mail addresses, and don’t 
be misleading. After all, when you think about it, it’s really just common sense. 
But whether you like the rules or not, they apply to every business, large or 
small, that sends e-mail. Period.
Getting permission is still the safest way
All the information in the section, “CAN-SPAM 
Compliance and the Opt-In,” earlier in this 
chapter, notwithstanding, the regulations cur-
rently being issued under CAN-SPAM are 
beginning to trend more toward opt out than 
opt in as the preferred e-mail model. But don’t 
get too excited because you ignore the original 
act at your peril.
By not working with permission, you risk alien-
ating the audience that you’re trying so hard 
to reach. You’re invading their privacy. You’re 
choking their inboxes. You’re just basically 
coming across as a pest. So, even if you think 
you’ve found some wiggle room in the law, don’t 
wiggle. Stay within the bounds of the act as 
written, and nobody gets hurt.
And remember: No matter what the law says, 
in today’s world of e-mail marketing, opt in and 
permission still starkly separates the legitimate 
marketer (like you) from the dratted spammer. 
So be smart, be compliant, and prosper.

Linking Up with Directories and 
Lead Aggregators
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the strengths of directories and lead aggregators
▶ Recognizing how directories differ from search engines
▶ Understanding how directories and lead aggregators work
▶ Identifying the best directories and creating an effective profile
▶ Using local listings, including community sites, to build your business
▶ Going with a lead aggregator, or not
D
o you need to search for restaurants in a particular neighborhood, look 
up a phone number for a local repair service, or are you planning a 
weekend getaway and want to compare hotel rates? These activities probably 
motivate you to use a search engine (along with 90 percent of Web users), or 
to rely on a directory (such as Internet Yellow Pages or Yelp) or a lead aggre-
gator (such as ServiceMagic.com).
Directories present Web users with listings of participating local businesses, 
often organized by business type. They’re popular because they represent 
one-stop shopping for people who want to do business with a company 
located in their area. Related to (but not quite the same as) directories are 
lead aggregators. They do pretty much exactly what their name suggests: 
They bundle customer leads that they acquire on the Web and then market 
them to local businesses for follow up.
In this chapter, we dig into what makes directories and lead aggregators 
tick — and why they motivate so many Web users to click.

212
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
What’s So Great about Directories 
and Lead Aggregators?
What can directories and lead aggregators do for your business? Potentially, 
a lot because they can bring you new customers in two ways:
 
✓ By capturing search traffic: Listing sites are the category killers we talk 
about in Chapter 7. These sites contain so much relevant content — 
and consequently attract so many clicks — that they tend to rank high 
in organic search results (see Chapters 7 and 8 for information about 
organic results) and push local business Web sites down the page. For 
businesses that rely solely on organic listings, this isn’t great news. But 
for a local business that’s included in these extremely potent sites, it 
can be wonderful news.
 
✓ By delivering direct traffic: Web users are becoming increasingly aware 
that local listing sites exist and go to them directly to find local products 
and services. Not only does this convenience save them the intermedi-
ate step of using a search engine, but it also often gives them value-
added content, such as customer reviews and ratings.
Seeing that Directories 
Aren’t Search Engines
Directories and lead aggregators can be lumped together into a set of Web 
tools known as listing sites. People often confuse listing sites with search 
engines, which is only natural because these Web tools work in similar ways 
and often work together. Understanding exactly how they differ is the key to 
using each properly.
Search engines are often the entry points to listing sites, and you can think 
of listing sites as the fulfillment engines that pay off a search. Figure 11-1 
illustrates the relationships among three online resources: a search engine, a 
directory, and a local business Web site.
The general differences between search engines and listing sites include
 
✓ Sourcing: Search engines use software to crawl sites to find appropriate 
content (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more about crawling), but businesses 
submit their sites to one or more listing sites, where their business site 
is typically reviewed by in-the-flesh human editors. Unless something’s 
really bizarre about your Web site, you aren’t likely to have any trouble 
getting listed.

✓ Organization: Listing sites and search engines also organize their data-
bases differently. Search engines score the sites they find on the basis 
of relevance, but listing sites generally use a hierarchical tree structure 
that zooms in from the general to the specific. For example, a listing 
site might have a topical organization for listing electricians that looks 
like this:
For the Home>Home Improvement>Electricians
 
 When you submit your business for consideration by listing sites, identi-
fying the right category is important; otherwise, you won’t be found. The 
categories are provided by each listing site and can differ slightly from 
site to site. However, they’re all based on simple common sense, so you 
aren’t likely to get trapped in some organizational corner where only 
customers with bloodhounds can find you.

214
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Landing: This is a major distinction between search engines and listing 
sites. Listing sites usually list other Web sites, whereas search engines 
generally list Web pages. As a result, a listing site doesn’t drive visitors 
to land on a specific page you’ve created; they simply arrive at your 
home page.
Exposing the How and What of Directories
Directories run on listings that local businesses submit directly to them, 
whereupon those lovable human editors step in to inspect the business sites 
and decide whether they’re worthy of being listed. Happily, the worthiness 
bar isn’t set all that high, but it serves to weed out the occasional wacko and 
other completely-in-the-wrong-category submissions.
The listings that survive this screening — which are the vast majority of 
them — are compiled into categories and listed alphabetically, starting with 
(what else?) A.
How directories get customer traffic
Directories use several techniques to attract visitors:
 
✓ Organic: Search engines sort through directories and index them 
to match various search queries. For example, if you type plumber 
Memphis into Google, a broad-based directory (such as Citysearch or 
Superpages.com) is nearly certain to produce several listings that match 
those search terms. Because directories with content that’s rich in key-
words — and therefore, eminently findable by search engines — are usu-
ally listed high in the organic search results, people tend to click them 
first and foremost.
 
✓ Paid: Some directories use pay-per-click (PPC) ads to buy their way into 
a prime search results position to take advantage of the chance that 
consumers will find at least one business in the directory to suit their 
needs.
 
✓ Direct: Many directories use traditional media, such as TV and radio, to 
drive consumers to their Web sites. A prime example of this strategy is 
illustrated by many of the Internet Yellow Pages companies. We take a 
look at such companies in the section, “Identifying the Best Directories,” 
later in this chapter.

215
 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
How directories get listings
The business sites submitted to directories aren’t the directories’ only 
source of content. Directories also often buy listings from data compila-
tion companies, such as Localeze or infoUSA, because they want to provide 
searchers with a more comprehensive set of businesses and a better user 
experience. Additionally, having a more comprehensive set of business list-
ings has the potential to increase that directory’s overall presence in the 
organic results of the search engines.
That said, don’t be concerned with a directory’s content strategy. Focus on 
figuring out what directories have a strong online presence for your specific 
geography and industry.
The sort of information directories 
usually publish
In their listings, local directories typically include each business’s name 
(obviously), physical address, phone number, and hours of operation. Some 
directories also let businesses include ratings they’ve received from custom-
ers. Businesses can often (for a price) mention their current promotions, 
upload coupons, and provide access to videos. The upshot of such extras is 
that businesses listed in the directory give their would-be customers a handy 
summary of the basic information they need to know.
 
Some directories organize and present their business listings using criteria 
other than alphabetical order. The most common of these other criteria is the 
strength of each business’s customer ratings. If your business has good cus-
tomer ratings, flaunt them (tastefully, of course) in your listing.
Inside the directories: 
What are your options?
You can take advantage of directories in a number of ways, and most cost 
you little or nothing. The options that directories usually give you include
 
✓ Free listings: What can we say? They’re free. Upload your informa-
tion to the directory, and they list you. However, you may start out (or 
heaven forbid, stay) at or near the bottom of the listings for a number 
of reasons. For example, you’re the newest addition, your business’s 

216
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
name starts with Z, or you don’t (yet) get high user ratings. Practically 
speaking, this bad placement problem is a stumbling block only for local 
businesses whose geographic market area is huge and jam-packed with 
competitors.
 
✓ Display: Some directories sell banner advertising to their listers. The 
banner ad for your business shows on the directory’s site and is usually 
priced on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis. The CPM generally ranges 
from $2–$20. (If that cost sounds a little steep to you, remember that 
you’re paying for a thousand views per fee — which is a lot of exposure.)
 
✓ Listing fee: This option involves paying a monthly listing fee that can 
range anywhere from a few dollars a month to several hundred dol-
lars a month. This fee ensures that you get a nice, fat, visible spot in 
the directory’s listings (not unlike PPC ads on a search engine results 
page). Recognize that your chosen directory may not offer the listing fee 
option, and many businesses don’t use it even when it’s available.
 
 If the listing fee cost is only a few dollars a month, it may simply be a no 
brainer. However, the only circumstance that justifies paying a fee of 
several hundred dollars per month is when you’re fighting to get noticed 
among scores of other competitive businesses. Unless your geographic 
market is a huge city, this isn’t likely to be the case. But, hey, it’s your 
business, your money, and your call.
Identifying the Best Directories
Simply put, finding the best directories for your business usually comes 
down to how you want to be found. This list clarifies the various directory 
options you have available:
 
✓ Internet Yellow Pages (IYP): These online versions of the good ol’ print 
mainstays you grew up with have inherent brand recognition among 
consumers, which can translate into significant customer traffic. People 
think of IYP as easy places to look up stuff, like with the paper versions. 
IYP often provide city guides and are starting to offer extras like user-
generated content, including reviews and ratings. The most prominent 
IYPs are
 
• Superpages.com: www.superpages.com
 
• Yellowpages.com: www.yellowpages.com
 
• Yellowbook: www.yellowbook.com
 
• DexKnows: www.dexknows.com
 
✓ Local directories: Provide deep local content across a broad array of local 
business categories — as opposed to listing just restaurants or just building 
contractors. They often use reviews and ratings to help consumers 

217
 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
wade through the listings they publish. Local directories are very similar to 
IYP, but without the familiar phone book heritage. Still, local directories are 
plenty successful, and they include the following sites:
 
• Yelp: Relies heavily on extensive ratings and reviews to help 
people find great local businesses. (www.yelp.com)
 
• Citysearch: Similar to Yelp with extensive reviews on local busi-
nesses. Owned by IAC, who also runs a number of other online 
properties such as the search engine Ask.com and lead aggregator 
ServiceMagic.com. (http://citysearch.com)
 
• Local.com: An easy way to find local businesses via features like top 
searches, local favorites, and local coupons. (www.local.com)
 
• BrightPages: Lets searchers find their favorite business listings, and 
organize, share, and store them, too. (www.brightpages.com)
 
• Kudzu: Designed to help searchers save time by featuring buying 
advice, buyer’s guides deals, discounts, and more. (www.kudzu.com)
 
✓ Vertical directories: Present site listings for specific business catego-
ries, which are often referred to in the ad biz as vertical markets. Users 
who like vertical directories already have their desired category in mind, 
and their search is largely a matter of geography. They ask, “Which well-
ranked businesses (in terms of ratings, if the directory includes them) 
are the most conveniently located?” Examples of vertical directories are
 
• 1800Dentist: Enables searchers to find a nearby dentist by entering 
a zip code. (www.1800dentist.com)
 
• Urbanspoon: A popular local restaurant site. (www.urbanspoon.com)
 
• newyorkdoctors.com: Helps searchers find the local doctors their 
friends and neighbors recommend. (www.newyorkdoctors.com)
The not-really-all-that-difficult process of 
picking the right directory to list with
Start your search for the best directory (or directories) for your business to 
list with by searching for the keywords you think your potential customers 
would use to find you online and seeing what appears in the organic search 
results. Then dive into some of the sites you see with these questions in 
mind:
 
✓ Does a directory rank in the top five of the search results? If so, click 
through to the directory itself and have a look around. Does the direc-
tory look like a comfy fit for your business? If so, that one deserves big 
points – and serious consideration.

218
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Does the directory contain authoritative content? A directory’s no 
place for vagueness or pussyfooting. Do these folks seem like they know 
what they’re talking about? Do they give visitors solid information or 
just fluff? Obviously, you should prefer the former.
 
✓ Does the directory have credibility? The credibility factor results from 
evaluating a hodgepodge of characteristics. For example, does the direc-
tory appear to serve visitors efficiently and well, giving them useful 
information without making them jump through hoops to find it? Do you 
imagine that its service effectively instills confidence in users? Would 
you feel comfortable relying on this directory to accurately represent 
your business? All these factors are important to online searchers and 
need to be important to you.
 
Above all, use your own good judgment to evaluate directories. Remember 
that you’re trying to assess the value of a directory based on how valuable 
you think its visitors find it. Do they see the directory as well-presented or 
clunky to navigate? Do visitors get a really good, thorough array of listings 
or do the offerings seem kind of lame? And so on. If you think the directory 
seems to be someplace visitors would and should like to visit, that counts for 
a lot.
So . . . are directories a good way to go?
As a general rule, listing your business Web site with directories is a solid 
advertising tactic. Their basic listings often gives you a free (or nearly free) 
way to drive traffic to your Web site. Also, if you have your business Web site 
placed on a number of directories, the search engines are likely to find your 
site and give it an individual organic listing on their results pages — which, of 
course, is also free and can drive even more traffic your way. Directories are 
also an excellent way to get the kind of external linking we discuss in Chapter 8, 
and that can help you merit an improved ranking for your site in search engine 
results.
The only downside to using directories is that directories individually often 
aren’t guaranteed sources of a lot of traffic and seldom are sufficient to be 
your only source of traffic. Moreover, placing listings or buying space on a 
bunch of directories, unless you have the help of a local online advertising 
company, can in aggregate, eat up a lot of your time. Our recommendation 
is to focus on those directories you determine are most likely to have a real 
impact on your business instead of worrying about showing up on all of 
them.

219
 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
Sharing Information with 
Your Chosen Directories
When you submit your site to a directory for listing, you’re often asked to 
provide a company profile. Make sure this profile is a manageable-to-the-
reader encapsulation of exactly what your business does, plus any (brief) 
selling kind thing you want to add. For example, state that you’re the top in 
your market area or the longest-established business. You have to be fairly 
concise because directories don’t give you all that much room to state your 
case. Then again, you have as much room as your competitors, so the playing 
field’s pretty even.
How’s your profile?
In preparing your profile, provide as much detailed information as you can 
within the limits imposed by the directory. Remember that you aren’t writing 
your memoirs, just providing useful and compelling information.
Directory profiles, like the one shown in Figure 11-2, usually let you include a 
mix of content elements, such as
 
✓ Basic business information: This includes the name, address, phone 
number, business hours, and so on.
 
✓ A succinct description of the products/services you offer: Also include 
any industry affiliations or other relevant info, such as the number of 
years in business, that you think are worth mentioning.
 
✓ Awards, reviews, and ratings you’ve received: These can be from busi-
ness organizations, local publications, or even from real customers. The 
reviews you publish shouldn’t (and due to space limitations, usually 
can’t) go on and on. Pick out the really good parts of the most flattering 
reviews.
 
✓ Special promotions, coupons, discounts: Mention any other offers you 
have going.
 
✓ A reasonably sized photo gallery: In some cases, also include access to 
video material.

220

Figure 11-2: 
A typical 
profile page

tory site 
(Yelp).
 
Your profile is a constant work in progress
Just like with your Web site, you must keep your profile current. For example, 
if your profile spotlights Louie as your most experienced and knowledgeable 
salesperson, Louie better still be on your staff when a visitor comes knock-
ing. Otherwise, you risk looking like details aren’t all that important — or 
worse. Ditto for the product lines you handle and the services you offer: They 
have to be kept up to date.
Keep refreshing your promotions and your customer testimonials, too. Make 
sure that any links to your site that you’ve given the directory still work. 
Sure, you may have a stellar profile on the directory, but if people click your 
link and nothing happens . . . well, that’s the end of that.
 
Do some testing to help evaluate the effectiveness of your directory profile. 
If you already use metrics to track your Web site’s performance, you can tell 
where your site traffic comes from, including how much comes through a 
directory. Tweak a few things in your profile to see whether that helps (or 
hurts) the amount of directory traffic you get.

 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
Tapping into Community Sites: 
Craigslist and Then Some
Whether you just launched your Web site or have been at it for years, estab-
lishing a customer base within your local community is the whole point of 
your efforts. That makes local sites an invaluable way to drum up new busi-
ness in your market.
Community sites are among the most popular of these local venues. They are 
a form of a directory that, as the name implies, give visitors a feel for what’s 
happening in their community — a snapshot of who’s doing what, selling 
what, and even in some cases, thinking what. Using community sites is a 
great way to get wide marketing coverage at little or no cost.
 
Many consumers prefer to do business with a local company, one with whom 
they can establish a personal relationship. This is especially true for consumers 
who don’t have much of a comfort level dealing with businesses solely on an 
online basis. These potential customers want a local phone number they can 
call or a local address they can visit to get to know you and your company.
As for finding the right local portal(s), that’s easy. Head to Google and type 
the name of your town or city. And presto! — there they are. By doing so, 
you’re mimicking the behavior of your own local customers and prospects, 
and what better “teachers” could you ask for?
A grapevine for the 21st Century
Consumers love — don’t just like, but love — using local Web resources. 
Nielsen NetRatings’ statistics from 2001 show that community sites (and local 
search engines) are among the most often-visited kinds of sites for American 
Internet users. And the ever-growing use of portals like these is pretty easy 
to understand. People look for news and information that’s relevant to them, 
and what’s going on — and what’s available — in their community could 
hardly be more relevant.
In short, local portals are gateways for the community’s members. Because 
these sites provide a central point for them to find good local information, 
as well as locally based Web sites, they flock to them. This is good news for 
your business.
Some people know from experience which portals to use. Others get to these 
sites via a search engine (and search engines host plenty of local content, as 
we explain in Chapter 1).

222
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
We don’t want to over-promise on the business impact from local portals. 
Although they’re wildly popular among consumers, local portals don’t drive 
unimaginable hordes of leads to local businesses. A lot of portal users just go 
there to see what’s happening in their area and then move on to other things. 
Still, these sites can drive some additional, profitable leads to your door at 
little or no cost.
The local portals we’re talking about include
 
✓ Community sites: These sites put all sorts of local information — from 
the recent birth of the Henderson twins to the local police blotter — 
under one roof. Many also offer services like e-mail and discussion 
forums where people in the city or town can communicate with each 
other about, well . . . stuff.
 
 Some examples are
 
• www.alloveralbany.com
 
• www.hellomemphis.com
 
• www.americantowns.com/mn/minneapolis
 
✓ Craigslist: Unless you’ve been orbiting the earth for the last decade 
or so, you’ve at least heard of Craigslist. It is the Mother of All Local 
Portals, which may at first strike you as a little odd because it’s a nation-
ally run site. The Craigslist folks break down the listings they get into 
very specific geographical areas. These listings are really just online 
classified ads for practically anything: jobs, housing, personals, commu-
nity events, local goods and services, resumes, discussion forums — and 
a few dozen other things.
 
 Most important from your standpoint is that the postings on Craigslist 
are gloriously free. If you haven’t yet frequented the wonderful world of 
Craigslist, do — because if nothing else, it’s something else. (Figure 11-3 
shows Craigslist’s somewhat charmingly chaotic home page, and Figure 
11-4 shows a typical business listing.)
 
✓ Angie’s List: Another major player in the community listings universe, 
Angie’s List is one of many companies that aggregate consumer reviews 
of local businesses. Angie’s List is unique among those other portals 
because it charges consumers to see the reviews. Huh? Why? Because 
the people at Angie’s List believe that charging consumers adds cred-
ibility to the information they find there. (The fact that Angie’s List is as 
successful as it is would seem to indicate they’re actually onto some-
thing here.)
 
 Angie’s List grades companies with an A–F report card based on con-
sumer reviews and accepts advertising only from companies that score 
a B or better. Although consumers pay a membership fee, posting is free 
to advertisers, but only after an Angie’s List member submits a report 
about her experience with the would-be advertiser’s company. And 
nope, no cheating allowed: You can’t pay your way onto Angie’s List, 

223
 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
although if you’re already there and have a good rating, some advertis-
ing options for extra visibility are available.
 
✓ Oodle: An up-and-comer, Oodle is a directory of classified advertisings, 
including local business advertising. Oodle doesn’t have a long track 
record, but postings are free and the portal has a decent reputation — 
so what do you have to lose?

Some other local portals
If your business is located within a 30-mile radius of a major city, contact 
the premier newspaper that serves it and ask to have your site linked to the 
paper’s portal. You can do the same with the newspapers located in smaller 
cities and towns, though these portals are likely to be a good deal less sophisti-
cated than those offered by the big papers. And if you haven’t done so already, 
become a member of your local Chamber of Commerce or Visitors Bureau so 
you can take advantage of these organizations’ Web presence.
The upside of local portals is that there really isn’t any downside. Such local 
portals can help as follows:
 
✓ Newspaper Web sites: These bring reputable, high-quality content and 
a loyal readership to the party, both of which can be beneficial to a 
business that wants to run a listing. To stay competitive with the kinds 
of portals listed earlier, the newspaper sites are also expanding into 
features like videos, blogs, and other user-generated content such as 
reviews and ratings. Most major-paper sites include a shopping guide, 
an event guide, and/or a directory, and inclusion in them is usually free. 
Depending on your location, you can use
 
• The Washington Post: www.washingtonpost.com
 
• The New York Times: www.nytimes.com
 
• The Seattle Times: www.seattletimes.com
 
• The Boston Globe: www.boston.com/bostonglobe
 
• Or whatever big-shot paper serves your city.
 
✓ Chambers of Commerce and Visitors Bureaus: Because so many people 
go online for information these days, the Chambers and Bureaus now 
offer a number of reasonably priced services designed to promote their 
members’ businesses and drive traffic to their Web sites. (Plus, with most 
Chambers of Commerce, you also get invited to a spiffy monthly luncheon 
where you can network your brains off and also, you know, eat.)
Considering Lead Aggregators
Lead aggregators are companies that generate qualified leads — meaning 
phone calls or Web inquiries — for local businesses. Although not techni-
cally directories, aggregators are another way in which local businesses 
can gather customers via centralized, business-related Web sites. A few 
examples include ServiceMagic.com (see Figure 11-5) or BidClerk.com for 
home improvement businesses, or 1800Dentist.com for — you guessed it — 
dentists.

225
 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
Lead aggregators generate leads primarily using two of the proven traffic 
builders we discuss elsewhere in the book (organic search listings in 
Chapter 8 and PPC ads in Chapter 9), and they’re a particularly useful tool for 
business owners who are just getting started in online marketing.
Generally speaking, lead aggregators use one (or both) of two models:
 
✓ Direct aggregation: Involves using either PPC ads or some kind of tradi-
tional media to drive consumers to navigate the lead aggregator directly. 
When someone clicks an aggregator’s PPC ad or goes to its site, he sees 
its client’s listings in all their glory. The business is then charged only 
when a consumer contacts them directly from those listings.
 
✓ Indirect aggregation: This model is kind of backwards. In indirect 
aggregation, the lead aggregator buys or otherwise, generates leads in 
a particular market category and then sells those leads to multiple local 
businesses within that category.
 
Figure 11-5: 
Service-
Magic.com 
aggregates 
leads to 
then sell to 
contractors.
 
In both cases, the aggregator assumes all the risk for buying the leads. The 
business owner usually pays on a cost-per-lead or cost-per-referral basis, 
which puts the local business on the hook only for actual leads delivered — 
and that’s a pretty good deal.

226
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Looking at the pros and cons
As with just about everything else you can do in life, using lead aggregators 
has its plusses, its minuses, and its really bad minus-minuses:
 
✓ The plusses:
 
• You can buy leads that have a strongly predictable cost.
 
• You save labor, time, and money.
 
• You can buy what you need at the time you need it. Your own 
timeline is the determining factor in whether and when you use an 
aggregator.
 
✓ The minuses:
 
• Leads from an aggregator can cost more than DIY-created leads, 
though whether this is true usually depends on how adept a given 
business is at doing its online marketing.
 
• Especially with indirect aggregation, a lead is often passed to mul-
tiple businesses at the same time, which results in a race to reach 
the consumer. Some businesses see this as a challenge; others see 
it as a pain.
 
• With a bunch of businesses beating down their doors (or more 
accurately, ringing their phones off the hook), consumers can feel 
overwhelmed and get testy about the whole thing.
 
✓ The really bad minus-minuses:
 
• Businesses don’t wind up with their very own name getting vis-
ibility because aggregators run generic category ads; for example, 
Funeral Homes in Warwick RI.
 
• Aggregators tend to go after the easy pickings rather than take the 
time to understand your business and thereby help you pursue 
more elusive, bigger-ticket customers. If nothing else, you don’t 
want to rely solely on a lead aggregator to generate business 
because it’s unlikely to feed you enough new customers to satisfy 
your goals.
 
• You know that race to reach the customers we mention earlier? 
Well, guess what else happens when that happens: price wars. If 
your margins aren’t all that big to begin with, you probably don’t 
want to get involved in any crazed race to financial ruin.

227
 Chapter 11: Linking Up with Directories and Lead Aggregators
Deciding who needs to use an aggregator
As a general rule, lead aggregators tend to work best for commodity-based 
businesses. Companies whose services are widely available in the market — 
and whose customers can change suppliers seamlessly — may well find that 
having someone else generate good, numerous leads is a big help to their 
business. This may include businesses like snow removal services, lawn 
mowing companies, movers, storage operators, and so on.
If your business fits that particular mold, great: A lead aggregator could 
prove to be a real asset. But this path isn’t completely strewn with roses 
because lead aggregation requires a few things from you that may or may not 
present a problem for you and your business, namely
 
✓ Response speed: Some competitors have trained and equipped them-
selves to respond to an incoming lead within one minute by phone or 
e-mail. (Wow.) Unless you have the resources to do the same (at least 
do so more often than not), your competitor has a serious advantage in 
getting the business.
 
✓ Price sensitivity: When more than one business responds to a lead, 
the customer holds a strong hand; he can play the companies off one 
another to get the lowest price and can get so into the game that he 
ends up putting price before quality in making his decision. The net 
result for you is that you can ultimately lose leads you’ve paid for to 
competitors who can better afford to cut prices.
 
✓ Phone sales skills: You’ll be dealing with an incoming lead who is also 
talking to your competitors. Do you, or does someone on your staff, 
have the phone skills and savvy necessary to shuffle the prospect into 
your arms and close the sale? It’s important that you do or that you 
learn these skills in a hurry.
 
✓ Chasing (too) expensive leads: In the crush of competition, you can easily 
lose sight of what your actual lead acquisition costs are relative to your 
actual sales conversion rate. This isn’t helped by the fact that lead aggre-
gators are in the habit of adding new lead sources to their own roster on 
a regular basis, and some less-than-stellar leads can result. You may have 
a hard time sorting the good leads from the hopeless ones, but you have 
to apply some cost-benefit (and time-benefit) analysis to your efforts to 
make sure you aren’t losing money pursuing dead ends.
 
You might conclude from this discussion that using a lead aggregator is a 
bigger headache than it’s worth, but why not find out? Contact and retain one 
for what you plan to be a limited time. If the leads the aggregator produces are 
profitable, great. If not, also great because now at least you know that this isn’t 
the way to go about generating leads for your business. And that lesson won’t

S
earch engine marketing — whether pay-per-click (PPC), search engine 
optimization, local search opportunities, or a combination — proves 
its effectiveness every day for businesses. Getting your business listed with 
directories and lead aggregators can be highly effective as well.
However, these tactics aren’t the only ways to make Internet marketing work 
for you. Because using more than one marketing channel to drive business 
your way is always a good idea, consider using new advertising media based 
on old-school marketing tools, such as display ads, newsletters, sponsor-
ships, and classified advertising. Each of these has its own online version, 
and they translate very effectively to the Web.
This chapter looks at these new media approaches. They aren’t difficult to 
use and they all can be very productive ways to generate impressions, con-
versions, and better yet, sales.
Casting a Wider Net with Online Tools
One tried-and-true marketing principle is to never rely on one form of adver-
tising to reach new customers. Effective campaigns — whether Web-based or 

230
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
not — have always relied on the advertiser’s ability to adopt a sound 
media mix. Ideally, you want to cast a wide net to reach customers anywhere 
you can.
In addition to and as a counterpart of search, these tools help cast a 
wider net:
 
✓ Banner ads: A banner ad is a form of online advertising that most closely 
mirrors print or display advertising. It simply entails embedding an 
ad into a Web page. In the past, your business may have used outdoor 
advertising, newspaper ads, or magazine ads. Banner advertising essen-
tially does the same thing, but on the Web with potentially more impact.
 
✓ E-newsletters: Surely you’ve received a printed newsletter and maybe 
you even subscribe to receive it. Marketers love newsletters because 
they’re cheap to produce, give consumers a more complete feel for the 
company, and provide an in-depth look at the products and services 
offered. E-newsletters can easily accomplish the same thing — without 
killing trees and at a far lower cost (after all, killing trees and mailing 
them all around your area can be expensive). Plus, with no printing and 
mailing necessary, e-newsletters are far more customizable and far more 
measurable as a marketing channel.
 
✓ E-newsletter sponsorships: For example, ever sponsored a little league 
team? You put your company’s name and logo on the kids’ jerseys and 
may even place your company’s name and logo on the outfield wall, 
depending on how much you’re willing to spend. An online e-newsletter 
sponsorship is an idea that’s cut from the same cloth in that it allows 
you to brand your local business (and possibly gain some good will) 
with an audience that may not otherwise receive exposure to your busi-
ness. The only difference is that instead of little league fans, your busi-
ness gets exposure from whoever the e-newsletter owner’s subscriber 
base happens to be.
 
✓ Online classified ads: What business hasn’t used classified ads? Even 
today, the Classifieds section of the local Sunday paper is big and heavy. 
The upside of print classifieds is that they’re divided neatly into distinct 
categories; the downside is that they cost money to run. Online classi-
fieds are also broken into categories, but they’re almost always free.
Like their traditional counterparts, each of these online tools is opportunistic — 
the stream of traffic each generates isn’t usually steady, but occasional. Because 
you never know where your next customer will come from or what marketing 
vehicle will rope a customer into your business’s fold, each of these online tac-
tics is worth some serious consideration. And don’t forget that just like search 
marketing, you can always try them, test them, and then decide whether they’re 
making a significant contribution to your return on investment (ROI).

Running Banner Ads
A lot of people respond to banner ads, which is why you see lots of them 
online. Banner ads can also do wonders for establishing a brand (which we 
discuss a bit further in the “Leveraging the power of banner ads” section, 
later in this chapter). In other words, banner advertising is popular because 
it works.
Banner ads appear on a Web page in a separate box containing graphics, 
bright colors, a little bit of copy, and sometimes even animation. Somewhere 
amidst all that is usually a link that goes to the sponsor’s Web site to read 
more about whatever the ad touts.
Each time someone sees a banner ad, it counts as an impression. Each time 
someone clicks the link, it counts as a click-through. Advertising rates for 
banner ads are often based on impressions, click-throughs, or on some com-
bination of the two. Many sites are hesitant to pay on a cost-per-click basis 
in that actual clicks depend on your banner ad’s creative design (which they 
often have no control over).
Figure 12-1 shows an example of banner ads on a local portal site.

Leveraging the power of banner ads
Banner ads can accomplish a lot of things for an advertiser, including
 
✓ Generating more Web site traffic and ultimately, sales: Banner ads 
put your message prominently in front of potential customers. Executed 
well, they can be sufficiently enticing to drive prospects to your Web 
site in significant numbers. Unless your Web site is seriously sub-par, 
that can markedly increase your sales.
 
✓ Effectively advertising new products: Banner ads are an excellent way 
to create consumer interest in the new offering because they give you 
the freedom (albeit in limited space) to make your key copy points as 
well as present photos and animation to drive home the points.
 
✓ Building a brand: Your brand name is perhaps your most important busi-
ness asset. Your brand is what people first become familiar with, what they 
remember most, and what becomes the basis for putting their trust in you. 
Establishing a brand is tough if you — and/or your Web site — aren’t widely 
known yet (in the case of a local business, in its specific locale). Banner ads 
can help fix this because, in essence, they find your potential customers 
rather than making you wait for them to find you. Your Web site and your 
logo appear while your potential customers are on someone else’s site. 
Advertising people call this interruptive, but it’s a great way to draw atten-
tion — and new business — to your company’s door.
Choosing a type and size 
for your banner ad
Banner ads come in a variety of flavors. Sizes, for example, range from minis-
cule button ads to page-wide leaderboard ads. Banner ad formats are varied, 
too. Although the most popular banner ads remain the standard Web image 
formats — JPEG, GIF, and PNG — Flash ads are becoming the dominant 
format on many sites. Flash allows the use of animation and even game-style 
interaction to maximize the impact of banner ads.
As shown in Figure 12-2, the most common sizes (in width x length) for 
banner ads are
 
✓ Standard banner: 468 x 60 pixels
 
✓ Half banner: 234 x 60 pixels
 
✓ Vertical banner: 120 x 240 pixels

233
 Chapter 12: Targeting Customers with Banner Ads, E-Newsletter Ads, and More
 
✓ Leaderboard: 728 x 90 pixels
 
✓ Microbar: 88 x 31 pixels
 
✓ Square button: 125 x 125 pixels
 
✓ Skyscrapers: 160 x 600 pixels or 120 x 600 (more typical)
 
✓ Medium rectangle: 300 x 250 pixels

Picking the location, location, location
Where your banner ads appear depends on two questions:
 
✓ On what sites should your ad appear? This decision usually comes down 
to our old friend, relevance. Running a banner ad for your house-cleaning 
business on a local accountant’s Web site doesn’t make sense. On the 
other hand, running that ad on a local home-remodeling business’s site is 
smart. Of course, some relevant connections are a lot more obvious (such 
as selling chiropractic services on a local gym’s Web site).
 
✓ What kind of consumers are you after? Pay attention to demographic 
relevance — target the right people in terms of age, gender, interests, 
income, education, and so on. Probably the easiest place to find a demo-
graphically correct audience for your ad is to use a Web site operated 
by a popular magazine. The magazine’s demographics are usually pretty 
obvious (Adirondack Life for upper New York summer residents and 
year-round outdoor types, Memphis Sport for sports and fitness buffs, 
North Shore Living for affluent Massachusetts folks, and so on).
 
 Local magazine sites aren’t the only easy pickings available. You have 
lots of other Web sites to choose from, such as those that cater to a par-
ticular hobby, specialize in career-finding, or offer medical information. 
Are the people who visit one of those kinds of sites the same people you 
want to visit yours? If so, rock on.
Making contact with the site 
to place your banner ad
You may think that getting in touch with another site owner to find out about 
placing one of your banner ads is a difficult process; it isn’t. The easiest way 
to get in touch with a site owner is to use the site’s contact e-mail address or 
phone number and then ask about placing advertising. (Doing so is money 
in their pocket, so they’ll get back to you pronto.) Some sites make it even 
easier by posting a For Advertisers link at the bottom of their home page. By 
all means, click that.
After you make contact, find out what rates the site charges for banner adver-
tising. (We talk in some detail about prices later in this chapter in the sec-
tions “Pricing of banner ads” and “Paying to create a banner ad.”) Assuming 
you’re satisfied with the price involved — as well as with the visitor-volume 
numbers, demographic information, and average click-through rates the site-
owner gives you — you’re good to go.
In the online world, you discover quickly whether the ad gives you an uptick 
in your site’s traffic numbers. Nice uptick? Hang in there. No uptick? Look for 
another site to place your ad on. In most cases, you can track what happens 

235
 Chapter 12: Targeting Customers with Banner Ads, E-Newsletter Ads, and More
after people arrive at your site. For instance, do they stay, fill out a form, or 
just fall off? This is all highly useful stuff.
Sort of like in doubling down in blackjack, place banner ads on more than one 
site (budget permitting, of course). This almost always brings you higher vis-
ibility, a wider audience, and more potential sales.
Making your banner ad perform well
None of the tips that follow are difficult, but they can make a big difference in 
the amount of Web site traffic your banner ad draws:
 
✓ Design your ad for specific sites: One way to get more click-throughs is to 
design your banner ad to closely mirror the look and feel of the site that 
it appears on. Another way (oddly enough) is to produce an ad that’s in 
stark contrast to the host site to be interruptive and grab attention.
 
✓ Animate your banner: Animated banner ads outperform static ads by 
a significant margin because movement nearly always attracts the read-
er’s eye. You can make your visual element blink or actually have the 
object(s) in your ad do something. This probably requires the services 
of a Web designer and will cost $100–$300 (perhaps less).
 
✓ Keep your copy brief and provocative: Words like Free, Act Now, and 
Discount are proven attention-getters. You can also try different copy 
approaches to see which ones draw the most traffic to your site.
 
✓ Control the graphic weight of your banner: Most Web sites that take 
banner ads have weight restrictions — the graphics you use in your ad can’t 
be so complex and bandwidth-hungry that the Web-page won’t load effi-
ciently. A good guideline is to keep your banner’s file size less than 20KB.
 
✓ Test versions of your banner ad: Create more than one version of your 
banner ad and then test each version for, say, 72 hours to see which ver-
sion generates the most click-throughs and conversions. You can then 
use this winner as a benchmark against which to test other versions. 
Note: If the versions differ in too many ways, you can’t get a clean read 
as to which elements are working best, so limit your changing elements 
to one or two per version.
 
✓ Track the banner ad’s performance: Regularly review the performance 
statistics for your banner ad. Most ad networks or publishers are well-
equipped to provide these stats. The average click-through rate is 
between 0.5–2 percent. If after about three days, you aren’t getting an 
acceptable return rate, swap out your current ad for a different version.
 
Just as with search engine advertising, make sure that the landing page that 
appears when people click your ad is consistent in subject matter with the 
message of the ad. Doing so almost always boosts your conversion rate, 
whereas not doing so can make you look like a con artist or a dolt.

236
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Pricing of banner ads
Banner ad placement costs can be figured on a number of different bases, 
including
 
✓ Flat fee: You get unlimited impressions, clicks, leads, and sales over a 
specified period for a single fee. Sounds great, but be aware that this 
is usually offered only by relatively unsophisticated publishers, and 
the number of those is shrinking rapidly. If you do happen into such an 
arrangement, ask how many impressions and so on that you can expect. 
You may find the deal isn’t actually so great.
 
✓ Cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM): This is the most common 
arrangement. You pay a certain amount for every 1,000 times your ad is 
displayed. So a $5 CPM means you pay $5 for every 1,000 appearances. 
The publisher of the hosting Web site determines the CPM cost based 
on the traffic volume of each of the site’s pages.
 
✓ Cost-per-click (CPC): This is the amount you’re charged every time some-
one clicks your banner ad. A $5 CPC therefore costs $5 for each click.
 
✓ Cost-per-lead (CPL): Also known as cost-per-action (CPA), CPL is usually 
based on the number of Web addresses you’ve gathered from visitors to 
your site — and that you can prove you’ve collected. These are usually 
addresses people have given you to receive an e-newsletter or have fur-
nished as part of filling out an online survey. (People who go further and 
actually buy from your site are also considered leads for CPL purposes.) 
This can be a great way to be billed because you’re paying only for qual-
ity prospects, not just a mass of clicks. However:
 
• CPL rates can vary widely depending on the ad program you sign 
up for.
 
• A lot of publishers don’t offer a CPL arrangement because it 
depends on the conversion power of your landing pages, which is 
something they have no control over.
Choosing the best place for a banner ad
People once believed that the most effective 
place to put a banner ad on a Web site was 
at the top of the page. This is simple common 
sense (or at least it was): People always see 
the top of a page, whereas they rarely see the 
bottom.
Today, however, a new school of thought says 
you should place your ad on the right side of 
the page, preferably in the lower-right corner 
adjacent to the scroll bar. Seems pretty obvi-
ous when you think about it, eh? This is also 
good placement for those businesses on a tight 
budget because this generally means using a 
smaller, less expensive ad.

237
 Chapter 12: Targeting Customers with Banner Ads, E-Newsletter Ads, and More
 
Like so much else in life, banner ad rates are highly negotiable. Don’t hesitate 
to regard a host site’s initial rate or quote as simply a starting point and then 
to counter with a lower, realistic, and reasonable offer. True; some sites may 
treat their prices as ironclad. If that’s the case, either sigh and accept the 
price, or harrumph and take a pass.
Paying to create a banner ad
You have basically three ways to create a banner ad, and of course, each 
entails a different level of effort and expense:
 
✓ Do it yourself (DIY): Several online tools are available to help you con-
struct and place your banner ads, and many are free. These tools give 
you step-by-step instructions that can help you move pretty quickly 
from the Huh? stage to the Hey, Look, It’s Done stage. Some of the most 
popular of these tool suppliers are

If you decide to go the DIY route, make your ad eye-catching, yet simple. 
Don’t let your ad get so ornate that it won’t load. Make sure the links 
work and that the corresponding landing page (see Chapter 5) continues 
the ad’s story in a seamless way.
 
✓ Use a professional graphic artist: Searchable databases, such as 
MarketingScoop.com (www.marketingscoop.com) or Elance (www.
elance.com), can help you find a designer to render your ad in the size 
you need. The cost obviously depends on the complexity of the project, 
and the particular designer, but as the saying goes, you get what you 
pay for.
 
✓ Use an online advertising provider: Services can provide small busi-
nesses with a complete solution. These folks handle banner ad creation 
and placement as well as reporting services. (Many also offer a sort of 
hybrid arrangement in which they provide an appropriate ad template 
that you use to design the ad, while they retain the responsibilities for 
placement and tracking.) The costs here can vary over a pretty wide 
range depending on what you ask the provider to do. If this kind of 
service sounds appealing to you, check out providers like BidPlace SB 
(www.bidplacesb.com) and AdReady (www.adready.com).

Using E-Newsletter Advertising 
and Sponsorships
In this section, we talk about advertising in e-newsletters, not for them. 
Although in terms of execution, these ads are a little different than banner 
ads, their aim is exactly the same: to reach a target audience of readers who 
are already highly engaged with the kind of products or services you offer.
According to Forrester Research, e-newsletter advertising creates a markedly 
higher level of trust among consumers than any other form of interactive 
advertising. Forrester reports that more than 22 percent of readers trust an 
e-newsletter or e-zine to which they’re subscribed versus only 2 percent who 
trust unsolicited e-mail marketing. As a result, e-newsletter ads often produce 
some of the highest conversion rates for local online advertisers.
Like banner ads, e-newsletter advertising is highly targeted and is also usu-
ally very cost-effective. Plus, you can never be accused of spamming because 
e-newsletter recipients have already signed up to get them. Figure 12-3 shows 
an example of an e-newsletter with a sponsored ad spot.

239
 Chapter 12: Targeting Customers with Banner Ads, E-Newsletter Ads, and More
Choosing an e-newsletter for your ad
So many e-newsletters float around, covering so many different topics of 
interest, that it won’t take much effort on your part to find the right one(s) to 
advertise in. As with placing banner ads, look for those e-newsletters that are 
a natural fit for what your business sells. For example:
 
✓ A dog groomer advertises in an e-newsletter published by the local 
ASPCA and offers a free shampoo for any dog or cat that someone 
adopts.
 
✓ A hair salon advertises in an e-newsletter published by a regional wed-
dings Web site and offers the bride-to-be a shampoo, cut, and style when 
all her bridesmaids get their hair done there, too.
Another hidden benefit of advertising in e-newsletters is that almost all are 
archived, and thousands of people actually scour these archives. So, poten-
tially, your ad can be seen by a whole lot of extra people over time — expo-
sures that you never had to pay for. Your ad becomes, in effect, a gift that 
keeps on giving.
Tips for e-newsletter advertisers
To get your e-newsletter advertising running on all cylinders — and produce 
a bunch of interested new leads or even increase the number of opt-ins you 
get for your own e-newsletter — do the following:
 
✓ Target your audience: Research the e-newsletter’s demographic break-
down to make sure you want to reach at least some segments of its 
audience. (The e-newsletter publisher can usually provide you with this 
information, based on the information it gets when people sign up for 
the e-newsletter.) Many publishers let you buy selected segments of 
their audience, so you can target your best prospects without paying for 
exposure to the entire subscriber list. Although this may wind up cost-
ing you more per impression, the specificity you can achieve will result 
in actually paying less per acquisition.
 
✓ Arrange a package deal: Don’t be surprised to discover that multi-ad 
exposures attract more potential customers than single-ad exposures. 
That being true, many e-newsletter publishers offer a package price to 
any business that advertises both in their e-newsletter and via a banner 
ad on their Web site. You may even be able to extend the package to 
include a print ad in the e-newsletter’s companion magazine. This can 
be an extremely cost-effective way to get maximum impact and exposure 
for your business.

240
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Buy with frequency: Because of the multiple exposures principle, recur-
ring ad placement in a given e-newsletter is obviously going to be more 
effective than a one-shot appearance — and these multiple placements 
can usually be had at a discount. If the e-newsletter publishes weekly, 
try buying six weeks in a row or buying at least an every-other-week 
placement. If the e-newsletter is monthly, buy three months in a row, 
and so on. You may well be surprised how much you end up saving per 
placement.
 
✓ Be mindful of your metrics: Publishers often pay close attention to how 
many e-newsletter subscribers they have, and more important, how many 
of those people actually open (and presumably read) the e-newsletters. 
A particular e-newsletter’s once-hot subjects can start to cool off and 
vice versa. Just like the publisher, pay regular attention to the e-news-
letter’s delivery, readership, and bounce rates — and adjust your buy 
accordingly.
E-newsletter sponsorships
You might have the opportunity not just to advertise in an e-newsletter, but 
actually to sponsor one. In return for a fee, you get a certain degree of exclu-
sivity, a preferred placement for your message, and a somewhat more exten-
sive space to communicate your message. Obviously, you also can feature a 
link to your Web site.
Sponsorship ads are sort of like mini-editorials. They usually offer a good 
deal more room for content than any banner ad and consequently, they can 
be terrific relationship-builders between you and your target audience.
If you have the chance to buy a sponsorship, keep these pieces of advice in 
mind:
 
✓ Research your target audience before you start writing your ad. Figure 
out who you’re talking to, what they’re interested in, and what kind of 
voice you should use (that is, should you be blunt and businesslike, 
friendly and warm, concerned and expert, or something else?).
 
✓ Write a short descriptive advertisement that states what your company 
is all about. Include important and compelling information about your 
products or services and how your company can benefit the readers. 
(Obviously, also include your company’s name, logo, phone number, and 
e-mail address.) Even if you’re given more space than what you’ve written 

241
 Chapter 12: Targeting Customers with Banner Ads, E-Newsletter Ads, and More
will actually require, go through the exercise — it will help you boil down 
your message to its essentials, and you can always expand a bit on this 
point or that one before the ad appears in finished form.
 
✓ Don’t forget to include a link to your Web site. This whole exercise is 
kind of pointless if you don’t.
 
You probably want to know how much e-newsletter and sponsorships ads 
cost. And — guess what? — prices vary. But even as they vary, they tend to 
mirror that publisher’s rates for banner ads, which means that you can use 
the banner ad rates of different publishers to get a good idea where each of 
will fall on the e-newsletter and sponsorship price scales. Then again, you 
could just go completely wild and ask the publisher to send you a rate card.
Advertising with Online Classifieds
Like most forms of printed media, the lowly but effective classified ad has 
found its way to the Internet. Unlike its traditional newspaper counterparts, 
however, Internet classifieds aren’t usually billed on a per-line basis. They’re 
also easy for search engines to find and post, they can be localized to a fare-
thee-well (right down to the zip code), and as a general rule, they’re really 
inexpensive.
They’re so inexpensive, in fact, that sites like Craigslist and Kijiji don’t even 
bother to charge for them. What’s more, the content on a classified ad site 
turns over so quickly (as the goods and services offered come and go) that 
they’re never at a loss for an audience.
Don’t get too giddy. Most classified ad sites do charge, at least a little. Still, 
the cost of classifieds is sufficiently low that many local businesses, such as 
the following, gravitate to them naturally as an effective marketing tool:
 
✓ Small (to a-little-bigger-than-small) businesses that offer individual 
services, such as piano teachers, pet sitters, photographers, and auto 
mechanics that specialize in a particular type of car (like, say, classic 
Jaguars), are prime examples of the kinds of folks who often run online 
classifieds.
 
✓ Somewhat larger local businesses, such as community dental practices, 
financial consultancies, and child- and elder-care providers, are discov-
ering that classified ads offer a cost-effective way to build business and 
are taking advantage of that revelation.

Developing a classified advertising plan
To develop a classified advertising plan, follow these steps:
 
1. Find good (preferably free) classified ad sites to post on.
 
 You can find a number of these by simply using a search engine and 
entering a query for free ads, online classifieds, free online classified 
advertising, or some other variation of those terms.
 
2. Compare these sites on Alexa (www.alexa.com).
 
 Alexa can give you a lot of details about a given site, such as how it 
ranks among others of its kind, any other sites that link to it, and even 
other free classified ads sites you can check out. Here are the steps you 
could follow to utilize Alexa rankings:
 
1. Log on to Alexa and enter the name of your domain (URL) in the 
Search text box at the top of the page.
 
2. Click the Site Info tab.
 
 This is where you can find out more about the site’s popularity, 
traffic rank, and other useful information.
 
3. Click the See Complete Stats link at the top of the page.
 
 Here you can find how many pages are viewed in the Web site and 
the general trend of traffic.
 
4. Click the Related Links tab at the top of the page to view the 
competition.
 
 From here you can also research competitive site information.
 
5. Click the Sites Linked In icon to discover which major Web sites 
people are using to find the site.
You can always use the old standby technique: Visit any of these sites. See 
what kinds of businesses are represented and ask, “Is this a good place for 
me to be?” See Figures 12-4 and 12-5 for examples of classified ad sites.
Some of the leading classified ad sites today are
 
✓ Craigslist: www.craigslist.org
 
✓ Oodle: www.oodle.com
 
✓ Kijiji: www.kijiji.com
 
✓ OLX: www.olx.com
 
✓ Backpage.com: www.backpage.com

Creating a classified ad with clout
After you pinpoint the proper Web sites for your classified ad, follow these 
guidelines to create your classified ad:
 
✓ Tweak your ad presentation: Use an attention-grabbing headline, along 
with some arresting images. (Many classified ad sites allow graphics.) 
Eye-tracking studies show that text located near an image gathers 90 
percent of the average reader’s attention for the critical first few sec-
onds. Your copy and image(s) need to work together and strike a nice 
visual balance. Also, capitalize only the first letter of each keyword in 
the headline, and keep it to ten words or less.
 
✓ Include info in the body of your ad: Include the most important — and 
only the most important — information about your product or service. 
Your objective here is to capture the reader and send him to your Web 
site where you can convert him into a lead, or better yet, a paying cus-
tomer. Because of that, your goal is to create both interest and action. 
Make sure each sentence has a definite purpose and contains the key-
words you think people would be likely to submit to a search engine.
 
✓ Use your visual assets: If you have a digital camera, use it. Take photos 
of your products or of your services in action. And speaking of action, 
a lot of classified Web sites allow you to include video clips as well. Be 
sure to use your ad title (usually the headline) as the filename for your 
photos and video clips. More and more people are becoming aware that 
they can now search for images and videos, so a descriptive image title 
makes yours easy for them to find.
 
✓ Read the site’s guidelines: The classified Web site probably offers its 
own tips on creating an effective ad, and because they’re in the busi-
ness, those tips are likely to be highly useful. The site probably also 
has its own set of rules, which you need to follow in order have your ad 
accepted.
 
✓ Choose the correct category: Carefully figure out which of the available 
ad categories is the best fit for your particular classified and base that 
decision on where you think readers would be most likely to look for 
whatever it is you’re offering. Some classified ad sites let you place your 
ad in more than one category, which is obviously beneficial for all the 
parties involved.
 
✓ Be stingy with capitalization: The general rule with capitals is that 
they’re okay as initial caps in your headline, but shy away from using 
them in the body copy. Capitalizing whole sentences of text is a bad 
practice.
 
✓ Stress the features and benefits of your product/service: This classified 
may be your only chance to catch and interest the people you reach, so 
make sure your copy is about exactly what it is your product or service 

245
 Chapter 12: Targeting Customers with Banner Ads, E-Newsletter Ads, and More
does, and how exactly it benefits them. Put yourself in their shoes, and 
ask the time-honored question: What’s in it for me?
 
✓ Prompt the reader: Entice, nudge, or otherwise propel the reader into 
taking the next step, which in this case, means getting her to visit your 
Web site, where the real selling can begin. Try to create a sense of 
urgency, which can often be accomplished with language like Limited-
Time Offer, Available Only until Midnight Tomorrow, or even just Visit 
Our Site Today!
 
✓ Proofread your ad: No doubt you can make up your own hypothetical 
horror story here. A good way to avoid embarrassing typos is to have 
someone else read your copy before you submit it. (Authors have a way 
of not spotting their own mistakes, especially if they’ve already read the 
text a few dozen times.) A fresh reader can also alert you to something 
in your copy that doesn’t make sense or that just sounds weird. For this 
exercise at least, when someone else points out something wrong or 
odd, check your ego at the door.
When you’ve done all these fun things, you’re ready to submit your classified 
ad. Some classified sites post your ad immediately. Others confirm the ad 
with you, and may consequently need a day or two after submission to post 
it on their sites.
Choosing the Right Venue for Your Ad
Deciding whether to use banners, an e-newsletter or sponsorship ad, or a 
classified ad is largely a matter of common sense:
 
✓ Consider the nature of your industry and assess any credibility issues 
that might arise. A cosmetic surgeon, for example, may conclude — 
rightly — that running classified ads will make her practice look tacky 
and cheap, whereas that same placement may be just perfect for a pet 
sitter or a piano teacher. Conversely, a pet sitter who runs a splashy 
banner ad may look a little too slick to be fully trusted. Ad placement is 
a sterling example of the classic axiom, “The medium is the message.”
 
✓ Consider what advertising opportunities are open realistically to you. 
Running a banner ad of any appreciable size on a particular host site 
may be beyond your financial reach, but that doesn’t mean running a 
considerably less expensive e-newsletter ad on the same site is out of 
the question. After all, you’ll be reaching pretty much the same audience 
while saving some significant expense. Then again, a dental practice or 
some other big-ticket service provider may have both the resources and 
the desire to use a large banner ad to promote its capabilities and to 
establish its brand.

Testing Your Ads for Fun and Profit
Finding out how well your online advertising is actually performing in the real 
world is really pretty interesting — not to mention sound business practice. 
Happily, and like just about every other online marketing tactic we discuss in 
this book, your banner, e-newsletter, sponsorship, and classified ads can be 
tested easily. As with the others, you can easily and quickly dump the ones 
that aren’t working and continue enhancing the ones that are.
But what do you need to test? That’s simple: Everything — the formats, 
placements, headlines, copy, images, and offers. For instance:
 
✓ If your banner ad isn’t generating the kind or number of leads you’d 
hoped for, try running it on a different Web site (or two) with the 
same demographic. If that proves disappointing as well, consider test-
ing a new message, a new offer, or even a different format altogether.
 
✓ Make the most of the testing opportunities that e-newsletter ads pro-
vide. Test a message or offer one week and then test a different one the 
next. Pick the best performing of those (based on click-throughs and/or 
lead quality) to run for the balance of your scheduled buy.
 
✓ Customize your message to the particular site or publication you’re 
advertising on to see whether fine-tuning lifts your results. If the 
answer is yes, chances are you’re really engaging your audience, so stick 
with it.
As the great author C.S. Lewis once pointed out, progress isn’t just a matter 
of moving forward in a given direction; it can also mean realizing you’re 
headed down the wrong path and turning around.
Test, take stock, refine, and try again. Doing so doesn’t really take much 
effort — only a genuine desire to succeed. (And we’re guessing you already 
have that in spades.)

Hanging Out on Social Networks
In This Chapter
▶ Using social networks to interact with consumers
▶ Understanding Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn
▶ Business building with Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube
▶ Finding the niche network that’s right for you
S
ocial creatures that we are, human beings have been networking since 
the dawn of civilization. Now, we have Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, 
YouTube, and Flickr. Social networks are Web sites where users submit (and 
share publicly) content such as news, photos, videos, and audio clips as well 
as post their personal comments on everything imaginable. The only rules 
are that the contributions be personable, respectful, and constructive.
As the number of these networks grows, and their services and tools and 
capabilities expand, they’re steadily revealing themselves to be viable mar-
keting channels for local businesses. Keep in mind, however, that marketing 
that fits in social networks doesn’t look or feel like the marketing most of us 
are used to. And because the whole social network phenomenon is so new, 
the rules are still being written as to how and when the networks are best 
used.
This chapter gives you a snapshot of where the social media stand at the 
moment and how to use them to boost your business. Just remember that 
things keep changing on a regular basis.
Joining In: The Social Networking 
Phenomenon
The goal of stepping into the world of social media is to place yourself right in 
the midst of people who are likely to become your customers. Unlike a lot of 
online marketing tactics — tactics where you’re essentially speaking at your 
target audience — social networks put you into an ongoing conversation with 

248
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
your prospects. And, like any good conversation, this one involves people 
engaging with one another as individuals. You use the social networks to pres-
ent yourself as a business owner with a name and a face and a personality.
In a sense, social networks replace the closely knit communities of yester-
year, when people in a town or neighborhood traded news or gossip or sad 
or funny stories. And when they did business, they did it with someone — 
not something — they knew personally. From friendship comes trust, and 
from trust comes business.
An excellent place for 
non-advertising advertising
It’s long been a sort of unwritten rule of marketing that where there’s a 
crowd, there’s opportunity. And the social networks represent (if nothing 
else) a humongous crowd. So if there’s so much opportunity here, how can a 
business (local or otherwise) capitalize on it?
Happily for us, the networks have been around just long enough for certain 
behavioral rules of the road to have been established where advertising is 
concerned. And the foremost of these seems to be: “I don’t mind you selling 
to me as long as you don’t appear to be selling to me.” What it means is that 
folks who frequent the social networks are interested in dealing with people 
as people. They want to be on a first-name basis with one another, and they 
want to interact with people they like and people they trust.
In that type of environment, then, there’s a kind of healthy mistrust of anyone 
who comes across too loud, too pushy, and particularly, too sell-y. So, yes, 
your local business can find a welcoming audience here as long as you’re 
willing to relax, be personable, speak softly, and leave your big marketing 
stick at home.
 
Consumers use networking sites to get social proof from others that a move 
they’re about to make is a good one. They ask for comments and advice from 
their fellow networkers, and they put great stock in any review that may touch 
on a product or service (or product or service provider).
What you get out of it
Social media can be useful for almost any kind of local business in any kind 
of category. It just takes a little imagination and a rounded teaspoon of 
restraint. For instance, a café owner who talks about some new recipe he just 
concocted after hours of trial and error sends the implicit message, “I take 
real care in preparing the food I offer.” A local attorney who’s relaxing a bit 
now that she’s just helped a client successfully manage a complex tax matter 

249
 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
says, “I prevail in tough cases.” A local locksmith who shares an anecdote 
about being called out in the middle of the night to help someone get into his 
house is saying, “You can count on me for help, no matter what the hour.”
Approaching your audience this way can carry a lot of benefits:
 
✓ By presenting yourself as a person first and a business person second, 
you help allay skepticism among your fellow networkers.
 
✓ You can sprinkle in a lot of relevant, good-quality links to your Web site 
that search engines will spot and reward you for. We talk about how to 
add links to your site on your social network profiles later in this chap-
ter where we discuss setting up profiles for each of the various social 
networks.
 
✓ You forge relationships, not just with potential customers, but with 
those other people in the social network whose opinions matter to their 
peers (a tactic often referred to as indirect sales).
 
✓ You can build your business’ reputation as an authority in your field: 
someone to whom people can confidently turn for guidance and advice.
 
✓ You can generate direct sales.
 
As if they’re not a helpful-enough tool, social media are also free. All it takes 
to become a player in this online universe is the investment of a little time to 
learn the ropes. Your first step will take a couple of hours. Fire up your com-
puter and sign up. (You can’t get in without joining, although joining is usu-
ally as simple as entering your name and e-mail address.) Then look around; 
experience the site as a user and observe how others are using it. It shouldn’t 
take you long to assess just how that particular site could help attract busi-
ness. Obviously, some social sites are ripe with opportunity more than others, 
but keep looking. Eventually, you’ll arrive at a manageable group of useful net-
works that will form the hub of your social media efforts.
Wooing the search engines
We mention earlier that social sites are great places for presenting links to 
your own Web site: links that search engines will spot. A smart business 
owner (such as yourself) optimizes social media content around the key-
words that you already chose in your general search engine–optimization 
efforts.
This tactic will obviously help you get higher rankings in search engines’ 
organic listings, but there’s another benefit in that many social sites offer 
their own search functions. Someone who enters one or more of the your 
keywords is likely to find you ranked very high on the page that comes up — 
even higher, in most cases, than you’d appear on a generic search engine’s 
pages. In other words, you’re getting a two-fer.

Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Sharing Information about Your Business
In traditional advertising, you pay to run an ad. On social networks, though 
(except for the occasional pay-per-click ad), you don’t. In traditional adver-
tising, you focus on something that’s good for the prospective customer. In 
social network marketing, you present something that’s good for the commu-
nity. In traditional advertising, self-serving is at the heart of your sales efforts. 
In social marketing, it’s the kiss of death. See what we mean?
What it comes down to is engaging the community’s members on a personal 
level and giving them a reason to listen to you. Your posts to the site can 
offer your occasional opinions on this or that. Share links to informative Web 
sites and blogs. Offer suggestions when someone has a problem that touches 
on your area of expertise. Expect to receive comments back, too. They might 
be reviews of your business. Keep in mind that even a negative review can be 
helpful because it can help you correct and improve your operation.
 
When you’re on a social network hoping to market your local business, you 
should communicate, not sell. Here’s a good way to think about it. When you 
get home from work and tell your spouse what went on that day, you’re not 
trying to get your spouse’s business. You’re simply sharing interesting tidbits 
about the day’s events, and maybe tossing in your own pithy comments about 
it all. That’s the model for posting on a social network.
Deciding what to share
Trust us, you’ll come up with something that will play well on Facebook, 
YouTube, or whichever of the social sites offers the best audience. For 
instance
 
✓ Share news and information. Social networks are hotbeds of word-of-
mouth communication, and news travels fast. Have you made a new hire 
at your high-end salon, started offering a new service at your medical 
spa, opened a new location of your gym?
 
 Don’t overdo it. Post regularly about a variety of things. That way, when 
you do get around to dropping in some business news, people won’t 
think you’re just a spammer or some other lowlife. They’ll already know 
you as a regular person, one who today just happens to have a little 
news about his own business to impart.
 
✓ Share your expertise. Look for ongoing topics of conversation that you 
can comment on as a voice of authority. Don’t push it and come on all 
high and mighty. Just pretend your neighbor or friend is asking you, and 
respond as a good neighbor would.

251
 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
 
✓ Create and share incentives. Say you’re a pet store owner and you’re 
introducing a Red Cross–sponsored Dog Safety Course. You can publish 
the news to your Facebook or MySpace fan base and include a link to the 
page on your Web site where they can learn more and maybe download 
a coupon that gives them a discount when they register online for the 
safety course. It’s really no different than the kind of incentive you’d 
offer in your regular online and offline marketing efforts. Just remember 
that because you’re among friends, a light touch is key.
 
✓ Make and share videos. Short, how-to videos are always attention-
getters, as are tour videos that walk the viewer through your restaurant, 
building projects, or showroom. You might already have some of these 
on your Web site. Great. You can repurpose them for the social media, 
and YouTube is an obvious place to start.
 
✓ Take and share photos. Flickr in particular has amazingly active photo 
groups, so pictures of your products, operation, and so on, are a natu-
ral fit. For example, Flickr is home to dozens of animal-related groups, 
each of which can be counted on to have hundreds, even thousands, of 
members. So if you’re a pet store owner, put up a couple photos of your 
store, your tropical fish department, your grooming facilities. Similarly, 
a builder could post pictures of his finished homes in an appropriate 
city-related group, say the greater San Francisco Bay area.
Marketing tips and tricks 
for social networks
Here are a few hints on how to comfortably fit yourself on social networks:
 
✓ If you find all this social media stuff a little off-putting, the odds are 
excellent that someone you work or socialize with is already an avid 
member of one or more of the networks. Let that person be your guide 
and show you what a particular site is about and how it works.
 
✓ When you start wandering about a given social site, it shouldn’t take you 
long to get a feel for what its population is all about. Are these folks in 
your local area? Are they a good target audience for you? A quick way 
to find out is to use the site’s search tool. Most of the sites keep their 
members’ profiles (including location) organized in some way or other, 
so zeroing in on the kind of members you’re looking for is pretty easy.
 
✓ When you join a network, you’re asked to create your own profile. Keep 
it short, concise, and interesting. It can be a personal bio or a brief bio 
of your company. Whatever it is, think before you write: Is the profile 
you’re submitting likely to catch local people’s attention? And remember 
that, online, first impressions are made very quickly.

252
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ After you join a network, contribute. It’s okay to lurk for a brief time just 
to absorb the ins and outs of the environment, but then dive into the 
conversation. After all, that’s what you’re there for.
 
✓ Test, measure, learn, and adjust your networking approaches. The brass 
ring here is to move online conversations offline. Is your social media 
persona accomplishing that? Is there some way it can do the job even 
better? You know the drill: Measure your results and fix whatever you 
think might be broken.
Putting Your Best Facebook Forward
Facebook started out as a way for college students to get to know each other, 
but wow! has it ever grown. Today it’s a hugely populated place for people to 
network on both a personal and professional level. See Figure 13-1.
What on earth are all these people doing here? Well, colleagues update one 
another on business stuff. People you went to high school with (and have 
long since forgotten) contact you and ask what you’re up to these days. 
Goofy questions are asked, and surveys are taken (“Who’s your least favorite 
movie star?” “Was building the Panama Canal a good idea? Discuss.”) People 
look for help with their dating problems, recipes for their company picnic, 
ideas for what they dress as for Halloween, advice on how to gently let a 
troublesome salesperson go. The fun, as they say, never stops.

253
 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
But is it right for your local business? Probably. Facebook currently has vast 
demographic appeal, particularly for people 25 and older, so it’s a natural for 
almost any kind of business to be on as well.
 
If you’re not really, really careful, you could find that being on Facebook is 
actually oodles of fun — so keep focused on what brought you there in the 
first place: to drum up customers for your local business. The key to that is 
building trust.
Creating your profile
To sign up for Facebook, go to www.facebook.com, fill in the First Name, 
Last Name, Your Email, and Password text boxes, select your gender and 
birthday from the drop-down lists, and click the Sign Up button. Then to 
build your profile, upload a photo, enter your education, business, and 
contact information, and join your local sub-network (Schenectady NY, 
Cincinnati OH, or whatever). The more complete your profile, the more 
easily — and more comprehensively — you can connect with people and 
start building your own growing network of friends.
 
If you’re concerned about privacy, Facebook offers highly customizable pri-
vacy settings that let you control who can and can’t see different elements of 
your profile. So, for example, you can share photos of your kids with friends 
and family but prevent the pictures from being seen by your employees or 
customers.
Next, you can upload your existing contact database to see which of your 
contacts are already on Facebook and ask whichever ones you want to 
become your friend. This can get you started right off the bat rather than 
leaving you to start cold in building your own little community.
Creating your company page
After you have a personal profile, you can create a Fan page for your local 
business. You can populate the page(s) with company information, news 
about upcoming events, photos, videos, discussion forums, and links to your 
business Web site. You can also add applications that increase the function-
ality of your page (such as an RSS feed to your blog or a link to the news page 
on your Web site), or embed videos from YouTube. Your page or pages are 
made publicly available, which means that search engines can find and index 
them — an added benefit. A sample business page is shown in Figure 13-2.

254

Figure 13-2: 
A Facebook 
business 
page.
 
If you’re wondering why you need a Facebook company page when you already 
have a business Web site, you want to be where your existing and prospective 
customers are. In other words, it’s about location, location, location.
Joining and creating groups
Another great way to network on Facebook is through the use of groups. 
Unlike the site’s fan pages, which can be viewed by the general public, groups 
are visible only to Facebook members, and can be formed around any subject 
from business type to political affiliations to love of a particular kind of plant 
or breed of dog.
It shouldn’t take you long to find a group or groups that are likely to include 
good prospects for your local business, but if you can’t, no problem: Simply 
start a new group yourself, and get the ball rolling by inviting some friends 
and fans to join it.
Or you can use the handy feature that lets you bulk-invite people who are 
already connected to you on the network to join your group. They can then 
bulk-invite their friends to join as well. With any luck, your membership rolls 
will fill up fast.

255
 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
Building relationships
Say you meet someone at a cocktail party. One thing leads to another, and he 
says, “You know, I’ve got a gizmonometer that I can’t get to work.” You volun-
teer to help him out because you know those gizmonometers can be trouble. 
He says he’ll call you next week. Sure enough, he calls — and you’ve got a 
new customer for your business.
It’s the same with Facebook and the other networking sites. You engage users 
as individuals, and often before you know it, you find out they need some-
thing you can provide.
Of course, you can force the issue a little bit by posting a special offer to 
your fan base, something like, “It’s a great time to show someone you care. 
This week, I’m offering a dozen roses for $8 to my Facebook friends. Let me 
know if you’re interested.” That still doesn’t cross the line, we’d say. It’s just 
friends being friendly. And the fact that you pick up some business along the 
way is just the happy and gratifying way it worked out.
 
Here’s the nasty flipside. There’s always someone who comes on waaaay too 
strong and tries to sell you something as soon as you tell him your name. 
Don’t do that. People who are obviously jumping into social media just to 
make a quick buck are likely to get found out, called out, and shut out. And the 
only thing they wind up accomplishing is putting a dent in their reputation.
Facebook lets you welcome a whole bunch of friends aboard. The more 
friends you have — and the better your friends get to know you — the better 
your chances are of converting some into prospects, then into customers, 
without in any way diminishing the relationship.
Schmoozing your Facebook business fans
Facebook gives you a lot of ways to get your 
business noticed and, ultimately, patronized. 
Pre-built tools let you plug in an offer, a sign-up 
page for your newsletter, a path to the discus-
sion board you host, and on and on. You can 
also add some neat, Facebook-supplied appli-
cations from outside developers to customize 
your business page. For instance
 ✓ A restaurant might add the Reservations 
application to let users book a table online.
 ✓ An independent movie theatre might add 
the Movie Times & Tickets application so 
users can preview what’s currently show-
ing, and even buy tickets in advance.
 ✓ A local business owner can add the Visa 
Business Network application to cast a 
wider social net.
And that just scratches the surface.
Facebook also offers an excellent ad target-
ing tool that lets you submit all sorts of search

Making MySpace Your Space
MySpace started life as an online place for teens and 20-somethings to hang 
out and socialize. MySpace was once the be-all and end-all of the social net-
working movement. Since then, though, Facebook, Twitter, and the other net-
works have stolen a good bit of its thunder, and its market share has shrunk 
accordingly.
However, as the network market in general continues to expand, even a 
diminished share can become a big and fast-growing one, and MySpace’s 
share has been doing just that.
Taking advantage of MySpace strengths
Initially, MySpace’s user base centered on people younger than 35: college 
students, younger career-types, and so on. In recent years, the MySpace 
crowd has been expanding to include plenty of people over 35.
One thing hasn’t changed even as the demographics have, though: MySpace 
has always been mostly about pop culture. Bands, movies, food, fashion, 
celebrity comings and goings — they’ve long been and continue to be the 
primary grist for the MySpace mill. This makes MySpace a great place to be 
for local businesses that cater to just those sorts of interests: entertainment, 
dining, lifestyle, travel, music, and the rest.
In March 2009, MySpace announced a partnership with Citysearch, the 
local review site, to create MySpace Local. This means that Citysearch busi-
ness listings from 1,000 U.S. cities will come under the MySpace umbrella. 
As this book is being written, the full details of the new entity haven’t been 
announced, but it certainly bears watching by any local business contemplat-
ing a move into social network marketing.
criteria and narrow down its vast user base to 
the group of people you most want to reach 
and attract to your business page. This par-
ticular resource, however, isn’t free; you pay 
for it on a pay-per-click basis.
When you accumulate 1,000 fans, you’re 
entitled to a brand URL. This will be www.
facebook.com/yourbusinessname, 
which is a very cool and easy way to enhance 
your marketing efforts.

 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
Setting up your profile
Setting up a MySpace profile for yourself and your business is extremely 
easy. (Figure 13-3 shows the layout of a typical MySpace business page.)
 
Figure 13-3: 
A MySpace 
business 
page.
 
Go to www.myspace.com and click the Sign Up link. In the sign up process, 
you’re asked to fill in the following information:
 
✓ The Basic Info: This part of the process is a little weird in that when 
you’re setting up a business profile, MySpace asks for its gender, marital 
status, and astrological sign. See? Weird. Anyway, just fill in your own 
data, and leave it at that.
 
✓ Your name and URL: When choosing a name and URL (www.myspace.
com/yoursite), you have two options. You can choose the name of 
your business (such as www.myspace.com/barkingboutique) or use 
keywords that describe what you offer (such as www.myspace.com/
petgrooming). It’s your choice, but a keyword-rich name will often be 
the better way to go.
 
✓ Company Overview: The About Me section: This is essentially the 
bread and butter of your MySpace page. It’s where you provide a con-
cise overview of your company and the ways it can benefit your target 
audience. And just because you have to keep it brief doesn’t mean you 
can’t be creative to grab your target’s interest. Remember that ironclad 
rule of marketing: Tell your prospective customers what’s in it for them.

258
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
✓ Potential Clients: The Who I’d Like to Meet section: Here’s where you 
sharpen the definition of your target audience. It’s helpful to ask your-
self, if your product had a mind of its own, who would it like to meet? 
Water skis would want to meet water sports enthusiasts. High-end col-
lars for dogs would want to shake hands with the owners of pampered 
pets. And so on. We know it sounds a little strange, but it can help you 
clarify exactly who your prime targets are.
 
✓ Adding Pictures and Video sections: If you don’t provide an image for 
your profile, you get a default No Photo icon, which isn’t the best way 
to win friends and influence people. If you’re building a personal profile, 
it should obviously be a picture of you. If it’s a business profile, you 
should probably insert your logo or some other unmistakable signal of 
what your business does (such as a mousetrap for an exterminator).
 
 In the View My Pix section, you can put up additional images, which 
can be a good way to present pictures of your staff, your location(s), 
before-and-after photos, and so on. You can include videos in the Videos 
section that demonstrate your business’ strengths and will, hopefully, 
generate some valuable word-of-mouth.
 
✓ Your MySpace Blog: As discussed in Chapter 14, blogs are as big in 
their own right as social networks are. Blogs offer you an informative, 
personal, and entertaining way to provide readers with information 
about your business. This can include company news, users’ experience 
with your products or services, and so on. Perhaps best of all, the titles 
of your blog posts act as links, so making those titles keyword-rich will 
help you get noticed by search engines.
 
✓ Making Friends: The Friend Space section: While you can try a basic 
MySpace Search to find individuals who may be interested in your busi-
ness, your best chance of finding the type of consumers you want is 
searching MySpace Groups. In either case, you then send that person 
a Friend Request. Most people check out your page before deciding 
whether to accept your invitation. Your odds of success will increase if 
you send a personalized message along with your Friend Request (on 
the order of “Hi Sheila. I saw that you’re interested in masonry, and 
that’s my profession. Maybe we should be friends?”)
 
✓ Posting Bulletins and Sending Messages: A Bulletin Post is a terrific 
way to communicate (or message, in MySpace-speak) all your friends 
at once. Give them something they’re likely to be interested in reading, 
such as new product offerings, news related to your products or busi-
ness, special offers, and so on. Keep your message short. Of course, you 
can also message your friends individually, which you want to do as you 
sense someone is becoming increasingly interested in what you sell.
 
✓ Posting Comments: This can be another effective way to build your cli-
entele. Seek out pages that touch on your type of business and that fea-
ture active discussion groups. Post a comment occasionally (but don’t 
do it too often, or you’ll look too aggressive). For example, say you own

 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
a local public golf course. You find a discussion board on a popular golf-
oriented page. Your comment (in a relevant discussion) could be “Check 
out my blog for tips on choosing a good public course in the area.” It’s 
nothing more than what a real-world friend would do for another.
Getting LinkedIn
It was inevitable that business people would find a way to extend their net-
working efforts to the online world as well. And, sure enough, along came 
LinkedIn. LinkedIn gives small (and large) business owners a pretty painless 
way to increase their customer base and enhance their bottom line.
The site’s mission is to help professionals and businesses make better use of 
a professional network, to connect professionals to make them more produc-
tive and successful.
User demographic data shows that LinkedIn caters to a slightly more afflu-
ent, more male-centric audience than Facebook and MySpace. Many users are 
decision makers for their businesses.
Many local businesses that offer professional services — doctors, attorneys, 
financial consultants, and the like — find LinkedIn a useful place to be. A lot 
of professionals also use LinkedIn to find new jobs, ask for advice from peers, 
scout out potential new hires, and so on. Even if you’re not looking to the site 
to market your business, you may still find it a highly useful network to be 
part of.
Establishing a LinkedIn account
Assuming that your target audience fits the LinkedIn mold, setting up an 
account on the site for your business and yourself as a business person is 
easy. (We stress the business person part because this is not a socially ori-
ented place for personal chitchat.) Go to www.linkedin.com, fill in the First 
Name, Last Name, Email, and Password text boxes, and then click the Join 
Now button.
Like with Facebook and MySpace, you can create a professional profile or 
business page that can be viewed by the membership. To keep all your 
opportunities open, you’re best off creating both.
Unlike the social sites, however, LinkedIn does charge a nominal membership 
fee (on the order of $25–$50 per month for premium services) although you 
can use the basic level for free. About 95 percent of LinkedIn’s membership 
find that’s really all they need.

Using LinkedIn tools and features
Among the more widely used tools and features of LinkedIn are
 
✓ Recommendations: Part of your profile can — and, over time, should — 
include recommendations of your business made by other members. If 
you haven’t accumulated any of these, LinkedIn users might well conclude 
that your business has some kind of competitive or credibility problem, 
so acquiring recommendations should definitely be one of your goals. The 
best way to get them is to give them. Choose people in your network with 
whom you’ve worked, and write an honest statement that recommends 
them. (If, on the other hand, your experience with some of these folks has 
been lousy, don’t fudge a positive statement. It’s best in that case to just 
stay mum.) After you submit some recommendations, don’t be surprised 
to find yourself receiving some in return.
 
✓ Question & Answer function: Jump into a discussion and answer other 
users’ questions in a thoughtful and professional manner, demonstrating 
your expertise and potentially generating contacts who are impressed 
by your knowledge. It bears repeating, however: Your comments/
answers need to be thoughtful and definitely not oversell-y. Remember 
that these are business people, so don’t go overboard in bragging about 
yourself. LinkedIn rewards good answers (and good questions) through 
a rating system; the better your rating, the better the chances that 
LinkedIn will give you some added exposure.
 
✓ Group Discussion: Any member can launch a group on LinkedIn and 
lead discussions on a specific topic of interest. Just make sure that the 
topic under discussion is one that you really know cold. Putting some 
effort into starting and leading a one of these niche groups can gain 
you added influence within your network. Groups are also open to the 
LinkedIn universe as a whole, which can only help you expand your 
network.
 
✓ Informational Content: Members of the larger LinkedIn community, and 
even of your own network, may only come in contact with you and your 
business on the LinkedIn platform, so it’s important to enhance your 
profile with educational information that already resides on your Web 
site. LinkedIn has collected some third-party applications that can help 
you out in this regard:
 
• Box.net: Allows you to create links to files on your site, such as 
resumés and sales/marketing kits
 
• SlideShare: Embeds slideshow presentations and demos
 
• Blog Link: Displays the latest blog posts from your Web site on 
your LinkedIn profile
 
• Company Buzz: Searches Twitter (discussed later in this chapter) 
for mentions of your brand or of other topics you select

Exploring Some Other Networking Sites
Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn are the leaders in today’s social media 
space, but they’re not the only players. Some other social networking sites 
are more narrowly focused and are quite successful in their own right. These 
include Twitter (for news sharing), Flickr (photo sharing), and YouTube 
(video sharing). And they can definitely play a part in building your business.
Tweeting with Twitter
Seemingly growing in popularity every day, Twitter connects businesses with 
consumers. (It also connects a lot of regular folks with each other.) Go to 
www.twitter.com to create your username and password. An example of a 
business Twitter account is shown in Figure 13-4.
 
Figure 13-4: 
All sorts of 
business 
use Twitter.
 
Twitter connections occur in real-time via the Web, a desktop application, or 
mobile devices. The messages themselves — tweets — are limited to a maxi-
mum of 140 characters, including spaces. That limitation doesn’t allow much 
space for news, but a lot of local businesses make it work.

262
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
The most important thing about Twitter is its immediacy. You type in your 
message, and off it flies. Businesses can communicate with their consum-
ers at light speed, and this kind of quick response can create loyal, lifelong 
customers. You can think of Twitter as your own personal press room, with 
news bulletins flashed instantly to interested parties.
For example
 
✓ A nail salon tweets a special, today-only deal on nail polish.
 
✓ An Italian restaurant tweets info about its Tuesday night off-menu pasta 
dishes.
 
✓ A store tweets that it’s closed because of weather, thus sparing custom-
ers a wasted trip.
 
✓ A local company tweets news of its grand opening of a new location for 
several days leading up to the event.
Any tweet can also provide a link to your Web site, but be advised that your 
URL counts against the 140-character limit. A great workaround for this limit 
is to use a URL shortener service, such as bit.ly or ow.ly.
 
Twitter supports a variety of functions to help local businesses, including 
letting you send out product update previews, deliver customer service, 
announce contests, present market research, offer promotional and other spe-
cial discounts, and more. It’s definitely worth taking a look at.
Sharing photos on Flickr
Photo-sharing sites have been popping up at a mind-boggling rate. Some of 
the biggest ones are Google’s Picasa, Smugmug, Zooomr, Photobucket, and 
Flickr, which seems to have the greatest similarity to other social media.
Flickr was also one of the very first social photo-sharing sites, having started 
in 2004. It lets you upload your photos, tag them with descriptive titles, sort 
them by groups, and add them to public pools, where they’re showcased for 
viewers interested in a certain subject, style, or genre. There’s no cost for a 
basic account, which allows you to upload two videos and up to 100MB of 
photos per month.
To create an account, go to www.flickr.com, and click the Create Your 
Account button. If you already have a Yahoo! username and password, enter 
them in the Yahoo! ID and Password text boxes. (If you don’t, you’ll need to 
sign up.)

263
 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
Flickr and similar sites can be used in any number of ways to promote your 
business. The owner of a catering business can use Flickr to showcase her 
services by posting photos of her clients’ weddings, banquets, and other 
fancy events. Real estate agents can post shots of their current house list-
ings. Jewelry makers and other craftspeople can use photo-sharing to create 
an online portfolio, document their creation process, even get consumer 
feedback on new designs. (Of course, you can use Flickr to upload and orga-
nize personal pictures to share them with close friends and family members.)
However you use it, Flickr is an extremely friendly place to begin your social 
media experience. The people in the Flickr community are generally very 
supportive and collegial, plus there are lots of FAQs that come in handy for 
newbies and oldbies alike. There’s even a site tour available to help you get 
started.
Sharing videos on YouTube
So there was little ol’ YouTube just sitting around, a fairly modest little place 
where people (many of them college kids) could watch entertaining video 
clips of this and that submitted by other people just like them. Better yet, 
the clips could be blasted out worldwide in no time flat. The simple inter-
face made YouTube easy to use. There had never been anything quite like it 
before. It was a whole lot of fun. And, not long after its launch in 2005, it had 
become a prominent part of Internet culture. All of which swiftly brought 
it to the attention of Google, who then snapped it up (for a lot of cash) and 
quickly turned it into a household name. Today, YouTube might just as well 
be called HugeTube.
Like with any good Internet-oriented idea, YouTube now has its competitors, 
notably DropShots, Panjea, Viddler, Vimeo, and VideoEgg. They are all similar 
to photo-sharing sites in that they let you upload, tag, and categorize your 
videos.
Some of these sites also allow you to edit your videos after you upload them, 
which means you can shorten the piece and add music and titles if you want. 
Oddly, YouTube doesn’t give you this capability. Rather, YouTube seems to 
want to host videos in all their un-slick glory, apparently on the theory that 
it’s exactly the homeliness of some clips that makes them viewer favorites 
and turns them into viral videos.
Going viral (when a message or image spreads quickly around the Internet) 
is all the rage in Web marketing these days. And why not? It’s virtually effort-
less. People just love calling up video-sharing sites to see what the current 
most-viewed ones are or to use the site’s search utilities to find specific 
videos. YouTube videos also show up in the results pages of the major 
search engines, which can do wonders for your business’ online visibility.

264
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
So how can all of this help your local business? Well, the most obvious way 
to put YouTube and its brethren to work for you is to upload videos that 
clearly demonstrate the product or service you offer. Product demos, how-to 
videos, customer testimonials: They’re all fair game and excellent subjects 
for these sites.
The goal is to present something about your business that engages viewers 
and separates you from your competitors. Your video doesn’t have to be 
funny or dramatic. It doesn’t have to feature dancing camels. As long as you 
make it interesting to at least some segment of the video-sharing population, 
your submission will get noticed, then likely passed along from one user to 
another with a “take a look at this!” message attached.
Finally, the video-sharing sites are as easy to join as Flickr and Twitter. You 
simply go to www.youtube.com and select a username and password. That’s it.
 
To get the absolute most out of video sharing in the way of additional search 
engine optimization benefit (so that people in your area will find your videos 
on the search engines), make sure that the descriptions and titles you give 
your videos include your chosen keywords. This will allow them to be prop-
erly indexed by search engines and will target the right audience. You can 
also help search engines by tagging your location on your YouTube profile 
and uploading transcripts of your videos so that search engines know what 
they’re about (unlike kids these days, search engines can read but don’t watch 
videos).
Using Social Media Specific 
to Your Business Segment
It probably won’t surprise you to find out that social media are becoming 
devoted to particular market niches. (It’s similar to cable TV, where 600 
channels means there’s bound to be something of interest to everyone.) This 
segmentation is good news for businesses because the more sharply targeted 
the audience, the better the return on investment is likely to be.
For example, if a company wants to market custom orthotics to people with 
back problems, would it make more sense to advertise to legions of people 
on Facebook or MySpace, or to aim at a smaller group of people on a site like 
DailyStrength (www.dailystrength.org), with its 500+ groups dealing with 
health and medical issues?

265
 Chapter 13: Hanging Out on Social Networks
Your challenge, then, is to search for those niche social media that best sync 
up with your product or service offering. And, as usual, the best way to do 
that is by using Google (or Yahoo! or Bing), as well as by going to Ning (www.
ning.com), a social media platform provider, to find the networking sites fre-
quented by just exactly the kind of prospects you’re after.
To give you a feel for all this, here’s a small sampling of some prominent 
niche sites:
 
✓ BeGreen: A community that aims to generate environmental awareness 
among Web users. (www.begreen.org)
 
✓ beRecruited.com: A dedicated online community for athletes, coaches, 
and hardcore high school sports fans. (www.berecruited.com)
 
✓ CarGurus: An automotive-based community Web site that lets users 
post car reviews and photos, and share opinions. (www.cargurus.com)
 
✓ Center’d: A fun, interactive way for people to connect with others from 
the same neighborhood. (www.centerd.com)
 
✓ Going.com: Also a fun place where users can interact with folks in their 
communities. (www.going.com)
 
✓ GirlSense: A community for girls to promote their fashion designs. 
(www.girlsense.com)
 
✓ IYOMU.COM: A social networking Web site for adults that allows users 
to search for site members who share the same interests or business 
needs. (www.iyomu.com)

In This Chapter
▶ Managing your online reputation

▶ Using message boards to enhance your reputation
▶ Joining blogs to present your business on a personal level
▶ Putting online press releases to work for you
H
ere’s an unlovely fact of life: It’s almost impossible for any business to 
succeed, online or off, if its reputation stinks. And that’s why a genius 
invented public relations (PR). If your PR is handled correctly, people won’t 
only know you, they’ll think you’re a solid citizen — someone to trust, listen 
to, and buy from.
A lot of businesses that advertise online get tripped up by simple, old con-
versation. People who use the Internet talk incessantly. They use blogs and 
social networks to compare notes on everything from politics to pudding 
recipes, and the plusses and minuses of this business or product are bandied 
about all the time.
People gossip. They take part in impromptu surveys (who’s the best local 
cleaning service?). And more and more these days, they write reviews. In 
fact, reviews have probably become the single biggest determinant of a com-
pany’s online reputation. (According to a survey by the Opinion Research 
Corporation, 84 percent of Internet users say that online reviews influence 
their purchasing decisions.)
Some businesses recognize this and become downright paranoid. They 
convince themselves that their critics far outnumber their fans, and conse-
quently try to keep a low online profile — or even pull themselves off the 
Web entirely — to stay out of the line of fire. But that’s just self-defeating. 

268
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Figure out how to monitor and manage your reputation and how to leverage 
the inevitable conversation that goes on to keep your reputation nice and 
shiny and drive new business your way.
In other words, find out how to handle online PR, which by no coincidence, is 
what this chapter is all about.
Managing Your Reputation Online
The three aspects to managing your online reputation are monitoring, manag-
ing, and promoting. The following sections look briefly at each.
Monitoring
Right now, somewhere on the Internet, people are probably talking about 
you. The first step in any PR effort is to find out what they’re saying.
Start by running a search of your business name and see what appears. Are 
you easy to find — does your listing come up at least somewhat prominently 
in the search results? Looking through your customers eyes, what sort of 
first impression does that listing make? Assuming you have a Web site and 
maybe even a blog, are they up-to-date and looking good? Would someone 
clicking through your listing be impressed by your professionalism?
Even more important, is your business reviewed in any online forums or blogs? 
These almost always appear on a search results page. Look at local directory 
sites, such as Yelp (www.yelp.com), Citysearch (www.citysearch.com), 
and Yahoo! Local (http://local.yahoo.com). With forums for customer 
feedback springing up all over the place, don’t be surprised to find at least 
one that mentions your business. Check the social networking sites, such as 
Facebook and MySpace, as well as any local ones you’re aware of.
Don’t forget that Angie’s List (www.angieslist.com), TripAdvisor (www.
tripadvisor.com), OpenTable (www.opentable.com), and even Google 
Maps (http://maps.google.com) largely focus on publishing reviews. 
Don’t think that any reviews you find today won’t be added to tomorrow. 
Ideally, you want to have a system in place that lets you stay on top of the 
online buzz. You can sign up for Google Alerts, for example, which automati-
cally informs you whenever your business is mentioned in a review, on a 
blog, or in an online publication (see Figure 14-1). Some of the larger review 
sites also alert you via e-mail when your name appears.

Other sites that take a pulse of your business
Some other sites can help you keep tabs on 
the state of your online reputation and promote 
your business:
 ✓ Trackur scours blogs, news sites, images, 
and videos for mentions of their clients’ 
businesses. You can even restrict the 
scouring to mentions that include your key-
words. (www.trackur.com)
 ✓ Technorati is a blog search engine. Its free 
service indexes posts as they’re published. 
When you search on the site, you can use 
the RSS button to subscribe to the blog 
you’re mentioned on. (http://tech
norati.com)
 ✓ MonitorThis is a simple online tool that lets 
you subscribe to the results of searches 
from 22 search engine feeds at the same 
time. (Maybe it should change its name to 
ThisCanKeepYouReallyBusy.) (http://

 ✓ Naymz is a Web profile aggregator and 
reputation metrics service. Its primary 
goal is to make sure that you’re in control 
of your name on the Internet. The service 
lets you configure your Naymz profile to 
include links to other online profiles, as well 
as recent endorsements you’ve received 
and recent Web activity that includes 
your name. Naymz doesn’t charge for its 
basic services, but makes Premium fea-
tures available for $14.95 a month. (www.

Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Managing
After you tune in to the online conversation that’s taking place about your 
business, your next move is to manage it. That usually means responding 
to the reviews you’re getting, particularly the negative ones, which is an 
extremely delicate process.
A negative review — especially one that you think is groundless or unfair — 
can really get your blood boiling. Most people’s first reaction upon reading 
public criticism of their company is to come out with guns blazing. If that’s 
your first reaction, stop. Cool off before you compose your response.
Fight the urge to respond to every negative review or comment you might 
receive. If your reviews are positive overall, it may be best to just let the bad 
one pass without commenting. Readers who frequent review sites are smart 
enough to know that in any string of comments, one or two malcontents 
inevitably appear and just rant for ranting’s sake. Usually, the more rabid 
someone is in panning something, the more likely readers are to just write 
them off as cranks.
However, you will get some negative reviews that deserve to be taken seri-
ously and responded to in a reasoned, rational manner. The basic rule here 
is, when in doubt, apologize. You can make the apology public by posting it 
on the Web site where the negative review appears, or you can privately mes-
sage the reviewer.
Note: Apologizing doesn’t mean groveling. Acknowledge that a mistake might 
have been made in the critic’s specific case and that you’ve taken steps to 
ensure that it doesn’t occur again. Ask critics for one more try and assure 
that you’ll go out of your way to make sure they’re satisfied the next time. 
Remember that the complainer’s review isn’t the end of the conversation. 
Engage people in a receptive and responsible way, and you may well win 
them over. You might even get brownie points for your prompt response to 
their problems. In the best case, the critics may ultimately revise their earlier 
reviews or at least take down the negative ones.
 
If your give-and-take with a dissatisfied customer takes place in a public forum, 
that customer isn’t the only one who sees — and can appreciate — your calm 
and sympathetic response. You could impress a lot of onlookers who’ll make 
positive mental notes about your responsiveness and professionalism.
We aren’t kidding about taking corrective steps — and you shouldn’t be 
either. The complaint posted is likely to have at least a grain of truth. Take 
the complaint to heart, and really see whether some part of your operation 
needs fixed. Then fix it. Remember that these are your customers talking and 
that although they may not always be completely right, they may also be on 
to something that can make your business better.

271
 Chapter 14: Generating PR Buzz
Promoting
Using review sites and social media to help protect and solidify your good 
name has other benefits, such as serving as tools for marketing and analyt-
ics. After diving politely into online conversation, use your presence to get 
involved, answer questions, and keep prospects and customers informed of 
your latest business goings-on.
Position yourself as an authority in your field. Over time, people may come 
to view you that way and recommend you to friends (or better yet, to the 
media), and in the case of social networks, to post a link to your Web site.
You can also invite bloggers — particularly those who seem to be the most 
influential — to review your business and what you have to offer. Sure, you’re 
taking a chance here. However, if your company runs smoothly and takes 
care of customers properly, you have little to fear and potentially, a lot of 
positive visibility to gain.
Also consider becoming an advertiser on the site(s) that features your 
reviews. The benefits of this tactic vary by site, but advertisers generally get 
a prominent display position and other helpful tools. Yelp, for example, lets 
advertisers highlight one of their favorite reviews at the top of their page 
(as long as the review is sufficiently current to still be relevant — see Figure 
14-2). Citysearch even helps advertisers with copywriting or video segments, 
and pushes out the content to partner sites like MapQuest (www.mapquest.
com), AOL CityGuide (http://cityguide.aol.com), and MySpace (www.
myspace.com).
Online review do’s and don’ts
Don’t: Some local business owners take the bull 
by the horns and try to counter bad reviews by 
making up and submitting their own positive 
ones. Some even go so far as to use their phony 
submissions to trash a competitor. Don’t. More 
than likely you’ll be found out, and the reputa-
tion you were trying to save will go up in flames.
Do: Nothing is wrong with gently asking your 
satisfied customers to submit a positive review 
online. You could say something along the order 
of, “You know, probably the best advertising 
we get is by word of mouth. If you get a minute 
sometime and wouldn’t mind, we’d sure appre-
ciate a review from you online.” Subtlety is the 
key here. The friendlier and more offhand you 
make your request, the better the chances are 
that you’ll get that nice review.

Being active on review, social, and blog sites can also help businesses mine 
customer data. For instance, Yelp has a dashboard that allows business 
owners to keep track of page views and responses to promotions — informa-
tion that the business can then use to fine-tune its marketing tactics. A lot of 
the data you gather here can be combined with the other Web analytics you’re 
already using to give you an even more complete picture of where you stand 
in the marketplace.
Building Credibility: Associations, 
Certifications, and More
Endorsements result from receiving certifications of one kind or another 
from professional associations in your industry that you can join. Not sur-
prisingly, these certifications can be used in self-promotion.
The easiest way to do this is to display the seal or logo of the endorsing orga-
nization along with your own. Do this sparingly, however, and only on the 
right materials (such your Web site, directory listings, and social media pro-
files). Otherwise, the organization may contact you and tell you knock it off.

273
 Chapter 14: Generating PR Buzz
The two ways to establish credibility are
 
✓ Assigned credibility: This is the traditional, old-school way to burnish 
your reputation, and it can still be remarkably powerful if you put in the 
work necessary to attain it. Assigned credibility grows out of everything 
from your formal education and credentials earned to industry certifica-
tions you’ve acquired and the breadth of your career experience. The 
common thread in all these is that the credibility you get comes from 
an outside source, usually an institution. To earn credibility, behave, 
play the game, and do what’s necessary to deserve the honors you get. 
People inside your industry know that this kind of credibility isn’t neces-
sarily all it’s cracked up to be, though it does show that you’ve jumped 
through the requisite hoops. People outside your business, however, 
will usually be impressed by the credentials you’ve piled up.
 
✓ Borrowed credibility: This is a shortcut to gaining recognition as an 
authority or expert in your field — and it’s often surprisingly easy to get. 
Here are some typical ways to borrow credibility:
 
• Memberships in professional organizations: Most professional 
organizations have a sort of halo effect around them. They sound 
important, and in many cases, they are. Become a member and 
bask in the rays of credibility that the organizations have gener-
ated for themselves. These types of organization could range any-
where from industry-specific groups like the Plumbing Heating and 
Cooling Contractors Association (if you are plumber) to the Better 
Business Bureau in your area, to your local chamber of commerce. 
Figure 14-3 shows a local business site that prominently displays 
its professional affiliations.
 
• Partnerships: Is someone in your area in the same kind of business 
you are, but for whatever reason, currently enjoys more credibility 
in the field? If so, see whether you can occasionally join forces with 
that individual. Perhaps your two businesses could jointly sponsor 
an industry event, or host some sort of seminar or presentation 
via the local chamber of commerce. Just by being paired with this 
other person, your own credibility is likely to be inferred.
 
• Articles in recognized publications: Could you write articles in 
industry publications whose readers you could help and impress? 
Approach the publications and ask. Just make sure that these 
publications are intended for your target audience and that they 
have their own credibility. Having something printed in a third-rate 
magazine or newsletter won’t advance your case at all and may 
even hurt it. Stick to the solid, respected ones.
 
• Client list: Keep track of who your most prominent existing custom-
ers are and then use their names to borrow credibility. Restaurants 
do this all the time by plastering pictures of their famous custom-
ers on a wall near the entrance. Doing so is effective (even if just 
subconsciously).

274
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
 
• Expert endorsement: Asking for endorsements by experts in your 
field generally yields a lot of turn downs, but even the occasional 
okay can be well worth the effort. Here again, you’re hitching a 
ride, so to speak, on someone else’s credibility. If you feel a little 
squeamish about that, keep in mind that the expert you’re courting 
probably did the same kind of credibility-borrowing earlier in her 
career. This is just how business gets done.

 Chapter 14: Generating PR Buzz
Using Message Boards, Forums, and 
Other Places to Strut Your Stuff
A message board or forum is an online discussion area modeled after a 
traditional bulletin board (without the risk of incurring pushpin wounds). 
Like-minded users gather here to talk about issues and interests they 
have in common. A lot of expertise — or in some cases, what masquer-
ades as expertise — gets thrown around on message boards, and that can 
provide a good opportunity for local businesses, particularly service busi-
nesses, to showcase their knowledge and build credibility with potential 
customers/clients.
Put another way, message boards are micro-communities. They’re always 
much smaller than the Facebook-type networks we talk about in Chapter 13, 
though they may approximate the size of some of the specialized subgroups 
found on those networks. Message boards tend to be composed of members 
who are intensely interested in one subject. Many users gravitate to a par-
ticular board because they feel a strong connection to the forum’s host or 
simply because they feel they’ll come away from the board with more solid, 
useful knowledge than they came in with.
Similar to message boards and forums are user groups — sets of people who, 
again, have similar interests, goals, or concerns and who regularly share their 
ideas online.
Marketing on message 
boards takes patience
Marketing a business to people within message boards is an extremely deli-
cate process. Regular users can become suspicious of newcomers who start 
tooting their own professional horns when they first arrive. Before you make 
any attempt at marketing via a message board, make a concerted effort to 
become a contributing community member.
Be forewarned that this can take patience, and if you’re the naturally sales-
oriented sort, a heaping helping of restraint. At first, join an ongoing discus-
sion rather than start a thread (that is, triggering an ongoing discussion by 
posting a topic and/or question). After you have a feel for how the board’s 
users interact with each other, you can initiate a thread. By then, you’ll be 
known as something of a regular.

Having a goal for posting on message boards
Before you execute a message board marketing strategy, identify your goals. 
Then determine whether the long-term commitment you have to make will 
ultimately be worth your time and effort. Getting comfortable on a board — 
and having others become comfortable with you — takes a while, so don’t 
think that you can contribute a few posts and then start hawking your wares. 
It just doesn’t work that way.
That being said, however, joining a message board(s) and engaging with 
the other members can be an effective marketing tactic if what you hope to 
accomplish is one or more of the following:
 
✓ Gaining key information about your target demographic: Message 
boards are a great place to collect information about your potential 
consumers and their habits. All you really have to do is observe, but you 
can pose a question or otherwise introduce a topic and see what the 
responses are. Board users like this kind of two-way communication; in 
large part, that’s why they’re there.
 
✓ Gathering information about your competitors: Chances are a dis-
cussion centered on your line of business in your area will eventually 
(maybe even regularly) produce mentions of your competition. Here 
again, all this takes from you is observation. Finding out how a com-
petitor is perceived — its strengths and weaknesses — gives you an 
invaluable window into what’s really going on in your marketplace and 
therefore, where your own place in that market is or should be.
 
✓ Building respect for and confidence in your business: Hang out on a rel-
evant message board long enough, and you’ll probably answer questions 
raised about products or services like yours, helping other members trou-
bleshoot a particular problem they’re having and giving your expert opin-
ion on this, that, and the other thing. Keep up this sort of helpful dialogue, 
and people will increasingly come to rely on you as a trusted authority 
and to view your business as a particularly credible one to deal with.
Finding the right message board
So how do you find the right message board, the kind of place where your 
expertise will be valued and your reputation polished? The best way is to 
go to one of the sites in the following list and search the keywords and geo-
graphic modifiers that are most likely to narrow down things for you:
 
✓ BoardReader: http://boardreader.com
 
✓ ForumFind: www.forumfind.com
 
✓ Big Boards: www.big-boards.com

✓ BoardTracker: www.boardtracker.com
 
✓ iVillage: www.ivillage.com
 
✓ Yahoo! Message Boards: http://messages.yahoo.com
 
✓ Yahoo! Groups: http://groups.yahoo.com
 
✓ AOL People Connection: http://peopleconnection.aol.com
 
✓ Google Groups: http://groups.google.com
For example, if you own the Vegan Café in Seattle, Washington, and you search 
ForumFind for vegetarian message boards, you discover www.veggieboards.
com (and no, we aren’t making this up). When you get on VeggieBoards, search 
Seattle, and you’ll discover several discussions going on about which veggie 
restaurants in the city are absolute must-eats. See? Your table’s waiting.
Don’t be surprised if your search for message boards produces more than 
one contender. In that case, concentrate on the one or two with the highest 
search results page rankings. After all, you don’t want to be regularly impart-
ing your pearls of wisdom on some board that few people actually read.
Getting started on message boards in five easy steps
Although it does require an ongoing commit-
ment, participating in message boards is rela-
tively easy. Just follow these simple steps:
 1. Search for large message boards, user groups, 
and forums dedicated to your industry.
 
 Look at the number of registered users on 
the forum at any given time (most boards 
show the users somewhere on their page) 
and decide whether the board is active 
enough to warrant your attention.
 2. Create an account on the message boards 
that discusses local companies in your field.
 
 Use the same name on every board you 
join and choose a name that shows you’re 
affiliated with the company (for example, 
BobofAkronVentilation). Add your work 
e-mail address and your Web site address 
to the signature of your account.
 3. Use the forum’s search function to find 
threads (specific discussions) that are 
related to your area of interest.
 
 Obviously, this saves you a whole lot of 
time. Subscribe to any threads that you 
want to watch, and you’ll receive an e-mail 
whenever a new post appears.
 4. Politely respond to posts, even if you dis-
agree with what’s said.
 
 Being respectful and handling criticism 
calmly is an excellent way to manage your 
online reputation. If a thread contains com-
ments that praise your products and ser-
vices, post a nice, humble thank you.
 5. Add your e-mail address to the user groups 
that pertain to your area of business.
 
 Although some of these groups commu-
nicate solely on the Internet, others hold 
regular face-to-face meetings or events. 
Your e-mail address helps ensure that you 
get on the guest list — and when you show 
up, your own personal magic can take over.

Making the most of message boards
These tips get you started on crafting efficient and effective message board 
comments:
 
✓ Every word counts: Make sure that the content you post — whether 
as comments on message boards, on your blog, or on your Web site — 
includes the keywords that you know are the most heavily searched by 
people looking for your kind of business. That way when consumers 
search for something related to your business, they’re likely to see your 
comment and hopefully move on to your Web site. For obvious reasons, 
your message board content needs to also — subtly — include your URL.
 
✓ Your time is money, so don’t go nuts: Set aside a modest amount of 
time (say, two hours a week) to look through your favorite message 
boards, find relevant discussions, and enter your posts. Try to remem-
ber that although appearing regularly on a relevant board is important, 
quality trumps quantity. More effective is to contribute a few well-
thought-out, well-expressed comments to a discussion than to launch as 
many message missiles as you possibly can.
 
✓ Aim every comment at potential customers: Any message board worth 
its salt has a lively mix of people on it. Somewhere in there, amidst your 
competitors, current customers, and folks who just won’t ever be in 
need of your particular products or services, are potential new customers. 
Concentrate on talking to them. Create content that will appeal to them, 
answer their questions, and maybe even allay any concerns they have. 
Focus on their needs, not yours.
Hitting the Blogs
Blog — or Web log — describes Web sites that maintain an ongoing chronicle 
of information. Each blog is a frequently updated, personal site featuring 
diary-type commentary and links to articles on other Web sites.
Many professional blogs focus on a particular topic, such as Web design, home 
improvement, politics, sports, or mobile technology. Others are more eclectic, 
presenting links to all types of other sites. Still others are personal journals.
Although there are exceptions, blogs generally have a few consistent elements:
 
✓ A main content area consisting of posts listed chronologically, with the 
newest on top. The entries are often organized into categories.
 
✓ An archive of older articles.
 
✓ A way for readers to leave comments about the articles.
 
✓ A list of links to other related sites (or a blogroll).

279
 Chapter 14: Generating PR Buzz
Some business owners find that blogging is a great way to get noticed by 
prospective customers and search engines, and to drive Internet traffic to 
their Web pages. But maintaining a blog is immensely time-consuming and 
demands an ongoing commitment that most local business owners just don’t 
have. In the upcoming sections, we talk about how participating in someone 
else’s blog can have an almost equally positive impact on your business.
Using blogs for your business
You’ll find that making use of blogging for your business really isn’t all that 
difficult. Do the following:
 
✓ Read blogs: Blogging has its own unique language that’s different from 
other forms of writing. To understand how to speak that language, 
follow a few blogs that interest you. To find some, simply search for 
your area of interest on Technorati (http://technorati.com) or 
Google Blogs (http://blogsearch.google.com).
 
✓ Keep blogs short and sweet: If people wanted to read a novel, they’d 
read a novel. When blogging, use short, breezy, conversational posts. 
Also try to maintain a regular presence on the blog you contribute to. 
Not only does this keep you firmly in the community, but many blogs 
give their most frequent contributors special privileges, such as initiat-
ing surveys and opinion polls.
 
✓ Don’t use adspeak: Okay, you’re blogging to promote your business, but 
that shouldn’t seem like your primary goal. Most bloggers hate that. Give 
readers what they want — useful, specialized information that comes 
from your own experience. (Posting something like “The Top Ten Ways to 
Do XYZ” often gets a lot of folks’ attention, and your hard-earned expertise 
in your field should make compiling posts like that a piece of cake.)
 
✓ Tell a story: Many blogs have a personal, diary-like feel to them. The 
author keeps a daily record of what’s going on in his life. If you’re 
authoring your own business-oriented blog, adding the occasional per-
sonal touch to your entries can help humanize you to your readers and 
encourage their interest in your business.
 
✓ Think search engine optimization: You can choose from a lot of ways 
to make your blog posts friendly for search engines. Probably the most 
effective tactic is to use the keywords and phrases that people search-
ing for a business like yours can be expected to use. For example, if 
you’re blogging about plumbing and your company’s in Buffalo, you’re 
wasting an opportunity if you just blog about drain clogs. Better to write 
about drain clogs you’ve fixed in Buffalo. Another good approach is to 
insert links to other pages in your posts; that improves the chances that 
search engines will find you.

The person-to-person nature of blogs helps a lot of business owners establish 
and maintain a close relationship with their potential customers. Importantly, 
this personal relationship can be exactly what separates the owner’s company 
from those of his faceless competitors.
Using blogs the right way
Say you’re a consultant of some sort (such as a lawyer, event planner, or 
local investment advisor). As it happens, consultants are frequent blog users 
because they give them a terrific way to show their expertise. (A co-blogger 
might post, “Hey, Denise. I’m inviting 100 guests to my wedding. How big a 
cake do I need?”) This also lets consultants network with other people in 
their field and can even save them the time and expense of traveling to dis-
tant conferences and trade association meetings.
Or maybe you’re a landscaper. Posting to a blog about how the change of sea-
sons can affect different kinds of shrubs is of great interest to local homeowners 
who take particular pride in their outdoor plantings. (“If you own hydran-
geas, the first frost is going to tear them up. You can cover them with burlap 
though, and that should minimize the damage. Here’s a picture of how the 
burlap covering works.”)
Or here’s an example from real life. A friend of ours owns a successful roofing 
business. He employs a big crew of workers, big enough that his company is 
frequently working on several jobs at once. One day he was out and about 
and decided to check in on one of his crews to see how they were progress-
ing. He was horrified to find them tearing the old roof off the wrong house. 
Boy, did that spark days of conversation on the blog he frequented. Rather 
than making him look like an idiot, his posts about the incredible lengths he 
went to (and the thousands of dollars he spent) to make things right with the 
wrong homeowner wound up earning him a lot of praise and respect — and 
amazingly enough, a number of new jobs. People saw him as a good person 
who was only human, but also as someone who wouldn’t rest until a job was 
done to everyone’s satisfaction.
If you really want your own blog
If you want to spend the time and effort neces-
sary to start and run your own blog, a variety of 
resources enable you to do so easily and, even 
better, for free:

Making the Most of 
Online Press Releases
One of the best things about local online PR is that it doesn’t have to cost 
much. A perfect example is an online press release (or Web news release) 
to provide educational, informative, valuable online news content to pro-
spective customers. This tactic can really improve search engine rankings, 
drive people to a company’s Web site, and generate new business. Online 
press releases are being used more and more by business owners looking for 
affordable local PR and by local media who are always looking for content.
You can use an online press release to break all sorts of news items, from 
scheduled events and personal promotions to recent awards and new prod-
ucts or services. This is a great way to trumpet your latest record sales 
figures and your most significant new accomplishments. More than a few 
of your recipients will be impressed, and the local paper or TV channel can 
extend your reach exponentially if they decide to pick up the story. Figure 
14-4 shows an example of an online press release for a local business.

Comparing traditional 
and online press releases
Traditional and online press releases are the same, only different. This sec-
tion explains the differences between the two.
A traditional, paper press release really had no reason for being unless it was 
received and run by local media. Whoever handled a business’s PR usually 
had a long list of phone and fax numbers for dozens of press outlets, both 
local and statewide. Getting the releases placed was often a case of sending 
them out, and then following up with phone calls or e-mails prodding the 
recipient editors or producers to run with what was sent. This whole process 
could devour a lot of work hours.
With online press releases, getting media attention is still a primary goal, but 
it’s hardly the whole ball of wax. Online releases can be posted at multiple, 
non media-specific locations on the Web and will usually (as in, should always) 
include the originator’s Web site address. This in turn gets the attention of 
search engines, which can then help move the releases to the online public 
at large. This process isn’t so much a case of cutting out the middle man (the 
media) as it is of viewing that middle man as just one channel of distribution.
Another difference is that unlike their traditional counterparts, online press 
releases can be optimized for the benefit of search engine crawlers (which 
we talk about in Chapter 7). All this requires you to do is pepper the content 
of a release with your chosen keywords, which is easy. Start out by writing a 
traditional press release and then follow these steps:
 
1. Research the keywords your target audience is likely to use to get infor-
mation about your subject matter.
 
 You’ve probably already done this research.
 
2. Include your most competitive keywords in the headline of the release.
 
3. Repeat those keywords at least three times in a 300-word release.
 
 This is the longest any optimized online press release should run.
 
4. Use a geographic modifier, such as your state or city, in your copy (and 
if possible, your headline) and mention it frequently.
 
5. Add keywords in the link(s) you provide back to your Web site.
 
If you sponsor local events or you offer several promotions each month, issu-
ing a calendar-based press release can be a great way to go. Unlike traditional 
releases, a digitally produced calendar can easily be changed or added to 
without issuing a new press release. Check out the Web sites of your local 
newspaper, radio, and TV stations, as well as chamber of commerce and com-
munity college. If they feature calendars somewhere on their site, make sure 
they receive your calendar.

Distributing online press releases
In the preceding section, we discuss the role of media outlets in making sure 
your online press releases are seen by large numbers of people in your area. 
Here are several additional ways to disseminate your online releases by using 
distribution services, including:
 
✓ 1888PressRelease.com: Despite a name that suggests it’s a good place 
to find press releases from the 19th century, 1888PressRelease.com 
offers both free and paid ways of accessing distribution outlets and 
increasing your visibility. This site can also furnish you with tracking 
data. (www.1888pressrelease.com)
 
✓ I-Newswire.com: A service that allows you to distribute one online 
press release per week to a global audience. Features both free and paid 
options. (www.i-newswire.com)
 
✓ MediaSyndicate.com: A free service that specializes in distributing 
press releases for small- and medium-sized businesses. (http://
mediasyndicate.com)
 
✓ SBWire: A paid service that enables you to distribute press releases to 
specific, targeted industries and geographic areas. This service also dis-
tributes your releases via RSS (Really Simple Syndication) to numerous 
third-party-sites. (www.sbwire.com)
Point to your Web site
All the things we mention in this chapter are 
excellent ways to promote your business and 
maintain your reputation among customers and 
prospects. But none of them is ultimately worth 
much unless you keep in mind that cardinal rule 
of online marketing: Everything you do has to be 
linked back to your Web site or landing page.
After all, this is where the real business gets 
done — providing information, wooing and 
converting prospects, and transforming them 
into paying customers. Whether you’re hitting 
the message boards or blogs, or distributing 
optimized press releases to here, there, and 
everywhere, never forget to provide a link that 
enables consumers to come visit you. This is 
the payoff that everything else points to and 
facilitates. This is where you make the sale.

Using Offline Channels 
to Drive Online Traffic
In This Chapter
▶ Making your URL an always-and-everywhere marketing tool
▶ Using tracking codes, vanity URLs, and cross-pollination
▶ Maintaining consistency between your online and offline efforts
T
hroughout this book, we discuss a host of online tactics you can use to 
build your business, but chances are you use offline marketing channels 
as well. The goal is to get the online and offline marketing to work together in 
a way that makes them mutually supportive — and mutually productive.
Here are some fairly obvious ways to do this: Include your URL on every 
piece of promotional material you send out. Make sure your URL is on news-
paper ads, in radio commercials, on letterhead, on business cards, in Yellow 
Pages ads, on the signage on service vehicles, and in the front window of your 
retail space. To put this simply, everyplace you are, your URL should be, too.
Getting your online and offline tactics to work together also means that if you 
say, send out postcards advertising a special promotion of some sort, your 
Web site spotlights the same promotion. Not doing so can make for some 
very confused and unhappy customers.
Another approach is to offer coupons via your offline marketing that promise 
special, Web-only deals. Trust us — folks will be primed to visit your site and 
collect their goodies while being exposed to all the wonderfulness of your 
Web site.
Good things can result from all this integration. Done right, integration will 
make both your marketing methods work harder by creating a whole that’s 
bigger than the sum of its parts. And the activity on your Web site can help you 
gather useful feedback about how well your offline advertising is working.

286
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Putting Your URL in All the Right Places
Despite the obviousness, many business owners forget to put their URL on 
their offline marketing materials. Your direct mail, print advertising, and radio 
and TV commercials are all indispensable places to include your Web address. 
These days, people almost think it’s suspect if you don’t include a URL.
Plus, remember this good stuff:
 
✓ A lot of consumers simply don’t want to call a local business. Maybe 
they don’t want to get a hard sell by a pushy salesperson, or they’re just 
shy. Whatever the case, these folks are more likely to reach out to you 
online.
 
✓ Phone numbers are easily forgotten, especially when they’re in a broad-
cast message. (The exception is when you have a really snazzy number 
like 1-800-Got-Junk.) A URL, on the other hand, is usually easy to remem-
ber because it’s often the company-name-dot-com or something very 
close.
 
✓ Including a URL on all your offline materials is just one more way to get 
in front of potential customers, cement your name in the public’s mind, 
and help build your brand.
Tracking with landing pages
You can also use a few online, Web site-based tricks to help you get a handle 
on which of your offline channels are bringing new customers to your busi-
ness. Say you’re a fencing contractor in Phoenix, Arizona, your Web address 
is www.thefenceguyaz.com, and you use offline channels, such as direct 
mail and newspaper ads, in addition to your online efforts.
Being smart, you include your URL on all your offline materials and prospects 
come to your Web site. But doing this alone isn’t really enough because of 
the following questions:
 
✓ Where exactly are your customers coming from? People are winding 
up on your home page, but how did they get there? Did they see your 
URL in your newspaper ads, on your billboards, or in your mailers? 
Because you don’t know that, you can’t know which of your offline mate-
rials work and which are just dead weight. Granted, if you’re using Web 
analytics on your site, you probably can differentiate between Web site 
visitors who found you on a search engine versus those who directly 
navigated to you by typing your URL into their browsers. But that still 
doesn’t answer the question of which offline channel brought ’em.

287
 Chapter 15: Using Offline Channels to Drive Online Traffic
 
✓ Which promotion brought the customers? Additionally, say one of 
your offline marketing initiatives is running a special promotion. You’ve 
included links on your home page that are keyed to the specific promo-
tions that you’ve included in offline materials. That is, your current 
newspaper ad promotes a certain kind of fencing, while your direct mail 
offers a 30-percent discount on installation, and your home page pro-
vides corresponding links (no pun intended) for each promotion.
 
 The problem is that Web site visitors are notorious for their short atten-
tion spans, and they won’t like clicking through links on your home page 
to get what they came for.
Given the two preceding problems, what do you do? The answer is a landing 
page (or pages). By creating a specific landing page for each of your various 
offline campaigns and by creating unique URLs for each, you can easily track 
the sources of your site’s visitors.
 
In adopting this strategy, don’t include paths to these landing pages on your 
home page or site map because for your tracking to be accurate and action-
able, the unique landing pages you create have to be completely isolated from 
any access points other than the unique URLs you use. If you let people navi-
gate to landing pages from your home page and/or site map, you completely 
muddy the waters and will still wonder who came from where for what.
Suppose you’re sending direct mail offering savings on a product or service. 
Instead of including your primary URL (www.thefenceguyaz.com), the 
mailer could point recipients to a directory listing, such as www.
thefenceguyaz.com/savings or to a sub-domain, such as www.savings.
thefenceguyaz.com. Doing this lets you
 
✓ Tailor the landing page’s message specifically toward what first got 
the prospect to that page. If your direct mail advertised a special 30-
percent discount offer, the corresponding landing page can prominently 
display the same deal.
 
✓ Tailor the page’s look to make it consistent with the direct mail’s look. 
Use the same color schemes and fonts, copy style, and call to action. 
Any images you used in the mailer need to also be on the landing page. 
You want the potential customer to get to the landing page and think, 
“Good, I’m in the right place.” This helps move customers seamlessly 
along in the conversion and sales process.
 
✓ Measure precisely how well your offline advertising efforts are work-
ing. If you’ve created a landing page that matches a particular piece of 
direct mail — and that matches only with that mailing — you know for 
sure that it got the customer onto your site. Put another way, the mailer, 
with its distinct URL to a page that isn’t otherwise navigable to via your 
home page, is the only way the customer could have arrived on that par-
ticular landing page. Measure that and you get a clean read.

288
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Using vanity URLs
Another way to send people to a specific landing page (and whose visits you 
can then track) is through the use of a vanity URL. A vanity URL is an easy-to-
remember URL that promotes a particular product or service. For example, 
maybe your company URL is www.company.com and your vanity URL for 
your A, B, and C product or service is www.abc.com. The vanity address can 
then be made to redirect to the corresponding product/service landing page 
you’ve set up already (which has an actual URL of www.company.com/abc.
html). You then track the redirects to the landing page.
URL redirection (or URL forwarding) is a simple coding function that automati-
cally changes the URL a user types into a different URL when she hits Enter. 
Think of this as giving out different business phone numbers; when any of 
those numbers are dialed, they immediately reroute to the main office 
number.
Using vanity URLs can be beneficial in several ways:
 
✓ As with sub-domains and directory-based URLs, your vanity URL sends 
prospects to the most appropriate landing page. This is far better than 
just dumping visitors onto your home page and expecting them to find 
the information they want.
 
✓ Vanity URLs allow you to have a much more memorable URL. Pick 
something that’s easy to say and spell. This is especially important if 
you’re using radio or television, which has an audio component. (Using 
a relatively detailed Web address in broadcast advertising is clumsy 
because the person in the commercial has to say things like slash, dot, 
and html. Not only is this cumbersome, it chews up valuable seconds.)
 
✓ You can easily tie a special promotion, product, or service into the 
vanity URL. A company whose primary address is www.stephens
shoestore.com and is offering a new and uncommonly comfortable 
line of footwear could use www.comfyfeet.com.
 
✓ Vanity URLs can also be used to measure the effectiveness of one 
media buy versus another. Say you’re airing the same radio commercial 
on three different stations in your market. The commercial’s content is 
the same no matter which station it’s heard on, but at the end when 
your URL is given, you use a different vanity URL on each station. All 
three vanity URLs then redirect prospects to the same landing page. 
You measure each redirect to find out which of the three radio stations 
performs best.
And here’s some additional good news about using vanity URLs: They 
probably won’t cost you anything in extra hosting fees because a redirect 

289
 Chapter 15: Using Offline Channels to Drive Online Traffic
isn’t usually considered a separate site or landing page. A few hosting ser-
vices may want to drag a few extra bucks out of you for using the vanity-
redirect approach. But even these guys won’t charge you more than a little 
extra.
 
Some Web marketers don’t put much stock in using vanity URLs because 
they believe that branding one’s business Web site is so vitally important that 
any mention of any URL different than the home page’s dilutes the brand and 
therefore, wastes money that could otherwise be spent on brand-building. We 
admit this argument has a certain logic, but it’s also fair to say that most 
local businesses aren’t nearly as brand-obsessed as the critics. Where does 
that leave you? Ultimately, the question of whether to use vanity URLs is one 
that each business has to answer based on its own needs and marketing 
philosophy.
Promo codes
Ever hear something like this? You’re listen-
ing to the Biff’s Cavalcade of Twisted Gothic 
Chants radio show, and Biff reads a commer-
cial on air, gives the sponsor’s URL, and then 
says, “And don’t forget to use the promo code 
Biff.” Using promotional (or promo) codes are 
a pretty big thing because they let a business 
track the visits to its home page without using 
separate landing page URLs.
A promo code is simply a brief string of char-
acters that allows advertisers to differentiate 
how a potential customer heard about them. 
Did the visitor come via radio? Direct mail? 
Newspaper? A home page that encourages 
the prospect to enter a promo code? Each of 
which is keyed to the advertisement/medium 
from which it came and lets the advertiser 
identify the source of the visit.
Using promo codes has a couple downsides 
though, such as many people flat out won’t use 
them. Maybe people are just uncooperative, or 
maybe it’s that in addition to having brief atten-
tion spans, a lot of people have short memories. 
Whatever the cause, typically less than 50 per-
cent of those consumers given a promo code 
will use it. Consequently, a particular adver-
tisement might actually have brought the pros-
pect to the site, but the advertiser will never 
know it. (This is further complicated because 
a few Web sites do nothing but provide promo 
codes for free for dozens of companies, mean-
ing that the people who use these particular 
codes are coming to sites without necessarily 
seeing any advertising.)
As a general rule, promo codes are best used 
by businesses that want or need only a very 
general sense of which of their advertisements 
are driving traffic.

Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
Using Cross-Pollination for Search
URLs are effective devices, no matter where they’re used, but they aren’t the 
be-all, end-all of online advertising. A lot of consumers will read an ad or a 
direct mail or be attracted by a TV or radio commercial, yet not use the URL 
that the sponsor provided.
This isn’t particularly odd; think about it. An advertisement probably mentions 
the business’s name far more often than it does the company’s URL, so that’s 
what most likely sticks in a consumer’s mind. Even if that person remember 
the URL, it generally takes more keystrokes to type that address into a browser 
than it does just to query the company’s name on a search engine.
How often does search versus direct URL navigation happen? According to 
a ClickZ (www.clickz.com) survey of consumers who searched for a com-
pany, product, or slogan, 37 percent were motivated to do so by a television 
commercial, 20 percent were drawn by a print ad, and 17 percent were sent 
by a radio spot. These numbers are significant.
This phenomenon has a couple important implications:
 
✓ Keywords are (still) key: Having your organic listing appear in one of 
the top spots on a search engine results page is terrific. Your branded 
keywords (which, for many businesses, include the company’s name) 
have obviously done a lot of good. But knowing that a hefty percentage 
of your prospects may have come through search rather than by using 
your URL, you have to make sure you’ve covered all the bases as far 
as your business name is concerned. Seriously consider buying your 
company’s name for a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign. (Studies show 
that a PPC ad for a branded keyword will usually provide incremental 
sales for a business, even if that business already holds the top organic-
listing spot.)
 
 So, back to PPC you go — and back to your chosen keywords. In this 
case, we’re talking specifically about buying your company name as a 
keyword. That way no matter which advertisement or marketing chan-
nel brought your name to a consumer’s mind, that consumer will find 
you through a search engine. Even if your business’s name is the only 
keyword you buy, you’ll be spending your money wisely.
 
✓ Be consistent: Consumers who see and/or hear the name of your busi-
ness through an offline advertisement and then find you via a search 
engine, will rightly expect your Web page to look and feel wholly consis-
tent with whatever ad it was that motivated them to find you. This kind 
of consistency includes color scheme, copy style, imagery, and so on. 
In much the same way as you make sure that your Web site and search 
engine efforts are all operating around the same keywords, so should 
your site offer consumers a smooth, easy, coherent transition from their 
offline stimulation to their online experience.

291
 Chapter 15: Using Offline Channels to Drive Online Traffic
Leveraging the Insights You Gain Online
When you run a PPC campaign, you quickly find out which of your key-
words are best at driving prospects to your Web site (and one hopes, 
converting them into customers). You then make an effort to focus most of 
your attention — and dollars — on keeping your business at or near the top 
of the results page that appears when those keywords are used.
You can do something very similar with your combined online-offline market-
ing efforts: Let one of them guide you in maximizing the effectiveness of the 
other. Although consumers tend to behave somewhat differently in an offline 
environment than in an online world (obviously, they can’t explore any links 
in offline media), there’s plenty of similar behavior, too.
Applying online lessons 
to offline marketing
Here are couple examples of how this kind of leveraging can work:
 
✓ For example, your company does gutter cleaning. You notice from using 
Google AdWords that as fall approaches, more people are searching for 
gutter cleaning. Wisely, you then launch a special promotion for your 
gutter-cleaning services in the local newspaper.
 
✓ For example, you own a house painting company, and your Web site 
metrics indicate that most of your site visitors spend considerable time 
on your Gallery page, where you display several before-and-after photos. 
You decide to promote your gallery in your print ads and direct mail 
pieces because you infer that that’s a great way to drive people to your 
Web site.
Because online marketing easily lends itself to detailed analysis of your 
prospects’ behavior, it can tell you a host of things that you could never find 
out from offline efforts alone. Promptly put that analysis to work across the 
board.
Applying offline lessons to online marketing
Online-offline leveraging works in the opposite direction as well. For example, 
you own a local fitness center, and you’re currently running a radio campaign 
that offers a 30-day free trial membership, and the campaign is creating an 
increase in your Web site traffic. Consequently, you decide to use the same 
promotion in the ad copy for your PPC campaign and throughout the appro-
priate landing pages on your site.

292
Part III: Doing the Advertising Part of Local Online Advertising 
This kind of leveraging can even work both ways almost simultaneously, 
especially when a fortunate outside event pops up. For instance, maybe one 
of the services you provide at your beauty salon is a new and super-effective 
kind of electrolysis. In your newspaper ad, you’ve included that new tech-
nique in the long list of services you offer, and that mention has generated a 
small increase in new business. Then a local news show runs a two-minute 
piece on this electrolysis breakthrough, and suddenly your phone starts ring-
ing and ringing.
Being nobody’s fool, you make sure you have a special landing page on your 
site that goes into extensive detail about the new process, complete with 
before-and-after pictures, testimonials, and so on. At the same time, you go 
back and revise your newspaper campaign to focus on the new technique, 
and you include a vanity URL that sends consumers directly to that dedi-
cated landing page. Within days, your salon is absolutely packed with soon-
to-be-less-hairy people.
Using Integration as Your Key to Success
 
We talk earlier about integrating your online and offline advertising, but it’s 
a lesson that needs emphasis. Your online and offline marketing efforts must 
work together, both pulling in the same direction to the same end, and doing 
so as seamlessly as possible.
You may start thinking of them as two distinct marketing channels, but in 
truth, they aren’t. They’re simply two prongs of exactly the same strategy. 
This strategy is integration, and it’s key because consumers don’t behave in 
neat and tidy ways. In gathering information about products and services and 
about the local businesses that provide them, people will ricochet constantly 
among what they see in the media, come upon in the course of an online 
search, read or hear in offline advertising, talk about with their friends, and 
so on. In short, they’re bouncing all over the place — and your single-minded 
sales message needs to be all over the place, too.
The transitions a consumer makes from offline sources to your online mar-
keting messages needs to feel completely natural and effortless — which is 
to say, consistent in content, look, and feel so that the different venues come 
across to that consumer as just slightly different windows that all share the 
same view.
An offer you make in one medium needs to be echoed in all others. If you 
run a promotion in print, broadcast, outdoor, and/or direct mail, consumers 
will rightly expect that same promotion to be emphasized online (and vice 
versa). If that sort of tight integration isn’t there, prospects will likely get con-
fused and take their interest — and their business — elsewhere.

293
 Chapter 15: Using Offline Channels to Drive Online Traffic
A conceit exists among Internet marketing companies and consultants that 
online marketing will soon make offline advertising obsolete. Of course they’d 
say that given the nature of their business. But, in any case, that prediction is 
just silly.
People don’t live online — they just visit. What they see and hear in the 
offline, non-Internet world will always influence their buying decisions. You 
have to market your business both offline and online. The surest path to suc-
cess is to make those two channels of communication work as one.
Further, success means making all your efforts work together. Cherry-picking 
just this one and that one and leaving the rest undone won’t get you much 
of anywhere. (It’s like saying, “My airplane now has a tail and one wing. That 
oughta do it.”) We’re talking integration here.
Think big picture. Think teamwork. Thing synergy. Just don’t think that the 
online tactics you use can be fully effective in a vacuum. Align them closely 
with your offline efforts and with any skill and luck at all, you can be doing 
more and better business in no time flat.

Keeping Your Customers 
Coming Back

In this part . . .
Y
ou’re poised on the threshold of designing and 
executing a first-rate online marketing campaign, 
so it won’t be long before prospective customers start 
beating a path to your door. And that’s terrific. But then 
the question inevitably arises: How do you keep those 
customers coming back for more? How do you keep them 
interested in the things you have to say and to sell? How 
do you keep your business’s front door swinging open, 
day after profitable day?
Chapters 16 and 17 tell you how. The first discusses 
the finer points of building and nurturing customer 
relationships — those fragile, fertile things that any 
business relies on to stay in business. And the latter 
talks about the importance of mining your customer 
database to keep the proverbial ball rolling — and 
keep sales rolling in.
Building customer relationships are all very, very doable, 
which you can see by reading on.

Chapter 16
Staying at the Top 
of Customer s’ Minds
In This Chapter
▶ Committing yourself to customer relationships
▶ Staying in touch with existing customers
▶ Keeping in contact with your customers
▶ Using special promotions, referrals, contests, and giveaways
You’ve been busy. You’ve been planning your online campaign, executing 
it, measuring it, refining it — and, thanks to all your efforts, you’ve gen-
erated a goodly number of actual sales. Excellent, bravo, and way to go.
Now what? Well, now comes the critical business of making sure that these 
hard-earned, first-time customers return to you the next time they’re in the 
market for what you sell. Presumably, you treated them right the first time 
around, and it would be a downright pity, shame, crime, you name it, if next 
time, they unthinkingly drifted off to one of your competitors. So how do you 
keep that from happening?
First off, don’t count on automatic loyalty. Customers — even established 
ones — are fickle. Not unlike packrats, they’re attracted to new, shiny things, 
and if your competition comes calling with something that twinkles, they’re 
liable to forget you and go for it.
The truly important step is to keep you and your company top-of-mind for 
your customers so that your business is the first — and maybe even the 
only — place they think of when they’re again ready to buy. The good news 
is that your business can keep its top-of-mind position without expending 
much in the way of money, effort, or time. In this chapter, we show you how 
to make the most of your best new business opportunities — your exist-
ing customers — using proven online tactics that include everything from 
e-newsletters and customer surveys, to rewards and referral programs, to 
contests and giveaways.

Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
Standing Out in the Crowd
No matter how smart a business owner you are, at least one of your competi-
tors will think he’s smarter. He figures he’ll undercut your prices, spend more 
on new-customer advertising, or open a flashier store.
But what this competitor may not (and, we certainly hope, doesn’t) quite 
grasp is the importance of building relationships with existing customers 
to the point where they’ll think of him first when they think of the kinds of 
goods that you both sell.
 
Always make sure that your company is at the top of customers’ minds — that 
they think of your company first and foremost. So, whether you’re surprising 
your customers with freebies, regularly providing them with useful information, 
asking them for feedback in a way that flatters them, giving them a chance to 
win big, or using some other technique that keeps you front and center in their 
minds, you’re instantly putting yourself at a true competitive advantage.
Your existing customer base is the easiest to reach, the easiest to sell to, and 
the most cost-effective to influence overall. Nurture and retain those folks, 
and in effect, you’ll be drilling a veritable well from which you can keep draw-
ing business for years to come.
Making Nurturing Second Nature
Sure, it’s Basic Business 101, but we want to say it anyway: The best 
source of new customers is existing customers. And here’s another truism: 
Customers just want to feel wanted.
Put together those two thoughts and you have an airtight case for taking care 
of the customers you already have. Show them attention and appreciation, 
and they’ll come back to you again and again. They’ll also recommend you 
to others who may then become new customers, and the business chain just 
gets longer and longer.
We make this quick trip to Planet Obvious because a lot of local business 
owners manage to forget these simple principles. Somehow they convince 
themselves that a bird in the hand will stay there without any further care 
and feeding. Then they wonder why the person they sold X to last year hasn’t 
since come back for Y.
What makes this especially problematic is that it isn’t all that easy to create 
a new customer from scratch. The American Association of Advertising 
Agencies reports that although consumers receive literally thousands of 

299
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
marketing messages each day, the human brain can process only a tiny frac-
tion of them. The odds of that tiny fraction of messages inspiring an actual 
sale are a whole lot tinier still.
Your existing customer base, on the other hand, is already in your corral . . . 
at least for the moment.
Knowing why customers run away
The reasons most commonly cited by business customers for buying from a 
given company just once are
 
✓ They felt, in retrospect, that the business’s pricing was too high.
 
✓ They had a complaint that went unresolved.
 
✓ They found a competitor’s offer more attractive.
 
✓ They left because the business didn’t care.
The last two reasons in the list are the ones that customers give most often, 
which means that they fly the proverbial coop because a particular company 
made them feel unwanted or unvalued — and made them easy prey for some 
dastardly competitor.
Building relationships = Building profits
Here are some statistics (compiled by www.customersfirst.com/ps_
cust_serv_research.html) regarding your existing customer base:
 
✓ Repeat customers spend 33 percent more than new customers.
 
✓ Referrals from repeat customers occur 107 percent more often than 
referrals from non-customers.
 
✓ Selling something to a prospect costs six times as much as selling the 
same thing to an existing customer.
Considering the importance of a business’s existing customer base, why do 
many businesses spend 80 percent of their marketing dollars chasing after 
new customers? Why is such little effort made to nurture and retain the cus-
tomers they already have?
You don’t have to be an MBA to conclude that your marketing dollars go a 
lot further toward producing profits if you use them to build, nurture, and 
develop your current customer relationships.

Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
Retaining long-term customer loyalty is a long-term challenge. Doing so takes 
effort every day in response to every sale — no matter how big or small — 
but it’s eminently doable and at very little cost.
Finding Cost-Effective 
Ways to Keep in Contact
The most powerful incentive for a customer to give you repeat business is (not 
to go all Hallmark on you, but . . .) emotional. Sure, bang for the buck, stand-
out service, and quality products are all big factors. But a customer who feels 
personally connected to a particular business will keep coming back even if, in 
objective terms, you aren’t really all that different from your competition.
 
Developing one-to-one connections with your customers is pivotal in your efforts 
to build long-term loyalty. Establishing and maintaining two-way communication 
with your customers is the key to creating these kinds of relationships.
Where did I put all those old customers?
Before you can foster an ongoing relation-
ship with your existing customers, you have 
to remember who they are, which shouldn’t 
be particularly hard if your business has been 
computerized to some extent for a few years.
Dive into your sales database and arrange the 
customers into three piles: recent ones, not-so-
recent ones, and old ones. If you were wise, 
you captured their e-mail addresses along the 
way. If you weren’t and didn’t, you can always 
call them and ask whether you can put them 
on your e-mail list to, you know, let them know 
about special deals and the like. Note: Simply 
making the phone call can be the start of build-
ing a bridge to the customers you contact.
Okay, now that you have your three piles, which 
ones do you contact first? We suggest the fol-
lowing order:
 1. The new ones: They have the most recent 
experience with you and will think it’s pretty 
natural that you’re contacting them.
 2. The old ones: It’s high time you jogged the 
old customers’ memories and put yourself 
back on their radar screens. “Hello, Mr. 
Backus. It’s been awhile since we’ve done 
business with you, and we wanted to let 
you know about our exciting, new [fill in the 
blank].”
 3. The middle ones: They’ll probably have 
at least some memory of you, but they’ll 
need a bit more coaxing than your recent 
customers. Time for them to enjoy all your 
considerable charms.
Of course, if you have the wherewithal to con-
tact all your existing customers at once, go 
right ahead. But if your time is limited, prioritiz-
ing them into a logical working order is the best 
way to proceed.

301
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
Sending thank you messages
The one kind of business e-mail that nearly always gets read and almost 
never gets treated like spam is the confirmation e-mail that a business sends 
to a customer immediately after a sale. In earlier times, this was known as 
a thank you note, like the kind your mom insisted you write to Aunt Lydia, 
thanking her for that hideous Christmas scarf she knitted for you.
Sending a business thank you is much simpler — and more sincere. You 
may already have some sort of e-mail system set up to confirm your online 
appointments, orders, or reservations (and if you don’t, create one).
The e-mail you send should not only confirm the activity and, if possible, 
specify a delivery or service date, but it should also emphatically thank the 
customers for their business and invite them to call or e-mail you with any 
questions. The following example shows a sample of a no-frills thank you 
message.
Dear Stephanie,
I just wanted to thank you for your first visit to Hand & Stone Massage 
Spa. Here’s hoping it was every bit as rejuvenating as you’d expected!
In the future, if you’re feeling stressed, don’t hesitate to call or visit us 
online to make an appointment — a half-hour treatment for only $30 
might be just what the doctor ordered.
Wishing you good health,
Jackie A. Smith
Hand & Stone Massage Spa
A well-designed thank you message can also assist with other business goals:
 
✓ To make more sales: Of course you want to sell more, so use your thank 
you message to (politely and tactfully) suggest other products or ser-
vices that may interest the customer. You can instead (or in addition) 
include a coupon for a discount on her next purchase from you.
 
✓ To solicit e-newsletter subscribers: Include a bit of copy promoting the 
benefits of a subscription to your e-newsletter and a link to the sign-up 
page on your Web site. Because you’re inducing a sign-up from an exist-
ing customer, you could offer an incentive (like a free sample or a signifi-
cant discount) for him to subscribe.
 
✓ To acquire testimonials for your Web site: In the course of thanking 
the customer for her purchase, ask whether she’d be kind enough to 
provide you with a quotation (and the permission to use it) about what 
she thinks of your business. If you think that sounds just a teensy bit too 
pushy, you can always offer the customer a small incentive to furnish 
the quotation. That can do wonders for your response rate.

302
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
✓ To get more fans on Facebook: This goal would’ve sounded strange 
a couple years ago, but with the explosion of the social media, it’s an 
always-on connection with your customers. So in your thank you mes-
sage, include an invitation to become one of your company’s fans on 
Facebook, a friend on MySpace, or a Twitter follower. And provide a link 
to the site you want the customer to visit.
 
You can probably think of other ways in which your customers can support 
your business outreach. So ask them. You may be surprised at the positive 
response you get. Start with your most wanted actions or goals, and give one 
or more of them a shot. If the response helps your business, great. If not, try 
something else. Over time, you’ll figure out what types of requests are the 
most likely to get results.
Exploiting e-newsletters
E-newsletters are regularly scheduled communications from your company that 
invite a two-way conversation with your customers. Although your e-newsletter 
can certainly contain some calls to action designed to give your business some 
short-term bumps in the sales department, the e-newsletter format is suited 
uniquely to accomplish the long-term goals of customer retention and loyalty. 
Plus, e-newsletters cost almost nothing to produce and send.
 
In Chapter 10, we discuss the nuts and bolts of how to produce and send mar-
keting e-mails. Those techniques apply directly to e-newsletters, too, so check-
ing out that chapter might be a good idea.
What makes e-newsletters so effective? In a word: Trust. A well-written 
e-newsletter is a subtle and extremely effective way to build your credibility 
and your customers’ confidence in your company. After all, the e-newsletter 
is free to the recipients, non-threatening and non-intrusive (because they’ve 
signed up already to get it), and contains information that’s relevant to their 
interests. E-newsletters also
 
✓ Build your brand. E-newsletters position your business as a valuable asset.
 
✓ Are cost-effective. You can send thousands of them for virtually nothing 
(as opposed to printed mailings with all that pesky paper and postage).
 
✓ Stay current and fresh. The topics of e-newsletters can constantly 
change; thereby a) not boring your customers to death, and b) making 
them feel they’re in the loop on important information.
 
✓ Keep your name in front of past and prospective clients. This makes 
them far more likely to remember you when they’re ready to buy some-
thing from a company like yours.
 
✓ Keep your customer list working. This is a list that might otherwise just 
be sitting there collecting dust mites.

303
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
Figure 16-1 shows a sample e-newsletter.
 
Figure 16-1: 
A sample 
e-newsletter.
 
Local business owners generally have two questions about the whole 
e-newsletter thing:
 
✓ How should they start?
 
✓ How should they keep going?
As soon as someone signs up for your e-newsletter, the process begins. Grab 
the e-newsletter recipient’s attention with a proper welcome and hold his 
interest with compelling, relevant information. Follow these steps:
 
1. E-mail a welcome letter to all signees a welcome letter that gives them 
a good idea of what they can expect from the mailings that will follow.
 
 You can provide a preview of topics you plan to address, hint at news 
that you’ll be announcing in the weeks or months ahead, and give access 
to your archive of previous issues. Make sure that your welcome letter 
also does the following:
 
• Thanks recipients for subscribing. Tells them how to unsubscribe if 
they choose to and give them a way to change their contact infor-
mation if necessary.

304
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
• States your privacy policy. The privacy policy tells visitors to your 
site what information is being collected, how that information is 
being protected, and whether or not you will share that informa-
tion with third parties. This simply helps them feel more secure 
about doing business with you.
 
• Promotes brand recognition. Include your company’s logo and your 
distinctive color palette and fonts. Remember, you’re building your 
brand here.
 
2. Identify and develop e-newsletter content that demonstrates what you 
know.
 
 You didn’t get where you are, running your own successful business, 
without learning a lot of things that remain complete mysteries to your 
customers. Keep track of the questions that customers and friends 
typically ask you. Make note of what’s going on in your industry that 
you know is important, but that outsiders aren’t likely to appreciate. 
Dedicate a single e-newsletter to just one or two of the questions or 
industry developments on your list.
You’re likely to be surprised at how many subjects you can easily come up 
with by relying on what you know. For a monthly e-newsletter, you need only 
12 a year (or only 6 for a bimonthly e-newsletter).
Conducting satisfaction surveys
Sure, a lot of local businesses talk about satisfying their customers, but too 
few make the effort to find out whether they’re actually doing it. Such lack 
of initiative is pretty goofy when you consider that finding out is simply a 
matter of asking, and asking your customers whether they’re satisfied is well 
worth the effort. If you conduct your customer satisfaction surveys thought-
fully and with appropriate follow-up, they can be your single most effective 
tool for growing your sales and turning one-time buyers into loyal repeat 
customers.
Catching customers before they wander off
In most cases, dissatisfied customers won’t stick around long enough to com-
plain. They just vote with their feet and disappear. But if you offer custom-
ers a voice through a satisfaction survey, you may proactively discover that 
something is wrong with your products or services. If you do and can correct 
the problem quickly, you may keep your current customers from becoming 
unhappy ex-customers.

305
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
Satisfaction surveys have other benefits, too. They
 
✓ Give your customers the opportunity to think and express themselves 
about what you do for them, which can help underscore your value in 
their minds.
 
✓ Can nip small annoyances in the bud before those small problems snow-
ball into big rock-and-ice-encrusted ones that crush your customer 
relationships.
 
✓ Give you a good way to identify your competitive differences, your 
strengths and your weaknesses in the marketplace — all of which you 
really need to know.
 
✓ Offer an extremely efficient, cost-effective way to market yourself in a 
positive light because you’re explicitly demonstrating your concern for 
your customers’ satisfaction and well-being.
Making them feel important
The less tangible, but still highly important virtue of satisfaction surveys is 
the message they tacitly send to your customers:
You value their business. You want them to be completely happy with the 
relationship. You’re anxious to fix any problems that may arise. You really 
do care.
Yes, we know it sounds kind of sappy when you say it out loud, but implicitly, 
it’s powerful stuff.
The mere fact that you’re soliciting your customers’ honest opinions about 
your business tells them a lot about what kind of company you run. This also 
flatters them to know that their thoughts and feelings count. In short, these 
kinds of surveys are worth their weight in relationship gold.
Creating effective customer surveys
Here are the three steps to get a productive satisfaction survey up and running:
 
1. Choose the right timing for your surveys based on how often your cus-
tomers use your products or services.
 
 Restaurants, for example, often have comment cards placed at each 
table or included with each customer’s bill in one of those snappy little 
faux-leather folders. An event-planning business, on the other hand, may 
be hired by a given customer only once or twice a year — or maybe only 
once every few years — so sending that customer a monthly survey 
wouldn’t make any sense. In that case, a survey given to the customer 
right after an event with another one sent out six months later would be 
the best approach.

306
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
2. Include questions in your survey that are specific enough to address 
the survey goals but open-ended enough to encourage customers to 
answer fully.
 
 Take the time to think through exactly what the goals of your survey are 
and then word your questions accordingly. If you’re a contractor who’s 
just finished building a house for someone, inquiring, “So how’d we do?” 
is just asking for a stream-of-consciousness answer that’s unlikely to 
give you the specific guidance you’re after. Better to ask: “Was our roof-
ing work up to your expectations? If not, please tell us why.”
 
3. Plan and execute a follow-up to the survey that acknowledges custom-
ers’ concerns and thanks them for their participation.
 
 Whether you conduct your survey by e-mail or phone, personally thank 
each customer who responded. Tell them how much you appreciate 
their time and effort in participating, and tell them that you’ve clearly 
heard the concerns they expressed and are making the necessary 
changes to fix things. And then, of course, make the necessary changes 
to fix things.
Many business owners avoid conducting surveys out of fear that they’ll just 
get a lot of bad news — and then have to actually do something about it. But 
if you’re one of those owners, figure out whether you’d rather know what’s 
going on while there’s still time to solve any problems or whether you want 
to just gradually lose your customers altogether.
Doing surveys on the Web
Consider including a satisfaction survey form 
on your Web site or providing a special e-mail 
address on your e-newsletters that customers 
can use to give you feedback. In either case, 
the goal is to make it as easy as possible for 
customers to praise or critique your business. 
The fact that using the Web can also make it a 
lot easier for you to conduct your surveys is just 
icing on the cake.
Here are some great online resources, each 
geared to the needs of small businesses, which 
can help you create and distribute your online 
surveys:
 ✓ SurveyMonkey.com: For the Pro subscrip-
tion rate of $19.95 a month, you can send an 
unlimited number of surveys and receive up 
to 1,000 responses per month. This is obvi-
ously a terrific choice for companies with 
a large mailing list or companies that want 
to mount several different surveys over 
the course of a year, for instance. (www.
surveymonkey.com)
 ✓ SurveyGizmo: Similar to SurveyMonkey.
com, these folks offer options ranging from 
free surveys to paid plans. The latter plans 
gives you not just survey capabilities, but 
also the ability to send e-mail invitations

Rewarding Customers for Their Business
Customers want to feel valued by the local businesses they deal with. If you 
don’t offer them positive reinforcement and instead treat them as disposable 
commodities, don’t be surprised if those customers start shopping only on 
the basis of price. After all, you’ve given them no deeper reason to be loyal to 
your company.
A far more productive and profitable way to do business is to reward your 
customers on a regular basis. Do that, and price alone will stop being their 
only decision factor.
Luring new customers to your business is expensive, and the money you 
spend to do so won’t necessarily produce any incremental business. 
to events, as well as providing integra-
tion with Facebook and other social media 
(pretty much all of the features a local busi-
ness might need are available for $49). You 
can use SurveyGizmo for just one month 
at a time if you want, with no obligation 
to sign up for longer periods. The figure in 
this sidebar shows a sample survey from 
SurveyGizmo. (www.surveygizmo.com)
 ✓ Zoomerang: This company features free 
and paid packages. A Pro version lets you 
send surveys in several languages, with no 
limit at all on the number of responses you 
can receive. (www.zoomerang.com)
 ✓ SNAPPOLL.com: This outfit offers you an 
easy (and free) way to put a one-question 
survey on your Web site. Respondents 
aren’t required to sign up to participate, you 
can customize the colors on your survey 
form, and the service can block multiple 
votes from the same person. (www.snap
poll.com)
 ✓ Advanced Survey: This company offers both 
free and paid services that provide Web-
page and e-mail surveys. In the latter case, 
you invite participants to take part in the 
survey via e-mail. You can ask multiple ques-
tions in a single survey, as well as yes/no 
questions and open-ended text questions. 
You can also use customized numeric-scale 
questions (Rate X on a scale of 1 to 10, and 
so on) and multiple-choice answer formats.

Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
Programs that reward existing customers, on the other hand, can deliver a 
strong return on investment (ROI). Here are two reasons why:
 
✓ Incentives, or rewards, not only inspire customers to return to you, but 
also encourage them to tell other people about your business. That 
word of mouth can generate a new wave of potential buyers. In effect, 
you’re acquiring new customers, even though your expenditure is tar-
geted only at current ones.
 
✓ Incentives reinforce your relationship in a way that can prevent custom-
ers from taking their business to your competitors, even if those com-
petitors make lower price offers.
Promotions that perform online
Several kinds of promotional strategies can reward your customers through 
cost-effective online (and offline) tactics:
 
✓ Pre-purchase discounts: Get a 10 Percent Discount When You Pre-
Purchase a Series of Exercise Classes is a good example of this tech-
nique. Pre-purchase discounts are generally both affordable and 
cash-flow positive. You can put money in the bank now, the benefit of 
the discount is immediately (and attractively) apparent to the customer, 
and if she fails to use all the products or services she’s signed up for . . . 
well, your profit margins get that much better.
 
✓ Cash reward after reaching a purchase level: You offer an $X credit 
when the customer has purchased a certain amount of your product or 
service. This can both increase your sales and keep your customers just 
the way you want them: loyal.
 
✓ One free after reaching a purchase or service level: Offering free prod-
ucts or services is a bit less motivating to customers than a cash reward, 
but it can still be quite effective. An example is Get a Free Fall Cleanup 
When You Buy a Summer Lawn Service Contract.
 
✓ Discounts for planning ahead: Book a Room at Our B&B for a Winter 
Weekend Getaway and Save 15 Percent on Your Stay. This sort of thing 
works well for businesses whose sales are seasonal or otherwise follow 
a predictable up-and-down cycle. Provide discounts that encourage pur-
chases during those otherwise quiet times of year, and you may wind up 
boosting your future in-season sales as well.
 
✓ Other gifts, upgrades, and special treatment: Giving extras to your 
most loyal customers may cost you relatively little, but it can have a big 
impact. For a restaurant, this may involve offering a free dessert with 
every entrée (though not served at the same time because that would 
be gross). For a boutique, this might mean giving free alterations with 
any dress purchase. The byword here is bonuses — and customers love 
them.

309
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
Promoting the program
Simply put, the key to promoting customer rewards is integration. Make sure 
you promote your incentive program at every customer touch point. Get the 
word out via direct mail (such as a postcard), via your Web site, via e-mail, 
and/or via social media. Some businesses make a point of including incentive 
information with every sales receipt they hand to a customer. And of course, 
your regular advertisements and online PR efforts should hit the incentives 
as well. One other thing: Make sure your staff and everyone else who inter-
acts with customers actively promotes the program.
Measuring your results
As for practically everything else in your marketing arsenal, measuring the 
results of your reward programs is indispensable. First, of course, you need 
to set realistic goals for your program. Then on a regular basis (no shirking 
allowed), measure increases in your sales to existing customers and in your 
revenue. Modify or abandon incentives that are underperforming, and stick 
with those that are working well. You know the drill.
 
Some businesses just flat refuse to believe that rewards work. “We’re not in 
the business of giving away things” is a too-common sentiment. If your com-
petitors feel the same way, you’re golden. But if you’re one of those reluctant 
business owners, simply remember the airlines. Their frequent flyer programs 
are so effective at generating repeat business that you’d be hard-pressed to 
find one that doesn’t offer this incentive. Granted, your business is probably 
a good deal smaller than one with a fleet of planes, but the principle is exactly 
the same — what’s different is the scale.
Reveling in referral e-mail programs
Referral e-mail programs — also known as viral e-mail, pass-along e-mail, or 
e-mail that includes a Tell a Friend feature — are another easy way to reward 
existing customers while also acquiring new ones. Best of all, this kind of 
e-mail message can propagate quickly as it’s forwarded from person to 
person. Figure 16-2 shows a sample of a Tell a Friend referral e-mail form.
Seeing how (and why) they work
Referral programs generally involve nothing more than the offer of some 
kind of reward or other enticement to a loyal customer in return for that cus-
tomer’s recommending your business to a potential new customer. In effect, 
referral programs are another cost-effective way of drawing new customers 
to your company — and far more cost-effective than marketing cold to a pool 
of unknown prospects.

310
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
Figure 16-2: 
A mocked-
up referral 
e-mail form.
 
Referral marketing is so effective because people listen to their friends, 
respect their advice, and then act on it. When someone you’ve never seen 
before walks into your store and says, “My friend was in here recently and 
bought one of your professional-strength doodads, and she loves it; I’d like 
one, too,” you’re about to make a very easy sale.
And here’s another wrinkle (as though anyone needs more of those): When 
you send a referral e-mail that rewards customers for passing the message 
along to their friends, that message needs to include a link that lets the 
passee sign up to be on your mailing list, which is a great way to grow that 
list without doing much of anything.
Producing referral e-mails
Putting together a referral e-mail program isn’t difficult, particularly if you’re 
already working with an e-mail service provider of the sort we discuss in 
Chapter 10. These providers typically offer all the features and functionality 
you need to implement your referral campaign, including the following:
 
✓ A Forward link that appears on all your outgoing e-mail messages.
 
✓ A Forward to a Friend feature that links directly to your Web site.
 
✓ A Subscribe Me link that appears in all forwarded messages so the 
recipient can opt-in to your mailing list.
As for the content of your referral e-mail messages, that’s pretty easy, too. 
Something like, Get Five Friends to Sign Up for a Swedish Massage, and 
Receive a 20 Percent Discount on Your Next Visit should do nicely.

311
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
Good ol’ human nature is at least partly responsible for the success of simple 
referral programs. Humans have a primordial desire to know more than the 
next guy, an earnest desire to do nice things for their friends, and a natural 
hunger to acquire new knowledge. At the intersection of these three desires 
lies the potential for profit. The customer who refers feels like a bit of an 
expert and gets a nice reward. The customer who gets referred discovers 
something useful, helpful, self-improving, and so on. And you — you lucky 
fellow human and business owner — have managed to both promote cus-
tomer loyalty and pick up new business.
Capitalizing on contests and giveaways
 
Come on, who doesn’t like the prospect of getting something for nothing? 
Nobody, that’s who. And although most would probably prefer to win an enor-
mous pile of cash, you’re also pleased to win smaller prizes, too. That’s why 
online contests and giveaways are great ways to increase your marketing vis-
ibility, drive traffic to your Web site, and build sales leads.
First, we want to distinguish the two techniques (contests and giveaways). 
A contest rewards someone for doing something of merit. They’ve written 
the best essay, taken the most beautiful photograph, submitted the tastiest 
recipe, or made the best guess as to the average height of a North American 
beaver dam. A giveaway, or sweepstakes, on the other hand, picks winners 
purely by luck of the draw.
Prize-wise (which, incidentally, is kind of fun to say out loud), you can award 
winners with something as simple as a sticker or a T-shirt, on up to some-
thing of appreciable value, like free merchandise or free services.
Knowing why you need to use them
You’ll find lots of excellent reasons for using contests and giveaways to 
reward your customers, and maybe attract some new ones, too. Contests and 
giveaways
 
✓ Create buzz about your product or service. They get people talking 
about your business and what you sell.
 
✓ Promote Web site visits. Your related hope is that the person who visits 
and enters the contest or giveaway also sticks around to investigate all 
the products and/or services you offer.
 
✓ Help build up your e-mail list. While you’re asking a prospect for per-
mission to send him e-mails, you can quite naturally strike up a conver-
sation that can plant the seeds of a good customer relationship.

312
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
✓ Strengthen existing customer relationships. By creating a sense of fun 
and a small adventure, you can implicitly inform customers about your 
products while you’re entertaining them.
 
✓ Generate great advertising content. This is especially true for contests. 
When customers submit photos, recipes, or essays that involve your 
products or services, you can use the submissions later (with the custom-
er’s permission, of course) in your advertising campaign. For example:
 
• A dentist might create a contest whereby her patients send in photos 
in hopes of winning the Best Smile prize. The winner might get a 
year’s worth of free teeth cleanings (which is nothing to spit at), 
while the dentist uses the Best Smile photograph for self-promotion 
on her Web site or in her online ads.
 
• A café’s contest might offer a free meal to the person who writes 
the most glowing (and honest) review of the restaurant on say, 
Yelp. This can only help boost the café’s search engine marketing 
efforts, besides impressing would-be diners who come across the 
review.
Pondering before plunging in
If you’re considering launching a contest or giveaway, take a moment to con-
sider the following:
 
✓ What your goal is: Are you hoping to involve your customers and pros-
pects in the naming of your new product or service offering or in deciding 
on the best place to open a new location? Are you looking to generate cus-
tomer video testimonials for your Web site? Or will you be happy just to 
build your e-mail list? Structure your promotion accordingly.
 
✓ What the prize should be: The prize you offer needs to be somehow 
related to your business. (A shoe store offering a free meal at the burger-
joint down the street is, by definition, one clueless shoe store.)
 
 The whole point of the promotion is to increase your sales, so it only 
makes sense to choose a prize that will attract people who already have 
some degree of interest in your products or services. The bottom line: 
Choose a prize that your average customers would just love to buy. 
Even if he doesn’t win, you’ve probably whet his appetite, and he may 
well come back and actually buy whatever it is later.
 
✓ How you can advertise your promotion online: Online promotions are 
a terrific way to generate sales leads. Whether you’re promoting the 
promotion via e-mail, newsgroups, social media, and/or directly on your 
Web site, you’re giving people a reason to visit your site — and you can 
use these hits to harvest new names for your leads list. Ask the partici-
pants to opt-in to your future e-mails, updates, postal mailings, or what-
ever it is that best suits you. Then, set about converting these leads into 
customers.

313
 Chapter 16: Staying at the Top of Customers’ Minds
 
✓ How to set up the contest rules on your Web site: Contests and give-
aways absolutely must have their rules stated clearly. This is the law, 
and the applicable statutes vary by state. You can usually find the legal 
requirements for the type of promotion you’re planning online but when 
in doubt, find an attorney who can advise you.
 
 Even though you’ve included all the impenetrable legal jargon that 
you’re required to use, also put the rules in understandable layman’s 
terms. This information includes things like what people need to do to 
enter, any restrictions that apply, when the prize(s) will be rewarded, 
and even, in some states, what the actual odds of winning are. Don’t skip 
this step unless you think it’s really, really fun to be really, really fined.
 
✓ How to notify the winners: This isn’t much of a hurdle. Send the contest 
or giveaway winners an e-mail, send a letter, phone them, or do all three. 
Just don’t forget to notify them. (People running promotions occasion-
ally do forget to do this, and it’s unforgiveable.) Be sure to ask the win-
ners whether it’s okay for you to post their names and photos on your 
Web site. Not only is this exposure a giggle for them, but it also proves 
to your contest participants that you were completely on the up-and-up 
with the promotion.
Some prize suggestions 
(in both senses of the phrase)
Need a little help in coming up with the perfect 
prize? Well, we can’t promise perfection, but 
here are some good thought-starters:
 ✓ A month’s worth of your product or service 
free of charge
 ✓ A free consultation and/or evaluation
 ✓ For pet stores, a year’s worth of dog food
 ✓ For health clubs, a free 6-week membership
 ✓ For a chiropractor, a free massage with a 
(paid) new-patient exam
 ✓ For a dentist, a free teeth-whitening kit with 
a new-patient exam
 ✓ For a florist, 12 months of free roses
 ✓ For an electronics store, a free flat-
screen TV
 ✓ For a travel agency, a free weekend’s stay 
at the casino down the road (and there 
always seems to be a casino down the 
road)
 ✓ A donation of $1,000 to the charity of the 
winner’s choice (yes, this is generic, but it’s 
also a great way to present your company 
as a caring, sharing kind of hero — plus it’s 
just a darned nice thing to do)
And so on . . .

Leveraging Customer Data: 
Reach Out and Touch ’Em
In This Chapter
▶ Examining the customer data you’ve accumulated
▶ Learning how to segment your customers
▶ Personalizing your communications
▶ Maintaining your marketing tools and techniques
M
any times throughout this book, we stress the importance of capturing 
customer information. You get that information from the contact 
form on your Web site, the sign-up (or opt-in) form on your landing page, or 
even from the virtual phone service that logs inbound phone numbers when 
you aren’t around to retrieve them. When you put together all that customer 
data, chances are you’ll discover you’ve accumulated piles of it. So then what 
do you do? Leverage that data; use it to build stronger customer relationships 
and thereby increase your sales . . . which, after all, is the name of the game. 
This concept is database marketing; whatever you call it, adopt this extremely 
important tactic.
This chapter tells you how to do just that. And though you can certainly 
contact your customers through many channels (including offline ones), we 
concentrate on e-mail marketing — with good reason. E-mail is one of the 
most cost-effective ways to communicate with customers. E-mail’s effectiveness 
goes beyond cost because it allows you to personalize the messages you 
send to your customers. You won’t find a better method of maintaining and 
strengthening your customer relationships than e-mail.
Years ago — when e-mail marketing was in its squalling infancy — a generic 
e-mail message sent to all customers was more than enough to get a healthy 
response rate. The whole idea of e-mail was new and exotic then, and people 
wanted to fool around with it.

316
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
With today’s consumers, the novelty of receiving e-mail has worn off. Many 
people get hundreds of e-mails every day and read only the best-conceived 
and best-presented ones. As with other facets of online advertising (for example, 
landing pages), relevance is the key to having your business’ e-mails opened, 
read, and acted on.
Mining the Gold in Your Data
Marketing types have lots of little sayings, one of which is: “The money is in 
the list.” That sounds (and is) kind of trite, but it’s also 100 percent true.
Having an active and up-to-date customer database is simply and undeniably 
one of the most important assets a successful business can have. The market 
niche you serve or how big (or small) your company is doesn’t matter; the 
fact remains that your data is a potential goldmine.
 
Your customer database doesn’t have to be anything fancy. In many cases, 
depending on the specifics of your business, a simple Excel spreadsheet 
suffices (see Figure 17-1).
 
Figure 17-1: 
A simple 
customer 
database in

Excel.
 

317
 Chapter 17: Leveraging Customer Data: Reach Out and Touch ‘Em
Happily, you can work wonders with even the most basic customer data, with 
items as mundane as
 
✓ First and last names
 
✓ E-mail addresses
 
✓ Phone numbers
 
✓ City, state, and zip codes
 
✓ The dates when customers became customers
 
✓ The offer(s) customers responded to
 
✓ Customers’ purchasing history
 
A solid customer database (including a well-maintained e-mail list) can work 
for you in both good and bad times. When business is clicking along nicely, 
your data gives you an already-compiled, no-brainer, go-to stockpile of likely 
customers for your newest product, service, offer, or other promotion. 
But your database also proves invaluable in times of crisis or other radical 
change. When the economy goes blooey, for instance, people look not so 
much for what’s new as for what’s truly valuable for solving one or more of 
their real-world problems or frustrations. That value comes from a business 
that customers already know and trust. In the not-so-good times, your 
customer database gives you a powerful way to ride to the rescue.
Giving Customers More 
of What They Want
The database of customer information you collect doesn’t do much good 
just sitting there. You need to exploit the living daylights out of it by using 
the information to put you in front of your customer’s digital face with the 
most relevant possible message at the best possible moment. Although this 
strategy sounds logical and straightforward, applying it requires some solid 
thought, planning, and execution. Understanding particular online marketing 
practices helps you through this process. To be specific:
 
✓ Database segmentation, whether by age, income, address, or whatever 
other criteria you think are most important, helps you target your 
recipients efficiently.
 
✓ Personalization helps you create messages that are directly relevant to 
your customers’ needs, wants or interests.

318
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
✓ Attention to timeliness gives your message a fighting chance at actually 
being read because you’ve timed it to show up when (or just before) 
your customer is ready to make a buying decision.
Targeting with segmentation
Not everyone in your database is a proper target for a particular kind of 
e-mail message. Some of your customers are young, and some aren’t; some 
are affluent, and some not so much; some are regular buyers, and some buy 
only occasionally; and so on. Accounting for this diversity is why you need to 
use segmentation, which separates customers into target groups defined by 
specific, shared characteristics.
 
The segmentation criteria are almost infinitely flexible, so you can reformulate 
them whenever you find it necessary. For example, a country club might 
segment its list when it wants to send a scramble offer to golfers in one week, 
and re-segment that same list to send a meetings and events message to its 
business customers.
You need to have a couple prerequisites in place before you start the 
segmentation process:
 
✓ Your e-mail marketing strategy: For example, you know whether you 
plan to send periodic e-mails, e-newsletters, special events mailings, or 
some combination of the three. (See Chapter 10 for more about e-mail 
strategies and campaigns.)
 
 Always keep in mind that whatever kind of e-mail you decide to send 
must be relevant to the segment you’re addressing. Failure to make sure 
of that will leave you sending a lot of e-mails that never get opened.
 
✓ Data about your customers’ interests: Start with the kinds of products 
and services they’ve bought already from you. Your sales and ordering 
processes help you collect this information. (Check out Chapter 5 for 
information on capturing customer information through your Web site.)
Outlining your segmentation criteria
Each customer is a unique individual, but can still be identified as a distinctive 
type of purchaser. Every business can segment its customer base into broad 
categories. For example, you probably have customers who deal with you all 
the time, some who do so occasionally, and others who buy from you rarely. 
By using this criterion to group your customers, you’re segmenting based on 
sales frequency, which is a good place to start.

319
 Chapter 17: Leveraging Customer Data: Reach Out and Touch ‘Em
 
Sales frequency is one way to break down your customer list. Another 
(and coincidentally, rhyming) criterion that savvy e-mail marketers use for 
segmentation is recency — how recently a given customer bought from you. 
Targeting these folks falls squarely in the Striking While the Iron’s Hot category 
because your business is definitely top-of-mind for them. Also consider adding 
the monetary value of each customer’s purchase(s) as a segmentation criterion. 
Those people who are frequent, recent, and high-ticket buyers become your 
VIPs, or preferred customers, who deserve extra courting, stroking, and 
sustaining with interesting and valuable-offer e-mails.
Some other simple segmentations apply to most businesses. You can 
segment by
 
✓ Customer zip codes: This segmentation is useful if you’re trying to 
boost sales specifically at one of your business’s locations, or if you’re 
interested in segmenting on the basis of income or property size.
 
✓ Customers’ birth months: You can micro-segment your mailing list this 
way and offer special gifts or discounts during each individual’s special 
month.
 
✓ Known customer preferences: You can segment based on what items 
customers have clicked in your previous e-newsletters.
 
✓ Obvious customer attributes: Characteristics, such as age or gender, 
can help you target a specific group of customers.
Having made these simple distinctions, think about what other segments 
make sense for your particular business and then target your communications 
to those segments. Some examples to illustrate include
 
✓ A garden nursery can e-mail its residential customers about new spring 
plantings and its commercial customers about the availability of bulk 
mulch.
 
✓ A cosmetics boutique can e-mail one discount coupon to customers who 
buy makeup and another to those who buy skin-care products.
 
✓ A financial services firm might e-mail its tax-preparation clients a timely 
IRS filing reminder, while its financial planning clients get e-mails about 
rebalancing their portfolios.
 
✓ A sporting goods store may send one kind of mailing to ski bums, while 
tailoring a different one to tennis buffs.
 
After you delineate patterns of interest, demographics, frequency, recency, 
expenditure levels, and other criteria among your customers, you can tailor 
your e-mails’ subject lines and content to each segment. Creating unique 
e-mail messages for different groups takes some work, but a good template-
based e-mail marketing tool can make that a lot easier to pull off. The e-mail 
service providers (ESPs) we talk about in Chapter 10 can often provide you 
with excellent templates.

320
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
Doing it (kind of) backward
Some businesses flip around the segmentation process and let e-mail do the 
segmenting for them. Suppose you have customers who don’t specify their 
particular interests when they sign up to be on your mailing list (many times, 
they don’t). Send them an e-newsletter or two that covers a wide variety of 
different (presumably relevant) subjects and then using your reporting data, 
take a look at which customers bite on what subjects.
Evaluating e-mail response results identifies customer groups who have, in 
effect, self-segmented — a process that can save you a good deal of educated 
guesswork.
 
In addition to segmenting, e-mail marketing can produce some very useful 
metrics. An often-used metric is your open rates, which tells you how many of 
your recipients almost always open your e-mails, how many do so only rarely, 
and how many never take a look. Here’s what these numbers direct you to do:
 
✓ Take the last group of folks (those who never look) off your radar 
screen and out of your e-mail list.
 
✓ Send your hardly-ever-open customers a polite e-mail that identifies 
whether (or how) they want to be contacted. Such a message helps 
you find out whether they’d prefer to be taken off your list, have contact 
through a different channel (such as direct mail), or whatever other 
scenario makes sense in your business. The point is to get this group 
off the fence. If they bail on you, so be it. That doesn’t mean the bailers 
aren’t still customers, just that they aren’t your el primo customers, and 
you can curtail your efforts to inspire them with e-mail.
 
✓ Start treating the almost-always-open people like royalty. Concentrate 
your efforts on your liveliest of live wires now, so be creative in your 
approaches and generous in your offers. Make sure that every e-mail 
you send to this group is really, really good at informing, benefiting, and 
even just plain old flattering them.
Personalizing your targeted message
Personalization, the process of tailoring specific elements of a given targeted 
message to individuals within a segment, enters the picture right after 
segmentation. First, formulate customer criteria to create segments and then 
get even more specific to sub-segment your segments.
Basic psychology reveals that people react differently when they’re being 
treated as unique and special individuals than when they’re being treated 
simply as part of a group. Needless to say (but we’re going to say it anyway), 
taking the unique-and-special approach to your customers is the hands-down 
winner when it comes to the fine art of persuasion.

321
 Chapter 17: Leveraging Customer Data: Reach Out and Touch ‘Em
Consequently, personalize your messages as much and as often as you can 
and proper segmentation goes a long way in making that possible. We 
recommend venturing beyond segmentation alone, into the realm of highly 
individualized messaging. The goal is to strengthen and reinforce the bond 
that exists (or should) between you and each of your customers.
Following are a few ways to personalize your messages:
 
✓ Salutations: Your initial greeting to a customer has a huge impact on 
whether that person goes on to read the rest of your communication. 
For a business-to-consumer e-mail, “Hi, Rosie” is just fine. For a business-
to-business message, however, stick with business-letter-type usage: 
“Dear, Rosie,” or “Dear, Rosie Sherman,” or “Dear, Ms. Sherman” (in 
descending order of familiarity) are the right ways to go.
 
✓ Product and service references: Include a reference to a specific 
product or service that the recipient has purchased already from you or 
about which that person has asked you a question. For example:
 
• How are you enjoying your new lawn mower?
 
• Thanks for letting us shampoo your rugs last Thursday
 
• I looked further into the capacity figures for that washing machine 
we discussed and . . .
 
 Including concrete product references is a great way, not only to sell, 
but also to cross-sell or upsell (selling a complimentary or additional set 
of products and services to someone who has already made a purchase). 
Follow up your question about the mower with a statement about a 
related product: “We also sell an extra-large grass-catcher for that 
mower.” Or follow up your thank you by expressing interest in providing 
other services: “We noticed a couple spots on your rugs that would 
probably benefit from steam-cleaning the next time.” Don’t be shy about 
trying this. Businesses do so all the time — and wisely include a link to 
the applicable landing page on their Web site — and it frequently works.
 
✓ Location: Alluding to your customer’s location is a proven way to give 
that person a sense of belonging. So, a limo company might observe, 
“Probably no one knows better than you just how crazy L.A.’s traffic can 
get.” An Italian restaurant could say, “Because you live in Chicago, you 
really know great pizza when you taste it. That’s why we’re offering . . .” 
Just be sure that your recipient does in fact live in the location you’re 
referencing. Duh.
 
✓ Affiliation: Another good bridge builder is a reference to a known 
group or organization your customer belongs to. “We’re currently 
offering a 25 percent discount to Chamber of Commerce members, such 
as yourself.” When you use this kind of personalization, take care that 
the relevance between your message and the person’s membership is 
super-obvious. Offering a good deal on pesticides to members of, say, 
the local Symphony Society just completely misses the connection and 
therefore the point.

322
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
✓ Images and multimedia: Images or multimedia pieces that tie into any 
other form of personalization can be devastatingly (in a good way) 
effective. This happens, for example, when your e-mail message uses 
images of the exact product the customer has recently bought from you. 
When you’re making an affiliation pitch, you could use the logo or seal 
of the organization the customer belongs to. This can even be as simple 
as incorporating an image of the skyline of Grand Rapids (and yes, it has 
one) in the e-mails you send to Grand Rapidians. In each case, you’re 
making a subtle but powerful connection between yourself and your 
customer as a flesh-and-blood person. And here again, as simple and 
obvious as the technique might sound, it works.
Instilling relevance and timeliness
For an e-mail to be compelling and actionable, it has to be about something — 
and probably to offer something — that the customer cares about. For 
example, if you own a pet store, e-mailing a special discount on a grooming 
appointment doesn’t mean much to a customer who only owns tropical fish. 
Fish are fun to look at, but they don’t need much in the way of brushing.
A sort of sub-facet of relevance is timeliness. Dog owners are likely to be most 
interested in grooming their pets in the spring, when Trixie’s winter coat 
starts coming out in handfuls. The grooming discount e-mail then will be far 
more effective if it’s timed accordingly.
Put together those two ideas together, and you get this mantra: Delivering an 
e-mail to the right person, with the right message, at the right time is critical to 
e-mail marketing success. Forrester Research reports that the combination 
of relevance and good timing is nearly as effective as discounting for driving 
conversions. On the other hand, the majority of consumers’ complaints 
about e-mail marketing overall stem from their receiving way too many 
irrelevant communications.
 
Timeliness in online marketing depends on the sort of message you’re send-
ing. A friendly confirmation sent immediately upon receiving an order is 
always good. Or try timing your reminder e-mail to arrive 30 days before the 
expiration date of a customer’s yearly service contract. Then you have the 
whole seasonal thing we allude to at the beginning of this section, or any 
number of other factors that can make the difference between your e-mail’s 
being well-received or immediately tossed. But don’t sweat it. You’re a suc-
cessful business person, and if anyone knows the best time to promote your 
products or services, you do. Just rely on your own experience.

 Chapter 17: Leveraging Customer Data: Reach Out and Touch ‘Em
Optimizing Your Outreach 
Tools and Techniques
Whether you know it yet, you probably already have a fair-sized mountain of 
customer information. Keeping all that info organized — and doing regular 
follow-up on it — has the potential to be an overwhelming job. You certainly 
can use Microsoft Office products, such as Excel and Access, to help you deal 
with all the data, but you may still find it hard to keep pace.
Fortunately, a number of tools and techniques exist that can take a big load 
off your shoulders. These can help you capture and organize your data, and 
generate the right e-mails at the right time without pulling you away from 
your day-to-day business tasks and obligations. Here are the main types of 
tools we’re talking about:
 
✓ ESP-designed databases: You can get these simple software applications 
(for not much money) from most ESPs, such as those we discuss in 
Chapter 10. The simplest of these ESP-designed database products 
typically handle segmentation and personalization duties.
 
✓ Full-featured customer databases: You can license contact and customer 
management software for a few hundred dollars from companies, such 
as Act! (www.act.com). Considering how much work this kind of 
customer relationship management (CRM) solution can save you, that’s 
hardly a steep investment.
 
✓ Professional ESP programs: Then again, if you’re really reluctant to step 
into the wonderful world of database marketing, you can hire an ESP to 
handle pretty much the whole process for you, although going this route 
isn’t likely to be cheap.
 
If you decide to outsource your database work to an ESP, be sure to keep a 
copy of all your customer data in your own possession. It’s very unlikely that 
the company you’re using will — how to put this tactfully? — mess up or lose 
your data, but stay on the safe side and hang onto a backup list.
Staying dynamic
To deliver a relevant, timely message, get comfortable with using dynamic 
(database-driven) content that’s driven by your customer database in order 
to make segmentation and personalization work for you. After you get your 
database and marketing tools in place, you’ll be positioned to markedly 
improve your sales.

324
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
So how do you learn from your customers and incorporate what you learn 
into your dynamic marketing efforts? You can
 
✓ Uncover customer patterns and trends: Use an e-mail marketing 
database to develop a picture of your customers’ characteristics, 
including which are most loyal and which are most likely to defect. 
Here’s a good indicator: People who regularly open your monthly 
e-newsletter probably fall into the faithful-and-true category; while 
those who don’t, well, don’t.
 
 After you identify a potential defector, you can do something special 
to keep him in the fold. You can, for example, reach out to him with a 
particularly well-crafted e-mail that offers something above and beyond 
one of your normal deals — an extra-big discount comes to mind. And 
remember that you’re only offering it to a very small fraction of your 
customer base, so it’s really not likely to screw up your cash flow.
 
✓ Improve the impact of your communications: Data-driven e-mail 
messages that speak directly to a customer as an individual won’t only 
be more welcomed by your recipient, but will also help build loyalty 
and grease the skids for future sales. A good first step is to personalize 
your greeting: Dear, Larry carries much more weight than Dear, Valued 
Customer. Another smart move is to ask your customers how they want 
to hear from you in the future. Find out whether they prefer e-mail, 
phone, or regular mail, and whether they want to receive your monthly 
newsletter. Then make sure you store these answers in your database to 
drive your next communication.
 
✓ Refine your prospecting: Create a prospect database to segment out 
those customers who, for whatever reason, are consistently unresponsive. 
Then give it one more good, old college try. Offer them something 
attractive (maybe a free copy of a report on a timely topic that you know 
should interest them) and ask them to respond. If you still don’t register 
a heartbeat, it’s probably safe to move them into your Yeah-well-maybe-
someday pile, which you’ll get around to revisiting . . . that’s right — 
maybe someday.
Uncovering patterns and trends
Listen carefully at a business’s door — especially during tough economic 
times — and you can hear the sound of numbers being crunched as the 
owners obsess over targeting their best potential customers with every 
possible efficiency of cost, time, and effort. Carefully ferreting out trends and 
patterns is an excellent way to identify those customers and determine what 
they want.

325
 Chapter 17: Leveraging Customer Data: Reach Out and Touch ‘Em
Some of the most valuable statistics you can gather are the response 
numbers that roll in after you send an e-mail blast. Pore over them carefully 
and look for the following:
 
✓ Offers that are particularly effective in generating responses: Say you 
own a golf course and club that hosts a lot of destination weddings. 
You may notice that your prospecting e-mails are getting a measurably 
better-than-usual response rate just after Christmas when many 
engagements take place. So tailor your messages accordingly — and 
shower (pun intended) brides-to-be with relevant information right after 
New Year’s because that’s when they’ll be thinking about setting the 
date and finding a great place for their reception.
 
✓ Clues that help you pick out precisely the customers (or at least, the 
kind of customers) who will respond most eagerly to a follow-up 
mailing: Maybe you do in-home catering, and you find that women 
respond to your e-mails more frequently than men. This may tell you 
something important about your audience — as in, who your primary 
purchasers really are and to whom you should then target your next 
round of e-mails.
 
✓ Specific content that seems to be driving more and better responses 
than other content: For example, maybe you’re a landscaper who 
discovers that sending quarterly e-newsletters containing lawn-
care information about the upcoming season draw 20 percent more 
responses than those that discuss say, the care and feeding of African 
Violets or Coast Rhododendrons. This statistic tells you that you need 
to make a disciplined effort to always stay ahead of the next season in 
the information you e-mail, even if those lovely rhododendrons have to 
take something of a back seat.
Doing this kind of simple but careful analysis helps you better understand 
who your customers are and what pushes their buttons. Then, armed with 
that information, you can sharpen your efforts to an ever-finer point — and 
pull in ever-greater amounts of business.
Keeping a clean e-mail list
In the online marketing world, where just about everything comes with its 
own slightly over-the-top terminology, there actually is a list hygiene concept. 
All this really means is keeping your e-mail list up-to-date, accurate, and 
well-organized. Some of the basic principles are

326
Part IV: Keeping Your Customers Coming Back 
 
✓ Take any removal requests off your list immediately. E-mailing 
someone after they’ve already told you not to is a good way, in some 
states at least, to get into legal trouble. And even if the authorities don’t 
come gunning for you, the customer in question gets royally ticked off — 
so you lose either way. Better to just deep-six anyone who wants off 
your list.
 
✓ Make sure you have each recipient’s correct name as well as the right 
name of the recipient’s company (if any). You can easily stumble over 
this if you’ve collected business cards at a trade show or networking 
event and then manually entered the information from those cards 
into your database. Typos have a nasty way of rearing their ulgy heads 
(see?). The situation can get even worse if you’re pulling names off a 
trade show or event list where people quickly wrote their names, and 
you can’t make out their handwriting.
 
 Whatever the cause of the mistake, there’s no bigger, immediate turnoff 
to e-mail recipients than having their names misspelled in the address 
line. You might as well address the message to Dear, I Don’t Really Give 
a Rat’s Tooter about You. Be almost maniacally careful about entering 
customer names into your database.
 
✓ Always remove duplicate entries, especially when you’re sending to 
more than one of your lists at the same time. People hate getting 
multiple, identical e-mails. Of course, if a customer has for some reason 
given you more than one e-mail address when signing up for your list, 
that’s her problem.
 
✓ Don’t just automatically pull a name off your list after you’ve received 
a Delivery Failure message. At least, don’t do so after only getting one 
such bounce. Recipients’ inboxes get full, servers go down, and other 
gremlins can sneak into the picture, so the address you used may still be 
perfectly valid, just used at an inopportune moment. If you get three or 
four of these bounces on the same address, however, take the name off 
your list.
 
Engaging in all these hygienic practices is extremely important because you’ll 
want to have an accurate number of good addresses before you start tracking 
the performance metrics of your e-mail effort. Including a bunch of dead ends 
in your database will only undermine the usefulness of the statistics you 
ultimately get.

Ten Local Online 
Marketing Mistakes 
(And How to Avoid Them)
T
his foray into the world of online advertising is kind of a grand adventure. 
Although there is clearly a beaten path that you need to follow to 
maximize your chances for success, at times, you’ll see your efforts come up 
short and wonder: What the heck am I doing wrong?
In a lot of cases, the fault isn’t so much with the execution, but with the 
thinking or preconceptions. Because these things are part and parcel of your 
inner self, they can be really hard to recognize as the actual culprits when 
your efforts aren’t having the results you want.
In our experience, many people make certain mental errors when launching 
themselves into the online arena — and in this chapter, we list the ten most 
common.
Assuming Your Customers 
Behave Like You
Maybe you’re a 25-year-old running online marketing for a retirement 
community. Just because you go to the blogosphere before you buy 
any products or services doesn’t mean that your target audience does. 
Conversely, you might be a 70-year-old dentist, and you think the Internet is 
just a fad. You need to think the way customers think and figure how they 
find businesses. No matter what your mom told you, in this case, don’t be 
yourself.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Not Knowing Your Limits
You can create your own Web site, do search engine optimization (SEO), 
and run your own pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns. That’s one of the reasons 
books like this exist. However, to do these things right, you need to spend an 
appropriate amount of time on them. That means that the five minutes you 
spend monthly on your PPC campaign may not be enough, and consequently, 
you’re wasting money that could just as well go to pay someone to take care 
of your local online advertising for you. Think hard about whether you’ll 
make an ongoing commitment to optimizing your advertising campaigns. If 
not, maybe the best thing to do is go with the pros.
Assuming Web Site Aesthetics 
Equals Web Site Success
You may think all the frames, flash, and images you’ve put on your Web site 
look great. Unfortunately, that great stuff is all but invisible to the search 
engines. Like Joe Friday, search engines want only the facts. The subjective 
stuff on your site can be a lot of fun to create, but if content on your Web site 
can’t even be read by the search engines, you aren’t even in the game. Think 
like a search engine does. Make sure you have
 
✓ A search engine–friendly URL
 
✓ A site map (or site index)
 
✓ Contact information on every page
 
✓ Keyword-rich copy
 
✓ Footers
 
✓ Reciprocal links
In other words, position yourself to be found before you worry about being 
impressive. And when in doubt, test and learn.
Creating a Web Site That No One Visits
If you build it, they will come, right? Wrong. Just because you have a Web site 
doesn’t mean anyone will go there. To get people to your site, you need to 
drive traffic — whether that means using SEO, PPC, e-mails, banners, or some 
of the other tools we talk about in this book. The moral of the story: Give 
people a road; then they will come.

331
 Chapter 18: Ten Local Online Marketing Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)
Making It Difficult for Potential 
Customers to Contact You
You’d be surprised how many local business Web sites we see that don’t 
even show the phone number. Or the contact information is buried deep 
down the Contact Us page. Your phone number (or however you want your 
potential customers to contact you) needs to be large and in charge on your 
Web site. Throw an easy-to-fill-out form on your page, too. That way potential 
customers who don’t want to call still have a way to contact you.
Caring Too Much about How 
Many People Visit Your Site
This may at first seem contrary to the mistake of creating a Web site that no 
one visits, but it isn’t. True, you need people to go to your site to get sales, 
but not all site visitors are equal. You can waste a lot of money paying vendors 
or directories for meaningless clicks that don’t convert into new customers. 
This is especially important to remember when you use something like PPC. 
Sometimes you’re better off to pay a premium for expensive keyword search 
terms instead of driving a lot traffic that represents only traffic — and no sales.
Having Google Tunnel Vision
Yes, Google is the most important search engine by a long shot. We know 
this, you know this, and so do all your competitors. Although the most traffic 
is on Google, it isn’t unusual for other search engines and directories to have 
more cost-efficient ways to drive traffic. When possible, the best strategy 
is to test a variety of sites (including Google) and see which one ultimately 
works best for your business.
Not Knowing whether Your Marketing 
Is Really Working
One of the greatest things about online advertising is that it’s so measurable. 
The rub, of course, is that measuring takes work. But the payoff will be 
well worth it because you can focus your ad dollars on those channels and 
methods that work while cutting the fat out of your budget.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Arguably, the best five things for you to measure are
 
✓ Traffic numbers (the number of visitors you get)
 
✓ Conversion rates
 
✓ Your cost per lead
 
✓ Your cost per acquisition
 
✓ Your return on investment
You can keep track of other things as well, such as how long visitors from 
particular channels stay on your site, but the five items here tell you what 
you most need to know.
Not Getting Sales from Calls
Your phone rings off the hook, but you still aren’t getting any new customers. 
What could be wrong? For starters, answer your phone! According to a 
survey by FastCall411 of 5,000 local businesses, approximately two-thirds of 
incoming calls to local businesses go unanswered. What’s more, a study by 
market research firm Synovate found that four out of five Americans regard 
immediate availability by phone as an important — or the most important — 
factor when selecting a local service provider. In the end, not picking up 
your phone is akin to taking that cash that you paid for your advertising and 
throwing it into a bonfire. Additionally, make sure that you or your staff 
handles those calls with the utmost care. After all, those people on the other 
end of the line have your future in their hands.
Not Doing Any Loyalty/Retention 
Marketing
Getting new customers is far more expensive than keeping existing ones. 
Make sure you’re doing everything you can to take care of the ones you have. 
Keep in touch via an e-mail newsletter or offer them occasional special deals. 
Today’s online tools make that sort of thing easy to do. So do it!

Chapter 19
Ten Steps to an Ef  fective Local 
Online Adver  tising Plan
L
ocal online advertising can take many different forms. But one thing it 
absolutely can’t be is a headless horseman. Similarly, the old idea of 
throwing a bunch of stuff up against the wall to see what sticks will wind up 
giving you nothing but a really dirty wall. No, your online advertising has to 
have a purpose, a mission . . . in other words, a plan.
This chapter takes you through the steps to make sure that what you’re 
doing has all those things — the better to give you something to measure 
your success against and to help you plan the next steps your online 
advertising campaign should take.
Committing to the Planning Process
The old saying, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail,” is kind of tacky and trite, 
but it’s also tried and true. You can’t afford to forget it when you prepare to 
design and launch your local online advertising campaign because
 
✓ Your online efforts are too important to leave to ad-libbing. After all, the 
continued health and growth of your business are at stake here.
 
✓ A successful online campaign will usually have a lot of moving parts — 
parts that act separately and in concert to make the whole thing work 
to your benefit. Try to fix one particular element on the fly, and another 
element is likely to go haywire. Keep a close eye on the big picture and 
refrain from adjusting things as though they were wholly independent 
pieces. They’re not.
 
✓ You’re dealing with the Internet world where things happen really, 
really fast. And here again, reacting reflexively to every change in wind 
direction can make you nuts, and leave your once-promising ad program 
in shambles.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
So, whether you’re going to DIY the operation or entrust it to an outside online 
advertising company or consultant, think ahead. What can you realistically 
expect your efforts to produce? How many new customers? How much in new 
sales? Are you prepared to respond quickly — and on all fronts — if a big nasty 
competitor suddenly comes on the scene? Do you have enough staff to answer 
the phones on the first or second ring and respond to e-mails within 15 minutes, 
or are you better off using a virtual phone service from the start?
All this has to be part of the plan. Fortunately, you have this book — 
especially Chapters 2 and 3 — to help you get your plan thought out, filled in, 
and ready for prime time.
Having Clear Goals in Mind
Before you build a Web site, start worrying about keywords, or figuring out 
what your budget should be for a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign, stop. Take a 
deep breath and ask: What are your actual, real-world, short-term and long-
term business goals?
 
✓ To drive new customers to your door?
 
✓ To expand into new geographical markets?
 
✓ To announce a new product or service?
 
✓ To support existing customers more effectively?
 
✓ To become your area’s preferred provider of whatever it is you provide?
 
✓ To do all or some of these? Or something else?
You have to figure that out — and make it the foundation of your online 
plan — before you do anything else.
 
The point is to make sure that your business needs are driving your advertising, 
not the other way around. Because as weird as it may sound, that tail-wagging-
the-dog thing happens to unsuspecting businesses a lot more often than you’d 
think.
Knowing Your Audience
You can’t implement an effective online advertising plan unless you know 
who you’re targeting. Identify your target audience by age, gender, average 
income, and education level. Try to determine what kind of things they 
buy, what they read, where they spend their time online, and what content 
intrigues them. Granted, you have to trudge around the Web a lot to see 
who’s selling what to whom and how, but the effort’s more than worth it.

335
 Chapter 19: Ten Steps to an Effective Local Online Advertising Plan
When you’ve fixed on the unique characteristics of your target audience, let 
those characteristics be your guide. Put yourself in your audience’s shoes 
and — at every stage of your planning — stay there. Your targets won’t lead 
you astray. They’ll tell you what motivates them, what interests them, what 
they like to buy, and how they like to be sold to — everything, in short, that 
you need to know to start constructing a solid advertising plan.
Understanding How Users Behave Online
Knowing how people browse the Internet, what they use it for, and what 
kind of tools they use in the process is important for the development of any 
workable online advertising plan. For example:
 
✓ People tend to use organic search engine listings when they’re 
researching a particular kind of purchase and then look to sponsored 
listings when they’re ready to buy.
 
✓ People turn to online classifieds for the same reasons and in the same 
way as the classifieds in the newspaper.
 
✓ People who frequent social networks expect and reward extremely soft 
and highly personal selling techniques and will punish marketers who 
come on too strong.
When you’ve grasped dynamics like these — and this book provides plenty 
more of them — you can choose your advertising tactics wisely and execute 
those tactics in an effective and profitable way.
Considering Your Investment 
of Time and Money
Planning your online advertising campaign takes some time, and putting it 
into action requires both time and money. How much of each of those you’re 
willing to spend is something you need to determine upfront.
Say you want to have a first-class Web site. You can design and build it, 
which doesn’t cost much money but eats up a lot of time. On the other 
hand, you can outsource the site’s creation, hosting, and monitoring to a 
professional online company or consultant. Go that route, and your time 
investment shrinks to almost nothing, but the expense can be steep. At the 
other extreme is online classifieds. They’re often free to place and don’t 
require much in the way of time or effort to create. But they aren’t likely to 
be nearly as effective as a PPC campaign, which can claim a significant chunk 
of both time and money.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
So what to do? Follow these steps:
 
1. Be completely honest and determine just how much time and expense 
you want to — and actually can — dedicate to your online campaign.
 
 A lot of local business owners make the mistake of overestimating on 
both counts. Then reality comes calling, and they’re too busy to dedicate 
as much time to the effort as they thought they could, and/or their 
budget is tighter than they’d anticipated. This can be a recipe for 
disaster down the road.
 
2. Be realistic. Really realistic.
 
a. Come up with a budget of both time and money that makes sense 
today and will still make sense tomorrow, next month, or even next 
year.
 
b. Operate on the basis of what’s actually possible, not on what could 
be possible if you never slept and had all the money in the world.
Building a Web Site Designed 
for Conversion
Your Web site is the linchpin of your online advertising campaign. Your site 
is what captures the online traffic your advertising generates. If the site is 
designed properly — which is to say, with the customer in mind — it’s also 
where traffic is converted into qualified leads.
So your site better be good. Make sure your site quickly tells people who you 
are, what you do, what you sell, and what qualifies you to be their vendor of 
choice. And for heaven’s sake, provide ways for them to convert themselves — 
to call, click, accept an offer, and/or visit your physical location.
Prominently display your contact information (telephone number, e-mail, and 
physical addresses) so people know how to reach you. Use techniques that 
are as time-tested as coupons and as high-tech as virtual phone services and 
proactive chat.
In short, make your site a place that people want to come to and then want to 
stay when they’re there.

 Chapter 19: Ten Steps to an Effective Local Online Advertising Plan
Taking Advantage of Local Search
The latest, hottest trend in online marketing is local search — searching for 
local businesses and destinations. If you do most of your business locally, get 
educated pronto about this new and potentially very lucrative tool.
Here are several options for capitalizing on local search:
 
✓ The big three search engines (www.google.com, www.yahoo.com, and 
www.bing.com) offer free local search listings that integrate search 
results with local maps.
 
✓ Several new search engines focus exclusively on local search (such as 
www.local.com, www.truelocal.com, and www.yelp.com), and 
their appeal to both users and advertisers is growing fast.
 
✓ Internet Yellow Pages, local directories, and community sites are 
expanding their local search capabilities to appeal to users looking for 
area-specific businesses.
Best of all from your standpoint, local search isn’t only hot, it’s eminently 
affordable. This makes it one of those things you literally can’t afford not to 
know about and put to instant use for your business.
Choosing Your Tactics Wisely
The Internet, bless its little digital heart, offers an enormous array of tactics to 
help you target your audience and build your business. From search engine 
optimization, to PPC, to listings with directories and lead aggregators, to 
e-mail marketing, to banner advertising, to social media, and more, you have 
a virtual sea of options to pick from. So which ones work best for you?
One excellent way to find out is by putting yourself in your customers’ 
shoes. Try to think like they think. Hang out on the sites where they hang 
out. Get to know their habits. See if you can determine what attracts them, 
what impresses them, and what moves them. (And no, this isn’t stalking, it’s 
research.)
Are they searching Google? Good. That means they’re using keywords. 
Which keywords do you think they’re using to find businesses like yours? Try 
entering those words, and see where they lead you.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Spend some time on at least one social network (such as Twitter or Facebook) 
and don’t be surprised if you find throngs of great prospects gathered there.
You’re only crippling yourself if you let quick, arbitrary decisions or personal 
preconceptions steer you toward or away from a given online tactic. They’re 
all fair game if they’re where your customers are. Your choice of tactics is 
ultimately dictated by how and where your target audience spends its time 
on the Web.
Tracking and Measuring Results
Tracking and measuring are fundamental to online advertising. Test what you 
think might work, find out what actually works, test it again and again, and 
your success is all but guaranteed.
If your PPC advertising brings strong results, go ahead and increase your 
spending. On the other hand, if the advertising is underperforming, tune 
up your ads and test again. Measure the effectiveness of one offer against 
another. Try two different pieces of ad copy and see which one yields better 
results. And so on. If you’re going to play the game — and win it — you have 
to track and measure.
Everything comes back to your old friend, the conversion rate. Maybe most 
of the offers you try underperform, whereas one other offer absolutely 
shoots the lights out when it comes to bringing consumers to your Web site 
and inducing them to fill out a form, call your business, or opt-in to your 
e-newsletter. If so, bingo. That’s your winner.
Optimizing Your Ads and Web Site
Optimization is the process of making something better. You can make your 
Web site or your online advertising campaign better in any number of simple, 
quick, and affordable ways. Test the various elements of your site or your 
campaign to find out which work and which need some improvement. Your 
optimization might be as simple as moving the contact information from the 
right side of a Web page to the left side so it’s easier to see; it might mean 
trying out a big, red Download button to make it more obvious what you want 
visitors to do. Or you can try out different phrasings in your e-mail blasts, or 
make one part of your banner ad bigger and another part smaller.
 
Sure, you might make yourself a little nuts — but you’ll make some big, 
profitable improvements, too. And you’ll celebrate and then, you’ll test the 
improvements. Just don’t forget that while you’re optimizing and optimizing 
again, what you’re really optimizing is your return on investment (ROI).

Ten Considerations When 
Choosing a Local Online 
Adver  tising Par  tner
W
hile enlightening you on the intricacies of local online advertising, 
this book might have convinced you that, depending on the time and 
money you’re willing to invest, you may be better off hiring a partner to help 
you with local online advertising. Here are ten key questions you need to ask 
before going with any particular vendor or consultant.
How Measurable Will Your 
Advertising Efforts Be?
One of the beauties of online advertising is that things are so eminently 
measurable. Oddly, though, many local online advertising consultants and 
vendors don’t really give their clients a way of tracking their sites’ performance. 
This is especially true with many search engine optimization (SEO) vendors 
who sell themselves primarily on their ability to place a keyword. Although 
placement generally leads to more clicks and traffic, if you get clicks and 
traffic from keywords that don’t perform well for you in a business sense 
(for example, they don’t result in actual conversions), those keywords aren’t 
doing you any favors, good placement or not, and should be jettisoned. The 
best local online advertising partners offer excellent reporting interfaces that 
give you a realistic view of how your ad dollars are actually performing, 
particularly with respect to
 
✓ Keyword performance
 
✓ Ad performance
 
✓ Click-throughs

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Conversions
 
✓ Cost-per-click (CPC), where applicable
 
✓ Return on investment (ROI)
If the provider you’re considering doesn’t offer this kind of detailed 
reporting, keep looking.
Do You Care about the Metrics the 
Vendor Promises to Provide?
Even the most expert and overall splendiferous online ad partner can only 
bring customers to you. Whether you can close those customers, retain 
them, upsell them, and so on is ultimately up to you. That doesn’t mean you 
should go with a partner who talks about clicks, CPCs, and traffic alone. 
Important as those metrics are, they don’t necessarily equate to dollars in 
your pocket. Better to find an ad partner who can give you assurances (or 
at least estimates based on real-world experience) regarding the volume of 
phone calls you get, the cost per lead (CPL) they can deliver, the number of 
appointments that are set up, and so on. Those are the metrics that impact 
your revenue, and someone who refuses to acknowledge that fact is likely to 
be an unworthy partner.
How Big Is Your Commitment 
to the Vendor?
Rome wasn’t built in a day (it actually took a whole weekend), and no, you 
won’t see big results from your online advertising efforts as soon as they hit 
the Internet. However, that doesn’t mean you should get tied into a vendor 
contract that extends for, say, 12 or 18 months. So how long is just long 
enough? Well, a good rule is that your pay-per-click (PPC) results should be 
credible after three to six months. SEO results take a while longer, so figure 
on six to nine months for those. If a prospective ad partner insists that you 
sign a contract for much longer than those periods (and isn’t offering you 
some too-good-to-refuse incentive to do so), it’s Red Flag City — and you 
might want to look elsewhere.

 Chapter 20: Ten Considerations When Choosing a Local Online Advertising Partner
What Industry Expertise 
Does the Vendor Have?
Unsurprisingly, vendors who have worked with other businesses in your 
industry are more likely to have the experience and expertise to get you 
strong results right away than vendors who are new to your field. These 
veterans will know what keywords and ad copy strategies have the ability 
to perform, and that will translate into loads of time saved. Sure, good local 
online advertising companies can get results for any kind of local business 
through persistent research and optimization. But do you really want them 
to learn your business on your dime? Didn’t think so. In short, don’t be afraid 
to ask how many other clients a prospective partner has (or had) in your 
industry. And don’t hesitate to ask for references, which you then need to 
follow up on.
Is the Partner Interested 
in Your Web Site?
This is critical because one of the most acidic of acid tests is whether a given 
online advertising vendor demonstrates that they actually care about your 
Web site. If you’re looking for someone to help you increase traffic for your 
current site, a reputable vendor will take a good deal of time examining and 
assessing the site as is, before taking you on as a customer. They need to be 
able to quantify how well your site’s performing at present, if for no other 
reason than to have a benchmark against which you can measure the effects 
of the improvements they make going forward. At minimum, they need to 
give you an educated appraisal of your site’s
 
✓ Layout and design
 
✓ Keyword content
 
✓ Landing pages
 
✓ Forms and phone-number presentation
 
✓ Calls to action
 
✓ Offers and promotions

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Of course, if you don’t currently have a site and are looking for someone 
to help you build one, you won’t yet have anything to assess. But whether 
you’re doing renovation or new construction, a prospective partner should 
commit to conducting some sort of review process on a regular basis. This 
gives you a periodic update as to how well your site is performing and in 
what respects it needs to be kicked up a notch or two. If, on the other hand, 
a would-be partner shrugs off the notion of checking in on your Web site, it’s 
probably safe to assume that that company isn’t really too concerned about 
your real, bottom-line performance. And the proper response in that case is 
no thanks.
How Wide Is the Vendor’s Distribution?
Although hordes of companies can and will place you on Google, Yahoo!, 
Bing, and maybe one or two other major sites . . . so what? A reasonably 
bright sixth grader can do that (if that kid has this book, of course). The 
best local online ad vendors are those who have wide distribution networks, 
meaning they also take advantage of the significant incremental traffic that 
can be generated from lesser-known search engines — particularly local 
ones — and from online directories and other potential traffic sources. These 
other channels may not have quite the pizzazz of the big three, but they’re 
often not nearly as expensive either and taken together, a combination of 
big and not-so-big resources can really help you cover the marketing map. 
Ideally, you’re looking for a partner that can get you distribution on
 
✓ Google, Yahoo!, and Bing
 
✓ Ask.com
 
✓ Vertical-specific search sites
 
✓ Directories, such as Citysearch or Yelp
 
✓ IYP (Internet Yellow Pages)
Who Handles Your Account?
Operating on the model of many traditional media companies, many local 
online ad companies have a system in which accounts are essentially run and 
managed by your salesperson. Although this may work with some traditional 
print media when managing an account meant writing down how big you 
wanted your ad to be, it’s a rare salesperson indeed who can be trusted to 
do say, keyword optimization for your PPC campaign. The better local online 
advertising partners will offer you a dedicated account manager (or two) to 
work with you in both developing your ad program and optimizing it on a 
regular basis.

343
 Chapter 20: Ten Considerations When Choosing a Local Online Advertising Partner
Are There Any Hidden Fees?
What?! Hidden fees? Always check the small print because therein can lurk 
some interesting conditions. A common type of small print stipulates that if 
you decide to change the focus of your business from, say, selling tankless 
water heaters to handling only backflow jobs, you’re obligated to pay a 
change fee for the necessary site adjustments that will have to be made. You 
may not object to that, but even if you’re the go-along-to-get-along type, at 
least get clarification of how big a change counts as big enough to trigger the 
fee. In any case, make sure you read the small print and understand it — and 
you’ll at least know what you’re getting into.
Are There Keyword Limitations?
Although keyword limits may make sense for SEO (because it takes additional 
work to optimize your site for each set of keywords), putting limits on PPC 
keywords makes no sense at all. Time to be blunt: Any vendor or prospective 
partner who’s trying to sell you a specific number of keywords for PPC is 
trying to prey on your supposed lack of local online advertising savvy. But 
lucky you, you have this book. And you can, politely but firmly, tell him to 
take a hike.
What Credentials Does 
the Partner Have?
Most of the major search engines offer certifications for PPC advertising 
companies who pass certain exams or otherwise prove their qualifications. 
Google, for instance, has several levels of certification, the highest being a 
Google AdWords Authorized Reseller. Although these credentials certainly 
aren’t a guarantee that a certified vendor is honest, going to provide you with 
a 1,000-percent ROI, and can see through buildings, they do at least impart 
a certain level of credibility to a vendor who’s vying for your business. And 
they’re a whole heck of lot better than no credentials.

Ten Things to Keep in Mind When 
Creating Your Web Site
Your Web site is your virtual storefront, and often the first way a 
potential new customer finds your business. This chapter describes ten 
tips for creating a great Web site for your local business, from planning to 
landing pages, to search engine optimization.
Knowing What You Want Your Site to Do
Maybe the main goal of your site is to keep your loyal customer base 
informed about new products and promotions you’re offering. Or maybe — 
and this is especially true if you’re new to the whole Web site thing — you 
want your site to be a vehicle for converting a lot of traffic that you’ve driven 
there by using pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.
In the first case, you want the look of your site to reinforce your brand and 
to be extremely informative and full of content. In the second case, you still 
want to reinforce your brand, but you also want to make sure clear calls to 
action are on each page while keeping the pages simple enough to promote 
readability, and consequently, maximize their power to convert visitors into 
leads.
In either case, the point is that if you’re confused as to exactly what you want 
your Web site to do, your site will mirror that confusion. How are consumers 
supposed to react to something that doesn’t seem to know what its purpose 
is? They’re more than likely to leave and not come back.
Before you even take the first step toward setting up a Web site, make sure you
 
✓ Figure out what your goals are.
 
✓ Decide who your most important target audience is.
 
✓ Determine how to measure your success in reaching your objectives.
Then you’re ready to begin creating your Web site.

BC-2 Local Online Advertising For Dummies 
Designing with the Customer in Mind
A visit to your Web site will be probably be the first time that many people 
interact with your business. In fact, having your site appear on a search 
results page may be the first time they’ve ever even heard of your business.
Therefore, your site site must convey a high level of professionalism. That 
doesn’t necessarily mean slick, but it does mean appearing solid, substantive, 
trustworthy, and well-groomed. Misspellings, glitches, and bugs on your Web 
site are huge confidence killers as is a design that’s too dull, or conversely, 
too garish. Remember: You’re trying to establish credibility with total (or 
near-total) strangers. That isn’t easy to do, especially when visitors to your 
site can cut their visits short with one click.
Every bit as important as how your site appears is what it says. Too many 
small business owners look at their Web site as a place to tell their personal 
life stories, express their own opinions, and talk about their own interests. 
(That’s Facebook territory.)
The best, most-compelling business sites are those that tell visitors what 
they want to know. What products do you carry? How do they work? What 
does this product do that another doesn’t? What’s the benefit? And of course, 
how much do they cost? The same goes for services.
Your site’s navigation has to be extremely visitor-friendly, too. Can those 
visitors easily get from this page to that one? If they want, can they get back 
to where they were? Or does your site have some nasty dead ends?
Look at your Web site through your customers’ eyes; customers whose 
burning question will be: What’s in it for me? — then ask: Is enough of that 
here?
Thinking Search Engine Optimization
Amazingly, some businesses still build Web sites that are, at best, unfriendly, 
and at worst, invisible to search engines. Nope, none of those dopey keyword 
things for them, no sir. And, nope, none of those new customers either.
Now, granted, doing a world-class job of search engine optimization (SEO) 
can take a fair-sized chunk of time and effort, but you don’t have to go nearly 
that far. You can, at a bare and easy minimum, make sure you’re doing some 
basic things to help your organic presence by

BC-3
 Bonus Chapter: Ten Things to Keep in Mind When Creating Your Web Site
 
✓ Leveraging a well-researched keyword list to support your site. Using 
these keywords as elements of your page content, your meta tags and 
meta description, your image filenames, and even your site structure.
 
✓ Including your physical address (city, state, and zip code) and phone 
number.
 
✓ Incorporating a site map into your Web site. This gives search engines 
another way to notice you while they crawl around the Web looking for 
sites to add to their local listings.
 
✓ Including links from other credible third-party sites to your own.
 
✓ Refreshing your content on a regular basis to keep those search 
engine spiders coming back again and again. This can only help 
improve your site’s ranking on search results pages.
Making It Easy to Contact You
Your phone number needs to be displayed prominently (even multiple times 
if necessary) throughout your Web site. Strange but true: If a potential client 
has to go to a Contact Us page, the probability goes down that they’ll actually 
become your client. (Apparently, the extra effort involved in executing one 
additional click turns off people.)
Also, make sure to prominently provide a Web form or an e-mail address for 
those prospects who’d rather not use the phone. If yours is the sort of business 
that depends a lot on walk-in traffic, make sure your physical address is 
displayed front and center as well. And don’t forget about all the spiffy new 
technologies that can help you establish real-time, on-site customer contact, 
such as live chat and proactive chat.
Telling People What to Do
That’s always fun, right? But what we’re talking about here is giving visitors 
to your Web site a compelling reason — a call to action — to do what you 
want them to.
And what would you like them to do? Call you? Then, besides just prominently 
displaying your contact information, ask them to give you a call because if 
they do, they’ll get something. For instance, Call to Set Up an Appointment by 
June 1st and Get $50 Off!

BC-4 Local Online Advertising For Dummies 
Other examples of a call to action include
 
✓ Offering a free estimate or consultation
 
✓ Getting visitors to register for an event or discount
 
✓ Letting them download a coupon
 
✓ Encouraging them to fill out a request form to get more information
Face it: Presenting a solid, credible call to action is the fundamental reason 
that you have a Web site in the first place. You offer something of value to 
your visitors. They take you up on the offer and become leads. And then 
you’re off to the races.
Providing a Soft Landing
The goal of the copy and design of each of your landing pages is to get the 
prospect to take a desired action, so maintain landing pages on your site for 
every major service or product category you offer. That way prospects can 
easily find the information they’re after — and if we’ve tried to drive home 
anything in this book, it’s that Web site visitors won’t look very hard for 
whatever is relevant to them and their needs.
Having landing pages is a necessity if you’re going to do PPC advertising. 
Landing pages are what visitors are directed to immediately when they query 
one of your keywords and your ad appears prominently on the resulting 
search results page.
Balancing Images and Text
Done well, Web sites provide both textual and visual content. Quite obviously, 
images are more eye-catching than text — they’re worth a thousand words 
and all that. However, if you have too many pictures, your site will be sorely 
lacking in information. The reverse is equally true. Overload the text side of 
the equation, and your page loses its provocative power.
The answer is to use images wisely — not too many and not too few. For 
maximum effect, some of the best uses of images are to demonstrate 
before-and-after situations, show your office and/or your staff members, and 
display galleries of your company’s best work.

 Bonus Chapter: Ten Things to Keep in Mind When Creating Your Web Site
Showing Awards and Accreditations
Are you member of the Better Business Bureau? Are you a member of a trade 
organization or of the local Chamber of Commerce? Have you won awards 
for outstanding customer service — or anything else for that matter? Include 
that on your site.
Awards and accreditations aren’t just rewards you receive. They also raise 
your credibility among potential customers and increase the probability that 
those folks will turn into new clients.
Adding a Personal Touch
As we often say, you want your Web site to present you as professional, but 
you also need to come off as a human being. Don’t forget to balance that 
professionalism with a little bit conversational tone to engage your visitors 
as people, not robotic decision-makers.
A paragraph about how your business got started or maybe a picture of your 
office can be enough to do the trick. The goal is to offer a personal touch that 
sets your business apart and gives people a reassuring comfort level about 
doing business with you.
Remember, you’re a local business. Most of your customers want to see you 
that way — as someone who knows how they live and what they care about. 
This may seem a little beside the point, but it isn’t. In some sense, at least, it 
actually is the point.
Paying for a Web Site
If you want to wind up with a high-quality, professional-looking site, use a 
professional Web site designer or design firm. This simply stands to reason: 
You almost always get what you pay for, and it’s unlikely you’ll have to pay 
a whole lot. On the other hand, if you don’t get your money’s worth from a 
pro designer, you can always take some serious steps to get the situation put 
right (and just try pulling that off with a techie family member).
Remember that your Web site is, in essence, your virtual storefront, and 
people will largely judge you by how businesslike and professional your 
operation appears. This can’t be helped, but keeping your site/storefront 
from looking awful can. Do yourself a favor: Seriously consider using a pro if 
you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to create the site.
