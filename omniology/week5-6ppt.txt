CO2 Transport  in Blood 
 
 
1.  Bicarbonate ion (HCO3
-) = 60% 
 
 
 
    
 
             H2O + CO2 = H2CO3 = HCO3
- + H+ 
 
 
2.  Bound to Hb in RBC (i.e., carbaminoHb) = 30% 
 
 
3.  Dissolved gas in plasma (PCO2) = 10% 
 
carbonic 
anhydrase

V/Q Mismatch 
normal – 4 L/min ÷ 5 L/min = 0.8 
greater than 1  in apex due to expanded air spaces and compressed vasculature 
less than 1 in base due to vasculature being less compressed

Blood flow (perfusion, Q) 
Ventilation (V) 

V/Q Mismatch 
pulmonary embolism or fibrosis can reduce perfusion 
emphysema can reduce ventilation 
V/Q Mismatch lowers 
O2 content of blood 
leaving the lung & 
PaO2. 
Decreased blood flow 
 
 
Pressure of CO2 in 
alveoli decreases 
 
 
Bronchoconstriction 
 
 
Air is diverted to  
healthy tissue 
Decreased air flow 
 
 
Pressure of O2 in lung 
capillaries decreases 
 
 
Vasoconstriction 
 
 
Blood is diverted to  
healthy tissue 

 
•
Carbon dioxide is very soluble in blood and needs 
no carrier. This difference explains why CO2 
concentration in blood is directly proportional to 
minute ventilation while O2 is not.   
 
•
Arterial blood gases provide a monitor for the 
adequacy of perfusion. 
 
•
Normal lung function requires matching 
ventilation to perfusion. Ventilation without 
perfusion is equivalent to a shunt that bypasses 
the lungs.  
 
•
Intrinsic mechanisms work to match ventilation 
and perfusion such as hypoxic pulmonary 
vasoconstriction.
