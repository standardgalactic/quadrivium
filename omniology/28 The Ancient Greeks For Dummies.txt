Introduction
W
hen I think about it, I’ve always been interested in Ancient Greece but 
I spent a lot of my time not realising that I was. When I was very young
I went to Cyprus on holiday and was fascinated by the ruined statues and
mosaics. As I grew a little older I loved films like Jason and the Argonauts and
Clash of the Titans that were endlessly repeated on television at Christmas.
What I didn’t understand was the ‘Greekness’ of these things. I knew that 
I liked the great stories and scary monsters but it was only when I got older
that I realised that they were just a tiny part of the fascinating world of the
ancient Greeks. 
What interested me most was the fact that, despite the gap of over 2,000
years, the world of the ancient Greeks seemed very real and contemporary.
They had the same concerns and problems as people do today and went
about dealing with them in tremendously imaginative ways. The Greeks were
hugely creative and although they lived in a world with a very dominant 
religion, they never stopped looking for new solutions to age old problems. 
About This Book
Studying the ancient Greeks can be a bit frustrating because an awful lot of
their story doesn’t take place in Greece but elsewhere in the Mediterranean.
The other big frustration is that Greek history isn’t really a continuum. By
that I mean that it doesn’t start at Point X and finish at Y. The Greeks were a
fractious bunch, always fighting amongst themselves and with other people,
so tracing their story can get quite complicated!
It’s worth the effort though. The most wonderful thing about the Greeks is
the legacy that they left behind, which you can see, touch, and immerse 
yourself in. The huge amount of archaeological evidence that still survives 
is breathtaking. From massive buildings like the Parthenon in Athens to the
tiniest coin, each piece of physical evidence reveals something interesting
about the way the Greeks lived and what they did.

Another fantastic resource is the huge amount of written evidence that’s 
survived; plays, poems, works of history, philosophy, science, medicine, 
and epic poetry that read like the plot of a Hollywood action film have all 
survived for over 2,000 years. Throughout this book I try to quote as much as
possible from these original sources because it’s always best to hear it from
the horse’s mouth! 
This book introduces you to the world of the ancient Greeks – a world part
bizarre, part visionary, and part bloodthirsty. It’s not an attempt to tell you
everything about the Greeks; more a way of getting started so that you can
carry on exploring their world – and there’s enough to keep you going for the
rest of your life!
Conventions Used in This Book
The two main issues when looking at any period of ancient history are 
language and dates!
The biggest of the two is language. The ancient Greeks used an entirely differ-
ent alphabet to ours, and consequently the words seem strange and different,
although a great many English words come from ancient Greek ones. To try to
make things easier throughout the book I put any Greek word in italics. So, for
example, when I’m talking about an elected official in ancient Athens I call
him an arkhon because that’s the word that the Greeks used.
You might find that in other books some Greek words are spelt differently
(often using a c instead of a k) or that the author uses the proper Greek punc-
tuation marks on words. Don’t worry – it’s still the same word but I choose to
use the simpler version.
The other issue is using dates. Virtually every date that I use in the book has
BC after it, meaning ‘Before Christ’. That’s because the bulk of ancient Greek
history took place during the two thousand years or so before the accepted
date of Jesus’s birth. (I go into more detail about BC and AD in Chapter 1). Of
course, this is our dating system, not the one that the Greeks would have
used.
Oh yes, one other thing – places. I mention place names all the time. In most
cases you can find the places on the map on the Cheat Sheet at the front of
the book. In the case of battles, the Greeks often fought in a big open space
like a field or a beach, and they’d avoid fighting near towns if possible.
Pinpointing these out-of-the-way places can be really difficult so I try to refer
to the town nearest the battle.

How This Book Is Organised
This book is split into five specific parts, all covering a different aspect of
ancient Greece. 
Part I: Travelling Back in Time
Part I is all about establishing who the Greeks were and where they came
from, which isn’t quite as straightforward as you might think – even the
Greeks weren’t sure! Modern historians have established that the really
ancient Minoan and Mycenaean cultures were the forerunners of the ancient
Greeks and I look at them in Chapter 2. After that comes the story of how the
Greeks came into being and spread all over the Mediterranean. I also look at
how they developed into such amazing warriors. It was just as well they did
because the last chapter in Part I focuses on the wars with the Persian
Empire when it seemed as if ancient Greece might actually be wiped out.
Part II: Athens to Alexander: 
The Rise and Fall of Empires
Part II is a fantastic rollercoaster of a story! It looks at the period of greatest
Greek success following the Persian Wars and how the city of Athens became
so wealthy and dominant. However, after a difficult period a new power
emerged in the north: Macedonia. Under Alexander the Great the Macedonians
went on tremendous military campaigns and built up an empire that stretched
3
Introduction
Differences of opinion
One of the exciting things about history is that it
is always up for debate. Answers are never 100
per cent right or wrong and interpretation
(understanding the ‘why’ rather than the ‘when’)
is the most important thing. You can probably
expect to read some things in this book that
seem to disagree with things you’ve read else-
where. When you’re dealing with events that
took place over 2,000 years ago there’ll always
be differences of opinion, just as there’ll always
be new archaeological discoveries that com-
pletely blow older theories away. In a few years’
time whole new schools of thought on many of
the issues that this book discusses might
emerge. I hope so, because that’s what keeps
history fun!

as far as India. This didn’t last either, as after Alexander’s death the empire
broke up and new kingdoms emerged. The last chapter in this part deals with
how the kingdoms fought amongst themselves until they all finally succumbed
to the threat of the Romans. Ancient Greece was effectively at an end. 
Part III: Living a Greek Life
So what was being an ancient Greek actually like? Part III looks at life in the
towns and cities of ancient Greece from the food they ate to what sort of
exercises people did at the gym, to what happened when people got
divorced. I include specific chapters on theatre, art, architecture, and what
life was like in the countryside.
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief
One of the things that people find most interesting about the ancient Greeks
is the world of mythology. The stories about gods, heroes, and monsters
were dominant themes throughout Greek life, influencing their plays, litera-
ture, and art. Religion was a major part of public life, full of strange and
bizarre rituals. Part IV is all about these themes with a focus on how the
Greeks lived their lives surrounded by these ideas and based a lot of what
they did on examples from mythology.
This part ends with a look at the Greek philosophers, the men who chal-
lenged these beliefs in gods and monsters, and set out to make sense of the
world using their own powers of logic and reason. They were an odd bunch
but their ideas are fascinating!
Part V: The Part of Tens
This final part has four brief chapters intended to give you an idea of where
to go next to further your experience of the ancient Greeks. I include 
chapters on places to go and books to read. Chapter 23 is all about Greek
inventions – you’ll be surprised at some of the things that the Greeks came
up with but they’re all true, promise! Chapter 25 is about interesting but
slightly dodgy characters; the people in history who are worth a second look
and a revaluation.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book I use a series of icons to capture your attention. I hope
they’re as useful to the reader as they were to the writer!
As much as possible I try to use bits of what the Greeks actually said.
Reading something first-hand is fascinating and the huge amount of writing
that survives from Ancient Greece makes this easy to do.
Just like urban myths today, a lot of ‘facts’ about ancient Greece aren’t 
actually true. Occasionally I point them out with this icon.
This icon pinpoints important information to bear in mind when getting to
grips with the ancient Greeks.
Some of the stories from ancient Greece are like the plots of Hollywood films
and increasingly they are being made into them. This icon means that I’m 
referencing a film you may want to check out.
Sometimes I include information that’s interesting but not vital. This icon
highlights more complicated stuff that you can skip over if you want to.
Where to Go from Here
You can start at the beginning so that you have the historical context before
you start looking at how the Greeks lived their lives. Alternatively, you can
start with Part IV, all about religion and mythology and where the Greeks con-
sidered that they came from. This is just as important to understand as the
historical background.
Each chapter in the book is written around a specific topic so you can really
dive in anywhere. If you want to know about Alexander the Great, go to
Chapter 11. If Greek drama is your thing then Chapter 16 is the one for you. 
I include cross-references in the chapters so if something comes up that’s
mentioned in more detail elsewhere, you’re directed to it.
Whichever way you choose to enjoy the book, I hope you find it fun and 
interesting.

M
odern Greece is very different to the Greece of the ancient world. 
Today, Greece is a medium sized member of the European Union that uses
the euro as its currency. To the north-east it’s bordered by Macedonia and to
the north-west Albania. Most people think of it as a popular tourist destina-
tion, and during the summer months people from around the world flock to
the seaside resorts on the mainland and on islands like Crete and Rhodes. 
For these visitors, the material remains of the ancient world are still visible.
Tourists can look at ruined temples and statues while they sit drinking
Mythos beer in bars and restaurants named after Greek gods and heroes.
Often, they stay in towns whose names are redolent of the ancient world, like
Athens, Delphi, Olympia, and Corinth.
Much like the rest of the Mediterranean, visitors to Greece find great food,
friendly people with a strong sense of honour and family values, and a seduc-
tively relaxed way of life that seems to go at a slower pace than the rest of the
world. 
This idyllic and fascinating holiday destination, however, is in sharp contrast
to the focus of this book – the Greece of the ancient world. Ancient Greece is
about huge events, incredible battles, and tremendous advances in science
and understanding that took place over 2,000 years ago.

In this chapter I put the ancient Greeks in historical and geographical 
context – answering the questions ‘When?’ and ‘Where?’. I also address the
fundamental questions about them – precisely who they were, where they
came from, and why what they did is still incredibly important.
Understanding Why the 
Ancient Greeks Matter
Hopefully, you have already decided that the ancient Greeks are worth 
bothering with – otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this book. 
Falling for all things ancient Greek
Simply put, the ancient Greeks were amazing. Their society and culture is
endlessly fascinating. If you don’t believe me, try the following for size:
 Zeus, the ancient Greeks’ most powerful god, changed himself into a
bull, a swan, and a shower of gold so that he could make love to beauti-
ful women without his wife finding out. Oh yes, and his wife was also his
sister. (See Chapter 19 for more on Zeus and the rest of the ancient
Greek gods.)
 Ancient Greeks thought that the world was an island entirely sur-
rounded by water that looked rather like a fried egg. (See Chapter 19.)
 They invented the Olympic Games, and their greatest Olympian trained
by carrying a cow around for four years. (See Chapter 16.)
 The Greeks had elaborate religious cults that participated in strange 
rituals, including swimming with pigs. (See Chapter 21.)
 One of their philosophers jumped into a volcano to prove he was a god.
When he didn’t come back, people realised that he wasn’t one. (See
Chapter 22.)
Noting the Greeks’ contributions 
Everybody goes on about the Romans and the massive advances in civilised
life that they were responsible for such as central heating, straight roads, and
Latin. Well, the Romans certainly did a lot, but they were preceded by the
Greeks, who were pretty inventive too.

The ancient Greeks are responsible for a fascinating number of creations and
inventions: money, democracy, written history, bras, satire, and musical nota-
tion are all things that the Greeks are at least partly responsible for creating.
You can read more about these and other inventions in Chapter 23.
While inventions are all well and good, the most impressive thing that the
Greeks came up with was civilisation itself. Civilisation, the whole idea of
living together in large towns and cities, was a fairly new concept that the
Greeks initiated in Europe.
So who were these fascinating, inventive, and civilised people?
Meeting the People of Ancient Greece
Modern Greece is very different from the Greece of the ancient world. The
biggest difference is that what you may think of Greece and being Greek is
nothing like the ancients’ experience. 
‘Being Greek’ in the ancient world meant that you shared a way of life with
people, rather than the citizenship of a single country. Greeks lived all across
the Mediterranean: Spain, North Africa, Sicily, southern Italy, Asia Minor
(modern-day Turkey), the Aegean islands, and of course the land mass that
folk call modern Greece. This way of life included:
 The language that you spoke (see the later section ‘Talking the Talk:
Ancient Greek Language’).
 The gods that you believed in (see Chapter 19).
 The food you ate (see Chapter 15).
 All the other things that make up an individual’s identity.
Furthermore, the Greeks of the ancient world didn’t necessarily consider
themselves to be Greek; rather, they classified themselves as being citizens of
the towns or cities from which they came. Greeks only really considered
themselves to be Greek in comparison to foreigners. So an Athenian talking to
an Egyptian described himself as a Greek, whereas if the same Athenian was
talking to somebody from Corinth (another Greek town), he called himself an
Athenian.

Locating Ancient Greece
Ancient Greece was very spread out, which means that the people, ideas, and
events that I talk about in this book came from and took place all around the
Mediterranean and sometimes beyond, as Figure 1-1 shows. Eventually, there
were people who considered themselves to be Greek in Spain, France, Italy,
North Africa, Libya, and Asia Minor – and in Greece itself of course.
The most densely populated area was the land mass known as Greece today.
It’s an area that is really dominated by two things – the sea and very large
mountain ranges. For the ancient Greeks, the mountain ranges meant that
sections of this big slab of land were sometimes very disconnected from each
other. This is one of the reasons why people tended to think of themselves in
local terms rather than national ones.
Greece isn’t a very large land mass, and wherever you stand in it you’re
unlikely to be more than about 50 kilometres from the sea. The land is fertile
but also very hilly, which means that it doesn’t have vast plains of workable
farmland. These two factors are important when considering why so many
Greeks decided to leave the land mass and create new towns on the nearby
islands and elsewhere in the Mediterranean (see Chapter 7).
Separating the region
You can divide Greece in two at the Gulf of Corinth, the large body of water
that runs through the middle of the region: 
Spain
France
Greece
Italy
Black Sea
Asia Minor
North Africa
Libya
Figure 1-1:

Mediter-
ranean.

 To the north: North of the Gulf was the larger part of mainland Greece,
although the south was much more heavily populated. The biggest city
in this part of Greece was Thebes and also located in the region was 
the sacred site of Delphi, which was home to the famous oracle. (See
Chapter 21 for more.)
 To the south: Southern Greece was divided in two by the Peloponnese
mountain range. Most of the famous cities of ancient Greece were here:
Sparta, Olympia, Corinth, Argos, and, to the north-east, Athens. 
Touring the islands and beyond
Although the Greek mainland is fairly small, bits of what historians consider
to be ancient Greece were spread all over the eastern Mediterranean. All the
places that people now go to on holiday – approximately 1,400 islands – were
part of ancient Greece, as well other more distant lands. 
Here’s a brief guide to some of the most notable parts of ancient Greece:
 Euboia: The big peninsula that’s just off the eastern coast of Greece. Its
people considered themselves to be very different and separate from
those on the mainland.
 The Cyclades: The big group of islands in the south, including places
like Naxos, Paros, and Delos. The ancient Greeks called this group ‘The
Circle’.
 Asia Minor: The western coast of modern-day Turkey. During the Dark
Ages, loads of Greeks from the mainland moved there and created the
new Greek areas of Aeolia and Ionia (for more, see Chapter 3).
 Thrace: At the top of Figure 1-1, the area is now southern Bulgaria. 
For the ancient Greeks, this area was wild, hilly country full of warlike
tribes – definitely a place to avoid!
 Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus: Big important islands to the south-east that
developed their own civilisations independent of the Greek mainland. In
fact, civilisation started on Crete; read all about it in Chapter 2.
 The western islands: Important islands to the west of mainland Greece.
Corcyra (modern-day Corfu), Cephallenia, Ithaca, and Zakynthos were all
in this part of the Mediterranean.
 Other islands: Of the 1,400 islands, only about 250 were inhabited and
many of those by not more than about 100 people. Each of the islands
has its own fascinating stories and episodes. Islands like Lemnos,
Miletus, Samos, and Lesbos are important to the story of the ancient
Greeks.
13

You can visit these islands and many contain fascinating archaeological evi-
dence, some of which is remarkably well preserved, from enormous chunks
of ancient temples to the small personal possessions that people used in
everyday life. Chapter 26 suggests several places that you might like to visit
when you’ve finished reading this book!
Clarifying When It All Happened
The period of history that historians consider to be the time of the ancient
Greeks is very big. Broadly speaking, it dates from the very early beginnings
of the Minoan civilisation in Crete around 2800 BC up until the defeat of the
Macedonian king Perseus by the Romans in 168 BC. That’s more than 2,500
years – 500 years longer than the time that’s passed between the birth of
Jesus and the present day. 
Clearly, a book of this size can’t cover everything that happened during this vast
expanse of history – and I don’t intend to try! Most scholars and historians
agree that the history of Greek civilisation went through several distinct phases
(see the later section ‘Establishing chronology’). Of these I devote most pages to
discussing the period between 900 and 300 BC. That’s the period that I think of
as ancient Greece: Homer, the Persian Wars, Socrates, Greek tragedy, the
Parthenon, and Alexander the Great all came about during this time.
Playing the dating game: BC or AD?
All the dates that I use in the book are followed by the suffix BC, meaning
‘Before Jesus Christ’. This means that something taking place in 545 BC
occurred 545 years before the year in which Jesus Christ is thought to have
been born. You count dates BC backwards, so that the year 344 BC was the
one that immediately followed 345 BC. 
Events that took place after the birth of Jesus are preceded by AD, which
stands for the Latin phrase Anno Domini, meaning the year of Jesus’s birth
(AD 1 – there’s no year zero). So I’m writing this book in the year AD 2007,
2007 years after the birth of Jesus. You count dates AD forwards. So this book
was published in 2008, the year immediately following 2007.
Sometimes when you read a book or visit a website about the ancient world,
you see dates followed by BCE and CE, meaning ‘Before the Common Era’ and
‘Common Era’ (confusingly, also known as ‘Before the Christian Era’ and
‘Christian Era’). This convention has come about so that people who don’t
recognise Jesus as the son of God can use a dating system to represent the
years in question without the assumption of Christ’s divinity. In this book I
decided to stick with BC and AD because I’ve always used them and it’s never
done me any harm.
14

Figuring out dates for the ancient Greeks
Obviously, the Greeks didn’t think about things in terms of BC and AD, but
they also didn’t think in terms of the year having a number. 
 Generally speaking, people in the ancient world used major events as a
method of dating rather than specifically numbered years. So, for exam-
ple, an ancient Greek may describe himself as having been born five
years after the battle of Marathon (see Chapter 6). 
 Another common method was to date an event by its proximity to the
Olympic Games. For example, ‘The Spartans attacked our town two
years after the 25th Olympiad’.
Of course, things were often not this simple. For a mind-reeling discussion of
the intricacies of the ancient Greek calendar, check out Chapter 15.
Establishing chronology 
The following is a brief chronology of the whole of ancient Greek history. Of
course, the ancient Greeks themselves wouldn’t have thought about their 
history in these terms and their ideas of how the world was progressing were
very different (see Chapter 19), but modern historians generally agree on the
following sequence of periods.
The Bronze Age: 2700–1100 BC
This period is the earliest of Greek history. During these years the first
European civilisation appeared on the island of Crete and became known as
Minoan. This period was strange and wonderful and seems very alien to
modern sensibilities. 
Civilisation soon sprang up on mainland Greece, and historians refer to this
culture as Mycenaean. Around 1300 BC something cataclysmic happened in
Crete; the Minoan period came to an end, and the people scattered. Read all
about these earliest ancient Greeks in Chapter 2. 
The Dark Ages: 1100–900 BC
The Dark Ages are so named because historians know very little about what
was going on. Most scholars describe it as time of travelling, and that pretty
much sums it up. All the people who left mainland Greece after the end of the
Bronze Age travelled far and wide, setting up new towns all around the
Mediterranean. As a result trade and diplomacy began in earnest too.

Early Greece: 900–490 BC
This period was when Greece started to grow up. The hundreds of communi-
ties and colonies that had been established during the Dark Ages grew into
new societies and what became known as city-states.
These city-states had different forms of government, but remarkably the
market town of Athens decided upon the system of democracy. You can read
about how it happened in Chapter 4. 
All the city-states soon faced a major challenge, however, when the immense
Persian Empire launched a series of attacks against them. Look at Chapter 6
to find out how they got on.
The Classical period: 490–350 BC
After dealing with the Persians, the Athenians began throwing their weight
around and soon possessed an empire. The money that the empire generated
was responsible for some of the fabulous culture that ancient Greece is
famous for. You can read more about Athens in Chapter 7 as well as nearly
every aspect of Greek life during the Classical period in Part III.
Athens’s domination, of course, came to an end when the Peloponnesian War
began with Sparta (see Chapter 8). After its defeat, Athens declined in influ-
ence and a whole series of squabbles between the city-states broke out with
no clear winner. Until . . .

Archaeology: Answering the impossible
Written source material from ancient Greece
reveals a phenomenal amount about the Greeks
and their lives. But this source material is never
truly complete. The science of archaeology has
been hugely useful in understanding who the
Greeks were and where they came from. A little
over 100 years ago we didn’t know anything
about the Minoans or Mycenaeans. Now, thanks
to archaeological discoveries in the early years
of the 20th century we know how influential
these civilisations were on the development of
the ancient Greeks (see Chapter 2 for more 
on this). New archaeological discoveries are
continually being made, producing more and
more ‘material culture’ to sit alongside the 
written sources that we’ve always had. In this
book there’s a bias towards written evidence
(because it really helps to emphasise points 
that I make!) but don’t ignore the impact of
archaeology!

seizing control of the Persian Empire, and journeying as far as India in a quest
of discovery and conquest. You can read more about this brilliant story in
Chapter 11. 
After Alexander died without a strong heir, his empire broke up into warring
territories ruled by his former generals. Eventually, the Romans arrived in the
middle of the second century BC, and what we call the Greek period came to
an end. 
Talking the Talk: Ancient 
Greek Language 
The language that historians and scholars call ancient Greek came into being
around 1100 BC and first appeared in written form around 750 BC. As I note in
the earlier section ‘Establishing chronology’, this is a time period when all
the travelling and colonisation was going on, after the collapse of the Minoan
civilisation in Crete. 
Developing differences
Language-wise, ancients Greek came in roughly three different types:
 Dorian Greek was spoken by people who lived on most parts of the
Greek mainland and on the islands of Cyprus and Crete.
 Ionic Greek was spoken by people who lived on most of the smaller
islands, as well as on the eastern coast of mainland Greece (such as the
people of Athens) and the south-western coast of Asia Minor. 
 Aeolian Greek was spoken by everybody else! This included people
who lived in the northern part of the Mediterranean Sea (called the
Aegean Sea) and on the north-western coast of Asia Minor.
Just like today, people also spoke in their own localised dialect. These indi-
viduals would all have been able to understand each other, but regional dif-
ferences existed, even within the three types of Greek mentioned in the
preceding bulleted list. (For example, people who lived in Athens spoke a
slightly different form of Ionian Greek called Attic.) It’s the same today: Think
of the differences in accent between people in Glasgow and Texas. They
speak the same language but with huge regional differences.

In the film Alexander (2005), Colin Farrell, who plays Alexander the Great,
speaks in his own natural Irish accent, as do all the other Macedonian offi-
cers. The more refined Greek characters (the Athenians, for example) speak
standard British. This use of modern dialects was a great way of showing
that, despite all speaking Greek, the Macedonians would have spoken in a
slightly rougher rural dialect as opposed to the more refined Greek of the
folks in Athens.
Creating the Greek alphabet
If you spoke ancient Greek, people pretty much all over the Mediterranean
could understand you. Part of the reason for this is that some time around
750 BC the Greeks began to use writing to record business transactions 
and contracts. In doing so, they came up with a method of reproducing the
sounds of their language in symbols. The result was the ancient Greek 
alphabet.
The Greek alphabet was made up of 24 symbols that represented letters or
groups of letters, like alpha α and beta β. Figure 1-2 shows the letters of the
Greek alphabet.
The ancient Greek alphabet was heavily influenced by the eastern world and
ancient Mesopotamia. Indeed, initially the Greeks wrote their script from
right to left, like modern Arabic. However, by the Classical period, when
many of the great works of literature were produced, the Greeks had adopted
the left-to-right writing style familiar to writers of English.

(Not) lost in translation
You can read a huge number of ancient Greek
dramatic, literary, historical, poetic, and philo-
sophical texts in translation. Many translations
are available and they often vary quite consid-
erably. Some people argue that you can never
really appreciate the true nature of these works
unless you read them in the original Greek but,
quite frankly, that’s a load of old rubbish!
Translation of these ancient texts has been
going on for centuries. It’s only because of the
work of medieval monks (who zealously made
copies) that we still have these amazing works
of literature. Modern translators are incredibly
skilful at producing work that captures the spirit
of ancient Greek literature while still making it
accessible to readers. 
Try the translations of The Iliad and The
Odyssey by Homer and The Oresteia by
Aeschylus that have recently been completed
by Robert Fagles (available in Penguin Classics).
They are vibrant and powerful, retaining all the
chutzpah of Homer and Aeschylus while still
feeling contemporary today.

If you look at a modern version of ancient Greek text, it includes accents and
marks to suggest where you should leave gaps for breathing when reading it
out. These are all modern additions. The Greeks didn’t use punctuation ini-
tially (it developed during the Hellenistic period) – just plain text. Mind you,
as they invented writing as we know it, we can probably let them off for skip-
ping the commas and full stops! The Greeks used spaces between lines of dia-
logue to indicate a change in the speaker. This system was known as
paragraphos and the English word ‘paragraph’ comes from it.
Ancient Greek was a phonetic language (the letters of the alphabet repre-
sented a single sound) but certain stresses were employed, especially on
vowels.

hese days you can very easily find out about what happened in the past.

and painlessly have dates and facts at your fingertips.
The ancient Greeks didn’t have that ability. People living in the first millen-
nium BC didn’t know very much about what existed before them, so they
filled in the big gaps in knowledge about their own past with myths and leg-
ends that explained how their town or city came to be. (See Part IV for more
on the ancient Greeks’ rich mythological past.)
Indeed, up until about 100 years ago, researchers were still in the dark about
what existed before the ancient Greeks. Historians relied on myths, poems,
stories, and a few ancient historical writings that mention a very successful,
pre-Greek civilisation based on the island of Crete, the largest of more than
1,400 islands that lie off the coast of the Grecian mainland.
This chapter is about this early civilisation – the Minoan – as well as the
Mycenaean civilisation that followed. These two unusual and hugely success-
ful groups started the chain of events that resulted in what eventually
became ancient Greece.

Starting at the Beginning: 
The Minoan Civilisation
At the beginning of the 20th century, archaeological digs on the island 
of Crete led by Englishman Sir Arthur Evans revealed the existence of a
wealthy, complex civilisation that had built huge palaces. Evans named these
people the Minoans, after the legendary King Minos (see the later section
‘Mythologising the Minoans’ for more info). Evan’s rediscovery of Minoan 
culture finally provided a solution to the origins of ancient Greece. 
What historians and researchers call the Minoan civilisation flourished from
around 2200 to about 1450 BC on the island of Crete. The Minoans weren’t
Greek, but the culture that grew out of their civilisation had a huge influence
on the people living on mainland Greece who eventually become the 
ancient Greeks.
The archaeological discoveries on Crete show that people had inhabited the
island since 7000 BC. Sometime around 2600 BC a great deal of disruption and
moving around seems to have happened. At this point Crete became an
important centre of civilisation. Historians refer to this period (roughly 3000
to 1200 BC) as the Bronze Age because bronze (an alloy of copper and tin)
was the most commonly used metal at the time.
Unfortunately, knowledge of the Minoans is limited because they didn’t use
writing in the way that the later Greeks did. Early Cretan writing seems to
have been writing in pictures – like Egyptian hieroglyphics – and later devel-
oped into a more recognisable form, a series of letter-like symbols that we
would think of as writing; what you might call a script like a letter or docu-
ment. Around 3,000 Minoan tablets have been discovered, and these tablets
were written in Linear B script, a method of writing that was used in the for-
mation of the early Greek language (see Chapter 1). Unfortunately, because
the Minoan tablets are mostly lists of goods or inventories of resources,
they’re very difficult to translate and don’t tell much about Minoan society.
Because no Minoan texts or documents exist, historians have to use the
results of archaeology to interpret and make judgements about the civilisa-
tion. Hence, the Minoan culture is considered prehistory, rather than history.
Organising the civilisation
Researchers do know that at the height of Minoan power (around 1850 BC)
the island of Crete was divided into six different political regions, as Figure
2-1 shows. Other palace complexes were on the island, but these six seem to
have been the most influential due to their evident wealth and prosperity.
22
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The remains of great palace complexes, which have been uncovered during
the past hundred years or so, tell researchers that Crete was politically
organised. The presence of a palace implies that a monarchy ruled a society,
and the towns and cities on the Greek mainland were highly influenced by
this arrangement. Later, Greek cities tended to organise themselves around a
palace complex.
Of all the Minoan palace complexes, by far the biggest was constructed at
Knossos on the north of the island (a 5-acre site with a main building that
covered more than three acres by itself). Knossos is one of the most 
impressive sites that people can still view today (see Chapter 27). 
Knossos wasn’t just a palace; it was also a seat of government, a stronghold
against invasion, and a place for storing goods and wares. The main building
contained around 19 rooms, the vast majority of which were used for storage. 
Wealth – and in particular the visible display of it – was a prime qualification
for rulers in early societies (hence, the impressive scale of Knossos). People
during the Minoan period didn’t have bank accounts, so they displayed their
wealth through the size and contents of their houses. The Minoans didn’t
have the fast cars or impressive stereo systems of today to spend their
money on, so they spent it on wine, olive oil, wool, and grain. Although these
items were fairly ordinary, they were vital for existence, and having a lot of
them was impressive. Another reason for stockpiling so much stuff was that
the Minoans made their money from trade.
Engaging in retail therapy
The Minoans were serious traders. Their economy was based on buying and
selling. Have a look at the position of Crete on the Cheat Sheet map. Being
down in the south-east of the Mediterranean meant that the civilisation was
ideally placed to carry out lots of trade.

The Minoans were hugely involved in the trade of tin. They didn’t mine it
themselves but imported it, manufactured, and sold it on. By combining tin
with copper from nearby Cyprus, they were able to make bronze. Bronze was
used for everything during the Minoan period, especially weapons and tools.
Bronze was also in great demand throughout the Mediterranean. A good 
comparison would be with how important oil is in modern society. 
But tin was far from the only thing that the Minoans had for sale. Other popu-
lar Minoan products included the following: 
 Ceramics: The Minoans produced huge amounts of pottery and decora-
tive items that they sold all around the Mediterranean region, including
Greece, Asia Minor, and as far west as Spain. These must-have items
were quite simple in design – usually a dark background with decorative
images such as trees, fish, and animals. 
 Gold and silver: The most valuable of metals, gold and silver were
highly prized and used only for jewellery. Wearing it was a sign of real
social status. It wasn’t until around 600 BC that the Greeks started using
coins. Accordingly, amounts of gold and silver were used as a substitute
for exchanges of high value. 
 Timber: The mountains on Crete were thickly wooded during the Bronze
Age; even more so than they are today when forest fires are still a real
risk. All the available lumber enabled the Minoans to build many ships.
Minoan wood was also highly prized abroad, in places such as Egypt
where timber was scarce.
 Saffron: This rare spice was the most exclusive Minoan product. Saffron
was highly prized and incredibly expensive – only the very rich could
afford it. The spice had a number of uses from flavouring and preserving
foods to treating various medical ailments.
24
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
Human sacrifice?
One unpleasant religious practice that’s often
been associated with the Minoans is human
sacrifice. Even today academics can’t agree on
whether this practice actually took place. 
Several sites on Crete contain shrines with pos-
sible evidence. The best example is a shrine at
Anemospilia, where a body of a young man was
found in a very unnatural position on top of a
platform. He was in a constricted position as if
he’d been trussed up in preparation for sacri-
fice, and a dagger was found on top of the body.
This may well have been an isolated incident.
But given the fact that Minoans routinely sacri-
ficed hundreds of animals, they could possibly
have switched to sacrificing humans on occa-
sions, perhaps when a town or city was facing
major problems.

 Wool: Wool has always been a central part of the Greek economy, even
at this early stage. Sheep’s wool was most commonly used and was
taken as raw fibres straight from the sheep before being dyed and spun
using a spindle.
As Crete became the leading supplier for many essentials and luxury goods,
the island also developed a powerful hold on some of its customers on the
nearby Aegean islands. Historians don’t know exactly how the relationship
between Crete and the surrounding area worked, but the ties must have been
a mixture of dependency and colonisation. When the Athenians built a power-
ful empire more than 1,000 years later (see Chapter 7), contemporary histori-
ans made comparisons with the Minoans. Most likely, a lot of neighbouring
islands became trading outposts that enabled the Minoans to take Cretan
goods farther across the Mediterranean.
Trying to meet the mysterious Minoans
All their wealth and influence presumably brought the Minoan aristocracy a
high standard of living, but knowing for sure is difficult. Aside from the spec-
tacular remains of the palace complexes, historians know very little about
the lives of these puzzling people. 
Getting dressed, Minoan-style
Some illustrations that have survived on fragments of pottery show men
wearing clothes rather like kilts or loincloths. Given the hot climate and
active lifestyle it was a fairly common form of dress and can be found 
elsewhere at the time, such as in Ancient Egypt.
Women’s outfits were slightly more unusual. The Minoans seem to have
invented the bra. The women shown in paintings wear a type of girdle that
goes round the back and supports the breasts while leaving them exposed.
This unusual garment was certainly not passed on to the Greeks, who were
incredibly scrupulous and controlling of female dress and appearance 
(see Chapter 15).
Worshipping
The one area in which historians do have a little more information is religion.
The Minoans often represented their gods through animal symbols, in styles
much like the decoration on their pottery. 
The Minoans worshipped female deities that represented different aspects 
of life – a mother goddess who was associated with fertility and others that
represented protection of cities, animals, the harvest, and households.

The bull was also an important symbol in Minoan religion and represented a
male god that was associated with the sun. In fact, some Minoan art shows
young men (and occasionally women) engaging in the bizarre practice of bull
leaping. This trial of strength and dexterity required individuals to leap
across the back of an untethered, fully grown bull – not dissimilar to the
rodeo events in modern America.
Mythologising the Minoans
Of course, this talk of bulls and human sacrifice leads to the most famous
story associated with the Minoans: Theseus and the Minotaur. This story is
probably a very early example of how the Greeks used myths to explain the
gaps in knowledge of their own history. 
Theseus and the Minotaur
According to the story, Theseus was a great hero of the city of Athens.
(Indeed, a huge number of stories are associated with his legend.) His mother
Aethera brought Theseus up in the city of Troezen. When he became a young
man, he left home to claim his birthright as the son of Aegeus, the king of
Athens, and after many adventures he succeeded in becoming heir to the
Athenian throne.
At the time, Minos, the king of Crete, was exacting a grisly annual tribute 
on the city of Athens: Seven girls and seven boys were taken to Crete and fed
to the Minotaur that lurked in the labyrinth beneath Minos’s palace. The
Minotaur was the illegitimate half-man, half-bull son of Minos’s wife Pasaphae.
The creature fed on human flesh.
In the third year of the tribute, Theseus volunteered to go as one of the seven
boys in order to kill the Minotaur and bring the practice to an end. Theseus
did kill the Minotaur and was helped by Minos’s daughter, Ariadne, who gave
Theseus a ball of wool that allowed him to find his way out of the labyrinth
and escape with her.
Separating history and ‘mythtory’
The story of Theseus has many layers – indeed, I write more about it in
Chapter 4. But for now, consider how much the story tells about what the
later Greeks knew of the Minoans. The story includes many of the elements I
talk about in this section: foreign colonisation, bull worship, large palace
complexes, human sacrifice, and bulls. 
You can easily see how later Greeks put together some of the elements of
Minoan civilisation and came up with a great story that explained the
26
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Minoans’ previous dominance over their own part of the world. You can
almost call this practice ‘mythtory’ – a creative filling-in-the-blanks between
what you do know. 
The story of Theseus shows how myths work – a topic I cover in Chapter 19.
But the myth is particularly relevant at this point because the end of the
Minoan civilisation certainly involved an intervention from mainland Greece.
Going out with a bang
At some point around 1450 BC, most of the large palaces on Crete were
turned to rubble. With Minoan civilisation enjoying such success, why did it
come to a sudden end? 
The most common explanation is an earthquake, possibly tied in with a vol-
canic eruption on the island of Thera (modern-day Santorini), around 150
years earlier. Many people have tried to tie this event in with the legend of
the lost city of Atlantis. If the volcano theory is true, it explains why so many
of the palaces were destroyed around the same time but the dates don’t quite
match up.
However, some people argue that human intervention may have been
involved. One reason for this is that Knossos, the biggest palace of all,
appears to have survived for another 50 years or so, perhaps indicating that
a war won by those from Knossos led to the large-scale destruction of the
other palaces half a century earlier.
Whatever the reason, by 1400 BC Knossos itself had been destroyed and
Minoan dominance and civilisation was at an end. The archaeological evi-
dence suggests that human beings destroyed Knossos. If that was the case,
only one likely candidate exists: the Mycenaeans, the newly dominant force
in the eastern Mediterranean.
Meeting the New Kids on the 
Block: The Mycenaeans
The Mycenaean civilisation flourished between 1600 BC and the collapse of
what’s referred to as the Bronze Age civilisation, around about 1100 BC. Later
Greeks considered the Mycenaeans to be a warlike people who were bent on
conquest and the expansion of their territory, and they put Greece as we
know it on the map.
27

Mycenaean civilisation was based in mainland Greece. As Figure 2-2 shows,
its main centres were the cities of Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, Athens, and
Thebes.
Historians have struggled to identify the origins of the Mycenaean civilisa-
tion. Most researchers now agree that the Mycenaens were probably origi-
nally from Crete. When the Minoan civilisation began to spread out around
1700 BC, some travellers settled in central Greece. Within a century or so,
these individuals had established a new society that was very different from
their Minoan ancestors.
Separating Minoan and Mycenaean: 
Trade versus conquest
The Minoan civilisation was primarily based on trade and commerce (see the
earlier section ‘Engaging in retail therapy’). Although the Minoans must’ve
fought several wars, the empire that they gained was built on trade and
exchange.

This wasn’t the case with the Mycenaeans. Their civilisation was dominated
by a warrior elite who gained status and influence through conquest. To
become an important figure a man had to be a great warrior who had con-
quered towns and taken booty. One great example is the conquest of Crete
around 1400 BC. Whether or not the Mycenaeans were responsible for the
destruction of the palace of Knossos (skip back to the section ‘Going out with
a bang’ for more), they certainly took advantage of its demise and gained
control of Crete as a centrepiece of their huge empire.
One effect of the Mycenaean conquest was that the script they used, which
historians call Linear B, became probably the earliest form of ancient Greek.
However, by far the greatest achievement associated with Mycenaean civilisa-
tion is the conquest of the immense and wealthy city of Troy on the north-
western coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). The legendary events
around this conquest became known as the Trojan War. Read more about this
fantastic piece of ‘mythtory’ in Chapter 21.
Of course, Mycenaean civilisation was much more than just war and con-
quest, as the following sections explore. 
When looking at the Mycenaeans, you’re dealing with prehistory – no 
written records exist. Historians must rely on archaeology for most of their
knowledge of this civilisation. 
Burying the dead 
Mycenaeans buried their nobles and warrior dead in beehive-shaped tombs,
known as tholoi. The contents of many of these larger tombs have enabled
modern archaeologists to come to a lot of conclusions about the
Mycenaeans.
Nobles were often buried with a lot of grave goods, valuable possessions that
tell about the person buried. Typical goods include jewellery, armour, gold
masks, and weapons. 
Conspiring religion
Historians know little about Mycenaean religious practices. The Mycenaeans
apparently worshipped a number of the same gods that the later Greeks did,
such as Poseidon. However, they probably didn’t worship in the same way.
Certainly no evidence exists of the sort of temples that cropped up in later
periods. (See Chapter 21 for more information on ancient Greek religion.)

Organising socially
The way the Mycenaeans organised their society influenced Greek cities and
culture for the centuries that followed.
Mycenaean civilisation was divided into several different centres. The poet
Homer (described in Chapter 20), who was composing around 500 years 
later, said that these centres were based around the major cities, including
Mycenae, Pylos, and Sparta. The Mycenaeans didn’t have an overall ruler;
their world was probably periodically dominated by whichever king was
most powerful.
Each Mycenaean city had: 
 A king: The king was probably the biggest landowner and most 
successful warrior within the local area and may well have become 
king by force. If you think about the fact that the Mycenaeans were
descended from colonists, the leadership was probably the descendants
of families that had originally grabbed the best land and became the
most powerful.
 The king’s court: These free individuals were courtiers to the king and
lived in large residences around the royal palace complex. 
 Ordinary people: These free individuals were known as the demos. The
word ‘demos’ is very important; see Chapter 4 where I look at the birth
of democracy. These merchants, farmers, and artisans lived outside the
palace complex. 
 Slaves: The few available Mycenaean texts list slaves as having been the
property of the king and working at the palace. It’s highly likely that the
Mycenaeans captured slaves from their foreign wars, because this was
the most common method of obtaining them.
Working for a living
Evidence indicates Mycenaean society had a far more developed set of social
and work roles than what historians know of the Minoans. Farming was still
the main profession for the majority of people, but in and around the palace
complex some Mycenaeans worked as scribes, administrators, or artisans
such as potters and smiths, depending on the king’s patronage. 
More interestingly, the Mycenaeans developed what modern people think of
as industry. One of the biggest industries was metallurgy, particularly the
production of bronze, which was essential for a warlike people like the
30
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Mycenaeans. Some of the tablets that have survived suggest that a significant
proportion of the population were involved in metallurgy in the town of
Pylos, and historians assume that other towns had similar arrangements.
The Mycenaeans were also heavily involved in the production of textiles.
Evidence shows they produced up to 15 different textile varieties, mostly
from wool and flax. Other industries included ivory carving, stone carving,
and perfume making.
A large amount of what the Mycenaeans produced was sold abroad. For
example, Mycenaean vases have been found in Egypt, Sicily, Western Europe,
and as far away as Central Europe and Great Britain.
Expanding in all directions 
After the collapse of Minoan civilisation with the fall of Knossos (see the ear-
lier section ‘Going out with a bang’), the Mycenaeans became the big players
in the western Mediterranean and took over much of what had been Minoan
settlements. For example, they took over the town of Miletus, which had been
a Minoan colony, and the same thing happened on the island of Samos.
But the Mycenaeans didn’t just focus on trading with and taking over their
western neighbours. They took a much more aggressive interest in the east-
ern Mediterranean than the Minoans – not only trading with these areas but
also establishing outposts and colonies. Bases were set up on several islands
like Rhodes and Cos, where merchants stayed and acted as middlemen, let-
ting the industries in Pylos, Argos, and elsewhere know what the local mar-
kets required. The island of Cyprus and the ports on the coast of modern-day
Syria were particularly big trading centres, but the Mycenaeans also traded
with ports on the coast of Asia Minor.
Eventually, the Mycenaeans were in charge pretty much everywhere, 
including:
 The crumbling Hittite Empire: By around 1300 BC, expansion brought
the Mycenaeans into contact with the other big, warlike civilisation at
the time – the Hittite Empire.
The Hittites had nothing to do with the Greeks; they were a completely
different people. By the time that they came into diplomatic contact with
the Mycenaeans, the Hittites had become the dominant force in Asia
Minor, Syria, and as far east as Mesopotamia. The Hittites had come
from north of the region and spoke a very different language. Their
biggest enemy were the Egyptians, with whom they were continually
fighting for control of Syria.

There aren’t any records of the Hittites and the Mycenaeans having any
military contests, but within a few years of coming into contact with
each other in 1300 BC the Hittite civilisation had collapsed. Historians
don’t really know why, but some archaeologists have suggested that the
Hittites may have experienced a devastating civil war. 
 The city of Troy: The most famous of all the Mycenaean expansions was
the destruction of the city of Troy around 1250 BC. Archaeology shows
that the end of Troy was probably the work of a western Greek army like
that of the Mycenaeans. I talk more about the myth and reality of Troy in
Chapter 21.
With the Minoans destroyed, the Hittite Empire at war with itself, Troy con-
quered, and no real threat from anyone elsewhere in Greece, the Mycenaeans
should have dominated the Mediterranean for generations to come. They
were the dominant military power and economically self-sustaining, with a
large trade network throughout the Mediterranean and beyond . . . but then
something happened. Historians aren’t exactly sure what occurred because it
happened during the region’s Dark Ages (see Chapter 3 for more info).

n around 1200 BC the whole of society in the eastern Mediterranean was in
trouble. In the east the Hittite civilisation had collapsed and huge numbers
of people fled west into Syria, Palestine, and as far as Egypt. Around the same
time the Mycenaean world fell apart (refer to Chapter 2). After this civilisa-
tion’s last big hurrah at Troy, something devastating happened back at home.
All the big Mycenaean city centres were attacked and utterly destroyed.
Mycenae and Pylos were burned and never fully recovered. And around 50
years later a second sequence of attacks finished off the remaining cities.
The damage was devastating and conclusive, and the Greek world was 
humbled by it. A huge amount of the learning and technology that the
Mycenaeans had developed during the past 500 years was lost. The big cities
were abandoned and left as permanent landmarks to the memory of those
Mycenaeans who’d died, with vast numbers of people deciding to move and
re-establish themselves in other areas of the Mediterranean.
It took 300 years for the Greek world to recover, but recover it did. Although
the Mycenaean culture was gone, never to return, a new set of Greek people
developed, with new cities, kingdoms, and – by around 750 BC – a new form
of written language that scholars recognise as ancient Greek.
So although historians refer to the period of around 1100 to 750 BC as ancient
Greece’s Dark Ages, light was shining at the end of the tunnel. The changes
ancient Greece experienced during its Dark Ages are the focus of this chapter.

The term ‘Dark Ages’ is actually quite a misleading one. The term suggests a
time when nothing much happened – as you’ll see from this chapter, that’s
not the case! The idea of a Dark Age comes from the fact that historians are
uncertain about exactly what happened and who went where. The age is dark
in terms of information, not innovation!
Surviving the Dorian Invasion
So what cataclysmic force overwhelmed the mighty Mycenaeans in around
1200 BC? Well, according to the Greeks themselves, the Dorians did it.
Later ancient Greek historians describe the destruction of Mycenae and 
the burning of other Mycenaean cities as being the work of a powerful army
from the north that swept down over the Peloponnese mountains and into
southern Greece. 
The Greeks filled in the gaps in their knowledge with myth and stories – a
phenomenon I describe in detail in Chapter 2. The Dorians may well have
been an example of this process.
According to the Greeks, the Dorians were a people who came from the 
north and smashed the Mycenaeans. Many Greeks believed the Dorians
descended from a group of people called the Heraclids. The Heraclids were
thought to have been the descendants of the great Greek hero Heracles 
(or Hercules as the Romans called him) who’d once lived in southern Greece
under Mycenaean control but had then been sent into exile. The Heraclids
regrouped and eventually returned, led by King Hyllus, to wreak revenge on
their former masters. 
The famous Greek historian Thucydides, who was writing 500 years after the
end of the Mycenaean civilisation, had no doubts about what had happened:
Eighty years after Troy the Dorians and the sons of Herakles made
themselves masters of the Peloponnese. It was with difficulty and over a
long period that peace returned.
Many other versions of this story existed then and now, and all accounts
seem to point to an invasion into Greece by a big army from the north or
north-west. 
Exactly who the Dorians were remains a mystery. What is important, how-
ever, is that by 1100 BC things had changed. The Mycenaeans had disap-
peared, many people had fled from their homes to a new life elsewhere, and
the map of the region was very different.

Travelling into a New (Dark) Age
The movement of most people from mainland Greece during the Dark Ages
had a huge effect on the rest of the Mediterranean. Imagine if today all the
people living in a city like London suddenly left and began to look for some-
where else to live in Britain. The effect on the lives of people throughout the
UK would be huge. Obviously big differences exist between life then and now,
but some considerations are constant: The Greeks needed water, food, shel-
ter, and enough land to be able to sustain themselves and their families. 
Unsurprisingly the Greeks ranged far and wide in their search for new land.
Some went east toward modern-day Turkey and beyond; others went west to
Italy, Sicily, and, by the seventh century BC, North Africa. These big migra-
tions during the Dark Ages are one of the reasons why the history of ancient
Greece is so fragmented. 
As I note in Chapter 1, being Greek during this time was more a state of mind
than a nationality. Well, the migrations of the Dark Ages contributed signifi-
cantly to this experience.
Heading east
A vast number of people leaving mainland Greece headed east across the
Mediterranean toward Asia Minor. Traditional Greek myth/history says that
these people fled to the city of Athens and then on to an area known as the
Ionic Coast (see the map on the Cheat Sheet), establishing ancient Greece’s
roots in a matter of a few years. The official version of events soon became
that this movement of people was a single event of colonisation, with one
population group moving from their original home to make a new one.
As ever, the truth is slightly different. The transfer of people from mainland
Greece to the coast of Asia Minor was a migration rather than a colonisation.
This process took place over a number of years rather than in one big trip.
For one thing, an adequate fleet of ships wouldn’t have been available for
such an undertaking. Furthermore, the stuff about Athens is just propaganda.
Many years later, when Athens was building up its empire from many of these
Greek towns, saying that the original inhabitants had come from Athens
made for a good argument to go back and aggressively force the towns to 
join their empire and pay a tribute! (For more on this empire-building, see
Chapter 7.)
A much more likely comparison of the process is that of the Pilgrim 
Fathers leaving England for America, a brave and adventurous group of
people embarking on a journey of discovery without really knowing too 
35
Chapter 3: Shedding Light on Ancient Greece’s Dark Ages

much about the land that they were going to. Again like the Pilgrim Fathers,
these on-the-move Greeks were a mixed group from all around the mainland.
Whole towns wouldn’t have moved at once and each successive migration
would have been made up of a mixed bag of people. It was only when they
made land and founded a new place to live that they became a new ‘people’.
Those that had headed east became known as the Ionian Greeks because 
the coastland and nearby islands they inhabited were known as Ionia.
Confusingly this region had nothing to do with the Ionian Sea, which refers 
to the stretch of water between Sicily, Southern Italy, and Western Greece.
Although the two words look exactly the same in English, they meant 
different things in ancient Greek.
Meeting the neighbours
Although much of the territory of Ionia was uninhabited when the Greeks
arrived, the areas to the immediate north and south weren’t. These areas
were called Aeolis and Doria (so-called because some Dorian Greeks had
ended up living there) and they’d both been populated for some time. 
 Aeolis: The people to the north of Ionia were known as the Aeolians.
They were probably also Greeks who had left the eastern Greek main-
land a little before the travellers who became known as the Ionians.
Later Greek writers maintained that the Aeolians were the sons of
Orestes, the son of the famous Mycenaean king Agamemnon. But this 
bit of genealogy is just a myth. The area known as Aeolia was very 
fertile, and the Aeolians seem to have spent their time as relatively 
contented farmers.
 Doria: To the south of Ionia was Doria, which was under the control of 
a very different people called the Carians. The Carians spoke an old 
language that was different from the Greek languages. They’d been in
contact with the Mycenaeans and had absorbed a lot of Greek culture
but they were definitely not Greek. Like the Aeolians they were, in the
main, farmers.
The Greek writer Strabo describes the Carians as barbaroi, which gave
rise to the modern word barbarians. Strabo’s word choice came from 
his belief that when the Carians tried to speak Greek, they made a noise
that just sounded like ‘ba, ba, ba’! The Greeks used this word to describe
anybody who was a non-Greek speaker.
Establishing new Greek cities
The new Ionian territory was made up of 12 major cities. Two of them were
on the islands of Chios and Samos and the others, such as Ephesus and
Smyrna, were on the mainland (see the Cheat Sheet map). 
36
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

In the main, the new settlers built their settlements on peninsulas just away
from the mainland. These areas were linked to the mainland by narrow 
causeways, or isthmuses. These locations were beneficial for a few reasons:
 The new cities enjoyed relatively cool temperatures along the hot Asia
Minor coastline. 
 The geography offered natural harbours that the new inhabitants used
for trading supplies and receiving friends and relatives from the Greek
mainland.
 The new cities were more secure from attack because they had water 
as a natural barrier on one side and freshly built fortifications on the
landward side. 
Early on, these new towns weren’t particularly remarkable – but they 
became tremendously important later on. Constantly involved in the strug-
gles between Greece and Persia, they were eventually used as an excuse for
the invasion of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great. (For more on
Alexander the Great, march to Chapter 11.)
Soon after their foundation, the cities were nothing more than increasingly
popular trading spots. The trade that they engaged in, however, brought
them into contact with a culture that had a major impact on ancient Greeks –
the Phoenicians.
Trading with the Phoenicians
The Mycenaeans had been adventurous traders and their kings had spent
their wealth on luxuries from the east, in particular Syria and Egypt. The
knowledge gained from trade routes in the eastern Mediterranean became
more wide-spread on the Greek mainland and helped with the migrations 
that followed the collapse of Mycenaean civilisation. 
37
Chapter 3: Shedding Light on Ancient Greece’s Dark Ages
The Greeks learn to write
The Greeks in the east were in very close asso-
ciation with the Phoenicians and picked up from
them something far more important than any
treasures or fancy goods. At some point around
750 BC, Greeks in the east began to use the
Phoenician system of language notation, which
led to the Greek alphabet. Although some letters
and forms varied depending on where ancient
Greeks lived throughout the region, the basic
underlying principles of the Phoenician-based
system became standard throughout the
Mediterranean. In fact, the Greek expression for
writing is phoinikeia grammata, which means
‘Phoenician writings’.
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The main traders in luxury goods from the east were the Phoenicians. 
The Phoenicians were originally from the east, possibly as far east as the
Persian Gulf, and they established themselves in the city of Tyre on the
Syrian coast, in the area known now as Lebanon. From there they eventually
founded colonies as far away as Cadiz in Spain and most famously Carthage
in North Africa.
Going west
While the great migration of people to the east took place, things continued
to happen on the Greek mainland. Archaeology indicates that the tenth and
ninth centuries BC (900–700 BC) was a period of great poverty on the Greek
mainland. After the destruction of the Mycenaean civilisation, a great deal of
the established industry and infrastructure disappeared. Society became
entirely dependent on agriculture, and the number of inhabited sites
decreased significantly.
The old system of Mycenaean kings was dependent on wealth, so when the
kings were eliminated, society changed too. The old palace culture of the
Mycenaeans disappeared (see Chapter 2), and a levelling out of social classes
took place. In each community, power became shared among a group of the
most influential people rather than one man. I write more about these
changes in Chapter 4. 
The most immediate result of these societal changes was another wave of
migration. Around 750 BC new groups of people were looking to leave main-
land Greece. This time, the people weren’t fleeing invasion (see ‘Heading
east’ earlier in this chapter). Instead, they were: 
 Discontented nobles who’d lost influence
 Struggling farmers who were looking for new territories to cultivate
With the Ionian Greek cities firmly established to the east, these new trav-
ellers had to look elsewhere for fresh land – and they looked to the west, as
Figure 3-1 shows. 
Settling in Italy
One of the western-bound Greek travellers’ first ports of call was southern
Italy. In fact, so many early ancient Greeks migrated to Italy that the Romans
later called the south of Italy and Sicily Magna Graecia, which was Latin for
‘Greater Greece’.
38

In the eighth century BC westward migrating ancient Greeks founded the
Italian towns of Neapolis (Naples), Kapue (Capua), and Taras (Taranto).
These towns became very rich and powerful thanks to their close trade links
with mainland Greece and beyond. The towns maintained their independence
for more than 500 years until the Romans finally conquered them and
absorbed them into their empire.
On the island of Sicily, the most important new town by far was Syracuse 
(see Figure 3-1). Greeks from the city of Corinth founded Syracuse in around
734 BC. They were led by Archias, who named the town Sirako after a nearby
swamp. Due to its excellent position for trading, Syracuse grew very quickly
and became immensely wealthy. The money was spent on extending the 
harbour facilities and defences and for some time Syracuse was considered
to be the most powerful Greek city in the whole of the Mediterranean.
Setting up in Egypt
Coincidence is a wonderful thing. Just around the time that ancient Greeks
were establishing more western towns and initiating trade across the
Mediterranean, the ancient civilisation of Egypt opened its doors to trade.
For thousands of years Egypt had been closed to Mediterranean society.
Egypt had no need to trade with anybody because it was so fertile and pretty
much self-sustaining. For more on the histories and mysteries of ancient
Egypt, check out The Ancient Egyptians For Dummies by Charlotte Booth
(Wiley).

During ancient Greece’s Dark Ages, Egypt was invaded and conquered 
by its great rival Assyria, led by the great monarch Assarhaddon. The
Assyrians ruled Egypt for several generations until Assurbanipal, one 
of Assarhaddon’s successors, was the victim of a big revolt led by
Psammetichus. Psammetichus was probably from Libya in North Africa 
and had raised a mercenary army from all around that included new 
Greeks from Ionia and Caria. After he won a tremendous victory over
Assurbanipal, one of Psammetichus’s first acts was to open the doors of
Egypt to his new allies.
This meant that Greeks could now trade with Egypt and travel there to expe-
rience the country. As a result, many Greeks encountered the art and archi-
tecture of Egypt for the first time, and the rich Egyptian culture had a huge
impact on them. For more on the Greeks’ interactions with the Egyptians, 
see Chapter 17.
Venturing into Cyrene
Psammetichus came from present-day Libya in North Africa, and the Greeks
soon established a town there too. In around 630 BC, a group left the small
island of Thera and founded the town of Cyrene (shown in the map in Figure
3-1). Cyrene was in a great location, roughly halfway between Carthage and
Egypt, and it very quickly became large and wealthy.
Ancient Greece’s Dark Ages were actually a tremendous period of travelling
and expansion, which changed the map forever. People living on opposite
sides of the Mediterranean now, appropriately, claimed to be Greek and
spoke a version of the Greek language. Large trade networks were building 
up and these new international Greeks were adopting new things such 
as writing.
Back on mainland Greece, however, something equally remarkable was 
happening: old social structures were breaking down and new rulers 
emerging. Read all about it in Chapter 4.

f you leave a group of people in a room together for long enough, they’re
bound to end up having an argument about something. TV these days is
based around this concept. Usually the disagreement comes up because
somebody feels unable to express a point because others aren’t listening.
The same was true 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece. Back then the argu-
ments were about who controlled the towns and cities that had developed
after the big migrations that I write about in Chapter 3. Unlike most argu-
ments, however, these ancient disagreements ended up producing something
amazing.
This chapter is the story of how a bunch of farmers and aristocrats managed
to invent the system of government that still exists throughout the world
today – democracy.
Shaping the New Societies
When ancient Greece’s Dark Ages came to an end in the eighth century BC,
the communities that had survived in mainland Greece were very small and
simple. The big expansions overseas involved thousands of people leaving
the Greek mainland, severely weakening the old Mycenaean power centres
(see Chapters 2 and 3).

As a result most ancient Greeks at the end of the Dark Ages were likely to live
in small villages ruled by local nobles and wealthier citizens with the most
land. Life for most people was very tough, and the chances of improvement
and advancement very small. Depending on who you were, you filled a cer-
tain place in society. You were born into your position, and change was virtu-
ally impossible.
As an ancient Greek at the end of the Dark Ages, your family and your clan, or
extended family that you came from, were the most important considerations
in your life. Your ultimate superiors were local lords to whom you and the
rest of your community paid tribute.
Over about half a century, these very local communities began to come
under central control by one town. This change probably wasn’t the commu-
nities’ choice; they were most likely forced into the new arrangement by
threats and violence from another town in the area that wanted to expand its
territory. Probably the most significant example of this was what happened in
the region of Attica in western Greece (see the Cheat Sheet map) because it
resulted in the formation of the city of Athens. Several important families in
the region fought and plotted against each other for hundreds of years. But
by the seventh century BC, the region was in the hands of an aristocratic
elite.
Meeting the ruling class
In the seventh century BC the people of Attica were ruled by what they con-
sidered to be a king, but this leadership wasn’t what modern people would
understand as a king. The ancient Greeks used the word basileus to describe
42
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
Remembering Theseus
The shift from local governments to a cen-
tralised government took place before the
Greeks started recording their own history.
Without recorded history to rely on, the Greeks
often turned to characters and events from their
mythology to explain things. 
Some later writers credited the mythological
noble Theseus (see Chapter 2) for bringing the
whole of the region of Attica under centralised
control. He did this by setting up a council of
nobles that met regularly and made decisions
about the running of the area as a whole.
Of course, one man wasn’t solely responsible
for uniting the entire, and significantly large, ter-
ritory of Attica. Still, the Athenians’ mythologi-
cal hero proved a very useful story to gloss over
the years of fighting and plotting among several
wealthy families in the region.

a king. This word translates as ‘sovereign’, so the individuals weren’t actually
kings in the sense of Henry VIII. A basileus was just one of a board of annually
elected officials – like councillors or local government officials – called the
arkhons. This board formed a ruling council that met at a spot known as the
Areopagus on the Hill of Ares in Athens and exercised control over Athens
and the region of Attica. Eventually the title basileus became used to describe
an arkhon with special religious duties.
Although this combination of a basileus and an arkhon may sound like a move
toward a more open form of government, the arrangement wasn’t really much
of a change. The opportunity to be an arkhon wasn’t open to everybody –
only those born into the leading aristocratic families in Athens had the right
to stand for election. The elections were also only open for the aristocrats to
vote in! So in a way the government was as much of a closed shop as it had
been under the earlier king-led system. The aristocrats were still in control;
there were just more of them.
The aristocrats themselves clearly recognised the exclusive nature of the
system because they named the group the Eupatridai, which means ‘the sons
of good fathers’. 
The power structures found in Athens and the Attica region during this
period weren’t all that different from the surrounding area. Throughout
Greece and the Mediterranean at the time, the vast majority of people who
ruled did so based largely on the qualifications of wealth and birth. The aris-
tocrats were generally the oldest families who’d lived in the area longest –
and therefore grabbed all the best land when they arrived. Consequently,
they become the wealthiest and the most influential citizens.
Introducing the new middle class
People always find something to argue about, and the system of government
in Athens was no different. Any agreement among the aristocrats held only
for as long the entire ruling group agreed. If one man wanted to take all the
power for himself, the system could break. Indeed, by the seventh century
BC the relationships among the various aristocratic families in Athens had
reached a breaking point, but another potentially bigger problem existed –
the growing middle class.
As Athens had grown and expanded, it had become wealthier. In particular,
people who made money from trade or successfully farmed less attractive
land were frequently as wealthy as the leading aristocrats. Although these
successful individuals made up Athens’s new middle class, they were still
born outside the noble families and had no chance of being elected to rule.
43

Around the same time big changes were happening to the way that the
Athenians made war and fought against their enemies. The Athenians had
adopted the hoplite method of fighting (see Chapter 5), which brought
together and armed many male Athenians. Unsurprisingly this group soon
realised they had enormous power at their disposal.
This mixture of middle-class discontent and burgeoning military strength was
a time-bomb waiting to go off. All that was needed was an individual with the
charisma and drive to take advantage of the situation and initiate massive
change. 
Surviving the Cycle of Tyranny
The Greeks used a word called turannos that means ‘the rule of one’ and is
the source of the modern word tyrant. However, the ancient Greeks’ notion of
the tyrant didn’t necessarily have the connotations of cruelty and harshness
that it does today. 
The earliest surviving instance of the word tyrant is in a poem by
Archilochos. This piece of verse talks about the tyrant Gyges who reigned in
Lydia in Asia Minor between 680 and 640 BC:
To me the possessions of Gyges rich in gold are of no concern, envy has not
seized me, and I do not look with jealousy on the works of the gods, nor do 
I passionately desire great tyranny; such things are far from my eyes . . .
Nevertheless, many of the tyrants who seized control in ancient Greece did
go on to run repressive regimes, as the following sections explore.
Kylon: Discovering that tyranny 
is harder than it looks
The first attempt at tyranny in Athens was a failure. In 640 BC, Kylon tried to
take advantage of the discontent in the city (see the preceding section).
Kylon was an interesting character. He was a former winner at the Olympic
games (see Chapter 16 for more on the Olympics), which made him very pop-
ular with the common people who saw him as a hero. He also had the back-
ing of his father-in-law Theagenes, who was the tyrant of Megara. 
According to the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, Kylon acted on the
advice of the Delphic Oracle by trying to sieze Athens during the Festival of
Zeus when much of the city was otherwise engaged. Unfortunately for him
44
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

the plan failed and he was forced to flee to the temple of Athena. Kylon was
persuaded out by a promise that he wouldn’t be harmed but then stoned to
death! Although Kylon’s plan was a total failure, it was a warning of what was
to come. 
Drakon: Changing the rules
Discontent rumbled on in Athens, and the Eupatridai responded to Kylon’s
action by attempting to tighten their control on the city. Around 620 BC,
Drakon published the first-ever Athenian law code, defining the rules by
which Athens would be governed. (These laws were deliberately harsh, and
Drakon’s name is the source of the word draconian.) 
In particular the laws tried to break down the idea that people should look to
their own family for justice and take vengeance when someone had been
wronged. Drakon’s laws made clear that justice was the role of the state. This
might not seem like such a controversial idea to us but it was establishing the
state as able to interfere in private affairs. This was a big change because pre-
viously it had been the role of the individual to protect his own household.
The law particularly affected the aristocrats of Athens who’d previously
acted as they wished. Drakon was attempting to get this group under state
control – a laudable aim but probably for his own benefit rather than any-
body else’s.
Enter Solon: A Man of the People
With so many tensions pulling at the organisation of society, ancient Athens
seemed about to break. The Athenians recognised how critical the situation
had become and in 594 BC appointed Solon, a middle-class Athenian who’d
made his money from trade, as arkhon. Solon is very interesting to histo-
rians because he’s the earliest Greek historical figure who’s famous, well-
documented, and real. 
In fact, Solon was the first ancient Greek to write his autobiography. It wasn’t
actually a book but he composed numerous poems for people to recite and
so remember his achievements after he was long gone. 
To the people I have given such privilege as is enough neither taking away
nor adding to their honour. While those who had power and were famed for
their wealth, for them I took care that should suffer no injury. I stood,
holding out my strong shield over both, and I did not allow either to triumph
unjustly.

Making changes
Boasting aside, Solon did have a tough job to do. Athens was in a difficult 
situation with all the classes feeling hard done by. As a result, Solon made
some sweeping changes, including:
 Cancelling debts: Solon introduced legislation that he called the
seisakhtheia or ‘the shaking off of burdens’. Many peasants with small
amounts of land were effectively paying protection money to members
of the aristocracy from whom they rented it. If their crops failed they got
further and further into debt and eventually had to vacate the land.
 Defining new political classes: Solon divided the city population politi-
cally based on agricultural wealth. This policy broke the exclusive
power of the Eupatridai, and the wealthiest citizens in Athens now had
the opportunity to become arkhons regardless of whether they came
from one of the city’s original families.
 Establishing the new council of 400: By far Solon’s biggest change was
the introduction of a new council called the boule. This assembly was
made up of 400 citizens, 100 from each of the four Athenian clans, and
gave an opportunity for the rest of the citizen body to participate in
debate. 
The reforms of Solon were publicised in an interesting way. All the individual
laws were numbered and inscribed on wooden tables or axones. Each law
was then quoted by number, like items on a take-away menu. Citizen were
required to swear an oath that they would obey the new laws for the next ten
years, the idea being that the laws would be revised a decade later.
Stepping out of the limelight
Solon’s reforms seemed like real progress. His policies attempted to prevent
the Eupatridai from lording over the rest of the population, reduce the eco-
nomic problems of the lower classes, and give the lower classes a voice in
the process of running the city. 
Unfortunately Solon was one of the first people to discover that you can’t
please all the people all the time. His debt laws proved extremely popular
with the lower classes and greatly helped poor farmers but the leaders of the
aristocratic clans were hugely resentful. Nevertheless, it kept more people
working on the land, which was Solon’s intention. But his political reforms
had an entirely different outcome as the aristocrats tried to seize back con-
trol (see the following section ‘Bouncing Back to Tyranny’).

Solon retired from public life. The details of his later life are sketchy. Some
people say that he went travelling but it seems that he eventually returned to
Athens. Unfortunately by the time he died in 558 BC he saw all his good work
undone by the vengeful Eupatridai and other opportunists.
Bouncing Back to Tyranny
After the crumbling of Solon’s reforms and a brief period of political anarchy,
Athens was ripe for potential tyrants. Several people made attempts to seize
power. By far the most successful was the man who dominated Athens in the
sixth century BC – Peisistratos.
Peisistratos: Playing the system
While Solon had been trying to solve Athens’s social and political problems,
the city had been in conflict with the neighbouring city of Megara. During the
conflict the Athenians had successfully attacked and captured the port of
Nisaea, an ally of Megara. The leader of the expedition was called Peisistratos,
and his military success encouraged him to launch a political career.
Solon’s reforms and the chaos that followed had led to a split amongst the
Athenian people. On the one side were the aristocrats and on the other were
the democrats, from the Greek word demos which meant ‘the people’. The
democrats believed that Solon hadn’t gone far enough in giving power to the
whole population. 
Peisistratos targeted the democrats as allies. In 561 BC he appeared in the
agora or public square covered in blood and claiming to have been injured by
his political enemies. He used the ensuing public outrage to his advantage
and seized control of the city.

Anarchy!
The whole point of Solon’s reforms was to 
stop Athens from falling victim to tyrants.
Unfortunately the same old problems soon
cropped up again. The period immediately after
Solon is another one for which historians don’t
have many sources. Researchers do know that
in around 589 BC, Athens fell into a struggle
among the aristocrats that was so bad no 
arkhons were elected for two years. The Greeks
used the term anarkhy – meaning ‘without 
arkhons’ – to describe this time. Of course, this
is where the modern word anarchy comes from.

Essentially Peisistratos played Solon’s system to his own advantage.
Peisistratos didn’t change anything that Solon had put in place; by using
bribery and intimidation he just made sure that every year his own support-
ers were elected as archons. Eventually people were keen to vote for his sup-
porters as they realised that their own prospects of advancement would be
limited if they didn’t. Simple really.
Out, in, and back out again
Peisistratos’s grip on power was actually quite simple to break. He dominated
Athens for five years until a faction of aristocrats led by a man named
Megacles managed to drive him into exile in 556 BC. 
However, Megacles was unable to keep hold on the argumentative elements
within his own party, and within a few years, he sought to reconcile with
Peisistratos, sealing the deal by arranging that the former tyrant marry his
daughter. In 550 BC Peisistratos returned to Athens a hero.
Of course, Peisistratos didn’t stick to the arrangement with Megacles.
Peisistratos already had two sons from his first marriage, and he wanted
them to take power after his death. Consequently, he treated Megacles’s
daughter badly and refused to recognise her as his wife so as not to weaken
the position of his sons. 
Unsurprisingly Megacles was upset about the situation and immediately
betrayed Peisistratos to enemies. After a very brief power struggle,
Peisistratos was forced into exile once again.
Regrouping abroad
In exile for the second time, Peisistratos learned from his mistakes. This
second exile was much longer, lasting over a decade. During this period,
Peisistratos realised that to truly dominate Athens he needed support from
other powerful states throughout Greece. The benefits of this strategy were
two-fold:
 The Athenians would see Peisistratos as the only person able to handle
the foreign affairs of Athens.
 Peisistratos would be able to immediately build up an army to help him
grasp and keep hold of power.

Peisistratos spent ten years building up support in Macedonia, Thessaly, and
other places to the north of Athens (refer to the Cheat Sheet map). Finally, in
540 BC, he landed with an army at Marathon and swept virtually unopposed
into Athens. He declared that he was the true and legal ruler of the city. He
was back in power and this time he wasn’t shifting for anybody.
Enjoying the benefits of tyranny
Peisistratos stayed in power for the next 13 years, and during this time
Athens undeniably went through a boom period. Peisistratos’s aggressive for-
eign policy built up Athenian territory around Greece and generated a lot of
revenues. 
In fact, during this time some of the earliest of ancient Greece’s impressive
building projects began. Virtually all of the building programmes attributed
to Peisistratos are now lost but he’s said to have initiated the building of sev-
eral religious buildings in the agora (the main town square, like the Roman
forum) as well as a large palace for himself. The knock-on effect was that
artists were attracted to Athens – like artists in Renaissance Italy, creative
people went where the money was. Peisistratos’s other cultural achievement
was the introduction of two new elements to religious festivals; the singing of
dithyrambs (hymns sung in honour of the gods) and also tragic drama. To do
so he introduced the first orchestra (performance space) in the city.

Chapter 4: Governing by Kings, Tyrants, and (Eventually) Democrats
Noble failures – Harmodios and Aristogeiton
In 514 BC, two lovers named Harmodios and
Aristogeiton attempted to end Hippias’s rule 
by assassinating Peisistratos’s other son,
Hipparkhos, during a public festival. The plot
succeeded, but Harmodios was killed during it
and Aristogeiton was captured and died under
torture.
But despite the relative failure, the two assas-
sins became celebrated figures in Athens and
were considered to be important heroes in the
struggle for democracy. Unfortunately, this cel-
ebrated status wasn’t quite based on truth.
Harmodios and Aristogeiton were both aristo-
crats and wanted to get rid of Hippias so they
could replace him with another set of aristo-
crats. But the romance of their story ensured
their fame.
Harmodios and Aristogeiton became such
celebrities that several statues were erected to
their memory in Athens. The rose-tinted view of
their exploits was also remembered in later
ancient Greek drinking songs like this one:
In a branch of myrtle I shall bear my sword
like Harmodios and Aristogeiton when the
two of them slayed the tyrant and made
Athens a city of equal rights.

Hippias: Tyranny as a family business
Peisistratos’s hold on power was so complete that when he died in 527 BC he
was able to hand over control to his son Hippias. Unfortunately for Hippias,
his father’s personality had been a big part of his success. Many people who
had previously supported Peisistratos turned against Hippias.
After the assassination of his brother (see the nearby sidebar ‘Noble failures –
Harmodios and Aristogeiton’), Hippias became more severe, and many influ-
ential aristocrats were forced to flee Athens. Those individuals who stayed
needed fresh help. The people who they turned to were something of a 
surprise – the Spartans.
Getting to Know the Spartans
Although the Athenians couldn’t have known it at the time, the Spartans were
to become their mortal enemy and also the most feared and famous fighting
force in the ancient world.
The city of Sparta was to the south-west of Athens in a region called Laconia
(take a look at the Cheat Sheet map). The Greek term for the region was
Lacedaemon, and that’s why the Spartans are sometimes referred to as the
Lacedaemonians. Their way of life was considered to be brutal and without
luxury, hence the modern word Spartan, which means simple and non-
luxurious.
Growing up Spartan 
The Spartans first came to prominence after the Dorian invasions (see
Chapter 3 for more details) when the old inhabitants of the region were
kicked out and replaced by tribesmen from the north-west and Macedonia.
Being both very warlike and very good at it, the Spartans soon gained control
of the whole of Laconia. By the time that Hippias was tyrant in Athens, Sparta
was the leading power in southern Greece.
Two things made Sparta very different from all the other Greeks states:
 Sparta was the only state to have a standing professional army. Read
more about this in Chapter 5.
 The Spartans governed themselves. Other cities in Greece were experi-
menting with new forms of government and different systems (see the
sidebar ‘Know your ocracies’, later in this chapter), but the Spartans
had a form of government and social organisation that was fixed and
unchanging.

In short, Sparta had two kings who were the top dogs, taking the roles of gen-
erals in war and chief priests in peace. A group of elected officials called the
ephors and a council called the gerousia carried out the actual administration
of the state. The system wasn’t particularly unusual except for the fact that
many positions were for life and were full-time jobs. Thus, the aristocracy of
Sparta devoted their entire lives to the official business of Sparta – which
included fighting many wars. 
Getting involved in Athens
The Spartans were a warlike people keen on furthering their territory, and
they had a pretty brutal attitude toward violence and death – all of which
makes them a surprising choice for the Athenian aristocrats seeking their
help. 
Yet after the failed attempt to remove Hippias, the Athenian aristocrats were
forced to look to Sparta for help. According to the Greek historian Herodotus,
Sparta had a reputation as being sympathetic to requests for help from states
under tyranny. In addition, a prophecy from the Delphic oracle (see Chap-
ter 21) suggested to the Spartans that they should involve themselves in the
Athenian situation.
The end result was that in 510 BC, the Spartan king Kleomenes led his troops
into Athens and forced Hippias and his entire family to flee. He couldn’t have
imagined what would happen next.
51
Chapter 4: Governing by Kings, Tyrants, and (Eventually) Democrats
Living the hellish life of a Helot
Nearly all the citizens of Sparta were involved
in running the state and were brought up since
childhood to perform their roles (see Chapter 5).
An unfortunate group of people known as the
helots carried out farming, labour, and all other
manual work required by Sparta. These people
were serfs (or workers) owned by the state. The
helots had come to their position because their
land had been incorporated into the Spartan
state, and they were now forced to work for it.
It was a grim existence: The helots worked hard
for little reward and no chance of bettering their
station in life.
Helots made up 90 per cent of the Spartan pop-
ulation. As a result, the Spartans were always
worried about revolts and developed a particu-
larly unpleasant way of keeping power over the
helots. Because the helots didn’t count as
Spartan citizens, they could technically be con-
sidered foreigners or enemies. Consequently
every year the gerousia would vote to declare
war on the helots and then carry out massacres
to keep the numbers down. The Spartans also
considered that this brutality was a useful way
of giving young soldiers practice at killing.

Considering Kleisthenes: The 
Beginnings of Democracy
When Kleomenes intervened in Athens and restored the usual form of gov-
ernment, fresh elections were held. One of the candidates was a man called
Kleisthenes. When Kleisthenes made a series of important reforms to the
Athenian constitution in 508 BC, he never imagined the impact he’d have on
the history of mankind. Kleisthenes’s change – arguably – created the idea of
demokratia or ‘rule of the people’. 
Rather than being the product of some high-minded ideals, democracy was
the result of another aristocratic squabble. Kleisthenes himself was a blue-
blood Athenian aristocrat. The year before he had lost out to a fellow aristo-
crat, Isagoras, in the election for arkhon. Rather than seek revolution or look
for military support, Kleisthenes appealed to the common people for sup-
port. In this case, the ‘common people’ were individuals who didn’t really
have a voice, even after the reforms of Solon; people such as traders and
farmers without much land or social status.
Kleisthenes proposed new laws in the ekklesia that allowed all citizens to
take part in the process of government. Unsurprisingly Isagoras tried to block
the moves, but he didn’t have enough support. As a result, Isagoras called in
Kleomenes of Sparta to quell the unrest in the city.
Kleomenes and his troops turned up in Athens, but he took things a bit too
far, expelling 700 pro-Kleisthenes aristocratic families from the city and then
leaving Isagoras to sort things out himself. Isagoras attempted to abolish
Kleisthenes’s reforms, but Kleisthenes responded by returning to the city
with a small number of troops and forcing Isagoras to surrender. Finally,
Kleisthenes was able to complete his proposed reform.
Reforming and reorganising
In essence Kleisthenes only made one big change: He scrapped the wealth-
based classes that Solon had created nearly 90 years before and instead
divided the population in terms of where people lived.
To do this Kleisthenes created ten new phulai, or tribes. Your tribe depended
on where in the city you were born rather than which class you were from or
how much money you had. Each tribe was further divided into demoi, or
demes. These were smaller districts, like the constituencies or wards making
up a City or County Council , a few streets or a zip-code district. The demoi
became the units in which local business was done and meant that demoi
representatives could take the views of each local area to the ekklesia and
get it on the agenda to be discussed.
52

After Kleisthenes’s reform a massive section of the Athenian population that
previously hadn’t been able to gain citizenship now could. Theoretically the
change meant that any citizen from any social status could become an
arkhon.
In actuality, things didn’t turn out like this – and it was very unlikely that
Kleisthenes wanted any other result. During the next century nearly all the
people that ruled Athens continued to be aristocrats.

Chapter 4: Governing by Kings, Tyrants, and (Eventually) Democrats
Knowing your ocracies
Although Athens is heralded as the birthplace
of democracy, many different forms of govern-
ment existed in ancient Greece and democracy
was just one of them. Here are some common
governmental forms (and examples from
ancient Greek history):
 Democracy: Literally the ‘rule of the people’.
In a democracy, the people make decisions
about the policy and actions of their com-
munity. In the ancient world, this tended 
to be participative (people actually voted
and debated themselves) rather than 
representative (where they elected some-
body to do it for them). For more on democ-
racy, see Chapter 7.
 Monarchy: Rule by a king or queen. In this
form of government, an absolute ruler is
unelected, and his or her authority is
unquestioned. The monarch may (or may
not) be able to appoint a successor.
Monarchy of a type was very popular in
early Greek culture and survived through-
out Asia Minor and in Macedonia.
 Oligarchy: Rule by the few. In early Athens,
the aristocrats descended from the region’s
early settlers who had claimed the best land
functioned as an oligarchic governing body.
 Plutocracy: Rule of the wealthy; from the
Greek word ploutos, meaning wealth. A
minimum property or wealth requirement
was usually in place for those who wanted
to take part in government. Plutocracies
were normally mercantile communities like
several of the Greek islands such as Samos.
 Timarchy: Nothing to do with people called
Tim; derived from the Greek word time,
which meant honour or respectability. In
practice, a timarchy could be anything from
the strongest warrior to the most respected
family ruling a region. Many people argue
that Sparta was a timarchy and some
Mycenaean states are good examples of
warrior timarchy.
 Tyranny: Literally ‘rule by one’. In ancient
Greece, the individual often seized power
but sometimes he was voted in. The Greek
meaning didn’t have the negative associa-
tions that it does in the modern world.
Throughout the ancient world these and many
more systems flourished – or they were com-
bined as suited a particular political moment.
For example, the Roman Empire was essentially
an oligarchy but with elements of plutocracy; at
certain points it was fundamentally a tyranny!

Taking small steps toward democracy
What Kleisthenes achieved wasn’t democracy in the way you think of it
today. Athenian political involvement depended on citizenship, which meant
no women, resident slaves, or resident foreigners were able to vote. Also, it
was highly unlikely that anybody outside the aristocratic elite had the money
or influence to win an election. 
However, Kleisthenes did recognise the power of popular opinion (and how
he could manipulate it). The changes that he made ensured that the reform-
ers who followed him in the fifth century BC could create something truly
extraordinary. I talk about how the system worked in Chapter 7.
When Kleisthenes was making his reforms at the end of the sixth century BC,
the word the Greeks used for popular rule was isonomia, which literally
meant ‘equality under law’ and referred to the status that the creation of the
tribes brought to all citizens. The Greek word demokratia had a much more
serious meaning and referred to the people holding all power. The Athenians
would have considered that their state was a demokratia and would have
described it as such. So demokratia was an Athenian invention!
Challenging the new order
The Spartans weren’t best pleased with the political reforms of Kleisthenes
and were quick to respond when he kicked Isagoras out. In 506 BC,
Kleomenes returned with another Spartan army intent on forcing Kleisthenes
and his supporters out for a second time, but the Spartan attack didn’t work.
The mass public support that Kleisthenes was able to call on saw the
Spartans soundly defeated, and the same happened to invading armies from
elsewhere the following year.
The reforms of Kleisthenes had banded the people together to a common
cause in a manner ancient Greeks hadn’t previously experienced.

Fighting and Warring: 
Greece Gets Heavy
In This Chapter
 Outfitting warriors with armour and weapons
 Training like a Spartan
 Fighting strategically on land 
 Battling at sea
Timokritos was bold in war. This is his grave. 
Ares the war-god spares the coward, not the brave.
–Anakreon of Teos (circa 550 BC)
L
ike death and taxes, war is something that seems likely to always be part
of being human. Even today, with much of the world at peace, wars are
still going on all around. For the luckier individuals and nations, war is 
something experienced from afar through newspapers, TV reports, and 
re-creations in films. You might know people affected by war – but for many,
war is not a close-to-home experience. 
In ancient Greece, however, the situation couldn’t have been more different.
War was essentially ever-present. Depending on who you were, war was
either a threat or an opportunity for glory. If you were male then, whatever
your social status, your involvement was likely to be brutal, painful, and right
in the thick of battle. In ancient Greece warfare was upfront and personal.
In this chapter I cover the basics of Greek warfare on sea and land, focusing
on the experience of war and warfare in ancient Greece from the end of the
Dark Ages (around 750 BC) through to the rise of Macedonia (around 350 BC).

I describe the activities and equipment involved in war, how various combat
tactics developed, and why the Spartans (see Chapter 4) became famous for
being so good at fighting. 
I examine specific techniques as they relate to particular battles or time peri-
ods in other chapters. For example, Chapter 8 offers details on siege warfare,
which was critical during the Peloponnesian War and when Athens was under
siege by the Spartans.
Joining the Fight
When a war took place in ancient Greece it involved all men of fighting age.
Most modern states have armed forces to fight wars for them, and fighting,
patrolling, and eventually keeping peace after battle are these people’s jobs.
But in ancient Greece, responsibility wasn’t divided up this way. If a town was
attacked, it had to defend itself, and that meant that every male citizen who
was old enough (and not too old) to hold a sword took part in the effort.
Indeed, officers and (in the case of Sparta, kings) were required to fight in the
front line in just the same way as common men. War was a great leveller in
ancient Greece. The experience on the battlefield was the same for every
man, regardless of station.
In short, the vast majority of the city states that I write about in Chapters 2,
3, and 4 defended themselves by using a citizen militia, an army made up of
the male citizen population and led by officials chosen by the state or elected
by the people. For example, if you wanted to stop somebody from attacking
your farm and stealing your property, you had to protect it yourself. The only
exception to this citizen-led system was Sparta, a city-state whose whole
system was built around constructing and maintaining a fearsome standing
army (a group of men who had no other responsibility than war, a profes-
sional force). See the later section ‘Living for Killing: The Spartans’ for more
info.
One fascinating aspect of ancient Greek warfare is how little it changed over
many centuries. Yes, tactics improved, as did the calibre of weapons, but if
you took a soldier from 750 BC and put him in the middle of a battle with
Alexander the Great in 350 BC, the basic experience was amazingly similar –
even though 400 years had passed. So what I write about arms, armour, and
tactics in this chapter goes for much of the historical period from 750 BC to
350 BC. (Of course, I make mention of any changes and differences whenever
appropriate.)

Dressed to kill: Hoplites
Ancient Greek soldiers were referred to as hoplites. Hoplites were standard
infantrymen who fought in formation at a battle (see the section ‘Getting 
tactical: Hoplite formations’). 
By far the most important development in Greek warfare was the discovery
of iron in approximately 1200 BC. Prior to this, all metal weapons were made
of bronze. Iron is tougher, more hard wearing, and incredibly strong in com-
parison. When wielded by a powerful warrior, an iron sword could literally
split a bronze weapon in two.
By the eighth and seventh centuries BC, the hoplite’s equipment (or panoply)
had become fairly standard, as Figure 5-1 shows.
57
Chapter 5: Fighting and Warring: Greece Gets Heavy
Fighting like a Homeric hero 
Ancient Greek males had to learn to fight and
use weapons. Much of this was done through
physical exercise in the gymnasium (see
Chapter 16) as nearly all Greek sports were
developed out of practising the skills needed to
fight in war. 
In particular, the Greeks considered Homer’s
Iliad, the epic poem of the Trojan War, a mine of
information on all manner of subjects (for more
on The Iliad and its influence, see Chapter 20).
The only problem with using this great work of
literature as a training manual is that the char-
acters are a lot to live up to. Indeed, the Greek
and Trojan warriors in The Iliad fight like super-
heroes – battling for hours and laying waste to
scores of enemies, with seemingly no consider-
ation for tactics, formations, or obeying orders. 
In this typical scene from The Iliad the Greek
hero Patroclus is tearing into the Trojan fighters.
Patroclus kept on sweeping in, hacking
them down, making them pay the price for
Argives slaughtered. There Pronus, first 
to fall – a glint of the spear and Patroclus
tore his chest left bare by the shield-rim,
loosed his knees, and the man went crash-
ing down.
In the next thirty lines of the poem Patroclus kills
another ten warriors in equally unpleasant ways
without even stopping to pause for breath!
Although the weapons and armour described by
Homer are similar to those the ancient Greeks
actually used, everything else was very differ-
ent. In particular, real-life battle focused much
less on one-to-one combat, and those lengthy
introductory speeches before a fight began
probably didn’t happen.
Nonetheless, the tales in The Iliad and indeed
those elsewhere in mythology were a great
influence on later Greeks because they
regarded the nobility and skill of the warriors
mentioned as the ultimate example of what they
should aspire to.

Armour
Ancient Greek armour was heavy but not as heavy as the gear worn by an
armoured knight from the Middle Ages. The Greek soldier needed to be able to
run fast and be as flexible as possible, so he kept his armour to a minimum.
The most important piece of armour was called the cuirass. This piece pro-
tected a soldier’s body but left his arms free to fight – rather like wearing a
sleeveless t-shirt but much, much heavier. 
The cuirass was made in two separate ways. One was to stitch together many
layers of canvas and linen to fashion a kind of rigid shirt with strips of bronze
sewn in to reinforce it. The other, much more expensive way was to cast the
cuirass completely in bronze, muscled to fit the shape of the body.
The legs were protected by greaves, which were made of bronze and cast so
that they fit the legs of the soldier without using any kind of straps. The
greaves protected the front of the leg between the knee and ankle with a par-
tial covering around the calves. Soldiers wore normal sandals with no extra
armour or protection.
Helmet
Helmets were bronze, and many different styles existed. The most common
was the Corinthian (see Figure 5-1), which had an opening at the front with a
long strip of bronze as a nose-guard. Many soldiers wore a horse-hair crest on
top of their helmet but this was purely for display rather than protection.

Shield
The shield was known as a hoplon, and that’s where the hoplites got their
name. By the seventh century BC, the typical shield was about 1 metre 
(3 feet) in diameter. It was round in shape, made of wood and reinforced 
with bronze. The inside most likely had two brackets. The soldier put his arm
through one bracket and gripped the other. 
Sometimes soldiers hung leather curtains from the bottom of their shields to
use as a barrier against rocks, arrows, and missiles. The shield would’ve been
really heavy, probably about 8 kilograms (17 pounds).
Weapons 
Hoplites carried two main weapons into battle:
 Spears: These were the most important weapon and quite big and cum-
bersome – about 3 metres long, made of wood, and tipped with iron at
both ends (refer to Figure 5-1). Given their size, they weren’t thrown like
javelins (covered in ‘Cavalry’ later in this chapter) but used for thrusting
and defence. 
 Swords: These weapons were quite small, only around 60 centimetres
long and would have only weighed about 1.5 kilograms but they were
very deadly at close quarters. They were made of iron with a bronze
handle and carried in wooden scabbards. Another version of the sword,
called a kopis meaning ‘chopper’, was longer, heavier, and used with a
slashing motion – usually from horseback.
59
Chapter 5: Fighting and Warring: Greece Gets Heavy
The arms trade
For the ancient Greeks, a complete panoply (all
the armour and weapons I write about in this
section) was really expensive. Every soldier had
to buy his own panoply, and looking after this
equipment was important. Only the very rich
would have had somebody to tend to their
equipment for them in the way that medieval
knights did. For everybody else their panoply
was their own concern and many men used
armour and weapons that their grandfathers
and fathers had bought because the cost of
replacing these items was so great. Hence, the
panoply that you owned in ancient Greece gave
a good indication of the class you came from.
Anybody who owned a full hoplite panoply
would’ve been from the wealthier middle or
upper classes.
Although arms and armour were expensive, the
poet Archilochos of Paros (circa 650 BC) made
it clear what was most valuable to take from the
battlefield:
I don’t give a damn if some Thracian ape
struts, proud of that shield that the bushes
got. Leaving it was hell, but in a tricky spot.
I kept my hide intact. Good shields can be
bought.

Considering other troops
Although hoplites dominated warfare in ancient Greece, other types of troops
took part in battle.
Cavalry
Cavalry weren’t a big feature of early Greek warfare, partly because providing
and paying for horses was incredibly expensive. The endeavour was also
very risky. The Greeks rode without stirrups and mostly only used cloths as
saddles. Ancient Greek cavalry were excellent horsemen; they needed to be
because their main weapon was the javelin – actually several javelins – that
they threw while on the gallop. A cavalry soldier didn’t carry a shield or wear
any armour. His only covering was a broad-brimmed hat that helped keep the
sun at bay. 
By the time of Alexander the Great (356–323 BC), cavalry had become a vital
part of the Greek war machine. For more on how the cavalry developed, see
Chapter 10.
Light troops
Sometimes the Greeks used lightly armed troops for special missions, like
scouting and ambushing the enemy. These troops were called peltastai
because they carried the light shield called a pelte. The pelte was usually a
goatskin stretched in a crescent shape across a wooden frame. It was incredi-
bly light and only really useful for deflecting small missiles from the peltastai.
Peltastai were most often armed with a small bundle of javelins, which they
used strictly for hit-and-run operations. 
Archers
Archers appear a lot in Greek mythology. The hero Odysseus was famed for
his skill with the bow, and arguably the most famous of all Greek warriors,
Achilles, was killed when he was hit in the heel by the Trojan archer Paris. It
was this story that gave rise to the expression ‘Achilles heel’ because it was
the only vulnerable point on his body. The most famous Greek archers were
from the island of Crete. 
Greek archers were very lightly armed. The bows themselves were made of
cedar wood with animal sinew used for the string. The bow would usually be
the only weapon carried by the archers because it was vital that they could
move quickly as the battle changed, so they could attack fresh targets.
Despite this, archers weren’t often used in Greek battles. The Greeks felt that
it was more honourable to fight face to face and archers were sometimes of
little use when a heavily armed phalanx (see the following section) was fight-
ing in formation. Some Greek armies did use archers that hailed from Scythia,
the large region to the north of Asia Minor. Athens kept a troop of Scythian
archers, which Peisistratos (refer to Chapter 4) introduced. These archers
were used mostly as a police force and not in battle.

Films such as Troy (2003) and 300 (2006) can make it seem as if a Greek battle
just involved everybody charging at each other in the midst of a general
punch up. This was far from the case. Greek battles were fought along rigid
tactical lines that meant each man knew exactly what his job was. 
The hoplite infantrymen were dominant in ancient Greek warfare at the
expense of all other types of fighting because they were so effective. The
strength of hoplites came down to the shield. The hoplon shield was lighter
than the larger shields that soldiers had used previously. As a consequence,
men began fighting closer together in battle, and the hoplite phalanx devel-
oped – a powerful battle formation in which the hoplites lined up in files 
(see Figure 5-2), probably eight men deep. 
In the phalanx the troops set out in an open formation, marching or jogging
alongside each other with weapons sheathed until it was time for battle.
When a battle began, these open formations closed up, so that each man
occupied only about 1 metre of space. Moving close together meant that the
right-hand side of each man was pretty much covered by the shield of the
man to his right – and so on all along the line. Tightening their formations
produced the effect of a wall of shields that the hoplites then thrust their
spears over or in between. Figure 5-2 shows how close the men were to each
other and how they covered the man to their left.
Each man should have

Let battle commence!
Hoplite tactics were very regimented, reducing the role of the individual to
that of a cog in a well-oiled machine. This was a complete departure from the
super-heroes in The Iliad (see the sidebar ‘Fighting like a Homeric hero’ for
more points of departure). 
After battle began, the role of each hoplite soldier was to push forward
against the man in front. If the man in front of you fell, you moved forward
and took his place in the line. 
The Spartan writer Tyrtaeus, who lived in the seventh century BC, wrote
about fighting as part of a hoplite phalanx:
Everyone should close up to his man with his great spear or sword and
wound and kill his enemy. Standing leg to leg, resting shield against shield,
crest beside crest and helmet to helmet having dawn near, let him fight with
his man with his sword or great spear.
The key element to the battle was to push forward and at some point force
the line of the enemy to break. After this happened, the fight was usually all
over. 
Reports of ancient Greek battles usually suggest massive casualties for the
losers and only very minor ones for the victors. Although the figures are
probably inflated, an imbalance between winner and loser makes sense: After
the losing line broke, the victorious army would chase its men down as the
soldiers fled the field, resulting in most of the killing that took place. Cavalry
and light troops were also brought in at this point to chase the enemy down.
Imagining the abject terror of fighting in a battle like this may be difficult
given modern warfare tactics. On the ancient Greek battlefield, you had no
hiding place; you were face to face with your enemy. If you didn’t kill or
severely injure the man across from you first, he would kill or injure you. All
around you, other men were dying of the most horrific injuries. You’d have
had no time to save them or offer help.

‘Are you calling me a coward?’
Any soldier who ran from the ancient Greek bat-
tlefield would drop his shield to move more
quickly. The Greek word for this was rhipsaspis,
or ‘one who throws his shield away’. Calling
somebody a shield-dropper was a huge insult.
Although ancient Athens didn’t have an equiva-
lent to modern laws of libel or slander, you could
take somebody to court if he called you a 
rhipsaspis.

Living for Killing: The Spartans
As I note in Chapter 4, the people of Sparta were different from the rest of
ancient Greece – and indeed the western world – in many respects. Their 
attitude was that you returned from battle with your shield – or on it (as a
funeral bier or stretcher). The Spartans didn’t believe in half-measures, and
their standards of military discipline were absolute. 
Military training for Spartan boys began when they were just 7 years old. At
this age, boys left home and joined the education system. This comprehen-
sive curriculum including hunting skills, physical training, and also emotional
training – designed to teach bravery. 
One particularly brutal element of Spartan education was called ‘The
Gauntlet’ and involved boys running around and being continually flogged by
older children until they fell down or, in some cases, died. 
The final Spartan training exercise, called the krypteia, involved sending
young men (possibly as young as 14) into the countryside alone with no food
or water and requiring them to live on their wits for a month. Sometimes a
krypteia also included the task of killing helots (see Chapter 4 for more on
these people) found wandering the countryside. 
Although these young men probably stole food to survive, stealing was con-
sidered a crime. A story from Plutarch shows the lengths that one young boy
went to in order to hide stolen property:
The boys take great care over their stealing, as is shown in the story of one
who had stolen a fox cub and hidden it under his cloak, for he endured
having his stomach lacerated by the beast’s claws and teeth, and died rather
than be detected.
Their training and ability to endure hardship made the Spartan army more
feared than any other in Greece. 
After completing their training, Spartan men became part of the army in
which they had to serve until the age of 30. Between 30 and 60, they became
part of the military reserve, which could be called upon at any time. 
Sink or Swim: At War on the Waves
As I explain in Chapter 1, ancient Greece was very spread out, with people
living as far apart as modern-day Spain and Turkey considered to be Greek.
Consequently the wars that took place weren’t always fought on land, and the
63

Greeks developed quite complicated methods of naval warfare. (I only talk
about war ships in this section; you can find information on other types of
sailing in Chapter 13.)
Getting on board the Greek trireme
The standard Greek fighting ship was known as the trireme, which comes
from the Greek word trieres meaning ‘triply equipped’ or ‘three oared’. The
triple description comes from the three banks of oars that the crew used to
propel the ship forward.
These ships were 40 metres long and about 4 metres wide – long, stream-
lined, and built to travel as quickly as possible. They relied on the power of
oars, although sometimes they incorporated a sail. Before going into battle,
the crew lowered both the sail and mast.
The construction of this sort of ship was time consuming but followed a very
specific model. The keel (central long section) was assembled first and then
all the additional planking fixed to it and sealed. As you can see from Figure
5-3, the finished ship couldn’t sit very low in the water because the lowest
oars were only a few feet above the water. The ships were fast but not very
robust and wouldn’t have been suited to surviving really difficult weather.
Meeting the crew
Each trireme had a crew of about 200 – a lot of people on board a small ship.
The vast majority of the crew were on board to make the vessel move. Here’s
the crew roster:
 Rowers (170): Unlike in the Roman empire, the men who rowed the
ancient Greek warships weren’t slaves. They were well-trained citizens
from the lower classes who ended up as sailors because they could not
afford the panoply to be soldiers.

Rowing was hard, back-breaking work – continually digging in to heft the
4 to 5 metre (15 foot) oars. On a trireme, the rowers were arranged on
three different levels: 62 upper rowers (thranites), 54 middle rowers
(zygotes) and 54 lower rowers (thalamites). 
 Flautist (one): Rather like the cox or skipper on a modern row boat, this
flute-player helped the rowers keep time.
 Marines (14): These individuals were usually a mixture of hoplite 
soldiers and a few archers (probably Scythian).
 Deckhands (15): These soldiers had the vital work of keeping the ship
functioning – making repairs and working the sails and tiller (steering). 
 The captain: The captain of the ship was called the trierarch. He was
responsible for everybody on board and the tactics in battle. He’d allo-
cate duties to the various deckhands, all of whom would take turns on
watch at night. Generally the trierarch took responsibility for navigating
and setting course because that was considered a duty of command.
With all these people on board, triremes weren’t particularly useful for 
transporting land soldiers around. The majority of Greek wars were fairly
localised, so most soldiers would march to battle but if they had to be 
moved across the sea, they travelled on normal merchant ships, guarded by
triremes.
Being nautically tactical 
Fighting at sea was completely different to land battles. The great strengths
of the hoplite fighters (see the earlier section ‘Getting tactical: Hoplite forma-
tions’) weren’t very useful on the water. The two main attack methods were
ramming and boarding. 
 Ramming: Because the Greek ships sat low in the water, a ramming
caused damage so severe that the rammed ship would sink. Surprisingly,
if it was done correctly, it would cause very little damage to the attacker. 
 Boarding: When fighting at close quarters, boarding was usually the pre-
ferred attack method and often took place after a ramming. Boarding
usually involved grappling hooks, ropes, and other equipment to get a
hold of the enemy ship. Eventually the Greeks developed something that
the Romans called the corvus (Latin for ‘raven’), which was a kind of
bridge that swung onto the enemy vessel. Hand to hand fighting did take
place in naval battles but the sides would have to be close enough
together to do so first! The marines could only really actively engage
with each other when the ships had locked together.

With both sides relying on fairly similar equipment, the Greeks had to
develop attack strategies to gain an advantage over their enemies. The three
main strategies, illustrated in Figure 5-4, included:
 The diekplous involved targeting one ship in the enemy line and turning
it, breaking open a hole in their line. Any enemy ship that turned to aid
the stricken ship ended up exposing its flank to the attackers too.
 The kyklos was a defensive formation that was used when a fleet was
outnumbered or being pursued by a faster fleet. The ships formed a
circle with their rams facing outwards, projecting at their pursuers. 
 The periplous was an attacking move that was designed to outflank the
line of the enemy.

East versus West: 
The Persian Wars
In This Chapter
 Expanding the Persian Empire
 Joining the multi-faceted Persian army
 Fighting the big battles: Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea
P
eople in the ancient world experienced many and varied wars. Usually
the fighting was more of a local thing, with neighbours acting on long-
term grievances. Occasionally one city or region attempted to bring another
city under its rule. Some wars, however, were massive, international events.
The Persian Wars certainly come under this category.
Struggles between the west and the east are a big feature of history. The
Persian Wars were followed by Alexander the Great’s invasion of Asia Minor
in the fourth century BC, the struggles of Alexander’s successors afterwards,
and eventually ongoing trouble between the Roman Empire and the Persians’
successors, the Parthians.
Today, because the differences between east and west continue to cause fric-
tion and often escalate into confrontation, the Persian Wars of the fifth cen-
tury BC have never seemed so relevant. This chapter introduces the ancient
Persians and examines the problems they had with the Greeks. 
Powering Up the Persians
The Persian Empire came into being in the sixth century BC, around the same
time that Athens was going through the changes that eventually resulted in
the beginnings of democracy (refer to Chapter 4). Much of the empire’s early
success can be attributed to King Cyrus and his progeny.

Taking charge with Cyrus
Within a period of about 40 years, the hugely successful Persian king Cyrus
the Great took control of all the territory between Asia Minor (modern-day
Turkey) and the Asian Steppe (modern Russia to the east of the Black Sea). 
A people called the Medes previously held most of this territory, but Cyrus
effectively defeated them when he occupied their capital of Ecbatana in 
549 BC.
Cyrus established this new Persian empire based around the city of Susa on
what became known as the Persian Gulf (modern-day Iraq). As Figure 6-1
shows, this empire was absolutely vast, covering a huge geographical area of
almost three million square miles.
Having gained control of such a vast area, Cyrus began to look to the west to
further consolidate his territory and gain control of all the trade routes that
passed through his empire to the Mediterranean Sea. 
In fact, trade was what first brought the Persian Empire into contact with the
Greek world. In 546 BC Cyrus fought and defeated Croesus of Lydia. During
the Dark Ages, Greeks had established many new towns and settlements in
Lydia (refer to Chapter 3 for more on Greek movements in the Dark Ages).

With Cyrus’s victory over Croesus, the mighty new Persian power was less
than a week away by sea from the Greek mainland. Furthermore, Cyrus
divided Asia Minor and the newly conquered Greek mainland into provinces
that were each run by a satrap – a local lord who controlled the area and its
people and collected revenues, which he sent back to the king. The Ionian
Greeks were now under foreign control.
The Greeks of the mainland were shocked to become subjects of the Persian
Empire. The Ionian Greeks pondered how to respond to their new rulers, and
eventually the Spartans acted. They sent an embassy to Cyrus and ordered
him to leave the Ionian Greek cities alone. Cyrus’s puzzled reply was, ‘Who
are the Spartans?’ Cyrus did nothing and ignored them but confrontation
with mainland Greece was inevitable.
Cyrus continued to expand the empire by attacking and conquering the fabu-
lous ancient city of Babylon, which had remained independent of his rule to
this point. After he was killed during a war in the north of the territory,
Cyrus’s successors continued to expand and refine the empire, and in 512 BC
the Persian king Darius extended the empire’s reach as far as Thrace and
Macedonia. 
The Greek playwright Aeschylus fought at the battle of Marathon (see the fol-
lowing section ‘Going the Distance: The Battle of Marathon’) and wrote a play
called The Persians in 472 BC. In the play, the chorus of Persian elders give
their opinion of Darius. Aeschylus was a Greek but his depiction of the
Persian attitude seems authentic:
Alas! It was a glorious and good life of social order that we enjoyed, while
our aged, all-powerful, guileless, unconquerable King god-like Darius ruled
the land. Firstly, we displayed glorious armies, which everywhere
administered tower-like cities.
Rebelling with the mainland: 
The Ionian revolt 
Greece and Persia eventually came to blows. The Persian army was much
larger and more cosmopolitan than the mainland Greeks (see the nearby
sidebar ‘Assembling a league of nations: The Persian army’), but the main dif-
ference between the two armies was that the Greeks generally wore heavier
armour and fought in a closely regulated formation (refer to Chapter 5) and
the Persian troops donned light armour and were armed in a variety of ways. 
69
Chapter 6: East versus West: The Persian Wars

The Persian army’s mix of troops was one of its strengths, but it also inspired
rebellion. During Darius’s campaign in Thrace at the end of the sixth century,
the contingent from Ionian Greece saved the Persian forces from defeat. The
Greeks took their success in the Thrace campaign as a sign of Persian weak-
ness and saw an opportunity to revolt.
A Greek called Aristagoras, who Darius had appointed to rule all of Ionia from
Miletus, travelled to the Greek mainland to canvas support from the Ionian
Greeks. The Spartans – surprisingly turning down an opportunity to be diffi-
cult and to fight – refused to join Aristagoras. The Spartan king Kleomenes
apparently felt that the Persian Gulf was too far to travel for the cause of
Greek liberation.
Eventually Aristagoras gained support from Athens and the city of Eretria.
The revolt initially met with success, but the rebels couldn’t sustain the
uprising against Darius’s massive forces. Darius had a whole empire to call on
and could routinely devote 50,000 men to the campaign (see the nearby side-
bar ‘Assembling a League of Nations’). Eventually in 494 BC Darius’s army
attacked Miletus and razed it to the ground. The revolt ended, and
Aristagoras fled to Thrace where he was eventually captured and killed while
trying to drum up support for a fresh revolt. The campaign had taken over
70

Assembling a league of nations: The Persian army
The Persian Empire was huge and included
many cultures; consequently its army was very
diverse. Here are some of the main troops:
 Persian ‘immortals’: These full-time soldiers
were of Persian origin and were the king’s
elite troops for ceremonial as well as battle
purposes. They were known as the ‘immor-
tals’ because of their incredible courage
and fighting prowess – they fought like
gods. There were always 10,000 of them
and whenever their numbers dipped after a
battle, more troops were brought up. The
immortals’ main weapons were the bow
(which wasn’t very effective against heavy
Greek armour; see Chapter 5), short spear,
and short sword. They also used large
wicker shields called gerrons that were
fairly light and quite manoeuvrable although
not as strong as Greek bronze. 
 Mede cavalry: Lightly armed cavalry was
the Persians’ other main force in battle. The
cavalry’s main weapons were the bow and
javelins, which the horsemen fired while
riding at speed. Very impressive.
 Phrygian spearmen: Recruited from Asia
Minor, these were very fast spear throwers
who were also highly manoeuvrable. They
wore hardly any armour apart from a rein-
forced wicker helmet and a small round
shield.
 Ethiopian troops: The vast Persian Empire
even drew troops from Africa. These troops
were generally referred to as Ethiopians,
even though they had nothing to do with the
modern country. The soldiers were very
simply armed with a bow and spear and
wore no armour at all.

five years and Darius blamed the Greeks for it. Although the Ionian Greeks
had caused the problems, Darius felt that it was the states on the Greek main-
land which had been behind the uprising. His focus would now be on extend-
ing his empire west across the Mediterranean.
Going the Distance: The 
Battle of Marathon
In 490 BC, four years after the fall of Miletus, Darius’s army crossed the
Aegean Sea intent on the invasion and conquest of mainland Greece. The
Persians had sent agents ahead of them to scout the land and try to arrange
support from some Greek states. They’d been successful and the city of
Eretria on the island of Euboia allowed the Persian army to land. From
Eretria, the mainland was a simple trip by boat, landing in north-east Attica at
the bay of Marathon only about 40 kilometres from Athens.
With the massive Persian army perilously close to Athens, the Athenians had
to decide whether to stay in the city and face a siege in the hope that the
other Greek cities would come to their aid, or go outside the city walls and
march out to meet the Persians in battle.
Many believe the origin of the word marathon relates to an unnamed runner
who brought back news of victory – the Greek word nike – to Athens. (This
runner was also the first ever piece of product placement in history!)
However, this isn’t true. Marathon actually relates to a runner named
Pheidippides who was sent from Athens to Sparta to tell the Spartans that
the Persians had arrived. Pheidippides was the first Marathon runner. Only in
later versions of the story was his run changed to being from Marathon to
Athens.
Even though Pheidippides delivered his message, the Spartans didn’t come
to the Athenians’ defence against the Persian invasion. The Spartans were
celebrating a religious festival and refused to leave, so the Athenians were on
their own. Led by the general Miltiades, they advanced to attack.
The battle: First blood to Athens
In the battle between the Athenians and Persians, the Persians were over-
whelming favourites. They had a force of around 25,000 men including 5,000
cavalry. By contrast the Athenians mustered only slightly less than 10,000
hoplites (see Chapter 5 for more on the hoplites) and no cavalry at all. 
71
Chapter 6: East versus West: The Persian Wars

The Persians made camp close to the sea in the bay of Marathon with a large
marsh behind them and they marched out toward the small Athenian army
with the sea to their left, as Figure 6-2 illustrates. 
Additionally the Persians sent some infantry and all their cavalry by ship to
Athens. The odds were almost impossible: The Athenians had to beat the
Persians near Marathon and then dash back to Athens ahead of the Persian
strike forces to defend their city.
The dire situation forced a bold Athenian strategy. As the Persians advanced,
the Athenians ran towards the centre of its infantry line. Despite the fact that
they were in arrow range, the Athenians’ heavy armour protected them. The
centre was the Persian army’s weakest point, and it began to crumple. Many
Persians were shocked and began to flee – some into the marsh and others
back to their ships. 
Instead of pursuing the Persians, the Athenians held their discipline and set
off on an amazing forced march back to Athens, despite the fact that they’d
all just fought in one of the hardest and most nerve-racking battles of their
lives. They made it back about an hour before the Persian strike fleet. When
the Persians arrived they saw they were outnumbered, and sailed back
across the Mediterranean empty handed.

In the final reckoning the Persians lost about 6,000 men to the Athenians’ 192.
These few Athenian dead were buried with great ceremony in a mound that
still exists. It was a magnificent victory – but the Persians would be back (see
the following section ‘Having Another Go: Greece versus Persia II’). 
Athens hits the jackpot
Marathon was a tremendous victory for Athens, but what followed was
almost as important. 
In 483 BC the discovery of silver in the mines at Laureion in Attica immedi-
ately brought fabulous wealth to Athens. This new wealth was a huge boom
for the middle classes, but eventually the Athenians decided to spend their
riches on something they desperately needed – a fleet.
The encounter with Persia showed the Athenians that mainland Greece was
truly at the mercy of the Persian navy. By 480 BC the Athenians constructed a
fleet of nearly 200 ships (Chapter 5 has more on Greek naval warfare). The
motivator for this was the arkhon (elected official) Themistocles who
famously told the Athenians to ‘Lay hold of the sea’. 
The people took him at his word as further fighting with Persian forces
demonstrated. 
Having Another Go: Greece 
versus Persia II
Darius wasn’t around long enough to hold a grudge against the Athenians; 
he died in 486 BC. However, he was succeeded by his son Xerxes who was
absolutely determined to gain revenge for his father’s defeat and began to
assemble a massive army and fleet.
Regrouping in Greece
The Greeks knew Xerxes would return to Athens and realised that a com-
bined effort was required if the Greek mainland was ever to defeat the
Persian forces.

In 481 and 480 BC, representatives of the major Greek cities held two big con-
ferences at which 31 Greek states pledged to put aside their differences and
join together against Persia. They erected a monument at the sacred site of
Delphi as a visual symbol of their new unity. The conference also voted that
the Spartans would have overall command of the joint army. For the fractious
Greeks, this level of agreement was amazing.
The Greeks definitely needed to be united, because the size of the second
Persian force was extraordinary. Ancient sources talk about a force of about a
million, but the number was probably around 150,000 as the logistics
involved in moving and feeding an army any larger than that would have
made the invasion almost impossible.
Heating up at Thermopylae 
and Artemision 
As the Greek troops made their way south, they had to choose a strategic
location to make a stand against the Persians. Eventually the leaders chose a
small pass in the southern Greek mainland near the mountains and the sea.
The location was the famous natural sulphur springs – Thermopylae, literally
meaning the ‘hot gates’. It was a good choice because if they wanted to avoid
going through the narrow pass, the Persians would have to take a massive
diversion. Either way, they’d be held up until the Greek forces further south
were fully organised.
Having chosen Thermopylae as the point at which to stand the Greeks sent
their new fleet, which was mostly composed of the new Athenian ships (see
the earlier section ‘Athens hits the jackpot’), to Artemision, a promontory
sticking out of the north-east corner of the Euboean peninsular where they
hoped to stop the Persian fleet from joining up with its army.
The famous 300
Barely 7,000 Greek troops fought at Thermopylae, all under the command of
the Spartan king Leonidas. The fact that only 300 of the troops were Spartan
made the Greeks doubt the level of the Spartans’ commitment. However,
Leonidas chose the narrowest point of the pass to defend and, incredibly, he
and his troops held on for two days against wave after wave of Persian
attacks. Although other Greeks took part in this battle, the 300 Spartans were
at the forefront, thus the famous ‘300’ of the film!
After several attacks were rebuffed with high Persian casualties, Xerxes paid
a local goatherd for information about an alternative route. This was another,
even narrower track that took a longer way around the mountains. Xerxes
sent a large group of his army’s 10,000 immortals (see the sidebar
74
Part I: Travelling Back in Time 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

‘Assembling a league of nations: The Persian army’) on this alternate route in
an effort to get behind the Greeks. 
Historians don’t know why, but Leonidas dismissed the vast majority of the
Greek troops, leaving only his 300 Spartans and a few others. After a heroic
defence that slowed up the Persian advance, Leonidas and his men were
eventually overwhelmed. The Persians advanced swiftly further south but
the hold up had been vital.
The heroism of Leonidas and the Spartans became legendary. The Spartan
poet Simonides paid tribute:
Stranger, go tell the Spartans that we lie here
Obedient to their laws.
Simonides’s lines were probably the ultimate expression of the Spartan ideals
of bravery (refer to Chapter 5). Leonidas and his men had taken on a fight
that they knew they could never win but had stayed and fought to the last
man ‘obedient to their laws’.
The action film 300 (2007) is based on a stunning graphic novel by Frank
Miller and depicts the events at Thermopylae. Although the film has some
fantastic elements and over-the-top scenes, the violence and brutality of the
battle scenes are very accurate. It’s worth seeing but is in no way a historical
representation. It presents the Greeks as heroes and the Persians as evil – 
a very biased version. It also includes mythical beasts – none of the Greek
historians mention them!
Meanwhile, at Artemision
While the battle at Thermopylae raged, the weather along the coast at
Artemison was stormy, causing the Persians to lose large numbers of ships
on the rocks. The Persians were further surprised by the Greek fleet, which
captured several more of its ships. What remained of the Persian fleet sailed
on south with the intention of meeting up with Xerxes and the land force
before launching an attack on Athens.
Seeking safety in Salamis 
The Greeks did exceptionally well at Thermopylae and Artemision to hold up
such a massive army but it was nothing like a victory. The city of Athens was
in a tricky position after these battles because it was left very exposed. The
huge Persian army was moving south and looking to attack the city. The
arkhon Themistocles realised that the city could never hold out against such
vast numbers, so he persuaded the citizens to put their faith in the Athenian
fleet.
75
Chapter 6: East versus West: The Persian Wars

The citizens of Athens abandoned their city and fled to the island of Salamis,
and the Athenian fleet positioned itself near the island. The Persians took
their chance and sacked (looted and vandalised) the empty city as the fleet
travelled south. The Persian fleet then moved around the peninsular of Attica
and approached the island of Salamis, but to get any farther they had to get
past the Athenian fleet. 
The Persians still had the advantage of numbers, but the Greeks countered
with stealth and deception. The Greeks used a brilliant five-step plan:
1. They sent a false message to Xerxes the Persian king, telling him that the
Greek fleet intended to flee north-east to the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes
fell for the message and sent the Egyptian section of his fleet off to block
the fake move.
2. At dawn the Greek fleet put to sea and headed north into the narrow
channel between Salamis Island and the mainland. A small section of
ships from Corinth went south to defend against the Egyptians who were
soon to find out that they’d been conned.
3. Another small section of Greek ships hid in the small bay called
Ambelaki to the south of the narrow channel.
4. The massive Persian fleet, thinking that the Greeks were fleeing, followed
the Greeks into the narrow channel. The Athenians turned to face them,
and the Persians were stuck. The Greeks rammed the Persian ships, and
the Persian commander was one of the first casualties. Chaos ensued.
5. The small fleet hidden to the south caught the Persians as they tried to
flee back down the channel, and the Corinthians (remember them from
Step 2?) stopped the Egyptians from coming back to help.
The Persian fleet was routed (utterly devastated and incapable of recovery).
They lost about 200 ships to the Greeks’ 40.
Entering the endgame: 
The battle of Plataea 
After the events near Salamis, the Persian fleet was in pieces, which meant its
army was cut off from supplies. As September came – and with it the end of
the sailing season – Xerxes decided to head north for the winter to rest his
army and spend time organising supplies. In the event, Xerxes decided he’d
had enough and headed back to Asia Minor. (He was probably worried that
the Ionians may revolt again; see the earlier section ‘Taking charge with
Cyrus’.) Xerxes left the army under the control of his son-in-law Mardonios,
who led the army south in the spring of 479 BC.

This battle really was the endgame – the Greeks faced the Persians on land in
open battle. All or nothing.
The Athenians evacuated their city once more, and the Persians sacked it
again. However, this second attack convinced the Spartans to finally commit
to the fight (since Thermopylae their support had been in doubt). In com-
mand of the joint force was a young Spartan named Pausanias who was
acting as regent for the young son of Leonidas (Leonidas was killed at
Thermopylae). Pausanias led the army north into the lands around the town
of Plataea. 
The Persian recruitment drive
Although the Spartans had joined up again, many other Greek states refused
to rally to the Athenian cause. As the Persians moved south, they were joined
by contingents from Thebes, Thessaly, Phocris, and Locris, amongst others.
None of the new recruits thought that the southern Greeks could possibly
win. They figured they should throw in their lot with the Persians because it
was odds on that the Persians would soon be their new overlords.
The battle of Plataea: A time for heroes
For a period of about two weeks, the Greeks manoeuvred around the country-
side, avoiding the attacks of the strong Persian cavalry. Pausanias grew very
frustrated and tried to work the Greek army into a position to attack. He
attempted to make the move at night, but the plan ended in total confusion.
As dawn broke the Greeks were halfway to their destination of Plataea.
Mardonios, the Persian commander, sensed that this was the Persians’
moment and he led an attack.
But Mardonios got it wrong. Although the Greeks had become a little split up,
their hoplite training (refer to Chapter 5) kicked in as soon as they saw the
Persians begin to attack. The Greeks assumed a defensive formation, which
limited the effectiveness of the Persian archers’ onslaught. 
When the two lines of infantry came together, the Persians – despite their
superior numbers – couldn’t cope with the heavily armed hoplites. Slowly
but surely the Greeks forced the Persians back. Mardonios was killed and
soon afterwards the Persians broke, fleeing the field. As the Persians fled, the
Spartans hunted and killed them by the thousands.
The Greeks scored an amazing victory against huge odds, but their success
was due more to luck than wise judgement. Pausanius certainly hadn’t
intended to take the Greeks into battle when they ending up fighting, but at
the end of the day it’s the result that counts. The Persians were defeated and
fled, and this time they didn’t come back.

The poet Simonides recorded the epitaphs that the Athenians wrote to their
dead. The following tells much about what the Greeks considered to be an
honourable death:
If dying nobly is the greatest part of valour, to us above all others Fortune
has granted this. For after striving to crown Greece with freedom, we lie here
enjoying praise that will never age.
Fighting the forgotten battle – Mykale 
What happened next often gets a little bit lost in history. Marathon,
Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea are always thought of as the biggest bat-
tles of the Persian Wars whereas it was actually at Mykale that the last act
was played out.
As what remained of the Persian fleet made its way home across the
Mediterranean the Greeks followed in hot pursuit and they quickly caught up.
After what had happened at Salamis (see the preceding section ‘Seeking
safety in Salamis’), the Persians weren’t keen to fight at sea, so they beached
their fleet at the promontory of Mykale opposite the island of Samos, where
they were joined by some Persian forces that had stayed behind in Asia
Minor.
The Greeks, commanded by the other Spartan king Leotykhidas (each year
Sparta had two kings), stormed the beach and burned the Persian fleet. As
the Persians desperately tried to defend themselves, the Ionians who were
part of Persian army swapped sides and helped the Greeks. 
After Mykale, the Persian defeat was total, and the Persian Wars were at 
an end.
Heralding the Real Winner: Athens
The Persian Wars were huge historical events that impacted the course of
western civilisation. Imagine how different things would’ve been if the
Persians had won. Nearly everything else in the following chapters of this
book would never have happened. The Olympic Games wouldn’t be in
London in 2012, and people wouldn’t be arguing about whether the
Parthenon sculptures in the British Museum (the so-called ‘Elgin Marbles’)
should be returned to Greece. Who knows how the arts, government, and 
science – to name but a few critical areas – may have evolved without the
Greeks’ victory. History would’ve been very different.

Although victory in the Persian Wars benefited all of Greece, one city-state
emerged particularly strong. Yes, the Spartans fought heroically to defend
Greece, but the historian Herodotus gives credit for defeating the Persians to
Athens:
And so anyone who said the Athenians were the saviours of Greece would
be perfectly correct . . . they chose that Greece remain free and they roused
all of Greece that hadn’t medised [become a Persian ally] and played the
main part, after the gods, in driving off the King.
Athens’ new fleet was without equal anywhere in the Greek world and its role
at the head of the resistance made the Athenians very influential in all politi-
cal and economic decisions to come. Athens’ position ushered in a new era of
empire building.

Athens and Empire Building
In This Chapter
 Forming and manipulating the Delian League
 Creating a new Athenian empire
 Appreciating Athenian democracy
 Doling out Athenian justice
A
fter years of warring with the Persians, the Greeks emerged victorious
(see Chapter 6) – and Athens played a massive part in the success. In
the years following the end of fighting with Persia, Athens built on its suc-
cesses to become the dominant Greek state in the Mediterranean with a
domain comprising other cities, towns, and islands. In this chapter, I explain
how the Athenians created one of history’s greatest empires.
Establishing the Delian League: 
Athens Comes Out on Top
Although the Greeks defeated the Persians in 480–479 BC, the threat of the
Persians returning to fight again was never likely to go away. All the Greek
cities realised this danger, and after the celebrations of their great victories
were over the big question facing the victorious Greeks was ‘What do we do
now?’
The Greek naval fleet continued to range around the eastern Mediterranean.
In 478 BC Pausanias, the Spartan commander from Plataea, took the war to
Persian-held Greek territories. First he sailed to Cyprus and managed to take
control of the island. He then sailed up the Bosphorus to Byzantium (close to
the site of modern-day Istanbul in Turkey) and managed to drive out the
Persian garrison. Sadly, at this point Pausanius seemed to have lost the plot
and was recalled to Sparta for attempting to install himself as a tyrant in
Byzantium. If you want to know what happened to the power-hungry
Pausanius, look at Chapter 26.

Let’s stick together
Pausanius’s naughty behaviour had a big effect. Despite the Spartan’s mili-
tary greatness (see Chapter 5), the rest of Greece began to suspect that they
were not the best candidates to lead the long-term resistance against Persia.
The Athenians, with their large fleet that had done so well in the recent war
with Persia, seemed a much better alternative.
In the winter of 478–77 BC, ambassadors from many Greek towns and islands
held a big meeting on the island of Delos. An Athenian general called
Aristeides came up with the idea of a league of Greek states that worked
together to protect the Greek world from the Persians – and also to finan-
cially compensate the states for damages that the Persian king had inflicted. 
To prove their allegiance to this new enterprise, Aristeides proposed all the
league members be required to pay an annual tribute of either money or
ships to the Delian League treasury. (Aristeides himself decided how much
members had to give.) Of course, the general also proposed that the
Athenians supervise the entire endeavour and take on the job of treasurer,
collecting and holding the cash for this new enterprise.
Essentially all the states (including Athens) were contributing for the
common good because the collected resources were to be used to defend
any of the member states against attack. Athens, however, was in a very
strong position – having control of the entire operation made the city very
powerful.
Adding another brick in the wall:
Themistocles’s return
Themistocles, the man who played a massive part in the battle of Salamis and
persuaded the Athenians to abandon the city (refer to Chapter 6), made an
even bigger contribution to Greek politics following the Persian Wars. 
While the Delian League was being set up, Themistocles prompted the
Athenians to begin rebuilding the walls of their city. In order to imagine the
size of this undertaking, take a look at the plan in Figure 7-1. We don’t know
how high or thick these walls were but they were about four miles in length.
Some parts are still preserved and if you go to the Naval Museum in Athens
you can see a section of them.
Figure 7-1 shows Athens around 450 BC. By this point the walls of Themistocles
had been joined to the ‘Long Walls’ that connected Athens with its port
Piraeus. This meant that the city was completely encircled by defensive walls.

Athens’s protective walls had been destroyed during two Persian sackings
(being vandalised and looted by invaders) carried out over the preceding 
25 years. The move to rebuild the walls was very controversial at the time.
The Spartans (who else?) protested against Themistocles’s plan, claiming
that it went against the spirit of the accord that brought many Greek states
together to defeat Persia. Surely, the Spartans suggested, destroying the
Athenian walls was a more appropriate symbol now that all Greek states
trusted each other.
More likely, the Spartans were concerned about Athens’s growing power and
knew that large walls would make the city more difficult to defeat in open
warfare because it would be more able to withstand a siege. In any case, the
Athenians ignored the Spartan’s protests and carried on with the building
project!
Getting together the necessary amount of stone and materials was a huge
task. The historian Thucydides describes the extent that some Greeks had to
go to:
Meanwhile the entire population of the city should build the wall, sparing
neither private nor public buildings which might be of some use in the work,
but demolishing everything . . . 
The project took 20 years to complete. By 450 BC, walls encircled the whole
city of Athens as well as the large port of Piraeus. The Athenians then went
on to build ‘the Long Walls’, that linked the port and the city. No other Greek
state boasted defences like this.

Athenian construction went even further, spending money on the buildings
within the city. During this period the Athenians constructed the Parthenon
on the Acropolis and many other buildings (see Chapter 18 for more on
ancient Greek building techniques), which attracted huge numbers of artists
and poets (see Chapter 17).
Expanding its Influence: The Delian
League Goes into Action
Of course the Delian League wasn’t just a defensive measure. Despite the fact
that the league had been created to help the Greeks defend themselves
against foreign threats, fairly soon after it was founded, the Greeks started to
aggressively attack the Persians. The league seemed to follow the idea that
attack is the best form of defence. From around 477 BC onwards the states
involved in the Delian League began to launch attacks on Persian-held 
territories.
Representing the Delian League – 
or the Athenian empire?
Kimon was the man who led the new attack on Persia. He was the son of 
the famous general Miltiades, who had been one of the heroes of Marathon
(see Chapter 5). Kimon had two significant early successes: 
 In 476 BC, he captured the port of Eion, which was the last surviving
Persian port on the borders of Thrace.
 In 475 BC he took control of the island of Skyros.
86
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Thanks a lot, now push off!
You may think that a hero like Themistocles was
guaranteed a life of fame in Athens after initiat-
ing the city’s massive wall rebuilding project. 
No chance. Like many others, he fell foul of 
the chaotic political scene in Athens. Not long
after the walls were finished, Themistocles’s
political opponents ostracised him from the 
city. He ended up in the town of Argos but 
was driven out of there when the Spartans
accused him of intrigue. Themistocles finished
up living at the court of the Persian king
Artaxerxes, an odd place for a Greek hero to
end up! He had dreamed of Athens gaining 
a whole Mediterranean empire – ironically 
that was exactly what they did after his death in
459 BC.

Although Kimon’s victories were all well and good, other members of the
Delian League began to question whether he had won the new territories in
the name of the Delian League or the city of Athens. The answer soon became
clear. 
The island of Skyros wasn’t even a Persian territory, but the Athenians
claimed to have captured it for strategic reasons. Just to back their argument
up even more, the Athenians enacted an impressive piece of spin-doctoring.
Soon after Skyros was captured the Athenians discovered the skeleton of a
very large man, and claimed they’d discovered the tomb of the hero Theseus
(refer to Chapters 2 and 3). And because Theseus was an Athenian, Skyros
must therefore be Athenian territory. Hmmm. This only served to increase
the cynicism of the other members of the league.
Extracting protection money
The Athenians asserted their interests within the Delian League to an even
greater extent over the next few years. In 470 BC Kimon used the fleet (tech-
nically the Delian League fleet) to force the Euboian city of Karystos to join
the league. The city was no threat to Greece, but after the Athenians forced
Karystos into the league, it had to pay dues (see the preceding section, ‘Let’s
stick together’).
87
Chapter 7: Athens and Empire Building
Holding out for a hero: Enter Pericles
By 470 BC, Athens was experiencing its ‘Golden
Age’. A combination of military success, finan-
cial security, and immense creativity in the arts
turned this small market town in Attica into the
absolute centre of the ancient world. (You can
read a lot more about the achievements of
Athens as well as the everyday lives of its
people in Parts III and IV of this book.)
Central to a great deal of what was happening
in Athens was a dominant new player on the
political scene. His name was Pericles, and he
made huge changes to the way that Athens
looked and acted. 
In many ways Pericles was a traditional aristo-
crat. His family was descended from the
Alkmaionids, who were among the oldest and
most influential aristocrats in the city (see
Chapter 4). Despite this upper class back-
ground, Pericles was always very closely asso-
ciated with democratic reform in Athens. 
(I mention several of these reforms in the later
sections ‘Navigating Athenian Democracy’ and
‘Examining the Athenian Legal System’.) And as
a patron of the arts, Pericles was dedicated to
turning Athens into the greatest of all Greek
cities and (at the time) he arguably succeeded
in doing so. It didn’t last, however.

Pestering the Persians 
Kimon went even further in the following decade. He took the fight to Asia
Minor and beyond. In 459 BC, the Egyptians revolted against Persian rule, and
Kimon took 200 ships from the Delian League to the Nile Delta. The Delian
League stayed in the region for five years, supporting the Egyptians’ attempt
to revolt. 
What had started as a means of protecting mainland Greece from Persia had
turned into something quite different. The military and naval strength that
had been assembled to protect Greece from external attack was now acting
as a kind of international policeman in foreign wars and engaging in unpro-
voked attacks on Persian territory. None of this was defensive and the great-
est beneficiaries were the Athenians. The arrival of a new leader in Athens
took things further still.
Transforming the league into an empire
Around the time that Pericles rose to prominence in Athens, the nature of the
Delian League changed forever. The key event happened on the small island
of Naxos in 470 BC.
Despite the continuing threat of Persian attacks, Naxos decided that it
wanted to withdraw from the league. The Athenians responded by sending
the fleet to attack the island and then destroy the walls of its main city. The
Athenians also forced Naxos to continue paying its taxes – only this time
Naxos had to pay directly to support the upkeep of the Athenian fleet. 
The league was increasingly functioning more like an empire (with Athens as
enforcer) rather than a mutually supportive organisation. Compared to the
Athenians, the Persians weren’t really that much of a threat to the people of
Naxos! (A similar bit of political and military intimidation happened to the
island of Thasos in 463 BC.)
Taking all: Athens in control
The Athenians effectively put the seal on the deal in 454 BC, establishing
themselves as the leaders of an empire. During that year the Athenians
moved the league’s treasury from the island of Delos to the Acropolis of
Athens. Not only did the leadership in Athens hold on to the money, but they
also insisted on taking a percentage each year as a tribute to the goddess
Athene (the patron deity of Athens) under whose care the money now rested. 
88

This shift was a clear sign that Athens now considered itself the head of an
empire rather than the chair of a league. The following section looks at how
Athens managed to ascend to its dominant position.
Navigating Athenian Democracy
Many ancient Athenians probably considered the city’s well-developed
system of government to be the main reason it had become so dominant in
the Greek world and Delian League by 470 BC. In Chapter 3, I examine how
Athens’s aristocratic system and tyrannies finally gave way to democracy.
This section covers how the system actually worked. 
Democracies exist throughout the world today, but they’re very different
from democracy in ancient Athens. Most countries today rely on some form
of representative democracy, in which people vote for somebody (usually
from a political party) to represent them in a parliament (or other governing
body) and hopefully to vote in accordance with how people feel on issues. 
By contrast, ancient Athenian democracy was a participative democracy.
Although the system included elected officials, government was carried out
directly by the people, who voted on all major issues such as whether to go
to war, build walls around the city, or start new religious festivals.
Getting organised
Athenian democracy ran via two main bodies:
 The ekklesia, or general assembly, which was the main body open to all
male citizens over the age of 18. 
 The boule, or Council of 500, which had a subcommittee known as the
prutaneis to deal with emergency situations.
In addition to these two, the highest body in ancient Athens was the
Aereopagus Council. This was a throwback to the old days of aristocratic rule
in Athens (refer to Chapter 4), but as I explain in the later section ‘Meeting
the VIPs: Very important politicians’, this group was due for a shake-up! 
The following sections examine these bodies in much closer detail.
The Acropolis and its temples are very famous, and many think of the site 
as a symbol of Greek democracy. But the Acropolis wasn’t actually the home
of Athenian politics – this was based in various sites around the agora. 
Figure 7-2 shows the actual political areas in the Athenian public square, 
or agora.

Participating in the ekklesia 
The ekklesia, or general assembly, was the main democratic body in Athens.
Its job was to make major decisions and pass laws. If a male citizen registered
in his deme (local area), he was entitled to attend the meetings of the
ekklesia. It might seem as if this would make the meetings unmanageable but
the Athenian population in 450 BC was around 250,000. Of this only around
30,000 were eligible male citizens (the rest were women, children, slaves, and
resident foreigners called ‘metics’). Of these 30,000 probably an average of
around 5,000 would attend ekklesia meetings. That’s a lot but still only about
two per cent of the population! 
Meeting and voting
The ekklesia met regularly, four times a month on the big hill called the Pynx,
which was located to the south-west of the city (see Figure 7-2).
Meetings were usually held early in the morning because agendas were
lengthy and could take most of the day. Standing items on the agenda were
defence, the election of officials, and the grain supply.
After this business was out of the way, the floor was opened by the chairman
of the ekklesia, who was also the chairman of the prutaneis (see the sidebar
‘Acting presidential: The prutaneis’). Theoretically, anybody could speak at
the ekklesia, but matters to be voted on had to be cleared by the elected
boule first (see the later section ‘Joining the boule’).

Votes were usually taken by a show of hands unless it was particularly close,
in which case a secret ballot took place. It was a lengthy process where
people dropped a stone of a different colour into a jar depending on whether
they were for or against. The jars were emptied and the votes counted. The
pebble and jar method was also sometimes used to decide sensitive issues
such military policy and commands.
Speaking up, speaking out
Of course, some people in the ekklesia spoke more than others. Those people
who responded most often became known as rhetores, which is where the
words orator and rhetoric come from. Wordy modern politicians owe their
name to this group of old windbags. Quite appropriate really!
The rhetores were regularly in attendance and became very good at speaking
and quite influential. Although the rhetores didn’t hold an official position,
other attendees at the ekklesia looked to them to speak. Often a rhetor would
represent a group of like-minded people, thus forming the closest thing that
ancient Athens had to a political party.
Packing ‘em in
So, if every male citizen over the age of 18 was eligible to attend the ekklesia
surely every meeting was packed? Well, probably not, actually. 
At the time of Pericles (circa 450 BC), estimates suggest that the citizen popu-
lation in Athens was probably about 30,000. Clearly not everyone could
attend the same meeting and have his say! Historians estimate that only
about 6,000 people could attend a meeting of the ekklesia at any one time.
Citizens were unable to attend for many reasons:
 Citizens (who were mostly self-employed) lost a day’s work by coming to
meetings. By 400 BC, when the city was suffering after the
Peloponnesian War (see Chapter 8), the Athenians instituted a system of
attendance pay – citizens received 1 obol to compensate for lost earn-
ings. For many citizens this was a mere gratuity.
 Many citizens lived all over Attica; the trip into Athens was time-
consuming for these individuals. 
In the middle of the fifth century, the Athenians introduced a new attendance
system in which the Scythian police force (described in Chapter 15) dragged
a long, red rope across the agora (public square) on the mornings when the
ekklesia was meeting. People touched by the rope would already be late for
the meeting on the Pnyx and that would show when they arrived with a big
red stain on their clothes. They would then be fined for late attendance!
91
Chapter 7: Athens and Empire Building

In his play Acharnians the Greek comic playwright Aristophanes (see Chap-
ter 16) gives an interesting description of a day at the ekklesia:
At dawn, and the Pynx here is deserted – people are sitting in the agora and
here and there avoiding the vermilion rope. Even the prutaneis haven’t
come, but they’ll arrive late and then jostle as you might expect to try and
get on the front bench.
Despite Aristophanes’s sarcasm, the Athenians loved democracy and
shouted it from the rooftops. Although not every meeting of the ekklesia had
maximum attendance, politics and the daily life of the city was on people’s
lips all the time in a way that may feel quite unusual to people today.
Joining the boule 
The boule, or Council of 500, complemented the ekklesia as the other major
element of Athenian democracy. Basically the boule was an administrative
group that set the agenda for the ekklesia, where the main business was
done. Subsequently, it was the responsibility of the boule to carry out the
laws and administration that the ekklesia had decided on. The boule met in
the large building to the west of the agora called the bouleuterion.
Like the ekklesia, the boule was an amateur group made up of citizens who
gave their time for no financial reward. The 500 individuals who made up the
boule had to be Athenian citizens over the age of 30. They served on the
boule for a year at a time and couldn’t serve more than twice in their lifetime.
Additionally, the 500 citizens were selected in a very specific way: Every year
50 men were elected from each of the ten tribes of Athens. This system meant
that all areas of Attica were equally represented in the process. 
92
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Acting presidential: The prutaneis
The boule contained a special group known as
the prutaneis, or presidents. This was an emer-
gency committee that dealt with crises as and
when they emerged. Serving as a president was
a full-time job; citizens lived at state expense on
24-hour call in a building called the tholos (see
Figure 7-2). The first duty for the prutaneis if a
crisis happened was to summon a meeting of
the boule. The prutaneis was a coveted position
and usually only held once in a lifetime. A can-
didate would have to be wealthy because he
needed to ensure others carried out his busi-
ness or worked his farm while he served. Like
other aspects of Athenian democracy, the 
prutaneis appeared to be open to all but time
and money pressures meant that only the
wealthy could really afford to do it.

In a sense, members of the boule were like a kind of civil service that adminis-
tered all areas of the state. Huge numbers of people were voted in as officials
on an annual basis to enforce the policies of the ekklesia. At points during the
fifth century BC around 700 people served as registered officials although the
vast majority of these posts weren’t full-time and could be worked alongside
the post-holder’s own business.
The following are some of the more important positions:
 The Nine: These nine individuals (surprise) were the most senior offi-
cials. The most prominent of the Nine gave his name to the calendar
year. The rest of the group dealt with public festivals, religious matters,
and justice.
 The Eleven: Below the Nine in prominence, these eleven officials were
responsible for the jury-courts and maintaining punishments and the
prison (see the section ‘Examining the Athenian Legal System’ for more
on Athenian legal matters).
Many other officials tackled other areas of civilian life. For example, some
officials were elected to engage in foreign policy and foreign relations, includ-
ing envoys (presbeis) and heralds (kerux), who were state-appointed.
Meeting the VIPs: Very 
important politicians
Despite the full democracy at work in Athens some citizens were more impor-
tant than others. In many ways, the true leaders of the Athenian people were
the Aereopagus Council, nine arkhons who were elected on an annual basis.
The council was so called because it met in the space known as ‘the crag of
Ares’ between the hill of the Acropolis and the Pynx. Although they met on
their own these arkhons also attended all meetings of the boule and ekklesia.
Solon (described in Chapter 4) decided in 594 BC that only two people from
the top two property classes were eligible to ever become arkhons. Dating
back to the early days of Athens, any former arkhons had automatically
become part of the Aereopagus Council. Originally, the council had adminis-
tered most of the business of the city, but gradually the ekklesia and the
boule took on most of these responsibilities. The Aereopagus became a court
to deal with serious criminal offences.
The arkhons and strategoi (elected generals) were the most dominant people
in Athens. They were very influential in the ekklesia, but their influence
wasn’t because people feared their power. Rather, the prominence of these
people came from their being excellent speakers who knew how to work an
audience and convince people to vote for their ideas.

One of the most notable VIPs was Pericles (see the earlier sidebar ‘Holding
out for a hero: Enter Pericles’). He was involved in changes that reduced the
powers of the Aereopagus Council, but he also made significant changes to
the other great boast of ancient Athens – the jury system.
Examining the Athenian Legal System
The legal system in ancient Athens was very complicated. I could write entire
chapters – indeed books – about Athenian justice. In this section, I just give a
brief guide and overview of what took place in the court of law.
The main principle of the Athenian legal system was trial by jury. The
Athenians believed that, like politics, every citizen should contribute to the
system of justice – and jury trials were the easiest way of doing this. Other
Greek cities either decided on issues by the power of the monarch or ruling
council or allowed individuals the opportunity to enact vengeance them-
selves. Athens was doing something really quite different.
Meeting the legal players
The thesmothetai – six arkhons who were part of the Eleven (see the section
‘Identifying special roles and posts’) – were responsible for administering 
justice, which meant staffing and running the jury-courts and ensuring 
that justice took place. 
The jury-courts were known as the eliaia and were staffed by between 201
and 2,501 jurors, which the thesmothetai would decide upon depending on
the case’s significance. Immense care was taken over the selection of the jury
to try and ensure that people with close relationships to those involved were
not selected, but this was always difficult in such a small community.
The Athenians held a register of 6,000 citizens who were eligible for jury ser-
vice. Pericles eventually introduced the system of payment for jurors, arguing
that jury duty was as important as attending the ekklesia and so participants
should be paid. The going rate was two obols a day (twice the rate of a day at
the ekklesia). The number of cases going on meant that a juror was likely to
be busy for many days of the year.

Prosecuting cases
Athens’s legal system was different from modern, Western systems in that all
prosecutions were brought by private citizens. The state didn’t prosecute
anybody. So, for example, if somebody broke into your house and stole your
property, even if they were caught in the act, you would be responsible for
taking them to court. Even crimes against the state, such as treason, were
prosecuted by private individuals. When Socrates was put on trial in 399 BC
for ‘corrupting the youth of Athens’ (Chapter 9 has the details) the charge
was made by several private citizens, not the state.
Similarly, the Athenian system didn’t have any lawyers, as you know them
nowadays. Citizens represented themselves in court, although they some-
times got more eloquent speakers to write speeches for them – for a fee, of
course!
Everything took place in front of the jury of citizens (no private discussions
with a judge or meetings between lawyers). Also, trials had to be over in one
day. In a sense this time limit made for a much less complicated process –
although you can argue that the jury was merely swayed by clever speaking. 
Determining the fitness of a witness
Given the short duration of all Athenian court cases, good witnesses were
vital. In the Athenian court, witnesses merely gave their evidence; no cross-
examination was allowed. The selection and use of witnesses in court was the
main legal strategy employed by prosecuting citizens. 
Only citizens were allowed to give evidence. This regulation meant that
women and metoikoi (resident foreigners) weren’t allowed to serve as wit-
nesses. However, they could make a statement to a representative of the
eliaia that a male citizen then read aloud. 
Trial evidence provided by slaves was particularly controversial in the
Athenian courts and was admissible only if the slave had been tortured first.
This grizzly task was carried out by the Scythian archers who served as the
Athenian police force and supervised by an eliaia official. (Indeed, the lives
of these unfortunate people were in stark contrast to the experiences of citi-
zens in highly democratic Athens; for more on slavery see Chapter 14.)

Trying a case
At a preliminary hearing in the Athenian courts both parties stated their
case. An attempt would be made to settle the issue at this point as the
appointed arkhon would encourage both sides to negotiate. If that failed then
any physical evidence was boxed up and handed to the arkhon, and he would
set a date for the trial which could be several weeks or even months in the
future.
At the trial a water-clock timed the proceedings so that neither side was
allowed to dominate and both had sufficient time to make their case. Both
sides presented their evidence and then the jury voted. If the jury decided on
a guilty verdict then they took another vote about the form of punishment.
Very often the prosecution suggested its own punishment during a case.
More often than not, the jury’s punishment was a fine. The three heaviest
penalties were death, exile (being expelled from the city either indefinitely or
for a set period of time during which citizen rights would be lost), or atimia.
Atimia involved stripping away the rights of Athenian citizenship. Although
people could continue to live in Athens, they could no longer participate in
any official functions. The Athenians often referred to atimia as a state of
‘living death’. The presiding arkhon was responsible for ensuring that the
punishments were carried out and would attend and supervise executions.

In This Chapter

 Surviving the plague in Athens
 Engaging in siege warfare
Thucydides the Athenian wrote the history of the war between Athens and
Sparta . . . in the belief that it was going to be a great war and more worth
writing about than any of those that had taken place in the past.
–Thucydides, The History of the Peloponnesian War
T
he Peloponnesian War lasted for more than 30 years. When it started in
431 BC, Athens and Sparta were pretty much unchallenged as the two
dominant city-states in the whole of Greece. Athens had its international
empire and dominant fleet, and Sparta had control of large sections of main-
land Greece and its famous army. 
By the end of the war, both sides were in a position from which they never
really recovered. Essentially, their time had passed. The Peloponnesian War
brought one era of ancient Greece to an end, and this chapter examines how.
Engaging in the First Cold War
A clash between Athens and Sparta was always likely. Ever since the final
defeat of the Persians in 478 BC, the various Greek states had struggled for
supremacy. Of all the states Athens and Sparta were the best placed to grab
power. The states were rivals for several reasons:
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

 Historically, the Spartans were the military leaders of the Greeks, and
the Athenians were the founding force behind the Delian League (see
Chapter 7) and used this political entity to build an empire.
 Politically, Athens was a participative democracy (see Chapter 7), but
Sparta was ruled by a dominant aristocracy and had two kings and a
group of ephors (supervisors) that ran the state (see Chapter 4). 
 Culturally, Athens had developed into the artistic capital of the Greek
world, and Sparta was an austere, war-like civilisation that held fast to
its strict and disciplined rules.
Athens and Sparta had a lot of differences but what they had in common was
an aggressive foreign policy towards the other Greek towns and cities and
they gained control over more and more of them when they could.
Like the US and USSR in the 20th century, Athens and Sparta had become too
big to not be rivals. And just like the Cold War in the last century, any con-
frontation between the rivals had the potential to be brutal, final, and come
at a massive human cost.
Sparta in the doldrums
The Athenians had done very nicely out of the Persian Wars – establishing
the Delian League and creating a vast empire – but the years that followed
478 BC weren’t as kind to Sparta. 
The Spartans were the big players in what was known as the Peloponnesian
League. This loose group of cities including Corinth and Elis banded together
to face the Persian threat in the 480s BC. After Persia was defeated in 478 BC
the league drifted apart, and the Spartans weren’t able to call on league mem-
bers for support in the way that the Athenians did with the Delian League.
In many ways 464 BC was Sparta’s annus horribilis (awful year). During this
year Sparta suffered a tremendous earthquake, resulting in massive damage
to the town and the death of many people. Following the earthquake, the
long-suffering helot population (see Chapter 4) took its chance to revolt. The
Spartans managed to recover and pin down the revolting helots on Mount
Ithome where they’d built a fortified encampment that eventually became a
town. This was a huge problem for the Spartans because the helot population
was massive – at least five times the number of Spartan citizens.
At this point the Spartans appealed to their fellow Greek towns – including
Athens – for help to launch a final attack on the helot camp.

Decision time in Athens
The dominant political figure in Athens in the fifth century BC was Pericles
(see Chapter 7). He encouraged policies that saw the Athenians expand their
empire and turn the city into a cultural centre. But Pericles wasn’t a king 
and there were other speakers in the ekklesia, or general assembly, who 
disagreed with his reforms. (Chapter 7 has more info on ekklesia.) One of
these was a man called Kimon.
Kimon was pro-Spartan in outlook, meaning that he felt the Greek states
should work together for their own mutual interests. He believed that the
Persians were still the biggest threat to all Greece and that the Athenians
should seek to form an alliance with the Spartans that protected both cities
from foreign, non-Greek threats like the Persians without coming into conflict
with each other. 
When the call for help came from Sparta in 464 BC, Kimon managed to per-
suade the Athenian ekklesia to vote him commander of an expeditionary
force that would go and help Sparta. Kimon was hugely pleased with his new
role, but his actions unwittingly kicked off the chain of events that started the
brutal Peloponnesian War.
Things didn’t turn out as Kimon expected. Although he was pro-Sparta many
of his troops were Athenian democrats. When they arrived at Mount Ithome
they upset the Spartans by expressing sympathy for the helots and their
plight. The Spartans grew suspicious and sent the Athenians back home,
saying that they were no longer needed. After all the debating, the Athenians
never even lifted a sword in anger!
This incident at Mount Ithome was fatal to the relationship between Athens
and Sparta and the divide between them became permanent. A few years
later in 460 BC, the Athenians signed a treaty with the town of Argos, a sworn
enemy of Sparta.
99
Chapter 8: Dealing with the Neighbours from Hell: The Peloponnesian War
Kimon: A big fan of Sparta
Kimon was such a fan of Sparta and its consti-
tution that he named his son Lakedaimonios,
which literally means ‘of Sparta’ or ‘Spartan’.
Being sent back to Athens was a tremendous
blow to him because he’d worked so hard for
the campaign to be approved. He suffered the
consequences on his return being ostracised
(sent into exile) for ten years. Kimon tried
(unsuccessfully) to return two years later but
was eventually recalled in 451 BC when the
Athenians needed his experience to help them
negotiate a peace treaty with Sparta, and he
resumed his leading role in the political life of
the city.

Enduring the first Peloponnesian 
War (460–446 BC)
By signing the treaty with Argos the Athenians officially became the enemies
of Sparta. Over the next 15 years a war of sorts took place. Athens and Sparta
attacked each other’s allies on mainland Greece and close by. The war
involved a lot of manoeuvring for position and short-term captures of 
territory. 
Neither side managed to gain the upper hand, and victory was usually
quickly followed by defeat. After early victories for Athens, the initiative grad-
ually slipped away, with Sparta’s allies the Boiotians and the island of Euboia
revolting against Athens. In 446 BC, Pericles and the Athenian army were 
perilously cut off in Euboia when the Spartan king Pleistoanax had a chance
to attack Athens itself. Pleistoanax didn’t attack, and the war petered out.
Pericles began negotiations, and eventually both sides signed a treaty declar-
ing 30 years of peace. Unfortunately, the Thirty Years Truce, as it was known,
was never likely to hold for that long. Fewer than half the 30 years elapsed
before the beginnings of the Second Peloponnesian War.
Fighting the Main Event: The 
Second Peloponnesian War
Greek historian Thucydides was clear on the causes of the second, bloodier
Peloponnesian War:
War began when the Athenians and Peloponnesians broke the Thirty Years
Truce . . . What made the war inevitable was the growth in Athenian power
and the fear that this caused in Sparta.

Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Thucydides: News from the frontline
Historians are very well informed about the
Second Peloponnesian War, partly because of
the work of the Greek historian Thucydides.
Thucydides was born around 460 BC and lived
through nearly the whole war and actually
served as a commander for the Athenians. 
He was a relative of Kimon (see the sidebar
‘Kimon: A big fan of Sparta’) and a supporter of
Pericles. Thucydides’s book The History of the
Peloponnesian War is the first real work of his-
tory ever written and it’s written by somebody
who was actually there, fighting in a war that
took place 2,500 years ago. Amazing!
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Historians largely agree with Thucydides’s assessment; fear of Athenian
power had been partly responsible for the First Peloponnesian War (see the
preceding section ‘Enduring the First Peloponnesian War’.) 
However, the incident that prompted the breaking of the Thirty Years Truce
was a bit more interesting and took place on the island of Kerkyra.
Initiating a crisis in Kerkyra
Kerkyra was a colony of the city of Corinth. In 435 BC, the Kerkyrans revolted
against Corinth, and a war raged for two years. In 433 BC, the Kerkyrans
asked Athens for help, and the Athenians, sensing an opportunity, said yes
and immediately became an enemy of Corinth.
Corinth was a member of the Peloponnesian League (see the section ‘Sparta
in the doldrums’), and when the Athenians clashed with them again over the
small city of Poteidaia in northern Greece in 432 BC, Corinth complained to
the Spartans about Athenian aggression. Surely, the Corinthians argued, the
Peloponnesian League would defend its members’ interests?
The problem was that the Athenians hadn’t actually broken the peace treaty
they signed with Sparta because they hadn’t done anything against the
Spartans’ interests, so the Spartans would be the ones breaking the agree-
ment if they took any action against Athens. During the winter of 432–31 BC,
the Spartans spent days debating whether to move against Athens. One of
their kings called Arkhidamos argued long and hard that the Spartans should
hold back from confrontation, but the momentum was already behind war. 
Really the start of the war had nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of
the Athens and Corinth situation. As Thucydides wrote, the Spartans feared
Athens’s growing power.
Actually, in the end, neither Athens or Sparta officially started the
Peloponnesian War – rather it was the city of Thebes, another influential and
aggressive Greek state who were at the time allied with Sparta. Ironic really,
because the Thebans ended up doing rather well following the war (see
Chapter 9). 
In the spring of 431 BC, a group of Thebans managed to take hold of the town
of Plataia. The Plataians were allies of Athens and had refused to go over to
the Spartan-dominated Boiotian League, a small group of towns allied with
Sparta in the east of Greece. The Thebans’ actions were a direct attack on
Athenian territory and broke the peace treaty. The Plataians managed to kick
out the Theban force, but it was no good. The war had started.

This early stage of the Second Peloponnesian War (the first ten years, 431–
421 BC) is often known as the Arkhidamian War. Rather unfair given that
Arkhidamos was a leading Spartan general who argued against fighting in the
first place. After the war began though, Arkhidamos had to lead the Spartan
troops.
Figuring out how to fight
Athens and Sparta fighting each other presented difficulties. In addition to
the contrasts I describe in the earlier section ‘Engaging in the First Cold War’,
the Spartans were the superior force on land, whereas Athens had a suppos-
edly undefeatable navy.
These differences made actually fighting each other very difficult because:
 Pericles proposed a strategy in which Athens avoided engaging the
Spartan army directly but used its fleet to harass and attack Sparta’s
allies, like the small towns in the Boiotian League. 
 Sparta spent a great deal of time invading Attica without ever going as
far as to lay siege to Athens. 
The Spartan attacks in Attica were very harmful. The Spartans would attack
and kill farmers and their livestock and destroy any crops. This had two big
effects: First, food became scarce, and second, all the homeless people from
the countryside (with the encouragement of Pericles) came to Athens. 
Dealing with the plague
As the Spartan attacks continued in Attica and the area surrounding Athens,
people began to pour into Athens looking for shelter and safety. The effects
of this population increase soon took its toll. In 430 BC, a terrible disease
took hold in the city. Many people at the time blamed the illness on a ship
from the east, but the immense overcrowding and unpleasant conditions in
the city can’t have helped. 
Thucydides, who caught the plague but survived, gives an unpleasant first-
hand account:
The bodies of the dying were heaped one on top of the other, and half-dead
creatures could be seen staggering about in the streets or flocking around the
fountains in their desire for water. The temples in which they took up their
quarters were full of the dead bodies of people who had died inside them.
102
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Life in Athens must have been absolutely horrific. Around 30,000 people died
of the plague and its after-effects. The population in Attica didn’t really
recover for several generations. 
The Athenian people put all the blame on Pericles because it had been his
strategy to fight the war abroad and bring many people in Attica inside
Athens’s walls. He was suspended from his position as a strategos (general)
and fined. 
Then in 429 BC Pericles himself caught the plague and died. By this point the
Athenians had already reinstated him as a strategos (due to a lack of alterna-
tives). Death by plague was a sad end to the life of a great man – and
Pericles’s death left Athens facing a very uncertain future.
Responding to the Mytilenean revolt
The war pressed on regardless of Pericles’s passing. With Athens doing badly
some of her allies began to jump ship. In 428 BC, the town of Mytilene on the
island of Lesbos (see the Cheat Sheet map) revolted against Athens. 
The Athenian response was savage. First, an Athenian fleet was sent to block-
ade the island. After Mytilene surrendered, the Athenian ekklesia voted to
execute all the male citizens and sell the women and children into slavery. 
Athens had previously done everything possible to nurture its relationship
with its allies. So why the drastic change in dealing with Mytilene? Well, the
death of Pericles left a vacuum in the ekklesia, and it was filled by what
Athenian aristocrats referred to as the ‘new men’. These new men weren’t
descended from ancient aristocratic lines like Pericles, and they rose to posi-
tions of influence through their ability to rabble-rouse and speak impres-
sively in the ekkleisa (see Chapter 7). 
Chief among the new men were Kleon and Hyperbolos. Hyperbolos was so
famed for his speaking that the word ‘hyperbole’ derives from his name
which literally meant ‘throwing beyond’ (that is, exaggerating)! Both of these
new men frequently gave inflammatory speeches that encouraged Athenians
to take the harshest action. The response to Mytilene was a case in point.
Although Kleon had argued that Mytilene should be punished harshly, Athens
was uncomfortable with this judgement. The issue was debated again the fol-
lowing day, and a majority voted for a lighter punishment. A ship was dis-
patched to take the news and arrived at Mytilene just in time to stop the
massacre. Phew!

Athens’s new men are mercilessly mocked by the comic playwright
Aristophanes in his play Knights. Aristophanes had a particular hatred for
Kleon, whom he called ‘The Tanner’, mocking his background in the trade of
leather goods. In Wasps he went even further, naming characters ‘Procleon’
and ‘Anticleon’. Procleon is written as a total braggart but a real wimp when
it came to fighting:
‘Here, here, what’s coming over me? I’ve gone all limp, I can’t hold the
sword up any longer! All the fight’s gone out of me!’
Going international: A situation in Sicily 
The Peloponnesian War from 431 to 428BC was so far, so Greek. But after 427
BC, the effects of the war began to spread around the Mediterranean. Other
countries getting involved in fighting between Sparta and Athens may sound
weird, but think about the way that the Second World War ended up being
partly fought in North Africa, Japan, and the South Pacific as well as in
Europe itself.
Additionally, a long history of Greek influence affected the region. For exam-
ple, the Greeks had founded colonies in Sicily several hundred years prior to
the Peloponnesian War (see Chapter 3). The island’s many towns had close
relationships with the Greek cities from which they’d originated through
trade and population movement.
One Sicilian town was Leontinoi. In 427 BC, Leontinoi appealed to Athens for
help against the attacks by Syracuse, and the Athenians agreed to assist. You
would have thought that the Athenians had better things to do, what with the
Peloponnesian War going on and everything, but Athens had hidden motives
for wanting to help and got involved in another war that was entirely sepa-
rate from their campaign against Sparta.
Unlike Attica and much of the Peloponnese, Sicily was rich and fertile, pro-
ducing a huge amount of grain. In fact, a lot of the grain that the Greek cities
consumed was imported from Sicily. Athenians probably saw aiding Sicily 
as a chance to get to grips with the grain supply – either by taking it all for
themselves or stopping grain ships from reaching Sparta and its allies.
Perhaps the Sicilians worked out that Athens was likely to be a bigger threat
than a help. When the small Athenian fleet arrived in Sicily it was sent back
home again because Leontinoi and Syracuse had managed to settle the dis-
pute themselves. 
Nevertheless the Athenians kept an eye on Sicily and planned to return. 
(See the later section ‘Attempting – again! – to take Sicily’.)

Putting up a fight for Pylos
While the Athenians were messing around and interfering with Sicily, almost
by accident they struck a blow against Sparta. Incredibly, when a small group
of Athenian ships on their way to Sicily passed the harbour of Sparta’s ally
Pylos in south western Greece, they found it virtually undefended.
The orator Demosthenes was on ship with the Athenian generals because
he’d been sent to use his rhetorical skill in Sicily to negotiate terms for help
with Leontinoi. He argued that they should take advantage of the situation
and was dropped off and left behind with a small force to build a fort at the
edge of the bay. The Spartans panicked and sent their army to fight against
the Athenians. A land and naval battle ensued, and the Athenians won.
Athens established a base at the closest point to Sparta. Also, 420 Spartan
hoplites were left marooned on the nearby island of Sphacteria.
The immediate response of the Spartans was to negotiate peace – an offer
that the Athenians rejected out of hand. A bit of a mistake really, as the
Athenians were never able to really make the most of the advantage that they
had gained.
The reaction in Athens was hugely critical; the populace accused the gener-
als of not making the most of things. Chief among the critics was the dema-
gogue Kleon, who claimed that he could’ve done a better job. In a shock
move, one of the chief strategoi called Nikias said that Kleon should go and do
it then!
Annoyingly, Kleon was quite successful the following year. Taking the experi-
enced Demosthenes with him, Kleon and his men headed for Pylos and man-
aged to capture nearly 300 Spartan prisoners at the battle of Sphacteria, who
became a hugely useful bargaining tool for the rest of the war.
Swaying the north-east cities: Brasidas
Although the Athenians had an advantage through the capture of the Spartan
prisoners, Sparta had been pursuing another strategy that was proving quite
successful. In 424 BC some towns in north-east Greece that had previously
been loyal to Athens decided to revolt. With Athens’s resources stretched, it
must have seemed a good time to try.
Sparta sent a large force to north-east Greece under the command of a lead-
ing aristocrat called Brasidas. He went on the equivalent of a PR tour, winning
over many of these cities with his personal charm – combined with the pres-
ence of around 1,500 heavily armed hoplites.
105

Brasidas’s campaign was hugely dangerous to Athens because when cities
defected from the empire the Athenians lost both their revenues and the
opportunity to call on them for military support.
The Athenians set out to stop Brasidas, and the end result was a truce that
lasted for one year in 423 BC. Neither side could keep to the truce, however,
and in 422 BC, Kleon took a force to the north to attack Brasidas. At a big
battle outside the town of Amphipolis, the Athenians were heavily defeated
and both Kleon and Brasidas killed.
Brokering a precarious peace deal: Nikias 
After nearly ten years of conflict, both Sparta and Athens began to realise
that neither side was going to be able to win the war – every victory came at
too great a cost for the winning side to be able to take advantage.
Thus, in 421 BC, peace negotiations began, led by the Athenian strategos
Nikias. The two sides managed to agree to a 50-year peace and also the return
of the Spartan prisoners in exchange for Amphipolis. So that was all sorted
then, wasn’t it? Sadly, no. 
106
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Thucydides: Warfare’s loss is literature’s gain
Thucydides was one Athenian who was given
command during the action against Brasidas.
He was sent to defend the town of Amphipolis
and prevent it from going over to Sparta. 
He failed to keep the city under Athenian 
influence – more through bad luck than any-
thing else – and on his return to Athens he was
sent into exile for an indefinite period as pun-
ishment. He resolved to travel around Greece as
a result. 
At this point in his life, Thucydides began 
collecting material for The History of the
Peloponnesian War, which he spent the rest of
his life writing. The book wasn’t published until
after his death by which point those who had
expelled him from Athens had fallen from
power. It immediately became a standard work
of history that was much admired by other
Greeks for its detailed style and focus on accu-
racy rather than rumour. Just think, if he’d won
at Amphipolis, historians probably wouldn’t
know nearly as much about the war!

Although the peace of Nikias was an excellent deal for Athens and Sparta, it
enraged the other cities, including Boiotia and Corinth (see the section
‘Initiating a crisis in Kerkyra’) that had supported the Spartan side during the
years of fighting. As far as these Spartan-supporting states were concerned,
the peace deal offered nothing for them – all their grievances against Athens
were unresolved. 
With so much discontent the peace brokered by Nikias couldn’t last.
Complicating the mix: 
Argos and Alcibiades 
The cities that felt hard-done-by in the peace of Nikias deserted Sparta and
looked to make a deal with the ancient city of Argos. Argos hadn’t been
involved in the Peloponnesian War up until this point; the discontented cities
believed that an alliance with Argos was in their best interests. But deal-
making with Argos added a third potential power to the mix and made a 
complicated situation even worse. 
At the same time Athens was falling under a new and exciting influence in the
ekklesia – a man called Alcibiades. This young, charming, and apparently
immensely handsome aristocrat possessed a tremendous talent for swaying
popular opinion. (See Chapter 26 for more on this complicated fellow.) 
In 420 BC, Alcibiades managed to convince the ekklesia that Athens could
profit from what was happening with Argos. He argued that the cities were
flocking to join with Argos because Sparta was now their enemy. By logical
extension, these discontented states were now Athenian allies. Brilliant!
Alcibiades won the day, and Athens made an alliance with the cities of Argos,
Mantineia, and Elis. Although this technically didn’t break the peace of
Nikias, it certainly strained it.
Of course, confrontation soon happened. In 418 BC, the Spartan king Agis
attacked Argos, which the Spartans now saw as their main threat. This attack
meant that the allies of Argos had to come to the city’s defence – and those
allies now included Athens!
The result was a battle outside the town of Mantineia. The Spartans soundly
defeated a combined force of Argos and its allies. The victory was a massive
confidence boost to the Spartans, reinforcing their reputation for invincibility.

Engaging in siege warfare in Melos
After losing at Mantineia, Athens quickly fell back into the policy that Pericles
had proposed – attacking Spartan allies and adding them to its empire. In 
416 BC, Athens’s focus turned to the island of Melos, part of the Cyclades.
The siege wasn’t an arduous one, but when Melos finally broke, the Athenians
did to Melos what they had threatened to do to Mytilene years before: All 
the men were put to death and the women and children sold into slavery.
(See the earlier section ‘Responding to the Mytilenean revolt’.)
The Athenians’ actions sound absolutely barbaric today (and have unpleas-
ant echoes of the ‘ethnic-cleansing’ that took place during the last century).
No excuse can justify the barbarous destruction of an entire community, but
in the ancient world it wasn’t unusual for a siege to end like this. 
Laying siege: The waiting game
In Chapter 5, I talk about the infantry battles, cavalry, and naval warfare of
ancient Greeks. The other major form of military engagement during this time
was the siege. A lot of siege warfare occurred during the Peloponnesian War,
and Alexander the Great (see Chapters 10 and 11) was a devil for a siege. In
essence, a city that was being attacked had two choices: come out and fight,
or lock the gates and try to sit it out. Consequently sieges happened very
often.
Generally speaking, laying a siege was a long process. The attacking army
blockaded the enemy town and then essentially sat there and waited. The
siege came to an end either when the attackers managed to get in, or either
party gave up.
In any siege the attacking side needed to be confident that they were able to
starve out those inside the city. Thus, the attacker’s supply lines needed to
be excellent. They had to have enough troops to surround the city and pre-
vent supplies getting in. When laying siege to ports, this blockade activity,
known as circumvallation, was often done by using a fleet to intercept supply
ships and guard the harbour. 
Sieges were very time consuming and never guaranteed success. An attacker
could waste months on a siege that then had to end because the troops were
required elsewhere. The process was also grim, boring work for the attack-
ers, and armies often became ill-disciplined.
Developing new tactics
By the time of the Peloponnesian War, the Greeks had developed some new
tactics to go on the offensive. Following are five popular options:
108

 Mounds: This approach was quite simple really. The attackers con-
structed a very large earth mound with an underlying structure of
timber against a wall of the city. The timber ensured that the mound
wouldn’t be ground down by the thousands of feet pounding on it. The
attackers then used the mound as a ramp for mounting infantry charges,
bringing archers closer to their targets, and manoeuvring battering
rams. Walls could be 25–30 feet high so it was often easier to bash a hole
in them than climb over!
 Towers: The attackers built siege towers, which were large wooden con-
structions from which archers provided covering fire to troops attacking
the walls. The towers would normally be slightly higher than the walls
so that the archers could shoot down onto the defenders (although the
height would depend how much timber was available). Check out
Chapter 12 for the ultimate siege tower – Demetrius’s ‘Heliopolis’.
 Mines: For this tactic, the attackers literally dug under the other side’s
protective walls sometimes 10 or 15 feet deep. Digging mines was an
incredibly dangerous job because those doing it were liable to be
crushed by the mine collapsing or the walls themselves falling on them.
The defenders often poured water into the mines, flooding them and
drowning the attackers. 
 Battering rams: This tactic was mostly used in conjunction with mounds.
Teams of men continually charged a wall, striking it with a ram made of
wood, until the wall fell. Siege towers and archers often provided cover
for battering ram teams.
 Treachery: By far the simplest way for an attacker to gain victory was to
get a message to a traitor within the town who then opened the gates.
Often these traitorous actions were in return for money or simply the
promise that the traitor and their family would be spared when the town
was taken. Of course, often the promised safety or compensation didn’t
happen in the melee that followed.
Following a siege
After a siege broke and a town was in the possession of the enemy, what fol-
lowed was often terrible. The massacre of all prisoners became increasingly
common during the Peloponnesian War, as the war itself became more and
more brutal. These killings were often prompted by a shortage of food; lim-
ited resources meant keeping prisoners was impossible. On other occasions,
the killings were to prevent the town involved from ever seeking revenge. 
If a deal could be struck between attacker and the besieged citizens, it often
was. For example, the Spartan prisoners taken at Sphacteria by Kleon and
Demosthenes (see the previous section ‘Putting up a fight for Pylos’) were
taken only because they were a really useful bargaining tool.

Sometimes the defending city won of course. Laying siege was a lengthy,
arduous process and sometimes the attackers ran out of supplies (and
energy) first. However, more often than not it was the attackers that won and
the defenders who suffered the consequences.
War, like life itself in the ancient world, was a harsh and brutal business. The
Athenian plague of 430 BC is a good indication of how death was an ever-pre-
sent possibility for the ancient Greeks. While the difficulties of just staying
alive don’t in any way excuse the cold-blooded murders that frequently took
place, considering the difficult daily lives of the ancient Greeks does help cast
a light on the type of mindset that made the life-or-death decisions on the
battlefield.
Attempting – again! – to take Sicily 
Soon after the Athenians’ brutal siege on Melos they suffered one of the most
humiliating defeats ever as part of a failed Sicilian Expedition.
Amazingly, despite his role in the policy that had ended in defeat in
Mantineia, Alcibiades (see the previous section ‘Complicating the mix: Argos
and Alcibiades’) was still extremely influential in Athenian politics. When the
Sicilian city of Egesta asked for help in a local war with their neighbours
Selinous in the winter of 416 BC, Alcibiades enthusiastically championed the
cause.
The older statesman Nikias was more circumspect, but because the war with
Sparta had eased since Mantineia, the ekklesia happily voted to support
Egesta. The Athenians also voted that the generals in charge of the fleet
would be Nikias, Lamakhos, and Alcibiades himself.
Scandal and drama: Alcibiades
Just as the Athenian fleet was about to leave for Sicily, scandal hit the city.
First, people inflicted damage on some hermai, which were small statues of
the god Hermes that were associated with bringing good luck to travellers.
These hermai were sculpted with erect penises and vandals had snapped
them all off – ouch! The connection between the statues and the upcoming
Sicilian Expedition must have been obvious to the Greeks who interpreted it
as an attempt to curse the mission by desecrating images of the god of travel.
It was both sacrilegious and also considered a bad omen for those going to
Sicily, as it proved to be.
At almost the same time, in the ekklesia Alcibiades was accused of the crime
of mocking the Eleusinian Mysteries (a very strange, sacred ritual that I
describe in Chapter 22). Alcibiades’s actions seem to have merely been the
110

result of rich, young aristocrats living it up, but the consequences were very
serious. Before the Athenian fleet even reached Sicily, a messenger caught up
with them to announce that Alcibiades was being recalled to face prosecu-
tion. His reaction was to leave the fleet and sail to Sparta where he became
an adviser to his ex-enemies! For more on Alcibiades’s colourful life, see
Chapter 26.
Disaster in Sicily
The Athenian fleet did eventually arrive in Sicily – commanded by Lamakhos
and Nikias. Their first move was to lay siege to the great city of Syracuse that
was supporting Selinous, the town that had attacked Egesta. Lamakhos was
killed in early 414 BC, leaving Nikias in sole control. 
Things were progressing well for the Athenians until the Syracusans were
relieved by a group of Spartans who’d been sent to Sicily on the advice of –
you guessed it – Alcibiades!
The Athenians now found themselves blockaded into the harbour of Syracuse
and eventually the Athenian fleet was defeated. The Athenian soldiers tried
to retreat across land but were outmanoeuvred and defeated by the
Syracusans in 413 BC.
The results of the defeat were catastrophic for Athens. The commanders
(including Nikias) were executed and all the remaining prisoners forced to
work in the stone quarries of Syracuse. The existence was appalling with
death coming as a merciful release. Altogether, about 7,000 Athenian soldiers
and sailors were lost to death or slavery.
Thucydides firmly believed that the failure of the Sicilian Expedition was
probably the biggest catastrophe that Athens had ever suffered:
. . . for they were utterly and entirely defeated; their sufferings were on an
enormous scale; their losses were, as they say, total; army, navy, everything
was destroyed, and, out of many, only few returned.
Pondering the end of Athens
The defeat in Sicily was a real turning point in the Peloponnesian War. From
413 BC onwards, the war ceased to be a struggle between Athens and Sparta
and became an opportunity for others to get involved and get rich pickings.
The fat (Athenian) lady hadn’t sung yet, but she was certainly warming up.
However, in the end Athens’s final defeat was really prompted from within –
as I explain in Chapter 9.

Losing Their Way: The End 
of Classical Greece
In This Chapter
 Ending the Peloponnesian War 
 Marching to safety with Xenophon 
 Heralding the Hegemony of Thebes
 Foretelling the rise of Macedonia
A
s the Peloponnesian War dragged on toward a finish (see Chapter 8), the
era that historians consider ‘Classical Greece’ was also drawing to a
close. The dominance of the Greek city-states like Athens, Sparta, Thebes,
and Corinth didn’t have long to run. By around 350 BC, a new power emerged
in the north – Macedonia – and the Greek world was never the same. 
In this chapter, I look at what happened at the end of the Peloponnesian War
and the chaos that followed. The end of Classical Greece is a complicated –
but fascinating – period of ancient Greek history!
Weathering Tough Times: Athens
The failure of the Sicilian expedition in 413 BC (see Chapter 8) was almost a
mortal blow for Athens in its long battle with Sparta and its allies, which had
lasted decades. At a stroke, Athens lost several thousand fighting men, three
of its leading generals and a large portion of its fleet. But although Athens
was down, it certainly wasn’t out.

Preying on Athens: Another 
round of Persian intrigue
The rest of the Mediterranean was watching, including the Persians who’d
waged a brutal on/off war against Greece from 490 to 478 BC. (See Chapter 6
for all the gory details.)
Unsurprisingly, the Spartans were the first to take advantage of Athens’s
weakened stature. In 413 BC, the Spartans actually occupied Attica by making
a permanent fort outside the town of Dekeleia. The Spartans also began 
constructing a new fleet. 
Elsewhere, Athens’s empire was breaking up. Several places such as the
island of Lesbos revolted, knowing that the Athenians were unlikely to be
able to do anything about it.
Over-extending itself: 
Athens pesters Persia
At a time like this, you may be thinking that the last thing that the Athenians
wanted was to get involved in another foreign war – but that’s exactly what
happened. They threw their support behind the rebel Amorges who were
trying to bring Karia away from Persian control. 
Lending support to Amorges raised Persian awareness of Athens’s troubles,
and the Persians began to negotiate with Sparta. In return for Spartan sup-
port, Persia made large financial contributions to help build the new Spartan
fleet.
Staging a coup in Athens 
By 411 BC Persia wasn’t the only power that was trying to benefit from
Athens’s diminished status. While some of the Athenian fleet was moored 
at Samos, its commanders were contacted by good old Alcibiades (see
Chapter 8). After doing a bunk to Sparta, Alcibiades became (unsurprisingly)
unpopular with the Spartans and travelled to the Greek cities in Asia Minor,
ending up as a paid advisor at the court of a Persian satrap (regional gover-
nor) called Tissaphernes. However, Alcibiades had his eye on returning to
Athens – but on his own terms.
114
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires

Alcibiades knew that returning to Athens was going to be immensely difficult.
He was still technically on the run and had previously collaborated with
Sparta, Athens’s prime enemy. So he tried to convince the generals sent to
support Amorges to go back to Athens and represent him by stirring up trou-
ble against the current Athenian government. Alcibiades was effectively
proposing that Athens stage a revolution so that he could return. He would
gain support from the new regime from Persia. Say what you like about
Alcibiades, but he must have been some talker! 
Many of the Athenian generals rejected Alcibiades’s proposal and stayed on
Samos, forming a pro-democracy group, but one general called Peisandros
headed back to Athens and began agitating for revolt. A mixture of violence
and intimidation led to a coup taking place in Athens. A number of leading
members of the ekklesia were killed and others were forced to flee for their
safety – many of them went to the island of Samos. 
A new body of 400 was established, made up of 40 men (mostly aristocrats)
from each of Athens’s ten tribes. (See Chapter 7 for more on the composition
of Athens’s legislative bodies.) These new leaders made a pledge to divert all
financial resources to furthering the war against Sparta. In addition, 5,000 of
the wealthiest citizens agreed to pay for their own hoplite armour (see
Chapter 5) and form a fighting force.
That’s the way the ‘coup’ crumbles
But like so many political pledges the promise initiated in the coup was never
fulfilled. Vast numbers of the wealthier citizens left Athens, and the 400 new
aristocrats were unable to raise the money that they needed to fund more
fighting. Alcibiades fell out with Tissaphernes, so the promised Persian sup-
port never materialised either. In the end, Alcibiades ended up offering
advice to the exiled democrats that had fled to Samos from Athens after the
coup!
By September 411 BC the Athenians had run out of patience with the 400 new
political leaders who’d failed to bring about anything in particular. The
democrats that remained, led by a man called Cleophon, re-established
democracy, known as the ‘rule of 5,000’. It was so named because rule had
been handed back to the people, rather than 400 people ruling. It wasn’t that
5,000 people seized control!
By the way, Cleophon was known as the ‘lyremaker’ because he came, like
Kleon, from an artisan background.

The whole coup didn’t achieve much, but it did prove two things: 
 Athens’s devotion to democracy was surviving – even while engaged in a
long war with Sparta. 
 The divide between Athenian aristocrats and ‘new men’ (see Chapter 8)
was still carrying on.
Wrapping Up the Peloponnesian War
With the return of democracy, Athens started doing rather well again. Several
naval victories occurred between 410 and 407 BC – some of them involving
Alcibiades (see the earlier section ‘Staging a coup in Athens’) who had
thrown in his lot with the democrats who’d fled into exile on Samos and
returned to Athens with them.
Alcibiades’s success didn’t last. Sparta entered into another deal with Persia.
This time Cyrus, the youngest son of King Darius (who had invaded Greece in
479 BC – refer to Chapter 6), agreed to finance the Spartan fleet, and the new
Spartan ships won a famous victory off the coast of Asia Minor in 406 BC.
Alcibiades wasn’t present at the battle but was blamed for the defeat, so he
went into exile again, this time to Thrace.
Enduring great losses at Arginoussai
Athens’s boost was ultimately short-lived. In 406 BC, during what had been a
successful battle with the Spartan fleet near the Arginoussai islands, 13
Athenian ships were lost and 12 damaged. The two captains, or trierarchs, in
charge were unable to pick up the survivors due to a terrible storm. Around
3,000 Athenians were left to drown.

Thucydides passes the torch to Xenophon
Around time of the Athenian coup (411 BC),
Thucydides’s historical narrative History of the
Peloponnesian War runs out. Fortunately, read-
ers have another history that picks up almost
directly after, written by a man called Xenophon. 
Xenophon was a gentleman farmer from Attica
who had an eventful life (see the section
‘Mounting Problems in the Persian Empire’ later
in this chapter). In his retirement, Xenophon
wrote an extensive account of Greek history
during his lifetime. He is also one of the best
sources that we have for the philosopher
Socrates. Xenophon wrote many essays and
works of philosophy based around his method
of argument (see Chapter 23).

Six of the strategoi (generals) who were in charge of the campaign were put
on trial in Athens and executed. Athens could ill-afford the loss of some of its
most senior military minds and the decision proved a very unpopular one.
Running out of options
The following year Athens’s defeat was final. The Athenian fleet was beached
at the Hellespont (between Thrace and Asia Minor) when the Spartan com-
mander Lysander initiated a surprise attack. Almost the entire Athenian fleet
was captured with only nine ships escaping. The 26-year-long Peloponnesian
War was effectively over. With no fleet to protect Athens, Sparta and her
allies seemed likely to lay siege to the city. 
Xenophon paints a vivid picture of what it was like in Athens on the evening
the lone ship Paralos brought news of defeat to the city:
It was at night when the Paralos arrived at Athens. As the news of the
disaster was told, one man passed it to another, and a sound of wailing
arose and extended first from Piraeus, then along the long walls until it
reached the city. That night no one slept. They mourned for the lost, but
more still for their own fate.
Bowing to the Spartans: 
Athens after the war 
After the crushing final naval defeats, Athens expected the worst from Sparta.
As I explain in Chapter 8, cities that resisted siege attacks typically suffered
heavily after they were finally defeated. Also, Sparta and her allies had 25
years’ worth of grudges to avenge.

Chapter 9: Losing Their Way: The End of Classical Greece
Waiting in the wings: Going into exile
As you might have noticed, exile was a very
popular punishment in ancient Greece. In
essence it meant being sent away from your
city of origin and losing your rights as a citizen.
Exile was rarely permanent (due mostly to the
fractious nature of Greek politics!) and was an
obviously preferable alternative to being put to
death. Finding somewhere to be exiled could be
a problem because most exiles tended to be
aristocrats or leading politicians, so tended to
be wealthy and/or well connected. Aristocratic
exiles might stay with friends in another city or
set themselves up in a new town at their own
expense. People must have found it frustrating
to lose the opportunity to participate in the polit-
ical games in their native city, but they were
usually back in action again pretty soon. Two of
the most famous (and frequent) exiles were
Alcibiades and Pausanius; check out Chapter 27
for the full story on both of them.

Living under Spartan conditions
In the end, Athens wasn’t destroyed nor its population enslaved. After the
best part of a year in negotiation, Athens finally agreed to Sparta’s surrender
terms, which included the following:
 All territories that had previously been part of the Athenian empire were
set free of any obligations to Athens. They no longer had to pay tribute
or supply men for military service when asked.
 Athens’s fleet was to be limited to 12 ships. This number would be just
about enough to guard their harbours and was a dramatic reduction of
the fleet of over 100 that Athens had once enjoyed.
 The protective ‘long walls’ of the city (see Chapter 7) were to be 
demolished.
 All Athenian exiles had to be recalled.
 Athens was now a Spartan territory under Spartan control.
The surrender was a huge blow to a city that only 30 years before was the
dominant force in the Mediterranean world.
Establishing the rule of the Thirty
The Spartans forced Athens to break up its democracy and go back to 
oligarchic rule (oligarchy means ‘rule of the few’). In 404 BC, the Spartan 
general Lysander forced the Athenians to establish a new committee of 
118
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Socrates: Victim of a shifting society
One famous victim of the new regime in Athens
was the philosopher Socrates. Many Athenian
aristocrats didn’t trust Socrates, and he’d
refused to cooperate with the 30 tyrants. The
new democracy in Athens was distrustful of
anything different or against tradition. Socrates
held no official post but was one of the leading
intellectuals in Athens and had developed a
system of philosophical argument that involved
him challenging people’s assumptions and
questioning their beliefs. Usually this was about
moral and ethical questions but he was also
interested in justice and the way that the state
ran. He famously said, ‘All that I know is that 
I know nothing’ meaning that he didn’t claim 
to know any answers himself.
In 399 BC, he was put on trial for not respecting
the gods and corrupting the youth of the city.
These charges were trumped-up, and he was
most certainly framed – nevertheless he was
found guilty and sentenced to death. He died by
drinking hemlock – his own choice. This was a
relatively quick death but still a very painful one
because a person’s body would go very cold
before being gripped by a seizure. It was a sad
end for a great man in human history.

30 individuals to run the city (under Spartan supervision, or course). Many of
‘the Thirty’ were formerly exiled aristocrats who’d been involved in the oli-
garchic coup in 411 BC (see the earlier section ‘Staging a coup in Athens’)
and had only recently returned to the city. The Thirty’s authority was backed
up by 700 Spartan troops who served as a garrison in the city.
Unsurprisingly, the Thirty had a few scores to settle in Athens, and they used
their new authority to take full advantage. In his book Politics, the philoso-
pher Aristotle describes what happened when the Thirty came to power:
But when they had firmer control of the city, they spared none of the
citizens, but put to death those who were noted for their property, family,
and reputation, because this removed their own fear and they wanted to
appropriate their property; and in a short space of time they had done away
with no less than 1,500 . . .
No honour among thieves
So the 30 newly instated tyrants began turning on each other – and trials and
executions followed. At the same time democrats who’d left when the
Spartans arrived were trying to find support in other cities such as Thebes
(see the later section ‘Waging the Corinthian War’). Eventually, the democrats
returned to Athens in force in early 403 BC. The Thirty and their supporters
fought a battle against the democrats during which several of the tyrants
were killed.
The Spartan king Pausanias arrived to try and sort out the mess. Rather than
continue to force the oligarchy on Athens, he allowed a limited form of
democracy to return. The tyrants and their supporters were allowed to leave
and lived in exile in the town of Eleusis. Democracy was back but an atmos-
phere of distrust and plotting continued.
Winning at a cost: Sparta 
Presumably the Spartans were relishing the fact that they’d won a crushing
victory against their old enemy after a 26-year war? Well, not really. Victory 
in the Peloponnesian War proved to be almost as devastating for Sparta as
defeat was for Athens.
The first mistake that the Spartans made at the end of the war was the way
they dealt with the Athenian empire. Now that they controlled Athens the
Spartans were technically the rulers of all the territories that had been a part
of the Athenian empire. As a result the Spartans forced many Greek towns
and cities to adopt new oligarchic systems of government like that in Athens. 
119

Many of these towns had never directly opposed Sparta during the war, so
they now resented the harsh treatment they were receiving. Equally resentful
were Sparta’s allies in the former Peloponnesian League (see Chapter 8).
None of Sparta’s former allies got any reward at all when Sparta took control
of Athens despite the help that they’d given during the war.
Because the Spartans kept all the spoils, cities such as Thebes were happy to
shelter the pro-democracy exiles who fled from Athens during the time of the
rule of the Thirty. Sparta had almost become Thebes’s and Athens’s mutual
enemy.
Mounting Problems in the Persian Empire
At the same time as Athens and Sparta’s woes, trouble was brewing in the
Persian empire – and it had big consequences for Sparta and the rest of
Greece.
Marching through the desert with Cyrus
The Persian king Darius died in 404 BC and was succeeded by his son
Artaxerxes. Artaxerxes’s younger brother Cyrus decided to try and steal the
crown and set about recruiting an army.
Cyrus’s first port of call was Sparta, which he had helped greatly in the
Peloponnesian War (see the preceding section ‘Wrapping Up the Peloponnesian
War’). The Spartans were pretty much obliged to help Cyrus, and they did so by
sending an unofficial force to join up with the Greek mercenary army that Cyrus
was putting together.
The expedition didn’t go well. Cyrus was defeated and killed in a massive
battle at a place called Cunaxa near the Persian city of Babylon. His army of
Greek mercenaries was left stranded and leaderless in the middle of the
Persian desert!
Among Cyrus’s mercenary soldiers was Xenophon who’d signed up after the
Peloponnesian War ended (see the sidebar ‘Thucydides passes the torch to
Xenophon’). Xenophon and the other officers embarked on an incredible
march back through Persia and Asia Minor at the head of a force of 10,000
men. Xenophon wrote a book about the experience called the Anabasis, or
‘march up country’, which reads like a daily journal. The narrative’s details
are said to be so accurate that Alexander the Great used it as a travel guide
when he made the journey heading in the opposite direction 75 years later.
Reading these details, it’s easy to see why:
120
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

On this march the army ran short of corn and it was impossible to buy any
except in the Lydian market . . . where one could get a capithe of wheat
flour or pearl barley for four sigli. The siglus is worth seven and a half attic
obols, and the capithe is equal to three pints.
Xenophon and the other generals superbly brought 10,000 men all the way
back to Greek territory (in Asia Minor), but Xenophon didn’t get any thanks
for it. When he returned to Athens, Xenophon was put on trial. The charge
was that he commanded Spartan troops – which was true – but he was also
seen as a radical and was a known associate of Socrates. 
Xenophon was eventually sent into exile. Bad news for him but good for his-
torians because during this time of enforced retirement he started writing
history! He lived in Olympia for a while and then Corinth before returning to
Athens shortly before he died around 360 BC.
Seeking support from Sparta 
After the failure of Cyrus’s campaign, many of the Greek cities in Asia Minor
that had supported him worried they would be punished by the Persian king
Artaxerxes. The cities appealed to Sparta for help because the Spartans had
supported Cyrus and were now the dominant Greek state.
The Spartans didn’t let them down, fighting a series of campaigns to defend
the cities in Asia Minor. The Spartan king Agesilaos led the biggest of these
campaigns in 396 BC.
Unfortunately, the Spartans were about to learn that while taking responsibil-
ity for Greeks abroad, they left the back door open at home . . .
Waging the Corinthian War
While the Spartans engaged in events in Asia Minor, the other Greek states
took advantage. The main players were the Thebans who were still sore about
events of a few years before when they felt they hadn’t been adequately com-
pensated by Sparta for their support during the Peloponnesian War.
Forging an alliance with Thebes
In 395 BC, Thebes made a treaty with Athens to join forces against Sparta.
The partnership was a success, and they inflicted a heavy defeat on the
Spartans in a battle near Haliartos during which the Spartan commander
Lysander was killed. The Theban victory encouraged the other Greek states,
and by the end of 395 BC, Corinth and Argos had joined the partnership too. 
121
Chapter 9: Losing Their Way: The End of Classical Greece

This new powerful alliance set about the attack of Sparta. Due to the fact that
most of the action took place around the Isthmus of Corinth, the attack was
known as the Corinthian War.
Everybody fighting everybody else
The few years following 395 BC were a blur of battles in Greece and abroad
with the Corinthian War and Sparta still involved with Persia. In 394 BC the
Spartans were very successful against their Greek enemies, and the Spartan
king Agesilaos was recalled to help finish the job.
Having suffered some heavy defeats, the other Greek cities avoided open 
battles with the Spartans, preferring to carry out spoiling attacks on Spartan
territories. At the same time the Spartan fleet was almost completely
destroyed by the Persians near Knidos.
With the Spartans unable to stop them, the Persians sailed all round the west-
ern Mediterranean, kicking out Spartan garrisons from the former Athenian
allies that Sparta had taken over at the end of the Peloponnesian War (see the
preceding section ‘Bowing to the Spartans: Athens after the war’). The Spartan
hold on much of Greece and the surrounding areas had lasted just eight years.
Portending a dim future: 
Defeat at Lekhaion
The era of the Greek city-states was nearing an end – partly because their
continual wars were weakening them all! A particularly bleak omen of the
future came in 390 BC when a large Spartan force was defeated by a Greek
mercenary army at Lekhaion, near the city of Corinth. Once the greatest and
most feared army in the Mediterranean, the Spartans were humbled by men
fighting in a different way – as lightly-armed peltastai (see Chapter 5). And by
338 BC, the whole of Greece came under control of new fighters from the
north – the Macedonians (see Chapter 10).
Taking a breather – the King’s 
Peace (386 BC)
The Corinthian War rumbled on throughout the next decade with neither side
ever seeming likely to win a victory. (As Athens and Sparta found out before,
winning a war in mainland Greece was very difficult!) In the end, diplomacy
won out. In 386 BC, the Persian king Artaxerxes intervened and brokered a
major peace treaty. In the so-called King’s Peace:
122
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

 The Greeks agreed to allow Persia to control all the Greek cities in Asia
Minor. 
 All the other Greek cities were allowed to rule themselves and be free
from any kind of control by another state. 
 Any country that broke these terms faced attack by the Persian forces.
In a way, Artaxerxes was trying to put an end to all the empire building that
had been going on for the past century. The idea was brave – and good for
Persia too – but it was never going to last.
Forming the Athenian League
The Spartans first broke the truce set down by King Artaxerxes. Although
avoiding any interference in the Greek islands, for the next ten years Sparta
continually attacked the Greek towns in the Peloponnese. 
The King’s Peace had been designed to stop the many Greek towns from
ganging up together, but in the end it had the opposite effect. In 378 BC,
Athens and Thebes entered into another alliance. Others joined and the new
group of allies took the name of the Athenian League. 
This new league was very different from the Delian League (see Chapter 7).
Athens’s weakened position meant that the new league was a group with
common interests rather than an empire. Athens took no tribute from its
allies – it was a group of equals. 
The Athenian League made war on Sparta for the best part of the next ten
years. The Persians did nothing, despite the fact that these attacks clearly
broke the terms of the King’s Peace. In reality, the Persian king was perfectly
happy for the Greeks to fight among themselves – they were less of a problem
for him.
Figuring out the Battle of Leuktra: Greece
versus Sparta – and Thebes wins!
The ensuing war between the Athenian League and Sparta – surprise! – 
followed the pattern of nearly all the other campaigns of the past 50 years.
(The real winners appeared to be the Thebans who were building up their
territory and revenues from successful battles.)

As the war ground on, Athens found the fighting a real financial burden and
struggled to impose new taxes on the citizens to pay for it. The Athenians
organised a peace conference at which Sparta and Thebes fell out over who
would control the territories of Boiotia.
Before long Sparta and some of her allies (including Corinth which had
swapped sides) met the Thebans in battle outside the village of Leuktra in
Boiotia. Sparta and her allies easily outnumbered the Thebans and an easy
victory was expected. 
Only it didn’t turn out like that. The Thebans won a stunning victory over
Sparta and the Spartan king Kleombrotos was killed, along with more than
400 of Sparta’s crack troops, the Spartiates.
The Thebans won the Battle of Leuktra fair and square by lining up their pha-
lanx in a wedged formation. Traditionally, the phalanx was 12 lines deep, but
the Thebans lined up 50 deep on the left to make a kind of triangle, like a
wedge of cheese. This formation meant their strongest troops (on the left)
heavily attacked the Spartans’ right (their strongest point) before the weaker
Theban troops had even joined the battle. 
The Spartans reacted to the defeat in a typically strange way. According to
Xenophon:
Also, while [the Spartans] gave the names of all the dead to the relatives
concerned they told them to bear their suffering in silence and avoid any
cries of lamentation. And so on the following day you could see those whose
relatives had been killed going about in public looking bright and happy,
while those whose relatives had been reported living . . . were walking
about looking gloomy and sorry for themselves.

Playing in the Sacred Band
Thebes’s ascent was partly due to the flexible
tactics that it had shown at Leuktra, but key to
its success were its new elite soldiers.
Although they sound like a Christian rock group,
the ‘Sacred Band’ was actually 300 elite troops
from Thebes trained by a man called Pelopidas.
These soldiers were called ‘sacred’ because
they were originally created to guard the sacred
citadel of the city (an area like the Acropolis in
Athens). 
What made the Sacred Band even more
unusual was that each man was paired with
another who was both his companion in the
battle line and his lover. The idea was that each
man would be inspired to fight even harder with
his lover next to him. Homosexuality wasn’t
thought unusual in Greece (see Chapter 15), but
this was still a radical idea.

Celebrating the Hegemony of Thebes
For a brief time Thebes became the dominant city in Greece, and this period
from 371 to 362 BC became known as the ‘Hegemony of Thebes’. 
Dismantling the Athenian League
As Sparta declined, Athens used its now-restored fleet to try the same trick
that it had with the Delian League (see Chapter 7). Athenian ships began sail-
ing to islands in the Mediterranean and asking for tribute money; eventually,
allies became territories. 
In contrast to the era under the Delian League, Athens wasn’t powerful
enough to sustain this kind of policy. By 357 BC, members of the Athenian
League who were refused permission to leave went into open revolt and a
small war followed until 355 BC. The Athenian League eventually broke up as
members drifted away.
Signalling the end of classical Greece
By the middle of the fourth century BC, the once proud city-states of Greece
were in trouble. A new power, Macedonia, was developing in the north and
soon its king, Philip II, had most of southern Greece under his control.
Imagine – the Greek city-states that only 150 years earlier had combined to
beat Persia were now about to become insignificant. 
Xenophon ends his history Hellenica with a description of the battle of
Mantineia in 362 BC. At this battle, the Thebans beat a collection of other
cities, including both Athens and Sparta. He concludes by pointing out that
yet another big battle had really solved nothing:
Both sides claimed the victory, but it cannot be said that . . . either side was
any better off after the battle than before it. In fact, there was even more
uncertainty and confusion in Greece after the battle than there had been
previously.
Xenophon gives a pretty good summary of everything that happened to the
Greek city-states since the start of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC.
Unfortunately, the Greek city-states had nobody to blame but themselves.
After all that had happened – all the wars, treaties, small empires, leagues,
and broken promises – the once-great city-states were at the mercy of
another foreign invader, the Macedonians, which I cover in Chapter 10.

asically, by 360 BC the Greek city-states had blown it. The constant
infighting and deal breaking among Athens, Sparta, and the rest had
opened the door to foreign enemies. And so, during the fourth century BC, a
new power emerged – Macedonia. 
In a little over 50 years, the Macedonians went from being thought of as
simple, barbarous hill people to being the dominant force in Greece and
beyond. This amazing ascent came down to two men: Philip II and his son
Alexander the Great. Their story, as well as the history of this fascinating 
culture, starts here.
Meeting the Macedonians
Macedonia was (and is) the territory to the north of Greece formed by the
north and north-west ends of the Thermaic Gulf. Macedonia is a hard and
rugged country, and throughout its earliest history it had always existed as a
tribal society. The Macedonians were Greek in origin, and they spoke a
broader, rougher version of the Greek language that was related to the tradi-
tional version spoken in Athens (Chapter 1 has more on the intricacies of the
ancient Greek language).

Have you seen the film Alexander (2004)? It’s an entertaining depiction of
Alexander the Great’s life with some fantastically shot battle sequences.
However, one element of the film that people and reviewers criticised was
actor Colin Farrell’s accent. Farrell spoke in his natural Irish accent through-
out the movie. Viewers missed the point: The difference between Farrell’s
regional accent and an English accent is a really good way of showing the
contrast between the ancient Macedonian and Greek cultures. I’m not so sure
about Angelina Jolie’s accent though. . . .
Growing very good at war
Throughout much of its early history Macedonia was a tribal society made up
of a large number of competing groups who spent most of their time at war
with each other. The lives most Macedonians led were quite simple – hunting
and fighting, and then drinking long into the night to celebrate success in
either.
The Macedonians were also excellent warriors. By the fourth century BC,
they had extended their territory to the borders of Illyria in the west and
Paeonia in the north.
The trouble was, as I said earlier, much like the Greek city-states during the
same time period; the tribes of Macedonia were always fighting among them-
selves. For this reason, the country was very inward looking during much of
its early history and only really interacted with other Greek states through a
limited amount of trade.
Crowning a new kind of king: Philip II
The Macedonian kings traditionally ruled from a fortress in a town called
Aegae. The Macedonian king didn’t have absolute power over his subjects:
 The king had to observe Macedonian law and make decisions that were
in keeping with it. This law had been set down generations earlier by
previous tribal leaders and decisions were debated within a council of
tribal leaders.
 The king’s title wasn’t hereditary. When the king died, the tribal leaders
chose his successor although often they chose the son of the previous
king.
The big change to Macedonia and its governing processes came with the
death of King Perdiccas in 359 BC. Perdiccas’s son Amyntas was only a child
at the time of his father’s death and his uncle Philip became his protector. As
128
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

guardian to the heir, Philip also became temporary ruler of the kingdom until
a decision was made about who should succeed. However, he didn’t stay tem-
porary for long.
Despite being only 24 years old, Philip made an immediate impact. He utterly
rejected established laws and tradition and sought to establish himself as
king through violence. Philip attacked in battle or murdered any other rival
for the throne, and he set about securing the borders of Macedonia from the
rebellious tribes of Illyria. As soon as that was done, he turned his ambitious
eye to the south and Greece.
Considering Macedonian warfare
Prior to 350 BC, the Macedonians weren’t really too much of a threat to the
inhabitants of southern Greece. So what changed? 
Building a different army
The new way in which Philip II made war on his enemies was a huge change –
and a huge threat to the southern city-states. Philip II created a unique fight-
ing force that the traditional Greek hoplite phalanx (see Chapter 5) found 
difficult to deal with. 
Following are some of the main tricks and tactics of the Macedonian forces
under Philip II:
 Shock cavalry: Philip’s army was very large and mixed, meaning it 
contained a heavy infantry phalanx as well as cavalry and light troops.
Unlike in traditional Greek armies, the Macedonians used their cavalry
to charge and break the enemy line. Therefore the cavalry became the
Macedonian’s main offensive weapon.
 The sarissa: The Macedonian infantry was armed differently to its
southern Greek neighbours. Rather than the short spear or javelin used
by the southern Greeks the Macedonian’s main offensive weapon was a
4.5-metre (15-foot) thrusting spear called a sarissa. This weapon made
getting anywhere near the infantry line very difficult, particularly
because the Macedonian phalanx was so well drilled it could form half a
dozen different formations very quickly. See Figure 10-1 for some forma-
tion examples.
 The hypaspists: The Macedonians had their own special troops called
the hypaspists who were used for special missions that required different
tactics to a standard infantry battle. The hypaspists were famously fear-
less and took on all kinds of ludicrously dangerous tasks such as climb-
ing cliffs to attack towns and assaulting cities at night. They were more
lightly armed than the phalanx and, as such, much more mobile.

Revealing the secret weapon – camaraderie
Despite all the advances and adaptations of its army, the main reason that
Macedonia became so powerful so quickly was the personality of Philip II
himself. 
The Macedonians had always been a warrior people but had spent genera-
tions fighting each other. Philip’s personality, political intelligence, and ruth-
lessness brought the warring tribal leaders together and focused their
bravery and skill on mutual enemies.

Philip kept up a culture of hard work and hard play that involved drinking
long into the night to celebrate victories. The hard work must have been
exhausting – but it worked.
Taking Over: Philip’s Successes
During the 350s BC, Philip II and a now professionalised Macedonian army
began to seize control of large parts of Greece. In 357 BC, Philip captured the
city of Amphipolis (which Athens had long thought its own), and by 352 BC
virtually the whole of Thessaly in Northern Greece was under his control.
The Thessalians were famous for using their heavily armed cavalry troops in
a battle, and Philip quickly incorporated them into his army. 
Another notable success occurred around this same time. Throughout his
reign Philip regularly conducted dynastic marriages within the cities and ter-
ritories he conquered. In 356 BC, he and Olympias of Epirus had a baby son
whom Philip called Alexander. (Ever heard of him?) You can read a lot more
about him in the section ‘Taking Over the Family Business: The Rise of
Alexander the Great’ and in Chapter 11.
Continuing despite criticism 
During the 350s BC the rest of Greece was too stunned by Philip’s success to
really challenge him and the Macedonian forces. The main opposition came
from a new Athenian statesman called Demosthenes. Demosthenes was a
great speech writer and orator – and almost the exact opposite of Philip. Like
Kleon (see Chapters 8 and 9), Demosthenes came from a trade background.
His father had owned a business that made cutlery and so his nickname was
the ‘cutler’.
Demosthenes delivered many great speeches in the Athenian ekklesia urging all
Greeks to rise up against Philip. These orations became known as Philippics, a
term people still use to this day to describe a character assassination delivered
in the form of a speech. Indeed, 400 years after Demosthenes when the Roman
orator Cicero was haranguing Mark Anthony, Cicero’s speeches were called
philippics.
Philip carried on with his conquest plans, regardless of Demosthenes’s
speeches, by making war in the north-west as far as Thrace. By 348 BC the
Macedonians had destroyed the town of Olynthos and sold its population
into slavery. Philip found some Athenians in town and kept them as hostages
to use as a bargaining tool. He recognised that it wouldn’t be long before he
came into conflict with Athens and the hostages would prove useful.

Agreeing to peace (sort of)
Athens had a problem. Despite all the urging of Demosthenes, Athens couldn’t
afford to fight a war with Philip, and it didn’t have the manpower either. 
In 346 BC, a peace conference was proposed and an Athenian called
Philokrates led the negotiations. Philip eventually agreed to a non-aggression
treaty with Athens.
Soon after the peace conference, Philip took advantage of trouble in southern
Greece where the town of Phocis had seized the sacred town of Delphi. (Turn
to Chapter 22 for more on this prophecy-rich city.) The Macedonians quickly
marched south, kicked out the Phocians, and earned the thanks of Delphi.
Thereafter Philip tried to portray himself as a kind of peacekeeper who’d
intervene if necessary to settle disputes. It’s doubtful that people truly
believed this but they weren’t really in a position to argue with him.
Invading everywhere except Athens 
Philip wasn’t actually that bothered with Athens or much of southern Greece.
He had other fish to fry: He had an eye on an amazingly ambitious invasion of
Asia Minor. 
Philip spent the years after the peace agreement concentrating on areas
north-east of Athens, laying siege to the port of Byzantium on the Bosphorus.
Of course, Athens viewed this attack as a threat to the cities in southern
Greece because a great deal of grain came from there. The political intrigue
against Philip continued in Athens which eventually spurred him into seizing
the grain ships in 340 BC.
When Philip seized the ships he finally gave Demosthenes what his critic was
looking for – the excuse for Athens to declare war on the Macedonians, which
they duly did. The Athenians had support from some of the other major
cities, such as Corinth and Thebes – all which feared Philip and felt that as
rich, powerful cities, they’d be next on his hit-list.
Battling in Chaeronea (338 BC)
The Battle of Chaeronea was one of the biggest in Greek history and the last
real stand of the old Greek states against the new Macedonian power from
the north. The world was never the same again after this brutal fight.
The two sides – the Macedonians and the allied southern Greek city-states –
met outside the town of Chaeronea in Boeotia.
132
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The allies had a large force of more than 35,000 men from Athens, Corinth,
Euboea, Megara, and Thebes, among others. Philip’s forces numbered a little
less at about 30,000, but he had 1,800 cavalry (see the earlier section
‘Considering Macedonian warfare’), which was under the command of his
then 18-year-old son Alexander.
The battle was a tough struggle, but in the end the Athenians blew it for
themselves. After the two infantry lines came together, Philip’s hypaspists
feigned a withdrawal. The Athenians on the left end of the allied line bought
the ruse hook, line, and sinker, and chased after the Macedonians. The allied
forces’ attack created a massive hole in their line, which Alexander exploited
and drove the Macedonian cavalry through. Alexander was then able to sur-
round the Thebans who were the most feared allied fighters. Game over.
Thousands of the Greek allies lost their lives at Chaeronea, and Philip took
several thousand more prisoners. The famous Sacred Band was almost com-
pletely destroyed with 254 of the 300 killed. A permanent memorial was set
up to honour them in the form of a large statue of a lion that still exists today.
Philip’s victory was complete. Several Greek towns including Thebes were
garrisoned with Macedonian troops. As far as Philip was concerned, the job
was done. In terms of his own lifetime he was correct but his son Alexander
would have to finish the job after Philip’s death.
Enjoying Prosperity at Pella
Philip was an incredible soldier, and he also made great strides to turn
Macedonia into what he considered to be a civilised power. One of his first
moves was the confirmation of the second city of Pella as the base of his
royal court, setting up residence there and meeting with the tribal chiefs. The
city’s new status meant that tribal leaders from Macedonia and beyond
flocked to the city because they wanted to be close to the king and the
wealth and success that he’d generated. 
Not much of the city survives today. Archaeologists have found the remains
of a royal palace which could well have been developed from the one used by
Philip. Evidence exists of a massive agora (town square) that would have
been filled during the fourth century by all the visitors to the city.
Along with Pella’s new prominence, a new elite class soon emerged. All the
sons of the Macedonian tribal leaders lived and were educated in the city.
Chief among them was Philip’s son Alexander. The group of young nobles
who grew up with Alexander became known as his ‘Companions’. They
became a new generation who were both highly educated and skilled in war –
a new warrior elite. Young men such as Ptolemy and Hephaestion grew up to
share the amazing adventures of Alexander’s adult life. See the later section
‘Following in his father’s footsteps’ for more. 
133
Chapter 10: Rising Quickly to the Top: Macedonia

Pella became a magnet for artists and intellectuals who, like Renaissance
painters, were keen to seek employment and patronage of the royal court
where high fees would be paid for their skills. Some also worked as tutors to
the ‘Companions’. This process had already begun under previous
Macedonian kings – for example, the playwright Euripides spent time in
Macedonia during the beginning of the fourth century BC – but the city’s
stature increased tenfold under Philip.
Philip himself had no great interest in intellectual affairs, but he was happy to
sponsor them because he recognised that if Macedonia was to become a truly
international power its new generation of leaders would need to become more
worldly. Philip had grand ambitions for Macedonia and ultimately he wanted
to test its military power against the might of the Persian Empire. 
In particular, he employed the Greek philosopher Aristotle (see Chapter 23)
as one of Alexander’s tutors.
The Greek biographer Plutarch wrote an entertaining life of Alexander in
which he quotes a letter from the young prince to Aristotle. Alexander com-
plains that Aristotle has written a book describing some of the philosophical
ideas that his tutor had shared with him:
What advantage shall I have over other men if these theories in which 
I have been trained are to be made common property?
The court at Pella gave Alexander a great training in all aspects of Greek
knowledge. Combined with his obvious aptitude and first-hand experience of
warfare on his father’s campaigns, he grew into an amazingly confident and
authoritative young man.
Taking Over the Family Business: 
The Rise of Alexander the Great
All things change, and in 336 BC, when Philip was at the height of his power,
he suddenly and suspiciously died. His death could have been the end of a
brief moment of Macedonian supremacy; instead it heralded the beginning of
an era of even greater success under his son Alexander.
Slaying Philip
In 337 BC Philip had received a Greek delegation that wanted to sue for
peace. The delegation ended up awarding him the title of hegemon (‘domi-
nant leader’) of all the Greek armies. This title basically gave Philip the
134
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

authority he needed to attack Persia because he would be doing so in the
name of all Greece – on the premise of liberating the Greek cities in Asia
Minor. (Yes, that old excuse again!)
In the summer of 336 BC, Philip was in Pella celebrating the marriage of his
daughter when he was assassinated by one of his bodyguards. Suspicion
immediately fell on his wife Olympias who’d recently been sent into exile
after Philip had married again. The assassin was killed in the struggle by
Alexander before he could be questioned – a fact that many people inter-
preted as an attempt to hush things up. Philip’s death certainly had benefits
for Olympias – her son Alexander became king at the age of 20. 
In Alexander (2004), Olympias is blamed as being behind the scheme and
Alexander an innocent bystander. However, I find it difficult to believe that he
didn’t know anything. What do you think?
Separating the man and the myth 
Alexander the Great is a fascinating historical figure. He achieved incredible
things in an amazingly short time. No one like him has ever existed before him –
or after him. The problem with somebody like this is that he can become a
magnet for all kinds of myths and stories. What Alexander did isn’t really in 
dispute, but how he did it and what he was like as a person always will be.
Alexander was also quite happy to make up his own myth. As a boy and
throughout his adult life he was fascinated by Homer’s The Iliad and the
heroes like Achilles and Hector that feature in it (see Chapter 21). Alexander
thought of himself in the same terms and contended that he was actually
descended from Achilles.
135
Chapter 10: Rising Quickly to the Top: Macedonia
A horse and his boy
One of the most famous larger-than-life stories
about Alexander concerns how he came to own
Bucephalas (‘Ox-Head’), the massive warhorse
that he rode for most of his life. 
Apparently, a trader from Thessaly brought the
huge black horse to show Philip. Nobody could
calm the creature enough to ride it. Alexander
asked whether Philip would buy the horse for
him if Alexander were able to train it, and Philip
agreed. Within a few minutes Alexander was
happily riding Bucephalas. Alexander had
noticed that the horse was scared of its 
own shadow and turned him toward the sun 
so he couldn’t see it any longer.
This story is a great example of a histor-
ical event that’s probably exaggerated. Still, 
this story is simple and highlights Alexander’s
most obvious and admired characteristics –
confidence, bravery, and intelligence – were
present at an early age.

His mother didn’t help. From an early age Olympias had told Alexander that
his real father was not Philip but Zeus, the king of the gods and that various
prophecies had foretold his birth. (Philip and Olympias’s marriage was a less
than ideal relationship, with him regularly accusing her of adultery. To be
honest the family would’ve been perfect for Jerry Springer.)
As a result of this kind of upbringing, Alexander was a bit different. His family
and early life explain a great deal about him – particularly his tremendous
courage and drive. And his background also explains some of the strange
decisions that he later made (see Chapter 11).
Following in his father’s footsteps
When he assumed power, Alexander immediately began planning to do
exactly what his father had intended – invade Asia Minor and attack the
Persian Empire. Alexander had two distinct advantages:
 Alexander had all his father’s old generals – men like Parmenion, Antipater,
and Cleitus – around to help and advise him. Alexander spent hours on the
eve of a battle planning strategy with these generals, confident that they
would carry out all manoeuvres to the letter. 
 Alexander was also part of an exceptional group of young Macedonian
men who became known as the ‘Companions’. As I mention in the sec-
tion ‘Enjoying Prosperity at Pella’, these friends and peers – including
Hephaestion, Ptolemy, Cassander, Nearchus, and others – had grown up
with Alexander. The Companions fought alongside Alexander now; many
of them riding in his companion cavalry.
Alexander, however, had a significant problem: As a new king, city-states with
a grudge against Macedonia were going to try their luck against the new lead-
ership. Before Alexander ventured off on his grand adventure to the east, he
had to deal with problems closer to home.
Quieting Illyria and Thrace
The first areas to give Alexander trouble were the border regions in Illyria
and Thrace. Times were tense because neither side yet knew whether the
new young king would effectively take over after his father.
Alexander soon proved the doubters wrong. Within three months he invaded
Thrace and utterly destroyed any opposition. While he was there, news came
that the Illyrian tribes were now massing on the border with Macedonia and
preparing to invade. Once again Alexander dealt extremely well with a diffi-
cult campaign. 
136

After two difficult tests, Alexander was probably due a break – but he didn’t
get one. As he was finishing off the Illyrians, news came of a revolt in Thebes.
Squelching the Theban revolt
After Thebes rebelled against Philip II (see the section ‘Battling in Chaeronea’),
Philip left a Macedonian garrison in the city to keep an eye on the Thebans.
However, while Alexander was campaigning in Illyria, a rumour began to circu-
late that he had been killed. Where had this rumour come from? Unsurprisingly,
the source was dear old Demosthenes (see the section ‘Continuing despite criti-
cism’) who produced an eyewitness who swore that Alexander had been killed.
Demosthenes didn’t stop there; he urged Greece to revolt and write to Persia for
support. 
The Greek cities saw this as a great opportunity. If Alexander was dead
Macedonia would be leaderless and it would be the perfect time to strike
back. In Thebes two Macedonian officers were killed and the rest of the garri-
son were forced to go into hiding in the citadel.
In his biography of Demosthenes, Plutarch records his opinion of the young
Alexander:
Demosthenes now completely dominated the Athenian assembly and he
wrote letters to the Persian generals in Asia inciting them to declare war on
Alexander, whom he referred to as a boy, and compared to Margites.
The ‘Margites’ that Plutarch mentions was a character in a comic story of the
day who never really grew up and thought he knew much more than he actu-
ally did. Demosthenes and the rest of Greece were about to find out how
wrong that comparison was.
Alexander’s response to the Theban revolt was swift and brutal. In 335 BC, he
marched quickly south, surrounded the city, and took it with little effort. The
walls of the city and many of its significant buildings were burned down.
Alexander’s men massacred thousands of the population and sold those that
survived into slavery. The city of Thebes effectively ceased to exist from this
point on. Although many buildings were rebuilt, Thebes was never again a
leading city.
Alexander had sent a harsh message to the ancient world: Any revolt or
betrayal against Macedonia would be dealt with severely. Alexander needed
to ensure that when he left for Persia he wouldn’t come under attack at
home.
137

However, Alexander made some noteworthy exceptions in his destruction of
Thebes. All the temples within Thebes were left alone, as were the houses of
the descendants of the poet Pindar whom Alexander much admired. These
exceptions illustrate the complex character of Alexander: fierce brutality
mixed with an appreciation of architecture and literature. 
After dealing with the Thebans, Alexander moved south. The Athenians,
especially Demosthenes, must’ve been seriously worried that they were
about to receive the same treatment the Thebans had. A hurried meeting of
the ekklesia was arranged, and Athens voted to send an embassy congratulat-
ing Alexander on his recent victories in the north and celebrate the just way
that he’d dealt with the Thebans!
Initially, Alexander demanded that Demosthenes and the other anti-Macedonian
agitators be handed over to him, but Demosthenes, as ever, managed to argue
his way out of the situation. Athens received no further punishment, but
Alexander ensured that an eye was kept on it.
By 334 BC, Alexander managed to get Greece back into the position it was in
before his father’s death. He was acknowledged as the hegemon of the Greek
cities and the general of their armies. With the borders of Macedonia secure,
he now needed to complete his father’s project – the invasion of the Persian
Empire. 
Although Philip’s intention (and main excuse) for attacking the Persians had
been the liberation of the Greek cities in Asia Minor, Alexander ended up
taking his campaign so much farther – to India and back. This incredible
story is what Chapter 11 is all about!

–Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander
A
rrian, a Greek who became a general in the Roman army in the second
century AD, wrote the above words about Alexander’s skill as a general
in his book – which is still in print today. Arrian was a sober, reflective man,
not given to making fanciful statements, so his assessment of Alexander is
quite compelling.
Indeed, Alexander the Great was an extraordinary individual – visionary, bril-
liant, cruel, vengeful, and probably more than a little insane. Alexander was
20 years old when he became king of Macedonia. By the time he died, 12
years later, he’d changed the Mediterranean world. This chapter charts his
incredible course.

Popping In on the Persian Empire
The Persian Empire had changed a huge amount in the 150 years after the
Persian Wars (see Chapter 6 for more). By 334 BC the king very loosely ruled
the massive territories that made up the empire, and local rulers or satraps
effectively ran the show in their own territories. Central control had relaxed
considerably since the days of the invasion under Xerxes in 490 BC.
During Alexander’s reign, the Persian king was Darius III, who seized the
throne in 335 BC after helping to instigate the assassination of his predeces-
sor. He was a weak king, but he had the huge wealth of the Persian Empire
and its massive manpower at his disposal. 
Although the Persian army was huge, it did have a problem. In many ways,
the Persians were the complete opposite of the unified, well-drilled, and pro-
fessional Macedonian army (see Chapter 10).
With the exception of Darius’s personal troops, the Persian army was drawn
from throughout the empire and thrown together when needed. Many of the
troops didn’t speak the same language. In many cases, they had very little to
fight for and were basically forced to do so. 
Spin versus Reality: The 
Reasons for Invasion
So why did Alexander want to go to Persia? The real reason was the desire for
adventure, conquest, and glory that underpinned his whole life. The idea of
invading Asia Minor was originally that of his father, Philip II, who wanted the
wealth that the Persian-controlled cities possessed. 
The official reasons were very different. The Macedonians were seeking to
‘liberate’ the Greek cities under Persian control and gain revenge for the
Persian invasions of Greece in the fifth century BC.
Overwhelming Persia at the 
battle of the Granicus River
Alexander’s first real confrontation with the Persian army came at the battle
of the Granicus River in 334 BC.
140

The Persian army that came to meet Alexander at the Granicus was made up
of large numbers of troops from the most westerly parts of the Persian
Empire. Darius wasn’t present at the battle and the Persians were com-
manded by the western satraps. The Persians camped at the bottom of a hill
across the river Granicus from Alexander’s camp. 
Alexander had to cross the river to attack with his Companion cavalry (refer
to Chapter 10), breaking a hole in the Persian line. The weakened Persian line
gave the Macedonian sarissa-wielding infantry and hypaspists a chance to get
over and engage the centre. Fighting furiously, the Macedonians managed to
surround the Persian infantry, and the other Persian troops fled the field. It
was an amazing victory that owed a lot to the incredible charge by Alexander
and the cavalry.
Considering a controversy 
But was Alexander’s attack and victory that simple? The battle of Granicus
River is very controversial because the sources disagree on whether Alexander
crossed the river at night to surprise the Persians with an attack in the morn-
ing, or rode straight across it in the morning as the battle began. 
You may think that the time of the attack doesn’t really matter, but depending
on when it happened, the Granicus was either a great ‘surprise attack’ by
Alexander or an amazing example of fighting a standard infantry battle from a
situation of great disadvantage. Either is impressive but it would be great to
know which it was! This discrepancy is an excellent example of how careful
historians have to be when dealing with a quasi-mythical figure like Alexander.
Doling out harsh punishment
The Persian army defeated at the battle of Granicus contained a lot of Greek
mercenaries. Alexander dealt harshly with them. Many thousands were killed
and the rest sent back to Macedonia in chains to work in the mines. (The
Athenians on the Sicilian Expedition – see Chapter 8 – suffered a similarly
grim fate under Alexander’s father.)
Liberating the Greeks
I mention in Chapter 10 that Alexander’s main reason for attacking Persia was
to liberate the Greek cities in Asia Minor. Whether they needed liberating was
a bit of an open question. 
The Greek cities were locally ruled by Persian satraps, but they were pretty
autonomous and their only obligation was to pay taxes to their satraps. Still,
the Greek cities’ attitude seemed to be ‘Anything for a quiet life’, and they
threw in their lot with Alexander as he marched south-east through Asia
Minor, liberating them as he went.

Slipping by at the battle at Issus 
After the Battle of the Granicus River, the next big confrontation between
Alexander and the Persian Empire came when Alexander headed south from
Asia Minor into what’s known as the Levantine coast. This stretch of land
includes Syria and the Holy Land and links the near Middle East with Egypt,
as Figure 11-1 shows.
Alexander and his troops had been on the road for a year. Having success-
fully liberated many Greek cities, Alexander decided to press on into the
heartlands of the Persian Empire and defeat the Persian king Darius. 
However, by 333 BC, Alexander had travelled so far south that Darius now
appeared to the north of the Macedonian army outside the town of Issus –
cutting off Alexander from the way that he’d come. Alexander had to fight the
Persians in order to protect the supply lines that he’d established in the
towns and cities that he’d already passed through. 
Although the Persians never defeated Alexander, the battle of Issus was a
dodgy one. It was fought on a plain in between the sea (to Alexander’s left)
and some hilly ground (on his right). The Persians outnumbered Alexander
by two to one, but many of the Persian troops had been pressed into service
against their will (see the section ‘Popping In on the Persian Empire’). 
A fierce battle raged and the Persians fell back across the river Pandarus. The
Macedonian infantry really struggled against the Persians’ superior numbers
and the difficult terrain. In a decisive manoeuvre, Alexander took his cavalry
up into the hills before veering left and charging for Darius’s chariot. This
was an inspired move but also a highly dangerous one – a great example of
142
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
A knotty problem
In 333 BC, during Alexander’s trip through Asia
Minor, a famous, semi-historical event hap-
pened that’s a great example of the kind of
mythologised stories that attach themselves to
him. When Alexander arrived at the Greek town
of Gordium, he was shown the famous ‘Gordian
Knot’ that fastened a chariot to a tree.
Supposedly, the chariot had been tied to the
tree for hundreds of years and locals believed
the man that could untie it would become the
ruler of the whole world.
Based on accounts of the day and later mythol-
ogising, Alexander had a quick look, decided it
was a bit tricky, and cut the knot in two with his
sword. It was a logical solution that was typical
of Alexander: the quickest and most expedient
way to solve the problem that disregarded the
traditional approach. It didn’t seem to matter
that he didn’t untie it either – he still went on to
conquer Asia and beyond.

what Alexander was like. Darius wisely did a runner – and before long so did
much of the Persian army.
Issus was a great victory for Alexander but not a total one. Darius was still
alive and Alexander knew he’d probably face even greater numbers of
Persians the next time they met.
Getting Tyre’d out
Throughout 333 BC, Alexander continued to move south down the Levantine
coast. As he went, cities either welcomed him or he forced them to.
Alexander had a particularly tricky time at the siege of the ancient city of
Tyre (refer to Figure 11-1). Here, the people had fled to the sanctuary of the
citadel, which was on an island just under a kilometre off the coast.

Alexander’s solution was to build a mole, or causeway, out to the island. The
siege required seven months of continual attacks on the island before it fell.
In the end, only a combined infantry and naval assault on all four sides of 
the island enabled Alexander to defeat the incredibly resistant Tyrenians.
More than 30,000 citizens were sold into slavery as punishment. Finally, in
July 332 BC, Alexander was able to leave.
Taking a Surprising Turn: 
Alexander in Egypt
Given the fact that Darius was still at large and that he’d spent so long at Tyre
(see the preceding section), Alexander’s next step was quite surprising – he
chose to head toward Egypt.
Walking like an Egyptian
By the fourth century BC, Egypt had fallen from its centuries of greatness and
was part of the Persian Empire. Check out The Ancient Egyptians For Dummies
(Wiley) by Charlotte Booth for all the details of the rise and fall of this 
amazing culture. 
By far the most ancient civilisation in the Mediterranean world, Egypt was
still something of a mystery to most Greeks – and there was no way
Alexander could resist it. Alexander received a rapturous welcome when he
arrived at the Egyptian town of Pelusium in 332 BC. The Egyptians saw him as
a liberator who’d freed them from Darius. To show their thanks, they made
him their new pharaoh. Up to this point Egypt had been under the control of
a Persian satrap called Mazaces who surrendered as soon as Alexander
arrived.
As pharaoh, all the palaces of Egypt and its immense wealth were now at
Alexander’s disposal. He set out on a voyage down the river Nile to visit the
ancient capital of Memphis. 
Turning into a god
After returning from his visit to Memphis, Alexander set out for the ancient
Siwah oasis, which involved a huge trek across the desert. The journey was
extremely difficult – even today the trip is incredibly hard if you go across the
desert the way that Alexander did. 
144
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Alexander’s reason for going to the oasis was to consult its famous oracle
and, allegedly, discover whether he was the son of a god. The story goes that
the oracle identified him as being the son of the Egyptian god Ammon who
Greeks equated with their own god Zeus. This, of course, fitted quite nicely
with what his mother Olympias had always told him (see Chapter 10) – so
Alexander wasn’t inclined to argue. 
The events at the Siwah oasis were very controversial to the Greek mind,
which clearly delineated between men and gods (see Part IV for the low-
down.) Later on, this proved a problem for Alexander and his Macedonian 
followers (see the section ‘Going Persian’). But the notion of Alexander as 
a god in human form was entirely acceptable to both the Egyptian and
Persian systems of belief – indeed, kings and rulers in these cultures were
worshipped as gods. 
Founding the first Alexandria
While in Egypt, Alexander spent a lot of time reorganising its government and
appointing his own men as officials to oversee the running of his new territo-
ries. These efforts were nothing new; he’d been doing so all the way down
from Asia Minor. But in Egypt he also decided to found a new city. 
Choosing a spot at the mouth of the Nile, Alexander declared that it would be
his new capital – called Alexandria. He recognised that the location would be
a tremendous port and would link his territories in the east with those in the
west. 
Having drawn up a plan for the city itself, Alexander left others to build it for
him. He would never return to see it completed. (For more on how the city
turned out, see Chapter 12.) Never one to stop when he had a good thing
going, Alexander went on to found many other Alexandrias on his travels –
possibly as many as 12 spread out over the whole of the Persian Empire and
as far afield as India. Only the original city was referred to purely as
Alexandria; the rest were given a second name that emphasised their location
such as ‘Alexandria in the Caucuses’.
Hunting Down Darius 
With fun time in Egypt over, Alexander returned to the hunt for Darius, and a
final showdown loomed. Alexander headed west, and by the end of
September 331 BC, he and his troops (around 40,000 men) were into the
heartlands of Mesopotamia.

Going into the Battle of Gaugamela 
Darius’s and Alexander’s armies met on the plain of Gaugamela in 331 BC.
Darius had spent the two years since the battle of Issus building up his army.
The Persians took the field with a force of well over 100,000 men and proba-
bly 15 elephants. Some sources quote up to 250,000 Persian combatants!
However, such a big force faced the familiar problems of communication,
commitment, and training that I mention in the section ‘Popping In on the
Persian Empire’.
The film Alexander (2004) features a brilliant depiction of the Battle of
Gaugamela in all its bloody brutality. Even better though is the scene of the
evening before the battle where Alexander and his generals discuss the tac-
tics that they’ll use the next day. That’s exactly what they would’ve been
doing in 331 BC.
Darius chose the spot for the showdown with Alexander with great care. In
fact, he levelled out the ground so he could use his chariots. Alexander used
his troops in a wedge formation. His plan was to follow a similar attack as at
Issus and use the cavalry punch tactic. For this tactic, Alexander and the
Companions rode a long way to the right of the battlefield, forcing the Persians
on their left to follow. Suddenly turning back left, the Macedonians charged at
the weaker Persian line, and after fierce fighting they broke through. 
While this was going on, the Macedonian left was desperately holding on
against the huge Persian numbers. Alexander led a charge toward Darius, and
even went as far as throwing a javelin that just missed the Persian king. 
Darius turned and fled again taking only a tiny fraction of his army with him.
Alexander was unable to chase him because the Persians had broken through
against the Macedonian left, and Alexander and his Companions had to
return to support. However, as soon as news of Darius’s flight spread, the
Persian army followed. 
Alexander had won an amazing victory against overwhelming odds. Darius
was still alive – but on the run with no army. There was effectively nobody to
pull together an organised response and challenge Alexander’s supremacy
and he and his victorious troops moved south to the city of Babylon.
Meanwhile, back at home . . .
While Alexander was away, various things were going on back in Greece and
Macedonia. Alexander had left the general Antipater in charge while he was
away. As you may expect, Antipater was very, very busy putting down upris-
ings from the Greek city-states. Even less surprisingly, Sparta, under King Agis,
was the city-state that caused most of the trouble (see Chapters 5 and 8). 
146
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Things came to a head in the Battle of Megalopolis in 331 BC where Antipater
crushed Sparta and her allies. King Agis died in the battle, and it was the last
revolt against Macedonian control. 
Moving on to Babylon
To the victor goes the spoils. With Darius defeated at Gaugamela (see the ear-
lier section ‘Going into the Battle of Gaugamela’), Alexander was free to take
possession of the major cities of the Persian Empire: Babylon, Susa, and
Persepolis. 
Alexander was welcomed into Babylon as the new Persian king and immedi-
ately took possession of its wealth, its palaces and, among other things,
Darius’s harem. 
The incredible wealth and opulence of Babylon must’ve amazed the
Macedonians. It was the biggest city that any of them had ever seen. Plutarch
describes Alexander’s own reaction to the city’s riches:
[Alexander] observed the magnificence of the dining-couches, the 
tables and the banquet which had been set out for him. He turned to his
companions and remarked, ‘So this, it seems, is what it is to be a king.’
Pressing further east
By the summer of 330 BC, Alexander had a decision to make: Stay in Babylon
and be content to rule his new empire from a glorious city or go farther?
Unsurprisingly, he went for the latter option. His excuse was that he needed
to hunt down Darius because, while Darius lived, Alexander wasn’t the true
king of Persia.
147
Chapter 11: Crowning the Undefeated Champion of the World: Alexander the Great
Burning down the house
Alexander’s visit to the ancient religious capital
of Persepolis in 330 BC was less successful
than his time spent in Babylon. During an
evening of heavy drinking, the story goes that a
conversation began about the fact that the
Persian king Xerxes (who built the palace that
Alexander and his men were in) had burned the
temples of Greece when the Persians attacked
250 years before. In revenge, Alexander set fire
to the Persepolis palace. Apparently, the fol-
lowing morning he was very sorry. Whether or
not the story is completely true isn’t certain, but
the palace was certainly damaged by a huge
fire at that time and it seems like the sort of
impulsive thing that Alexander would’ve done.

In fact, Darius was hunted down quite quickly; some of his own supporters
had already killed him but Alexander wasn’t aware of it until some scouts
from his army found the body of the Persian king unceremoniously dumped
onto a cart. Nevertheless, Alexander spent the next three years tearing
around the mountainous regions of Bactria and Sogdiana in the north-east of
the Persian Empire subduing every tribe he encountered. It was hard work,
fighting guerrilla battles against fast-moving enemies in mountainous terrain.
Going Persian
Alexander experienced another difficulty during this time. Now that he was
Persian king, he began to adopt certain Persian customs that his Macedonian
comrades found difficult to accept. 
For example, Alexander began wearing trousers and make-up – both unusual
practices for Macedonians. But the custom that caused the most fuss was
proskynesis. This traditional Persian practice required all those who met and
addressed the great king to prostrate themselves before him. Although
Alexander didn’t ask it of them, the old generals who fought with Philip II
found this new and foreign practice difficult to accept.
Unhappy campers
The mood in the Macedonian camp was further soured by the deaths of two
notable Companions – Parmenion and Cleitus. (See Chapter 10 for more on
the Companions.) Parmenion was killed on the orders of Alexander after an
alleged plot involving Parmenion’s son Philotas, and Alexander killed Cleitus
after a drunken argument about, of all things, proskynesis.
Camaraderie had been a vital strength of the Macedonian army and culture;
now it was beginning to break apart.
Taking a new queen 
Alexander made another surprising decision in 327 BC. After defeating the
tribal chief Oxyartes in Sogdiana, he married Oxyartes’s daughter Roxanne.
The sexuality of Alexander the Great continues to fascinate people to this
day. In modern terms he was probably bisexual. Alexander’s relationship with
his companion Hephaestion was probably sexual, and several historical writ-
ers such as his biographer Plutarch said that he also loved a Persian eunuch
called Bagoas. This relationship features in the film Alexander (2004) and
caused a furore in the final edit when much of it was cut. It’s worth seeing
Alexander Revisited (2007), Oliver Stone’s second ‘cut’ of the film that
restores much lost material.
148
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires

Alexander probably did find women attractive too, but it seems likely that he
married Roxanne mostly because he felt it was time to father an heir to his
new empire. 
Alexander took a second wife, Statira, the daughter of Darius, when he
returned to Babylon in 324 BC. Neither marriage was a love match, but some
ancient writers allege that he took many mistresses over the course of his life.
Making a passage to India
In 327 BC, Alexander went farther than any Greek had before – through the
Hindu Kush and into India itself. In doing so, he followed in the footsteps of
the mythological figures Heracles and Dionysus who were said to have trav-
elled there (see Chapter 21). Alexander was travelling toward what he
believed was the edge of the world. 
Having entered India, Alexander made his way to the Hydaspes (now Jhelum)
River in 326 BC. He fought a furious and very difficult battle with the local king
Porus, which involved his troops tackling jungle warfare for the first time. 
The battle was a real struggle with great losses on both sides. (The elephants
got scared and ran amok, killing scores of Porus’s own men.) But Alexander
was very impressed with how bravely Porus had fought. As a result, he made
Porus governor of his new province of India!
Suffering a defeat – and returning home
Alexander planned to go even farther across the Indian desert, toward the
Ganges River and from there to the edge of the world (see the nearby sidebar
‘To the end of the world and back again’). But he suffered a revolt from his
own troops who refused to go any farther. 
149
Chapter 11: Crowning the Undefeated Champion of the World: Alexander the Great
To the end of the world and back again
Some historians believe that Alexander planned
to march through India to what he thought was
the edge of the world and then build a fleet.
Using this, he would then sail back around the
‘bottom’ of the world (where India was joined to
Ethiopia), find the source of the Nile, and then
travel back up it to Alexandria! 
It was a brilliant and fantastical idea on
Alexander’s part – but the geography was all
wrong. Regardless of the seriousness of this
plan, Alexander and the Greeks didn’t know that
China lay beyond India. But that was just the
first of their problems. . . .

By 325 BC, Alexander had been on campaign for nearly ten years, and many
of the men in his infantry had served with Philip II for many years before
that. These men were absolutely exhausted from fighting. Reluctantly,
Alexander agreed to their demands.
The journey home was incredibly arduous. Alexander sent part of his army
back to Persia along the land route that they had travelled a few years earlier.
He also used the huge amount of timber available to construct a new fleet.
With this, he sailed down the Indus River to its mouth in the Indian Ocean. To
Alexander, this was the southern edge of the world. 
Alexander then led the rest of his troops in a march across the Gedrosian
desert. It was an appalling journey with terrible heat and a lack of food.
Thousands of men and all the pack animals died before they eventually met
up with the fleet, under Nearchus, on the Persian Gulf.
Returning to Babylon and 
Ruling the Empire
On his return to Babylon in 324 BC, Alexander set about ruling the empire he
had created. He was now technically the ruler of Macedonia, Egypt, all the
territories in the Persian Empire, and western India, and he was commander
of all the Greeks. 
Of course, such a massive area proved impossible to manage. News regularly
came to his court of corrupt practices among the governors that he
appointed as well as revolts by the tribes in Bactria and Sogdiana.
Creating a new master race
Alexander seems to have been well aware of the wider problems associated
with ruling such a large empire. For some time he’d been incorporating young
Persian men into his army and training them as replacements in the phalanx
for some of his father’s veterans who’d retired. After he was back in Babylon,
he took this training a stage further.
Various cities that Alexander had founded from Egypt to India were already
filled with a mixture of European (Greek/Macedonian) and Asiatic (Egyptian/
Persian/Indian) settlers. Alexander now decided to try and settle some
Asiatics in Greece and Macedonia.

Getting hitched
To realise his plans, he arranged marriages between almost the whole of his
Macedonian high command and aristocratic Persian brides. Alexander him-
self married Statira, the daughter of Darius III. Following Alexander’s lead, up
to 10,000 Macedonian soldiers took Persian brides. 
Plutarch describes the massive, magnificent joint wedding, which cost a 
fortune and certainly would’ve made the pages of Hello! these days! 
We are told that 9,000 guests attended this feast and each of them was given
a gold cup for their libations. The whole entertainment was carried out on a
grand-scale and Alexander went as far as to discharge [pay off] the debts
owed by any of his guests: the outlay for the occasion amounted to 9,870
talents.
To put this in perspective, the total cost of the wedding festivities was equiv-
alent to 97,536 kilograms of gold. Even Elton John may struggle to match that!
Boyz 2 men
Alexander had also recruited the best part of 30,000 young Persian boys
when he visited Babylon in 331 BC. These males had spent the six years that
Alexander was away being trained and educated in the fashion of Alexander
and his Companions (see Chapter 10), and they were now ready to become
the bulk of Alexander’s expedition army. 
Historical accounts indicate that Alexander planned future campaigns to
Arabia (in the south) and even possibly to the western Mediterranean. These
men would have made up his new army.
Contemplating the death of a god
Despite the great festivities and exciting new plans, Alexander’s time in
Babylon wasn’t happy. He was constantly dealing with unrest and revolt in
the empire and his loyal Macedonians reacted badly to the new Persian
recruits. The death of Hephaestion in early 323 BC left Alexander stricken
with grief, and he held a suitably lavish funeral with a 30-metre high pyre.
In June of 323 BC, Alexander was about to leave for his expedition to Arabia
when, following a banquet to honour one of his Companions, Nearchus, he
fell ill. He struggled against a high fever for a week before becoming bedrid-
den. Finally, on 13th June 323 BC, Alexander died. He was 32 years old.
151

Alexander’s life and activities brought the world to a very different place by
the time of his death:
 The traditional powers of Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and even the Persian
Empire had lost their dominance. 
 The continents of Europe and Asia were closer together than ever
before. The old barriers between the Greek world and the Persian
Empire never really existed again.
 The Mediterranean world was left in the hands of Alexander’s former
generals who carried out a vicious struggle for power. Chapter 12 looks
at this Hellenistic world, as it became known.
 Almost every other dictator that’s followed, from Julius Caesar to
Napoleon, has regarded Alexander as a role model. 
These were impressive accomplishments indeed for a mere ten years in
power. In the words of the Greek general Arrian:
Anyone who belittles Alexander has no right to do so . . . But let such a
person, if blackguard [berate or criticise] Alexander he must, first compare
himself with the object of his abuse: himself, so mean and obscure, and,
confronting him, the great king, with his unparalleled worldly success, the
undisputed monarch of two continents, who spread the power of his name
all over the earth.
152
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Death – or murder?
Alexander’s death – by catching a fever and
then dying – wasn’t unusual. Alexander’s com-
panion Hephaestion died of something similar
only a few weeks before. Yet rumours persist
that Alexander was murdered, and several
recent books have been written on exactly this
subject. These books point to the unhappiness
of the Macedonians at Alexander adopting
‘Persian behaviour’ (see the section ‘Going
Persian’), and his troops’ unwillingness to go on
another campaign now that they were fantasti-
cally wealthy in Babylon.
Others argue that Alexander had suffered a
severe chest wound during one of his last bat-
tles in India. The effects of this wound, coupled
with the march across the Gedrosian desert
shortly afterwards, would have been severe.
It seems quite appropriate that a life so full of
myth, adventure, and amazing tales should
finish with death in mysterious circumstances.
I still can’t decide whether Alexander was mur-
dered or not. What do you think?

In This Chapter
 Wrestling for power after Alexander the Great
 Feuding among the Hellenistic kingdoms
 Engaging with the Roman Empire
 Leaving a lasting legacy
A
ncient Greece was never the same again after the death of Alexander 
the Great. In fact, historians call the period of Alexander’s life (356 to
323 BC) until about 150 BC the Hellenistic period (meaning ‘relating to Greece’)
because of the spread of Greek influence around the Mediterranean that hap-
pened as a result of Alexander’s travelling (see Chapter 11 for all the details)
and the population movements that followed. Notably, the various cities
named Alexandria that Alexander founded put the Greeks in positions of
power throughout the Mediterranean world and far beyond. But as this chap-
ter explains, this prominence didn’t last. Within 150 years the Greek world was
effectively under the control of the Roman Empire, and that’s why this period
of ancient Greek history doesn’t get as much space in this book as other 
periods do.
Still, the Hellenistic period is full of characters and events that are well worth
looking into. After all, don’t you want to know how the story of ancient
Greece ends? Read on.
Having a Bad Heir Day: 
Alexander’s Successors
Alexander the Great was very good at many things (see Chapter 11), but
detailed planning for the future wasn’t one of them. When he died in June 323
BC, he hadn’t clearly stated whom he wanted to act as his successor. 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The situation was complex: 
 Alexander left at least one child from his marriage to Roxanne, and
Alexander’s mother Olympias still lived (see Chapter 11) – but neither of
these women had any hope of taking over the empire because they
didn’t command the respect of the army and any successor would have
to fight to protect their position. 
 Alexander and Roxanne’s small boy was named Alexander IV and was
born shortly after his father’s death. 
 Alexander also left a half-brother in Babylon, one of Philip II’s other 
children (see Chapter 10). Known as Philip III, this half-brother was an
unfortunate man who suffered from severe mental disabilities and lived
in an almost childlike state.
Auctioning off an empire
Because none of Alexander’s closest relatives were capable of ruling the vast
territory that he acquired during his life, a regent was required and there was
precedent for this in Macedonian tradition. The general Perdiccas (one of
Alexander’s ‘Companions’) took the job and the rest of Alexander’s generals
divided up the empire between them. 
Before long, Perdiccas was murdered along with several others. Eventually,
the empire was divided up into five parts and leaders assigned:
 Asia Minor: 
Antigonus
 Egypt:
Ptolemy
 Eastern territories:
Seleucus
 Macedonia and Greece:
Antipater
 Thrace:
Lysimachus
Although these territories changed hands regularly over the next century or
so, they effectively made up what became known as the Hellenistic kingdoms.
See the section ‘Raising Hell: The Hellenistic Kingdoms’ for more information. 
Revolting (again) in southern Greece
Here’s a real shocker: Virtually as soon as Alexander had died, the southern
Greeks revolted against Macedonia. Athens formed part of the revolt, and the
movement was initially quite successful.

In late 323 BC, Antipater, the Macedonian in charge of the region, marched
south to meet the Greek allies and was initially forced back and besieged in
the town of Lamia. However, by the summer of 322 BC, Macedonian reinforce-
ments arrived, and Antipater was able to take on the Greek allies in a pitched
battle near the town of Krannon. The Macedonian victory wasn’t crushing,
but the Greeks were forced to make terms – because they couldn’t agree
among themselves how to continue the war!
Ending democracy in Athens (322 BC)
If you’ve read any of the preceding chapters, you won’t be surprised to find
out that Antipater had to arrange peace terms separately with each city
because none of the Greek allies trusted the others enough to negotiate a
general peace.
As part of Antipater’s peace settlement, the Athenians were required to
house a Macedonian garrison that supervised a new government run by
Athenian aristocrats who the Macedonians had hand-picked. 
The unpleasant squabbling after the revolt and during the peace process
brought democracy in Athens to an end. Nearly 200 years of democratic rule –
one of ancient Greece’s greatest achievements – was over, as was Athens’s
role as a military power.

Chapter 12: What Happened Next?
Ptolemy the body snatcher!
Ptolemy, the leader of Egypt, managed to secure
his own kingdom following the death of
Alexander. Alexander’s body rested in Babylon
for a while until the transfer to Macedonia
began. The body travelled in state in a massive
mobile tomb known as a ‘catafalque’. It was
about 13 feet wide by 20 feet long and con-
structed like a mini Ionic temple (see Chap-
ter 18) with full decoration in gold and marble.
As the tomb moved through Syria, Ptolemy 
and his men took control of it and transported 
it to Memphis in Egypt. After Ptolemy and
Alexander’s body arrived, Ptolemy kicked 
out the satrap appointed by Alexander and
declared himself ruler. Ptolemy later moved to
Alexandria to supervise the city’s completion
and installed Alexander’s body in a permanent
mausoleum in Alexandria. Body snatching – so
much simpler than negotiation, don’t you think? 
Alexander’s tomb has now been lost and debate
continues to this day about where it might be
located.

Raising Hell: The Hellenistic Kingdoms
After the final blow to Athens, the newly established Hellenistic kingdoms
(see Figure 12-1) spent about 170 years bashing each other in the hope of
making some territorial gains. Nothing much ever really changed and any
gains that were made were usually lost fairly soon afterwards. 
Developing dynastic struggles
The Hellenistic kingdoms were all individually powerful, but none was power-
ful enough to dominate the others. Throughout the third century BC the sons
of Alexander’s generals fought with each other for territorial gains through-
out the Mediterranean. This squabbling was very similar to the way that
Greek city-states had continually fought each other throughout the century
before (refer to Chapter 9).
One thing that the Hellenistic rulers did manage to achieve was the creation
of dynasties that saw their descendants running the various kingdoms. 
The dynastic tradition was particularly true of Ptolemaic Egypt where
descendants of Alexander’s commander ruled all the way until Cleopatra
(along with Mark Antony) was defeated at the battle of Actium in 31 BC. See
the section ‘Attending the greatest show on earth: Alexandria’ for more on
the exploits of Ptolemaic Egypt.

Laying siege on Rhodes: Demetrius 
One of the more interesting successors to Alexander was Demetrius, the son
of Antigonus who ruled in Asia Minor. Demetrius was known as Poliorcetes or
‘The Besieger’, although he seems to have spent more of his time eating and
getting drunk. 
In 304 BC, Demetrius laid siege to the island of Rhodes in a bid to expand his
territory. Demetrius’s main tactic was to build a massive siege tower called
Helepolis, which was as close as the Greeks got to developing a tank. This
contraption was 43 metres (140 feet) high and made up of nine storeys. Each
storey contained catapults and other siege machinery operated by hundreds
of men. For protection, Helepolis was covered with iron plates on three sides.
Weighing around 150 tons, it needed more than 3,000 specially trained men to
pull it. 
Impressive, huh? Well, the only problem was, it didn’t work. The citizens of
Rhodes resisted the siege, and Demetrius left the Helepolis behind along with
all his other siege equipment when he sailed home. The people of Rhodes 
celebrated Demetrius’s retreat by melting down the Helepolis and using it to
build the famous statue known as the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the original
Seven Wonders of the World (and covered in Chapter 18). A much more prof-
itable end to a bad idea. You can read more about Demetrius in Chapter 26.
The activities of Demetrius are a good example of what the Hellenistic period
was like. Demetrius had no real reason to attack Rhodes other than empire
building. Treaties proved meaningless as successive generations broke them
and carried on fighting. 
Attending the greatest show 
on earth: Alexandria
For all the fighting that went on throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms,
Ptolemaic Egypt was relatively stable, and the new city of Alexandria thrived
as a result. 
City planning panache
Alexandria was ideally placed to gather the revenues from trade all across
the Mediterranean, and Egypt itself was hugely wealthy due to the fertile
lands surrounding the Nile. The Ancient Egyptians For Dummies (Wiley) by
Charlotte Booth offers more insight into this exceptional city.

Alexandria was unusual because it was built from scratch to a definite plan
for the location and design of all the major public buildings. A huge amount
of money was spent on a large earth work that helped to form a double har-
bour and the construction of the mighty pharos (lighthouse) that dominated
the skyline.
Checking out the library
One of the most famous public buildings in Alexandria was the library . The
library was actually part of the museum of Alexandria. For the ancient
Greeks, a museum was literally ‘a sanctuary of the muses’. (The muses were
Greek goddesses associated with all areas of learning; see Chapter 20 for
more on these lovely ladies.)
The library of Alexandria was founded by Ptolemy and thrived throughout
the Ptolemaic period. It became the new centre of learning in the
Mediterranean, replacing Athens in the process. Scholars travelled from all
around to work and study there. Historians believe that at its height it con-
tained 500,000 scrolls, which catalogued nearly everything that had ever
been written in the Greek language at the time.
The library flourished throughout the Hellenistic period and beyond until it
suffered a terrible fire in 47 BC when Julius Caesar was laying siege to the
city. Several Roman emperors subsequently lavished money and attention on
the library and attempted to replace its stock, but it may have been finally
destroyed during the Byzantine period when the emperor Theodosius
demanded the destruction of all pagan temples in AD 391.
The museum and library weren’t just about preserving things, but also 
about new discoveries. The Hellenistic period saw breakthroughs in science
(see Chapter 26) and a new, more realistic style in art and sculpture (see
Chapter 18). This new community also saw great developments in literature
and distinctive poetry produced by men like Apollonius of Rhodes and
Theocritus. 
158
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
A gift that keeps on giving
The library at Alexandria is hugely important to
historians today because the work begun cen-
turies ago to catalogue and preserve texts
started a tradition that has carried on through
the medieval period and the Renaissance. This
tradition is solely responsible for the fact that
you and I can still read the works of Homer,
Sophocles, Thucydides, and others – and that
I’m able to write a book like this. Thanks,

A cosmopolitan metropolis
One of the other great new developments in Alexandria was the cosmopolitan
nature of its population. Alexandria’s new ruling class was Greek and
Macedonian, but many other people came to live there. 
In this way, Alexandria was rather different to the other major cities of the
Greek world. In Athens and Sparta, for example, citizenship and the right to
reside were zealously guarded. Alexandria was much more the kind of city
that Rome became later, a large metropolis with a real cosmopolitan feel
where people came from far and wide to live and work. 
The Greek historian Polybius became a Roman citizen and was sent as an
envoy to Alexandria in 180 BC. Here he describes the city’s population:
It is inhabited by three classes of people: first the native Egyptians, a volatile
group, hard to control; secondly by the mercenaries [foreign soldiers from
all over the Mediterranean resident in the city]; thirdly there are the
Alexandrians themselves, a people not genuinely 
civilised . . . for though they are mixed they come from a Greek stock and
have not forgotten Greek customs.
Clearly, the cosmopolitan city wasn’t to Polybius’s taste! Alexandria must
have been an amazing place to be, because despite the multinational feel the
city was very firmly under the control of its Ptolemaic rulers.
Fading Away: The End of Ancient Greece
Greek influence on the Mediterranean during the Hellenistic period had never
been stronger. But ironically, this period was exactly the same time that the
Greek world began to lose its independence and get swallowed up by the
emerging Roman Empire.
Meeting the Romans
The Roman Empire was the successor to the Greek world and carried on 
for the best part of 650 years. The Romans themselves came from what was
originally a small market town in Umbria that, according to myths, was 
originally populated by criminals and runaway slaves. By the third century
BC the Romans had come to dominate the whole of Italy and were at war with
the mighty Carthaginian civilisation based at Carthage in north Africa.

Although Rome’s rise was all going on in the western Mediterranean, the
Greek world felt the impact through the Roman conquest of Sicily in 241 BC.
It wasn’t long before the Romans began to look east.
Tangling with the Romans: 
Pyrrhus of Epirus
One of the first contacts between Greece and Rome came at the beginning of
the third century BC. The Romans were beginning to expand their interests
and the people of Tarentum in southern Italy appealed for help against them. 
Their appeal was answered by Pyrrhus, an aristocrat originally from Epirus.
Pyrrhus was the joint ruler of Macedonia after driving out Demetrius (of
Helepolis fame) – see the earlier section ‘Laying siege on Rhodes: Demetrius’.
But Pyrrhus had then been forced out by his co-ruler Lysimachus.
As something of a military adventurer, Pyrrhus was happy to try and 
further his ambitions in the west, and he landed at Tarentum in 282 BC. He
brought a large army with him, including traditional Macedonian infantry
with sarissas and about 30 elephants. Over the next three years, he fought 
a series of campaigns against Rome, heavily defeating the Romans on 
several occasions.
The problem that Pyrrhus faced was that every time he won a victory, the
Romans, with all their available reinforcements, came back stronger, but
Pyrrhus’s own forces diminished. Despite his victories, Pyrrhus eventually
lost the war, leaving to fight in Sicily in 278 BC. 
His campaigns are the source of the modern expression ‘a pyrrhic victory’ –
winning the battle but not the war.
160
Part II: Athens to Alexander: The Rise and Fall of Empires 
Death by old lady
Pyrrhus carried on his life of adventure, and by
272 BC he was fighting in Argos. During a street
battle an old woman standing on the roof of her
house saw Pyrrhus attack her son. She picked
up a tile from the roof and flung it at him. It
knocked him unconscious and he fell from his
horse and was killed in the melee. Quite an
appropriate end to the life of somebody who
was characterised by heroic failure.

Clashing cultures: The Battle 
of Cynoscephalae
In 197 BC, the Macedonian king Philip V (no relation to Philip II) became
engaged with the Romans. Philip was a bit of a chancer and had spent many
years fighting small territorial wars against his Hellenistic counterparts.
However, in 197 BC, Philip bit off more than he could chew. 
During the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage (218 to 201 BC),
Philip supported the Carthaginians and thus made himself an enemy 
of Rome.
The Romans used their friendship with Ptolemaic Egypt (see the section
‘Developing dynastic struggles’) as a reason to attack because Philip had
recently helped the Seleucid king Antiochus against them. The Romans 
sailed across the Adriatic Sea and met Philip’s forces at Cynoscephalae in
Thessaly. 
The battle was a real test of military strategies with new, lightly armed, and
mobile Roman legions set against the formidable and old school Macedonian
phalanx. In the end, the Romans won the day. They surrounded the relatively
slow-moving Macedonian phalanx. When the Macedonians lifted their pikes
in surrender, the Romans failed to understand the gesture and cut them
down. Philip’s army was destroyed, and his allies fled.
Becoming a Roman province 
Commitments elsewhere meant the Romans were unable to finish the job
they began against Philip V, but in 168 BC, they defeated the Macedonians
again at Pydna. This time there was no coming back. 
Roman forces split Macedonia into four tribal republics and placed a Roman
governor in control in each region. After further trouble, the republics were
eventually done away with in 146 BC. The country that had produced Philip II
and Alexander the Great was made a Roman province.
Generally, the Romans were quite content to allow the Greek cities to rule
themselves. The Roman governor in Macedonia kept an eye on things and 
(as ever!) the Greek cities were too busy squabbling among themselves to
ever mount a serious threat against the Romans.

The last Greek hurrah
Following the Roman annexation of Macedonia in 146 BC, several Greek 
cities formed a coalition called the Achaean Confederacy, which rose up in
revolt again Rome. Of course, the gesture was futile. The small army that 
the confederacy mustered never stood a chance against the professional
Roman army. The confederacy was easily defeated and the city of Corinth
destroyed in the process.
After the revolt, Rome more closely monitored the Greek cities from
Macedonia, and in some cases, Roman garrisons were installed. Finally, in 
46 BC a large part of southern Greece turned into the Roman province of
Achaia. The ancient Greeks never really ruled themselves again.
Living On: Rome and Beyond 
Although the Greeks as a powerful entity were no more by 46 BC, Greek 
civilisation thrived for hundreds of years after. The Romans and subsequent
civilisations adopted many elements of Greek life:
 The Roman gods were broadly similar to Greek gods, even though they
had different names.
 Greek art, architecture, literature, philosophy, and all manner of other
elements of Greek society were incorporated into Roman and Byzantine
life, and then rediscovered and reintegrated into Europe during the
Renaissance.
Even today you’re reading a book about the ancient Greeks. So the Greeks
never really went away; they just stopped existing in Greece!

Chapter 13
Out in the Fields: Farming,
Herding, and Travelling
In This Chapter
 Farming and winemaking 
 Herding livestock
 Getting around in ancient Greece by land and sea
T
hroughout its 2,000-year history, ancient Greece was an agrarian society,
which means huge numbers of people spent nearly every day working
the soil or tending livestock. Most Greek towns and cities started off as 
farming communities, and many of them remained so throughout the entire
ancient Greek period. Many Greeks were involved in industry or trade (see
Chapters 14 and 15 for more on city life), but the vast majority of people
derived their income and kept themselves alive by what they and their 
animals produced.
In this chapter, I discuss what was involved in making a living from the land. 
I also look at how the Greeks travelled and transported things by land and
sea. As you may guess, living a successful life – in the seemingly idyllic Greek
countryside – demanded a lot of very hard work!
Scratching a Living
Working the land was tough in the ancient world. People worked from the
moment that the sun was up until it set. In the Mediterranean, this schedule
meant a 14-hour day most of the time – and they didn’t even have weekends
to look forward to for time off (although they did have a lot of festivals and
public holidays).
The typical ancient Greek farmer worked a relatively small patch of land; a
house with perhaps two or three acres that would usually have been in his
family for generations. 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Richer farmers owned estates that incorporated several pieces of land, some-
times in various locations. Larger farms used slaves and serfs. Serfs were paid
workers tied to working on the estate, which was also their accommodation. 
Working a farm was exceptionally hard work, and people were only a bad
storm or a dry season away from ruin. Furthermore, if a man was called up
for military service (see Chapter 5) and his relatives were unable to manage
the farm during his absence, he could lose everything. 
Growing crops
The basic farming traditions in ancient Greece were similar to those every-
where else in the Mediterranean at the time and they hadn’t changed for a
very long time. Specifically:
 Nearly all smallholding farmers grew two basic staple crops, which were
the mainstays of the Greek diet:
• Wheat: The most common type of wheat was basic emmer wheat,
also known as farro wheat. Farmers grew other types of wheat 
elsewhere in the Mediterranean, and these crops were sometimes
exported abroad. Wheat was ground and made into bread.
• Barley: Barley was a lower grade wheat alternative that was easier
to grow and was turned into a hard bread or small cakes. Generally
speaking, poorer people ate barley bread because the better lands
(worked by the wealthier farmers) could grow wheat rather than
barley. Barley was also grown a lot in Egypt where it was used to
make beer (the Greeks didn’t drink beer).
 Greek farmers also grew grapes (see the later section ‘Growing grapes
and making wine’), olives, and vegetables (mainly pulses and beans).
 Farmers grew crops using dry farming methods, meaning that they were
able to grow without irrigation. This was very important because of the
relatively low rainfall in Greece. See the section ‘Working the land’ for
more info.
The ancient Greeks had no knowledge of wet-farming (using irrigation)
techniques used to grow crops such as rice. However, wet-farming was
practised in the near east from as early as 1500 BC, and Alexander the
Great and his men probably passed through rice fields on their travels.
 Farmers usually sowed crops in autumn (September in modern terms)
because the rainy season in Greece was between autumn and spring.
This schedule meant that the summer was usually festival time for 
celebrating the harvest (June/July). The harvest needed to be success-
ful, too, because it had to sustain the farmers all the way through until
next summer.
Chapter 15 discusses more exotic foods and meal preparation.

Honouring Demeter, the 
friend of the farmer
Several of the Greek gods had associations with farming and fertility, but 
the most relevant one was the goddess Demeter. Her main association was
with wheat, and her name effectively means ‘god-mother’. In myth she had 
a daughter called Persephone, and mother and daughter became known as
‘the two goddesses’ or sometimes ‘the Holy Twain’. 
The ancient Greek religious calendar was closely aligned with the farming
year, so most celebrations of Demeter coincided with ploughing or harvest-
ing. One of the most famous celebrations was the Thesmophoria, which
occurred during sowing time. The festival was for women only; men were
strictly banned from it (Chapter 21 has more details). This exclusivity was
due to the fact that the Greeks saw fertility on the farm as being closely
related to a woman’s capacity for child bearing. This rationale is also part 
of the reason why Demeter was called ‘god-mother’. For more on ancient
Greek religious customs, see Chapter 22.
Working the land 
The techniques used to work the land in ancient Greece were fairly straight-
forward. If they were able, farmers used the traditional method of ‘half 
and half’, which involved ploughing and working half their land every year
while leaving the other half fallow, or unused. The following year the farmer
worked the other portion, so some land always got a break and the soil was
able to replenish its natural nutrients. 
167
Chapter 13: Out in the Fields: Farming, Herding, and Travelling
Going underground: Persephone and Demeter
The myth of Persephone is an interesting story.
The daughter of Zeus and Demeter, she was
chosen by Hades (the god of the dead) to be his
wife. This meant that she was taken from the
living to the underworld where Hades lived.
Demeter was shocked by her daughter’s disap-
pearance and searched the world for her, with-
holding her blessings from men. This turned the
world barren and caused widespread famine.
Eventually she discovered where Persephone
was and whisked her away from Hades’s
clutches. However, Zeus ruled that Persephone
would have to spend six months of the year with
Hades and six with her mother. The Greeks
interpreted this as the reason why the world is
cold during autumn and winter when
Persephone is in the underworld, and warm in
spring and summer when she’s returned. This is
a great example of a myth being used to explain
a natural phenomenon.

Unfortunately, some smallholders weren’t able to rotate their field because
they needed to work every scrap of land. Over time their soil became less
and less fertile.
Ploughing
Given the crops the Greeks were growing (see the section ‘Growing crops’),
ploughing was a major farming activity. The methods for ploughing were 
very straightforward:
 On bigger farms, two oxen pulled a simple wooden plough. Sometimes
the implement was tipped with iron to allow for more accurate ploughing.
 On smaller farms, ploughing was done by hand, which was back-
breaking work. This form of ploughing didn’t generally turn the soil, 
only broke it to allow for planting.
Sowing and growing
Similarly, sowing would have been done mostly by hand although on larger
estates the number of serfs meant that the work was more evenly spread 
out. On a small farm the whole family would have been involved.
As I mentioned, the Greeks were dry farmers so watering and irrigation
weren’t really an issue. They did use manure and most farms would have 
had an evil-smelling dung heap that it was wise to steer clear of.
Harvesting
After the crops had grown, they were reaped with a simple curved sickle,
heaped in a basket, and taken to be threshed. Farmers carried out threshing –
separating the buds from the main plant – on a threshing floor; a cleared
patch of dry ground. Sometimes they used a sled drawn by animals. Barley
collecting and wheat ‘winnowing’ were typically done by hand with a small
shovel and a basket. Not a fun job.
Crops were stored in small outbuildings. The Greeks had no refrigeration
techniques so things were kept and used for as long as possible until they
eventually spoiled.
Following the herd
Most ancient Greek farm estates weren’t very big, so the majority of farmers
didn’t keep many animals. Grazing land was at a premium, so a few pigs,
sheep, or goats alongside a pair of oxen were all the livestock most farms
supported. 
168
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The type of animals that larger farms kept very much depended on the 
terrain involved. Generally, larger animals, such as cattle and oxen, tended 
to be kept in the north of Greece and Macedonia because these regions were
wetter and more grazing land was available. In the Peloponnese and the
south, sheep and goats were better choices because the land was rockier. 
Goats and sheep were particularly useful to the ancient Greeks because they
were used to produce milk, cheese, wool, and meat – all things that farmers
could trade for other commodities at the market in town. Goats and sheep
were also useful because farmers could sell or use them in sacrifice; healthy,
well-kept animals fetched a very good price for religious purposes.
Hunting high and low
The other method of living off the land was the original one – hunting game.
Hunting was a big part of Greek myth with boar being the most popular
animal for heroes to hunt. Hunting itself was seen as an activity that helped
to sharpen skills for war. These heroes usually hunted with either a spear or
a bow, but everyday hunting was rather different and mostly for game such
as hares using traps and snares. This was often an activity carried out by
young boys.
169
Chapter 13: Out in the Fields: Farming, Herding, and Travelling
Pan: Friend of the farmer – and the soldier?
The Greek god associated with farm life was
Pan. His name means ‘guardian of the flocks’,
and he is always depicted as a young man with
pipes who tends a herd of goats. However,
because he was said to lead a fairly hermit-like
existence, he was also associated with the
unfortunate soldiers who had to perform guard
duty on isolated borders. Several ancient writers
suggest that he appeared in the Athenian ranks
at the battle of Marathon (refer to Chapter 6).
Quite handy to have a god on your side. No
wonder the Athenians won!
The female Hellenistic poet Anyte, who was born
in Tegea in Arcadia, not far from where Pan was
supposed to have come from, writes of Pan:
Why, country Pan, sitting still among the
lonely shades of the thick-set wood, do you
shrill on your sweet reed?
So that the heifers may pasture on these
dewy mountains, cropping the long-haired
heads of the grass.

Boar hunting did go on using hounds and (when done by the rich) on horse-
back in large groups. Boar hunting was still seen as a noble art and one that 
a man of action should be proficient in.
Growing Grapes and Making Wine 
People drank a great deal of wine in ancient Greece. Grapes were relatively
easy to grow because of the climate and soil, so most farms and estates
included some vines. 
Evidence indicates that the forerunners of the ancient Greeks, the
Mycenaeans (see Chapter 2), grew grape vines and made wine, so viticulture
(the growing of grapes to make wine) was fairly well established by the last
millennium BC. 
Despite the region’s long history of wine making, little is known about the
processes, and no books on the subject survive. However, historians do know
that the beverage was usually mixed with water, and the alcohol content
wasn’t as high as with wine today. 
Different varieties of red and white wine were available. Usually, the geogra-
phy and climate of the region dictated what type of grape farmers grew and
the sort of wine they produced. For example, the island of Ceos produced
three specific types:

Farming by the book
Manuals and books about farming weren’t really
available to the ancient Greeks (although they
were developed later in the Roman Empire).
Instead, many Greeks referred to a long poem
first composed by the poet Hesiod around 700 BC
called Works and Days. It’s full of advice in poetic
form for individuals intent on running a farm and
relies on mythological examples of what could
go wrong if farmers didn’t follow Hesiod’s advice.
Hesiod was particularly scathing about whether
or not a farmer needed a wife, suggesting that a
female slave might be better:
First of all you should acquire a house and a
woman and an ox for the plough . . . A
female slave, not a wife, who can follow the
oxen as well.
Hesiod was no great fan of women in general.
Later in the poem, he warns that women are 
not to be trusted as they are likely to want to
‘steal your barn’. Clearly, he just never met the
right woman.

 Austeros: A dry wine
 Glukazon: A sweet wine
 Autokratos: A variety somewhere between the two – a medium-dry, 
if you like.
These varieties from Ceos were established and known all over Greece (see
the sidebar ‘An early marketing effort’), and other cities and regions had 
similar specialties.
Wine was a vital part of Greek life and people drank it for a huge variety of
reasons including religious celebration. See Chapter 15 and also Chapter 20,
where I look at the god associated with wine and generally having a good
time – Dionysus.
Getting Around in Ancient Greece 
Like just about everything else in ancient times, travelling throughout 
ancient Greece was seriously hard work. If you were on dry land, you either
travelled by horse, cart, or your own feet. On water, you had the option of
riding in boats, but these vehicles weren’t plain sailing (see the later section
‘Venturing into Poseidon’s realm: Travelling by sea’). 
The concept of travel for its own sake or of going on holiday wasn’t really 
a part of Greek life. Certainly, only the very rich could’ve afforded the time
away from work, let alone the expense of the journey. Generally speaking, 
the ancient Greeks travelled only if they had to. Traders, for example, were
almost constantly on the move between market towns, buying local produce
and selling it in the next town. 
Occasionally, the ancient Greek people made massive journeys to move and
set up in another place. See Chapters 3 and 4 for more on colonisation in
early Greek history.

‘High on the hill sat a lonely goatherd . . .’
Spending time tending goats day in and day out
may not sound like the most romantic of jobs, but
the occupation became very popular in ancient
Greek art and literature – and beyond. 
The idea of the Greek goatherd – and, in partic-
ular, one pining for a lost love – became a 
traditional feature in classical art and poetry.
Over a thousand years after the ancient Greeks,
the goatherd became popular again, and 
during the Renaissance the idea of ‘pastoral’
was born. Everything from the paintings of Titian
to the Symphony No. 6 ‘Pastoral’ by Beethoven
trace back to the old goatherds of ancient
Greece.

If you were able to afford a horse, riding it or using it to draw a cart was the
preferred mode of transportation throughout ancient Greece. A horse was
expensive – essentially another mouth to feed. Being able to maintain and
equip a horse was a sign that you were financially well off. (Chapter 4 dis-
cusses the social classes in Athens.) Furthermore, riding equipment was 
rudimentary; stirrups didn’t appear in Europe until around the ninth century
AD. Add the lack of decent roads to the situation and you can see how 
difficult riding must have been.
Wild horses were rare in most parts of Greece with the exception of Thessaly,
where large numbers of horses were tamed and bred. The Thessalians
became famous for their formidable cavalry (see Chapter 11).
For those less well off an ass or a donkey was an acceptable substitute.
Unlike finely bred, expensive horses, the life of a donkey wasn’t happy. 
They were worked extremely hard as an all-purpose animal, as this little
poem by Palladas suggests. Palladas was a Greek writing during the Roman
era (around AD 350) but the experience of the donkey would have been
exactly the same even then!
Poor little donkey! It’s no joke being a pedant’s not a rich man’s moke
[donkey] preened in the palace of the alabarch [official in the Jewish
community].
Little donkey, stay, stay with me patiently until the day I get my pay.
Burning sandals 
Most people had no transportation option other than to walk to wherever
they needed to go. Consequently, people tried to limit journeys to when 
they were absolutely necessary.

An early marketing effort
Greeks were very proud of their local vintages
and had an easy system for identifying where
wine came from. Each town had its own slightly
different type of double-headed jug, known as
an amphora, that exclusively held its wines. (In
fact, the people of the island of Ceos were so
proud of their wine that they used the symbol of
their amphora on their coinage.) The distinctive
shapes have been extremely helpful to archae-
ologists trying to work out where various pieces
of unearthed pottery originally came from.

A good example of a typical journey was the walk between Athens and the
port at Piraeus, a journey of about 7 kilometres (4 miles). It would take a large
part of the day to walk there and back, but some people made the trip every
day, such as small farmers or people trekking in to attend the jury courts.
Rich Athenian merchants often kept small houses or apartments in the port
for when they needed to conduct business there before returning to their
main home in the city.
Venturing into Poseidon’s 
realm: Travelling by sea
Some journeys were only possible on the ‘Great Green’, as the Egyptians 
and Greeks called the Mediterranean Sea. The Greeks were capable and 
experienced sailors, and Chapters 6 and 7 describe many of their successes
in naval warfare.
The Greek god of the sea was Poseidon (although many other gods and
deities were associated with it). Poseidon was a violent god, and the Greeks
attributed storms, earthquakes, and mishaps at sea to his rage. Making 
offerings to him before a voyage was seen as essential and a wise move upon
returning from a successful trip. 
The following passage from Homer’s Iliad gives a great idea of how the Greeks
viewed Poseidon:
Down Poseidon dove and yoked his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car
. . . skimming the waves, and over the swells they came, dolphins leaving
their lairs to sport across his wake, leaping left and right – well they knew
their lord. And the sea heaved in joy, cleaving a path for him.
Another real danger in sea travel was falling overboard. Most people in
ancient Greece couldn’t swim. Many sailors felt that it was unlucky to learn 
to swim because it tempted fate and caused your vessel to be shipwrecked.
Also, swimming itself wasn’t a leisure activity in the way that it is now. If 
you were a city dweller on a sea voyage and you fell overboard, you had to
hope that one of the crew swam!
Ships for trade and transport
Most military vessels were long, sleek, and powered by oars (see Chapter 5),
but ships used for trade and transport were very different. Generally, they
were much larger with a far greater draft (meaning they sat much lower in 
the water with more of the ship under the waterline) and looked a little 
more rounded. These larger transporters were nearly always powered by 
sail alone. 
173
Chapter 13: Out in the Fields: Farming, Herding, and Travelling
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Sails were made of linen. They were often painted and decorated with designs
indicating where the ship came from or the type of cargo that it was carrying.
With a decent wind behind it, one of these ships could travel at about 7 to 10
kilometres per hour (about 4 to 6 knots).
Although the dimensions and power source of trade ships meant they 
offered far more room for carrying cargo and passengers, the vessels were
also entirely at the mercy of the weather and were also far less manoeuvrable
than their military cousins.
Shipbuilding
The building of ships was a highly skilled trade that was passed down
through families. Great examples of shipbuilding appear in mythology, like
the construction of Jason’s ship the Argo, which Homer’s Odyssey describes
in detail. Amazingly, the construction methods that Homer describes in
around 750 BC were still being used during the Hellenistic period 600 
years later.
The construction method Homer describes is known as the ‘shell first’ tech-
nique, where the ship begins as just a keel on to which planking and other
frames are added later. This method was quite fast; ships could be built 
relatively quickly. Depending on how many people were involved, a ship
could be put together in about a month.
Navigating 
Travel by sea was highly dangerous. The sailing season was usually confined
to between March and October because during the winter months the
weather was too unpredictable. 
The Greeks didn’t have the ability to navigate by using charts, so as much as
possible they stayed close to the coast or used individual islands to judge
distance. Some navigation by the stars was possible on clear nights, but
sailors didn’t rely on this method. 
174
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
Pytheas: Boldly going where 
no Greek had been before
Despite the sea being so perilous, some Greeks
attempted long journeys of discovery. The most
famous of these was a man named Pytheas who
in around 320 BC claimed to have sailed from the
Mediterranean around Spain, into the Atlantic
Ocean, around the British Isles, and even farther
– almost to the Arctic Circle. When he returned
home, he wrote a book about the expedition
called On the Ocean. Nobody believed him at the
time but many modern commentators think he
was telling the truth.

These navigation limitations meant that sailors only really knew a small
number of local journeys and routes because they had to have specialist
knowledge of local currents and how they affected the journey. So if you
wanted to travel between Athens and Asia Minor you had to make a number
of small journeys, hopping between islands, rather than one long trip. 
And you were at the mercy of the trade routes and whether somebody was
going your way.
Fishing
Just like hunting on dry land, fishing was a way of getting food from the sea.
Fishing was an important industry in ancient Greece, although probably not
as big as you may think. Predicting the movements of heavy shoals was very
difficult for Greek fishermen without the aid of modern technology, and the
Mediterranean isn’t as well stocked with fish as the larger oceans.
Most fishing took place close to shore with large nets. (Only the very brave
fished farther out in the open sea due to navigation limitations; see the 
section ‘Navigating’). However, the varieties of fish available in deeper, open
waters were very highly prized and fetched higher prices.
The Greeks loved fish and it was a staple part of the diet for those who could
afford it. For more on fish and how the Greeks ate it, see Chapter 15.

Chapter 13: Out in the Fields: Farming, Herding, and Travelling
The pirates of the Mediterranean
Assuming you survived bad navigation, terrible
storms, drowning, or the wrath of Poseidon, you
also had to watch out for pirates! Piracy was a
big problem with sea travel. The ancient Greek
myths are full of episodes that can be interpreted
as piracy:
 Jason and the Argonauts sail to the Black
Sea and steal the Golden Fleece, an obvious
act of piracy.
 Many of the events in Homer’s Odyssey are
piracy, but they go unpunished and aren’t
criticised.
Pirates thrived because nobody (until Roman
times) was able to crack down on them. Also,
during wars like the Peloponnesian War (see
Chapter 8), telling the difference between an act
of war and an act of piracy was very difficult.
In general, pirates operated on popular trade
routes using hideaways on small islands. The
area around Rhodes (see the map on the Cheat
Sheet) in particular was known to be a hotbed 
of piracy with the five harbours on the island 
providing rich pickings.

In This Chapter
 Organising the Greek household
 Appreciating the role of women 
 Understanding marriage and divorce
 Raising and educating children
 Looking at slaves
P
arts I and II of this book cover some of the most brutal battles in all 
history, but this chapter looks at something you may find just as 
shocking – the everyday interactions of ancient Greek families. So prepare
yourself: Ancient Greek attitudes about women, sex, death, and violence 
were very different to those held today.
This chapter (as well as Chapter 15) looks at what life was like in Greek towns
and cities. For the most part, I concentrate on Athens because it was the
biggest and most successful city at the time, and because of the huge amount
of archaeological and documentary evidence it’s the one that historians know
most about. 
Much of what I describe in this chapter is what you can call social standards.
Ancient Greek social standards were very high, and an awful lot of people did
not – indeed, could not – live up to them the whole time. You discover the
Greeks’ frame of mind and how they viewed the world. In a perfect world
these are the standards that people expected themselves and others to live
up to. However, comic plays and novels from ancient Greece indicate that
people lived their lives far beneath the standards of what was supposedly
acceptable. Think of it this way: Nowadays most people consider speaking
with your mouth full to be rude – but many people still do it!
Appreciating the Household: The Oikos
The oikos was the basic unit of Greek society. In modern terms, oikos would
probably translate to ‘household’, but the word meant much more than just
your home. The oikos included:
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

 The physical building itself (see the following section ‘Touring the 
typical Greek house’).
 The people within it (see the later section ‘Meeting the extended family’).
 All property associated with the family and building.
The Greeks considered the oikos to be one entity, like a very small version of
the polis or ‘state’ (see Chapter 4). Best to keep your hands off another man’s
oikos, or big trouble lay ahead.
Touring the typical Greek house
As Figure 14-1 shows, the average house in an ancient Greek town wasn’t very
big. Floor plans were simple and similar:
 All the rooms opened onto a rectangular courtyard, which featured a
doorway to the street on one side. 
 Each house had a main living room where family members spent most 
of the day.
 A secondary room, called the andron (which literally means the ‘men’s
room’) was used to receive visitors. As the name implies, this room 
was primarily the domain of men. Men slept in quarters adjacent to the
andron.
 Women’s quarters were located elsewhere in the house – usually well
away from the andron, often on the upper level. The women would work
and sleep here.
178
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
An Ithacan’s oikos is his castle
In The Odyssey by Homer, Odysseus is delayed
on his return home to the island of Ithaca from
the war at Troy (see Chapter 21 for more on
Homer). While Odysseus is away, various local
nobles turn up at his house and try to persuade
his wife, Penelope, to marry them, claiming that
her husband is obviously dead. Penelope is 
no doubt very attractive, but what these would-
be suitors really want is Odysseus’s land and
property – his oikos – that come with Penelope’s
hand in marriage.
In the recent TV adaptation of The Odyssey
(2000), Odysseus returns home and kills the suit-
ors who invaded his house. He justifies killing
them by saying, ‘They tried to steal my world.’
That’s a great way of expressing what the oikos
really meant.

The building itself was fairly basic with walls made of mud brick or rubble
and the floors most likely of beaten earth. Houses usually included a ladder
(or an external stairway in wealthier houses) that family members used to
access the roof, which they used as another living space.
A Greek house didn’t have a specific bathroom or kitchen. Cooking would
often be done outside. Washing was done with cold water in the privacy of
the sleeping quarters.
No matter how much money you had, the style of house would be mostly the
same. Luxury was represented by the size of the property and the quality of
decoration or finish. 
Meeting the extended family 
In general, the concept of family was very strong. A lot of people lived within
the small space of a Greek house. In addition to the modern ‘nuclear family’

(man, woman, and probably between two and five children), other relatives
often formed part of the household. Unmarried or widowed females lived
under the protection of their nearest male relatives, and grandmothers,
nieces, and sisters were often legally obliged to seek shelter in an already
busy household. Add to this mix several slaves, and the average household
usually numbered between 9 and 12 people.
But within the family, however, equality didn’t exist. Men were the absolute
rulers, and women had very little status at all.
Kurios: Man about the house
The dominant male in the oikos was its absolute ruler. He was known as the
kurios, which means ‘the man in charge’. The kurios literally had the power 
of life and death over everybody within, including his wife and children. A
man who killed his wife could be legally challenged by her relations but if she
was proved to have been unfaithful he had acted legally. He carried out all
the financial and legal transactions of the oikos. Nobody else interacted with
the oikos in any way without his consent. A husband in a new home would
automatically become kurios and stay in this position until he died, although
in some households the eldest son would take charge if the father became
too old or ill to cope.
Beyond oikos 
Although the oikos itself was an independent unit, the concept of family was
very strong and extended beyond the oikos to other groups:
 The ankhisteia was a wider network of relatives to which Greek 
families belonged. This network usually went as far as second cousins
and comprised people’s wider family. 
If a woman was widowed, her first move was to look for a new husband
within the ankhisteia. This group also played a very big role in the inher-
itance process. Inheritance law was hideously complex but basically 
followed the rule that the nearest male relative inherited. If there wasn’t
an obvious heir then a male relative from the ankhisteia would step in
and marry the widow, so inheriting the property.
 The phratiai were religious associations that are probably best
described as brotherhoods because all the members were male, 
representing their oikos. Although the members may not have all been
related, their families normally had some kind of association through
marriage or business in the past.
Like the oikos, these other associations were very powerful. Men were
expected to give absolute loyalty to them. If a man fell out with either his
ankhisteia or phratiai, he was shunned by the rest and open to attack.
180

With all these loyalties life could become very complicated. A man’s ultimate
loyalty would be to his oikos and then his ankhisteia but the phratiai interests
were strong too because they usually had a strong business or financial 
element. Fortunately the interests of these groups wouldn’t really clash
because they were all representing the same thing – the furtherance of the
oikos and those involved in it on a wider basis. 
Spending Time with the Women 
of Ancient Greece
Ancient Greek women were second-class citizens at best – or even less in
many cities. For example, Athenian women didn’t count as citizens; they 
were instead classed as ‘Women of Attica’ (Attica was the region of eastern
Greece that Athens belonged to). The point was to separate the women from
the city – they were associated with it but not part of its ruling class. 
Women had very little liberty in ancient Greece. They were expected to
spend the vast majority of their time within the oikos (see the section
‘Appreciating the Household: The Oikos’ earlier in the chapter) and were 
discouraged from interacting with anybody else. For example, if male guests
came to the home and visited the andron, women were unlikely to be asked
to join them. In more traditional households if women were invited, they
were required to wear a veil at all times or even to sit behind a screen.
The poet – and marital advice-giver – Hesiod (see Chapter 13) had a bit of a
downer on women. In his long poem Works and Days he’s scathing about the
problems that women can bring:
For a man acquires nothing better than a wife – a good one, but there is
nothing more miserable than a bad one, a parasite, who even if her
husband is strong singes him with the torch and brings him to a raw old age.
The ancient Greeks saw women as something to be controlled and they lim-
ited the type and amount of property a woman could own. For example:
 Women weren’t technically allowed to own property above the value 
of one medimnos of barley, which was about as much as it cost to feed 
a family for a week. 
 Any property that a woman used, like clothes or jewellery, was part of
the oikos and as such belonged to her husband. 
Even when her husband died a woman wouldn’t hold on to the family 
property – she needed to swiftly remarry (preferably to a member of the
ankhisteia) so that the property could be taken on by another male.
181
Chapter 14: Home and Family

Although restrictive, the position women were expected to adopt in ancient
Greek society was somewhat manageable in wealthy households where
numerous slaves ran the oikos. Women from poorer families, however, had 
to be much more active because they carried out all the tasks necessary to
keep the household going. Some women even worked alongside their hus-
bands in the family trade or at the market. Despite their hard work, women
were still tied to and financially dependent on men. The only women who
were financially independent were some of the more exclusive prostitutes,
who I talk about in Chapter 15.
Marrying and Divorcing
Part of the reason why ancient Greek society controlled women so tightly
was so as not to damage their chances of securing good marriages. Marriage
was the main event of a woman’s life – something that she spent her young
life preparing for.
Girls married at a young age, usually about 14, to men who were considerably
older, probably 25 to 30 years old. Often, women married much older men, if
the men had been recently widowed.
The poet Theognis describes the challenges of marrying a young bride, 
particularly when the husband is older:
‘A young wife is not suitable for an elderly husband 
For she is a boat that does not obey the rudder. 
182
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
Mythical monsters
Women in Greek myth and tragic plays have a
hard time. Most are portrayed as untrustworthy
and temperamental. Examples include:
 Clytemnestra: Wife of Agamemnon. She
murdered her husband when he returned
home from the Trojan War.
 Medea: The wife of Jason from the
Argonauts story (told in Chapter 20). When
he left her for another woman, she mur-
dered their new children and his new bride.
 Pandora: The first ever woman. She was
responsible for bringing all the ills into 
the world.
Of course, things aren’t quite that simple and
most men behave appallingly in myths too. But
these images of women in myth affected the
ancient Greeks. Men were suspicious and tried
to keep women under close control.

Nor do anchors hold her; and she breaks her mooring cables, 
Often at night to find another harbour.’
Getting hitched: It’s all about the money
Weddings were complicated things to organise because they centred largely
on property transfers. When a bride moved in with her new husband, she
brought a dowry with her. The dowry was typically a large sum of money that
represented a portion of her father’s property because giving up the land
itself would be very complicated. The wife didn’t own her dowry and it imme-
diately became the property of her husband – even though he may have to
return it if they divorced.
Marriage took place in two stages: the betrothal (when the union was
announced) and the actual (and completely unromantic) wedding itself. 
The betrothal
The first part of the marriage was called the eggue, which is similar to the
modern notion of betrothal – although the term really means something more
like ‘pledge’. 
The coming marriage was announced publicly (read out in front of members
of the ankhisteia) so others were able to witness both the size of the dowry
the bride’s father was offering and to make assurances that the girl was still 
a virgin. A betrothal often took place very early in a girl’s life when she was
still a child of maybe 5 or 6.
A young man picked his wife on the basis of status and family connections
usually as a result of intensive negotiations within the ankhisteia carried out
by his father. The couple probably never met each other before the betrothal.
Romance didn’t even come into the picture. The entire process was a busi-
ness transaction, pure and simple.
The wedding – or moving day
The actual marriage itself was very straightforward. The girl simply entered
the oikos of her new husband and began living with him. The couple went
through a small formal ceremony to bless the union, but it was all very 
private. You didn’t need a marriage licence because marriage was a private
transaction between the two kurioi.
A wedding feast usually took place afterwards and sometimes went on for
two or three days. All the members of the ankhestia would attend with 
the women all gathered with the bride in the women’s quarters of the house.
It was usually a good natured revel with much eating, drinking, and dancing –
not too different from the average wedding reception today. 
183

Packing up and moving on
Ancient Greek divorce, like marriage, was pretty straightforward: The bride
simply moved out. She went back to the house of her father, if he was still
alive, or to the home of the nearest male relative. 
Either side of a couple could ask for divorce, but more often than not men
sought divorce following an allegation of adultery. (Men commonly slept 
with other women and prostitutes, but wives were supposed to be entirely
faithful.) Typically public proclamations were made about unfaithful wives,
and the women were totally humiliated. 
The other major reason for divorce was so that men could make other, more
socially attractive and financially beneficial marriages. Having been married
before was no barrier to marrying again – for a man or a woman – but a man
had much more choice in whom he married the second or third time. Unlike
other ancient cultures only one spouse was allowed at the same time!
Of course, some marriages took place that didn’t conform to these well-
defined social structures. The poorer and lower classes also married but
without the elaborate preparations and negotiations involved in more 
moneyed households. Many more of these marriages would have been for
love; unfortunately historians don’t know too much about them because all
of the evidence relates to the moneyed literate classes.
Starting Out in Life: Children
In general, the ancient Greek attitude toward children was very harsh. 
Some of the things that I talk about in this section are quite upsetting – so 
be warned.
Ancient Greek men were pretty paranoid about adultery and it partly explains
their distrust and restriction of women. Part of their concern was because of
the possibility of illegitimate children. Greek law around inheritance was very
strict and the emergence of any illegitimate children could really complicate
a situation and result in lengthy legal cases. 
Clearing a difficult first hurdle: Birth 
Ancient Greece had no scientific methods of contraception so women often
fell pregnant. Women would be expected to give birth a number of times
during their life and because they married quite young (age 14 or 15) would
have had many fertile years ahead of them. Four or five children in a family
wouldn’t be unusual.
184

Delivery
In the vast majority of cases, birth was an all-female affair. Either experienced
midwives or female friends delivered babies. Male doctors were called in 
only for the most difficult of cases. (See Chapter 15 for more on ancient Greek
medical practices.) Birth took place in the household where the woman
would have spent her entire term.
The risks to the woman giving birth were as high as they were for the child.
The potential loss of blood and complications in delivery that would be 
manageable today were potentially fatal in ancient Greece. In many cases,
one or other didn’t survive the experience. 
Infanticide
Although appalling, infanticide (the killing or leaving to die of small children)
wasn’t uncommon in ancient Greece. Most Athenian men wanted sons
because a male was able to work in the family business and provided an heir
for the oikos. (The poet Hesiod in his Works and Days poem advises that it’s
best to have only one son and no daughters at all.) Daughters were consid-
ered problems. They were expensive to keep and cost a lot in dowries when
they married. 
The Greek solution was appalling but simple. If the kurios of an oikos decided
that he already had enough children, then subsequent children, especially
girls, were exposed. This horrific practice involved leaving the infant out in
the countryside where he or she either starved or was taken by animals.
I’m not excusing the appalling practice of infanticide, but as I mention 
when I discuss warfare (see Chapter 5), the everyday presence and possibil-
ity of death and disease hardened the ancient Greek people. Also, although
exposure of babies is terrible, you need to bear in mind that life expectancy
in ancient Greece was only around 30 years. Of course, loads of people 
lived to be much older than 30, but the average was brought down by the
185
Chapter 14: Home and Family
Oedipus: A case in point
Probably the most famous Greek play is Oedipus
Tyrannus by Sophocles. The drama centres
around the fact that, after receiving an
unfavourable prophecy, Oedipus’s father gives
his son as an infant to be exposed. The shepherd
asked to expose the child takes sympathy on
Oedipus and gives him away to be adopted,
starting one of the most famously tragic cycle of
events ever. 
The fifth-century BC audience that watched this
play originally wouldn’t have been shocked by
the decision of Oedipus’s father because they
were familiar and comfortable with the ultimate
power that a man had over his oikos. You can
read more about the play in Chapter 16.

huge number of infant mortalities. Death and the loss of loved ones was a
common experience, although that wouldn’t make the pain of losing 
somebody any easier.
Getting an education
If you managed to make it through early childhood, the next stage of life 
was your education. This varied hugely depending on whether you were a
boy or a girl. 
School for boys
No age requirement existed for schooling. Many boys received some kind of
formal education from 5 or 6 all the way through to adulthood (16).
Ancient Greece didn’t have a state-sponsored education system. All classes
were paid for by a boy’s kurios or guardian. Wealthier families provided
tutors who lived and worked in the home, giving lessons to a number of 
children.
Boys experienced three main strands of education:
 Grammatistes taught formal subjects like mathematics, reading, and
writing. Boys spent a lot of their time memorising the works of Homer
and other poets. The Greeks felt that the great works of literature pro-
vided moral training via the conduct of the characters in the stories.
 Kitharistes taught music and poetry. Boys learned how to play the lyre
and perform songs and poetry.
 Paidotribes taught gymnastics and fitness training, most probably at
the palaestra, or training ground. For more on this sort of training see
Chapter 16.
A boy usually had lessons from all these tutors every day (apart from festival
days), often travelling to different places for classes. 
For the wealthy, further study was available when boys became men. Men
could obtain individual tuition in a specific area or subject from teachers
called sophists who hired themselves out for the purpose. By the beginning 
of the fourth century BC, Plato’s Academy, and later Aristotle’s Lyceum,
became established as official schools of higher education. I talk more about
all this in Chapter 23.
Education for the poor
Education was expensive. For families without money, education meant 
working in the family business or on the family farm. This education was
186

vocational so that children could take over the business from their parents.
Girls would also be involved in this work until they reached an age where
they might marry. Many poorer people would have been illiterate. 
Girls: They don’t need no education!
Like so many things in ancient Greece, education was different for girls. It was
very unusual for a father to spend money on his daughter’s education. Boys
were educated because they were taught the skills they needed in order to
succeed in public life. Girls, by contrast, were expected to be domestic and
were taught the skills of needlework and how to run a home. 
Some women were highly educated and nothing stopped them learning later
in life, but these more learned women were very much in the minority and
never had a public role to showcase their talents.
Examining Slavery
In addition to the family members themselves, an oikos included the slaves
within the household. Slavery formed a big part of Greek society, and ancient
Athens included a huge number of slaves. Modern writers have estimated
that at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC (see Chapter 8),
about 50,000 male citizens resided in Athens. At the same time, about 100,000
slaves also lived in the city. If you consider women and children, historians
contend that the total population of Athens was split about 50:50 between
slaves and non-slaves. Both men and women were slaves although they 
fulfilled different roles, women being mostly confined to maid duties and
childcare.
Defining a slave
Slaves were the property of the oikos and had no legal rights whatsoever.
Technically and legally, a slave was exactly the same as a pot or a sheep.
Whoever owned slaves had the power of life and death over them and could
do whatever they wanted. If a man regularly beat and even killed his slaves,
he wasn’t thought of as unreasonably cruel.
As well as fighting wars and writing history Xenophon also wrote books
about philosophy (see Chapter 9). In his book Memorabilia he recreates a
conversation where Socrates discusses the appropriate punishments for
slaves who are lazy and misbehave. The treatment he describes was 
probably quite commonplace:

Socrates: Do they not control their lecherousness by starving them? 
Prevent them stealing by locking up anything they might steal from? Stop
them running away by putting them in fetters? Drive out their laziness 
with beatings?
Some people were born into slavery (as the children of slaves), but the 
vast majority were sold into it, mostly as a result of warfare. For example,
Alexander the Great (see Chapters 10 and 11) sold the entire populations 
of several cities into slavery. He could only have done that if the market 
were thriving.
Establishing the going rate for a slave
Slave markets regularly took place in most cities, and Athens was no excep-
tion. The individuals for sale mostly came from the north in Thrace and
Dalmatia but also from Asia Minor across the Mediterranean (see the map 
on the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book). 
Following are some prices for slaves from an auction that took place in 
415 BC:
 A Thracian woman: 165 drachmas
 A Syrian man: 240 drachmas
 A Scythian man: 144 drachmas
 A Carian child: 72 drachmas
To make some sense of the prices, 1 drachma was the average daily wage of 
a skilled worker (think of about £25 or $50). Young men were most valuable
(and hence expensive) because they could be worked harder for longer and
there was no risk of them falling pregnant. Older people could be expensive 
if they were well educated, and they were often bought to serve as tutors.
Dividing up the labour
After a slave owner bought a slave, the slave had several possible destina-
tions and roles:
 Most households had at least one oiketes, or basic domestic slave. 
 Some better skilled slaves were set up to work in businesses by their
masters, working as potters or other types of craftsmen.
 The Athenian state also owned slaves called demosioi who performed
official functions, such as working with coinage or serving as clerks in
the courts. The Athenian ‘police force’ was also made up of Scythian
slaves often referred to as ‘Scythian Archers’.
188

 Many slaves worked outside the cities on the farms owned by citizens.
Some became trusted to run elements of the farm. 
 The most unfortunate slaves worked in the silver mines at Laureion near
Athens. Their work was hard and remorseless, and death was the only
thing to look forward to.
The huge number of slaves in Athens and in Attica generally did an enormous
amount of work. Their efforts made it possible for male citizens to spend 
so much of their time involved in the political process (see Chapter 7). It’s
kind of ironic that one of the major reasons that the Athenians were able to
develop democracy was their system of subjugating and stripping the rights
from hundreds of thousands of people.
Buying your freedom
Slaves were technically able to either buy or be given their freedom by 
their master, a process called manumission. Gaining freedom from slavery
wasn’t as common as in some other civilisations (like the Roman Empire, 
for example). 
And freedom had its issues. Freed slaves were in awkward positions because
they weren’t able to gain Athenian citizenship and had to become metoikoi
or metics (resident foreigners) instead.
Connecting with Alien Life: Metics
In addition to family and slave, the Athens oikos had one other possible
household member: legal aliens, known as metoikoi or metics.
189
Chapter 14: Home and Family
Legal responsibilities
One of the most unpleasant aspects of being a
slave was their legal position. If slaves were
required to give evidence in legal cases (see
Chapter 7), only statements given under torture
were considered valid because it was felt 
that they would otherwise lie to protect them-
selves (being poor they were considered easy
to corrupt with bribes and inducements).
Both parties in a legal case agreed to the form
of torture in advance and to the compensation
should the slave be disabled as a result. Typical
tortures included the rack, beating, and having
vinegar poured up the nose. 
In general, slaves were best off claiming that
they hadn’t seen anything.

Metoikoi were foreigners who resided in Athens but weren’t granted citizen
status. Their status was slightly different to that of normal visitors to the 
city because metoikoi paid a special tax and needed to have patrons who
guaranteed them while they stayed in the city. Often, guaranteeing included
providing accommodation to the metoikoi. 
Metics sometimes worked as tutors in the houses of their patrons. Several
famous characters went through this process, including the following: 
 The historian and traveller Herodotus performed his work for several
years in Athens and was very popular, but he left when the city refused
to grant him citizen status. 
 The great philosopher Aristotle spent years in Athens living in a house
just outside the city walls. As a metoikos he wasn’t allowed to buy 
property in the city and was forced to build a house outside it.

L
ike much of the ancient Greek experience, many things seem very close
to how people live today, whereas other aspects seem very strange. In
this chapter (and Chapter 16), I examine how people lived their lives on a
day-to-day basis. After shedding some light on how the ancient Greeks kept
track of their days, this chapter focuses on three staple elements of daily
human existence: eating, drinking, and procreation. Along the way, I also
touch on two other essentials: money and medicine.
Biding Their Time: The Greek 
Calendar and Clock
As I mention in Chapter 1, people in the ancient world most commonly dated
things by events rather than an actual year. For example, they probably said
‘In the year Pericles died’ or ‘the year after the battle of Marathon’, rather
than 429 BC or 479 BC, respectively. 
Although this convention is very straightforward, the actual Greek calendar
was really complex. The following sections cover the basics.

Figuring out the day 
Part of the challenge of working with ancient Greek dates is that the region
didn’t operate under a single calendar. Although every city based its calendar
on the lunar cycle, they named individual months and fixed dates after local
gods and religious festivals. 
In fact, not only did every town or city have a different name for each month,
but each possibly used a different date for the start of a new year. So if you
were celebrating the New Year in Athens, folks in Thebes may still be in the
previous one. The dissimilarities weren’t vast and probably didn’t make that
much difference. In the time it took to travel from Athens to Thebes it would
be new year when you got there anyway!
Exploring the Athenian calendar
Because this chapter, as well as most of Part III, focuses on Athens, this 
city’s calendar is worth examining in detail. Table 15-1 outlines the Athenian
calendar.

Each of Athens’s 12 months was either 29 or 30 days long, meaning that a
year usually added up to about 354 days. Except the system wasn’t actually
that simple. The arkhons designated some years as leap years and added a
whole extra month. Leap years sometimes involved just repeating an already
existing month, and mostly the ekklesia chose to have another month of
Poseideon. This curious custom meant that a leap year was up to 384 days 
in length.
Although this was a lunar calendar and the Greeks were using the moon 
to calculate it, this wasn’t the main reason for making changes. More often
than not the changes were used to create extra time. In 271 BC the Athenians
added four extra days to the month of Elaphebolion to allow more time to
prepare for the City Dionysia festival (see Chapter 16). It’s probably fair 
to assume that other cities did the same sort of thing.
What day is it again?
The days within each month were even more complicated. The Athenians
didn’t name the day (Monday, Tuesday, and so on) – instead, they numbered
them. But even this convention wasn’t as straightforward as it may seem. 
A month started with the new moon and the Athenians then divided it into
three parts: waxing, full, and waning. The first two parts counted forward the
next 21 days. However, at the 22nd day things changed. As the moon began to
wane, the Athenians counted backwards from 10 until the end of the month,
finishing at day 1. This last day was known as the ‘old and new’ day. 
So, despite having a 30-day month, the last day of Poseideon, for example,
was actually the 1st. It’s very confusing. It confused me when I was writing
about it.
Additional calendars
Incredibly, time keeping was actually even more complicated. In addition to
the calendar conventions I describe in the preceding section, the ancient
Athenians used two other forms of calendar: 
 A calendar for scheduling religious festivals
 Another calendar to date political documents and legislation
193
Chapter 15: Going About Daily Life in Ancient Greece
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The various calendars were mapped against each other, and on many 
occasions people must have needed to be told what day it was! The public
slaves, or demosioi (see Chapter 14), were put in charge of keeping dates 
and records straight.
Working from dawn till dusk
The average Athenian day began at dawn, or just before, and carried on until
last light (probably an average of about 15 hours). Because most jobs and
activities required light, they usually ceased by the evening, when it was time
for eating, drinking, and socialising – if you were male. See the later sections
for more on these good-time activities.
However, like keeping track of the specific day, telling the time in ancient
Greece was tricky. The Greeks only really worked on the basis of the hour
rather than minutes. The two main methods were:
 Sundial: The Greeks found out about the sundial from Babylon in Persia
where the device was developed, and first started using their own less
refined versions in the sixth century BC. The Greek instruments weren’t
terribly accurate until the third century BC when Hellenistic scholars
(see Chapter 12) worked out the mathematic formula that made sundials
work properly.
194
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
Phew, that was a long week!
If you read through the details of the section
‘Exploring the Athenian calendar’, you may
wonder how the numbering system left any
room for weekends. Well, it didn’t. There weren’t
formal days of ‘non-work’ apart from festivals
and when you worked depended on what 
you did. For many people, if they didn’t work 
they didn’t eat. Other wealthier farmers or 
business people would be able to choose what
they did and when. At certain times there 
was more to do, particularly in seasonal work
like farming.
In Athens pretty much every day was a work day
except when they held religious festivals.
Athenians spent about 60 days in festivals every
year, and probably about another 20 days were
other specified non-work days for those taking
part: citizens, women of Attica, and in some
cases metics. Slaves were mostly excluded. 
With the current two-day weekend, modern
folks get about 20 extra days off each year com-
pared with the ancient Greeks – but then again,
they also had thousands of slaves to do a lot of
the work for them!

 Water-clock: At night and when no sunlight was available, some people
turned to crude water-clocks that used the flow of water as a timing
device. Again, these devices weren’t very accurate, and the Hellenistic
scholar, Ctesibius of Alexandria, refined the mechanism in the third 
century BC.
Greeks referred to time by using dawn, midday, and dusk as reference points
and then adding hours, such as ‘in the third hour after dawn’.
After you got up in the morning, what you actually did for the rest of the 
day was pretty dependent on who you were. Ancient Athens didn’t include a
wide range of occupations: farmer, artisan, labourer, or slave were the most
common. For these people, most days were very similar and very hard.
More interesting are the lives of those people who were wealthy enough to 
be able to afford not to work every day. For them life in the city – particularly
Athens – held other attractions like the ekklesia (see Chapter 7), the jury-
courts, the gymnasium, and the theatre (see Chapter 16). The pleasures of
wine, women, and song were also popular as the later section
‘Acknowledging the oldest profession’ explains.
Managing Your Money
Just like today, ancient Greeks had to pay to run a household and to buy
products at the market, and the Greeks were the first people in the
Mediterranean to introduce the actual concept of money. 
Money started off as a measure for assessing how rich in possessions people
were. By 800 BC the Greeks had introduced small wooden sticks called obeloi,
meaning ‘spits’. These sticks were a measure of an amount of wealth, like a
modern-day cheque or a note.
Within a couple of hundred years, the Greeks moved on to using actual coins
of which the main basic unit of currency was known as the obol. Greek coins,
as shown in Figure 15-1, were made from gold, silver, or copper alloy. Their
weight determined the value of the coins so this was closely regulated by 
officials appointed by the governing council. This caused a new trade to
develop, that of the money changer who would swap coins for a hefty com-
mission when you visited a city.
Coins were illustrated with an image on each side that indicated where they
came from. Most often the coin represented a god or local deity. Demeter was
very popular because she was the goddess of crops and fertility, and she 
was often represented by an ear of barley. (Refer to Chapter 13 for more on
Demeter.)

Dining and Delighting 
Some of the first written descriptions of meals in Greek literature appear 
in Homer’s The Iliad and The Odyssey. Both poems feature multiple scenes
that involve a sacrifice and a subsequent meal. The description is repeated
whenever the heroes make a sacrifice and then sit down to a meal. In The
Odyssey it’s often when Odysseus and his men set down their ships on an
island – think of them doing this on the beach!
Once they’d prayed, slaughtered and skinned the cattle, they cut the
thighbones out and then wrapped them round in fat. . . once they’d burned
the bones and tasted the organs they hacked the rest into pieces, piercing
them with spits.
That’s right – Odysseus and his men were making beef shish kebabs!
The people of ancient Athens loved to eat, and in the fifth century BC, when
Athens was a rich and successful port, a range of food was readily available.
In this section, I look at what everyone ate – from basic everyday foods to 
the splendid feasts that took place as part of a symposium.

Enjoying a simple meal
Depending on who you were in ancient Athens, most meals were pretty basic.
As I write in Chapter 13, the staple of the Greek diet was cereal crops like
barley and wheat. That meant that most meals involved bread in combination
with other things. The Greeks described anything that was eaten with bread
(perhaps cheese, honey, or another accompaniment such as being dipped in
spiced wine) as opson. 
A breakfast snack may be just some bread dipped in olive oil. A more sub-
stantial meal usually included beans, peas, lentils, or chick-peas – again with
bread. A typical midday meal included honey or cheese as the opson – rather
like a Ploughman’s lunch. A huge variety of cheeses were available, the most
traditional being goats ‘feta’ cheese but, like wine, regions had their own 
specialities.The ancient Greeks kept lunch simple because work continued in
the afternoon.
The big meal of the day was in the evening after work. At this meal a greater
variety of food was available (especially at more formal meals like a sympo-
sium – see the later section ‘Sipping at a symposium’). Fish was usually on
the menu. Beef, pork, and even poultry were less popular and eaten less 
often – people usually ate meat after sacrifices and saw it as something of a
luxury food.
Favouring fish
The Athenians loved fish. The Greek word osophegos meant ‘fish eater’. 
As I mention in Chapter 13, fish were quite difficult to catch in the ancient
Mediterranean because the fishermen lacked modern deep sea fishing 
techniques. As a result, fish were highly sought after. 
Greek literature is full of references to fish and where different specialities
came from. Eels from Boeotia and dog-fish from Rhodes are quoted as being
real delicacies. If you visit Athens today, you still find a large number of fish
restaurants offering these delicacies!
197
Chapter 15: Going About Daily Life in Ancient Greece
Putting your money where your mouth is
One of the more remarkable stories about the
ancient Athenians was that they carried their
small change in their mouths. Because people
mostly wore clothes without pockets, your mouth
was seen as a way of keeping your money safe
and out of the reach of thieves. This practice
gives a good guide as to how small Greek coins
were. You had to be careful though – if you
swallowed at the wrong time, you had to wait a
day or so until you got your change!

In addition to fresh fish, pickled fish and fish sauce were highly prized delica-
cies. Often fish was used to flavour other foods, and the most expensive type
of sauce, which later became known as garum, was popular throughout the
Greek and then Roman world.
Hedylos was a Hellenistic poet from Samos who wrote mainly about food and
drink. In the following poem, he describes the excitement over a special fish
dinner. He also references the myth about Zeus turning himself into a shower
of gold so that he could fit through the keyhole and have sex with Danae
whose father had locked her away!
Our prize fish is done! Now jam the door-pin in Proteus! Agis the fancier of
fishes might come in. He’ll be fire and water, anything he wants. So lock it
up . . . but maybe he’ll arrive turned into Zeus and shower gold upon this
Danae of a dish!
Sampling side orders
The ancient Greek diet wasn’t all just bread and fish. Some of the feasts 
put together for expensive formal dinners included all kinds of ingredients. 
A lot of vegetables supplemented main courses but people didn’t usually 
eat veggies on their own. Vegetarians did exist but they were thought of as
unusual people. 
The most popular veggies were onions, turnips, leeks, and celery. (The
potato hadn’t been discovered yet.) Fruit was available, but mostly only
grapes, apples, and figs. The Greeks didn’t have bananas or citrus fruits, 
and they didn’t have tomatoes either.
Cooking up a storm
Although not as advanced as today, the Greeks did use some cooking tech-
niques. Baking was common practice, with bread being a staple part of the
diet. Cooks usually boiled vegetables and beans, and heated other foods on a
brazier (small portable stove), which was hot, sweaty work. In good weather
cooking would be done outside and the food then taken in to eat.
Cooking skill was all about how a cook used sauces and spices to flavour 
the food. People whom the Greeks considered knowledgeable about food 
and cooking were those who understood the process of flavouring rather
than cooking itself. Cooks often used wine to enhance the flavour of a dish,
along with olive oil and the stock produced from cooking meat and fish.
Marinating was a secret technique for boosting the flavour of ordinary 
ingredients.

Shopping for ingredients
Most Athenians did their food shopping in the market that was located in 
the centre of the city. The farmers of Attica held monthly markets, bringing
their wares to the city and selling them to the market traders. 
Markets in Athens and elsewhere were made up of individual tables
(trapezai) and booths rather than actual shops. The closest thing to shops
were the workshops of specific artisans like potters or smiths who also did
business there. 
Sometimes, Athenians would travel a good distance to buy goods direct from
the supplier. Fish lovers often made the half a day’s walk to Piraeus to buy
fresh fish from the fishing boats.
Drinking It Up
The most important accompaniment to food was drink, and drinking was a
big part of Greek life. Wine was, of course, the main drink (see Chapter 13 for
more on wine and viticulture), although the Greeks knew about beer because
people drank it in Egypt, Syria, and the east.
Greeks drank a lot of wine, but they mixed it with water. The Macedonians
were considered vulgar because they drank their wine without mixing it. The
wine wasn’t as alcoholic as modern wine, but ancient Greeks still got drunk
and sometimes drank with the intention of doing so.
Imbibing publically – and privately 
The most famous drinking sessions took place at symposiums (see the fol-
lowing section ‘Sipping at a symposium’), but plenty of other places existed
where you could sink a few. The most popular spot was a tavern or kapeleion.
199
Chapter 15: Going About Daily Life in Ancient Greece
Celebrity chefs
The life of a cook in ancient Greece was varied.
Many cooks worked like caterers for hire to
individual households, but some richer Greeks
had their own cooks who were part of their
domestic staff. 
Some people even wrote about food and 
cooking. Fragments of two of the most famous
cookbooks – Gastronomy by Archestratus 
and The Art of Cookery by Heracleides of
Syracuse – still exist.

These establishments were pretty basic places that sold only wine and their
managers were called kapeloi – men who ran the business, mixed the wine,
and dealt with any troublemakers, much like modern pub landlords.
The Greeks had an interesting take on drunkenness. In private (such as in 
the symposium), intoxication was entirely permissible and even encouraged.
In fact, drunkenness formed a large part of many religious festivals (see
Chapter 22). Public drunkenness, however, was regarded as uncouth and
unpleasant.
Sipping at a symposium
Simply put, a symposium was a posh drinking party for men only with a bit of
philosophical chat and some flute girls. Women did meet with each other but
it was very rare that they attended a symposium. The only women usually
present were the flute girls and possibly prostitutes. Held in the andron of a
private household (see Chapter 14), a symposium was a two-stage evening:
 The first stage was the deipnon, or formal dinner.
 The following stage was the symposion, or session of drinking together.
Usually, a symposium involved 14 to 30 guests who drank from special 
wine cups, or craters as they were known (see Chapter 17 for more on 
Greek pottery). During a symposion, guests discussed philosophical issues.
Professional performers such as poets, singers, and actors entertained 
the guests, and slave boys and sometimes expensive courtesans known as
hetairai (see the section ‘Acknowledging the oldest profession’) attended 
to guests’s every need.
The evening ended with a torch-lit procession through the streets known as
komos, to show the bonding within the group that had taken place.
In one of his poems Hedylos gives a flavour of the symposion mood:
Let’s drink up: with wine, what original, what nuanced, what sweet fancy
speech I might hit on! Soak me with a jug of Chian, and say, ‘Have fun
Hedylos.’ For I hate wasting time unless I’m high.
Hedylos’s boisterous words are probably a good guide to the quality of the
philosophical discussion after a few craters of wine!
Pondering Sex and the Ancient Greeks
The concepts of love and sex were very different from that of marriage. As I
mention in Chapter 14, Greek men commonly had affairs with other women –
200
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

and in some cases, younger boys (see the later section ‘Contemplating 
homosexuality’). 
More often than not, the heterosexual affairs were with prostitutes or other
sex workers, and sometimes these relationships were considered love affairs.
Love, sex, and wine were all linked together in the Greek mind. The following
poem by Asklepiades from Samos is very evocative in its description of wine
and unhappy love.
Wine is love’s test. Nicagoras told us he had no lover, but the toasts betrayed
him. His tears, yes and unhappy eyes, the tight wreath on his bent head slips
out of place.
Acknowledging the oldest profession
Prostitution was legal in Athens. Indeed, it was a thriving business that 
actually paid tax to the city treasury. The women involved were very unlikely
to be Athenian and were most often from Asia Minor. 
Although prostitutes is the general term used to describe these women, three
distinct classes existed:
 Pallakai (concubines): These women were ‘permanently’ attached 
to a male and may even have lived in his household. Often men set up
their pallakai in separate houses and apartments within the city and 
visited them regularly. These women were more like mistresses than
prostitutes, although they did receive money and gifts.
 Hetairai (courtesans): These ladies were very expensive and exclusive,
handpicking their clients. Often highly educated, hetairai had more in
common with a Japanese geisha than other classes of prostitute. They
were employed for their intelligence and conversation as much as their
sexual attractiveness.
 Pornai (prostitutes): This term covered all types of prostitute from
those who worked in brothels to more expensive girls for hire. They
include the aulos or ‘flute girls’ who were invited to the symposia. The
category also included some male prostitutes, although these were
unusual.
Contemplating homosexuality
The Greeks regarded homosexuality as nothing unusual. If a man found
women attractive, then there was nothing surprising about the fact that he
found adolescent boys attractive also and chose to actively pursue them. 
201
Chapter 15: Going About Daily Life in Ancient Greece
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The normal situation was that an older man (the erastes meaning ‘lover’) 
pursued the affections of a younger boy (the eromenos, or ‘beloved’). 
The most common place where such liaisons took place was the palaestra
at the gymnasium where older men watched the young boys exercising. This
being the case, only leisured aristocrats with time on their hands probably
really engaged in homosexual affairs.
This short poem by Phanias describes his love for a boy who has grown
slightly too old to be considered an eromenos, and it shows how quickly
these relationships were considered to be finished. 
By Themis and the wine that made me tipsy, your love won’t last much
longer Pamphilus. Already there’s hair on your thigh, down on your cheeks
and another lust ahead. But a little of the old spark’s still there, so don’t be
stingy – opportunity is love’s friend.
That’s not to say that the Greeks didn’t mock homosexuality – the plays 
of Aristophanes are full of jokes. But their scorn was specifically reserved 
for men who carried on relationships with each other into middle age and
those who showed any sign of effeminacy. Finding young boys attractive was
entirely acceptable – a mature man allowing himself to be treated like a
woman was not.
Love and sex between two women probably happened regularly in ancient
Greece but it was never public and there’s very little evidence of it. The most
famous association is with the poet Sappho (seventh century BC) who came
from the island of Lesbos (giving rise to the term ‘lesbian’). Sappho wrote
beautiful lyric poems about love and the goddess Aphrodite, many of which
could be interpreted as being about both men and women and we know 
little about her actual life. The Greeks didn’t recognise Sappho as being gay;
only more modern readers. Sappho’s poems are wonderfully evocative of 
the ancient times she lived in before the Greeks had begun to record 
their history.
202
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
Athens does Pericles a favour
A public association with pallakai or hetairai was
seen as nothing unusual in ancient Athens.
Pericles, the famous Athenian politician, even
went as far as divorcing his Athenian wife so that
he could live permanently with a hetaira from
Miletus called Aspasia. They had a son who
couldn’t receive citizen rights under Athenian
law. However, when Pericles’s two sons from his
first marriage died of the plague in 430 BC, the
ekklesia voted that his son with Aspasia be made
a full citizen.

Seeking Medical Assistance 
So what did you do if you’d overindulged in food, drink, or sex? Consulting a
doctor was relatively easy in ancient Athens, but it was also very expensive –
and some of the methods were rather scary.
Doctors were professional people rather like craftsmen or artisans, and as
such their methods were equally varied. Doctors travelled throughout
Greece, finding work where they could. In big cities like Athens, however,
they ran small businesses like a kind of shop and charged high prices.
Turning to the gods 
Throughout the whole of Greek history many people believed that anger 
of the gods caused illness. Many gods had associations with health and 
wellbeing including Apollo, but the most important of all was Asclepius. 
Asclepius was an interesting character who was born a mortal but became a
god when he died. As the son of Apollo, he was born with miraculous healing
powers, and he travelled far and wide healing the sick. In the end, Asclepius’s
powers didn’t do him much good because, when he tried to resurrect the
dead, Zeus killed him with a thunderbolt for trying to act like an immortal!
Apollo intervened and Asclepius was made into a god.
Greeks all over the Mediterranean worshipped Asclepius and made offerings
to him, hoping to be cured of illness. He had sanctuaries in several places but
the most famous was on the island of Cos. Quite an industry built up around
the shrine, and people travelled from all over the Mediterranean to visit it.
The deal was that if you made an offering to the god Asclepius (such as some
money, a piece of art, or the sacrifice of a small animal like a chicken), he may
visit you in the night and cure you. And if he didn’t? Well you obviously
hadn’t made a big enough offering!
Some temples offered healing services, but it was unlikely that the priests
had any medical training. A large amount of belief was the best that people
received. 
Meeting the Father of Medicine:
Hippocrates
Other people did try to cure illnesses. The most famous and influential of
these was a man called Hippocrates of Cos (460–377 BC). His father was a

doctor and Hippocrates followed in his footsteps. He eventually left the
island of Cos and was in Athens during the Peloponnesian War, where he
treated people suffering from the plague. 
What made Hippocrates special was that he was one of the first ancient
Greeks to argue that illness was caused by natural factors rather than being 
a punishment from the gods. He was keen on a healthy diet, clean conditions,
and the use of herbs and pastes to treat patients. Because of his healthy
lifestyle he was rumoured to have lived to be 120 years old – he didn’t!
After the Peloponnesian War, Hippocrates returned to Cos and founded 
his own school of medicine and put together the Hippocratic Corpus. This
massive book included 60 different essays on good medical practice, 
including the famous Hippocratic Oath. 
I swear by Apollo Physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panaceia and
all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfil
according to my ability this oath and this covenant.
The Hippocratic Oath was written by Hippocrates as a guide for new doctors
about what they should do. It includes promises not to carry out abortions,
euthanasia, or any surgery that they haven’t trained in, or to have sexual 
relations with patients. Much of the oath’s language and philosophy is very
out of date now, but some doctors swear by it even today!
Treating all manner of ills
Most ancient medical treatments involved the use of herbs or spices and
some attempted to either cool or heat the body as a way of controlling the 
illness. Most doctors were keen on the idea of balance in everything and that
a lack of it caused illness. So if you were too hot, you needed cooling down,
and vice versa. 
Surgery was rarely attempted because people knew little about the inner
workings of the body. The Greeks considered the examination and dissection
of corpses to be sacrilegious, and so opportunities to discover anything 
further after a patient’s passing were slim. For example, most Greeks believed
that the heart was in the head and not the body.
For anybody who contracted a serious illness, the chances of recovery were
slim. Those injured in battle very often died of their wounds. 
Things changed a little when the philosopher Aristotle began his study of the
human body (see Chapter 23), but no major advances in medicine occurred
until late in the Roman Empire through people like Galen (circa AD 200). The
best advice was not to get ill!

W
hen seeking out good times, the ancient Greeks were a contrary
bunch. On the one hand, they loved tragic theatre where noble heroes
struggled with terrible choices and met with appalling fates. On the other,
they loved comic plays chock full of nasty jokes at the expense of some of the
audience and ridiculous gags about farting and sex. They also enjoyed hard,
gruelling athletics, including an incredibly violent form of boxing where com-
petitors often died.
Even more strangely, the same people enjoyed events that closely connected
all these diverse activities. The games and festivals that the Greeks loved
combined athletics and theatre – and they considered both endeavours to be
equally prestigious. 
Theatre and athletics combined a lot of themes: competition, public celebra-
tion, honouring the gods, and literature. Entertainment in ancient Greece was
for everybody and enjoyed by everybody.
The type of entertainments that I look at in this chapter date from around 600
BC to the end of the Greek era in the first century BC. However, as you’ll see,
they had roots that went back much further into the past and their influence
carries on this day.

Making Art Onstage: Greek Theatre
Going to the theatre in ancient Greece was very different from today’s experi-
ence of popular long-running shows and entertainment districts with multiple
theatres.
Getting in a festive mood
Opportunities to see plays and performances were quite limited in ancient
Greece. When productions happened nearly everybody tried to go, because
the plays and performances were part of something else, something larger –
festivals.
Ancient Greek plays were performed only at certain times of the year, at the
same time as specific religious festivals. These plays were massive events
that involved the whole community.
The main festivals in Athens were the Lenaia in January and the Great or City
Dionysia that was held in March. The dramatic performances were in govern-
ment-organised competition with each other, and the rivalry was intense. See
the later section ‘Competing: And the winner is . . .’ for more.
Touring the theatre
The key venue for the festivals was the theatre itself. In Athens the main
venue was the theatre of Dionysus. The space was large and probably held an
audience of about 14,000 people. 
The theatre of Dionysus was one of the first permanent theatres built by 
the Greeks so its design was very influential. The theatre was a major public
space located next to the Acropolis. A theatre of Dionysus is still in the same
spot now but it’s a rebuild of the original carried out by the Romans in the
second century AD.
For such an important and well-attended site the actual ‘building’ was pretty
basic. Performances took place in the open air with the audience sitting on
very simple benches or sometimes just the bare ground. All the views were
excellent and, with the exception of a few special seats at the front that were
reserved for arkhons and officials involved in the competition, anyone could
sit anywhere.
All social classes attended the theatre – much like the Globe Theatre in
Elizabethan England where people of all classes met to watch the plays of
Shakespeare, Marlowe, and other writers of the day. Entrance was either free
206

or came at a small charge depending upon the nature of the event. It seems
quite likely that women attended the theatre but they would have been very
much in the minority.
The modern word ‘theatre’ comes from the Greek word ‘theatron’, which
means ‘viewing place’ and refers to the seated area for the audience. 
The theatre of Dionysus and other ancient Greek theatres had a roughly 
semi-circular arrangement. As Figure 16-1 illustrates, theatres included:
 Orchestra: The large circle at the centre of the theatre was mostly 
used by the chorus (see the later section ‘Dealing with a chorus of disap-
proval’). The Greeks often referred to it as the ‘dancing circle’ because
the chorus spent most of their time there and their performance was full
of movement and dancing compared to that of the main actors.
 Parodoi: Both the performers and the audience used these two
entrances to access the stage and seating areas. 
 Skene: This area was most like a modern stage. Behind the platform
stood a long building with a flat roof that was used as both scenery and
a place for the actors to change. It was this that was actually called the
skene although the platform was attached to it.
 Theatron: These terraces were often just cut into a hill and provided
seating for thousands of audience members.

Greek theatres were not amphitheatres! The word amphi means ‘on both
sides’, like in amphora, which was a double-handled jar. Amphitheatres were,
therefore, double theatre spaces, making a full circle. Amphitheatres were
mostly built during the Roman period (roughly 300 BC to 330 AD) and used
for gladiatorial games. A good example is the Colosseum in Rome, which was
originally called the Flavian Amphitheatre.
Most of the larger cities would have had a permanent theatre but smaller
towns would erect a temporary structure for when performances were 
put on. Historians have no direct evidence that the theatres were used for
other events (when plays weren’t on) but given their size it seems likely 
that they may have been used as meeting places.
Acting up 
Acting was a very specific skill in ancient Greece – and an activity that was
exclusively male. Women never appeared on stage and men played all the
female parts. As a result, the Greeks considered actors to be unusual in 
that they allowed themselves to appear like women.
Being seen and heard
The acoustics in ancient Greek theatres were tremendous. Members of the
audience at the back of the theatre were able to hear every word spoken by
the actors onstage, despite the fact that they were separated by around 20
metres across the orchestra and a further 80 metres to the back of the the-
atron. It required tremendous skill on the part of the actors to be audible for
the length of a play (probably about 90 minutes). I’ve been to many Greek
theatres and the acoustics still work today – you can stand in the orchestra
and speak in a relatively clear and loud voice to be heard at the very back.
Amazing!
The view was different. With no television projection technology, all the audi-
ence saw were the actors in front of the skene or in the orchestra. These sight
limitations meant that the acting had to be very physical and not particularly
realistic. Gestures were most likely large, exaggerated, and obvious.
Getting into costume and wearing masks
To accommodate the large venues, the Greek actors relied on very large 
costumes and masks. Masks were made of wood, brightly painted with big,
obvious features meant to convey two things: the age of the character and
their mood. 
Masks and costumes helped male actors to play female roles and enabled 
the actors to swap roles if necessary. These elements minimised subtle 
and naturalistic acting, requiring the actors to use expansive gestures and
208

elaborate vocalisations to get their points across to the audience. (It’s no
coincidence that characters in Greek plays are usually introduced and briefly
described in the dialogue – it helped the audience even back then to identify
who had just appeared on stage!)
Competing: And the winner is . . .
During a festival, all the plays were in competition with each other for the
overall prize. First, second, and third prize were awarded to the plays and the
winning poets. 
The system of judging was rather strange. City officials appointed ten judges
from the citizen body and they held a secret ballot at the end of the day’s 
performances. They’d each drop a pebble into a jar, the colour of which cor-
responded to the poet who they’d chosen. Of these ten votes only the first
five were drawn out and counted. It must have led to some very controversial
results, although there are no recorded cases of anybody appealing!
As far as we know there were no material prizes; only the honour of winning.
However, the winning poets could expect to be asked to perform some of
their work at expensive symposia (refer to Chapter 15) following a victory so
at the very least they’d get some decent dinners out it and would more than
likely get paid as well!
The playwrights (the Greeks referred to them as ‘poets’) submitted their
plays to the arkhons (see Chapter 7), who then selected three pieces for each
competition. During the fifth century BC many poets wrote numerous plays,
and competition was fierce. For example, out of the 92 plays written by the
great dramatist Euripides, only six won first prize at a festival (although as all
the works were submitted in groups of three it means that 6 out of 30 won
rather than 6 out of 90). Once every five submissions! 
Each poet in the competition was assigned a wealthy citizen, known as a
khoregos, who paid for the production, including the actors, dancers, and all
other expenses. Serving as the patron of a play was considered to be an
extremely prestigious honour.
The poet was also assigned by lot his lead actor, whom the Greeks referred to
as the protagonist. The poet directed the play himself.
At each festival, a poet typically presented three tragic plays and a satyr play
– a short, comic version of a myth that provided some light relief at the end
of the day. The plays weren’t necessarily trilogies, although they frequently
had similar themes. The audience sat through the whole offering in one day –
it probably took the best part of six hours!
209

The vast majority of plays were produced only once because the poets 
didn’t want to enter them twice for a festival. More popular plays were taken
on tour to small rural festivals or sometimes revived many years later. For
example, Alexander the Great (see Chapters 10 and 11) had a love of tragedy
and regularly asked for his favourites to be performed at festivals, sometimes
more than 100 years after these works were first produced.
The plays themselves took two forms: tragedy and comedy. The forms were
very different but equally respected.
Delving into tragedy: Tears and fate
Tragedy was the earliest form of Greek theatre. It was probably invented in
Athens in as early as 550 BC, growing out of the traditional religious hymns
that the Greeks sung at festivals. These hymns known as dithyramb were
based on a mythological and religious theme and sung solo. Over time a
second voice joined the hymn, turning it into a dialogue that eventually
became a play. The earliest play that survives is The Persians by Aeschylus,
which was produced in 472 BC.
The fifth century BC was when tragedy took the form students and scholars
still study today. This period is also the time when the three great tragic
poets were at work:
 Aeschylus (525–456 BC): Wrote 80 plays of which 7 survive 
 Euripides (485–406 BC): Wrote 92 plays of which 19 survive
 Sophocles (496–406 BC): Wrote 120 plays of which 7 survive
The subjects of tragic plays were very familiar to audiences because the sto-
ries were nearly all based on Greek myths. This meant that the audience was
almost certain to know how a play ended before it even began. For the
Greeks, the ideas of plot and suspense weren’t very important. Tragic poets
were much more concerned about the portrayal of the characters and the
ideas that the plays were exploring. It isn’t that unusual an idea to us now.
Everyone knows how films like Titanic are going to end and they’re still
hugely popular. Theatre performances of Hamlet or Macbeth end in the same
way – but the way that they’re performed and interpreted is what the audi-
ence finds interesting.
The ancient Greeks didn’t really have history as such (see Chapter 21). 
Nor did they have a religion that set out an ethical code of behaviour (see
Chapter 22). Therefore, the myths that had existed for generations filled 
gaps in their knowledge and beliefs. In the tragic plays, the mythological
characters explored ethical and moral issues that were relevant to the way
people led their lives, providing something that history and religion didn’t.

Meeting a typical tragic hero
The main method for exploring ethical and moral issues was the role of the
tragic hero. During the plays, tragic heroes typically underwent philosophical
journeys that ended with suffering great loss and often death. Usually, the
journeys are the result of mistakes or transgressions that the characters
commit. Very often, the heroes are said to have a fatal or tragic flaw.

Tragedy: The Greatest Hits
Quite a few Greek tragedies still survive. Here’s a rough guide to some of the best to investigate. 
Play
Poet
Plot
Agamemnon
Aeschylus
Agamemnon returns home from the Trojan war and is
murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover
Aegisthus. Orestes (Agamemnon’s exiled son) then
returns home and kills his father’s murderers before
being haunted with guilt. These plays, known as the
Oresteia, are the only existing complete trilogy of plays.
The Libation 
Bearers
The Eumenides
Oedipus
Sophocles
The classic tragedy. See the later sidebar ‘Oedipus: A
complex case’.
Antigone
Oedipus’s daughter strives for the right to bury her
brother who’s been killed fighting against their home
city.
Philoctetes
Philoctetes, hero in exile, holds the famous bow of
Heracles that the Greeks need to win the war in Troy.
Odysseus is sent to take it from him at any cost. 
Ajax
The great Greek hero Ajax is furious at being denied the
armour of the dead Achilles and his anger drives him to
the brink of madness.
Medea
Euripides
Cruelly spurned by the Greek hero Jason, who she
helped to steal the Golden Fleece, Medea plots to
avenge herself.
Trojan Women
The fate of the wives and mothers of Troy’s fallen war-
riors is laid bare in this harrowing play.
The Bacchae
Cadmus, the king of Thebes, offends the god Dionysus
and pays a terrible price at the hands of his followers.

As a result, the heroes – and the audience – know more about themselves and
recognise their faults and mistakes. The Greeks referred to the process as
pathos (suffering), mathos (understanding), or anagnorisis (recognition).
Women were often the lead characters in the plays. Characters such as
Medea, Hecuba, Antigone, Clytemnestra, and Electra dominate the plays they
appear in and are fascinating multi-layered characters. However, they would
have all been played by men! 
Dealing with a chorus of disapproval
The chorus delivers most of the commentary on the action in a tragic play.
In ancient Greece, these performers generally stayed in the orchestra and
commented on the things that the other characters were doing, sometimes
providing the back story too. Very often the chorus is in opposition to the
main character and his or her actions. Most interactions between the chorus
and main actors involved the chorus leader who was the only person that
spoke directly to those on the skene. 
We don’t have any evidence of the sort of music played, because none of it
has survived. However, if you read a good translation of one of the plays you
can see how lyrical the words are and how easily they could be chanted
rather than spoken.
Aristotle wrote a book called The Art of Poetry. Here he sums up what good
tragedy should do:
The tragic fear and pity may be aroused by the Spectacle [the onstage
action], but they may also be aroused by the very structure and incidents of
the play – which is the better way and shows the better poet. 
The gods help out at last!
In many plays a resolution is found to the terrible problems of its human
characters by the appearance of one or more of the Olympian gods (which 
I describe in Chapter 19). Often the gods do something to tie up loose ends
that humans could never do. This might seem like a bit of a cop-out but
remember that the ideas rather than the plot are the important bit!
212
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
This play contains strong, bloody violence
The nature of Greek tragedy usually means that
hugely unpleasant things took place: murder,
suicide, mutilation, and incest, just to start with.
However, all these things happened offstage
(and are often vividly described by a servant or
messenger who unwittingly witnesses the grue-
some event) because the idea of them was
thought to be terrible enough without enacting
the cruel deeds.

The appearance of the gods like this gave rise to the expression ‘deus ex
machina’, Latin for ‘god out of a machine’ because when the gods appeared
they were lowered down on a cradle at the back of the skene. The expression
is now used to describe any situation where something unlikely happens to
sort out a plot!
Considering comedy: Sex and satire
Greek comedy was very different to tragedy (see the preceding section
‘Delving into tragedy: Tears and fate’) but followed rules in a similar way. 
 Comic plays were entered in festival competitions and paid for by a
wealthy khoregos.
 Ideas were very important in comedy, but spectacle was too. The 
chorus usually wore impressive costumes and featured loud singing 
and intricate dancing.
213
Chapter 16: Plays and Pugilism: Enjoying Ancient Greek Entertainment 
Oedipus: A complex case
Probably the most famous Greek tragedy is
Oedipus Tyrannus (also known as Oedipus Rex
or Oedipus the King) by Sophocles. Aristotle
thought the play was the greatest tragedy ever
written. 
The story of Oedipus, the king of Thebes, goes
as follows: 
 Prior to the beginning of the play, Oedipus
as a young man fled Thebes after a
prophecy said that he would murder his
father and marry his mother. Eventually,
Oedipus returned to Thebes, defeated the
fearsome Sphinx, married the widowed
queen Jocasta, and became king as his
reward. 
 As the play opens, Thebes is undergoing a
terrible plague. The oracle at Delphi (see
Chapter 21) tells Oedipus that he has to
punish the man who murdered the previous
king Laius. Oedipus determines to do so
despite the warnings of various people.
(During these conversations, Oedipus finds
out that Laius and Jocasta had a child who
was left to be exposed – see Chapter 15 –
but was eventually adopted by others.)
 Eventually, Oedipus discovers that he in fact
murdered Laius in a roadside argument –
and worse, that Laius was his father and 
the queen, Jocasta, his mother. Grief-
stricken, Oedipus blinds himself and says
the following famous words:
Ah God, ah God: all come true and be
known! Let this be the last time that I see
the light of day. Cursed in my parents,
cursed in my marriage, cursed in the blood
I have shed!
Oedipus Tyrannus proves that human beings
cannot escape who they are and that fate is
unavoidable. Oedipus’s fatal flaw is his pride
and arrogance that blinds him to the warnings
of others to stop his search before he uncovers
the tragic truth.

 Comic plots are absurd. By mixing fantasy with elements of real life, 
the Greek comic poets virtually invented satire, the genre that involves
poking fun at the establishment and criticising it using comedy. For
example, in the surviving Greek comedies, men fly away to live in a land
run by birds (The Birds), a sausage seller becomes the chief politician in
Athens (Acharnians), and Euripides and Aeschylus have an imaginary
poetry competition in Hades (The Frogs). 
Aristophanes: Old comic genius 
The most famous of Greek comic poets is Aristophanes (447–385 BC) who
had an amazingly successful career and won many prizes. Quite a number 
of his plays still survive today. 
The plays are coarse and elaborate fantasies that deal with contemporary
issues and very often mock the decisions of Athenian politicians. For 
example:
 In Lysistrata, the women of Athens refuse to have sex with their hus-
bands until they stop the Peloponnesian War. (This strategy seems
about the only thing Athens didn’t try during this long war with 
neighbouring Sparta; see Chapter 8.)
 The Athenian demagogue Kleon (see Chapter 8) tried to prosecute
Aristophanes for slandering Athens in his play Babylonians in 425 BC.
Kleon was unsuccessful, and Aristophanes took his revenge by merci-
lessly mocking Kleon in his next four plays. Kleon would have been 
in the audience for every one of them (Chapter 25 has more on this 
and Kleon)!
The comedies of Aristophanes had a very specific structure with key 
elements: 
 The entry of the chorus (parodos) was always very spectacular with the
actors dancing and singing while wearing extremely elaborate costumes.
 The following agon was the real meat of the play. Two sides debated
issues through songs and speeches. 
 The final key element was the parabasis where the chorus again took
centre stage. The chorus leader directly addressed the audience and
presented a long speech about the ‘big issue’ of the play. (The poet 
also usually left some room for some pleading to the judges to award
him victory!)
Following is an excerpt from the parabasis in Aristophanes’s Wasps, a 
satire on the Athenian jury-courts (see Chapter 7). The chorus leader com-
plains that all the people that collect their jury pay don’t contribute to 
the war effort.
214

It makes us wild to think that those who’ve never raised a hand, or risked 
a single blister to defend their native land can draw their pay with all the
rest: I think that the rule should be, that if you haven’t got a sting you get 
no jury fee!
Aristophanes included a lot of sharp political satire, but he also appealed 
to those looking for cheap laughs. His plays are full of sexual innuendo and
jokes at the expense of members of the audience. Some real-world Athenians
are mocked for being effeminate, people’s wives are slandered, and foreigners
are usually portrayed with ludicrous comic accents.
Audiences at a comedy knew what they were coming to see and, in fact,
expected to see familiar elements in place. Some characters appear again and
again in the plays, in particular the crafty slave. Aristophanes even joked
with the audience about this repetition. At the beginning of his play Frogs, the
slave Xanthias asks his master, ‘What about one of the old gags, sir? I can
usually get a laugh with those.’
The comedy of Aristophanes provided something for everybody: outrageous
spectacle, absurd plots, knowing satire, and jokes about Heracles farting after
too much pea soup. What more could you ask for?
Menander: ‘Alternative’ comedy
Greek comedy didn’t stop with the death of Aristophanes but it did change.
The foremost comic poet after Aristophanes was Menander (341–291 BC).
Menander’s comedies dropped much of the satire that was Aristophanes’s
main thrust and instead were about the lives of ordinary Athenians with plots
based around mistaken identity and overheard conversations. The play that
survives in full is Dyskolos, a witty comedy about a cantankerous old man.
Extending to today: The influence 
of Greek theatre
The plays that the ancient Greeks enjoyed still have tremendous impact 
on today’s stage entertainment – as well as books, television, and film. 
William Shakespeare was well aware of the tragic poets and their impact 
on what he wrote. The mental crises and unwise actions of characters like
Hamlet and Macbeth would have been very recognisable to Aeschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides. 
Ancient Greek comedy has stood the test of time too. The broad playing to 
the audience by the actors and stock characters to be found in Aristophanes’s
215

plays carried on through the Roman theatre and the commedia del arte plays
that were popular during the Renaissance. And satire has become an estab-
lished comic tradition, showcased every day on late-night comedy shows.
Getting Physical: Athletics 
and the Olympic Games
Athletics was big news in ancient Greece. Physical training for boys and
young men was seen as vital for their personal wellbeing and education 
(see Chapter 14). And as most Greek cities defended themselves with citizen
militias, the bodies of the male citizens had to be kept fighting fit. 
For this reason many cities, including Athens, provided a gymnasion (exercise
area) at public expense so that exercise was available to all male citizens and
metics. Many other exercise areas were available in the city, including the
popular palaestra, or wrestling ground. 
The palaestra were like private gyms where richer citizens met and exercised.
They also had other uses: Older Greek men pursued the affections of younger
boys and paid court to them (see Chapter 15) and important social meetings
often took place, in which Greeks made political and business deals. 
Working out at the gym
The modern word gymnasium comes from the Greek gymnasia. This word is
derived from gumnoi, which means ‘completely naked’, because in Greece all
exercise was carried out in the nude. 
Unsurprisingly, only men attended the gymnasia. To the Greeks, athletics 
was hugely competitive; the word athlon itself means ‘prize’. Whatever event
you were taking part in, it was vital that you did everything for victory.
The activities at the gymnasium were fairly standard (see the later section
‘The Olympic schedule’) and included running, chariot-racing, boxing,
wrestling, and some field events such as throwing. All these activities 
produced physical abilities that were very useful for fighting in wars.
The Greeks saw athletic achievement as a fitting subject for poetry, and 
the well-regarded poet Pindar of Boeotia (518–438 BC) wrote a huge amount
about it. The following excerpt comes from a poem celebrating the achieve-
ment of a man called Timodemus in the pankration (an incredibly tough 
fighting sport) at the Nemean Games in 485 BC. Pindar compares the start 
of Timodemus’s athletic career with the beginning of an epic poem.

Just as the women of Homer, the singers of woven verses, most often begin
with Zeus as their prelude, so this man has received a first down-payment of
victory in the sacred games by winning in the grove of Nemean Zeus.
The spirit of competition was alive throughout the ancient Greek world, and
regular international events were held. Most cities held their own games but
the more important international events were the Pythian, Nemean, and
Isthmian Games. 
Bigger than all these, however, were the games at Olympia – the Olympic
Games.
Attending the original Olympic Games
The Olympic Games were hugely influential. They are, arguably, the longest
lasting single event from the ancient world. Every four years between 776 BC
and AD 395 the greatest athletes in the Mediterranean (and sometimes
beyond) gathered together to compete at the town of Olympia.
Like the dramatic festivals (see the earlier section ‘Getting into a festive
mood’), the games were held in honour of a god – in this case Zeus (see
Chapter 20). The games brought huge fortune and fame to Olympia. The 
town eventually constructed a vast complex of temples, stadiums, and other
buildings, the ruins of which you can still visit today (see Chapter 18).
Thousands of people would have flocked to Olympia. They were probably
wealthy because they needed to be able to afford to be away from work for 
a lengthy period of time.
The Greeks were so proud of the Olympic Games that they went as far as
using them as a method of historical dating. Records often refer to events 
as having taken place in ‘the year of the 28th Olympiad’ rather than in a 
specific year.
The Olympic schedule
The events at the Olympics were fairly standard from the first games to the
last. Although the Greeks added some events over time, the main ones were
as follows:
 Boxing: This sport was similar to modern boxing but contestants didn’t
wear gloves and instead fought with leather strapping on their hands. It
was fought until a knockout with no rounds – just one long single bout.
 Discus: This event was a little like the modern shot put because the
ancient Greeks used flat, round stones that weighed about 4 kilograms.
Whoever threw furthest won.
217

 Equestrian: The Olympics also featured some horse-racing events. The
chariot races and horse races were most popular, but there was also 
a mule-cart race that featured very small carts. The Sicilian Greeks 
probably introduced the mule-cart race (they were good at it because 
of mining!), but the event wasn’t popular and the Greeks dropped it 
after 14 games.
 Javelin: This category was an obvious test for a war-related skill,
although the athletes used lighter javelins that were designed to travel 
a long distance rather than penetrate armour. Some sources claim that
athletes regularly achieved throws of more than 90 metres.
 Long jump: This event was much harder than the modern version.
Athletes jumped from a standing start holding weights!
 Pankration: This event was incredibly tough and violent and involved 
a fight in which any style was allowed. Only two things were barred:
biting and eye-gouging. The fights were amazingly fierce, and many 
participants died.
 Pentathlon: This event involved the discus, javelin, long jump, running,
and wrestling. It was really hard work, but if somebody won the first
three events, the authorities cancelled the other two because nobody
else could win.
 Running: Like the modern Olympics, running events were numerous in
the original games and included:
• The stadion, which was the length of the stadium (about 200
metres)
• The diaulos, or ‘there and back again’, which involved running the
length of the stadium and back
• The dolichos, which was a full 12 laps of the stadium
• One additional (and odd) foot-race which involved running the
standard stadion sprint while wearing armour (refer to Chapter 5
for what this armour would have been like).
 Wrestling: Very different from the WWF today! Wrestling was very
formal. The winner was whoever forced his opponent’s back, hips, or
shoulders to the ground. The successful fighter was known as the 
triakter or ‘trebler’ because you needed to cause three falls to win the
contest.
Jam-packed competition
The Olympic Games themselves took place over only five days with an 
opening and closing ceremony. Each day featured a different group of events.
For example, all the fighting disciplines took place on the fourth day. The
final day saw the procession of all the victors to the Temple of Zeus, where
they were crowned with wreaths of wild olives and showered with leaves.

The laurel crown was all that the victors won – that and the eternal fame of
being an Olympic victor. Sponsors of other non-Olympic events offered 
material and financial prizes, but nothing was prized as highly as an Olympic
victory – rather like an Olympic gold medal today.
Cheats never prosper
Although the fame for winning in the Olympics was unsurpassed, the shame
at being caught cheating was equally intense. The games were policed by a
group of soldiers called the alytai, who publicly flogged anybody caught
cheating. Additionally, the names of the winners were inscribed on stone
tablets around the Olympic stadium, and so were the names of cheats. 
Heralding the new Olympics
The ancient Olympics probably came to an end in around AD 390, when the
Byzantine emperor, who was a Christian, banned all pagan festivals. Several
attempts were made to revive the games, and athletics carried on elsewhere
throughout the region. However, the next official Olympics held in Athens
wasn’t until 1896. The instigator was a French nobleman called Baron Pierre
de Coubertin.
One of the main features and symbols of the Olympics nowadays is the torch
and the journey that it goes on to arrive at the games from the last venue to
the next (in 2008, Athens to Beijing). Most people think that this is an ancient
tradition, but it isn’t! The torch was only used in the ancient Olympics as a
baton on a six-horse relay race called the lampadedromia that took place as
part of the opening ceremony. De Coubertin adopted the torch because he
thought it was appropriate for the revival of an ancient tradition. Remember
that trivia when you’re watching the next Olympic opening ceremony!

Chapter 16: Plays and Pugilism: Enjoying Ancient Greek Entertainment 
Girls just wanna have fun!
Although women were excluded from the gym-
nasia in cities, they did partake in athletics and
even had their own festival at the Olympic
Games – The Heraea, in honour of Hera, the wife
of Zeus (see Chapter 20).
The Heraea featured only one event, a foot race
that was 25 metres shorter than the male stadion.
It seems strange to cut it short in this way but it
emphasises the tendency of the Greeks to put
limits on opportunities for female achievement.
The inequalities didn’t stop there either. Married
women were banned from attending the games,
in case all the naked flesh tempted them to stray!
Curiously, young virgin girls were allowed to
attend – perhaps so they could check out future
husbands.

The greatest Olympian: Milo of Croton
The ancient Olympics featured many great
champions, but the greatest of them all was
probably Milo of Croton. A great wrestler, he
won at five successive Olympic Games (a 20-
year period) as well as another 25 at the other
festivals. 
Milo favoured a method of training that involved
carrying around a four-year-old cow for a
number of months to build up his shoulder mus-
cles. Apparently, he then ate the animal – in one
sitting. Another story says that Milo downed
three big jars of wine (about 9 litres!) for a bet. 
Unfortunately, Milo died when he attempted to
split open a tree trunk with his bare hands and
got them stuck. He was trapped there and in the
night wild animals attacked and ate him.
Whether these stories are true or not, Milo was
a phenomenal Olympian and probably the great-
est of all time.

W
hat is art? It’s an eternal question that nobody can ever really answer.
Today, art comes in many different forms – painting, sculpture, pho-
tography, printing, film, and digital, to name just a few. Each art form offers a
way of interpreting the world. Different people find different forms important
or moving for different reasons. 
In ancient Greece the types of art that existed were rather more formal and
subject to rules. They fell into distinct categories, or mediums. The most
obvious examples of ancient Greek art are sculptures and painted items,
including plates, cups, and vases – which I look at in this chapter. Other
forms of art existed too – like interior painting – but most of this work has
been lost.
Rather than forms and mediums, however, what’s most recognisable about
Greek art is its subject matter. The sculptures and painted works are domi-
nated by the gods and heroes of Greek mythology (see Chapter 20 for more
on this cast of characters). Other themes developed and began to appear
later. By the Hellenistic period (see Chapters 10 and 11), artists began to take
an interest in the ordinary world around them. 
Loads of Greek art survives in hundreds of museums all over the world. In
this chapter, I cover the basic forms, techniques, and details that can help
you better understand the meaning behind all those ‘naked men with 
broken noses’.

Defining Greek Art 
The ancient Greeks didn’t really have a word that meant ‘art’. The closest
equivalent was tekhne, which was more like ‘skill’. So the Greeks didn’t think
of art as an abstract, inspired thing, more as a craft or technical ability.
In fact, many of the items that modern eyes would classify as Greek art were
not really thought of as art objects back in the times when they were created.
The Greeks used the plates and bowls that museums now display in glass
cases to eat their dinner from, and they used the craters (like a cup) for drink-
ing. In a sense, these were everyday objects to the Greeks. (Clearly, some
plates are better than others, and the Greeks would’ve appreciated and paid
more money for those with a superior design – just as you do today.)
Scholars classify Greek art into several periods, all of which date from after
the Mycenaean period which finished around 1200 BC. Here’s a rough guide:
 The Geometric period (1100–700 BC): This earliest form of Greek art
consists mostly of pottery with repeated geometric patterns and few
representations of people or figures.
 The Archaic period (700 BC–480 BC): This art is heavily influenced by
Egypt and Asia. Sculptural representations of people and animals are
notably Eastern-looking. See the later section ‘Analysing Archaic 
sculpture: Naked Egyptians’.
 The Classical period (480–330 BC): Art from this period features 
idealised and beautiful representations of men and gods, very often
naked with an emphasis on athletic physiques and postures. See the
later section ‘Contemplating Classical sculpture: Even better than the
real thing’.
222
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
Where did that come from?
One weird thing about Greek art is how it
changed all of a sudden around about 500 BC.
As Figure 17-1 shows, it was almost as if the
Greeks had decided to start producing fantas-
tic lifelike sculptures at the drop of a hat
between the Archaic and Classical periods! 
For years people wondered where this sudden
expertise came from. The relatively recent work
of scholars and archaeologists, notably Sir
Arthur Evans (1851–1941), points to the
Mycenaean culture (see Chapter 2). The dis-
covery of the Mycenaean world meant that his-
torians could link an earlier Greek-speaking,
art-producing people with the ancient Greeks.
Although Mycenaean art was very different,
being much less accurate in its portrayal of
people and objects, the connection proved that
Greek art wasn’t just a sudden invention.

 The Hellenistic period (330–30 BC): Greater realism and an interest in
ordinary subjects typify art from this period. See the later section
‘Surveying Hellenistic sculpture: Art mirrors life’.
Surveying Greek Sculpture: 
Men with No Noses
Greek sculpture is the most famous form of art from the ancient world. Their
big statues of men and gods with bits missing have influenced sculptors and
painters for hundreds of years. Here’s the story behind one of the ancient
Greek’s greatest artistic contributions.
Sculpting, old-school style
For the ancient Greeks, sculpting was a definite skill that was handed down
through families. It was a full-time job and a very respected trade. Sculptors
usually worked on their own although on large projects, such as a big statue
for a temple, they might employ other sculptors to work with them.
Greek sculptors worked in two forms – marble and bronze:
 Marble sculptures were cut from large stone blocks. It was incredibly
intricate work; with just a few incorrect strokes the sculptor could ruin 
a complete image.
 Cast bronze sculptures were even trickier than marble ones. The 
sculptor produced a clay or plaster model into which he poured molten
bronze. After the metal cooled, he finished the piece, removing any
blemishes and buffing the bronze. The final effect was very bright, 
shining almost like gold. Bronze statues nowadays look a little dull in
colour due to the effects of time. The ancient Greeks, however, kept 
their bronze pieces polished and glowing. Bronze was much more 
expensive than marble and many popular bronze pieces were copied 
in marble.
These large statues were used in many ways. Some were set up in public
(such as those of successful athletes); others were privately owned by 
rich householders. The most common use, however, was to decorate large
public buildings like temples (see Chapter 18).

Analysing Archaic sculpture: 
Naked Egyptians 
The earliest examples of ancient Greek sculpture come from the Archaic
period (700–480 BC). These early Greek statues were like those the Egyptians
produced, but they differed in two crucial respects: 
 Greek statues were free standing, rather than sculpted onto a wall or
column as is typical for Egyptian art of the time.
 The Greek figures were completely naked whereas the Egyptians 
preferred to show male figures wearing a kilt or skirt over their nether
regions.
Take a look at the sculpture in Figure 17-1. This kouros, which means the
naked figure of a male youth, was made around 550 BC. The human form is
quite realistic and is about two-thirds the size of an actual human figure. 
The skill of an ancient Greek sculptor was in his ability to accurately depict
the human body, its contours, and its muscles.
Figure 17-1:
A kouros.
224
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

During this period, sculptors also produced female figures known as korai.
These figures are much the same, apart from the crucial difference that they
are fully clothed. This fits with the male Greek view that women should be
modest and kept concealed (refer to Chapter 14).
The pose of the kouros is very rigid but also very symmetrical. This position-
ing became the standard pose in the Archaic period. The figure’s stance is
particularly noteworthy – he looks like he’s stepping forward. This is a signifi-
cant difference from rigid Egyptian sculptures and is an early attempt at por-
traying movement. The depiction of the face is still very Egyptian though:
large eyes and hair in ringlets. Check out The Ancient Egyptians For Dummies
(Wiley) by Charlotte Booth for more on the Egyptian aesthetic. 
Contemplating Classical sculpture: 
Even better than the real thing 
During the Classical period (480–330 BC), the Greeks raced ahead of other
ancient civilisations in their ability to portray lifelike figures. The idea of
mimesis, or imitation of life, became an important ideal. A sculpture was con-
sidered a success if it was close to life but also represented an aspirational
image of how men and women potentially looked.
The sculpture in Figure 17-2 is a copy of one created around 444 BC by a 
man called Polyclitus. It’s a life-size representation of an athletic young man
(a doryphoros, or spear bearer). Look at the differences between this and 
the Archaic kouros. The subject is the same but the treatment is completely
different:
 Both sculptures convey movement in the pose, but the weight of the
entire Classical figure is now carried on one leg. 
225
Chapter 17: Depicting Men, Women, and Gods in Art
What a beautiful fake!
Many of the Greek sculptures that survive aren’t
actually Greek at all. Very often these sculptures
are high-class Roman copies of Greek originals.
In particular, surviving marble pieces are fre-
quently Roman versions of bronze Greek sculp-
tures. The originals are usually lost to history as
people melted down the bronze pieces to make
other things. But because the originals were
famous and celebrated, people wanted their own
copies. Art lovers today are really fortunate that
the Romans loved Greek sculpture, because at
least copies exist to look at.

 The muscles on the body of the Classical statue are a lot more defined –
the kind of physique that it would take hours in the gymnasium to 
produce! 
 The Classical sculpture’s face is different too. He’s more expressive, 
concentrating on something yet lost in thought. His features are much
more Western than those of the kouros.
Women in art
Another important development during the Classical Period was that female
figures were frequently portrayed naked, like their male counterparts. For the
most part, these nude female figures represented Aphrodite, the goddess of
sexual love, often shown emerging from a bath. 
Other goddesses sculpted during this period (Athena, Demeter, and Hera
were popular subjects) are often portrayed wearing clothes. Getting the 
drapery right was considered a massively important skill on the part of an
artist, and the folds in the robes are incredibly realistic on sculptures from
the Classical period.

Celebrity artists
During the Classical period sculptures became hugely popular as a way of
decorating temples and other public buildings (see Chapter 18), and artists
producing the most perfect works became celebrities themselves. Here are
the most famous Greek sculptors:
 Pheidias (circa 460–400 BC): Probably the most famous of Greek sculp-
tors, Pheidias had a permanent workshop in the sanctuary complex at
Olympia for which he made the famous statue of Zeus that sat in the
temple dedicated to him. The statue is long gone but Figure 17-3 shows a
representation. He also worked on the Parthenon decorations (see
Chapter 18). He was killed by the people of Elis who were jealous of his
work at Olympia. Rather harsh critics, the Eleans.
 Polyclitus of Argos (circa 460–410 BC): Polyclitus worked exclusively 
in bronze and was most famous for his statues of mortals (like the
Doryphorus in Figure 17-2). He is credited as being responsible for the
creation of the standard form of depicting muscles in movement.
 Myron (circa 470–420 BC): Known as the great experimenter, Myron
produced figures of gods and mortals in new and unusual poses. Myron
was one of the first artists to depict people in actual movement. The
best example is the Discobolus, or discus thrower, which is shown in
Figure 17-4.

 Lysippus of Sicyon (circa 370–315): Lysippus produced a huge 
variety of pieces at the end of the Classical era and the beginning of the
Hellenistic. Mostly, these were new and different versions of gods, but
his most famous image is the head of Alexander the Great (Figure 17-5),
which ancient sources said was the most lifelike portrayal of the king.

Bright-eyed and colourful
Two important elements in Greek sculpture of
all periods were the use of colour and painted
details. These days, when you visit a museum
or look at photos of surviving figures, you see
faded bronze and marble forms with big, open,
sightless eyes. These sculptures were originally
very different: Eyeballs and pupils were painted
as well as the clothes (drapery) and any
weapons or other items. Statues of the gods
were meant to be intimidating; in their original
painted form they would have been. Covered
with red, black, and gold paint the images were
meant to emphasise the awesome power of 
the gods.

Surveying Hellenistic sculpture: 
Art mirrors life 
During the Hellenistic period (330–30 BC) a new aesthetic emerged. After
Alexander the Great’s conquests broadened the horizons of the Greek world,
the subjects and representations that sculptors chose changed too. While
they still produced images of heroes and gods, they also developed an inter-
est in more human subjects of a different type, such as children and older
adults, than the idealised youths of the Classical period.
Although works still reflected an accurate portrayal of the human form,
depictions became less stylised and more realistic. One of the most famous
Hellenistic sculptures is of a drunken old woman – a subject and treatment
that would never have interested earlier sculptors.
Take a look at the bronze sculpture of a boxer in Figure 17-6. This figure 
was produced in the second century BC. Although he’s an athlete, he looks
tired after a bout – like you’d expect him to be. His physique is almost over-
developed, like a WWF wrestler, and if you look closely you can see his
broken nose and damaged ‘cauliflower ears’. This sculpture has some of the
idea of mimesis (see the earlier section ‘Contemplating Classical sculpture:
Even better than the real thing’) without anything aspirational. This is a
worn-out, past-his-prime boxer, after one bout too many.

Inviting the Gods to Dinner: 
Greek Vase Painting
Along with bronze and marble sculpture, the other major area of ancient
Greek art was the painting of pottery. Clay was one of the biggest natural
resources in Greece, used for roof-tiles, small sculpted figures, and house
bricks. The quality of the clay varied depending on where you were in 
ancient Greece but the skill in using the potting wheel and correctly firing 
the pot was more influential on the quality of the finished product than the
clay itself. 
The trade of pottery was one of the most prevalent practices and the closest
that the Greeks had to a modern manufacturing industry. Greek pottery 
was exported all over the Mediterranean. Different regions developed their
own individual styles, some of which were quite sought after. Some of the
vase-painters became renowned, although never as much as the sculptors
because sculpture was perceived as being a much higher art form. In most
cases painters also made the pots themselves.

Getting into shape
Although the patterns and designs on pottery varied, the actual objects
themselves took the following forms:
 Amphora: This was the standard type of big vessel used to transport
large quantities of wine or oil. The name came from its distinctive
double-handle design.
 Crater: This vessel looked like a large cup, but the Greeks used it as a
mixing bowl where water was combined with wine.
 Skyphos: This standard cup form usually featured a handle on each
side. Often the bottom inside was also decorated with a painted image.
 Lekythos: These small delicate jars were used to keep oil or, occasion-
ally, perfume although this was usually sold in much smaller quantities.
Many other popular pottery shapes existed during the age of ancient Greece,
including numerous different types of vases such as hydria and even wine
coolers known as psykters. 
The beautifully decorated pieces that survive in museums are generally
examples of the ancient Greeks’ most precious items that probably weren’t
for everyday use. Think of these as the equivalent of the best dinner set 
that you get out for special occasions.
Vase painting basics
Just like sculpture (see the earlier section ‘Surveying Greek Sculpture: Men
with No Noses’), the development of Greek vase painting went through a
number of very clear phases, as the following sections explain.
Early vase painting (1050–700 BC)
Like sculpture, very early Greek vases mix geometric patterns with very
Eastern-looking, Egyptian-style depictions of humans and animals. Sometimes
the illustrations involved fantastical creatures from mythology such as the
monsters that fought with Heracles (described in Chapter 20).
Black-figure painting (600 BC onwards)
The earliest form of truly Greek painting is known as black-figure painting.
Clay red vases from this period are decorated with figures in silhouette 
usually depicted in black with red or white highlighting. The artist delicately
incised the details onto the painted figures and into the clay. 
231
Chapter 17: Depicting Men, Women, and Gods in Art
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Modern scholars attribute the development of this style of painting to the
city of Corinth (see the Cheat Sheet map) in about 720 BC. By the middle of
the seventh century BC artists throughout the region used the technique. 
The most popular subjects during this period are inspired by mythological
stories. The images are usually depicted frieze style, meaning that one elabo-
rate illustration stretches all around the pot and shows figures interacting
with each other. Vivid and complex scenes capturing a range of emotions
were often included in the illustrations. 
Figure 17-7 shows black-figure details on an amphora that was painted by a
man called Exekias in around 540 BC. The vessel shows the Greek warrior
Achilles fighting the Amazon queen Penthesilea during the Trojan War (see
Chapter 20). According to the myth, as Achilles struck the killing blow, his
eyes met Penthesilea’s and he fell in love with her. The painter has managed
to convey this complex and poignant moment by using a simple silhouette
technique.
Another thing to notice about the vessel in 17-7 is Penthesilea’s very white
face. During this period women were often painted with white faces, whereas
men were portrayed totally in black. The reason was that upper class ancient
Greek women were expected to spend most of their day indoors (see Chapter
14). Men were tanned by the heat and the sun, but women remained pale.

Red-figure painting (circa 525 BC onwards)
Around 525 BC a new style of painting – known as red-figure painting – was
developed in Athens. This technique was a complete reversal of black-figure
painting, with the background now black and all the figures appearing in 
the red of the clay. This approach allowed the detailing to be much more
intricate as details were now painted onto the clay instead of being incised 
as with black-figure work. Over time, the depictions of human anatomy and
clothing become more precise – like the effects achieved by sculptors of 
this era. 
Artists could also create much more complex scenes. Notably, red-figure
painters began including more than one image on a piece, sometimes show-
ing two or more scenes that may have some kind of linking theme.
A red-figure skyphos was painted around 470 BC showing the young Heracles
on his way to school followed by an old woman. The image is incredibly
detailed, and you can easily make out the difference in age of the two charac-
ters. Heracles stands in the style of Classical sculpture (see the earlier sec-
tion ‘Contemplating Classical sculpture: Even better than the real thing’), and
you can even see the tattoos on the old woman, suggesting that she may be
from Thrace where this was a common practice. 
White-ground painting (circa 475 BC onwards)
One last style of vase painting was inspired by a technique used by painters
working on large-scale interior projects. Although little of this type of white-
ground painting survives, historians believe artists covered interior walls or
wooden panels with white paint or plaster to produce a neutral background. 
During the fifth century BC, some painters began to adopt this style for 
working on vases. The most common use for white-ground painting on vases
was to decorate the lekythos that the Greeks buried with their dead. These
lekythos were filled with oil and accompanied the deceased to the under-
world. (See Chapter 21 for more on ancient Greek burial practices.) Most
white-ground vases haven’t survived very well because the vessels weren’t
meant for frequent handling. 
233
Chapter 17: Depicting Men, Women, and Gods in Art
Apelles: The lost master 
The most famous of the white-ground painters
was a man called Apelles of Colophon, who was
active in the fourth century BC. Later writers
enthuse over Apelles’s genius and talent for
mimesis (see the section ‘Contemplating
Classical sculpture: Even better than the real
thing’), claiming that his works were so lifelike
that people tried to eat the fruit he painted and
horses neighed at his equine images. Sadly,
modern historians must take the ancient
scribes’ word for it; nothing of Apelles’s work
survives.

Finding Beauty Elsewhere: 
Other Arts and Crafts
Of course, the Greeks didn’t just produce pots and sculptures. They were
expert at a number of other art forms:
 Clay figures were immensely popular. These mini sculptures followed
the aesthetics of their large-scale counterparts. See the earlier section
‘Surveying Greek Sculpture: Men with No Noses’. 
 Decorative bronzes were cast in the same way as larger metal sculp-
tures. These pieces looked a bit like small versions of the friezes 
and metopes (smaller sculpted scenes) on temples (described in
Chapter 18). 
Smaller items like these would have been used as ornaments in houses 
and were also sometimes given as small offerings to the gods, possibly to 
represent the person that was asking for help.
The following sections cover a few other artistic endeavours of the ancient
Greeks. 
Getting dressed: Clothing
Dress-making and fashion weren’t really art forms in ancient Greece, but the
garments Greeks wore while going about their daily business had a beauty
and simplicity that continues to inspire designers even today.
Materials
Most ancient Greeks – male and female, rich and poor – wore pretty much the
same items of clothing. What did vary was the quality of the material used. 
Most garments were made of wool, although in some cases linen was used.
(Linen was more common for tunics or underclothes; wool must have been a
bit itchy for a hot day on the plain of Attica!) White was the standard colour
but the Greeks also dyed their wool (Chapter 13 has more details). Wealthier
Greek women could afford to wear silk, which was imported from Asia Minor
on the silk route from the East. 
Types of garment
Nearly all clothes took the form of a cloak or mantle – a single piece of mater-
ial that could be worn in different ways. This garment was always sleeveless,
but often during cold weather it was worn over the top of a tunic that served
as an undershirt. 
234
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

The standard garment for women was the peplos, which was a kind of com-
bined cloak and tunic. It was a large, square piece of cloth, the top third of
which the woman folded over and pinned on her shoulders. Most surviving
artistic depictions of goddesses show them formally attired in peploi. 
Women also often wore veils when they were outside to modestly hide their
faces from men. The ancient Greek word for veil literally means ‘little roof’;
even though women were outside, they were still kept inside the oikos,
or home.
The Greeks didn’t wear trousers and thought them effeminate when worn 
by men. They were popular in the Persian Empire, and when Alexander the
Great began wearing them after conquering Persia (see Chapter 11), this 
fashion choice proved unpopular with his Macedonian generals.
By the Hellenistic period both men and women wore simpler formal garments
known as an himation. The himation was a very long piece of material (up to 3
metres by 2 metres) that you draped around the body and usually supported
over the left arm. The gods in the Parthenon sculptures (see Chapter 18)
wear them and the Romans later based the toga on this versatile garment. 
Looking sharp: Jewellery
In addition to sculpture and vase painting, the other great manufacturing
craft in ancient Greece, and elsewhere in the ancient world in general, was
the production of jewellery. 
The Greeks used precious metals (gold and silver) and semi-precious 
stones such as bezels in large quantities to produce rings, earrings, neck-
laces, and bracelets in designs that are still very recognisable today. The
fashion for setting a precious stone in a metal band (like a modern ring)
became fashionable only around the end of the fifth century BC. 
Golden combs and hair slides were also very popular. Sometimes they fea-
tured small scenes of tiny figures not much more than a few centimetres high.
Incredibly skilled and detailed work, these combs were very expensive.
A great number of examples of this work still survives in museums around
the world. They’re hugely delicate and personal items that give a real sense
of having been touched and cared for by people from 2,500 years ago.

Building Beautiful Greek
Architecture
In This Chapter
 Admiring the Greek temples
 Constructing and embellishing the temples
 Extending Greek design to other buildings
T
his chapter is about more than the types of structures and building 
materials favoured by the ancient Greeks; it’s about architecture.
Architecture is the art of building, the design and construction of buildings
that ensure that they’re technically correct and aesthetically pleasing. In
other words, architecture is about making sure that buildings look good 
and stay up.
Of all the things that the ancient Greeks left behind, their buildings are the
most obvious. You can find great big chunks of these structures – some still
in surprisingly good condition – lying around all over the Mediterranean. 
And museums around the globe have enshrined several buildings or portions
of buildings. 
Even more apparent than the physical remains is the influence of Greek 
architecture on subsequent buildings. Indeed, many buildings in some of the
world’s most famous cities instantly remind you of Greek temples – such as
the White House in Washington for example.
In this chapter, I look at how the Greeks built temples and other public 
structures, why they built them, and what to look for when you’re standing 
in front of one.

Building for the Masses: 
Ancient Greek Temples
The Greeks loved building – and building temples in particular. The council of
government (refer to Chapter 4) usually paid for these elaborately decorated
structures, which were used to make political statements. The Greeks tended
to build smaller private buildings like houses or shops out of whatever was
available and not to any particular design. See Chapter 14 for more on these
day-to-day structures.
Appreciating the role of the temple
The temple was a vital part of the Greek polis or city. A temple’s main pur-
pose was to honour the god that it was dedicated to, such as Zeus, Poseidon,
or Apollo. Each temple normally contained a large cult statue of the god
within the central room, or cella. The statue was much bigger than life-size
and could be as tall as 10 or 15 metres (see ‘Going back to the temple’s 
beginnings’ later in this chapter for a plan of a typical ancient Greek temple).
The temple was literally thought of as the house of the god. When you entered
the temple, you were in the presence of that deity. That’s partly why the
Greeks used such massive statues – to create feelings of awe and fear. Temples
were open to all and people would flee there for sanctuary in times of crisis.
Festivals, sacrifices, and ceremonies all took place at the temple. Temples
were often part of a whole sanctuary complex in which they stood alongside
treasuries, or small buildings used to house gifts made to the gods. A good
example of a sanctuary complex is the Acropolis in Athens, which was home
to four different temples (dedicated to Athena and Poseideon) and also
served as the stronghold of the city in times of trouble.

Speedy builders
The Greeks really did love their temples. Modern
scholars have added up the number of temples
constructed between 599 and 301 BC, the height
of the temple-building boom:
 Greeks living on the mainland built around 53
temples.
 Across the whole Greek world, Greeks 
constructed over 120 temples. 
Perhaps these figures don’t sound that impres-
sive, but when you think of the cost involved, the
pretty crude tools, and the enormous effort
required, this output is the equivalent of building
a new Wembley Stadium or Millennium Dome
every two years or so.

Despite the temple’s civic functions, each building was really about the wor-
ship of the god to which it was dedicated. In a way, the vast expense of build-
ing a temple was a kind of tribute to the god to start with. Greek religion was
based around the idea of giving gifts to the gods and hoping that good things
happened to you as a result. You can read more about these spiritual beliefs
in Chapter 22.
Going back to the temple’s beginnings
Greek architecture developed very much along the same lines as Greek his-
tory. The Minoans (covered in Chapter 2) were great builders but they didn’t
tend to build structures exclusively for religious purposes. During the Dark
Ages the Greeks seemed to build very few massive structures. It wasn’t until
the seventh century BC that the Greeks began the large scale construction 
of temples.
Between 650 and 500 BC the classic form of the Greek temple started to
emerge as towns and cities throughout the Mediterranean began to construct
their temples in fairly uniform style. The temples that were built during this
period were all classified as hekatompedon, which meant ‘hundred footer’. As
temples were a great source of local pride, building anything that was smaller
was unthinkable. The temples also all followed the same plan of a box within
a box, as Figure 18-1 shows.
The temple in Figure 18-1 is a rectangle surrounded by massive round
columns. Within the rectangle is another smaller rectangle that made up an
interior room. This area was called a cella and was where the business of the
temple took place. Often the cella had an external porch leading into it, like
the one in Figure 18-1. It was the innermost sanctum of the temple where
offerings were made.

This basic format remained pretty much unchanged for the whole of Greek
history. Part of the reason for this consistency was the building techniques
involved (see the later section ‘Making it happen: Building tools and 
techniques’). 
Other forms of temple design did develop and the Greeks introduced 
new materials, but this rectangle-within-a-rectangle plan was the standard.
Originally, these temples were probably constructed out of wood, but by the
early sixth century BC the Greeks were using stone, most commonly marble.
Evolving style: Three architectural orders 
Although the design of Greek temples was incredibly regular, room still
existed for expansion and elaboration of the basic form. In fact, any big
temple project was a chance for a city to show off its wealth and artistry. 
The way that temples were decorated and adorned led to the development 
of three notable styles, or architectural orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.
Doric and Ionic were based around the two major regions of Greece (see
Chapter 3). Doric mainly referred to the mainland of Greece, and Ionic was
‘Ionian’ and referred to the western coast of Asia Minor. The Corinthian
style was attributed to a sculptor and architect called Callimachus who was
active in the fifth century BC and was alleged to have come from the city 
of Corinth.

Part III: Living a Greek Life 
The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
Some Greek buildings were so impressive that
they even made it onto the list of the Seven
Wonders of the World! Various ancient writers
made lists of seven wonders, including the
Greek historian Herodotus (see Chapter 22). In
fact, the word the Greeks used to describe
these wondrous buildings was thaumatai,
which literally means ‘must see’! Here’s
Herodotus’s list in full:
 Colossus of Rhodes
 Great Pyramid of Giza
 Hanging Gardens of Babylon
 Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus
 Pharos (Lighthouse) of Alexandria
 Statue of Zeus at the Temple of Zeus in
Olympia
 Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
As you can see, after the Great Pyramid and the
Hanging Gardens, the Greeks feature quite
heavily in the list with five entries. Then again, it
was a Greek who compiled the list! 
Most interesting for historians is the Temple of
Artemis at the Greek city of Ephesus on the
coast of Asia Minor. Today, only the base and a
few columns of this structure survive, but this
temple was considered to be the best example
of its kind.

These styles developed during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. They
weren’t strict ways of building but rather styles that architects of the day felt
able to experiment with. 
As you can see by the three temple columns shown in Figure 18-2, the 
differences between the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian styles are fairly clear.
The biggest design differences are in the capital (the top portion of the
column) and the entablature (the structure that sits on top of the column): 
 Doric columns feature a very simple stone capital in two pieces that
looks like a bowl with a flat block on top.
 Ionic columns include a carved, curling block that looks a bit like the
horns of a ram. Underneath this block is a decorative pattern that some
people call ‘egg and dart’. 
 Corinthian columns have a far more ornate design that mimic the look
of sprouting Acanthus leaves. The thinner column is more like Ionic 
than Doric.

to style it in, how did you go about building it? Read on.

Constructing Temples
The most important thing about any new temple project was choosing the
site. Usually, the Greeks built a new temple in a sacred place like a sanctuary
complex (a site with a lot of temples and religious buildings), but it was often
also the most conspicuous place in the city. 
The greatest temple in Athens was the Parthenon dedicated to Athena and
built on the site of the Acropolis, on a massive hill that dominated the 
landscape. Similarly, the Greeks built many temples in Greece and Asia Minor
overlooking the sea or in other commanding and beautiful locations.
Bearing the cost
Building a temple wasn’t cheap. The cost was met by the public purse and
sometimes donations from rich citizens. For a temple to be built in ancient
Athens, the ekklesia (refer to Chapter 4) had to approve and budget for the
project before the builders broke a single stone. The ekklesia then set up a
supervisory committee for the project and appointed a chief architect. 
For an idea of the costs involved, consider the Parthenon in Athens. This
building cost 469 silver talents to build. To give you some context, the cost 
of building and equipping a trireme warship such as those in the Athenian
fleet was 1 silver talent. Ouch!
Selecting an architect
The role of the architect was crucial. The position was a hugely responsible
one, combining the roles of designer, foreman, and accountant. Not only did
the architect design the building, but he also supervised its construction on
site, hired the workforce, purchased materials, and ensured that the whole
thing came in on budget. 
But despite their enormous responsibilities, the Greeks still viewed architects
as artisans rather than artists.
Finessing the design
Architects designed temples according to mathematical calculations rather
than modelling. For example, if the temple required more columns or wider
gaps between them, the architect simply had to adjust his calculations
accordingly. Another major issue was the entasis, or contour, of the columns
(in basic terms, how much wider the columns were at the bottom than the
242
Part III: Living a Greek Life 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

top). Architects had to go through careful calculations to ensure that the
columns could support the weight of tons of stone. And if the architect got
his sums wrong, the temple would fall down! 
Of course, construction wasn’t quite that haphazard. The fairly standard
form of temple design (see the earlier section ‘Going back to the temple’s
beginnings’) meant that architects worked within fairly standard guidelines. 
Hiring the workforce
Architects managed hundreds of different workers in a temple-building 
project. They hired skilled artisans and craftsman, along with manual 
labourers and prisoners of war used as forced labour. 
When a major project was under way workers came from far and wide
because they knew that work would be available for years to come. The
Parthenon was proposed in 447 BC, and 15 years later it was finally 
completed!
Animals were used to transport materials and equipment. For example,
during the building of the Parthenon around 400 oxen a day were used to
transport materials.
Making it happen: Building 
tools and techniques
Ancient Greek tools and building techniques were pretty basic – which makes
it all the more impressive that they managed to erect such huge, elaborately
embellished edifices. 
One issue that all ancient Greek builders dealt with was the lack of concrete
(it wasn’t discovered until early in the Roman period, during the first century
BC). That’s why Greek architects were so keen on columns; these structures
helped support the massive weight of the buildings’ roofs.
Just getting the materials together was difficult enough. Every temple
required thousands of cubic metres of stone to be quarried and, given the
weight and transportation difficulties, the quarry needed to be close by. 
The Greeks preferred to use marble, but this could be ruinously expensive.
More often they used plain stone and then covered it with painted plaster 
so that it resembled marble.
Each individual block had to be prepared (that is, shaped for its purpose by
carving and hammering) on site and then slotted together. Instead of being
fabricated of one long tube of stone, columns were made of different blocks
243
Chapter 18: Building Beautiful Greek Architecture

called drums that were fixed together with plugs coated with lead to fill any
gaps. This work had to be spot on, otherwise the curvature would be wrong
and the column wouldn’t be able to support weight. 
Moving the stones was difficult and dangerous. For the most part, a human-
powered crane involving fairly simple pulley systems and lots of manpower
lifted the stones into the appropriate area, and then men levered them 
into position. 
Getting your message across 
through decoration
After the temple structure was up, part of the building’s statement was 
made: The size and spectacular position of the building no doubt impressed
many people. However, the Greeks conveyed more clever messages via the
decoration of the temple. 
Intriguing entablatures and more
Like everything else to do with architecture and temple building, the decora-
tion of temples followed a fairly uniform set of rules. The main areas of 
decoration were above the columns in the series of sections known as the
entablature. Figure 18-2 earlier in this chapter shows two examples of 
entablature.
The major decorative areas were as follows:
 Frieze: On Ionic temples the frieze often displayed a long, relief sculp-
ture that showcased a consistent theme such as a procession or a 
continuous battle scene.
 Metope: On Doric temples this space was occupied alternately by
triglyphs (triple-grooved panels) and empty panels that could be filled 
by relief sculptures called metopes. Often each end of the temple 
featured a different theme.
 Pediment: The pediment was often used as a space for large scale 
sculptures, usually massive, larger-than-life versions of the gods.
Like the sculptures I discuss in Chapter 17, the temples were colourfully
painted – even if they were constructed of marble. The backgrounds of the
metopes and pediment sculptures were painted, as well as the triglyphs and
some details on the columns. The paints’ bold colours (probably brighter
colours like red, gold, yellow and lighter blue) would have contrasted 
beautifully with the stark white of the remaining marble or stone.

The Parthenon: 230 feet of propaganda!
The decorations of the Parthenon are a great example of ancient Greek 
architecture, construction, and decoration. The Greeks constructed the
building over 15 years during Athens’s greatest period of supremacy, 
immediately before the start of the Peloponnesian War (see Chapter 7). 
They built the Parthenon to replace a temple burned down by the Persians 
in the fifth century BC (refer to Chapter 6). This new building celebrates 
the superiority of the Athenian empire and its leading role in defeating the
Persians at Marathon and elsewhere. It’s a brilliantly conceived programme
of decoration.
Everything about this amazing building fits with the purpose of the temple 
as a place of worship and also as an expression of Athens’s wealth and 
superiority. 
 The temple was dedicated to Athena, the patron goddess of Athens, and
a massive statue of her dominated the inner building within the cella. 
 Because the Parthenon is a Doric temple it doesn’t feature an external
frieze, but the inner building had a frieze running around it that depicted
the Panathenaiac festival that took place in honour of Athena every 
four years. 
 The building’s pediment sculptures honoured Athena as well. At one end
of the temple, a scene showed all the Olympian gods at rest, and the
other end showed a scene from the story where Athena battled with
Poseidon for the right to be patron deity of Athens.
 The metopes show various scenes of Greeks fighting foreign mythologi-
cal enemies like Amazons and Lapiths. These images are a not-so-subtle
demonstration of Greek superiority over foreigners. 
You can still see the Parthenon in a fairly good state. The ruins of the temple
are there in Athens although much of the decoration has been taken off and
is preserved in the Acropolis Museum in Athens and the British Museum 
in London.
Building More than Temples 
As Greek cities developed, so did the types of public buildings that were
designed and constructed. Although temples continued to dominate, the
Greeks did build other communal structures.
When you look at some Greek ruins today, you may have difficulty telling the
difference between temples and other buildings. The similarities are because
Greek architects used many of the same techniques from temple-building 
to construct other types of building, including agoras, stoas, stadiums, and
theatres. 
245
Chapter 18: Building Beautiful Greek Architecture

Agoras
The agora was the centrepiece of a Greek city. The word doesn’t have an
exact translation – the closest modern equivalent is ‘town square’. (In the
Roman world, the agora became the forum.) 
The agora was where the citizen body gathered to talk, buy, and sell, and
sometimes to protest or vote. Essentially, it was a large open space, but 
over time buildings were added because the activities that went on needed
space for administration and so on. So despite originally being a big empty
space, the term agora came to stand for a group of buildings – if you see 
what I mean!
Stoas
As the agora developed into a building, the architectural elements that 
surrounded it, or stoas, came to resemble a colonnade, like a roofed street
with columns. 
Over time, these stoas became quite ornate and complicated buildings 
in their own right. Some examples of stoas feature more than one level.
Effectively, they became a kind of precinct, with small booths used for 
shops and businesses as well as a street that linked the agora to other 
areas of the city.
Some agoras and stoas are still partially in existence all around the
Mediterranean. The ancient religious town of Delphi contains some 
particularly good examples (Chapter 24 has more).
Stadiums and theatres
The other major public buildings were those the Greeks used for entertain-
ment (see Chapter 16 for all the fun). Ancient Greek athletic competitions 
and theatrical performances took place in the open air, so the buildings 
constructed didn’t have roofs. Neither type of building required much in 
the way of architectural design; rather the key was picking the right spot 
to begin with. These structures were usually just cut into a hillside with
acoustics being the greatest concern in the case of theatres.

O
f all the things that have survived the passage of time between ancient
Greece and today, the Greek myths are probably the most enduring.
First adopted and altered by the Romans whilst the Greek world was still in
existence (around 300 BC), the myths and their thrilling cast of gods, mortals,
and creatures have proven to be a huge inspiration to Renaissance artists,
English poets, and 20th-century movie makers – to name just a few. 
The ancient Greek myths are stories of love, jealousy, rage, heroism, cow-
ardice, and nearly all other human states. In short, they’re brilliant – and this
chapter looks at why.
Demystifying Myths
Myths were central to Greek life. They dominated the ancient Greeks’ reli-
gious practices, adorned temples and buildings, and appeared in nearly 
all literature and poetry. The reason for the prominence of myth in ancient
Greek culture is simple: Myths helped the ancient Greeks to understand 
who they were.
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon were the first Greek historians. 
Before them, the Greeks didn’t really have history as such. They still had to
explain the world around them – as well as the things they couldn’t see or
understand. 
Initially, the Greeks used myths to answer the big questions – like how the
world came into being and where men and women came from. Without any
scientific notions to fall back on, the Greeks came up with some surprising
explanations! (See the later section ‘Starting Out: Greek Creation Myths’ for
all the fascinating details.)
Passing on myths
Before around 750 BC the Greeks didn’t have writing (see Chapter 1), so they
passed on all mythical stories by word of mouth, generation by generation.
Eventually, these stories became part of an accepted system of belief. The
gods and heroes described in them became as real to everyday folk as their
local potter or innkeeper.
Myths that went beyond man’s origins eventually sprang up. Gods and
heroes dominated and were involved in incredible stories of adventure. The
storytelling about these characters became more involved and developed
into songs and poems.
Poets and epics
By the eighth century BC the Greeks began to record their oral poetry in 
written form. The works of poets like Homer (see Chapter 20) and Hesiod
were written down, and the stories that they told became a kind of mythical
fact – ‘mythtory’, if you like!
In many cases, the stories that the great poets produced were epic cycles –
long stories about heroes’ whole lifetimes as well as what happened to their
families for generations afterwards. These stories became a kind of mythtory
too, explaining the period of time before real history was written and also
served as inspiration to later playwrights, poets, and artists.
Keeping track of everything
Of course, one of the problems with myths that developed through an oral
tradition was that everybody had his or her own slightly different version.
Often, these differences were geographical, with many towns claiming to 
be the birthplace of a hero or the place where a famous event took place. 
A good example of this confusion is the god Pan (see Chapter 13). At least 14
different mythological characters are referred to as being his father!

Collating all these many stories and their many versions was a big job, but
some writers did try and do it. Not many of their works survive, but the 
following are two notable contributions:
 The Theogony by Hesiod (refer to Chapter 13) is literally a book about
‘god-birth’. This long poem describes the earliest elements of Greek
mythology and how the Olympian gods came into being. Several transla-
tions are available online and in published form.
 The Library of Greek Mythology by Apollodorus, a scholar who lived in
Alexandria during the second century BC, is an expansive survey of
myths. Translations of Apollodorus’s work are still published and widely
available today.
Starting Out: Greek Creation Myths
So how did it all begin, then? Unsurprisingly, ancient cultures offer various
versions of the myth of creation – and the ancient Greeks have several of
their own takes on the story. 
Hesiod’s version
The Greeks called the creation stories cosmogony, or how everything came
into being. The most common cosmogony was the one that Hesiod describes
in the Theogony:
Chaos was first of all, but next appeared broad bosomed Earth, sure
standing place for all . . . From Chaos came Black Night and Erebos and
Night in turn gave birth to Day and Space whom she conceived in love to
Erebos.
The idea is that first there was nothing but a void (Chaos) from which 
sprang Earth (also known as Gaia), Love (Eros), and other elemental beings.
Eventually, Gaia gave birth to Uranos who became the sky; he in turn 
fertilised Gaia and she gave birth to more children – the Titans.
All fairly trippy stuff. Notice how the Greeks personified certain things which
modern folks consider to be abstract notions. For example, love and the sky
have humanlike qualities and even genders. The ancient Greeks relied heavily
on anthropomorphism. They believed the creation of the world could be
explained by the interaction of various forces, and these forces were best
understood by making them like humans. See the later section ‘Defining the
gods’ for more on anthropomorphism. 
251
Chapter 19: Going Back to the Beginning: Myths and Gods

Other versions
Of course, Hesiod’s is just one version! Loads of others pop up throughout
Greek literature. Here are a few good ones:
 The earliest creation myth is called the Pelasgian and may have been a
foreign tradition that predated the Greeks. According to this version,
Eurynome produced a massive egg. Her son Ophion sat on it and
hatched it. From the egg came the whole universe, including the humans
and the gods.
 In Homer, the coupling of two of the Titans – Tethys and her brother
Ocean – produced all the gods.
 In later versions, the first deity was Night (known as Nyx). She either
produced an egg (like Eurynome) or gave birth to all gods and humans.
These three versions (plus Hesiod’s explanation) are a great example of 
how fluid Greek mythology was and how similar stories were told in many
completely different and alternative ways. 
Remembering the Titans
In Hesiod’s version of the creation myth, Gaia (Earth) and Uranos (the sky)
gave birth to a whole range of different characters known as the Titans. Like a
mythological version of a musical, the Titans were made up of six males and
six females.
Crafty Kronos
Chief amongst the Titans was the wily Kronos, who was married to his sister
Rhea. He had his eyes on power and plotted with his mother Gaia. While
Uranos slept, Kronos crept up on him and sliced off his genitals with a scythe!
They fell from the sky into the sea and bobbed along, until they came to 
the island of Cyprus where they caused a rather surprising result. According
to Hesiod:
The genitals, cut off with adamant and thrown from land into the stormy
sea, were carried for a long time on the waves. White foam surrounded the
immortal flesh, and in it grew a girl . . . and there the goddess came forth,
lovely, much revered, and grass grew up beneath her delicate feet. Her
name is Aphrodite among men.
The final lines inspired the Renaissance artist Botticelli’s famous painting 
The Birth of Venus – but you can see why he didn’t choose to depict the 
first part!
252
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief

What goes around comes around
Kronos became the ruler of the Titans, but he feared that one of his own chil-
dren would usurp him. To protect his power, every time his wife Rhea gave
birth, he grabbed the child and ate it!
Eventually, Rhea swapped her latest child (a boy called Zeus) for a stone
wrapped in a blanket, which Kronos gulped down. She then gave Kronos a
poisoned drink that caused him to vomit up his other children. Zeus then got
his siblings together and challenged Kronos to fight. Zeus and his siblings
won the war: the Titans were defeated and sent down to the abyss (an empty
chasm beneath the earth also known as Tartarus). The heavens had new
rulers – the Olympian gods! (See the later section ‘Meeting the Olympians: 
X-Rated Deities’ for all the details on this motley crew of immortals.) 
Bridging the gap between gods and man
The ancient Greeks thought that the events of the Titans happened a long
time before their own day. While they passionately believed that gods
existed, they considered that they only experienced the gods’ actions in the
form of storms and so on. 
To bridge this gap between Titans and everyday experience, the Greeks
believed that another age had existed in between – an age when the gods and
men had existed side by side.
Of course, the Greeks being Greeks, matters weren’t that straightforward!
They divided this period between the Titans and everyday ancient Greek
existence into various ages. Here’s a quick guide:
 The Golden Age: This was a peaceful time when men and women
existed in harmony alongside the gods, who were ruled by Kronos. This
was an age of plenty when all lived easily off nature. 
 The Silver Age: When the Golden Age human race died out another race
replaced them. But this race was foolish and wicked, and Zeus decided
to destroy it (see the following section ‘Figuring out where it all went
wrong’).
 The Bronze Age: During this age humans discovered war and became so
obsessed with it that they ended up destroying themselves.
 The Age of Heroes: This period was when the great Greek heroes –
including Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles – flourished. These individuals
fought each other and went on incredible adventures. For more on this
age, see Chapter 20.
 The Iron Age: This was the period that the ancient Greeks considered
themselves to be living in. It was an age where men were forced to work
hard for a living.
253
Chapter 19: Going Back to the Beginning: Myths and Gods

The ancient Greeks firmly believed that their own period (the Iron Age) was a
time of great hardship and that life had been much better during the Golden
Age. In his poem Works and Days Hesiod gives a lovely picture of what that
golden era was like:
And like gods they lived with happy hearts, untouched by toil or sorrow. Vile
old age never appeared, but always lively-limbed, far from ills, they feasted
happily. Death came to them as sleep, and all good things were theirs;
ungrudgingly, the fertile land gave up her fruits unasked. Happy to be at
peace they lived with every want supplied.
Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? Then again, it isn’t unusual for any society to
have a romantic view of the past and complain about its own time.
Figuring out where it all went wrong
So if the relationship between men and gods was perfectly happy during 
the Golden Age, why did the Greeks fear and respect the gods in their time?
The difference is explained by the Silver Age, where Zeus became enraged 
at the wicked behaviour of the race that he’d created and decided to wipe 
it out.
Deucalion’s ark
Zeus’s choice of Armageddon weapon was a flood. Much like in the Old
Testament story of Noah, only one man and his family had a chance to sur-
vive Zeus’s flood. In the Greek version, a Titan called Prometheus took pity
on humans and warned a man called Deucalion. 
Deucalion and his family built an ark and survived the rain for nine days
before coming to rest on the top of Mount Parnassus near Delphi. Zeus
relented and allowed Deucalion and his family to create a new race of men
and women. One of the sons was called Hellen, who gave his name to the 
race that the Greeks were descended from – the Hellenes. Although this 
was a widely held mythological belief, no historical evidence for it exists. 
(For my theories on where the Greeks actually came from refer to Chapters 2
and 3!)
Prometheus: Always in trouble
Prometheus also helped the new race of Hellenes by defying the wishes of
Zeus and giving men the gift of fire. Interestingly, Prometheus’s name means
‘forethought’, although he didn’t show too much here because Zeus’s anger
was considerable.

Zeus punished Prometheus by having him chained to a cliff and sending
eagles to attack him. Every day the eagles tore out Prometheus’s liver. The
wound magically healed every evening and the punishment was repeated the
next day. Eventually, Heracles freed Prometheus when he passed by on the
way to one of his labours. (Chapter 20 has more on Heracles.)
The story of Prometheus is a great example of the savage punishments that
the ancient Greeks believed their gods were capable of. The tragic playwright
Aeschylus (see Chapter 16) wrote a trilogy about Prometheus from which 
the first play, Prometheus Bound, still survives. In the following fiery excerpt,
Prometheus defies Zeus’s worst punishments:
Let hurricanes upheave by the roots the base of the earth, let the sea-waves’
roaring savagery confound the courses of the heavenly stars. Let him lift me
high and hurl me into black Tartarus [the deep abyss beneath the earth] on
ruthless floods of irresistible doom: I am one whom he cannot kill!
The story of Prometheus is very much a fantastical myth but it does reinforce
the way the Greeks felt about the relationship between man and the gods.
People who defied the gods would be justly punished. Greek tragic plays are
full of examples of characters who have pushed too far, been too bold, or too
arrogant, and suffered terrible punishments as a result. 
Putting the Gods in Their Place
The ancient Greeks loved gods, absolutely loved them. The Greeks had loads
of gods, and through their rich mythology they turned the most surprising
things – such as rivers and mountains – into gods. This section examines the
various powers and responsibilities of the gods, from the perspective of an
everyday ancient Greek citizen. Get ready for some surprises!
Understanding the role of gods
The gods played a vital part in how regular ancient Greeks lived their every-
day lives, including what they thought, what they built, what they painted,
and what they composed poems, plays, and songs about. 
At the same time, people lived in great fear of the power of their gods and
made sacrifices and offerings to them in the hope of receiving good fortune 
in return.

In the film Clash of the Titans (1980), the gods are depicted in quite a classical
way: sitting around a temple in flowing robes, watching the world from afar
and playing a game like chess with human lives. Although the special effects
are pretty cheesy, the notion of the gods as beautiful and fabulous but 
capable of wielding enormous power is a decent depiction of these deities.
Worshipping many
After Zeus’s revolt against his father Kronus and defeat of the Titans in a war
(see the earlier section ‘Remembering the Titans’), the gods that the ancient
Greeks recognised came into existence and continued to rule for all eternity.
Ancient Greek religion was polytheistic, which means it consisted of many
gods or deities. This is in contrast to Christianity, for example, which has 
one god and is therefore a monotheistic religion.
Greek religion had a specific pantheon, or collection of gods, that comprised
the most important deities. I look at these top tier gods in the later section
‘Meeting the Olympians: X-Rated Deities’.
Defining the gods 
The Greek gods were anthropomorphic. This means the Greeks imagined 
their gods in their own terms – looking and speaking like men and women,
although being fabulously powerful and magical.
Anthropomorphism is quite a reasonable thing for humans to do. (The
Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu religions all include anthropomorphism
in various ways.) The Greek philosopher Xenophanes summed the idea 
up quite nicely in his comment that ‘If horses could draw, they would draw
horse gods’.
Super powers
Despite taking human form, the Greek gods were awesome in their abilities.
Specifically, they were
 Able to resist wounding and disease
 Able to transform into other beings or creatures at the drop of a hat
 Blessed with eternal youth
 Capable of flight
In a way, they were like modern superheroes.
256

Do as I say, not as I do
Of course, the Greeks also imagined that their gods acted with some of the
same motivations as normal people and experienced the same emotions.
This belief meant that the Olympian gods often acted in cruel, childish, and
immoral ways. In the myths, they commit adultery, rape, and murder on a
seemingly daily basis and very often appear to revel in the cruel and inhuman
punishments that they inflict on poor, defenceless humans.
To the Greeks there was nothing strange about the gods’ actions. The Greeks
didn’t look to Zeus or Apollo as exemplars of good behaviour or for moral
guidance. And that’s just as well really! The Greeks didn’t have a concept of
sin or wickedness that came from religion. All the restrictions placed on
people’s liberty to act were based on legal or social conventions rather than
religious instruction.
Visiting Olympus – a home fit for the gods
According to mythological tradition, the gods lived at the very top of Mount
Olympus in northern Greece. This was where they spent a lot of time in near
continual feasting and revelry, eating ambrosia and drinking nectar. It was
vital for them to do this because the magical properties of these foodstuffs
renewed their divine blood and kept up their powers.
Despite this seeming idyllic existence, the gods often roamed around, 
visiting parts of the world and interacting with their human subjects. A good
example of this god/human interaction happens in Homer’s The Odyssey
when the other gods hold a sneaky meeting while Poseidon is away visiting
the Ethiopians. The gods decide to help Odysseus (whom Poseidon is angry
with) get home. The Greeks thought Ethiopia (their name for all of Africa
beyond the Nile) was the farthest place in the world. So far, in fact, not even
Poseidon could see what was happening in the Mediterranean while he was
in Ethiopia!
Working like a god: Attributions 
and divine job descriptions
When they weren’t feasting or misbehaving, the Olympian gods did have
responsibilities. Each god had his or her own area of expertise, which I think
of as their attributions. 
Nearly every area of human experience had a god that oversaw it. For 
example, Demeter looked after farming, Poseidon sea travel, and Asclepius
medicine and healing.
257

In many cases, gods had more than one attribution. Some, like Apollo and
Athena, had loads. And yes, these attributions sometimes clashed with each
other. For example, Athena was the goddess of handicrafts, wisdom, and war.
Not the most obvious combination!
The way that a god got his attribution was this: People adopted a god as the
patron deity of some area of human experience. It’s impossible to know why
the gods were given their attributions although they were usually relevant to
an incident in mythology (such as Poseidon being given the sea as his realm
by Zeus). Individuals honoured the god and made offerings, hoping for bene-
fits in return. In the case of individual trades (such as medicine or shipbuild-
ing), having a designated god led the Greeks to form guilds and organise
public festivals and celebrations in honour of their deities.
Have you seen the film Xanadu (1980)? It probably doesn’t immediately strike
you as relevant to the ancient Greeks but it does feature the Muses mas-
querading as rock band ‘The Nine Sisters’. It also features Zeus, Cliff Richard,
and ELO – perfect for a Sunday afternoon!
Separating fate from dumb luck
The ancient Greeks believed that they had to worship the gods to ensure 
that their lives progressed happily and that bad things didn’t happen to
258
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
Inspiring ladies: The Muses
The immortals who were most closely associ-
ated with their area of expertise were the
Muses. These nine female deities were led by
Apollo (patron god of the arts) and each repre-
sented an area of artistic endeavour:
 Calliope: Epic poetry
 Clio: History
 Erato: Lyric poetry
 Euterpe: Flute-playing
 Melpomene: Tragedy
 Polymnia: Hymns
 Terpsichore: Dancing and the chorus
 Thalia: Comedy
 Urania: Astronomy
The ancient Greeks believed that the relevant
Muse directly inspired artists working in these
fields. For this reason, all epic poems tradition-
ally begin with a request by the poet to be
inspired by the Muse Calliope. Hesiod’s
Theogony is a good example; he starts the poem
by describing the encounter that he had with the
Muses that inspired him: ‘With the Heliconian
[resident on Mount Helicon] Muses let us start
our song.’
The Greeks believed that the Muses lived on
Olympus and spent their days entertaining the
gods. Occasionally, they came down to earth
and literally filled an artist with their inspiration.

them. This philosophy may suggest that the Greek believed the gods con-
trolled their destinies – but this isn’t the case.
In addition to the gods, the Greeks believed in the idea of fate – that their
lives were planned out and followed preordained paths. Thus, the time of
your birth and the time of your death were fixed by a group of three female
deities called, surprisingly enough, the Fates. 
According to Hesiod, the Fates were very ancient goddesses who were the
daughters of Nyx (Night); see the earlier section ‘Starting Out: Greek Creation
Myths’. These sisters spun out the thread (or the fabric) of a life and then
one of them, Atropos, cut it when it was time for the human to die. The Fates
existed apart from the other gods, and some accounts go as far as to state
that the Olympian gods feared them.
The role of the gods was to administer fate as it came to pass. In The Iliad
Homer describes Zeus as having a set of scales on which he weighs the 
fates of the heroes who are in combat, deciding who’ll live or die that day.
But although Zeus administers these fates, he can’t actually do anything to
change them, which is highlighted when his own mortal son, Sarpedon, is
killed in battle. For a moment Zeus considers trying to prevent his son’s
death but then he realises that he can’t.
The Odyssey includes an even better example of the gods’ relationship with
fate. Athena states:
But from the great leveller Death: not even the gods can defend a man, not
even one they love, that day when fate takes hold and lays him out at last.
Accordingly, people rarely asked the gods for anything related to their deaths
or how long they would live. The Greeks generally accepted that the gods
controlled what happened in your mortal life, not when it ended. I look at the
Greek attitude towards death in Chapter 21.
Mocking the gods
Despite the awesome power that the Greeks thought the gods wielded,
people still often treated them as figures of fun and amusement in art, litera-
ture, and theatre. For example, in The Iliad the childish and comic affairs of
the gods act as a kind of counterpoint to the remorselessness of the fighting
and death going on in the Trojan War.
Comic plays (see Chapter 16) frequently poke fun at the gods. In Frogs by
Aristophanes, two of the central characters, Dionysus and Heracles, are
immortals and they’re lampooned just as much as the rest of the cast. In one
scene, Dionysus asks Heracles for travel tips on the journey to Hades (the
underworld):

I wondered if you could give me a few tips: any useful contacts down there,
where you get the boat, which are the best eating houses, bread shops, wine
shops, knocking shops . . . And which places have the fewest bugs.
Fun and games aside, I must make two important points about Aristophanes’s
comic musings about the gods: 
 He isn’t mocking any aspect of the gods’ awesome powers as gods;
rather he’s making fun of them acting like humans.
 He’s picked two relatively minor gods – he isn’t mocking Zeus or Apollo.
This careful fun-poking reveals that the Greeks had something of a hierarchy
for their gods. So without further ado, the next section looks at the most
important ones!
Meeting the Olympians: X-Rated Deities
Probably the most important factor to remember about the Olympian gods is
that they were, for the most part, related (see the section ‘Starting Out: Greek
Creation Myths’ for the odd genealogical details). For example:
 Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades were all brothers.
 Hera was their sister and was married to Zeus. (The Zeus/Hera relation-
ship was more than fit for an episode of Jerry Springer!) 
 Apollo, Artemis, and Hermes were just a few of Zeus’s many children.
Like all families, the gods had their ups and downs. Many of the stories about
the Greek gods are born out of their petty jealousies and squabbles. It’s like a
kind of immortal soap opera – so meet the cast of Olympian gods.
Zeus, the king of the gods
Zeus was king of all the gods. When he defeated his father Kronos (see the
earlier section ‘Starting Out: Greek Creation Myths’), he became lord of
everything. He mostly appears in myth as a great philanderer, sleeping with
many mortals and immortals. Zeus regularly transformed himself into other
creatures to do this: a swan (Leda), a bull (Europa), and even a shower of
gold (Danae)!
Poseidon, the earth-shaker
Poseidon was the brother of Zeus. When Zeus became supreme, Poseidon
was made the god of the earth (thus he was responsible for causing earth-
260

quakes) and the sea. Poseidon was also the god of horses and he impreg-
nated the demon Medusa. When Medusa was killed by the hero Perseus, the
famous winged horse Pegasus was born from her neck! 
Hades, the king of the dead
Zeus’s other brother Hades was given the underworld to rule and he became
king of the dead. The Greeks (and more frequently the Romans) also referred
to him as Pluto, meaning ‘wealthy’, because of the richness and fertility that
come from underneath the earth. 
Hades is mainly known for his abduction of Persephone (daughter of Zeus
and Demeter), who he took to the underworld to be his wife. Zeus forced
Hades to allow Persephone to return to mortality for six months of the year,
bringing with her return to the land of living the warm weather of spring and
summer.
Hera, the queen of heaven
Hera was the older sister of Zeus and also his wife. She was the goddess of
marriage and the Greeks honoured her in this way. In myth and literature she
spends most of her time being offended by Zeus’s philandering and cruelly
punishing his mortal lovers. She bore Zeus three children, including Ares the
god of war. She also makes regular appearances in the stories of Heracles
(setting him his tasks) and Jason (helping him to steal the Golden Fleece).
Hestia, the quiet one
Another sister of Zeus, Hestia was an intriguing, lesser-known immortal. She
was the goddess of the hearth and home and is often depicted tending an
eternal flame or fire. She renounced sexual love and lived a life of chastity –
and consequently she never really features in any myths at all! 
Despite her low profile in literature, Hestia was probably the most wor-
shipped goddess because she was the protectoress of every household, typi-
cally receiving the first offering of every sacrifice made in a Greek home.
Apollo, lord of the silver bow
Apollo was the male twin born of Zeus’s coupling with Leto, the daughter 
of one of the Titans (Artemis is Apollo’s twin sister). Apollo was the patron
god of archers and had many names like ‘the far shooter’ and ‘lord of the
261

silver bow’. Apollo is the god of prophecy and is also heavily associated 
with the sun and light. He was famed for establishing the Delphic Oracle 
(see Chapter 21) and is always depicted in Greek art as the epitome of male
beauty and perfection.
Aphrodite, the goddess of sexual love
The goddess of beauty, attraction, and sexual love, Aphrodite was married 
to Hephaestus, but they had no children, and she was frequently unfaithful.
Her most famous myth is that of her birth (see the earlier section ‘Crafty
Kronos’). She frequently appears in other stories, meddling in human rela-
tionships, sometimes with her son Eros. She plays a critical role in setting 
up the conflict that launched the Trojan War; see Chapter 20.
Ares, the god of war
Ares was the son of Zeus and Hera, and he was a truly terrifying god. Not only
the god of war, Ares actively enjoyed the fear and chaos of battle and was
credited with inspiring blood lust and savagery in mortals. He had two sons –
Phobos (‘Terror’) and Deimos (‘Fear’). He was also the father of Eros, a god of
lust, love, and intercourse, as a result of a long-term liaison with Aphrodite.
Athena, the intelligent one
Athena was the daughter of Zeus and was identified with both war and 
handicrafts. This may seem a strange combination, but these were identified
as the chief male and female occupations of the day. Unlike Ares, Athena’s
association with war was with the sober, correct use of it to defend cities.
Athena was also closely identified with intelligence and is often shown 
with an owl. The patron deity of the city of Athens, she was also the great
protector of the hero Odysseus in The Odyssey.
Artemis, the hunter
The daughter of Zeus and the twin sister of Apollo, Artemis was the goddess
of hunting and of women – with a particular focus on childbirth. Her role as
huntress encompassed all wildlife, and she was seen as being wild and
untamed in this way. She’s often depicted in art carrying a bow and arrows
and wearing animal skins.

Hephaestus, the god of the forge
Hephaestus was the god of fire and metalwork. He was the son of Hera and
born crippled. In some versions, he was born without a father, developing 
out of Hera’s rage for Zeus’s infidelities. Hera was so ashamed of him that 
she flung him from Mount Olympus, and several myths exist about the
extravagant revenges that he took upon her. 
Married to Aphrodite, Hephaestus spent most of his days in his forge where
he famously created a wonderful shield for the hero Achilles. Eventually, the
Greeks revered him for all industry and manufacturing activities.
Hermes, the messenger god
One of the many sons of Zeus, Hermes was the messenger and herald of the
gods. He appears in myth wearing winged sandals that enable him to fly at
great speed to deliver messages from Olympus. Unsurprisingly, he was also
the god of travellers; people made offerings to him before setting out on long
journeys. He was also known as a cunning trickster – probably not the one to
ask directions from then!
Demeter, the life-giver
Demeter was the goddess of corn and accordingly considered to be the 
sustainer of life. She was the sister of Zeus and bore him a daughter called
Persephone. Due to her association with the harvest, she was very heavily
worshipped by the Greeks and central to their most famous cult, the
Eleusinian Mysteries (described in Chapter 21).
Dionysus, the god of good times
Dionysus was another son of Zeus and the god of wine and intoxication.
Drunkenness was seen as a good thing because it helped to banish the cares
of the world. Drinking and revelry fitted well with his other role as god of the
theatre, where people could wear masks to change their identity. Dionysus
spent his time roaming the countryside with his drunken crew, including his
crazed female followers known as maenads.
The preceding is just a tiny introduction to the top-tier Olympian gods and
their most famous stories. The myths about them are incredibly complex and
contradict each other all the time. What’s most important is the associations
the gods had because that’s why Greeks worshipped them. (See Chapter 21
for more on how the ancient Greeks went about worshipping.)

The third section of Disney’s Fantasia (1940) is an animated piece that accom-
panies Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony ‘The Pastoral’. The Greek gods on Mount
Olympus are all in it. The blend of music and animation is wonderful and I
can never hear that music without thinking about Greek mythology.
Transitioning from Greek to Roman 
The Romans adopted gods very close to the Greek ones as their own. Greek
and Roman gods were very similar and had the same attributions, but had
different names. It can sometimes get quite confusing so Table 19-1 serves as
a quick guide.

Not all fun and games
Although the gods all sound like tremendous
fun, they were actually violent and unpre-
dictable. Dionysus is a particularly good exam-
ple. He sounds like a god who inspired good
times and revel, and he did. But he also turned
people mad. Under Dionysus’s influence, people
did awful and terrible things.
In Euripides’s play Bacchae, Dionysus turns
Pentheus (the king of Thebes) insane after he
attempts to stop Dionysus’s followers from wor-
shipping him. Pentheus is torn to pieces by the
maenads when he blunders in on their rites.
Here Dionysus sets out how Pentheus had
broken the rules.
No god can see his worship scorned, and
hear his name profaned, and not take
vengeance to the utmost limit. Thus men
may learn that gods are more powerful 
than they.
Although they may act like fools and make
human mistakes in many of the myths, the gods
were to be feared and the Greeks worshipped
them through fear as much as devotion.

The Roman and Greek gods aren’t exactly the same but they had similar

absorbed Greece into their empire (refer to Chapter 12). 
One thing that did change in the transition from Greek to Roman was the
importance of some gods. Mars (Ares) was incredibly important to a warlike
people like the Romans, and Vesta (Hestia) came to prominence as the 
founding deity of the famous Vestal Virgins, a hugely influential cult in Rome
that trained young women to be priestesses.

Blending Myth and History: 
Troy, Homer, and Heroes
In This Chapter
 Reliving the glories of the Trojan War
 Searching for facts about Troy
 Appreciating Homer’s epic poems 
 Taking stock of other heroes and their adventures
T
he myth of the Trojan War is very famous. For generations people have
enjoyed plays, stories, novels, and films about the exploits of Achilles,
Odysseus, Helen, and many other fascinating Greek characters. 
You may have seen the film Troy (2004). It was great fun and gave the impres-
sion of an epic struggle between huge armies led by handsome, physically
well-developed heroes who fought over a fantastical city for possession of
one beautiful woman. When the film was released a lot of people quibbled
over whether the events shown were a ‘true’ version of what had gone on.
They were missing the point. The story shown in the film – recounted in 
the poetic source material, Homer’s The Iliad – never really took place; it 
is a myth. 
For the ancient Greeks, however, the Trojan War was hugely important. Their
versions of the war were massively influential on the way in which they lived
their lives. 
This chapter is all about the Trojan myth: understanding the stories, getting
to grips with its impact on ancient and subsequent Greek life, and looking at
the archaeological evidence now available. It’s also about introducing Homer
and The Iliad – the man and the poem that dominated intellectual life in the
Greek world.

Separating Myth and History
As I mention in Chapter 3, early Greek history is very difficult to separate
from mythology. The Trojan War is a perfect example of this combining of fact
and fiction. 
The Greeks readily accepted the idea of what they called the Trojan Cycle
(see the following section ‘Mining the myth of the Trojan War’) although
there were various versions of it. The ancient Greeks considered the stories
true and did not require any evidence. Modern minds, however, find Troy
more difficult to accept unquestioningly. Historians try to balance the evi-
dence of archaeology (see ‘Seeking out the facts of Troy’) with information in
the original literary works, including Homer’s epic poems (see ‘Preserving –
and Pumping Up – the Story of Troy: Homer’).
Mining the myth of the Trojan War
The myth of the Trojan War encompasses a huge number of characters 
and incidents set vaguely around the time of the Mycenaean period (see
Chapter 2), probably about 1300–1200 BC. The Greeks referred to the whole
collection of stories as the Trojan Cycle. 
Highlights of the story include the following key players and events:
 A war spurred by love: While on a diplomatic mission to the court 
of the Spartan king Menelaus, Paris, one of the sons of the Trojan king
Priam, falls in love with Menelaus’s beautiful wife Helen and elopes with
her back to Troy. (For more on Troy’s assumed geographic location, 
see the following section ‘Figuring out the facts of Troy’.) This causes 
a major international incident as Menelaus’s brother is Agamemnon,
Mycenaean king, and the most powerful and influential of all the Greek
leaders.
 The personal becomes political: Menelaus calls on all the other Greek
nobles who owe him allegiance to join in an assault on Troy in an effort
to avenge the insult to him. Agamemnon assembles a mighty fleet that
sets sail from Aulis on the eastern coast of Greece, landing on the shore
outside Troy (modern-day western Turkey; see the Cheat Sheet map).
And thus, Helen becomes ‘the face that launched a thousand ships’.
 Larger than life warriors: Both the Greeks and Trojans assemble armies
full of the leading heroes of the age. The Greeks’ superstar is Achilles,
whose goddess mother bathed him in the river Styx in Hades to make
him (almost) invulnerable. The Trojans’ greatest warrior is Hector, King
Priam’s eldest son.
268
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

 A brutal battle: War rages between the two sides for ten years. The gods
and goddesses both help and hinder each side; each deity chooses indi-
vidually which army to support (see Chapter 19). Many heroes on both
sides lose their lives, including Hector who is killed by Achilles. Paris
then shoots Achilles in the heel (his one vulnerable spot) with an arrow,
and he dies.
 One tricky pony: Eventually, the end to the war comes with a cunning
plot devised by Odysseus, the Greek king of Ithaca. The Greeks con-
struct an enormous horse, leave it outside the gates of Troy, and then
appear to depart for home. Thinking that they’ve won, the Trojans take
the horse inside the city and begin to celebrate. Shortly afterwards
some Greeks who are concealed inside the horse slip out and open the
gates for their comrades. In the bloodshed that follows, Troy is utterly
destroyed, never to recover.
But the Trojan Cycle doesn’t end with the war. The stories about the various
characters continue. Most notably: 
 Menelaus is reunited with Helen.
 Agamemnon returns home and is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra.
Aeschylus’s trilogy of tragic plays, known as The Oresteia, dramatises
this veritable soap opera of deception and power.
 Odysseus spends a further ten years wandering the Mediterranean
before returning home to his wife Penelope in Ithaca. See the section
‘Returning home: The Odyssey’ for more on Odysseus’s outrageous 
journey. 
The preceding is just one version of the myth. For the ancient Greeks, myths
changed depending on who you were and where you lived. Another version
of the Trojan story has Helen spending the whole war hiding in Egypt with
only a ghost version of herself at Troy!
The film Troy (2004) was criticised because in it Paris and Helen leave Troy
together and Achilles is present at the fall of the city. Critics missed the point.
Many Greeks believed and told varying versions of the Trojan cycle so why
shouldn’t Hollywood?
Figuring out the facts of Troy
So what do historians actually know of the city of Troy? Unfortunately, facts
are difficult to come by. What historians now know is based on a mixture 
of archaeological evidence and educated speculation. Despite some debate,
historians generally contend the following:
269
Chapter 20: Blending Myth and History: Troy, Homer, and Heroes
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

 When: The ancient Greeks believed the Trojan War took place during
The Age of Heroes, a period before the Greeks began recording history
when they believed the great escapades of heroes like Heracles,
Theseus, and the fighters at Troy to have taken place. The historian
Herodotus thought that the war took place about 800 years before his
time, or around 1200 BC.
 Where: The site historians now regard as Troy had been an important
fortress throughout the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. The city was
built on a low hill about eight kilometres west of the Aegean coast and
just a little farther south of the Hellespont (see the Cheat Sheet map).
Troy was in a superb position for trading at two coastal points and with
the whole of Asia Minor and the east. Consequently, the city must have
been very wealthy.
As I explain in Chapter 2, historians rely on archaeology for almost all their
knowledge of the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. During the 19th century a
German archaeologist called Heinrich Schliemann carried out a huge amount
of excavation at sites around both Troy and Mycenae.
When Schliemann excavated at the spot that historians now think was the
site of Troy, he discovered the ruins of an ancient town that was built on
seven different levels. 
 The earliest of these levels contained a huge amount of gold and other
precious finds. 
 The more recent levels were farther away from the centre, as you’d
expect from a city that grew and expanded. 
 Twentieth-century excavations found that these most recent levels
showed evidence of having been destroyed through some cataclysmic
event around the time of 1300 BC. 
Schliemann was convinced that his site was Troy of the Trojan Cycle and 
that the treasure that he found belonged to the mythical king Priam. He
announced to the world that he had found the site of Troy and proof that 
the Trojan War had taken place.
However, Schliemann’s discoveries were problematic. Further excavations
have shown that an earthquake, rather than an invading army, damaged the
more recent areas. Signs also indicated that people lived in the recent levels
once more very soon after the damage – not the hallmarks of a city razed to
the ground by Agamemnon’s army.
Other evidence for the Trojan War is literary (see the next section) and in the
form of Greek art where the stories from the Trojan cycle were always a pop-
ular subject for sculptors and vase painters (Chapter 17 has a good example
of a black-figure vase with a Trojan theme). However, these artefacts can’t
really be taken as proof of the war itself, rather as evidence of a continued
interest in the Trojan cycle during later Greek history.

Ultimately, the general consensus is that the city found by Schliemann is the
most likely site of ancient Troy. You can visit the site today although the fairly
nondescript ruins are very difficult to relate to the story of the war. However,
historians are no nearer to an answer about whether the Trojan War truly
took place.
Passing On – and Pumping Up – 
the Story of Troy: Homer
The poet Homer and his poems The Iliad and The Odyssey had a huge impact
on almost every aspect of Greek life. Modern folks often have difficulty appre-
ciating quite why this was the case because the attitude to poetry today is
very different. In ancient Greece The Iliad and The Odyssey were the first
works of Western literature. 
What makes the poems even more amazing is that they are huge, compli-
cated, and lengthy works. Every succeeding historical period has acknowl-
edged the poems as masterpieces, and people still consider them to be
astounding examples of literary construction and story telling 
The ancient Greeks presumed that the author of the two poems was one 
man – an author of genius called Homer. For centuries scholars have loudly
debated his identity, despite the lack of any real evidence. One popular
theory is that Homer was blind and ancient portrait busts of him (made 
hundreds of years after his death) often show him in this way. The most 
likely reason for this is the character of Demodocus the bard who appears 
in The Odyssey and performs a song about the Fall of Troy. Because he is
blind some people have suggested that Homer put himself in the poem. It’s 
a good theory anyway!
Sharing stories: The oral tradition
Part of the problem in identifying who Homer was comes from the fact that
nothing Homer himself wrote actually exists! 
Writing didn’t develop in Greece until around the eighth century BC (see
Chapter 1). Early Greeks composed and delivered poetry orally, and Homer
was probably part of this tradition. (This tradition has continued around the
world even to modern times, in places as far apart as Serbia and the Congo.) 
Oral poets lived an itinerant life travelling around from town to town and 
performing their work. Ancient sources mention other epic poems such as
one about the myths associated with the city of Thebes, but none of these
poems survive and none of them had the influence of Homer’s epics.

The skill of the poet
The oral tradition involves techniques such as using formulas or repeated
phrases. You can see these techniques in the works of Homer. Characters 
are given epithets (words that describe their innate qualities or abilities) such
as ‘swift-footed Achilles’ or Hector ‘tamer of horses’ and these are repeated
throughout. 
Some key scenes are repeated wholesale. A particularly good example is the
description of heroes making a sacrifice and eating the meal that followed.
This whole passage is repeated many times throughout both The Iliad and
The Odyssey. You can find a quotation from this scene in Chapter 15.
Part of the reason for these techniques is that ancient Greek poets designed
their work to be performed rather than read. The formulas and repetition
enabled poets to keep the ideas and stories in their heads in order to present
the works to audiences. 
Fascinating rhythm
Equally important to the poems is the rhythm in which they were originally
composed and that translators work hard to maintain in their modern 
versions. The original Greek rhythm is dactylic hexameter, a form virtually
impossible to reproduce in English. Bearing this in mind helps you to 
remember that these works are poems, despite the many prose translations
available today.
The Iliad, for example, is a very long poem of around 17,000 lines. Scholars
estimate that the entire work would require roughly 24 hours to read aloud.
When it was performed to the ancient Greeks, the poem was most likely 
presented in sections rather than as a whole.
The length and complexity of the poems have led most people to conclude
that they were probably composed some time in the late eighth century BC
and then written down around 650 BC. The written versions were more than
likely the work of a group of poets but based on a tradition that started with
one man, Homer.
Doing battle: The Iliad
I mention The Iliad a lot throughout this book, and that’s because it’s proba-
bly the most important work of literature that the Greeks ever produced. The
ancient Greeks considered The Iliad to be more than just a huge poem about
a mythical war. Rather, it was the closest that the Greeks had to a historical
record and moral guide. It was a kind of bible; something they turned to for
advice on all sorts of issues.

Getting down to details
The Trojan War lasted for about ten years (see the section ‘Mining the myth
of the Trojan War’ for an overview), but the story of The Iliad covers only
about two weeks of battle. 
The central character is the great Greek warrior Achilles, who withdraws
from the fighting after an argument with Agamemnon, his commander. While
Achilles is out of action, the Trojans get on top in the fighting. The Trojan
prince Hector kills Achilles’s great male friend (and possibly lover) Patroclus.
Grief-stricken, Achilles returns to the fighting and eventually kills Hector
before the poem ends with the funeral of Patroclus and the athletic competi-
tions that followed it (a tradition following the death of a warrior).
Heroism, handicrafts, and history
Of course, The Iliad is about much more than Achilles seeking vengeance for
Patroclus’s death. The ancient Greeks considered the poem to be a source of
information on:
 The concept of the hero and the way that heroes behave: To modern
eyes, the characters in The Iliad seem unusual and probably quite petu-
lant, but the Greeks loved the way these heroes were totally devoted to
their sense of honour. In the world of The Iliad a man can preserve his
honour only by fighting and killing enemies, and collecting the enemy’s
armour after battle serves as a visible sign of the hero’s honour and skill.
 Practical procedures: Several scenes in the poem describe sacrifices
and ceremonies that were heavily influenced the way that later Greeks
conducted them. (See Chapter 21 for more on ancient Greek religious
practices.) 
273
Chapter 20: Blending Myth and History: Troy, Homer, and Heroes
What about the Trojan horse?
One thing that isn’t in The Iliad – or any of
Homer’s works for that matter – is the story of
the Trojan horse. Although this clever ruse was
well established as part of the Trojan myth, it
doesn’t feature in the poem which comes to an
end before the fall of Troy. The incident is 
frequently mentioned in The Odyssey but isn’t
discussed in any real detail.
By far the best ancient version of the story of
the Trojan horse is told in The Aeneid, a much
later poem by the Roman poet Virgil (first 
century BC). The Aeneid details the story of 
the Trojan prince Aeneas and his travels 
after the war.
Historians have no idea if a Trojan horse ever
actually existed but the version in The Aeneid
is very affecting in its description of the
tragedies that occurred as Troy fell.

Another good example of how The Iliad details everyday life comes
when the god Hephaestus makes an incredible shield for Achilles to use
during his return to the fighting.
At first Hephaestus makes a great and massive shield, blazoning well-
wrought emblems all across its surface, raising a rim around it, glittering,
triple-ply with a silver shield-strap run from edge to edge and five layers of
metal to build the shield itself.
To modern readers, this passage (and the dozens of lines that follow it)
may seem an over-elaborate description. But The Iliad and The Odyssey
are full of details like this and that is why the Greeks regarded the poems
as something like compendiums of knowledge. 
 Historical figures: Homer also includes lines and lines of verse devoted
to charting the histories of all the characters he introduces. Book 2 of
The Iliad is often called the Catalogue of Ships; it’s basically a long list 
of virtually all the fighters that were involved in the war. Many ancient
Greeks would have regarded this book as the most impressive of the
entire poem because of the knowledge that it contains. 
For a travelling oral poet the Catalogue of Ships would also be a good
way of impressing the audience: the sheer number of heroes mentioned
in Book 2 meant that somebody relevant to the town that he was visiting
would get a plug. This was a great way of getting the audience onside
early in a performance!
Returning home: The Odyssey
In addition to The Iliad, the other great work that historians attribute to
Homer is The Odyssey, which tells the story of what happened to Odysseus,
the king of Ithaca, when he tried to return home after the Trojan War. Most
scholars believe The Iliad was the first of the two poems, with The Odyssey
being something of a sequel.
Getting down to details
Odysseus’s journey takes a very long time because the gods punish him 
for allowing his men to kill and eat the sacred cattle of the sun god. His ship
destroyed and his crew lost, Odysseus ends up stranded on the island of 
the sea-nymph Calypso for seven years. Along the way, Odysseus has loads 
of adventures with giants, clashing rocks, sea monsters, and a sorceress
called Circe. 
Arriving back in Ithaca, Odysseus finds that the local nobles presumed 
that he was dead and moved into his palace in the hope of wooing his wife
Penelope. Teaming up with his son Telemachus, he kills many of the nobles
and drives them from the house, finally reuniting with Penelope after 20 
years away from home!

The Odyssey is a fantastic story and reads much more like a modern novel
than The Iliad.
Despite the drama of the tale, the poem hasn’t ever really been successfully
turned into a film. The most modern effort was a mini-series from 1997 
that starred Armand Assante and Greta Scacchi. It’s a good effort with some
great Mediterranean scenery and a particularly unpleasant set of suitors 
led by Eric Roberts. Otherwise try O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2001) starring
George Clooney. Although set in the deep south of America it’s a loose
reworking of the story and it can be fun to try and work out the references to
Homer’s poem. John Goodman’s character is the cyclops Polyphemus!
The rules of friendship
One lesson that the ancient Greeks took from The Odyssey is the concept of
xenia. Xenia means ‘guest-friendship’, and it’s the regulated system of greet-
ing guests followed by virtually all the characters in The Odyssey. In short,
xenia means you let people relax, eat, and refresh themselves when they
arrive at your house before asking them any questions about who they are 
or what they want.
Here’s a great example of the rules of xenia in action. In Book 4 of the poem,
Menelaus welcomes Odysseus’s son Telemachus and a warrior called Mentes
(who’s actually the goddess Athena in disguise!) into his house without 
knowing who they are, saying:
‘Help yourselves to food, and welcome! Once you’ve dined we’ll ask who
you are. . . .’ With those words he passed them a fat rich loin with his own
hands, the choicest part, that he’d been served himself.
Nearly all the characters in the poem follow these rules – and all who don’t
(like the suitors in Odysseus’s house) suffer violent punishments as a result.
Consequently, the poem almost sets a moral code for the ancient Greeks. The

Rhapsodes: A load of know-it-alls! 
Knowledge of Homer was considered to be vital
to a person’s education in ancient Greece (see
Chapter 14), but some people went even further
than that. 
Rhapsodes were professional reciters of poetry,
most commonly The Iliad and The Odyssey.
Unlike Homer they weren’t actually poets 
themselves but performed other people’s work
for a fee and often competed in games and
competitions. Due to the fact that Homer’s
poems contained so much knowledge of the
world, the Greeks saw the rhapsodes as author-
ities on almost any given subject. A little bit like
a kind of walking Internet!

idea of hospitality and offering guests food and drink was a key part of the
ancient Greek mindset. As a regular visitor to Greece I’ve found this to be a
tradition that continues to this day.
Meeting Other, Earlier Heroes 
Although the Trojan Cycle that The Iliad and The Odyssey describe dominated
Greek literature and mythology, hundreds of other heroes and stories are
associated with the Age of Heroes. In many cases, these individuals were part
of an earlier time than the age of Troy. In The Iliad the old warrior Nestor of
Pylos says that none of the men fighting at Troy can compare with the earlier
generation of heroes like Theseus (see the later section ‘Theseus: Founder of
Athens’). So these earlier heroes must have been pretty impressive! (See
Chapter 19 for more on the ancient Greek’s conceptualisation of the history
of man.)
When ancient Greek literature talks about a hero, it doesn’t mean somebody
who does amazing things to help others like Superman or Spiderman. The
ancient Greek concept of a hero is somebody who achieves amazing feats or
shows incredible strength and endurance. Most of the time, these heroes
aren’t very nice and they do a lot of unpleasant things – very different to the
modern version of a hero.
The following sections serve as a short guide to some of the other major
heroes in ancient Greek mythology and literature, and what they did.
Heracles: A hard worker!
Heracles (or Hercules as the Romans called him) is pretty much the ultimate
Greek hero. He was the son of Zeus (see Chapter 19) and a mortal woman
called Alcmene. 
Virtually from birth, Heracles was famed for having extraordinary courage
and strength – as well as a terrific appetite and a terrible temper! A huge
number of myths are associated with him, most famously ‘The Twelve
Labours’. Eurystheus, the king of Tiryns (whom the Delphic Oracle told
Heracles to serve), sets up 12 near-impossible tasks for Heracles. There’s
never been a really satisfying explanation as to why he was given this 
much to do. Some scholars believe that it was just a clever way of bringing
together some of the many stories about Heracles into one big tale.
Table 20-1 outlines and explains the 12 labours.

After all these labours, Heracles still isn’t done. Many more stories tell of his
exploits. When he finally dies, he is taken up to Olympus where he lives with
the gods as one of them. That alone makes him the greatest of Greek heroes.
Theseus: Founder of Athens
As I mention in Chapter 4, many ancient Greeks believed that Theseus was:
 The son of Poseidon (covered in Chapter 19)
 The founder of many of the institutions of the city of Athens
 The hero who went to Crete and defeated the Minotaur
Of course, loads of other stories are associated with Theseus; not least jour-
neying to fight the Amazons alongside Heracles. By the fifth century BC the
Greeks thought of Theseus as the founding figure of justice, and he appears
in several tragic plays as a very noble figure.

Perseus: Medusa slayer
Perseus was the son of Zeus and the mortal woman Danae. (Zeus turned 
himself into a shower of gold to impregnate this lovely lady!) 
Perseus’s most famous feat was killing the snake-haired Gorgon called
Medusa who turned men to stone with one look. He also saved Andromeda
from being eaten by a sea-monster. These adventures and more feature in 
the film Clash of the Titans (1980).
Jason: Leader of the Argonauts
Jason is famous for one really big feat. His wicked uncle Pelias denied 
Jason the throne of Iolcus, and set him the task of travelling far to the city 
of Colchis to steal the Golden Fleece, the skin of a ram with magical powers.
On his ship called the Argo, Jason was joined by a famous crew of heroes, 
the Argonauts. 
The most complete version of the myth is the Voyage of Argo by Apollonius 
of Rhodes, written in the third century BC.
Bellerophon: Mystery man
Historians and scholars often consider Bellerophon to be the forgotten man
of Greek myths whose stories haven’t survived as well as some of the others.
A son of Poseidon, Bellerophon is sent on various impossible tasks, rather
like Heracles. These tasks include fighting the terrifying Chimaera monster
and battling single-handed against the Amazons. The flying horse Pegasus
aids him in these tasks.
Where heroes go to die
Given that these heroes all achieved such amazing things in their lifetimes 
it’s no surprise that myths suggested that they were equally special in death.
Mortals just went to the grim underworld of Hades (see Chapter 21) but the
fate of heroes was rather different.
According to mythology heroes went to a place called Elysium, also known 
as the ‘Elysian Fields’ or ‘Elysian Plain.’ This was a special section of Hades
where heroes could spend all eternity feasting and hunting in a beautiful 
paradise. So it was worth carrying out all those heroic tasks after all!

Chapter 20: Blending Myth and History: Troy, Homer, and Heroes
Building them up – to knock them down 
Just like historical figures and the Olympian gods
(see Chapter 19), the early heroes of Greek
mythology are very open to interpretation. Later
Greek writers reinterpreted them in quite differ-
ent ways. For example, Heracles is often shown
in comedies as a drunkard and a glutton. The
phrase ‘a Heracles supper’ evolved to describe
an event that goes on long after it should have
finished.
The tragic playwrights took heroes and por-
trayed elements of their character from very 
different viewpoints:
 In Sophocles’s play Philoctetes, Odysseus is
something of a villain, using his cunning to
hurt others.
 In Euripides’s Medea, Jason is proud, selfish,
and arrogant.

hapter 19 introduces the many varied ancient Greek gods, and illustrates
the roles specific gods were believed to have in the mythical past. In this
chapter I look at how the ancient Greeks worshipped their gods and other
mythical heroes in their daily lives. Get ready to uncover some strange and
unusual rituals – at least for modern eyes.
Greek religion was actually very formal and full of big public rituals in the
same way that modern religions make requirements on people to be in places
at certain times of day and week. Public religion is the major focus of this
chapter – understanding the private, spiritual beliefs of the ancient Greeks is
very difficult because historians don’t really have any record of them. The
closest that we get to it is in understanding their cults, which were a slight
departure from everyday religious practice.
Everything that I talk about in this chapter is what most Greeks accepted and
did in their daily lives. Just like today, each ancient Greek man or woman had
different, individual ideas about the gods, but by and large they carried out
similar religious practices and ceremonies. 
Dying – In Theory and Practice
Death and dying may sound like a gloomy subject, but the ancient Greeks had
some intriguing – and perhaps inspiring – notions about what happened to
humans after they passed away. Modern anthropologists often say that you

can tell a lot about a society by the way that it deals with death because it
proves what people thought was valuable. I think that idea is probably true 
of ancient Greece.
Venturing into the underworld: 
The mythological take
The Greeks believed that when people died, their bodies decayed, their 
souls (or ‘shades’ – like a kind of ghost version of the person) travelled to
Hades (the name of both the god of the dead and the underworld) to exist 
for eternity. 
When ‘shades’ entered the underworld, they first had to cross the river Styx
(or Lethe) on a ferry piloted by the famous ferryman Charon. When people
died, their friends or family placed a coin in their mouths so that they were
able to pay Charon his fee. If a person died and didn’t have the proper funeral
rites, he or she would spend eternity unable to cross the river.
While crossing the Styx, the hand of the ‘shade’ fell into the water and the
magical power of the river drained all memories from the body, allowing 
the deceased individual to be content to exist in the underworld without 
continually mourning for those they left behind.
Despite the gloomy subject matter, the Greeks were able to poke fun at the
dying process. Aristophanes’s play Frogs is set in the underworld, and Charon
appears as a rather comical character. 
Any more for Lethe, Blazes, Perdition, or the Dogs? Come along now, any
more for a nice restful trip to Eternity? No more worries, no more cares,
makes a lovely break!
Other theories about the underworld and the experiences of the dead
existed. For example, in The Odyssey (see Chapter 20), Odysseus has to 
travel to the underworld to speak with the prophet Tiresias. The souls that
Odysseus meets are deeply unhappy and remember everything about their
previous lives. Indeed, they spend eternity drifting around in grief and must
consume sacrificial blood before they can speak to Odysseus. Yuck!
The ancient Greeks appear to have placed no value judgement on people’s
lives, and had no equivalents of heaven or hell. Everyone went to Hades
regardless of the lives they’d led and stayed there for eternity. The only
exceptions were the mythological heroes who were fortunate to have ended
up in Elyisum (refer to Chapter 20).

Dealing with the dead: Practicalities
Mythology aside, the ancient Greeks had very specific ways of dealing 
with death. Indeed, the Greeks were obsessed with receiving proper burials
because they believed that if bodies didn’t receive proper funeral rites from
relatives, then the souls of the dead were prevented from travelling to the
underworld (see the preceding section ‘Venturing into the underworld: 
The mythological take’).
Funerals could be expensive affairs with all kinds of musicians and perform-
ers required and many people attending the formal meal, which all the family
attended before the burial. As I examine in Chapter 14, the ancient Greeks
were really obsessed with the idea of familial and friendship ties, so funerals
were big events.
Poorer people had to make do with what was available. They’d still strive 
to ensure a proper burial, even if they weren’t able to afford the attendant
functions. After all, a family meal could just involve some wine, cheese, 
and olives.
Ancient Greece was mainly an inhumation culture, which means that bodies
are buried, rather than a cremation culture in which they’re burnt. Most 
families had a family tomb that they filled with generations of corpses. 
Every year the surviving family members gathered at their tomb or grave to
honour those who had died, a bit like an annual memorial service. Normally
these rites would involve saying prayers and making offerings to the gods. 
Often, the tombs included gravestones featuring epitaphs carved in the
stone. These words were sometimes in verse form, produced by a poet for
hire. One such poet was Simonides (circa 500 BC). Following are two of his
best efforts!
Drinker, glutton supreme, supreme defamer of men. I, Timokreon of Rhodes,
now lie down here.
Someone is glad that I, Theodorus, am dead. Another will be glad when that
someone is dead. We are all in arrears to death.
Worshipping the Gods
Throughout their whole lives, ancient Greeks were continually involved in
some kind of religious ceremony or ritual. Social life, business deals, mar-
riage, war, and cultural entertainment all involved ritual practices focused on
one or several gods in the pantheon (see Chapter 19).
283
Chapter 21: Practising Everyday Religion: ‘A God Put It in My Heart to Say’
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Rituals were important because they allowed the ancient Greeks to ask 
the gods for help, approval, or a guarantee. All rituals involved a kind of 
bargaining: The humans provided the gods with something in exchange for
their help. See the later section ‘Sacrificing: Giving the gods gifts’ for the 
fascinating details. 
Seeing the gods in person: Idols
Many aspects of Greek religion took place inside temples (see Chapter 18).
Within each temple was a statue that depicted a specific god. The ancient
Greeks believed that the god was actually present inside the temple – or if
many temples to a specific deity existed, they believed that the god always
visited their temple at some point during the year or at least that they could
see what was going on in many temples at once. 
The belief that gods were present within the temples meant that the Greeks
actually worshipped the statue within the temple – a practice that modern
folks would call idolatry. (See Chapter 17 for more on the process of creating
metal and marble statues.) In contrast, worshippers in a Catholic church for
example, aren’t honouring a statue but the figure that the statue represents.
As worship, the Greeks made small offerings and prayed to the gods. They
sometimes dressed the statue with ribbons known as stemmata. The statues
must have ended up being quite pretty and well-covered because a large
number of people visited the temple on a daily basis. 
When to worship
The ancient Greek calendar was full of official religious days and festivals
(refer to Chapter 15). The Greeks didn’t have a specific holy day but engaged
in religious rituals during the many festivals. 
This meant that normal worship at the temple took place whenever a person
wanted. Individuals could worship alone or as groups and families and a
temple priest would always supervise whatever activities they were carrying
out. Men, women, and children were all allowed to attend temples but would
probably do most of their personal worship in their home.
Having gods in your home
The Greek household (oikos) was itself a sacred place with its own rituals
and requirements (see Chapter 14). The main protector of the household was
284
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Zeus, known in this instance as Zeus Herkeios, or the Guardian. Zeus was also
responsible for the concept of xenia, the proper treatment of guests (see
Chapter 21).
The household itself was sacred to Hestia, goddess of the hearth (see
Chapter 19). Every house kept a fire constantly burning in honour of the 
goddess, and this hearth was the centrepiece of the home. This was the 
spot where the oikos ate all meals and received guests.
The ancient Greeks also chose their own deities who they looked on to pro-
tect their houses. People placed images of the selected gods on the gates or
doors of houses or somewhere within the home. Gods such as Apollo and
Hermes were popular choices. 
Sacrificing: Giving the gods gifts
Sacrifices and offerings were the main ways of honouring the gods. A sacri-
fice was the killing of an animal, whereas an offering was a gift of wine, food,
money, or other item. These practices weren’t Greek inventions; the tradition
went back a long way into the past. The idea behind them was that you gave
the gods some of your food – that which kept you alive – and in return the
gods would either just continue to look after you or perhaps aid you in some
way such as blessing a married couple with children or ensuring a good 
harvest for a farm.
Sometimes offerings were quite simple – fruits, grain, or special cakes. The
more famous sort of sacrifice was livestock or farm animals, such as oxen,
bulls, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, or other animals.
Little, everyday sacrifices
Although formal sacrifices and offerings (see the following section ‘Big sacri-
fices’) were part of religious life, the ancient Greeks believed that the gods
could see everything and would pick up on any slight acknowledgement.
Consequently people would make small, almost superstitious offerings
throughout the day.
Additionally, the Greeks thought rivers, forests, and other natural phenomena
were touched by the gods. By dropping pebbles or very small offerings of
food in the river or wherever, people believed they were acknowledging the
power and pervasiveness of the gods. 
The belief that the gods were everywhere went even further. The Greeks
believed that occasionally the gods walked the earth in human form to check
on mankind. They also explained the fact that they occasionally blurted out
something stupid with the expression, ‘Some god put it in my heart to say’.
Try using that explanation next time you say something embarrassing!

Big sacrifices 
At the temple, ancient Greeks cut the throats of the sacrificial animals. (The
resulting blood was often presented as an additional offering.) These activi-
ties wouldn’t take place inside the temple itself but in the grounds around it.
The Greeks had two ways of making sacrifices:
 Sacrificing some part of the animal, and serving the rest. Sometimes
people roasted the animal, and offered a portion to the gods. They 
used the remaining meat to make a formal meal for those attending the
ceremony. This kind of barbeque-like sacrifice was the most common. 
In Greek poetry, the gods are often described as enjoying the smell of
roasting meat as it drifts up to Olympus. 
 Completely burning the entire animal. The total burning of an animal
was usually reserved for a specific purpose. Most often people were
trying to appease the gods. For example, in a case of murder, ancient
Greeks considered the burned animal to count as a ‘one-for-one’ offering
to replace the victim.
So what was the point of sacrifice? The most literal way of understanding the
concept is that you were giving a gift to the gods. Animals were expensive, so
killing a cow or goat was a significant financial offering. Of course, this also
meant a good feed for everybody else involved too! 
Pondering and Predicting the Future
Despite the mystically tinged scenes in lots of Greek plays and even more
modern-day movies, the Greeks did not use prophecies to predict the future.
Instead, they turned to the gods and asked for help in the future or advice on
what to do in the present. 
286
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
Purity is everything
Ritual purification was an essential part of any
ancient Greek religious ceremony. This process
literally meant washing, and in most cases just
washing your hands was enough. The idea of
purification probably comes from the fact that
most Greeks were farmers (or had originally
been farmers), and by washing you were
removing the dirt from yourself and putting work
aside before worshipping the gods. 
Sometimes the purification rituals were extreme
(see the sidebar ‘The Delphic oracle’) and
involved a person cleansing themselves of an
awful act – like a murderer ‘washing the blood
from their hands’.

Divination, or what the Greeks called mantike, involved asking the gods 
questions to try and ensure a happy and prosperous future. The following
sections look at these aspects of Greek religion.
Consulting oracles
The ancient Greeks believed that the gods were involved in a person’s fate,
and ensured that what was meant to happen to them did happen. The gods
didn’t create a person’s fate but it was their responsibility to make sure that
what was fated to happen actually took place. 
One of the most popular ways for an ancient Greek to figure out what to do to
follow their fate was to visit an oracle, a place where the Greeks believed they
could ask someone questions and receive answers from the gods. An oracle
was a place, not a person, and could be anywhere where the gods ‘touched
the world’ such as a stream, a bush, or the inner sanctum of a temple.
Talk to the man
Usually, the person at the oracle was a priest, or hiereus, who was employed
by the shrine or temple. The Greeks didn’t think that the priest had any kind
of magical powers, just the knowledge and skills required to do the job.
In addition to a priest, the temple or shrine sometimes used the services of a
seer, or mantis, to understand the answers of an oracle. A seer wasn’t tied to
any religious institution and worked for private hire. 
Many Greeks were cynical about the service that seers provided because it
was pretty much in the interests of the seer to give a client the answers that
they were looking for! In mythology, seers are often presented as figures who
can actually see into the future, and who are beloved by the gods and in pos-
session of magical abilities. In everyday Greece, it’s unlikely that most people
regarded seers in this way.
Yes, no, er . . . maybe!
Consulting an oracle wasn’t quite as straightforward as it may sound. 
Oracles didn’t predict the future. Instead, they gave advice on what to do 
in the present. The Greeks believed that the future was already set out, or
predetermined. Therefore, they didn’t ask to change it, but rather how to
interpret what they saw around them to help predict how things may be. 
So, for example, a man didn’t visit an oracle and ask how many children his
prospective wife would have. Instead, he asked for advice on whether he
should marry her. If the oracle suggested he should marry, and he did and
287

they subsequently had children, then the oracle developed a reputation for
being able to predict the future. Of course, if the same man married the
woman and the couple didn’t have children, then the ancient Greeks thought
the man had misinterpreted the answer! 
In general, oracles provided answers that were supportive – telling people
what to do to ensure a happy future rather than explaining what that future
would be.
Because an oracle’s response was sometimes quite problematic, the special
skills of a seer were often required to interpret it.
Looking to signs 
The Greeks were very superstitious and saw signs and portents in all kinds of
everyday activities. The flight of birds (known as bird lore), the movement of
leaves, and the flow of running water were all used as methods of interpreting
the will of the gods. Just as with the pronouncements of oracles, a priest or
seer was required to interpret these signs.
Interpreting bird lore was particularly complicated. This inscription from
Ephesus in Asia Minor (dated at about 550 BC) is one of the only surviving
examples of what certain flight patterns meant – and it isn’t exactly 
straightforward!
. . . if the bird flying from left to right disappears from view the omen is
favourable; if it raises its left wing, flies away, and disappears the omen is
unfavourable; if flying from left to right it disappears on a straight course the
omen is unfavourable; but if after raising its right wing, it flies away and
disappears the omen is favourable.
One of the most popular sources of signs was examining the entrails (inner
organs) of recently sacrificed animals. The condition of these organs, espe-
cially the liver, was a method of testing whether the gods supported a course
of action. People often made major decisions about war and diplomatic 
negotiations after examining a sacrifice’s entrails. 
Taking Oaths: ‘I Promise!’
Just as the Greeks used divination and oracles to seek advice about what to
do in life, religion was also a big part of any decisions or deals that they
made. Decisions often took the form of oaths that the Greeks swore, using 
the gods as their witnesses.
288

Swearing of an oath (horkos) meant that you were promising to do some-
thing, such as paying for goods or marrying somebody. Characters in Greek
tragedy often swear oaths, particularly oaths of vengeance where they
promise to avenge a wronged or slain relative and this was fairly common
practice in ancient Greece too. Additionally, if you didn’t do what you
promised, you accepted the punishment of the gods. 
Given that the Greeks only really started using writing in around 750 BC (see
Chapter 1), oaths were also used as a form of verbal contract in business
deals. Merchants entered into trade deals and called upon the gods Hermes
or Poseidon to be the arbiter.
Having Fun with the Gods: 
Festivals and Cults
Most Greek cities had highly defined religious calendars based around big
public festivals. (See Chapter 15 for the intricacies of the ancient Greek calen-
dar.) Some celebrations were massive and went on for days, and others were
held only by a particular town region (deme).
289
Chapter 21: Practising Everyday Religion: ‘A God Put It in My Heart to Say’
The Delphic oracle
The most famous ancient Greek oracle of all
was the one at Delphi in central Greece (see the
Cheat Sheet map). The oracle at Delphi was
extremely old and dated back to around the
ninth century BC. The oracle was dedicated to
Apollo and the centrepiece of the sanctuary
was a large temple devoted to him. Both cities
and individuals – including virtually every
famous figure from ancient Greek history –
asked for the Delphic oracle’s advice. 
Conferring with the Delphic oracle required a
complicated process of purification and sacri-
fice (see the earlier section ‘Sacrificing: Giving
the gods gifts’). The whole thing was supervised
by the pythia, or priestess of the temple. When
asked a question, the priestess went into a
trance and then babbled incoherent sentences,
which arose from her communication with the
god Apollo. The answers were famously
ambiguous, but the Greeks believed that the
gods spoke clearly; any misinterpretations
came down to human stupidity! 
You can still visit Delphi; it’s a beautiful little
town and a fabulous site which I describe in
Chapter 26.

Additionally, smaller religious groups gathered together in the form of 
religious cults that worshipped particular individual divinities. The rules and
regulations around these cults were as strict as they were bizarre. See the
later section ‘Getting cultic: Swimming with pigs and other oddities’ for more.
Observing the religious year
I discuss the complex Athenian calendar in Chapter 15, but the typical reli-
gious calendar of a city was even more complicated. For example, Athenians
gave over 130 days of the year to specific festivals, although many more small
festivals and celebrations also took place. Roughly speaking, something
related to a festival or celebration probably occurred every other day. 
Athenians celebrated about 30 large festivals during the religious year. The
month of Pyanopsion (September/October) featured an impressive six festi-
vals in honour of Apollo, Theseus, Demeter (twice), and Athene (twice).
Some of these festivals were massive; for example, the big drama festivals
like the Country and City Dionysia both went on for several days and took the
form of a major public holiday. Visitors came from far and wide to take part in
these celebrations. 
As I mention in Chapter 16, festivals included all types of activities: dramatic
performances, athletic games, singing and dancing competitions, and large
amounts of feasting and drinking. The public purse and donations from
wealthier citizen paid for these events. 
Although religious celebration was the main point of festivals, they weren’t
sober and restrained events – quite the reverse! All sorts of ribaldry took
place with much drinking and carousing. If you want a modern equivalent, try
New Year’s Eve crossed with the Glastonbury Festival!

Private healthcare: The sanctuary at Epidauros 
Asclepius, the god of healing, had one of 
the most famous places of worship dedicated 
to him at Epidauros. Greeks visited the shrine
and asked for advice on curing their illnesses.
Asclepius didn’t have any real connection 
with Epidauros, but the priests there invented
one; the site became second only to Delphi 
(see the sidebar ‘The Delphic oracle’) in visitor
numbers. 
Despite its popularity, people didn’t expect
instant cures from the sanctuary at Epidauros.
As at Delphi, all answers from the gods had to
be interpreted by the priests, who weren’t doc-
tors. What the priests advised usually went
against what Hippocratic doctors of the time
would have prescribed. Nevertheless, a huge
amount of money was spent in asking the
priests’ advice!

The Olympian gods (refer to Chapter 19) each had a sacred day every month
as well. Often these holidays included ceremonies that were specific to a 
particular deme.
On lesser religious holidays, things were often simpler. Just one relatively
small sacrifice to a specific god may be required. 
Getting cultic: Swimming with 
pigs and other oddities
These days the idea of a religious cult has slightly sinister overtones. The
word is currently used to describe unusual groups that shut themselves 
away from the world. In ancient Greece, however, the idea of a religious cult
was very aspirational. Joining a cult was a sign of social status because 
membership was very closely guarded.
All the other festivals and ceremonies that I mention in this chapter were
public experiences; everyone could join in, and participation occurred in the
gathering areas of town and cities such as the agora (see Chapter 18). Cults
were different. Although cults may involve a large number of people in a 
ceremony, the experience of the individual was intended to be quite personal.
This was the nearest that ancient Greek religion got to the notion of a 
spiritual experience.
291
Chapter 21: Practising Everyday Religion: ‘A God Put It in My Heart to Say’
Two notable festivals: The Panathenaia 
and the Thesmophoria
One of the biggest festivals in ancient Athens
was the Panathenaia, which celebrated the city
and its patron goddess Athena (see Chapter 19).
The festival was held every year in the month of
Hekatombaion (June/July) and was effectively
a new year celebration. The Athenians made
huge processions, and the main one involved
the transporting of a robe (peplos) for the god-
dess Athene. The procession is depicted in the
frieze of the Parthenon, parts of which are on
display in the British Museum.
The Panathenaia was a very nationalistic 
festival and was rooted in the idea of celebrat-
ing Athenian supremacy over other Greeks. 
The Athenians made the celebration even
bigger once every four years and called it the
Great Panathenaia.
One of the more notorious festivals was the
women-only Thesmophoria, which was held
throughout Greece in the autumn. Men were
banned from the festival, which was held in
honour of Demeter. Only married women of
cities were allowed to attend and they left town
and held secret rites away in the countryside.
These activities were usually very mysterious
and are mocked by Aristophanes in his 
play Thesmophoriazousai, in which the women
spend a lot of time drinking. (Okay, there’s 
probably some truth in this!)

Because the spiritual experience of cults was considered to be so extraordi-
nary, the various cults were incredibly closely organised with very strict
rules. This inscription from the site of the Spring of the Nymphs at Delos
gives a good idea of how respectful people had to be of cult places – in this
case a spring.
Do not wash anything in the spring, or swim in the spring, or throw into the
spring manure or anything else. Penalty: two sacred drachmas.
Major cults like the Eleusinian Mysteries were open to all but others might 
be restricted to people in a certain trade or guild (for example, a group of
tradesmen like potters or ironmongers). Equally, the nature of the rites might
prove prohibitive to some people because of the costs involved. It seems cer-
tain that more exclusive and bizarre cults took place amongst the mega-rich
but unfortunately historians don’t really know anything about them.
292
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
The Eleusinian Mysteries
By far the most famous cult was the Eleusinian
Mysteries. Even now, historians don’t know pre-
cisely what went on during the cult’s festivals. At
the time, the secrets of their ritual were closely
guarded, with dire penalties for those who broke
the rules. Scholars do know that the cult was
based around the myth of Persephone and
Demeter (see Chapter 13) and involved a process
that recreated the journey into Hades. The final
ceremony apparently revealed a glimpse of the
afterlife to the initiates.
The ritual took place during late summer (proba-
bly during Boedromion) in the deme of Eleusis in
Athens. The ritual was open to anybody Greek-
speaking, although they had to pay hefty fees to
take part. The purification and initiation rituals
were very complicated. Every participant had to
wash a young pig in the sea and then sacrifice it,
and they also had to wear special clothes and
fast from certain foods. The whole experience
took several days and was regarded by the
ancient Greeks as a life-changing one.
The following excerpt comes from one of the so-
called ‘Homeric Hymns’, religious songs in the
style of Homer (see Chapter 20). The song deals
with Demeter, Persephone, and the mysteries.
To all Demeter revealed the conduct of her
rites and mysteries . . . dread mysteries
which one may not in any way transgress or
learn of or utter . . . Happy is he of mortal men
who has seen these things. . . .

Trying to Figure Everything 
Out: Greek Philosophy
In This Chapter
 Pondering existence with the early Greek philosophers
 Chatting with Socrates and Plato
 Getting scientific with Aristotle and others
A
t first glance, Greek philosophy can seem quite intimidating. Most 
books on the subject have front covers with pictures of marble busts 
of serious, slightly angry looking men with big bushy beards. What’s inside
these books can seem just as intimidating – but a lot of the time, the ideas,
insights, and explanations are actually quite simple.
In this chapter I look at how the very idea of philosophy developed in 
ancient Greece and share what some of the major figures thought about 
all manner of topics, including existence, morality, and the nature of the 
universe. The ancient Greek philosophers are a strange bunch with some
weird and outlandish ideas – but they’re quite fun too!
Making the Case for Philosophy
In Chapters 19, 20, and 21, I look at the mythical gods and heroes and how
the Greek religion dominated virtually all aspects of ancient Greek life. Their
religion gave the Greeks a pretty closely defined idea of what their world was
like and where it came from – but for some people unanswered questions 
still existed. 
Greek philosophy grew out of the earliest philosophers’ desire to explain the
world around them, including such major issues as:
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

 Where everything came from.
 What the world was made of.
 What happened when you died.
The word used to describe the philosopher’s drive is reason, a desire to
understand and explain things instead of accepting religious or spiritual
explanations. And as I discuss in Chapters 19, 20, and 21, ancient Greek 
religion was full of holes and logical gaps; the gods that filled its ranks 
were frequently vengeful, childish, and downright unpleasant. Some folks
hungered for different – and hopefully better – answers.
Writing in the fifth century BC, the philosopher Xenophanes sums up the
problem.
Both Homer and Hesiod have attributed all things to the gods, as many as
shameful and a reproach amongst mankind, thieving and adultery and
deceiving each other.
So if the gods weren’t the answer to everything, then what was? Philosophy
came into being when some the ancient Greeks tried to work it all out.
The term philosopher means ‘lover of wisdom’ and comes from the Greek
word sophia meaning wisdom. Greek philosophers were all men from varied
backgrounds. Philosophers like Socrates and Plato were aristocrats and a
full-time philosopher would need to be wealthy to be able to spend all day
pontificating! 
Other people were interested in philosophy too, though, and discussion was
very fashionable amongst the educated classes.
Meeting the Early Greek Philosophers 
Scholars generally refer to the earliest Greek philosophers as the pre-Socratics
because they were around before Socrates, the most famous figure in Greek
philosophy. See the later section ‘Creating the ‘New Philosophy’ with
Socrates’ for more on this great Greek. 
The pre-Socratics weren’t really philosophers in the sense that you might
think of a philosopher today. Most of them didn’t write books or engage in
lectures or teaching. Really, these men just asked questions and looked for
answers in the world that they saw about them. They were unhappy with 
the explanations that mythology provided (see Chapter 19), and looked for
alternatives in the natural world and its elements. Truly they were ‘lovers 
of wisdom’.
294

Although the pre-Socratics didn’t really come up with definite answers, 
they started the process of enquiry, encouraging others to explore different
questions and challenge orthodox beliefs. 
One of the problems with looking at the pre-Socratic philosophers is that
very few sources are available. Some of the earliest philosophers didn’t 
write anything down at all, whereas the books of others are now lost. This
dearth of original texts means that modern scholars must rely on later Greek
writers (such as Xenophon and Aristotle) who compiled large compendiums
of philosophy that include fragments of the early philosophers’ work.
Happily, enough material is available to get a good idea of their theories.
This section is just a small survey of what I regard as some of the most
important pre-Socratic philosophers. Loads of others – including Zeno,
Anaxagoras, Melissus, Philolaus, Leucippus, Democritus, and many more –
are well worth looking into if you want something interesting to think about!
Using the online encylopedia Wikipedia (at www.wikipedia.co.uk) is a
great place to start but if you’re looking for a book try Early Greek Philosophy
edited by Jonathan Barnes and published by Penguin Classics.
Using their eyes: Thales and Anaximander 
Two of the earliest notable pre-Socratic philosophers were Thales and
Anaximander. They both came from the town of Miletus on the south-western
coast of Asia Minor and were active around 580 BC. 
Although historians aren’t fully certain, Thales’s work seems to have come
first, and Anaximander appears to have been a pupil or follower of Thales.
It’s probably no coincidence that these earliest philosophers came from
Miletus because the town received visitors from all over the Mediterranean
and the east. The mixture of ideas and theories that must have been present
among the population makes the location a natural place for enquiring minds. 
Both of these men’s investigations were based on looking at the world 
around them and drawing conclusions from what they saw in nature. Modern
scholars call this process observational philosophy.
Water, water everywhere
Both Thales and Anaximander were concerned with the idea of the four key
elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Their idea was that everything in the
world was in some way made up of these four things. 
295
Chapter 22: Trying to Figure Everything Out: Greek Philosophy

Thales’s big concern was water. He seems to have looked at the world around
him and decided that just as the land he stood on was surrounded by water,
the whole of the earth must be too. This notion was in line with the old Greek
view that the earth was an island entirely surrounded by water, rather like
the yolk in a fried egg (see Chapter 19). 
Thales took his speculation further though. He thought that water was the
essential element of all things. Humans, plants, and animals all need water to
survive; therefore, according to Thales, water was the essential stuff of life
and what everything was made from. The Greeks referred to this concept as
the arche meaning ‘first principle’ or ‘beginning’.
Thales also came up with interesting theories about other things, among
them the idea that a magnet must have a soul. He based this idea on the fact
that a magnet can make things move; therefore, it must have intelligence and,
accordingly, a soul.
Getting cosmic 
As a pupil or follower of Thales, Anaximander went on to investigate further
and and more widely than Thales. Anaximander was alleged to have been one
of the first people to draw a map of the inhabited world and to come up with
a theory as to how the universe and the heavens were formed. This subject
was known as cosmology, and many argue that Anaximander invented it.
The cosmology that Anaximander came up with is a bit trippy and mad! It
involves all four key elements working together to produce large flat discs 
(of which the earth is one) that make up the universe. All natural things like
humans, animals, and the weather are created when the elements stop 
working together and separate. 
Thales and Anaximander were interesting, if misguided. Still, they were 
celebrated by subsequent ancient Greeks for being the two men who first
thought differently and encouraged other people to theorise about big impor-
tant questions. You may say that their biggest discovery was the process of 
philosophy itself.
Pondering existence: Parmenides,
Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and others
After Thales and Anaximander opened the philosophical floodgates, many
other people began to ask difficult questions about the world around them. 
Some of the later pre-Socratics took huge steps forward by trying to ask ques-
tions about the nature of existence itself. What did it mean to live and die; to
exist and then to stop existing?
296
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief

A bit of a show-off
One of the first philosophers to ask about existence itself in detail was
Parmenides, who came from Elea, a Greek town in southern Italy. Like many
of the other pre-Socratics, precise birth and death dates aren’t available, 
but he was alive and probably visited Athens in about 450 BC.
Parmenides’s big concern was to answer the question of how something
comes into existence and then later ceases to be. He discussed this question
in a long poem called the ‘Way of Truth’, which seems a little like showing off:
How, whence, did it grow? That it came from what is not I shall not allow
you to say or think – for it is not sayable or thinkable that it is not. And what
need would have impelled it, later or earlier, to grow – if it began from
nothing?
In the end Parmenides decided that everything exists and that anything that
you can imagine comes into existence after you imagine it. So, for example,
while you’re reading this book, if you imagine me, the author, riding a giant
dragon, then that dragon exists because you imagined it. Blimey! A handy
trick, indeed!
Further to this notion, Parmenides believed that everything that exists
always has done and always will do in some form or other. This theory was
known to the Greeks as the Immutable One.
Constant change
Across the other side of the Mediterranean in Ephesus was another philoso-
pher called Heraclitus (circa 525–475 BC). His theory about existence was
very different to Parmenides. In fact, it was the absolute opposite. 
Heraclitus’s major theory was that everything is in a constant state of
change, or flux. Everything needs to move or change in order to progress 
and grow. Heraclitus’s view was also the opposite of Anaximander’s idea 
that the four elements had to be in order for the universe to work (see the
preceding section ‘Using their eyes: Thales and Anaximander’).
A great example of Heraclitus’s state of change theory is that, if you put your
foot in a river, by the time you take it out again the water has flowed over it
and the river has changed. If you put your foot in again, the river is no longer
the river that you put your foot into originally. The constantly changing 
experience of a river is, in essence, what Heraclitus thought about the whole
nature of existence.
Reincarnation: ‘I think I’ve been here before’
Parmenides and Heraclitus tackled the question of existence and came up
with some answers. In both cases, they were really motivated by a desire 
to explain what happened before birth and after death. 
297
Chapter 22: Trying to Figure Everything Out: Greek Philosophy

Other pre-Socratic philosophers looked at this question from another per-
spective. If what Parmenides said was true about all matter always existing
now and in the future, then what happened to the soul, or psyche, after the
body died? One idea that was very fashionable was the idea of reincarnation.
Reincarnation was not a purely Greek idea, having first been discussed in
places as far away as Egypt and Mesopotamia. Still, several pre-Socratic
philosophers promoted this concept. This quote from Empedocles (circa 
450 BC) sums up reincarnation nicely.
For already I have been born as a boy and a girl and a bush and a bird and
a dumb fish leaping out of the sea.
The man who popularised the notion of reincarnation was Pythagoras, 
probably the most famous of all the pre-Socratic philosophers and a hugely
controversial figure. Active in the sixth century BC, Pythagoras originally
came from Samos but spent a large part of his life in southern Italy. He was
also rumoured to have magically appeared in many other cities in both 
southern Italy and Greece.
Pythagoras is credited with a huge number of discoveries and theories,
including a particularly famous geometric principle (see the nearby sidebar
‘The Pythagorean Theorem: Maths and stuff’). However, because he wrote
nothing down, historians know very little about him. Scholars have pieced
together the following:
 Pythagoras’s big theory was based around the idea of metempsychosis,
which means the movement of the soul between physical bodies, a 
particular kind of reincarnation. One story suggests that Pythagoras
stopped a man beating a puppy because he recognised the dog as one 
of his old friends by its bark!
 Pythagoras was famed for his wide knowledge, and some people attrib-
uted him with magical powers. He was rumoured to have had a thigh
made of gold and to have killed a poisonous snake by biting it first. 
Whatever the actualities behind these stories, Pythagoras built up a huge 
following. His followers became a kind of cult and closely guarded the details
of their lifestyle. They built their lives around his teaching, on principles
based on music, harmony, and a very proscriptive diet – such as eating beans
to keep you regular! These individuals continued to work on Pythagoras’s
principles long after his death (or reincarnation?). 
Perhaps Pythagoras’s biggest achievement was to boost the interest in 
philosophy in those that followed him.
Jumping into the flames
One of Pythagoras’s most famous followers was Empedocles (circa 490–460
BC). Indeed, Empedocles’s writings preserved many of Pythagoras’s ideas. 
298
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Like Parmenides (see the preceding section ‘A bit of a show-off’), Empedocles
wrote in verse form. His long poem called The Purifications was one of the
first attempts to align philosophy and Greek religion. In it, he introduced an
element of moral philosophy that was very important to later thinkers (see
the following section ‘Creating the ‘New Philosophy’ with Socrates’).
Empedocles was convinced of the idea of metempsychosis (see the preced-
ing ‘Reincarnation: ‘I think I’ve been here before’); particularly that the soul
was immortal (and thus like a god). According to a long-held tradition,
Empedocles set out to prove this idea by throwing himself into the volcano 
of Mount Etna in Sicily, telling his followers that he would return in another
form. As far as I know, the world is still waiting for his reappearance!
Creating the ‘New Philosophy’ 
with Socrates 
Socrates is one of the most famous of the ancient Greeks, partly because 
of his terrible execution by Athens in 399 BC (see Chapter 9), but mostly
because he was responsible for creating the new kind of philosophy that 
was developed in Athens in the fifth century BC. 
Like Pythagoras (see the preceding section ‘Reincarnation: ‘I think I’ve been
here before’), Socrates never wrote anything down. Modern readers are
reliant on his followers (mostly Plato and Xenophon) for what survives about
Socrates’s philosophy today.

Chapter 22: Trying to Figure Everything Out: Greek Philosophy
The Pythagorean Theorem: Maths and stuff
You’re probably familiar with Pythagoras
because you were taught his famous theorem at
school:
The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the
sum of the squares on the other two sides.
Many of the pre-Socratics (as well as later
philosophers) were intensely interested in math-
ematics and used it to work out many of their the-
ories. The study of mathematics and particularly
geometry was a very important concern in
ancient Greece, and the work of people such as
Euclid was responsible for real discoveries. 
I don’t delve into ancient Greek mathematics in
this chapter because I think philosophy is very
different from maths. What’s interesting to me
are the tremendous leaps of imagination that
these various philosophers took in thinking about
the world and nature of existence. Another
reason is that I’m rubbish at maths!

Socrates’s major interest was different from that of the pre-Socratics. He
wasn’t really interested in cosmology and questions of reincarnation. Instead,
he was far more concerned with why people acted the way they did. His
theory was that people should always try to do well and do the right thing.
This stance is why he’s credited with being the person who invented moral
philosophy.
Talking with Socrates: Socratic dialogue
In addition to his focus on moral philosophy, Socrates’s method of enquiry
was also quite different. The process basically involved asking questions of
people and challenging their assumptions. Socrates always did this question-
ing in the spirit of finding out an answer, because he didn’t think he knew
everything. Indeed, he’s famously attributed for saying, ‘All that I know is that
I know nothing.’
These conversations between Socrates and his educated friends – Socratic
dialogues – began with Socrates asking a question of the person who he was
talking to and then interrogating (and eventually overturning) that person’s
answer. 
Usually, the question was about some kind of moral quality such as bravery
or friendship, although Socrates seemingly discussed absolutely everything.
In this dialogue called Charmides (recorded by Plato), Socrates talks about
the issue of keeping to doing one’s own job and whether doing so shows self-
control. Have a look at the way the conversation goes – the process of the
discussion is more important than the subject.
‘Well then,’ I [Socrates] said, ‘do you think a state would be well run by a
law like this, which commands each person to weave his own coat and
wash it, and make his own sandals and oil-flask and scraper and everything
else on the same principle of each person keeping his hands off what is not
his own, and working at and doing his own job?’
‘No, I don’t,’ he replied.
‘Nevertheless,’ I said, ‘a state run on the principle of self-control would be
run well.’
‘Certainly,’ he said.
‘Then,’ I said, ‘self-control would not be doing one’s own job when it’s of that

This is a typical piece of Socratic dialogue. Socrates asks an opinion and 
then fleshes it out with examples, each of which chip away at the original
opinion until the idea is shown to be worthless or affirmed in some way. The
whole conversation is presented very nicely and he isn’t antagonistic, but if
you saw Socrates in the street, you’d probably cross the road to avoid him!
Getting better at being good
Many of Socrates’s dialogues argue about moral qualities: courage, self-
control, reason, knowledge, and so on. These are all qualities that you can
improve by practice. Socrates argues that by getting a better understanding
of what bravery is, you can act in a braver fashion. It’s an interesting 
point of view.
It’s difficult to know what Socrates actually believed himself. All the out-
comes of the dialogues are exactly that – the conclusion of a conversation.
Scholars and modern readers can’t accept the resolution of Socratic dia-
logues as being Socrates’s beliefs. The only real belief that becomes consis-
tent is a true desire for knowledge and to find answers. Like the pre-Socratics
before him, Socrates was a true ‘lover of wisdom’.
Eventually, asking too many questions made Socrates unpopular and led 
to his death (see Chapter 9). He died a martyr and was responsible for 
fundamentally changing ancient Greece’s – and indeed the world’s – ideas 
of philosophy. 
Selling philosophy: The sophists 
Socrates also influenced the development of the sophists. Sophists were
essentially philosophers for hire, although many of them had no real interest
in philosophy. 
Sophists took the principles of Socratic dialogue (for instance, disproving an
idea) and turned them to profit. They sold their services to people who were
about to go to court and needed coaching in how to represent themselves.
Some people alleged that sophists had no interest in the truth, merely in 
winning arguments. 
Some sophists also provided training in speaking and argument to the sons 
of rich men who wanted to enter politics. These skills were tremendously
useful in the boule and elsewhere to gain the votes of the demos.

Unfortunately, all the surviving sources on sophists are very biased. People
like Plato (see the following section ‘Leaving Philosophy to the Professionals:
Plato’) wrote about the sophists but hated them for what they did with
Socrates’s form of philosophy. Still, some ancient Greeks must have used the
services of sophists for truly philosophical purposes.
One particularly big piece of anti-sophist and anti-philosophy propaganda 
is Aristophanes’s play The Clouds. In it, Socrates is portrayed as running a
‘School for Sophists’ in which he teaches young men not to believe in the
gods. None of this was true! Socrates was no sophist and he also never ran 
a school. Then again, Aristophanes never let the truth get in the way of a
good joke!
Leaving Philosophy to the 
Professionals: Plato
After Socrates died in 399 BC, Greek philosophy went from strength to
strength. The next great figure was Plato (circa 428–347 BC). 
Historians know very little about Plato’s life, and many of the facts about him
are highly disputed. However, scholars agree that: 
 Plato was originally a follower of Socrates.
 After Socrates’s death, Plato left Athens and travelled around the
Mediterranean, returning when he was about 40 and founding the
famous school of philosophy known as the Academy.
 Plato’s Academy flourished for the best part of a thousand years until it
was finally closed by the Byzantine emperor Justinian in AD 529.
Aside from establishing the Academy, another reason that Plato became 
so famous was the huge number of philosophical works that he wrote and
published, many of which still survive. Nearly all of them are written in 
dialogue form with Socrates as the main character. They explore a wide range
of subjects, although Plato’s favourite themes were justice, epistemology
(the theory of knowledge), and theories about art. 
Living in an ideal world: The Republic
Probably Plato’s most famous work was The Republic, a very long dialogue
based around the idea of creating an ideal state. The dialogue starts with a
302
Part IV: Mythology, Religion, and Belief 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

discussion about the true nature of justice. In Greek the word for justice is
dike and it has a rather wider meaning; something along the lines of rightness
or correctness is one version. To try to define what justice actually is ,
Socrates sets out what he sees as a potential ideal society.
The model he comes up with is one with a very regulated class system.
People are born into the system and do jobs according to their classes. A
group known as the Philosopher Rulers govern the state, because only they
possess the wisdom and self-control to make objective decisions for the 
good of the whole community.
This model was a fairly controversial set of ideas because it rejected the
democratic system that Athens had at the time in favour of rule by the few –
an oligarchy (see Chapter 4). 
But why did Plato only trust the rule of philosophers?
Exploring the Theory of the Forms
The main reason Plato advocated a group of Philosopher Rulers comes from
his big theory of existence known as the Theory of the Forms. In this theory
Plato argues that everything you see around you isn’t actually the real world
but only a shadowy copy of it. The Forms are the one true version of every-
thing. Only a philosopher is able to comprehend and understand the Forms,
so only a philosopher is fit to make decisions for a whole city or state.
Plato illustrates his Theory of the Forms in The Republic by using the simile
of the cave. He describes a group of people held in a cave who see only 
the shadows made by reflections on a wall; this is their whole world. These
reflections are of real life going on outside the cave. Eventually, a few break
free and go outside into the light while the rest remain in the cave. Those
who go outside are the philosophers searching for truth. The rest are inside,
still watching the shadows and believing them to be real. 
If this all sounds a bit like The Matrix film trilogy where the character of 
Neo suddenly becomes aware that his whole life has been a fabrication and
another, ‘real’ world exists, you’re right. Fortunately, not even Plato is as
complicated as The Matrix movies!
Plato was so keen on philosophers because he regarded them as the only
people who were totally objective and focused on discovering the truth.
Thus, only philosophers were able to make decisions that weren’t corrupted
by their own vice or prejudice. This quote from The Republic sums up 
the idea:
303

The society we have described can never grow into a reality or see the 
light of day, and there will be no end to the troubles of states, or indeed my
dear Glaucon, of humanity itself, till philosophers become kings in this
world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become
philosophers. . . .
At least Plato was true to his word. His whole life was spent searching for the
truth and helping teach others to do so. Later in his life he spent some time
in Sicily and when he died he was buried in his academy.
Meeting the Man Who Knew 
Everything: Aristotle
One of the most famous graduates from Plato’s Academy was Aristotle
(384–322 BC), the final great figure in Greek philosophy. (Aristotle also pops
up briefly in Chapter 10, working as tutor to Alexander the Great.)
Aristotle originally came from Stageira in the north of Greece. Although 
he spent a great deal of his life in Athens, he was never granted citizen 
status and lived there as a metoikos or resident alien (see Chapter 14). 
He established his own school – known as the Lyceum – outside the city 
of Athens.
Thinking scientifically
Two things made Aristotle very different from the other philosophers that
came before him:
 Aristotle was much more interested in knowledge gained by the five
senses than by intellectual reason. 
 Aristotle was interested in absolutely everything – all areas of human
endeavour including politics, botany, medicine, ethical philosophy, 
literary criticism, and more. 
In many ways, Aristotle’s method was like a combination of the pre-Socratics
(see the earlier section ‘Meeting the Early Greek Philosophers’) and the
philosophers who followed. Whatever the topic, Aristotle took the same
method of scientific enquiry. He became known as an empiricist (meaning
someone having an interest in studying all aspects of human endeavour), and
his methods formed the basis of scientific study that followed for centuries.

Checking out some of Aristotle’s 
greatest hits
The sheer volume of work that Aristotle produced in his lifetime is difficult to
calculate. His major works include:
 Physics: On nature, life, and how the mind works.
 Metaphysics: On logic and reason.
 Ethics: On ethical dilemmas and doing the right thing.
 Politics: A survey of all political systems and their problems.
 Poetics: On plays on poetry and their themes (see Chapter 16).
Aristotle also wrote books on plant and animal life, medicine, the true nature
of the soul, and rhetoric. Talk about a busy guy!
Venturing into Aristotle’s Ethics
With so many different books by Aristotle, choosing just one is difficult. That
said, Ethics is a really good introduction to Aristotle’s style of enquiry. Like
Socrates, Aristotle believed that virtues are skills that you can improve with
practice; so if you make a constant effort to be generous to others, eventually
you do it without thinking, as a matter of course.
Generally speaking, Aristotle decided that good behaviour takes place 
when you avoid extremes and exercise moderation. Take this example of 
the dangers of being either vulgar or, at the other end of the scale, boorish
and sour.
Those who go too far in being funny are regarded as buffoons and vulgar persons
who exert themselves to be funny at all costs and who are set upon raising a
laugh than upon decency of expression and consideration for their victim’s feel-
ings. Those who both refuse to say anything funny themselves and take exception
to the jokes of other people are regarded as boorish and sour.
In the end Aristotle decides that the best course is to take the middle path,
exhibit good taste, and be ‘nimble-witted’. He comes to similar conclusions
with almost all ethical issues. Later writers refer to this idea as the Doctrine 
of the Golden Mean (‘mean’ meaning average, or the middle path), although
Aristotle never called it that.

Moving On: Hellenistic 
Science and Beyond
One of the impacts of both Aristotle and the conquests of Alexander the
Great (see Chapter 11) was a huge upsurge of interest in the sciences during
the Hellenistic period. The rich kings who succeeded Alexander spent huge
amounts of money on scientific development and sponsoring the foundation
of academies and libraries. 
 Geometry and mathematics were areas of interest to such notable 
men as Euclid (325–265 BC) and Archimedes (circa 287–212 BC; see
Chapter 24). Some principles that the two men defined last until 
this day.
 Astronomy was another area of interest, particularly the study of the
position of the earth in relation to the stars. The father of astronomy
was Hipparchus (circa 190–120 BC), who constructed the first celestial
globe, a model of the universe as he understood it.
The discoveries of these scientists and others were very influential. Although
much of their work was lost during the medieval period, Renaissance 
scientists like Galileo rediscovered and expanded upon significant portions.
And Greek philosophy didn’t stop with Aristotle – far from it. During the
Hellenistic and early Roman periods, philosophy expanded and definite
schools emerged – in particular, a rivalry developed between the Epicureans
and Stoics. Throughout the Mediterranean, figures of learning tended to 
classify themselves into one of these two groups, despite the fact that they
believed in very similar things. But that’s a story to check out in The Romans
For Dummies by Guy de la Bedoyere (Wiley).

Ten Great Greek Inventions
In This Chapter
 Sampling Archimedes’s brilliance
 Getting from here to there
 Making the marks on big ideas – writing, history, democracy, and more
T
hroughout Parts I to IV, I mention all sorts of things that the ancient
Greeks were the first to come up with, discover, or bring into being. In
this chapter I pick out ten of the best! Subsequent generations definitely owe
the Greeks a big thank you for the following.
Archimedes’s Inventions
Archimedes himself wasn’t an invention – but he was an incredibly prolific
inventor, in addition to being a mathematician, physicist, and astronomer.
He was born in Syracuse on the island of Sicily in 287 BC and spent most of
his life there. A huge number of inventions are attributed to him. Many of
them are military-based and were used by the Sicilians to fight naval battles
against the invading Romans. Specifically, Archimedes invented:
 A fearsome claw that attackers used to fix their ships onto that of their
opponents. (See Chapter 5 for more on ancient Greek naval techniques.)
It really worked and helped the Syracusans fight the Romans.
 The Archimedes screw, a device that was used for raising water from a
low-lying source to higher ground; Archimedes screws are still found in
irrigation systems today. According to the old story, Archimedes got the
idea for this invention in the bath and shouted ‘Eureka!’ meaning ‘I have
discovered it!’

Much of the rest of his life was spent on mathematical calculations, particu-
larly developing ideas about spheres and cylinders. He died in Syracuse when
the Romans finally conquered and sacked the city in 211 BC. He was buried in
a tomb designed according to his own principle (that a sphere has two-thirds
the volume and surface area of the circumscribing cylinder – phew!). What a
man. 
The Railway
Yes, it’s true. The ancient Greeks did have a railway – of sorts. 
The first version was just a rutway with tracks dug in the ground to move
heavy carts more easily, but in 600 BC a man called Einander of Corinth
developed a trackway paved with hard limestone. It was used to haul ships
across the Isthmus of Corinth, allowing people to avoid the long journey by
boat around southern Greece when travelling from the west coast to the
Aegean. The railway doesn’t exist any more and ships use the Corinthian
canal instead.
Modern historians have classified this trackway as a railway, although it
wasn’t used for public transport. Just as well because no Greek came up with
a solution to the problem of leaves on the line.
The Steam Engine
Crazy as it may seem, the Greeks came very close to creating a working
steam engine! The man behind this enterprise was the aptly-named Hero of
Alexandria. He was born in AD 10 when Egypt was under the control of the
Roman Empire. Yes, he is a little out of the period of ancient Greece covered
in this book, but I’m going to include him anyway! 
The device that Hero came up with was a ball fixed onto a pivot over a caul-
dron. When the contents of the cauldron boiled, the ball span – creating a
steam engine. Unfortunately nobody really knew what to do with Hero’s
invention.

Vending Machines
This invention comes from Hero of Alexandria as well. He invented a machine
that responded to having a coin dropped into the slot at the top. The wooden
device dispensed holy water into a cup placed underneath by those visiting a
shrine. If only he had invented the Mars Bar as well – he could’ve made a
mint!
Writing
Around 750 BC the Greeks began to use a system of notation that eventually
developed into the Greek alphabet and from then on into the first European
language. See Chapter 1 for more details on this life-changing invention.
Writing varied hugely from place to place within the ancient Greek world, but
by the fifth century it had developed into a common language. It’s probably
fair to say that I wouldn’t be writing this book in English if the Greeks hadn’t
invented Greek. Well done them!
History
Okay, so the ancient Greeks didn’t invent history – it’s all around, happening
all by itself, after all. But they did invent writing about history. 
Before the Greeks had their language, events and history were passed down
verbally, but eventually history began to be written down too. 
Herodotus’s Histories (written 431 BC–425 BC) were the first attempt to write
down the history of Greece and are an entertaining if unreliable read. History
writing really began with Thucydides’s History of the Peloponnesian War 
(written in 431 BC), a lengthy historical text about a big event (see Chapter 8),
written by someone who was actually there. 
Comedy
Like history, comedy has always been around, but the ancient Greeks were
the first to turn it into a genre. 
311

The comic plays of writers like Aristophanes (circa 456 BC–386 BC), took 
contemporary political situations and mixed them with farce and fantasy to
produce satirical comedies that influenced subsequent sources of laughter 
in everything from commedia del arte, pantomime, modern satire, and even
late-night sketch comedy. Aristophanes’s greatest plays are still translated
and performed today.
Later comic writers like Menander (circa 342–291 BC) removed the satirical
elements and produced a kind of comedy of manners that influenced later
playwrights from Shakespeare to Noel Coward. 
Money
Coinage was a very definite ancient Greek invention. The Greek towns in Asia
Minor began to use formal coinage in about 600 BC, replacing the old system
of bartering with goods. Initially only a few varieties of coin were used but by
the Hellenistic period (from 350 BC onwards), systems of paper money trans-
fer had been developed. 
The Romans eventually took over all these monetary systems in order to
exact punitive taxes on their colonies. So the Greeks are in part responsible
for your council tax bill. Thanks very much!
Musical Notation
Music was a very important part of Greek life, accompanying all religious cer-
emonies, celebrations, and dramatic performances. The theory behind music
was of great interest to both philosophers and mathematicians, in particular
Aristoxenus of Tarrentum (circa 350 BC). 
In around 300 BC the Greeks developed a system of melodic notation that
enabled music to be written down. Two different systems were developed:
one for vocal music and one for instrumental, using signs developed from let-
ters of the alphabet. This system didn’t really record melody and rhythm in
the way that the modern system of eight tones in an octave does, but for the
simpler music of ancient Greece it worked perfectly well and became stan-
dard throughout the ancient world up until around the fifth century AD.
About 50 scores have survived from the ancient world from various inscrip-
tions and manuscripts. When performed, it’s a spare delicate music played
on only a few instruments and is quite reminiscent of traditional Japanese
music.

Democracy
Whether the democracy developed in Athens was the first in the world is a
controversial issue. Many scholars have come up with other examples of rep-
resentative government that took place earlier in areas as far away as Africa. 
In a sense the exact chronology of democracy doesn’t matter. The Athenian
Greeks didn’t know about other regions’ governmental practices but still
decided through a lengthy process of social change that the whole city
should vote on issues of government via a participative democracy. 
Athenian democracy wasn’t a perfect system (see Chapter 7). It denied any
role to women, for example, but it was the first European democracy and one
that many others have claimed as an inspiration.

In This Chapter
 Perusing plays
 Delving into history
 Getting philosophical
 Pondering poems
A
t this point, maybe you’ve nearly finished reading this book – if so, 
congratulations and thanks for sticking with it! Or maybe you’re just
starting to get to know the ancient Greeks. Wherever you are in the process,
one of best ways to explore the ancient Greeks is through their own words, in
the plays, poetry, and prose they left behind.
So if you’ve enjoyed The Ancient Greeks For Dummies or you want to gain a
better understanding of some the topics, events, or people I cover in this
book, here are ten things to try next.
When reading ancient Greek literature the translation is vitally important!
Many translations are available of all the works that I mention in this book
but I always recommend choosing the Penguin Classics. A real attempt has
been made to capture the spirit of the originals in the translations. Also, all
the editions have excellent introductory notes and many have indexes.
If possible, get an audio version of Homer’s works. Both The Iliad and 
The Odyssey were originally composed to be listened to. Only when you hear
the words spoken do you get a real sense of the poetic devices and tremen-
dous powers of plotting and construction that the poet had.

The Iliad: Homer
As I state in Chapter 20, The Iliad is the most important work of Greek litera-
ture. The ancient Greeks looked to Homer for guidance on the widest possi-
ble range of issues – everything from fighting and shipbuilding to hospitality
and honourable behaviour. 
Although a relatively simple story, the poem is a treasury of mythological
characters and human and deity relationships. The central figure of Achilles,
the greatest Greek warrior, is powerfully dramatic as he sits out the fighting
and struggles with his own pride and anger before personal tragedy brings
him back into the war. 
Interesting Fact: Book Two ‘The Catalogue of Ships’ is often a difficult read for
modern readers, but the ancient Greeks regarded it as the most impressive of
the entire poem for its tremendous listing of warriors and their families.
The Odyssey: Homer
The Odyssey is the companion piece to The Iliad. You can read one or the
other individually, but reading them together brings Homer’s genius to light.
In many ways, The Odyssey is a better story than The Iliad and reads much
more like a modern novel. The poem is full of great stories and characters
and is very evocative of a mythological time when almost anything could
happen. And the dramatic conclusion, when Odysseus returns home to
Ithaca to deal with the arrogant suitors that have taken over his home and
are making a play for his wife Penelope, must be read to be believed. 
Interesting Fact: Many modern critics have suggested that the last two books
of The Odyssey aren’t by Homer! They’re slightly different in tone compared
to the preceding 22 books and deal with the fallout after Odysseus has
retuned and defeated the suitors. I’m not sure myself – have a read and see
what you think.
Oedipus the King: Sophocles
If you read just one Greek tragedy, try Oedipus the King. In many ways the
play is the archetypal story of how a man who is too proud is brought down
by the gods. Important questions about destiny, fate, and the role of the 
gods are examined in detail – and aside from this the play is brilliantly 
constructed.
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Oedipus the King is also most likely to give you the full experience of the
ancient Greek dramatic concepts of pathos (suffering) and mathos (gaining
understanding) because you already know the ending and therefore can give
your full concentration to the process. 
Interesting Fact: Aristotle regarded this play as the most perfect of all
tragedies and used it to scientifically analyse the process of writing tragedy
in his Poetics. See if you agree with him!
The Histories: Herodotus
Herodotus’s Histories are a fantastic read. Setting out to explain the reasons
why the Persian Wars started, Herodotus ends up writing a history of Greece
up until his own times. (See Chapter 6 for my take on the Persian Wars.)
Histories isn’t historical writing as scholars regard it today. Herodotus’s text
mixes history, mythology, and hearsay – sometimes even in the same para-
graph! But Herodotus was incredibly widely travelled and he’s sometimes 
the only surviving source for some of the places and events he mentions.
Histories is a perfect holiday read because you can pick up it up, dip into it,
and find some interesting place or story.
Interesting Fact: Early in his life, Herodotus was involved in an attempted
revolt in his home city of Halicarnassus. The revolt failed, Herodotus went
into exile, and began his travelling. Politics’ loss was history’s gain!
Parallel Lives: Plutarch
Plutarch (circa AD 50–120) was a Greek who lived in the Roman Empire and
wrote about the lives of great men from history. He wasn’t a historian in the
conventional sense but more like a modern biographer whose interest was in
the characters of the individuals he wrote about. 
Plutarch’s life of Alexander the Great is a particularly good place to start, but
he also wrote lives of many other Greek figures such as Alcibiades, Pericles,
and Demosthenes.
Interesting Fact: All of Plutarch’s biographies were originally published as
Parallel Lives, in which the biographies of two men are contrasted with each
other, such as the lives of Theseus (Athens’s mythological founder; see
Chapter 20) and Romulus (Rome’s equally mythological founder).

Early Socratic Dialogues: Plato
This recommendation isn’t actually a book by Plato but a collection of some
of the earliest of Socrates’s dialogues that he wrote down. It’s an interesting
and accessible collection of discussions that give a really good idea of the
way that Socrates’s method of discussion worked (see Chapter 22). 
Topics include the difference between love and friendship and the true
nature of aesthetic beauty. These dialogues are a really good introduction to
Plato’s style and a great place to start if you want to eventually read his book
The Republic.
Interesting Fact: All the dialogues are named after the friends of Socrates who
took part in the discussions such as Lysis, Charmides, and Euthydemus.
These folk don’t get much of a word in edgeways after Socrates gets going, so
it’s nice that they get their tribute in the title at least! 
The Ethics: Aristotle
The Ethics is by far the best introduction to Aristotle’s style of philosophy
and scientific method. Aristotle sets out to establish what makes some
people good and others bad and then tries to argue why happiness through
doing good should be everybody’s goal. It’s a cheerful argument, well illus-
trated by a number of sections that try to define qualities such as modesty,
prudence, and generosity.
Interesting Fact: The book includes a table of virtues and vices that also
incorporates a suggestion of the middle course between them that readers
should take. You have no excuse for bad behaviour after you read this 
classic!
Frogs: Aristophanes
Frogs was produced in 405 BC and won first prize in the Lenaea comedy 
festival (see Chapter 16). The comedy is typical good, riotous fun from
Aristophanes. The plot involves the god Dionysus travelling to the under-
world to bring back the dramatist Euripides. On the way Charon the
Ferryman, a greedy Heracles, and the other great Greek dramatist Aeschylus
all make comic cameos. Nearly 2,500 years old and still very funny, Frogs is a
great introduction to Aristophanes and Greek comedy. Even better, try to see
a production. The most recent was a revival of Stephen Sondheim’s version
that played on Broadway in 2004.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Interesting Fact: The play gets its title from the chorus of frogs that live in the
swamps around the entrance to Hades. Their rhythmic songs are one of the
best examples of how musical the comedies were when they were originally
performed.
The Idylls: Theocritus
Theocritus (circa 300 BC) was born in Syracuse but spent most of his life in
Alexandria. Not a great deal of his work survives, but The Idylls are beautiful,
sensitive examples of a very different type of poetry to the epic poetry of
Homer. Set in the Greek countryside and the world of shepherds and
goatherds, The Idylls are said to be the first examples of the bucolic genre.
Very lovelorn and quite melancholic, the poems show a personal and sensi-
tive side of Greek literature. (The beautiful poems of Sappho are worth look-
ing at for the same reason.)
Interesting Fact: The selection of poems also contains a comic dialogue
between Alexandrian women making their way to a festival. Very different
from the rest of Theocritus’s surviving work, this conversation is quite 
amusing and a nice snapshot of life in ancient Alexandria. 
The Romans For Dummies: 
Guy de la Bedoyere
The companion book to The Ancient Greeks For Dummies, this book intro-
duces you to ancient Rome and its incredible story. Although the Romans
may seem like the bad guys who brought glorious ancient Greece to an end,
they were actually responsible for adopting and then preserving a huge
amount of Greek culture. The story of Rome is amazing – take a look!
Interesting Fact: During the second century AD, it became very fashionable
among the Roman aristocracy to develop a big cultural interest in all things
Greek. This was partly motivated by the emperor Hadrian. The name given to
such an individual in Latin was a philhellenicus.

Ten Dodgy Ancient 
Greek Characters
In This Chapter
 Reconsidering heroes
 Questioning generals
 Weighing in on politicians 
T
he history of ancient Greece is full of interesting characters – individuals
who got into some sticky situations or rose to great heights but whose
motivations were sometimes dubious. 
This chapter is a short list of people about whom you may be interested in
finding out more sordid details!
Alcibiades (451–403 BC)
The ultimate dodgy character, Alcibiades was an Athenian general and 
politician who changed sides so often that keeping up with his allegiances 
is difficult. 
Alcibiades was a young playboy about town who everyone thought was 
destined for great things. He was the main mover behind the idea of the 
disastrous Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian War (refer to Chap-
ter 8). He never made it to Sicily because a message reached him that he was
being charged in his absence with blasphemy, including drunkenly mocking
the secrets of the Eleusinian Mysteries (decribed in Chapter 22). These
charges were probably true; throughout his life, he lived to excess.
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Hearing of these charges, Alcibiades literally jumped ship, escaping in a fish-
ing boat, and went to Sparta and worked as an advisor to his former enemy.
But the Spartans soon distrusted him too, and Alcibiades ended up at the
court of a Persian satrap. Eventually he was welcomed back to Athens and
fought successfully for the Athenians for a number of years. After a defeat in
406 BC, he retired to live in Thrace. His was not a peaceful old age – the new
regime in Athens assassinated him two years later.
Alcibiades was a great man who arguably dominated his era, but you 
wouldn’t lend him a fiver!
Odysseus
Yes, that’s right – I’m including Odysseus, the great Greek hero of Homer’s
The Iliad and The Odyssey, on my list of dodgy characters! 
Homer calls Odysseus the ‘master of cunning stratagems’ and throughout the
myths about him, Odysseus continually lies, cheats, and cons. It was
Odysseus who came up with the plan of the Trojan horse, as well as many
other cunning schemes. On several occasions in The Odyssey, he adopts 
disguises given to him by the goddess Athena to work some kind of con.
The ancient Greeks recognised these traits in Odysseus’s character, and later
portrayals of him emphasise his untrustworthiness. In Sophocles’s play
Philoctetes, for example, Odysseus is shown to be cunning and amoral in his
treatment of a wounded archer when he tries to steal the archer’s bow. 
Odysseus was also famed as a teller of tales. Undoubtedly they weren’t all
true!
Pausanias (died circa 450 BC)
Pausanias was a Spartan general who earned a possibly undeserved reputa-
tion for treachery. He was the commander of all the Greek forces at the battle
of Plataea in 479 BC and claimed sole credit for the victory – an act that
didn’t exactly make him popular. The following year he commanded a Greek
fleet that captured the Persian city of Byzantium but was afterwards accused
of treachery. Back in Sparta he was acquitted and unwisely headed back to
Byzantium where he was again accused of treachery! Put on trial several fur-
ther times, Pausanias was eventually convicted of trying to organise a helot
(slave worker) uprising in Sparta. He fled to avoid execution, eventually
starving to death in the Spartan acropolis.

Strangely, several years later the Spartans voted that Pausanias be made a
hero and a cult was established in his honour. Two statues to him were 
eventually constructed. So was he a traitor – or just the victim of powerful
enemies? It’s unlikely that we’ll ever know.
Demetrius (336–283 BC)
Demetrius was the son of Alexander the Great’s successor Antigonus I, king in
Phrygia in Asia Minor. Demetrius grew up a playboy in the Alcibiades style
with a taste for military adventure. 
Demetrius spent many years campaigning like a pirate around the Aegean
and earned the entirely undeserved nickname Poliorcetes, or ‘Besieger of
Cities’. He was responsible for the design and construction of the ‘Helepolis’
siege engine (refer to Chapter 12) during his illegal and unsuccessful attack
on Rhodes. 
Eventually Demetrius was defeated in 285 and surrendered his army to
Seleucus (the king of the Seleucid kingdom in Mesopotamia). He spent the
last two years of his life under house arrest at Seleucus’s court where he
indulged his other two great passions – and effectively ate and drank himself
to death.
Theseus
Like Odysseus, Theseus is another great example of a classic ancient Greek
hero with two sides. 
 On the plus side Theseus travelled to Crete and killed the Minotaur and
was one of the greatest kings of Athens. 
 On the debit side he dumped Ariadne (daughter of King Minos) on the
island of Naxos when she was pregnant with his child and according to
another myth kidnapped the young Helen (of Troy fame) and tried to
force her to be his wife. 
Theseus is a perfect example of the way that the Greeks regarded a ‘hero’ 
as somebody who did amazing things, rather than helped other people 
selflessly. (For more on heroes refer to Chapter 20.)

Olympias (circa 370–316 BC)
As the wife of Philip II of Macedon and the mother of Alexander the Great,
Olympias was always going to have an important place in history, but she’s
famed as being one of the great villains of ancient Greece. 
Many historians believe that Olympias was behind the murder of Philip while
she was in exile. Whether that’s true or not, Olympias certainly ordered the
deaths of Philip’s second wife and her infant daughter on her return. After
Alexander’s death, she tried desperately to cling on to power and was
responsible for several more deaths until she was executed by relatives of
her previous victims in 316 BC. 
To be fair to Olympias, she lived in a court where the choice was to kill or be
killed. And she was just very good at killing!
Alexander the Great (356–323 BC)
Alexander the Great – a bit dodgy? A controversial choice, but a good one, 
I believe: 
Alexander was responsible for some of the greatest military achievements in
the ancient world and created population movements that ushered in the
Hellenistic Age (see Chapter 11). He founded great cities and travelled farther
and wider than anybody else before.
But, during his campaigns, thousands of people were either killed in battle 
or executed and thousands more had their homes and lives destroyed.
Alexander had several of his friends killed who he suspected of treachery – at
least one by his own hands. His savagery to those who resisted him was leg-
endary. Also, his name was used as a kind of bogeyman to scare children in
eastern countries for centuries after his death. ‘Go to bed when I tell you, or
Alexander will get you!’
So, visionary or mass-murdering maniac? You have to judge all of these
people by the standards of their age. History is all about opinions. The
choice is yours!

Diogenes the Cynic (circa 412–321 BC)
Diogenes was a philosopher whose controversial methods made him famous
throughout the ancient world. At various times in his life he lived in a barrel,
was captured by pirates, and was expelled from the town of Sinope for 
‘defacing the currency’ – spoiling coins in an attempt at rejecting the material
world. Diogenes ended up in Corinth and lived the life of a beggar, rejecting
all social conventions including marriage and cleanliness. He was known as
the ‘cynic’ because he was credited with being the founder of the ‘cynic’
branch of philosophy, which disdained conventional life. The word ‘cynic’
comes from the Greek word kynikos which means ‘dog like’. Diogenes
believed people could learn a lot from living like dogs – he did!
Although Diogenes was a proper philosopher who wrote many books, trea-
tises, and several tragic plays, undoubtedly the best story about him con-
cerns his meeting with the young Alexander the Great. When the young king
asked Diogenes if there was anything that Alexander could do for him,
Diogenes replied, ‘Yes, you can move slightly to the left, you’re standing in
my sunlight.’ A brave man indeed!
Jason
Another ancient Greek hero with a dark side, Jason is the celebrated warrior
who journeyed to the Black Sea and stole the Golden Fleece from King Aietes,
along with his daughter, the sorceress Medea (refer to Chapter 20 for the full
story). 
However, the stories about Jason’s return aren’t as flattering as his early
exploits. Eventually he ended up living with Medea in the city of Corinth
where they had two children. In Euripides’s play Medea, Jason dumps Medea
(who, because she was a non-Greek, had no legal status as his bride) to
marry Glauce, the daughter of the king of Corinth, so that he would gain
social status. In an act of revenge, Medea kills both Glauce and her own two
children before fleeing. 
For his part, Jason eked out the rest of his life alone in Corinth, eventually
dying when timber from the rotting hulk of his ship, the Argo, fell on him. An
unheroic end!

Kleon of Athens (died 422 BC)
Kleon gets a bit of an unfair press because the only descriptions that survive
of him are from Aristophanes and Thucydides – neither of whom liked him at
all and (in the case of Aristophanes) continually publicly lampooned him. 
Kleon was one of the first demagogue politicians (see Chapter 7), whose
rabble-rousing political style clashed with old-school Athenian aristocrats
like Pericles. In 426 BC he tried to prosecute Aristophanes over his play The
Babylonians, which he claimed defamed the city of Athens, but the case was
thrown out. 
At the same time Kleon was a brave general who won several victories and
died fighting near Amphipolis. However, most people regard him as being one
of the first to exploit Athens’s new democracy for his own personal glory.

Ten Great Places to Visit
In This Chapter
 Touring museums 
 Walking the sites
 Searching online
 Sampling the art and culture
R
eading books is all well and good, but if you really want to experience
some ancient Greek culture up close and personal, this chapter sug-
gests ten places that are full of it. Visit these locations and you’re sure to feel
a real connection to the world of 2,500 years ago.
Of course, hundreds of other interesting sites with connections to the ancient
Greeks exist, but you have to start somewhere. These just happen to be some
of my favourites. 
The British Museum, London
The British Museum has a superb collection of ancient Greek objects and
artefacts in some really big galleries. The museum houses a great collection
of vases and sculpture from all ancient Greece’s artistic periods (see Chapter
17), plus many Roman copies of famous Greek originals. The fantastic Nereid
Monument, transplanted from Asia Minor, gives a good idea of the scale of
some of the building work that went on during ancient Greece’s prime (refer
to Chapter 18). You can also see some wonderful everyday objects that allow
an insight into what normal Greek lives were like. 
Best of all are the so-called ‘Elgin Marbles’, the Parthenon sculptures that
were taken from Athens by a British adventurer, Lord Elgin, in around 1800.
These are great examples of the metopes, frieze, and the pediment sculpture,
More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

which I discuss in Chapter 18. The Elgin Marbles are all presented with an
excellent display that features reconstructions of what the original temple
looked like and how it was built. In recent years there have been attempts to
force the British Government to return the sculptures to Athens – so go and
see them while they’re still in the British Museum!
The Acropolis, Athens
Of course, Athens is loaded with things to see, but the Acropolis really is a
standout. The Parthenon, the largest temple on the site, is amazingly impres-
sive, but the other temples – such as Athena Nike and the Erectheum – are
also stunning. 
Just next to the Acropolis is the Theatre of Dionysus (described in Chapter 16).
The current theatre is actually a Roman rebuild of the Greek original, but it
still gives you a sense of the size of the performances that used to take place. 
And at a really basic level, simply walking along the streets and through the
gathering spaces where Pericles, Socrates, and all the others once trod is 
fantastic! Local guides are available to take you round but a good guidebook
will suffice. Plan to spend most of the day there and get there early – the
Acropolis can get appallingly hot around lunchtime, a good time to get 
something to eat!
Knossos, Crete
The site of Knossos on the island of Crete feels very different to the other
sites I list in this chapter. As I say in Chapter 2, the Minoans, while technically
Greek, were very different to the ancient Greeks who followed them. 
Knossos was discovered and controversially restored and rebuilt by Sir
Arthur Evans in 1900, but the site that remains is undeniably impressive. One
of the highlights is the superb Royal Palace with its beautiful dolphin decora-
tions. Equally interesting are the workrooms in the east wing. You get a real
sense of a different, earlier time and age. But be warned, walking around the
site in Cretan summer temperatures that can hit over 100 degrees can be
hard work!
328

More free books @ www.BingEbook.com

Crete itself is a fascinating island and worth visiting on its own. It’s an
overnight journey on the ferry from the Greek mainland and quite a distance
to Knossos once you arrive. A visit needs to be part of a planned trip but it’s
well worth the effort.
Delphi
The site of the sanctuary complex at Delphi is amazing. A small town hidden
away in the Peloponnese, Delphi is one of the most beautiful places that you
can visit, boasting spectacular views from the sanctuary, which is built into
the hillside. (Head to Chapter 21 for more on the historical and religious
details about this site.)
A lot of buildings still remain at Delphi, including many treasuries and a large
portion of the base of the Temple of Apollo. At the very top of the site are the
remains of the athletic stadium where the Pythian games (held at Delphi in
honour of Apollo) took place. You can also visit an excellent museum that
includes a wonderful bronze sculpture of the Delphi charioteer. 
Delphi is a little isolated but you can easily book a coach trip from Athens.
It’s worth staying over (plenty of hotels are in town) because the sunrise
looks spectacular across the valley.
Olympia
Olympia is a famous Greek town that’s well worth a visit. The town has
become a bit more touristy than Delphi, but its archaeological site is just as
impressive. 
The ruins of the Temple of Zeus are still near Olympia, along with the work-
shop of Pheidias, where this legendary artist constructed the massive statue
of the god that was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World
(and shown in Chapter 17). 
The site gives you a very good idea of what the original Olympic games were
like, as well as just how much of an event they were (see Chapter 16). If
you’re feeling suitably energetic, you can even run a lap of the stadium –
although be careful, I fell over when I did it! Like Delphi you’ll need to book a
trip to Olympia (or travel there by public transport) and there are many
hotels in town.

A Greek Play
The only way to really get a sense of what the Greek theatre was like is to see
a performance of a Greek play. Any play – tragedy or comedy – will do. In
addition to professional and regional shows, consider attending a university
or community theatre production of these great works. You may even be able
to find a production that’s staged outdoors. (Pack a picnic and bring a bottle
of wine just like the ancients!)
Greek plays aren’t as action-packed as some modern theatre. In fact, you may
be surprised to see how still the performers are (if the play is performed in a
traditional manner). On-stage, you also have the opportunity to see the way
that the chorus is used to support and comment on the action of the central
characters.
Many modern productions update the play to the present or change the 
setting to somewhere different. But just as with Shakespeare, the modern
touches usually still allow the brilliance of the original work to shine through. 
Samos or Another Greek Island
If you want to get a sense of Odysseus’s travels in Homer’s epic poem 
The Odyssey, visit a Greek island and drink in the atmosphere. The history is
great – and the peace and quiet is pretty wonderful too!
It’s difficult to pick a single Greek island to visit because there are hundreds,
but I’m recommending Samos because it is the one I most recently visited!
The closest Greek island to modern Turkey, Samos was a hive of trade and
activity during the heyday of ancient Greece, and the island still has a reason-
able amount of archaeology to look at. 
More than touring remains, however. Samos and many of the other islands
give you a real sense of the independence of these small islands and their 
distance from elsewhere. You can easily see how men like Herodotus broke
new ground by travelling to these areas and sharing their stories with Greeks
on the mainland. You can also appreciate how each community grew and
developed its own versions of myths and relationships with the gods. 
Google Images
This recommendation may seem obvious, but if you want to see more 
examples of Greek art and architecture, go to the Internet!

A quick search (I like images.google.com) reveals a huge number of
photos and drawings. You can very quickly assemble a good library of 
pictures. 
Check out Chapter 17 for an introduction to Greek art and then seek out
some more examples of different types of sculpture. Searching under
‘Hellenistic Sculpture’ or ‘Red Figure Vase Painting’ brings up loads of exam-
ples, each with its own story. The world of ancient Greek art is at your 
fingertips!
The National Gallery, London
The National Gallery may seem like an odd choice of place to visit for ancient
Greek culture, but if you want to see how the Greeks influenced the people
who followed them, then an art gallery is a good place to start. 
Many Renaissance paintings feature scenes from Greek mythology based on
written sources that were rediscovered during that historical period. 
The National Gallery is a good place to start because it features Titian’s fan-
tastic Bacchus and Ariadne (1520–23 AD), an amazing, colourful picture that
shows the abandoned Ariadne being surprised by Bacchus and his swagger-
ing crew of followers. Look for paintings by Titian, Botticelli, Della Francesca,
Veronese, and Rubens – all of whom loved using classical mythology as a
source.
All the Renaissance paintings are idealised, but looking at somebody else’s
interpretation of the myths is still quite inspiring. Go along and let your 
imagination run riot! Art For Dummies by Thomas Hoving and Art History 
For Dummies by Jesse Bryant Wilder offer further insights into the connec-
tions between ancient Greek and later artists.
The Agora, Athens
Still relatively well preserved, Athens’s original town centre was the busiest
part of the greatest of Ancient Greek cities. If you go, take a classical text with
you and sit and read it for a while. The ancient Greeks were having conversa-
tions about the same text 2,500 years ago, probably in the same spot! You’ll
also be sitting in the place where Plato debated with Socrates; Pericles dis-
cussed the Peloponnesian War with his generals; and Alcibiades intrigued
and flirted. Their sandalled feet trod the same ground that you’ll be standing
on. You can’t get much more Greek than that.

The Agora is in the very centre of modern Athens and is surrounded by
modern market stalls. It gives you a sense of the hustle and bustle that must
have been part of city life in the days of ancient Greece. Take a walk around
and pick up something to eat from one of the street vendors – just as an 
average Athenian would have done on his way to the assembly 2,500 
years ago!
